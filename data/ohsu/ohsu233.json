Acute ethanol consumption in human volunteers did not appear to alter active cation fluxes by Na+,K+-ATPase, or intracellular electrolyte concentrations, in peripheral leucocytes or erythrocytes. 2. Urinary electrolyte excretion was decreased after ethanol consumption, compared with controls. 3. Neither plasma glucose nor serum insulin was altered by ethanol. 4. After ethanol consumption there was an elevation of endogenous plasma adrenaline levels. This was accompanied by a leucocytosis, which could be attributed to a raised neutrophil count. 5. The raised adrenaline levels were not associated with hypokalaemia. 6. It is possible that in vivo ethanol may prevent adrenaline-induced hypokalaemia by fluidizing the membrane and/or decreasing the affinity of beta-receptors for adrenaline.\r"

The effects of a single moderate dose of alcohol on blood pressure, heart rate and associated metabolic and endocrine changes were studied in 10 healthy subjects and compared with those of an isocaloric glucose control drink. 2. Systolic blood pressure rose at 1 h after both alcohol and the control drink. Therefore this early change was not specifically due to alcohol ingestion. Subsequently, there was a tendency (not statistically significant) for supine and erect systolic blood pressure to be reduced up to 8 h after alcohol ingestion. There were no consistent late changes in blood pressure observed over 7 days after alcohol. 3. Alcohol caused a marked tachycardia in both supine and erect postures which persisted beyond the time of detectable blood alcohol levels. 4. Blood sugar rose by a similar amount after alcohol and the isocaloric glucose control drink, but peak plasma insulin levels were higher after the control drink. 5. Plasma sodium rose in keeping with alcohol induced water diuresis. No significant changes in plasma potassium or magnesium were seen after alcohol. 6. Compared with the control drink there was no evidence from measurements of circulating adrenaline, noradrenaline, cortisol, aldosterone or renin of activation of the sympathoadrenal axis, adrenal cortex or renin-angiotensin systems after alcohol.\r"

The course of the illness on average is about ten years. A variety of inclusion and exclusion criteria, if used conservatively, can accurately predict the pathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Whereas no specific cause or clearly effective treatment is currently available, care consists of pharmacologic therapy aimed at specific symptoms and measures designed to reduce patient confusion and care-giver burden. The physician can benefit the patient and care giver by providing an accurate diagnosis, providing therapy where available, counseling the family, and providing referrals to available community-support services.\r"

The level of CPAP was altered in 2.5 cmH2O increments and decrements, while conventional measurements of cardiopulmonary function and continuous dual oximetry were performed. Then, optimum CPAP levels were selected using both techniques independently. The difference in optimum CPAP determined by the two methods was 0 cmH2O in ten of 17 patients, less than or equal to 2.5 cmH2O in 14 of 17 patients, and 5.0 to 7.5 cmH2O in the remaining three patients. When a difference existed, CPAP level determined with dual oximetry was consistently lower than the level selected by conventional means. The results indicate that the estimates of venous admixture and oxygen utilization coefficient obtained using dual oximetry provide sufficient information for rapid and accurate titration of CPAP in the majority of patients with acute respiratory failure.\r"

  ".W": "The role played by serotonin (5-HT) in the regulation of bronchomotor tone has up to now been a much debated question, although there is good evidence that it induces intense bronchoconstriction after inhalation in asthmatic patients. Serotonin has been found to contract the tracheobronchial smooth muscle of different animals. Some data suggest that tracheobronchial contraction due to serotonin is mediated by its interaction with the S2-receptor. The blockade of this receptor by ketanserin, a serotoninergic antagonist which primarily binds to S2-serotoninergic receptors, produces bronchodilation. The respiratory effects of intravenously administered ketanserin (10 mg) or placebo were compared in a double-blind crossover study in 14 patients with chronic obstruction of the airways. The forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and the instantaneous forced expiratory flow after 50 percent of the forced vital capacity has been exhaled (FEF50%) did not change after placebo, but they increased significantly after administration of ketanserin. The results suggest that in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, serotonin may play a role in the development of obstruction of the airways, even if the mechanism remains undefined.\r"

The Bayesian algorithm correctly categorized 96 of the 100 lesions, thereby providing an accuracy of 96 percent. The sensitivity of the model was 98 percent and the specificity was 87 percent. All but two of the 85 malignant lesions were correctly categorized and 13 of the 15 benign lesions were correctly analyzed by the model.

Jejunal pressures were recorded by a pneumohydraulic system and five catheter orifices positioned 10-30 cm aborad the ligament of Treitz. Single oral doses of 5 and 10 mg cisapride, administered 5 min after an activity front under random double-blind conditions, induced a phase-2-like jejunal motor pattern with a significantly higher number and amplitude of contractions and significantly more aborally propagated waves than placebo (P less than 0.001), while the number of subjects with activity fronts decreased with increasing dose. Five and 10 mg cisapride administered tid for three days affected psychomotor function, subjective feelings, and side-effect frequency, apart from increases in systolic blood pressure and heart rate, no more than placebo. It is concluded that in fasting man, oral cisapride induces a highly propagative phase-2-like jejunal motor pattern causing only minor side effects.\r"

Recent studies indicate that Crohn's disease in its early stages is frequently associated with the presence of circulating antigen-non-specific suppressor T cells. Such T cells are also found in experimental inflammation caused by Chlamydia organisms in the gastrointestinal tract of nonhuman primates. Taken together, these data suggest that the suppressor T cells are markers of an underlying and persistent, antigen-specific immune response to an as yet unidentified antigen or set of antigens. We postulate that this underlying antigen-specific response is the result of a primary immunoregulatory abnormality involving an imbalance between the effects of antigen-specific helper and suppressor T cells which recognize a common antigen or antigens present in the mucosal environment.\r"

On admission for cholecystectomy because of a gallbladder polyp and gallstones, she often experienced hypoglycemic attacks, and both calcium and glucagon provocation tests elicited marked release of insulin. Selective angiography of the common hepatic artery showed a tumor blush near the hilum of the liver. Immunohistochemical staining of the gallbladder polyp and the bone tumors proved positive for insulin. Plasma levels of insulin and prolactin were abnormally high.

C8 increased both medium IRLH and total [3H]GA-LH (P less than 0.01) without altering total [14C]A-LH. Two hundred micromolar C8 increased medium concentrations of [3H]GA-LH (P less than 0.01) and [14C]A-LH (P less than 0.05). C8 (50-200 microM) had no detectable effects on uptake and incorporation of precursors into protein. GnRH (1 nM) enhanced (P less than 0.01) both medium IRLH and total [3H]GA-LH, but had no effect on total [14C]A-LH. Pretreatment of pituitary cells with 17 beta-estradiol (6 X 10(-10) M) greatly enhanced LH release induced by C8. In conclusion, PMA and C8, like GnRH, stimulated both LH glycosylation and release. These results suggest that PKC may regulate both LH release and glycosylation and may be important in estrogen modulation of LH release.\r"

Vehicle-infused fafa rats had higher CSF IRI levels than did vehicle-infused Fafa rats (4.3 +/- 1.2 microU/ml vs. 1.5 +/- 0.4 microU/ml, P less than 0.01). CSF IRI was elevated in both insulin-infused groups (P less than 0.001). After insulin infusion Fafa rats had higher CSF IRI levels than did fafa rats (Fafa: 10.0 +/- 1.8 microU/ml vs. fafa: 7.1 +/- 0.1 microU/ml). In contrast to the effect of insulin infusion on plasma IRI, the increase of CSF IRI was greater in Fafa rats (8.5 microU/ml) than in fafa rats (4.0 microU/ml, P less than 0.001). Uptake of insulin from the periphery to the CSF therefore appears to be reduced in obese fafa Zucker rats compared to lean Fafa controls.\r"

  ".W": "Synthesis and secretion of POMC-derived peptides appear to be differentially regulated in the anterior pituitary (AP) and neurointermediate lobe (NIL). In the AP, glucocorticoids inhibit, and CRF and arginine vasopressin stimulate, synthesis of POMC and release of immunoreactive (ir)-beta-endorphin (beta EP); in the NIL, synthesis and release of POMC and its derivatives are under tonic inhibitory dopaminergic control. There is, however, evidence for some overlap of these control mechanisms under certain circumstances. In the present study we have used specific RIA and Northern blot analysis to examine the effects of chronic treatment with dopaminergic agents and dexamethasone (DM) (both alone and in combination) on AP and NIL content of ir-beta EP and POMC messenger RNA (mRNA), and/or hypothalamic ir-arginine vasopressin and ir-CRF content. In the NIL, the dopamine agonist bromocriptine reduced and the antagonist haloperidol raised both POMC mRNA and ir-beta EP content. Long term DM treatment did not alter NIL ir-beta EP content in the intact rat, but increased levels of POMC mRNA. DM abolished the haloperidol-induced increase in NIL ir-beta EP content but further increased the haloperidol-induced rise in POMC mRNA. DM treatment lowered both ir-beta EP and POMC mRNA in the AP as well as lowering levels of hypothalamic ir-CRF. In DM-treated rats, haloperidol partially restored AP ir-beta EP and POMC mRNA to control untreated levels. These findings further support the proposition that both dopaminergic agents and glucocorticoids can modulate POMC mRNA levels and/or tissue content of ir-beta EP in both the NIL and AP of the rat. The effects of DM on the NIL, both alone or with haloperidol, suggest that glucocorticoids may have both direct and indirect effects on POMC gene expression in this tissue.\r"

In nondiabetic rats, fasting for 36 h decreased binding of the muscarinic antagonist by 33% (P less than 0.05). Fasting also abolished the insulin response to 10 microM acetylcholine. Diabetes was induced by injecting streptozotocin (STZ) neonatally in rats. At the time of the experiments (6-10 weeks of age) these rats exhibited hyperglycemia (12.6 +/- 1.0 vs. 7.1 +/- 0.3 mM blood glucose in nondiabetics) but had a normal weight. Relative to islets from age- and sex-matched nondiabetic rats, islets from STZ rats were smaller (0.7 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.9 +/- 0.2 nl islet volume) and contained less insulin (218 +/- 33 vs. 1390 +/- 71 microU/islet). When calculated per islet volume, binding of [3H]methylscopolamine to STZ islets was enhanced by 80% in comparison to binding to normal islets (P less than 0.001). Scatchard analysis indicated that enhanced binding was due to increased number of binding sites. Cholinergic-induced insulin release, as assessed by carbamylcholine, was 37% higher in STZ than in normal islets (P less than 0.05) when expressed per islet volume and 3- to 4-fold enhanced in STZ islets when expressed per islet insulin content. Insulin treatment of STZ rats for 3 days lowered blood glucose, diminished binding of [3H]methylscopolamine, and abolished carbamylcholine-induced insulin secretion. We conclude that the level of glycemia in vivo participates in the regulation of the number of muscarinic receptors in the pancreatic islet and that such regulation is associated with changes in cholinergic-induced insulin secretion.\r"

Although serum Ca and phosphate (Pi) levels did not change significantly after dietary Ca deprivation for 1 week, urinary cAMP excretion increased significantly, indicating that dietary Ca deprivation caused secondary hyperparathyroidism without a significant change in serum Ca level. In control rats, renal 1 alpha-hydroxylase activity increased markedly from 0.11 +/- 0.05 to 1.70 +/- 0.46 ng/300 mg tissue/20 min in parallel with the change in serum 1,25(OH)2D level from 121 +/- 8 to 360 +/- 54 pg/ml in response to Ca deprivation. In contrast, serum 1,25(OH)2D level (82 +/- 3 pg/ml) and 1 alpha-hydroxylase activity (0.07 +/- 0.02 ng/300 mg tissue.20 min) were lower in the diabetic rats on a normal Ca diet than those in control rats, and the increase in both 1,25(OH)2D level and 1 alpha-hydroxylase activity in response to Ca deprivation was suppressed in diabetic rats (136 +/- 24 pg/ml and 0.38 +/- 0.12 ng/300 mg tissue.20 min, respectively, after Ca deprivation). Insulin treatment of the diabetic rats restored the baseline levels of serum 1,25(OH)2D (125 +/- 14 pg/ml) and renal 1 alpha-hydroxylase activity (0.21 +/- 0.02 ng/300 mg tissue.20 min) as well as those after Ca deprivation (340 +/- 52 pg/ml and 2.05 +/- 0.30 ng/300 mg tissue.20 min, respectively). Furthermore, when control and diabetic rats were thyroparathyroidectomized and infused with a maximal stimulatory dose of PTH, the increase in serum 1,25(OH)2D and renal 1 alpha-hydroxylase activity in response to PTH was markedly inhibited in diabetic rats. In addition, the baseline levels of serum 1,25(OH)2D and renal 1 alpha-hydroxylase activity in thyroparathyroidectomized diabetic rats were not different from those in control rats. These results are consistent with the conclusion that insulin plays an important role in the regulation of renal 1 alpha-hydroxylase activity and serum 1,25(OH)2D levels in response to PTH.\r"

The mechanism(s) by which these diverse compounds act and their relevance to insulin action remain unclear. The hypothesis that increased intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) may provide the common basis for the stimulatory effects of these agents on glucose uptake in adipocytes was tested. This was accomplished by preincubating cells with the membrane-permeant ester, quin2-AM (2-[(2-bis[carboxymethyl] amino-5-methylphenoxy]-6-methoxy-8-bis[carboxymethyl]- aminoquinolinetetrakis [acetoxymethyl] ester), which is rapidly accumulated and hydrolyzed by esterases to form the impermeant tetracarboxylate chelator form, quin2. Vanadate, Con A, H2O2, and TPA stimulate D-glucose uptake in adipocytes approximately 3-, 3-, 2-, and 0.6-fold, respectively, compared to the 5- to 10-fold stimulation of D-glucose uptake obtained with insulin. Preincubation with quin2-AM produced a dose-dependent inhibitory effect only on the stimulated portion of glucose transport without affecting basal (unstimulated) transport. The concentrations for half-maximal inhibition (IC50) of stimulated glucose transport by quin2-AM were 26, 35, 25, 14, and 34 microM for insulin, vanadate, Con A, H2O2, and TPA, respectively. Quin2-AM maximally inhibited stimulated glucose uptake by greater than 85% for all of the insulin mimetic agents. In contrast the maximal inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport by quin2-AM was 55 +/- 4%. Therefore, stimulation of glucose transport by insulin and other diverse compounds appears to involve at least one common calcium-dependent intermediate step.\r"

Binding of [125I]IGF-I to islet A cells was half-maximally inhibited by 7.10(-10) M IGF-I, while IGF-II, insulin, and proinsulin were respectively 10-, 500-, and 10,000-fold less potent displacers of IGF-I binding. Unrelated hormones such as glucagon or GH did not compete with [125I]IGF-I binding to A cells. The concentration of IGF-I receptors on A cells was estimated at 5000 IGF-I binding sites per cell with affinity constant (Ka) of 2 X 10(9) M-1. Islet B cells were found to exhibit a reversible time- and temperature-dependent binding with [125I]IGF-I. Specificity and affinity of IGF-I binding sites were identical for islet A and B cells. Linear Scatchard plots of competitive binding data on B cells suggest 1 single class of IGF-I receptors in a concentration of 12,000 sites per cell. The presence of high affinity receptors for IGF-I on adult islet A and B cells provides a molecular basis for this growth factor to influence growth, survival, and/or function of these endocrine cell types. Their low affinity for insulin should be considered as a potential mechanism for this hormone to influence, at high concentration, the function of islet A and B cells.\r"

In the gradient fractions, there was a close cellular correlation between the presence of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta HSD), determined by cytochemistry, and other Leydig cell markers (nonspecific esterase, autofluorescence, and an antigen defined by monoclonal antibody LC-1C6). As the reagents for 3 beta HSD cytochemistry are excluded by intact membranes, Leydig cells with damaged plasma membranes were identified by 3 beta HSD reactivity in suspended cell preparations, and the total number of 3 beta HSD-positive (3 beta HSD+) cells in the same preparations was determined after lysis of the cell membrane. Whole cells were differentiated from cytoplasmic fragments by counterstaining with the nuclear dye propidium iodide, and the number of intact Leydig cells in each preparation was determined subsequently by subtracting the number of damaged nucleated 3 beta HSD+ cells from the total number of nucleated 3 beta HSD+ cells. The majority of intact isolated Leydig cells were found in gradient fractions of 1.054-1.096 g/ml density. Acute (3-H) basal and hCG-stimulated testosterone production per intact Leydig cell were dependent upon the concentration of Leydig cells per assay well, indicating that there is cooperativity among Leydig cells in vitro. There was no difference in steroidogenic function among intact Leydig cells from different fractions of the above density gradient range at assay concentrations greater than 10,000 Leydig cells/well. At lower cell concentrations, Leydig cells from gradient fractions of lower density (1.054-1.064 g/ml) produced slightly less testosterone in response to hCG stimulation than Leydig cells from more dense fractions (1.070-1.096 g/ml). Prolonging the exposure of isolated cells to the dispersal conditions caused declines in the apparent buoyant density and basal testosterone and hCG-stimulated cAMP and testosterone production of all Leydig cells, without detectable changes in cell integrity. The data indicate that both the absolute steroidogenic function and the functional heterogeneity of isolated intact Leydig cells are, at least in part, dependent upon the procedures used for their isolation.\r"

  ".U": "88029258\r", 
  ".W": "The placenta is the primary source of estrogens and progesterone during pregnancy. Because pregnant diabetic women are reported to have lower serum estrogen and higher progesterone concentrations than nondiabetic pregnant women, we studied the roles of insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) in the regulation of human cytotrophoblastic aromatase and P450 side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450 SCC) activities. Incubation of cytotrophoblasts with insulin or IGF-I for 24 h significantly inhibited the conversion of androstenedione to estrogens by approximately 20-40%. Insulin and IGF-I suppressed aromatization at doses as low as 20 and 10 ng/ml, respectively. Insulin's suppressive effect was demonstrable only after 18-22 h of incubation, suggesting an effect of insulin on aromatase protein mass rather than on aromatase activity. Cytotrophoblasts pretreated with insulin for 24 h possessed 23-30% less aromatase activity than control cells, as quantitated directly by the specific release of 3H2O from [3H]androstenedione, indicating that insulin inhibited estrogen synthesis rather than increased estrogen catabolism. Insulin's suppressive effect on aromatase was not due to a toxic effect of insulin, since incubates exposed to insulin for 24 h showed no decrease in cell number, cellular DNA content, or cellular protein content compared to control incubates. Also, insulin's suppression of aromatization was not due to increased cAMP phosphodiesterase activity, since cotreatment with 1 mM (Bu)2cAMP did not alter insulin's suppressive effect. Blockade of the IGF-I receptor of cytotrophoblasts with alpha IR-3, a monoclonal anti-IGF-I receptor antibody, prevented the suppression of aromatase activity by IGF-I, but did not alter insulin's inhibitory effect. This suggests that the two hormones inhibit aromatization via activation of their specific receptors and not by cross-association. Insulin treatment did not affect P450 SCC activity, whereas IGF-I treatment significantly stimulated P450 SCC activity by 19-36%, as measured by the conversion of 25-hydroxycholesterol to progesterone. These studies indicate that insulin exerts a selective inhibitory effect on cytotrophoblastic aromatase activity, whereas IGF-I inhibits aromatase activity but stimulates P450 SCC activity. Since pregnant diabetic women manifest peripheral hyperinsulinemia, and IGF-I levels in fetal cord sera from diabetic pregnancies are elevated, these observations may help explain the lower serum estrogen and elevated progesterone levels associated with diabetic pregnancy.\r"

Twenty-five of 26 ectopic pregnancies resolved without need of laparotomy. Two subjects received blood transfusions and one required a second operation for intra-abdominal bleeding. In both cases, fetal cardiac activity was noted pretreatment on ultrasound.

Maximal cervical mucus scores, as determined using a modified Insler score, were noted to coincide consistently with the urinary LH surge as detected by twice daily testing and to precede ultrasound evidence of ovulation by 0 to 24 hours. Mucus scores rapidly declined in the 24-hour period following the urinary LH surge. Detection of the urinary LH surge may therefore help identify that period of time during which cervical mucus parameters are optimal and therefore facilitate the timing of artificial insemination, intercourse, or postcoital testing.\r"

Insulin (0.0025 mU/ml to 2500 mU/ml) had no effect on either basal or hCG stimulation during the culture period. GLC in culture formed a monolayer and multiplied at a rate of approximately once every 3 days. Neither morphology nor cell division was affected by insulin in supraphysiologic levels (25 mU/ml). These results suggest that GLC obtained from preovulatory follicles in an IVF program are already stimulated maximally by in vivo exposure to high doses of human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG)/hCG administered to the women. Contrary to its stimulatory effect on early preovulatory granulosa cells, insulin dose not affect P production, cellular morphology, or growth rate of luteinized granulosa cells.\r"

The oocyte of evoluting follicles was intensely positive for both types of receptors, but this positivity decreases in large follicles. An evident positivity for both TFr and SMCr was shown in granulosa cells of evoluting follicles. However, not all of these cells were equally immunoreactive. An intense positivity was present in the developing thecal cells of early cavitary follicles as well as in thecal cells of follicles of medium and large size (greater than 6 mm) and in some cells of involuting follicles in initial atresia. These results seem to demonstrate that TFr and SMCr are present in different cellular components of the human developing and early involuting follicles.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the cytotoxic effects to islet cells of lymphoid cells from diabetic and diabetes-resistant (DR) BioBreeding/Worcester (BB/W) rats with a 51Cr-release assay to detect lysis of normal rat islet cells. Splenic lymphoid cells from diabetic rats were more cytotoxic to islet cells (11.3 +/- 3.8%) than were lymphoid cells from DR rats (4.0 +/- 2.6%). This difference was amplified by incubating the lymphoid cells for 20 h with 5 micrograms/ml concanavalin A (ConA); islet cell lysis was 39.3 +/- 4.5% by ConA-activated diabetic cells and 9.6 +/- 2.7% by ConA-activated DR cells. The cytotoxic lymphoid cells were identified as natural killer (NK) cells, because treatment of diabetic lymphoid cells with anti-asialo GM1 serum and complement selectively removed a monoclonal antibody-defined subset of NK cells (OX8 +), and the NK-depleted lymphoid cells were not cytotoxic to either islet or NK-sensitive YAC-1 cells, even after culture with ConA. Of several lymphokine products of ConA-stimulated lymphoid cells, interleukin 2 (IL-2), but not interleukin 1 or interferon-gamma, significantly activated splenic lymphoid cells cytotoxic to islet cells, and the lymphoid cells from diabetic rats were more sensitive to IL-2 (3 U/ml) than were the cells from DR rats (30 U/ml). This study reveals the presence of ConA- and IL-2-responsive islet cytotoxic NK cells in the diabetic BB/W rat and suggests that IL-2 activation of NK cells may contribute to islet beta-cell destruction and diabetes in this animal.\r"

  ".W": "In vivo glucose uptake (Rd) occurs via two mechanisms: insulin-mediated glucose uptake (IMGU), which occurs in insulin-sensitive tissues, and non-insulin-mediated glucose uptake (NIMGU), which occurs in both insulin-sensitive and non-insulin-sensitive tissues. To determine whether these two pathways for in vivo glucose disposal are regulated independently, we studied the effect of stress levels of cortisol on IMGU and NIMGU in seven normal subjects after an overnight fast. To study NIMGU, somatostatin (SRIF, 600 micrograms/h) was infused to suppress endogenous insulin secretion and create severe insulinopenia, and glucose turnover was measured isotopically while serum glucose was clamped at approximately 200 mg/dl for 240 min. Separate studies were performed during the overnight infusion of saline or hydrocortisone (HCT; 2.0 micrograms.kg-1.min-1). The final 120 min of each study were used for data analysis. Under these conditions, insulin action is absent, and Rd = NIMGU. NIMGU was 204 +/- 11 mg/min and 208 +/- 8 mg/dl during saline and HCT, respectively (P NS). Therefore, HCT did not modulate NIMGU. To measure the effect of cortisol on Rd, hyperglycemic (200 mg/dl)-hyperinsulinemic clamp studies (30 mU.m-2. min-1) were performed during the infusion of saline or HCT. The results demonstrate that during saline infusion, steady-state rates of Rd (10.4 +/- 0.8 mg.kg-1.min-1) were achieved by 160 min; in contrast, during HCT infusion, Rd never reached steady state but increased from 4.5 +/- 0.2 in the 2nd h to 7.6 +/- 0.4 mg.kg-1.min-1 in the 4th h, P less than .01.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To test this hypothesis, immune complex disease was induced in both insulin-deficient (I-) and insulin-treated (I+) rats with streptozocin-induced diabetes mellitus (DM), and the rats were compared with their respective controls. Heymann nephritis (HN), an animal model of membranous nephropathy, was induced in rats by immunization with proximal renal tubular brush border antigen. In addition to the homogeneous mesangial deposits of IgG that developed in diabetic rats, diabetic rats with immune injury also developed immune deposits of IgG and tubular antigen. Diabetic animals with Heymann nephritis developed more intense granular mesangial and capillary wall immune deposits, detected by immunofluorescence (ranked-sums test, P = .002) and electron microscopy. Mesangial immune deposits were associated with mesangial hypercellularity, determined by counting nuclei per glomerular cross section. Diabetic animals with immune injury had an increased number of nuclei (DM, I-, HN: 70 +/- 4; DM, I+, HN: 65 +/- 3) compared with animals with only Heymann nephritis (55 +/- 4) or only diabetes [DM, I-: 52 +/- 4; DM, I+: 54 +/- 3 (mean +/- SE); P less than .05, ANOVA]. An increase in the accumulation of mesangial matrix in diabetic animals with Heymann nephritis was also apparent by light microscopy and immunofluorescence staining of the mesangium for fibronectin. Insulin treatment and control of hyperglycemia did not prevent the development of these changes. Animals with only Heymann nephritis had lesser amounts of immune deposits, which were limited to the subepithelial space and not associated with structural alterations of the mesangium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Control pups and pups of diabetic dogs were studied in the basal state and after each group of pups was randomly fed equivalent amounts of galactose or glucose by oral-gastric tubes. Basal fasting blood glucose levels were not statistically different between the groups, whereas basal plasma insulin levels were 2-3 times higher in pups born to diabetic mothers. Blood glucose levels at each time point in response to glucose or galactose feeding in pups of diabetic mothers were not statistically different; however, the rise of plasma insulin concentrations was attenuated in pups of diabetic mothers fed galactose. The increase in the systemic rate of appearance of glucose and in glucose clearance were attenuated in pups of diabetic mothers fed galactose compared with those fed glucose. Hepatic glycogen content was augmented above basal levels in pups of diabetic mothers. Although glycogen synthase activity was not different between glucose- or galactose-fed pups of diabetic mothers, the active component of glycogen phosphorylase was reduced by both glucose and galactose feedings. Galactose alimentation had a greater effect on glycogen phosphorylase than did glucose alimentation. The observed increase in glycogen synthesis and reduced systemic glucose appearance after galactose alimentation could not be accounted for by the previously proposed excess of galactokinase over glucokinase activities when the latter enzyme was assayed at saturation. Indeed, neonatal hepatic glucokinase activity appeared to be induced during diabetic pregnancy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is a genetic disorder characterized by two major pathogenic processes: reduced insulin action and a relative or absolute decrease in plasma insulin concentrations. We studied 116 nondiabetic siblings from 45 families to determine if in vivo insulin action showed any aggregation among siblings. Subjects were Pima Indians from the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona who, as a group, have the highest reported incidence and prevalence of NIDDM in the world. In vivo insulin action was determined by the euglycemic-clamp technique at two rates of insulin infusion in each subject with resulting mean plasma insulin concentrations of 119 and 1938 microU/ml. After adjustment for age, sex, and degree of obesity, there was significant aggregation among siblings of in vivo insulin action at the high insulin infusion rate (P less than or equal to .0001). Family membership independently accounted for approximately 34% of the variance in this measure of insulin action. Glucose uptake at the lower insulin infusion rate also showed familial aggregation (P less than .01), with family membership independently accounting for approximately 15% of the variance of this measurement. We conclude that in vivo insulin action is a familial characteristic. The familial component of insulin action occurs in addition to the effects of obesity, age, and sex on insulin action. Therefore it is not sufficient to simply know that an individual is lean or obese to predict his/her in vivo insulin resistance, because it must also be known whether he/she is from an insulin-resistant or insulin-sensitive family.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88030452\r", 
  ".W": "Increased lipid oxidation is generally observed in subjects with obesity and diabetes and has been suggested to be responsible for the insulin resistance associated with these conditions. We measured, by continuous indirect calorimetry, lipid and glucose oxidation and nonoxidative glucose disposal in 82 obese subjects during a 100-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and in 26 during a euglycemic insulin (40 mU.min-1.m-2) clamp. The obese subjects were subdivided into those with normal glucose tolerance (group A), those with impaired glucose tolerance (group B), and those with overt diabetes (group C). Forty-five healthy nonobese subjects were subdivided into a young and an older control group, which were age-matched to the nondiabetic obese (groups A and B) and diabetic obese (group C) subjects, respectively. In the postabsorptive state, as well as in response to insulin stimulation (both OGTT and insulin clamp), lipid oxidation was significantly increased in all three obese groups in comparison with either young or older controls. Basal glucose oxidation was significantly decreased in obese nondiabetic and obese glucose--intolerant subjects (groups A and B) compared with age-matched controls. During the OGTT and during the insulin clamp, insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation was decreased in all three obese groups. In contrast, nonoxidative glucose disposal was markedly inhibited in nondiabetic and diabetic obese patients during the euglycemic insulin clamp but not during the OGTT. After glucose ingestion, nonoxidative glucose uptake was normal in nondiabetic obese and glucose-intolerant obese subjects and decreased in diabetic obese subjects. Statistical analysis revealed that lipid and glucose oxidation were strongly and inversely related in the basal state, during euglycemic insulin clamp, and during OGTT. The negative correlation between lipid oxidation and nonoxidative glucose uptake, although significant, was much weaker. Fasting and post-OGTT hyperglycemia were the strongest (negative) correlates of nonoxidative glucose disposal in both single and multiple regression models. We conclude that 1) reduced glucose oxidation and reduced nonoxidative glucose disposal partake of the insulin resistance of nondiabetic obese and diabetic obese individuals; 2) hyperglycemia provides a compensatory mechanism for the defect in nonoxidative glucose disposal in nondiabetic obese subjects; however, this compensation is characteristically lost when overt diabetes ensues; and 3) increased lipid oxidation may contribute, in part, to the defects in glucose oxidation and nonoxidative glucose uptake in obesity.\r"

Research on variations in rates of referral by general practitioners in the UK is reviewed here. Studies have largely failed to account for variation either in terms of differences in the characteristics of patients or differences in the doctors and their practices. It is argued that this failure arises because most studies do not distinguish between different types of referral or reasons for making a referral. In order to begin to explain variations it is necessary to identify the stages in the complex process of decision making. A theoretical model of the referral decision is advanced, which is intended to provide a framework for further research on the referral process.\r"

There are few data from controlled studies to provide rational guidelines for the frequency of both dressing changes and patient visits for the physician. Conclusions concerning infection drawn from studies on major burns are misleading when applied to the management of minor burns. Trauma to regenerating epithelium caused by frequent dressing change is of relatively less importance in treating major burns, because the control of infection is of overriding importance. In the treatment of minor burns, the traumatic consequences of too frequent changes of dressing may assume greater importance. There is a clear need to study the variables in the treatment of minor burns and to generate criteria for their clinical management that are distinct from those of major burn management. Collaborative studies of out-patient populations by providers of primary health care are suggested as a useful approach to such investigation. The effects of several additional therapies are reviewed, including initial cold therapy, debridement of blisters and antibiotics.\r"

Unfortunately, the elderly patient often displays severe ischemia with pain at rest, and ulceration or gangrene of the extremity, even where there was a paucity of prior claudication, perhaps due to associated illness which reduces mobility. The essential aspects of clinical diagnosis and assessment of severity of ischemia involve relatively simple bedside techniques, and noninvasive laboratory methodology is mainly of value in selection of patients for angiography and potential revascularization. While conventional therapy involves bypass surgery, an expanding array of drugs and the advent of interventional angiographic measures including angioplasty offer alternatives which were not available even a few years ago.\r"

The proportion of mucosal IgA1 cells was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) in ulcerative colitis (median, 71.2%) than in Crohn colitis (median, 56.9%). Within each category of specimens no significant differences were noted between luminal and basal mucosal zones. The submucosal proportion of IgA1 cells was, however, significantly higher than the mucosal one in both ulcerative colitis (median, 89.1%; p less than 0.002) and Crohn colitis (median, 91.8%; p less than 0.005). The mucosal shift towards IgA1 production paralleled the magnitude of the submucosal IgA1 cell proportion in individual tissue samples. Taken together with the previously reported dramatic increase of local IgG production (particularly observed in the submucosa and basal parts of the mucosa), our findings indicated that there is an influx and/or proliferation of B cells representing systemic secondary immunity in the lesions of both diseases.\r"

Patients with a spontaneous defecation of less than three stools per week entered the treatment period and were randomly assigned to double blind treatment with either cisapride (n = 64) or placebo (n = 62).

  ".W": "The ability of adapting ileal enterocytes to express different digestive enzymes in their brush border membranes was tested in young female Wistar rats (n = 72) receiving 60% proximal small bowel resection. In control rats with intestinal transection both neutral aminopeptidase and alpha-glucosidase activities were shown, by quantitative cytochemistry, to increase during enterocyte migration over the lower part of the villus; thereafter enzyme activities declined or remained approximately constant. Proximal enterectomy increased the amount of alpha-glucosidase but not neutral aminopeptidase activity appearing during early enterocyte development. Thymidine labelled autoradiography showed that the rate of enterocyte migration along the ileal villus nearly doubled after jejunal resection (19.3 v 11.1 microns/h). Nevertheless, the time taken for both peptidase and saccharidase activities to appear at maximal rates in the brush border membrane was diminished by about five hours. Thus ileal enterocytes adapt to proximal small bowel resection by selective increments in enzyme expression, findings that contradict the previous hypothesis of simple metabolic immaturity.\r"

We examined 48 jejunal biopsy specimens taken from 35 coeliac children before treatment (11), during gluten free diet (20) and after gluten challenge (17), and 13 control specimens. The luminal surface of the epithelial cells stained with HLA-DR antiserum in all specimens, but the cytoplasm of the surface epithelial cells took up the stain more frequently in the specimens from the controls (5/13) than those from the coeliacs (2/48) (p less than 0.01). In 21/28 specimens taken from coeliacs when on a gluten containing diet the crypt epithelium showed strong HLA-DR expression, while only 4/20 (p less than 0.01) specimens of coeliacs on a gluten free diet and 1/13 specimens of controls had similar staining. Among the intraepithelial lymphocytes no cells of NK phenotype were found in specimens from patients or controls. As compared with control specimens biopsy specimens from untreated coeliac patients showed smaller numbers of NK cells in the lamina propria. No difference was found in the numbers of IgE containing cells between the patients and controls. The strong expression of HLA-DR by the crypt epithelial cells in coeliac children on a normal diet suggest that these cells are involved in the presentation of the antigen.\r"

Noninvasive testing by routine exercise stress testing and stress radionuclide angiography are not reliably predictive of ischemia resulting from obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease and should be abandoned for that diagnostic purpose. Noninvasive thallium-201 myocardial perfusion imaging for this purpose may prove to be a valuable tool, avoiding the risk and expense of coronary arteriography. However, carefully performed prospective studies are not available. Because of the high prevalence of both diseases, a high priority must be given to obtaining these data and evaluating other noninvasive methods (especially positron emission tomography) if they appear promising.\r"

  ".W": "Abnormalities in the vasopressin and renin systems have been reported in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Therefore, studies were performed to evaluate the responsiveness of these systems to changes in plasma osmolality and sodium concentration. These variables were manipulated in vivo by intraperitoneal administration of distilled water, isotonic saline, or hypertonic saline to 8- and 18-week-old SHR and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Animals were decapitated 30 minutes later, and trunk blood was collected. The hypertonic saline injections resulted in an increase in plasma osmolality and serum sodium at both ages (p less than 0.001). Serum vasopressin was higher in all groups of animals receiving hypertonic saline (1200 mosm/kg H2O; p less than 0.05), but the magnitude of increase was not significantly different in the SHR and WKY at either age. Serum renin activity was lower in SHR than in WKY following acute decreases in serum sodium at 8 weeks, but it was the same for both strains at 18 weeks. Both kidney renin content and concentration were lower in SHR than in WKY at 18 weeks but not at 8 weeks. Therefore, the suppressed renin response to acute osmotic challenge in 8-week-old SHR is not the consequence of reduced kidney renin content. The vasopressin response to osmotic stimulation also was evaluated in vitro using hypothalamoneurohypophyseal explants obtained from 5-, 8-, and 18-week-old SHR and WKY.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A 1000 base pair rat renin complementary DNA was used to show that these cells express the renin gene. The reverse hemolytic plaque assay defined the functional properties of the renin-containing cell. The data are consistent with the postulated inverse relationship between calcium concentration and release of renin. Thus, we have isolated a population of functional rat kidney cells that synthesize, store, and release renin.\r"

At the end of this period systolic blood pressure had increased from 124 +/- 2 to 145 +/- 2 (SEM) mm Hg in the fructose-fed rats, whereas no change occurred in the control group. In addition, hyperinsulinemia and hypertriglyceridemia were associated with hypertension in fructose-fed rats. The addition of clonidine to the drinking water inhibited fructose-induced hypertension, but not the increase in plasma insulin or triglyceride concentration seen in fructose-fed rats. Thus, the metabolic changes associated with fructose-induced hypertension are unlikely to be secondary to an increase in sympathetic activity. Whether or not this is also true of the hypertension remains to be clarified.\r"

The hypoxemia, according to the authors, is mainly related to the loss of carbon dioxide through the dialyser. A minor role may be played by complement activation causing temporary sequestration of leukocytes in the pulmonary capillaries with (asymptomatic) peripheral leukopenia on the one hand and plugging of the pulmonary capillary bed with transient pulmonary hypertension and hypoxemia on the other. The question of dialysis-associated eosinophilia and ethylene oxide hypersensitivity is addressed as also contributing to the first use syndrome. The effects of interleukin release from monocytes and of contamination of the dialysis fluid are briefly discussed. The rare syndrome of silicone rubber spallation with hepato-and splenomegaly is also mentioned and finally the pathogenesis and symptomatology of the beta 2 microglobulin amyloidosis syndrome in long-term dialysis patients is presented.\r"

It is important to distinguish this disease from orbital cellulitis, a potentially lethal infectious process involving the contents of the orbit. A retrospective study of clinical and laboratory data from 137 cases with orbital and periorbital cellulitis was performed. Periorbital cellulitis was documented in 98 cases (71%) in contrast to orbital cellulitis, which was noted in 39 (28%) patients. Sinusitis was the most frequently encountered predisposing factor for the development of periorbital cellulitis occurring in 29 patients. All patients with a diagnosis of periorbital cellulitis were hospitalized and received antibiotics, the majority (95%) receiving intravenous therapy. Hemophilus influenzae was the most frequently isolated pathogenic organism. It was necessary to operate on eight patients. Six patients underwent incision and drainage of an eyelid or periorbital abscess. A distinction between periorbital and orbital cellulitis is clarified. The separation of these entities on the basis of physical examination and radiographic studies is stressed.\r"

All of the patients had had a clenched-fist deformity preoperatively, with severe hygienic problems of the palmar skin and no active function of the hand. Postoperatively, all of the hands were in an open position, which allowed for good hygiene of the palmar surface. A minor wound infection developed in three patients. Neurectomy of the motor branch of the ulnar nerve distal to the Guyon canal was needed for control of spasticity of the intrinsic muscles in twenty-five hands. An intrinsic-minus deformity did not develop in any of the hands that had neurectomy of the ulnar nerve, although an intrinsic-plus deformity developed in seven of the nine hands that did not have a neurectomy.\r"

  ".W": "Since 1975, nine patients who had adamantinoma of the tibia were treated by the orthopaedic oncology service of the Massachusetts General Hospital and the Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts. All patients were followed for two years or more or until a relapse occurred (mean length of follow-up, 5.3 years). Five of the patients were female and four were male; their ages ranged from fourteen to fifty-six years (mean, 19.1 years). The treatment consisted of staging, wide surgical resection of the tumor, and insertion of a segment of intercalary bone allograft (eight patients) or an osteoarticular segment (one patient). All grafts were fixed with compression plates and screws. All but two of the allografts had united at both the proximal and the distal host-donor junction site by twelve months. None of the patients had a local recurrence but pulmonary metastases developed in one. Four of the patients had complications that affected the final result. The functional results were excellent in five patients, good in one, fair in one, and a failure in two. Seven of the nine patients were asymptomatic and fully functional at the time of writing; only one needed a brace to walk. On the basis of this experience we recommend wide resection and implantation of an intercalary allograft in the treatment of adamantinoma of the tibia.\r"

Currently cyclosporin A is in general use for its immunosuppressive property, so that a lower dose of corticosteroids is needed. We analyzed the cases of a series of our patients who underwent transplantation of a kidney in order to find out if our present regimen, using cyclosporin A, influenced the prevalence of osteonecrosis of the femoral head. Of a total of 270 patients, osteonecrosis of the femoral head developed in fifteen of 174 who received conventional immunosuppressive therapy and in only one of ninety-six who received cyclosporin A (p less than 0.05). During the first two months after transplantation, the mean dose of prednisone was approximately 2.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day in the group that received conventional immunosuppressive therapy and approximately 1.1 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day in the group that received cyclosporin A (p less than 0.001). We concluded that the pathogenesis of the osteonecrosis in patients who underwent transplantation of a kidney was probably related to the higher doses of corticosteroids that were administered.\r"

The nature of the medication was blinded both to the patient and to the evaluator. Patients were followed for one year. Observations were made for range of motion, scar thickness, change in graft size, and ultimate cosmetic appearance. No beneficial effect of either vitamin E or topical steroid could be demonstrated. However, adverse reactions occurred in 16.4% of patients receiving active drug, compared to 5.9% treated only with base cream. Interestingly, the grafts initially contracted and subsequently grew to be a size larger (about 20%) than the original graft by one year. It is concluded that neither topical steroid nor topical vitamin E is effective in reducing scar formation after grafting procedures for reconstruction for postburn contractures.\r"

Their studies show fluorescein levels in full-thickness burns to be far below control levels and partial-thickness burns to be about 60% of nonburned skin. In both rat and human models, 59 burn sites (eight rats) and 37 burn sites (seven patients) were assessed. Readings were taken for three hours on the rats and one hour on the patients during the first 48 hours, and the procedure was repeated for five days postburn. Maximum values during these periods were determined for burn and nonburn sites, and background levels were subtracted from these values. The rate of fluorescein uptake and the peak times for burn and nonburn sites were then compared. Actual depth of burn was determined by whether or not healing had occurred. The results showed no significant difference between partial-thickness and full-thickness burns using fluorometry, as standard deviations in both models for both depths of burn were large. Therefore, fluorometry did not provide a definitive evaluation of burn depth. These results differ from those reported by previous investigators.\r"

One of the major problems in dealing with this complication is the lack of an adequate animal model with which to test various possible therapeutic modalities. We describe an animal model that uses human skin applied to the backs of nude mice to investigate the problem. Immunosuppression is not necessary in this model since the nude mouse lacks a thymus gland and is therefore not able to reject the skin. With this model we have been able to achieve contracture of meshed normal human skin grafts and hypertrophic scar formation in normal human skin that was burned a month after grafting to the mouse. We have also had success in grafting human hypertrophic scars, obtained from burn patients, to the mice. This model offers unique opportunities for investigation of the cause and treatment of burn scars in humans.\r"

Daily evaluations were made of subjective expression of pain, exudate formation and infection, and time of separation of the dressing from the wound. Biobrane was found to be superior in reducing donor site pain. However, with Biobrane there was a higher incidence of infection (57% v 9.5%) and a significant delay in separation from the wound. Scarlet red was found to be more cost-effective. Occlusive dressings have previously been shown to have a high incidence of complications (30%). In extensive burns, isolating the donor site from the wound is difficult and may lead to increased complications. Scarlet red appears to be superior to Biobrane for skin graft donor sites in this patient population.\r"

Some of these lesions can be treated by total excision in one or more stages or they can be reconstructed utilizing grafts, flaps, Z-plasties, or tissue expansion. But frequently these procedures are either not indicated or not elected by the patient. In such a situation, the only surgical option is partial excision, with the goal of making the lesion less conspicuous and more easily concealed by clothing. Whether or not such partial excisions are worthwhile is the obvious question. We could not find an answer in the literature and therefore decided to review our own experience. Between 6/30/81 and 3/12/86, 92 such procedures were performed and followed in 25 patients. Partial excision of hypertrophic donor sites, unsightly skin grafts, and hypertrophic scars did yield improved appearance in most patients. However, partial excision of mature scars, ie, areas of altered pigmentation or texture, did not have the same success. We continue to treat the first three types of lesions in this fashion but no longer include the latter.\r"

The pulsatile assist device was used for pulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass during aortic cross-clamping only, and samples of the mixed venous blood were taken every 20 minutes. There were no statistically significant differences between pulsatile and non-pulsatile groups with respect to plasma levels of glucose, insulin, glucagon, free fatty acids and ketone bodies. However, an increase in the plasma level of noradrenaline was significantly suppressed in the pulsatile group, and triglyceride levels were significantly higher in the pulsatile than in the non-pulsatile group. These data suggest that pulsatile flow attenuates the catecholamine stress response to cardiopulmonary bypass and has a protective effect on liver function during bypass.\r"

Twenty seven patients were hypertensive, and eight patients normotensive. Combined aorto-renal reconstruction was carried out prophylactically in eight instances. There were two operative deaths (5.7%). Factors found to be associated with an increased operative risk were advanced age (over 65 years), heart disease with ECG changes, severe hypertension and diabetes. Renal insufficiency with azothaemia and high levels of creatinine, represented a major risk factor. Post operatively, six individuals (24%) were classified as \"cured\" and thirteen (523) were \"improved\". Patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis, mild azothemia and moderately elevated creatinine, were found to improve significantly their renal function post operatively.

Using receiver operating characteristic curves, the diagnostic accuracy was found to be slightly reduced by the presence of significant contralateral disease. Hence, when interpreting the results of carotid Doppler examinations, the presence or absence of a hemodynamically significant contralateral stenosis should be considered in determining the likelihood that an ipsilateral stenosis is present and in evaluating its severity.\r"

Monolayer primary cultures of trophoblasts were established after mechanical and enzymatic dispersion of normal human term placenta. The cultured cells stained immunocytochemically positive with anti-GnRH serum, and GnRH-LI extracted from the cells eluted from high performance liquid chromatography with the same retention time as authentic GnRH. One week after plating, exposure to high concentrations of K+ or to various doses of veratridine, a Na+ ionophore, increased GnRH-LI release into the culture medium. This effect was reversed by Ca2+ antagonists (cobalt, EGTA, and verapamil). Dibutyrylcyclic AMP, forskolin, theophylline, and theobromine also increased GnRH-LI concentrations in the medium of cultured placental cells in a dose-related manner, as did prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha and epinephrine. The effect of epinephrine on GnRH-LI concentrations was mimicked by isoproterenol and reversed by propranolol, suggesting an effect mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors. These results indicate that GnRH-LI release from cultured human placental cells is stimulated by the opening of ionic channels and activation of the adenylate cyclase/cAMP system, and that prostaglandins and epinephrine may be involved in the regulation of GnRH-LI release from human placenta.\r"

  ".U": "88033577\r", 
  ".W": "Intranasal (in) GnRH spray caused induction and maintenance of spermatogenesis and biological paternity in a 28-yr-old man with Kallmann's syndrome. Prior treatment had included GnRH analog administration, which failed to induce puberty, and testosterone (T) enanthate weekly. Prior hCG/human menopausal gonadotropin therapy had resulted in high normal serum T levels and near-normal semen quality, but during subsequent hCG therapy, spermatogenesis markedly decreased. The patient had then received 250 mg T enanthate/month for 2 yr and 7 months; it was discontinued 7 weeks before the in GnRH study began. At its start (July 1984) the subject's testis size was 7 mL, and he had azoospermia, low serum LH and FSH levels, and a serum T of 74 ng/dL (2.6 nmol/L). GnRH was administered in a dose of 200 micrograms (20-120 ng/kg were absorbed into the circulation) every 2 h, seven to nine times a day, between 0700 and 2400 h for 242 days. After 12 days of treatment, serum T had increased to 519 ng/dL (18.0 nmol/L). After 70 days, the patient's sperm count was 11.5 million/mL (4.5 mL ejaculate volume; 70% motility; 36% normal morphology); on day 185, sperm count was 31 million/mL (4 mL ejaculate volume; 54% motility; 36% normal morphology). His spouse conceived on day 162 and delivered a fullterm daughter 265 days later. The probability of paternity was 99.9994%. Our results suggest that induction and maintenance of spermatogenesis as well as fertility in hypothalamic hypogonadism can be achieved with in GnRH therapy if pituitary and testicular function are intact. Spermatogenesis induced by in GnRH has the same quality as spermatogenesis induced by hCG/human menopausal gonadotropin therapy. Patient compliance is probably the most important factor for the success of in GnRH therapy.\r"

In a RIA using this antiserum, synthetic E peptide immunoreactivity was found in the serum of patients with chronic renal failure. The protein recognized by this antiserum has a mol wt of about 13,000 by neutral gel filtration and about 19,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting.

  ".W": "Insulin-induced hypoglycemia stimulates a rise of somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SLI) in the venous circulation of man. Plasma SLI is comprised of a heterogenous group of peptides including somatostatin-28 (SS-28) somatostatin-28-(15-28), somatostatin-28-(16-28), and prosomatostatin (Pro-SS). To determine which of these Pro-SS related peptides is released after hypoglycemia, we developed an immunoadsorption method that rapidly and accurately separates SS-28 from the other somatostatins. This method involves the selective retention of SS-28 on a conjugate of agarose with immunoglobulins that recognize an epitope in the NH2-terminal region of SS-28. Pro-SS, SS-28-(15-28), SS-28-(16-28), henceforth referred to collectively as SS-28-(15-28), and SS-28, once separated, were then analyzed by RIA with a COOH-terminal antibody. Ten normal men were studied after an overnight fast. Pork insulin (0.05 U/kg) was injected iv, and blood was collected before and after the onset of hypoglycemia. The mean basal SS-28-(15-28) level was 13 +/- 1 (+/- SEM) pg/mL, and the mean basal SS-28 levels were 19 +/- 3 (+/- SEM) pg/mL. Plasma SS-28-(15-28) did not increase after insulin administration, but the mean SS-28 level increased by 76% (P less than 0.01). We propose that the release of SS-28, presumably from the gastrointestinal tract, during hypoglycemia occurs as a result of activation of the autonomic nervous system and speculate that SS-28, because of its ability to inhibit insulin secretion, may be important in counterregulation during glucopenia.\r"

  ".W": "Short term treatment with GnRH agonists has been reported to increase plasma gonadotropin alpha-subunit (Gn alpha) levels while decreasing plasma immunoreactive LH (IR-LH) levels. In this study we examined the effect of D-Trp6-LHRH (LHRH-A) in microcapsules (60 micrograms/kg, im, every 28 days for 1 yr) in 13 girls suffering from precocious puberty. Plasma IR-Gn alpha was measured by RIA; plasma IR-LH and IR-FSH were measured by both polyclonal RIAs and monoclonal immunoradiometric assays (IRMA). Before treatment, basal IR-LH and IR-FSH levels and peak responses to LHRH measured by both RIA and IRMA were similar, and the Gn alpha response paralleled that of LH. After the first injection of LHRH-A, RIA LH levels were significantly higher than pretreatment levels until day 21, while IRMA LH levels transiently increased, but returned to pretreatment levels by day 7 and became lower thereafter (P less than 0.005). Plasma IR-Gn alpha levels increased from days 3-21 (P less than 0.05). After 1.5 months of treatment, basal RIA LH levels remained detectable and not different from pretreatment levels; IRMA LH levels were very low. The mean RIA and IRMA LH responses to LHRH were decreased at 1.5 and 12 months (P less than 0.01). Basal plasma RIA and IRMA FSH levels were similar during treatment (P greater than 0.05) and significantly lower than pretreatment values (P less than 0.01). The mean RIA and IRMA FSH responses to LHRH decreased significantly at 1.5 months (P less than 0.001). After 12 months, both RIA and IRMA FSH responses were increased, but IRMA values were significantly lower than RIA values. A sustained increase in basal Gn alpha values occurred, but there was a tendency for the peak levels after LHRH treatment to decrease, becoming significantly lower than pretreatment peak levels after 1 yr. The chromatographic analysis on Sephadex G-100 of a pool of plasma samples collected during a LHRH test in three children treated for 6 months indicated that IR-Gn alpha coeluted with [125I]Gn alpha. The large discrepancy between RIA and IRMA LH values suggests the secretion of unusual LH molecules which are recognized by RIA but not by IRMA. The sustained release of large amounts of IR-Gn alpha indicates dissociated effects of LHRH-A on alpha- and beta-subunit secretion by the gonadotrophs. The sustained response of Gn alpha to LHRH demonstrates that gonadotroph cell LHRH receptors are still responsive to LHRH during treatment with a LHRH agonist.\r"

Dukes' classification of rectal cancer was the outcome of this dual approach. It evolved over many years, and full details of its final form were not published until 1958, towards the end of his career. Others modified the classification during its evolution, and numerous rival pathological and clinicopathological systems now exist. The resulting confusion that surrounds the Dukes classification may make it impossible to compare pathological findings and the results of treatment between different centres. The importance of meticulous dissection and examination of surgical specimens is emphasised and a simple set of recommendations made. It is shown how modern statistical methods may identify pathological variables that have independent clinical importance. On the basis of this information a new system of prognostic categorisation for patients receiving apparently curative surgery for rectal cancer has been developed, which is superior to the Dukes classification in that it can place many more patients into groups with clear prognostic implications.\r"

Examples include the diagnosis of tumours the true nature of which is uncertain because of anaplasia or poor morphological preservation; the demonstration of small numbers of cells which are otherwise too rare to be recognised in conventionally stained preparations; and the immunophenotyping of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Recently progress has been made in the context of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas by the development of monoclonal antibodies that detect T and B cell associated markers in paraffin wax sections. Most of these reagents, however, recognise either lineage associated (but not lineage specific) variants of the leucocyte common antigen CD45, or antigens that are poorly characterised. A recent promising development has therefore been the demonstration that polyclonal antisera raised against the CD3/T3 T cell specific marker (purified by affinity chromatography) are suitable for staining T cells in paraffin sections. This approach will hopefully enable antibodies to be produced which react with other well defined white cell associated markers in routine biopsy material.\r"

  ".W": "In recent years cellular homologues of many viral oncogenes have been identified. As these genes are partially homologous to viral oncogenes and are activated in some tumour cell lines they are termed \"proto-oncogenes\". In tumour cell lines proto-oncogenes are activated by either quantitative or qualitative changes in gene structure: activation of these genes was originally thought to be a necessary primary event in carcinogenesis, but activated cellular oncogenes, unlike viral oncogenes, do not transform normal cells in culture. In experimental models cooperation between two oncogenes can induce transformation of early passage cells, and this has become the basis of an hypothesis for multistep carcinogenesis. Proto-oncogene products also show sequence homology to various components in the mitogenic pathway (growth factors, growth factor receptors, signal transducing proteins and nuclear proteins), and it has been postulated that they may cause deregulation of the various components of this pathway. In human tumours single or multiple oncogene activation occurs. The pattern of oncogene activation in common solid malignancies is not consistent within any one class of tumour, nor is it uniform between classes, with three exceptions. In neuroblastoma, breast cancer, and perhaps in lung cancer there is relatively consistent activation of N-myc, neu, and c-myc/N-myc, respectively. Amplification of these genes generally correlates with poor prognosis. The introduction of methods for the direct study of oncogene transcription and their products will undoubtedly broaden our vision of cancer biology in man and, hopefully, add diagnostic and prognostic precision to tumour typing.\r"

  ".W": "A new rapid automated method for the identification and classification of microorganisms is described. It is based on the incorporation of 35S-methionine into cellular proteins and subsequent separation of the radiolabelled proteins by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The protein patterns produced were species specific and reproducible, permitting discrimination between the species. A large number of Gram negative and Gram positive aerobic and anaerobic organisms were successfully tested. Furthermore, there were sufficient differences within species between the protein profiles to permit subdivision of the species. New typing schemes for Clostridium difficile, coagulase negative staphylococci, and Staphylococcus aureus, including the methicillin resistant strains, could thus be introduced; this has provided the basis for useful epidemiological studies. To standardise and automate the procedure an automated electrophoresis system and a two dimensional scanner were developed to scan the dried gels directly. The scanner is operated by a computer which also stores and analyses the scan data. Specific histograms are produced for each bacterial species. Pattern recognition software is used to construct databases and to compare data obtained from different gels: in this way duplicate \"unknowns\" can be identified. Specific small areas showing differences between various histograms can also be isolated and expanded to maximise the differences, thus providing differentiation between closely related bacterial species and the identification of differences within the species to provide new typing schemes. This system should be widely applied in clinical microbiology laboratories in the near future.\r"

  ".W": "John Hunter suggested that the body's responses to injury were defensive and had survival value. Now, many years later, we are still uncertain about this. Although our appreciation of the endocrine and metabolic responses to injury, both physical and bacterial, has increased enormously our knowledge of these events, particularly at a molecular level, is still very incomplete. Patterns have been identified, however, in the sphere of energy metabolism, and this provides a basis for interpreting at least some of the biochemical responses to injury. The views developed support the idea that the responses are defensive--initially against the impact of the injury and then to meet the demands of the new \"organ\" which the wounds or septic focus seem to have added to the body. A reason for wanting to interpret these responses is to improve patient care. Current interpretations at least help to clarify our view of what is happening in the injured or septic patient and sometimes indicate lines of treatment. Nevertheless, many serious problems, particularly changes in protein metabolism, remain to be solved before we can advise on the metabolic care of patients at all stages from accident to recovery.\r"

There is a clinical need, however, for an acceptable definition of action limits and desirable ranges, based on the evidence that raised cholesterol concentrations are causally related to atherosclerotic heart disease. The European Atherosclerosis Society has proposed a set of cut off points, which, together with age and the presence of other risk factors, direct the clinician to an appropriate level of treatment. Because the changes of serum cholesterol during adult life appear unphysiological, these action limits do not require adjustment for age. The distribution of serum cholesterol in the United Kingdom population is such that a case finding strategy is required to identify the many persons at very high risk of coronary disease. Measurements of triglyceride, high density lipoprotein, apolipoproteins, and the investigation of hyperlipoproteinemia are informative but less mandatory.\r"

The HLA system has its counterparts in other species of mammals, birds, and reptiles including the much studied H2 system of the mouse. The HLA system started from a series of antigens defined by a combination of relatively crude serology and genetics, supported by extensive statistical analysis. It has turned out to be a complex genetic region determining two major sets of cell surface products which mediate essential functional interactions between cells of the immune system, and so have a major role in the control of the immune response. Polymorphism in the HLA region is thus associated with a wide variety of diseases with an immune aetiology.\r"

Remission is achieved when the administration of cytotoxic drugs eradicates the bulk of the leukaemic population while sparing normal haemopoiesis. The mechanism by which chemotherapy seems to act in this selective manner is essentially unknown. Nevertheless, remission rates of 80-95% can be achieved in children and in 50-80% of adults with acute leukaemia. Attempts to cure patients in remission may entail either \"continuing curative chemotherapy\" or \"supralethal\" doses of chemoradiotherapy followed by autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The relative merits of these different methods remain highly controversial but chemotherapy is usually the preferred method of continuing treatment for children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in first remission; and allogeneic transplantation is recommended for younger adults with acute myeloid leukaemia who have suitable HLA-identical sibling donors. The role of autografting is still experimental. Patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia can achieve long term remission and probably cure following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation but the resultant risks of mortality are still appreciable. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia currently remains incurable.\r"

This classification, based mainly on cytological criteria, divides the peripheral T cell lymphomas into tumours of low grade and high grade malignancy. Adult T cell lymphoma/leukaemia (ATLL) is caused by HTLV-1 and belongs chiefly to the high grade category. Some tumours are characterised by an admixture of other cells (epithelioid cells, follicular dendritic cells, etc) and structures (high endothelial venules, follicles), which may indicate the secretion of lymphokines by the tumour cells. Clear cells seem to be specific for T cell lymphomas and may occur in various types of peripheral T cell lymphoma.\r"

Diphenylcyclopropenone is used in the treatment of alopecia areata and is nonmutagenic in a limited Ames assay. We examined diphenylcyclopropenone and diphenylacetylene, as well as synthetic precursors of diphenylcyclopropenone--dibenzylketone and alpha,alpha'-dibromodibenzylketone--for mutagenicity against TA100, TA98, TA102, UTH8413, and UTH8414. All compounds were nonmutagenic except alpha,alpha'-dibromodibenzylketone, which was a potent mutagen in TA100 with and without S-9 activation. The effect of photochemical activation of diphenylcyclopropenone in the presence of bacteria demonstrated mutagenicity in UTH8413 (two times background) at 10 micrograms/plate with S-9 microsomal activation. 8-Methoxypsoralen produces a mutagenic response in TA102 at 0.1 microgram/plate with 60 seconds of exposure to 350 nm light. In vitro photochemically activated Ames assay with S-9 microsomal fraction may enhance the trapping of short-lived photochemically produced high-energy mutagenic intermediates. This technique offers exciting opportunities to trap high-energy intermediates that may play an important role in mutagenesis. This method can be applied to a variety of topically applied dermatologic agents, potentially subjected to photochemical changes in normal use.\r"

Despite this evidence that dermatitis herpetiformis is a genetic disease, reports of the familial occurrence of dermatitis herpetiformis are rare. We have obtained family histories from 92 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis with 740 first-degree relatives. Six of these relatives have dermatitis herpetiformis. Comparison of these data with the expected prevalence of dermatitis herpetiformis shows this incidence to be highly significant (p less than 0.0001), strongly suggesting that dermatitis herpetiformis is a familial disease, presumably because of shared genetic factors but possibly because of a shared environment.\r"

It seems, however, to be relatively common in Europe. Between 1981 and 1985 we examined twelve patients, and a number of case reports have been published in French and German literature. We describe ten typical cases and review the literature. The disease is characterized by massive symmetric fat deposits predominantly in the neck and shoulder girdle area. Pathogenetically, the increase in fatty tissue is assumed to result from a localized defect in catecholamine-induced lipolysis. The disease is frequently associated with alcoholism, hepatopathy, glucose intolerance, hyperuricemia, and malignant tumors of the upper airways, requiring thorough clinical evaluation of all patients. Dietary treatment and weight loss are of limited value in the management of benign symmetric lipomatosis. Surgical removal of lipomatous tissue is frequently followed by recurrence and should be restricted to decompression in patients with functional impairment.\r"

In 14 cases, atypical melanocytes were identified, most often in the papillary dermis. The mean depth of invasion in this group was 0.23 mm with a range of 0.10 mm to 0.75 mm. In these cases, atypical cells were difficult if not impossible to identify in routinely processed sections, either because the invasive cell was a spindle cell variant and indistinguishable from a fibrohistiocytic cell, because the invasive cells were occasionally solitary or in small groups, or because there was an inflammatory infiltrate that obscured the tumor cells. Recent studies of lentigo maligna melanoma have revealed no better prognosis when compared to that of other forms of malignant melanoma after normalization for depth and body location. We therefore advocate close examination of lentigo maligna with the use of appropriate immunohistochemical techniques if there are areas of dermal fibrosis or inflammation that might obscure invasion.\r"

Complete follow-up is available on all patients. The ventricular septal defect narrowed in only 1 of 36 patients with combined transposition of the great arteries and ventricular septal defect; pulmonary stenosis developed or worsened in 3 of these 36 patients and in 3 of the 187 patients with simple transposition. Twelve month overall survival among the 245 patients was 80%. No morphologic feature of transposition was a risk factor for death but major associated cardiac and noncardiac anomalies (more common in patients with combined transposition and ventricular septal defect) and low birth weight were risk factors. Neither arterial switch repair (n = 86), atrial switch (Mustard) repair (n = 21) nor atrial switch (Senning) repair (n = 39) was a risk factor for death, but results in all surgical groups were better in the last part of the experience. Death before repair was less frequent late in the study. Possibly, in low birth weight infants, survival was better with the arterial than with the atrial switch repair. These data suggest that survival at 1 year is similar with either the arterial or the atrial switch repair. The early results of repair of combined transposition of the great arteries and ventricular septal defect are as good as those of simple transposition. Special institutional efforts are required to attain good results with the arterial switch repair and to prevent death before repair.\r"

Myocardial contractility was quantitated with load-independent indexes using the end-systolic pressure-dimension relation (Emax) and the relation of rate-corrected velocity of shortening to end-systolic wall stress. Myocardial loading status was determined by the direct measurement of afterload (end-systolic wall stress) and the functional quantitation of preload (differences between the relation of fractional shortening and velocity of shortening to end-systolic stress). Most patients (55%) were found to have abnormal ejection phase indexes of ventricular function either before or after entry into dialysis. However, contractility was normal in all subjects at each of their evaluations, and no change in contractility was found after dialysis or transplantation. Loading status was highly variable and usually abnormal before transplantation and accounted entirely for the abnormalities of fractional shortening and velocity of shortening. Transplantation invariably resulted in normalization of loading status and ejection phase indexes of ventricular function. In these children and young adults with uremia, abnormal ejection phase indexes of ventricular function were frequent and caused by associated abnormalities in ventricular loading. Contractility, however, was normal and no evidence of a uremia-associated myocardial depressant was found.\r"

  ".W": "Digital subtraction angiography provides the potential to determine aortic regurgitant fraction by computer analysis of time-intensity curves generated from regions of interest positioned over the aorta and left ventricle after aortography. To validate this ability, we studied six dogs instrumented with an electromagnetic flow probe on the ascending aorta. Aortic regurgitation of varying severity was produced by a basket catheter introduced through the right carotid artery. Aortograms were performed using continuous fluoroscopy at 30 frames/s and stored in digital format in a 256 x 256 pixel matrix. An image-processing computer was utilized to plot summated pixel intensity versus time for both the aortic and the left ventricular regions of interest. Regurgitant fraction was calculated from the time-intensity curves using an algorithm analogous to that employed by dye-dilution methods. Regurgitant fraction determined from digital angiography was compared with that obtained by electromagnetic flow and was found to correlate well (r = 0.94, SEE = 7.4%) over a wide range of values. Thus, these data indicate that aortic regurgitant fraction can be accurately determined from computer analysis of digitally acquired aortograms in an animal model of acute aortic regurgitation.\r"

Similarly, the fiber length during a contraction, which is determined in part by the load encountered during shortening, also determines the extent of myofilament Ca2+ activation. Thus, \"contractile\" or \"inotropic\" state as it refers to the extent of myofilament activation can, in theory, no longer be considered independent of the muscle length, as was formerly thought to be the case. Accordingly, terms such as preload, afterload and myocardial contractile state as they pertain to cardiac muscle properties lose part of their significance in light of current knowledge.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the prognostic implications of an early peak in plasma MB creatine kinase (MB CK) in patients with acute myocardial infarction who were not treated with an acute intervention, 342 patients with myocardial infarction confirmed by MB CK were retrospectively studied. The patients were classified into those with an early peak MB CK (less than or equal to 15 hours after the onset of symptoms, n = 84) and those with a late peak MB CK (greater than 15 hours after the onset of symptoms, n = 258). Patients with an early peak MB CK were slightly older, were more frequently female and had a higher incidence of prior myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure and arrhythmias compared with patients with a late peak MB CK. Patients with an early peak MB CK more frequently presented with ST segment depression (23 versus 11%, p less than 0.01), with anterior location of ischemia or infarction (71 versus 52%, p less than 0.01) and with a lower mean left ventricular ejection fraction (41.4 versus 47.4%, p less than 0.01). Despite more extensive left ventricular dysfunction at initial presentation, patients with an early peak MB CK had a smaller mean MB CK infarct size index (12.6 versus 18.9 g-Eq/m2, p less than 0.01), with no difference in the incidence of in-hospital complications, including death. The early left ventricular dysfunction improved in the patients with an early peak MB CK, evidenced by a 4.5% increase in ejection fraction from admission to 10 days after infarction, whereas the ejection fraction did not improve in patients with a late peak MB CK. However, the patients with an early peaking MB CK had myocardium in jeopardy as reflected by a higher incidence of ST segment depression and a decrement in the global left ventricular ejection fraction with exercise. The 4 year life table estimate for the rate of recurrent myocardial infarction after hospital discharge was higher in patients with an early peak MB CK (33 versus 22%, p less than 0.05), with an even more striking difference in the 4 year estimate for the rate of fatal recurrent infarction (20 versus 8%, p less than 0.001). The 4 year mortality estimate was markedly higher in hospital survivors with an early peak MB CK than in those with a late peak (47 versus 19%, p less than 0.0001) and, even after adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics, the residual excess mortality in those with an early peak was still significant (p less than 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex (APSAC) was developed as a second generation thrombolytic agent in an attempt to overcome some of the limitations to the intravenous application of streptokinase for coronary artery thrombolysis. Temporary protection of the active site on the plasminogen molecule by acylation allows APSAC to be given by rapid injection, confers semiselectivity for clot (at lower doses) and prolonged fibrinolytic action. These properties may simplify intravenous administration, improve coronary reperfusion response and reduce reocclusion potential. Clinical trials with APSAC, still ongoing, allow the following tentative conclusions: the efficacy of intravenous APSAC appears to be equivalent to that of intracoronary streptokinase, when given within 4 hours of the onset of symptoms of myocardial infarction, and superior to that of intravenous streptokinase, but it is easier to administer. Early APSAC therapy leads to reperfusion rates of 60 to 65% and patency rates of 70 to 80%. Early reocclusion rates (within 24 hours) appear to be as low as or lower than those obtained with other agents. Bleeding complications and allergic manifestations after APSAC are acceptably low and comparable with those of equivalent doses of streptokinase. The potential for mortality benefit after APSAC appears to be high and is undergoing additional study. Thus, APSAC therapy, which can be given by simple injection over 2 to 5 minutes, appears promising as a future first line approach to reperfusion therapy in acute myocardial infarction.\r"

Trials carried out before 1980 failed to recognize the relations between early coronary reperfusion and myocardial salvage and therefore have not been included in this review. Seven studies on intracoronary streptokinase have been reviewed. The two largest of these studies, the Western Washington trial and the Netherlands trial, show a similar reduction in early mortality. Two other small studies demonstrated a trend toward a reduction in mortality with streptokinase therapy and the other three did not. One small and two large intravenous streptokinase trials are reviewed. Of these, the large GISSI trial in Italy demonstrated a 23% reduction in mortality in patients treated within 3 hours from the onset of symptoms and the Intracoronary Streptokinase in Acute Myocardial Infarction (ISAM) trial showed a similar trend toward reduced mortality. The small Western Washington trial showed an even greater trend toward reduced mortality but this benefit was limited to patients with anterior myocardial infarction who received early therapy. It is concluded that intracoronary and intravenous streptokinase therapy, when initiated within the first 6 hours of acute myocardial infarction, reduces mortality. The therapy is most beneficial for those patients with anterior myocardial infarction and those who can receive therapy within the first 2 to 3 hours from the onset of symptoms.\r"

The mortality at 1 year was determined in 98.3% of the patients who had been originally randomized; the 1 year mortality of patients discharged alive was similar in those patients treated with streptokinase and those who were not; that is, the beneficial effects of streptokinase treatment on survival that were observed in the hospital phase of the study persisted unchanged and with comparable statistical significance for 1 year. However, a higher incidence of reinfarction occurred in the treated versus the control groups both during the hospital phase and at the 6 month follow-up. Streptokinase treatment had no detectable effect in patients with a history of previous infarction.\r"

The subjects received an additive-free diet for 5 days before challenge and were challenged in hospital, after an overnight fast, with 500 mg capsules of MSG. They were challenged in a single-blind, placebo-controlled fashion with increasing doses of MSG from 0.5 gm to 5.0 gm. Thirteen subjects reacted. Seven subjects (group 1) developed asthma and symptoms of the Chinese restaurant syndrome 1 to 2 hours after ingestion of MSG. Six subjects (group 2) did not develop symptoms of Chinese restaurant syndrome, and their asthma developed 6 to 12 hours after ingestion of MSG. These challenge studies confirm that MSG can provoke asthma. The reaction to MSG is dose dependent and may be delayed up to 12 hours, making recognition difficult for both patient and physician.\r"

The mean age in each of the four groups ranged from 31.9 to 34.1 years. No significant differences were found in the ratings of perceived salt intensity among patients and control subjects. On the basis of 3-day food records plus recall of seasonings used, mean intake of sodium was estimated to be higher in CAPD patients and control subjects than in HD and transplant patients (p less than 0.02). Patients on CAPD stated a preference for salty items, whereas control subjects preferred the less salty items despite similar estimated sodium intakes. It thus appears that the ability to perceive various salt tastes may not be impaired in patients on renal replacement therapy. In addition, inappropriate salt intake commonly seen in those patients may be due to increased salt appetite, specifically in those patients managed by CAPD.\r"

Age-related taste alterations are controversial, but there is consensus on an olfactory decline with age. Much of the age-related chemoreceptive research has used inappropriate methodology, thus leaving many findings inconclusive. Changes in the taste system with age may be related to nutrient intake, which in turn can be influenced by taste. Literature on such interrelationships is limited. Vitamins A, thiamin, B-6, B-12, folacin, zinc, and copper are thought to influence taste function. Moreover, those nutrients are of concern in the aged. The use of appropriate methodology is critical not only for the sensory but also for the nutritional aspects, particularly for qualitative and quantitative assessments of nutrient intakes. This review considers the experimental deficiencies (small sample size, inappropriate age range, inadequate psychophysical and stimuli presentation procedures, and poor dietary intake assessment) of studies reported in the literature and suggests major needs for research.\r"

  ".W": "Succinylacetone is a seven-carbon organic ketoacid that we have previously shown to inhibit tumor allograft rejection as well as the primary antibody response to sheep erythrocytes in rats. Because it appeared to be such a potent immunosuppressive agent in our initial studies, we evaluated succinylacetone for its ability to block graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) in adult F1 rats injected with parental strain spleen cells. Untreated ACE X Lewis F1 rats given Lewis strain spleen cells died of GVHD, with a mean survival of 24 days. By contrast, 62% of F1 rats in the group treated with succinylacetone survived, and the deaths that occurred in this group occurred significantly later. To confirm this observation and determine whether succinylacetone would interfere with bone marrow engraftment, lethally irradiated adult Wistar-Furth rats were reconstituted with syngeneic or totally allogeneic Fisher 344 lymphohemopoietic cells consisting of equal numbers of bone marrow and spleen cells. All animals given allogeneic cells without additional immunosuppressive treatment developed severe GVHD and died by day 42. By contrast 92% of the allogeneic cell recipients that had been treated with succinylacetone were long term survivors. Cytotoxicity typing of peripheral lymphocytes demonstrated greater than 90% donor-type lymphocytes persisting in the succinylacetone-treated recipients as long as 255 days post-transplantation. No chronic or late developing acute GVHD was observed even though the animals received succinylacetone as the sole immunosuppressant for only 28 days after transplantation. Furthermore, hemopoietic reconstitution in recipients of syngeneic cells was essentially identical between the control group and the group treated with succinylacetone. In addition, no gross or histologic evidence for renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, endocrine, or neurologic toxicity was observed in the long term transplant survivors treated with succinylacetone. These data indicate that succinylacetone treatment is effective in preventing lethal GVHD in this allogeneic bone marrow transplantation system while permitting normal hemopoietic reconstitution in the absence of significant chronic toxicity to other major organ systems.\r"

Both sheep and rabbit anti-rat brush border vesicle IgG-induced complement-dependent lysis of cultured GEC. Fab fragments of sheep anti-rat brush border vesicles and polyclonal or monoclonal gp330 IgG were devoid of lytic activity. Shedding of cell-surface antigens induced by sheep or rabbit anti-rat brush border vesicle IgG protected GEC from subsequent exposure to lytic antibodies and complement, an effect that was not obtained with Fab fragments. When GEC were incubated with sheep or rabbit anti-rat brush border vesicle IgG in capping conditions, the C3 component was co-redistributed with Heymann immune complexes; in contrast, the MAC remained diffusely bound to the cell surface, indicating that it was not associated with the antigen-antibody complexes. The MAC was demonstrated on the surface of GEC by immunofluorescence staining with anti-MAC neoantigen and by electron microscopy of negatively stained membranes showing focal clusters of 110 A MAC lesions. When GEC were treated with sheep IgG or rabbit IgG plus C6-deficient sera, the cells were not lysed and MAC was not demonstrable on the surface; however, lytic activity was restored when C6-deficient sera were reconstituted with purified C6. The results are consistent with the interpretation that injury induced by Heymann antibodies on GEC is MAC-dependent.\r"

Limited digestion of PCNA/cyclin with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease resulted in several peptide fragments. Five fragments of 30, 20, 15, 14, and 13 kDa were reactive with rabbit anti-NH2-terminal peptide antibody denoting that they contained the NH2-terminal peptide. The 30- and 20-kDa fragments reacted with 19A2 but the others did not. Lupus sera reacted with 17- and 15-kDa peptide fragments allowing their classification into three groups. Two of eight sera (type A) reacted only with the 17-kDa fragment. Two others (type B) reacted with both the 17- and 15-kDa fragments and the remaining four sera (type C) reacted only with the 15-kDa fragment. The sera reacting with the 15-kDa fragment also reacted with the 20-kDa fragment, but the sera reactive only with the 17-kDa fragment did not, indicating that the 17-kDa fragment was not a degradation product of 20-kDa fragments. The 19A2 epitope resided in the region between 15 and 20 kDa from the NH2 terminus, whereas there was at least one distinct epitope on each 15- and 17-kDa peptide, which were recognized by lupus autoantibodies.\r"

Here we show that, in response to viral infection or after treatment with poly(rI).poly(rC), L cells produce a factor that is capable of supporting the in vitro growth and survival of HP1-dependent cell lines. Serologic and structural evidence is presented in favor of the identity between the fibroblast factor and HP1, demonstrating that non-T cells can make HP1-related molecules.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was undertaken to elucidate whether B cell lymphoma and hybridoma cell lines can be stimulated by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or by antibodies against immunoglobulin M (IgM) to produce granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). GM-CSF activity was assayed on the basophil/mast cell line PT-18 which is GM-CSF- and interleukin 3-dependent. Antibodies against murine recombinant GM-CSF were used to identify the colony-stimulating factor activity present in the supernatants of the stimulated B cell lines. When these cell lines were stimulated with LPS, two of five lymphoma and five of six hybridoma lines produced GM-CSF. Two cell lines, the B cell lymphoma M12.4.1 and the hybridoma TH2.2, were analyzed more extensively under serum-free conditions. In these two cell lines, the production of GM-CSF was dependent on the dose of LPS used and time of exposure. Antibodies against IgM stimulated the TH2.2 (IgM+) but not the M12.4.1 (IgM-) cells to produce GM-CSF. Northern blot analysis of the M12.4.1 and TH2.2 cells showed that mRNA of GM-CSF can be detected in LPS-stimulated but not in unstimulated cells. Our data show that transformed B cells can be stimulated to produce GM-CSF. The present data and previous studies on GM-CSF production by normal bone marrow-derived B cells suggest a possible participation of B cells in granulopoiesis.\r"

  ".U": "88034386\r", 
  ".W": "The subunit structure of C8 is unusual in that it consists of a disulfide-linked alpha-gamma-dimer and a non-covalently associated beta-chain. To gain insight into the biosynthesis and assembly of C8, we examined its production by short term cultures of rat hepatocytes. Synthesis was detected by functional assays as well as immunologically with antisera against C8, alpha-gamma or beta. Control experiments showed that all three antisera were capable of precipitating C8 from rat serum. When antiserum against C8 was used to analyze hepatocyte cell lysates, precursor as well as mature forms of alpha-gamma and beta were detected. Precursor-product relationships were confirmed by pulse-chase experiments, which also revealed a significantly faster rate of synthesis for alpha-gamma. Importantly, no single chain form of alpha-gamma was detected in the intracellular pool. Evidence that C8 is assembled before secretion was provided by analyzing cell lysates with antiserum specific for alpha-gamma or beta. Precipitation of both subunits with either antiserum confirmed they were associated. Parallel analyses of the extracellular pool revealed that alpha-gamma and beta remain associated in the media but that excess alpha-gamma is secreted as a consequence of a faster synthesis rate. These results provide evidence for differential expression of alpha-gamma and beta and are consistent with the existence of different loci for these subunits. Furthermore, they indicate that association of alpha-gamma with beta is a presecretory event in normal C8 synthesis.\r"

SP and anti-SP receptor binding to [35S]methionine-labeled IM-9 cell proteins were directly compared by attachment of each to affinity supports. Eluants from these affinity columns were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and revealed an equivalent 33-kDa protein in both cases. This protein corresponds to one of the previously described [125I]SP specifically affinity-labeled membrane-associated proteins. In addition, two-color fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis with human peripheral blood T lymphocytes with fluorescein-SP and rhodamine-labeled antireceptor antibody revealed a distinct population of cells (20 to 30%) that were equally labeled by both the fluorescent peptide and antibody. This result indicates that the anti-SP receptor antibody recognizes an epitope of the receptor that is common to both human peripheral blood T lymphocytes and IM-9 lymphoblast cells.\r"

  ".W": "A monoclonal antibody, 3F12, was generated which reacted specifically against infective or metacyclic stage Leishmania major promastigotes, but not with noninfective promastigotes obtained from log phase cultures. The antibody recognized a cell surface and released molecule that could be metabolically labeled with [14C]glucose, [3H]mannose, [3H]galactose, and [3H]palmitic acid, but not with [35S]methionine or [3H]leucine. The molecule was the major species surface-labeled by [3H]sodium borohydride after periodate treatment. The glycolipid appeared to be shed primarily as free carbohydrate because 70% of the released material partitioned in the aqueous fraction after phase separation in TX-114. The molecule could be distinguished from the L. major glycolipid which has already been extensively described because its migration on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was of higher relative m.w. However, a close relationship between the two molecules was indicated by the finding that another monoclonal antibody, WIC-79.3, recognized both forms of the glycolipid; one produced and released only by log phase promastigotes, and one produced and released only by metacyclic promastigotes. The loss of agglutination with peanut agglutinin which has been shown to accompany metacyclogenesis was found to be caused by the loss of expression of the log form of the glycolipid which in most cases appeared to be the result of the developmental modification of this molecule. A survey of a number of virulent and avirulent. L. major strains and clones reinforced an absolute association between the ability of these promastigotes to initiate infection in BALB/c mice and their expression and release of the 3F12-binding, developmentally regulated form of the glycolipid. Not only does this glycolipid serve as the first well defined molecular marker for infective stage metacyclic promastigotes, but its unique structure is very likely to contribute to the adaptive changes that allow these parasites to survive within the vertebrate host.\r"

However, such protection could be totally suppressed by prior s.c. injection with the same antigens. Both the protective immunity and the inhibition of its induction could be adoptively transferred with specific Lyt-2- T cells. Here, we present evidence showing that protection and disease promotion resulting from i.v. or s.c. immunization, respectively, are mediated by functionally distinct subsets of T cells. In a series of titration experiments, it was found that freshly isolated T cells derived from prophylactically i.v. immunized BALB/c mice were either protective (greater than 10(7) cells/recipient) or ineffective (less than 10(7) cells/recipient). No exacerbation of disease was observed at any dose. Conversely, T cells from mice immunized s.c. either accelerated disease development and inhibited protective immunization (greater than 10(7) cells/recipient) or had no effect (less than 10(7) cells/recipient). No protection was observed at any dose tested. In mixed transfer experiments, increasing numbers of T cells from s.c. immunized donors progressively inhibited the protective effect of T cells from i.v. immunized donors. Supernatant of T cell cultures from protectively immunized donors contained substantial macrophage-activating factor whereas such activity was not detectable in the supernatant of T cell culture from s.c. immunized donors. Analysis by flow cytometry showed that the spleen and lymph nodes of normal, i.v., or s.c. immunized BALB/c mice contained similar ratios of L3T4+ cells and Lyt-2+ cells.\r"

A comparison with the murine beta 2m gene reveals that exon/intron boundaries are absolutely conserved. In the protein-coding regions the similarity is 70%. As far as intron sequences of the murine beta 2m gene are available, no significant similarity between human and murine genes is observed. The transcriptional start site of the human beta 2m gene was determined by S1 mapping, and comparison with the nearly full length cDNA clone now defines the transcriptional unit of the beta 2m gene. In the 5' region of the gene strong clustering of the usually underrepresented CpG dinucleotide is found resembling a similar overrepresentation in the 5' regions of the major histocompatibility complex class I genes.\r"

Bovine muzzle epidermis was sliced horizontally into 6 layers, 0.2 mm thick, and desmosomes were isolated from each layer. These were then analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The electrophoretic patterns of desmosomal proteins from the 6 layers were found to be qualitatively similar to each other, but there was an increase in the ratio of the amount of 150 kD glycoprotein (desmoglein I) relative to 240 and 210 kD proteins (desmoplakins) in the upper layers of the epidermis. This finding was supported by the similar increase observed in electrophoretic patterns of proteins extracted directly from each layer of the epidermis in electrophoretic sample buffer. In order to study the fate of desmosomal components in the stratum corneum, serial skin surface biopsies were stained with antisera against desmosomal components using indirect immunofluorescence techniques. This experiment showed that desmosomal proteins and glycoproteins persist in the stratum corneum but quantitatively decrease in the outer layers. This decrease may play a significant role in desquamation.\r"

This protein was purified in two steps; first, through preparative isoelectric focusing, and, second, by affinity column chromatography bound with the specific, monoclonal antibody to keratohyalin granules (Ted-H-1). In sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the purified HSP consisted of two proteins (70 and 62 kilodaltons [kd]), but only the 62-kd protein was detected in the 15,000 g supernatant fraction of the extract using the immunoblotting technique. The amino acid composition of the purified HSP included 30% glycine, 15% serine, 12% glutamic acid, and 4% ornithine, but only 2.3% histidine. Using the indirect immunofluorescent technique, observation showed that the monoclonal antibody, Ted-H-1, to the HSP, formed as a result of the partially purified antigen, was located in three places: 1) the keratohyalin granules; 2) in the cell membrane region of the lower part of the stratum corneum of the skin samples (forearm, cheek, and back); and 3) the keratohyalin granules in the follicular epithelium and on the trichohyalin granules. Reaction product was not seen in either the acrosyringium or in the plantar epidermis. As two positively reacted proteins with the Ted-H-1 were detected in the Tris-HCl extract from the plantar stratum corneum by the immunoblotting assay, however, the above negative result in the indirect immunofluorescent studies may be due to the masking of the antigenic site of keratohyalin granules in vivo. This hematoxylin-stainable protein was synthesized as one component of the keratohyalin granules in the stratum granulosum and may have been transferred to the stratum corneum cell membrane region.\r"

  ".W": "We have suggested that the renal tubular signal for renin release is related to alterations of sodium chloride cotransport in the TALH. Renin release is inhibited by increased sodium chloride transport and stimulated by interrupted sodium chloride transport. Because of the different affinities of the carriers for sodium and chloride, chloride rather than sodium is rate limiting for this cotransport process. Consequently, renin release is related to alterations of chloride delivery rather than sodium delivery to the TALH. The reduction of PRA by selective chloride loading and by short-term infusion of chloride salts is related to increased chloride delivery to the loop and hence increased chloride transport. Alternatively, chlorpropamide and antidiuretic hormone may inhibit renin release by increasing chloride delivery to the loop. Stimulation of renin release may likewise be related either to decreased chloride delivery and hence decreased transport in the loop (hypochloremia related to selective chloride deprivation) or to an intrinsic alteration in the transporting capacity of the loop (loop diuretics, potassium depletion, glucocorticoid deficiency, Bartter's syndrome). The intermediate steps between alterations of sodium chloride transport in the TALH and renin release remain to be defined.\r"

Inhibition of fibronectin gelatin-binding activity was identified and quantitated by using latex-fibronectin particles in combination with latex-gelatin particles in a new competitive aggregation assay. Inhibition was expressed as the reciprocal of the dilution of test sample required to produce a 50% return of baseline control aggregation rate (inhibitor units). Serum and plasma from healthy donors (n = 60) showed similar reductions in fibronectin gelatin-binding activity (47.9 +/- 12.9 and 49.4 +/- 12.7 inhibitor units per milliliter, respectively). However, serum fibronectin gelatin-binding activity per milligram of fibronectin was significantly less than that of plasma. The addition of calcium chloride to platelet-rich plasma resulted in a similar reduction in fibronectin gelatin-binding activity per milligram of fibronectin. No change was observed after recalcification of platelet-poor plasma. Washed platelets (1 X 10(9)/ml) in Tris HCl buffer released 18 +/- 8 fibronectin inhibitor units per milliliter after calcium ionophore A23187 addition. When inhibitor-rich preparations from platelets and plasma were chromatographed on Sepharose CL-6B, the inhibitors eluted at the same location. Inhibitor-rich eluates from both sources bound to heparin-Sepharose and eluted with 0.45 mol/L NaCl. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified inhibitor preparations demonstrated a major protein band with an approximate molecular weight of 185 kd. Western blot analyses using antiplatelet thrombospondin identified the platelet-derived inhibitor as thrombospondin but failed to react with the plasma-derived inhibitor. These data demonstrated that platelet-released thrombospondin was responsible for the reduction in fibronectin gelatin-binding activity seen in serum. An unidentified plasma factor also inhibits fibronectin gelatin binding.\r"

We have shown that these normal de-endothelialized vessel segments do not contain von Willebrand factor (vWF) in the subendothelial surface; thus, the vascular model that we are using here is representative of the conditions in severe von Willebrand's disease. The blood was recirculated for selected periods of time through an extracorporeal circuit (carotid-jugular shunt), containing a tubular perfusion chamber that held the vessel segment. Flow rates and chamber diameters were selected such that the wall shear rates at the vascular segment were 212 to 3380 sec-1. Platelets were labeled with indium 111 and their total deposition determined by a gamma counter; selected areas were also observed by electron microscopy. When native blood was perfused, the deposition of platelets depended on platelet-plasma vWF only at high wall shear rates (1690 sec-1 or greater) typical of the microcirculation, but not at the lower shear rates (212 and 424 sec-1), more characteristic of the larger arteries and veins. In contrast, when heparinized blood was perfused, platelet deposition on the vascular segments depended on the presence of vWF over the entire range of shear conditions studied. These findings demonstrate in an extracorporeal perfusion system that the defect in platelet-vessel wall interaction in swine with von Willebrand's disease is influenced by both the local flow conditions and the level of activation of the coagulation system. In the presence of an intact coagulation system a synergistic interaction between procoagulant moieties and vWF was observed at high shear rates.\r"

We are certainly living through such an active phase today with evidence of rapid technological change all around us, and there is a tendency to believe that the rate of progress has never been greater; but this is, however, a misconception, as the golden age of medical history was a period of not much more than a decade in the middle of the nineteenth century when the whole face of medicine and surgery was completely transformed by at least seven enormous developments, each of which was dominated by a man (in one case a woman) of genius. It was then that Claud Bernard (Fig. 1) completely transformed and advanced the whole science of physiology, while another Frenchman, Louis Pasteur (Fig. 2) established the principles of practical bacteriology, and a German, Virchow (Fig. 3) founded the speciality of histopathology. By applying the discoveries of Pasteur, Lister (Fig. 4) in Edinburgh, and later in London, developed the whole concept of antiseptic surgery which rapidly led to the aseptic surgery of today. This, together with the simultaneous introduction of anaesthesia, has completely transformed the practise of surgery.\r"

The traditional treatment is decortication of the vocal cords followed by speech therapy, but the results have so far been disappointing. It has been shown by Moesgaard Nielsen et al. (1985) and Matsuo et al. (1983) that, in the long term, the incidence of recurrence is approximately 60 per cent. Medical treatment of this disease is therefore desirable. It is widely known that topical steroids are often used, but the effects of such treatment have not, so far as we know, been documented. We have found it interesting to observe the effects of BDP inhalation aerosol and placebo in the course of a four-week double-blind randomized trial treatment of Reinke's oedema.\r"

  ".W": "A method for the demonstration of the topographical distribution of phenobarbital at the cellular level in various tissues was established. Mice that had been exposed to various doses of phenobarbital by intraperitoneal injection were killed, and their tissues were fixed with 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4) containing paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde. Thereafter, paraffin and frozen sections were made and stained by the indirect immunoperoxidase method using antisera obtained from commercial sources and used for the immunochemical assay of the blood level of phenobarbital in clinical medicine. A specific positive reaction was observed solely in testing the intoxicated tissues, and this reaction was inhibited when phenobarbital was added to the antisera. The minimal sensitivity of the positive reaction, which can be discerned by observing the stained slides macroscopically, was in the range of 10 mg/kg. Thus, the diagnosis of phenobarbital intoxication in the forensic autopsy can be made by immunohistochemistry. A positive reaction was found in various tissue cells, including nerve cells, myelin sheaths, glia cells, hepatocytes, cells of the alveolar and bronchial wall, epithelial cells of the distal part of the renal tubules, and so forth. Endothelial cells of the capillaries in all tissues gave a strong positive reaction. The immunocytochemical electron microscopy of the hepatocytes revealed that the positive reaction in the cytoplasm was located solely in the intraluminal space of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. These results indicate some interesting aspects of the pharmacokinetics of phenobarbital in vivo. It is expected that the antisera, which are used widely for the assay of the blood concentration of various drugs (phenobarbital, amphetamines, morphine, and so forth), may be regarded as excellent reagents for immunocytochemistry. This clearly indicates that morphological evidence in toxicology, which had so far remained obscure, can be easily obtained by applying these antisera against various drugs.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of insulin-induced reduction in blood glucose to 65 +/- 20 mg/dl (mean +/- standard deviation) on recovery of electrophysiological function and extracellular lactate concentration was studied in a rabbit model of spinal cord ischemia. These results were compared to findings in animals with spinal cord ischemia that either were fasted overnight (fasted group: blood glucose 97 +/- 26 mg/dl) or had no pretreatment (control group: blood glucose 172 +/- 65 mg/dl). The aorta was occluded until the postsynaptic waves of the spinal somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP's) had been absent for 20 minutes, a period of ischemia that produces paraplegia in 100% of untreated rabbits. The total aortic occlusion time was not significantly different in the three groups. Recovery of the SSEP's was significantly better in the insulin-treated animals than in the fasted or control animals. The N3 wave of the SSEP's, which has been found to correlate best with neurological recovery, returned to 65% +/- 48% of the preischemia amplitude in the insulin-treated animals, compared to 40% +/- 34% in the fasted group and 26% +/- 24% in the control animals. Extracellular lactate concentration in the spinal cord increased immediately after occlusion of the aorta, reached a plateau as the postsynaptic waves disappeared from the SSEP's, and then increased a second time during the first 15 minutes of reperfusion. The peak lactate concentration during ischemia and during reperfusion correlated with the preischemia glucose concentration (r = 0.60336 and r = 0.76930, respectively). Lactate concentration in the spinal cord was higher during ischemia and throughout the first 2 hours of reperfusion in the control and fasted animals than in the insulin-treated animals. During the 2nd hour of reperfusion, lactate concentration was significantly higher in the control animals than in the fasted animals. Reduction in blood glucose with insulin improves recovery of electrophysiological function after spinal cord ischemia, probably because of reduced lactic acid production, especially during the early reperfusion period.\r"

These anomalies can be corrected partially by supplementing the diet with Mn. The present work was designed to find out whether the hypercorticism of the obese mouse plays a role in this anomalous Mn metabolism in BAT. Mn content and MnSOD and SDH activities were determined in BAT from control and adrenalectomized (ADX) obese mice and from control and corticosterone-supplemented lean mice. Adrenalectomy of the obese mouse restored BAT Mn content, SDH activity and lipid peroxidative activity to normal but had little effect on MnSOD activity. Corticosteroid supplementation in the lean mouse did not reproduce the anomalies of Mn metabolism found in the untreated obese mouse. These results show that hypercorticism alone is not responsible for the anomalies of Mn metabolism. It is possible that the hyperinsulinemia of the obese mouse is involved in this process since adrenalectomy corrected hyperinsulinemia in the obese mouse, but corticosteroid supplementation of the lean mouse did not reproduce the high plasma insulin levels or the anomalies in body composition typical of the untreated obese mouse.\r"

The patients were divided into three groups according to age and eruption stage of the canine at the time of surgery. Group A included 94 patients with a mean age of 10 years, operated before eruption of the canine; group B included 72 patients with a mean age of 13.1 years operated after eruption of the canine; and group C included 58 patients operated after the age of 16 years (mean age, 20.4 years). The evaluation of the treatment results included longitudinal comparison of marginal bone level, periodontal status on cleft-related teeth, dental status in the bone grafted region, esthetical and functional properties of the reconstructed alveolar process, as well as the influence on growth of the maxilla. The marginal bone level was found to be significantly higher among unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP) and bilateral cleft lip and palate (BCLP) patients in the youngest groups as compared to the other groups. The number of UCLP and BCLP patients who could be treated without bridgework was significantly higher in the youngest age group than in the other groups, as were the esthetic and functional properties of the reconstructed alveolar process. External root resorption occurred in 17 patients in groups B and C. No influence of the procedure on sagittal growth of the maxilla could be demonstrated, whereas the anterior facial height was reduced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To gain further insight into the possible role of endogenous opioid peptides in the respiratory difficulties associated with the apnea of infancy and other disorders possibly related to apnea, the levels of beta-endorphin immunoreactivity were measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of five groups of infants: (1) infants with proved apnea, (2) infants with histories of an apparent life-threatening event (ALTE), (3) siblings of victims of the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), (4) infants with suspected but unproved apnea, and (5) infants undergoing investigation for other acute illnesses. Twenty-two infants considered at risk for an ALTE (groups 1 to 3) had significantly higher CSF beta-endorphin equivalents (88 +/- 7 pg/mL) than did the 22 control patients in groups 4 and 5 (31 +/- 3 pg/mL). Plasma beta-endorphin immunoreactivity, which was also measured in some of the infants, did not correlate with levels in CSF and, in fact, was significantly lower in the groups at risk for an ALTE (50 +/- 9 pg/mL; n = 14) than in the control subjects (80 +/- 6 pg/mL; n = 11). These studies indicate that elevated beta-endorphin immunoreactivity in CSF may be a marker in infants who have apnea and who may be considered at risk for an ALTE.\r"

We have used two single-copy Y chromosomal sequences specific for the short arm (47z and DP34) and one repeated sequence specific to the long arm (Y3.4) to study several patients with different types of sex chromosomal abnormalities, including three patients with gonadal dysgenesis and the karyotype 45,X/46,X + fragment, two females with Y autosomal translocations involving similar regions of the Y chromosome (46,XX,t(Y;14)(q11,p11) and 46,XY,t(Y;15)(q11,p11), two males with very small Y chromosomes (del(Y)(q12) and i(Yp], and a 45,X male with a small Y autosomal translocation. These techniques are more sensitive than chromosome banding and thus are an important adjunct to karyotyping for analysis of chromosomal content. For patients with gonadal dysgenesis and uncharacterized fragments, demonstration of Y chromosomal sequences identifies an important risk factor for the development of gonadoblastoma. For other patients, accurate identification of Y chromosomal content may facilitate prediction of the patient's phenotype.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the efficacy of indomethacin to prevent the occurrence of symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), a randomized clinical trial was conducted involving 32 preterm infants weighing 750 to 1500 g at birth who had hyaline membrane disease. By random assignment, 15 infants were given a single dose of indomethacin, 0.2 mg/kg intravenously, 24 hours after birth. Seventeen infants composed a control group for which indomethacin was reserved as treatment for symptomatic PDA. Birth weight, gestational age, male/female ratio, black/white ratio, and severity of disease were similar for both groups. Only one of the 14 survivors who received prophylactic indomethacin had symptomatic PDA, compared with nine of the 16 survivors in the control group (P = 0.007). There was no difference between the groups in development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, duration of time endotracheal intubation, was required, duration in oxygen, duration to reach full feedings and regain birth weight, and duration of hospital stay. There was no difference between the two groups in incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage, and none developed necrotizing enterocolitis. These results indicate that the use of prophylactic indomethacin is beneficial in prevention of symptomatic PDA; the lack of differences in pulmonary sequelae or other complications may have been related to a population sample size not large enough to impart sufficient statistical power.\r"

The purpose of our study was to examine the relationship between the transport of IgG1 and IgG2 and the transport of specific antibodies that are relatively restricted to a particular subclass, either IgG1 or IgG2. The concentrations of total serum IgG1 and IgG2 and those of IgG-anti-tetanus toxoid (TT) and anti-group A streptococcal carbohydrate (GAC) were measured in 30 paired maternal and cord sera. Previous studies have shown that anti-TT in adults is predominantly IgG1, whereas anti-GAC is predominantly IgG2. The mean cord/maternal concentration ratios of IgG1 and anti-TT were similar (1.77 +/- 0.56 and 1.93 +/- 0.67, respectively), but differed significantly (P = 0.0001) from those of IgG2 and anti-GAC (0.99 +/- 0.39 and 1.01 +/- 0.45, respectively). We confirmed the difference in cord/maternal concentration ratios of IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies by measuring IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies specific for Haemophilus influenzae type b capsular polysaccharide; the mean cord/maternal concentration ratio of IgG1-anti-Hib PS was significantly higher than that of IgG2-anti-Hib PS (2.23 +/- 0.83 compared with 0.94 +/- 0.49, P = 0.01). These results indicate that placental transport of IgG antibodies is related to their subclass composition.\r"

In addition, response-contingent i.v. dexoxadrol maintained higher rates of responding than either levoxadrol or beta-dioxadrol in monkeys experienced with ketamine self-administration. The order of potency in displacing bound 1-[1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl]piperidine from binding sites in rat brain homogenates was dexoxadrol much greater than levoxadrol = beta-(+/-)-dioxadrol. Viewed in the context of previous studies with stereochemical probes of the PCP receptor, these results extend and confirm the supposition that dexoxadrol and levoxadrol are the stereochemical probes of choice in the study of effects mediated through PCP receptors. The absolute configuration of dexoxadrol was determined to be 4S, 6S by X-ray crystallography, thus defining the optimum chirality necessary for receptor binding and PCP-like activity in the dioxadrol series. Based on these and other considerations, receptor-active conformations of dexoxadrol and PCP are proposed.\r"

  ".W": "The present study examines whether sustained changes in the biosynthetic activity of the intermediate pituitary, induced pharmacologically by treating rats with dopamine receptor ligands, alters the post-translational processing of beta-endorphin (beta-END). Separation of the individual molecular forms of beta-END using ion exchange chromatography revealed that beta-END is processed to alpha-N-acetylated and nonacetylated forms of beta-END-(1-31), beta-END-(1-27) and beta-END-(1-26) in the neurointermediate lobe (NIL). Chronic treatment with D-2, but not D-1, dopamine receptor antagonists elevated total beta-END immunoreactivity (i beta-END) in the NIL but this increase was predominantly attributable to elevations in the concentrations of N-acetyl-beta-END-(1-31) and N-acetyl-beta-END-(1-27). In contrast, N-acetyl-beta-END-(1-26) was not significantly affected. The dopaminergic agonist, bromocriptine, had the opposite effect; it lowered total i beta-END levels, depleting N-acetyl-beta-END-(1-31) and N-acetyl-beta-END-(1-27) to a greater extent than N-acetyl-beta-END-(1-26). beta-END peptides were released in vitro in the same relative proportion as they were contained in the NIL suggesting that individual molecular forms of beta-END are not released preferentially. i gamma-END levels also were modulated by dopaminergic agents but the processing of gamma-END and alpha-END was not altered. Acute haloperidol treatment depleted i gamma-END levels but did not affect the pattern of beta-END peptides in the NIL. These results indicate that dopaminergic agents influence not only the secretion but also the post-translational processing of pituitary beta-END.\r"

  ".U": "88035646\r", 
  ".W": "Nicotine is a potent secretagogue for the release of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary in vivo. However, the location of its action is unknown; knowledge of this is essential for elucidating its mechanism. Our studies show that cytisine, a peripherally acting nicotinic cholinergic agonist, given i.v. at doses equimolar or greater than nicotine, failed to elevate plasma ACTH levels, whereas nicotine (0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg b.wt.) had significant effects. Nicotine (10(-7)-10(-4) M) had no effect on the secretion of beta-endorphin by anterior pituicytes in vitro, nor did it potentiate the action of corticotropin-releasing factor (10(-9) or 10(-8) M). Intracerebroventricular injection of nicotine (1-20 micrograms) significantly elevated ACTH levels. Moreover, ACTH responses to nicotine delivered into the hypothalamic region of the third ventricle were significantly greater than those elicited by injection into the upper region. Additional studies were conducted to determine the earliest age at which nicotine stimulates ACTH. The response to i.p. nicotine (1 or 2 mg/kg b.wt.) was present but diminished during the postnatal period, whereas maximal responses comparable to mature rats were attained by day 15. To establish whether nicotine has a central effect in younger animals, nicotinic antagonists were tested. Hexamethonium (2 mg/kg b.wt.), a peripherally acting antagonist, was ineffective against nicotine (0.025 and 2.0 mg/kg b.wt.), whereas mecamylamine (2 mg/kg b.wt.), inhibitory at both peripheral and central sites, blocked the ACTH response. Thus, whether administered peripherally or centrally, nicotine activates central mechanisms mediating the release of ACTH; it appears that the target(s) for nicotine are within the hypothalamus or brainstem.\r"

  ".W": "The possibility that the kappa agonists, U50,488H, ethylketazocine and tifluadom, might act as opioid antagonists was studied using the inhibition of the anesthetized rat micturition reflex in vivo as a pharmacological endpoint. Intracerebroventricular administration of equieffective doses of the mu agonists [D-Ala2, NMePhe4, Gly-ol]enkephalin (0.01 nmol), [N-MePhe3, D-Pro4]enkephalin (0.03 nmol), morphine (0.08 nmol), normorphine (0.3 nmol), sufentanil (0.002 nmol), etorphine (0.004 nmol), phenazocine (17 nmol) and meperidine (176 nmol) inhibited spontaneous bladder contractions for a duration of approximately 20 to 30 min. Similarly, i.c.v. administration of the delta-selective agonist (D-Pen2, D-Pen5]enkephalin (15 nmol) inhibited the micturition reflex for approximately the same duration. The kappa agonists U50,488H (22 nmol), ethylketazocine (3 nmol) and tifluadom (3 nmol) did not alter bladder activity after i.c.v. administration. Higher doses of ethylketazocine (10 nmol) or tifluadom (20 nmol), but not U50,488H, produced consistent suppression of bladder contractions. Pretreatment of rats (-15 min, i.c.v.) with doses of U50,488H, ethylketazocine or tifluadom which did not produce an agonist effect consistently blocked the inhibitory actions of the mu agonists morphine and normorphine on bladder motility, but failed to antagonize the similar actions of the mu agonists [D-Ala2, NMePhe4, Gly-ol]enkephalin, [N-MePhe3, D-Pro4]enkephalin, phenazocine, meperidine or those of the delta agonist [D-Pen2, D-Pen5]enkephalin. Centrally initiated bladder effects of the mu agonists etorphine and sufentanil were antagonized by U50,488H but unaffected by ethylketazocine or tifluadom. In addition, administration of U50,488H (i.c.v.) during a morphine-induced bladder shutdown resulted in either an immediate recovery of bladder activity or a shortened duration of action.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The role of skeletal muscle thermogenesis (increases in skeletal muscle tone) in the hyperthermic responses of conscious, unrestrained rats given acute or repeated i.p. or i.c.v. injections of morphine sulfate (MS) or beta-endorphin was investigated. Initial blood gas experiments showed that rats given acute i.p. injections of MS caused PO2 and pH to decrease by 60 min postadministration in a dose-related fashion whereas PCO2 increased; with repeated MS administration the respiratory acidosis seen with acute injections was reduced. Acute i.p. injections of MS (1, 10 or 20 mg/kg) caused catalepsy scores, plasma lactate levels and electromyographic (EMG) amplitude to be elevated in a dose-related fashion along with a rise in rectal temperatures (TRS). Surface (tail) temperatures also rose after the acute MS injections but only after the increase in TR. Significant increases in EMG amplitude after acute injections of MS occurred even before TRS increased and, with subsequent naloxone HCl administration (10 mg/kg i.p.), a rapid and marked fall in EMG amplitude occurred before TRS fell back to saline control levels. Acute i.c.v. injections of 1.1 nmol of either MS or beta-endorphin also caused EMG amplitudes to rise significantly before TRS began to increase. Tail temperatures again increased passively after i.c.v. injection of either drug. Subsequent naloxone injections (10 mg/kg i.p.) to these groups also caused EMG amplitudes to decrease before TRS decreased back to control TRS. Repeated i.p. injections of MS (10 mg/kg i.p. daily for 5 days) caused TRS to be higher than those seen after the initial injection but catalepsy scores, plasma lactates and EMG amplitudes were below those respective levels seen upon acute MS administration. Similar chronic findings occurred in other groups of rats given 1.1 nmol of either MS or beta-endorphin i.c.v., when they had been previously given repeated i.p. injections of MS (5 mg/kg i.p. twice daily for 2 days). The results indicate that acute peripheral or central injections of MS or beta-endorphin to conscious rats cause skeletal muscle to be activated, resulting in nonlocomotor, catatonic behavior. This skeletal muscle activation occurs before the rise in TR and is thought to be an important and possibly the primary cause of the resultant hyperthermia seen in rats after acute central or peripheral administration of MS or beta-endorphin. Repeated injections of morphine cause TRS to escalate higher, compared to that seen with acute MS administration, yet catalepsy scores, plasma lactate levels and EMG amplitude changes did not increase likewise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In bovine adrenal medullary cells we investigated the effects of antidepressants on ionic channels and secretion of catecholamines. Tricyclic (imipramine, amitriptyline and nortriptyline) and tetracyclic (maprotiline and mianserin) antidepressants inhibited carbachol-induced influx of 22Na, 45Ca and secretion of catecholamines (IC50, 14-96 microM). Influx of 22Na, 45Ca and secretion of catecholamines due to veratridine also were inhibited by these drugs (IC50, 10-17 microM). However, antidepressants did not suppress high concentration of K-induced 45Ca influx and catecholamine secretion, suggesting that antidepressants do not inhibit voltage-dependent Ca channels. [3H]Imipramine bound specifically to adrenal medullary cells. Binding was saturable, reversible and with two different equilibrium dissociation constants (13.3 and 165.0 microM). Tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants competed for the specific binding of [3H]imipramine at the same concentrations as they inhibited 22Na influx caused by carbachol or veratridine. Carbachol, d-tubocurarine, hexamethonium, tetrodotoxin, veratridine and scorpion venom did not inhibit the specific binding of [3H]imipramine. These results suggest that tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants bind to two populations of binding sites which are functionally associated with nicotinic receptor-associated ionic channels and with voltage-dependent Na channels, and inhibit Na influx. Inhibition of Na influx leads to the reduction of Ca influx and catecholamine secretion caused by carbachol or veratridine.\r"

  ".W": "Intrathecal administration of the excitatory amino acid (EAA) agonists, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), quisqualate (Quis) or kainic acid (KA), in the spinal subarachnoid space of mice produced a dose-related biting and scratching behavior. Higher doses appeared aversive, suggesting a nociceptive action for EAAs in the spinal cord. Intrathecally administered NMDA, but not Quis or KA, produced a hyperalgesic effect in the tail-flick and hot-plate tests. To test the hypothesis that EAA agonists are involved in transmission of nociceptive information in the spinal cord, we tested the effect of various opioid, sigma and phencyclidine compounds on the action of NMDA in the tail-flick, hot-plate and biting and scratching nociceptive tests. Our results indicated that the involvement of mu, sigma and phencyclidine receptors was predominant in blockade of the behavioral and hyperalgesic effects of intrathecally administered NMDA. Delta receptors appeared less involved, and involvement of kappa receptors was not detectable in blockade of the behavioral and hyperalgesic effects of intrathecally administered NMDA. Quis and KA effects were not altered by any of these agonists. Agonist doses required to inhibit NMDA-induced hyperalgesia in the tail-flick and hot-plate tests were significantly less than those needed to inhibit biting and scratching behavior. The adrenergic agonist norepinephrine inhibited NMDA- but not Quis- or KA-induced biting and scratching behavior. This action appeared to be alpha-1 mediated because it was reversed by phentolamine but not by yohimbine. These results suggest that the actions of EAAs in the spinal cord are differentially affected by various opioid phencyclidine, sigma and adrenergic receptor agonists and support the hypothesis that EAAs are involved in the transmission of nociceptive information in the spinal cord.\r"

  ".W": "Metaphit, a derivative of phencyclidine (PCP) differing by the meta substitution of an isothiocyanate group on the phenyl ring, was given into the lateral cerebral ventricle of mice alone and as a pretreatment to the subsequent i.p. injection of PCP and pentobarbital. Drug effects on motor performance as an index of neurologic impairment were quantified using the mouse platform test. The ED50 of metaphit to disrupt mouse platform behavior 5 min after i.c.v. administration was 0.48 mumol. An isobolographic analysis indicated that metaphit interacted additively with PCP and pentobarbital. Animals that recovered 24 or 48 hr after a large dose (1 mumol i.c.v.) of metaphit or phenylisothiocyanate, a nonspecific acylating control substance, were then given PCP (18.3 mumol/kg i.p.) or pentobarbital (76.7 mumol/kg i.p.). Both agents enhanced PCP-induced failure of mice to climb to the top of the platform. Metaphit also enhanced pentobarbital-induced failure of mice to climb to the top of the platform. No evidence was obtained that metaphit antagonized the behavioral effects of PCP in mice.\r"

A review of 102 reported bullet emboli since 1930 indicates that the morbidity of a retained projectile is substantial (25%), while removal using modern techniques has few complications. Salient features of early extraction include: 1) prevention of proximal migration, 2) transvenous relocation of the missile to an accessible vein, and 3) peripheral surgical removal. Delayed recognition of an asymptomatic bullet embolus demands further judgment in guiding selective operative removal. A management scheme based on time of recognition, patient status, and embolus characteristics is presented for this unusual problem.\r"

  ".W": "The Tangshan earthquake was probably the worst catastrophe in this century. It took a death toll of 242,769, with 164,851 injured in addition. This presentation describes the organization of disaster relief work after the earthquake, the rescue of buried victims, the organization of medical resources, and the sanitation work to forestall epidemics. It also presents the author's reflections on the management of three major injuries, namely, crush syndrome, fracture of pelvis, and traumatic paraplegia, by reviewing the available data pertaining to these injuries. The author concurs with the prevailing opinion that fasciotomy plays an important role in the successful management of crush injury. It not only prevented acute renal failure subsequent to intracompartmental increase of pressure, but also the occurrence of Volkmann's ischemic contracture as a late sequela. Herbs to induce catharsis and diuresis were used to alleviate intracompartmental pressure. For the management of pelvic fractures, two newly developed treatment techniques are described. On analysis of clinical data, it is the author's opinion that traumatic paraplegia should not be given the priority of early surgery in the circumstances of mass casualties. The primary concern should be the stability and restoration of normal curvature of the spine, especially in cases of complete paraplegia. Decompression of the spinal cord through an anterolateral approach gave promising results in hyperflexion type of spinal fracture.\r"

  ".U": "88036123\r", 
  ".W": "The purpose of this review is to evaluate internal fixation by means of AO miniplates compared to conventional therapy for the treatment of complicated midface fractures. A more precise division of midface fractures into functional units than that afforded by the Le Fort classification was employed to categorize the complexity of injury. The criteria of evaluation were ease of functional rehabilitation, incidence of complications, and results of surgery. The classification system was helpful in surgical planning and in subsequent analysis of results. Forty-nine of the 92 midface fractures treated by open repair between July 1980 and January 1986 were malar fractures, and 41 of these had associated orbital fractures. The remaining 43 had Le Fort II or more complicated midface fractures, only 15 of which could be adequately categorized by the Le Fort classification. Twenty-two of the 43 patients with complicated midface fractures were surgically treated with internal fixation utilizing 67 AO miniplates. The remaining 21 patients were treated with conventional therapy utilizing a combination of intermaxillary fixation (IMF), and/or interosseous wiring, and/or primary bone grafting. Among the problems encountered were a nonunion of the midface in a delayed repair of a severely comminuted midface fracture, which required secondary split rib grafting. Three plates were removed because of intraoral extrusion. There were no plate-related infections. One of the advantages of internal fixation is that the need for primary bone grafting and external fixation is eliminated. Another is that intermaxillary fixation is needed less frequently, allowing immediate access to the oral cavity for control of airway, care of intraoral wounds, and rapid return to normal alimentation with full mandibular function. Most patients with no associated GI problems tolerated a soft diet within 6 days. Tracheostomy tubes were removed within 3 days if no pulmonary failure was present. We can conclude that internal fixation provides excellent stabilization and repair of complicated midface injuries with minimal complications and rapid return to function for most patients.\r"

WBS 3 weeks after observant therapy for splenic injury in dogs was significantly less than normal (0.66 vs. 0.37 kg/cm2). No WBS differences were seen 3 weeks after observant therapy in pigs nor 6 weeks after observant therapy in dogs or pigs. Prolonged convalescence following splenic injury treated by repair or by observation appears unwarranted.\r"

Sepsis resulted in similar delayed blood clearance and reduced liver (Kupffer cell) uptake of both TTC and E. coli. To investigate the ability of polyclonal antibody to E. coli-J-5 (core glycolipid) to improve RES function in the same model of sepsis, further animals were pretreated with either core glycolipid antibody or control serum (10 ml IV) 2 hours before induction of sepsis. TTC clearance kinetics were determined 24 hours later. Antibody pretreated animals showed: a reduced incidence of bacteremia; normalization of the rate of blood clearance and liver uptake of TTC; and a 'rebound' increase in splenic uptake of TTC. We conclude that antibody to E. coli-J-5 enhances bacterial clearance by the RES.\r"

All patients received cyclosporine and low dose prednisone with or without azathioprine as immunosuppressive therapy. Actual patient survival was 100 per cent at 1 year and actuarial 1-year graft survival was 82 per cent. Random blood transfusions and histocompatibility matching at the HLA-DR locus did not influence graft survival. Matching at 2 or more HLA-A and B loci was associated with a significant detrimental influence (p less than 0.05) on graft survival. We conclude that the use of cyclosporine-based immunosuppression overcomes much of the adverse effect of poor tissue matching and may obviate the need for random blood transfusions in cadaveric renal transplantation during the first year of engraftment.\r"

The levels of serum basic fetoprotein were studied in 58 patients (31 with seminoma and 27 with nonseminoma). Elevated levels were observed in 22 seminoma (71 per cent) and 15 nonseminoma (56 per cent) patients, while the levels of other markers (beta-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin, alpha-fetoprotein and lactic dehydrogenase) remained normal in 6 seminoma (19 per cent) and 2 nonseminoma (7 per cent) patients. The levels of basic fetoprotein changed in relation to the clinical courses and they elevated again in 3 of 4 patients with recurrence. The concentration of basic fetoprotein in testicular cancer tissue was significantly higher than in the normal testis. Histological localization of basic fetoprotein in testicular cancer tissue was demonstrated immunohistochemically. Thus, basic fetoprotein was considered to be a useful serum marker for testicular cancer.\r"

Of the patients 80 per cent had at least 1 episode and 48 per cent had 2 or more. None of the clinical factors we examined, including age, nutritional status, stool incontinence, diabetes mellitus, episodes of catheter blockage and the use of chronic suppressant antimicrobial therapy, was associated with the development of symptomatic infection. Further research on host and pathogen-related factors that increase the risk for symptomatic infection, and improvements in infection control and catheter care protocols are necessary to decrease catheter-associated morbidity among male nursing home patients who must be managed by chronic indwelling catheterization.\r"

  ".W": "Several biodegradable and artificial materials have been used in the urinary tract for partial or total replacement of the bladder. Most of the graft materials have resulted in stone formation, collapse, rejection, or extrusion of the graft without adequate reconstruction of a functional bladder. In this paper, we present our assessment of the use of placental membranes as a feasible, economic, and acceptable organic agent for bladder reconstruction. Eight mongrel dogs were subjected to supratrigonal cystectomy, and then a 10 X 10 centimeter patch of human placental membrane was sutured to the remaining trigone in a watertight fashion. The dogs were sacrificed twelve weeks after surgery. Histologic examinations revealed evidence of regeneration of normal-appearing smooth muscle along the path of a retracting placental patch, and thus of reconstitution of a normal-appearing and functioning bladder. On the basis of this study, we believe that placental membranes, because of their low antigenic properties and easy availability, provide an excellent graft material for the urinary tract. Further studies concerning the application of this graft material in various pathological conditions are now in progress.\r"

The early response was characterized by rapid rise in IgM in serum and urine. This response decreased rapidly and was undetectable in urine after eight weeks. Correlation between total serum and urine levels of IgM was not found although a chronological relationship was observed. Total and specific serum and urine IgA responses were erratic. Concentrations of IgA were low and this antibody class was undetectable in urine until the infection had been established for six weeks. In contrast, total serum and urine IgG increased in concentration at five days post infection and reached total maximum by weeks four to eight, then declined, but remained detectable over 24 weeks. Specific IgG titers remained elevated in serum but declined in urine between four and 10 weeks. A correlation between total serum and total urine IgG was found. Also, bacteria generated a concomitant nonspecific response, a part of which was detected against a common antigen expressed on E. coli J5 strain that cross-reacts with a number of gram negative genera. The results show that IgM chronologically is the first antibody to appear in increased amounts in the serum and urine, followed by IgG. The data also suggests a relationship exists between total serum IgG and total urine IgG which may affect the host's ability to eliminate urinary infection.\r"

Arteriovenous fistulas 2 cm in length were created bilaterally in the femoral vessels of 10 dogs and were studied at 1 (n = 2), 2 (n = 2), 4 (n = 3), and 8 (n = 3) weeks. In each animal, one anastomosis (control) was closed with running 6-0 polypropylene sutures, and the contralateral anastomosis (experimental) was sealed with an argon laser (0.5 watt, 4 minutes of exposure, 1830 J/cm2/1 cm length of anastomosis). At removal all experimental anastomoses were patent without hematomas, aneurysms, or luminal narrowing. Histologic examination at 4 weeks revealed that laser-welded anastomoses had less inflammatory response and almost normal collagen and elastin reorientation. At 8 weeks sutured anastomoses had significant intimal hyperplasia whereas laser repairs had normal luminal architecture. Tensile strength and collagen production, measured by the synthesis of hydroxyproline and the steady-state levels of type I and type III procollagen messenger ribonucleic acids, at the anastomoses and in adjacent vein and artery specimens were similar in sutured and laser-welded repairs at 2, 4, and 8 weeks. We conclude that argon laser welding of anastomoses is an acceptable alternative to suture techniques, with the advantage of improved healing without foreign body response and possible diminished intimal hyperplasia at the anastomotic line.\r"

  ".W": "Three methods for estimating peripheral artery pressure gradients from ultrasound data were assessed by means of an acute canine aortic coarctation with a variable stenosis and retrospective data from 18 patients with iliac stenoses who had duplex scanning studies and pressure measurements at the time of angiography. The measured pressure difference was correlated with end-diastolic velocity, the presence or absence of reverse flow in diastole, and a pressure difference calculated with the modified Bernoulli equation. Although the calculated pressure gradients correlated well with measured values in animal studies (11 animals, r = 0.78, n = 224, SD = 8.1), they did not in the clinical studies (r = 0.54, n = 33, SD = 28). In both cases, pressure gradients were consistently overestimated for mild stenoses. There was a strong correlation between end-diastolic velocity and pressure gradient (r = 0.71, n = 94, SD = 5.2 for animal studies; r = 0.81, n = 36, SD = 23 for clinical studies), but the data were too variable to provide useful pressure estimates. In clinical studies the absence of reverse flow in diastole at the site of the stenosis was the best indicator of a resting pressure gradient of greater than 15 mm Hg. We conclude that the modified Bernoulli equation and end-diastolic velocity correlate highly with the pressure gradient but are not clinically useful because the variability is too great. The absence of reverse flow in diastole is a more reliable indicator of hemodynamically significant stenosis.\r"

  ".W": "Biochemical (or functional) adaptation of venoarterial grafts has been demonstrated recently. We reexamined one aspect of this biochemical \"arterialization\" process: prostacyclin (PGI2) production by canine venoarterial autologous grafts and the responsiveness of this biosynthetic pathway to maximal stimulation with substrate enhancement. Four reversed autologous grafts (femoral vein) were interposed into both carotid and femoral arteries in eight dogs. After 12 weeks, the grafts were removed, and radioimmunoassay was used to determine luminal surface production of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (the stable metabolite of PGI2) in both the basal and stimulated (27 mumol/L arachidonic acid [AA]) states. PGI2 production by the venous autologous grafts was compared with that of control native artery and vein. We confirmed that PGI2 production (measured in nanograms per milliliter) by control artery was greater than vein under both basal conditions (5.8 +/- 0.4 [+/- SEM] vs. 2.7 +/- 0.5, p less than 0.001) and stimulated conditions (8.8 +/- 0.8 vs. 5.5 +/- 0.4, p = 0.002); moreover, AA stimulation significantly increased PGI2 production in both native artery and vein compared with basal PGI2 production. Under basal conditions, graft PGI2 production (6.3 +/- 1.6 ng/ml) was not significantly different than basal arterial levels (p = 0.8) but was higher than basal venous levels (p = 0.05). However, in marked contrast to both native artery and vein, the vein graft flow surface showed no significant response to substrate enhancement with AA: basal (6.3 +/- 1.6 ng/ml) vs. stimulated (5.9 +/- 0.9 ng/ml) (p = 0.8). These observations confirm that canine venoarterial autologous grafts undergo biochemical \"arterialization\"; however, this process appears to be an incomplete one.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The carotid bifurcation in 900 patients was evaluated by angiography and ultrasound. In 216 cases, high-quality endarterectomy specimens were available for comparison with the preoperative images. All comparisons were made in a blinded fashion. Results indicate that ultrasound is able to differentiate angiographically normal from abnormal arteries with a sensitivity of 88% (1077 of 1233 arteries) and accuracy of 79% (1251 of 1578 arteries). Angiographic stenoses equal to or greater than 50% diameter were accurately identified by ultrasound imaging in 72% (1133 of 1578 arteries) of cases, and this was improved by the addition of other functional data (i.e., Doppler spectral analysis and oculoplethysmography). There was only modest correlation of absolute measurements of lesion width, minimal lumen, and standard lumen by the two imaging techniques (r = 0.28 to 0.55). Ultrasound measurements of lesion width were on the average 2 mm greater than those of angiography. The lumen averaged 1.5 mm larger when measured by ultrasound techniques. In the subset in which data were available from endarterectomy specimens, ultrasound showed the best correlation with lesion width (mean difference -1.1 mm) and angiography correlated best with minimal lumen (mean difference -0.1 mm). Neither examination consistently identified ulcerated plaques. Although ultrasound imaging alone has limited usefulness in quantitating luminal stenosis, this can be improved by the use of Doppler spectral analysis and oculoplethysmography. Ultrasound is superior to angiography for quantifying atherosclerotic plaque (lesion width) and will be an important tool for further study of atherosclerotic lesions.\r"

We determined the indications for the procedures using a detailed review of medical records and used previously developed ratings of appropriateness to assign an appropriateness score to each case. Differences among sites in levels of appropriateness were small. For example, in the high-use site for coronary angiography, 72% of the procedures were appropriate, compared with 81% in the low-use site. Coronary angiography was performed 2.3 times as frequently in the high-use site compared with the low-use site. Under the conditions of this study, we did find significantly levels of inappropriate use: 17% of cases for coronary angiography, 32% for carotid endarterectomy, and 17% for upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy. We conclude that differences in appropriateness cannot explain geographic variations in the use of these procedures.\r"

These physicians represented seven different specialties and subspecialties and performed 4988 procedures, 92% of the desired sample. Only three of 230 hospitals did not participate. We attribute our method's success primarily to the formation of a network to connect the branches of the profession, respect for office and hospital practice routine, confidentiality, and the development of carefully designed medical record abstraction systems. We conclude that, with effort, cooperative research among disparate segments of the medical community can become a reality even if the topic studied is relatively sensitive.\r"

We studied large geographic areas (three sites) in three states, representing regions of high and low use. The high-use site had fewer procedures classified as appropriate (72%) than either low-use site (77% and 81%, respectively). Over all sites, 17% of procedures were classified as inappropriate. Patients in the high-use site were older, had less severe angina, and were less intensively medically treated than patients in either of the low-use sites. Patients without angina who had not undergone exercise testing constituted the most common subgroup of inappropriate cases. Although overall differences in appropriateness were not large, practice differences do exist. This analysis of practice differences among study sites provides the clinical basis for understanding the small, but significant, differences in the appropriateness of use of coronary angiography. The finding of 17% inappropriate use may be cause for concern.\r"

  ".W": "An open study designed to compare the effectiveness and safety of clotrimazole troches with nystatin oral suspension in the prevention of oropharyngeal candidiasis was conducted. This study was performed as the troche form of clotrimazole was easier to administer and less costly than nystatin oral suspension. Sixty assessable patients were randomized to receive either clotrimazole troches (n = 32) or nystatin oral suspension (n = 28) for a 60-day period after receiving a renal allograft. The two groups were comparable in age, sex, type of transplant, and amount of immunosuppression. Both regimens were 100% effective in preventing the development of thrush in the patients studied. Adverse effects were infrequently seen in either group (one case of mild nausea in the clotrimazole group and three cases in the nystatin group). One patient chose to withdraw from the clotrimazole group, and eight patients withdrew from the nystatin group before completing 60 days of therapy (P = .002). Reasons given for withdrawal were the unpleasant taste of the drugs, or an inability to comply with the protocol. The cost of clotrimazole troches in the prophylactic doses given in this study was approximately one tenth that of nystatin oral suspension. Clotrimazole troches are effective, less expensive, and easier to self-administer than nystatin oral suspension.\r"

To address this question, the outcomes of pregnancies identified before 21 days of conception by serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin assays were studied. All subjects underwent ultrasound examinations at eight and 12 weeks' gestation. Among 220 women who had a viable pregnancy at eight weeks, only seven (3.2%) experienced a fetal loss thereafter. The results of this study suggest that most clinically recognized spontaneous abortions manifested after eight weeks actually represent pregnancies in which fetal demise occurred before eight weeks. These findings have important implications with respect to the safety of chorionic villi sampling and to the identification of exogenous agents that cause fetal wastage.\r"

  ".W": "A 15-year-old girl who presented with primary amenorrhea and virilization had an adrenocortical adenoma that secreted predominantly testosterone. To our knowledge, she is the first peripubertal and second youngest patient with a testosterone-secreting adrenal tumor described. Serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and urinary 17-ketosteroid and 17-hydroxycorticosteroid levels were normal. A tumor was located by a computed tomographic (CT) scan and by uptake of 6-beta-[75Se] selenomethylnorcholesterol. Microscopic examination of the tumor showed typical features of an adrenocortical adenoma with no histologic features characteristic of Leydig cells. Postoperatively, her hirsutism regressed, she rapidly went through puberty, and regular monthly menstruation started four months later. Finding the source of testosterone in a virilized patient can be difficult. Eleven of the 14 previously described patients with testosterone-secreting adrenal tumors initially underwent misdirected surgery on the ovaries. Review of these cases revealed that results of hormone stimulation and suppression tests are unreliable and that these tumors are usually large. Therefore, CT scanning of the adrenal glands is recommended in all patients suspected of having a testosterone-secreting tumor. If the adrenal glands on CT scan are normal, then surgery directed at the ovaries can be undertaken. Adrenal and ovarian vein catheterization is rarely necessary.\r"

  ".U": "88036367\r", 
  ".W": "Although perinatal transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is well documented, seroprevalence rates of HIV in populations of women of reproductive age have not yet been reported. To determine the seroprevalence of HIV in childbearing women from a population with a high incidence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, cord blood samples were collected from 602 infants delivered at an inner-city municipal hospital in New York. Demographic and HIV risk factor information was also collected from mothers of these infants. Twelve (2%) of 602 samples (95% confidence interval, 1% to 4%) were positive for HIV on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analysis. In interviews, seven of 12 seropositive women had risk factors as defined by the Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta; the remaining five seropositive women had no self-identified risk factors. The HIV seroprevalence rate in our hospital (2.0%) is several times higher than that of many other diseases for which screening is already routine. This serosurvey indicates that HIV infection of inner-city parturients is a significant problem that warrants broadly implemented health strategies. Furthermore, the data also suggest that if risk factor information elicited by physicians is used to initiate HIV antibody counseling and testing of pregnant women, a significant number of seropositive parturients is missed. In areas with significant seroprevalence rates of HIV infection, a broader counseling and testing program may be needed.\r"

A substantial proportion of patients present physicians with somatic complaints for which no organic cause can be found. Patients who are hypochondriacal do not understand the benign nature of functional somatic symptoms and interpret these as evidence of disease. Hypochondriacal concerns range from common short-lived worries to persistent and distressing fears or convictions of having a disease. Hypochondriasis can be secondary to other psychiatric disorders (eg, melancholia or panic disorder), and hypochondriacal attitudes remit when the primary disorder is successfully treated. Patients with primary hypochondriasis are also anxious or depressed, but the fear of disease, or the false belief of having a disease, persists and is the most important feature of their psychopathology. There are substantial differences among hypochondriacal patients in their personalities and psychopathologies. Psychotherapy as well as psychotropic drugs are effective in the treatment of functional somatic symptoms. There are no adequate controlled studies on the value of psychotherapy in hypochondriasis; the recommended guidelines are based on uncontrolled studies of hypochondriasis and on controlled studies of the psychotherapy in similar disorders. The prognosis of functional somatic symptoms as well as that of hypochondriasis is good in a substantial proportion of patients.\r"

Allergic reactions (immune) constitute only 5% to 10% of adverse drug reactions. Drug intolerance (nonimmune) constitutes the rest of these reactions. Many of these latter reactions are mild and self-limited, and many drug intolerances cannot be exactly characterized. Of those reactions in which an immune mechanism has been indicated or reactions that clinically appear to be \"allergiclike,\" a limited number of in vivo (eg, skin tests) or in vitro (eg, RAST, IgE-ELISA, other antibody, or cell-mediated assays) tests have proved helpful in the diagnosis. Best studied are adverse reactions to aspirin, penicillin, insulin, and RCM. The principal treatment of all adverse drug reactions is to avoid the drug that has been specifically identified as being responsible for the previous reaction. In cases where avoidance is not possible, desensitization is an alternative (eg, penicillin and insulin). Prophylactic treatment of patients who had previously demonstrated a drug intolerance reaction (eg, systemic RCM reaction) with medication--particularly type I activation--may be helpful in some patients.\r"

  ".W": "The maternal immune system is challenged with paternal antigens through exposure to trophoblast tissue and fetal cells crossing the placenta into the maternal circulation. The dose of antigen, the manner of presentation (cellular, subcellular, or soluble), and the nature of the antigen all determine the type of response that will be elicited. It is also clear that complex maternal immunologic responses, including antibodies to red blood cell antigens, HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-D antigens, and cell-mediated responses such as proliferation, lymphokines, cytotoxicity, and suppressor cells, are generated to a variety of paternal antigenic determinants. The fact that some of these reactions are detected in vitro in the absence of maternal serum, but not in its presence, suggests that the local milieu is important in influencing their expression in vivo. For example, such factors as hormones (cortisol, progesterone, and estrogen), pregnancy-associated glycoproteins (alpha 2-macroglobulin and beta 1-glycoprotein) and AFP, which have immunosuppressive properties, may all serve nonspecifically to inhibit and decrease the general tone of maternal immunologic responses, particularly at the placental interface, where many of these factors are present in high concentrations. However, these nonspecific factors may not be sufficient to prevent presensitized effector lymphocytes from continuing an ongoing rejection process, as is often the case in the chronic rejection of an allograft. For this purpose, specific enhancing antibodies would play an important role by blocking maternal responses or protecting the fetus. There may be a subtle balance created on the trophoblast cell surface between specific antibodies and trophoblast or embryonic alloantigens, resulting in limited expression of antigens capable of inducing rejection reactions. This could favor the production of blocking antibodies and/or T-suppressor cells, as opposed to cytotoxic antibody and killer cells. In fact, low levels of antigen density on the cell surface favor a blocking effect by IgG rather than cytotoxicity. Blocking or enhancing antibodies can exert their effect on maternal immunologic responses in several ways. They could block the afferent limb by combining with antigen and preventing sensitization or increasing the level of sensitivity. An example of the latter would be the coating of fetal cells that enter the maternal circulation. Enhancing antibodies could work directly on the effector cells to suppress their function. The antibody itself, or more likely antigen-antibody complexes, may be important in this regard.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

All 69 plant workers were interviewed and examined for the presence of pustular, draining, or inflamed lesions. During a three-month period, 44 episodes of skin infection occurred in 32 workers, all but four of whom worked in boning or killing areas. Acquiring infection was associated with job category (relative risk [RR], 5.7; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 2.9 to 11.3) and having at least two hand lacerations (RR adjusted for occupation, 6.2; 95% CI, 3.0 to 12.5). Group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (18), Staphylococcus aureus (12), or both (20) were isolated from 70 lesions cultured. Meat is suspected as a vehicle of transmission because cultures of two meat specimens contained the same GABHS strain as did 24 isolates from patients. Increasing reports of GABHS skin infections in meat packers suggest that this occupational risk may be more common than is realized.\r"

Unlike other cancers, which are usually hidden from detection until they are relatively large or metastatic disease has occurred, cutaneous melanoma is readily detectable simply by examining the skin. Information is now available that will be useful in selecting individuals at greatest risk. The most important melanoma risk factors (in decreasing order of importance) for a given individual are as follows: a persistently changed or changing mole, adulthood, irregular varieties of pigmented lesions (including dysplastic moles and lentigo maligna), a congenital mole, Caucasian race, a previous cutaneous melanoma, a family history of cutaneous melanoma, immunosuppression, sun sensitivity, and excessive sun exposure. Selective screening and appropriate treatment of individuals who have these risk factors may reduce the morbidity and mortality of cutaneous melanoma.\r"

The parameters of nutritional assessment should be determined according to the use for which they are intended, such as nutritional epidemiology, preoperative assessment of nutritional risk, or nutritional monitoring during parenteral or enteral feeding. The roles of some nutritional variables that are used to identify and monitor high-risk patients during nutritional repletion are examined. The main questions that confront the clinician are as follows: (1) are the nutritional indicators of surgical risk altered by poor intake of nutrients? (2) can these indicators be normalized with adequate feeding or are they abnormal as a result of the metabolic impact of the disease? (3) are these variables simple indicators of surgical risk or are they directly involved in the host-defense mechanism? The importance is stressed of an integrated assessment of the patient's status when nutritional support is considered. This involves not only the static evaluation of the nutritional support according to standard parameters, but also a prospective and dynamic evaluation of nutrient requirements, length of hospital stay, and the curability of the basic disease.\r"

By applying the measurement directly or through use of additional calculations, the practitioner can partition the body into fat and fat-free components. Quantifying these two body spaces provides information on the amount and rate of change over time in whole body energy supply and protein mass. These data can then be used in association with other indices of energy and protein metabolism. Whereas anthropometry is simple, practical, and inexpensive, the technique is limited to a qualitative tool by several sources of error. A thorough understanding of the strengths, limitations, and appropriate applications of anthropometry is essential when applying the method in clinical practice.\r"

However, most changes in tissue water and electrolytes are nonspecific and reflect the degree of sickness; they cannot be used for evaluation of malnutrition, except to indicate whether there is a loss or excess of intracellular ions, such as potassium and magnesium. In patients without disturbances in potassium metabolism, muscle cell potassium and protein are strongly correlated, but this relationship does not hold true in patients with potassium depletion. Accumulation and loss of potassium occur in parallel with changes in muscle glycogen, independent of other muscle constituents, eg, magnesium. Potassium depletion and excess, as well as changes in muscle glycogen, must be considered when evaluating the relation of lean body mass and total body protein content to total body potassium.\r"

However, many of these immunologic tests require specialized laboratory skills and take a long time to perform. These tests provide little additional information to the clinician concerning the nutritional status of the patient, compared to the data that can be obtained from a few simple, selected immunologic measurements. Only a few immunologic tests are sufficiently simple, reproducible, and reliable indicators of nutritional status to be of practical value for routine nutritional assessment. These are the total lymphocyte count and skin tests. At present, all of the other immunologic measurements that have been reviewed should be considered as research tools for nutritional assessment. Immunological tests can be affected by many clinical variables unrelated to nutrition, such as specific pathologic conditions, immunodepressive therapies, accidental or surgical trauma, and infection, and this fact should be considered when using immunological tests to assess nutritional status. Malnutrition suppresses the acute-phase response of plasma proteins. The measurement of the acute-phase response of selected acute-phase proteins can be a functional measurement of nutritional status.\r"

Using published values for urinary creatinine excretion per kilogram body weight in adult subjects of varying age and values for \"ideal\" weight as a function of height, we have derived normal values for expected creatinine excretion in men and women of varying height. These permit the derivation of an age-corrected CHI. Possible explanations for the normal decrease in creatinine excretion with age include (1) decreasing lean body mass with age, (2) decreasing proportion of muscle in lean body, and (3) lower meat intake in older persons. Diet has an important influence if meat intake is substantial or if consumption of a creatine-free diet is prolonged. Creatinine metabolism and extrarenal excretion are minor, except in subjects with reduced renal function. Application of a correction for constant extrarenal clearance of creatinine in patients with chronic renal failure probably is not valid. Further observations of creatinine excretion in normal subjects of varying age and height are needed.\r"

  ".W": "Classical balance techniques are a powerful, sensitive, and usually accurate technique for assessing the nutritional or metabolic response to changes in nutritional intake or to metabolic or physiological perturbations. Balances are particularly sensitive for examining transient or short-term responses to nutritional or metabolic stimuli. A major factor responsible for the precision and sensitivity of this technique is the precise control of the activities and environment of an individual during a classical metabolic balance study (eg, the carefully defined dietary intake, degree of exercise, and environmental temperature to prevent sweating); these same factors may enhance the precision and sensitivity of other metabolic or nutritional investigations that may be carried out concurrently with a balance study. Finally, for nitrogen balance studies, the measurement of nitrogen (eg, by the Kjeldahl technique) can be very accurate and sensitive. Despite these advantages, there are important limitations and errors that are inherent in the balance technique. The errors tend to overestimate intake and underestimate output, thereby leading to erroneously positive balances. These errors include losses of food on cooking and eating utensils and dishware, losses of feces or urine on toilet paper or in collection containers, and losses through sweat, exfoliated skin, hair and nail growth, saliva, menses, blood sampling, toothbrushing, semen, and, for nitrogen, from flatus and respiration. Cumulative balance measurements are particularly likely to be falsely positive. The magnitude of unmeasured losses vary among healthy individuals, with the magnitude of the nitrogen intake (for nitrogen), in altered environmental conditions (eg, with sweating), and possibly in disease states. Balance studies are also expensive and time consuming.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This approach should be useful to evaluate the energy and the nutrient needs of a patient under acute conditions. The measurement of energy expenditure is of obvious importance in assessing protein-calorie malnutrition. A better understanding of energy balance and nitrogen balance in critically ill patients is needed to determine the best caloric and nutrient intake to avoid tissue depletion. It is foreseen that this method will become more widely used when reliable equipment is made available.\r"
