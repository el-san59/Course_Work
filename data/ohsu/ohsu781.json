Postoperatively, serum calcium and nephrogenous cAMP declined to normal ranges. Pathologically, the tumor was a benign pheochromocytoma. The clinical findings resembled those of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM), and PTH-related protein (PTHrP) immunoreactivity was detected in the tumor extract at a concentration of 80.7 pmol/g wet wt, which is high compared to levels in malignant tumors causing HHM. Production of PTHrP was further confirmed by the demonstration of PTHrP mRNA with Northern blot hybridization analysis. Gel filtration of the extract revealed the presence of at least two different molecules with both immunological and biological activities. One of the peaks appeared close to PTHrP-(1-34), and the other between cytochrome-c and BSA. The latter showed a higher bioactivity to immunoreactivity ratio. These data indicate the multiplicity of PTHrP molecules in pheochromocytoma and support the idea that PTHrP produced by pheochromocytoma causes hypercalcemia in a similar fashion as HHM.\r"

STS mRNA was also localized to this outermost layer of the human trophoblast. At a cellular level, both STS message and immunoreactivity seemed to be more abundant during the late first and early second trimesters than in term placentas. Although the syncytial trophoblast is known to originate from the cytotrophoblast, neither STS immunoreactivity nor STS mRNA was detected in the cytotrophoblast at any stage of placental development studied.\r"

  ".W": "Toward the definition of optimal postmenopausal estrogen replacement we compared the effects of three graduated doses of two oral estrogens, estrone sulfate and 17 beta-estradiol, on the lipid profiles of two groups of six postmenopausal women. Because of metabolic interconversions equivalent serum concentrations of estrone and estradiol were produced with these regimens. However, differential effects were noted in lipoproteins. 17 beta-Estradiol caused an increase in total plasma cholesterol (from 5.71 +/- 0.36 to 5.99 +/- 0.57 mmol/L, baseline to high dose; P less than 0.02), high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (from 1.45 +/- 0.15 to 1.78 +/- 0.36 mmol/L; P less than 0.02), HDL2 cholesterol concentration (from 0.41 +/- 0.08 to 0.62 +/- 0.26 mmol/L; P less than 0.01), and triglyceride concentration (from 1.09 +/- 0.29 to 1.24 +/- 0.30 mmol/L; P less than 0.01) without affecting low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration. By contrast, estrone sulfate caused a decrease in total plasma cholesterol (from 6.51 +/- 0.85 to 5.87 +/- 0.41 mmol/L; P less than 0.05) and LDL cholesterol concentration (from 4.34 +/- 0.57 to 3.67 +/- 0.44 mmol/L; P less than 0.01) and an increase in HDL cholesterol (from 1.37 +/- 0.20 to 1.50 +/- 0.26 mmol/L; P less than 0.05) and HDL2 cholesterol concentration (from 0.34 +/- 0.18 to 0.49 +/- 0.18 mmol/L; P less than 0.01), but no change in total triglyceride concentration. We deduce that the differential effect of orally administered estrogens on lipoprotein metabolism in postmenopausal women may be attributed to a first pass effect on hepatic metabolism.\r"

  ".U": "90270362\r", 
  ".W": "This study is the first to use CRH-binding protein (CRH-BP) purified from human plasma to investigate how the CRH-BP affects the physiological activity of CRH. After incubation at 37 C for 15 min, purified CRH-BP reduced the ACTH-releasing activity of synthetic human (h) CRH in a dose-dependent fashion; using hCRH and CRH-BP at concentrations commonly found in late gestational maternal plasma, (1.5 and 100 ng/mL, respectively) an average 76% reduction in ACTH release was obtained. No effect was observed under the same conditions on ACTH release induced by ovine (o) CRH, which does not bind to CRH-BP. Kinetic estimations are presented to show that the extent of binding of CRH to its BP (and, hence, the reduction in its bioactivity) depends on the time available for binding and the concentration of reactants. Equilibrium between CRH and its BP at the concentrations used in the bioactivity studies take place within 400 s. Since long term secretion of placental CRH into the peripheral circulation occurs during the third trimester of pregnancy, we suggest that the presence of circulating CRH BP may partly explain how markedly elevated plasma levels of CRH coexist with normal ACTH levels at this time. We also propose that stress-induced CRH release will not be similarly quenched by the CRH-BP in the hypothalamic portal system, as the concentration of CRH released will be high, and the exposure time before reaching pituitary corticotropes will be low. Using pituitary cells constantly bathed in BP premixed with hCRH or BP alone (to mimic the situations in pregnancy and nonpregnancy, respectively), we show that short concentrated pulses of synthetic CRH (10 ng in 5 s) or rat stalk median eminence extract (one tenth stalk median eminence in 5 s) retain their ability to induce ACTH secretion despite the presence of CRH-BP. It is, thus, possible that CRH can still exert its role as a stress hormone in late gestation.\r"

In three otherwise different cell lines (NIC-H345, NIC-H69, and NIC-H510), similar chromatographic patterns of mainly GRP-(18-27) and some GRP-(14-27) along with large fragments of the C-terminal counterpart of the precursor were found to be stored in the cells. In tissue culture medium, gel filtration chromatography indicated that postsecretory limited proteolysis of the GRP precursor fragments occurred. The amount of accumulated immunoreactivity varied among the three cell lines and between the two parts of the precursor. In medium in which only low amounts of GRP immunoreactivity accumulated, the radiolabeled GRP was degraded rapidly. When incubated with plasma, GRP-(14-27) disappeared within a few hours, whereas the C-terminal precursor fragments were stable. It is concluded that the postsecretory stability of peptides excised from the GRP precursor in small cell lung cancer cells varies under tissue culture conditions, but epitopes in the C-terminal part of the precursor are more stable in plasma than the small GRP peptides and, thus, may serve as a better indicator than GRP itself for expression of the GRP precursor in cancer cells.\r"

  ".W": "Cortisol resistance is a rare condition due to abnormal glucocorticoid receptor function. Stimulation of aromatase activity by dexamethasone (DEX) in cultured human skin fibroblasts provides a model for studying the biological activity of glucocorticoid receptors in cells. Skin fibroblasts derived from an affected father and his less severely affected son with cortisol resistance were used for this study. Saturation analysis of DEX receptor binding was performed after incubation of cells with various DEX concentrations (1-50 nmol/L). In normal cells, the mean maximal binding capacity (Bmax) and dissociation constant (Kd) were 24 +/- 3 pmol/mg DNA and 14 +/- 3 nmol/L, respectively. Although the Bmax in cells of the father (33 +/- 2 pmol/mg DNA) was normal, the Kd (31 +/- 7 nmol/L) was abnormally elevated. By contrast, both the Bmax and Kd in cells of the son were normal. The dose response of aromatase activity to DEX stimulation was determined by assay of aromatase activity after incubation of cells in the absence or presence of DEX (0.25-500 nmol/L) for 14 h. In three strains of normal fibroblasts, the mean concentration of DEX that produced a half-maximal response was 6 +/- 1 nmol/L). In cells from the father, the mean concentration of DEX that produced half-maximal stimulation of aromatase (27 +/- 4 nmol/L) was abnormally elevated. By contrast, the concentration of DEX that half-maximally stimulated aromatase activity (6.0 and 5.9 nmol/L) was normal in cells from the son. These data provide additional evidence of abnormal glucocorticoid action in the father, but not in his son, and demonstrate the potential usefulness of determining aromatase induction by DEX as a means of assessing the biological activity of the glucocorticoid receptor.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to assess the recovery of spontaneous GH secretion 48 h after the cessation of GH therapy in children with idiopathic short stature treated with recombinant DNA-generated human GH (rhGH-M). Eleven prepubertal children with GH responses of 10.0 ng/mL or more after provocation were divided into therapeutic (n = 7) and control (n = 4) groups. GH was sampled every 20 min for 24 h in six treated and three control patients. One treated and one control patient had 12-h overnight studies because of their weight. The sampling studies were carried out before GH therapy was initiated and 48 h after rhGH was discontinued after 12 months of therapy. Three patients in the treated group also underwent a 24-h study at the 6 month time point. The treated group started treatment with rhGH (0.1 mg/kg), given three times a week. The results showed that pre- and posttreatment GH secretory profiles were comparable with respect to the number of peaks, mean concentrations, peak amplitude, and secretory rate. At the 6 month point, the mean GH and peak GH amplitude (n = 3) were greater than the means of the treatment group (n = 7) at the 0 and 12 month points, but the difference was not statistically significant. Somatomedin-C rose in the treated group from 0.42 +/- 0.1 to 1.25 +/- 0.3 U/mL (mean +/- SD; P less than 0.01). In the control group it rose from 0.56 +/- 0.1 to 1.16 +/- 0.8 U/mL (mean +/- SD; P greater than 0.05) because one patient entered puberty in the 12-month period of observation; his somatomedin-C level rose from 0.72 to 2.5 U/mL. We conclude that exogenous GH therapy does not interfere with the maintenance of endogenous pulsatile secretion of GH. These data show that exogenous GH therapy does not interfere with the maintenance of endogenous pulsatile secretion of GH and provide evidence for the resilience of the GH secretory system in the growing child.\r"

  ".U": "90270370\r", 
  ".W": "During the menstrual cycle, the ectocervical epithelium undergoes a cyclic change in differentiation that is correlated with changes in the circulating levels of estrogens and progestins. To better understand the mechanisms underlying this regulation, we have developed an ectocervical epithelial cell (ECE cell) culture system that responds in a physiological manner to stimulation by estrogens and progestins. We have recently proposed that four classes of hormones (retinoids, estrogens, progestins, and glucocorticoids) may play an important role in regulating differentiation. In the present paper we test this hypothesis directly by making detailed dose-response curves. Our results demonstrate that estrogen increases ECE cell differentiation, as measured by release of cornified envelopes (superficial cells), while progesterone decreases envelope production. The effects are dose dependent and within the expected physiological range (0.01-10 nM estrogen; 0.1-100 nM progesterone). Very low concentrations of Ro 13-6298 (0.01-10 nM), a synthetic retinoid, decreased envelope production, while hydrocortisone (0.1-50 nM) increased envelope production and cell growth. Importantly, agents that enhance envelope production are neutralized by agents that reduce envelope formation and vice versa. Based on these findings we conclude 1) that the differentiation-enhancing actions of glucocorticoids and estrogens can be antagonized by either progestins or retinoids, and 2) that glucocorticoids and retinoids are likely to determine the ECE cell differentiation set-point in vivo, with the sex steroids directly modulating the phenotype of the ECE cells around this set-point during the menstrual cycle. Moreover, these results appear to explain some of the clinical descriptions of changes in ectocervical cell morphology resulting from hyper- and hypoestrogenic stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of fasting on circadian and pulsatile TSH secretion was investigated in eight healthy subjects (four men and four women in the follicular phase). Each subject was studied twice, once during 24 h with normal food intake and once during the last 24 h of a 60-h fast. Blood was sampled every 10 min during 24 h for measurement of TSH by a sensitive immunoradiometric assay. Fasting induced a decrease in plasma T3 [1.73 +/- 0.06 vs. 1.36 +/- 0.04 nmol/L; P less than 0.01 (mean +/- SE), control period vs. fasting] and thyroglobulin (52 +/- 8 vs. 35 +/- 7 pmol/L; P less than 0.001) and an increase in plasma rT3 (0.30 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.44 +/- 0.09 nmol/L; P less than 0.02). Plasma T4, thyroid hormone binding index, and free T4 were not statistically different in both periods. The mean plasma 24-h TSH concentration was lower during fasting than in the control period (2.0 +/- 0.3 vs. 1.0 +/- 0.2 mU/L; P less than 0.005). This was associated with a decrease in mean TSH pulse amplitude during fasting (Desade program: 0.6 +/- 0.1 vs. 0.3 +/- 0.1 mU/L; P less than 0.01; Cluster program: 0.5 +/- 0.1 vs. 0.2 +/- 0.1 mU/L; P less than 0.05), whereas TSH pulse frequency during fasting was unchanged (Desade program: 8.4 +/- 0.9 vs. 9.8 +/- 0.8 pulses/24 h; Cluster program: 9.5 +/- 0.5 vs. 7.9 +/- 0.9 pulses/24 h). There was a highly significant correlation between the mean 24-h TSH concentration and the mean TSH pulse amplitude during both the control period and fasting. Although the decrease in TSH concentration during fasting was evident over 24 h, fasting especially decreased the absolute (1.3 +/- 0.3 vs. 0.4 +/- 0.1 mU/L, P less than 0.02) and the relative (101 +/- 18% vs. 40 +/- 14%; P less than 0.02) nocturnal TSH surge (mean TSH 0000-0400 h vs. mean TSH 1500-1900 h). The decreased nocturnal TSH surge during fasting was associated with a significantly decreased TSH pulse amplitude, but with an unaltered number of TSH pulses between 2000-0400 h. In conclusion, fasting decreases 24-h TSH secretion and the nocturnal TSH surge in the absence of a change in plasma T4 concentration. This is associated with a decreased TSH pulse amplitude, whereas TSH pulse frequency remains unchanged.\r"

Using this test, we have conducted a trial screening study for NC21OHD and have compared the study results with previously reported figures for the frequency of this disorder. Testing was performed on 258 subjects recruited from among the medical students and employees of the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. In 2 of the 249 admissible subjects, the 0700-0900 h salivary 17-OHP level was within the range for NC21OHD patients (0.72-6.7 nmol/L; n = 8). These 2 individuals were subsequently confirmed to be affected by ACTH testing. Of the subjects with morning salivary 17-OHP levels below the cut-off point of 0.72 nmol/L, 29 were recalled for ACTH testing and were confirmed to be unaffected. Prevalence of NC21OHD in the test population was determined according to ethnic group. Our study gives a prevalence by screening of 1.14% among caucasians, which agrees with values of 0.81% and 1.06% obtained by different analytical methods. Further, both affected subjects were Ashkenazi Jews, and the prevalence of 3.23% among study members from this group concurs with increased rates of 3.64% and 4.97% already reported. On the basis of a small population sample, screening so far confirms the claim that NC21OHD is the most common autosomal recessive human disorder. Using values from ACTH-proven unaffected subjects (n = 47) and NC21OHD patients (n = 10), we establish preliminary normative data for morning salivary 17-OHP levels of 0.172 nmol/L for unaffected subjects (95% confidence interval, 0.05-0.54 nmol/L) and 1.76 nmol/L for NC21OHD-affected subjects (95% confidence interval, 0.42-7.32 nmol/L).\r"

In the present study we sought to examine expression of the CgA gene in human parathyroid tissue from patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. We characterized the mRNAs coding for CgA and beta-actin in parathyroid tissue fragments obtained from 12 patients with parathyroid adenomas, 11 patients with familial multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (FMEN I) with parathyroid hyperplasia, and 11 normal subjects. The mRNAs were detected and analyzed by dot and Northern blot hybridization using cDNA probes. CgA mRNA transcripts of 2.1 kilobases were detected in normal and pathological parathyroids. Similarly, beta-actin mRNA species of 2.1 kilobases was present in all tissues. The relative level of parathyroid tissue CgA mRNA, calculated as the CgA/beta-actin mRNA ratio, was 73 +/- 18 in parathyroid adenoma, 73 +/- 20 in FMEN I, and 100 +/- 9 in controls (mean +/- SE; expressed as a percentage of the control reference group value). There were no significant differences among the steady state levels of CgA mRNA levels in these three groups (F = 0.98; P = 0.39). These results demonstrate that expression of CgA mRNA is qualitatively and quantitatively normal in parathyroid tumors from patients with FMEN I and parathyroid adenoma.\r"

  ".U": "90270379\r", 
  ".W": "Circulating GH levels in man fluctuate widely due to pulsatile GH secretion by the pituitary gland. During much of the time, plasma GH is undetectable by current assays. This is punctuated by occasional secretory episodes, resulting in plasma GH peaks of varying height. The principal diurnal secretory event for GH is that associated with early slow wave sleep, but little is known about the prevailing level and dynamics of GH during the day. We used a new ultrasensitive immunoradiometric assay for GH (Boots-Celltech IRMA; limit of detection, 20 ng/L) to measure plasma GH in the previously undetectable range and to assess its diurnal pattern. Plasma GH was measured every 20 min over a 24-h period in 12 normal subjects (6 men and 6 women, aged 20-47 yr) under physiological conditions. Time series analysis of plasma GH patterns was performed by the Cluster algorithm, autocorrelation, and spectral analysis. Plasma GH, as measured by IRMA, was detectable at all time points and ranged from 40-19,695 ng/L. Dynamic fluctuations occurred within and above the previously undetectable range, with amplitudes varying over 3 orders of magnitude. Women had significantly higher overall GH levels, higher peak amplitudes, and higher valley levels/nadirs than men. GH pulses occurred with an average frequency of about 13/day in both sexes, with a dominant, but not strictly periodic, 2-h rhythmicity. We conclude that in man pulsatile GH secretion occurs throughout the day, and that it is oscillatory rather than episodic. This neurosecretory pattern has eluded recognition heretofore because of the lack of assay sensitivity. Women of reproductive age have higher pulse amplitudes and a higher baseline but equal pulse frequency compared to men. Previous estimates of integrated GH concentrations and GH production rates were too high by a factor of 2 due to overestimation of GH levels in the undetectable range.\r"

This is apparent at a wide concentration range of 1,25-(OH)2D3 (3 X 10(-11)-10(-8) mol/L). Cholera toxin, forskolin, and isobutylmethylxanthine, which like PGE2 and histamine increase intracellular concentrations of cAMP, also act synergistically with 1,25-(OH)2D3 in this system. Culture of mitogen-stimulated adherent cell-depleted mononuclear cells with PGE2 increases the number of high affinity binding sites for 1,25-(OH)2D3. This finding may account for the synergistic interaction between the two agents.\r"

We hypothesized that the local estrogen/progesterone ratio may influence contractility of the adjacent myometrium and hence effect the timing of parturition. Thus, we studied steroid sulfohydrolase activity for P5S in these tissues and investigated the potential interaction of other steroids on the rates of hydrolysis of P5S and DHAS. The enzyme was present in both tissues, predominantly in the microsomal fraction. With P5S as substrate, the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) was similar in chorion (1.3 +/- 0.2 mumol/L, mean +/- SEM) and decidua (0.9 +/- 0.1 mumol/L) but the maximum velocity (Vmax) was significantly greater in chorion (2.6 +/- 0.4 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.3 nmol/mg protein/15 min, P less than 0.05). In both tissues there was a tendency towards greater activity in tissues obtained before labor compared to tissues obtained after spontaneous labor onset. Using either DHAS or P5S as substrate, there was significant inhibition of sulfohydrolase activity by other steroids at concentrations similar to those in late pregnancy fetal and maternal plasma. In microsomal preparations using DHAS as substrate, activity was inhibited by equimolar concentrations of estrone sulfate (E1S, by 38 +/- 2%), P5S (by 74 +/- 2%), and cholesterol sulfate (C27S, by 38 +/- 3%). With P5S as substrate, equimolar concentrations of E1S, DHAS, and C27S caused inhibition of sulfohydrolase activity by 19 +/- 5%, 16 +/- 4%, and 18 +/- 2%, respectively. These inhibitory effects also were observed using a tissue explant system with intact cells. In kinetic inhibition studies using DHAS as substrate, E1S and P5S were competitive inhibitors with inhibition constants (Ki) of 4.8 +/- 1.3 and 0.7 +/- 0.1 mumol/L, respectively. Using P5S as substrate, E1S and DHAS also were competitive inhibitors with Ki values of 8.2 +/- 2.1 and 9.6 +/- 1.2 mumol/L, respectively. For both substrates, the pattern of inhibition by C27S was complex. Preliminary experiments to distinguish, on the basis of differing physical-chemical properties, separate enzymes for different substrates were inconclusive. We conclude that human chorion and decidua can hydrolyze several steroid sulfoconjugates and this activity may regulate local estrogen and progesterone synthesis. There are significant interactions among steroid sulfoconjugates in regulating this activity. These activities may be important components of a paracrine system that determines myometrial contractility and the timing of parturition.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the role of the potent vasoactive kinin substance-P (SP) in flushing derived from various causes. SP was measured in plasma after acetone/ether extraction using an antiserum directed at the carboxy-terminal 5-11 amino acid region of undecapeptide SP. The antiserum had less than 1% cross-reaction with the other neurokinins, neurokinin-A and neuropeptide-K, that derive from the beta-preprotachykinin gene and share carboxy-terminal residues. Basal and pentagastrin-stimulated SP levels were measured in 22 healthy controls, 11 patients with histologically proven carcinoid tumors, 8 patients with tumors other than carcinoid, and 7 patients with idiopathic flushing (IF). Basal SP levels were less than 10 pg/mL in normal subjects. All patients with midgut carcinoid tumors had SP levels greater than 25 pg/mL, as did 7 of 8 patients with noncarcinoid tumors and 5 of 7 patients with IF. Using 50 pg/mL as the cutoff point, the sensitivity was 63% for detection of a tumor, and 100% of nontumor patients were excluded. Pentagastrin administration uniformly induced flushing and caused a rise in SP levels greater than 150 pg/mL in 5 of 10 patients with carcinoid tumors, 3 of 8 with noncarcinoid tumors, and 0 of 7 with IF, i.e. a SP rise of more than 100 pg/mL suggests a tumor. Administration of somatostatin (150 micrograms) 0.5 h before the pentagastrin abolished flushing in all carcinoid patients and reduced SP levels, but not into the normal range. Long term treatment with SMS significantly reduced flushing and lowered SP levels, but did not restore these to normal. We conclude that 90% of patients with carcinoid/noncarcinoid tumor have raised COOH-terminal SP levels. A basal level above 50 pg/mL or a pentagastrin-stimulated rise of more than 100 pg/mL distinguishes carcinoid from IF. The dissociation between SP concentrations and flushing suggests that SP may not be the only kinin involved in the flushing associated with carcinoid tumors.\r"

This study compared the neuronal removal of circulating epinephrine and norepinephrine by examination of the cardiac extractions or plasma clearances of [3H]norepinephrine and endogenous or 3H-labeled epinephrine in healthy subjects, patients with cardiovascular disorders, and subjects administered desipramine to block neuronal uptake. In rabbits the plasma clearances of [3H]epinephrine and [3H] norepinephrine by neuronal uptake and the formation of dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG) from simultaneously infused [3H] norepinephrine and epinephrine were compared. In normal patients 51 +/- 3% of plasma epinephrine was extracted during one pass through the coronary circulation, significantly less than the cardiac extraction of [3H]norepinephrine (78 +/- 1%). In patients with cardiovascular disorders extractions of epinephrine (34 +/- 3%) remained lower than those of [3H]norepinephrine (63 +/- 2%). After desipramine, cardiac extraction of epinephrine was reduced to 12 +/- 2% and [3H]norepinephrine to 20 +/- 3%. In subjects infused simultaneously with [3H]epinephrine and [3H] norepinephrine, desipramine reduced the cardiac extraction of [3H]epinephrine by 28 +/- 6%, significantly less than the 49 +/- 7% reduction in [3H]epinephrine extraction; the plasma clearance of [3H]epinephrine was reduced by 4 +/- 5%, significantly less than the 20 +/- 6% reduction in [3H]norepinephrine clearance. In rabbits desipramine reduced the plasma clearance of [3H] epinephrine by 18%, significantly less than the 42% reduction in [3H]norepinephrine clearance; production of DHPG from epinephrine was less than half the production of [3H]DHPG from [3H]norepinephrine. The above differences indicated that epinephrine was removed 44-64% less avidly than norepinephrine by uptake into and metabolism within sympathetic neurons.\r"

Each patient received 1 microCi/kg BW [125I]T3, iv. Blood samples were drawn at 10, 20, 30, and 60 min and 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 h, followed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and ethanol extraction of the serum samples. The parameters of T3 kinetics were obtained from the area under the disappearance curve of [125I]T3 from serum using a noncompartmental analysis. In five T4-treated patients, AMD induced a significant increase in serum T4 (P less than 0.02), serum free T4 (P less than 0.01), and serum TSH (P less than 0.02) and a marked decrease in serum T3 (P less than 0.005). Fractional turnover and MCRs were not affected by the drug. However, the extrathyroidal pool of T3 (P less than 0.02) and its degradation rate (P less than 0.001) were both significantly diminished. In the five T3-treated patients, AMD did not induce alterations in the parameters of T3 kinetics or in serum T3 and TSH concentrations. The data clearly establish that AMD does not affect the distribution and fractional removal of T3 from the plasma pool, but only its generation from T4 in extrathyroidal tissues. This conclusion does not rule out the possibility that the drug may interfere with a number of intracellular events dependent on T3 action which may be independent of T3 deiodination.\r"

We have used a monoclonal antibody recognizing the human GH receptor to visually identify and localize GH receptors in the human infant growth plate. Sternochondral cartilage was obtained at postmortem from infants dying of sudden infant death (n = 20), and either decalcified, fixed, and cut into longitudinal sections or digested with collagenase for monolayer culture of chondrocytes. Sections of cultured chondrocytes were stained immunocytochemically with a monoclonal antibody recognizing human GH receptor (MAb 263), using an avidin-biotin system. Sternochondral cartilage was also obtained at operation from adolescents undergoing sternochondroplasty. In infant tissue, GH receptor was identified in sections in chondrocytes of the proliferative and hypertrophic layers, in perichondrium, in osteocytes in new bone, and in hemopoietic precursor cells in marrow. Cultured chondrocytes showed heterogeneous staining for GH receptor. With prolonged culture from 5-8 days, the pattern of staining changed from individual cells to groups of cells. [125I]Human (h)GH showed specific binding to chondrocyte monolayer (0.6 +/- 0.3%), confirmed visually on emulsion autoradiography. In support of specificity of MAb263, it was able to displace [125I]hGH from monolayers by 35%. Adolescent cultured chondrocytes failed to demonstrate specific binding of [125I]hGH. We conclude that GH receptors are widely distributed in a range of mesenchyme cells in the human infant growth plate, including bone and hemopoietic precursors. The expression of these receptors appears to be maturation dependent in both intact tissue and culture, while they may no longer be expressed after the peak growth phase of puberty.\r"

The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of obesity on the suppression of GH by hyperglycemia and/or somatostatin. Plasma GH concentrations were measured in eight nondiabetic obese subjects and eight nonobese healthy controls during a 4-h hyperglycemic clamp. During the third hour synthetic cyclic somatostatin-14 was infused at the rate of 2.5 nmol/min. Baseline plasma GH levels were similar in obese and nonobese subjects (0.9 +/- 0.1 vs. 0.8 +/- 0.2 micrograms/L; mean +/- SEM). In the last 20 min of the glucose infusion period preceding somatostatin administration (100-120 min of the study) plasma GH averaged 0.8 +/- 0.1 micrograms/L in obese patients and 0.4 +/- 0.1 micrograms/L in control subjects (P less than 0.01), with a reduction of 6 +/- 5% in the former and 35 +/- 10% in the latter (P less than 0.01). In both groups somatostatin infusion did not result in a further decrease in plasma GH. Discontinuation of the somatostatin infusion resulted in a rise in both groups; the increase was higher in nonobese subjects (8.1 +/- 3.8 vs. 2.3 +/- 0.9 micrograms/L in the period 220-240 min; P = NS). These results suggest that in human obesity, hyperglycemia has a diminished inhibitory effect on GH secretion, and somatostatin administration has no additional effect in either obese or nonobese nondiabetic subjects.\r"

When the patient's serum was examined it was found to contain a binding component that bound both C-terminal and PTH-(1-84).

The presence of circulating anti-PTH immunoglobulin M explains the apparently high PTH concentrations measured by RIA. The antibodies occurred spontaneously.

The only observed changes were a decrease in the percentage of B-cells and a transient increased reactivity to phytohemagglutinin stimulation.

  ".W": "Dual energy radiography (DER) is a new technique for non-invasive measurement of vertebral bone mineral density, which because of its high precision (1%), is particularly suitable for prospective analyses of time-related changes in bone mass. However, we recently found that DER is less sensitive to demineralization of trabecular bone than quantitative computed tomography (QCT). Since the compact bone of the posterior vertebral elements are included in the standard anterior-posterior DER (APDER), but not in QCT measurements, changes in trabecular bone mass attending the early phases of the osteoporotic process go undetected with the APDER technique due to the preponderance of cortical mass. Lateral-view DER (LDER), however, would minimize the contribution of vertebral compact bone as well as intra-abdominal calcifications to the trabecular component. To determine the in vivo short-term precision of the LDER method, we obtained three measurements in 18 healthy women, aged 23 to 76, during a four-week period. In addition, both APDER and LDER measurements were obtained in 53 healthy women, aged 23 to 80. The coefficient of variation for LDER was 2.8%. LDER density values accounted for a higher percentage of the variance of bone mass measurements with age (47%) than APDER (23%). Moreover, LDER declined significantly with age in both premenopausal (r = -0.42, p less than 0.05) and post-menopausal women (r = -0.50, p less than 0.005), whereas the age-related changes in APDER values failed to reach statistical significance in either group. The rate of bone loss with age in the premenopausal group was 0.45% per year with LDER, and 0.10% per year with APDER. Postmenopausal women showed a 0.78% loss of bone mass per year with LDER and 0.47% per year with APDER. The correlation between APDER and LDER was significant (r = 0.78, p less than 0.01). The accumulated data indicate that LDER may be a more appropriate technique than APDER for detecting the initial loss of vertebral trabecular bone that characterizes early subclinical osteoporotic syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "The time of appearance of relaxin in peripheral blood was determined in conceptive and non-conceptive cycles using a sensitive and specific double-antibody enzyme-linked immunoassay for human relaxin. For study of relaxin in early pregnancy, daily plasma samples were collected from women receiving artificial insemination of donor semen. The day of ovulation was determined by daily LH monitoring and ultrasound observation. In three conceptive cycles, relaxin was significantly elevated over baseline 9-10 days following the LH peak. Relaxin concentrations quickly rose over the next 15 days of observation to over 800 pg/ml. Relaxin was observed to increase 1 to 2 days prior to the first detectable increase in plasma hCG as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To compare the relaxin profile in conceptive cycles with normal luteal phase concentrations, relaxin was also measured in daily plasma samples collected from women contracepting with barrier methods, bilateral tubal ligation, or abstinence. A small but consistent rise in relaxin in the late luteal phase was observed in nine of eleven women, which began 6-9 days after the LH peak, averaged approximately 50 pg/ml, and was declining by the next menses. It is concluded that a small but measurable rise in plasma relaxin is associated with the normal luteal phase and that relaxin secretion is accelerated around the time that hCG is first detected in conceptive cycles. This acceleration of relaxin secretion which is associated with the onset of hCG may provide additional evidence for identification of transient early pregnancy.\r"

DNA and RNA of the cells were analyzed. DNA rearrangements of Ig JH gene loci were observed on both chromosomes. Cloning and DNA sequence analyses showed that one has a VHDHJH structure while the other has a DHJH structure. Southern hybridization with 5'-S mu and S gamma region-containing probes indicated germline configuration in the switch regions of mu and gamma genes on both chromosomes. To test expression of mu and gamma chains in the transformed cells at the mRNA-level, we used the polymerase chain reaction with three kinds of synthetic oligonucleotides as primers, one of which was part of the VH gene, while the other two were complementary to parts of C mu and C gamma genes. Sequence analysis of the amplified products showed that the same VHDHJH sequence is directly connected with either the C mu or the C gamma sequence in the mRNAs. This is direct evidence showing that in double isotype-bearing cells one VHDHJH exon in the transcript is alternatively spliced to C mu or C gamma without DNA rearrangement. The defect in this disease could be at the S-S recombination stage.\r"

  ".W": "Enhanced activity of the Na+/H+ antiporter is increasingly reported as a feature of cells from hypertensive subjects but the intracellular pH (ipH) dependency of its activity has not been examined. This study was designed to characterize the kinetic properties of the Na+/H+ antiporter in lymphocytes from adult spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and in those from age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) controls. Steady-state ipH, estimated from the measurement of BCECF fluorescence, was significantly lower in lymphocytes from the SHR than in those from WKY rats (7.09 +/- 0.02, n = 17 and 7.17 +/- 0.03, n = 19, respectively, P less than 0.025). The velocity of the antiporter determined from the product of the change in intracellular hydrogen ion concentration (i[H+]) by the buffering power measured concurrently at each starting ipH exhibited similar kinetic parameters in SHR and WKY cells: Vmax, 72 +/- 18 vs. 79 +/- 24 mM H+/30 s; pKH, 10.04 +/- 0.87 vs. 8.49 +/- 0.80; and Hill coefficient, 1.67 +/- 0.12 vs. 1.44 +/- 0.10, respectively. Likewise, no significant differences were observed between SHR and WKY cells in either the Km (29 +/- 5 and 32 +/- 8 mM, respectively) or the Vmax (6.0 +/- 1.0 and 5.53 +/- 1.0 mM H+/30 s, respectively) of the sodium activation curve. We conclude that while the ipH of SHR lymphocytes is reduced, the kinetic properties of the Na+/H+ antiporter are virtually identical in SHR and WKY lymphocytes. Consequently, a primary abnormality in the activity of this antiporter is not an inherent feature of lymphocytes from the SHR model of genetic hypertension. We propose that the activity of the Na+/H+ antiporter in SHR cells is apt to be increased as a result of reduction in ipH which dictates a higher set point in its steady-state activity.\r"

The contribution of either nephron hypertrophy or renal prostaglandin to these adjustments in nephron function was also explored. After acute Nx, single nephron GFR (SNGFR) was increased, on average by approximately 30%, due primarily to glomerular hyperperfusion and hypertension. The approximately 45% reduction in preglomerular and the constancy in postglomerular vascular resistances was entirely responsible for these adaptations. Although increases in fluid reabsorption in proximal convoluted tubules correlated closely with increase in SNGFR, the fractional fluid reabsorption between late proximal and early distal tubular segments was depressed. Nephron hypertrophy could not be substantiated based on either measurements of protein content in renal tissue homogenates or morphometric analysis of proximal convoluted tubules. However, acute Nx was associated with increased urinary excretory rates per functional nephron for 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and TXB2. Prostaglandin synthesis inhibition did not affect function in control nephrons, but this maneuver was associated with normalization of glomerular and tubular function in remnant nephrons. The results suggest that enhanced synthesis of cyclooxygenase-dependent products is one of the earliest responses to Nx, and even before hypertrophy the pathophysiologic effects of prostaglandin may be important contributors to the adaptations in remnant nephron function.\r"

We studied monocytes from patients with tuberculosis and healthy skin test reactive controls for expression and function of IL 2 receptors (IL 2R). Depletion of adherent monocytes increased the IL 2 activity of supernatants of PPD-stimulated T cell cultures from patients by 30-fold. When cultured with purified IL 2, adherent cells from the patients depleted IL 2 activity by 66%. Monocytes from patients displayed IL 2R on their surface as evidenced by anti-Tac reactivity, and released soluble IL 2R into the medium during culture. The release of soluble IL 2R was augmented when monocytes were cultured with PPD. Finally, freshly isolated adherent monocytes from patients but not healthy individuals expressed the gene encoding Tac protein. Thus, blood monocytes from patients with tuberculosis express functional IL 2R constitutively. This property may be important in the immunoregulatory and effector function of mononuclear phagocytes during tuberculosis.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of replacing luminal chloride with gluconate on distal tubule bicarbonate transport were studied in vivo in normally fed rats, overnight-fasted rats, and rats made mildly alkalotic by administration of desoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA). In paired microperfusions of the same tubule with 0 or 55 mM Cl at 25 nl/min, net secretion of bicarbonate by distal tubules of fed rats was inhibited by chloride replacement. Zero chloride perfusion in DOCA rats also resulted in an inhibition of net bicarbonate secretion at 25 nl/min. In contrast, replacement of 45 mM chloride also perfused at 25 nl/min in fasted rats caused an increase in net bicarbonate reabsorption. To further characterize the effects of changes in luminal chloride, experiments were undertaken in fasted rats with 0, 45, and 100 mM chloride-containing solutions perfused at 8 and 25 nl/min. Perfusion with zero Cl resulted in net bicarbonate reabsorption at 8 nl/min that increased markedly with high flow, whereas bicarbonate reabsorption did not change significantly during perfusion at high flow with a 45-mM Cl perfusate. In marked contrast, perfusion with a 100-mM Cl solution resulted in only minimal bicarbonate reabsorption at 8 nl/min with significant secretion observed at high flow. Thus, chloride-free perfusates inhibit bicarbonate secretion and enhance bicarbonate reabsorption, while high chloride perfusates elicit net bicarbonate secretion in usually reabsorbing distal tubules.\r"

Little is known about the cellular control of such changes, but pleiotropic biochemical modulators such as fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) may be involved in this response and thus may be regulated in response to such stimuli. We examined the regulation of FGF expression in an in vivo model of exercise conditioning previously shown to exhibit vascular growth and fast to slow fiber conversion. FGFs were extracted by heparin-affinity chromatography from extensor digitorum longus muscles of adult rabbits subjected to chronic motor nerve stimulation at 10 Hz. Growth factor activity (expressed in growth factor units [GFUs]) of muscle stimulated for 3 and 21 d was assayed by [3H]thymidine incorporation in 3T3 fibroblasts and compared with that present in the contralateral unstimulated muscle. A small increase in heparin-binding mitogenic activity was observed as early as 3 d of stimulation, and by 21 d mitogenic activity increased significantly when normalized to either wet weight (stimulated, 287 +/- 61 GFU/g; unstimulated, 145 +/- 39 GFU/g) or to protein (stimulated, 5.3 +/- 1.1 GFU/mg; unstimulated, 2.2 +/- 0.6 GFU/mg) (+/- SE, P less than 0.05). Western analysis demonstrated increased amounts of peptides with immunological identity to acidic and basic FGFs in stimulated muscle. The increase in FGF content observed in this study is synchronous with neovascularization, myoblast proliferation, and fast to slow fiber type conversion previously shown in this model. These results demonstrate that increased expression of FGFs is associated with motor nerve stimulation and increased tonic contractile activity of skeletal muscle, and suggests that these proteins may play a regulatory role in the cellular changes that occur during exercise conditioning.\r"

We report here the use of an in situ binding technique to demonstrate specific MSH receptors in surgical specimens of human melanoma. The distribution and binding properties of specific MSH binding sites were determined by autoradiography and image analysis after incubation of frozen tumor tissue sections with a biologically active, radiolabeled analogue of alpha-MSH, [125I]iodo-Nle4, D-Phe7-alpha-MSH ([125I]NDP-MSH). In melanoma specimens from 11 patients, 3 showed high levels of specific binding, 5 showed low levels, and in 3 patients specific binding of [125I]NDP-MSH was not detectable. Specific MSH binding sites were present in melanoma cells, but not in adjacent connective or inflammatory tissues. Melanotropins, including alpha-MSH, NDP-MSH, and ACTH, inhibited [125I]NDP-MSH binding in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas unrelated peptides (somatostatin and substance P) did not. The apparent affinity of alpha-MSH for this binding site was in the nanomolar range (EC50 = 2 X 10(-9) M for inhibition of [125I]NDP-MSH binding in situ), similar to that recently described for the murine melanoma receptor. In one patient, analysis of multiple intratumor samples and tumors excised on three separate occasions revealed high levels of specific MSH binding in all samples. These results suggest that endogenous melanotropins may modulate the activities of human melanoma cells in vivo.\r"

The purpose of these studies was to determine if HCMV IE gene products also modulate expression of a monocyte/macrophage-derived gene, interleukin 1 (IL-1) beta. Steady-state cell-derived IL-1 beta mRNA was increased in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated THP-1 cells when transfected with the HCMV IE1 + 2 genes, when compared to cells transfected with a control DNA. LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells also exhibited approximately 30-fold higher IL-1 CAT activity when cotransfected with IE1 + 2 than was observed for the same cells cotransfected with IL-1 CAT and a control plasmid containing the IE promoter alone. LPS increased IL-1 CAT activity in the absence of HCMV genes only twofold. IE1, by itself, increased IL-1 CAT activity in LPS-stimulated cells, whereas, IE2, by itself, caused no change in IL-1 CAT activity. These studies show that the IE1 gene of HCMV can regulate IL-1 beta gene expression. The observations further suggest that some of the inflammatory processes associated with HCMV infection may be due to an effect of HCMV IE genes on cell-derived genes, such as the IL-1 beta gene.\r"

  ".W": "We assessed the effect of alcohol, before and after autonomic blockade, on left ventricular (LV) performance in conscious dogs. 10 animals were instrumented to determine LV volume from ultrasonic LV internal dimensions and measure LV pressure with a micromanometer. The animals were studied in the conscious state after full recovery from the operation. Blood alcohol was undetectable before and 67 +/- 14 mg/dl (mean +/- SD) at 20 min after alcohol administration. In response to alcohol, the LV systolic pressure was reduced slightly, the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased slightly. The maximum time derivative of LV pressure (dP/dtmax) and stroke volume were decreased. The end-systolic volume (VES), as well as effective arterial elastance, were significantly increased. There was no significant change in heart rate. Variably loaded pressure-volume loops were generated by acute caval occlusion before, immediately, and 20 min after the intravenous infusion of alcohol (0.2 g/kg). Three measures of LV performance were derived from these variably loaded pressure-volume loops: the end-systolic pressure-volume relation; the stroke work-end-diastolic volume relation; and maximum dP/dt-VED relation. The slopes of all three relations were significantly decreased in response to alcohol, and all three relations were shifted toward the right, indicating a depression of LV contractile performance. Similar, but greater depressions of LV performance with alcohol were observed following autonomic blockade. LV performance was restored by infusing dobutamine. We conclude that mildly intoxicating levels of alcohol (blood concentration less than 100 mg/dl) are capable of producing LV contractile depression in conscious animals, which is more marked after autonomic blockade. This suggests that patients with impaired LV function should avoid even small amounts of alcohol.\r"

  ".W": "The in vivo alterations in organ-specific substrate processing and endogenous mediator production induced by endotoxin were investigated in healthy volunteers. An endotoxin bolus (20 U/kg) produced increased energy expenditure, hyperglycemia, hypoaminoacidemia, and an increase in circulating free fatty acids. These changes included increased peripheral lactate and free fatty acid output, along with increased peripheral uptake of glucose. Coordinately, there were increased splanchnic uptake of oxygen, lactate, amino acids, and free fatty acids, and increased splanchnic glucose output. There were no changes in circulating glucagon, or insulin and transient changes in epinephrine and cortisol were insufficient to explain the metabolic changes. Plasma cachectin levels peaked 90 min after the endotoxin infusion, and hepatic venous (HV) cachectin levels (peak 250 +/- 50 pg/ml) were consistently higher than arterial levels (peak 130 +/- 30 pg/ml, P less than 0.05 vs. HV). No interleukin 1 alpha or 1 beta was detected in the circulation. Circulating interleukin 6, measured by B.9 hybridoma proliferation, peaked 2 h after the endotoxin challenge (arterial, 16 +/- 2 U/ml; HV, 21 +/- 3 U/ml). The net cachectin efflux (approximately 7 micrograms) from the splanchnic organs demonstrates that these tissues are a major site for production of this cytokine. Hence, splanchnic tissues are likely influenced in a paracrine fashion by regional cachectin production and may also serve as a significant source for systemic appearance of this cytokine.\r"

Stereological point counting was performed to measure the percent area occupied by Monastral blue-labeled blood vessels as a means of quantifying the increase in vascular permeability in tracheal whole mounts. Hypertonic saline aerosols (3.6-14.4% NaCl) increased vascular permeability in a dose-dependent fashion compared with 0.9% NaCl. Thus, the area density of Monastral blue-labeled vessels after inhalation of 3.6% NaCl was greater (21.2 +/- 3.5% mean +/- SEM, n = 5) than after 0.9% NaCl aerosol (3.3 +/- 0.9%, n = 5, P less than 0.5). The neutral endopeptidase inhibitor phosphoramidon (2.5 mg/kg, i.v.) significantly potentiated the increase of vascular permeability caused by 3.6% NaCl. Desensitization of sensory nerve endings by pretreatment with capsaicin markedly reduced the usual increase in vascular permeability caused by 3.6% NaCl, but the increase in vascular permeability induced by aerosolized substance P (10(-4) M) was unchanged. These findings suggest that hypertonic saline increases vascular permeability in the rat trachea by stimulating the release of neuropeptides from sensory nerves.\r"

In this investigation, we have demonstrated that IL-4 inhibited the IL-2-induced differentiation of large granular lymphocytes (LGL) into LAK effectors by a mechanism involving, at least in part, an increase in LGL intracellular cAMP levels. In contrast, with its capacity to induce cAMP accumulation in resting LGL, IL-4 had a very negligible effect on LAK activity induction, and cAMP levels increase in LGL that had been preincubated with IL-2. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of IL-4 on LAK activity generation also correlated with a marked decrease in N-CBZ-L-lysine thiobenzylester esterase activity, with an inhibition of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) mRNA expression and TNF production by IL-2-stimulated LGL. These results strongly suggest that complex signaling processes could be ascribed to the dual activities of cytokines and their interplay in LAK promotion.\r"

After 90 min of lobar hepatic ischemia, TNF was measurable during the reperfusion period in the plasma of all 14 experimental animals, with levels peaking between 9 and 352 pg/ml. Endotoxin was undetectable in the plasma of these animals. Pulmonary injury, as evidenced by a neutrophilic infiltrate, edema and intra-alveolar hemorrhage developed after hepatic reperfusion. The neutrophilic infiltrate was quantitated using a myeloperoxidase (MPO) assay; this demonstrated a significant increase in MPO after only 1 h of reperfusion. Anti-TNF antiserum pretreatment significantly reduced the pulmonary MPO after hepatic reperfusion. After a 12-h reperfusion period, there was histologic evidence of intra-alveolar hemorrhage and pulmonary edema. Morphometric assessment showed that pretreatment with anti-TNF antiserum was able to completely inhibit the development of pulmonary edema. Liver injury was quantitated by measuring serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase which showed peaks at 3 and 24 h. Anti-TNF antiserum pretreatment was able to significantly reduce both of these peak elevations. These data show that hepatic ischemia/reperfusion results in TNF production, and that this TNF is intimately associated with pulmonary and hepatic injury.\r"

  ".W": "Because of their paternal antigens, the fetus and placenta may be considered an allograft in the maternal host. Local properties of the maternal-fetal interface, the placenta and decidua basalis, are important in preventing maternal immunologic rejection of the fetoplacental allograft. However, the exact nature of these local properties remains a fundamental unsolved problem in immunology. We now report that three macrophage functions were inhibited by the substratum formed by monolayers of decidual stromal cells via a novel pathway. Solid-phase inhibitors blocked macrophage adhesion, spreading, and lysis of tumor necrosis factor-alpha-resistant P815 mastocytoma tumor cells. Inhibition was not solely attributable to an inability of macrophages to adhere to decidual substratum because there were differences in macrophage functions on this surface versus polyhema where no adherence occurred. Because macrophages play a central role in cell-mediated immunity, including allograft rejection, inhibiting their function in the decidua basalis may help prevent maternal antifetal responses.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that the middle third of the rat inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD-2) secretes protons despite the absence of intercalated cells, the cell thought to secrete protons in other portions of the collecting duct. A new cell, the IMCD cell, is the predominant cell in IMCD-2. The mechanism responsible for base exit in the IMCD cell was characterized by measuring cell pH of isolated perfused tubules with 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein. Reduction of bath HCO3- caused a significant and reversible decrease in cell pH, whereas a similar change in luminal HCO3- had a significantly smaller effect, indicating that the HCO3-/H+ permeability of the basolateral membrane is much larger than the apical membrane. The rate of cell acidification induced by reduction in bath HCO3-, a measure of basolateral HCO3- transport, was significantly decreased in the absence of bath and lumen Cl. Decreases in bath Cl caused a significant and reversible increase in cell pH, which was not changed significantly by complete removal of Na from perfusate and bath, but was significantly inhibited by basolateral 4',5'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid. A chemical voltage clamp did not inhibit the rate of cell alkalinization after bath Cl removal, indicating that Cl-/HCO3- exchange is not via parallel Cl and HCO3- conductances. Cell pH was measured in single cells by low-light-level imaging to show that most cells contain the chloride-dependent HCO3- pathway. We conclude that the rat IMCD cell possesses a basolateral Na-independent CL-/HCO3- exchanger which may serve as the base exit step for transepithelial proton secretion.\r"

These anti-LM antibodies were different from anti-liver/kidney microsomes (anti-LKM) 1 or 2 autoantibodies which have been previously described. Sera recognized a single 53,000 = Mr polypeptide in human liver microsomes as judged by immunoblotting, and the target antigen was identified as cytochrome P-450IA2 (P-450IA2) by (a) comparison of immunoblotting patterns with anti-human P-450IA2 and anti-rat P-450IA2 and with five anti-LM sera, and (b) specific immunoinhibition of microsomal ethoxyresorufin and phenacetin O-deethylation activities (both P-450IA2 supported reactions) by anti-LM antibodies. Finally, purified human P-450IA2 was recognized by these anti-LM sera. The anti-LM antibodies are specific for the disease because none of the other antisera tested behaved in the same manner as anti-LM, even those from patients treated with dihydralazine and without hepatic disease. A possible role of P-450IA2 in the metabolism of dihydralazine was suggested by competitive inhibition of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase observed in microsomal incubations. Thus, a new example is presented in which a cytochrome P-450 may be a target for autoantibodies in drug-induced hepatitis.\r"

Studies were performed in rats 14 d after injection of rabbit serum (n = 6), NTS in the absence (n = 6), or presence, of a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, ibuprofen (n = 6) or a thromboxane A2 (TxA2) receptor antagonist, L-670,596 (n = 5). A mesangial macrophage/monocyte infiltrate was noted with equal intensity in all NTS-treated rats. Glomerular generation rates of prostaglandin (PG) E2, PGF2a, and TxA2 in nephritic kidneys were dramatically increased as compared to controls. 2 wk after NTS, there was an increase in glomerular plasma flow rate (SNPF), attainment of filtration pressure disequilibrium, and augmentation of net transcapillary hydraulic pressure difference (delta P). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), however, was reduced, due to a marked fall in the glomerular capillary ultrafiltration coefficient (Kf). Cyclooxygenase inhibition resulted in normalization of glomerular eicosanoid generation rates, amelioration of proteinuria, afferent vasoconstriction, and normalization of SNPF, delta P, Kf, and GFR. Selective antagonism of TxA2 also led to preservation of Kf, but was without effect on SNPF, thereby leading to elevated values for GFR. Thus, in contrast to the pathophysiologic role of arachidonate-lipoxygenase products in the early heterologous phase, PG-mediated vasodilatation and TxA2-induced reductions in Kf and GFR underlie glomerular functional changes during autologous mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis.\r"

Exposure of confluent bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cell monolayers to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) resulted in concentration-dependent (10(-8)-10(-6) M) increases in PKC activity and in the transendothelial flux of 125I-albumin. Exposure of the endothelium to 1-oleoyl 2-acetyl glycerol (OAG) also increased the transendothelial flux of 125I-albumin in a concentration-dependent manner. Neither 4 alpha-phorbol didecanoate nor 1-mono-oleoyl glycerol, which do not activate PKC, altered permeability. The increase in 125I-albumin permeability induced by PMA was inhibited by 25 microM H7 (a PKC inhibitor), but not by the control compound HA1004 (25 microM). After 16 h of exposure to PMA, 125I-albumin permeability returned to baseline and a significant reduction in cytosolic PKC activity was noted. Further challenge with PMA at this time resulted in no significant increase in PKC activity indicating downregulation of the enzyme; moreover, this PMA challenge did not increase endothelial permeability. Exposure of endothelial monolayers to phospholipase C (PLC), which increases membrane phosphatidylinositide turnover, or to alpha-thrombin also induced concentration-dependent activation of PKC and increases in 125I-albumin endothelial permeability. The thrombin- and PLC-induced permeability increases were inhibited by H7, but not by HA1004. The activation of endothelial PKC directly by PMA or OAG and by PLC and alpha-thrombin increases the transendothelial albumin permeability, indicating that PKC activation is an important signal transduction pathway by which extracellular mediators increase endothelial macromolecular transport.\r"

All trans-retinoic acid inhibited human red cell membrane Ca2(+)-ATPase activity in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner (10(-8) to 10(-4) M). In contrast, retinol, retinal, 13-cis-retinoic acid and the benzene ring analogue of retinoic acid did not alter enzyme activity. Purified calmodulin (up to 500 ng/ml, 3 X 10(-8) M) added to red cell membranes, in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of retinoic acid, only partially restored Ca2(+)-ATPase activity. 125I-Calmodulin bound to red cell membranes was displaced by unlabeled retinoic acid (50% reduction at 10(-8) M retinoic acid), as effectively as by unlabeled calmodulin. Another calmodulin-stimulable enzyme, bovine brain cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, was unaffected by retinoic acid. 8-Anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid bound to calmodulin, studied spectrofluorometrically, was not displaced by retinoic acid. Thus, retinoic acid inhibits calmodulin binding to red cell membranes, reducing calmodulin-stimulable Ca2(+)-ATPase activity. Retinoic acid does not directly interact with calmodulin, but rather exerts its effect by interfering with calmodulin access to the membrane enzyme. These effects occur at physiological concentrations of the retinoid.\r"

  ".W": "A large percentage of vascular reconstructions, endarterectomies, and angioplasties fail postoperatively due to thrombosis and restenosis. Many of these failures are thought to result from an inability of the vascular endothelium to adequately regenerate and cover the denuded area. After balloon catheter denudation of the rat carotid artery, regrowth of endothelium ceases after approximately 6 wk, leaving a large area devoid of endothelium. Here we show that this cessation of reendothelialization can be overcome by the systemic administration of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Administration of 120 micrograms bFGF over an 8-h period caused a highly significant increase in the replication rate of endothelial cells at the leading edge of 38.5 vs. 2.1% in controls, and, when given over a longer period of time (12 micrograms daily for 12 d), resulted in a significant increase in the extent of endothelial outgrowth onto the denuded surface. Furthermore, total regrowth could be achieved within 10 wk after balloon catheter denudation when 12 micrograms bFGF was injected twice per week for a period of 8 wk. Endothelium in unmanipulated arteries responded to bFGF with a significant increase in replication, but no increase in endothelial cell density was observed in these arteries. These data demonstrate that bFGF can act as a potent mitogen for vascular endothelial cells in vivo, and add considerably to our understanding of the mechanism underlying endothelial repair after in vivo vascular injuries.\r"

We found a substantial uptake of 35S-labeled glutathione by the rat brain using the carotid artery injection technique. The brain uptake index of glutathione with and without an irreversible gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase inhibitor, acivicin, was similar. No significant differences in the regional uptake of labeled glutathione were found in rats pretreated with acivicin. The brain uptake index of tracer glutathione was similar to that of cysteine tracer and was lower than that of phenylalanine. The transport of oxidized glutathione (glutathione disfulfide) across the blood-brain barrier was not significantly different from that of sucrose, an impermeable marker. Brain radioactivity 15 s after carotid artery injection of labeled glutathione to rats pretreated with acivicin was predominantly in the form of glutathione. The in vivo glutathione uptake was saturable with an apparent Km of 5.84 mM. Amino acids, amino acid analogues, and other compounds [cysteine, phenylalanine, glutathione disulfide, gamma-glutamylglutamate, gamma-glutamyl p-nitroanilide, 2-aminobicyclo(2,2,1)heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH)] did not affect glutathione transport. Our data suggest that glutathione is transported across the blood-brain barrier by a saturable and specific mechanism.\r"

Using a B-lymphoblastoid cell line (B-LCL) established from a CD11/CD18-deficient patient and cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HEC), we investigated the CD11/CD18-independent mechanism(s) of lymphocyte adherence to endothelium. Monoclonal antibodies directed to the alpha 4 polypeptide (CD49d) and the beta 1 polypeptide (CD29) of the lymphocyte VLA-4 integrin receptor (CD49d/CD29), and to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) on the endothelial cell significantly inhibited the adherence of the CD11/CD18-deficient B-LCL to untreated HEC and to HEC treated with recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-alpha. We suggest that the interaction of the lymphocyte receptor VLA-4 with the endothelial ligand VCAM-1 induced by cytokines at sites of inflammation or immune reaction represents a CD11/CD18-independent pathway of lymphocyte emigration.\r"

To evaluate the relative contribution of the two PDGF genes to this process, PDGF-A and -B gene transcription rates and mRNA levels were examined in normal and IPF alveolar macrophages. While normal alveolar macrophages constitutively transcribe both PDGF-A and PDGF-B genes, LPS stimulation increases the transcription of both genes more than threefold. Importantly, IPF alveolar macrophages spontaneously transcribe both genes at a rate similar to that observed for normal macrophages after in vitro stimulation. Consistent with the transcription data, normal macrophages contain mRNA for both PDGF-A and -B, but PDGF-B mRNA is 10-fold more abundant. Strikingly, in IPF, both PDGF-A and -B mRNA levels were markedly increased, with persistence of the 10-fold dominance of PDGF-B mRNA. Thus, the exaggerated release of PDGF by IPF alveolar macrophages is likely modulated by upregulated PDGF gene transcription rates and concomitantly increased mRNA levels and the persistent 10-fold excess of B greater than A PDGF mRNA suggests that the PDGF released by alveolar macrophages is likely mostly of the potent B-chain homodimeric form.\r"

To evaluate this possibility, we examined histologic sections of DMN that had been removed from patients in three groups. Group A consisted of 17 subjects with a past history of melanoma; group B comprised 79 subjects with DMN and a family history of melanoma in first-degree relatives; group C consisted of 64 subjects who were unrelated spouses of members of groups A and B. For each group, sections of DMN were initially selected on the basis of architectural atypia as defined by the National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference. All biopsy material was then further evaluated for four histologic features suggested to be discriminatory for DMN associated with increased melanoma risk; the features are degree of junctional activity, irregularity of melanocytic nests, presence of dusty melanin, and size of melanocytic nuclei. A subjective rating was given for each on a 0 to 3 scale of increasing severity. Three pathologists individually rated the specimens without knowledge of the patient group. The means of the individual observer cumulative scores of the four histologic criteria for each biopsy specimen and the average of these means from the three observers exhibited a trend to increasing values from groups C to A, but none of the differences reached statistical significance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirteen reactions to the aqueous materials and 10 to the petrolatum-based materials were observed. Irritant reactions were infrequent, and about half the reactions were deemed relevant.

Thirteen persons were identified as allergic, but three others were sensitized by the patch test procedure. Sensitization as not observed in tests with aqueous or petrolatum-based substance at a concentration of 100 ppm, and this concentration appears to be the best compromise between safety and sensitive detection of allergy. Use tests are helpful but not infallible as a guide in establishing relevance with methylchloroisothiazolinone-methylisothiazolinone.

  ".W": "The prevalence of benign pigmented nevi in a group of 187 children, aged 8 or 9 years, was determined for each of 31 anatomic sites. Information on possible associated factors was obtained from the children's parents with a standard interview questionnaire. Pale skin color was found to be associated with a higher prevalence of nevi. A comparison of these data with recent data from Australia supports the hypotheses that (1) the number of nevi is a risk factor for melanoma and (2) groups at high risk of melanoma may be formed in childhood.\r"

Amine solutions of 0.18 mol/L were applied after anthralin application to normal forearm skin. Inflammation was measured with the use of Harpenden calipers by the increase in skin thickness at 48 hours. Inflammation was reduced by 66% to 95% with the use of nine different amines. There was no overall correlation between the inhibiting effect and either amine basicity or octanol/water partition coefficient. However, within each of the series of primary, secondary, and tertiary alkylamines there appeared to be some correlation between inhibitory effect and alkyl chain size, which may reflect differences in transdermal flux. Some of these amines are used in cosmetics and skin cleansers and could help reduce the inflammation that accompanies anthralin therapy for psoriasis.\r"

  ".W": "Sunscreens absorb solar radiation and block the cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D3. Because of this property, we tested sunscreens as a research tool for photodependent reactions. The concept was evaluated by determining the segmental body contributions to vitamin D3 production. Twenty-seven healthy, untanned white persons with skin type III applied a sunscreening agent to selected body areas (head and neck, arms, trunk, or legs) to block UVB absorption. Control groups comprised subjects who either covered the whole body with, or did not apply, sunscreen. Serum vitamin D3 was determined 1 hour before and 24 hours after exposure to a suberythemic dose of UVB light (27 millijoule/cm2). Basal vitamin D3 levels were similar among the different groups (mean +/- standard error for the entire population: 2.8 +/- 0.7 ng/ml). Segmental contribution to the UVB-stimulated cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D3 appeared to be largely a function of surface area. Serum vitamin D3 increased significantly (p less than 0.05) in subjects exposing the trunk (13.7 +/- 3.2 ng/ml), legs (11.2 +/- 3.2 ng/ml), and entire body (12.6 +/- 2.8 ng/ml). In subjects exposing the head and neck or arms, the post-UVB vitamin D3 level was higher than the basal level (5.8 +/- 4.0 and 4.5 +/- 2.2 ng/ml), but the difference was not significant (p greater than 0.5). Whole body application of sunscreen completely blocks the vitamin D3 response to UVB. We conclude that short-term (single) application of sunscreens may be used as a simple complementary technique for the evaluation of photodependent reactions in physiologic and pathologic conditions.\r"

Preliminary tests were performed to establish the specificity and sensitivity of the methods. Based on the results, the quantities of stain required to detect each marker were determined. Blood samples from 24 staff donors of known phenotype were aged at room temperature and at 37 degrees C in the dried stain and liquid forms. In addition, 192 stains from cases 1 to 7 months old and 76 staff-donor stains from 1 1/2 to 10 years old were tested in dried stain form. The known sensitivity of the ELISA technique was exploited by deliverately testing a decreased quantity of antigen. As control stains were aged beyond the detectable limits of sensitivity, results consistently showed an almost simultaneous success or failure to detect Km(1) and Km(3). This indicates that the interpretive criteria established for ELISA are sufficiently demanding to eliminate the danger of reporting false Km(-1) results but true Km(3) results.\r"

A broad range of gene markers at 41 gene loci, including 11 red blood cell markers, 5 human lymphocyte antigen (HLA) types, 12 serum protein markers, 5 red cell enzyme markers, and 8 salivary markers were evaluated before and after BMT over 2 months. As a result, 9 out of 41 gene loci of genetic markers in recipients were transformed into the donor type. BMT between family members may lead to transformation of gene markers, but within a pattern compatible with family inheritance patterns, and no genetic paradox will be found in later surveys of familial genetic relationships. However, in a personal identification system in forensic medicine using genetic markers as an index, the appearance of a phenotype incompatible with a blood relationship is possible after BMT with a non-blood-relative donor. This result is similar to the inheritance pattern observed after artificial insemination by a donor's semen (AID), a more complete out-of-family cross.\r"

The standards were mounted on carbon planchettes as either pure crystals or crystals embedded in epoxy resin. Ten different samples of each embedded and non-embedded standard were analyzed in a JEOL 100 CX electron microscope interfaced with a Kevex 8000 EDXA system using a lithium-drifted silicon detector and a multichannel analyzer. The Ca/P ratios were determined by calculating both net peak intensities without matrix corrections and atomic kappa-ratios using the MAGIC V computer program with ZAF correction factors for quantitative analysis. There was such extensive absorption of phosphorus X-rays in standards embedded in an epoxy matrix that the observed Ca/P ratios were statistically compatible with four different standards ranging in theoretical Ca/P ratios from 1.0 to 1.67. Although the non-embedded crystals showed a greater separation in the Ca/P ratios, both methods of preparation produced serious flaws in analysis. Direct application of the discovery of this caveat to the identification of suspected bone fragments for forensic science purposes is discussed.\r"

A method for extraction and analysis of such residues is presented. The hair is extracted using a methanol/water mixture, and the extract is analyzed by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The detector system consists of two ultraviolet (UV) detectors connected in series. The method is nondestructive to hair and is sensitive enough to be applied to a single hair 5 to 10 cm in length. Residues from hair balsams are analyzed by this technique as well. The use of this method in forensic science examination of human head hair is demonstrated.\r"

The mainstream smoke contained methamphetamine (14.5% of the initial methamphetamine), phenylacetone (3.1%). N-cyanomethylmethamphetamine (1.9%), trans-beta-methylstyrene (1.7%), N-formylmethamphetamine (1.5%), and other products (each less than 1%). The amount of each pyrolysis product in the sidestream smoke was less than that in the mainstream smoke by a factor of over 5, except for methamphetamine (10.5%) and N-formylmethamphetamine (1.4%). The formation mechanism of these products was investigated, by use of a pyrolyzer, from the standpoint of the material, pyrolysis temperature, and pyrolysis atmosphere. Although several products (for example, dimethylamphetamine and trans-beta-methylstyrene) were formed by thermal self-decomposition of methamphetamine alone, most of the products, except N-cyanomethylmethamphetamine, were formed chiefly by the thermal reaction of methamphetamine with cigarette components. The formation of N-cyanomethylmethamphetamine required air and a high pyrolysis temperature. Air and a high pyrolysis temperature generally accelerated the formation of the pyrolysis products.\r"

Over this four-year period there was a significant (P less than 0.01) increase each year in evidence of recent cocaine use in this population, reaching 38.3% of all tested cases in 1987. Much of this increase was accounted for by homicide victims, especially those in their third or fourth decade of life, of whom 58.6 and 56.3%, respectively, tested positive in 1987. There was a large increase in recent cocaine use in teenage homicide victims in 1987, having previously changed little from 1984 to 1986. In victims of drug abuse, recent cocaine use also increased significantly (p less than 0.01) each year, reaching 47.6% in 1987, generally in combination with heroin. Although deaths attributed solely to cocaine were not as common, they also increased significantly each year from 4 in 1984 to 25 in 1987. Compared with the general population, those who use cocaine in Wayne County are more likely than those who do not to die prematurely, often as a result of violence.\r"

The differences in clinical presentation between our cases and most published series is striking and may be explained by shorter duration and no treatment. Each case contained the characteristic histology of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Ischemic injury to the heart and conduction system was the most likely mechanism of sudden death.

Previously described methods of estimating stature from segments of long bones have not proved satisfactory because of the difficulty involved in identifying the precise anatomical landmarks by which they are defined. This study represents an assessment of the feasibility of stature estimation from fragmentary femora. A sample of 200 males and females, blacks and whites (total sample = 800), was obtained from the Terry Collection. New regression equations for the estimation of maximum femur length and stature from three well-defined and easy-to-measure segments of the femur are presented. This technique represents an improvement over methods currently in use for estimating stature from femur fragments; the location of the anatomical landmarks and the accuracy of the prediction are enhanced. The applicability of these formulae to a modern forensic sample is addressed with regard to secular trends in stature increase and changes in body segment proportions.\r"

In May 1988, in nearby Hillsborough County, police confiscated a very similar skull from another private citizen, who allegedly had found it in an abandoned house. Aside from slight color differences between the six found in Pinellas County and the one found in Hillsborough County, the skulls are virtually identical in their osteological characteristics and condition and in the vital statistics derived from each. Each skull is as clean and dry as those typically sold by commercial scientific supply outlets in the United States. Each is edentulous (primarily premortem), between approximately 20 and 60 years of age at death, and morphologically Asian. Five of the seven are morphologically male, one is morphologically female, and one is a mosaic with respect to gender-related features. Police, medical examiners, coroners, and forensic anthropologists should be aware of such \"souvenir\" specimens, in the event that they encounter similar skulls. Discriminant function analyses for race and sex yield considerably conflicting results, which underscores the need for using extreme caution when interpreting forensic science estimates based on such techniques.\r"

The authors report one fatal case associated with cocaine-alcohol overdose. The postmortem examination demonstrated the existence of segmental intestinal ischemia.

Indeed, it has been suggested that stress factors of importance for depressive symptoms may be irrelevant for major depression. We report results based on a large sample of physically disabled and nondisabled adults that contradict this suggestion. The physically disabled show seriously elevated rates of both depressive symptomatology and major depressive disorder. Subgroup analyses confirmed the finding on depressive symptomatology within all age-gender groupings and the finding on major depression for young and middle-aged men and women but not for the aged. It is argued that these findings can be attributed to differences in chronic stress associated with disability status. We conclude that chronic stress represents a significant risk factor with respect to both depressive symptomatology and major depressive disorder.\r"

Depressed and psychiatric control subjects were inpatients on acute care psychiatric units at three general hospitals. The nonpsychiatric control subjects were hospital employees. The inpatient sample was selected on the basis of DSM-III diagnosis and Beck Depression Inventory scores. Endogenous and reactive components of depression were assessed by the Endogenous-Reactive Checklist and the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia. Attitudes and attributions were measured by the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale and the Attribution Questionnaire. Depressed patients endorsed significantly more dysfunctional attitudes than did nondepressed psychiatric control subjects and nonpsychiatric control subjects. Depressed and psychiatric control subjects also made more global attributions for certain kinds of undesirable events than did nonpsychiatric control subjects; stability and internality of attributions did not differ among groups. Further, more endogenous depression was associated with more dysfunctional attitudes, whereas the more reactive the depression, the more internal, global, and stable the attributions. Our findings suggest that dysfunctional attitudes are characteristic of at least some depressive mood states, particularly those high in endogenous symptoms, whereas it remains unclear whether certain attributions are characteristic of general psychopathology or, in the case of internal attributions, are so specific to reactive depressions that group differences are minimized.\r"

Low cortisol in PTSD did not seem to be related to the presence or absence of major depressive disorder or to overall psychiatric symptomatology as assessed by the sum Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale score.

Formal thought disorder, positive symptoms, and negative symptoms were positively intercorrelated. Schneiderian first-rank symptoms were predictors of better outcome and they were preceded by premorbid obsessive traits and lack of premorbid psychopathic and histrionic traits. These latter traits were predictive of early onset, nonparanoid schizophrenia. It is postulated that personality dimensions can exert a pathoplastic influence through their capacity to promote adaptive mechanisms. Negative symptoms seem to represent a conglomerate of various phenomena, some of which were preceded by premorbid schizoid traits.\r"

Although family planning services have burgeoned in the United States and many other countries and the special concerns of mentally disordered and retarded persons have been well documented, organized efforts to include counseling on fertility regulation in mental health and in training programs have, with few exceptions, been sparse. Recent trends are discussed in terms of reported experience from the United States and Denmark. It is recommended that women of childbearing age in psychiatric facilities be given an opportunity to participate in programs offering screening for and treatment of gynecological conditions, as well as family planning counseling, before going on home leave or discharge. Such counseling should be adapted to a woman's emotional functioning, consider possible contraindications of specific contraceptive methods, and, to the extent possible, involve the partner. Ethical aspects need to be considered to avoid even the appearance of coercion. Similar opportunities should be provided for retarded persons seeking to achieve a satisfying sexual life. Surgical contraception and abortion are discussed within the context of patient rights, competence, and the desirability of avoiding unintended conceptions and reducing unwanted births that may engender further stress and psychosocial difficulties for the woman, the child, and society. The experience of former patients might well be useful in restructuring current service programs and priorities.\r"

Significant correlations were obtained between high Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores (greater than 10) and CSF nucleated cell count and protein levels. High Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (greater than 10) scores were positively correlated with CSF nucleated cell count and absolute CD4a counts. There were no statistically significant group differences with respect to mean laboratory values between high and low anxiety or depression subgroups. Serum viral titers to Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus were not correlated with anxiety or depression scores. These results suggest a complex relationship between CSF and systemic immune abnormalities and degree of anxiety and depression.\r"

In the second pardox, kappa will be higher with an asymmetrical rather than symmetrical imbalanced in marginal totals, and with imperfect rather than perfect symmetry in the imbalance. An adjustment that substitutes kappa max for kappa does not repair either problem, and seems to make the second one worse.\r"

Detailed reproductive histories were obtained from 436 women aged 20-54 with epithelial ovarian cancer newly diagnosed between December 1980 and December 1982, and from 3833 women aged 20-54 selected at random from the same geographic areas. Estimated relative risks of epithelial ovarian cancer were 0.6 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.5-0.8) for women who had ever been pregnant, 0.6 (95% CI 0.5-0.8) for women who had ever breast fed, and 0.5 (95% CI 0.5-0.7) for women who had ever used oral contraceptives. Logistic regression analysis revealed a strong trend in decreasing risk of epithelial ovarian cancer with increasing cumulative months of pregnancy; this effect was less pronounced in women aged 50-54 than in younger women. In contrast, a marked reduction in risk was associated with ever having breast fed or used oral contraceptives, while the decrease in risk from additional months of either of these exposures was less than that for pregnancy.\r"

Only 13% of men and 9% of women reported LTPA practice for more than 20 years and more than 3 hours/week; and 0.6% of men and 0.1% of women reported running or jogging for the same duration. LTPA practice was related to age, education, smoking status, and body mass index. Specifically, ex-smokers reported more frequently LTPA practice than current smokers. Despite the effort to identify aerobic exercise, results from the present analysis suggest that LTPA practice might be over-reported, as a result of a \"wish\" bias. Problems arising from the use of data on self-reported LTPA practice are discussed in detail.\r"

The reliability of the estimates of change is shown to depend primarily upon the length of time of observation, not the number of observations made. The estimated reliability coefficient for the change in MMSE (or DRS) at 6 months is 0.16 (or 0.08); at 2 years is 0.75 (or 0.57). The concept of signal-to-noise ratio is introduced to compare reliabilities in change scores.\r"

  ".U": "90270903\r", 
  ".W": "In a study of 411 patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) entered on therapeutic clinical trials between 1973 and 1987, we analyzed whether changes in the prognostic importance of pretreatment factors had occurred during the 14-year time period. After adjusting for other prognostic factors, brain involvement was associated with shorter survival in patients treated before December 1979 (P = .024) but not in patients treated thereafter (P = .54). The patients diagnosed before 1979 had brain metastases documented by radionuclide scan while computed cranial tomography (CCT) was more commonly used after 1979. Patients who had brain metastases diagnosed by radionuclide scan lived a shorter period of time than patients who had the diagnosis made by the more sensitive CCT scan (P = .031). In contrast, Cox proportional hazards modeling showed that liver metastases in patients were associated with shorter survival in patients treated after 1979 (P = .0007) but not in patients treated before then (P = .30). A larger proportion of patients had a routine liver biopsy before 1979 than after 1979 when more patients had the liver staged with less sensitive imaging studies and biochemical parameters. Patients with SCLC whose cancer was confined to the thorax but had medical or anatomic contraindications to intensive chest radiotherapy had similar survival compared with patients with limited-stage SCLC who were treated with combination chemotherapy alone (P = .68). From these data we conclude: (1) the sensitivity of the staging procedures used can affect the impact on survival of cancer involvement of a given site; and (2) patients with cancer confined to their chest with medical or anatomic contraindications to chest radiotherapy do not have a shorter survival than patients with limited-stage disease treated with chemotherapy alone.\r"

Nausea and vomiting, phlebitis, and stomatitis were minimal or absent at each dose, but dose-limiting granulocytopenia occurred at 90 mg/m2. Thrombocytopenia and/or anemia also occurred in all patients treated at 60 or 90 mg/m2. Complete alopecia was seen in one of three cases at 60 mg/m2 and all cases at 90 mg/m2. No hepatic, renal, or other major organ toxicities were encountered. Clinical cardiac toxicity did not occur in any patient, but the cumulative doxorubicin doses in 13 cases were less than 400 mg/m2. The plasma elimination of LED out to 24 hours was analyzed in terms of a two-compartment model. Depending upon the dose and the infusion time, maximum plasma concentrations ranged from 2.6 mumol/L to 36.89 mumol/L and the area under the plasma concentration x time curve (AUC) values ranged from 1.86 mumol/L x h/L to 49.57 mumol x h/L. These values are significantly higher than those expected for free doxorubicin. Urinary excretion of LED was approximately 10% after 24 hours. Doxorubicinol and doxorubicinone appeared at low levels in plasma 12 to 24 hours after injection. LED pharmacokinetics differ from those of free drug by the higher plasma levels and AUC of doxorubicin achieved, and by the low conversion of LED to metabolites. Overall, LED was well tolerated and produced only moderate nausea and vomiting and little stomatitis at myelosuppressive doses. The study also suggested that LED produces less venous sclerosis than free doxorubicin, but this requires further clinical verification.\r"

  ".W": "The kinetics and urinary excretion of etoposide and etoposide glucuronide were determined in 11 patients with obstructive jaundice (bilirubin greater than 2.0 mg/dL) and in 23 patients with normal renal and hepatic function. Mean (+/- SE) measurements of clearance (24.5 +/- 2.06 v 26.5 +/- 2.05 mL/min/m2), half-life (5.7 +/- 0.5 v 6.4 +/- 0.5 hours), and volume of distribution (12.4 +/- 1.1 v 13.7 +/- 1.6 L/m2) were not significantly different in patients with jaundice when compared with controls. Similarly, etoposide kinetics in three patients determined during a period of hyperbilirubinemia were not different from measurements made in the same patients following resolution of their obstructive jaundice. In patients with jaundice, 46% of an administered etoposide dose was excreted in the urine as etoposide compared with 35% in controls (P = .15). Urinary excretion of etoposide glucuronide accounted for 29% of an administered etoposide dose in control patients and 15% in those with hepatic obstruction (P = .03). Biliary etoposide excretion measured in four patients with T-tubes was insignificant (less than 2.0% of an administered dose). The calculated renal clearance of etoposide was 11.5 mL/min/m2 in patients with jaundice and 10.4 mL/min/m2 in controls (P = .53). Respective metabolic clearance was 4.9 and 6.9 mL/min/m2 in these two study groups (P = .13). Although hepatic metabolism of etoposide may be slightly decreased in patients with obstructive jaundice, a modest increase in renal etoposide excretion appears to compensate for this change, so that total clearance is similar in the patients with jaundice when compared with controls. No etoposide dose reductions appear to be needed in treating patients with obstructive jaundice who have normal renal function.\r"

  ".W": "While diffuse large-cell lymphoma (DLCL) is considered to be highly curable with current therapy, treatment failures are observed even with intensive combination chemotherapy regimens. In order to study the prognostic significance of actual dose intensity of chemotherapy in DLCL, we retrospectively analyzed 115 previously untreated patients treated as Stanford between 1975 and 1986 with cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP), methotrexate, bleomycin, Adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dexamethasone ([M]BACOD), or methotrexate, Adriamycin, cyclosphosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, and bleomycin (MACOP-B). The actual relative dose intensity (RDI), the amount of drug actually administered to each patient during the first 12 weeks of therapy, was calculated as standardized to CHOP and analyzed in addition to clinical factors prognostic for survival by univariate analysis. Multivariate recursive partitioning (tree-structured) survival analysis identified the actual RDI of Adriamycin greater than 75% as the single most important predictor of survival. A model incorporating the actual RDI of Adriamycin and performance status, in combination with serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and extranodal disease, defined three overall prognostic groups of patients with respective 3-year survival rates of 89%, 63%, and 18%. The three prognostic groups remained distinct, even when restricted to complete responders. This model was also predictive of survival when dose intensity was analyzed relative to the optimum dose defined for each of the three regimens and when applied to a subgroup of patients aged 50 years or younger. We conclude that actual RDI is an important prognostic factor for survival in DLCL and that analysis of RDI early in the course of treatment may allow modification of the treatment plan.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with relapsed Hodgkin's disease who respond to salvage therapy are successfully treated with cyclophosphamide, carmustine (BCNU), and etoposide (VP-16) (CBV) followed by autologus bone marrow transplantation (ABMT). Because of heavy pretreatment including radiation to the pelvic site, marrow harvest was not feasible in those patients. We therefore used blood-derived hemopoietic precursor cells as an alternative stem-cell source to rescue them after superdose chemotherapy. Hemopoietic precursor cells were mobilized into the peripheral blood either by chemotherapeutic induction of transient myelosuppression followed by an overshooting of blood stem-cell concentration, or by continuous intravenous (IV) granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) administration. The median time to reach 1,000 WBC per microliter, 500 polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) per microliter, or 20,000 platelets per microliter was 10, 20.5, and 38 days, respectively, for 50% of all patients. The platelet counts of two patients never dropped below 20,000/microL following autologous blood stem-cell transplantation (ABSCT), whereas two other patients had to be supported with platelets for 75 and 86 days posttransplant until a stable peripheral platelet count of 20,000/microL was attained. Among the 11 assessable patients, seven are in unmaintained complete remission (CR) at a median follow-up of 318 days. This is a first report on a series of ABSCTs in patients with advanced Hodgkin's disease proving that, despite prior damage to the marrow site, the circulating stem-cell pool is still a sufficient source of hemopoietic precursor cells for stem-cell rescue.\r"

  ".W": "The prognostic importance of immunobiologic factors in diffuse large-cell lymphoma (DLCL) is studied in 105 consecutive DLCL patients. Multivariate results using the Cox proportional hazards model clearly indicate that the Ki-67 index (P = .002), a marker of cell proliferation activity, and the presence or absence of human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) (P = .007) are strong predictors of survival even in the presence of established clinical factors of stage (P = .015) and symptoms (P = .050). Using these four variables, prognostic groups were formed identifying patient groups with varying degrees of risk. The group of patients with three or four risk factors present at the time of diagnosis had a median survival of 4 months compared with a median survival of 59 months for the group with no risk factors. Similarly, prognostic groups for disease-free survival (DFS) were constructed based on the proportional hazards model that involved B versus T phenotype (P = .035) and HLA-DR (P = .054). Median DFS for the patient group with one or two risk factors present was 11 months compared with 43 months with no risk factors present. This study suggests immunobiologic parameters are important predictors of clinical outcome in DLCL patients and are of value in identifying subgroups of patients who have not responded to currently available therapy. The practical significance of this study is to identify parameters that may suggest specific changes in therapy of patient subgroups.\r"

  ".U": "90270926\r", 
  ".W": "Dipyridamole-thallium-201 imaging is often performed in patients unable to exercise because of peripheral vascular disease. Many of these patients are taking pentoxifylline (Trental), a methylxanthine derivative which may improve intermittent claudication. Whether pentoxifylline inhibits dipyridamole-induced coronary hyperemia like other methylxanthines such as theophylline and should be stopped prior to dipyridamole-thallium-201 imaging is unknown. Therefore, we studied the hyperemic response to dipyridamole in seven open-chest anesthetized dogs after pretreatment with either pentoxifylline (0, 7.5, or 15 mg/kg i.v.) or theophylline (3 mg/kg i.v.). Baseline circumflex coronary blood flows did not differ significantly among treatment groups. Dipyridamole significantly increased coronary blood flow before and after 7.5 or 15 mm/kg i.v. pentoxifylline (p less than 0.002). Neither dose of pentoxifylline significantly decreased the dipyridamole-induced hyperemia, while peak coronary blood flow was significantly lower after theophylline (p less than 0.01). We conclude that pentoxyifylline does not inhibit dipyridamole-induced coronary hyperemia even at high doses.\r"

Results of antibody uptake after i.v. administration were analyzed in terms of accumulation and localization indices for normal tissues and tumor. Statistically significant differences between rat and mouse tissue biodistribution were found. D3, which reacts in vitro with the tumor and several normal rat tissues, cleared quickly from the blood of rats and was specifically targeted to several normal tissues, notably the lung. Virtually no targeting to the tumor was observed. Nude mice, however, showed a slower blood clearance and specific antibody targeting only in the tumor. Similar results were seen after injection of another antibody, E4, which is tumor-specific in vitro. Data suggest that studies on the xenogeneic nude mouse model may not necessarily be relevant to the choice of monoclonal antibodies for clinical diagnostic imaging or therapy.\r"

We now compare T2G1s to another anti-fibrin MAb, designated GC4, for imaging fresh and aged canine thrombi. GC4 is specific for a neoepitope exposed on fibrin later in the thrombolytic process after plasmin digestion. Femoral venous thrombi were induced in six groups of dogs, each containing three dogs. In two groups, the MAbs were compared when the thrombi were 3-hr or 3-days old at the time of injection, and the dogs were killed at 48 hr. In thrombi 3-hr-old, the GC4/T2G1s concentration ratio averaged 0.53 compared to 1.9 in 3-day-old thrombi. Two groups of dogs with thrombi 1- or 3-days-old were heparinized before MAb injection and were killed at 24 hr. The heparinized dogs with thrombi 1- or 3-days-old had GC4/T2G1s mean ratios of 2.3 and 2.9, respectively. In the unheparinized groups, the corresponding ratios were 1.1 and 1.9. GC4 may be more useful for clinical thrombus imaging than T2G1s because spontaneous venous thrombi are usually several days old at the time of presentation and patients are often heparinized immediately.\r"

Lym-1 is an antibody against a cell surface B-cell antigen. In comparison, TNT-1 represents a novel approach and is an antibody against an intracellular (nuclear) antigen that is selectively revealed in degenerating tumor cells. Experimentally iodine-125-(125I) labeled Lym-1 or TNT-1 was injected intravenously into nude mice bearing either the Raji lymphoma or the ME-180 human cervical carcinoma. Qualitative autoradiographic analyses performed after injection revealed that Lym-1 accumulated at the periphery of the target tumor where vascular permeability is marked and where Lym-1 positive cells are first encountered. By contrast, TNT-1 lost its initial peripheral distribution and demonstrated progressive concentration in the center of the tumor where binding to its nuclear antigen is facilitated by the presence of cell degeneration and necrosis. These studies confirm the ability of TNT-1 to bind areas deep within tumor that traditionally are considered inaccessible to antibodies administered for imaging and therapy.\r"

Technetium-99m-SESTAMIBI and thallium-201 (201Tl) were injected intravenously after 1 min occlusion and regional myocardial blood flow was measured with radioactive microspheres. Tomographic imaging of Tc-SESTAMIBI revealed a perfusion defect with slight but definite filling in over 2 hr. Quantitative analysis indicated a significant rise in the nadir and decrease in the width of the defect in circumferential profile curves. After 3-hr of reperfusion, Tc-SESTAMIBI activity in the previously ischemic area was always greater than the activity of microspheres injected during coronary occlusion (mean normalized values, 0.32 versus 0.11, p less than 0.0001). Our results indicate that following transient ischemia and reperfusion, Tc-SESTAMIBI clearly undergoes myocardial redistribution, although more slowly and less completely than 201Tl.\r"

Cell binding and competitive inhibition assays of both radioiodine and indium-111- (111In) labeled chimeric antibodies demonstrated in vitro immunoreactivity identical with that of the parental murine monoclonal antibodies. The biodistribution of the radiolabeled chimeric antibody in tumor-bearing nude mice was similar to that of the parental murine antibody. Tumor accumulation of radioiodinated parental and chimeric antibodies was lower than that of 111In-labeled antibodies, probably because of dehalogenation of the radioiodinated antibodies. Indium-111-labeled chimeric antibody clearly visualized xenografted tumor. These results suggest that a human/mouse chimeric antibody can be labeled with 111In and radioiodine without the loss of its immunoreactivity, and that chimeric antibody localizes in vivo in the same way as the parental murine antibody.\r"

Biodistribution of HPLC-purified 111In-DTPA-MAb preparations was checked with a low (0.2 micrograms) and a high (8.0 micrograms) MAb dose. Using Bio Gel P-30 for desalting the MAb-conjugates, 111In uptake in the liver amounted to 8%-9% of the injected dose (ID) and was independent from the MAb dose, the DTPA-to-MAb molar ratio, tumor growth and biologic variability (different MAbs and different strains of mice). Using Sephadex G-25 for desalting, 0.2 micrograms doses from 7 out of 26 preparations showed increased liver accumulation of 111In in non-tumor mice ranging from 15%-25% of ID. Corresponding high doses led to a \"normal\" value of 8%-9%. Increased liver uptake of the low dose could not be reduced by coadministration of the unconjugated MAb, but was normal after reinjection of \"in vivo filtered\" material. An inverse intracellular distribution of 111In activity between sediment and supernatant of liver homogenates, following the administration of the low and the high MAb dose, indicated an artifact of the labeling procedure rather than an inherent biological property of labeled MAbs.\r"

Histologically, an aplastic disorder was present with very low bone formation. On bone scintigraphy, intense calcium uptake in soft tissues implied that it was metabolically active. We hypothesize that this high metabolic activity contributed to the persistent hypercalcemia observed during the patient's last year of life.\r"

Nine of 10 angiographically confirmed episodes of spasm and 6 of 6 infarcts seen on angiography or TCT were correctly diagnosed with 99mTc-HM-PAO. One normal scintigraphic exam was angiographically doubtful, one positive 99mTc-HM-PAO study was normal on angiography (sub-radiologic spasm?), one technically poor scintigraphy was positive for spasm on angiograms, and eight exams were normal for spasm with all modalities. We had agreement between tests in 23 of 26 series of exams (88%) obtained in 15 patients.

  ".W": "The purpose of the study was to assess if a new scintigraphic method for noninvasive assessment of colonic transit could differentiate between subjects with normal bowel transit and those with constipation. Eleven normal subjects and 29 constipated patients were given 4 MBq iodine-131-cellulose (131I-cellulose) orally and sequential abdominal scans were performed at 6, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hr from which total and segmental percent retentions were calculated. There were clear differences between the normal subjects and the constipated patients for the total percent retention at all time intervals, on a segmental basis in the right colon at 24 hr, and in all segments at 48 and 72 hr. Three-day urinary excretion of radioiodine was minimal; 2.4% +/- 1.2% (mean +/- s.d.) in constipated patients and 3.1% +/- 0.8% in normals, with approximately 75% occurring in the first day. The use of oral radiotracers in the investigation of constipation appears promising.\r"

Time-activity curves of four segments of each leg were evaluated for lymph capacity, flow and soft-tissue uptake, and compared with the results from film scintigraphy. Curve analysis provided quantitative evaluation of the extent of hypoplasia or aplasia in primary lymphedema and of lymphatic obstruction in secondary lymphedema, and is particularly suited to assess the involvement of lymphatics in chronic venous disease. Film scintigraphy, on the other hand, is preferable in cases in which the pattern of activity distribution in the affected extremity is diagnostic, such as in dermal back flow, traumatic lymphocele, or megalymphatics. Venography is most informative in cases of suspected underlying venous disease, but the role of lymphangiography, which shows only part of the lymphatic system and requires incision of the edematous tissues, is considered questionable.\r"

The mean age at diagnosis was 16 months, and at final follow-up 99 months. Cow milk tolerance by challenge was demonstrated in 28% of patients by 2 years of age, 56% by 4 years, and 78% by 6 years. Only 25% of children were allergic to cow milk alone; parents reported associated adverse reactions to many other foods, including egg (58%), soy milk (47%), and peanut (34%). Exclusion of cow milk from the diet of infants and young children with cow milk allergy did not prevent the subsequent development of atopic disorders. At final follow-up, 40% of patients reportedly had asthma, 21% atopic eczema, and 43% allergic rhinitis. It is unclear whether independent mechanisms control the development of cow milk allergy and other atopic conditions.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred fifteen attacks of acute rheumatic fever were observed during the past two decades (1969 to 1988) at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center; 104 were initial attacks and 11 were recurrences. The maximum number of cases (18) occurred during the first year of this period, 1969; thereafter the annual incidence decreased until a resurgence was apparent in 1985 to 1986, with 25 cases. There were no differences in the frequency of major manifestations nor the severity of carditis in the 1970s compared with the 1980s. Polyarthritis alone was present in 51 cases, carditis alone in 31, and combined carditis and polyarthritis in 28; chorea was diagnosed in 5. Congestive heart failure occurred in 17 attacks of carditis, including one death from fulminant disease in 1982. In contrast to recent reports, the majority of the affected population was urban, low income, and from crowded communities: more than half were Hispanic, predominantly from Dominican Republic families. The prevalence of acute rheumatic fever underscores the need for early detection and treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis. The observation that 9.5% of the attacks were recurrent reflects failure to comply with antimicrobial prophylaxis and reaffirms the need for more effective secondary prevention programs.\r"

A multimethod factored approach to the assessment of physical activity was used; this approach included direct observation, motion sensor evaluation, and several parental reports of the subjects' activity levels. Analysis of these data revealed three highly significant activity factors: general activity, hyperactivity, and direct-observation-competitiveness activity. When the association between physical activity factors and cardiovascular risk was explored, no consistent relationship was found between the various childhood physical activity factors and the cardiovascular risk factors of weight and blood pressure. Individual (nonfactored) physical activity measures also failed to correlate with children's physical activity. The results indicate that physical activity is not related to obesity and blood pressure in children. However, other interpretations (i.e., that the activity protocol was insufficiently accurate to detect subtle differences, or that children are not participating in enough physical activity to affect their cardiovascular health) are also possible.\r"

  ".W": "To limit nosocomial spread of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, a longitudinal intervention trial was instituted. Nasal secretions or washes were screened for RSV antigen by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and patients were assigned to an RSV-infected or an RSV-uninfected cohort. The baseline (preintervention) rate of 7.17 nosocomial cases of RSV per 1000 patient-days of care was used for comparison. Despite continued infections in the community after screening was initiated, there were no cases of RSV infection in 1880 patient-days of care for 3 months (p = 0.039). During the fourth month, an RSV-infected child was erroneously assigned to the RSV-uninfected cohort, and three nosocomial cases occurred--5.33/1000 patient-days of care (p = 0.286). Overall, there were three nosocomial RSV infections in 2443 patient-days of care in the 1987 season after screening was introduced--1.23/1000 patient-days of care (p = 0.026). In the subsequent RSV season, there was one nosocomial case--0.461/1000 patient-days of care for 3 months (p = 0.0074). During the same period, nosocomial cases of RSV were observed in the pediatric and neonatal intensive care units, where assignment to a cohort was not possible. We conclude that entry into a cohort at the time of admission, on the basis of prospective RSV screening by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, effectively reduces nosocomial transmission of RSV.\r"

Eighty-one percent met classic criteria for GH deficiency and were classified as having idiopathic GH deficiency (59%), organic GH deficiency (18%), or septo-optic dysplasia (4%). The remaining 19.8% had short stature of varied causes. Height standard deviation score at diagnosis, maximum GH response to stimulation, and heights of parents were examined according to gender, race, age at diagnosis, and previous treatment history. The predominance of boys in all subgroups except septooptic dysplasia, and the observation that girls with idiopathic GH deficiency were comparatively shorter than boys at diagnosis, suggest ascertainment bias. Black children with idiopathic GH deficiency were shorter than white children at diagnosis, and their low overall representation (6.0%) compared with their percentage in the at-risk population (12.9%) also suggest ascertainment bias among races. These data provide a profile of GH deficiency as it is currently defined and expose possible inherent biases in the diagnostic process. Now that GH supply is no longer limited, criteria for its use should be formulated to avoid apparent underascertainment or late diagnosis of GH deficiency in girls and black children.\r"

This finding, along with a report of an Aicardi syndrome patient with an Xp22/autosome translocation, led to the hypothesis that Aicardi syndrome might be caused by an X-linked dominant, male-lethal mutation on the short arm of the X chromosome. To study this hypothesis, we investigated X chromosome inactivation patterns in peripheral lymphocytes from seven patients. We used two methods: methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme analysis and segregation of the active X chromosome in somatic cell hybrids. We found that three of seven cytogenetically normal girls with Aicardi syndrome had profoundly skewed X-inactivation in their lymphocytes, supporting the concept that Aicardi syndrome is X linked. Three of the five girls with the greatest degree of psychomotor retardation and the poorest seizure control had skewed X-inactivation. In contrast, the two highest-functioning children had random X-inactivation. We screened DNA using eight polymorphic probes from the Xp22 region but were unable to identify a deletion in any of the seven patients. Nonrandom X-inactivation in lymphocytes and possibly other tissues in some, but not all, patients with Aicardi syndrome may reflect heterogeneity of their molecular lesions.\r"

In all patient groups, cord venous EP was elevated in comparison with values in control infants. No change was found in EP level between birth and 8 hours in control infants (geometric mean in cord and 8-hour sample: 20 and 16 mU/ml, not significant) or in acutely asphyxiated infants with postnatal hypoxia (122 and 72 mU/ml, not significant), whereas the EP level decreased in all other groups: infants with polycythemia (123 to 24 mU/ml, p less than 0.001), nonacidotic infants (78 to 26 mU/ml, p less than 0.001) and acidotic infants (176 to 38 mU/ml, p less than 0.001) of the preeclampsia group, and acutely asphyxiated infants without postnatal hypoxia (58 to 30 mU/ml, p less than 0.001). The mean (+/- SD) half-time of EP disappearance was 2.6 +/- 0.5 hours in infants with polycythemia and 3.7 +/- 0.9 hours in infants of the preeclampsia group.\r"

  ".W": "The age of gross motor milestone attainment and how it is affected by degree of prematurity at delivery were studied in 100 high-risk, preterm (less than 32 weeks) infants with normal motor outcome. We calculated the mean age of attainment for each milestone on the basis of chronologic age from the date of delivery and term age equivalent, correcting for degree of preterm delivery. Half of these preterm infants were male; 70% were black. The infants were compared with a population of normal infants born at term. In this very preterm population, there were no consistent sex differences, but black infants generally attained motor milestones before white infants. For each motor milestone, regardless of gender or race, the mean term age equivalents of attainment for very preterm infants closely approximated the mean ages of milestone attainment for term infants, whereas the mean chronologic ages were delayed 2 or 3 months. We conclude that very preterm infants can be expected to demonstrate sequential gross motor development at a rate expected for degree of prematurity. Chronologic age is not a valid measurement scale to use in determining motor delay in very preterm infants.\r"

  ".W": "Because previous investigations have suggested that platelet activating factor and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) are important mediators of experimental necrotizing enterocolitis in the rat, we measured platelet activating factor, acetylhydrolase (the platelet activating factor breakdown enzyme), and TNF-alpha in the plasma of 12 human neonates with necrotizing enterocolitis and eight age-matched control subjects with similar gestational ages, postnatal ages, and weights. Almost all patients with necrotizing enterocolitis had elevated plasma platelet activating factor values (18.1 +/- 3.6 ng/ml vs. 3.1 +/- 0.9 ng/ml in control subjects, p less than 0.01). Plasma acetylhydrolase activity was lower in patients than in control subjects (10.6 +/- 0.7 nmol/ml/min vs 23.0 +/- 1.4 nmol/ml/min, p less than 0.01). Plasma TNF-alpha concentration was significantly elevated in patients with necrotizing enterocolitis (136 +/- 75 U/ml vs 1.5 +/- 0.8 U/ml, p less than 0.05), although the individual variation was high. There was no correlation between individual TNF-alpha and platelet activating factor levels. We conclude that platelet activating factor and TNF-alpha are elevated in patients with necrotizing enterocolitis and that suppressed platelet activating factor degradation contributes to the increased platelet activating factor levels; platelet activating factor and TNF-alpha may contribute to the pathophysiology of necrotizing enterocolitis.\r"

Psychosocial functioning measured by SIP related specifically to mental health and arthritic pain.

Attention was drawn to fractures involving all the pillars supporting the subchondral plate and named \"the dome shear fracture.\" The high incidence of fractures (29 of 107) was attributed to steroid therapy. The controls used were femoral heads from 400 patients with OA, 10 with ankylosing spondylitis and 10 treated with steroids for reasons other than RA.

Lymphopenia was found more frequently with increasing age, while malar rash, seizures, false-positive VDRL, thrombocytopenia (in whites), proteinuria (0.5-3.5 g/day), elevated antidouble stranded DNA antibodies, and hypocomplementemia were found less frequently. No age relationship was found for the prevalence of 16 of 24 clinical features examined, including the important disease manifestations of arthritis, serositis, psychosis, nephrotic-range proteinuria, renal failure, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and leukopenia. The use of regression analysis allows the recognition of similarities and differences in cumulative clinical features of SLE due to age in isolation from the effects of other demographic factors.\r"

Of the adult patients with spondyloarthropathy only half could be classified as having Reiter's syndrome (RS), ankylosing spondylitis (AS) or psoriatic spondylitis. The remaining patients had many signs and symptoms consistent with spondyloarthropathy, but they either did not meet the diagnostic criteria for any specific disease or had features pathognomonic of more than one. The clinical manifestations of the patients who did not meet standard disease definitions are summarized and compared to those of the patients with RS, AS and psoriatic spondylitis. Because of the many shared features, we believe that these as yet unclassified disease states belong with AS and RS in a single spondyloarthropathic disease spectrum and should be defined and recognized as such.\r"

Serious ADR were perceived to be more frequent with NSAID than prescription drugs generally, and those who had experienced a previous ADR (47%) judged ADR to be more frequent (p less than 0.001). When asked to rate the likelihood that each of 7 reasons were causative of ADR, the most likely reason was perceived to be inadequate information to the patient about the drug, and secondly inadequate patient followup by the prescribing doctor. Responses to a hypothetical AS drug risk scenario indicated high safety expectations for antirheumatic agents; 61% thought that the government should take a drug off the market if there is any evidence of fatal ADR. The results of this survey suggest the need for greater patient information and education on the risks and benefits of medicines to modify perceptions and false expectations.\r"

The S. aureus factor exclusively releases the large, 4 M guanidinium extractable proteoglycans from the matrix; the small proteoglycans are not affected by this factor. The large proteoglycans, released by Staphylococcal culture filtrate, had a slightly smaller hydrodynamic volume compared to the proteoglycans remaining in the matrix. Purified large proteoglycans, incubated in S. aureus filtrate, lost their capacity to aggregate with hyaluronic acid. This suggests that some culture filtrates of S. aureus contain a factor that degrades the core protein of the large proteoglycans at or near the hyaluronic acid binding region.\r"

  ".W": "Radon has long been known to contribute to risk of lung cancer, especially in undergound miners who are exposed to large amounts of the carcinogen. Recently, however, lower amounts of radon present in living areas have been suggested as an important cause of lung cancer. In an effort to clarify the relationship of low amounts of radon with lung cancer risk, we placed alpha-track radon detectors in the homes of 308 women with newly diagnosed lung cancer and 356 randomly selected female control subjects of similar age. Measurements were taken after 1 year. All study participants were part of the general population of Shenyang, People's Republic of China, an industrial city in the northeast part of the country that has one of the world's highest rates of lung cancer in women. The median time of residence in the homes was 24 years. The median household radon level was 2.3 pCi/L of air; 20% of the levels were greater than 4 pCi/L. Radon levels tended to be higher in single-story houses or on the first floor of multiple-story dwellings, and they were also higher in houses with increased levels of indoor air pollution from coal-burning stoves. However, the levels were not higher in homes of women who developed lung cancer than in homes of controls, nor did lung cancer risk increase with increasing radon level. No association between radon and lung cancer was observed regardless of cigarette-smoking status, except for a nonsignificant trend among heavy smokers. No positive associations of lung cancer cell type with radon were observed, except for a nonsignificant excess risk of small cell cancers among the more heavily exposed residents. Our data suggest that projections from surveys of miners exposed to high radon levels may have overestimated the overall risks of lung cancer associated with levels typically seen in homes in this Chinese city. However, further studies in other population groups are needed to clarify the carcinogenic potential of indoor radon.\r"

To gain insight into the effects of the Vietnam experience, we investigated the occurrence of neoplasms in military working dogs based on standard necropsy examination by the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. We observed that these dogs experienced significant elevated risks for testicular seminoma and, independently, testicular dysfunction. Experimental evidence shows testicular dysfunction and impaired spermatogenesis in laboratory animals exposed to phenoxy herbicides, dioxin, or tetracycline, and antibiotic used extensively in military working dogs in Vietnam. Because an unexplained significant decrease in sperm quality in Vietnam veterans has been observed by the Centers for Disease Control, further research is warranted if we are to clarify military service in Vietnam as a risk factor for testicular dysfunction. The testis should be made a priority site in the study of Vietnam experience-related cancers.\r"

  ".U": "90271260\r", 
  ".W": "The toxic effects and tissue uptake of both cisplatin and oxaliplatin--[(1R, 2R)-1,2-cyclohexanediamine-N,N'] [oxalato(2-)-O,O']platinum--were previously shown to vary similarly according to dosing time in mice. A 4-hour infusion of cisplatin resulted in fewer side effects and allowed administration of higher doses at 16 hours than at 4 hours in patients with cancer. We hypothesized that the continuous venous infusion of oxaliplatin for 5 days would be less toxic and would deliver a higher dose to the patient if the drug were infused at a circadian rhythm-modulated rate (peak at 16 hr; schedule B) rather than at a constant rate (schedule A). We tested this hypothesis in a randomized phase I trial. We escalated the dose of oxaliplatin to the patient by 25 mg/m2 per course. Courses were repeated every 3 weeks. An external, multichannel, programmable-in-time pump was used for the infusions. Toxicity was assessable for 94 courses in 23 patients (12 patients with breast carcinoma, nine with hepatocellular carcinoma, and two with cholangiocarcinoma). The incidence of neutropenia of World Health Organization grades II-IV and the incidence of distal paresthesias were 10 or more times higher (P less than .05) with schedule A than with schedule B. In addition, vomiting was 55% higher (P = .15) with schedule A than with schedule B. Furthermore, with schedule B, the mean dose of oxaliplatin (P less than .001) and its maximum tolerated dose (P = .06) could be increased by 15% over those doses with schedule A. An objective response was achieved in two of the 12 patients with previously treated breast cancer. We recommend that the dose of oxaliplatin for phase II trials be 175 mg/m2, delivered according to the circadian rhythm-modulated rate.\r"

Frequencies of chromatid aberrations in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated blood lymphocytes collected by demecolcine from 0.5 hour to 1.5 hours after x irradiation with 58 roentgens were twofold to threefold higher in A-T heterozygotes than in clinically normal controls and twofold to three-fold higher in A-T patients (homozygotes) than in A-T gene carriers. The persistence of chromatid breaks and gaps in lymphocytes following radiation-induced DNA damage during G2 suggests a deficiency or deficiencies in DNA repair that may be the defect at the molecular level that results in the enhanced radiosensitivity and cancer proneness characterizing A-T gene carriers and patients.\r"

In 1988, a total of 5514 students in first-year community college and university classrooms across Canada were surveyed to assess STD/HIV-related knowledge, attitudes, and risk behavior. The students' mean age was 19.7 years; the male-to-female ratio was 1:1.4. Students knew more about HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome than other STDs. Of the 74.3% of the men and 68.9% of the women who were coitally active, 14.3% of the men and 18.6% of the women had participated in anal intercourse and 5.5% reported a previous STD. Only 24.8% of the men and 15.6% of the women always used a condom during sexual intercourse. Among the 21.3% of the men and 8.6% of the women with 10 or more partners, regular condom use was reported in only 21% and 7.5%, respectively. In this subgroup, anal intercourse was practiced by 26.9% of the men and 34.8% of the women, and previous STD was reported by 10.6% and 24.2%, respectively. Factors associated with not using a condom included number of sexual partners, embarrassment about condom purchase, difficulty discussing condom use with a partner, use of oral contraceptives, insufficient knowledge of HIV/STDs, and the belief that condoms interfere with sexual pleasure. These factors are potentially amenable to change. Effective, behaviorally focused educational programs are needed to improve condom use and reduce STD/HIV risk.\r"

The three groups were at high risk for infection with Chlamydia trachomatis. The frequencies of premature rupture of the membranes, premature contractions, and small-for-gestational-age infants were significantly lower in the successfully treated patients when compared with those of the chlamydia-positive patients, but were not significantly different when compared with those of the control patients. These data indicate that in a pregnant population at high risk for infection with C trachomatis, repeated prenatal chlamydial testing, plus successful erythromycin treatment, can significantly reduce certain adverse effects on pregnancy outcome.\r"

The geometric mean antichlamydial antibody titer among cases was 75 +/- 10.2 vs 13 +/- 11.0 among controls. The matched-pair odds ratio for ectopic pregnancy and IgG titer of 1:64 or greater to C trachomatis was 3.0 (95% confidence interval, 2.1 to 4.4). Adjusting for age at first intercourse, total lifetime partners, douching, history of infertility, and parity yielded a relative risk of 2.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.5 to 3.3). Current douching remained an independent risk factor after controlling for chlamydial exposure, with an adjusted relative risk of 2.1 (95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 3.5). The population attributable fraction for chlamydial infection was 0.47 and that for douching was 0.45. The results stress the need for control of C trachomatis infections and for further study of specific douching behaviors as risk factors for ectopic pregnancy.\r"

Patients who received diagnostic workup of all fevers and treatment with antibiotics (Antibiotic Group) were compared with patients who received comfort measures only (Palliative Group). The incidence of fever was similar in the Antibiotic and Palliative groups. Survival analysis revealed that, for the more severely affected patients, there was no difference in survival between the groups. Among less severely affected patients, survival was higher for the Antibiotic than the Palliative Group. These results suggest that treatment of fever with antibiotics does not alter the outcome of fever in patients with advanced Alzheimer's disease.\r"

Care and teaching focused principally on secondary complications of intravenous drug use. Study recommendations included (1) establishment of a comprehensive substance abuse treatment education, and research program with a dedicated inpatient unit; (2) use of an explicit social contract between patients and care givers; and (3) staff education about legal limits in managing disruptive patients and searching for illegal substances. Primary and secondary prevention, including combating societal enabling of substance abuse, should be the institution's long-term goals.\r"

This article examines the impact of New York's landmark changes on hospital staffing, graduate medical education, the demand for ancillary personnel, and hospital expenditures. Based on a statewide survey, the results indicate that implementation of these rules would require hospitals to hire an additional 5358 full-time equivalent personnel at a yearly cost that would exceed $358 million. The broader implications of these rules on financing graduate training are also explored.\r"

They experienced multiple infections prior to the diagnosis of neoplasms at ages 4, 5, and 8 years, respectively. The tumors in each case were mainly involving the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. The smooth-muscle origin of the tumors was proved by light and electron microscopy and immunohistochemical staining for muscle-specific actin and desmin. Leiomyomata and leiomyosarcomata are rare tumors in childhood, suggesting a nonrandom association of tumors of smooth-muscle origin and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. We postulate that human immunodeficiency virus infection may play a direct or indirect role in tumor formation.\r"

For most countries, rates of cesarean section have risen as operative vaginal rates have fallen, but some important exceptions exist. A comparison of cesarean section rates for two complications of labor and delivery that can be objectively diagnosed, multiple births and breech delivery, demonstrates that cesarean section rates for these complications rose sharply in almost every country from 1980 to 1985. A comparison of 1985 national rates of intervention and measures of birth outcome found no significant relationship between the two. While such ecological comparisons are imperfect at best, this does indicate that low levels of early infant mortality can be achieved in some populations despite a low rate of cesarean deliveries.\r"

The lowest rates were in Japan and Austria, each with rates below 0.6 per 100,000 males 15 through 24 years of age. Three quarters of the homicides in the United States resulted from the use of firearms contrasted with less than a quarter of all homicides in the comparison countries. The US homicide rate for black males 15 through 24 years of age (85.6) was more than seven times the rate for white males (11.2). In 1987 there were only four states that had homicide rates among white males that were as low as the rates among males in the comparison countries. The lowest state rate among young black males was still seven times the highest rate abroad. There are about 4000 homicides per year among young males in the United States. If the US homicide rate could be reduced to that in the country with the next highest rate, more than 3000 lives would be saved.\r"

Most of this assistance is provided by Western nations such as the United States. Mortality rates in these populations during the acute phase of displacement have been extremely high, up to 60 times the expected rates. Displaced populations in northern Ethiopia (1985) and southern Sudan (1988) have suffered the highest crude mortality rates. Although mortality rates have risen in all age groups, excess mortality has been the greatest in 1- through 14-year-old children. The major causes of death have been measles, diarrheal diseases, acute respiratory tract infections, and malaria. Case-fatality ratios for these diseases have risen due to the prevalence of both protein-energy malnutrition and certain micronutrient deficiencies. Despite current technical knowledge and resources, several recent relief programs have failed to promptly implement essential public health programs such as provision of adequate food rations, clean water and sanitation, measles immunization, and control of communicable diseases. Basic structural changes in the way international agencies implement and coordinate assistance to displaced populations are urgently needed.\r"

  ".W": "Public health officials, physicians, and politicians have long been aware of the squalid environmental conditions existing along the US-Mexico border. Some attempts have been made to improve the environmental pollution and causes of human disease, beginning as early as the 1930s with the IBWC, established in 1889. More recent agreements and legislation have called for US and Mexico cooperation by way of each nation's corresponding environmental agency (ie, the EPA and Mexico's SEDUE) and their agencies of foreign affairs (ie, the IBWC). Nevertheless, environmental monitoring and disease incidence data continue to point out that public and environmental health along the border--the result of uncontrolled air and water pollution and lack of disease vector control--is rapidly deteriorating and seriously affecting the health and future economic vitality on both sides of the border. Many prominent public health professionals and environmental organizations are concerned that the present working relationship between the United States and Mexico is not functioning well and cannot adequately cope with existing environmental conditions; for one thing, the efforts of the EPA and SEDUE are reviewed no more frequently than once a year by a staff quartered in Washington and Mexico City. Some projects to improve these conditions have been undertaken by the EPA and SEDUE and the IBWC; at present, the prospects for success do not appear promising. Consequently, these individuals and organizations have urged creation of a US-Mexico border environmental health commission. Congress did see fit last year to give responsibility for the environment to the IBWC in the form of Public Law 100-465. This law, however, does not address the full severity of environmental and public health degradation along the border; it does not address the pollution of the New River, Agua Prieta, the San Pedro River, or the Pacific Ocean, neither does it offer remedial control of hazardous waste sites, rabies, and other disease vectors. Moreover, the IBWC is only a deliberative body, not an implementing one.\r"

Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was done postoperatively in 95% of cases. Clinical follow-up was achieved in 97% of cases, and DSA follow-up was obtained in 66% of cases. The overall group had a 1% operative minor morbidity (three cases of minimal new neurologic deficit), no major morbidity, and a 0.7% mortality (one death from stroke and one from myocardial infarction). Complications correlated well with the patient's preoperative risk category. During follow-up, 10 minor strokes, only 1 of which was attributable to the reconstructed artery, and 10 transient ischemic attacks, 3 of which were presumably related to recurrent stenosis, occurred. Asymptomatic mild to moderate restenosis of the internal carotid or common carotid artery was identified in 10% of follow-up DSAs and severe stenosis or occlusion in 3%. Stenosis in the opposite common carotid or internal carotid artery progressed in 48 cases (26% of follow-up DSAs and ultrasound studies), and 10 of these became symptomatic. An actuarial analysis of patients who had endarterectomy indicated that the cumulative probability of ipsilateral stroke was 1.5% at 1 month and 2% at 5 years. The cumulative probability of ipsilateral stroke, transient ischemic attack, or reversible ischemic neurologic deficit was 4% at 1 month and 8% at 5 years or less than 1% per year after the first month, with censoring at the time of the second surgical procedure.\r"

  ".W": "Gastroparesis after a viral infection has rarely been reported. In this article, we describe the clinical features and long-term outcome of 7 patients who had gastroparesis after a presumed viral illness and who were identified in a retrospective review of 103 consecutive cases of gastroparesis seen at our institution from 1977 through 1988. The three male and four female patients with gastroparesis after a suspected viral illness were young (mean age, 26.9 years) and healthy before the onset of the illness, which manifested as low-grade fever, fatigue, and myalgia with or without diarrhea. A mean of 4.5 days after spontaneous resolution of the viral illness, persistent nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain developed in these patients. In all seven patients, delayed emptying of the gastric contents was substantiated. Autonomic neuropathy was found in all three patients who underwent autonomic function tests. During a mean follow-up of 32.3 months, five of the seven patients had complete resolution of gastroparetic symptoms, and the other two had considerable improvement of their condition. We conclude that postviral gastroparesis is uncommon, is frequently associated with autonomic dysfunction, and is associated with an apparently excellent prognosis.\r"

  ".W": "Paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 256 patients who received primary treatment (surgical staging, reduction of tumor size, and adjuvant therapy based on surgical and pathologic risk factors) for endometrial carcinoma at the Mayo Clinic between 1979 and 1983 were analyzed by flow cytometry to determine DNA ploidy characteristics. Diploid patterns constituted 78% of the cases, whereas aneuploid and tetraploid patterns accounted for 17% and 5%, respectively. Only 10% of patients with diploid tumors had a relapse in comparison with 39% of those with nondiploid lesions (34% with aneuploid; 58% with tetraploid). Significant differences (P less than 0.001) were noted in estimated 4-year progression-free survivals--88% for patients with diploid and 57% for those with nondiploid tumors. Stage, grade, depth of myometrial invasion, histologic subtype, peritoneal cytology, and DNA ploidy all demonstrated independent prognostic significance (P less than 0.001) in this study population. When subjected to multivariate analysis, however, grade and depth of myometrial penetration failed to retain prognostic significance (P greater than 0.15) and surgical stage was marginally significant (P = 0.05), whereas histologic subtype and DNA ploidy maintained significant predictive powers (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.01, respectively). We conclude that DNA ploidy is a major objective prognostic factor and therapeutic determinant for endometrial carcinoma.\r"

The ACPA test and the presentation, diagnosis, and management of subglottic stenosis due to Wegener's granulomatosis are discussed.

However, a subgroup of people exist who have a sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and morphologically normal HRCT scans, yet have subtle radiographic aberrations based on measurements of inner ear dimensions. These changes might have resulted from teratogenic influences during the late first to mid second trimester, a time when the inner ear has achieved adult form, yet continues to enlarge to adult size. A retrospective study of HRCTs on three groups of ears was performed to determine inner ear structure dimensions. Group I, the control group, consisted of 50 ears with no SNHL and no discernible abnormalities on HRCT. In group II, there were 70 ears with SNHL and obvious abnormalities on HRCT. Group III, the test group, was composed of 140 ears with SNHL and \"normal\" HRCTs. Groups II and III were analyzed, applying the normal dimensions derived from group I. When compared to the control group (I), all of the ears in group II were abnormal. Moreover, 75% of the ears in group III had subtle differences not apparent unless measurements were made. Two or more abnormal dimensions were found in 32%. Findings and implications are thoroughly discussed.\r"

Seven normal patients had three trials of facial-nerve electroneurography on three separate test days. Peak-to-peak amplitudes of combined motor action potentials were measured; amplitude variability was not affected by the measurement site. A biphasic waveform shape was most consistently obtained by using the nasal alae as the recording point rather than the nasolabial crease. We hypothesize that alar electrodes primarily detect combined motor action potential activity from relatively synchronous, fast-conducting facial-nerve fibers, while the combined motor action potential detected by electrodes in the nasolabial crease reflect a relatively complex summation of both fast and slow fibers.\r"

  ".W": "Congenital aural stenosis, as compared to congenital aural atresia, carries a much greater risk of cholesteatoma. In a review of over 600 patients with major congenital ear malformations, 50 patients (54 ears) were found to have congenital aural stenosis. Ninety-one percent of the ears in patients 12 years and older with a stenosis of 2 mm or less presented with cholesteatoma. Based on this review, the following opinions are given: 1. A bony ear canal opening of 2 mm or less puts the patient at risk of cholesteatoma formation; 2. the cholesteatoma is slow-growing; and 3. undiagnosed cholesteatoma will cause extensive damage to the ear by early adulthood. We recommend surgery for patients with stenosis of the external ear canal measuring 2 mm or less. The appropriate time for surgery is late childhood or early adolescence, before irreversible damage has occurred.\r"

Infants with type I SRPS (Majewski syndrome) may exhibit dysgenesis of the larynx, which is manifested by epiglottic hypoplasia. Photographic documentation of laryngeal findings obtained at autopsy in an affected infant is provided. To our knowledge, such photographic documentation has not been previously published. Normal laryngeal development is reviewed, based on the Carnegie system of staging. The developmental errors leading to SRPS are thought to occur at 33 to 48 days of fetal life (Carnegie stages 15 through 19).\r"

During the period of January 1977 to July 1989, 51 patients underwent surgery for parapharyngeal space tumors at the University of Pittsburgh's Eye and Ear Hospital. Eighty percent of the parapharyngeal space neoplasms were benign; 20% were malignant. Fifty-seven percent (31/54) were of neurogenic origin, 30% (16/54) were of salivary origin, and 13% (7/54) were of miscellaneous origin. The use of computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging, and selective use of angiography, allowed us to ascertain the location, size, vascularity, and relation of parapharyngeal space tumors to surrounding anatomical structures. Imaging techniques established the site of origin of these tumors with 96% accuracy. This information was essential in planning surgical approaches and predicting prognoses. Details of the surgery, morbidity, and outcome of these patients are presented.\r"

Following surgery and irradiation, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, and leucovorin were administered 18 times over 6 months. Fifty patients undertook chemotherapy, while 47 patients declined further therapy. Comparison of the two groups according to stage, site, and Karnofsky performance status demonstrated no significant differences. The number of nodes encountered and the number and percentage of nodes with extracapsular spread were similar in the two groups. The minimum 5-year adjusted survival for patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy is 54% (20 of 37 patients), while survival of patients who failed to undertake adjuvant chemotherapy was 17% (5 of 30 patients). These data suggest the efficacy of methotrexate-5-fluorouracil adjuvant chemotherapy and support the need for a prospective randomized clinical trial.\r"

With the special combined efforts of the otolaryngologist, the anesthesiologist, the nurses, and the hospital administration, same-day-stay adenotonsillectomy is a justifiable and cost-effective procedure.\r"

Ninety-three patients underwent acoustic tumor removal during a 41/2-year period, and hearing preservation was attempted in 20 cases. Hearing was preserved in 65% of the entire series, and excellent results were obtained in tumors less than 1.5 cm. No patient with a tumor greater than 1.5 cm had serviceable hearing preserved when total tumor removal was performed. Two patients, one with neurofibromatosis and one with an acoustic neuroma in an only-hearing ear, had planned partial tumor removal with preservation of hearing. Preoperative auditory brainstem response results were not predictive of postoperative hearing preservation. Intraoperative auditory brainstem response monitoring demonstrated that loss of wave V consistently correlated with loss of hearing postoperatively, whereas persistence of wave V (with a latency prolongation not exceeding 3.00 ms) was predictive of successful hearing preservation regardless of latency increases.\r"

Vocal analysis was performed prior to radiotherapy and at specific intervals throughout the radiation treatment program. The voicing ratio was extrapolated from a sustained vowel phonation using the Visipitch interfaced with the IBM-PC. Preliminary observations suggested three distinct patterns of vocal behavior: 1. reduced voicing ratio with precipitous improvement within the course of treatment, 2. high initial voicing ratio with reduction secondary to radiation induced edema, with rapid improvement in the voicing component after the edema subsided, and 3. fluctuating voicing ratio during and following treatment. Enrollment of new patients and a 2-year follow-up of current patients was undertaken.\r"
