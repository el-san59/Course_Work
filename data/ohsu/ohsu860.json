Recombinant IRAP specifically inhibited IL-1 bioactivity on T cells and endothelial cells in vitro and was a potent inhibitor of IL-1 induced corticosterone production in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "90220872\r", 
  ".W": "Recent advances in understanding the molecular basis of human X-linked muscular dystrophies have come from the identification of dystrophin, a cytoskeletal protein associated with the surface membrane. Although there is little or virtually no dystrophin in affected individuals, it is not known how this causes muscle degeneration. One possibility is that the membrane of dystrophic muscle is weakened and becomes leaky to Ca2+. In muscle from mdx mice, an animal model of the human disease, intracellular Ca2+ is elevated and associated with a high rate of protein degradation. The possibility that a lack of dystrophin alters the resting permeability of skeletal muscle to Ca2+ prompted us to compare Ca2(+)-permeable ionic channels in muscle cells from normal and mdx mice. We now show that recordings of single-channel activity from mdx myotubes are dominated by the presence of Ca2(+)-permeable mechano-transducing ion channels. Like similar channels in normal skeletal muscle, they are rarely open at rest, but open when the membrane is stretched by applying suction to the electrode. Other channels in mdx myotubes, however, are often open for extended periods of time at rest and close when suction is applied to the electrode. The results show a novel type of mechano-transducing ion channel in mdx myotubes that could provide a pathway for Ca2+ to leak into the cell.\r"

  ".U": "90220875\r", 
  ".W": "Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B), which was first detected by its binding to the kappa B site in the immunoglobulin kappa-gene enhancer, is important for the regulated expression of the kappa-gene and is partly responsible for the induction in appropriate cells of interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-2 alpha receptor, beta-interferon and serum amyloid A protein. NF-kappa B is present as a nuclear DNA-binding protein in B lymphocytes and mature macrophages, but is found in the cytoplasm of many cells in a form unable to bind to DNA. The cytoplasmic form is bound to an inhibitor protein, I kappa B, from which it can be released in vitro by deoxycholate and other agents. Activation of cells by various agents, notably the phorbol esters that stimulate protein kinase C (PKC), leads to dissociation in vivo of the NF-kappa B/I kappa B complex and migration of NF-kappa B to the nucleus. Therefore, it acts as a second messenger system, transducing activation signals from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. To elucidate the mechanism of signal transfer, we have used an in vitro system in which addition of purified protein kinases to a partially purified NF-kappa B/I kappa B complex leads to the activation of the DNA-binding activity of NF-kappa B. Using gel retardation assays we found that PKC, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and a haem-regulated eIF-2 kinase (HRI) could activate NF-kappa B in vitro, whereas casein kinase II was ineffective. To determine the target for the protein kinases we purified and characterized both NF-kappa B and I kappa B and found that I kappa B is phosphorylated and inactivated in the presence of PKC and HRI but not PKA.\r"

An example is the transcriptional regulation of digalactoside-specific binding by uropathogenic strains of Escherichia coli. The fimbrial structures (pili) on the bacterial surface carry the adhesin and are present during growth at 37 degrees C but are not produced by cells at lower temperatures, such as 25 degrees C. Thermoregulation of expression is due to temperature-dependent transcription of a regulatory cistron in the pilus-adhesin gene cluster. We have now identified and characterized a new regulatory locus (drdX) and show that a histone-like bacterial protein has an important role in this novel example of thermoregulation of transcription.\r"

The overall rates of severe lacerations were 8.3 and 1.5% for primiparous and multiparous women, respectively. Women who had midline episiotomies were nearly 50 times more likely and women who had mediolateral episiotomies were over eight times more likely to suffer a severe laceration than were women who did not undergo an episiotomy. Severe lacerations were also more common after use of forceps, in occiput transverse and posterior presentations, among women with smaller pelvic outlet measurements or lower prepregnant weight, and with larger fetuses. The same factors that caused a woman to have an increased risk of laceration also made performance of an episiotomy more likely. After statistical adjustment for these risk factors, mediolateral episiotomy was associated with a 2.5-fold reduction in the risk of severe lacerations among primiparous women, and a statistically nonsignificant 2.4-fold increase among multiparous women, compared with no episiotomy. Midline episiotomy was associated with statistically significant 4.2- and 12.8-fold increases in the risk of lacerations among primiparous and multiparous women, respectively. We conclude that the risks and benefits of midline episiotomy should be evaluated in a randomized clinical trial that compares policies of \"usual\" versus conservative use of episiotomy.\r"

Pregnancies ending after 24 weeks' gestation were evaluated for the following complications: pregnancy-induced hypertension, diabetes mellitus, preterm labor, premature rupture of membranes, placenta previa, and fetal growth retardation. A matched control group of normal fertile patients admitted to the obstetric service at Vanderbilt University Medical Center was used to compare the incidence of pregnancy complications among the groups. In the group treated by assisted reproduction, 81 pregnancies were singleton and nine were multiple gestations, whereas in the routine group, 84 were singleton and two were multiple gestations. In the group treated by assisted reproduction, 29 of 90 gestations (32%) ended before 24 weeks, compared with 18 of 86 (21%) in the routine group, a nonsignificant difference. Mean birth weight and gestational age were similar among the three groups for singleton gestations. Among multiple gestations, the mean (+/- standard error of the mean [SEM]) birth weights were 2513 +/- 115, 724 +/- 57, and 2282 +/- 132 g in the group treated by assisted reproduction, the group receiving routine methods, and the control group, respectively (P less than .001 when those treated by routine methods were compared with the other two groups).

Each Doppler study, conducted over 90 minutes after a 500-mL intravenous volume pre-load, was divided into three phases: 30 minutes of pre-anesthetic control, 30 minutes during epidural catheter placement and dosing, and 30 minutes after establishing effective regional blockade. During each phase, maternal blood pressure and pulse were monitored every 5 minutes, and continuous-wave Doppler recordings of the umbilical and uterine arteries were made at three separate intervals. Epidural placement and dosage techniques were similar for all patients; 0.25% bupivacaine solution was used and sensory levels of T6 obtained. The mean maternal systolic and diastolic blood pressures and pulse rate declined significantly, but no woman experienced hypotension. Mean systolic/diastolic ratios and pulsatility indices of the umbilical and uterine arteries did not change significantly during the study. We conclude that effective epidural anesthesia does not have a significant impact on Doppler flow characteristics of either the maternal or fetal umbilical vasculature, despite lowered maternal blood pressure and pulse rate.\r"

A randomized, controlled, prospective study was conducted to compare the efficacy of dorsal penile nerve block versus local anesthesia. Thirty infants were randomly divided into three equal groups (N = 10): an unanesthetized control group, a group given dorsal penile nerve block, and a group given local anesthesia. Heart rate, transcutaneous oxygen saturation, and crying were monitored continuously before, during, and after circumcision. During circumcision, both the dorsal penile nerve block group and the local-anesthesia group demonstrated smaller increases in heart rate, smaller drops in oxygen saturation, and less crying compared with unanesthetized controls (P less than .05). Both techniques worked well in anesthetizing the dorsal aspect of the penis; however, during those steps of circumcision involving trauma to the ventral aspect of the penis, the local-anesthesia group demonstrated smaller increases in heart rate and less crying compared with infants given dorsal penile nerve block (P less than .05). Cortisol levels measured 30 minutes postoperatively were lower in the local-anesthesia group than in either the controls or the dorsal penile nerve block group (P less than .05). Dorsal penile nerve block had no effect on postoperative cortisol levels. No complications occurred. Although both types of anesthesia attenuated the physiologic responses to circumcision, local anesthesia demonstrated greater efficacy than dorsal penile nerve block while being simpler to perform.\r"

Complications frequently described include injuries to the large and small bowels, bladder, and blood vessels. The world literature reports only eight cases of ureteral injury at laparoscopy. In this report, we present five additional cases of ureteral injury occurring at laparoscopy, in addition to a summary of those previously reported. Patients tend to present in the early postoperative period (48-72 hours) with low back pain, abdominal pain, leukocytosis, and peritonitis. The diagnosis should be made by intravenous pyelography; if possible, the injury should be stented by either the retrograde or percutaneous route. The injuries, except for one apparent trocar injury, involved the use of electrocoagulation, both unipolar and bipolar. The injuries occurred most commonly near the uterosacral ligaments. In 38% (five of 13) of the cases, the laparoscopy was performed for treatment of endometriosis. Three of the 13 patients eventually lost renal function of the affected side; two of these underwent a nephrectomy. Because visualization of the ureter near the cervix at the time of laparoscopy is difficult, especially in the presence of disease, laparoscopic procedures in this area must be carried out with caution.\r"

Pre-treatment cultures were obtained for endocervical Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis, and for endometrial C trachomatis and aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Overall, 46 subjects (35%) had endocervical cultures positive for N gonorrhoeae. Endocervical and endometrial cultures were positive for C trachomatis in 16 and 6%, respectively. Ninety-five percent of patients had at least one aerobic bacterium, 38% had at least one anaerobic bacterium, and only 2% had no organisms isolated from their endometrium. Fifty-seven subjects taking gentamicin-clindamycin (90.5%) and 64 subjects taking cefoxitin-doxycycline (95.5%) were clinically cured, a nonsignificant difference. Three subjects treated with gentamicin-clindamycin and one treated with cefoxitin-doxycycline required hysterectomy or salpingectomy for cure. Follow-up examinations and cultures were performed in 84% of the subjects. Post-treatment cultures for N gonorrhoeae were negative in all cases tested. Post-treatment endocervical and endometrial C trachomatis cultures were negative in ten of 11 subjects treated with gentamicin-clindamycin and in eight of nine treated with cefoxitin-doxycycline, a nonsignificant difference. We conclude that gentamicin-clindamycin and cefoxitin-doxycycline have similar clinical cure rates for acute pelvic inflammatory disease and are equivalent in eradicating genital N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis.\r"

  ".W": "For many years the most common treatment for retinoblastoma has been enucleation, generally performed on the affected eye in children with unilateral sporadic disease and on the more severely affected eye in children with bilateral disease. With refinements in conservative treatment methods, however, the affected eye now often may be salvaged and useful vision retained. Emphasizing this trend, we present our current approaches to managing retinoblastoma based on our experience with 324 patients, outlining our indications and pointing out a number of misconceptions about the role of enucleation, photocoagulation, cryotherapy, and radiotherapy in treating this condition. We also sketch some recent findings regarding the genetics of retinoblastoma and consider ways in which such research may lead to improved management of the disease.\r"

Seven patients suffered from aphakic bullous keratopathy and seven from pseudophakic bullous keratopathy. Postoperative follow-up was 7.6 months on the average. Best-corrected postoperative visual acuity was 20/60 or better in four cases and 20/200 or better in eight. Glaucoma was present before surgery in four eyes, which persisted in all cases and developed in four new cases. Results of gonioscopic examination showed the postoperative development of goniosynechiae in four eyes. Pseudophakodonesis of various extent was present in ten eyes. Preoperatively, cystoid macular edema was diagnosed angiographically in one case. It did not improve after surgery and was seen in three additional eyes postoperatively. Causes for postoperative visual acuity lower than 20/200 were cystoid macular edema in three cases, graft rejection in one case, central retinal scar in one case, and optic nerve atrophy in one case. A distortion of the pupil was seen in three eyes in miosis and in four additional eyes in mydriasis. Corneal thickness as well as anterior chamber depth were within normal limits. Fluorophotometric evaluation of the blood-aqueous barrier showed values comparable with those obtained after intracapsular cataract extraction and implantation of an iris-fixated IOL. Despite the relatively good visual results, the high postoperative incidence of cystoid macular edema and/or glaucoma may discourage the use of this technique.\r"

In 357 patients, 554 eyes (74%) did not require surgery and were managed with contact lenses or spectacles, 156 eyes (21%) in 137 patients either underwent penetrating keratoplasty (PK) (140 eyes) or surgery was recommended (16 eyes), and 36 eyes (4%) in 34 patients underwent epikeratoplasty. Comparing baseline and final examination findings, the nonsurgical group showed a significant improvement in average best-corrected visual acuity from 20/30 to 20/25, the PK group from 20/70 to 20/25, and the epikeratoplasty group from 20/40 to 20/30. Average keratometry was unchanged in the nonsurgical group, but decreased by 10.7 diopters (D) for the PK group and 6.5 D for the epikeratoplasty group. Corneal cylinder was unchanged in the nonsurgical group, whereas there was a reduction of the percentage of eyes with indeterminant cylinder from 55 to 2% in the PK group and from 36 to 0% in the epikeratoplasty group. Previous contact lens history, best-corrected visual acuity of 20/50 or worse, and average keratometry of 55 D or greater at baseline were associated with a significant risk for PK. No baseline variables were associated with significant risk for epikeratoplasty, suggesting that this group was similar to the nonsurgical group, except for contact lens intolerance. The nonsurgical management of keratoconus continues to play a predominant role in the management of this disorder in a referral population.\r"

One month later, the animals were equally subdivided into three groups of eight for limbal transplantation, conjunctival transplantation, and control without transplantation. During a 6-month postoperative follow-up, all corneas in the control group showed progressive vascularization and conjunctivalization. All corneas with limbal transplantation showed progressive decrease of vascularity, verified by fluorescein angiography. In contrast, all but one of the eight corneas of conjunctival transplantation showed progressive vascularization (P = 0.01). More important, the resultant epithelia showed corneal phenotype in limbal transplantation, but remained conjunctival in conjunctival transplantation, as verified by monoclonal antibodies AM-3, APSM-1, and AE-5. These results support the concept of the limbal location of corneal epithelial stem cells, and indicate that complete destruction of the limbal zone resulted in corneal vascularization and conjunctivalization, and that limbal transplantation has a better efficiency than conjunctival transplantation in restoring such destroyed corneal surface.\r"

CFIC was increased in diseased sites, but the iron concentration in crevicular fluid was not a good indicator of changes in disease severity resulting from periodontal treatment. Treatments produced an increase in the CFIC that may be more related to the status of the microcirculation than to the disease process itself.\r"

Extension fractures, type III patterns in which there is complete displacement, usually require operative intervention in the form of a closed reduction with percutaneous pin fixation. In those in which an adequate reduction is not achieved, an open reduction is the preferred alternative treatment. Recognition of the role of the anterior periosteum in interfering with an adequate reduction is important. In addition, determination of the posteromedial or posterolateral displacement of the distal fragment is important in recognizing which neurovascular structures are more likely to be injured, which pin to place first, and which surgical approach is proper for an open reduction. Flexion fractures, type II displaced fractures, often require pin fixation, and type III displaced fractures usually require an open reduction.\r"

Fractures of the proximal humerus in older children that cannot be adequately reduced and maintained should be treated with open reduction and internal fixation. Interposition of periosteum and biceps tendon can lead to difficulty in fracture reduction. Irreducible displaced fractures of the clavicular shaft, fractures that develop nonunion, and congenital pseudarthrosis of the clavicle can be treated by an intramedullary pin technique with bone grafting. Posterior displacement of fractures of the medical clavicle sometimes become an orthopedic emergency. Reduction by closed or open means should be accomplished to relieve compression of mediastinal structures. This injury does not require internal fixation. Types IV, V, and VI distal clavicle injuries require open reduction and reefing of the periosteal tube with occasional need for temporary lag-screw fixation. There is some debate about the type III injury. Large glenoid fractures involving the anterior rim that are associated with instability of the glenohumeral joint are best treated by open reduction and internal fixation.\r"

Internal fixation is often required in avulsion fractures of the tibial tubercle, reduced displaced fracture-separations of the proximal tibial epiphysis, fracture-separations of the distal femoral epiphysis displaced in the sagittal plane, and displaced Salter-Harris type III and IV fracture-separations. A displaced avulsion of the anterior intercondylar eminence of the tibia can sometimes be reduced using closed means but more often requires reduction by arthrotomy or with arthroscopy.

Furthermore, UV-crosslinked p220 was immunoprecipitated with anti-PRP8 antisera.

To characterize this enzyme, a rat liver cDNA library was screened with a monospecific antibody, and a 1.7-kilobase cDNA clone coding for mevalonate kinase was isolated. The complete DNA sequence was determined, and the longest open reading frame coded for a protein containing 395 amino acids with a deduced molecular weight of 41,990. Identification of the cDNA clone was confirmed by expression of enzyme activity in yeast and by protein sequence data obtained from sequencing purified rat mevalonate kinase. The deduced amino acid sequence of mevalonate kinase contained a motif for the ATP-binding site found in protein kinases, and it also showed sequence homology to the yeast RAR1 protein. The size of mevalonate kinase mRNA in rat liver was approximately 2 kilobases. Treatment with diets containing cholesterol-lowering agents caused an increase in both mevalonate kinase activity and mRNA levels, whereas diets containing 5% cholesterol lowered the levels of both enzyme activity and mRNA. These data indicate that long-term regulation of enzyme activity in rat liver is controlled by changes in the levels of mevalonate kinase mRNA.\r"

In this work, CAP has been converted into a site-specific DNA cleavage agent by incorporation of the chelator 1,10-phenanthroline at amino acid 10 of the helix-turn-helix motif. [(N-Acetyl-5-amino-1,10-phenanthroline)-Cys178]CAP binds to a 22-base-pair DNA recognition site with Kobs = 1 x 10(8) M-1. In the presence of Cu(II) and reducing agent, [(N-acetyl-5-amino-1,10-phenanthroline)-Cys178]CAP cleaves DNA at four adjacent nucleotides on each DNA strand within the DNA recognition site. The DNA cleavage reaction has been demonstrated using 40-base-pair and 7164-base-pair DNA substrates. The DNA cleavage reaction is not inhibited by dam methylation of the DNA substrate. Such semisynthetic site-specific DNA cleavage agents have potential applications in chromosome mapping, cloning, and sequencing.\r"

A HepG2 cDNA library constructed in a yeast expression vector was used to transform yeast strains with mutations in adenine biosynthetic genes. Clones were isolated that complement mutations in the yeast ADE2, ADE3, and ADE8 genes. The cDNA that complemented the ade8 (phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase, GART) mutation, also complemented the ade5 (phosphoribosylglycinamide synthetase) and ade7 [phosphoribosylaminoimidazole synthetase (AIRS; also known as PAIS)] mutations, indicating that it is the human trifunctional GART gene. Supporting data include homology between the AIRS and GART domains of this gene and the published sequence of these domains from other organisms, and localization of the cloned gene to human chromosome 21, where the GART gene has been shown to map. The cDNA that complemented ade2 (phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase) also complemented ade1 (phosphoribosylaminoimidazole succinocarboxamide synthetase), supporting earlier data suggesting that in some organisms these functions are part of a bifunctional protein. The cDNA that complemented ade3 (formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase) is different from the recently isolated human cDNA encoding this enzyme and instead appears to encode a related mitochondrial enzyme.\r"

The pure vacuoles were capable of degrading hemoglobin to small fragments with a pH optimum of 5-5.5. Proteolysis in the vacuoles appears to be an ordered process, requiring an aspartic protease to clip intact hemoglobin before other proteolytic activities can function efficiently. The vacuoles do not contain other hydrolases commonly found in lysosomes and therefore appear to be unique proteolytic organelles designed specifically to degrade hemoglobin.\r"

  ".U": "90222149\r", 
  ".W": "Because of its immunodominancy, and because it is conserved in different geographical isolates of Plasmodium falciparum, the repetitive sequence of the circumsporozoite protein, (Asn-Ala-Asn-Pro)n [(NANP)n], has been envisaged for the development of an anti-falciparum malaria subunit vaccine. However, the murine immune response to (NANP)n peptides, either carrier-free or coupled to carrier proteins, was shown to be inducible only by using strong (e.g., Freund's) adjuvants. Furthermore, response to the carrier-free peptide, administered in adjuvant, is genetically restricted to I-Ab mice. In the present paper, we report that high titers of antibodies against the NANP repetitive epitope were obtained in responder C57BL/6 (H-2b) mice when they were primed with live BCG (bacillus Calmette-Guerin Mycobacterium tuberculosis var. bovis) and immunized once with the synthetic peptide (NANP)40 coupled to tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) without the use of any adjuvant. This approach also led to the production of high titers of anti-NANP antibodies in ASW (H-2s), B10.RIII (H-2r), BALB/c (H-2d), C3H/He (H-2k), and DBA/1 (H-2q) nonresponder mice after two injections of the conjugate. In both cases, BCG priming was obligatory for the induction of antibodies reacting with the synthetic peptide. The levels of anti-NANP antibodies in nonresponder BALB/c mice were demonstrated to be comparable to the levels induced after PPD-(NANP)40 immunization in Freund's complete or incomplete adjuvant. The antibodies induced were also capable of recognizing P. falciparum sporozoites in immunofluorescence assays and, furthermore, these antibodies inhibited the penetration of live sporozoites into human hepatocytes in vitro. This system functioned independently of the subjects' resistance or susceptibility to BCG infection. Given the widespread natural exposure to mycobacterial antigens and the extensive use of BCG and PPD in the human population, this approach might be envisaged for vaccination with malaria peptides.\r"

An antisense oligonucleotide, derived from the sequence of the clone, specifically inhibited the expression of the slow, outward current observed in cells injected with mRNAs isolated from the parent tissues (i.e., kidney, heart, and uterus), indicating that the cloned gene underlies the major K+ current expressed from RNA isolated from these tissues.\r"

Restriction site and DNA sequence comparisons between PPDK genomic and leaf cDNA clones have revealed which gene encodes the isozyme involved in C4 photosynthesis. The region flanking the 5' end of this gene contains two 30-base-pair (bp) repetitive elements that may be involved in its light-regulated expression. Sequence analysis of genomic and leaf cDNA clones has also shown that the entire 7.3-kDa PPDK chloroplast transit peptide is encoded in the 436-bp first exon. Northern blot experiments with probes specific for the first exon and the 3' end of the gene showed that the smaller PPDK transcripts in roots and etiolated leaves [3.0 kilobases (kb) vs. the 3.5-kb green leaf transcript] lack the sequence encoding the chloroplast transit peptide. In addition, results from cDNA library screens have confirmed that the root transcript is approximately 50-fold less abundant than the green leaf transcript. Finally, sequence comparisons among cDNA clones from green leaves and roots and genomic clones representing both members of the PPDK gene family demonstrate that the green leaf transcript encoding the C4 isozyme and the root transcript are derived from the same gene.\r"

Its use has been limited by the rapid development of resistance by parasites around the world. We have determined the cycloguanil- and pyrimethamine-sensitivity status of 10 isolates of Plasmodium falciparum and have sequenced in all these isolates the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR; 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate: NADP+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.5.1.3) portion of the DHFR-thymidylate synthase (TS; 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate: dUMP C-methyltransferase, EC 2.1.1.45) gene. Instead of the known serine-to-asparagine change at position 108 that is important in pyrimethamine resistance, a serine-to-threonine change at the same position is found in cycloguanil-resistant isolates along with an alanine-to-valine change at position 16. We conclude that pyrimethamine and cycloguanil resistance most commonly involve alternative mutations at the same site. However, we also have identified a parasite with a unique set of changes that results in resistance to both drugs.\r"

Clinical reports and field studies have suggested that some parasites refractory to proguanil can be treated with pyrimethamine, and vice versa. Analysis of the P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from different parasites reveals the structural basis for differential susceptibility to these antifolate drugs. Parasites harboring a pair of point mutations from Ala-16 to Val-16 and from Ser-108 to Thr-108 are resistant to cycloguanil (the active metabolite of proguanil) but not to pyrimethamine. A single Asn-108 mutation, on the other hand, confers resistance to pyrimethamine with only a moderate decrease in susceptibility to cycloguanil. Significant cross-resistance to both drugs occurs in parasites having mutations that include Ser-108----Asn-108 and Ile-164----Leu-164. These results reflect the distinct structures of pyrimethamine and cycloguanil and suggest fine differences in binding within the active site cavity of DHFR. Alternative inhibitors, used alone or in combination, may be effective against some strains of cycloguanil- or pyrimethamine-resistant malaria.\r"

Here we show that Cat-301 recognizes an antigen in human cortex that is closely related, if not identical, to the antigen in laboratory animals. Further, we use Cat-301 to demonstrate an organization of molecularly defined neurons in primary and secondary visual cortex (cortical areas V1 and V2) of the human. The organization demonstrated with Cat-301 in human area V1 correlates with the organization of ocular dominance columns demonstrated by cytochrome oxidase histochemistry. The organization demonstrated with Cat-301 in human area V2 correlates with the thick stripes of the cytochrome oxidase pattern. The present observations provide evidence for a visual pathway in human cortex homologous to the magnocellular pathway in macaque, a pathway involved in processing the low-contrast, achromatic, and moving components of visual stimuli.\r"

  ".U": "90222166\r", 
  ".W": "Oncogenic forms of ras proteins are synthesized in the cytosol and must become membrane associated to cause malignant transformation. Palmitic acid and an isoprenoid (farnesol) intermediate in cholesterol biosynthesis are attached to separate cysteine residues near the C termini of H-ras, N-ras, and Kirsten-ras (K-ras) exon 4A-encoded proteins. These lipid modifications have been suggested to promote or stabilize the association of ras proteins with membranes. Because preventing isoprenylation also prevents palmitoylation, examining the importance of isoprenylation alone has not been possible. However, the oncogenic human [Val12]K-ras 4B protein is not palmitoylated but is isoprenylated, membrane associated, and fully transforming. We therefore constructed mutant [Val12]K-ras 4B proteins that were not isoprenylated to examine the effects of isoprenylation in the absence of palmitoylation. The nonisoprenylated mutant proteins both failed to associate with membranes and did not transform NIH 3T3 cells. In addition, inhibition of isoprenoid and cholesterol synthesis with the drug compactin also decreased [Val12]K-ras 4B protein isoprenylation and membrane association. These results unequivocally demonstrate that isoprenylation, rather than palmitoylation, is essential for ras membrane binding and ras transforming activity. These findings clearly indicate the biological significance of ras protein modification by farnesol and suggest that this modification may be important for facilitating the processing, trafficking, and biological activity of other isoprenylated proteins. Because K-ras is the most frequently activated oncogene in a wide spectrum of human malignancies, study of this pathway could lead to important therapeutic treatments.\r"

Depending on the culture conditions, these cells express either the glial fibrillary acidic protein or neurofilaments. In addition, the cells can display adrenergic, D1 and D2 dopaminergic, muscarinic, and 5-hydroxytryptamine type 2 serotoninergic receptors, which are coupled either to the adenylate cyclase or to the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathways. The panel of receptors for neurotransmitters exhibited by these lines closely resembles that of primary striatal neurons. Results suggest that plastic common precursors of astrocytes and neurons persist in the striatum at a late developmental stage. As these permanent cell lines constitute an unlimited source of homogenous cell material, we suggest that they should be useful for molecular and pharmacological studies on the mechanisms and regulation of signal transduction as well as the commitment, plasticity, and differentiation of neural cells.\r"

  ".W": "Three major difficulties have hindered the general application of in vivo recombination techniques to library screening: (i) the original selection could not be applied to libraries prepared in phage vectors lacking amber mutations, (ii) nonirradiated packaging extracts gave high backgrounds even when amber mutated vectors were used, and (iii) most red- vectors lacked rap, a recently discovered phage gene promoting phage-plasmid recombination. Here we describe a selection scheme for phage bearing suppressor tRNA plasmids, which relies upon an Escherichia coli host bearing an amber mutation in the dnaB gene. The selection is tight enough to allow library screening by recombination, is applicable to almost every phage vector in common use, and overcomes the background associated with nonirradiated packaging extracts. We also describe an ancillary plasmid that supplies the rap gene function in trans, permitting the recombination level to be raised fruitfully in phage libraries lacking endogenous rap. Finally, we demonstrate simple procedures for preparing and detecting phages that have lost integrated suppressor tRNA plasmids by homologous recombination.\r"

  ".W": "The distribution of the alpha subspecies of protein kinase C (PKC) in rat brain was demonstrated immunocytochemically by using polyclonal antibodies raised against a synthetic oligopeptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal sequence of alpha-PKC. The alpha-PKC-specific immunoreactivity was widely but discretely distributed in both gray and white matter. The immunoreactivity was associated predominantly with neurons, particularly with perikaryon, dendrite, or axon, but little was seen in the nucleus. Glial cells expressed this PKC subspecies poorly, if at all. The highest density of immunoreactivity was seen in the olfactory bulb, septohippocampal nucleus, indusium griseum, islands of Calleja, intermediate part of the lateral septal nucleus, and Ammon's horn. A moderately high density of the immunoreactivity was seen in the anterior olfactory nucleus, anterior commissure, cingulate cortex, dentate gyrus, compact part of the substantia nigra, interpeduncular nucleus, inferior olive, and olivocerebellar tract. This distribution pattern was consistent with that obtained by in situ hybridization histochemistry. The distribution of alpha-PKC immunoreactivity was different from that of beta I-, beta II-, and gamma-PKC immunoreactivity. These findings suggest that alpha-PKC is involved heavily in the control of specific functions of some restricted neurons.\r"

The cDNA for rat HGF was isolated by screening a liver cDNA library with oligonucleotides based on the partial N-terminal amino acid sequence of the beta subunit of purified rat HGF. HGF is encoded in an mRNA of about 6 kilobases. Both alpha and beta subunits of HGF are specified in a single open reading frame for a 728-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular weight of 82,904. The N-terminal part of HGF has a signal sequence and a prosequence with 30 and 25 amino acid residues, respectively. The mature heterodimer structure is derived proteolytically from this single pre-pro precursor polypeptide. The calculated molecular weights of the alpha and beta subunits are 50,664 and 25,883, respectively, and each subunit has two potential N-linked glycosylation sites. The amino acid sequence of HGF is 38% identical with that of plasminogen. The alpha subunit of HGF contains four \"kringle\" structures, and the beta subunit has 37% amino acid identity with the serine protease domain of plasmin. Northern blot analysis revealed that HGF mRNA was expressed in rat various tissues, including the liver, kidney, lung, and brain.\r"

Tests of these viral genomes for transmission of v-abl and neo markers showed more stable coexpression in a protein fusion construct. The neo fusion was subcloned from this v-abl construct into a promoterless c-abl fragment, and the resulting DNA was used to transform embryonic stem cells. Direct screening of genomic DNAs showed that a high proportion of drug-resistant clones arose from homologous recombination into the endogenous c-abl locus.\r"

  ".W": "I didactically compared the breast as a glandular cone with an envelope of skin and subcutaneous tissue. The aesthetic alterations of the breast are classified in four groups related to form, to volume, to grams, and to ptosis in centimeters. An imaginary plane that passes by the mammary sulcus (plane A) will determine the area of the breast that is ptotic. The projection of this plane in the anterior part of the breast is called point A. The distance between point A and the nipple will give in centimeters the amount of ptosis. I use this distance to draw geometrically in the breast the amount of excess of skin to be removed to correct the ptosis. In group I, the volume is normal and part of the mammary gland is under plane A. In this type of breast, the skin is resected, and since there is no excess of breast tissue, the breast that is under plane A is used as an inferior pedicle flap to give a better volume to the new breast. In group II, the base of the breast is large, the height is normal, and the volume is increased by the enlargement of the base. In this type of breast, the excess of breast under plane A and a wedge under the nipple are resected to reach the normal volume at the end of the surgery. In group III, the base is normal and the volume of the breast is increased by the height. For treatment, I resect the excess of breast under plane A as well as a segment at the base to reduce its height. In group IV, the volume of the breast is increased by the size of the base and the height of the cone, and I treat by resection of the excess of tissue under the ptotic area, a wedge under the areola, and a transversal segment in the base to reduce all the dimensions. In the final result of this technique in the majority of patients I will obtain a short scar. This technique was used in 1083 patients from January of 1979 to May of 1988.\r"

Applying strict case definitions, four patients had definite and one patient possible pneumococcal endocarditis. The commonest presenting signs and symptoms were malaise, fever, and congestive heart failure. Predisposing conditions were previous splenectomy in one case and a valve prosthesis in another. The aortic valve was the most common site of infection. In four of the five patients the diagnosis of endocarditis was made during life. These patients were treated appropriately, i.e. with antibiotics to which S. pneumoniae is sensitive. In three patients, surgical intervention was performed in the acute phase because of progressive heart failure. Paravalvular abscesses were observed at surgery in all these cases. The four patients treated in our series recovered fully; the single fatal case constituted an unrecognized case of pneumococcal endocarditis. If recognized and treated appropriately (particularly with early selective surgery) endocarditis can be cured. In a statistical analysis of 36 patients with pneumococcal endocarditis reported during the past five years, we found a significantly higher occurrence and mortality in men than in women; no other clinical features were associated with a poor outcome of illness.\r"

  ".W": "The results of evaluation of the hila and mediastinum with 67Ga scans are contradictory, as are the recommendations by different investigators on the use of 67Ga scintigraphy in the clinical evaluation of patients with primary lung carcinoma. Nevertheless, the economy and logistic simplicity of evaluating local and distant metastases with a single imaging procedure are attractive, especially because the symptoms may not enable the physician to make a correct identification of the organ systems affected by metastases. Neumann and Hoffer state that \"at present conventional Ga-67 scanning techniques cannot be recommended for preoperative staging of mediastinal lymph node metastases in lung cancer patients.\" According to Waxman, 67Ga scintigraphy, relative to other imaging modalities, is a sensitive indicator of hilar spread of a tumor. However, because of the normally high background activity within the sternum and spine, mediastinal abnormalities may be poorly detected. Since most pulmonary tumors metastasize via regional nodes to the pulmonary hilum and then to the mediastinum, the high sensitivity for the detection of pulmonary hilar abnormalities and the high specificity for detection of mediastinal lesions suggest that gallium scintigraphy is a valuable adjunctive test when used appropriately. The results obtained locally are probably the best guide for individual physicians in the selection of diagnostic tests for their patients. Gallium scans may thus be helpful in the clinical evaluation of patients with lung cancer. Although gallium scans identify mediastinal node involvement, there is considerable controversy over the relationship between the sensitivity and specificity of the method. By detecting distant extrathoracic metastases, the 67Ga scan may identify a small group of patients who can be spared a needless operation. Gallium scanning fails specifically for metastases within the brain; thus, it does not supplant CT scans of the brain and it is less sensitive than bone scans in detecting osseous metastases. Gallium scanning of patients with small-cell lung cancer is not useful in the selection of therapy but does become important from a prognostic standpoint. Patients with extrathoracic involvement by small-cell carcinoma of the lung are known to have limited survival times compared with those of patients with thoracic involvement alone. In identifying patients with extensive disease, the oncologist is thus provided with prognostic information that may be useful in the counseling of the patient and the patient's family.\r"

Even the pathologist encountering a lymph node cannot predict from the macroscopic appearance whether a lymph node is involved with tumor. Because enlarged lymph nodes may be free of tumor, and nodes of normal size may contain metastases, the accuracy of CT in the detection of hilar involvement by tumor is limited. The primary role of imaging procedures in the preoperative staging of patients with bronchogenic carcinoma is to determine the need for further prethoracotomy assessment. Decisions regarding operability of lung cancer should be based on tissue verification. Recognition of hilar abnormality requires a thorough understanding of normal bronchial and pulmonary vascular anatomy. The administration of intravenous contrast material can facilitate the distinction on a CT scan image of enhancing pulmonary vessels from nonenhancing hilar lymph nodes.\r"

On the basis of their studies, Libshitz and McKenna question whether CT has any utility in evaluating mediastinal lymph nodes. Staples et al believe that CT and mediastinoscopy are complementary, and that many patients who are considered candidates for surgical resection should have both. It is clear that the overall sensitivity and specificity of CT are variable from study to study. In recent studies that have subjected patients to exhaustive lymph node dissection, and in which there has been meticulous correlation between the lymph nodes identified on CT and those removed at surgery, it seems clear that the sensitivity of CT in predicting the absence of metastatic disease is unacceptably low. However, there is another way to approach these statistics. Recent studies have shown that patients with mediastinal microscopic metastasis discovered at the time of thoracotomy have improved survival rates if the primary tumor and mediastinal metastases are all resected. Patients with macroscopic metastases in mediastinal nodes have a worse prognosis. Therefore, CT may be useful for screening patients to rule out the presence of macroscopic metastatic disease. If the mediastinal CT scan shows no enlarged lymph nodes, it seems reasonable to bypass the surgical staging procedure and proceed directly to thoracotomy. However, in order to determine the true pathologic stage of disease in the patient, a thorough mediastinal dissection must be carried out in these patients at the time of thoracotomy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The World Health Organization recognizes four main classifications of cell type. Squamous cell carcinoma is most often a central lesion that locally invades the hilus and mediastinum. Because of its localization within the chest, it shows the best survival statistics. Adenocarcinoma is probably the most common of the four cell types. It tends to present as a peripheral mass. Hilar, mediastinal, and extrathoracic metastases occur early in its course. Its 5-year survival rate is worse than that for squamous cell carcinoma. Alveolar cell carcinoma is considered by most to be a subtype of adenocarcinoma but demonstrates much better survival figures. Most typically it presents as a nodule, but is more often thought of as a diffuse or localized alveolar infiltrate. Large cell carcinoma resembles adenocarcinoma in that it is a peripheral mass, but often larger in size. Metastases are less frequent in large cell carcinoma than in adenocarcinoma. Large cell carcinoma demonstrates better survival figures than does adenocarcinoma. Small cell carcinoma is the most aggressive of the four cell types, having the worst prognosis. The classic presentation is the detection of hilar and mediastinal metastases while the primary tumor remains occult. Grossly enlarged hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes can be seen easily on chest radiograph and CT scan.\r"

Unusual parenchymal manifestations of lung cancer include a nodule or mass that may decrease in size without therapy; intrinsic calcification; thin-walled cavitation; a meniscus sign; unifocal or multifocal alveolar infiltrates; satellite nodules; and multiple well-defined pulmonary nodules or masses. Unusual bronchial manifestations of lung cancer include widely separated areas of segmental or lobar atelectasis, mucoid impaction of bronchi, and obstructive hyperinflation. In the pleural space, bronchogenic carcinoma may occasionally be manifested as spontaneous pneumothorax, diffuse nodular tumor spread, and isolated effusion. Unusual mediastinal manifestations of lung cancer include primary mediastinal bronchogenic carcinoma, \"downhill\" esophageal varices, pulmonary artery invasion and infarction, pericardial and cardiac invasion, and esophageal obstruction. In addition, lung cancer may arise as a complication of bullous lung disease and a number of conditions that cause focal or diffuse lung scarring. Through increased familiarity with these varied manifestations of lung cancer, and a high index of suspicion, it is hoped that the radiographic detection of lung cancer will be improved.\r"

The new AJCC staging system meets these requirements, with early international reports confirming its usefulness and validity. The diagnostic radiologist, often directs the pretreatment workup of these patients and should be familiar with this new system.\r"

  ".W": "In 1986, Pearson reported on the lung cancer experience in Toronto over the past 25 years. The number of unresectable operations had decreased from 25 to 5%. Operative mortality was down from 10 to 3% and 5-year survival increased from 23 to 40%. The reason for these statistics, he stated, was not better surgery but better selection of surgical candidates, due to invasive and noninvasive techniques. CT and MR imaging are part of those noninvasive techniques and also play an important role in guiding the invasive techniques. Although controversy exists regarding the proper size criteria and axis length in nodal assessment, and the use of imaging in staging T1N0M0 lung cancer, most clinicians rely on CT scans to evaluate the patient with lung cancer. No other imaging test is as comprehensive in evaluating the patient with lung cancer. The main role of MR imaging at this time is as a problem-solving tool. Focused MR imaging examinations should be used to evaluate or to resolve specific questions related to invasion of the chest wall, vascular structures, or brachial plexus, and adrenal mass characterization. MR imaging is also useful in evaluating the hilum and mediastinum in patients who cannot receive intravenous contrast for CT evaluation. The overall accuracy of CT and MR imaging is disappointing, particularly in crucial areas of determining operability such as distinguishing between patients with Stage IIIA or IIIB disease. It is unlikely that CT diagnosis can significantly improve; however, there is substantial potential for improved diagnostic accuracy with MR imaging as continued research moves this technology forward. The future may bring improved tissue characterization and vascular evaluation. At present, CT remains the procedure of choice in the initial assessment of the patient with lung cancer. The radiologist must be prepared to interpret these imaging studies in light of the specific findings that determine the stage and thus potential resectability of lung cancer.\r"

The preoperative prediction of postsurgical loss in lung function can be made accurately by using the quantitative ventilation-perfusion lung scan technique. Either a regional ventilation study or perfusion study may be used for the prediction, but analysis of regional ventilation distribution appears to be a better parameter than that of perfusion distribution for the prediction of postoperative loss of FEV1. In the rare case of a patient with a marked ventilation-perfusion deficit, quantitative distribution of both ventilation and perfusion may be needed for an accurate assessment of postsurgical lung function.\r"

The major actors in the discovery of intravenous urography were urologists. Despite the availability of urography, the preeminence of retrograde pyelography was initially maintained because of its superior demonstration of the pelvicalyceal system. Selective renal angiography, high-dose intravenous urography, and nephrotomography provided excellent radiologic means for study of the renal parenchyma and put radiologists firmly in charge of uroradiology, a position further strengthened by the advent of ultrasonography and computed tomography.\r"

Thirty-six patients with normal VCUG results and normal renal and bladder ultrasound (US) studies served as the control group for 39 patients with vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) and 26 patients with urinary tract disorders other than reflux. The site of the ureteric orifice and duration, direction, and turbulence of the jets were recorded. Duration varied from 0.4 sec to 7.5 sec and depended largely on fluid intake. Duration varied in an individual patient by up to 2 sec from one jet to another. The direction of the normal jet was anteromedial and upward. Jets from refluxing ureters can appear normal. Severe renal parenchymal scarring reduced frequency and amplitude of the jets. Doppler analysis of the ureteric jet does not allow diagnosis or exclusion of VUR. Color Doppler was more sensitive in demonstrating ureteric jets than was gray-scale, real-time US and facilitated the study, but it was equally unable to help predict reflux.\r"

A study was undertaken to determine whether any measurable parameter predicts the presence of vesicoureteric reflux. Measurements of mean urine jet velocity, longitudinal angle, transverse angle, and distance of the origin of the jet from the midline of the bladder were obtained on 31 infants and children (62 ureters) with a proved urinary tract infection. Of these measurements, only the distance of the ureteric orifice from the midline of the bladder was found to correlate with vesicoureteric reflux (mean distance in the reflux group, 10.25 mm +/- 2.40 (standard deviation [SD]); in the nonreflux group, 7.98 mm +/- 2.40 [P = .004]). The authors conclude that the more laterally positioned the ureteric orifice, the more likely it is to reflux. Color Doppler ultrasound measurement of the laterality of the ureteric orifice may be useful for predicting which children with a urinary tract infection would benefit from voiding cystourethrography.\r"

  ".W": "The authors retrospectively evaluated 12 patients with congenital (neonatal) neuroblastoma to assess the utility of newer imaging modalities. Findings at prenatal ultrasound (US), performed in four patients, were nonspecific (hydramnios and hydrops fetalis) in two and consistent with a suprarenal mass (one solid, one cystic) in the other two. Postnatal US helped accurately detect adrenal tumors (solid or complex, with one exception) but was less accurate in the diagnosis of metastatic disease to the liver. Computed tomography accurately depicted all primary tumors and liver metastases. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging helped establish the correct diagnosis in three patients. This study again confirmed the benign course of neonatal neuroblastoma, with 50% of the patients classified with stage IV-S disease and two deaths occurring in the series, both due to complications. Therefore, aggressive diagnostic imaging is less desirable, and US is therefore very useful, despite its limitations. The prenatal detection and solid appearance of a suprarenal mass makes the diagnosis of neuroblastoma very likely, as does the presence of liver lesions. In the absence of these characteristic findings, US should be repeated to exclude adrenal hemorrhage. MR imaging seems to be a good alternative in some instances.\r"

Rectangular pieces of 10 fresh aortas were submerged in saline solution and scanned from the intimal side. On US images a characteristic double-line pattern, consisting of an inner and an outer echogenic line separated by a relatively hypoechoic line, was seen. This configuration was initially interpreted as tunica intima, tunica media, and tunica adventitia. The thickness of each layer on the US images was measured by means of a computer-assisted procedure and on histologic specimens was measured by means of stereomicroscopy. The correlation between the two measurements was poor. Experiments in which intima and part of the media were removed did not change the US appearance. Plexiglas, metal plates, and plastic foil showed a similar double-line pattern. A needle experiment disclosed that the inner echogenic and the hypoechoic lines were displayed in front of the true water-tissue interface, which was represented by the outer echogenic line. The authors conclude that the double-line pattern is thus an artifact.\r"

The ability of each of five different MR imaging-based tests to lateralize the seizure disorder was determined. In order of decreasing usefulness the tests were (a) hippocampal formation (HF) volume measurements, (b) visual grading of MR images for unilateral HF atrophy, (c) anterior temporal lobe (ATL) volume measurements, (d) visual grading of MR images for unilateral ATL atrophy, and (e) evidence of unilateral medial temporal lobe signal intensity abnormalities on long repetition time MR images. A right-side minus left-side volume (designated DHF) was obtained to quantify unilateral HF atrophy with a single number. Patients with right-sided seizures had a median DHF of -0.4 cm3, while those with left-sided seizures had a median DHF of 0.8 cm3, consistent with atrophy of the HF ipsilateral to the seizure disorder. Conservative volumetric threshold values (-0.2 cm3 and 0.6 cm3), separating individual DHF measurements into right-side abnormal, indeterminate, and left-side abnormal, allowed DHF measurements to be 76% sensitive and 100% specific for correct seizure lateralization.\r"

A dynamic multi-image environment allows for simultaneous display of magnetic resonance, computed tomography, digital subtraction angiography, and positron emission tomography images in multiple windows, adjusted for common coordinates with reference to stereotactic frame fiducial markers. Linkages between images allow information interchange between different modalities and different views: Points and regions defined in one image can be transferred to others, and cursor coordinates in one image can be calculated and dynamically projected in other images. Phantom studies show that the system distortions are minor and that the system is suitable for clinical use. The system provides exceptional advantages over previous imaging procedures for stereotactic surgery.\r"

No biliary or gallbladder disease was found in any patient. Sincalide was slowly administered intravenously, and the gallbladder was examined with ultrasound every 5 minutes for 60 minutes. The average decreases in length, height, and width of the gallbladder were 15%, 23%, and 21%, respectively. In only four of the 15 patients was there a decrease by more than 50% in any of these dimensions. The average decrease in gallbladder volume was 33% (range, 0%-97%), with no change in gallbladder volume in four patients. There is considerable variability in gallbladder response to administration of sincalide in the fasting hospitalized patient. Lack of contraction of the gallbladder after injection of cholecystokinin should not be considered a major criterion in the diagnosis of acute acalculous cholecystitis.\r"

At ultrasonography, one lesion appeared anechoic but the other two were hypoechoic. Unenhanced computed tomography demonstrated the lesions to be hyperattenuating or isoattenuating relative to surrounding liver parenchyma, and no lesions enhanced with administration of contrast material. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in one case and demonstrated the lesion to be markedly hyperintense with a spin-echo (SE) 2,500/80 (repetition time msec/echo time msec) sequence. All the lesions were resected and found to be filled with viscous mucinous fluid. The CHFCs are not neoplasms and must be differentiated from cystic neoplasms and hypovascular solid tumors. When a subcapsular lesion demonstrated the varied appearance described, a diagnosis of CHFC should be considered.\r"

Abdominal radiography depicted the mass in all cases. Excretory urography demonstrated organ displacement without tumor invasion in all cases. Sonography showed multiloculated fluid in 61% of cases and a unicameral mass in 39% of cases. All but one of the multiloculated lymphangiomas had thick septa. Sonography also depicted the fluid as uncomplicated in 56% of cases. The remainder had debris that sometimes layered in the dependent portion of the cyst. Computed tomography (CT) showed a unicameral mass in 57% and a septated mass in 43% of cases. CT also showed thin, smooth walls in 79% and thick, irregular walls in 21% of cases. At CT the fluid contents were found to be homogeneous and of fluid attenuation in 64% and were complex in 36% of cases. The attenuation of fluid in one case was the same as that of retroperitoneal fat. In two cases the mass contained mural calcification. The most characteristic radiologic finding of lymphangioma of the retroperitoneum is an elongated tumor containing uncomplicated fluid with or without septa. Chyle and mural calcification are very uncommon in this location.\r"

A Doppler spectrum was obtained in renal segmental arteries. The RI was calculated at increasing heart rates from 70 to 120 beats per minute. There was a statistically significant decrease in RI with increasing heart rate (heart rate of 70: RI = 0.7 +/- 0.06; heart rate of 120: RI = 0.57 +/- 0.06; P less than .001), while blood pressure and cardiac output remained constant. To overcome this source of variance, the observed RI can be corrected for heart rate by using the following regression equation. For a heart rate of 80 beats per minute, corrected RI = observed RI - 0.0026(80 - observed heart rate). In interpreting the RI in renal allograft examinations, the actual heart rate of a patient must be taken into account. However, the clinical significance of standardizing the RI for heart rate requires further investigation.\r"

Before treatment, SPECT had a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 98%; after treatment, 92% and 99%, respectively. In addition, SPECT allowed better anatomical localization and showed the entire extent of lesions at 36 sites. SPECT was of special value after treatment in excluding disease at 16 sites with residual masses seen at computed tomography (CT). Long-term follow-up in these patients showed that their condition was in complete remission and that the CT appearance of a residual mass does not always mean residual cancer. Thus, Ga-67 SPECT is a suitable imaging technique for monitoring the response of lymphoma to treatment.\r"

It draws significantly on the authors' experience with the Radiology Diagnostic Oncology Group, a cooperative group funded by the National Cancer Institute, which conducts comparative studies of the ability of diagnostic imaging modalities to enable the staging of various types of cancer including that of the prostate gland, lung, pancreas, colon, and rectum. The results from 2 1/2 years of the experience of this group hold promise for the importance of this approach to the future growth of radiologic research.\r"

The function of these compounds in their natural habitat is linked to various aspects of species survival, and the compounds have also served as characteristic chemical markers through successive trophic levels. Fundamental questions concerning the locus of synthesis in complex and intricate assemblies of plants and animals and the pathways of biosynthesis are beginning to be answered. It is now apparent that the marine environment gives rise to some distinctive chemistry, which is generated along characteristic pathways. Some of the newly described compounds have already become valuable tools in biomedicine.\r"

Unlike simple Mendelian characteristics, genetic variance for behavioral dimensions and disorders rarely accounts for more than half of the phenotypic variance, and multiple genes with small effects appear to be involved rather than one or two major genes. Genetic research on behavior will be transformed by techniques of molecular biology that can be used to identify DNA sequences responsible for behavioral variation. However, the importance of nongenetic factors and the multigenetic control of behavior require new strategies to detect DNA markers that account for small amounts of behavioral variation.\r"

Conversion between the two forms of OxyR is rapid and reversible. Both the oxidized and the reduced forms of the OxyR protein are capable of binding to three diverse sequences upstream of OxyR-regulated promoters, but the interactions of the two forms of OxyR with the promoter regions are different. The results suggest that direct oxidation of the OxyR protein brings about a conformational change by which OxyR transduces an oxidative stress signal to RNA polymerase.\r"

Two interphase and all mitotic c-Abl sites are phosphorylated by cdc2 kinase isolated from either interphase or mitotic cells, with the mitotic cdc2 having an 11-fold higher activity. Inhibition of phosphatases with okadaic acid in interphase cells leads to the phosphorylation of c-Abl mitotic sites, indicating that those sites are preferentially dephosphorylated during interphase. The differential phosphorylation of c-Abl in the cell cycle is therefore determined by an equilibrium between cdc2 kinase and protein phosphatase activities. Treatment of interphase cells with okadaic acid leads to a rounded morphology similar to that observed during mitosis.\r"

Proteolytic cleavage of the HIV-1 gag polyprotein (p55) to the viral structural protein p24 was inhibited in chronically infected CEM cells. Antiviral activity was observed in the nanomolar range (with one compound active below 10 nanomolar) in three different cell systems, as assessed by p24 antigen and syncytium formation. Cytotoxicity was not detected at 10 and 5 micromolar in C8166 and JM cells, respectively, indicating a high therapeutic index for this new class of HIV proteinase inhibitors.\r"

The radiographs were distributed to three members of the staff who marked the 14 points required for calculating rotation with the four methods. The points were digitized, and rotation calculated by computer. The results showed no significant difference in the calculated rotation of the two vertebrae, or between the results of the three markers. Stokes's method was significantly the least accurate. The other three methods were not significantly different but Bunnell's method appeared to give more consistent results.\r"

Forty-six of the 100 patients evaluated completed the trial, of whom 41 stated that they would wish to use the system regularly. Twenty-nine of the 41 continue to use the plug daily since the trial finished. The remainder withdrew mainly during the early stages of the trial because of leakage (ten patients), discomfort (11) or difficulties (12), all largely related to extrusion of the plug from the colostomy. There were no discernible features to predict in whom the plug was beneficial. Patients who irrigated the colostomy retained the plug longer (16.5 hours), on average, than those with natural evacuation (8.5 hours). However, even in the latter, the time increased with use of the system (week 1, 7.5 hours; week 4, 9.8 hours). Longer periods of retention of the plug appeared to be associated with improved stomal continence. Results from this trial confirm the potential of the Conseal Colostomy System incorporating a disposable colostomy plug to restore continence and improve life-style in more than one-third of patients with colostomies.\r"

All had conditions that precluded access to the superior vena cava or other sites in the upper part of the torso. Patients ranged in age from 18 to 59 years. The double lumen central venous catheter was inserted using aseptic technique in the operating room, and the catheter exit site was dressed using sterile technique every 48 hours afterward. Patients received all irradiated blood product transfusions, intravenous fluids, intravenous antibiotics, parenteral alimentation and autologous bone marrow reinfusion through the catheter. The duration of severe neutropenia (less than 500 neutrophils per microliter) and severe thrombocytopenia (less than 20,000 platelets per microliter) ranged from zero to 24 days (median of 22 days) and five to 20 days (median of 15 days), respectively. Catheters remained in the groin area 23 to 45 days (median of 35 days). Complications included one catheter-related Streptococcus species infection and one Escherichi coli bacteremia. These infections resolved with the catheter in place after appropriate institution of antibiotics. No episodes of thrombosis, kinking, migration, extravasation of drugs or local infection were noted. Central venous catheters can be safely inserted and maintained in the groin area even in severely immunocompromised patients receiving bone marrow transplants.\r"

In recent years, major centers with a large volume of patients and with experienced cytopathologists have popularized fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). We have used the Tru-Cut (Travenol Lab) needle biopsy (TCNB) as the primary method of diagnosing carcinoma of the breast in patients with suggestive masses. During the years 1980 to 1988, 96 patients underwent TCNB. Of the 90 patients with subsequently proved carcinoma, TCNB confirmed the diagnosis in 87 per cent and yielded false-negative and inconclusive diagnoses in 11 and 2 per cent, respectively. No false-positive diagnoses were seen. Any negative result in a suggestive mass was followed by an open biopsy. The sensitivity rate herein was 89 per cent, the specificity rate, 100 per cent, and the over-all accuracy rate, 88 per cent. As a diagnostic tool, TCNB has been highly accurate, safe and free from false-positive findings. Unlike FNAC, TCNB requires no special skills on the part of the clinician or pathologist, thus making it suitable for community practitioners.\r"

Future progress in the mortality of severe acute pancreatitis requires that we turn our attention toward the management of secondary pancreatic infections--abscess, infected pseudocyst and IPN. Review of 1,100 reported instances of secondary pancreatic infections reveals a pressing need for precise definitions of the individual infectious complication. In view of the marked discrepancy in definitions of disease between previous investigators, prior data must be seriously questioned, and doubt is cast upon long-standing recommendations for treatment. Recent advances in knowledge of the physiopathologic nature and diagnosis of secondary pancreatic infections promise improved surgical results. In particular, current diagnostic methods offer opportunities for more timely surgical intervention, avoiding the excessive mortality rate attendant upon delayed recognition. Furthermore, the use of condition-specific procedures, such as transcutaneous drainage for infected pseudocysts, debridement and sump drainage for pancreatic abscess and open drainage for IPN, may prove useful in combating the excessive morbidity and mortality rates caused by these conditions.\r"

Gonioscopy disclosed an ill-defined mass involving the angle and extending from 5 to 7:30 o'clock with diffuse pigmentation of the meshwork for 360 degrees. A sector iridectomy was performed inferiorly in his left eye. Histopathologic examination disclosed a diffuse malignant melanoma of the iris, mixed cell type. The patient was free of recurrence when examined at 18, 24 and 30 months following surgery. Two years and ten months following the iridectomy, the patient developed multiple metastatic bony lesions and a mass in the liver. Bone marrow aspiration from the sternum and biopsy from the iliac crest, respectively, showed metastatic malignant melanoma. He died shortly thereafter and an autopsy was not performed. The remote possibility of an occult, intraocular tumor such as a ciliary body melanoma or an internally located melanoma cannot be excluded. Assuming that this is indeed an iris melanoma, as our studies indicate, the rarity of this metastatic iris neoplasm is emphasized by noting that only 37 cases of iris melanomas with presumed metastases have been reported in the literature.\r"

  ".W": "Down syndrome is the most common chromosome abnormality of man. The isolated occurrence of any one of the most of the protean systemic and ocular features of Down syndrome is not specific to the disorder. The associated occurrence of several of these features, however, has distinguished affected individuals as having a distinct entity for nearly 125 years. Recent advances in prenatal diagnosis have allowed the earlier detection, in utero, of chromosomal abnormalities. Although predisposing genetic and environmental influences remain for the most part unknown, advances in molecular biology are leading to a greater understanding of other common disorders that occur with an increased incidence in individuals with Down syndrome; these include Alzheimer's disease, acute childhood leukemia, congenital heart malformations, and immunologic abnormalities. Associated ocular disorders can significantly affect the quality of life of individuals with Down syndrome. As more children with Down syndrome live into adulthood, the ophthalmologist will play an increasing role in allowing them to lead productive and meaningful lives.\r"

  ".W": "We retrospectively studied 19 cases of occlusive cervical carotid dissection encountered at our hospital between 1974 and 1984 and followed for 5-13 (mean 8.2) years to assess the long-term prognosis of the disease. Five patients had transient ischemic attacks, seven had minor stroke, six had major stroke, and one had epileptic seizures. Angiography demonstrated the typical string sign in 17 cases, a double lumen with occlusion in one, and multiple scalloped narrowings with distal occlusion in the other. Three patients died within 1 month and three remain severely disabled (overall mortality and major morbidity 32%), five have permanent deficits, and seven are neurologically intact; the remaining patient was lost to follow-up. Five patients were treated surgically (two had extracranial-intracranial bypass and three had cervical carotid exploration), and the other 14 were treated medically. The overall rate of reopening was 47% with eight of 10 patients demonstrating recanalization on control angiography and another patient demonstrating recanalization at surgery. These nine patients remain clinically stable on follow-up evaluations. However, vascular abnormalities in the healed arteries were notable and include kinking, fibromuscular dysplasia, dissecting aneurysms, intracranial occlusion, and a residual mural defect.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the efficacy of transcranial Doppler ultrasonography in 23 patients suffering from acute middle cerebral artery occlusion. The diagnosis of occlusion was most suggestive when all basal arteries except the affected middle cerebral artery were detectable. Enhanced blood flow velocity in the anterior cerebral artery due to leptomeningeal collateralization was used as a corroborating criterion. With frequent follow-up examinations, we monitored reperfusion of the M1 segment resulting from recanalization or embolus migration in 16 patients. Those patients undergoing recanalization within days after onset of the first symptoms revealed variable clinical courses and lesion patterns on computed tomography, indicating the crucial importance of early and efficient leptomeningeal collateral blood supply. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography was able to exclude middle cerebral artery occlusion with accuracy, which provides important clinical information. However, distal branch occlusions could not be detected with sufficient exactness.\r"

The literature and our experience with this case suggest that long-term anticoagulant therapy may prevent thrombotic episodes in patients with this disorder.\r"

Both groups were comparable as to age, sex, pain evolution time before treatment, and no treatment for renal colic in the six hours preceding trial drug administration. No significant differences were found between the two groups with respect to the evolution of pain after the first dose or in the frequency of administration of a second dose. Tolerability was good in both groups, but sweating and pain throughout the vein were observed in one patient in the Baralgin group. We concluded that diclofenac sodium constitutes an excellent alternative to pyrazolone analgesics, with the advantages of being monotherapy and having good tolerability, when used as intramuscular injection in ambulatory patients.\r"

  ".U": "90224170\r", 
  ".W": "Omeprazole represents the first agent of a unique class of acid inhibitory drugs, the proton pump inhibitors. Omeprazole inhibits basal gastric acid secretion, as well as gastrin-, histamine-, or pentagastrin-stimulated secretion, which results in decreased gastric acidity, decreased gastric acid output, and decreased gastric volume. Omeprazole is acid labile, necessitating its oral administration in an enteric-coated formulation. Bioavailability appears to be dose-dependent, with more drug being absorbed with increasing dosage as well as after repeated dosing. This is probably secondary to decreased gastric acidity and, therefore, less degradation of the administered drug. Despite its relatively short half-life (1-2 h), omeprazole's pharmacologic action is prolonged. Clinical trials have shown omeprazole to be at least as effective as histamine2-receptor antagonists in the treatment of gastric ulcers, duodenal ulcers, gastroesophageal reflux, and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Adverse reactions have been minimal. Omeprazole has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for short-term therapy of severe erosive esophagitis, poorly responsive symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease, and long-term management of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Penbutolol is a new beta-adrenergic blocking drug approved for the treatment of hypertension. It is a noncardioselective beta-blocker and has intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. The drug is approximately four times as potent as propranolol when taken orally. After oral administration, it is almost completely absorbed and peak plasma concentrations are achieved within 1.0 to 2.25 hours. Penbutolol is extensively metabolized in the liver by hydroxylation and glucuronidation. Active metabolites have not been identified. Only four to six percent of the parent drug is eliminated in the urine unchanged and dosage adjustment in renal insufficiency does not appear to be necessary. The mean terminal half-life of penbutolol is 17.6 to 26.5 hours. The duration of the hypotensive effect is approximately 24 hours. Current dosing guidelines recommend initiating therapy with 20 mg/d administered once a day. Optimum hypotensive effect occurs at dosages of 20-40 mg/d with little additional benefit observed above this range. Penbutolol appears to be well tolerated. The adverse effect profile is similar to other beta-blockers.\r"

  ".W": "Anticholinergic drugs have been used in Western medicine for the treatment of asthma since the early 19th century. Studies evaluating drug efficacy in acute severe asthma over the last decade have renewed interest in the optimal use of anticholinergics in this condition. Unlike other bronchodilators (i.e., beta 2-agonists and methylxanthines), the anticholinergics produce bronchodilation only by inhibiting cholinergic-mediated bronchospasm. Therefore, anticholinergic drugs are more dependent on the mechanism of bronchospasm than other bronchodilators. The 18 clinical trials of anticholinergics in acute severe asthma are critically reviewed for design and endpoint measurements. Anticholinergics alone produce a modest bronchodilation in acute severe asthma but are not as consistently effective as beta 2-agonists. Anticholinergics consistently produce an added bronchodilation to aerosolized beta 2-agonists in single- and multiple-dose studies. This bronchodilation appears to be greater in the more severely obstructed patients. This bronchodilation is generally modest (10-20 percent), has not yet been shown to produce greater overall outcome, and has not been evaluated against high-dose frequent administration of aerosolized beta 2-agonists. Currently, only the quaternary amine derivatives are recommended for use in acute asthma. These agents should be reserved as second-line agents for acute severe asthma except possibly for those patients presenting with more severe obstruction (peak expiratory flow rate less than 35 percent of predicted).\r"

  ".W": "Ivermectin is a macrocyclic lactone (fermentation) product and actinomycete (Streptomyces avermitilis) that possesses an unusually broad spectrum of potent activity against several species of nematodes, arachnids, and insects that parasitize domestic animals. From clinical trials in humans it has been found to be microfilaricidal, killing microfilariae of Onchocerca volvulus (the parasite causing onchocerciasis), and interrupting its transmission by the black fly vector. Dermal microfilariae density in patients are reduced to near zero levels for 6-12 months after a single oral dose of ivermectin 0.15-0.2 mg/kg. Its precise mechanism of action is unknown. It has a time to maximum concentration of 2.7-4.3 h, and an elimination half-life of 28 +/- 10 h. When compared with an oral solution the tablet dosage form has a relative bioavailability of approximately 60 percent. Not much is known about its metabolism in humans, and the unchanged drug is not detected in the urine. Controlled clinical trials have shown ivermectin to be associated with milder side effects than diethylcarbamazine, the current drug of choice for onchocerciasis therapy. It does not cause the severe Mazzoti-type (anaphylactoid) reactions that are associated with diethylcarbamazine use. Ivermectin is effective, safer, and more tolerable than diethylcarbamazine. It should, therefore, replace diethylcarbamazine as the drug of choice for onchocerciasis therapy.\r"

Morphologic specificity by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) revealed three antibody binding patterns corresponding to villus surface (TP-NG-43), goblet cell apical granules (TP-NG-2), and a combined surface/goblet cell apical granule antibody (TP-NG-20). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) produced three distinct electrophoretic migration patterns. These antibodies reacted with very high molecular weight determinants: TP-NG-2, one band greater than 400 kD; TP-NG-20, two bands corresponding to 370-400 kD; and TP-NG-43, two bands in the 350-400-kD range with smaller bands in the 50-94-kD range. Cross-reactivity with various other human organ systems was evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence and SDS-PAGE electrophoresis with Western blotting. By IIF, all three monoclonal antibodies reacted very strongly with components of gastric mucosa. Weak cross-reactivity was seen with colon, rectum and mucin-producing adenocarcinoma of the colon. No cross-reactivity was observed by IIF with other mucin-containing and non-mucin-containing tissues. However, cross-reactivity with gastric mucin was not detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blotting. Antibody reactivity with mucin was confirmed by purifying various regional gastrointestinal mucins and by subsequent testing by ELISA. Monoclonal antibody affinity columns were prepared and evaluated. The utility of these methods will allow for further definition of important goblet cell mucin glycoprotein characteristics and isolation of mucin subpopulations.\r"

Aldolase C was localized in epithelial cells of loops of Henle and collecting ducts and in those of Bowman's capsules. In renal cell carcinoma, aldolase C was immunohistochemically demonstrated in 95% (41 of 43) of cases, including one sarcomatoid variant. The tissue concentrations of aldolase C in the renal cortex (n = 8) were 12.7 +/- 6.2 micrograms/g protein (mean +/- standard deviation), and those of the medulla (n = 8) were 20.3 +/- 6.9 micrograms/g protein. On the other hand, the concentrations in renal cell carcinoma (n = 26) were 93.5 +/- 95.9 micrograms/g protein: about seven times higher than that in renal cortex (P less than 0.001). These findings indicate that aldolase C was first expressed in renal cell carcinoma, which is derived from proximal renal tubules, because proximal renal tubules had aldolase B but not aldolase C.\r"

  ".W": "DNA polymerase alpha is a DNA replicating enzyme expressed in all proliferating cells. This nuclear antigen in paraformaldehyde-postfixed frozen sections of normal, benign, and malignant tissues was identified by the peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique with the use of a mouse monoclonal antibody against bovine/human DNA polymerase alpha. The nuclei of normal proliferating cells were positive. Malignant tumors (n = 95) showed a higher proportion of positive nuclei than did low-grade malignant tumors (n = 7) or benign lesions (n = 67). The number of positive nuclei in squamous cell carcinomas (n = 19) was higher than in adenocarcinomas (n = 45). Eight (18%) adenocarcinomas and all five renal cell carcinomas had less than 10% positive cells, whereas in benign tissues, such as pituitary adenomas, a thymoma, reactive lymphoid lesions, and some benign mammary nodules, more than 10% of nuclei were labeled. In addition, foci of proliferating cells were clearly recognized. DNA polymerase alpha is, therefore, an excellent marker of proliferative activity that provides an approach to analyzing tumor cell heterogeneity not only in fully developed neoplasms, but also in their precursor lesions.\r"

The authors report six cases of myeloma in which most of the neoplastic cells had cleaved, multilobated, or monocytoid nuclei and presented some diagnostic difficulty. All cases were clinically aggressive (five patients with stage III disease and one patient with stage II disease). Three patients died during their initial hospitalization, and three patients are alive with progressive disease from 5 to 14 months after combination chemotherapy. Immunohistochemical studies on paraffin-embedded tissue demonstrated monotypic immunoglobulin in each case (three lambda and three kappa). Recognition of these morphologic variants of neoplastic plasma cells is important to the pathologist to avoid erroneous diagnoses and to alert the clinician to an aggressive form of myeloma associated with a poor prognosis. Immunohistochemical studies on paraffin-embedded tissue sections are useful in the diagnosis of this tumor.\r"

This quenching step is performed after the secondary (biotinylated) antibody incubation, which also allows for maximum sensitivity. Examples of results obtained with this method are illustrated, and advantages over other immunocytochemical methods are discussed.\r"

  ".U": "90224906\r", 
  ".W": "The sensitivity of the reagents for activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) test varies greatly. Consequently the physicians who prescribe heparin based on certain APTT ratios may order different doses of heparin and produce different levels of anticoagulation in their patients, depending on the sensitivity of APTT reagent used by the laboratory. The authors have been recommending that physicians in their hospital use a therapeutic range for heparinization based on the sensitivity of the APTT reagent and keep the APTT of patients within the range of APTT of pooled normal plasma containing 0.2-0.4 units of heparin per milliliter. Because the patient's response to heparin in vivo may be different from that of pooled normal plasma, the authors planned to compare the effect of these two methods of heparin monitoring on heparin usage and complications of heparin therapy. In a retrospective study, the authors reviewed the hospital records of patients treated with continuous intravenous heparin for the management of thromboembolic disorders during two periods: one period in which the laboratory used an APTT reagent with low in vitro sensitivity to heparin (LSH) and another period in which the authors used an APTT reagent with high sensitivity to heparin (HSH). The authors found that there were no significant differences between the incidence of bleeding or thrombotic complication in the two periods. Furthermore, they found that in both periods, the patients had received similar total doses of heparin during the first 72 hours of therapy. However, as was expected from in vitro sensitivity, the APTT of patients during the LSH period was significantly lower than those during the HSH period. More heparin would have been used during the LSH period compared to the HSH period of physicians were to use the APTT ratio method for monitoring the therapy. The authors conclude that using the therapeutic range for monitoring heparin therapy based on the heparin response of pooled normal plasma will result in a more comparable level of heparinization from year to year and from center to center than by using the APTT ratio method.\r"

The present case describes a 20-year-old male who had signs and symptoms consistent with AIM, which he was later proven serologically to have, but whose cervical lymph node showed features suspicious for large cell anaplastic lymphoma. In addition, the Ki-1 (CD30) antigen was expressed by some of the atypical immunoblasts, further raising this possibility.\r"

  ".W": "Since Koprowski and coworkers discovered the CA 19-9 antigen 10 yr ago, it has become the most useful blood test in the diagnosis and management of patients with cancer of the pancreas. With an upper limit of normal of 37 U/ml, the assay's overall sensitivity is approximately 80% and its specificity is 90%. If higher cutoffs are used, the specificity rises so that, at levels greater than 1000 U/ml, the marker's specificity approaches 100%. Acute cholangitis and cirrhosis are two benign conditions that might raise this assay significantly. This tumor-associated marker is also helpful in predicting unresectability of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, as 96% of tumors that result in blood levels greater than 1000 U/ml have been found to be unresectable. After potentially curative surgery, the CA 19-9 can help prognosticate survival. Patients who normalize their CA 19-9 postoperatively live longer than those who do not. Furthermore, the assay, when used serially, predicts recurrence of disease prior to radiographic or clinical findings. The CA 19-9 is currently the \"gold\" standard marker for pancreatic cancer, against which other assays in this field will be judged.\r"

  ".W": "The relative merits of various serum pancreatic enzymes, ultrasonography (US), and computerized tomography (CT) have been evaluated. In practice, the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (AP) remains hinged on the clinical picture and elevated serum amylase. The advantages of total serum amylase are its technical simplicity, ready availability, and sensitivity. Within 24 h of onset of symptoms, elevation of amylase is as sensitive as that of lipase, pancreatic isoamylase, immunoreactive trypsin, or elastase. However, after the first hospital day, it is the least sensitive of the enzymatic tests. Its greatest disadvantage is its overall low specificity. Lipase assays are now fast, reliable, practical, more specific, almost as sensitive, and not more expensive than amylase assays. The current feeling is that lipase assays should be used more often or even should replace amylase assays. However, comparative studies using objective criteria for AP are required to evaluate the utility of lipase estimations over that of amylase. Other enzymes such as P-isoamylase, immunoreactive trypsin, chymotrypsin, or elastase are more cumbersome, expensive, and not better than lipase. They should be reserved for cases of doubtful diagnoses. The levels of these pancreatic enzymes neither correlate with the severity of the disease nor can they accurately predict the subsequent clinical course of the patients. The main role of ultrasonography remains in the evaluation of the biliary tract in AP. The contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) is useful for estimating the presence and extent of pancreatic necrosis. Thereby, it enables prompt recognition of patients at high risk for systemic and local complications. Routine use of CECT may aid in the identification of pancreatitis when enzyme elevations are modest, but the utility of the procedure in all clinically mild cases is questionable. Patients who are seriously ill or who present a diagnostic problem should have a CECT. A normal CT under such circumstances excludes clinically severe AP. Serial CT should be done in patients demonstrating phlegmonous extrapancreatic spread.\r"

Overall, patients found sodium phosphate preparation much easier to complete. In 37 patients who had had a previous colonoscopy prepared with Golytely, 100% of those now receiving sodium phosphate found it easier to complete and over 90% felt it caused less discomfort, compared with their previous experience with Golytely. Colonoscopists, unaware of the type of lavage solution used, scored the degree of colonic cleansing significantly higher for sodium phosphate-prepared colons compared with colons prepared with Golytely. Serial measurements of blood tests and postural pulse and blood pressure changes did not reveal any clinically significant changes in intravascular volume. Hyperphosphatemia was noted with sodium phosphate, but was transient, and no concomitant decrease in calcium was seen. Histological assessment for possible preparation-induced changes revealed no difference between the two agents. Sodium phosphate is significantly less expensive than Golytely. We conclude that, in the group of patients studied, sodium phosphate is a safe colonic cleansing agent that is better tolerated and more effective than Golytely.\r"

Twenty-one healthy white male subjects completed the trial, and consumed an average of 3.6 cups of coffee a day. Data were evaluated by analysis of variance for repeated measures and t-test for paired means. RESULTS: No effect of coffee consumption on serum total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or apolipoprotein B was found. Diet, creamer use, and cigarette use as well as group assignment and time factors were controlled for in the analysis. CONCLUSION: We found no effect of moderate consumption of filter-brewed coffee on serum levels of atherogenic lipids. This study supports previous work that filtered coffee has no adverse effect on serum lipids. This has far-reaching implications given the widespread use of coffee and the current concern over coronary risk factors.\r"

However, the cause of the clinical deterioration is often uncertain, and disease progression is difficult to distinguish from disease-associated complications or adverse effects of therapy. In studies of the clinical course of IPF, mortality is most frequently due to respiratory failure (38.7%); other causes of death include heart failure (14.4%), bronchogenic carcinoma (10.4%), ischemic heart disease (9.5%), infection (6.5%), and pulmonary embolism (3.4%). Other, usually nonfatal, disease-associated complications include pneumothorax, corticosteroid-induced metabolic side effects and myopathy, and therapy-related immunosuppression. In evaluating clinical deterioration in patients with IPF, disease-associated complications and adverse effects of therapy should be distinguished from progressive pulmonary fibrosis. The cause of clinical deterioration will alter the therapeutic intervention required and will influence patient prognosis and duration of survival. This article examines the causes of clinical deterioration in patients with IPF and the diagnostic procedures for assessing disease-associated complications and staging IPF progression.\r"

  ".W": "The third-generation cephalosporins are useful for empiric therapy of most of the severe infections in adults as a result of their broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity (particularly against clinically important gram-negative bacteria), good tissue penetration, and lack of serious adverse effects. This review examines their use in respiratory tract infections, bacterial meningitis, skin-structure infections, and urinary tract infections in adult patients. Penicillin G remains the optimal therapy for severe community-acquired pneumonia, since Streptococcus pneumoniae still accounts for the majority of cases. However, for empiric treatment of nosocomial pneumonia, therapy must ensure coverage both of aerobic gram-negative bacilli and Staphylococcus aureus. The choice of empiric antibiotic therapy in the treatment of urinary tract infections depends on the pattern of resistance in the patient's environment. At present, the treatment of bacterial meningitis in otherwise healthy adults does not constitute a major problem provided that penicillin resistance among pneumococci and meningococci (responsible for at least 80 percent of cases) does not become a clinical problem. However, in meningitis in which gram-negative bacilli are suspected and where specific problems include antibiotic resistance among these organisms and the inadequate penetration of many antibiotics into the cerebrospinal fluid, third-generation cephalosporins are the drugs of choice, and they have markedly improved the clinical outcome. Most skin-structure infections are due to S. aureus and are best treated by an anti-staphylococcal penicillin or an older cephalosporin. Nevertheless, the third-generation cephalosporins have proved to be highly effective agents for infections of skin and soft-tissue infections associated with both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens in patients at risk from these organisms or in the elderly.\r"

  ".W": "Third-generation cephalosporins are important additions to the range of antibiotics available for treating children with serious bacterial infections. They are highly active against the common pathogens, which cause bacterial meningitis in children. Strains of Haemophilus influenzae type b resistant to both ampicillin and chloramphenicol, and Streptococcus pneumoniae relatively resistant to penicillin remain susceptible to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter diversus, as well as the other more common gram-negative bacilli isolated from neonates and children are susceptible to these agents. However, Listeria monocytogenes is not cephalosporin-sensitive. Ceftazidime is the only third-generation cephalosporin useful for treating serious infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in children. As with other beta-lactam antibiotics, the clearance of cephalosporins is prolonged in neonates, particularly premature babies. Cefotaxime and ceftriaxone are equivalent to ampicillin and chloramphenicol for the treatment of bacterial meningitis in children over two to three months of age with respect to neurologic outcome and safety, despite the in vitro activity of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone being much greater than the standard antibiotics for the meningeal pathogens. Cefotaxime and ceftriaxone are effective in the treatment of serious gram-negative infections in children. In many instances, ceftriaxone can be administered once daily, which allows for more convenient therapy, particularly on an outpatient basis. Although controversial, ceftazidime has been used as single-agent therapy for empiric treatment of neutropenic immunocompromised children with fever.\r"

Rare infections are defined as those caused by unusual pathogens or multi-resistant organisms as well as those occurring in unusual or pharmacologically protected body sites. Examples of such infections are uncommon causes of meningitis and ventriculitis, brain abscess, rare causes of bacterial endocarditis, metastatic Salmonella infections, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and liver abscess, late complications of Lyme borreliosis, uncommon Pseudomonas infections, and post-reconstructive surgery Aeromonas cellulitis. Although these data are largely anecdotal, they form a useful body of information, providing guidance on the management of similar problems encountered by other doctors, while suggesting areas of further investigation for the management of a variety of unusual infections with the third-generation cephalosporins.\r"

  ".U": "90225023\r", 
  ".W": "After 10 years of use, the third-generation cephalosporins remain excellent antibiotics. They have superior activity against selected streptococcal species compared with other cephalosporins, and superior activity against Haemophilus, Neisseria, Branhamella, and other less common oral gram-negative aerobic species. Despite a very broad spectrum of activity, the third-generation cephalosporins, like all other cephalosporins, have only poor activity against enterococci, Listeria, Corynebacterium jekeium, and methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Over the past 10 years, the activity of the third-generation cephalosporins against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Proteus, Providencia, Serratia, Haemophilus, and Neisseria has remained excellent. Equally as important, though perhaps less well recognized, is the activity of some of these agents against mouth anaerobic species and the anaerobic Bacteroides and Clostridium spp. of the pelvic area. At present, there are two main threats to the continued use of the third-generation cephalosporins. These are the increasing number of infections due to Enterobacter spp., which constitutively produce large amounts of a beta-lactamase that hydrolyzes cephalosporins, and the recent appearance of Klebsiella spp. in many parts of the world that possess new plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases that destroy cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and related third-generation parenteral cephalosporins. Correlation of pharmacologic properties with in vitro activity provides information as to reasonable dosage regimens for the third-generation cephalosporins. For most serious infections cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, and ceftazidime should be given three times a day provided that the patient has relatively normal renal function. Ceftriaxone can be administered once daily in less severe infections. The use of lower doses or less frequent dosing with cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, or ceftazidime is recommended in aged patients whose renal function is impaired. The unique interaction of cefotaxime with its active metabolite, desacetylcefotaxime, allows cefotaxime to be administered less frequently than three times a day in selected anaerobic infections. Correlation of the antibacterial activity and pharmacology of cephalosporins will help us to tailor their use more appropriately, so that the third-generation cephalosporins will remain useful antimicrobial agents for a further decade.\r"

  ".W": "Cefotaxime, a third-generation cephalosporin, is active against many troublesome gram-negative organisms and anaerobes that now more frequently cause nosocomial infection. Single-dose cefotaxime, 1 g or 2 g administered 30 minutes prior to surgery, has been proven to be effective as prophylaxis for infection following gastrointestinal, biliary, obstetric, gynecologic, and genito-urinary procedures. When published trials are compiled, single-dose cefotaxime is more effective than multiple-dose cefazolin (p less than 0.01) in these types of surgery. Unfortunately, the dramatic increase in cephalosporin use has been accompanied by the emergence of resistant organisms such as enterococci and fungi. In Europe, some centers successfully prevent nosocomial pneumonia in intubated patients by decontaminating gastric contents with a combination of nonabsorbable antimicrobial agents including cefotaxime. Further trials may validate this concept for use in the United States.\r"

  ".W": "Knowledge of side effects associated with different cephalosporins may be of help to prescribers. There are several side effects that are common to all cephalosporins, but overall, cefotaxime and ceftizoxime cause the fewest adverse reactions. Bleeding is probably the most common serious side effect of cephalosporins. Moxalactam causes coagulopathy and bleeding more often than do other cephalosporins, probably because it is carboxylated and has a methylthiotetrazole side chain. Cefoperazone also has a methylthiotetrazole side chain and may cause bleeding, particularly when used in doses greater than 4 g per day. Ceftriaxone has a similar side chain and there is some evidence that it can induce a coagulopathy. Coagulation tests should be monitored when any of the third-generation cephalosporins are given to patients with a high risk of bleeding. Disulfiram-like reactions are also related to the side chains associated with coagulation defects and have been reported when patients receiving cefoperazone, moxalactam, or ceftriaxone have ingested alcohol. Seizures have been reported with ceftazidime, but are uncommon. Hematologic reactions are rare with all third-generation cephalosporins. Benign diarrhea and Clostridium difficile colitis probably occur most often with moxalactam, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone, but there are few good data on this issue. Ceftriaxone has the unique ability to cause sludge (also referred to as pseudolithiasis) to form in the gallbladder, particularly in children. This may be associated with nausea, anorexia, epigastric distress, and colic, and is usually detected using ultrasonography. The sludge dissolves and symptoms subside after therapy is discontinued. None of the third-generation cephalosporins is clearly significantly nephrotoxic, even when combined with aminoglycosides. Most of the third-generation cephalosporins have surprisingly few serious side effects, which make them attractive for use in the treatment of a wide variety of serious infections.\r"

Insulin sensitivity in normal pregnant women (n = 8) was reduced to only one third that of a group of nonpregnant women (n = 7) of similar age and relative weight. This marked insulin resistance was compensated by reciprocal enhancement of the first and second-phase insulin responses to intravenous glucose, which were increased threefold as compared with the nonpregnant women. Women with gestational diabetes mellitus (n = 16) had mean insulin sensitivity that was similar to that of the normal pregnant group, which indicates that insulin action was appropriate for the late phase of pregnancy in the gestational diabetic group. By contrast, the mean first-phase insulin response was significantly reduced in women with gestational diabetes mellitus, as compared with that of normal pregnant women (p less than 0.001). However, approximately one fifth of the group with gestational diabetes mellitus had first-phase responses that did not fall below the 95% confidence interval for the mean in normal pregnant women. The mean second-phase response was also lower in the group with gestational diabetes, although the difference was of borderline statistical significance (p less than 0.09). Our findings reveal the quantitative nature of the reciprocal changes in insulin sensitivity and B-cell function that normally accompany late pregnancy. They further indicate that during the third trimester, mild gestational diabetes is characterized by an impairment of pancreatic B-cell function rather than an exaggeration of the normal insulin resistance of late pregnancy.\r"

All patients had at least one ultrasonographic examination (86% before 20 weeks' gestation). Two pregnancies were discordant for open fetal defects (one anencephaly, one gastroschisis). The median serum alpha-fetoprotein value in the remaining 136 twin pregnancies paralleled a curve 2.5 times the median curve for singleton pregnancies over the gestational range studied. Higher serum alpha-fetoprotein values correlated significantly with increasing incidence of fetal and neonatal death, premature delivery (less than 35 weeks' gestation), and twin-to-twin birth discordance (greater than 20%), most pronounced at greater than 4 multiples of the singleton median level. A significant negative correlation between alpha-fetoprotein and birth weight was observed (p less than 0.001), but was related more to prematurity than to poor fetal growth. Theoretically, serum alpha-fetoprotein screening detected 56.5% of the twins in this study when a cutoff level of 2.5 multiples of the median was used, enhancing twin detection in the study population by 40%. These data indicate that maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening has a valuable role in the management of twin pregnancy, both in the detection of twins and in the prediction of perinatal outcome in twin pregnancy.\r"

All three parameters showed rapid increases during treatment that depended on ritodrine doses and paralleled changes in maternal pulse rate. The slope of the correlation between plasma renin activity and active renin concentrations suggested an increase in both active renin and renin substrate during ritodrine treatment. In contrast, levels of inactive renin remained unchanged for several hours during ritodrine infusion, showing only a late and much smaller response than that of either total or active renin concentrations. Thus ritodrine treatment results in further activation of an already activated renin-angiotensin system in pregnancy. This activation relates to an increase in both renin enzyme and its substrate. It may be responsible for the disturbance in water balance and the risk of pulmonary edema associated with beta-sympathomimetic drug treatment in preterm labor.\r"

In this study we provide evidence for oncogenic transformation of primary baby rat kidney cells by human papillomavirus type 16 deoxyribonucleic acid plus ras oncogene in the presence of progesterone but not estrogen. Integrated and intact human papillomavirus type 16 deoxyribonucleic acid is present and expressed in all the five progesterone-transformed colonies that we examined. Moreover, all these cell lines are capable of anchorage-independent growth and induce tumors in syngeneic animals. We also observed oncogenic transformation with human papillomavirus type 16 deoxyribonucleic acid plus ras in the presence of ethanol-soluble extracts from two brands of commonly used oral contraceptive tablets. No transformation is achieved in the presence of ethanol-soluble extracts from the inert tablets, provided in packages of each brand of oral contraceptive.

We found that the action of endothelin is not restricted to the vasculature; we demonstrated that endothelin causes an increase in the concentration of intracellular Ca++ and phosphorylation of the 20 kd light chain of myosin in human uterine smooth muscle cells in culture. In the absence of Ca++ in the buffer medium of myometrial cells, the effects of endothelin on intracellular Ca++ and myosin light chain phosphorylation are attenuated but not abolished. Endothelin also increases the frequency of contraction of human uterine smooth muscle (longitudinal and circular). The contractile effects of endothelin on myometrial strips are diminished in the presence of nifedipine. We conclude that (1) human myometrium is responsive to endothelin, (2) endothelin promotes contraction in myometrium by effecting an increase in intracellular Ca++ and thus an increase in myosin light chain phosphorylation, and (3) endothelin acts in myometrium by stimulating Ca++ influx as well as Ca++ release from intracellular stores.\r"

Herein we report on the potential ovarian relevance of one such macrophage product, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, a polypeptide capable of oncolytic as well as pleiotropic noncytotoxic biologic activities. Our findings suggest that the ability of TNF alpha to diminish the gonadotropin-supported accumulation of progesterone by granulosa/luteal cells is largely due to attenuation of key biosynthetic steps leading to progesterone production. These findings are in keeping with the notion that TNF alpha, possibly of intraovarian (e.g., macrophage or granulosa cell) origin, may comprise the centerpiece of a regulatory loop designed to attenuate gonadotropin hormonal action. Acting at or adjacent to its site of synthesis, TNF alpha may thus partake in the modulation of ovarian progestin economy, possibly in connection with the death of the corpus luteum.\r"

Patients treated with medications had significantly lower (p less than 0.0001) systolic and diastolic blood pressures throughout gestation compared with the no-medication group. Among the control group there was a spontaneously significant lowering (p less than 0.0001) of both systolic and diastolic blood pressures at 14 to 26 weeks' gestation. However, there were no differences among the three groups regarding the incidences of either superimposed preeclampsia (15.6%, 18.4%, and 16.3%, respectively), abruptio placentae (2.2%, 1.1%, and 2.3%, respectively), or preterm delivery (10%, 12.5%, and 11.6%, respectively). In addition, there were no differences among the groups regarding gestational age at delivery, birth weight, incidence of fetal growth retardation, or neonatal head circumference. There was one midtrimester loss in the methyldopa group and one stillbirth in each of the other groups. We conclude that treatment of maternal blood pressure in mild chronic hypertension during pregnancy did not improve perinatal outcome.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred twenty preterm newborns less than 34 weeks' gestational age have been studied prospectively to determine the frequency of fetal and newborn metabolic acidosis and to examine the relationship of metabolic acidosis to periventricular leukomalacia as demonstrated by serial newborn ultrasonographic examinations. Fetal metabolic acidosis, based on an umbilical artery buffer base less than 34 mmol/L at delivery, occurred in three cases (2%), one of which had evidence of periventricular leukomalacia. Newborn metabolic acidosis that is based on a buffer base less than 34 mmol/L during the 4 days after delivery occurred in 12 cases (10%), five of which had evidence of periventricular leukomalacia. There is a significant relationship between the degree and duration of newborn metabolic acidosis and the occurrence of periventricular leukomalacia. This study indicates that systemic metabolic acidosis is an important pathophysiologic marker of periventricular leukomalacia. Intrapartum fetal asphyxia with metabolic acidosis, although an infrequent occurrence in the preterm newborn, may account for a few cases of periventricular leukomalacia, while the more common newborn metabolic acidosis, when of sufficient degree and duration, carries a high risk of periventricular leukomalacia.\r"

Formal teaching of the technique is imperative. This should be done by means of incorporating ultrasonography, in general, and transvaginal sonography, in particular, in formal residency training. The reasons for incorporating transvaginal sonographic examination in the standard pelvic examination done in the office or the emergency room are discussed.\r"

  ".U": "90225078\r", 
  ".W": "The authors studied the secretion of interleukin-2 (IL-2), the expression of interleukin-2 receptors (IL-2R; p55/Tac and p75), and the response to exogenous IL-2 by cultured Hodgkin's Reed-Sternberg cells (cell lines HDLM-1, HDLM-1d, and KM-H2) and T cells (H9, HuT78, HuT102, MOLT-4, and MT-2). All of these cells did not produce IL-2 or produced it in undetectable amounts, and their growth was not affected by the addition of anti-IL-2 or anti-IL-2R antibodies. This indicates that H-RS cells in long-term culture, as well as T cells, can grow independently of IL-2. The three H-RS cell lines, as well as two of the T-cell lines (HuT102 and MT-2), expressed Tac, whereas the other three T-cell lines were Tac negative. Expression of p75 was noted in the two Tac-positive T-cell lines, but not in cultured H-RS cells. The expression of Tac and p75 in HuT102 and MT-2 cells correlated well with their capacity to proliferate on treatment with exogenous IL-2. On IL-2 treatment, nucleic-acid uptake in Tac/p75-positive T cells increased approximately four- to sixfold, whereas the Tac/p75-negative T cells did not show increased proliferation. Unlike the T cells, the Tac-positive H-RS cells did not respond to IL-2. The lack of a proliferative response to IL-2 appears to be related to the absence of p75 in H-RS cells. A similar pattern (Tac positivity and p75 negativity) was noted in H-RS cells in lymph nodes involved by Hodgkin's disease. Thus the exogenous IL-2 released by surrounding T lymphocytes may not cause the proliferative activity of H-RS cells because of the lack of high-affinity IL-2 receptors in the latter cells. In contrast to H-RS cells in culture, H-RS cells in tissues were stained by a specific anti-IL-2 monoclonal antibody. This indicates that the expression of IL-2 or an IL-2-like substance by H-RS cells in tissues may be responsible, in part, for the great increase in the number of reactive T lymphocytes in tissues involved by Hodgkin's disease.\r"

  ".W": "The neural-derived retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) underlies the sensory retina and is central to both retinal homeostasis and many common retinal diseases. Retinal pigment epithelium cells are actively phagocytic and share several features with macrophages that have recently been shown to produce a neutrophil chemotactic factor (NCF), also known as interleukin-8, after cytokine stimulation. Because RPE cell responses to cytokines are largely unknown, human RPE cell NCF production was monitored after interleukin-1-beta (IL-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, or lipopolysaccharide stimulation. RPE NCF mRNA expression and RPE production of biologically active NCF was time and concentration dependent. Maximal NCF mRNA expression occurred at 20 ng/ml for IL-1 beta. Messenger RNA expression in RPE cells and biologically active NCF in RPE cell supernatants were found 1 hour after stimulation and were maintained for 24 hours. These findings demonstrate that cytokine-stimulated RPE cells may evoke or augment neutrophil-mediated inflammation by synthesizing NCF, a cytokine that may be important in ocular disease mechanisms.\r"

Fourteen lymphomas from AIDS patients and four children with disorders of the immune system were available. For control reasons, six cases of infectious mononucleosis (IM) and eight Burkitt's lymphomas (BL) from malaria-free regions of Africa were included in the study. Two different patterns of EBV distribution are described: 1) heterogeneous scattered EBV-positive cells, as originally seen in IM and therefore called the IM-type pattern, 2) and a BL-type pattern seen in endemic Burkitt's lymphoma with homogeneous EBV-positive cells all over the tumor. In lymphomas in patients with inborn immunodeficiencies, an IM-type pattern was found. In lymphomas from AIDS patients, the two different patterns were found. There were lymphomas with the IM-type pattern as well as some with the BL-type pattern. In some AIDS-associated lymphomas, both patterns occurred in one tumor. The findings suggest that it is not the disease process that is the distinguishing feature between the two patterns of EBV infection but rather the patient's underlying disease and the extent of this disease.\r"

  ".W": "Intermediate filament proteins and actin isoforms of a series of 12 malignant hemangiopericytomas and five glomus tumors were examined by light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-GE), and by immunohistochemistry, the latter using monoclonal or affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies to desmin, vimentin, cytokeratins, alpha-smooth muscle, and alpha-sarcomeric actins. By light microscopy, all hemangiopericytomas disclosed a predominant vascular pattern with scant storiform, myxoid and spindle cell areas, and with variable degrees of perivascular fibrosis. By ultrastructure, smooth muscle differentiation was observed in each hemangiopericytoma. Immunohistochemically, neoplastic cells of hemangiopericytomas expressed vimentin as the sole intermediate filament protein and lacked alpha-smooth muscle or alpha-sarcomeric actins. 2D-GE revealed only beta and gamma actins, in proportions typical for fibroblastic tissues. Glomus tumors revealed vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin within glomus cells by immunohistochemical techniques and disclosed ultrastructurally distinct smooth muscle differentiation. Therefore hemangiopericytomas represent a distinct soft-tissue neoplasm with uniform morphologic, immunohistochemical, and biochemical features most likely related to glomus tumors, the former representing an aggressive and potentially malignant neoplasm of vascular smooth muscle cells and the latter a well-differentiated neoplasm of vascular smooth muscle cells. Because malignant hemangiopericytomas disclose smooth muscle differentiation by ultrastructure, but do not express alpha-smooth muscle actin, as normal pericytes and glomus cells, it is suggested that these neoplasms represent highly vascularized smooth muscle neoplasms, ie, poorly differentiated leiomyosarcomas derived from vascular smooth muscle cells or their equivalent, the pericytes, which have lost alpha-smooth muscle actin as a differentiation marker that is similar to many conventional poorly differentiated leiomyosarcomas.\r"

To further characterize these two antigens, the authors used immunohistochemical methods to determine their expression in normal human tissues, astrocytomas, and over 100 tumors of other histologic types. They found that A4 is expressed 1) throughout the central (CNS), but not peripheral nervous system (PNS); 2) in smooth muscle and a small number of epithelial tissues; and 3) in reactive glia and in astrocytomas, but not in most tumors of other histologic types. In contrast, the AO10 antigen is expressed 1) in a small subset of CNS neurons, but not in astrocytes, PNS neurons, or other normal tissues; 2) in astrocytomas and reactive glia; and 3) in some additional neuroectodermal tumors, but not melanomas, carcinomas, or sarcomas. These findings show that A4 and AO10 are restricted markers for human astrocytomas in vivo. Furthermore, the antigens show distinct patterns of expression in normal human CNS but appear to be coordinately expressed in astrocytomas and astrocytoma-derived cell lines.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the effects of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (rhTNF alpha) on polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), concentrating on the mechanisms involved in the alterations of PMN-directed migration and adherence by this cytokine. RhTNF alpha profoundly suppressed PMN chemotaxis toward FMLP by 80%. At similar concentrations, it enhanced adhesion to gelatin-coated plastic dishes by more than tenfold and increased the expression of the CD11b antigen to 182% of the control. The monoclonal antibody 60.1, which is directed against the alpha chain of the CD11b/CD18 complex, completely blocked rhTNF alpha, induced inhibition of the chemotactic response to FMLP, and rhTNF alpha induced hyperadherence, suggesting that these effects were related to rhTNF alpha's effects on CD11b antigen expression. The fluid state of the PMN membrane was also decreased by rhTNF alpha. N-butanol, a known membrane fluidizer, partially inhibited the effect of rhTNF alpha on membrane fluidity and chemotaxis and completely reversed its effects on adherence and the expression of the CD11b antigen. Pentoxifylline, an agent that has previously been studied for its ability to prevent some effects of rhTNF alpha on PMNs, completely prevented the effect of rhTNF alpha on chemotaxis, the expression of the CD11b antigen, and membrane fluidity. Pentoxifylline partially prevented changes in adherence caused by this cytokine. Increased CD11b antigen expression caused by rhTNF alpha may result in enhanced PMN adhesion and suppression of migration. These events may, in turn, lead to the accumulation of PMNs on the vascular endothelium, resulting in the extensive vascular and tissue damage that is seen in gram-negative sepsis.\r"

Ultrastructurally, these cells accumulated, at their perikarya and neuritic extensions, spatially discrete arrays of fibrils, which occasionally occurred in twisted pairs. When these fibrillar structures appeared as paired helices, they exhibited dimensions and configurations reminiscent of PHF found in affected Alzheimer neurons, although less compact. Immunoelectron microscope examinations of the fibrillar structures in these neuroblastoma cells with one of these anti-PHF immunoprobes revealed that only subsets of fibrillar structures that appeared thickened or aggregated to form bundles were selectively immunolabeled. Cultures of these immortal neuroblastoma lines may provide a convenient model for studying aspects of PHF formation that are hard to examine in Alzheimer brain obtained at autopsy.\r"

The type of PHT was determined on clinicopathologic grounds (in 17 cases by catheterism); 20 patients had precapillary and 17 postcapillary PHT. In normal lungs, myofibroblasts, ie, contractile interstitial cells (CIC), distributed in alveolar septa, were not stained by alpha-SM actin antibodies. Only around the venules, were cells labeled by this antibody present. Furthermore, there were bundles of alpha-SM actin-positive cells around the openings of air sacculi into the alveolar ducts. In precapillary PHT, the distribution and immunostaining properties of interstitial cells remained unchanged; alpha-SM actin-positive cells were observed in thickened arterial intima and in plexiform lesions. In postcapillary PHT secondary to heart failure, to mitral stenosis, or in veno-occlusive disease, many interstitial cells in the alveolar septa were decorated by alpha-SM actin antibodies but not with desmin. The authors propose that, in postcapillary PHT, mechanical stretch due to capillary congestion may be responsible for the generation of cells that express an actin isoform associated with smooth muscle.\r"

Some of the GECs were stained with both monoclonal and polyclonal anti-desmin antibodies. The frequency of desmin-positive cells among GECs varied between glomeruli in each of the strains and also differed between the four strains. Most GECs in WKA rats contained desmin, whereas few did so in SHR rats. Lewis and Fischer 344 rats showed amounts of GEC desmin staining intermediate between those of SHR and WKA rats. In every strain, desmin-specific immunofluorescence in GECs increased with aging. In aminonucleoside nephrosis, GECs showed extremely enhanced desmin staining in parallel with urinary protein excretion. This heterogeneous distribution and changes observed for desmin were not shown for vimentin. On the basis of the above findings, the correlation between the presence of desmin in GECs and glomerular epithelial damage is discussed.\r"

The immunohistologic analyses show significant phenotypic differences between prostatic basal cells and myoepithelial cells of the salivary gland. Although both cell types stain intensely with the 312C8-1 monoclonal antibody, only true myoepithelial cells demonstrated significant amounts of muscle-specific actin as decorated by the HHF35 monoclonal antibody. Furthermore, using double-labeling experiments, the prostatic basal cells were strongly decorated with a fluorescein-tagged basal cell-specific keratin but were negative with the rhodamine-tagged phalloidin, a chemical that binds specifically to actin microfilaments. Ultrastructural studies also showed an absence of thin microfilament bundles, dense bodies, and micropinocytotic vesicles in the prostatic basal cells. The current investigations show that the prostatic acini do not have a basal myoepithelium. Although some authors have suggested a stem cell role for prostatic basal cells, the weight of experimental work argues against this hypothesis. The exact role of the basal epithelial cells of the prostate is not known, although they may serve endocrine, paracrine, or other regulatory functions and may be involved in modulating signals between prostatic stroma and epithelium.\r"

If the model is validated, this family of disorders, which the authors term \"affective spectrum disorder,\" would represent one of the most prevalent diseases in the population.\r"

There were no differences between the two techniques in therapeutic outcome or cognitive side effects from ECT, and caffeine pretreatment was well tolerated.

  ".W": "The precise mechanism by which glucocorticoids inhibit airway mucus secretion is still unknown. To study directly the effect of glucocorticoid on submucosal gland secretion, we examined the effects of dexamethasone on the precursor uptake, biosynthesis, and release of mucus glycoprotein in isolated feline tracheal submucosal glands. Mucus glycoprotein release from isolated glands was estimated by measuring [3H]glucosamine-labeled trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-precipitable glycoconjugates secreted into the medium. Released glycoconjugate per hour per dry weight of gland tissue was less than 7% of the total intracellular content, where intracellular content is defined as total 3H activity in the dissolved gland tissue. Treatment with 10(-9) to 10(-5) M dexamethasone for 24 to 72 h significantly reduced basal glycoconjugate secretion up to 22% of control (a 78% decrease) in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas the total intracellular 3H content was reduced to 70% of control (a 30% decrease) with no statistically significant differences from controls. The ratio of released glycoconjugates to the total intracellular content decreased significantly to 31% of control (a 69% decrease) after the treatment with 10(-10) to 10(-5) M dexamethasone. Further, ratio of radioactivity of TCA-precipitable glycoconjugates in the dissolved gland tissue to the total intracellular 3H content increased from 40% in nontreated controls to 46% after the treatment with dexamethasone (10(-5) M). Dexamethasone also inhibited the glycoconjugate secretion stimulated by dibutyryl cyclic AMP and alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists. Simultaneously, the ratio of released to total intracellular content also decreased significantly after dexamethasone treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Selected patients were randomly assigned to doses of 150, 300, or 450 mg rifabutin. Choice of companion drugs was left to the treating physicians. In the analysis of data from this program, we examined the relationship between response to treatment, as measured by bacteriologic sputum conversion, survival, weight gain, improvement in respiratory symptoms, and subjective assessment of clinical improvement, and a variety of patient and treatment variables. Although in some of the analyses a higher rifabutin dose appeared to be associated with sputum conversion, survival, and clinical improvement, the drug did not have a marked effect on outcome. The role of rifabutin in the treatment of this disease will best be assessed in a controlled clinical trial.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-four patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome received long-term treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The effects on daytime lung function and pulmonary hemodynamics were prospectively evaluated by repeating pulmonary function tests, including right heart catheterization after a follow-up period of at least 1 yr (554 +/- 28 days, mean +/- SEM). PaO2 increased in the patient group as a whole from 69.9 +/- 1.4 to 72.8 +/- 1.4 mm Hg (p less than 0.02). The increase in PaO2 was greater (from 60.4 +/- 1.0 to 66.4 +/- 2.1, p less than 0.01) in those patients who were hypoxemic prior to treatment. PaCO2 decreased significantly only in the subgroup of patients with significant hypercapnia prior to treatment (n = 7), from 48.5 +/- 1.3 to 44.5 +/- 1.5 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). The improvement in daytime blood gases seemed to be related to an increase in the alveolar ventilation, from 5.2 +/- 0.2 to 5.9 +/- 0.3 L/min without a change in the alveolar-arterial PO2 difference, as calculated in 25 patients. Both the red blood cell count and the hematocrit decreased significantly, from 5,347 +/- 90 to 5,024 +/- 61 10(3)/mm3 and from 49.4 +/- 0.9 to 47.1 +/- 0.6%, p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.02, respectively. No change was observed in the resting pulmonary arterial pressure. We conclude that nasal CPAP is effective in improving daytime blood gases in patients with OSA.\r"

The current study was done to determine if this effect was reversed in high pressure pulmonary edema. Seven supine, anesthetized dogs were fluid-loaded and treated with disopyramide (3.5 to 7.0 mg/kg) and propranolol (0.25 to 1.5 mg/kg). This produced a mean pulmonary wedge pressure (Ppaw) of 21.0 mm Hg on intermittent positive-pressure ventilation (IPPV). CPPV and CNPV were then alternated at 30-min intervals. Ventilators were matched for oxygen concentration, frequency, tidal volume (VT), and the increment in FRC (delta FRC) produced by a given positive (PEEP) or negative (NEEP) end-expiratory pressure. During 20 cm H2O of PEEP, QT values were significantly depressed from IPPV control values (2.13 +/- 0.2 versus 1.27 +/- 0.2 L/min, p less than 0.05) but not during CNPV with equivalent NEEP (1.66 +/- 0.2 L/min). Although arterial oxygen saturations were similar, mixed venous oxygen saturations were depressed by CPPV with PEEP of 15 and 20 cm H2O (67.9 +/- 3.8% during IPPV versus 54.1 +/- 4.9 and 51.9 +/- 5.8%, respectively, p less than 0.05 in both instances) but not during equivalent CNPV (59.9 +/- 4.3 and 58.7 +/- 4.5%). Despite potentially increased left ventricular afterload, external negative chest wall ventilation with NEEP does not appear to significantly depress QT compared with CPPV even when Ppaw is high and myocardial contractility is impaired.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the effects of three forms of vascular obstruction: positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), ensnarement of the left main pulmonary artery (SN), and pulmonary thromboembolism (EMB) on right ventricular afterload. We measured right ventricular and pulmonary arterial pressures and flow in open-chested dogs under anesthesia (n = 8). Pulmonary artery input impedance (Zin) was calculated by Fourier analysis of the pressure and flow waves. Characteristic impedance (Zc) and pulmonary arterial compliance (Ca) were estimated from Zin with a lumped parameter model. Although PEEP, SN, and EMB all increased mean pulmonary arterial pressure, PEEP, had negligible effect on Zc and Ca, whereas SN increased Zc but decreased Ca (+24% and -49%, respectively), and EMB decreased both Zc and Ca (-33% and -39%, respectively). These changes of Zc affect wave reflection and alter the energy transmission ratio, which is the ratio of hydraulic power output in the measured and forward waves (Wm/Wf). Under control conditions, Wm/Wf was 62% and was not affected significantly by SN (59%) or by PEEP (46%), but it fell significantly to 30% after EMB. Simulation of these experiments in a mathematical model suggested that the increase of Zc with SN was due to an active neurohumoral effect; all other responses were consistent with passive mechanical effects. In additional experiments, we tested the effects of meclofenamate (n = 6) and ketanserin (n = 6) and of atropine and vagotomy (n = 5) on the response to SN and EMB. The serotonin antagonist, ketanserin, blunted the increase of Zc to SN, but none of the interventions significantly affected the response of Zc or Ca to EMB.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

PAF has been reported to produce bronchoconstriction and a sustained increase in airway reactivity when inhaled by normal subjects. Leukotrienes produce bronchoconstriction in both normal and asthmatic subjects, but whether they increase airway reactivity is unclear. Before initiating studies to determine how these bioactive mediators influence airway function, we sought to confirm that PAF increases airway reactivity and identify whether one of the sulfidopeptide leukotrienes, LTD4, has a similar effect. Eight normal male subjects inhaled saline and increasing concentrations of either histamine (0.1 to 50 mg/ml), PAF (1 to 1,000 micrograms/ml), or LTD4 (1 to 500 micrograms/ml) on separate days, at least 1 wk apart, until specific airway conductance (SGaw) decreased 50% or the maximal concentration was reached. After inhaling the test substance, methacholine (MCh) challenges were performed at 6 h, at 1, 3, and 7 days, and weekly thereafter until airway reactivity (measured as the MCh concentration that decreased SGaw 35% [PC35SGaw]) normalized. The four postsaline MCh challenges (6 h to 7 days) were used to determine the 95% confidence interval for PC35SGaw (in each subject) and identify significant changes in airway reactivity after inhaling each test substance. Airway reactivity did not change after inhaling histamine. After inhaling PAF, six of eight subjects developed increased airway reactivity, which was maximal at 1 day and persisted for 14 days in three. After inhaling LTD4, six of eight subjects also developed increased airway reactivity, which was maximal at 7 days and persisted for 14 days in two.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

DESIGN: Prospectively randomized, triple-crossover study with at least 1-month washout between each of three treatment periods. SETTING: Inpatient and outpatient clinical research center of a university teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Convenience sample of 12 women with serum creatinine levels between 130 and 270 mumols/L (1.5 and 3.0 mg/dL). Mean glomerular filtration rate +/- standard error was 0.36 +/- 0.03 mL/s.m2 (37 +/- 3 mL/min.1.73 m2); mean effective renal plasma flow was 1.6 +/- 0.18 mL/s.m2 (166 +/- 19 mL/min.1.73 m2). INTERVENTIONS: Patients received ibuprofen, 800 mg three times daily; piroxicam, 20 mg daily; and sulindac, 200 mg twice daily for 11 days. Treatment was discontinued if serum creatinine rose by 130 mumols/L (1.5 mg/dL) or serum potassium exceeded 6 mmol/L (6 mEq/L). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Three patients met our criteria for stopping ibuprofen by day 8; however, all patients completed piroxicam and sulindac therapy. When the three patients in whom ibuprofen was withdrawn were rechallenged with ibuprofen, 400 mg three times daily, two again developed evidence of acute renal deterioration. All three regimens suppressed renal prostaglandin production. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that a brief course of ibuprofen, a compound widely used on a nonprescription basis, may result in acute renal failure in patients with asymptomatic, mild chronic renal failure. Additional studies are needed to assess the risk of piroxicam and sulindac in patients with more pronounced renal impairment and in patients receiving longer courses of therapy, which, according to our data, may result in drug accumulation.\r"

SETTING: A referral-based bone marrow transplant center. PATIENTS: Consecutive series of 59 patients with myelodysplasia or closely related disorders and either life-threatening cytopenia or a progressive increase in marrow blast percentage. INTERVENTION: Patients were treated with high-dose cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation followed by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from either an HLA-identical (n = 45) or HLA-partially matched (n = 14) donor. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The product-limit estimate for disease-free survival 3 years after transplant is 45% (95% CI, 32% to 59%). The commonest causes of death after transplant were disease recurrence, interstitial pneumonia, and graft-versus-host disease, accounting for eight deaths each. In a univariate analysis, younger patients, those with shorter disease duration, and those whose disease was characterized by an abnormal cytogenetic karyotype had better survival and disease-free survival than the group as a whole. In a multivariate analysis, younger age and abnormal karyotype were independent predictors of improved disease-free survival and overall survival. Patients who received transplants when they had fewer blasts in their bone marrow had a decreased chance for disease recurrence when compared with patients with excess blasts. CONCLUSIONS: Bone marrow transplantation offers a potential cure for many patients with myelodysplasia. Best results can be expected in younger patients who receive transplants relatively early in their disease course.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To review recent advances in the understanding of pathogenic and pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying bacterial meningitis that may lead to the development of adjunctive strategies for treating this disorder. DATA IDENTIFICATION: Studies published from 1975 to 1989 were identified using Index Medicus and by reviewing the bibliographies of identified articles. STUDY SELECTION: We reviewed the experimental and human studies evaluating pathogenesis, pathophysiology, and antimicrobial treatment of bacterial meningitis, as well as those reviews that have contributed to our understanding of meningitis. DATA EXTRACTION: We evaluated the data on the pathogenesis, pathophysiology, and treatment of bacterial meningitis and considered in depth the information from animal models that may have potentially important applications in the treatment of human disease. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: Penicillin and ampicillin remain the drugs of choice for meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. The third-generation cephalosporins have revolutionized the treatment of gram-negative bacillary meningitis; one such agent, ceftazidime, is also useful for treating Pseudomonas aeruginosa meningitis. Modification of subarachnoid space inflammation by anti-inflammatory agents may lessen many of the pathophysiologic consequences of bacterial meningitis. A recent study of adjunctive dexamethasone therapy in infants and children with bacterial meningitis showed that the incidence of long-term neurologic sequelae was lower in the corticosteroid group. CONCLUSION: Future therapy for bacterial meningitis will use recent developments in the understanding of pathogenic and pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying this disease. Additional studies using monoclonal antibodies against specific virulence factors and investigations into the production of inflammatory cytokines in response to bacterial cell products may lead to additional treatments that decrease the high morbidity and mortality in patients with bacterial meningitis.\r"

The purpose of this paper is to present a child who was aphonic at birth and who was later found to have a congenital anterior cleft of the larynx. The diagnosis is established by the clinical symptoms, direct laryngoscopic examination, and radiographic studies. While severe voice change is the most prominent symptom of this defect, chronic aspiration is also a disquieting symptom, albeit controllable. The literature is reviewed, and the patient's symptoms and radiographic findings are documented. The clinical course over a period of almost 4 years is discussed.\r"

In parallel with the PAE investigation, viability and morphology studies were performed. The strain was exposed for 2 h to different concentrations of beta-lactam antibiotics. The antibiotic activity was eliminated by 10(-4) dilutions, and regrowth of bacteria was monitored hourly by the bioluminescence assay of bacterial ATP. The length of PAE was dose dependent for ceftazidime (0.5 to 2.6 h), cefuroxime (0.4 to 2.6 h), and imipenem (0.3 to 4.5 h). The long PAE for these antibiotics at higher concentrations was associated with a potent initial killing and the presence of spheroplasts. Aztreonam and piperacillin produced a short, non-dose-dependent PAE (0.4 to 0.95 h). Short PAEs (below 1 h) were seen concomitantly with production of filaments, except in the case of imipenem, which only produced spheroplasts. The bioluminescence method was not jeopardized by filament formation, in contrast to the viable count assay which is normally used for PAE investigations. This makes it possible to study PAE for beta-lactam antibiotics on gram-negative bacteria with bioluminescence.\r"

Expression of beta-galactosidase by the fusion plasmid pUB3610 remained subject to regulatory control by the TetR repressor protein, with the presence of tetracyclines in the growth medium leading to a 12-fold induction of beta-galactosidase synthesis. Because synthesis of beta-galactosidase was influenced to a small extent by the carbon source and the addition of cyclic AMP to the medium, cells were grown in the presence of cyclic AMP to enhance the sensitivity of the assay. All commonly marketed tetracyclines and some derivatives at concentrations as low as 0.1 ng/ml could be detected in the growth medium. A plate assay utilizing the fusion plasmid that detects 1 ng of tetracycline has also been developed.\r"

Following surgical debridement, the ciprofloxacin patients received 750 mg twice a day, and the other patients received a broad-spectrum cephalosporin or a nafcillin-aminoglycoside combination intravenously (i.v.). There were 31 evaluable patients in the ciprofloxacin group, treated an average of 56 days, and 28 in the i.v. group, treated an average of 47 days. Clinical success rates were 24 of 31 (77%) for the ciprofloxacin group and 22 of 28 (79%) for the i.v. group. Of the seven failures in the ciprofloxacin group, one was due to a persistent Klebsiella pneumoniae infection and six were due to relapse of the infection within 1 year of therapy. Of the six failures in the i.v. group, one was due to an Enterobacter aerogenes strain which emerged resistant and five were due to relapse. The most troublesome etiology was polymicrobial osteomyelitis involving Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in which five of six (83%) regimens failed. Adverse reactions occurred infrequently, i.e., in 1 of 31 (3%) of the ciprofloxacin patients and in 4 of 28 (14%) of the i.v. patients, yet all reactions responded to therapy and none required protocol deviation. Our data indicate that oral ciprofloxacin monotherapy is as safe and effective as conventional parenteral therapy in cases of osteomyelitis caused by susceptible organisms.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of resistance to tetracycline in Escherichia coli mediated by the Campylobacter jejuni-derived resistance determinant Tet(O) was investigated. The cloned Tet(O) protein had no detectable effect on the intracellular accumulation of tetracycline. The presence of Tet(O) markedly diminished the inhibitory effect of tetracycline on protein synthesis both in vivo and in vitro. Ribosomes prepared from tetracycline-resistant and susceptible E. coli cells bound almost identical amounts of radiolabeled tetracycline. Thus, a reduction in the binding of the antibiotic to its target site on the ribosome is not the primary mechanism of resistance. Poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis revealed that an S-100 fraction prepared from tetracycline-resistant cells made the ribosomes prepared from susceptible cells considerably more resistant to the inhibitory action of tetracycline. The N-terminal portion (1 to 150 residues) of Tet(O) is highly homologous to the GTP-binding domain of elongation factor Tu and to elongation factor G, indicating that the Tet(O) protein has the potential to bind GTP. These data suggest that the Tet(O) protein could function either as a tetracycline-resistant analog of this elongation factor(s) or by modifying the target sites on the ribosomes in a catalytic fashion.\r"

Agents Chemother. 31:865-869, 1987), we reported that many of the 7-aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, such as cefmenoxime, showed paradoxically reduced activity against Proteus vulgaris at higher concentrations, whereas these paradoxical effects were not observed for other types of cephalosporins, such as cefbuperazone and cefoperazone. In this study, we compare the therapeutic effect of cefmenoxime with that of cefbuperazone and explore the in vivo paradoxical effect of cefmenoxime by using an experimental infection model in mice. In an intraperitoneal infection with P. vulgaris 11, the survival rate with cefmenoxime was increased to 43% at 3.13 mg/kg but was lower at higher doses. On the other hand, cefbuperazone did not show such a paradoxical therapeutic effect. In mice infected with P. vulgaris 11, cefmenoxime levels in both serum and peritoneal washings were rapidly reduced and beta-lactamase activities in the peritoneal cavity were increased at higher cefmenoxime doses. These findings suggested that high levels of cefmenoxime at the infection site induced increased production of beta-lactamase, which then rapidly inactivated the antibiotic. We conclude that the paradoxical therapeutic effect of cefmenoxime against P. vulgaris occurs by the same mechanisms as the in vitro effect and that the high beta-lactamase inducibility and low beta-lactamase stability may account for the paradoxical therapeutic effect of cefmenoxime against P. vulgaris.\r"

We investigated the influence of five antifungal agents on PMN function and compared them with amphotericin B (AmB). The in vitro effects of AmB, flucytosine, ketoconazole, fluconazole, Sch-39304, and cilofungin (LY121019) on chemotaxis, phagocytosis, oxidative metabolism of PMN as reflected by superoxide anion (O2-) generation, and intracellular killing of Candida albicans blastoconidia were examined. With regard to chemotaxis in response to N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, as measured by the multiwell chamber method, AmB induced a marked decrease (greater than or equal to 5 micrograms/ml), whereas ketoconazole at 5 micrograms/ml enhance it. Phagocytosis was significantly decreased after pretreatment of PMNs with AmB and Sch-39304 (greater than 5 and 1 to 10 micrograms/ml, respectively). O2- production after stimulation of PMNs with N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenyl-alanine was significantly decreased by AmB (greater than 5 micrograms/ml) and enhanced by Sch-39304 (1 to 5 micrograms/ml). In contrast, intracellular killing, as tested by methylene blue staining, was enhanced by ketoconazole (5 micrograms/ml) and Sch-39304 (1 to 5 micrograms/ml). Flucytosine, fluconazole, and cilofungin did not affect PMN function at therapeutic concentrations. The results of this comprehensive study indicate that AmB, flucytosine, cilofungin, and the newer azoles, at safely achievable concentrations, generally do not suppress PMN function at therapeutic enhance selective functions.\r"

Two nucleoside analogs of cytosine, 5-azacytidine and 5-azadeoxycytidine, which seem to have such value because of their capabilities to affect both the stability and the methylation patterns of the nucleic acids into which they are incorporated, were tested for their ability to inhibit the replication of HIV type 1 (HIV-1) in human CEM T cells in vitro. 5-Azadeoxycytidine (1 microM) completely inhibited HIV replication in CEM cells, by the criteria of reduced viral antigen expression and decreased supernatant reverse transcriptase activity, with little toxicity for the treated cells. 5-azacytidine (1 microM) also inhibited HIV replication, but less effectively. When added 2 or more h after CEM cells were infected with HIV-1, both 5-azacytosine derivatives were less effective than they were when added at the time of infection. Even 2 h of exposure to 5-azadeoxycytidine was sufficient for inhibition of HIV replication. Although long exposure to either analog at concentrations of 1 microM would result in pronounced cellular cytotoxicity, the the fact that short exposures to the same dose of drug inhibit HIV replication but are not toxic for the cells implies that cellular toxicity itself is not an important mechanism of the antiviral action of the analogs.\r"

The mean half-lives in serum of a single 20-mg/kg dose of free (nonencapsulated) gentamicin in mice and rats were estimated to be 1.0 and 0.6 h, respectively, whereas a similar dose of encapsulated drug had apparent mean half-lives of 3.8 h in mice and 4.0 h in rats. In both species, the apparent half-life in serum of the liposomal formulation increased as the dose increased. Liposome encapsulation resulted in higher and more prolonged activity in organs rich in reticuloendothelial cells (especially spleen and liver). In acute septicemia infections in mice, the liposomal formulation showed enhanced prophylactic activity (as determined by calculation of the 50% protective dose). In a model of murine salmonellosis, liposomal gentamicin greatly enhanced survival when given as a single dose (10 mg/kg) at 1 or 2 days after infection as well as up to 7 days before infection.\r"

The data reported indicate that aminoglycosides inhibit or delay bacterial catabolism of carboxylic acids, with the following relative degrees of activity: amikacin greater than gentamicin greater than sisomicin greater than netilmicin greater than kanamycin. The decrease in total biomass production was proportional to the degree of tricarboxylic acid cycle inhibition.\r"

Bacterial counts during the experiments were subjected to nonlinear least-squares analyses by using a mathematical model that explained the bacterial killing by the antibiotic concentration time course and other factors associated with antimicrobial potency and bacterial growth. Cefazolin gave a killing curve that changed synchronously with the drug levels in serum; in contrast, cefmenoxime gave a curve that was prolonged as compared with the change in the drug levels in serum. Multiple correlation coefficients were about 0.9, and the model worked well for bacterial count data. Parameters relating to antimicrobial potency of the drugs, bacterial growth rate, and drug distribution into the tissue were estimated numerically.\r"

However, the insensitivity of the assays and the interlaboratory variability are frequent problems. To determine the extent of this variability, one aliquot of serum from each of nine patients with a history of Lyme disease was sent to nine reference laboratories, including national, university, state, and local hospital laboratories. A second aliquot of the original serum was submitted 2 weeks later. Wide variability among laboratories was observed, ranging from a university laboratory that detected antibody to B burgdorferi (IgG or IgM) in 18 of 18 specimens, to a state laboratory that detected antibody in only 8 of 18 specimens. Detection of IgM specific antibodies showed similar variability (range, 2 to 10 of 18). There were eight instances of a fourfold or greater change in titer between the aliquots sent 2 weeks apart, although only three of these were an increase in titer. These results indicate the need for standardization of the assays and the availability of national reference material. It is recommended that the results of serologic testing should not be relied on as the sole criteria in making the diagnosis of Lyme disease.\r"

We prospectively evaluated diabetic patients with non-limb-threatening lower-extremity infections not yet treated with antibiotics. The patients were randomized to outpatient treatment with oral clindamycin hydrochloride or cephalexin for 2 weeks and evaluated every 3 to 7 days. In 56 assessable patients, curettage yielded a mean of 2.1 microorganisms. Aerobic gram-positive cocci were isolated in 50 cases (89%), and were the sole pathogen in 21 (42%) of these. Aerobic gram-negative bacilli and anaerobes were isolated in 20 (36%) and 7 (13%) cases, respectively, and almost always in polymicrobial infections. Fifty-one infections (91%) were eradicated, 42 (75%) after 2 weeks of treatment; only 5 (9%) were initially treatment failures, and 3 (5%) were subsequently cured with further outpatient oral antibiotic treatment. After a mean follow-up of 15 months, no further treatment was required in 43 (84%) of the cured patients. Previously untreated lower-extremity infections in diabetic patients are usually caused by aerobic gram-positive cocci, and generally respond well to outpatient management with oral antibiotic therapy.\r"

Fifty-two spontaneously breathing, cooperative patients with free-flowing effusions obliterating more than half of the hemidiaphragm on an upright, posteroanterior chest roentgenogram were randomized. When we analyzed those complications that were potentially life-threatening (eg, pneumothorax) and/or placed patients at increased risk for further morbidity (eg, pneumothorax, dry tap, inadequate tap), the sonography-guided method was associated with significantly fewer serious complications (0 of 19) than the needle-catheter (9 of 18) or needle-only methods (5 of 15). The sonography-guided method was associated with fewer pneumothoraces (0 of 19) than the needle-catheter (7 of 18) or needle-only methods (3 of 15). The difference between needle-catheter and needle-only methods was not significant. From our results, we conclude that the method by which thoracentesis was performed significantly influenced the spectrum and frequency of complications, and the sonography-guided method was the safest.\r"

  ".W": "A 6-month double-blind, parallel, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter trial of auranofin (0.15-0.20 mg/kg/day) was conducted in 231 children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) in the United States and in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Approximately 80% of the children had polyarticular disease. The auranofin-treated patients showed greater mean decreases from baseline in 11 of the 12 articular disease indices measured than did the placebo-treated subjects after 3 months of therapy, and in 9 of the 12 indices after 6 months. However, the actual intergroup mean differences were relatively small and were not statistically significant. According to the physician's global assessment, 69% of the auranofin-treated patients and 61% of the placebo-treated patients demonstrated clinically significant improvement from baseline after 6 months (P = 0.24). Children whose disease onset occurred less than 2 years prior to entry improved more than did those who had arthritis for a longer period. In addition, those with polyarticular involvement at baseline improved more than did patients with mild disease. However, these relationships were observed in both the auranofin- and placebo-treated groups, and again, there were no significant intergroup differences. Diarrhea was the most common adverse effect of auranofin. We conclude that the clinical efficacy of auranofin is modestly higher than that of placebo in the treatment of JRA, as evidenced by the consistent trends observed in the data. However, the magnitude of the individual intergroup differences is not statistically significant. Auranofin appears to be very safe in children with JRA.\r"

This distinction was further confirmed by the results of the analysis of the histogram patterns of echo intensity and echo frequency of the submandibular glands, which showed that the width of the echo level at 0% and 10% of the maximum normalized frequency was significantly greater in patients with Sjogren's syndrome than in the control subjects. Similar histographic findings were present in the parotid glands, although the heterogeneous ultrasonographic pattern was observed in only 8 of the 24 patients (33%).

Finding the balance between brevity, reliability, and comprehensiveness will improve practicality. The reliability of serial measurements using the various instruments in individual patients and in small groups of patients needs to be established. In the absence of a gold standard, validity will continue to be derived from testing new measures against accepted clinical measures. The ideal tool for use in clinical practice has not yet been developed. At this time, the clinician may choose among the many reliable and valid questionnaires assessing functional status, health status, and utility, according to his or her purpose. The information gathered from these instruments may help identify patients' problems, set treatment priorities, direct interventions, monitor the longitudinal course of disease, and assist in program evaluation and policy planning.\r"

Using the same samples, the recombinant anti-HIV-1/HIV-2 EIA (HIV-1/HIV-2 EIA) yielded a specificity of 99.84% (99.73-99.95%), 99.50% (98.78-100%), 95.96% (92.00-99.92%) and 98.58% (97.69-99.47%), respectively. All 776 Western blot-confirmed anti-HIV-1 sera were reactive in both EIAs, and the EIA-reactive samples from seroconverting plasma donors were always observed for both assays in the same serial bleed. For HIV-2, the HIV-1 EIA yielded an overall sensitivity of 75.83% (69.93-81.72%) compared with 99.53% (98.58-100%) for HIV-1/HIV-2 EIA. The addition of a recombinant env-protein of HIV-2 to the recombinant env and core proteins of HIV-1 on the solid phase of HIV-1 EIA improved the detection of anti-HIV-2 while preserving the assay's overall specificity and sensitivity for the detection of anti-HIV-1.\r"

Longer-chain derivatives (butyl- and isobutyl-cyanoacrylate) are much less histotoxic. Many surgeons continue to use ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate (Krazy Glue) despite the availability of a less toxic derivative, butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (Histoacryl). In this study, the histotoxicity and bone graft-cartilage binding ability of Krazy Glue and Histoacryl were compared. Bone grafts harvested from the anterior wall of the maxillary sinus were placed in a subcutaneous pocket and glued to auricular cartilage in the rabbit. Krazy Glue and Histoacryl were used in opposite ears, harvesting specimens at 1, 2, 4, 12, 24, and 48 weeks. The Krazy Glue-treated ears developed seromas with histologic evidence of acute inflammation, tissue necrosis, and chronic foreign body giant cell reaction. The Histoacryl-treated ears showed mild acute inflammation and mild foreign body giant cell reaction. The Krazy Glue was completely degraded within 12 months, while some Histoacryl was still present at 1 year. Histoacryl had minimal histotoxic effect and good bone graft-cartilage binding ability, whereas Krazy Glue demonstrated severe histotoxicity.\r"

Immunocytochemistry generally revealed an epidermal-type cytokeratin profile in the cholesteatoma matrix, except for the focal expression of nonepidermal cytokeratins at the invasion front. Comparable observations were made in the middle ear of the rat after an infection-induced invasion of epidermal cells from the meatal skin. An infection-induced-cornifying metaplastic lesion of the middle ear epithelium revealed nonepidermal cytokeratin expression. The results of this combined study suggested that the cholesteatoma specimens studied had an epidermal origin. The expression of nonepidermal cytokeratins was considered to result from a state of hyperproliferation rather than from metaplasia.\r"

TuJ1 antibody localization was performed using peroxidase immunostaining on paraffin sections of SCC, normal tissue, nude mouse SCC, and immunofluorescent microscopy of SCC cultured cells. The malignant tissues examined stained positive with TuJ1 and a general beta-tubulin antibody, whereas the normal tissues stained positively only for the general beta-tubulin antibody.

  ".W": "Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy continues to be one of the most commonly performed operations in the pediatric age group. The morbidity from tonsillectomy can be severe and includes throat and ear pain, fever, lethargy, and poor oral intake. A previous study at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (Pa) demonstrated the efficacy of amoxicillin therapy in minimizing some of these postoperative symptoms. However, some children continue to have a prolonged recovery even while receiving this antibiotic regimen. Because of these children and the high incidence of Staphylococcus found in tonsillar core tissue, a randomized, prospective study was undertaken at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia to evaluate the efficacy of cefaclor vs amoxicillin in patients recovering from tonsillectomy. The patients received either ampicillin or cefazolin intravenously at the time of surgery and for 12 to 24 hours postoperatively. When oral intake was adequate, they received either amoxicillin or cefaclor orally for 7 additional postoperative days. Intraoperative cultures of the oropharynx and tonsillar tissue were obtained, as well as cultures of the tonsillar fossa 7 to 14 days postoperatively. The patients were evaluated for severity and duration of postoperative symptoms as well as complications. The results of this study showed no difference between the two groups of patients. We conclude that there is no justification for routine use of cefaclor over amoxicillin in the posttonsillectomy patient.\r"

The clinical evaluation of an infant with recurrent meningitis is outlined, and the importance of brain-stem response audiometry and thin-cut computed tomography of the temporal bones is discussed. Surgical management depends on the functional status of the dysplastic ear; usually, a stapedectomy is performed and the vestibule is obliterated. Although the surgical failure rate is 30% after one procedure, early identification of the dysplasia and prompt surgical management diminish morbidity and mortality and permit early habilitation of the child with congenital hearing impairment.\r"

However, the FTA-ABS assay can have false-positive results and does not distinguish between active and treated disease. The VDRL test, which has been used to distinguish inactive disease, frequently yields negative results in patients who are nonetheless given the diagnosis of otosyphilis. A new Western blot assay can eliminate the possibility of a false-positive result and can confirm whether the infection is active. This assay was used to diagnose unsuspected active syphilis in a patient believed to have autoimmune ear disease. In three other cases of suspected otosyphilis, the diagnosis was refuted when the Western blot demonstrated that the FTA-ABS result was false-positive or that the infection was inactive.\r"

In addition, when three-day-old cultures were incubated in serum-free medium, a larger degradation of proteins was observed in infected cells in comparison to controls. An increase in protein degradation activity was observed also in vitro with extracts obtained from HIV-infected cells and incubated in the presence of endogenous- or exogenous-labeled substrates. Extracts from cells infected with heat-inactivated HIV did not show a similar degradative activity. The possible induction or activation of latent proteases during the development of the HIV infection is discussed.\r"

Sequences of stroke distances were measured by Doppler ultrasound in 60 resting patients with atrial fibrillation to determine the relation between ventricular rate and linear cardiac output. The slope of the cardiac output/ventricular rate relation was positive in all 20 patients with a ventricular rate less than 90 beats per minute and negative in 16 (40%) of 40 patients with a ventricular rate greater than 90 beats per minute. In atrial fibrillation the ventricular rate can be regarded as \"controlled\" when the cardiac output/ventricular rate slope is positive and \"uncontrolled\" when the slope is negative--that is when reduction of ventricular rate would lead to increased cardiac output. As so defined, ventricular rate at rest was controlled in every patient when the ventricular rate was less than 90, controlled in 44 (73%) patients when the ventricular rate was 90-140 beats per minute, and uncontrolled in every case when it was greater than 140 beats per minute. Achieving a target ventricular rate of 90 beats per minute in patients with atrial fibrillation at rest would result in control with the least compromise of cardiac output.\r"

Pressure half time and peak left ventricular inflow velocity were measured by continuous wave Doppler ultrasound in 164 patients with normally functioning Carpentier-Edwards, Bjork-Shiley, and Starr-Edwards mitral prostheses. Pressure half time was shorter in the Bjork-Shiley than in the other value types and peak transmitral velocity was highest in the Starr-Edwards prostheses. These differences, however, were partly explained by coexistent differences in transmitral flow. Filling time accounted for 19% and stroke volume for 15% of the variance in pressure half time compared with only 5.6% for prosthetic design and 0.4% for annulus diameter when each of these variables was considered alone. The design of the prosthesis explained 18% of the variance in peak transmitral velocity, while cardiac output and annulus diameter did not contribute significantly. With Doppler ultrasound it is impossible to define reliable normal ranges for prosthetic function independently of atrial and ventricular function. Formulas for orifice area based on peak transmitral velocity and flow seem more likely to reflect the behaviour of normally functioning prostheses than those based on pressure half time.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effects of recombinant human interleukin-4 (IL-4) on colony formation by enriched hematopoietic progenitors. IL-4 alone did not support colony formation at all. When IL-4 was combined with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), the number of pure neutrophil colonies increased three times over that supported by G-CSF alone. IL-4 added 5 days after the addition of G-CSF failed to exert this synergistic effect, indicating that IL-4 acts on the early stage of proliferation. The mapping experiments (sequential observation of colony formation) have clearly shown that IL-4 did not initiate progenitor cell proliferation. Based on these data, IL-4 may possess a direct action on progenitor cells; however, it can only act as a costimulant with G-CSF. In contrast, IL-4 had possible inhibitory effects on macrophage colony formation supported by interleukin-3 (IL-3) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). In other words, IL-4 may induce progenitor cells to become sensitive to G-CSF and thereby induce neutrophil differentiation. Delayed addition experiments demonstrated that human IL-4, unlike murine IL-4, could support neither proliferation nor survival of erythroid burst or mixed colony forming cells. Neutrophil colony forming cells only survived and recovered after addition of G-CSF and erythropoietin on day 5 of incubation. On the other hand, IL-3 supported neutrophil, erythroid burst, and mixed colony forming cells as reported previously (Sonoda et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 85:4360, 1988). These results led us to propose that IL-4 possibly acts with more mature progenitor cells than those of IL-3 or granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a protein produced by activated macrophages in response to endotoxin. The effect of recombinant murine TNF (rMuTNF) on the growth of murine tissue-derived macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-M) which are responsive to both macrophage and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors (M-CSF and GM-CSF), was studied. TNF alone did not stimulate macrophage proliferation but did prolong their survival in vitro. The proliferative response of CFU-M to M-CSF, however, was greatly enhanced by the presence of TNF. The enhancement effect of TNF is dose-dependent, reaching a maximum at approximately 50 U/mL. In contrast, the proliferative responsiveness of CFU-M to GM-CSF was inhibited by the concurrent addition of rMuTNF. Both effects appear to be caused directly by rMuTNF, rather than by the secondary factor(s) produced by TNF-treated macrophages. TNF treatment also induced a transient downmodulation of M-CSF receptors in cultured macrophages and accelerated their uptake and use of exogenous M-CSF, which may account for, at least in part, the enhanced proliferative activity in response to M-CSF. Short-term treatment (24 hours) was not sufficient to induce either an enhancing or an inhibitory effect upon CFU-M. This study suggests an autoregulatory role for TNF in the production of mature tissue macrophages by selectively enhancing their proliferative response to lineage specific growth factor, M-CSF.\r"
