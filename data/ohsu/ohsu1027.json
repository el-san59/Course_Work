  ".W": "Is a permanent injury more likely to elicit a rating of inappropriate care than a temporary injury? To explore this question, we asked 112 practicing anesthesiologists to judge the appropriateness of care in 21 cases involving adverse anesthetic outcomes. The original outcome in each case was classified as either temporary or permanent. The authors then generated a matching alternate case identical to the original in every respect except that a plausible outcome of opposite severity was substituted. The original and alternate cases were randomly divided into two sets and assigned to reviewers who were blind to the intent of the study. The reviewers were asked to rate independently the care in each case as appropriate, less than appropriate, or impossible to judge, based on their personal (implicit) judgment of reasonable and prudent practice. A significant inverse relationship between severity of outcome and judgments of appropriateness of care was observed in 15 (71%) of the 21 matched pairs of cases. Overall, the proportion of ratings for appropriate care decreased by 31 percentage points when the outcome was changed from temporary to permanent and increased by 28 percentage points when the outcome was changed from permanent to temporary. We conclude that knowledge of the severity of outcome can influence a reviewer's judgment of the appropriateness of care.\r"

After puberty, the faces of patients with fetal alcohol syndrome or fetal alcohol effects were not as distinctive. Patients tended to remain short and microcephalic, although their weight was somewhat closer to the mean. The average IQ was 68, but the range of IQ scores widely varied. Average academic functioning was at the second- to fourth-grade levels, with arithmetic deficits most characteristic. Maladaptive behaviors such as poor judgment, distractibility, and difficulty perceiving social cues were common. Family environments were remarkably unstable. Fetal alcohol syndrome is not just a childhood disorder; there is a predictable long-term progression of the disorder into adulthood, in which maladaptive behaviors present the greatest challenge to management.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the placental transfer of methamphetamine, its subsequent fetal disposition, and its hemodynamic effects, we administered methamphetamine intravenously to 15 pregnant ewes 3 days after placement of maternal and fetal vascular catheters. Methamphetamine crossed the placenta within 30 seconds of its administration. Although the ewes had higher peak concentrations, the fetuses' longer elimination half-life ultimately led to higher fetal than maternal methamphetamine concentrations. The ratio of fetal tissue to plasma drug concentration 2 hours after administration was highest in the lung, followed by the placenta, kidney, intestine, liver, brain, and heart. Methamphetamine caused a 54% to 63% rise in maternal blood pressure, a 20% to 37% increase in fetal blood pressure, and a drop in fetal oxyhemoglobin saturation and arterial pH. We conclude that methamphetamine, in doses at or below what is commonly abused, has effects that could be detrimental to the health of the mother and her fetus.\r"

Generic screening is relatively inefficient because of its multitiered review system and high rates of errors and false positives. Overall sensitivity may approach 70% to 80%, but specificity is estimated to range from about 22% to 73%. Effectiveness of generic screening in identifying problems in quality is limited by variability in peer review. Other limitations of generic screens include their lack of inherent relationship to the quality of patient care and their inability to provide direct performance measures for use in the periodic reappraisal of clinical privileges of medical staff members. We propose the monitoring of specific adverse surgical and medical clinical outcomes and related risk factors to increase efficiency in quality assessment and provide a more adequate database for the continual improvement of patient care and clinical performance.\r"

We developed a normal breath sound model using a prerecorded tape of breath sounds interspersed with segments without breath sounds; the recorder had been placed in the chest wall of a resuscitation training manikin. Flight nurses completed control listening sessions in a quiet environment and experimental sessions during flight using a traditional stethoscope for half of the sessions and an amplified stethoscope for the remaining half. In the quiet environment, flight nurses accurately reported the presence or absence of breath sounds in 110 (92%) of 120 trials. During helicopter flight, none of the flight nurses heard breath sounds during any of the recorded segments with either the traditional stethoscope or the amplified stethoscope. We conclude that flight nurses are unable to hear normal breath sounds using a traditional or amplified stethoscope during flight in a medically configured MBB BO-105 helicopter. Improved stethoscopes, innovative methods of listening, and reduction of aircraft noise are potential solutions to the problems of breath sound assessment during air medical transport.\r"

Using this summary dose-response slope, we calculated the proportional increase in risk of breast cancer for each year of estrogen use. For women who experienced any type of menopause, risk did not appear to increase until after at least 5 years of estrogen use. After 15 years of estrogen use, we found a 30% increase in the risk of breast cancer (relative risk, 1.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2 to 1.6). The increase in risk was largely due to results of studies that included premenopausal women or women using estradiol (with or without progestin), studies for which the estimated relative risk was 2.2 (CI, 1.4 to 3.4) after 15 years. Among women with a family history of breast cancer, those who had ever used estrogen replacement had a significantly higher risk (3.4; CI, 2.0 to 6.0) than those who had not (1.5; CI, 1.2 to 1.7).\r"

The effects of short-term hyperglycemia on one aspect of antimicrobial immune function, ie, the ability of IgG to fix complement, were investigated. Aliquots of anti-human albumin, anti-horse ferritin, and anti-alkaline phosphatase were incubated for 0, 8, 16, 24, 48, and 96 hr with either 0 or 240 mg of glucose per deciliter of buffer. All samples were analyzed for the degree of glycation using a thiobarbituric acid assay, and for complement fixation ability using a microcomplement fixation assay. Significant increases in glycation over control samples were observed after only 16 hr (31 vs 15 mmol 5-hydroxymethylfurfural/mol IgG, p less than 0.01). Complement fixation was significantly altered after 48 hr of incubation (76 +/- 5% vs 90 +/- 8% total serum complement fixed by albumin/anti-albumin complex, p less than 0.03) when four of the 84 (4.7%) IgG lysine residues were glycated. It is demonstrated that a significant reduction in complement fixation by immunoglobulin occurs with elevated glucose concentrations and that this may play a clinically significant role in transiently hyperglycemic patients.\r"

Twelve of the 13 patients who were treated medically had the disease diagnosed at autopsy. One of the 13 patients had the diagnosis of gallbladder cancer by the findings of ultrasonography and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scanning. The resectability of the surgically managed group was 36.1%, and the majority of patients with advanced tumors (82.2%) were deemed unresectable. The most common histologic type was adenocarcinoma. Liver was the organ most commonly invaded (76.5%) by direct extension and/or metastases, followed by regional lymph nodes (52.9%). The overall 5-year survival rate was 5.4%. A high index of suspicion of the disease, intraoperative examination of gallbladder specimen, and earlier, more aggressive surgical treatment may improve patient survival.\r"

We report here readily facilitated intraoperative approaches for detection of the exact margin of carcinomatous invasion of the esophagus. The resected specimen of the esophagus is incised longitudinally and placed in a 1% Lugol bath for 2-3 minutes. The normal squamous epithelium includes glycogen that interacts with the iodine of Lugol's solution and the normal epithelium of the esophagus becomes a uniform greenish-brown. A squamous cell carcinoma does not include glycogen, hence is not stained with this solution and a clear identification is feasible. Thus, a carcinomatous infiltration not recognizable in routine examinations becomes macroscopically visible when Lugol's solution is used.\r"

Forty-three percent of the evaluable patients had progressive disease with approximately 50% progressing at 5 years by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Overall actuarial survival in the group was 80% at 5 years. This and several other studies suggest that control of prostate cancer with Iodine-125 seeds may be suboptimal as compared with other treatment modalities, especially the radical retropubic prostatectomy. Analysis of treatment parameters is presented along with a discussion of the current status and future prospects for treatment of localized carcinoma of the prostate with interstitial radiation therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of the present study was to demonstrate the practicality of intraoperative fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology of pancreatic lesions in 43 patients. The indication for performing this procedure was to determine the nature of pancreatic masses. Conclusive cytologic diagnoses were reached in 41 patients who represent the present study. On the basis of histologic findings in 30 cases (73.2%) and on clinical findings in 11 cases (26.8%), a final diagnosis of malignant pancreatic disease (MPD) was established in 31 and of benign pancreatic disease (BPD) in 10 patients. Among the 31 cases with MPD, the cytologic diagnosis was correct in 30 patients and falsely negative in one patient. Among 10 patients with BPD, all the cytologic finding were reported as benign. The sensitivity and specificity and positive and negative predictive values for cytologic findings were 96.8%, 100%, 100%, and 90.9%, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of FNA cytology was 97.6%. No complications followed the procedure. We conclude that intraoperative FNA cytology of pancreatic lesions is a simple, safe, highly sensitive, and specific tool in differentiating benign from malignant pancreatic lesions. This procedure should be carried out in any patient with pancreatic mass incidentally found at laparotomy or in a patient undergoing surgery because of suspected nonmetastasizing MPD in whom repeated imaging guided FNA failed to demonstrate malignancy.\r"

Clinical staging showed five as stage I, six at stage IIb, two as stage IIc, seven as stage III, and in one no stage was possible. Microscopy showed seminoma, non-seminoma, and mixed tumors in 12, six, and three patients, respectively. As per protocol, stages I and IIb had either radiotherapy or retroperitoneal node dissection, giving three and five year survival of 11/11 (100%) and 7/7 (100%). All nine patients with stage IIc and stage III received induction chemotherapy (VAB-6) first and showed complete response (CR) in four (45%) and partial response (PR) in five (55%). Three and 5 year survival was 45% and 33%, respectively. Overall, 3 and 5 year survival was 70% and 69% respectively in all patients. Early stage disease (stages I, IIb) had excellent survivals, showing the adequacy of treatment, while patients with advanced tumor can still be salvaged with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy.\r"

One patient was administered the neutron beam and died after 94 months. The mean survival of this series is 73.4 months, with a survival rate of 50% (6 out of 12 patients alive). Surgical resection offers the best chance of survival, but chordomas have a propensity to metastasize, hence have a poor prognosis.\r"

The presenting symptom was related to involvement of a single bone with or without regional nodal disease. None showed dissemination of lymphoma in the subsequent six months. Patients affected were 7-65 years of age. An equal predilection for the axial and appendicular skeleton was noted. Histologically, the commonest subtype was diffuse histiocytic lymphoma (DHL, 17 cases), whereas four were poorly differentiated lymphocytic (PDL) type and another four were unclassifiable. Follow-up was available in 18 out of 25 patients for periods ranging from 7 months to 8 years. On clinicopathologic correlation we found that 75% of disease-free patients had a DHL whereas 60% of those alive with disease had a PDL. This study reiterates the view that PLB has a good prognosis and the DHL subtype is especially amenable to complete eradication.\r"

The atrial incisions prevent atrial reentry and allow sinus impulses to activate the entire atrial myocardium, thereby preserving atrial transport function postoperatively. Since September 1987, this surgical procedure has been applied in seven patients, five with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation of 2 to 9 years' duration and two with chronic atrial fibrillation of 3 and 10 years' duration. All seven patients have been cured of atrial fibrillation and none is receiving any postoperative antiarrhythmic medications.\r"

A mean negative fluid balance of 1.63 +/- 0.37 ml/kg/hr (standard error of the mean [SEM]) significantly improved the hemodynamic status within 59 +/- 6.1 hours (SEM). Although the central venous pressure decreased significantly from 15.2 +/- 0.84 to 8.8 +/- 0.92 mm Hg (p less than 0.0001), the mean arterial pressure increased significantly from 41.5 +/- 2.54 to 53.5 +/- 2.21 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). In addition, pH increased significantly from 7.31 +/- 0.01 (SEM) to 7.43 +/- 0.001 (SEM) (p less than 0.001) and oxygenation index (arterial oxygen tension/inspired oxygen fraction) from 119 +/- 15.2 (SEM) to 214 +/- 27.0 (SEM) (p less than 0.001). Hemodynamic improvement during slow continuous extracorporeal fluid removal allowed a significant decrease of the catecholamine infusion rate. After normovolemia had been achieved, continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration had to be continued in four children because of persistent anuria. Eight patients could be weaned from artificial ventilation and vasopressor support. Two patients died without recovery of renal function and one with restored renal function. Slow continuous ultrafiltration and continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration improve the cardiovascular function in children with low cardiac output by optimizing the preload conditions of the failing heart. In addition, they improve acid-base balance and pulmonary gas exchange.\r"

Cerebral blood flow was measured during steady-state hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass with the use of xenon 133 clearance methodology at two different arterial carbon dioxide tensions. During these measurements there was no significant change in mean arterial pressure, nasopharyngeal temperature, pump flow rate, or hematocrit value. Cerebral blood flow was found to be significantly greater at higher arterial carbon dioxide tensions (p less than 0.01), so that for every millimeter of mercury rise in arterial carbon dioxide tension there was a 1.2 ml.100 gm-1.min-1 increase in cerebral blood flow. Two factors, deep hypothermia (18 degrees to 22 degrees C) and reduced age (less than 1 year), diminished the effect carbon dioxide had on cerebral blood flow responsiveness but did not eliminate it. We conclude that cerebral blood flow remains responsive to changes in arterial carbon dioxide tension during hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass in infants and children; that is, increasing arterial carbon dioxide tension will independently increase cerebral blood flow.\r"

  ".W": "Single lung transplantation has recently been applied with success in patients with obstructive lung disease. Such patients were previously managed by bilateral pulmonary transplantation. Between November 1986 and January 1990, 18 patients underwent transplantation for obstructive lung disease in our center. Eleven double lung transplants and seven single lung transplants were performed in patients having a mean age of 43.4 and 44.1 years, respectively. Operative death occurred in two of 11 double lung transplantations and one of seven single lung transplantations. Each patient underwent preoperative and 3-month postoperative pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gas analyses, nuclear lung scans, and 6-minute walk tests. There was no difference in the preoperative values for any of these parameters. Double lung recipients had significantly higher forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity than single lung recipients. However, the ratios of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to vital capacity were not different. Arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide tension were not different between the two procedures. Whereas double lung transplantations caused a slight preponderance of perfusion to the right lung, the transplanted lung in single lung recipients received a mean of 79.5% +/- 12.3% of predicted flow and only 61.6% +/- 5.0% of predicted ventilation. Three-month 6-minute walk distances were markedly improved in both groups, with double lung recipients achieving 573.0 +/- 44.7 m in comparison with the 528.0 +/- 43.0 m achieved by the single lung recipients. Single lung transplantation is a satisfactory option in patients with obstructive lung disease and might offer significant advantages to the older patient population, in which risk of double lung transplantation is high.\r"

Survival, infection, and rejection rates among these patients were compared with those of 61 patients without cystic fibrosis who underwent heart-lung transplantation between 1984 and 1990. The cumulative survival rate was 72.29% +/- 94.91% at 1 year and 55.59% +/- 7.50% at 3 years. The mortality rate was slightly higher in the group with cystic fibrosis during the first year after the operation but it was lower at 3 years. The difference, however, could have been due to chance alone (p = 0.308). The same was true for the prevalence of rejection (up to 6 months: chi 2 = 1.8141, p = 0.17), and infection (up to 6 months: chi 2 = 2.20, p = 0.14), between the two groups.

We have performed 19 heart-lung transplants, with 1-month, 1-year, and 2-year actuarial survival rates of 95% +/- 5%, 84% +/- 8%, and 69% +/- 16%, respectively. Three early recipients died of bronchiolitis, and four patients who were operated on more than 2 years ago are currently being followed up with bronchiolitis. Since August 1988, 13 surviving recipients have undergone serial postoperative bronchoscopies and transbronchial biopsies with topical analgesia. Diffuse bronchomalacia, involving the main bronchi down to the fifth-order bronchi bilaterally, has developed in four patients with bronchiolitis 9 +/- 2 months after the diagnosis of bronchiolitis was confirmed. Pulmonary function tests have revealed a lower ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity, lower specific airway conductance, and higher airway resistance in heart-lung recipients with bronchomalacia than in patients with bronchiolitis alone. We conclude that diffuse bronchomalacia occurs frequently in heart-lung transplant recipients who have obliterative bronchiolitis. Bronchomalacia worsens the functional airflow obstruction caused by bronchiolitis and may play an important role clinically in the declining respiratory status of heart-lung transplant recipients.\r"

Postoperatively one to eight dilations (average three to four) were needed to relieve dysphagia in the first postoperative year, but later the stricture healed in every case. Postoperative pH measurement was performed in six latest patients and showed complete absence of reflux in all cases. It is concluded that Roux-en-Y partial gastrectomy with vagotomy and endoscopic dilation is an effective, simple, and safe procedure in the management of severe peptic esophageal (acid or alkaline esophagitis) stricture. However, occasional postoperative dilations at the outpatient clinic are often needed in severe cases in the first postoperative year.\r"

The median concentration of C3 activation products increased gradually from 12 AU/ml at baseline to 65 AU/ml after 120 minutes in the uncoated sets and from 12 AU/ml to 19 AU/ml after 120 minutes in the coated sets (p less than 0.002). The median concentration of the terminal complement complex in the uncoated sets increased gradually from 3.1 AU/ml at baseline to 18.2 AU/ml after 120 minutes. In the coated sets the terminal complement complex reached a peak of 12.0 AU/ml at 15 minutes and returned to baseline values at 60 minutes. Median platelet loss at 120 minutes was 166 x 10(9) in the uncoated and 21 x 10(9) in the coated sets (p less than 0.01). Heparin coating thus improved biocompatibility by reducing both complement activation and platelet loss.\r"

After a delay period of 4 weeks the skeletal muscle ventricles were connected to the descending thoracic aorta with a polytetrafluoroethylene bifurcation graft (Gore-Tex bifurcation graft, W.L. Gore & Associates, Inc., Elkton, Md.). The aorta was ligated between the two limbs of the graft so that there was obligatory blood flow through the skeletal muscle ventricle. Nine skeletal muscle ventricles were lined with autogenously derived tissue, either pleura or pericardium, whereas six had no specific lining other than an induced fibrous reaction. The skeletal muscle ventricles were activated to contract during cardiac diastole. Aortic diastolic counterpulsation was achieved in all dogs, with ten surviving from 1 week to beyond 9 months. Thrombus eventually developed in all but three of the skeletal muscle ventricles, but no dog had clinical evidence of thromboemboli. The three thrombus-free skeletal muscle ventricles were lined with pleura, including the animal surviving beyond 9 months. These results indicate that canine skeletal muscle can provide aortic diastolic counterpulsation for 9 months without clinically apparent thromboembolic complications.\r"

Pressure-volume loops constructed from these data allow calculation of stroke work and provide a more complete description of global left ventricular function immediately before cardiopulmonary bypass and at a mean of 18 and 34 minutes after termination of ischemic arrest. Early reperfusion was characterized by significant elevation of end-diastolic pressure (p less than 0.01) without a corresponding increase in end-diastolic volume. With continued reperfusion, end-diastolic volume, calculated stroke work, and cardiac output increased significantly with respect to control (p less than 0.05). Heart rate, ejection fraction, mean arterial pressure, stroke work/end-diastolic volume, and maximal dP/dt remained unchanged during the study period. No new focal abnormalities were detected in regional wall motion. These data indicate that minimal residual impairment of diastolic function exists during the acute recovery from cardioplegic arrest and bypass grafting but improves with further reperfusion. Systolic function appears to normalize more rapidly than diastolic function after ischemic arrest.\r"

Thus we previously demonstrated no uptake of carbohydrate or lipid substrates 1 hour after coronary operations. Amino acids were the only exogenous substrates taken up by the heart. The aim of the present study was to examine if this metabolic abnormality persisted a few hours later. This was done by measuring coronary sinus blood flow and arterial-coronary sinus differences of oxygen, glucose, free fatty acids, glycerol, lactate, beta-OH-butyrate, and amino acids in a similar group of 19 patients 4 to 5 hours after coronary operations. The results demonstrate a change toward normalization of myocardial free fatty acid use, although the threshold for free fatty acid uptake seemed elevated in comparison with that in the normal postabsorptive state. No correlation was found between free fatty acid uptake and myocardial oxygen consumption. Despite elevated arterial levels of glucose, lactate, pyruvate, and beta-OH-butyrate, no uptake was observed. Myocardial amino acid exchange demonstrated a pattern suggestive of postischemic metabolic adaptation. Several amino acids were extracted, glutamate and branched chain amino acids being the quantitatively most important. The uptake of glutamate and branched chain amino acids correlated with myocardial oxygen consumption, which suggests a direct link to myocardial energy metabolism. Myocardial glutamate uptake seemed to be limited by substrate availability.\r"

  ".W": "The protective effect of low-calcium, magnesium-free potassium cardioplegic solution on ischemic myocardium has been assessed in adult patients undergoing heart operations. Postreperfusion recovery of cardiac function and electrical activity was evaluated in 34 patients; 16 received low-calcium, magnesium-free potassium cardioplegic solution (group I) and 18 received St. Thomas' Hospital solution, which is enriched with calcium and magnesium (group II). There were no significant differences between the two groups in age, sex, body weight, and New York Heart Association functional class. Aortic occlusion time (107.3 +/- 46.8 minutes versus 113.6 +/- 44.3 minutes), highest myocardial temperature during elective global ischemia (11.5 degrees C +/- 3.1 degrees C versus 9.3 degrees C +/- 3.2 degrees C), and total volume of cardioplegic solution (44.2 +/- 20.5 ml/kg versus 43.4 +/- 17.6 ml/kg) were also similar in the two groups. On reperfusion, electrical defibrillation was required in four cases (25.5%) in group I and in 15 cases (83.3%) in group II (p less than 0.005), and bradyarrhythmias were significantly more prevalent in group II (6.3% versus 44.4%; p less than 0.05). Serum creatine kinase MB activity at 15 minutes of reperfusion (12.3 +/- 17.0 IU/L versus 42.6 +/- 46.1 IU/L; p less than 0.05) and the dose of dopamine or dobutamine required during the early phase of reperfusion (1.8 +/- 2.5 micrograms/kg/min versus 6.1 +/- 3.3 micrograms/kg/min; p less than 0.0002) were both significantly greater in group II. Postischemic left ventricular function, as assessed by percent recovery of the left ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relationship in patients who underwent aortic valve replacement alone, was significantly better in group I (160.4% +/- 45.5% versus 47.8% +/- 12.9%; p less than 0.05). Serum level of calcium and magnesium ions was significantly lower in group I. Thus low-calcium, magnesium-free potassium cardioplegic solution provided excellent protection of the ischemic heart, whereas St. Thomas' Hospital solution with calcium and magnesium enabled relatively poor functional and electrical recovery of the heart during the early reperfusion period. These results might be related to differing levels of extracellular calcium and magnesium on reperfusion.\r"

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of topical cooling to 15 degrees C, crystalloid cardioplegia, and blood cardioplegia in protecting 28 isolated neonatal lamb hearts subjected to 2 hours of ischemia. Seven hearts were isolated and perfused in a similar manner with cooling to 15 degrees C but were then rewarmed without any ischemia to serve as a control group. All three groups (topical cooling, crystalloid cardioplegia, and blood cardioplegia) had recovery of systolic function (as measured by maximum developed pressure, maximum rate of pressure rise, peak developed pressure at a fixed volume, and peak rate of pressure rise at a fixed volume) equal to the control group; the exception was peak rate of pressure rise at a fixed volume in the blood cardioplegia group, in which recovery was worse than in the control group. No differences among three ischemia groups or in comparison with the control group were found for measures of diastolic function (ventricular diastolic pressure at a fixed volume or stiffness constant kA). Systolic function declined in all groups (including control) from baseline to the end of the experiment. These findings suggest that hypothermia exerted the dominant protective effect in these normal neonatal lamb hearts and there was no added protection from either crystalloid or blood cardioplegia.\r"

Patients in group I received no allopurinol, those in group II received low-dose allopurinol (total dose 1200 mg), and those in group III received high-dose allopurinol (total dose 2400 mg). Aspartate aminotransferase, cardiac isoenzyme of creatine kinase, and lactic dehydrogenase levels were measured up to 5 days after operation. Concentrations of allopurinol and oxypurinol were also measured before initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass and at the start and at the end of aortic crossclamping. Postoperative aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase 1 plus lactate dehydrogenase 2 levels in group III were significantly lower than those in groups I and II. Aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase 1 plus lactate dehydrogenase 2 levels in group II were lower than those in group I, without statistically significant differences. Plasma oxypurinol concentrations were significantly higher in group III than in group II. It was concluded that allopurinol had resultant high myocardial protective effects in dose-related fashion, but its effect might be attributed to oxypurinol levels formed by its degradation.\r"

We compared the utility of two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of postoperative right-sided obstruction with cardiac catheterization and angiography in 10 patients with xenograft or homograft conduits. Correlation (r = 0.95) between continuous-wave Doppler estimates and catheter pullback pressure gradients across the conduits was excellent. Echocardiography could only visualize five of 10 conduits in their entirety. Magnetic resonance imaging visualized all conduits and showed statistically significant (kappa = 0.58) agreement with angiography in the localization and estimation of severity of a variety of right-sided obstructions in these patients. However, flow voids created by the metallic ring around xenograft valves led to a false negative diagnosis of valvular stenosis in four patients when magnetic resonance imaging was used alone. Doppler studies correctly indicated obstruction in these patients. The combination of magnetic resonance imaging studies and continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography can be useful to noninvasively evaluate right-sided obstruction in postoperative patients with right-sided extracardiac conduits.\r"

This study was performed to determine the short-term tolerance of the lung to hyperthermia. Isolated dog lung lobes were perfused with autologous blood or an artificial salt solution at constant flow. Measurements of lung weight, extravascular water, vascular volume, serotonin uptake, urea permeability surface area product, perfusion pressure, and lung compliance were made with the temperature at about 37 degrees C. The temperature was then set at between 37 degrees and 45 degrees C, and at the end of the subsequent 2 hours the measurements were repeated. When the temperature was less than about 44.4 degrees C, hyperthermia had no detectable influence on the measured variables. Thus on the time frame consistent with in vivo perfusion therapy the normal lung appears to tolerate a fairly severe hyperthermia.\r"

We designed a study to determine the efficacy and side effects of inhaled pentamidine in the primary prevention of PCP. METHODS. Two hundred twenty-three patients sero-positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who had the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) but not PCP, who had advanced AIDS-related complex, or who had less than 0.2 x 10(9) CD4-positive lymphocytes per liter received either 300 mg of pentamidine isethionate or 300 mg of sodium isethionate every 28 days by inhaler. The proportion of patients surviving without PCP was analyzed with the log-rank test as a function of time spent in the trial, according to the intention to treat with either placebo or pentamidine. RESULTS. The third of five planned interim analyses showed a significant difference in the occurrence of PCP, with 8 cases in pentamidine group and 23 in the placebo group (nominal P value = 0.0021). There were no deaths within 60 days of the diagnosis of PCP and no significant differences in survival between groups. Approximately 53 inhalations were needed to prevent one episode of pneumonia. Thirty-eight of 114 patients given pentamidine (33 percent) and 7 of 109 given placebo (6 percent) had moderate-to-severe coughing during inhalations (two-tailed P less than 0.00001), which caused 4 patients given pentamidine (3.5 percent) to discontinue taking it. CONCLUSIONS. A dose of 300 mg of aerosolized pentamidine given every four weeks was well tolerated and 60 to 70 percent effective in preventing a first episode of PCP in patients with HIV infection.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. New prognostic factors are needed to guide the treatment of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. We evaluated the prognostic value of altered expression of ABH blood-group antigens, which has been implicated in the multistep process of carcinogenesis and tumor progression. METHODS. The presence of blood-group antigens was assessed immunohistochemically in paraffin-embedded tumor samples from 164 patients who underwent curative surgery for non-small-cell lung cancer from 1980 through 1982. Monoclonal antibodies were used to detect the A and B antigens, and Ulex europaeus agglutinin I to detect H antigen. RESULTS. Survival of the 28 patients with blood type A or AB who had primary tumors negative for blood-group antigen A was significantly shorter than that of the 43 patients with antigen A-positive tumors (P less than 0.001) and of the 93 patients with blood type B or O (P = 0.002). The respective median survival times were 15, 71, and 39 months. Disease progressed significantly earlier in the 28 patients with tumors negative for blood-group antigen A than in the antigen A-positive patients (P less than 0.001). Expression of blood-group antigen B or H in tumor cells did not correlate with survival. Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis showed that expression of blood-group antigen A in tumor cells added significantly to the prediction of overall survival provided by other known prognostic factors among the patients with blood type A or AB (P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS. Expression of blood-group antigen A in tumor cells is an important favorable prognostic factor in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. This variable needs to be considered in the design of future trials of therapy.\r"

  ".U": "91179460\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a transmissible neurodegenerative disorder that occurs more than 100 times more frequently among Libyan Jews than in the worldwide population. We examined 11 patients with the disease--10 Libyan Jews from Israel and 1 Libyan Jew from Italy--to determine whether abnormalities of the prion protein could be detected in them. Abnormal forms of this host-encoded protein are the predominant if not sole components of the transmissible agent that causes the disease. METHODS. The prion-protein open-reading frame in peripheral-leukocyte DNA from the Italian patient was amplified with the polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization was used to assess a prion-protein codon 200 lysine mutation in the 10 Israeli patients and 37 control subjects. RESULTS. The prion-protein sequence in DNA from the Italian patient revealed a single nucleotide change (G----A) at the first position of codon 200 that resulted in a substitution of lysine for glutamate. This substitution was detected in all 10 Israeli patients, 8 of whom had a positive family history of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. One patient was homozygous for the lysine mutation, and her clinical course did not differ from that of the patients heterozygous for the mutation. The lysine mutation was not found in one Moroccan Jew from Israel with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. CONCLUSIONS. The codon 200 lysine mutation of the prion-protein gene is consistently present among Libyan Jews with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, strongly supporting a genetic pathogenesis of their illness. The similarity of the clinical courses of the patient homozygous for this mutation and the patients heterozygous for it argues that familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a true dominant disorder.\r"

  ".U": "91179461\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. To test the prognostic value of plasma renin activity prospectively, we determined the pretreatment renin-sodium profile of 1717 subjects with mild-to-moderate hypertension (mean age, 53 years; 36 percent white; 67 percent men) in a systematic work-site treatment program. METHODS. Renin profiles, obtained by plotting plasma renin activity against the urinary excretion of sodium, were classified as high (12 percent of the subjects), normal (56 percent), and low (32 percent), and there were expected variations according to age, sex, and race. Modified stepped-care treatment for hypertension, prescribed without reference to the renin profile, was similar in the three renin groups. RESULTS. Mean (+/- SD) blood pressure at entry was 151 +/- 19/100 +/- 10 mm Hg in the subjects with a high renin profile, 151 +/- 19/97 +/- 10 mm Hg in those with a normal profile, and 151 +/- 20/96 +/- 11 mm Hg in those with a low profile. During 8.3 years of follow-up, there were 27 myocardial infarctions. As adjusted for age, sex, and race, the incidence of myocardial infarction per 1000 person-years was 14.7 among the subjects with a high renin profile, 5.6 among those with a normal profile, and 2.8 among those with a low profile (rate ratio for high vs. low, 5.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 3.4 to 8.3). The rate of mortality from all causes was 9.3 in the high-profile group, 5.3 in the normal-profile group, and 3.9 in the low-profile group. The independent association of a high renin profile with myocardial infarction (but not with stroke or noncardiovascular events) was affirmed by Cox analyses (rate ratio for high vs. normal plus low, 3.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 8.4) after adjustment for race, sex, age at entry, serum cholesterol level, smoking status, electrocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, blood glucose level, body-mass index, history of cardiovascular disease or treatment, blood pressure, and use of beta-blockers. CONCLUSIONS. In the study population, whose blood pressure before and during treatment was in a narrow range, and after other cardiovascular risk factors had been considered, the renin profile before treatment remained independently associated with the subsequent risk of myocardial infarction.\r"

The floor plate arises from dorsal ectodermal cells closely associated with the mesoderm that forms notochord, and it may depend on interactions from the notochord for its specification. To learn the nature of these interactions we have analysed mutations in zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio). We report here that in wild-type embryos the floor plate develops as a simply organized single cell row, but that its development fails in embryos bearing the newly discovered zygotic lethal 'cyclops' mutation, cyc-1(b16). Mosaic analysis establishes that cyc-1 blocks floor plate development autonomously and reveals the presence of homeogenetic induction between floor plate cells.\r"

For example, geniculocortical axons that initially overlap throughout cortical layer IV segregate postnatally into two sets of interleaved eye-specific bands. NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors are necessary for eye-specific axon-segregation in the frog tectum, and as NMDA receptors play a greater part in synaptic transmission in early life and decrease in function during the period of axon segregation, they may be involved in the segregation of geniculocortical axons: they are well placed to do so as they transduce retinally derived signals essential for segregation. Rearing animals in the dark in early life delays segregation and prolongs the critical period for plasticity. We now report that dark-rearing of kittens also delays the loss of NMDA receptor function in the visual cortex, supporting the view that they play an important part in neuronal development and plasticity.\r"

The technique has recently been applied to excitatory synapses within the hippocampus, especially the form of synaptic plasticity known as long-term potentiation. However, these attempts have met with only limited success, in that the individual quantal amplitudes making up the synaptic response generally could not be resolved. Here we have paid attention to the possible instability of the quantal fluctuation pattern over time. We were able to resolve individual quantal component amplitudes for a high proportion of the experiments, and so demonstrate the quantal nature of excitatory transmission in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Mean quantal amplitudes for individual excitatory postsynaptic potentials were 84-197 microV, with a mean of 131 +/- 29 microV. For periods during which the fluctuation pattern was stable, the variance associated with individual quantal amplitudes was low. We have also used quantal analysis to show that synaptic depression following prolonged stimulation at these synapses is primarily a presynaptic phenomenon.\r"

  ".U": "91179514\r", 
  ".W": "Neurons sensitive to the orientation of light stimuli exist throughout the mammalian visual system, suggesting that this spatial feature is a fundamental cue used by the brain to decipher visual information. The most peripheral neurons known to show orientation sensitivity are the retinal ganglion cells. Considerable morphological and pharmacological data suggest that the orientation sensitivity of ganglion cells is formed, at least partly, by the amacrine cells, which are laterally oriented interneurons presynaptic to the ganglion cells in the inner plexiform layer. So far there have been few studies of the responses of amacrine cells to oriented visual stimuli and their role in forming orientation-sensitive responses in the retina remains unclear. Here I report the novel finding of a population of amacrine cells in the rabbit retina which are orientation-sensitive. These amacrine cells can be divided into two subtypes, whose orientation sensitivity is manufactured by two distinct mechanisms. The orientation sensitivity of the first subtype of amacrine cell is formed from the interactions of excitatory, centre-receptive field synaptic inputs and inhibitory inputs of opposite polarity, whereas that for cells of the second subtype seems to be the product of a marked asymmetry in their dendritic arbors.\r"

Uptake systems for the biogenic amines are the initial site of action for therapeutic antidepressants and drugs such as cocaine and the amphetamines. We have isolated a complementary DNA clone encoding a human noradrenaline transporter. The cDNA sequence predicts a protein of 617 amino acids, with 12-13 highly hydrophobic regions compatible with membrane-spanning domains. Expression of the cDNA clone in transfected HeLa cells indicates that noradrenaline transport activity is sodium-dependent and sensitive to selective noradrenaline transport inhibitors. Transporter RNA is localized to the brainstem and the adrenal gland. The predicted protein sequence demonstrates significant amino-acid identity with the Na+/gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter, thus identifying a new gene family for neurotransmitter transporter proteins. Analysis of its structure and function may lead to structure-based drug design for the treatment of human depression and could help determine whether transporter abnormalities underlie affective disorders.\r"

  ".W": "Glucose/galactose malabsorption (GGM) is an autosomal recessive disease manifesting within the first weeks of life and characterized by a selective failure to absorb dietary glucose and galactose from the intestine. The consequent severe diarrhoea and dehydration are usually fatal unless these sugars are eliminated from the diet. Intestinal biopsies of GGM patients have revealed a specific defect in Na(+)-dependent absorption of glucose in the brush border. Normal glucose absorption is mediated by the Na+/glucose cotransporter in the brush border membrane of the intestinal epithelium. Cellular influx is driven by the transmembrane Na+ electrochemical potential gradient; thereafter the sugar moves to the blood across the basolateral membrane via the facilitated glucose carrier. We have previously cloned and sequenced a Na+/glucose cotransporter from normal human ileum and shown that this gene, SGLT1, resides on the distal q arm of chromosome 22. We have now amplified SGLT1 complementary DNA and genomic DNA from members of a family affected with GGM by the polymerase chain reaction. Sequence analysis of the amplified products has revealed a single missense mutation in SGLT1 which cosegregates with the GGM phenotype and results in a complete loss of Na(+)-dependent glucose transport in Xenopus oocytes injected with this complementary RNA.\r"

The discussion has focused on the efficacy of the drug in delaying progression to disease, the severity of its side-effects, and the likelihood of its prolonged and widespread use resulting in zidovudine-resistant strains of the virus. Little attention has been given to the degree to which treatment reduces the infectiousness of symptomless patients, and to the concomitant implications for the overall transmission rate of HIV-1 in the community. Here we use simple mathematical models to show that community treatment with antiviral drugs or immunotherapies that lengthen the incubation period of AIDS without significantly reducing the infectiousness of treated individuals, can increase the rate at which HIV-1 infection spreads (which is fairly obvious) and can even, under certain circumstances, increase the AIDS-related death rate in the community (which is less obvious).\r"

Inappropriate tyrosine phosphorylation can lead to unrestrained cell growth and oncogenesis. Enzymes important in tyrosine dephosphorylation have also been described. Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) consist of two families. There is a receptor-like family of PTPases with an extracellular domain, transmembrane-spanning region and typically two repeated phosphatase domains. Proteins of the non-receptor-like family have a single catalytic phosphatase domain, show a substrate specificity for Tyr phosphate and will not hydrolyse Ser or Thr phosphate. Here we report that the vaccinia virus genome contains an open reading frame which shares amino-acid sequence identity with the PTPases. The purified protein encoded by the vaccinia virus H1 open reading frame expressed in bacteria hydrolyses substrates containing phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine. Mutagenesis of an essential Cys in the vaccinia phosphatase abolishes catalytic activity directed towards both substrates, suggesting that hydrolysis proceeds by a common mechanism. Understanding the function of the H1-encoded protein will help to define the role of the phosphatase in viral replication and pathogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "The nonessential amino acid glutamine has recently been the focus of extensive scientific interest because of its importance in cell and tissue cultures and its physiologic role in animals and humans. Glutamine appears to be a unique amino acid, serving as a preferred respiratory fuel for rapidly proliferating cells, such as enterocytes and lymphocytes; a regulator of acid-base balance through the production of urinary ammonia; a carrier of nitrogen between tissues; and an important precursor of nucleic acids, nucleotides, amino sugars, and proteins. Abundant evidence suggests that glutamine may become a \"conditionally essential\" amino acid in the critically ill. During stress the body's requirements for glutamine appear to exceed the individual's ability to produce sufficient amounts of this amino acid. Provision of supplemental glutamine in specialized enteral or parenteral feeding may enhance nutritional management and augment recovery of the seriously ill while minimizing hospital stay.\r"

Of 68 patients with AIDS and necrotizing retinal infections seen between 1983 and 1987, rhegmatogenous retinal detachments developed in 16 patients (27 eyes). In this group, cytomegalovirus retinopathy was present in 75% (12 of 16) of patients, 18.8% (3 of 16) had probable herpes simplex virus retinopathy, and 6.2% (1 of 16) had toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis. Retinal detachment was bilateral in 68.8% (11 of 16) of patients. The retina was reattached successfully in 91% (10 of 11) of operated eyes. Proliferative vitreoretinopathy was present preoperatively in 95% of these eyes. Seven of 11 operated eyes had initial improvement in visual acuity. However, 5 of 11 continued to lose vision despite successful reattachment. Techniques included pneumatic reattachment, scleral buckle, vitrectomy, and silicone oil injection. Complicated retinal detachments in AIDS patients with rhegmatogenous retinal detachments and necrotizing retinal infections are common and can be repaired, but the prognosis is guarded in many patients.\r"

Significant variables were then reevaluated using the Cox proportional hazards method. Four factors were found to be independently associated with the development of metastases: optic nerve invasion with and without involvement of the resection line, choroidal invasion and enucleation of an affected eye more than 120 days after initial diagnosis. The 5-year metastatic risks associated with these factors were 67%, 13%, 8%, and 4%, respectively. The relative risk estimate, calculated from the Cox model, was used for a score classification with groups of low, medium, and high metastatic risk. The 5-year incidence of metastases was 4%, 43%, and 68%, respectively.\r"

The infections were allowed to proceed for 24 and 72 hours. After incubation, ablation with a 193-nm excimer laser with 5.0-mm treatment zones was performed until all suppurative areas were treated. The corneas were excised, halved, homogenized, and plated. All cultures were negative in the 24-hour group. However, in those corneas in which the infections were allowed to proceed to 72 hours, post-treatment cultures were positive for both organisms. Histopathologic examination confirmed that 24-hour infections had been eradicated and that 72-hour infections had organisms present. Three of the eight eyes in the M. fortuitum group perforated during treatment, even though the treatment depth by computer preselection was only 150 microns. Excimer laser photoablation may be a useful technique to eradicate early, localized microbial infections. However, it is apparent that advanced infections with deep stromal involvement and suppuration cannot be eradicated using this technique. Because corneas may be perforated inadvertently during treatment, excimer laser treatment of infectious keratitis should be approached with caution and used for superficial and well circumscribed lesions.\r"

Serum and tear samples from these patients were analyzed to quantify total and specific IgE antibodies.

Although the mean values for total and specific IgEs in the serum of patients with atopic disease were markedly higher than the values from nonatopic controls (P less than 0.00002), a difference between the disease groups could not be demonstrated (P greater than 0.05). There were also differences between both the total IgE (P = 0.0002) and pollen-specific IgE (P = 0.015) in tears from patients with atopic disease and nonatopic controls, but not for house dust mite or cat dander-specific IgEs. These results suggest that clinical differences between groups of patients with chronic allergic external eye disease are not associated with specific patterns of IgE production.\r"

It generally occurs within a corneal graft. Viridans streptococci are usually isolated, but the clinical response to antibiotics is poor and disparate with the in vitro antimicrobial sensitivities. These features suggest the possibility of unusual bacterial factors in pathogenesis. Four cases caused by nutritionally variant viridans streptococci are described. The organisms were fully characterized. They have a rare nutritional requirement for pyridoxal and require defined culture conditions and specific identification. Nutritional variant streptococci (NVS) are principally described as causing endocarditis, another infection involving an avascular collagenous tissue, and exhibiting similar biologic behavior. Electronmicrographic evidence is also adduced that suggests the possible importance of intracorneal glycocalyx deposition. Such factors might explain the anomalous clinical characteristics of this condition.\r"

M-mode and two dimensional echocardiography and cardiac auscultation detected no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of mitral valve prolapse in patients with keratoconus compared with controls. Formal, systematic examination of five joints also failed to detect a statistically significant difference in the prevalence of hypermobile joints in keratoconus patients and controls.

  ".W": "Two different suturing techniques performed during keratoplasty were retrospectively evaluated to compare postkeratoplasty astigmatism, number of suture manipulations, and time to optical stability. One group of patients (n = 31) received a combination of continuous 11.0 nylon suture and 12 or 16 interrupted 10.0 nylon sutures (CCIS), which were selectively removed post-operatively to reduce astigmatism. The second group of patients (n = 26) received a single continuous 10.0 nylon suture (SCS) that was adjusted postoperatively at the slit lamp to regulate corneal astigmatism. Compared with the CCIS technique, adjusting the single continuous suture resulted in less postoperative astigmatism (SCS, 1.5 +/- 1.1 diopters [D]; CCIS, 3.2 +/- 1.9 D), fewer suture manipulations per patient (SCS, 0.9 +/- 0.7; CCIS, 3.8 +/- 1.8), and earlier optical stability for visual rehabilitation (SCS, 2.6 +/- 1.5 months; CCIS, 9.6 +/- 4.7 months) (P less than 0.01). No continuous sutures were broken during adjustment. The adjustable single continuous suture may offer an improved method for early control of postkeratoplasty astigmatism.\r"

  ".W": "The diameter of the cone lens of the specular microscope was enlarged from its original size of 3.5 mm to 6.0 mm. This modification enabled the authors to take clear pictures of the corneal epithelium with a specular microscope (SM) contact lens, because tears could be excluded from the photographic field by exerting even pressure on the cornea. The normal corneal epithelium showed three kinds of cells with no abnormally shaped or reflex cells. As spindle-shaped cells were mainly observed in keratoconus patients, post-penetrating keratoplasty patients, and postepikeratophakia patients, this suggests that these cells may be an indicator of wound healing. Large cells were observed in diabetic aphakic patients, aphakic extended-wear soft contact lens wearers, and aphakic patients using 0.5% indomethacin eye drops; thus, the presence of large cells may indicate suppressed metabolism and mitosis. Colonies of small cells were observed in keratoconjunctivitis patients. Cells with nuclei and irregular cell patterns were observed in all diseased conditions. There are several common abnormal patterns in the corneal epithelium that are observable under the specular microscope. Modified specular microscopic observation can detect these subtle alterations at the cellular level.\r"

  ".W": "Climatic droplet keratopathy (CDK) is a degenerative disease of the cornea, highly prevalent in Saudi Arabia. It is characterized by aggregates of small, golden-yellow globules that accumulate in the subepithelial layers, Bowman's layer, and the superficial stroma of the cornea. The authors report on 22 patients (40 eyes) with CDK and lattice lines in the cornea. The condition occurred late in life (mean age, 67 years). It was bilateral in 82% of patients, with no family history of lattice dystrophy or systemic amyloidosis. These lines were found in all layers of the stroma. Results of histopathologic and electron microscopic examination of the lattice lines confirmed the presence of amyloid. Results of immunohistochemical examination showed evidence of deposition of AP protein. The cause of these deposits in the cornea is not known, but the authors speculate that environmental factors causing CDK also may play a role in the deposition of protein AP in the cornea. The contribution of trachoma to the degenerative changes in the cornea and secondary amyloidosis could not be ruled out, as all patients had inactive trachoma. Climatic droplet keratopathy with corneal amyloidosis, therefore, represents a form of \"lattice degeneration\" of the cornea.\r"

The authors examined 113 variables in the study group and a procedure-matched control group of 217 patients randomly selected from the 35,459 patients who underwent intraocular surgery during this period, and subjected them to bivariate and conditional logistic regression analysis. The incidence of SEH was 0.19% overall, 0.16% for lens-related procedures, 0.15% for glaucoma surgery, 0.41% for retinal and vitreous procedures, and 0.56% for keratoplasty. Statistically significant risk factors for SEH in age-adjusted bivariate analyses included: glaucoma (P less than 0.0001), increased axial length (P less than 0.0001), elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) (P less than 0.0001), generalized atherosclerosis (P = 0.007), and elevated intraoperative pulse (P = 0.0001). Conditional logistic regression analysis with frequency matching on age identified significant independent risks associated with a history of glaucoma, elevated IOP, increased axial length, and intraoperative tachycardia. One of the models predicts a 752-fold increased theoretical relative risk of SEH for a patient with axial length greater than or equal to 25.8 mm, a history of glaucoma, preoperative IOP greater than 18 mmHg, and intraoperative pulse greater than or equal to 85 beats per minute. The visual outcome after SEH was best in cases of extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE), compared with other procedures. Results suggest that attention to multiple preoperative and intraoperative ocular and systemic variables may allow identification and prophylaxis of patients at risk for SEH.\r"

In 25 eyes (45.4%), this was the first surgical procedure. Follow-up ranged from 3 to 27 months (mean, 10.3 +/- 5.4 months). The mean preoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) was 39.5 +/- 8.6 mmHg (range, 22 to 66 mmHg). The mean postoperative IOP was 17.8 +/- 7.6 mmHg (range, 4 to 50 mmHg). Intraocular pressure remained less than 21 mmHg in 50 eyes (90.9%) during the follow-up period. In 13 of these eyes (26.0%), IOP remained under control without any medication. Complications were observed in 13 eyes (23.6%) and were successfully treated in 11 of them. Complications included iris-tube block (5.4%), vitreous-tube block (3.6%), early postoperative flat anterior chamber (1.8%), choroidal effusion (3.6%), tube exteriorization from anterior chamber (3.6%), tube displacement from silicone band (1.8%), retinal detachment (1.8%), tube-cornea touch (1.8%), vitreous hemorrhage (1.8%), infectious endophthalmitis (1.8%), and phthisis bulbi (1.8%). Modified 90 degrees Schocket implants are an effective technique in the management of refractory glaucoma.\r"

In four eyes, internal laser revision was attempted initially. Internal revision was successful in one case, where the sclerostomy had become occluded by a fibrous membrane. The Nd:YAG laser was then focused transconjunctivally onto the episcleral fibrous tissue within the bleb in the three eyes treated unsuccessfully by the internal approach and used as a primary treatment in three additional cases. Transconjunctival laser treatment was successful in producing an immediate and substantial decrease in intraocular pressure (IOP) (mean IOP reduction of 12 mmHg at 2 hours posttreatment) in all cases. In six of seven cases, there was a persistent reduction of intraocular pressure with an average of 5.7 months of follow-up. Transconjunctival Nd:YAG laser revision of hypofunctioning filters may be effective in restoring filtration in selected cases.\r"

The authors undertook a prospective, double-masked, randomized study to see if a pH-adjusted mixture of lidocaine, bupivacaine, and hyaluronidase had faster and more complete onset of neural blockade, when used for peribulbar anesthesia. Eighty patients were randomly assigned to four groups and received a peribulbar block with one of four mixtures: group 1 (L) = 2% lidocaine, group 2 (LPH) = 2% lidocaine with 0.06 meq/ml sodium bicarbonate, group 3 (LE) = 2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine (commercially prepared), or group 4 (LEPH) = 2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine with 0.06 meq/ml sodium bicarbonate. To 5 ml of each of the preceding groups, 5 ml of 0.75% bupivacaine and 150 units of hyaluronidase was added. After each block, extraocular muscle movement was followed in each quadrant until akinesia developed. In the event of incomplete akinesia, blocks were supplemented at 20 minutes. The LPH group had the fastest onset to complete akinesia (7.0 +/- 2.0 minutes, mean +/- SEM) when compared with the onset time of all other groups (group 1 = 11.5 +/- 1.9 minutes, group 4 = 13.1 +/- 1.4 minutes, and group 3 = 16.0 +/- 1.8 minutes, significance greater than 95% by analysis of variance). Furthermore, when compared with group 3 by analysis of variance, group 4 had a faster onset time. The authors conclude that pH-adjustment of solutions with bicarbonate of either lidocaine/bupivacaine/hyaluronidase or commercially prepared lidocaine with epinephrine/bupivacaine/hyaluronidase decreases the onset time of peribulbar anesthesia.\r"

An analysis of complication rates was done after normalization of data with respect to market share totals. The results establish that an unacceptable complication rate is associated with the closed-loop design when compared with either the tripod or quadripod lens styles. Furthermore, the closed-loop designs, while comprising an estimated 45% of the total number of AC-IOLs estimated to be implanted in the United States (n = 674,000), were responsible for 80% of the AC-IOLs explanted after complications and accessioned at the authors' center. A rethinking of the extreme condemnation of all anterior chamber IOLs that has surfaced in recent years is warranted. This is particularly true with respect to indications for use of sutured posterior chamber (PC) IOLs as well as with regard to possible use of open-loop AC-IOLs in less-industrialized nations.\r"

Traumatic injury to the inferior rectus muscle secondary to retrobulbar anesthesia injection, a specific subset, is postulated to result from a Volkmann's type ischemic contracture, a well-known osseofascial compartment syndrome occurring in peripheral skeletal muscles. 4) Disorders related to resulting aphakia/pseudophakia and associated optical aberrations (e.g.; anisophoria, ocular dominance reversal, and color/brightness disparity).

Initial treatment of plantar keratoses is trimming and use of cushioning shoe inserts. Diffuse keratoses may require reconstructive surgery if metatarsal deformity is the cause. Seed corns and soft corns respond to trimming, and alleviation of pressure with padding and wearing of open-toed shoes is beneficial in these lesions as well as in hard corns. Surgical resection of any underlying exostosis may be required for hard or soft corns or \"pump bumps,\" which are caused by pressure from the shoe's heel. In all cases, patients should be advised to change to shoes that provide plenty of room in the toe box and that minimize friction on painful areas.\r"

The aim of the study was to determine whether the recruitment order of motor units elicited by over-the-muscle electrical stimulation is different from that achieved with voluntary activation of muscle. This difference was tested by comparing muscle twitch responses that were elicited by Hoffmann reflexes (H-reflexes) and direct motor responses (M-responses) and by examining the effect of submotor NMES on the twitch force associated with H-reflexes. Because H-reflexes represent the summed activity of many motor units, in a manner that is consistent with volitional activation, variation in the time to peak twitch force indicates changes in the population of motor units that contribute to the response. The results demonstrated that the percutaneous application of submotor NMES to the limbs of human subjects causes a faster-contracting population of motor units to be activated during a test H-reflex. Consequently, it seems that the application of NMES preferentially activates faster-contracting motor units, perhaps those that are normally only active at high exercise intensities under voluntary conditions.\r"

One hundred seven active-duty military volunteers were measured for crutches using each of the following methods: (1) axillary fold to heel in the supine position, (2) olecranon to opposite third fingertip, (3) olecranon to opposite fifth fingertip, (4) 77% of height, (5) height minus 16 in (40.6 cm), (6) 77% of arm span, and (7) arm span minus 16 in (40.6 cm). The subject's self-reported heights and their actual measured heights were both used in calculations involving height. Ideal crutch length was determined by an experienced orthopedic physical therapist, with placement of the axillary pad 2.5 in (6.4 cm) below the axillary fold. Mean squared error indices were then computed as the average of the squared deviations of the technique measurements from the ideal crutch length. Of the techniques studied, the two involving minor arithmetical adjustments to the subjects' self-reported height were found to be good predictors: 77% of height and height minus 16 in (40.6 cm). The poorest predictor was axilla to heel in the supine position. Finally, two additional length estimates were derived using linear regression analyses. These estimates provided the best overall predictions based on actual height and reported height. A quick-reference table for crutch-length estimates based on patient heights was developed from these regression results.\r"

We will report on the effects of common exercise modalities on in vivo hip pressures. Four years prior to data collection, a pressure-instrumented Austin-Moore-type endoprosthesis was implanted in an otherwise healthy 73-year-old woman with a traumatic right hip fracture. Hip pressures during various experimental maneuvers were recorded periodically over a 5-year period. We compared measurements of peak pressure and rate of pressure rise obtained during gait with those obtained during isokinetic, isometric, and isotonic lower-limb exercises. Maximal exercise generated greater peak pressures than did gait, and tripling the angular velocity during exercise roughly tripled the rate of pressure rise. Torque production and resultant in vivo hip pressures varied directly during all experiments. Peak pressures and rate of pressure rise apparently can be controlled by varying the subject's exertion. The results reported are from a single subject; therefore, little generalizability is possible for these data. We suggest, however, that articular pressures may be important to rehabilitation planning; these data provide a direct insight into this potentially important exercise prescription consideration.\r"

Subjects ranging in age from 18 to 35 years (mean = 28.06, SD = 5.97) were assigned to one of three groups on the basis of type of knee condition. In group 1, which consisted of seven healthy control subjects with no history of knee pathology, both knees were tested. In group 2, which consisted of nine patients with unilateral PFP, only the painful knee was tested. In group 3, which consisted of the same nine patients who comprised group 2, only the nonpainful knee was tested. Nonnormalized and normalized VMO:VL IEMG ratios were computed for ascending stairs, descending stairs, submaximal isometric contraction, and maximal isometric contraction (nonnormalized only). A two-way analysis of variance for repeated measures indicated VMO:VL ratios for isotonic stair-climbing activities were significantly greater than VMO:VL ratios for isometric contractions. Nonnormalized VMO:VL ratios in group 1 were significantly greater than nonnormalized VMO:VL ratios in the other two groups. Patients with PFP may have abnormal VMO:VL activation patterns, and isotonic quadriceps femoris muscle exercise may elicit more favorable muscle activation patterns than isometric exercise for patients with PFP.\r"

The time course of H-reflex amplitude depression was used to assess postcontraction changes in motoneuron reflex excitability. Sixteen healthy female subjects performed voluntary isometric plantar-flexion contractions (65%-75% of maximal voluntary contraction) in a prone position. H-reflex stimulation began at a postcontraction delay of 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, or 5 seconds and continued every 10 seconds for 1 minute. Reflexes were depressed (mean = 67% decrease) by 0.05 second postcontraction, reached maximal depression (mean = 83.3% decrease) from 0.1 to 1 second postcontraction, recovered to 70% of control amplitudes (mean = 30% decrease) by 5 seconds postcontraction, and reached 90% control amplitudes (mean = 10% decrease) by 10.05 seconds postcontraction. The results indicate that proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation techniques (eg, hold-relax) purported to produce a phase of relaxation following voluntary contraction do appear to produce a strong, but brief, neuromuscular inhibition that may be clinically useful for applying stretch.\r"

It has been named the subgaleal fascia (SGF). The subgaleal fascia is a trilaminar structure with unusual potential in reconstructive surgery. Histologic study reveals the subgaleal fascia to be composed of a central dense collagenous layer surrounded by vascularized areolar tissue. It is readily dissected from surrounding galeal and periosteal layers. The subgaleal fascia was probably included in previously described \"pericranial flaps,\" which were often based beyond the periosteum. The blood supply of the subgaleal fascia originates from the proximal portion of the peripheral vessels of the scalp and continues within the areolar lamina. The subgaleal fascia is an exceptionally thin, malleable, and well-vascularized flap useful for facial reconstruction.\r"

The thin and malleable subgaleal fascia was selected for difficult reconstructive problems in seven patients. This flap has been based on either the supraorbital or the superficial temporal vascular leash. The subgaleal fascia is readily dissected from superficial galea and deep periosteum, leaving behind a well-vascularized scalp and a skin-graftable calvarium. The flap conforms to a cartilage framework for ear reconstruction. It takes a skin graft well. The subgaleal fascia can patch dural defects and fill sinus dead space. It has been used to augment facial contour. Free vascularized transfer of the subgaleal fascia has included the temporoparietal fascia, which was partially split from the subgaleal fascia for bilobed flap resurfacing of the hand. The subgaleal fascial flap should be considered when ultrathin, vascularized coverage is needed.\r"

Intraorbital fat was removed through a transpalpebral incision to achieve decompression. The average amount of fat was 6.0 cm3. We have made a long-term follow-up (more than 6 months postoperatively) study of 57 patients who experienced 108 operations. The first results were published in September 1988. When we compared the results to a traditional decompression operation (with resection of one or two orbital walls), we found that the postoperative complication rate was significantly lower and that the success rate was much higher. Thus the range of indications for surgery may be much wider than previously considered. Patients who are about to lose their vision as well as those experiencing lesser symptoms can be much improved with this operation. At the beginning, before the technique was fully developed, complications such as supraorbital nerve palsy occurred.\r"

One of these patients had an orbital floor fracture. However, enophthalmos was present in three orbits in two patients with associated zygoma and floor fractures. Two patients had intracranial neurologic injuries, but no ocular injuries were seen. Patients underwent frontal craniotomy and removal of the supraorbital rim for exposure. The orbital roof was reconstructed with outer-table cranial bone grafts. Associated fractures were repaired. Mean follow-up was 21.4 months. In all patients, the inferior dystopia, proptosis or enophthalmos, limitation of supraduction, and diplopia were corrected. In one patient, residual mild eyelid ptosis was seen. No residual neurologic or ocular injury was seen.\r"

This vessel originated in all cases just proximal or distal to the serratus branch of the thoracodorsal artery and arborized to the periosteum 6 to 9 cm from the bony branch of the circumflex scapular artery. In eight patients, scapular osteocutaneous flaps were raised preserving the angular branch and the circumflex scapular artery and dissecting up to the subscapular vessels. In all cases, bone was independently perfused by the angular branch. In all six cases where the angular branch was the sole supply to bone, technetium-99m scans demonstrated perfusion. Addition of this vascular pedicle to scapula bone allows two separate bone flaps with one microanastomosis and provides a longer arc of rotation between skin supplied by the circumflex scapular artery and bone. Donor-site morbidity was no greater than with the standard scapula flap.\r"

Our previous work to develop textured-surface breast prostheses has led to the development of micronized, inert, biphasic copolymer particles that neither migrate nor become absorbed by the body. These particles are textured, of critical dimension, and, when mixed with a bioexcretable gel vehicle, can be implanted using a special blunt-tipped cannula. Our experimentation in rabbit ears has shown that the bioexcretable gel component is rapidly phagocytized and is replaced by fibrin-like matrix within 3 days. The fibrin is then replaced by host collagen that gradually converts into a fibrotic encasement around each texturized particle. Clinical use of the substance in a variety of soft-tissue deficiencies has been generally effective, with only a few complications, when followed for 1 year.\r"

  ".W": "The assessment of implant capsular contracture has been imprecise and vulnerable to observer bias. Attempts to measure capsules with instruments that measure implant deformability are influenced by surrounding breast tissue, subcutaneous fat, and skin. Xeromammography, B-mode ultrasound, and CT were employed in an effort to provide a noninvasive and accurate method of capsule assessment. Through two study phases, implants were placed bilaterally in a total of 21 rabbits. At 4 months, animals underwent radiologic assessment and were then sacrificed for direct implant capsule measurements. Mammographic measurements, more than ultrasound-derived measurements, strongly correlated with laboratory measures of capsular dimensions and deformability. Cross-table lateral mammographic views were more informative than traditional views, providing measures of diameter and height that both strongly correlated with laboratory measurements. CT is theoretically the most accurate method to assess contracture, but it is impractical because of expense and time requirements. The results indicate that radiologic assessment, in particular by xeromammography, of implant capsules is accurate, practical, and noninvasive. Mammography strongly correlates with laboratory measures of implant capsular contracture and therefore could be used in the clinical setting to assess capsular contracture.\r"

Degenerative arthritic changes were seen in 87 percent of those with x-rays or a radiology report available. Most underwent surgical removal of the cyst and debridement of associated osteophytes of the distal interphalangeal joint. The cyst was located above the germinal matrix in all but two digits. Osteophytes were found in all 20 digits in which the joint was explored. No recurrences were seen in those available for postoperative follow-up (22 of 25). Normal nail growth was found in 14 of 22, although follow-up was short in one. All eight postoperative nail deformities were quite mild and of little concern to the patient. There was no correlation between preoperative cyst drainage and aesthetic postoperative nail growth. Nail removal at the time of surgery appeared to be unnecessary unless the nail was grossly disrupted.\r"

A transverse paraumbilical skin flap based on perforator vessels from the deep epigastric system was designed utilizing the tissue usually discarded following abdominal dermolipectomy. Within 3 hours of devascularization, a gassed (95% O2, 5% CO2), 37 degrees C Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing albumin (65 gm/liter) was pumped into the cannulated arterial pedicle of the skin flap and subsequently collected from the venous pedicle. Vascular resistance was continuously monitored and remained stable throughout the 4-hour perfusion. Lactate release was maintained throughout perfusion and was markedly increased by addition of insulin to the perfusate. Addition of norepinephrine to the perfusate resulted in a significant (p less than 0.05) dose-response increase in vascular resistance, and acetylcholine significantly (p less than 0.05) attenuated resistance in flaps preconstricted with norepinephrine. The results of these studies indicate that the isolated perfused human skin flap remained metabolically active with functionally intact vascular endothelium and smooth muscle throughout the 4-hour perfusion. The availability of this technique will, for the first time, permit laboratory study of human skin-flap pathophysiology and pharmacology.\r"

Based on experimental work with rat skin-flap models, the enzyme xanthine oxidase (XO) has been proposed as a major source of free radicals responsible for tissue injury and flap necrosis. The presence of this enzyme is variable within different tissues of a specific species and between species. Xanthine oxidase levels in pig and human skin have not previously been reported. The activity of xanthine oxidase in the skin of rats (N = 16), pigs (N = 7), and humans (N = 8) was measured after varying intervals of ischemia and in the rat also following reperfusion. Control pig and human skin were found to contain minimal enzyme activity, almost 40 times less than that of the rat. In the rat, xanthine oxidase activity was stable throughout a prolonged period of ischemia, and a significant decrease in activity was found after 12 hours of reperfusion (p less than 0.05). In humans, xanthine oxidase activity was unaffected by ischemia time, and in the pig, it did not increase until 24 hours of ischemia (p less than 0.05). The potential sources of free radicals and the mechanism of action of xanthine oxidase and its inhibitor allopurinol in improving flap survival in different species are reviewed.\r"

We have reviewed the medical records of 20 patients at Duke University Medical Center with histologically proven gangliogliomas. These patients typically presented within the first three decades of life and their most common presenting symptom was seizures. Therapies included surgical resection, either partial or total, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy. Long-term follow-up was achieved by chart review and by telephone interview. Patients who underwent gross total resection alone seemed to fare the best when comparing all treatment groups, and we therefore recommend this as the main form of treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Although selective posterior rhizotomy has become an increasingly utilized surgical treatment for spasticity, the procedure is unstandardized and is performed differently at various medical centers. Most surgeons use some form of direct dorsal rootlet stimulation with intraoperative multichannel electromyographic response monitoring. Electrophysiological monitoring offers the theoretical advantage of identifying pathologic reflex circuits for interruption while preserving those pathways that are \"normal.\" However, the monitoring technique most commonly used has not been critically evaluated and, therefore, its value remains uncertain. In 22 selective posterior rhizotomy procedures performed for spastic cerebral palsy, the authors were unable to identify a single electromyographic response that could be called normal by presently accepted criteria. Dorsal rootlets were chosen for division on the basis of relative degrees of abnormality. Intraoperative electromyographic monitoring of a nonspastic patient produced tracings suggestive of spasticity by presently accepted criteria. These discrepancies suggest that current electrophysiological monitoring in selective posterior rhizotomy should be reevaluated.\r"

Rapid increase in hemispheric concentration of these substances was noted beginning shortly after trauma. This trend continued until they were about three to four times control levels by about 24 to 48 hours postinjury. In the spinal cord, however, there was an initial sharp reduction in regional concentrations 2 hours postinjury followed by a slow rise thereafter. By 48 hours postinjury, levels of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin of the cords of injured animals were still less than those of nontraumatized controls. This variation in the central nervous system bioaminergic response with the level of injury raises questions as to its precise role in neurological damage following mechanical insult.\r"

Frontal stabs (two cases) are accompanied by the least morbidity and mortality, while temporal stabs (four cases) are more commonly fatal. In transorbital stabs (two cases) carotid-cavernous fistulae resulted. Early recognition, administration of antitetanus serum and antibiotics, and debridement may minimize complications.\r"

A total of 24 (1.1%) patients had overt intestinal ischemia, documented by reoperation or endoscopic findings. Of these, colon ischemia occurred in 19 (0.9%) and small bowel ischemia developed in 5 (0.2%) patients. The incidence after elective operation for aneurysmal or occlusive disease did not differ, but patients with ruptured aneurysms and those undergoing reoperative procedures for total graft replacement were at higher risk. Preoperative angiography was most helpful in ascertaining risk. Ligation of a patent inferior mesenteric artery was the most common (74%) feature in patients with colon ischemia. With preexisting inferior mesenteric artery occlusion, impairment of collateral circulation was attributable to superior mesenteric artery disease, dissection or retractor injury, prior colon resection, or exclusion of hypogastric perfusion. Bloody diarrhea was the most frequent postoperative symptom and colonoscopy the most reliable means of diagnosis. One half of patients with colon ischemia required resection after late recognition of perforation. All cases of small bowel ischemia were related to superior mesenteric artery disease or injury or use of suprarenal clamping. The overall mortality rate was 25% but rose to 50% if bowel resection was required. Intestinal ischemia remains an infrequent but serious complication of aortic surgery. Despite a multifactorial cause, identification of patients at increased risk can lead to operative strategies to reduce its occurrence.\r"

Complete suppression of endogenous glucose production occurred at high physiologic insulin concentrations. With progressive insulin infusion, the rate of glucose disappearance increased to 3.6 +/- 1.2, 8.7 +/- 0.8, and 13.7 +/- 1.1 mg/kg/min in control subjects and 2.9 +/- 0.4, 5.3 +/- 0.3, and 10.9 +/- 0.9 mg/kg.min in patients, significantly different from that of control subjects (p less than 0.05) during the intermediate (high physiologic) insulin infusion. A comparable slight increase in arterial plasma lactate concentration was observed in both groups with progressive hyperinsulinemia. Baseline peripheral lactate flux was identical in patients (-272 +/- 56 nmol/100 gm.min) and in controls (-271 +/- 57 nmol/100 gm.min). Progressive physiologic hyperinsulinemia resulted in significantly (p less than 0.05) augmented peripheral lactate efflux in patients (-824 +/- 181 nmol/100 gm.min) compared with control subjects (-287 +/- 64 nmol/100 gm.min). Supraphysiologic insulin abolished this increased lactate efflux in patients. Postabsorptive rates of endogenous glucose appearance in weight-losing patients with cancer were elevated, but complete suppression was achieved with insulin concentrations in the physiologic range. Total body glucose use was diminished in these patients, consistent with a state of insulin resistance. This impaired insulin action on peripheral glucose use was associated with an increase in peripheral lactate release in patients.\r"

  ".W": "The role of glucocorticoids in muscle catabolism during sepsis was tested with the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU 38486. Sepsis was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats (40 to 60 gm) by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Other animals underwent sham operation. Two hours before CLP or sham operation, rats received RU 38486 (5 mg/kg) or a corresponding volume of vehicle by gavage. Sixteen hours after CLP or sham operation, protein synthesis rate was determined by measuring incorporation of 14C-phenylalanine into protein in incubated extensor digitorum longus muscles. Total and myofibrillar protein breakdown rates were determined by measuring net release of tyrosine and 3-methylhistidine, respectively. The protein synthesis rate was approximately 30% lower in rats with sepsis than in sham operated rats and was not affected by treatment with RU 38486. The total protein breakdown rate was increased by approximately 70% and myofibrillar protein degradation was increased more than fivefold in muscle from rats with sepsis. Treatment with RU 38486 resulted in a 28% reduction of total and a 44% reduction of myofibrillar protein breakdown in rats with sepsis but did not affect proteolysis in muscle from sham-operated animals. The results support a role of glucocorticoids in accelerated muscle proteolysis during sepsis. It is not clear whether glucocorticoids are the only required mediator or they interact with other substances to induce muscle protein breakdown during sepsis.\r"

In the past 6 years we adopted a systematic approach comprised of accurate delineation of disease in the liver and biliary tract by direct cholangiography, ultrasonography, and computed tomography; tailored surgical treatment according to the extent of involvement of the liver and biliary tract; access to the intrahepatic ducts through the left duct or round ligament approach when there was difficulty with common bile duct exposure; routine use of flexible choledochoscopy; and application of electrohydraulic lithotripsy for large and impacted stones. Complete stone clearance was achieved in 114 of 127 patients (89.8%). Of those patients who had incomplete stone clearance, only six cases (4.7%) were related to technical failure of postoperative choledochoscopy. The incidence of stone recurrence was 15.8%, the lowest rate so far reported. It was the same regardless of whether a biliary drainage procedure had been performed, but the treatment for recurrent stones was facilitated by previous hepaticocutaneous jejunostomy. Overall the surgical treatment required for stone recurrence was of a lesser magnitude than that in the past.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor and vascular resection was carried out in 27 patients with biliary and pancreatic cancer. Vascular resection included resection and reconstruction of the both the portal vein and hepatic artery in two of the patients. Portal vein resection only was carried out in 23 patients, and resection of the side wall and plasty of the portal vein was carried out in the other two patients. The technical limit of portal vein resection without graft was 4 cm in the hepatic hilus and 7 cm after total pancreatectomy or pancreatoduodenectomy without grafts. On temporary occlusion of the portal vein between resection and reconstruction, simple occlusion was sufficient if it occurred within 30 minutes. In occlusion of more than 30 minutes, simultaneous occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery is better to prevent congestion of the intestine. If occlusion of more than 60 minutes is anticipated, a bypass between the superior mesenteric vein and the femoral vein with Anthron tube is recommended. The postoperative course was uneventful in 20 of the 27 patients. Two patients died within 1 month after surgery. The mortality rate for this aggressive surgery was 8.4%. Minor complications such as hydrothorax, small bile leakage, and localized abscess were observed but soon subsided in five patients. Fourteen of 27 patients survived or are alive after more than 1 year, and 9 of 14 patients survived or are alive after 2 years. Forty-seven percent of the patients who had no lymph node metastasis or peritumor lymph node metastasis without cancerous invasion of the portal vein intima survived more than 2 years. The longest length of survival of a patient with nonfunctioning islet cell carcinoma of the pancreatic head was 5 years 9 months. The longest surviving patient with ductal cell carcinoma of the pancreas is still living after 4 years. This approach is recommended in certain patients with vascular involvement but without lymph node metastasis or those patients with only peritumor lymph node involvement. Frozen section of mesenteric and paraaortic nodes should be standard practice before this aggressive resection.\r"

Surgery was accompanied by a twofold increase of the basal rate of lipolysis and by a significant 50% elevation of the lipolytic effect of catecholamines. The actions of various agents that selectively stimulate lipolysis at different early or late steps in the cyclic adenosine monophosphate system beyond the adrenoreceptors were also increased about 50% after surgery (p less than 0.01). The properties of the beta-adrenoceptors were not altered by surgery, as assessed by radioligand binding and isoprenaline sensitivity. The antilipolytic properties of catecholamines (mediated by alpha 2-adrenoreceptors) were not influenced by cholecystectomy. Lipolysis was not altered in four subjects who had no surgery and who served as control subjects 24 hours after being given the same type of postoperative nutrition as patients who underwent cholecystectomy. We concluded that moderate surgical trauma is associated with increased lipolytic activity of fat cells. This is secondary to an enhanced ability of catecholamines to stimulate lipolysis because of a modification at the most distal steps in the cyclic adenosine monophosphate system, which may involve the protein kinase/hormone sensitive lipase complex.\r"

One consideration regarding the clinical usefulness of such therapy is whether transient inhibition of PMN adherence or function will impede host defense and increase susceptibility to infection and sepsis. We studied susceptibility to sepsis in New Zealand white rabbits with an appendiceal devascularization model to answer the question: Does inhibition of PMN adherence with the anti-CD18 MAb 60.3 increase morbidity and mortality rates in abdominal sepsis? Four treatment groups of 10 animals each were studied: group 1 (controls) received no treatment, group 2 received MAb 60.3, group 3 was given the antibiotic cefazolin alone, and group 4 received both cefazolin and MAb 60.3. PMN emigration into the peritoneum was inhibited significantly in MAb 60.3-treated animals (groups 2 and 4). There was no difference in weight loss, incidence of infectious complications, or mortality rates when MAb 60.3-treated animals were compared with untreated animals. These results demonstrate that transient inhibition of PMN adherence does not increase morbidity or mortality rates in this model of abdominal sepsis. These results suggest that if MAb 60.3 or similar antibodies are used to prevent PMN-mediated injury, they will not increase susceptibility to sepsis.\r"

As the fibroblasts proliferate, they encase and may obstruct important retroperitoneal structures. Medical therapy in the past has been ineffectual, and since the tumor usually cannot be resected, surgery consists of lysis or bypass of the involved structures. Tamoxifen is effective in the treatment of desmoid tumors, and we report its use in two patients with retroperitoneal fibrosis with excellent results. The simplicity and safety of this treatment make tamoxifen an attractive choice of therapy.\r"

In these patients the cytologic patterns in the pancreatic juice were compared with the histologic findings in the graft specimens. In five samples the diagnosis by cytologic studies was rejection. Acute rejection was confirmed in all the histologic specimens. In eight cytologic samples, graft pancreatitis was suspected because of the increased amounts of neutrophils, degenerating cells, epithelial cells, monocytes, and some macrophages, with or without necrotic tissue fragments. All eight histologic specimens showed findings characteristic of pancreatitis. In three cytologic samples, bacteria or fungi were observed. Histologic examination of these patients showed graft pancreatitis. In four patients the cytologic findings were normal. Graft histologic factors were normal in two instances. In one of these grafts there was graft pancreatitis, and in one graft chronic vascular rejection was seen. Our study shows that two different pathologic events occurring in the pancreatic graft (i.e., acute rejection and pancreatitis) are reflected by characteristic changes in pancreatic juice cytology.\r"

An attempt was made to simulate this model and initiate pancreatitis in the ex vivo isolated perfused canine pancreas. Control preparations gained minimal weight (mean 8.3 +/- 5.1 gm), demonstrated no edema accumulation, and did not develop hyperamylasemia (mean 1342 +/- 790 units) after 4 hours of perfusion. Electron microscopy after 4 hours of perfusion remained normal. Intraarterial cerulein infusion produced significant weight gain (mean 27.6 +/- 12.3 gm; p less than 0.001), edema formation, and marked hyperamylasemia (mean 26,838 +/- 21,341 units; p less than 0.001) after 4 hours of perfusion. During the 4-hour perfusion, electron microscopy of cerulein preparations demonstrated depletion of zymogen granules, condensing vacuole formation, and basolateral exocytosis. Pretreatment of cerulein preparations with the free radical scavengers superoxide dismutase and catalase and the iron chelator deferoxamine did not modify the pancreatitis. Continuous infusion of the nonpeptide cholecystokinin antagonist L364,718 reduced cerulein-induced weight gain (4.3 +/- 3.4 gm; p less than 0.001) and hyperamylasemia (9392 +/- 6718 units; p less than 0.05). We conclude that cerulein pancreatitis in the ex vivo isolated perfused canine pancreatic preparation is identical physiologically, biochemically, and morphologically with that seen in intact animals.\r"

In this study, mean arterial blood pressure, cardiac output, and transcutaneous and subcutaneous oxygen tensions (PtcO2 and PsqO2) were investigated during serial hemorrhage, as indicators of the degree of both hypovolemia and perfusion to specific tissues. Blood was removed in stages (10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 55%, 60%, and 65% of original volume) from anesthetized dogs. Injections of variously radiolabeled microspheres allowed assessment of blood flow at each stage of hemorrhage in bone, brain, colon, heart, kidney, liver, muscle, pancreas, skin, small intestine, spleen, stomach, and subcutaneous tissue. PsqO2 was correlated more highly with blood volume lost than was PtcO2. Furthermore PsqO2 was more sensitive to blood loss than was either cardiac output or PtcO2 and, also during the early loss (0% to 40%), was more sensitive than mean arterial pressure. Some organs (e.g., pancreas) appeared to lose considerable blood flow with only small loss of blood volume, but their blood flow then stabilized at a low level despite further hemorrhage. Other organs, notably the kidney, appeared to be relatively unaffected by substantial loss of blood volume (20% to 40%), after which, however, their blood flow quite abruptly became sensitive to further hypovolemia. This explains why blood flow-related performance of the kidney (e.g., urine volume) may not adequately predict a developing hazard or peripheral perfusion. Some indicators were found to be better indexes of blood flow in some organs than in others (e.g., cardiac output and PsqO2 correlated more closely with skin, spleen, and intestinal flows [and one another] than with vital organ flows).\r"

  ".W": "In vitro studies show that the cytoskeleton of the microvascular barrier moderates polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) diapedesis and the transport of macromolecules. This in vivo study tests indirectly whether the cytoskeleton of the pulmonary microvasculature responds similarly to agents known to reorganize the cytoskeleton to alter diapedesis and permeability in vitro. One of four agents, saline solution, cytochalasin B (which promotes actin microfilament disassembly), leukotriene (LT) B4 (PMN chemoattractant), or phalloidin (which promotes and stabilizes F-actin polymerization) was introduced into the bronchus of the anterior segment of the left lung of anesthetized rats (n = 152) through a tracheostomy and fine-bore cannula. Twenty minutes later, saline solution, cytochalasin B, LTB4, or phalloidin was similarly introduced. PMN accumulations (x 10(4) cells/ml), protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and lung wet/dry weight ratios were measured 3 hours later. When the initial and secondary treatments were saline solution, PMN accumulations were 3 +/- 1 cells/ml and the protein level was 274 +/- 48 micrograms/ml. Secondary treatment of the saline-treated group with cytochalasin B or LTB4 led to increases in PMN to 18 +/- 2 and 9 +/- 2 cells/ml and protein to 960 +/- 50 and 840 +/- 40 micrograms/ml (p less than 0.05); secondary treatment with phalloidin was similar to that with saline solution. With saline solution used for both treatments, the wet/dry ratio was 3.4 +/- 0.2. Primary saline solution and secondary treatments with either cytochalasin B or LTB4 led to a similar increase in wet/dry ratios to 3.9 +/- 0.1 (p less than 0.05), whereas phalloidin was without effect (3.5 +/- 0.3). Initial cytochalasin B treatment followed by LTB4 led to increased PMN diapedesis (43 +/- 6 cells/ml and wet/dry ratio 4.3 +/- 0.2) (p less than 0.05). Secondary phalloidin treatment attenuated the cytochalasin B effect with counts of 12 +/- 2 PMN/ml, protein levels of 460 +/- 30 micrograms/ml, and a lower wet/dry ratio of 3.7 +/- 0.1 (p less than 0.05). Even more striking, phalloidin as initial treatment further reduced the cytochalasin B effect to 7 +/- 1 PMN/ml, whereas protein level was 490 +/- 60 micrograms/ml and wet/dry ratio was 3.5 +/- 0.1 (p less than 0.05). Further, phalloidin, given initially, attenuated the effect of secondary treatment with LTB4, resulting in fewer cells (4 +/- 2 PMN/ml), a lower wet/dry ratio (3.4 +/- 0.1), and protein level of 650 +/- 20 micrograms/ml (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

At laparotomy a large omental hemangiopericytoma was excised, and no other evidence of disease was grossly evident. Eighteen months after initial laparotomy, the patient had widespread progression of the tumor and, despite chemotherapy, died 2 months later. A review of reported cases shows that abdominal discomfort (56%) and mass (35%) are the most common clinical characteristics of a primary omental tumor. Weight loss, ascites, and peritoneal implants usually indicate malignancy. Rare long-term follow-up prevents definitive conclusions regarding therapy and prognosis. At present, surgical excision alone appears to be the treatment of choice, with no demonstrable benefit from either chemotherapy or radiation.\r"

(2) The duodenum does not need to be dissected away from the aorta and, in fact, is not seen. (3) The left renal vein moves up off the neck of the aneurysm with forward mobilization of the kidney, facilitating proximal control. Now that the computerized tomography scan has become the preferred preoperative imaging technique for abdominal aortic aneurysms, the diagnosis of inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm can routinely be made before elective operation allowing the retroperitoneal approach to be selected.\r"

  ".W": "A patient with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) was found to have a solitary, extrapancreatic, extraintestinal gastrinoma in a peripancreatic lymph node. Preoperative studies did not show the location of the tumor. After excision of the gastrinoma the patient's fasting serum gastrin level dropped from preoperative levels of 596 pg/ml to 120 pg/ml (normal, less than 200 pg/ml). Fasting and stimulated gastrin levels have remained within the normal range at 18 months follow-up. This patient had previously undergone antrectomy, so it could not be determined if this tumor represented a primary lymph node gastrinoma or metastasis from an unrecognized tumor that may have been present in the resected stomach or duodenum. The outcome of this case confirms the previous reports that ZES can be controlled after resection of gastrinomas that were contained within abdominal lymph nodes, even if a primary enteropancreatic tumor is not found. Our results also support the use of an aggressive operative search aimed at eradication of the tumor in patients with ZES even if preoperative localization studies fail to identify the site of the gastrinoma.\r"

Both groups were similar with respect to age and gender. Surgical procedures were similar between groups (e.g., obstetric/gynecologic, renal transplant, colon, exploratory laparotomy, gastroduodenal, hernia repair). Postoperative infectious complications were more common in the CTN group (11.6 percent [9/77]) than in the CFX (7.8 percent [4/51]) group; however, this difference was not statistically significant. A higher incidence of wound infections was noted in the CTN group (5.2 percent [4/77]) than in the CFX group (2.0 percent [1/51]); this difference was also not significant. Patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy were more likely to develop infectious complications when CTN was used for prophylaxis (p = 0.0001). Clinically significant blood loss was not noted during surgery. Elevations in prothrombin times (greater than 1 sec) occurred in 27.3 percent (3/11) of CTN and 11.1 percent (1/9) of CFX patients (not significant). Except for the small subset of patients receiving concomitant immunosuppressive therapy, CTN appeared to be as safe and effective as CFX when used for surgical prophylaxis. Although not statistically significant, the increased incidence of wound infections in the CTN-treated patients requires further study in a prospective randomized comparison.\r"

However, published data on the stability and compatibility of these agents in various administration fluids and containers are few in number. Evidence of a significant decrease in stability as shown by high-performance liquid chromatography has been reported when bleomycin was infused in plastic containers for prolonged periods (over 24 hours) as compared with the same procedure with glass containers. Because administration of bleomycin is usually given as a continuous infusion, we undertook this study to determine whether the drug loss of stability that occurs in plastic containers results in a therapeutic loss of efficacy (cytotoxicity). By using a tumor stem-cell assay we compared the quantitative effects of bleomycin in plastic and glass containers on cell lethality. The results from our assay showed no significant difference in cell lethality by bleomycin from its aqueous solution stored in glass and plastic containers over the time periods observed. If these results had been statistically significant, the tumor stem-cell assay may have been shown to be a more sensitive means of determining the clinical significance of these stability studies.\r"

A prospective, blind, completely random before-after design was used, with observation, intervention, and postintervention periods, each lasting four months. The study group comprised 20 family practice residents, stratified by year of training and randomly assigned to treatment or control groups. Copies of all prescriptions written by participating residents were evaluated for prescription-writing errors. During the intervention phase, prescription copies with errors were returned to the treatment group residents with a tactful comment pointing out the error and suggesting changes. Over the three time periods, there was a continuous decline in the rate of prescription-writing errors in the treatment group, but not in the control group. A significant number of physicians who received the feedback improved their prescription writing (p less than 0.01), but logistic regression failed to show a difference attributable to the intervention. In conclusion, written feedback on copies of prescriptions produced a small decrease in the number of prescription-writing errors. Further, long-term study may show a magnified effect of this teaching method.\r"

  ".W": "We report a 63-year-old woman who developed theophylline toxicity on two separate occasions after the addition of ranitidine to her drug regimen. The first incident occurred during hospitalization, when the patient developed classical signs of theophylline toxicity (e.g., nausea, anxiousness, tremor, cardiac arrhythmias) within 48 hours after the addition of ranitidine to her drug regimen. Her theophylline concentration on the third day of overlap of these medications was 312.4 mumol/L while she was receiving sustained-release theophylline 300 mg q4h. A concentration obtained 14 days prior to admission was 115.5 mumol/L when she was receiving a comparable dosage of theophylline (300 mg five to six times a day, depending on the need for a nighttime dose). The second incident involved the unintentional rechallenge of the patient with oral ranitidine, on an outpatient basis, which again resulted in clinical theophylline toxicity with a rise in concentrations from 104.5 to 187.6 mumol/L. In both instances, the theophylline concentrations returned to expected values for this patient with the discontinuation of ranitidine. The rechallenge of this patient with ranitidine substantiated our initial suspicion that a ranitidine-theophylline drug interaction occurred in this patient. The possibility of such an interaction was further supported by other case reports in the literature. These case reports are contrary to controlled studies which show no evidence of a ranitidine-theophylline drug interaction. However, the number of subjects in such studies are small, and our case report and others suggest that this drug interaction may occur in select patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We report a case of C. freundii meningitis that was resistant to ampicillin and was successfully treated with ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin. A 13-day-old, full-term baby was admitted to the hospital with a one-day history of fever up to 38.8 degrees C. On admission the infant had a temperature of 39.2 degrees C, pulse of 140 beats/min, and a respiratory rate of 32 breaths/min. Except for a slightly bulging fontanelle, the rest of the physical examination was within normal limits. Complete blood count revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 12.5 x 10(9)/L, with 0.66 polymorphonuclear cells, 0.10 bands, 0.18 lymphocytes, and 0.06 monocytes. A stat lumbar puncture showed 10 WBCs per high-power field with gram-negative rods. Empiric therapy with ampicillin 225 mg q12h and gentamicin 11 mg q8h was started. Both antibiotics were discontinued after culture and sensitivity results were positive for C. freundii in the blood and spinal fluid. The patient was successfully treated with nine days of ceftriaxone 250 mg q12h.\r"

Its most common manifestation in patients with AIDS is retinitis which, if left untreated, invariably progresses to extensive retinal necrosis and ultimately to blindness. Ganciclovir sodium, currently the only licensed antiviral agent for the treatment of CMV retinitis, effectively controls this infection in a majority of AIDS patients, but significant granulocytopenia or thrombocytopenia related to ganciclovir therapy often limit its clinical application. Myelosuppression may be further exacerbated in AIDS patients by such other agents as zidovudine or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, often necessitating dosage reductions or discontinuation of these agents in patients receiving ganciclovir. Foscarnet sodium, a pyrophosphate analog active against both cytomegalovirus and the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV), may be an effective alternative to ganciclovir in the management of CMV retinitis. Trials with intravenous foscarnet in CMV retinitis have reported favorable results using initial daily doses of 180-230 mg/kg/d given as intermittent infusions every eight hours, followed by maintenance regimens of 60-90 mg/kg/d given as single daily one- or two-hour infusions. Foscarnet therapy may result in renal impairment, and indefinite intravenous maintenance therapy may be required to prevent recurrence of CMV infection. Despite these drawbacks, foscarnet's lack of major myelosuppressive toxicity, and its activity in suppressing HIV replication, make this a potentially safe and effective alternative agent for the management of CMV infection, especially in AIDS patients.\r"

Codeine addiction is uncommon in people who do not have existing vulnerability to addiction, including alcoholism. Codeine use can sustain addiction or increase the risk of relapse in patients afflicted with addiction. The risk of relapse must be considered when treating conditions such as pain or cough in a person recovering from addiction. Codeine use may be circumvented with the appropriate use of alternative treatments for pain or cough. If codeine use becomes necessary, cautious prescribing and reliance on the patient's recovery support network become imperative.\r"

They compete with acetylcholine and interfere with the transmission of nerve impulses resulting in skeletal muscle relaxation. Based on their mechanism of action, neuromuscular blocking agents are classified as either depolarizing or nondepolarizing. Succinylcholine is a short-acting depolarizing agent. Commonly used nondepolarizing agents are curare (long-acting), pancuronium (long-acting), atracurium (intermediate-acting), and vecuronium (intermediate-acting). Neuromuscular blocking agents are used clinically to facilitate endotracheal intubation and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery. This article provides an overview of the physiology of the neuromuscular transmission and summarizes our current knowledge on the use of these agents during general anesthesia.\r"

Results indicated that the total serum clearance of PA is similar to the adult value, but elimination half-lives of both PA and N-acetylprocainamide (NAPA) were slightly prolonged and volume of distribution was variable. Pharmacokinetic evaluations in a renally compromised neonate confirmed that total PA clearance and the renal clearance of both PA and NAPA were reduced, although not to the extent expected for the degree of renal impairment. Peritoneal dialysis was used concurrently and may have contributed to the elimination process. We believe that our experience provides important preliminary guidelines for the management of PA therapy in neonates.\r"

Numerous randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults and children have proven corticosteroids to be efficacious. Only the results from less rigorously designed trials have failed to show a beneficial effect. The onset of response, dose, and mode of administration have been relatively well defined; however, other aspects (i.e., duration of therapy, need to taper the dose, and risks of multiple short bursts) require further study. Early institution of corticosteroids in well-defined patient populations will decrease the need for hospitalizations. However, administration of corticosteroids to every patient presenting to the clinician's office or emergency room prior to aggressive bronchodilator therapy is unwarranted. All patients demonstrating an incomplete response or the inability to maintain a complete response following one to two hours of aggressive bronchodilator therapy should receive a course of corticosteroids. Courses as short as three to five days have proven efficacy in outpatients, whereas hospitalized patients usually are treated for seven to ten days. The duration of therapy depends on the individual rate of response.\r"

Psychotropic medications are classified into three categories: minor tranquilizers (i.e., anxiolytics and sedative-hypnotics), antidepressants, and antipsychotics. The prescribing patterns of psychiatrists, primary care clinicians, and all other physicians are compared. Differences in psychotropic prescribing patterns by psychiatric diagnosis are examined as well. The excessive use of minor tranquilizers, the continuing use of first-generation psychotropic medications (particularly minor tranquilizers), and the lack of concordance between diagnoses and prescribed psychotropic medications are discussed.\r"

The average number of drugs per prescription was 2.3 +/- 0.7 of which 86.5 percent of the prescriptions contained two to three drugs. In 53.7 percent of the prescriptions no duration for treatment was specific and 96.5 percent of the prescriptions did not indicate drug strength. The study showed that analgesics and vitamins were the two most common classes of drug prescriptions in the centers and that 18.6 percent of prescribed drugs were not from the allowed list of drugs. The causes of polypharmacy and noncompliance with the limited list are discussed with emphasis on the essential drug list as a method of rationalizing prescribing in primary healthcare.\r"

However, the natural history (origin and fate) of these lesions is not known. To examine this issue we studied 255 patients who had had two to four arteriograms within a mean interval of 2.6 +/- 1.7 years. Of 53 irregular lesions that had progressed on a later arteriogram, 35 (66%) originated from areas that were smooth and less than 50% in stenosis diameter. Of 44 irregular lesions on an earlier study, 10 (23%) became totally occluded, five (11%) progressed in severity (all remained irregular), 25 (57%) showed no change in severity (all remained irregular), and four (9%) regressed (two became smooth). Nine of the 10 lesions progressing to occlusion were greater than or equal to 95% stenosed on the earlier study. Only 2 of 44 lesions (5%) showed smoothing. These findings are in agreement with the concept that irregular lesions represent ruptured atherosclerotic plaques and demonstrate that they usually originate from mildly occlusive smooth plaques. Markedly narrowed irregular lesions (greater than or equal to 95% stenosis) frequently progress to occlusion. Irregular lesions less than 90% narrowed commonly remain angiographically stable, and irregular over several years. They were found rarely to evolve into smooth-walled plaques.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the rate and variability of atherostenosis progression in patients with coronary artery disease at baseline angiography, we used a simplified quantitative method of analysis to study single angiograms in 54 patients and paired angiograms in 29 patients. All discrete lesions were identified, then traced and digitized to determine lumen diameter (LD), and summed to give the total LD; the differences in LD for paired angiograms were summed to give total stenosis change (TSC). The following results were obtained: Correlation between LD measured by our method and LD determined by the Brown/Dodge method was excellent (r = 0.99, N = 54). There also was a high correlation between interobserver (r = 0.98, N = 54) and intraobserver (r = 0.99, N = 54) findings. Short-term TSC (N = 9, angiograms paired at less than 1 week) was negligible (0.03 +/- 0.38 mm). Long-term (N = 20, angiograms paired at 0.6 to 4.3 years) total LD differed significantly from baseline total LD (4.1 +/- 2.5 mm vs 6.0 +/- 3 mm; p less than 0.001), and TSC (2.0 +/- 1.3 mm) in long-term patients differed significantly from TSC in short-term patients (p less than 0.001). These results show that true coronary disease progression occurring over 1 to 4 years can be distinguished from intraobserver, interobserver, and interstudy variability by means of a simplified method and provide approximate rates and variability of progression. These results will be useful for power calculations in therapeutic trials aimed at slowing progression. Further prospective studies with the use of this method appear indicated.\r"

We investigated cardiac autonomic function by relating heart rate spectral components to clinical and angiographic findings in 80 patients who were undergoing coronary angiography. The age- and sex-adjusted magnitude of the respiratory spectral component, which is an index of cardiac vagal tone, showed a significant negative correlation with the extent of coronary atheromatosis (r = -0.43, p less than 0.0001) and a less significant negative correlation with the severity of coronary stenosis (r = -0.30, p = 0.0070). These relationships were independent of previous myocardial infarction and of left ventricular function. Stepwise regression analysis showed that the respiratory spectral component contributed to atheromatosis independently of established coronary risk factors (partial R2 = 9.4%, p = 0.002), but not to stenosis. Our results support the hypothesis that decreased cardiac vagal activity is associated with an increased risk of coronary atherosclerosis.\r"

In the cases with restenosis, the departure area, which had decreased in size after PTCA, showed an increase in size. After successful re-PTCA, the size of the departure area again became smaller. We concluded that BSPM, which is a simple, noninvasive, and inexpensive method, is useful in the evaluation of the clinical efficacy of PTCA and in the detection of restenosis after successful PTCA.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the frequency and significance of left ventricular wall motion abnormalities in patients without clinical evidence of myocardial infarction, we reviewed the two-dimensional echocardiograms of 252 patients who had no history or electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial infarction and who subsequently underwent coronary angiography. Seventy-seven patients (31%) had one or more segmental wall motion abnormalities. Sixty-six of the 77 patients (86%) had significant coronary artery disease (greater than or equal to 50% luminal diameter stenosis). Seventy-four percent of the patients with coronary artery disease had multivessel disease. The left ventricle was divided into anterior and posterior regions. In the 66 patients, there were 77 separate regions with wall motion abnormalities (49 hypokinesis, 22 akinesis, 6 dyskinesis), including 60 regions (78%) supplied by coronary vessels with greater than or equal to 70% stenosis. Thirty-two patients underwent coronary artery bypass surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Follow-up echocardiograms were obtained in 19 patients who had wall motion abnormalities involving 22 regions. Twenty of the 22 regions were revascularized. Wall motion improved in 17 of 20 regions (85%) and returned to normal in 15 regions (75%). We conclude that segmental wall motion abnormalities may be detected by echocardiography in up to one third of patients evaluated for suspected coronary artery disease without documented myocardial infarction. These abnormalities are associated with a high likelihood of multivessel disease as well as with significant narrowing of the artery supplying the region demonstrating abnormal wall motion. Improvement in segmental wall motion abnormalities after revascularization suggests that these areas represent regions of hibernating myocardium.\r"

Methylergonovine was administered continuously at a rate of 10 micrograms/min up to 50 micrograms. In all patients with variant angina, coronary spasm was provoked at a mean dose of 28 +/- 13 micrograms (mean +/- SD). In the control group neither ischemic ST change nor localized spasm occurred. The basal tone of the right coronary artery was significantly lower than that of the left coronary artery. The percentage of vasoconstriction of the right coronary artery was significantly higher than that of the left coronary artery. These results suggest that spasm provocation tests, which use an intracoronary injection of a relatively low dose of methylergonovine, have a high sensitivity in variant angina and the vasoreactivity of the right coronary artery may be greater than that of the other coronary arteries.\r"

Of these patients, 320 had untreated primary hypertension and 320, similar in age and gender distribution, were normotensive. In all patients coronary angiography documented that at least one major epicardial branch was restricted by 50% or more. Prevalence of single- and double-vessel disease in the fourth and fifth decades of life was similar in the two populations and in both tended to decline with age. Prevalence of triple-vessel disease was also similar in the two populations in the fourth and fifth decades; in either population it rose with age and reached a peak at the seventh decade of life. The percentages of hypertensive patients in the sixth and seventh decades with triple-vessel disease was significantly (p less than 0.01) greater (40% and 50%, respectively) than the corresponding values in normotensive individuals (25% and 31%, respectively). The left main coronary artery was not significantly more involved in the high blood pressure group. Pressure was moderately and similarly raised at any age in hypertension; serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels, blood glucose, and smoking habits were comparable in the two populations. These results suggest that hypertension does not accelerate the appearance of significant coronary narrowing or multiple vessel involvement. Starting from the sixth decade, the natural age-related evolution of coronary disease seems to be aggravated in hypertensive subjects, as reflected by an augmented number of diseased vessels. This process is probably related to high blood pressure in itself; whether the severity of hypertension might also exert an influence is not deducible from this study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "An impaired coronary vasodilator reserve has been demonstrated in all stages of hypertensive heart disease but is most likely in the setting of hypertrophy. The decrease in coronary flow reserve has, however, not been predictable previously. We postulated that flow reserve depression might be related to a left ventricular mass threshold. Seventy-two patients (82% with hypertension) with suspected ischemic heart disease who were found to be free of significant coronary artery disease at cardiac catheterization were evaluated utilizing the intracoronary Doppler catheter and two-dimensional directed M-mode echocardiography for determination of coronary flow reserve and left ventricular mass. For left ventricular mass indexed (LVMI) by body surface area (BSA) greater than or equal to 50% above normal using established gender-specific norms, American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) and PENN methods (correction of LV mass by regression equation agreeing with necropsy estimates of mass) predicted impairment of flow reserve (p = 0.005 and 0.009, respectively). Unindexed left ventricular mass and LVMI by height were not helpful in this regard. Using the ASE method for LV mass determination, coronary flow reserve was moderately depressed (2.4 +/- 1.0) for those with LVMI greater than or equal to 50% above normal; in comparison, flow reserve was normal (3.5 +/- 1.3) for those with LVMI less than 50% above normal. A rare patient was able to maintain a normal flow reserve when ASE- and Penn-indexed mass estimates were greater than or equal to 50% above normal, but only in the setting of a markedly elevated mean arterial pressure.\r"

In addition, in arterial hypertension several studies demonstrated an abnormal left ventricular filling. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships of the ECG signs of left atrial abnormality to atrial anatomy and left ventricular filling as evaluated by pulsed-wave (PW) Doppler in a group of patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. To this end, 53 untreated essential hypertensive patients (age 44 +/- 8 years; blood pressure 160.5 +/- 21.5/104.7 +/- 13.5 mm Hg) underwent a complete 12-lead ECG and a PW Doppler study of the transmitral flow velocities. The ECG criteria of left atrial abnormality were: P wave wider than 0.12 (or 0.10) second or higher than 0.25 mV in lead II; P wave/PR segment ratio (Macruz index) greater than 1.6 in lead II; and P wave terminal forces in lead V1 equal to or more negative than 0.04. Echocardiographic measurements were made according to American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) convention. Doppler parameters of left ventricular filling were measured as E and A peak velocity, A/E ratio, and the ratio between the velocity-time integral under the E peak and that of the whole diastolic flow, which represents the rapid filling fraction (RFF). At least one ECG sign of atrial abnormality was present in 34 patients (64%); the Macruz index gave the most common ECG index of atrial abnormality (31 patients).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Rates of loss of norepinephrine (NE) from the heart were considered to be proportional to NE secretion and to adrenergic function. In rat hearts, yohimbine induced almost identical increases in rates of loss of 3H-NE and of 125I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), a functional analog of NE. Clonidine induced decreases in rates of loss of 3H-NE that were also mimicked by those of 125I-MIBG. In the dog heart, pharmacologically-induced increases and decreases in rates of loss of 123I-MIBG could be measured externally; these values were similar to those obtained for 125I-MIBG in the rat heart. Thus acute changes in the adrenergic neuron activity can be measured in the living heart. The method is applicable to man in determining the capacity of the adrenergic system to respond to provocative challenges.\r"

The protocol used up to three extrastimuli delivered at two right ventricular sites during sinus rhythm and ventricular pacing at 100 and 150 beats/min and was repeated during infusion of 1 to 4 micrograms/min of isoproterenol. Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) was induced in 8 of 11 patients with spontaneous sustained VT, in none of 35 patients without significant ventricular arrhythmias during Holter monitoring, and in 9 of 56 patients with salvos of ventricular premature beats. Isoproterenol infusion facilitated the induction of two episodes of sustained VT in patients with spontaneous sustained VT; however, in all but one of the remaining patients, induction of ventricular tachyarrhythmias was not impaired. During the follow-up period there were eight sudden deaths among patients who initially had syncope, inducible sustained VT, or both and three episodes of sustained VT in patients who initially had nonsustained VT but inducible sustained VT. Isoproterenol infusion can be used to safely facilitate induction of ventricular tachyarrhythmias in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. The induction of sustained VT was associated with a poor prognosis.\r"

The maximum exercise heart rate was abnormally low in 6 of the 12 who underwent exercise testing. For the EPS tests, the corrected sinus node recovery time (CSNRT) was long in 8 of 14 and the sinoatrial conduction time (SACT) was long in six of the nine in whom it was calculable.

It also assesses the possible relationships between LPs and the severity of DMD, and the findings of two-dimensional echocardiography, as well as ventricular arrhythmias examined with the Holter system. SAECGs were performed with a Marquette MAC-1 unit. Based on Swinyard-Deaver's system of stages, ranging from the mildest, S1, to the most severe, S8, one patient each could be assigned to S2 and S4, 6 to S5, 20 to S6, 21 to S7, and 17 to S8. LPs were observed in 21 of the 66 patients (32%), including 3 of the 20 assigned to S6 (15%), 10 of the 21 in S7 (48%), and 8 of the 17 in S8 (47%). The total wall motion index evaluated by the method of Hegar was significantly greater in the patients with LPs (8.4 +/- 4.4) than in those without LPs (5.8 +/- 3.1) (p less than 0.05). The incidence of LPs was found to be higher in the dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) type (8 of 12;67%) than in the normal type (9 of 41;22%) (p less than 0.01). The incidence of ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) was significantly higher in patients with LPs (13 of 21;62%) than in those without LPs (13 of 45;29%) (p less than 0.05). No sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) was observed, although nonsustained VT was noted in three patients with LPs. The LPs in patients with DMD were thus associated with left ventricular dysfunction, and the presence of LPs might be correlated with the extent of myocardial derangement in DMD.\r"

The LV outflow tract (LVOT) peak velocity was recorded by continuous wave Doppler technique at rest and after amyl nitrite inhalation. The LVOT pressure gradient was calculated by the modified Bernoulli equation. A significant increase in heart rate and a drop in systolic blood pressure were observed in all patients after amyl nitrite inhalation; no adverse effects were encountered. The peak LVOT velocity and pressure gradient increased significantly after provocation in all patients, but the increase was much more pronounced in patients with HC (peak LVOT velocity increased from 2.2 +/- 0.8 to 4.3 +/- 1.0 m/sec and peak gradient increased from 22 +/- 17 to 78 +/- 36 mm Hg). The Doppler spectral signal in patients with HC demonstrated a characteristic contour, with peak velocity occurring in late systole. However, the observed increase in LVOT peak velocity was not statistically different between treated (with beta-blockers and calcium blockers) and untreated patients with HC. We conclude that LVOT peak velocity and pressure gradients in patients with HC can be readily assessed by Doppler echocardiography both at rest and after amyl nitrite inhalation. The dynamic changes in LVOT velocity induced by this provocation have certain characteristic features in obstructive HC but appear to be independent of the medical regimen used, at least in the dosages tested in our study.\r"
