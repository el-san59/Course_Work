In the United States we tend to look at minority-majority variations of health status, as well as the variations of many other indicators by race or ethnicity, because race and ethnicity are particularly important components of our society. In general, health status indicators of minority Americans are worse than those of whites. In some locales, death rates of minority Americans are comparable to those of Third World nations. At the same time, minority Americans make up a rapidly increasing proportion of the nation's population and work force. Our baseline national data on some minority groups, however, currently are inadequate to detect shifts in health status. Finally, the rapidly expanding problem of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome among some minority populations provides both an imperative and an opportunity to learn how model prevention programs should be designed and executed.\r"

A total of 54 FNABs of superficial masses were performed in children aged 1 month to 15 years. Adequate material for diagnosis was obtained in 50 attempts. The cytologic diagnosis increased clinical understanding and provided a guide for treatment in 46 of the 50 cases. The cytologic diagnosis was confirmed in 15 of 19 patients who underwent an operation. Surgical intervention was obviated in 31 patients. There was one false-positive diagnosis of cancer. We describe the role of FNAB in children and its technique, accuracy, and diagnostic problems.\r"

  ".U": "91344443\r", 
  ".W": "The most common toxicities of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are gastropathy, renal dysfunction, and liver function abnormalities. We outline an approach to monitoring patients on long-term NSAID therapy, focusing on the early detection of complications. Gastropathy caused by NSAID use is more common in elderly patients or those with a history of dyspepsia, peptic ulcer disease, or alcohol abuse. Fecal occult blood testing and hemograms are less accurate in detecting gastropathy than direct visualization but are convenient and relatively inexpensive. We recommend the periodic use of these tests to detect NSAID-induced acute or chronic blood loss. Renal toxicity is seen in patients with preexisting renal disease or functional volume depletion and in the elderly. Complications include renal insufficiency, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and protein-uria. Renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of NSAID therapy, especially in high-risk patients, with periodic testing thereafter. Hepatic toxicity is less common but warrants occasional determinations of alanine aminotransferase levels. Elderly patients and those with renal insufficiency or alcohol abuse have a higher risk of complications. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be used cautiously in those patients at high risk for complications. Strategies can be used to limit toxicity. Patients taking these drugs long term should be monitored periodically for signs of blood loss, renal dysfunction, and hepatic dysfunction.\r"

  ".U": "91344444\r", 
  ".W": "Many groups have taken the position that the digital rectal examination should be discontinued as part of the annual screening physical examination. We examined the effects of not doing a digital rectal examination on the early diagnosis of prostate cancer. The average time since a previous rectal examination increased as the stage of cancer increased. The digital rectal examination proved to be a relatively insensitive test, with 40% of stage D cancers being detected initially within 12 months of the most recent examination. Nevertheless, an annual digital rectal examination did detect a greater percentage of lower stage (and thus more localized and potentially curable) cancers when repeated within 12 months. When the last rectal examination was more than 24 months previous, cancers detected were more likely to be advanced. Without a digital rectal examination, patients would have their disease detected only by the presence of symptoms. When it was done because of symptoms, 81% of our patients had stage D cancers compared with 32% of stage B and 38% of stage C patients. Without the routine use of this examination, patients with prostate cancer would be more likely to have higher stage and less potentially curable lesions at the time of diagnosis. We conclude that the digital rectal examination remains an important part of routine annual physical examinations.\r"

Although several methods of palpation and percussion of the spleen have been described, until recently they have not been validated by noninvasive imaging techniques such as ultrasonography, radionuclide scanning, and computed tomography that offer objective means to assess splenomegaly. We review the literature comparing various physical examination techniques with noninvasive imaging modalities and conclude that palpation and percussion of the spleen are complementary but frequently insensitive and that further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of specific diagnostic methods.\r"

Age-related trabecular bone loss is characterized not simply by a global loss of bone but also by cortical porosity and loss of trabecular connections. Because bone strength depends on architectural as well as material properties, bone quantity alone cannot define fracture risk with precision. Traditional therapies for osteoporosis increase bone mass, and estrogen therapy, in particular, profoundly decreases fracture risk. The pharmacologic restoration of bone quantity and quality, however, remains elusive. Modern biotechnology offers the hope that progress may come about through the development of growth factors and other osteotropic compounds for clinical use.\r"

The mean duration of thyroid tenderness was 2.2 months and that of palpable thyroid lumps was 2.8 months. This time difference, sometimes lasting many months, left a painfree \"window\" during which the palpable hard residual mass of subacute thyroiditis may be confused with other thyroid problems, especially cancer.\r"

The study was a four-period crossover design where subjects were randomized to one of four treatment sequences at entry. Treatments A, B, and C included sucralfate 2 g q12h for five doses. For treatment A, the fifth dose sucralfate was administered concurrently with ciprofloxacin 750 mg. For treatment B, 750 mg of ciprofloxacin was administered two hours before the fifth dose of sucralfate. Treatment C consisted of ciprofloxacin 750 mg six hours before the fifth dose of sucralfate. A 750-mg dose of ciprofloxacin was administered alone for treatment D. Blood and urine samples were collected at predetermined time intervals for 24 hours. Ciprofloxacin concentrations were determined by HPLC. The area under the concentration versus time curve from zero to infinity and the urinary recovery of ciprofloxacin were used for determining relative bioavailability. Concurrent administration of ciprofloxacin and sucralfate (treatment A) resulted in a significant decrease (p less than 0.05) in ciprofloxacin absorption. The relative bioavailabilities for treatments A, B, and C were 0.0429 +/- 0.0202, 0.829 + 0.21, and 0.965 + 0.32, respectively, relative to ciprofloxacin alone. In normal volunteers, ciprofloxacin may be administered between two and six hours before sucralfate, allowing sufficient time for ciprofloxacin absorption prior to the sucralfate dose and thereby minimizing the chance of a significant interaction. In patients with decreased gastric emptying the interaction may be more difficult to avoid.\r"

Of the 90 evaluable patients who received fluconazole, 76 (84 percent) were asymptomatic seven to ten days after treatment compared with 84 of 95 (88 percent) treated with clotrimazole. An additional ten patients in the fluconazole group (11 percent) and seven in the clotrimazole group (7 percent) had improvement in their signs and symptoms. Only four patients in each group (4 percent) were considered treatment failures. Mycological cures were obtained in 89 and 93 percent of patients treated with fluconazole and clotrimazole, respectively, seven to ten days posttreatment. Clinical cure rates remained high one month posttreatment: 79 percent in the fluconazole group and 83 percent in the clotrimazole group. Both therapies were well tolerated. One patient discontinued treatment after she developed diarrhea while receiving fluconazole. The most common adverse effects associated with fluconazole use were nausea (six percent) and diarrhea (three percent). No clinically significant laboratory abnormalities were observed. In this investigation, oral fluconazole therapy was found to be as safe and effective as clotrimazole vaginal tablets in women with acute vulvovaginal candidiasis.\r"

Prior to this study, 17 of the patients had been receiving treatment with r-hGH administered via syringes and vials; their experiences with this conventional technique have been used for comparison with Nordiject. The injection pen is provided with a replaceable 27-gauge needle and a cartridge containing 24 IU of reconstituted r-hGH (12 IU/mL). A benzyl alcohol 0.9% solution is used as the solvent for the reconstitution. The pen can be regulated for doses from 0.5 to 8 IU per injection; regulation is accomplished by a turning movement. The patients had no problems with the dissolving procedure or handling the pen. Nearly two-thirds of the patients experienced less injection pain with the pen as compared with the syringe. Special attention was paid to local tolerability, which was reported to be good. The thigh was the preferred injection site. The residual contents from 68 cartridges returned by the patients were analyzed for microbial contamination. Contamination was detected in only one cartridge, which could not be confirmed in a repeated test. Because of the simplification of the injection procedure afforded by the injection pen, 20 of 27 patients were able to perform the injections themselves and hence assume a more active role in their treatment. The patients who previously had been using conventional syringes strongly preferred the pen, and all patients wished to continue using the device.\r"

Administration of aztreonam occasionally is associated with minimal and transient adverse effects. This case report describes a patient we believe experienced bone marrow suppression approximately ten days after aztreonam was given for treatment of pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This untoward effect primarily was manifested as neutropenia, although normochromic, normocytic anemia and thrombocytopenia were noted as well. One week after aztreonam was discontinued, the patient's bone marrow suppression resolved spontaneously. Although the mechanism responsible for myelosuppression is unclear, aztreonam may be implicated as the offending agent based on the temporal relationship between the development of neutropenia and its administration, and the resolution of neutropenia upon its discontinuation.\r"

There was no biochemical evidence of congenital methemoglobinemia and no other regular drug use or chemical exposure was found. Moreover, clinical improvement and normalization of the methemoglobin level after the drug was discontinued is highly suggestive of flutamide-induced methemoglobinemia. Due to its chemical structure derived from anilide, flutamide may be considered as a potential methemoglobin-inducing agent.\r"

A review of the literature shows controversy over the efficacy of heparin following thrombolysis. Both beneficial and a lack of beneficial effects have been reported with heparin. From a pathophysiologic viewpoint, there appears to be a need for full heparinization in the postlytic period because the residual stenosis is highly thrombogenic. However, optimal dose, time, and mode of heparin therapy has not been defined. Despite a lack of definitive data, it seems reasonable to administer intravenous heparin immediately after thrombolytic therapy to achieve a partial thromboplastin time 1.5-2.0 times control that is concurrent with an antiplatelet agent such as aspirin. These recommendations are consistent with the consensus opinion of the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association.\r"

Research utilizing genetic engineering has led to the development of yeast-derived recombinant DNA (YDR) hepatitis vaccines--a significant advancement in the control and prevention of hepatitis B. The recombinant process allows production of unlimited quantities of vaccine at considerably lower cost and without the potential threat of blood-borne illness. Clinical trials in various high-risk populations have demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of YDR vaccines. However, questions regarding optimal regimen and the need for periodic revaccination remain unanswered. Persons at risk should be adequately vaccinated against hepatitis B.\r"

Intradermal vaccination, which has precedent in prophylaxis of other infectious diseases, has been investigated as a low-cost alternative to traditional intramuscular HBV vaccination. Results of open and comparative trials indicate similar seroconversion rates for intradermal and intramuscular HBV vaccination routes in healthy adults. However, antibody titers and, presumably, duration of antibody protection appear to be decreased with intradermal HBV vaccination. Limited data suggest that demographic factors such as age and gender may affect vaccine responsiveness to intradermal HBV vaccine. Adverse skin reactions are common but do not represent a deterrent to continued intradermal HBV vaccination. There is a need for large-scale prospective comparative trials to substantiate the value of intradermal HBV vaccination. Nevertheless, the potential economic and epidemiologic benefit of intradermal vaccination justifies continued investigation for prevention of HBV infection.\r"

There are also reports of multiple-dose activated charcoal (MDAC) increasing the clearance of phenytoin in adults. We describe our experience modeling phenytoin pharmacokinetics during therapy with MDAC in the treatment of two cases of acute phenytoin poisoning in children. After extensive attempts at modeling the serum phenytoin concentrations, simulations were performed to identify the possible consequences of MDAC administration. Phenytoin elimination was more rapid than was expected, based on previously reported phenytoin pharmacokinetic parameters. Moreover, the time to peak phenytoin concentration and time course of phenytoin intoxication appeared to be shorter than available reports of phenytoin intoxication treated with a single dose of activated charcoal. MDAC may prevent continued phenytoin absorption and increase phenytoin elimination rate via gastrointestinal dialysis. The effect of MDAC on the clearance of phenytoin can be described by a first-order elimination rate constant of approximately 0.02-0.04/h.\r"

We retrospectively analyzed 1084 treatments of a selected group of intramuscularly administered antibiotics that are usually considered restricted for use in hospitals. Five cephalosporins, four aminoglycosides, and one acylureidopenicillin were analyzed. The study was conducted in 47 primary health centers over six months. We reported the information on a special order form for parenteral prescriptions and evaluated the selection and the dosing interval of each antibiotic. Of the 1084 treatments, cefonicid was the antibiotic most frequently prescribed (61.3 percent), followed by tobramycin (15.3 percent), cefotaxime sodium (6.7 percent), amikacin (3.8 percent), cefuroxime (3.8 percent), mezlocillin (3.7 percent), netilmicin sulfate (3.7 percent), ceftizoxime sodium (0.8 percent), cefoxitin (0.5 percent), and streptomycin sulfate (0.4 percent). Based on our survey criteria, 59 percent of the 710 orders that indicated diagnosis had a correct or possibly correct indication; the remaining percentage was considered unnecessary therapy or poor drug choice. Of the 1050 orders that indicated a dosing interval, 75.4 percent showed an appropriate dosing interval. We assume that most of the infections treated in our ambulatory care site could be resolved with or without common antibiotics. In this study we obtained objective data of the use of ten RAs in order to determine if their use in ambulatory patients was justified. We observed that a small number of prescriptions agreed with the recommended criteria stated in this survey for use of these antibiotics in outpatient infections.\r"

Although controversial, balloon catheter extraction may be an acceptable alternative in selected cases of esophageal impaction. Intravenous glucagon is useful in relieving distal impaction.\r"

The degree of ischemic injury is determined by the severity of arterial compression and the interval between the onset of symptoms and surgical intervention. Torsion usually occurs at puberty, and an anatomic defect known as \"bell-clapper\" deformity is usually present. Typical symptoms include acute scrotal pain with associated nausea and vomiting. Up to one-half of patients report previous similar episodes. On examination, the testis is high-riding, tender, swollen and firm. Testicular scan or Doppler ultrasound examination can be helpful in distinguishing torsion from acute epididymitis. Prompt surgical treatment is indicated to reduce the torsion, and bilateral orchiopexy is performed to prevent recurrence. Exocrine function, as determined by semen analysis, is often abnormal after unilateral torsion.\r"

An association between human immunodeficiency virus infection and syphilis has been established. Primary syphilis is manifested by a clean, painless ulcer called a chancre. Secondary disease often presents with constitutional symptoms and a maculopapular rash. Most infants with congenital syphilis are born without signs of infection. Serologic testing for both nontreponemal and treponemal antibodies is essential for diagnosis. Penicillin is the treatment of choice for all stages of syphilis. Case reporting and treatment of sexual contacts are two aspects of this disease that warrant greater attention from physicians.\r"

Spread of infection between spaces depends on anatomic location. Most patients require hospitalization and intravenous antibiotic therapy. Because a deep space infection may be occult, a high index of suspicion is required for diagnosis. Early recognition is necessary to avoid tissue damage, bacteremia or airway compromise. The possibility of deep space infection should be considered in any patient who does not respond to the usual treatment of an abscessed tooth or tonsillitis. This type of infection also should be considered in a toxic patient who has a fever of unknown origin, with or without blood cultures that show anaerobic organisms. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is usually necessary to locate the infection and to detect suppuration that will be amenable to surgical exploration and drainage.\r"

Family physicians should be aware of several age-associated differences in the management and treatment of diabetes in older patients. For elderly patients, dietary modifications may include an increase in the percentage of carbohydrates and a decrease in the percentage of fat. For obese patients, dietary therapy should also emphasize a decrease in overall calories. Oral hypoglycemic agents are generally used as the initial drug therapy. Insulin therapy should be instituted when oral agents fail to reduce the blood glucose level, when the blood glucose level is very high and in other special circumstances. A careful choice of medications for other common problems associated with diabetes, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia and peripheral neuropathy, is also essential.\r"

These patients also demonstrated greater than or equal to 2 segments with nonreversible defects at 4-hour imaging and underwent late (18-to 72-hour) redistribution imaging. When the criterion of late reversibility was defined as greater than or equal to 1 segment with a 4-hour nonreversible defect demonstrating late reversibility, late reversibility was present in 36 (58%) of the 62 patients and in 88 (24%) of 368 SPECT segments. When the criterion of greater than or equal to 2 segments was used, late reversibility was found in 21 (34%) of the 62 patients and in 73 (20%) of the 368 segments. Of the 21 patients who had greater than or equal to 2 late reversible segments, 12 (57%) exhibited late reversibility in greater than or equal to 3 segments. The frequency of detected reversible defects increased from 32% by 4-hour imaging to 48% by combined 4-hour and late imaging (p less than 0.0001). The patients who demonstrated late reversibility could not be distinguished from those who had only late nonreversible defects by analysis of the clinical, exercise, and electrocardiographic (ECG) variables.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The procedure was elective for 28 patients, urgent for 19, and was considered as an emergency for 10. A total of 64 grafts were dilated that had been bypassed 58 +/- 48 months previously (range 2 to 184 months); lesions were located on the aortic anastomosis in 12 grafts, on the body in 38, and on the coronary anastomosis in 14. Technical success was 95.3% (61 of 64) per lesion; clinical success was 84.4% (54 of 64) per lesion and 82.5% (47 of 57) per patient. Thrombotic complications with images of a lacunar defect occurred in 11 grafts (17.2%). Predictive factors for these complications were: age of grafts 38.5% for greater than 60 month grafts versus 2.6% for less than 60 month grafts (p less than 0.01); site of lesion, body lesion 28.9% versus anastomosis none (p less than 0.01); type of lesion, concentric and short 6% versus other 29% (p less than 0.05); and recent fibrinolysis in 66% versus 10.6% (p less than 0.05). Long-term follow-up is available in the 47 successful patients and the three limited non-Q wave myocardial infarction patients. Two patients died at 13 and 17 months. Long-term angiographic follow-up is available in 45 of 48 patients or 94%. At the end of the study, 35 of 57 (61.4%) venous bypass grafts in 32 patients (64%) were patent after one or more percutaneous transluminal angioplasties.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The elderly patients included more women (43% versus 24%) and patients with unstable angina (73% versus 55%). PTCA was successful in 87% of lesions in group I and in 94% in group II (p less than 0.001). Only circumflex artery dilatation was less successful in group I (78% versus 91%, p less than 0.002). PTCA was successful in all lesions of at least one vessel in 89% of group I patients and in 94% of group II patients (p less than 0.06). Successful dilatation of all lesions was achieved in 77% of group I and in 85% of group II patients (p less than 0.05). Complication rates were similar for both groups. These data demonstrate a high rate of success and safety in elderly patients undergoing multilesion PTCA despite the presence of several risk factors (advanced age, female sex, unstable angina). The lower PTCA success rate in these patients compared with younger subjects is almost entirely attributable to reduced success for circumflex artery lesions.\r"

  ".W": "To determine functional and anatomic changes in the first 24 hours after coronary angioplasty, we studied at random 15 patients (9 men, mean age 60 years) who underwent coronary angioplasty of 16 coronary arteries. Quantitative coronary angiography and coronary flow reserve measurements from digitized coronary angiograms were performed before, immediately after, and 24 hours after coronary angioplasty. Calculated were the minimal luminal diameter, obstruction area, and percentage diameter stenosis from two preferably orthogonal projections. Prior myocardial infarction in the myocardial region of interest was present in four patients. Seven patients had multivessel disease. Collateral vessels supplying the compromised flow region were observed in three patients. Six patients had refractory unstable angina pectoris. After coronary angioplasty, angiographically visible dissection was noted in six patients, whereas side branch occlusion was observed in one. Minimal luminal diameter before, immediately after, and 24 hours after was 0.93 +/- 0.18 mm, 1.53 +/- 28 mm, and 1.53 +/- 0.21 mm, respectively; obstruction area was 0.70 +/- 0.26 mm2, 1.92 +/- 0.69 mm2, and 1.87 +/- 0.51 mm2, respectively; diameter stenosis was 60.4 +/- 8.0%, 36.8 +/- 11.4%, and 37.6 +/- 5.3%, respectively. The coronary flow reserve (lower limit of normal with this technique 3.4) was essentially the same before and immediately after coronary angioplasty (1.26 +/- 0.59 vs 1.30 +/- 0.42, p = NS) with a slight improvement to 1.78 +/- 0.90 (p less than 0.05) 1 day later. Coronary artery dimensions correlated poorly with coronary blood flow reserve before and after angioplasty.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Since the anatomy and physiology of swine coronary arteries closely resemble those of humans, the response to implantation of the Glanturco-Roubin, balloon-expandable, flexible stent was studied in this model. Additionally, the effect of aspirin, 1 mg/kg/day orally, on this response was evaluated. Eighteen Hanford minature swine underwent stenting of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Two died within 24 hours of stent implantation. The 16 survivors were put to death at 4 (n = 4), 11 (n = 4), 28 (n = 4), 56 (n = 3), and 180 (n = 1) days. Angiographically, reduction of stent lumen diameter of 0.1 to 1.3 mm was observed and was maximum at 11 days, with gradual improvement at subsequent time periods. Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and light microscopy showed early disruption of subjacent endothelium, and adherence of platelets to exposed subendothelium and stent wires. Microthrombi were readily apparent. At 11 days, intimal thickening, made up predominantly of smooth muscle cells with abundant extracellular matrix, was observed and covered the stent wires. At 28 days, regression of intimal thickening was apparent and a confluent endothelium with flow-directed orientation was seen. At 56 and 180 days, the luminal surface was smooth; intimal thickening averaged 525 microns over the stent wires and 55 microns away from the wires. Findings in aspirin-treated animals were similar to results in those that did not receive aspirin. Thus in this swine model, stent implantation results in a time-dependent and self-limited vascular response.\r"

The 101 patients displayed 411 episodes of ischemia, 312 (76%) of which were silent; a circadian rhythm was noted for the occurrence of total and silent ischemia. Thirty-eight percent of the ischemic episodes occurred between 6 AM and 12 noon, and total and silent ischemia were significantly more frequent during this period compared with the other three 6-hour periods (p less than 0.01); a lesser peak was noted in the evening. The effects of metoprolol and combined therapy with metoprolol and nifedipine on the circadian variation of ischemic activity were studied in two subgroups of patients in a random, double-blind study design (31 patients receiving metoprolol and 42 receiving combined therapy). During therapy with metoprolol the morning increase in ischemic activity was attenuated, and the highest frequency of ischemia was then noted in the evening (6 AM to 12 noon compared with 6 PM to 12 midnight; p less than 0.05). Combined therapy abolished the morning peak as did metoprolol monotherapy, but even the evening increase in ischemic activity was attenuated (p less than 0.05). The diurnal distribution of the mean heart rate at the onset of ischemia, when patients were off therapy, showed a morning increase similar to the increase in ischemic activity but no second peak in the evening.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (T1 and T2 relaxation times) and percent water content were determined to quantitate the amount of edema. There was a transmural increase of the T1 relaxation time of the central ischemic zone in groups I and II, although this increase was significantly greater in group II in both the subendocardium (group I = 707.8 +/- 12.5 msec, group II = 813.2 +/- 36.2 msec; p less than 0.01) and subepicardium (group I = 641.7 +/- 20.5 msec, group II = 760.5 +/- 34.7 msec; p less than 0.01). These increases were also observed in the T2 weighted relaxation time in the subendocardium (group I = 54.7 +/- 0.8 msec, group II = 78.7 +/- 6.3 msec; p less than 0.005) and subepicardium (group I = 54.0 +/- 1.4 msec, group II = 73.1 +/- 4.0 msec; p less than 0.001). Transmural differences were evident between the myocardial layers with increased T1 relaxation times (p less than 0.01) in the subendocardium in both groups. Similar increases were noted in the percent water content of the myocardium. Thus T1 and T2 relaxation times lengthened with an increase in myocardial water content following occlusion, and these relaxation times were augmented by reperfusion. We conclude that ischemia-induced edema occurs in a transmural distribution from subendocardium to subepicardium following occlusion, and this edema is further enhanced by reperfusion.\r"

Radionuclide angiography was performed before, 1 month after, and 6 to 12 months after CABG to evaluate regional wall motion. Exercise thallium-201 myocardial perfusion imaging was done before and 1 month after CABG to assess regional perfusion. Preoperative asynergy was observed in 108 segments, and 74 of them showed an improvement in wall motion 1 month after CABG (segment A). Sixty-six of these segments (89%) were associated with an improvement in perfusion. Eight segments that had not improved 1 month after CABG demonstrated a delayed recovery of wall motion 6 to 12 months after CABG (segment B). However, seven of eight segments (88%) already showed an improvement in perfusion 1 month after CABG. A total of 82 segments exhibited functional recovery after CABG and were considered hibernating segments. In the preoperative study segment B more frequently had areas of akinesis or dyskinesis than segment A (75% vs 34%, p less than 0.05). The mean percent thallium-201 uptake in segment B was lower than that in segment A (74% +/- 9% vs 83% +/- 8%, p less than 0.05). Functional recovery of hibernating myocardium usually coincided with an improvement in perfusion. However, delayed functional recovery after reperfusion was observed in some instances. Severe asynergy and severe thallium-201 defects were more frequently observed in these segments with delayed recovery. Hibernating myocardium might remain stunned during those recovery periods.\r"

We therefore assessed the efficacy of U74006F, a potent in vitro vitamin E-like inhibitor of lipid peroxidation, in limiting infarct size in a canine model of transient coronary artery occlusion. Twenty dogs underwent 2 hours of occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery and 6 hours of reperfusion. U74006F or saline solution was administered continuously from 1 hour of occlusion to the end of the experiment. U74006F blunted any increase in production of conjugated dienes (an index of lipid peroxidation) at both 30 minutes (1.73 +/- 0.16 mol/L x 10(-4) vs 2.62 +/- 0.22 in control dogs, p less than 0.05) and 6 hours (1.39 +/- 0.22 vs 2.06 +/- 0.18 in control dogs, p less than 0.05) after reperfusion. Furthermore, 6 hours after reflow vitamin E levels tended to be lower than baseline values in control dogs and higher than baseline values in dogs treated with U74006F. However, analysis of infarct size indicated no statistically significant difference between the two groups when expressed either as a percentage of the left ventricle (10.4 +/- 1.8% in U74006F vs 15.2 +/- 2.4% in control dogs) or as a percentage of the area at risk (33.0 +/- 5.5% in U74006F vs 37.8 +/- 4.5% in control dogs). Although U74006F appeared to be a potent in vivo inhibitor of lipid peroxidation, it failed to limit infarct size after 2 hours of occlusion and 6 hours of reperfusion in this canine model.\r"

Infarct size was similar in treated and control rats (25 +/- 13% versus 28 +/- 11%). Expansion grades and a quantitative index of expansion were similar for both groups. Infarct size and expansion index were significantly related, but linear regression lines were similar for treated and control rats.

With respect to the individuals without diabetes, patients with insulin-dependent diabetes were significantly more likely to have severe narrowings, to have them in all three major coronary arteries, and to have them in distal segments. Severe narrowing of multiple vessels was significantly more common in men than in women and in individuals with hypercholesterolemia. We conclude that the high risk of cardiovascular events observed in young patients with insulin-dependent diabetes is secondary to advanced atherosclerotic lesions in coronary arteries. Involvement of distal segments of coronary arteries make these patients frequently unsuitable for bypass grafts.\r"

  ".W": "Differentiation between primary and secondary (caused by acute myocardial infarction) ventricular fibrillation has important therapeutic and prognostic implications. The diagnosis of myocardial infarction is based on clinical, ECG, and creatine kinase MB isoenzyme (MBCK) activity. Enzymatic criteria might not be able to confirm the diagnosis of myocardial infarction after recent cardioversion. The routine use of electrophysiologic studies involving the induction and termination of ventricular dysrhythmias provides a setting in which enzyme release as a result of cardioversion alone can be examined. Therefore a systematic investigation of the magnitude and time course of creatine kinase (CK) and MBCK release was performed after termination of ventricular dysrhythmias in 57 patients undergoing electrophysiologic studies. Of patients requiring external cardioversion, only 50% had an elevation in CK and MBCK activity. Elevation when present corrected with the number of shocks and cumulative energy delivered. The magnitude of MBCK release exceeded 10% of the total CK activity in 9% of observations. Pace-termination of ventricular tachycardia did not result in enzyme release. Arrhythmia characteristics, coronary artery disease, and left ventricular function did not affect the magnitude of the time course of enzyme release. These data suggest that cardioversion with multiple shocks may result in a component of MBCK release, and thus a false positive diagnosis of primary acute myocardial infarction may be made by relying exclusively on the enzyme release pattern.\r"

Patients were studied before and immediately after, 10 minutes after, and 1 hour after defibrillation by the AICD using M-mode, two-dimensional, and pulsed Doppler echocardiography. Immediately after defibrillation, increases were found in the peak early filling velocity (70 +/- 10 cm/sec to 84 +/- 24 cm/sec, p less than 0.01), peak early-to-atrial filling velocity ratio (1.05 +/- 0.21 to 1.29 +/- 0.26, p less than 0.005), and maximum rate of diastolic chamber enlargement (82 +/- 26 mm/sec to 102 +/- 44 mm/sec, p less than 0.05).

However, long-term single-chamber pacing has a number of inherent problems that limit its usefulness. Although sensor-driven dual-chamber pacing largely obviates the problems inherent with single-chamber sensor-driven pacing, the physiologic benefit of dual-chamber sensor-driven pacing has not yet been demonstrated. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to compare exercise-induced cardiac output for patients with chronotropic incompetence, after programming their pacemakers to either a simulated sensor-driven single or simulated dual-chamber mode. Cardiac output was measured noninvasively at rest and peak exercise using standard Doppler-derived measurements, obtained in a blinded fashion. At rest the Doppler-derived resting VVI and DDD cardiac outputs were 4.49 +/- 0.3 L/min and 4.68 +/- 0.3 L/min, respectively. At peak exercise, the DDD cardiac output was 5.07 +/- 0.5 L/min, whereas the simulated activity VVI and DDD cardiac outputs were 6.33 +/- 0.6 L/min and 7.41 +/- 0.70 L/min, respectively. Analysis of variance showed that there was an overall significant difference in cardiac output from rest to peak exercise (p less than 0.001). However, only the simulated activity DDD cardiac output was significantly different from its respective control value (p less than 0.05). Thus this study shows for the first time that the addition of rate responsiveness to dual-chamber pacing results in a significant improvement in cardiac output for patients with chronotropic incompetence.\r"

  ".W": "Current antitachycardia systems are incapable of adequately distinguishing stable from unstable tachycardias. Previously, integration of a pressure sensor or an impedance sensor, together with electrogram analysis, has been investigated as an improved method of identifying unstable arrhythmias. A mixed venous oxygen saturation sensor was investigated for differentiating stable from unstable paced and induced tachycardias in 10 patients. During rapid pacing at 600, 500, 400, 350, 300, and 250 msec cycle lengths, mixed venous oxygen saturation decreased as cycle length decreased. For any given cycle length, rapid ventricular pacing tended to result in greater mixed venous oxygen desaturation compared with atrial pacing. Mixed venous oxygen saturation decreased similarly during induced ventricular tachycardias at cycle lengths greater than 230 msec. However, ventricular tachycardias at cycle lengths less than or equal to 230 msec and ventricular fibrillation had no effect on mixed venous oxygen saturation until after termination. Subsequently, a mixed venous oxygen saturation-tiered therapy algorithm (cycle length less than or equal to 230 msec = unstable; cycle length greater than 230 msec and MVO2 greater than or equal to 6% over 30 seconds = unstable) was developed and was tested retrospectively in 113 paced and induced tachyarrhythmias in these 10 patients for detecting unstable tachycardias (defined as a decrease from baseline systolic arterial pressure of greater than or equal to 50 mm Hg at 15 seconds). The mixed venous oxygen algorithm had 93% sensitivity and 96% specificity compared with rate-only (rate greater than or equal to 170 beats/min) detection with 93% sensitivity and 71% specificity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To study the age-related changes in WPW syndrome, we compared two separate groups of patients referred to this Medical Center for electrophysiologic studies because of a clinical presentation with significant arrhythmias. An elderly group of 42 patients aged 50 years or more were compared with a younger group of 51 patients aged 15 to 30 years. The groups were comparable in terms of clinical presentation, including the number of patients who had reported syncopal episodes and those requiring cardioversion of their tachyarrhythmias. Baseline electrophysiologic variables such as sinus rate; sinoatrial conduction time; corrected sinus node recovery time; AH interval; and effective refractory periods of the right atrium, atrioventricular (AV) node, and right ventricular muscle, were significantly greater in the elderly group. Similarly, the anterograde effective refractory period of the bypass tract, the shortest atrial pacing cycle length with 1:1 anterograde conduction via the bypass tract, retrograde effective refractory period of the bypass tract, the shortest ventricular pacing cycle length with 1:1 retrograde conduction via the bypass tract, the shortest consecutive preexcited R-R interval during atrial fibrillation, and the cycle length of orthodromic atrial ventricular reciprocating tachycardia were significantly greater in the elderly group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91344827\r", 
  ".W": "Syncope in the pediatric age group is a frequent event. Most often the cause is readily apparent--i.e., orthostatic hypotension or a vasovagal event. However, there are a large number of children with frequent recurrent unexplained syncope. Neither history, physical examination, nor standard testing reveals a cause. One hundred four consecutive patients were evaluated by orthostatic testing after standard methods found no cause for the recurrent syncope. Forty-seven (44%) of these 104 patients had syncope produced by orthostatic testing. Twenty-six of the 47 (55%) became syncopal within 5 minutes of testing initiation and 21 of the 47 (45%) after 5 to 11 minutes of testing. These patients had an average decrease of 81.5 mm Hg in blood pressure and a 25 beat/min decrease in heart rate. Of 12 control subjects, none lost consciousness with standing times as long as 14 minutes. Pacing was ineffective in preventing syncope, as two patients with a previously implanted normally functioning pacemaker had recurrent syncope clinically. Syncope was also induced by orthostatic testing, with the pacemaker showing a normal response with pacing as the patient became bradycardic. The syncopal event produced by orthostatic testing occurred with a downward blood pressure trend and a narrowing of the pulse pressure without a significant increase in heart rate. This was followed by a sudden drop in blood pressure and then by bradycardia. There is a group of children and adolescents with recurrent unexplained syncope due to abnormal orthostatic control mechanisms. Orthostatic testing appears helpful in identifying these patients.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-one patients with heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class II to IV) received a 24-hour infusion of enoximone followed by a 12-hour washout period. Patients were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups. Groups I to III received an 0.5 mg/kg bolus, followed by a maintenance infusion of 2.5, 5.0, or 10.0 micrograms/kg/min. Group IV patients received a maintenance infusion of 5.0 micrograms/kg/min without a loading dose. Serial assessment of hemodynamics, plasma levels of enoximone and enoximone sulfoxide, and ventricular ectopy were performed. Enoximone produced a clinically significant increase in cardiac index, and a decrease in mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure and systemic vascular resistance in all groups. Enoximone mildly increased heart rate, and had a minimal effect on mean arterial pressure. There was no statistically significant change in ventricular ectopy during the infusion. Significant hemodynamic improvement was noted at even the lowest infusion rate, and did not increase in linear fashion at higher infusion rates. In patients who did not receive an initial loading bolus of 0.5 mg/kg, the increase in cardiac index was delayed by approximately 1 hour. Plasma concentrations of both enoximone and its major metabolite continued to rise throughout the 24-hour infusion in group III (10.0 micrograms/kg/min), rather than reaching steady state as predicted by the terminal exponential half-lives of these compounds. This is suggestive of nonlinear pharmacokinetics and indicates a potential for excessive accumulation of enoximone and its metabolite during prolonged infusion. These findings may have important implications in guiding the intravenous administration of enoximone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

MR was detected in 57% of the patients and thrombi were present in 40%, but the occurrence of both MR and thrombus was rare (8%). Apical flow velocity was significantly higher throughout the cardiac cycle in the group with MR (diastole 15 +/- 7 vs 9 +/- 7 cm/sec; systole 29 +/- 12 vs 16 +/- 13 cm/sec; p less than 0.001 for both), accounting for the rarity of thrombi in this group. Follow-up data on 89% of the patients showed markedly decreased survival in the group with MR (22% vs 60% at 32 +/- 6 months, p less than 0.005), and this was evident even in patients with mild MR. Thus although MR is a noninvasively obtainable marker of a large subgroup of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy \"protected\" from left ventricular thrombus formation, it is a sensitive marker of decreased survival.\r"

Some recipient atrial activity was evident in 40% of patients at 2 weeks, but in only 16% at 1 year; donor atrial activity was normal in 90% to 94% of patients at all times. ECG intervals generally were normal and did not change over time. The most prevalent abnormality was the presence of incomplete (IRBBB) or complete right bundle branch block (RBBB) patterns (14% at 2 weeks, 16% at 1 month, and 22% at 1 year). In patients with hemodynamic measurements available approximately at the time of the ECG recording 1 year following transplantation, there was a significant correlation between the presence of IRBBB and RBBB patterns and somewhat higher levels of right atrial mean pressure (6.8 versus 3.9 mm Hg, p = 0.01), pulmonary artery systolic pressure (32.5 versus 24.5 mm Hg, p = 0.001) and diastolic pressure (16.2 versus 11.2 mm Hg, p = 0.004), and right ventricular systolic pressure (31.4 versus 26.9 mm Hg, p = 0.019) and pulmonary artery wedge mean pressure (11.3 versus 7.9 mm Hg, p = 0.010). Repolarization changes were also common but decreased in frequency over time (78% at 2 weeks to 34% at 1 year) and did not correlate with the presence or absence of rejection. We conclude that ECG abnormalities in heart transplant recipients are generally mild and that IRBBB and RBBB patterns correlate with increased right heart pressures.\r"

PMA and angiotensin II did not change the levels of cAMP but moderately decreased PCr/Cr. The decrease in systolic [Ca2+]i and amplitude of [Ca2+]i transients caused by PMA and angiotensin II resulted in depressed cardiac function. Hearts perfused with PMA and angiotensin II had a decreased sensitivity to extracellular calcium. Depressed developed pressure and oxygen consumption in the PMA- and angiotensin II-treated hearts may have been due to a decrease in amplitude of effective [Ca2+]i transients, because the [Ca2+]i threshold for cross-bridge interaction was presumably higher than the diastolic [Ca2+]i in these hearts.\r"

Debris suspension from normal aorta induced maximal aggregation of 35 +/- 12%, but the debris from atheromatous aorta surprisingly had no effect on platelet aggregation. The debris particle count was in the range of 10(10) to 10(12) per liter. Aspirin, 0.2 and 2.0 mmol/L, only weakly inhibited the debris-induced aggregation, and heparin up to 10 U/ml was ineffective. However, iloprost reduced aggregation to 40 +/- 11% of control at 0.3 ng/ml, and totally abolished it at 3 ng/ml. Soluble and particulate laser-generated debris from vascular tissue and thrombus may cause platelet aggregation in vitro. This may have implications for laser coronary angioplasty.\r"

Normal and atherosclerotic human aortas were irradiated by a 480 nm pulsed dye laser activated at 5 Hz. The laser was coupled with a single 0.2 mm fiber (Uni-guide) (40 mjoules/pulse) or a multifiber catheter (14 x 150 microns) (100 mjoules/pulse). Shock waves were measured using a fluid-filled catheter connected to a strain gauge manometer. With the Uni-guide, pulse-dye lasing resulted in greater ablation of atheroma in blood (11.6 x 10(-3) mm3/joule, p less than 0.001 versus atheroma measured in saline and normal tissue in blood) followed by normal tissue in blood (2.5 x 10(-3)mm3/joule), atheroma in saline (1.71 x 10(-3)mm3/joule, p less than 0.05 versus normal tissue in saline), and normal tissue in saline (0.54 x 10(-3) mm3/joule). With the multifiber catheter, laser ablation was the greatest in atheroma in blood (0.55 +/- 0.26 mm3/joule p less than 0.001 versus atheroma in saline and normal tissue in blood), followed by normal tissue in blood (0.27 +/- 0.12 mm3/joule), atheroma in saline (0.14 +/- 0.15 mm3/joule, p less than 0.001 versus normal tissue in saline), and normal tissue in saline (0 mm3/joule).

Previous correlations of ECG P wave morphologies associated with LA enlargement and echocardiography have been limited by the use of small numbers of patients and by the employment of M-mode echocardiography without the benefit of two-dimensional guidance. The purpose of this study was to further examine the sensitivity and specificity of various P wave morphologies (P wave greater than or equal to 110 msec, notched P greater than or equal to 40 msec, and PTFV1 greater than or equal to 40 msec.mm) for the diagnosis of LA enlargement and to determine if these waveforms may be predictive of LA size. ECGs and surface echocardiograms obtained within 1 week of each other were evaluated in 551 patients (140 normal and 411 study subjects). The various P wave morphologies were found to be poorly sensitive (30% to 60%) but very specific (90%) for LA enlargement. Combinations of P wave morphologies did not improve sensitivity or specificity. ECG features did give an estimate of the degree of LA enlargement. When PTFV1 is greater than or equal to 40 msec.mm, 95% of patients had LA size greater than or equal to 40 mm; and when this parameter was greater than or equal to 60 msec.mm, 75% had LA size greater than or equal to 60 mm. These criteria for LA enlargement on the ECG are specific and predictive of the degree of LA enlargement measured by echocardiography.\r"

An additional six cases were mentioned in the literature but without any details. A prevalence rate of 1.4% among tricuspid atresia cases is estimated. All infants presented with symptoms of cyanosis and/or congestive heart failure within a few days to 2 months after birth and died shortly thereafter. Cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vascular markings on the chest x-ray film and left axis deviation with left ventricular hypertrophy on the ECG are usually present. Echocardiographic, catheterization, and angiocardiographic studies are helpful in documenting anatomic and physiologic features of this anomaly. Pathologically, the muscular type of tricuspid atresia, type I or II truncus arteriosus, a large subtruncal VSD, and a hypoplastic right ventricle are present. It is concluded that coexistence of tricuspid atresia and truncus arteriosus is rare; clinical, laboratory, and pathologic features are distinctive; the clinical presentation early in life with rapid demise is common; and prompt palliative surgery immediately after recognition of this anomaly should be undertaken.\r"

  ".W": "Interventional cardiology has branched in two directions: devices that primarily dilate coronary stenoses and those that debulk coronary tissue. Presently the optimum coronary intervention has not been found. While patients are awaiting randomized trials, a comparison based on matched quantitative coronary analysis may be useful to evaluate results of new interventional techniques. Therefore we compared 51 patients undergoing atherectomy with individually matched patients who were undergoing balloon angioplasty and stenting. The lesions were matched according to location of stenosis and reference diameter. Atherectomy and stenting resulted in larger gains in minimal luminal diameter compared with conventional balloon angioplasty. The minimal luminal diameter was increased from 1.2 +/- 0.4 mm to 2.6 +/- 0.4 mm in the atherectomy group and from 1.2 +/- 0.3 mm to 1.9 +/- 0.4 mm in the angioplasty group (p less than 0.00001). Atherectomy and stenting resulted in similar gains in minimum luminal diameter (1.4 mm vs 1.3 mm, p = NS). In addition, atherectomy and stenting appear to be more effective in resisting elastic recoil because of tissue removal and an intrinsic dilating effect, respectively. In matched populations directional atherectomy and stenting appear to be more effective intracoronary interventional devices than balloon angioplasty based on the immediate results. However, atherectomy is limited in smaller coronary vessels because of its larger size.\r"

The majority of these patients had had operative repair of congenital cardiac defects and had both bradycardia and tachycardia. Pacemakers were usually implanted by the transvenous technique using bipolar leads. In each patient it was possible to find a tachycardia termination algorithm that successfully converted the tachycardia. In some patients very complex algorithms were necessary. In each patient it was also possible to find an algorithm that successfully differentiated the abnormal tachycardia from sinus tachycardia. Twelve patients required no antiarrhythmic drugs after pacemaker implantation, while 10 patients required one drug and one patient required two drugs. Eight of 23 patients had symptomatic tachycardias that required reprogramming the pacemaker to a different tachycardia termination sequence. Seven patients required reoperations, five for adapter problems and two for infection or erosion. Cardiac function improved in 15 of the 23 patients. Antitachycardia pacing is a viable option for management of tachycardias in children and young adults.\r"

In parallel, the vascular resistance increases because of vascular hypertrophy. In addition, in hypertension the alpha-adrenergic responsiveness is enhanced. Aging and hypertension are also associated with an increase in plasma cholesterol and insulin values. These alterations in cholesterol and insulin levels become particularly pronounced in middle-aged patients with hypertension. alpha-Adrenergic-blocking agents have a positive effect on lipids and insulin resistance. The shift toward enhanced alpha-adrenergic responsiveness, and the fact that vasodilators do not diminish exercise performance favor the use of alpha-blockers as a first drug in middle-aged patients with hypertension. Blood pressure lowering still remains the paramount goal, and these compounds should be used only if proved to be efficacious in a given individual patient.\r"

  ".W": "Terazosin, a selective alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist, was administered intravenously to 10 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization to determine its short-term hemodynamic effects. Hemodynamic measurements were performed before and 30 minutes after three doses of the drug: 1, 1, and 3 mg. One milligram of terazosin reduced the blood pressure (systolic/diastolic, mean) from a mean of 152.0/86.3, 110.7 mm Hg by -24.3/-9.4, -15.3 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). In the five patients who received 5 mg of the drug, blood pressure declined in a dose-dependent manner by -21.8/-3.8, -11.6 mm Hg after 1 mg, and by -35.8/-14.8, -22.8 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) after all 5 mg of the drug. The changes in blood pressure paralleled the terazosin-induced decrease in systemic resistance. Similar changes were recorded for pulmonary artery and capillary wedge pressures and pulmonary vascular resistance. The greatest hemodynamic response was noted with the first drug dose; succeeding doses had a progressively diminished incremental effect. Cardiac output, heart rate, and maximum left ventricular dp/dt demonstrated little change, whereas left ventricular end-diastolic pressure decreased after all three doses, reaching significance after 2 mg (-3.4 +/- 0.9 mm Hg, p less than 0.05), and left ventricular ejection fraction tended to increase (+5.6% +/- 2.4%, p less than 0.05 after 1 mg) and showed a dose dependence analogous to that of systemic resistance. Although not generally reaching statistical significance, indexes of aortic stiffness and compliance displayed a favorable effect. These data are consistent with terazosin's specific alpha 1-antagonism. Left ventricular performance is improved by afterload reduction, since terazosin demonstrated no direct effect on cardiac contractility.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this article the pharmacokinetics of terazosin are reviewed, and the incidence of adverse events in a dose-response study and a meta-analysis of 20 placebo-controlled trials involving a total of 1814 patients is presented. Peak plasma concentrations of terazosin are achieved 1 to 2 hours after oral administration. The relatively long half-life of terazosin (12 hours) enables it to be administered in a once-a-day regimen. Dose and plasma levels of terazosin show a linear relationship. Terazosin is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration. The pharmacokinetics of terazosin are not significantly affected by food, age, hypertension, or renal impairment. Adverse events after the administration of terazosin are usually minor and not age related. The incidence of syncope after therapeutic dosages of terazosin is minimal. Terazosin's effectiveness, combined with its pharmacokinetics, safety profile, and potentially favorable lipid effect, makes it a highly appropriate choice for antihypertensive therapy.\r"

The aim of this multicenter study, performed in 256 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension, was to define the dosing characteristics of terazosin (in the range of 1 to 80 mg) administered once daily. Patients were randomly assigned to placebo or active treatment groups; each group received 3 months of treatment, which comprised three ascending doses of terazosin, each administered for a 1-month period. As determined by conventional office measurements of supine diastolic blood pressure and by automated ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, there was a clear antihypertensive dose-response relationship for terazosin in the range of 1 to 5 mg daily. Except for the 80 mg dose, none of the doses above 5 mg (10 to 40 mg) appeared to provide additional efficacy. Both the office measurements and the monitoring data indicated that the ratio of trough (effect at the end of the dosing interval) to peak (maximum effect during the dosing interval) was at least 50% or greater during treatment with the 5 mg dose. Thus the 5 mg dose appeared to provide meaningful clinical antihypertensive efficacy and to sustain its effects throughout the full 24-hour period.\r"

  ".W": "Several antihypertensive agents have been found to influence serum lipid profiles. Thiazide diuretics increase total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels and slightly reduce high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Most beta-blockers substantially increase triglycerides and lower HDL cholesterol. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel antagonists, alpha- and beta-blockers, and beta-blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity are lipid neutral. alpha 1-Antagonists (e.g., terazosin and prazosin) lower total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels and improve total cholesterol/HDL ratios. Observational epidemiologic studies indicate that the lipid effects of antihypertensive agents are large enough to account for substantial differences in the predicted incidence of coronary heart disease. Combination therapy with the alpha 1-antagonist terazosin plus either thiazides or beta-blockers also ameliorates the adverse lipid effects of these agents used alone. A reasonable approach to managing the lipid problems often associated with hypertension is to advise a cholesterol-lowering, low-sodium diet and weight reduction and to select drugs that alone or in combination do not adversely affect lipid profiles.\r"

Compared with baseline values, long-term terazosin monotherapy or combination therapy resulted in consistent decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures, with a mean reduction in supine diastolic pressure of 12 to 14 mm Hg. The numbers of patients with controlled blood pressure at the last evaluable visit of each therapy period were as follows: terazosin alone, 106 of 245 (43%); terazosin with added diuretic, 70 of 112 (63%); diuretic with added terazosin, 47 of 88 (53%); and terazosin plus diuretic with added beta-blocker, 22 of 32 (69%). Most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. Only pain in extremities had a higher incidence during long-term treatment (6%, 181 to 360-day period) than during initial short-term treatment (5%, 1 to 90-day period). Three of six syncopal events occurred during the initial 180 days of treatment; this 0.8% (3/364) incidence was comparable with that reported previously for short-term studies. Only one case of syncope occurred during terazosin monotherapy. Terazosin was judged to be a safe and effective long-term medication for the treatment of hypertension.\r"

Results of a recent study examining the effects of combination terazosin and verapamil therapy on blood pressure and heart rate are also presented. In several studies of the combination of terazosin plus a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide, methyclothiazide, chlorthalidone, furosemide, amiloride, triamterene, metolazone, or spironolactone), significant decreases in one or more of the blood pressure variables studied were demonstrated (compared with diuretic plus placebo). In a placebo-controlled, double-blind study of terazosin plus atenolol, supine and standing blood pressures decreased significantly from baseline (atenolol monotherapy) after the addition of terazosin but not placebo. In a study of terazosin added to background therapy (including beta-blockers, diuretics, methyldopa, clonidine, captopril, guanethidine, hydralazine, and nifedipine), the addition of terazosin resulted in significant decreases in supine and standing diastolic blood pressures compared with baseline values (background therapy alone). Combination antihypertensive therapy with terazosin and verapamil reduced blood pressure to a significantly greater extent than either agent alone. Preliminary pharmacokinetic results indicate that terazosin did not alter the metabolism of verapamil. No significant abnormal laboratory test results have been reported for patients taking terazosin in combination with other antihypertensive agents; in fact some evidence suggests that terazosin may attenuate adverse lipid, glucose, and potassium changes associated with thiazide diuretics. Adverse experiences associated with terazosin combination therapy are usually mild to moderate. Results from all these studies suggest that terazosin effectively controls mild-to-moderate hypertension when it is used in combination with other antihypertensive agents without cumulative adverse effects.\r"

  ".W": "In this review, the relationship between hypertension and abnormal carbohydrate metabolism is explored. A review of the current literature reveals that people with hypertension are also likely to suffer from insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and hyperinsulinemia. Likewise, hypertension is prevalent in obese and diabetic patients. Deficiency of insulin at the cellular level may be a common mechanism in the development of hypertension in patients with type I or type II diabetes mellitus. Essential hypertension appears to be an insulin-resistant state. Insulin resistance may engender hypertension by increasing peripheral vascular resistance as well as by increasing salt retention at the level of the kidney. Therefore effective antihypertensive therapy should include agents that do not adversely affect carbohydrate metabolic abnormalities. Commonly used antihypertensive agents, such as thiazide, thiazide-like diuretics, and beta-blockers, are associated with glucose intolerance and increased insulin resistance. In contrast, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists, and peripheral alpha-blockers (such as prazosin and terazosin) do not adversely affect glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity. In addition, alpha-blockers have a positive effect on the serum lipid profile. The entire multifactorial cardiac risk profile must be considered when choosing therapeutic agents for conditions that have an impact on cardiovascular disease.\r"

  ".U": "91344865\r", 
  ".W": "Terazosin, a new selective alpha 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, has been found to be an effective antihypertensive agent. In a series of studies, the safety and efficacy of terazosin, alone and in combination with other antihypertensive agents, were evaluated in 1180 black patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Terazosin was effective in lowering blood pressure when administered alone (in dosages of 1 to 80 mg/day) and when prescribed (in dosages of 1 to 20 mg/day) in combination with other antihypertensive agents. In elderly black patients, terazosin, 1 to 10 mg daily, was as effective in lowering blood pressure as propranolol (40 to 120 mg twice daily). Changes (mean +/- SE) in sitting diastolic blood pressure from baseline were -8.1 +/- 1.4 mm Hg for terazosin and -5.0 +/- 1.5 mm Hg for propranolol. Terazosin (5 mg) combined with methyclothiazide (2.5 to 5 mg) produced a significantly greater (p less than 0.01) antihypertensive effect than that of terazosin alone. Changes (mean +/- SE) in standing diastolic blood pressure from baseline were -7.9 +/- 2.0 mm Hg for terazosin alone, -15.1 +/- 2.1 mm Hg for terazosin plus 2.5 mg of methyclothiazide, and -15.0 +/- 2.0 mm Hg for terazosin plus 5 mg of methyclothiazide. Terazosin had a favorable effect on serum lipid levels and appeared to compensate for the negative lipid effects associated with diuretics and beta-blockers when used in combination with these agents. Terazosin, alone and combined with other antihypertensive agents, was well tolerated with minimal side effects in black hypertensive patients.\r"

  ".W": "This study was performed to evaluate the presence of angina pectoris, electrocardiographic changes and reversible thallium-201 defects resulting from 2 different levels of exercise in 19 patients with known coronary artery disease and evidence of exercise-induced ischemia. The exercise protocols consisted of a symptom-limited incremental exercise test (Bruce protocol) followed within 3 to 14 days by a submaximal, steady-state exercise test performed at 70% of the maximal heart rate achieved during the Bruce protocol. The presence and time of onset of angina and electrocardiographic changes (greater than or equal to 0.1 mV ST-segment depression) as well as oxygen uptake, exercise duration and pressure-rate product were recorded. Thallium-201 (2.5 to 3.0 mCi) was injected during the last minute of exercise during both protocols, and the images were analyzed using both computer-assisted quantitation and visual interpretations. Incremental exercise resulted in anginal symptoms in 84% of patients, and electrocardiographic changes and reversible thallium-201 defects in all patients. In contrast, submaximal exercise produced anginal symptoms in only 26% (p less than 0.01) and electrocardiographic changes in only 47% (p less than 0.05), but resulted in thallium-201 defects in 89% of patients (p = not significant). The locations of the thallium-201 defects, when present, were not different between the 2 exercise protocols. These findings confirm the sequence of the ischemic cascade using 2 levels of exercise and demonstrate that the cascade theory is applicable during varying ischemic intensities in the same patient.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-two patients with known stable coronary artery disease, referred for coronary angiography, were examined with technetium-99m-hexakis-2-methoxy-2-methylpropyl-isonitrile (MIBI) tomography combined with a high-dose dipyridamole infusion (0.7 mg/kg) and handgrip stress. MIBI tomography was unable to show coronary artery disease only in 2 patients, thus yielding a sensitivity figure of 95%. MIBI tomography correctly identified 27 (82%) of 33 stenotic lesions (greater than or equal to 50% diameter stenosis) of the left anterior descending artery, 17 (61%) of 28 of those of the left circumflex artery, and 28 (90%) of 31 of those of the right coronary artery. The overall vessel sensitivity was 78%. The computed lumen diameter stenoses were more advanced in cases detected than in those not detected with MIBI tomography: 87 +/- 14 vs 76 +/- 14% (p less than 0.01). The 50 to 69% stenoses did not show any tendency to produce less positive findings than those with greater than or equal to 70% stenoses. In the subgroup of 21 patients who also presented for thallium scintigraphy, the overall diseased vessel identification rate was 76% for thallium tomography and 83% for MIBI tomography (p = not significant). Minor noncardiac side effects related to the dipyridamole-handgrip test occurred only in 5% of 63 study sessions. A high-dose dipyridamole combined with isometric exercise is a safe stress method, and when used during scintigraphy, MIBI tomography is at least as efficient a tool as thallium tomography in detecting diseased vessel territories in patients in coronary artery disease.\r"

  ".W": "In a randomized trial of the effects on in-hospital mortality of intravenous urokinase plus heparin versus heparin alone, 2,531 patients with acute myocardial infarction in 89 coronary care units were enrolled for greater than 30 months. Patients admitted within 4 hours of the onset of pain were randomized to receive either intravenous urokinase (a bolus dose of 1 million U repeated after 60 minutes) plus heparin (a bolus dose of 10,000 U followed by 1,000 IU/hour for 48 hours) or heparin alone (infused at the same rate). Complete data were obtained in 2,201 patients (1,128 taking urokinase and 1,073 taking heparin). At 16 days, overall hospital mortality was 8% in the urokinase and 8.3% in the heparin group (p = not significant). Among patients with anterior infarction, mortality was 10.3% in the urokinase and 13.9% in the heparin group (p = 0.09; relative risk = 0.73). The incidence of major bleeding (urokinase 0.44%, heparin 0.37%) as well as the overall incidence of stroke (urokinase 0.35%, heparin 0.20%) was similar in the 2 groups. The rates of major in-hospital cardiac complications (reinfarction, postinfarction angina) were also similar.\r"

  ".W": "Patients undergoing peripheral vascular surgery are at increased risk of postoperative cardiac complications. To evaluate the role of dipyridamole echocardiography in predicting major cardiac events, 109 unselected patients undergoing elective peripheral vascular surgery were prospectively studied. Preoperative dipyridamole echocardiograms were interpreted by an echocardiographer unaware of all clinical data. Patients were followed up until hospital discharge by research physicians without knowledge of dipyridamole echocardiography results. Outcomes were classified using strict predefined criteria by reviewers unaware of other clinical and echocardiographic data. Of the 109 patients, 9 (8%) had positive studies defined as development of new regional wall motion abnormalities or worsening of preexistent wall motion abnormalities. Of these 9 patients, 7 had postoperative events, including 3 cardiac deaths, 1 nonfatal myocardial infarction, 2 with unstable angina, and 1 with pulmonary edema. Only 1 event occurred among the 100 patients with negative studies. The sensitivity and specificity of dipyridamole echocardiography for predicting cardiac events after vascular surgery were 88 and 98%, respectively; the positive and negative predictive values were 78 and 99%. The relative risk of having a cardiac event if dipyridamole echocardiography was abnormal was 78 (95% confidence interval, 11 to 564; p less than 0.0001). If these results are extended and confirmed by other investigators, preoperative dipyridamole echocardiography may be an important screening test for patients undergoing elective peripheral vascular surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Impairment of left ventricular function during controlled myocardial ischemia induced by coronary angioplasty has been reported from angiographic and echocardiographic studies. Ejection fraction, peak ejection, peak filling rates, and end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes were investigated before, during and after coronary occlusion on-line with a nonimaging scintillation probe. The study consisted of 18 patients (mean age 59 +/- 10 years) with coronary artery stenosis of greater than 70%. During balloon inflation of 60 seconds' duration, coronary occlusion pressure was 31.6 +/- 12 mm Hg. There was no significant change in heart rate. Delay between first and second dilatation was 109 +/- 63 seconds. Ejection fraction decreased from 53 +/- 16 to 40 +/- 12% (first dilatation, p less than 0.01) and to 39 +/- 14% (second dilatation, p less than 0.01) and recovered to 51 +/- 16% 5 minutes after the second dilatation. Peak ejection rate was significantly reduced during the first and second balloon inflations. Peak filling rate decreased from 2.5 +/- 0.8 to 2.0 +/- 0.7 end-diastolic volume.s-1 (first dilatation, p less than 0.01) and to 1.8 +/- 0.7 end-diastolic volume.s-1 (second dilatation, p less than 0.01) and remained reduced at 2.2 +/- 0.7 end-diastolic volume.s-1 (p = not significant) at 5 minutes after the second dilatation. End-systolic and end-diastolic volumes increased significantly during the first and second dilatations and returned to normal after dilatation. It is concluded that short, controlled myocardial ischemia during coronary angioplasty leads to a decrease in systolic and diastolic left ventricular function. Sequential dilatations do not further decrease function if a sufficient interval is kept.\r"

Results of amiodarone in 47 young patients for an average treatment duration of 12 months were examined. There were 21 male and 26 female patients (age range of 23 weeks gestation to 29 years). Patients were divided into 4 groups: group 1--electrocardiographic documented ventricular tachycardia (n = 7); group 2--syncope of unknown cause (n = 16); group 3--primary atrial tachycardia (n = 11); and group 4--supraventricular tachycardia (n = 13). Amiodarone was clinically useful in 32 (68%) patients. Amiodarone was considered effective as a sole antiarrhythmic agent in 21 (45%) patients. Treatment was ineffective but was continued in 11 (23%) patients; in 10 of these 11 patients amiodarone was adjuvant to other antiarrhythmic drugs. Amiodarone was considered ineffective and was withdrawn in 15 (32%) patients. No patient required cardiac pacemaker implant during therapy. Torsades de pointes and cardiac arrest occurred in 1 patient each after 9 and 14 days of therapy, respectively. Two patients underwent successful cardiac transplant after 2 and 14 months of amiodarone administration, respectively. Amiodarone was used as short-term treatment (less than 18 months) in 7 infants (age less than 18 months), and after cessation of treatment there was no recurrence of tachycardia for 4 to 24 months. Results of this study confirm reports of successful amiodarone use in pediatric patients with a variety of rhythm disturbances.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One catheter ablation procedure was performed in 10 patients, whereas 2 ablation sessions were necessary in 2 patients. Programmed ventricular stimulation was performed on 2 separate days (mean interval 19). There were 2 baseline studies, 1 several days before (\"baseline study I\") and the second at the beginning of the ablation procedure (\"baseline study II\") while the patient was awake and nonsedated. The third programmed stimulation study was done 15 to 30 minutes after administration of anesthesia with enflurane, oxygen and nitrous oxide (\"enflurane study\"). Rate of sinus rhythm, QRS duration, PQ interval and ventricular effective refractory period were unaltered, whereas QTc interval increased significantly after initiation of anesthesia. Before and after induction of general anesthesia, clinical VT was inducible in all patients. However, in 1 patient, induction of VT was only possible by pacing in the left ventricle after enflurane administration. Based on these data, it is concluded that general anesthesia with enflurane, oxygen and nitrous oxide has no marked influence on inducibility of clinical VTs. Therefore, this type of anesthesia may be useful for nonpharmacologic, ablative procedures requiring general anesthesia.\r"

In each subject, 117 chest leads were recorded and maps of the integral values of the QRST interval were calculated. A multipolar distribution of the values, a marker of gross electrical inequalities of repolarization, was found only in 4 patients. To detect minor regional disparities of ventricular recovery, all the ST-T waveforms were analyzed in each subject. The ST-T waves were represented by a discrete series of potential values. The \"similarity index\" was computed by applying a principal component analysis, which represents (in percent) to what extent 1 fundamental pattern of ST-T reproduces all the recorded waveforms. The mean value of the similarity index was significantly lower in patients with long QT syndrome than in control subjects (49 +/- 10 vs 77 +/- 8%, p less than 0.0001). A value less than 61% (corresponding to 2 standard deviations below the mean value for controls) was found in 35 of 40 patients and in only 1 control subject (sensitivity 87%, specificity 96%). Thus, the similarity index is a more sensitive marker than the multipolar distribution of QRST integral maps in revealing electrical disparities of the ventricular recovery times.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These dimensions were therefore studied in 48 human cadaver hearts. Mean distance from the coronary sinus orifice to the left margin of the posterior septal space was 2.3 +/- 0.4 cm and mean length of the left free wall was 5.0 +/- 1.0 cm. The posterior septal space at the level of the valve anuli extended a mean of 3.4 +/- 0.5 cm around the epicardium. The width of the posterior septum measured in the coronary sinus was related to heart weight and a combination of body weight and patient age (p less than 0.05). The probability of an accessory pathway being located in the left free wall or the posterior septum during catheter mapping was calculated for various distances from the coronary sinus orifice for adults of different ages and body weights. In adults, accessory pathways located in the proximal 1.5 cm of the coronary sinus are almost always in the posterior septum. Those located between 1.5 and 3 cm from the coronary sinus orifice may be in either the left free wall or the posterior septum, and those located greater than 3 cm from the coronary sinus orifice are almost invariably in the left free wall.\r"

Fourteen normal subjects aged 20 to 55 years were studied with baseline and placebo 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms performed 3 to 65 days apart to assess the reproducibility of the following time domain measures of cycle length variability: the standard deviation of all normal cycle intervals; mean normal cycle interval; mean day normal cycle interval; night/day difference in mean normal cycle interval; root-mean-square successive cycle interval difference; percentage of differences between adjacent normal cycle length intervals that are greater than 50 ms computed over the entire 24-hour electrocardiographic recording (proportion of adjacent intervals greater than 50 ms); and the frequency domain measures of high (0.15 to 40 Hz), low (0.003 to 0.15) and total (0.003 to 0.40) power. The mean and standard deviations of these measures were virtually identical between placebo and baseline measurements and within the studied time range. Variables strongly dependent on vagal tone (high-frequency, low-frequency and total power, root-mean-square successive difference, and percentage of differences between adjacent normal cycle intervals greater than 50 ms computed over the entire 24-hour electrocardiographic recording) were highly correlated (r greater than 0.8).

Patients were maintained on their standard therapy including diuretics, digoxin and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. The mean ejection fraction was 23 +/- 10%. Exercise time increased from baseline in all 4 groups. There was no significant difference observed between the placebo group and any of the treated groups with regard to exercise time, ejection fraction, frequency of ventricular premature complexes or ventricular tachycardia. When analyzed by intent to treat, the placebo mortality was 7% (3 of 44) and the imazodan mortality was 8% (8 of 103) (p = not significant). This study failed to demonstrate that imazodan provided any benefit in exercise performance when compared with placebo.\r"

It is uncertain, however, whether the increased technical demands of allograft AVR can be justified in emergency operations. This study reports 15 patients treated between 1987 and 1990 for acute bacterial or fungal endocarditis involving the aortic valve. Patients underwent emergency AVR because of severe congestive failure, overwhelming sepsis or cerebral emboli. Eight patients received prosthetic valves (group I: 4 mechanical, 4 porcine) and 7 received human allografts (group II: 5 aortic and 2 pulmonary). The groups were comparable in age (group I, 55 years; group II, 51 years), intravenous drug abuse (group I, 1; group II, 3), and previous AVR (group I, 3; group II, 2). One group I and 4 group II patients had septal abscesses. Additional procedures in group I included mitral valve replacement (2), tricuspid valve replacement (1) and aortic root replacement (1). Additional procedures in group II were mitral valve repair (1), root replacement (1), atrial septal defect closure (1) and aortocoronary bypass (1). Mean bypass times (group I, 189 minutes; group II, 204 minutes) and cross-clamp times (group I; 108 minutes; group II, 121 minutes) were similar. Operative deaths occurred in 4 of 8 group I and 1 of 7 group II patients. All surviving patients have been successfully followed (group I, 28 months; group II, 18 months). No group I patient has required reoperation. One group II patients required reoperation for recurrent infection affecting the allograft, and another group II patient died 10 months postoperatively from noncardiac causes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of the present study was to verify whether the electrocardiographic pattern of patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) might be useful in predicting measurements of left ventricular (LV) morphology. A total of 12 electrocardiographic criteria for LV enlargement were evaluated in 67 patients with IDC, aged 14 to 68 years (mean 48), and were correlated to LV wall thickness, volume and mass, as assessed at angiography (all patients) and echocardiography (50 patients). Linear regression analysis showed weak correlations between multiple electrocardiographic criteria and LV wall thickness, volume and mass. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that total 12-lead QRS amplitude, voltage criteria of Sokolow and Lyon, overshoot and U-wave inversion were the variables significantly related to LV wall thickness, as assessed by angiography (r = 0.55, p less than 0.005) and echocardiography (r = 0.43, p less than 0.025). The sum of T/R-wave ratios, the RV6/RV5 ratio and the Romhilt-Estes score were predictors of LV end-diastolic volume, as determined by angiography (r = 0.83, p less than 0.001) and echocardiography (r = 0.77, p less than 0.005). Total 12-lead QRS amplitude and the sum of T/R-wave ratios were the only independent predictors of LV mass, either angiographically (r = 0.81, p less than 0.001) or echocardiographically measured (r = 0.71, p less than 0.025). It is concluded that a single electrocardiographic criterion for prediction of LV morphology in patients with IDC is barely effective. Multiple electrocardiographic criteria should be utilized to better predict LV mass and distinguish reliably between LV wall thickening and dilatation.\r"

To determine if these abnormalities persist long term after successful therapy of PS, 19 patients were examined 8 +/- 3 years after PS therapy. At the time of follow-up Doppler examination, the PS gradient was 15 +/- 8 mm Hg. From the tricuspid valve inflow Doppler study, the following measurements were obtained at peak inspiration: peak velocities at rapid filling (peak E) and during atrial contraction (peak A), ratio of peak E to peak A velocities, RV peak filling rate normalized for stroke volume, deceleration time, the fraction of filling in the first 0.33 of diastole as well as under the E and A waves, and the ratio of E to A area. Data from PS follow-up patients were compared with our previously reported data from 12 age-related control subjects and 14 untreated patients with PS. Patients with PS who were followed up had higher peak E velocity (0.75 +/- 0.14 vs 0.59 +/- 0.21 m/s), lower peak A velocity (0.47 +/- 0.09 vs 0.64 +/- 0.28 m/s), higher E/A velocity ratio (1.65 +/- 0.33 vs 1.11 +/- 0.52), higher 0.33 area fraction (0.52 +/- 0.08 vs 0.34 +/- 0.14), lower A area fraction (0.29 +/- 0.06 vs 0.45 +/- 0.21) and higher E/A area ratio (2.48 +/- 0.82 vs 1.73 +/- 1.05) than PS patients without treatment (p less than 0.03). All Doppler indexes of the patients with PS who were followed up were the same as those of the control subjects except for the peak E velocity that was slightly higher (0.75 +/- 0.14 vs 0.63 +/- 0.11 m/s), the peak A velocity that was slightly higher (0.47 +/- 0.09 vs 0.38 +/- 0.09 m/s) and the E/A area ratio that was slightly lower (2.48 +/- 0.82 vs 3.50 +/- 1.25) (p less than 0.03). Thus, at long-term follow-up, all RV diastolic filling indexes in successfully treated patients with PS improved compared with the untreated patients and approached values found in normal subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Ninety-three healthy persons aged 11 to 91 years were studied to assess the factors influencing Doppler indexes of left ventricular (LV) diastolic filling. The effects of physical activity, alcohol consumption and smoking were tested in addition to those of age, sex, heart rate, body mass index, blood pressure, left atrial diameter, and LV end-diastolic diameter, wall thickness, mass and fractional shortening. The data were fitted stepwise into multiple linear regression models both in the total population and in 3 groups aged less than 40, 40 to 60 and greater than 60 years. In the total population, age explained 45 to 68% of the variation in the peak early and late diastolic velocities, their ratio, deceleration of the early velocity, atrial filling fraction and peak filling rate normalized to mitral stroke volume. With advancing age--and with increases in either body mass index, heart rate, diastolic blood pressure or LV mass--the indexes of early filling decreased, whereas with regular modest use of alcohol or regular aerobic exercise they increased (p less than 0.05 for all). In the middle-aged subjects, gender explained 32 to 57% of the variation in the peak atrial velocity, early to atrial peak velocity ratio and atrial filling fraction; the peak velocity ratio measured 1.4 +/- 0.3 (mean +/- standard deviation) in men vs 1.0 +/- 0.2 in women (p less than 0.001). In conclusion, many constitutional and physiologic factors and even life-style can influence the Doppler indexes of LV filling. This demonstrates the exquisite sensitivity of the method but indicates also that individual measurements must be interpreted with caution.\r"

To make informed preventive health decisions it is important to understand the interaction of genes and environment on LV mass. In both children and adults, weight is a strong correlate of LV mass. We hypothesized that genetic influences common to both of these variables could in part explain the strong relation between weight and LV mass in children. In a population of 341 twins (11 years old), these questions were asked: (1) How much of the total variance of LV mass is under genetic control? (2) After accounting for weight and weight adjusted for sexual maturity, how much of the remaining variance is genetic? (3) Of the total genetic variance, what proportion is specific for LV mass and what proportion is common to both weight and LV mass? (4) How much of the correlation between these 2 variables is explained by genes common to both LV mass and weight? Univariate genetic analyses documented that genes operating at different magnitudes in boys (63%) and girls (71%) explain a significant proportion of the variance of LV mass. After removing the effect of weight and sexual maturity by regression methods, genes remain an important influence. Bivariate genetic analyses confirmed that genes common to LV mass and weight significantly influence the covariation of these variables and that greater than 90% of the correlation of LV mass and weight is due to common genes.\r"

With use of a biplane Simpson's rule, LV end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume and EF were measured from cineangiograms, 2-dimensional echocardiograms and color Doppler examinations. The 2-dimensional echocardiographic and color Doppler measurements were obtained from apical 4-chamber and long-axis views. The color Doppler examinations were performed by placing the color sector over the left ventricle only. The velocity scale was set at the lowest possible Nyquist limit (less than 0.17 m/s), and the highest possible carrier frequency was used to obtain this limit. With these settings, all flow signals in the LV chamber were aliased so that the entire chamber was filled with mosaic color Doppler signals. Motion of the surrounding LV walls gave rise to nonaliased (pure red-blue) signals. With use of an off-line analysis system equipped with a color frame grabber, the border of the mosaic color flow area was traced to obtain volumes and EF. End-diastolic and end-systolic volumes measured with color Doppler correlated well with those measured from 2-dimensional echocardiography (r = 0.99, standard error of the estimate [SEE] = 11.9 ml; r = 0.99, SEE = 4.4 ml, respectively) and cineangiography (r = 0.92, SEE = 16.8 ml; r = 0.90, SEE = 9.9 ml, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although the day-to-day variation appears to contain a sizable random component, significant nonrandom components were detected in the observed variation of all but one subject. Up to 37% of the total variance observed for a subject could be explained by the long- and short-term patterns identified in food intake. Both the shape and the amplitude of these patterns were unique to the individual subject, suggesting that observed within-subject variance is a function of the particular combination of environmental and biological pressures on the individual's total food intake at any one time and of the methodological errors inherent in the estimation of this intake.\r"

An equation including the waist circumference and age could predict 74% of the variance in the amount of deep abdominal AT with an SEE of 29.6 cm2 (29.2% of the mean deep abdominal AT value), whereas another equation including the sagittal diameter, the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and age explained 76.6% of its variance with an SEE of 28.1 cm2 (27.7%). Equations excluding age as an independent variable were also developed. These results indicate that equations in which simple anthropometric measurements are used can provide further information in the assessment of the risk of cardiovascular disease in men. However, we must remember that our ability to predict the amount of deep abdominal AT from anthropometry is limited.\r"

Of the nutritional indicators only serum zinc concentrations were deficient. The 7-d food record accurately classified individuals by usual or habitual intake for all nutrients except cholesterol. Dietary predictors of nutritional status were explored by using multiple regression. Iron status was predicted by protein and vitamin C intake and protein status, by dietary zinc. Serum concentrations of folate, vitamin C, and zinc were positively correlated to the dietary intake of the respective nutrients. The 7-d record was sufficiently precise to describe the intake of this healthy elderly population and to demonstrate evidence of clear relationships of dietary intake to serum nutritional indicators.\r"

After underfeeding, aKi+ and Em decreased (P less than 0.025 and P less than 0.006, respectively) only in soleus muscle with restoration after refeeding, whereas [K+]i decreased in both muscles (P less than 0.005) and remained low after refeeding. K+ supplementation did not significantly change these indices or the ratio of free to total intracellular potassium (gamma Ki+). The data show that aKi+ behaves differently from [K+]i during malnutrition and that changes in aKi+ occur especially in slow-twitch fibers, suggesting that previously observed changes in TBK and muscle function are the result of fundamental alterations in muscle-cell energetics and membrane functions, not just mass.\r"

All subjects had sedentary full-time occupations and participated in strenuous leisure activities for 34 +/- 6 (SE) min/d.

There were significant relationships between TEE and both body fat-free mass (r = 0.732, P less than 0.005) and measured REE (r = 0.568, P less than 0.05). Measured TEE:REE values were significantly higher than the recommended energy requirement (1.98 +/- 0.09, compared with 1.55 or 1.67, P less than 0.005). These results are consistent with the suggestion that the current recommended energy intake for young adult men may underestimate total energy needs.\r"

This finding was not reproduced in the second experiment, which consisted of a 6-d inpatient study during which the subject was confined to a whole-body calorimeter for 5 d. Indeed, he lost weight when fed a controlled energy intake of 7950 kJ/d. Moreover, this experiment showed that direct and indirect calorimetry provided comparable energy-expenditure measurements during this period. Finally, when the subject was refed a controlled energy intake of 7950 kJ/d for 21 d, body weight and fat losses were observed. Therefore, these observations do not support the validity of the low energy intake that may be reported by people predisposed to obesity.\r"

Obesity was associated with increases in thigh-adipose (r = 0.75) and lean-tissue volumes (r = 0.52) and with reduced density of lean tissue (r = -0.73). The increased lean tissue in obesity was due to a nonadipose tissue component with a density below the normal range of muscle, an effect compounded by NIDDM, whereas normal-density muscle volume was unchanged.\r"

The results indicate that there is an inverse relationship between blood lead concentration in the range 0.14-1.92 mumol/L with stature.

Breast-milk production (738 +/- 47 g/d: mean +/- SE) was adequate to allow a normal rate of growth of their 2-mo-old babies (28.0 +/- 2.4 g/d). The combined 24-h EE (mother and child) was higher (8381 +/- 180 kJ/d. P less than 0.001) than that of NPNL women (6092 +/- 121 kJ/d). Two-thirds of this differences could be attributed to the child's EE and one-third to a greater spontaneous physical activity of lactating women. The energy retained by the child for growth in conjunction with the calorimetric measurements allowed the calculation of the extra energy requirements for lactation, which were found to be 2100 kJ/d. These results confirm the values of the current dietary recommendations for lactation, based on the energy cost of milk production.\r"

When compared with normal control subjects, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol absorption in these patients was better maintained than that of cholecalciferol. These data indicate that vitamin D malabsorption reflects the extent of distal small-bowel resection in Crohn's disease. Treatment with oral cholecalciferol is sufficient in those with small or moderate resections but oral 25-hydroxycholecalciferol supplementation may be preferred in those with a severe short-bowel syndrome.\r"

Consequently, these results suggest that a wider dietary choice can be made available to NIDDM patients without producing unwanted side effects.\r"

Although the percentage contribution of fat to total energy intake has decreased from 40% to 36%, there has been a reduction in monounsaturated fatty acid consumption and an increase in the consumption of saturated fatty acids whereas the consumption of polyunsaturates has not been altered. Exception for diminished physical activity, the prevalence of other risk factors (smoking, blood pressure, and body mass index) remained relatively stable over this period. These changes in the CHD risk-factor status of the Cretan urban population occurred over a period in which CHD mortality rates are reported to have increased.\r"

One hundred eighty-one men consumed a standard caffeinated coffee for 2 mo followed by randomization to continue caffeinated coffee (control), change to decaffeinated coffee or no coffee for 2 mo. Plasma low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein B concentrations increased significantly (0.12 +/- 0.65 mmol/L, P less than 0.025; 0.06 +/- 0.12 g/L, P less than 0.0004, respectively) in the group that changed to decaffeinated coffee. In a subgroup (n = 51), post-heparin lipoprotein lipase decreased significantly more (-270 mmol free fatty acids.L-1.h-1, P less than 0.003) in the decaffeinated-coffee group. Resting heart rate and blood pressure did not change significantly. Change from caffeinated to decaffeinated coffee increased plasma LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B whereas discontinuation of caffeinated coffee revealed no change. This finding suggests that a coffee component other than caffeine is responsible for the LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and lipase activity changes reported in this investigation.\r"

For the ThinPrep method, exfoliated cells were collected in suspension, gently dispersed, collected on a polycarbonate filter, and transferred to a glass slide. The ThinPrep method reduced the number of smears that lacked endocervical columnar cells by 24%. Significant improvement with the ThinPrep, versus the conventional method, also was found for detection of low-grade cervical intraepithelial lesions. Thus, the ThinPrep method improved specimen quality and reliability of cytologic detection of cervical neoplasia.\r"

Material was obtained from 55 patients with histologically proven thyroid diseases: 9 with papillary carcinoma, 5 with follicular carcinoma, 11 with follicular adenoma, 13 with adenomatous goiter, 8 with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and 9 with other benign conditions. Most tumor cells, follicular lumina in cell clusters, and intranuclear inclusions were strongly positive for DAP IV in all examples of papillary or follicular carcinoma. In contrast, only a few epithelial cells were labeled for DAP IV in follicular adenoma and adenomatous goiter. Some Hurthle cells in Hashimoto's thyroiditis also were positive for DAP IV. When a DAP IV scoring system based on the percentage of positive cells and staining intensity was used, all benign tissues except one (from a follicular adenoma) were found to have extremely low scores. These results indicate that staining for DAP IV activity is a simple but useful tool to aid in distinguishing benign from malignant thyroid neoplasms.\r"

Three separate tissue specimens from each resected tumor were divided equally for FCM analysis and histologic evaluation. FCM analysis also was performed on fine-needle aspirates (FNAs) from the center of the resected tumor. Histologically, there were 8 squamous carcinomas, 19 adenocarcinomas, and 1 large cell carcinoma. Twenty-three tumors (82%) were aneuploid, and 5 (18%) were diploid. The DNA index in aneuploid neoplasms ranged from 0.91 to 3.30 (mean, 1.64). All 5 diploid and 19 (83%) of the (23) aneuploid neoplasms manifested intratumoral DNA stability. Four (17%) of the aneuploid tumors showed regional DNA heterogeneity expressed as additional stemlines in at least one sample. The FNA yield was sufficient in 21 cases and inadequate for complete analysis in 7 cases. In general, good correlation between FNA and tissue analysis was obtained. However, in three of the aneuploid neoplasms, FNA materials did not reveal an additional nondominant stemline, as noted in the tissue specimens. The authors attribute this finding to a dilutional factor in the aspiration material. The authors conclude that most non-small cell lung carcinomas express DNA stability; FNA provides adequate cellular material for FCM in most cases.\r"

With the use of biotinylated probes to HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, and 33, three hybridization techniques were performed on the same paraffin-embedded tissue blocks selected from 13 cases of anal squamous cell carcinoma. HPV DNA was detected in 0%, 62%, and 85% of cases with the use of in situ hybridization with horseradish peroxidase, in situ hybridization with alkaline phosphatase, and dot blot hybridization, respectively. By dot blot hybridization, 69% had HPV 16/6 and 15% had HPV 6/11. An HPV DNA frequency range of 0-85% in the same group of tumors with the use of three hybridization techniques indicates the influential role of the method on HPV DNA prevalences. HPV DNA was identified regardless of patient gender or type of squamous cell carcinoma. The presence of HPV 16 in 82% of the positive cases in supportive evidence of the carcinogenic role of the HPV in anal squamous cell carcinoma.\r"

To further define the presence of BCA-225 in human carcinomas, the authors performed an immunohistochemical study, applying a commercially available monoclonal antibody to BCA-225 to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of 446 adenocarcinomas from a variety of sites. BCA-225 expression was found to be common in adenocarcinomas of the breast (98%), kidney (94%), ovary (80%), and lung (74%) but was infrequent in adenocarcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract (10-16%). Adenocarcinomas of the prostate, bile ducts, thyroid, endometrium, endocervix, and pancreas showed an intermediate frequency of BCA-225 expression (36-68%). Although rare tumor cells in three hepatocellular carcinomas showed reactivity for BCA-225, staining of more than 10% of the tumor cells was not seen in any of the 23 hepatocellular carcinomas that were studied. The authors conclude that BCA-225 is expressed commonly in human adenocarcinomas and that it is not a breast-specific antigen. Antibodies to BCA-225 may have utility in helping one to exclude hepatocellular carcinoma in certain clinical settings.\r"

The following histologic features were recorded: intestinal metaplasia, intramucosal cysts, ciliated gastric cells, and different types of pyloric cells (\"ordinary\"; with granular cytoplasm; with small cytoplasmic vacuoles; with large cytoplasmic vacuoles; or with homogeneous \"glassy\" cytoplasm). The percentage of specimens showing intestinal metaplasia was similar in those containing gastric ulcers (42.7%) or adenocarcinomas (50.0%). Intestinal metaplasia was decreased in men 59 years of age or older and in women 69 years of age or older. Diffuse-type adenocarcinoma accounted for 90% of the gastric tumors. Only 3 of the 205 specimens (1.9%) contained intramucosal cysts, and only 1 (0.4%) showed ciliated cells. Pyloric cells with granular cytoplasm were observed in 21.2% of the specimens, and pyloric cells with small cytoplasmic vacuoles were seen in 1.9%. Pyloric cells with large vacuoles or \"glassy\" cytoplasm were not found in any case. These results indicate differences in the proportions of several histopathologic findings in the gastric mucosa, between Mexicans and other ethnic groups that have been investigated in previous surveys. The authors' findings support the hypothesis that different environmental factors, acting in disparate geographic regions, may account for dissimilarities in the histologic appearance of \"normal gastric mucosa.\"\r"

  ".W": "Four patients with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-independent bilateral adrenocortical macronodular hyperplasia (AIMAH) were examined. All of them were men whose ages ranged from 37 to 52 years. Plasma cortisol levels were high, with a loss of diurnal rhythmicity, and plasma ACTH was undetectable. Adrenal cortisol secretion was not suppressed by dexamethasone, but it was ACTH responsive. Test results for corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) also were negative. Image analyses revealed a normal sella turcica and significantly enlarged adrenal glands, which showed enhanced uptake of isotope. Both adrenal glands in all cases were between 72 and 176 g in combined weight and were composed of, and distorted by, yellow nodules. Histologically, small cortical cells with or without lipid, occasional clear cells, and rare compact cells of the usual size were increased in number in the glandular cords. Enzyme histochemically, cortical cells showed weaker activity for 3 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and other enzymes than did usual cortisol-producing adenomas. Ultrastructurally, they had moderately to poorly developed smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Nonnodular areas of the cortex consisting of nonproliferating cells were atrophic and contained no compact cell zone. This is similar to the adrenal cortices attached to cortisol-producing adenomas. These features are unique to AIMAH and suggest the presence of a distinct subtype of Cushing's syndrome.\r"

Both glands were removed; macroscopically, small cysts were seen on cut sections. Histologic examination showed broad bands of fibrosis, lymphoid follicles, and plasma cells that diffusely effaced the parathyroid architecture. Such features--if seen in the thyroid gland--would be reminiscent of an autoimmune process. The cysts were lined by respiratory and squamous epithelia and contained lymphoid follicles in their walls. Less affected areas of the parathyroid tissue were hyperplastic. It is believed that the inflammatory response in the parathyroid glands that is described in this article may be characteristic. It may result from the cysts or their contents or from an autoimmune reaction.\r"

Cell smears, cytocentrifuge preparations, or imprints were fixed, incubated with the reagents, and counterstained with May-Grunwald-Giemsa. Stable immunostaining and good morphologic characteristics allowed accurate cell identification and rapid enumeration of the positive cells. The immunophenotypes obtained with the use of 35 monoclonal antibodies with different specificities were similar to those determined by flow cytometry or immunohistochemical studies on the same samples. This IGSS method was especially useful for the examination of poor samples or complex cell suspensions with rare malignant cells. It could be an alternative to the immunoenzyme methods that generally are used for this purpose.\r"

  ".W": "Optimal use of frozen tissue procured as part of a thorough diagnostic workup of suspected lymphoma is important, and conservation of similar samples is a prerequisite for maintaining a large and varied frozen archive repository. The authors have evaluated a simple tissue-conserving method for the preparation of cellular lymphoid specimens for immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene rearrangement analysis. Initially, 16-microns-thick frozen tonsil sections were examined to determine adequacy for DNA extraction. Specimens containing three, six, and nine sections each were evaluated separately. DNA quantitation disclosed yields ranging from 84 to 204 micrograms (mean, 156 micrograms). The authors have used this technique on 24 cellular lymphoid proliferations from their frozen archives. Six to ten 16-microns sections were used, depending on tissue size. DNA quantitation ranged from 0 to 520 micrograms (mean, 135 micrograms). Twenty-one of 24 cases yielded adequate DNA for analysis; each showed appropriate germline or rear-ranged bands with respect to the particular morphologic diagnosis. Attempts to obtain adequate DNA with the use of this technique on skin biopsy specimens with lymphoid infiltrates resulted in overall poor yields; this may be because of dermal collagen or small sample size. This method of sample preparation provides adequate DNA for routine Southern blot hybridization analysis of cellular lymphoid tissues and offers the additional advantage of allowing preservation of frozen tissue for future study.\r"

The patients' ages were 11, 16, and 43; two were male and one was female. Histopathologic study disclosed fungal organisms resembling Aspergillus. However, cultures of these patients' nasal secretions grew Drechslera, Exserohilum, and Bipolaris fungal organisms. The non-Aspergillus nature of these infections was further supported by positive Fontana-Masson melanin staining. The authors conclude that allergic fungal sinusitis most likely results from non- Aspergillus organisms. For definitive fungal identification, tissue culture is mandatory. When tissue is not cultured or no organisms grow, a Fontana-Masson stain can be a useful adjunct in fungal identification.\r"

The authors reviewed the outpatient and inpatient microbiology tests of a three-month period during 1989 for a systematic sample of IDC patients. The 249 patients in the sample had 682 microbiology tests performed during the period (mean 2.7 tests per patient). Tests most frequently requested were mycobacterial culture, routine blood culture, and cryptococcal antigen determination. Patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (43% of IDC patients) accounted for 63% of the requested IDC tests. IDC patients comprised about 2.4% of patients served but accounted for 3.9% of the requested microbiology tests and 6.6% of the microbiology work load for reported tests. Using Centers for Disease Control case projections, the authors estimated that services to IDC patients in 1993 would comprise 6.6% of all microbiology tests and 10.6% of the microbiology work load. The implications of these data for microbiology probably also apply to other laboratory testing and emphasize the need for more efficient ways to use and perform diagnostic studies required by patients with HIV infection.\r"

Pretreatment of the sample of CSF with 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) ablated the antigen titer and established the presence of a false-positive LAT, whereas CSF pretreated with dithiothreitol (DTT) and pronase continued to yield a false-positive result. The differing ability of pronase, DTT, and 2-ME to eliminate interfering substances from CSF has not been previously described. Moreover, because RF is unlikely to cross the blood-brain barrier, the authors postulated that malignant disease was responsible for the patient's false-positive LAT in CSF. Hence, the authors report the case to emphasize that false-positive LAT results in CSF are unlikely to be produced by RF and to underscore the benefit of using enzymatic and sulfhydryl-reducing agents when the validity of the initial test results are in doubt. Such a procedure will optimize the chances of accurately identifying false-positive LAT results in CSF.\r"

Methods to neutralize the effect of heparin include the addition of polyanions, enzymes, or resins to the clinical samples. These techniques are time consuming and cumbersome and produce inconsistent results. As an alternative, use of a positively charged porous filtration medium to remove heparin from the sample is described. The filtration procedure requires less than one minute and provides a consistent and total removal of heparin at plasma concentrations in excess of therapeutic levels. Chromogenic substrate analysis for residual heparin activity confirms total removal of the drug at levels greater than one unit/mL of plasma. In clinical trials, filtration normalized the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) of all patient specimens containing heparin (n = 41). Filtration did not shorten the coagulation assay times of patients receiving warfarin (n = 36) or of those with a variety of acquired coagulopathies (n = 14). The level of coagulation factors adsorbed to the filter medium compares favorably to that adsorbed by other commercially available heparin-binding resins. Routine use of the filter in the clinical laboratory allows for the rapid and definitive identification of heparin in specimens with prolonged coagulation times and provides clinically meaningful data.\r"

Early diagnosis requires careful clinical surveillance, and the management of these patients can be complex. Cessation of heparin therapy and substitution or addition of oral anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, dextrans, and prostacyclin analogues have been advocated. The authors are aware of only two case reports in the literature that examine the use of plasmapheresis as a therapeutic alternative. The authors report a case of a 53-year-old white man who developed HATT after a single protamine-reversed exposure to heparin. Controlled platelet aggregation studies performed before and after apheresis sessions documented a dramatic response and rapid normalization of platelet number and function in the patient. The authors conclude that plasmapheresis could be a valuable adjunct in the successful management of patients with HATT. When done in conjunction with platelet aggregation studies, an objective measurement of therapeutic efficacy can be achieved.\r"

Most programs offered services to reduce stress from training, but few offered preventive services. Support policies were reported to be inadequate, especially in the areas of coverage for leaves of absence. Maternity leave represented most leaves of absences, as 10% of the female house staff and 11% of the male house staff members became parents. Program directors' terms were short, and only 30% perceived these roles to be their primary roles. Male directors believed that female house officers had a harder time adjusting to their programs.

In neonates receiving surfactant, there was a greater tendency for an audible murmur to develop (13 of 22 vs four of 14). In spite of this, the clinical use of indomethacin was similar for the two groups, 10 (45%) of 22 vs six (43%) of 14. Excluding neonates given indomethacin early, a comparable number of surfactant-treated neonates (9/17 [53%]) vs control neonates (6/12 [50%]) demonstrated spontaneous closure of the ductus within a physiologic time frame (on or before day 4). For the gestational ages studied, the beneficial effects of exogenous surfactant were not associated with either an increased risk for delayed closure of the ductus arteriosus or a greater incidence of indomethacin usage. Utilization of exogenous surfactant does not appear to have an adverse impact on ductal patency.\r"

We could not attribute these findings to differences in known risk factors for iritis, such as age, sex, or presence of antinuclear antibodies. There was no difference in the duration of follow-up between the two groups. It is possible that the decline in prevalence of uveitis reflects a referral bias for eye disease in the 1975 population. However, the decrease in disease severity remains unexplained and may represent more effective treatment, earlier surveillance for ocular disease, or a change in the frequency of ocular manifestations of this disease in the 1989 group.\r"

Blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, stroke volume, and total peripheral resistance were evaluated during preexercise, peak exercise, and recovery stages. Children with a family history of CAD exhibited greater systolic blood pressure and total peripheral resistance during preexercise and peak exercise stages than did those without a family history of coronary artery disease. After controlling for preexercise differences, the group with a family history of coronary artery disease exhibited greater increases in systolic blood pressure and less attenuation of total peripheral resistance to peak exercise than the group without a family history of coronary artery disease. Cardiac output indexed by body surface area and stroke volumes were higher at all times in the group without a family history compared with the group with a family history of coronary artery disease. Findings are compared with those of adult studies in terms of influence of family history of coronary artery disease on cardiovascular reactivity to stress.\r"

Because video games are widely played by children and adolescents, we assessed the metabolic and cardiovascular responses to video game playing. Heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen consumption were measured serially over 30 minutes in 32 males and females aged 16 to 25 years (mean +/- SEM, 20 +/- 1 years) while they played the \"Ms Pac-Man\" video game under standard laboratory conditions and compared with measurements made in a standing but inactive position. Playing the video game significantly increased heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and oxygen consumption. Energy expenditure increased from 6.08 +/- 0.24 kJ/min while the subjects stood inactive to 10.94 +/- 0.49 kJ/min while they played. The increase in metabolic rate and cardiovascular stimulation was similar in magnitude to mild-intensity exercise.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the incidence of infection secondary to arterial catheterization in children as well as the risk markers, we prospectively evaluated, during a 1-year period, all arterial catheters installed in children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. A total of 340 cannulas were placed in 310 children aged 80 +/- 4 months (mean +/- SEM) for a period of 64 +/- 4 hours. Most catheters were inserted percutaneously (99%) in the radial artery (86.5%). Ninety-two percent (313/340) of the catheters were sterile (group 1), 5% (17/340) were contaminated (less than 10 colony-forming units on semiquantitative culture) (group 2), and 3% (10/340) were considered either locally infected (ie, greater than or equal to 10 colony-forming units) (eight of 10) or associated with a possible catheter-related sepsis (two of 10) (group 3, or infected group). The incidence of local inflammation at the insertion site was higher in group 2 than in group 1 (18% vs 2.9%) but not statistically different between groups 3 and 1 (10% vs 2.9%). The duration of arterial catheterization was longer in group 3 than in group 1 (125 +/- 31 vs 61 +/- 4 hours). The risk of infection was nonexistent in the first 48 hours of catheterization. Thereafter it was calculated as being 6.2% (10/161), but it correlated poorly with the duration of arterial catheterization. These results confirm the very low incidence of infection related to arterial catheterization in children. Thus, routine catheter reinsertion is, in our opinion, unjustified.\r"

Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus is a benign but chronic condition of the anogenital area of girls and, less frequently, of boys. The characteristic lesions are hypo-pigmented plaques in a figure-of-8 pattern surrounding the vulva and anus and often involving the natal cleft. The affected hypopigmented skin is sharply demarcated from the normal skin. Hemorrhagic, bullous lesions are uncommon. Fissures and ulcers are seen on the labia, between the labia, and on the perineum, anus, and natal cleft in many children and on the glans penis in boys. Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus causes painful defecation and anal and vulval bleeding. In two patients, one girl and one boy, anal stenosis due to lichen sclerosus et atrophicus and laxative treatment developed. Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus mimics sexual abuse and has led to false accusation and investigations. The anogenital lesions cleared in three patients at the ages of 9, 11, and 12 years, but lesions can persist into adulthood.\r"

During the rapid growth phase, approximately 5% to 10% of the hemangiomas ulcerate. Ulcerated lesions are painful, may bleed, and are at risk for bacterial infection. Previous therapy has included daily local wound care, topical antibiotics, and local and systemic steroids. We treated nine infants (eight female and one male) with ulcerated hemangiomas by means of a vascular-specific (585-nm) pulsed (450-microsecond) tunable dye laser. Eight of the nine patients had a single ulceration, whereas one patient had two ulcerations within a large hemangioma. Six of the ulcerations healed with a single laser treatment. One ulceration required two treatments to heal, and the remaining two required three treatments. Pain was subjectively decreased within 2 to 3 days in all patients after a single treatment. The pulsed tunable dye laser should be considered in the treatment of all ulcerated hemangiomas.\r"

Thirty-one were infants living in poverty who ingested excessive amounts of water offered at home by their caretakers. Exhaustion of the supply of infant formula was the most common reason given for this substitution. Infants were treated by a single infusion of hypertonic saline or a slow infusion of isotonic saline. Central pontine myelinolysis was not observed as a complication of hypertonic saline therapy. Modification of the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children to provide sufficient formula for the growing infant and better education of mothers as to the hazards of excessive water ingestion might reduce the incidence of this preventable and life-threatening condition.\r"

For girls, the percentage of chronic dieters was significantly less in grades 7 and 8 (7.8%) than in grades 9 and 10 (13.5%) or grades 11 and 12 (14.3%). There were no differences among urban, suburban, or rural youth. Black girls were less likely to diet compared with white girls. Chronic dieters were more likely than other students to report maladaptive weight-loss techniques, such as self-induced vomiting (relative risk, 9.92 for girls and 9.40 for boys), laxative use (relative risk, 7.18 for girls and 11.00 for boys), ipecac use (relative risk, 8.33 for girls and 11.00 for boys), and diuretic use (relative risk, 7.30 for girls and 13.5 for boys).

Comparison of valproic acid polytherapy and monotherapy yielded significantly lower free carnitine levels in the polytherapy group. The ratios of acyl to free carnitine for monotherapy (0.41) and polytherapy (0.45) were significantly higher than that in the normal group (0.25).

The recombinant baculovirus contains 107 nucleotides from the 3' terminus of the DEN-1 matrix (M) gene, which encodes a hydrophobic signal peptide and extends through the first 1, 245 nucleotides of E, terminating 243 nucleotides before the 3' terminus of E. When the recombinant virus was grown in Spodoptera frugiperda cells, about 1 mg of E antigen was made per 10(9) cells. Recombinant E antigen reacted with E protein-specific monoclonal antibodies and stimulated production of DEN-1 virus neutralizing antibody in BALB/c mice. Mice immunized with recombinant E antigen or with heat-inactivated DEN-1 virus were protected significantly against lethal DEN-1 virus challenge. A dose/response effect was observed, with increasing amounts of recombinant antigen leading to increased survival. These results demonstrate the utility of baculovirus for producing immunogens against DEN-1 virus.\r"

The study was done as a randomized, double-blind trial. Complete, but in some cases, transient clearance of microfilaremia was observed in both treatment groups. At one year, recurrent microfilaremia was present in seven patients treated with ivermectin and in five treated with DEC. Pretreatment levels of microfilaremia were significantly higher in patients who relapsed within one year after treatment than in those who remained amicrofilaremic. Side effects with both treatments were common, but mild. Febrile reactions were more frequent in the ivermectin group; localized reactions consistent with a flare-up of acute filarial disease occurred mostly in the DEC group. We conclude that ivermectin is an effective and practical alternative to DEC for treatment of recurrent microfilaremia due to bancroftian filariasis.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the effect of a single dose of ivermectin with that of a standard course of diethylcarbamazine (DEC) on several parameters of the host's antifilarial immune response in 60 patients with bancroftian filariasis enrolled in a double-blind drug trial. All participants had measurable serum levels of antifilarial antibodies and parasite antigens at the onset of the study. Drug-induced clearance of microfilaremia was associated with a temporary increase in HC 11 antigenemia and a decrease in serum levels of antibodies to soluble filarial antigens. Antigenemia progressively declined in patients who remained amicrofilaremic after treatment, but declined and then increased in persons with recurrent microfilaremia. Treatment triggered a sustained increase in serum levels of interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin-6 in all patients studied. Although ivermectin and DEC are believed to exert their antiparasite activity via different mechanisms, the same pattern of serologic changes was observed in patients treated with either drug.\r"

  ".U": "91345179\r", 
  ".W": "The charts of 39 consecutive patients who underwent surgery between 1979 and 1989 with a diagnosis of alveolar hydatid disease (AHD) of the liver were reviewed. The analysis of these cases from eastern Anatolia, which is the endemic region in Turkey, was undertaken to determine the current experience for AHD lesions. Of these patients, 33 (84.6%) had unresectable disease and the remaining six patients (15.4%) were treated by hepatic resection of the primary lesion. In the unresectable cases, laparotomy with biopsy was the most commonly used surgical procedure (56.4%), followed by tube drainage of the necrotic cavity (18.0%), marsupialization (5.1%), and cystojejunostomy (5.1%). Diagnostic studies and operative findings were useful in detecting the AHD lesions. Differential diagnosis was established mainly by histopathologic examination of a biopsy specimen or resected tissue. Pulmonary metastases were seen in two cases, and mortality occurred due to brain metastases in two other cases. Mebendazole was administered postoperatively to 19 patients with indications for 1) advanced AHD, 2) adjuvant therapy to radical and palliative surgical procedures, and 3) recurrences of disease after hepatic resection. The patients were treated with daily doses of approximately 50 mg/kg for periods of one and six years (median 3.2 years). Encouraging results were obtained in 11 of nineteen patients. Five-year survival was seen in 8 of the patients with AHD in this series. There were 18 deaths (46.2%) in our 39 patients. Long-term follow-up was not possible in four cases, and 17 patients (43.6%) were still living. The causes of mortality were advanced AHD in 14 cases, brain metastases in two, and acute myocardial infarction in another two.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Inflammatory responses to Plasmodium hepatic schizonts within the livers of non-immunized animals have long been assumed to be initiated only after the parasites have matured and begun to burst. However, recent reports of inflammatory responses around hepatic schizonts suggested a re-examination of this issue. We injected Norway-Brown rats of various ages intravenously with Plasmodium berghei sporozoites and studied subsequent liver histopathology. We found that the ability of these rats to mount an inflammatory response is age-dependent. Young (4 weeks) rats had weak inflammatory responses against hepatic schizonts, whereas older (8-10 weeks) rats mounted a strong response. Older rats had many granulomatous reactions within the liver; eosinophils represented a pioneer component of the cellular infiltrate. There was a reduction in the numbers of surviving hepatic schizonts in the older rats, suggesting that these granulomatous and eosinophilic reactions had effectively destroyed some of the hepatic schizonts. We found clear evidence of inflammatory cells (eosinophils) infiltrating hepatic schizonts as early as 40 hours post-injection with sporozoites, a time well before any hepatic schizonts could have burst within the liver. This presents histological evidence that inflammatory cells can recognize and infiltrate intact hepatocytes containing schizonts in immunologically naive animals.\r"

The DEN CV clones were temperature sensitive (ts) and had small plaque morphology. The DEN-1 and DEN-4 CV viruses differed in their ability to infect, to replicate in, and to be transmitted by mosquitoes. The DEN-1 CV virus was not attenuated for the vector mosquitoes; oral infection rates with the CV virus were as high as or higher than the P virus, and the CV virus replicated efficiently in mosquitoes after oral infection. The DEN-4 CV virus was attenuated; it was less efficient than its P virus in infection and replication in mosquitoes. Thus, the ts phenotype and small plaque morphology are not reliable biological markers for prediction of vector attenuation. Similar results were reported by others for attenuation in man and monkeys. These studies with DEN-1 and DEN-4 viruses, and previously reported studies with DEN-2 virus and with DEN-3 virus suggest that vector and vertebrate host attenuation are genetically linked. Thus, vector attenuation may be a biological marker for human attenuation.\r"

  ".W": "A study on adult anopheline ecology and malaria vector incrimination was carried out from 1986 to 1989 during irrigation development in an area of the Mahaweli Project in eastern Sri Lanka. Eleven potential vector species were collected resting indoors or by using human or bovid bait, and from light trap catches. Overall, Anopheles vagus (Donitz), An. annularis (van der Wulp), and An. subpictus (Grassi) were the most prevalent, and An. culicifacies (Giles) and An. barbirostris (van der Wulp) were the least prevalent species. The abundance of An. aconitus (Donitz), An. jamesii (Theobald), An. pallidus (Theobald), and An. subpictus increased after irrigation development, while An. annularis, An. barbirostris, An. culicifacies and An. varuna (Iyengar) decreased. Populations of An. nigerrimus (Giles), An. tessellatus (Theobald), and An. vagus did not change substantially. Seven species were infected with malaria parasites, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) done on mosquito head-thorax triturates. The main species involved were An. annularis, at peak abundance during the 1986-1987 period of development leading to the onset of irrigation, and An. subpictus, during times of seasonal abundance in the post-irrigation period of 1988 to 1989. Although occurring at low abundance, An. culicifacies was involved in malaria transmission irregularly throughout the study period. While there was strong ELISA-based evidence implicating An. subpictus as a major post-irrigation vector, confirmation of its vector status must await dissection and ELISA-based evidence of P. vivax and P. falciparum sporozoite infection rates in salivary glands.\r"

After 4-8 days, one exoerythrocytic (EE) parasite per 30,000 sporozoites was detected in one of three experiments performed with the P. falciparum NF54 strain. However, numerous EE parasites were detected in Aotus and Saimiri cells infected with sporozoites of the P. falciparum Santa Lucia strain. At day 6, most of the parasites contained several hundred nuclei, and were morphologically similar to those previously described in vivo using light or electron microscopy. A monoclonal antibody directed against the repeat region of the circumsporozoite protein of P. falciparum labeled the plasma and parasitophorous vacuole membrane of five-day-old EE parasites by immunoelectron microscopy, thus supporting previous observations by immunofluorescence indicating that the CS protein persists throughout the EE development of P. falciparum. These results demonstrate that liver stages of P. falciparum can be obtained in Aotus and Saimiri monkey cells, they also suggest a parasite strain specificity for hepatocytes.\r"

Thirty-five of 312 surveyed dogs (11.2%) had indirect immunofluorescent antibody titers of 1:64 or greater against R. australis antigen. Positive control sera were obtained from two dogs experimentally inoculated with R. australis. One of these dogs was serially sampled and a rickettsemia could not be documented. None of 26 control sera obtained from dogs from South Australia, New Zealand, western Victoria, or North Carolina had antibody titers greater than or equal to 1:64.

Mefloquine and main metabolite concentrations were determined in 100 microliters of capillary blood using a high performance liquid chromatographic method. In the standard, one-half, and one-quarter dose groups, all children cleared the parasites within three days after treatment. Reappearance was noted in one of the children in the one-quarter dose group during 49-56 days of followup. Among the children given one-eighth of a dose, two had an RII response and four had an RI response with early recrudescence. All 24-hour in vitro micro-tests (n = 30) showed full susceptibility for mefloquine. Adverse gastrointestinal reactions were reported by eight children on the first day after treatment, four of whom had been given a standard dose. These children had higher mefloquine concentrations one day after treatment than the other children in this group (P less than 0.05). In the standard dose group (n = 13), the area under the curve of capillary whole blood concentrations of mefloquine versus time was 52.4-112.1 mumol/liter x days. The highest concentration on day 1 was 2.75-7.20 mumol/liter and the median terminal half-life was 17.4 days. The highest concentrations of the main metabolite were observed 1-2 weeks after treatment and the median half-life was 18.9 days. The concentrations in the other groups were approximately proportional to those in the standard dose group both for mefloquine and the metabolite.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study examines the demographic profile, past medical and immunization history, itinerary, and reason for travel of 2, 445 travelers to the developing world seen at a travel medicine service from 1984 through 1989. The travelers age ranged from three months to 85 years (mean age 43). A chronic medical condition was reported by 654 (27%). Four percent of all travelers were intolerant of sulfonamides, and 9% had contraindications to mefloquine for malaria prophylaxis. Many travelers were due to receive the primary series or updatings of routinely recommended immunizations: 43% for tetanus/diphtheria, 55% of those born after 1956 for measles, and 70% for polio if their travel itinerary included a polio risk. Most travel (71%) was for vacations, 13% was for teaching or study, 11% for business, and 5% for missionary activities. The median duration of travel was 21 days; 5% traveled for more than one year. While over 150 countries were visited, 52% of all travel was to 10 countries in East Africa, the Indian subcontinent, the Far East, and South America. Information about the epidemiology of travel to the developing world can help physicians and travel medicine services develop more effective preventive measures for travelers.\r"

  ".W": "Approximately 460 base pairs (bp) of DNA sequence that included the second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) and some flanking 5.8S and 28S ribosomal RNA coding regions were compared between the two closely related and morphologically indistinguishable mosquito species Anopheles freeborni and A. hermsi and a third related species, A. occidentalis. Sequences were determined from 14 clones of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified DNA obtained from four colonies of A. freeborni, two colonies of A. hermsi, and one individual A. occidentalis. Four clones showed independent single bp differences from the consensus for the relevant species. Eleven sites differed between the consensus sequences of A. hermsi and A. freeborni; 28 sites differed between A. hermsi and A. occidentalis. With the exception of a single bp mismatch in the 5.8S and two single bp mismatches near the undetermined junction of the ITS2 and 28S regions, all differences were confined to the ITS2 region. A PCR-based species-diagnostic assay for the cryptic species A. hermsi and A. freeborni was developed; it uses four synthetic oligonucleotides, two derived from areas of interspecies sequence difference in the ITS2, and two derived from highly conserved regions in the flanking coding sequences. Small amounts of mosquito DNA amplified in the presence of these four primers produce fragments of diagnostic size for each species: 900 bp for A. freeborni, 350 bp for A. hermsi, and approximately 1.2-1.4 kb for various other Anopheles species tested. We believe that this general approach to the development of species-diagnostic assays can be extended easily to other complexes of closely related, morphologically indistinguishable species.\r"

Nuclei isolated from the fetuses of the ethanol-treated mice had lower levels of methylase activity relative to controls even in the presence of excess S-adenosylmethionine, which serves as the methyl donor for the enzyme DNA methyltransferase. Acetaldehyde, at concentrations as low as 3 to 10 microM, inhibited DNA methyltransferase activity in vitro. Since DNA methylation is thought to play an important role in the regulation of gene expression during embryogenesis, ethanol-associated alterations in fetal DNA methylation may contribute to the developmental abnormalities seen in the fetal alcohol syndrome.\r"

Sons of alcoholics and sons of nonalcoholics received a moderate dose of alcohol (0.5 g/kg) in three sessions with alcohol, followed by a placebo session. Sons of alcoholics developed reverse tolerance or chronic sensitization to repeated dosings of alcohol in finger pulse amplitude, while sons of nonalcoholics did not. Sons of alcoholics failed to show chronic tolerance in skin conductance and finger temperature, while sons of alcoholics did show the development of tolerance. Sons of alcoholics demonstrated greater motor activity throughout the sessions, both before and after alcohol. These results indicate that high and low risk groups differ in terms of their developmental adaptation to alcohol, as well as in the temperamental trait of behavioral activity.\r"

Pretreatment with Ro15 at all doses tested resulted in a significant reduction of the saccharin-ETOH solution; however, Ro15 did not alter the rats' consumption of water. The effects of Ro15 on general fluid consumption was investigated in Experiment 2. Following acclimation to a two-bottle regimen of a saccharin-solution and tap water 30 min/day, naive animals were pretreated with Tween-80 vehicle or Ro15 injections. Ro15 failed to alter saccharin or water consumption.

  ".W": "Withdrawal from both acute and chronic ethanol (EtOH) exposure is associated with increased neural excitability and increased activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. There is some evidence that glucocorticoids are necessary for EtOH withdrawal seizure expression. Lines of mice that were selected for severe (WSP) and minimal (WSR) EtOH withdrawal (as estimated from handling-induced convulsion scores) have been shown to differ in their stress response following an acute dose of EtOH. In this study we provide evidence that these lines of mice also differ in their sensitivity to the excitatory effects of glucocorticoids. EtOH withdrawal seizures of WSP mice were significantly increased by chronic and acute corticosterone treatment, whereas those of the WSR mice were unaffected. Neural excitability was decreased in the WSP mice when aminoglutethimide, a glucocorticoid synthesis blocker, was administered. Thus, it appears that genetic differences in EtOH withdrawal seizure severity may be due, in part, to differences in sensitivity to the excitatory effects of glucocorticoids.\r"

Results confirmed large increases in subarachnoid cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume and mild ventricular enlargement in the alcoholics and revealed associated volume reductions of localized cortical and subcortical cerebral structures. Volume losses in the diencephalon, the caudate nucleus, dorsolateral frontal and parietal cortex, and mesial temporal lobe structures were the most prominent. Significant correlations between increments in cortical and ventricular CSF and decrements in the volume of cortical and subcortical grey matter were noted. Although there was little evidence for relationships between performance on neuropsychological tests and volume of grey matter structures, significant correlations between some cognitive measures and subcortical and cortical fluid volumes were found. The parallels between this pattern of affected structures and recent neuropathological findings are discussed.\r"

Several laboratories have confirmed that rodents exposed to ethanol in utero demonstrate both diminished proliferative responses of T cells to mitogens and diminished proliferative responses of T-blast cells to human recombinant interleukin 2 (rIL2). We examined the developmental time course of these altered immune responses by testing the immune function of in utero ethanol-exposed rats at various ages. We found that while diminished splenic T cell proliferative responses could not be detected at 2 weeks, they were present at 6 weeks after birth and suppression was maximal at 6 weeks and 3 months. Thereafter, at 5 and 7 months, the altered immune responses gradually declined and normalized at 8 months of age. Thus, both altered T cell mitogenesis and the blunted IL2-induced proliferative response of T-blast cells could serve as biomarkers of fetal exposure to ethanol.\r"

  ".W": "While some morbidities associated with the excessive use of alcohol are related to the total amount of alcohol consumed--cirrhosis being an example--other pathologies, such as trauma and those of psycho-social origin, are mainly related to the frequency of acute alcoholic intoxication rather than to the total amount consumed. The balance between these two types of alcohol-associated morbidities can provide an indication of the relative frequency of intoxication, and thus of the pattern of alcohol abuse in a population. Since trauma is highly associated with acute alcoholic intoxication, the prevalence of bone fractures was determined in cirrhotics in nine countries. The prevalence of rib and vertebral fractures on routine chest x-rays showed a 17-fold variation in the different countries, from 2% and 6% in Spain and Italy to 30% and 34% in Canada and the USA, suggesting marked differences in the pattern of alcohol abuse to intoxication. Conversely, the prevalence of cirrhosis is twice as high in Spain and Italy than in Canada and the USA. A strong positive correlation between per capita consumption and cirrhosis mortality (r = 0.86; p less than 0.01) exists among the nine countries studied, while the correlation between per capita alcohol consumption and the prevalence of trauma is not statistically significant (r = 0.40). Supporting a strong association between trauma and alcoholic intoxication, the prevalence of trauma was found to be highly correlated: r = 0.88, p less than 0.002, with the degree of concern for the psycho-social consequences of alcohol abuse in the different countries. Data indicate that trauma can be used as an objective indicator to assess the pattern of alcohol abuse in a population.\r"

We suggest that at least some of these adaptive responses occur because of ethanol actions at the level of gene expression.\r"

At the same time, little is known about the natural history of personality change during adolescence as it relates to substance use behaviors. Yet, this question is of clear importance to our understanding of personality risk factors for substance use because personality needs appear less temporally stable during adolescence than later in the life span. In this study, we use prospective longitudinal data to investigate the relation of high-risk personality needs to substance use in two groups of adolescents: those who maintained a temporally stable personality need structure across 3 years and those who showed considerable changes in personality needs during the same time interval. Subjects were 12, 15, or 18 years old at the first test time and 15, 18, or 21 years old, respectively, at the second test time. For subjects of both sexes, only those who maintained a temporally stable, low-risk personality profile showed quite conservative substance use patterns across time compared with all others. Generalized personality changes were linked to more intensive substance use behaviors in males, especially among those who had high levels of risky personality needs at the first test time. In contrast, personality change, per se, did not appear as relevant to females' alcohol and other drug use behaviors until combined with information regarding their level of high-risk personality needs. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for prevention and future research.\r"

Do such elevations predict future blood pressure dysregulation or are they simply a transitory effect of alcohol toxicity? Thirty-two patients admitted to the hospital for alcohol detoxification were tested to examine the relationship between admission BP and response to isometric handgrip administered 4 to 5 days (session 1) and 3 to 4 weeks (session 2) postdetoxification. Alcoholics were divided into three groups based on admission BPs: Hypertensive (HT, greater than or equal to 160/95 mmHg), Borderline Hypertensive (BHT, 140/90-159/94 mmHg), and Normotensive (NT, less than 140/90 mmHg). In sessions 1 and 2, the groups no longer differed on resting BP or heart rate (HR) but did differ on BP and HR response to handgrip: Compared with the NT group, the HT and BHT groups had greater rises in systolic and diastolic BP and HR. There was a trend for HT alcoholics to report a positive parental history of hypertension (91%) compared to BHT and NT alcoholics (64% and 60%, respectively), suggesting the existence of premorbid factors to this exaggerated cardiovascular response. Further, alcohol consumption, based on a quantity-frequency index, was significantly higher in the HT group than in the NT group. The results suggest that transitory elevations in blood pressure observed during alcohol withdrawal may predict future BP abnormalities.\r"

An experimental design was devised to control the dietary content of 18-carbon fatty acids. The levels of 18:3n6, 18:3n3 and 18:1n9 were varied by a formulation of dietary oils which contained similar proportions of 18:2n6. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a purified diet containing 11% by weight of either borage oil (BOR) rich in 18:3n6, linseed/safflower oil (LSO) rich in 18:3n3, or sesame oil (SES) rich in 18:1n9 for 7 weeks and exposed to ethanol vapors by means of inhalation for the final 6 days of the dietary regimen. Moderate blood ethanol levels of 118 +/- 6.6 mg/dl were obtained. Total lipids were extracted from platelets and aortae, and the fatty acid distributions were analyzed by gas chromatography. BOR feeding resulted in increases in the proportion of n-6 fatty acids (18:3n6, 20:3n6, 20:4n6) in platelets and aorta. Animals fed the LSO diet had increased levels of n-3 fatty acids (18:3n3, 20:5n3, 22:6n3). The SES-based diet resulted in an increase in 18:1n9 in both aorta and platelets. Following ethanol exposure alone, the most marked change in the fatty acid profile was a decrease in 20:4n6 in the platelet. This effect was not observed in rats supplemented with BOR. No significant changes were observed in the aortic fatty acid content at this level of ethanol exposure. The results suggested that, in the rat, a diet enriched with BOR effectively prevented ethanol-induced alterations in platelet fatty acid composition.\r"

Family history of alcohol dependence did not affect the accuracy of estimation of BACs. Subjects who reported lower levels of subjective intoxication underestimated their BACs more than did subjects who reported higher levels of subjective intoxication. Subjects with less behavioral impairment underestimated their BACs more than subjects with greater behavioral impairment on the ascending limb of the blood alcohol curve. Accuracy was better on the ascending limb compared with peak BAC and the descending limb, and accuracy became worse over time on the descending limb. It appears that cues to the effects of alcohol rapidly become unavailable on the descending limb, which may contribute to decisions concerning further alcohol consumption and driving after drinking.\r"

Although total blood adenine nucleotides were significantly diminished in AH, ALC, and NALC groups, the AH patients retained their energy relationships within normal range. On the other hand, the cirrhotic groups, independently of their etiology, failed to maintain an adequate ATP/ADP ratio, energy charge, and phosphorylation potential in the blood, suggesting a decreased energy availability in their blood cells. Nevertheless, the mechanism involved in these effects remains to be elucidated, a failure of the damaged liver to supply purines to extra-hepatic tissues might be a major event altering the blood energy parameters.\r"

Substantial levels of ethanol were detected in the brain in the first sample taken after self-administration although these levels did not correlate with the amount of ethanol consumed. Striatal ethanol levels reached maximum or near maximum by the second sample and remained constant for the time points between 20 and 60 min; at these times, brain ethanol levels correlated significantly with the amount consumed. This study demonstrates that oral consumption of ethanol leads to measurable brain levels within a relatively short time. Results suggest that experimental animals may experience the central effects of ethanol during the course of drinking and this could play a role in alcohol preference or avoidance behavior.\r"

The results of the ratings on the check-list were used to test a statistical model for its capacity to describe the individual courses of mood states during the recovery process. Time Series Analysis revealed that the individual courses of moods fitted an autoregressive statistical model and could thereby be summarized in numerical measures for individual baselines, amplitudes, and lengths of recovery. Such individual profiles of the alcohol recovery process, may be useful for both clinical and research purposes, making it possible, for instance, to predict points in time for an individual's recovery with respect to his total well-being, as well as the various dimensions of his mood states.\r"

This more conservative analysis reflects our concern over possible inclusion of \"false positives\" in our previous estimate and now puts the overall rate in the western world at 0.33 cases per 1000. The estimate among whites is 0.29 per 1000 compared with 0.48 per 1000 for blacks. We did not include estimates for native Americans owing to the absence of prospectively gathered data on FAS for this group. Retrospective studies suggest larger disparities. Both prospective and retrospective studies may be influenced by examiner bias especially for minorities since minorities are often evaluated against standards derived from whites. Based on our estimates and the number of black and white children born each year, we estimate that about 1200 children are born with FAS each year in the United States. This is a probable lower limit based on considerations of ascertainment and absence of relevant information for other minorities such as native Americans. In calculating economic costs, we have now adjusted our estimates to take into account costs that would be incurred whether cases were FAS or not, and also have now included estimated costs for anomalies in FAS cases not considered in previous estimates. Based on these considerations, we now estimate the incremented annual cost of treating this disorder at $74.6 million. About three-quarters of this economic burden is associated with care of FAS cases with mental retardation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The present study was designed to define further the extent of changes in the immune system that result from fetal ethanol exposure and to compare effects in male and female offspring. In adulthood, male and female offspring from Sprague-Dawley dams fed an ethanol-containing liquid diet (alcohol, A), an isocaloric liquid control diet (pair-fed, PF), or laboratory chow and water (control, C) during pregnancy were tested for several measures of immune competency. Prenatal ethanol exposure differentially affected male and female offspring. Fetal ethanol-exposed males exhibited a decrease in thymocyte number as well as a decreased splenic lymphocyte proliferative response to the T-cell mitogen, concanavalin A (Con A), with a concomitant decrease in recoverable blast cells, when compared with PF and C males. Further, the defect in T-cell proliferation of A males was not due to an inability to produce the critical growth factor, interleukin-2 (IL-2), but to an inability of lymphoblasts to utilize exogenous IL-2. Fetal ethanol-exposed females showed some suggestion of lower thymocyte counts and decreased splenic T-cell proliferative responses to Con A compared to PF and C females. For most of the immune measures, however, no significant differences occurred among A, PF, and C females. In utero ethanol exposure did not significantly alter spleen cell counts or IL-2 production, splenic B-cell proliferation to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or thymocyte response to IL-2 in animals of either sex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Both groups believed they were receiving DS. At admission there was no significant difference between the DS and PL groups with regard to demographic characteristics, psychosocial adjustment, drinking variables, medical disorders, or laboratory results. After a study period of approximately 300 days, 63 patients (33 DS; 30 PL) were assessed using a battery of tests. There was no significant difference between the groups with regard to reduction in average alcohol consumption, number of days to the first alcohol intake after implantation, or level of psychosocial function. Nevertheless, both groups reduced their ethanol consumption significantly, probably due to the psychological deterrent effect. The DS implant did result in a significantly higher incidence of wound complications. This study does not support the idea that a 1-g DS implant has any significant clinical effect different from the implant containing only 1 mg DS (placebo).\r"

The investigation compared 37 men who were family history positive for alcoholism with 37 family history negative controls on postinfusion levels of cortisol, prolactin, and growth hormone following 0.12 and 0.20 mg/kg of diazepam given IV over 7 minutes. The results demonstrated no evidence of a decreased response for the sons of alcoholics on the levels of these three hormones.\r"

  ".W": "The chronic administration of ethanol or brief exposure to nitrous oxide (N2O) decreases the activity of hepatic methionine synthase and disrupts normal metabolic processes that require folate and vitamin B12. This combination of drugs has clinical relevance since alcoholic patients often require surgery and receive N2O as a component of their anesthetic. To assess this clinical problem using a rodent model, rats were given a liquid ethanol diet (35% of calories as ethanol) and control rats were pair-fed a liquid diet with carbohydrate substituting for the caloric content of ethanol. After receiving liquid diets for 6 weeks, rats were exposed to 60% N2O/40% O2 for 6 hr. Urinary excretions of formic acid and formiminoglutamic acid (FIGLU) were used as indirect markers of folate status. In both the ethanol-fed and control groups, excretion of formic acid and FIGLU markedly increased the first day after N2O and returned towards background values by the second day after N2O exposure. Ethanol treatment alone decreased methionine synthase activities in liver, but not kidney or brain. Exposure to N2O further decreased methionine synthase activities, and recovery of methionine synthase activity after N2O occurred over a period of 4 days at the same rate in both the ethanol-fed and control groups. Ethanol treatment for 6 weeks combined with acute exposure to N2O did not deplete the rats of vitamin B12 in blood, liver, kidney, or brain. We conclude that in this animal model, chronic treatment with ethanol does not markedly exacerbate the disturbances in folate/vitamin B12 metabolism caused by brief exposure to N2O.\r"
