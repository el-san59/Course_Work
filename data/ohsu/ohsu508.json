  ".W": "On the basis of the observations that HIV antigenaemia indicates a high risk of progression to AIDS and that zidovudine and alpha-interferon act synergistically against HIV replication in vitro, we performed a pilot trial including 12 HIV-infected asymptomatic patients with detectable p24 antigen in serum. The patients received low-dose lymphoblastoid alpha-interferon alone for 4 weeks followed by a combination of interferon and low-dose zidovudine for a further 16 weeks. The median p24 antigen level decreased significantly (P less than 0.01), the decrease being most pronounced at week 5. Decreases in haemoglobin and neutrophil counts were observed. Four patients required reduction of the zidovudine dose and three patients were transfused. In conclusion, the drug combination was capable of reducing the serum level of HIV p24 antigen and it was tolerated by the patients. Further studies are required to evaluate the clinical implications of these observations.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated whether human immunoglobulin G (IgG) directed to gp110 may serve as an attachment system to Fc-gamma receptors (Fc-gamma R), allowing eventual infection of cells of the macrophage lineage. An anti-HIV IgG preparation that prevented viral particles and soluble recombinant radiolabelled envelope precursor gp160 from binding to CD4 on CEM lymphoid cells, and that strongly inhibited infection of these cells by HIV, was selected. In contrast, anti-HIV IgG, whether or not previously complexed to viral particles, bound to monocytic U937 cells that express both high Fc-gamma RI and low affinity Fc-gamma RII receptors. Precoating these cells with anti-HIV IgG or complexing the antibodies with soluble 125I-gp160 resulted in increased fixation of gp160 to the cells, which was inhibited by aggregated human normal IgG. These data indicate that anti-HIV IgG-dependent attachment of gp160 to monocytic cells occurs through both types of Fc-gamma R. In addition, this method of attachment resulted in productive infection of U937 cells that, since it was blocked in the presence of Leu3a, still appeared to involve gp110-CD4 interaction. Only slight enhancement of infectivity, such as described for other enveloped viruses, was noted, even when antibody concentration was titrated down. This mechanism may be one of the explanations why the humoral response to HIV is not usually protective.\r"

We carried out a survey to assess the feasibility of studying sexual lifestyle in a random sample of the British population, aged 16-64 years, in November 1987. Two thousand and seventy-seven households were selected using a multi-stage probability sampling procedure. Seven hundred and eight-five adults participated in a structured interview. The schedule included demographic details, attitudes to AIDS, numbers of sexual partners in different time periods, history of homosexuality and contact with prostitutes. An interview was obtained in 61% of households where contact was made, but the overall response rate was low (48%). There was marked variability between individuals in numbers of sexual partners in given time intervals. Men and women in younger cohorts had experienced first sexual intercourse earlier and had higher numbers of sexual partners than people in older cohorts. Surprisingly few reported high-risk behaviour such as homosexuality and use of prostitution. The methodological problems in trying to obtain unbiased and valid data on sexual behaviour are discussed. Further work is necessary to improve the response rate and questionnaire design.\r"

In this paper, it is demonstrated that this guideline is largely based on unrealistic assumptions. If the sensitivity of identifying high-risk partners, realistic estimates of the efficiency of mechanical and chemical barrier methods, and the compliance in following either strategy are taken into account, use of condoms and/or suppositories containing nonoxynol-9 might be more effective than the attempt to avoid high-risk partners. Thus, both barrier methods should be strongly recommended for casual sexual heterosexual contacts.\r"

Two hundred and four people (98 women, 106 men) were interviewed from three locations; Kampala (an area with a high incidence of AIDS), Kabale, a town in central Kigezi, and villages in North Kigezi (both relatively low incidence areas). The main points to emerge are: (1) all the respondents were aware of the disease; (2) only 3.6% of respondents mentioned AIDS of their own accord as a problem for Uganda; (3) those in Kampala were most knowledgeable and men in all three areas were generally more informed than women; (4) change in behaviour was more pronounced in those who had known an AIDS victim personally; (5) 100% of men and 79% of women had heard of condoms but only eight men (9.4%) and one woman (1.0%) used condoms regularly for the prevention of AIDS, and (6) there was, nonetheless, a degree of willingness to use condoms once informed that they could reduce the risk of AIDS.\r"

An antibody to a conserved epitope on gp120 is adsorbed to a solid phase and used to capture gp120 and/or gp160 from solution. This may be purified recombinant protein or in simple, non-denaturing detergent extracts of different strains of HIV-1. Human serum antibodies bound to the captured antigen are subsequently detected with an anti-human antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase, and the AMPAK ELISA amplification system (Novo BioLabs, Cambridge, UK). With this procedure, antibodies can be detected that recognize gp120 from a wide range of divergent HIV-1 strains. The ELISA is sufficiently sensitive to detect env antibodies in sera from HIV-positive individuals at dilutions of 1:300,000. No repeatable false-positives were detected in a screen of 250 normal serum samples. Env antibodies were detected in all 37 strongly HIV-positive sera tested, and in four sera that were borderline or weakly positive in commercial ELISA. However, 55 sera positive in commercial ELISA but unconfirmable by Western blot ('ambiguously' positive) did not contain detectable env antibodies.\r"

In contrast, recombinant peptides derived from the external envelope glycoprotein were only weakly recognized by two sera. We observed a cross-reactivity of some human sera containing antibodies to HIV-1 with the HIV-2 peptides derived from the transmembrane protein of HIV-2. In spite of this cross-reactivity, a serological distinction between anti-sera to HIV-1 and HIV-2 can be attempted by simultaneous testing in ELISA on recombinant peptides derived from the transmembrane protein of HIV-1 and HIV-2.\r"

In initial tests on 1127 blood donations, of 628 HIV-1 high-risk specimens and 176 HTLV-I high-risk specimens, GACPAT for anti-HIV-1 was 98.9% specific and 100% sensitive, and for anti-HTLV-I was 99.0% specific and 93.0% sensitive. It rivalled the sensitivity of second-generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for anti-HIV-1 in tests on specimen dilutions and on seroconversion series. GACPAT can be used as a cheap, large-scale test and as a simple confirmatory check on other assays.\r"

In five of these 10 patients the mean cell volume did not increase but remained within the normal range. Bone marrow examination of three of these five showed a pure red-cell aplasia. In all five patients the anaemia resolved on discontinuation of the drug and in three that were re-challenged, the anaemia recurred. Zidovudine-induced anaemia has usually been reported as macrocytic and megaloblastic, but in our experience erythroid aplasia appears to be a major cause of anaemia occurring within the first 3 months of treatment. The earliest sign is anaemia with a stable or only a slight increase in the mean cell volume (MCV).\r"

On testing for HIV-2 by WB, two of the 96 indeterminate sera had antibodies to the HIV-2 envelope glycoproteins. Two complementary tests were used: a radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) and a HIV EIA recombinant assay (ENVACOR) to check 53 of these indeterminate sera. Forty-one were positive for the p25 protein in RIPA, of which 34 were negative in ENVACOR; six were positive for core proteins only and one was positive for envelope and core proteins using this assay. Twelve of the 53 indeterminate sera were negative in RIPA, of which 11 were negative and one positive for core proteins in ENVACOR. Thus, 42 of these sera remained indeterminate even after the two additional tests which did not allow a distinction between retroviral infection or non-specific reactions. We were able to isolate an unusual HIV-1 virus from lymphocyte cultures of two subjects presenting antibodies directed only against the core proteins.\r"

Antiviral activities were defined by a microtiter infection assay utilizing MT-2 cells as targets and HTLV-III-B produced in H9 cells as a virus source. The scope of agents tested included rIFN-alpha A, rIFN-beta Ser 17, and rIFN-gamma as cytokines; azidothymidine and phosphonoformate (Foscarnet) as inhibitors of reverse transcription; ribavirin as a putative inhibitor of proper HIV mRNA capping; amphotericin B as a lipophile; and castanospermine as a glycoprotein processing (glucosidase I) inhibitor. Separately, each drug demonstrated dose-dependent anti-HIV activity and, when used in combination with mismatched dsRNA, demonstrated synergism. Although mismatched dsRNA was synergistic with all three IFNs for anti-HIV activity in microtiter infection assays, it did not potentiate the transient inhibition of virus production observed for IFN in cultures of H9/HTLV-III-B cells. The results of these studies suggest that the pleiotropic activities of dsRNAs differ from those of IFN and may provide synergism in combination therapy with a wide range of antiviral drugs for the treatment of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated whether recombinant erythropoietin (r-Epo) elicits a change in intracellular free calcium (IFC) in purified Epo-responsive cells in spleens of mice treated with phenylhydrazine. Colony-forming units (CFU-E) were prepared by negative selection through immunologic panning. Anti-Forssman, Mac-1, Ia, and HSA antibodies were used to eliminate nonhematopoietic progenitors. After two pannings, 29 +/- 1.5% (mean +/- 1 SD) of the recovered cells were CFU-E. IFC was measured by labeling cells with the fluorescent dye Indo-1 and analyzing them on a flow cytometer from 15 seconds to 30 minutes after the addition of agonist. At each step of the panning procedure, there was no effect of r-Epo (0 to 10 U/mL) on IFC even in the larger cells that are predominantly CFU-E. As a positive control, calcium ionophore (A23187) significantly increased IFC in greater than 90% of the spleen cells enriched in CFU-E. During growth of CFU-E in methylcellulose, the calcium ionophore did not affect the r-Epo-dependent formation of erythroid colonies. EGTA inhibited the formation of erythroid colonies. This inhibition appeared to be the result of a toxic effect of the chelator because the colony growth could not be restored when Ca2+ was added to the cultures in the presence of the EGTA. We conclude that the biologic action of Epo on responsive erythroid cells does not depend on acute changes in IFC.\r"

  ".U": "89229371\r", 
  ".W": "Colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) stimulate the activation and steady-state mRNA accumulation of an important regulatory enzyme for macromolecular synthesis, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). Cloned murine CSF-dependent cell lines exhibited a rapid activation of ODC enzyme activity, detectable within ten minutes of stimulations with either interleukin-3 (IL-3), GM-CSF, or G-CSF. This early phase of enzyme activation did not require early protein or mRNA synthesis. The subsequent protracted rise in ODC activity occurring four to six hours after CSF treatment was dependent on increases in steady-state ODC mRNA accumulation and de novo protein synthesis. CSF, therefore, modulates both posttranslational activation of preexisting ODC and stabilization and accumulation of ODC mRNA. Antiproliferative signals, such as cAMP or interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), effectively inhibited the CSF-directed increase in steady-state ODC mRNA. Cotreatment of the murine NSF 60.8 cell line with IFN-gamma and GM-CSF decreased steady-state ODC mRNA greater than 80% as compared with GM-CSF-treated cells alone. IFN treatment did not cause any appreciable destabilization of mature ODC mRNA, suggesting that its major effect may be at the level of ODC mRNA transcription or posttranscriptional processing. These data indicate that the ODC gene-protein system is an important molecular locus of the effects of myeloid proliferative and antiproliferation signals.\r"

  ".W": "Using a newly developed murine monoclonal antibody (MoAb), TM83, against glycoprotein IIIa (GPIIIa) of human platelets, we have analyzed the relationship between platelet fibrinogen binding and conformational changes in GPIIIa under EDTA treatment. Crossed radioimmunoelectrophoresis demonstrated that TM83 reacted with only the GPIIb/IIIa complex but also with GPIIIa alone. TM83 dose-dependently inhibited both thrombin-induced aggregation and fibrinogen binding to activated platelets. 125I-TM83 bound to an average of 20,890 +/- 1,600 (mean +/- SE, n = 12) sites on a resting platelet, with Kd = 2.06 nmol/L in the presence of Ca2+. When platelets were incubated in 2 nmol/L EDTA-containing medium, pH 7.4, at 22 degrees C for 30 minutes, binding of TM83 decreased to 70% of the control level. The decreased binding was fully recovered to the control level when the platelets were resuspended in Ca2+-containing medium. These platelets retained their aggregability. In contrast, when platelets were incubated in 2 mmol/L EDTA-containing medium, pH 7.4, at 37 degrees C for 30 minutes, TM83 binding to the platelets markedly decreased to 7% of the control, which could only be recovered to 40% of the control by replacing the medium with calcium-containing medium; these platelets lacked thrombin-induced aggregability. These findings suggest that the epitope for TM83 may be located near the fibrinogen binding site on GPIIIa and that its conformation is dependent on Ca2+ ions.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-one (5.7%) of 368 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), studied fully for karyotype and immunophenotype, had breakpoints in the q23 region of chromosome 11. This abnormality resulted from reciprocal translocation in 17 cases [with chromosomes 4 (n = 5), 10 (n = 2), and variable chromosomes (n = 10)], from deletions in three cases, and from a duplication in one case. The 17 children with 11q23 translocations had higher leukocyte counts (P less than .01) and were more likely to be black (P less than .01) and younger (P = .08) as compared with each of the following non-11q23 translocation groups: t(1;19), t(9;22), random translocations, and cases without translocations. Event-free survival at 3 years for the 11q23 translocation group did not differ significantly from that of the t(1;19), t(9;22), or random translocation groups. Leukemic cells from ten of the 21 patients with an 11q23 structural chromosomal abnormality had an immunophenotype indicative of B-lineage ALL (HLA-DR+, CD19+, CD2-, CD3-); this was confirmed by the presence of rearranged immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes in seven cases. In eight of these ten B-lineage cases, the blasts were negative for expression of the CD10 antigen, indicating a primitive stage of B-cell development. Four cases were classified as T-cell ALL, and seven others were characterized by blasts that failed to react with our panel of lineage-associated monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). Myeloid antigens were expressed by leukemic cells in three of the cases that were tested. The initial clinical features associated with translocations involving the 11q23 chromosomal region may define a distinct subtype of ALL. Whether the constellation of findings relates to a breakpoint at 11q23 per se or to the specific translocation will require further study.\r"

  ".W": "The peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) were incubated for 0.5 h to 72 h in the presence of the phorbol ester TPA, the calcium ionophore A23187, or a combination of these reagents. Using Northern blot analysis, total cellular RNA was prepared from cells harvested at different time points and hybridized with DNA clones specific for the protooncogenes c-fos and c-myc. While untreated control cells lacked detectable amounts of messenger RNA (mRNA), increase in the level of c-fos mRNA was noted as early as 0.5 h after exposure to the inducers. Peaks of c-fos and c-myc transcript accumulation were seen at 1 h and 4 h after induction, respectively. The most effective inducer was double stimulation with TPA plus A23187. The kinetics of c-fos and c-myc mRNA accumulation in B-CLL appear to be similar to those reported for normal lymphocytes that have been either activated by physiologic external stimuli or by direct activators of protein kinase C and calcium flux (such as TPA and A23187). No direct link between oncogene expression and proliferation or differentiation parameters could be established. These results document that expression of c-fos and c-myc genes, which are among the earliest events following stimulation of the protein kinase signal transduction pathway, can be successfully induced in B-CLL cells. The data provide further evidence for the hypothesis that signal transmission downstream of protein kinase C is intact in B-CLL.\r"

A new bcr-abl mRNA is expressed in these cases. We have developed a modified polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of this mRNA. The method is extremely sensitive, reliable, and relatively fast. The analysis of peripheral blood or bone marrow cells from CML patients treated with chemotherapy shows that the two possible mRNAs are expressed in various combinations. Our results show that even after myeloablative therapy for bone marrow transplantation bcr-abl mRNAs are still expressed. Further studies, however, are necessary to determine the clinical relevance of a small number of persisting cells expressing the bcr-abl mRNA.\r"

  ".U": "89229426\r", 
  ".W": "Human tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) is a glycoprotein used currently in thrombolytic therapy. Because of its rapid half-life (T1/2) of approximately five minutes, intravenous (IV) infusion of large doses (approximately 100 mg) are required in patients treated for myocardial infarction. To identify the determinant(s) on t-PA responsible for such rapid clearance, metabolically labeled forms of recombinant t-PA were analyzed in rats following IV administration. The following seven forms of t-PA were tested: (a) natural or glycosylated wild-type t-PA; (b) nonglycosylated wild-type t-PA; (c) delta F t-PA, which lacks the fibronectin fingerlike domain; (d) delta E t-PA, which lacks the epidermal growth factor (EGF) domain; (e) delta FE t-PA, which lacks both the finger and EGF domains; (f) delta FE3X t-PA, a form of delta FE t-PA in which Asn-linked glycosylation is prevented at all known glycosylation sites (Asn-117, 184, and 448; replaced by Gln); and (f) delta FE1X t-PA, a form of delta FE t-PA in which high-mannose-type glycosylation is prevented at Asn-117. Both glycosylated and nonglycosylated wild-type t-PA cleared in an exponential biphasic manner, with an initial alpha-phase T1/2 of 0.8 and 1.9 minutes, respectively. This result demonstrates that carbohydrate is not the primary mediator of the rapid clearance of t-PA. The liver was the primary organ responsible for uptake of these molecules. All other proteins tested, except for delta E t-PA, demonstrated primarily monophasic clearance patterns with T1/2 ranging between 12 and 27 minutes, and reduced uptake in the liver. delta E t-PA however, cleared in a biphasic manner with an alpha-phase T1/2 of 2.1 minutes. Results presented suggest that the clearance of t-PA is mediated by two distinct mechanisms. The primary determinant(s) responsible for modulating the rapid clearance of t-PA appears to be resident within the polypeptide sequence encoding the finger and/or EGF domains, with emphasis on the finger domain. A second and less significant contribution to clearance is defined by the presence and type of glycosylation.\r"

We report here the results of a new factor VIII concentrate that is purified from human plasma using a mouse monoclonal antibody to factor VIII:vWF in an affinity chromatography system. The resultant concentrate has an activity of between 3,000 and 5,000 U/mg protein before albumin is added as a stabilizer. Seven patients with severe hemophilia A and no inhibitor who were positive for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have been treated solely with this concentrate for over 24 months. Factor usage in these patients has ranged from 611 U/kg/yr to 2,022 U/kg/yr. These patients have infused approximately once per week on the average, most often for joint hemorrhages. The efficacy of the concentrate is excellent. No allergic reactions have occurred and no factor VIII antibodies have developed. In these seven patients mean CD4 counts stabilized (856 +/- 619 at screen v 778 +/- 686 at 24 months) and there was reversal of skin test anergy. In a comparison group on conventional intermediate purity concentrate chosen retrospectively decreases in mean CD4 cell counts similarly did not occur. However, the number of the comparison patients who were anergic increased over the course of the study. These observations indicate the possibility that more highly purified concentrates may stabilize immune function in HIV seropositive patients.\r"

We found morphological and biochemical changes indicative of generalized endothelial damage in 49 of 66 allogeneic marrow graft recipients receiving cyclosporine, but none in 11 patients treated with methotrexate for prophylaxis of graft-v-host disease (GVHD). Changes occurred after engraftment of bone marrow and consisted of intravascular hemolysis with red cell fragmentation and de novo thrombocytopenia. They were preceded by a decrease in activated partial thromboplastin time and fibrinogen indicating activation of coagulation. Endothelial damage as the central lesion of microangiopathy was confirmed by a simultaneous increase of factor VIII related antigen. Severe microangiopathy was observed in ten patients and was fatal in seven. Risk factor analysis revealed a highly significant association of microangiopathy with severity of acute GVHD (aGVHD) (P less than .001) and use of CsA prophylaxis (P less than .001). Our data suggest endothelial damage as a result of cellular activation and subsequent release of cytokines in the course of a aGVHD, which is not inhibited by CsA prophylaxis.\r"

A flow cytometric immunoreactive bead (IRB) assay is described for quantitative, simultaneous, and early detection of antibodies to HIV. Polystyrene beads of four diameters, each size coated with a different HIV recombinant DNA-produced protein (p24, p31, gp41, or gp120), bound anti-HIV antibodies detected with fluorescent antiglobulin. The IRB assay was performed on a panel of blood donor samples, many giving consistently false-positive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and indeterminant Western blot (WB) results. The IRB assay proved as sensitive and more specific than currently licensed EIA and WB tests. Results on serial samples from eight HIV-infected individuals indicated that quantitation of anti-p24 by IRB assay may be useful in monitoring disease progression. Sequential pre- and post-EIA seroconversion sera from 35 HIV-infected homosexual men were tested by the IRB assay using IgM- and IgG-specific fluorescent probes. All 35 cases were IRB assay positive for at least one rDNA-p either before (17 of 35, 49%) or at the time of EIA positivity. Eleven cases (31%) initially had only IgM anti-HIV, primarily to gp41 (17%). In two individuals, the IgM response was detected at least 18 months before EIA seroconversion. The IRB assay is a widely applicable analytic procedure, potentially useful in pretransfusion anti-HIV screening of blood.\r"

Umbilical artery velocity waveforms were obtained at 28, 34, and 38 weeks of gestation, from which the pulsatility index, A/B ratio, and resistance parameter were calculated. No abnormal features or indices of neonatal outcome were adequately predicted. The most sensitive index for being delivered of a growth retarded infant (less than 5th centile birth weight for gestation) was an A/B ratio at 34 weeks (sensitivity 40%, specificity 84%). Other measures that show poor neonatal nutritional state (ponderal index, skinfold thickness, and ratio of mid-arm circumference to head circumference) were even less well predicted. Acute and chronic hypoxia as determined by Apgar score, pH in blood from the cord artery, and packed cell volume correlated poorly with umbilical artery waveform indices, and there was no obvious difference between the indices of those who subsequently required operative or instrumental delivery for fetal distress and those requiring no intervention. There were three unexplained stillbirths in the series, in each of which the fetus had shown waveform patterns that suggested increased peripheral resistance, though the technique did not appear to be useful for predicting the time of subsequent death. Screening for small for dates babies in a three stage programme was of no value regardless of the threshold or index chosen. Obstetricians should resist the temptation to introduce screening with Doppler ultrasonography until its proper role has been determined.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine the efficacy of oral nimodipine in reducing cerebral infarction and poor outcomes (death and severe disability) after subarachnoid haemorrhage. DESIGN--Double blind, placebo controlled, randomised trial with three months of follow up and intention to treat analysis. To have an 80% chance with a significance level of 0.05 of detecting a 50% reduction in an incidence of cerebral infarction of 15% a minimum of 540 patients was required. SETTING--Four regional neurosurgical units in the United Kingdom. PATIENTS--In all 554 patients were recruited between June 1985 and September 1987 out of a population of 1115 patients admitted with subarachnoid haemorrhage proved by the results of lumbar puncture or computed tomography, or both. The main exclusion criterion was admission to the neurosurgical units more than 96 hours after subarachnoid haemorrhage. There were four breaks of code and no exclusions after entry. One patient was withdrawn and in 130 treatment was discontinued early. All patients were followed up for three months and were included in the analysis, except the patient who had been withdrawn. INTERVENTIONS--Placebo or nimodipine 60 mg was given orally every four hours for 21 days to 276 and 278 patients, respectively. Treatment was started within 96 hours after subarachnoid haemorrhage. END POINTS--Incidence of cerebral infarction and ischaemic neurological deficits and outcome three months after entry. MEASUREMENTS--Demographic and clinical data, including age, sex, history of hypertension and subarachnoid haemorrhage, severity of haemorrhage according to an adaptation of the Glasgow coma scale, number and site of aneurysms on angiography, and initial findings on computed tomography were measured at entry. Deterioration, defined as development of a focal sign or fall of more than one point on the Glasgow coma scale for more than six hours, was investigated by using clinical criteria and by computed tomography, by lumbar puncture, or at necropsy when appropriate. All episodes of deterioration and all patients with a three month outcome other than a good recovery were assessed by a review committee. MAIN RESULTS--Demographic and clinical data at entry were similar in the two groups. In patients given nimodipine the incidence of cerebral infarction was 22% (61/278) compared with 33% (92/276) in those given placebo, a significant reduction of 34% (95% confidence interval 13 to 50%). Poor outcomes were also significantly reduced by 40% (95% confidence interval 20 to 55%) with nimodipine (20% (55/278) in patients given nimodipine v 33% (91/278) in those given placebo). CONCLUSIONS--Oral nimodipine 60 mg four hourly is well tolerated and reduces cerebral infarction snd improves outcome after subarachnoid haemorrhage.\r"

In this study 294 premenopausal and 319 postmenopausal women aged 45 to 55 were examined radiographically for calcified deposits in the abdominal aorta, which have been shown to represent intimal atherosclerosis. Aortic atherosclerosis was present in eight (3%) of the premenopausal women and in 38 (12%) of the postmenopausal women. After adjustments for age and other indicators of cardiovascular risk women with a natural menopause had a 3.4 times greater risk of atherosclerosis than premenopausal women (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 9.7; p less than 0.05); women who had had a bilateral oophorectomy had a 5.5 times greater risk (1.9 to 15.8; p less than 0.005). No excess risk of atherosclerosis was observed among women who had had a hysterectomy without removal of both ovaries. These results suggest that when oestrogen production stops, either naturally or after surgery, the risk of atherosclerosis is increased.\r"

DESIGN--Double blind randomised parallel group study of omeprazole versus cimetidine for six weeks with assessment of healing at end of every second week. SETTING--Outpatient referrals in 11 centres in Denmark. PATIENTS--One hundred sixty one patients who satisfied the following criteria: age 18-79; one or more ulcers of body of stomach (that is, at or above the angulus) seen endoscopically within four days before study treatment; no H2 receptor antagonists taken within previous two weeks; no history of gastric surgery and no complications needing surgery; no concurrent treatment or disease that might confound assessment; oral contraception or an intrauterine device being used by women of childbearing age. INTERVENTIONS--Omeprazole 30 mg daily (one capsule in the morning) or cimetidine 1 g daily (one 200 mg tablet thrice daily, two tablets at bedtime) for six weeks. Inactive capsules and tablets provided so that all patients took same number of capsules and tablets daily. Compliance monitored by pill counts. END POINT--Endoscopic evidence of accelerated healing of type I gastric ulcers after four weeks of omeprazole. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Pain recorded on diary cards and patients assessed after two, four, and six weeks of treatment for clinical state and by endoscopy and biopsy and repeat laboratory tests. Twenty eight patients withdrawn during trial for violations of protocol. At two weeks healing rates were identical in the two treatment groups (omeprazole 41% (30/73 patients); cimetidine 41% (30/73]. At four weeks cumulative healing rates were 77% (53/69 patients) in the omeprazole treatment group and 58% (41/71) in the cimetidine treatment group (95% confidence interval of difference between groups 4% to 34%). By six weeks the cumulative healing rates in the two treatment groups differed by only 6% (60/68 patients (88%) given omeprazole; 53/65 (82%) given cimetidine). Log rank analysis with ulcer size used as covariable showed a significant difference in healing times in favour of omeprazole. There was no difference in the occurrence of pain relief between the two treatment groups. No serious clinical or biochemical side effects of treatment were noted. CONCLUSIONS--Omeprazole 30 mg daily accelerates healing of ulcers in the body of the stomach as compared with cimetidine 1 g daily. This effect is more pronounced in ulcers greater than 12 mm diameter.\r"

The number of patients with first ever strokes and the net number of people handicapped after these strokes in England and Wales every five years until 2023 have been projected. Between the base year 1983 and the year 2023 an increase in population of about 5% will occur; first ever strokes are projected to increase by about 30% and deaths within six months of first ever strokes by about 40%. The net number of severely handicapped people six months after a first ever stroke is projected to increase by only about 8%, however, and the net number of people who are moderately or severely handicapped by only 4%. This paradox occurs because first ever stroke often kills people who have been handicapped by other causes, particularly if they are elderly. It is concluded that despite the limitations of these data they strongly suggest that the increased burden of health care of patients with first ever strokes in the next 40 years will be primarily that of caring for those in the acute stages of stroke and not with the management of chronic handicap after a stroke.\r"

INTERVENTIONS: Melatonin (or placebo) 5 mg three days before flight, during flight, and once a day for three days after arrival. END POINT: Symptoms of jet lag. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Visual analogue scale for feelings of jet lag and tiredness; profile of moods states questionnaire for vigour-activity and fatigue-inertia; and retrospective ratings 10 days after arrival of sleep pattern, energy, and daytime tiredness. Feelings of jet lag were less for subjects taking melatonin (mean score 2.15 v 3.4); these subjects took fewer days than the placebo group to establish a normal sleep pattern (2.85 v 4.15), to not feel tired during the day (3.0 v 4.6), and to reach normal energy levels (3.25 v 4.7). Results for fatigue-inertia and vigour-activity were similar. For all subjects jet lag was more severe on the return (westward) than the outward (eastward) journey. CONCLUSIONS: Melatonin can alleviate jet lag and tiredness after long haul flights.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the variability among histopathologists in diagnosing and grading cervical intraepithelial neoplasia eight experienced histopathologists based at different hospitals examined the same set of 100 consecutive colposcopic cervical biopsy specimens and assigned them into one of six diagnostic categories. These were normal squamous epithelium, non-neoplastic squamous proliferations, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades I, II, and III, and other. The histopathologists were given currently accepted criteria for diagnosing and grading cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and asked to mark their degree of confidence about their decision on a visual linear analogue scale provided. The degree of agreement between the histopathologists was characterised by kappa statistics, which showed an overall poor agreement (unweighted kappa 0.358). Agreement between observers was excellent for invasive lesions, moderately good for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade III, and poor for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades I and II (unweighted kappa 0.832, 0.496, 0.172, and 0.175, respectively); the kappa value for all grades of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia taken together was 0.660. The most important source of disagreement lay in the distinction of reactive squamous proliferations from cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade I. The histopathologists were confident in diagnosing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade III and invasive carcinoma (other) but not as confident in diagnosing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades I and II and glandular atypia (other). Experienced histopathologists show considerable interobserver variability in grading cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and more importantly in distinguishing between reactive squamous proliferations and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade I. It is suggested that the three grade division of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia should be abandoned and a borderline category introduced that entails follow up without treatment.\r"

HIV retroviral sequences were detected in four of the five subjects directly at the cellular level by in situ hybridisation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. HIV genomic sequences were confirmed by in vitro amplification of viral DNA with the polymerase chain reaction technique. The existence of a latent viral infection state in these seronegative subjects indicates the unreliability of standard serological analysis in people who have been in regular contact with infected patients.\r"

  ".W": "To examine ethnic differences in postneonatal mortality and the incidence of sudden infant death in England and Wales during 1982-5 records were analysed, the mother's country of birth being used to determine ethnic group. Postneonatal mortality was highest in infants of mothers born in Pakistan (6.4/1000 live births) followed by infants of mothers born in the Caribbean (4.5) and the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland (4.1). Crude rates were lower in infants of mothers born in India (3.9/1000), east and west Africa (3.0), and Bangladesh (2.8) than in infants of mothers born in the United Kingdom despite less favourable birth weights. Mortality ratios standardised separately for maternal age, parity, and social class were significantly higher in infants of mothers born in Pakistan and lower in those of mothers born in Bangladesh. The ratio for infants of Caribbean mothers was significantly higher when adjusted for maternal age. Ratios for infants of Indian and east African mothers did not show significant differences after standardisation. An important finding was a low incidence of sudden infant death in infants of Asian origin. This was paralleled by lower mortality from respiratory causes. During 1975-85 postneonatal mortality in all immigrant groups except Pakistanis fell to a similar or lower rate than that in the United Kingdom group; Pakistanis showed a persistent excess. During 1984-5 several immigrant groups (from the Republic of Ireland, India, west Africa, and the Caribbean) recorded an increase in postneonatal mortality. Surveillance of postneonatal mortality among ethnic communities should be continued, and research is needed to identify the causes underlying the differences.\r"

Altogether 2040 of the 2399 applicants were British (United Kingdom) nationals, constituting 24.7% (n = 8249) of all home applicants for medicine in 1986, and 1971 of them with postal addresses in the United Kingdom were sent questionnaires asking about their ethnic origin, whether English was their first language, and about their attitudes to ethnic monitoring. A total of 1817 (92.2%) applicants returned the questionnaire, 401 (22.6%) saying that they were from an ethnic minority group and 393 (21.6%) having non-European surnames. Multiple logistic regression identified 11 significant predictors of successful application, of which grades at O and A level, application after A levels, and date of application were the most important. After taking these four variables into account the predicted acceptance rates for home students on the basis of their application forms alone were 47.8% for white applicants and 35.6% for applicants from ethnic minority groups compared with actual acceptance rates of 49.6% and 27.3%, respectively. The difference in success of white and non-white applicants could partly but not entirely be explained by differences in the characteristics considered to be important in a professional context by selectors during shortlisting of candidates: academic ability, interests, and contribution to the community. No differences in the success rate of applicants from ethnic minority groups to individual medical schools could be identified. More research is needed to discover how perceptions of professional suitability are assessed from application forms and interviews.\r"

It was found that of the 141 dancers, 67 (47%) had experienced a chronic injury and 59 (42%) an injury in the previous six months that had affected their dancing. A high proportion of injuries to the soft tissues had not responded to treatment. With correct treatment such injuries should usually heal completely. Dancers are aware of the high rate of injuries and also of procedures that might help to prevent injury--for example, dancing on floors that are sprung and in warmer studios; teachers' and choreographers' awareness of a dancer's limitations and the need for rest and adequate treatment when an injury occurs.\r"

Dental health was graded by using two indexes, one of which was assessed blind. Based on these indexes dental health was significantly worse in patients with acute myocardial infarction than in controls. The association remained valid after adjustment for age, social class, smoking, serum lipid concentrations, and the presence of diabetes. Further prospective studies are required in different populations to confirm the association and to elucidate its nature.\r"

Both rates showed rapid increases in the late 1970s and then much slower increases after 1982. In contrast, among women, although the rate of unemployment followed a similar pattern, there was a gradual fall in the rate of suicide. The trends in regional unemployment for men during 1971-81 were compared with the suicide rates for the period before the increase (1974-7) and the period after the rapid increase (1983-6). No association was observed between trends in suicide and unemployment when analysed by health board areas or aggregates of local government districts. These data do not support the hypothesis that the rise in unemployment is a direct cause of the rise in suicide rates among men.\r"

Overall, smokers had significantly higher serum concentrations of cholesterol (3.0%), triglycerides (9.1%), very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (10.4%), and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.7%) and lower serum concentrations of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (-5.7%) and apolipoprotein AI (-4.2%) compared with nonsmokers. Among non-smokers and light, moderate, and heavy smokers a significant dose response effect was present for cholesterol (0, 1.8, 4.3, and 4.5% respectively), triglycerides (0, 10.7, 11.5, and 18.0%), very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (0, 7.2, 44.4, and 39.0%), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (0, -1.1, 1.4, and 11.0%), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (0, -4.6, -6.3, and -8.9%), and apolipoprotein AI (0, -3.7 and -5.7% in non-smokers and light and heavy smokers). These dose response effects may provide new evidence for a causal relation between exposure to cigarette smoke and changes in serum lipid and lipoprotein concentrations whether as a direct result of physiological changes or of dietary changes induced by smoking. Adequate prospective data to estimate the excess risk of coronary artery disease existed only for cholesterol concentration. When that information was combined with data from the present study, and given that smokers as a group face an average overall excess risk of coronary artery disease of 70%, it was estimated that the observed increased serum cholesterol concentration in smokers may account for at least 9% of that excess risk. Furthermore, the dose response effect of smoking on serum cholesterol concentration suggests a gradient of increased absolute risk of coronary artery disease between light and heavy smokers.\r"

  ".W": "There is a lack of consensus among studies on the possible risks of stroke from cigarette smoking; because of this a meta-analysis was conducted. All published data on the association were sought and the relative risk for each study obtained whenever possible. The pooled relative risks were calculated by using estimates of the precision of the individual relative risks to weight their contribution to the meta-analysis. Thirty two separate studies were analysed. The overall relative risk of stroke associated with cigarette smoking was 1.5 (95% confidence interval 1.4 to 1.6). Considerable differences were seen in relative risks among the subtypes: cerebral infarction 1.9, cerebral haemorrhage 0.7, and subarachnoid haemorrhage 2.9. An effect of age on the relative risk was also noted; less than 55 years 2.9, 55-74 years 1.8, and greater than or equal to 75 years 1.1. A dose response between the number of cigarettes smoked and relative risk was noted, and there was a small increased risk in women compared with men. Ex-smokers under the age of 75 seemed to retain an appreciably increased risk of stroke (1.5); for all ages the relative risk in ex-smokers was 1.2. The meta-analysis provides strong evidence of an excess risk of stroke among cigarette smokers. Stroke should therefore be added to the list of diseases related to smoking.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To investigate the effects of smoking, alcohol, and caffeine consumption and socio-economic factors and psychosocial stress on birth weight. DESIGN--Prospective population study. SETTING--District general hospital in inner London. PARTICIPANTS--A consecutive series of 1860 white women booking for delivery were approached. 136 Refused and 211 failed to complete the study for other reasons (moved, abortion, subsequent refusal), leaving a sample of 1513. Women who spoke no English, booked after 24 weeks, had insulin dependent diabetes, or had a multiple pregnancy were excluded. MEASUREMENTS--Data were obtained by research interviewers at booking (general health questionnaire, modified Paykel's interview, and Eysenck personality questionnaire) and at 17, 28, and 36 weeks' gestation and from the structured antenatal and obstetric record. Variables assessed included smoking, alcohol consumption, caffeine consumption, and over 40 indicators of socio-economic state and psychosocial stress, including social class, tenure of accommodations, education, employment, income, anxiety and depression, stressful life events, social stress, social support, personality, and attitudes to pregnancy. Birth weight was corrected for gestation and adjusted for maternal height, parity, and baby's sex. MAIN RESULTS--Smoking was the most important single factor (5% reduction in corrected birth weight). Passive smoking was not significant (0.5% reduction). After smoking was controlled for, alcohol had an effect only in smokers and the effects of caffeine became non-significant. Only four of the socioeconomic and stress factors significantly reduced birth weight and these effects became non-significant after smoking was controlled for. CONCLUSIONS--Social and psychological factors have little or no direct effect on birth weight corrected for gestational age (fetal growth), and the main environmental cause of its variation in this population was smoking.\r"

At first only a few patients attended, but within two years 461 had registered at the hospital and two mobile clinics. Publicity was spread through the area action committee, which was organised by the area chief. The main drug used was phenobarbitone. After treatment was given for six months seizures were fully controlled in 40 (56%) out of 71 patients. A further 20 (28%) had greatly improved. As news of the clinics spread other health units adopted the model, and eventually over 3000 patients with epilepsy were receiving regular treatment at 45 units throughout Malawi.\r"

DESIGN--Retrospective analysis of 146 courses of treatment over 434 cycles. SETTING--Infertility clinic. PATIENTS--118 Women whose failure to ovulate was due to idiopathic hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (n = 39), amenorrhoea related to low weight (n = 17), organic pituitary disease (n = 15), or polycystic ovaries (n = 47). INTERVENTIONS--Dose of 15 micrograms luteinising hormone releasing hormone/pulse subcutaneously every 90 minutes given with a miniaturised pump throughout cycle monitored by ultrasound. Women with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism had 48 courses, women with amenorrhoea related to low weight 23, women with organic pituitary disease 18, and women with polycystic ovaries 57. END POINT--Follow up of 100 pregnancies achieved in 77 women during six years after introducing treatment. MEASUREMENTS and main results--One hundred pregnancies (seven multiple, 28 miscarriages). Cumulative rates of pregnancy were 93-100% at six months in women with idiopathic hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, amenorrhoea related to low weight, and organic pituitary disease. In women with polycystic ovaries (cumulative rate of pregnancy 74%) adverse prognostic factors were obesity, hyperandrogenism, and high luteinising hormone concentrations, which were also associated with a high rate of early pregnancy loss. CONCLUSIONS--Treatment with pulsatile luteinising hormone releasing hormone is safe, simple, and effective, and the preferred method of inducing ovulation in appropriately selected patients. Compared with exogenous gonadotrophin treatment there is little need for monitoring, no danger of hyperstimulation, and a low rate of multiple pregnancies.\r"

The method utilizes the relative clearances of 99Tcm-MDP and 51Cr-EDTA from the blood after simultaneous injection. This is expressed as a ratio and the upper limit in normals is 1.4. This ratio has been evaluated in 42 patients with chronic renal failure and compared with appearances of left-hand radiographs. The ratio was elevated in these patients and the level corresponded to the degree of severity of the subperiosteal resorption. Similarly, there was a close correlation between the ratio values and the serum alkaline phosphatase measurements and parathyroid hormone values. Thirty-three patients had sequential studies performed at intervals of up to 2 years. Twenty-one patients showed no change on clinical, biochemical or bone scan evaluation. Of these, only one patient showed a change in ratio value of greater than 20%. Twelve patients showed evidence of change based either on clinical, biochemical or bone scan alteration and all 12 patients showed changes in ratio values greater than 20%. The 51Cr-EDTA/99Tcm-MDP ratio appears to offer not only a single plasma sample method for the detection and evaluation of renal bone disease, but our results also suggest that it may be valuable in the follow-up of these patients.\r"

Inspection of the high-energy X-ray depth doses for a 10 x 10 cm field at an SSD of 100 cm disclosed large differences between the two sets of data, especially for qualities above 8 MV. For example, a depth dose of 80% at 10 cm is rated at about 19 MV according to BJR Supplement 11, and 23 MV according to BJR Supplement 17. It was found that the Supplement 17 depth-dose data above 8 MV were erratic, but that the Supplement 11 data could be represented by an analytical expression, providing a unique means of assigning MV quality. It was also found that the dose-weighted average energy of the filtered beam plotted smoothly against depth dose. For dosimetric purposes, it is suggested that this parameter be used as a true measure of beam quality, removing the discrepancies introduced by the use of nominal MV for this purpose.\r"

  ".W": "From the studies and observations reviewed in this chapter, it can be appreciated that there is considerable direct and circumstantial evidence to implicate coronary artery spasm as a primary phenomenon in some patients with myocardial infarction. Although currently available data indicate that the number of acute myocardial infarctions due primarily to \"pure\" coronary artery spasm is relatively small, it should be emphasized that essentially very little if any data exist at \"time zero\" or at the actual onset of infarction. Most myocardial infarctions are probably multifactorial in etiology. To what extent coronary artery spasm, atherosclerosis, platelets, in situ thrombosis, endothelial mediators, and passive influences on vascular caliber interact in the pathogenesis of acute myocardial infarction remains incompletely understood.\r"

  ".W": "Proarrhythmic effects of flecainide acetate have been reported during exercise, but the mechanism for the arrhythmogenic interaction between flecainide and exercise is unknown. We hypothesized that the sinus tachycardia of exercise may enhance flecainide-induced conduction slowing by increasing use-dependent sodium channel blockade, thereby facilitating the occurrence of ventricular reentry. To evaluate the modulation of flecainide's effects by exercise, we studied 19 patients who were receiving therapeutic doses of flecainide for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. Sixteen patients underwent treadmill exercise testing by a modified Bruce protocol. During exercise, QRS duration increased progressively from 94 +/- 22 msec (mean +/- SD) at rest to 116 +/- 25 msec (p less than 0.001) at a mean heart rate increase of 84 +/- 32 beats/min. The patient with the greatest QRS increase developed a monomorphic ventricular tachycardia at peak exercise. At rest, the QRS duration after treatment with flecainide increased 12.1 +/- 10.0% compared with the pretreatment value, and with exercise, the QRS duration increased by a further 28.1 +/- 17.0% compared with the predrug value. We found that the best predictor of further exercise-induced QRS slowing was the change in QRS duration produced by flecainide at rest (r = 0.76, p = 0.001). In an age- and disease-matched control group, the QRS duration did not change during exercise that caused a similar heart rate increase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We administered CS-514, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, alone and in combination with cholestyramine to heterozygous Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits. This rabbit model for heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia has hepatic low-density lipoprotein receptors that are assumed to be half as many as in normal rabbits. CS-514 alone lowered plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 50%, and in combination with cholestyramine, it lowered levels by 80%. The membrane-binding assay showed these drugs caused 1.5- and 1.8-fold increases in the number of hepatic low-density lipoprotein receptors, respectively. We also measured the amount of mRNA for low-density lipoprotein receptor by S1 nuclease protection assay in the same livers as above. These drugs induced mutant mRNA for the low-density lipoprotein receptor, which has an in-flame deletion of 12 nucleotides, as well as normal receptor mRNA. CS-514 alone produced a 1.8-fold increase in the amount of mRNA for the normal receptor and a 2.3-fold increase for the mutant mRNA, whereas CS-514 in combination with cholestyramine produced 1.9- and 3.1-fold increases, respectively. We conclude that CS-514 induces mRNA for the low-density lipoprotein receptor, subsequently increasing the receptor protein in the liver, and then reduces the levels of plasma cholesterol, and that the induction is augmented when the drug is administered in combination with cholestyramine.\r"

Precontracted segments with 3 x 10(-6) M prostaglandin F2 alpha were studied after adding cumulative concentrations of these agents (1.0-8.0 mM, 10(-9)-10(-5) M, and 10(-10)-10(-6) M, respectively). Mg2+ significantly inhibited the tonic contraction compared with the time-matched controls at 1.0 and 2.0 mM (48.7 +/- 5.6% vs. 88.6 +/- 2.2%, p less than 0.01, 36.2 +/- 6.1% vs. 78.9 +/- 3.0%, p less than 0.01, respectively). 1.0 and 2.0 mM Mg2+ did not suppress, but actually increased, the amplitude of periodic contraction, but 8.0 mM Mg2+ reduced the amplitude compared with the controls (6.6 +/- 5.2% vs. 73.3 +/- 10.7%, p less than 0.01). Diltiazem at a concentration of 10(-5) M moderately inhibited the tonic contraction, and reduced the amplitude of periodic contraction almost completely. Nitroglycerin reduced the tonic contraction almost completely at a concentration of 10(-6) M but did not reduce the amplitude of periodic contraction at any concentration. We conclude that 1.0 and 2.0 mM Mg2+ inhibits the tonic contraction and that 8.0 mM Mg2+ inhibits the periodic as well as the tonic contraction of isolated human coronary arteries. Diltiazem inhibits the periodic contraction, whereas nitroglycerin suppresses tonic contraction without affecting the periodic contraction.\r"

  ".U": "89230714\r", 
  ".W": "Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) is a widely used thrombolytic agent for treating acute myocardial infarction. Some previous studies suggest that t-PA benefits the heart independently of lysing coronary artery thrombi. The purpose of this study was to determine whether t-PA directly affects infarct size independently of lysing coronary thrombi, affects the no-reflow phenomenon, and exacerbates intramyocardial hemorrhage. We used a canine model of 2 hours of occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by 4 hours of reperfusion. t-PA was administered 30 minutes after occlusion and was continued for 2 hours. Myocardial infarct size as a percentage of the risk zone was similar between saline (28 +/- 8%) and t-PA (35 +/- 9%) groups in a low-dose study and between saline (46 +/- 12%) and t-PA (44 +/- 12%) groups in a high-dose study. t-PA did not improve no-reflow. Intramyocardial hemoglobin level within the infarct was similar between saline (16 micrograms/mg) and high-dose t-PA (12 micrograms/mg) groups. The extent of hemorrhage assessed by intramyocardial hemoglobin correlated with infarct size. Histologic evaluation revealed that microscopic hemorrhage was confined to zones of contraction band necrosis. Neutrophil infiltration during early reperfusion was prominent. In conclusion, t-PA did not directly benefit the myocardium or no-reflow. Its effects in patients are likely due to its ability to lyse thrombi. t-PA did not cause infiltration of hemorrhage into noninfarcted tissue. Reperfusion accelerates the inflammatory response after myocardial infarction and results in early, intense neutrophil infiltration.\r"

  ".W": "Fibrinopeptide A (FPA) is a very sensitive marker of fibrin generation in vivo. Because an imbalance between thrombogenic and thrombolytic forces may be responsible for the failure to recanalize and for reocclusion of coronary arteries, such a marker could be of eminent value during thrombolytic treatment of acute myocardial infarction. Thirty-four consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction (peak creatine kinase level, 1,869 +/- 1,543 IU/l) were treated with 100 mg recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) 3.1 +/- 1.1 hours after onset of chest pain. Angiography 12.5 +/- 6.1 days later revealed an 81% patency rate of the infarct-related vessel. FPA plasma levels (normal, 1.9 +/- 0.5 ng/ml) were 34 +/- 46 ng/ml on admission and 93 +/- 86 ng/ml (538 +/- 674% with respect to each patient's admission level) after 90 minutes of rt-PA infusion (p less than 0.01). In patients without evidence of reocclusion (including three primary failures), FPA levels fell under continuous heparin infusion to 6.7 +/- 9.7 ng/ml (24 +/- 33%, p less than 0.01) within 30 minutes and were 3.1 +/- 2.2 ng/ml (15 +/- 15%, p less than 0.01), 1.6 +/- 1.1 ng/ml (8 +/- 10%, p less than 0.01), and 2.5 +/- 3.0 ng/ml (12 +/- 16%, p less than 0.01) 30 minutes, 9 hours, and 21 hours, respectively, after completion of rt-PA therapy. Five patients sustained intermittent or permanent coronary reocclusion after primary thrombolytic success. Their early postlytic FPA levels (13-51 ng/ml) remained high or increased again despite adequate anticoagulation. FPA allows the monitoring of fibrin generation during acute myocardial infarction and thrombolytic therapy. Despite successful recanalization, fibrin generation is increased under rt-PA administration before anticoagulation. Patients under anticoagulation with postlytic FPA levels less than 5 ng/ml or below their admission value seem to be at low risk of reocclusion for several days. FPA levels that are persistently high or that increase again despite adequate anticoagulation indicate ongoing fibrin generation. However, whether FPA can indeed be considered a useful marker of reocclusion remains to be confirmed in a larger population of patients with acute myocardial infarction.\r"

The majority of the patients also had complications such as septicemia or respiratory insufficiency and required vasopressor infusions. All patients were treated with continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration (CAVH). The duration of the CAVH treatment varied between a few hours and 90 days, with a mean of 8 days. The mean ultrafiltration volume per 24 hours was, on the average, 12 liters. CAVH resulted in adequate uremic control in 89 cases, but additional treatment with intermittent hemofiltration was necessary in 11 patients. The total survival rate was 45% including survival rates as high as 54% in patients with ARF complicating abdominal aortic surgery. Only three patients were referred for chronic dialysis therapy. In a subgroup of 17 patients with ARF complicating abdominal aortic surgery the nutritional aspects during CAVH were studied. It is concluded that during CAVH therapy it is possible to give adequate nutritional support even to hypercatabolic and anuric patients.\r"

Impedance to venous return by distention of a balloon in the inferior vena cava (IVCB) was utilized in 10 patients, during diagnostic procedures, to reduce blood flow through the lungs at baseline and to buffer its changes during stimulation of the adrenergic system, which was obtained with mental arithmetic (AT) and cold pressor (CPT) tests. 2. When venous return was unimpeded, cardiac output rose by 2.06 1/min during the AT and remained steady during the CPT, and arteriolar resistance in the pulmonary circuit was significantly reduced and slightly raised, respectively. 3. During IVCB, baseline cardiac output decreased by 710 ml/min, it rose by 925 ml/min during the AT and again remained steady during the CPT; pulmonary arteriolar resistance was unchanged from before obstruction at baseline and was significantly augmented by both tests. In particular, AT became a clear vasoconstrictor stimulus, having originally produced vasodilatation. 4. These observations support the view that lung blood vessels in man are sensitive to adrenergic influences and that vasoconstriction can be elicited in circumstances in which the flow through the lungs is restrained. The physiological importance of the neural regulation of the pulmonary circulation in man remains undefined.\r"

We have measured cation transport in vivo after the administration of an oral load of rubidium chloride, and have found that, although intra-erythrocytic concentrations of rubidium were significantly lower 1 h after the administration of rubidium when the subjects were taking lithium, there was a significant increase in the rate of uptake of rubidium into the erythrocytes over the subsequent period of the test, suggesting a direct stimulation of sodium, potassium-activated adenosine triphosphatase by lithium. 3. Lithium administration did not affect the plasma concentration versus time profile of rubidium after the rubidium load, implying that the lithium-stimulated uptake of rubidium which occurs in erythrocytes does not necessarily occur in other cell types. 4. These results suggest that previous studies of cation transport using peripheral cells and assay systems in vitro do not necessarily reflect changes in cation transport in vivo in excitable tissues.\r"

Ten patients were on maintenance haemodialysis and three had never been dialysed. The results are compared with data obtained from 12 normal individuals. 2. The rate of lysine influx into washed cells from buffered saline containing 0.02-0.5 mmol of L-lysine/l has been calculated. The results can be fitted with a model in which influx has a single saturable component obeying Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and a linear non-saturable component. 3. In uraemic erythrocytes the saturable component had a mean Vmax. of 0.762 mmol h-1 litre-1 of cells (n = 13, SEM 0.072) and a mean Km of 68.2 mumol/l (SEM 5.7). These values in normal erythrocytes were 0.566 mmol h-1 litre-1 of cells (n = 12, SEM 0.033) and 70.5 mumol/l (SEM 4.1), respectively. The mean apparent diffusion constant (KD) for the linear component of influx was 0.224 h-1 (SEM 0.039) in uraemic cells and 0.178 h-1 (SEM 0.028) in normals. 4. The 35% increase in mean Vmax seen in uraemic erythrocytes was statistically significant (P = 0.02). A similar increase in Vmax. in uraemic cells compared with controls was seen in erythrocytes which were studied in zero-trans conditions after depletion of intracellular amino acids. The mean values of Km and KD were not significantly different in uraemia. The origins of this increased membrane transport capacity for lysine in uraemia are discussed.\r"

The recent discovery of a putative natriuretic hormone (atrial natriuretic peptide, ANP) in cardiac atrial tissue has rekindled interest in the effect of the cardiovascular system on renal function. We have therefore studied the effects of this physiological manoeuvre on plasma ANP concentrations and renal responses. 2. Plasma concentrations of ANP, plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentration were measured during an 80 min period of negative pressure breathing at -12 cmH2O pressure in six hydrated normal subjects. Identical control studies were performed in the same subjects at at least 1 week apart. 3. Negative pressure breathing resulted in a natriuresis and diuresis which were associated with a significant rise in plasma ANP concentration. The natriuresis occurred despite an increase in plasma renin activity and in plasma aldosterone concentration. 4. These findings, under specific carefully controlled conditions, support the previously contentious postulate that negative pressure breathing enhances sodium excretion, in addition to its well-recognized diuretic effect. They add further weight to the hypothesis that expansion of the central blood volume is an important stimulus to the release of ANP from the heart (acting by way of atrial distension), and suggest that changes of plasma ANP concentration may have induced the natriuresis which occurred in the face of a modest activation of the sodium-retaining renin-aldosterone system.\r"

Preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative variables were compared between patients receiving TPN and patients not receiving TPN. Analysis was stratified for three surgical procedures: segmental small bowel resection, ileocectomy, and segmental or total colectomy The effect of TPN was most pronounced in patients having small bowel surgery. For segmental small bowel resection, 12 of 17 patients had TPN, and these patients had 20.4 +/- 14.3 cm less bowel resected than did those in the non-TPN group, an effect not dependent on duration of TPN. For ileocectomy patients, 31 of 62 patients received TPN, and these patients had 11.2 +/- 4.2 cm less small bowel resected than the non-TPN group, an effect not dependent on the duration of TPN. For large bowel resection patients, 6 of 24 patients had TPN, and there was no difference in length of bowel resection, preoperative and perioperative variables, or recurrence. The total hospital stay was 13.5 +/- 2.6 days longer for those having TPN; 3.5 +/- 1.9 days of the longer stay was postoperative. In conclusion, TPN was associated with reduced length of small bowel resection at the expense of longer hospital stay.\r"

  ".W": "In this informal initial study, four female patients with intractable chronic abdominal pain, daily nausea, intermittent vomiting, and altered stool habits due to \"functional\" disease were investigated. A gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog agonist, leuprolide acetate (Lupron) [D-leu6, Desgly-NH2(10), Proethylamide9], was administered once daily (0.5 mg subcutaneously) for three months. At the end of the three-month period, three subjects were symptom-free and the fourth experienced only mild and intermittent pain. The leuprolide regimen was continued for an additional three months, and estrogen (0.625 mg orally) and calcium (1000 mg orally) were given daily to prevent osteoporosis. The patients remained symptom-free. A challenge with progesterone then induced recurrence of mild symptoms in each subject. Withdrawing leuprolide induced the baseline symptoms in all patients within three to five days. This regimen has now been continued for up to 15 months, and all four patients have remained generally symptom-free. Progesterone has also been given every three months to induce menses. A fifth patient, with Roux-en-Y syndrome, has also been treated with leuprolide. She is symptom-free after six months and has gained weight. In this initial observation period in patients with severe functional (neuromuscular) bowel disease, the GnRH analog agonist leuprolide controlled pain, nausea, and vomiting.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Biochemical and ultrastructural effects of the aldose reductase inhibitor sorbinil were examined in two experimental rat models of chronic diabetic neuropathy: rats with streptozocin-induced diabetes (STZ-D) and rats fed a galactose-enriched diet. The frequency of neuroaxonal dystrophy in the superior mesenteric sympathetic ganglia of rats with untreated 8-mo STZ-D increased sevenfold compared with that in age-matched controls. Animals chronically maintained on a diet containing 50% galactose, however, did not develop neuroaxonal dystrophy in excess of that found in untreated age-matched control rats. Institution of sorbinil therapy at the time of induction of STZ-D decreased, but did not completely normalize, the frequency of neuroaxonal dystrophy without altering the severity of diabetes; this finding is based on measurements of plasma glucose, body weight, food consumption, 24-h urine volume, and levels of glycosylated hemoglobin. Sorbitol levels in the superior cervical sympathetic ganglia (SCG) of untreated 8-mo-diabetic animals increased three- to fourfold compared with levels in controls. The increase in sorbitol content of diabetic SCG was completely prevented by early institution of dietary sorbinil therapy. The myo-inositol content of 8-mo-diabetic SCG was modestly decreased compared with controls. Sorbinil administration improved but did not completely normalize diabetic SCG myo-inositol. The sorbitol content of the SCG, superior mesenteric and celiac sympathetic ganglia, and a major trunk of the superior mesenteric nerve of short-term (2.5-mo)-diabetic rats increased comparably, but only the diabetic SCG showed a decrease in myo-inositol.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the influence of diamine oxidase activity on the adaptive process of the small bowel after resection, we administered aminoguanidine, a potent diamine oxidase inhibitor, to rats for 10 days after either small bowel transection (n = 5) or 80% jejunoileal resection (n = 7). Five or more additional animals from each group received saline as controls. Ileal mucosal homogenates from the resection group receiving aminoguanidine, when compared with those from resection controls, showed no diamine oxidase activity with increased putrescine content and ornithine decarboxylase activity. Mucosal proliferation, as measured by mucosal mass, protein content, and deoxyribonucleic acid content, was greater in the resected animals receiving aminoguanidine when compared with that of resection controls. Sucrase activity per gram of mucosa was almost identical in both resection groups. These results show that the suppression of diamine oxidase during the postresection adaptive period results in enhanced mucosal proliferation with no effect on mucosal functional differentiation. Diamine oxidase may play a regulatory role in adaptive intestinal proliferation.\r"

  ".W": "Kupffer cell control of hepatocyte protein synthesis may be an important mechanism involved in the regulation of normal liver function and may be one mechanism responsible for the alterations in liver function seen during sepsis. The present series of in vitro experiments compare the response to various inflammatory stimuli of hepatocytes cocultured with Kupffer cells with that of hepatocytes cultured alone. In the absence of inflammatory stimuli, Kupffer cells stimulated hepatocyte protein synthesis. Lipopolysaccharide or gentamicin-killed Escherichia coli triggered Kupffer cell-mediated inhibition of cocultured hepatocyte protein synthesis but had no effect on protein synthesis of hepatocytes cultured alone. Phorbol myristate acetate, muramyl dipeptide, and calcium ionophore had no effect on hepatocytes cultured alone but resulted in a loss of Kupffer cell-mediated stimulation of cocultured hepatocyte protein synthesis without inhibition. Addition of dexamethasone to cocultures prevented the Kupffer cell-mediated inhibition of hepatocyte protein synthesis triggered by lipopolysaccharide, but did not block Kupffer cell-mediated stimulation in the absence of lipopolysaccharide. The data suggest that Kupffer cells can stimulate and inhibit hepatocyte protein synthesis by independent mechanisms. Kupffer cells may be important regulators of hepatocellular function in health and disease.\r"

Median nocturnal acid output (mmol/10 h) decreased during treatment to 11.6 (range 0.4-26.7) compared with pretreatment value of 39.4 (9.8-91.2); median acid inhibition 77% (p less than 0.01) which was strongest between 24:00 and 04:00 h. Two days after discontinuing treatment, nocturnal acid output increased to 74.1 (11-181). Compared with the pretreatment value this represents median rebound hypersecretion of 77% (p less than 0.05), caused by increased H+ concentration and volume of secretion. Overall median daytime intragastric pH (09:00-21:00 h) was unchanged on the final day of treatment and two days after completing therapy, compared with the pretreatment values. Fasting serum gastrin measured between 09:30 and 10:00 h and the integrated gastrin response to an OXO breakfast taken out at 10:00 h were also similar during and after treatment, compared with pretreatment values. The rebound nocturnal hypersecretion may be relevant to the high ulcer relapse rates after stopping H2 receptor antagonists.\r"

In coeliac disease there is a decreased absorption of small molecules and paradoxically increased absorption of large molecules. The simultaneous administration of cellobiose and mannitol as two probe molecules allows the permeability of the small bowel mucosa to be studied, eliminating extraneous factors such as gastric emptying, and incomplete urine collection. One thousand and ten patients presenting to a gastroenterology clinic with symptoms, signs, or biochemical indices compatible with coeliac disease had a Ce/Ma test. Eight hundred and seventeen had a normal test and of these 197 had a jejunal biopsy showing 148 normal mucosa, two coeliac disease, 43 non-specific abnormalities, four giardiasis. One hundred and ninety three had an abnormal test; of these 132 had a jejunal biopsy showing 62 normal mucosa, 48 coeliac disease, and 22 other abnormalities. Considering those who had jejunal biopsies, the sensitivity of the test for coeliac disease is 96%, specificity 70%, the predictive value of the positive 36%, and predictive value of the negative 99%. Eleven per cent of the patients with a 'false positive' test had abnormalities in the jejunal biopsy or a diagnosis which could explain the abnormal permeability.\r"

  ".W": "The present experiments were designed to study the effect of chronic ethanol consumption on endotoxin toxicity. The intravenous injection of endotoxin produced a more pronounced increase of serum AST and ALT activities in chronic ethanol-fed rats, when compared to controls. The activities of hepatic mitochondrial enzymes, succinate dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidase, were also distinctly decreased by endotoxin treatment in chronic ethanol-fed rats. Consistent with these biochemical alterations, light and electron microscopic examinations revealed severe liver injury after endotoxin injection in chronic ethanol-fed rats. Furthermore, the increase of blood BUN and creatinine levels accompanied by the degeneration of the renal tubulus and slight infiltration of neutrophils into the glomerule were produced by endotoxin treatment and were more conspicuous in chronic ethanol-fed rats than controls. Therefore, the biochemical and histological evidence indicates that endotoxin markedly potentiates organ injury after chronic ethanol consumption. In addition, a more pronounced decrease in blood antithrombin III activity accompanied by an increase in fibrin degradation product level in blood was recognized in chronic ethanol-fed rats receiving endotoxin, when compared to controls receiving endotoxin. This increase of blood fibrin degradation product level correlated well with the decrease of antithrombin III activity (r = -0.6116; p less than 0.005). These findings of blood antithrombin III activity and fibrin degradation product level indicate that the coagulation-fibrinolysis system is more activated by endotoxin treatment after chronic ethanol consumption. Furthermore, the activation of the coagulation-fibrinolysis system was well correlated with biochemical and histological alterations representing hepatorenal involvement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We tested the hypothesis that disturbed follicular development and disturbed luteal progesterone (P4) secretion are associated with reduced gonadotropin secretion in the early follicular phase by measuring pulsatile LH and FSH secretion at that time in 53 normally menstruating women. Three groups of women were identified on the basis of serum sex steroid concentrations (measured daily throughout the cycle) and luteal phase length. Group A (n = 27) had normal ovarian hormone secretion with peak serum estradiol (E2) concentrations of 440 pmol/L or more, peak serum P4 concentrations of 19 nmol/L or more, and luteal phase length of 9 days or more. Group B (n = 16) had normal peak serum E2 values, but peak serum P4 values less than 19 nmol/L and/or luteal phase length less than 9 days. Group C (n = 10) had peak serum E2 values below 440 pmol/L. Risk factors for the disturbances found in groups B and C were exercise and/or intermittent dieting. Compared to group A, both groups B and C had reduced mean serum LH concentrations (3.1 +/- 1.5 vs. 2.3 +/- 1.4 and 2.0 +/- 1.0 IU/L; P less than 0.05) and reduced LH pulse frequencies (5.2 +/- 2.1 vs. 3.5 +/- 1.8 and 3.3 +/- 2.3 pulses/12 h; P less than 0.02). LH amplitude was similar in all 3 groups. Mean serum FSH concentrations were slightly but not significantly lower in group C. We conclude that reduced gonadotropin secretion during the follicular phase may indeed affect E2 and P4 secretion at later stages of the menstrual cycle. The patterns of alteration associated with disturbed E2 and P4 secretion in normally menstruating women are similar to those that occur in women with hypothalamic amenorrhea.\r"

In six normal men, both Met-GH infusions increased plasma FFA levels, but did not alter the circulating levels of somatostatin, insulin-like growth factor I, insulin, glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides. The Met-GH infusions did cause a dose-related inhibition of GHRH-induced GH release. These data indicate that it is possible to maintain constant serum GH levels by means of constant Met-GH infusions at different infusion rates, and that GH inhibits its own release.\r"

  ".U": "89234473\r", 
  ".W": "Considerable controversy still exists concerning the role of progesterone in the initiation of the midcycle gonadotropin surge in humans. We, therefore, carried out a prospective randomized study to determine the potential of progesterone to initiate a gonadotropin surge and the acute effects of a potent progesterone antagonist (RU 486) on follicular phase gonadotropin secretion in normal women. The women underwent frequent blood sampling for 4 in the midfollicular (day 6) or late follicular phase (day 10). They then received either progesterone (10 mg, im) or RU 486 (10 or 100 mg, orally), and blood sampling was continued for an additional 8 h. Four women received each of the drug regimens in the early follicular phase, and four received each regimen in the late follicular phase. Two additional women were studied as control subjects at each stage of the cycle. Progesterone administration in the mid- and late follicular phases resulted in an acute increase in plasma LH and FSH concentrations, and the increases correlated with the base line plasma estradiol concentrations (P less than 0.05). In contrast to progesterone, the women who received RU 486 in the mid- and late follicular phases had a reduction in plasma LH and FSH concentrations after drug administration. The response in the mid-follicular phase was considerably less than that in the late follicular phase, and the extent of the response correlated with the baseline plasma estradiol concentrations (P less than 0.005). The changes were similar in response to both RU 486 doses. We conclude that progesterone can initiate a gonadotropin surge in the late follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. The inhibitory effect of the progesterone antagonist RU 486 suggests that a positive feedback mechanism involving progesterone may be influential some time before the surge onset.\r"

Sixty two (82%) lymphomas showed aberrant phenotypes, and four main categories were distinguished as follows: (i) lack of one or several pan-T cell antigens (49, 64% of the cases); (ii) loss of both the CD4 and CD8 antigens (11, 15% of the cases); (iii) coexpression of the CD4 and CD8 antigens (13, 17% of the cases); and (iv) expression of the CD1 antigen (eight, 11% of the cases). No correlation was seen between the occurrence of aberrant phenotypes and the histological subtype. It is concluded that the demonstration of an aberrant phenotype is a valuable supplement to histological assessment in the diagnosis of peripheral T cell lymphomas. It is recommended that the panel of monoclonal antibodies against T cell differentiation antigens should be fairly large, as apparently any antigen may be lost in the process of malignant transformation.\r"

Because intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is a ligand for LFA-1, we studied the cellular expression of ICAM-1, as well as two other IFN-gamma-inducible antigens, (HLA) human lymphocyte antigens DR and DQ, in both normal and diseased skin. The modulation of these cell surface antigens by IFN-gamma and TNF with the use of short-term organ cultures of skin was compared with isolated keratinocytes grown in a conventional tissue culture system. While in normal skin, keratinocytes did not express HLA-DR, DQ, or ICAM-1, when organ cultures were supplemented with IFN-gamma, rapid induction of keratinocyte ICAM-1 expression occurred after 24 hours; HLA-DR but not DQ expression occurred after 48 hours. TNF also induced keratinocyte ICAM-1 expression (although to a lesser degree than IFN-gamma) but did not induce either keratinocyte HLA-DR or DQ expression. There was good correlation of keratinocyte expression of ICAM-1 and HLA-DR by IFN-gamma and TNF when the epidermis of the organ culture system was compared with the isolated keratinocytes grown in tissue culture. The presence of intraepidermal lymphocytes correlated extremely well with keratinocyte ICAM-1 expression but not with keratinocyte HLA-DR expression in psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, lichen planus, and mycosis fungoides. The intensity of endothelial cell expression of ICAM-1 correlated with the degree of dermal inflammation. We conclude that IFN-gamma, once produced by activated T lymphocytes in the dermis, may be of importance in lymphocyte trafficking in the epidermis by the induction of keratinocyte ICAM-1 expression. The use of the short-term organ culture system, in which there is inducible ICAM-1 expression, provides an experimental bridge between purely in vitro and in vivo investigations to further our understanding of the molecular basis for lymphocyte apposition to keratinocytes in the skin.\r"

  ".W": "Interferons are a large family of proteins and glycoproteins, naturally occurring or artificially produced by recombinant biotechnology. Their antiviral, antiproliferative, antitumoral, and immunomodulatory activities are induced by alterations in cell metabolism after binding to specific membrane receptors. Interferons have been used for the treatment of viral papillomas (e.g., verruca vulgaris and condyloma acuminatum), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated Kaposi's sarcoma and cutaneous tumors (e.g., melanoma, cutaneous T cell lymphoma, and basal cell carcinoma), and inflammatory dermatoses (e.g., Behcet's syndrome and psoriatic arthropathy). Clinical trials have been performed worldwide with various regimens and have not always led to conclusive results. In our experience long-term therapy with high doses of subcutaneously injected, recombinant interferon-alpha-2a in patients with HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma induces a remission or stabilization of the disease. In malignant melanoma a low response rate is obtained in metastatic disease with the use of interferon as a single therapeutic agent. Combined with other antitumor agents, however, interferon seems to be a useful drug. Excellent control of Behcet's disease has been obtained, and the treatment of condylomata acuminata has been effective.\r"

  ".W": "When 2 mm punch biopsy specimens of normal skin are incubated with gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), the keratinocytes are induced to express intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Lymphocytes and monocytes that express lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) bind to cultured keratinocytes expressing ICAM-1. We have developed an in vitro adherence assay using frozen sections of normal skin that have been incubated with IFN-gamma, and then overlaid by peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes. Although peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes do not bind to the epidermal keratinocytes of untreated skin sections, after exposure of the skin to IFN-gamma the peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes prominently bind to the epidermal keratinocytes that express ICAM-1. The binding by peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes is increased approximately twofold by activation with phorbol ester treatment. The temperature dependence and kinetics of this adherence reaction reveal no binding at 8 degrees C, good binding at 24 degrees C, and optimal binding at 37 degrees C, reaching a maximal extent by 60 minutes. The adherence reaction is blocked either by pretreating the peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes with LFA-1 antibody or the IFN-gamma-exposed skin specimen with ICAM-1 antibody. The immunophenotypic analysis of the adherent peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes to epidermal keratinocytes revealed that most cells activated by 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate are T lymphocytes, with CD8+ T cells binding slightly better than CD4+ T cells, with a smaller population of monocytes. These results provide additional support for a role of LFA-1, ICAM-1, and IFN-gamma in modulating keratinocyte-lymphocyte interactions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Each subject had eight tests in a randomized order, four EX and four HY challenges, each preceded by the double-blind inhalation of either a placebo, 200 micrograms of S, 80 micrograms of I, or 4 mg of C. This study demonstrated that the three drugs protected against the two types of challenges in almost all subjects. Although we observed a large interindividual variability in the airway response to the challenges, there was no statistically significant difference in the mean percent protection after HY or EX challenges when these challenges were preceded by S, I, or C (p greater than 0.05). Moreover, for EX- and HY-induced bronchospasm, the mean percent protection afforded by the three medications was in the same order (S greater than I greater than C), although the protective effect against EX-induced was weaker than against HY-induced bronchospasm. This suggests that hyperosmolarity, although it may not be the sole factor involved, plays a role in EX-induced bronchospasm.\r"

Six atopic subjects with asthma and with late asthmatic responses (N = 5) and postallergen reduction in a provocative concentration of methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) (N = 6) were studied. Sustained-release theophylline (Theo-Dur; Astra Pharmaceuticals Canada, Ltd., Mississauga, Canada), 300 mg, and placebo were administered single-blind twice daily for eight doses up to 1 hour before allergen inhalation; cromolyn sodium, 10 mg, was administered in a single dose 10 minutes before allergen inhalation on another day as a \"positive control.\" Mean theophylline levels were in the low therapeutic range, 57 +/- 17 and 58 +/- 13 mumol/L 1 and 8 hours after the last tablet. The FEV1 was 7% and 9% greater after the seventh and eighth doses of theophylline versus placebo (p less than 0.05).

There was a 40% (p = 0.06) reduction in early asthmatic fall in FEV1 and a 25% (not significant) reduction in late FEV1 fall when theophylline was compared to placebo. Theophylline did not influence the geometric mean allergen-induced fall in methacholine PC20 delta log PC20; this was true individually in five of the six subjects. By contrast, cromolyn sodium inhibited all aspects of the allergen response completely.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this report, we show that at least five different species of Mycoplasma are capable of inducing class II MHC expression on macrophages. We have observed significant induction of class II MHC surface expression on the myelomonocytic cell line, WEHI-3, as early as 24 h after deliberate infection of cultures, reaching maximal levels by 4 days. This induction was also apparent at the mRNA level as assessed by Northern blot analysis by using A alpha, E alpha, and A beta probes. However, unlike many other previously described MHC-inducing agents, mycoplasmas failed to induce class I MHC expression at either the cell surface or mRNA levels. Kinetic analysis revealed that induction of class II mRNA by mycoplasmas was slower than induction by IFN-gamma requiring 24 h rather than 8 h for significant increases to be noted. Induction by mycoplasmas does not require the presence of live organisms and remains active after heat treatment of 90 degrees C for 30 min. We have also demonstrated that mycoplasma infection of primary bone marrow macrophage cultures leads to the induction of both class I and class II genes and, as in the case of WEHI-3, this induction does not require the presence of live organisms. These data indicate that several Mycoplasma species have the capacity to induce class II MHC expression in WEHI-3 and both class I and class II MHC expression in bone marrow macrophage cultures in the absence of any T cell products.\r"

This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of rIL-1 beta, -2, -3, -4 and -6, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF on basophils from 16 donors and the amount of histamine released was compared with that by partially purified mononuclear cell-derived histamine-releasing factor (HRF) and anti-IgE. We found that only IL-3 and GM-CSF at relatively high doses (50 to 500 ng/ml) released small amounts of histamine (3 to 14%) from two allergic donors. In contrast, both HRF and anti-IgE released significant amounts of histamine from all donors. Other cytokines did not release any measurable quantity of histamine. Simultaneous addition of several cytokines to the basophils also failed to release histamine. IL-3, GM-CSF, and IL-1 can also release histamine at lower concentrations (less than 5 ng/ml) when incubated with basophils in the presence of D2O. Basophils from 6 out of 13 allergic donors released histamine in response to IL-3, whereas three donors responded to IL-1 beta and two responded to GM-CSF. The results of this study demonstrated that although IL-3 and GM-CSF release small amounts of histamine only from a select group of allergic patients, mononuclear cell-derived HRF is more potent in their action and release histamine from normals as well as allergic patients.\r"

For SEM, visualization of gold particles was enhanced by the silver enhancement technique and by backscattered electron imaging. Binding studies revealed distinct labeling of microvilli-bearing cells after incubation with at least 10 U/ml IFN-gamma/Au, whereas cells with a smooth surface showed substantially lower labeling. After application of higher IFN-gamma (greater than 200 U/ml) concentrations, labeling intensity remained constant, which is consistent with the concentration of radiolabeled IFN-gamma required for saturating receptors on Raji cells. The specificity of IFN-gamma/Au binding was demonstrated by complete displacement with unlabeled IFN-gamma and by partial inhibition of labeling with a monoclonal anti-IFN-gamma R antibody. Thus, colloidal gold represents a valuable tag for visualizing the interaction of IFN-gamma with its receptor. Internalization of IFN-gamma/Au was initiated by accumulation of gold particles in coated pits which occurred within 10 min after warming of Raji cells. Additional incubation at 37 degrees C (up to 2 h) led to the appearance of gold particles in endocytic vesicles and lysosomes. Thus, our studies indicate that IFN-gamma/Au enters the Raji cells via the typical endocytotic pathway.\r"

The expression of a cross-reactive Id on naturally occurring antibodies against several carbohydrate Ag suggests that these antibodies may participate in an Id network. We also reported previously that BALB/c mice have naturally occurring anti-3-FL antibodies and respond well to immunization against this determinant, whereas C57BL/6 mice do neither. To examine the role of the Igh-C allotype in the regulation of the anti-3-FL response, we studied congenic strains of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. Both congenic strains produced anti-3-FL antibodies in response to immunization, but only C.B-20 mice exhibited naturally occurring antibodies. These data suggest that the naturally occurring and elicited antibody responses against 3-FL are differentially regulated.\r"

The studies demonstrated that there is no apparent genetic restriction of the capacity to develop protective immunity against a large sporozoite challenge after immunization with irradiation-attenuated P. berghei sporozoites; that the Th response to (Asp-Pro-Ala-Pro-Pro-Asn-Ala-Asn)n, the predominant protective B epitope on the P. berghei CS protein, is genetically restricted and regulated by Class II genes (I-Ab) and by genes in the Class I region (H-2Dk) or telomeric to this region; and that this restriction can be overcome by immunization with a r protein including the entire P. berghei CS protein. The results support the development of full length human CS protein vaccines to take advantage of all potential T epitopes on this protein.\r"

  ".W": "The N-propionylated group B meningococcal polysaccharide mimics a unique bactericidal epitope on the surface of group B meningococci and Escherichia coli K1. This was confirmed when both the above organisms were able to absorb the bactericidal antibodies from a mouse-anti-N-propionylated group B meningococcal polysaccharide-tetanus toxoid conjugate serum. By using affinity columns it was possible to divide the conjugate antiserum into three distinct populations of both group B polysaccharide cross-reactive and non-cross-reactive antibodies, one of which contained most of the bactericidal activity. The cross-reactive (IgG1) antibodies were absorbed by an affinity column in which the group B polysaccharide was linked to the solid support by a long spacer arm, thereby isolating a population of non-cross-reactive (IgG1) antibodies. Surprisingly the above column also retained another population of non-cross-reactive (IgG2a) and (IgG2b) antibodies which contained most of the bactericidal activity. These latter antibodies were not absorbed by a similar group B polysaccharide-affinity column in which a short spacer arm was employed. Thus the above experiments not only effected a separation of highly bactericidal antibodies but also provided evidence that the long spacer arm is functional in the binding of the bactericidal antibodies to the affinity column. This indicates that the bactericidal epitope is mimicked by the group B polysaccharide in the presence of the long spacer arm, which supports the hypothesis that the epitope is polysaccharide-associated and is probably intermolecular in nature.\r"

Lymphocyte proliferation following stimulation with separated Ag was found also in five subjects who failed to respond to the whole soluble extracts. Stimulatory synthetic peptides were identified for the 65 kDa protein Ag. This technique has permitted the screening of the T cell immune repertoire for the identification of the immunodominant Ag which merit further purification and molecular characterization.\r"

Immunologically mediated modulation was noted in animals receiving splenocytes derived from chronically infected mice. Both a reduction in portal pressure and hepatic granuloma areas were noted. Hepatic collagen content but not glycosaminoglycan content was reduced by the administration of either lymphoid cells or serum from chronically infected mice. The isotypic profile of hepatic interstitial collagens was modulated by both the administration of serum or lymphoid cells. Augmented levels of type III collagen was noted on administration of serum derived from chronically infected mice, whereas type I collagen levels were relatively elevated on administration of splenocytes. The data indicate that immunomodulation of inflammation and hepatic fibrosis can occur in murine schistosomiasis but that fibrotic events and inflammatory processes are independently modulated.\r"

  ".U": "89235174\r", 
  ".W": "By establishing hybridomas from two distinct surface IgM+ splenic B cell populations, Ly-1 B cells and \"conventional\" (Ly-1-) B cells, we found that the Ly-1 B population includes a 30 to 70 times higher frequency (1 to 2%) of cells with specificity for bromelain treated autologous red blood cells (anti-BrMRBC) when compared with conventional B cells (0.03%). We cloned and sequenced the V genes encoding anti-BrMRBC antibody from two hybridomas made with Ly-1 B cells sorted from the spleen of SM/J mice. The VH sequence (for both) is identical with the previously reported sequence associated with this specificity and belongs to a new VH gene family. This gene family, defined here as VH11, has only two members and is the predominant VH rearranged in a collection of Ly-1 B derived anti-BrMRBC hybridomas, always in association with a single VL gene (a member of the V kappa 9 family). Furthermore, analysis of hybridomas made with Ly-1 B cells sorted from the peritoneum reveals a yet higher increased frequency of VH11-encoded anti-BrMRBC specificity (30%). This variation in frequency of anti-BrMRBC in the Ly-1 population depending on location, together with the repeated association of VH11 with a particular V kappa gene suggest that antigen driven selection is (at least in part) responsible for the biased V gene expression seen in this population. Furthermore, a mechanism that might contribute to biased expression, preferential rearrangement due to close proximity to J (as seen in pre-B lines), is excluded by localization of VH11 5' to several of the more J-proximal families (Q52, 7183).\r"

These results indicated that VH to VHDJH rearrangement was not suppressed in mu-chain producing cells and that the DJH complexes still remained active in the recombination to VH segments after the loss of mu-chain expression. Our results may also suggest that VH to DJH rearrangement, but not VH to VHDJH rearrangement, is suppressed in mu-chain producing cells to maintain allelic exclusion. Our cell differentiation system should continue to be valuable for elucidating the mechanism of suppression and associated implications regarding allelic exclusion.\r"

We report that human MHC class II gene transcription and mRNA stability require the synthesis of short-lived proteins which undergo rapid intracellular turnover. We found, in fact, that the amount of MHC class II mRNA produced by human B lymphoma or B lymphoblastoid cell lines abruptly decreased upon cultivation of cells in the presence of cycloheximide, a potent inhibitor of protein synthesis. Measurements of the rate of mRNA transcription in nuclei isolated from treated cells indicated that a cycloheximide-sensitive activator protein is needed to allow MHC class II mRNA transcription initiation. Likewise, comparison of mRNA turnover rate in cells treated with actinomycin D, an inhibitor of RNA synthesis, and in cycloheximide-treated cells shows that a post-transcriptional factor is required to stabilized human MHC class II mRNA by a factor of 8- to 10-fold in B cells. These results indicate that, along with the trans- and cis-acting factors required for transcriptional control, a series of signals must exist in B cells which implement a post-transcriptional level of regulation of MHC class II gene expression in B cells.\r"

The thymocytes on day 7 after irradiation were composed of a large number of CD4+CD8+ blast-like cells and a relatively high proportion of CD4-CD8- cells (15 to 25%) but few CD3highCD4+CD8-/CD4-CD8+ cells. Approximately 22% of the CD4-CD8- cells were CD3high and -27% of the CD3highCD4-CD8- cells (-6% of whole CD4-CD8- cells) were F23.1+. The thymocytes on day 7 expressed a large amount of gamma- and delta-chain gene transcripts but reduced levels of alpha- and beta-chain gene transcripts. The V gene repertoire of 18 functional beta-chain cDNA derived from the thymocytes on day 7 was compared with those of 20 functional beta-chain cDNA derived from the thymocytes on day 14 which were composed of a large number of CD3lowCD4+CD8+ small-sized cells and a small number of CD3highCD4+CD8- cells. It is noteworthy that the distribution of V beta genes expressed in the thymocytes on day 7 was much the same as that in the thymocytes on day 14 but significantly different from that in normal BALB/c thymocytes as previously described. Interestingly, neither V beta 8.1 nor V beta 6 genes, which are important for recognition of the product of the Mlsa locus, was detected in these two cDNA libraries. These results suggest that clonal selection of TCR V beta repertoire, irrespective of positive or negative selection, appears to occur at the early stage of T cell differentiation, i.e., on the blast-like CD4+CD8+ thymocytes.\r"

The growth of CD4+ cell lines allowed a further evaluation and appreciation of functional subtypes within this group. Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells have been characterized as well. The routine and continuous culture of Ag-nonspecific CD8+ Ts cells has been difficult to achieve. We have found that CD8+ T cells that suppress T cell proliferation and lack cytotoxic activity against T cells can be routinely obtained from PWM or PHA-stimulated PBMC. Continuous culture of T cell blasts from PWM or PHA-stimulated PBMC resulted in the growth of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. These lines developed suppressor cell activity within 7 days after stimulation with PWM and 3 to 4 wk after stimulation with PHA. Concomitant with the development of suppressor activity was the loss of CD4+ T cells resulting in homogeneous lines of CD8+ suppressor cells. These cell lines have been maintained in continuous culture for greater than 6 mo by addition of rIL-2 twice weekly and restimulation with feeder cells and PHA every 2 wk. Activity of these cell lines was relatively resistant to irradiation or treatment with mitomycin C. Both cell lines suppressed proliferation of autologous or heterologous CD4+ T cells stimulated with PWM, OKT3, or tetanus toxoid but failed to suppress proliferation of CD4+ T cells in a mixed lymphocyte reaction. CD4+ T cells stimulated with PWM produced equivalent amounts of IL-2 in the presence or absence of Ts cells but failed to express the IL-2R (TAC) on their surface in the presence of Ts cells. By contrast, CD4+ T cell lines or cytotoxic CD8+ T cell lines failed to suppress proliferation of CD4+ T cells. With these results we describe methods for the generation and continuous culture of Ag-nonspecific CD8+ Ts cells and define some of their properties. These cells lines should be helpful in further elucidating the functional and phenotypic repertoire of CD8+ Ts cells.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanisms that regulate thymocyte proliferation and differentiation within the thymus are still poorly understood. As a novel approach to analyzing these problems, we have used a retroviral vector to insert oncogenes into fetal thymic cells, and construct a library of thymic cell lines. Infection with a double promoter recombinant retrovirus containing the v-Ha-ras and v-myc oncogenes resulted in the apparent immortalization of a range of cell lines derived from 13- and 14-day murine fetal thymus, and expressing both v-Ha-ras and v-myc mRNA at high levels. Cell lines were established from untreated thymic lobes (group 1), deoxyguanosine-treated lobes (group 2), and in the presence of IL-2 (group 3). Cell lines with a wide range of surface phenotypes were established. Group 1 were adherent cell lines expressing many antigens, including Mac-1, FcR, and Ia. Group 2 were also adherent cells but expressed very few Ag. Group 3 were IL-2-dependent lymphoid-like non-adherent cells, with a null or early thymocyte-like phenotype. None demonstrated full rearrangement and expression of TCR alpha-, beta-, or gamma-genes, although cell lines in group 2 expressed short beta and those in group 3, short beta and gamma gene transcripts. This library of immortalized cell lines appears to represent several types of stromal cell and early thymocyte precursors present in 13- and 14-day fetal thymus. These cell lines should prove invaluable in reconstructing the environment of the intact fetal thymic lobe, to study the cellular interactions that appear to govern thymocyte proliferation, development, and selection of Ag reactivity.\r"

Both target cell- and anti-TCR mAb-induced granule exocytosis were markedly inhibited by CsA. In addition, marked inhibition of PMA and calcium ionophore (A23187) induced granule exocytosis was produced by CsA suggesting that the inhibitory effects of CsA on granule exocytosis involve biochemical events after protein kinase C activation and increases in intracellular free Ca2+. CsA had no inhibitory effects on TCR-mediated phosphatidylinositol metabolism. The inhibitory effects of CsA were not mediated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitory pathway and no effect of CsA on the Ca2+-induced binding of calmodulin to calmodulin-binding proteins could be demonstrated. CsA was also a potent inhibitor of IgE receptor-mediated exocytosis in rat basophil leukemia cells. CsA had no effect on receptor-mediated phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis; 400 ng/ml CsA resulted in a 90% inhibition of serotonin release but had no effect on phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis. These results indicate that CsA may inhibit some common event in Ca2+-dependent secretory cells. Taken together, these results suggest that CsA does not inhibit signal transduction but rather interferes with the biochemical events in the later stages of Ca2+-dependent reactions that follow the binding of calmodulin to cytoskeletal or cytoplasmic calmodulin binding proteins.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously described a variant murine CTL clone that in contrast to all other clones tested, exhibited a novel capacity to produce IFN-gamma in response to IL-2. This alternative pathway of IFN-gamma induction differed from the conventional TCR complex-mediated pathway in that it was independent of elevated intracellular Ca2+ and insensitive to cyclosporine A. We report here the presence of an analogous pathway in the majority of T lymphocyte clones tested, when these clones are stimulated with IL-2 in the presence of syngeneic or third-party splenocytes. The accessory function of splenocytes in this alternative pathway is mediated by the MAC-1+ subpopulation and apparently involves cell-cell contact. However, the structure with which the MAC-1 antibody reacts probably is not involved directly. No involvement of Ag or the TCR for Ag could be demonstrated in this alternative pathway of lymphokine induction. The array of lymphokines induced by this alternative pathway is only a subset of those induced by antigenic stimulation. Finally, as with the previously described variant clone, IL-2-mediated induction of IFN-gamma production by the normal T lymphocyte clones is independent of normal extracellular Ca2+ levels and insensitive to cyclosporine A. Thus, this alternative pathway of lymphokine induction apparently constitutes a distinct signaling pathway in cloned T lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "IL-1 and TNF induced concentration-related increases in the synthesis of factor B, C3, and IFN-beta 2/IL-6 in human skin fibroblasts. Effects of both stimuli were apparent with concentrations as low as 0.1 ng/ml and maximal responses were observed between 1 and 10 ng/ml; only for IL-1 induction of IFN-beta 2/IL-6 was there a further increase in response up to 100 ng/ml. For factor B and C3, maximal increases induced by IL-1 and TNF were similar: 119- and 109-fold for factor B and 15-fold and 11-fold for C3, respectively. Although both IL-1 and TNF increase synthesis of factor B and C3 in hepatocytes, the increases observed in fibroblasts were approximately 50- and 8-fold more for factor B and C3, respectively. Neither protein synthesis nor mRNA for IFN-beta 2/IL-6 was present in HepG2 cells either before or after stimulation with IL-1 or TNF. In contrast to the similarities between the effects of IL-1 and TNF on synthesis of factor B, C3, and IFN-beta 2/IL-6, only TNF increased synthesis of factor H. Because TNF induces membrane IL-1 in fibroblasts, it is possible to speculate that the effects of TNF on fibroblasts are due to induction of IL-1. An autocrine action of TNF through IL-1 is possible for TNF-induced synthesis of IFN-beta 2/IL-6, but the effects of TNF on synthesis of factor B, C3, and factor H indicated that TNF has effects on fibroblasts separate from IL-1. The effects of IL-1 and TNF on the synthesis of factor B and C3 in fibroblasts may be a part of an acute phase response occurring at a local level. However, the large responses in synthesis of factor B and C3 to IL-1 and TNF may suggest that factor B and C3 have a role, as yet undescribed, in tissues in addition to the role these proteins are known to play in inflammation.\r"

  ".W": "To explore the molecular basis for the ability of aggregated IgG to block the phagocytosis by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes of Con A-opsonized E and of nonopsonized Escherichia coli with mannose-binding adhesins, we examined specific aspects of the glycoprotein structure of both the 40- to 43-kDa receptor for the Fc portion of IgG (Fc gamma RII) and the 50- to 78-kDa receptor for the Fc portion of IgG (Fc gamma RIIIPMN) from human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Fc gamma RIIIPMN isolated by both mAb and ligand affinity chromatography, but not Fc gamma RII, binds Con A in Western blots. This binding is specifically inhibitable by alpha-methylmannoside. Digestion of Fc gamma RIIIPMN by recombinant endoglycosidase H, which is specific for high mannose-type (Con A-binding) oligosaccharides, alters the epitope recognized by mAb 3G8 in or near the IgG ligand-binding site of the receptor. Similarly, the ability of Fc gamma RIIIPMN to bind human IgG ligand is sensitive to endoglycosidase H digestion. Our data indicate that ligands other than the classical IgG opsonins can bind to human Fc gamma RIIIPMN per se through lectin-carbohydrate interactions. Furthermore, Fc gamma RIIIPMN contains a high mannose type oligosaccharide chain which contributes importantly to the integrity of the classical IgG ligand-binding site. Thus, specific glycosylations of the receptor are important for both classical and nonclassical engagement of Fc gamma RIII and may play a role in determining the properties of the ligand-binding site.\r"

The location of the intrachain disulfide loop within the CD8 beta-chain confirms its proposed structural homology to an IgV domain but no corresponding disulfide loop is present within the alpha-chain. The invariant IgV disulfide loop has been replaced by a unique, short loop involving an unusual cysteine which is conserved in the CD8 alpha-chains of man, mouse, and rat. Despite its lack of precedent in other Ig-related structures, this unusual disulfide loop can be parsimoniously accommodated into a modified domain which has retained the major features of the Ig structural motif.\r"

Despite the absence of detectable T cells in the patients blood, cell lines grew that carried the phenotype of mature activated T cells. TJF-2, the line established from blood, was characterized in detail. The concentration of ADA in TJF-2 cells was less than 1% of normal (3.2 U vs 413.0 U). Studies with pharmacologic inhibitors of ADA suggest that the residual adenosine deaminating activity of TJF-2 is from an enzyme distinct from true ADA, a nonspecific aminohydrolyase. Growth of TJF-2 cells was hypersensitive to inhibition by 2'-deoxyadenosine compared to normal T cells (ID50, 55 microM vs greater than 1000 microM). Analysis of 2'-deoxyadenosine-challenged cells showed that TJF-2 cells accumulated significant levels of deoxyadenosine triphosphate, whereas normal T cells did not unless they were also incubated with the ADA inhibitor deoxycoformycin. Southern and Northern blot analysis of these cells revealed a grossly intact ADA gene that produced a normal size ADA mRNA. Yet, despite ADA deficiency, cells of the TJF-2 line were otherwise indistinguishable from HTLV-I-transformed T cells derived from normal donors with respect to dependence on exogenous IL-2 for growth, clonal rearrangement patterns of TCR beta-chain genes, response to PHA, and rapid restoration of cellular volume after hypotonic challenge. The TJF-2 line thus represents a unique HTLV-I-transformed human T cell line exhibiting ADA deficiency and its expected metabolic consequences.\r"

  ".U": "89235221\r", 
  ".W": "We examined the interaction between IFN-gamma, LPS, and glucocorticoids on release of oxygen radicals by human monocytes cultured in vitro. After 48 h culture, monocytes released low amounts of superoxide anion (O2-) when stimulated by PMA or FMLP. Monocytes incubated with either IFN-gamma or LPS became \"primed\" and released greater amounts of O2- in response to stimuli. Monocytes incubated with hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, or prednisolone alone showed decreased release of O2-. Prednisone and progesterone, which are not active glucocorticoids, had no effect. When glucocorticoids were co-incubated with IFN-gamma or LPS, the effect of hydrocortisone and other active steroids was blocked, and the monocytes released high O2-. However, when monocytes were preincubated with hydrocortisone for 24 h before addition of IFN-gamma or LPS, priming for enhanced O2- production by LPS was partially inhibited whereas there was no effect on IFN-gamma priming. We suggest that IFN-gamma and LPS can block the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids, contributing to increased inflammation at tissue sites; however, the mechanism of this effect may differ for the two macrophage activators. To investigate the mechanisms of priming by IFN-gamma and LPS, we examined the effects of these agents and of hydrocortisone on secretion of IL-1 and TNF-alpha. Both IL-1 and TNF-alpha primed monocytes for enhanced release of O2- in response to PMA. LPS caused monocytes to secrete both IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha. LPS-induced secretion of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta was completely blocked by hydrocortisone, but the priming effect of LPS on O2- release was only partly blocked. IFN-gamma did not cause monocytes to secrete IL-1 beta or TNF-alpha, under our culture conditions (mononuclear cells cultured in Teflon in endotoxin-free modified Earle's salt solution without serum). Therefore, priming by LPS and IFN-gamma, and the inhibition of priming by glucocorticoids involve mechanisms that extend beyond regulation of secretion of IL-1 and TNF-alpha.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effects of various cytokines on alpha-thrombin-stimulated prostaglandin (PG) I2 production, von Willebrand factor (vWF) secretion, and platelet-activating factor (PAF) synthesis in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). A 24-h pretreatment with IL-1 beta doubled the low level of constitutive PGI2 production. In contrast, alpha-thrombin increased PGI2 production fivefold in untreated HUVEC. The most striking increase in PGI2 production was observed in IL-1 beta-treated HUVEC that were subsequently stimulated with thrombin. PGI2 production was two to three times greater than in untreated, thrombin-stimulated HUVEC and nearly eightfold greater than in IL-1 beta-treated but unstimulated HUVEC. Enhanced thrombin-stimulated PGI2 production was also observed in HUVEC pretreated with the related cytokines IL-1 alpha, TNF, or lymphotoxin. This cytokine effect was selective for PGI2 production because none of these cytokines altered either constitutive or thrombin-stimulated vWF secretion or PAF biosynthesis. IL-1 beta enhancement of thrombin-stimulated PGI2 production was concentration and time dependent and required protein synthesis. IL-1 beta pretreatment also enhanced PGI2 production in response to another agonist, histamine, and to exogenously added substrates, arachidonic acid or PGH2. Our results indicate that activation by IL-1 and related cytokines selectively primes endothelial cells for enhanced PGI2 production, but not vWF secretion or PAF synthesis, in response to thrombin and histamine. The evidence suggests that this effect is mediated through specific induction of biosynthetic enzymes for PGI2.\r"

There was no significant increase in the mean proliferative response to recombinant HB surface and core Ag (rHBsAg and rHBcAg), nor was IFN-gamma production elicited with rHBsAg in any group. In contrast, PBMC of HBeAg-positive and anti-HBe-positive CAH patients, and anti-hepatitis B \"e\" Ag (HBe)-positive ASC showed significantly enhanced IFN-gamma production in response to HBcAg, whereas those of HBeAg-positive ASC and anti-HBs-positive subjects did not respond to HBcAg. The maximal response was observed in a 5-day culture with 500 ng/ml of rHBcAg when assessed by stimulation index value. Monocytes did not demonstrate an increased suppressor or helper activity for IFN-gamma production in these patients. T cell subset fractionation revealed that CD4+ cells were main population of IFN-gamma production specific for HBcAg and CD8+ cells did not suppress IFN-gamma production of CD4+ cells. Furthermore, CD4+ cells of HBeAg-positive ASC generated lesser amounts of IFN-gamma than HBeAg-positive CAH patients did. These results show that the measurement of IFN-gamma production is useful to determine cellular immune response to HBV Ag and suggest that IFN-gamma production depends on the helper activity of CD4+ T cells sensitized to HBcAg.\r"

T. cruzi infection results in large increases of splenic RNA in the various homology families, and the numbers of activated CFU-B, reflecting the massive B lymphocyte responses. In acute phase, all nine families are expressed in roughly the same proportions as in normal mice, whereas in chronic infection, B cells expressing S107 and 7183 VH-genes might be preferentially stimulated. These results establish the polyclonal nature of the host response to T. cruzi infection.\r"

The sequencing of IgM autoantibodies from a leprosy patient revealed examples of recurrent use of V region gene segments in different autoantibodies from this patient and a previously studied patient with SLE. Moreover, several gene segments used in these autoantibodies show little alteration from germ-line sequences. mAb TH3, from a patient with leprosy, binds denatured DNA and poly(dT). The center of its H chain CDR35 has a sequence identical to that found previously in two anti-DNA antibodies from a lupus patient; these identities and their overlapping with two other published sequences define a human D-gene segment of approximately 25 nucleotides. Autoantibody TH9, from a leprosy patient, does not bind DNA. Its VH sequence has 87% identity with a VHI anti-DNA antibody, but differs from it markedly in the CDR1 region. TH9 also has a different H chain CDR3. The closely related JH4 or JH5 gene segments are expressed in five lupus or leprosy autoantibodies. In four of the antibodies, examples of V kappa 1, V kappa 3, or V kappa 4 and J kappa 2, or J kappa 5 segments were found. Two distinct leprosy-derived anti-DNA antibodies, 8E10 and TH3, share a completely identical V kappa sequence. This sequence differs in only two positions from that of a germ-line RF L chain gene. Several gene segments that are close to the germ line in sequence encode Ig V regions with autoantibody reactivity. These results provide a base line for determining whether these genes are precursors of more highly diversified antibodies that may be pathogenic in patients with SLE.\r"

  ".W": "The molecular basis for the defective expression of Ef alpha was determined by analysis of the 5' region of a full length Ef alpha gene. The gene was isolated from a genomic library prepared from the A.CA/SnDv mouse strain. DNA sequence analysis of the 5' portion of the Ef alpha gene, which encodes the 5' regulatory sequences and the signal peptide, revealed the presence of a stop codon in the exon encoding the signal peptide. The remainder of the sequences were highly related to sequences found in previously characterized, functional E alpha alleles. Previous studies indicate that the f allele is transcribed at rates comparable to the rates of functional alleles and that mRNA accumulates in the cytoplasm. Primer extension analysis demonstrated that Ef alpha transcripts initiate identically to the functional Ek alpha allele, mapping the defect in the Ef alpha gene 3' of the transcriptional initiation site. To determine whether the stop codon in the signal peptide was the only major defect in this gene, reciprocal chimeric genes were constructed in which the 5' regions, including the first exons, of the defective f allele and the functional k allele were exchanged. The hybrid genes were inserted into an SV40 promotor driven expression vector for cotransfection with an Ek beta gene. Surface I-E expression was demonstrated using I-E specific mAb in Cos-7 and L cell lines transfected with the hybrid gene consisting of the 5' region of the k allele and the 3' portion of the f allele. Therefore, the single stop codon present in the exon encoding the leader peptide of the Ef alpha gene appears to be the only defect preventing this gene from expressing a functional E alpha-chain.\r"

Five were derived from antibodies with the characteristics of natural polyreactive antibodies. Three were either monoreactive or bireactive. The most striking feature of the structure of these molecules was their utilization of VH families. Although three used the large VHIII family and one used the large VHI family, the other four used genes derived from two of the recently defined small human VH families VHIV and VHV. Three of the molecules represent VHIV expressed sequences and one is the first example of a VHV gene used in an antibody of defined specificity. The nucleotide sequences of some of the molecules were remarkably similar in their VH gene segments to previously described VH genes. The data suggest that natural autoantibodies may use a restricted portion of the VH repertoire, and, in addition, that some polyreactive antibodies may be germ line encoded. The implication of these findings for the origin and diversity of the human B cell repertoire is discussed.\r"

Using nuclear transcriptional analysis, we have investigated the transcriptional rates of the class II genes in the macrophage cell line WEHI-3, normal bone marrow-derived macrophages, L-929 cells, and two different B cell lymphoma lines. Kinetic analysis of class II transcription in IFN-gamma-treated WEHI-3 cells revealed a 4-h delay, followed by a rapid increase in transcription over the next 20 h. A significant basal level of class II transcription, apparent in bone marrow derived macrophages, was also further enhanced by IFN-gamma treatment. None of the class II genes were transcribed in L cells, whereas all class II genes were transcribed constitutively in the B cell lines. In both B cell lines and macrophages, the four class II genes were found to be transcribed at different rates from one another, but the only gene showing a consistent pattern in multiple experiments was A-alpha, always showing the highest rate. We also investigated the effect of protein synthesis inhibition on class II transcription. Cycloheximide treatment of WEHI-3 cells did not inhibit IFN-gamma-induced transcription of the class II genes within 8 h, suggesting that IFN-gamma acts on pre-existing trans-acting factors, rather than inducing their synthesis. In contrast, treatment of B cells with cycloheximide for 8 h significantly reduced class II transcription, suggesting that, in B cells, continuous synthesis of a labile trans-acting factor is required for constitutive expression. These data support the notion that class II expression in B cells is mediated by trans-acting factors distinct from those found in macrophages.\r"

Exposure to IFN-gamma induced high levels of class I Ag and reduced susceptibility to NK-mediated lysis. However, transfection with either HLA-A2, HLA-B27, or HLA-B27 with beta 2m did not result in reduced susceptibility to NK cells. These transfectants expressed amounts of HLA class I Ag comparable to those in IFN-gamma-treated, untransfected cells. Transfection with the beta 2m gene or plasmid alone neither influenced levels of surface class I Ag nor resulted in reduced susceptibility to lysis by NK cells. Thus, the effects of IFN-gamma on NK susceptibility can be dissociated from the induction of class I Ag.\r"

  ".W": "Ultraviolet B radiation (UVB) elicits an increase in melanin production in mammalian skin. The mechanisms regulating this process are not understood, although it is well documented that there is an increase in the number of melanin-producing melanocytes. The melanotropins (MSH) are a family of peptides that increase the melanin content of melanocytes through an interaction with high affinity receptors. We have obtained evidence that the effects of UVB on melanogenesis may be mediated through an increase in MSH receptor activity on melanocytes. First, exposure of Cloudman S91 mouse melanoma cells to UVB resulted in increased binding of 125I-MSH to cells within 24 h. In five separate experiments, UVB-irradiated cultures displayed 2-10-fold increases in MSH binding capacity over that of unirradiated control cultures (optimum doses 10-20 mJ/cm2). Second, UVB and MSH potentiated one another in promoting cutaneous melanogenesis in both mice and guinea pigs. In the areas of guinea pig skin that received both UVB and MSH, there was a fivefold increase in active melanocytes/mm2 over the sum of active melanocytes/mm2 in areas receiving either MSH or UVB separately. Our results suggest that UVB light causes an increase in MSH receptor activity on cutaneous melanocytes, thus increasing cellular responsiveness to MSH. Implicit in this mechanism is a transduction of radiant energy into chemical energy during the process of UVB-induced melanogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Basement membranes found around tumor cells in nevocytic nevi, Spitz's nevi, and malignant melanomas were analyzed by electron microscopy and antibody staining for several basement membrane proteins. Nevocytic nevi and Spitz's nevi showed a distinct, occasionally discontinuous lamina densa regardless of whether they were located in junctional zones of the epidermis or within the dermis. All basement membranes around nests of aggregated nevus cells, however, lacked anchoring fibrils. This correlated with the absence of type VII collagen. In contrast, type IV collagen, laminin, and nidogen were present at the periphery of the nevus cell clusters in agreement with the presence of an intact lamina densa. Aggregated tumor cells in malignant melanomas were bordered by a lamina densa when located in a junctional position and lacked this structure when they had migrated into the dermis. This process was accompanied by a drastically reduced staining for collagen type IV and nidogen, whereas laminin was still detectable. Anchoring fibrils and their molecular correlate, type VII collagen, were consistently absent. These observations demonstrate major alterations in the composition of basement membranes around malignant melanomas, which can be an important factor for the invasive growth and formation of metastases of these tumors.\r"

Our results show that 24-72 h treatment of confluent fibroblast cultures with IL 1-alpha or beta or TNF-alpha or beta causes concentration (1 to 1 X 10(4) U/ml) dependent increases in collagen, glycosaminoglycan, and collagenase activity production, but decreases in fibronectin production. In contrast, treatment with IL 2 and GM-CSF had no effect on fibroblast functions. The data show that IL 1-alpha and beta and TNF-alpha and beta differentially regulate fibroblast functions, and that increases in catabolic functions like collagenase activity production are more than tenfold greater than increases in anabolic functions like collagen production. When these results are considered along with other reports, they suggest that IL 1 and TNF may play predominately a catabolic role in situ during dermal fibrotic responses by directly inhibiting fibronectin production and indirectly causing the degradation of collagen and glycosaminoglycan by significantly increasing dermal fibroblast elaboration of collagenase and proteoglycanase activities.\r"

The specificity of the immunostaining was confirmed by several tests, including preincubation of the antibody with carcinogen modified DNA or related molecules, and digestion of the sections with DNase. Subcutaneous injection of 4HAQO dissolved in isotonic solution into an isolated portion of the mouse skin clamped off with ring-shaped forceps resulted in dose-dependent generation of DNA adducts in the nuclei of epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and panniculus carnosus cells. BP-DNA adducts could also be similarly detected dose-dependently in the nuclei of skin cells after local application of BP-DE. Nuclear staining was absent in animals injected with isotonic solution alone, and the intensity of staining correlated well with the level of unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) demonstrated autoradiographically after treatment with 4HAQO. Killing of mice at different time points after a single injection of 4HAQO revealed a gradual decrease in the intensity of the staining. Thus the postulated generation and repair of DNA adducts can be followed at the cellular level using the presently described method.\r"

Subsequent to the understanding of intrinsic factors controlling both processes, we found our selective melanoma neutron capture therapy (NCT) using 10B-dopa (melanin substrate) analogue, 10B1-p-boronophenylalanine (10B1-BPA), followed by 10B(n, alpha)7Li reaction, induced by essentially harmless thermal neutrons, which releases energy of 2.33 MeV to 14 mu, the diameter of melanoma cells. In vitro/in vivo radiobiological analysis revealed the highly enhanced melanoma killing effect of 10B1-BPA. Chemical and prompt gamma ray spectrometry assays of 10B accumulated within melanoma cells after 10B1-BPA administration in vitro and in vivo show high affinity, e.g., 10B melanoma/blood ratio of 11.5. After successfully eradicating melanoma transplanted into hamsters with NCT, we advanced to preclinical studies using spontaneously occurring melanoma in Duroc pig skin. We cured three melanoma cases, 4.6 to 12 cm in diameter, by single neutron capture treatment. Complete disappearance of melanoma was obtained without substantial side effects. Acute and subacute toxicity as well as pharmacodynamics of 10B1-BPA have been studied in relation to therapeutic dosage requirements. Clinical radiation dosimetry using human phantom has been carried out. Further preclinical studies using human melanoma transplanted into nude mouse have been a useful model for obtaining optimal results for each melanoma type. We recently treated the first human melanoma patient with our NCT, using essentially the method for Duroc pig melanoma, and obtained similar regression time course leading to cure.\r"

The authors also refer briefly to the current situation of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in Japan. Many BRMs have been used in treatment of melanoma, e.g., IFN, IL-2, TNFs, BCG, MY-1 (DNA extracted from BCG), WPG (CWs of Bifidobacterium infantis, ATCC 15697), OK-432 (Picibanil, Streptococcus pyogenes preparation), bestatin, and forphenicinol. Some of these have completed clinical trials, while others are still undergoing clinical testing. Among IFN-alpha, beta, and gamma, intralesional administration of natural IFN-beta was found to be more effective than IFN-alpha for metastatic skin melanoma, the survival time of patients being prolonged by the administration of IFN-beta. IFN-gamma appeared to have lower efficacy than IFN-alpha and beta. The frequency of BRM application to melanoma treatment will increase. The authors foresee that combinations with radio- and/or other chemotherapy will be more common than the single use of a BRM, especially in the case of IFN.\r"

  ".U": "89235433\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor blocking has a protective effect on rabbit nephrotoxic nephritis (NTN). We examined whether arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism is altered in NTN and whether a PAF receptor antagonist has any influence on such changes. Rabbits injected with anti-glomerular basement membrane antiserum in the heterologous phase had a markedly increased glomerular thromboxane B2 (TxB2) production level, whereas no changes have been detected in glomerular 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). During the autologous phase of the disease, the glomerular TxB2 level was even higher than in the heterologous phase. The level of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha was significantly lower than normal, and the level of PGE2 was unchanged in respect to the basal values. The use of L-652,731 (a specific PAF receptor antagonist) reversed the abnormal generation of AA metabolites at glomerular level both in the heterologous and autologous phase of the disease. The effect of L-652,731 on AA metabolism is likely to be an indirect result of the PAF receptor blocking, because L-652,731 given to normal rabbits had no direct effect on glomerular AA metabolism. To assess whether the beneficial effect of L-652,731 in NTN is at least in part mediated by its capability of suppressing the excessive intrarenal synthesis of thromboxane A2 (TxA2), we compared the effect of L-652,731 with that of a selective TxA2-synthase inhibitor (FCE-22178). FCE-22178 ameliorated the morphologic expression of rabbit NTN and reduced function deterioration. The protective effect of L-652,731 on proteinuria in the autologous phase and on glomerular filtration rate in both phases was superior to that of FCE-22178. We conclude that an excessive intraglomerular synthesis of TxA2 occurs in rabbit NTN that can play a role in renal function deterioration. Both a specific PAF receptor antagonist and a TxA2-synthase inhibitor reduced the exaggerated TxA2 synthesis and favorably influenced the evolution of the disease.\r"

Adsorbable IgG was determined by exhaustive adsorption with one type of red cell and by cross-adsorption with use of two different types of red cells. All of the labeled autoantibodies studied contained multiple populations directed against epitopes variably expressed on the different types of red cells (both rare and common phenotypes) used for adsorption. At least six antibody populations defining different specificities were identified by cross-adsorption techniques with use of the red cells available. None of the antibody populations was directed against any of the major Rh alloantigens (D, C, E, c, and e) although red cells of the same Rh phenotypes from different donors adsorbed similar quantities of autoantibodies. There was remarkable consistency in the presence of similar antibody populations in all six labeled preparations in spite of the known serologic complexity of red cell autoantibodies. Autoantibody eluates were characterized as either reactive or nonreactive toward Rhnull cells on the basis of their serologic activity. Except for the antibody population specific for Rhnull, all additional specificities identified by adsorption studies were present in both types of eluates. The quantity of each antibody population, however, appeared to be unique for each individual autoantibody donor. A significant fraction (23% to 53%) of the labeled IgG in all of the autoantibodies studied was unabsorbable by any of the red cells used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Pure Apo A and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) of known Apo A concentration were used in endpoint nephelometry to determine Apo A concentrations of rat and human plasma pools. The endpoint method had coefficients of variation of 7.96% and 4.35% for rat and human plasma pools, respectively. These plasma pools were then used as secondary standards for the rate nephelometric assay. Excellent agreement (+/- 6%) existed between the plasma Apo A values determined by endpoint nephelometry and rate nephelometry. The Apo A concentration of a frozen human plasma pool determined by endpoint nephelometry was 125.2 +/- 9.6 mg/dl. The value of the same pool determined by rate nephelometry over a 1-year period with the Centers for Disease Control WHO lyophilized plasma standard was 125.4 +/- 21.2 mg/dl. Furthermore, it was found that the rat HDL was also a suitable standard in the rate nephelometric assay of Apo A. In contrast, Apo A, purified to homogeneity, showed different reaction kinetics from that of Apo A in the whole plasma and therefore was not a suitable standard in the rate nephelometric assay. We therefore conclude that primary standard Apo A, purified to homogeneity, can be used by endpoint nephelometry to calibrate plasma pools that can then be used as secondary standards in the rate nephelometric determination of rat and human plasma Apo A. The ready applicability of this method in the accurate determination of plasma Apo A under well-defined experimental conditions such as in chronic ethanol-fed rats and in human subjects with normal lipid levels and those with hyperlipidemia is demonstrated.\r"

In the cupula of the crista ampullaris, the reactivity for WGA and Con A was reduced. The otoconia, however, showed no detectable changes.

  ".W": "Seventeen male patients with pathological staged I-IIIA1 Hodgkin's disease were followed prospectively for radiation damage to the testes from low-dose scattered irradiation. During conventionally fractionated radiation therapy, the testicular dose ranged from 6 to 70 cGy. Testicular function was measured in a prospective fashion by repeated analyses (every 6 to 12 months) of serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and testosterone. Patients were also followed by serial semen analyses and by a questionnaire on fertility. The follow-up period ranged from 3 to 7 years after completion of radiation therapy. In patients receiving greater than or equal to 20 cGy, there was a dose-dependent increase in serum FSH values following irradiation, with the maximum difference at 6 months compared with pretreatment levels. All patients showed a return to normal FSH values within 12 to 24 months following irradiation. No significant changes in LH and testosterone were observed in this patient group. Eight patients with a normal pretreatment semen analysis provided serial semen samples and two patients showed transient oligospermia with complete recovery by 18 months following treatment. Four patients have fathered normal offspring following radiation therapy. We conclude that low doses (greater than 20 cGy) of scatter irradiation during treatment for Hodgkin's disease can result in transient injury to the seminiferous tubule as manifested by elevations of FSH for 6 to 24 months following treatment. Below 20 cGy, FSH values remained in the normal range. No evidence of Leydig cell injury (using LH and testosterone) was seen in this dose range (up to 70 cGy). Thus, patients with early-stage Hodgkin's disease can be treated with radiation therapy with little to no risk of irreversible testicular injury. Radiation treatment techniques to shield the testes are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "A registry of suspected cases of cancer-associated hemolytic-uremic syndrome (C-HUS) was established in May 1984. Records of 85 patients from the registry, all with history of cancer, hematocrit less than or equal to 25%, platelet count less than 100,000, and serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.6 mg/dL were subjected to in-depth analysis. Eighty-nine percent of patients had adenocarcinoma, including 26% with gastric cancer. Microangiopathic hemolysis was reported in 83 patients; coagulation studies were normal with rare exception. Bone marrow examination ruled out chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression in 68 of 85. Thirty-five percent of patients were without evident cancer at time of syndrome development. Mitomycin (MMC) was part of the treatment regimen in 84 patients; all but nine received a cumulative dose greater than 60 mg. Pulmonary edema, generally noncardiogenic, developed in 65% of patients, often after blood product transfusions. C-HUS has a high mortality: over 50% of patients died of or with syndrome, most within 8 weeks of syndrome development. Conventional treatment was ineffective, although ten of 21 treated with staphylococcal protein A (SPA) immunopheresis showed significant responses. Statistical analysis found only absence of obvious tumor and treatment with SPA to suggest favorable prognosis. C-HUS is distinguishable from related syndromes such as childhood HUS, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), consumption coagulopathy, and microangiopathic hemolysis associated with advanced carcinoma. MMC is likely involved in the development of C-HUS; the risk of developing C-HUS after treatment with MMC is between 4% and 15%. However, possible bias in patients referred to the registry and reports of non-MMC C-HUS cases must be remembered. Recommendations include careful monitoring of renal and hematologic function in patients treated with MMC, aggressive nontransfusion in patients with suspected C-HUS, and consideration of treatment with SPA immunopheresis in patients with definite syndrome.\r"

A new derivative of DADT family, 99mTc ethyl cysteinate dimer (ECD) showed high brain uptake in nonhuman primates. We report here the in vivo kinetics and biodistribution results in 16 normal human subjects. Dynamic images of brain obtained for 10 min following an i.v. administration of [99mTc]ECD showed that the maximum 99mTc brain activity reached within 1 min and remained near that level for the next 10 min. The blood clearance of the tracer was very rapid and the activity remaining in blood after 5 min was less than 10%. Within 2 hr 50% of 99mTc activity was excreted in urine. Anterior and posterior total-body images were obtained at 5, 30, 60 min, 2, 4, 24, and 48 hr using a moving table at 20 cm/min. Percent injected dose was calculated for different organs and tissues. The brain uptake was 6.5 +/- 1.9% at 5 min postinjection and remained relatively constant over several hours. Two-compartment analysis of brain time-activity curve showed that 40% of brain activity washed out faster (T 1/2 = 1.3 hr) while the remaining 60% had a slower clearance rate (T 1/2 = 42.3 hr). Some of the tracer was excreted through the hepatobiliary system. Lung uptake and retention of [99mTc]ECD was negligible. Radiation dosimetry is favorable for the administration of up to 20-40 mCi of [99mTc]ECD. These results show that [99mTc]ECD is rapidly extracted and retained by the brain providing favorable conditions for single photon emission computed tomography imaging.\r"

  ".W": "Using autologous 111In-labeled platelets, platelet kinetics and the sites of platelet destruction were assessed in 16 normal subjects (13 with and three without spleens), in 17 studies of patients with primary autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura (AITP), in six studies of patients with secondary AITP, in ten studies of patients with AITP following splenectomy, and in five thrombocytopenic patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. In normal subjects, the spleen accounted for 24 +/- 4% of platelet destruction and the liver for 15 +/- 2%. Untreated patients with primary AITP had increased splenic destruction (40 +/- 14%, p less than 0.001) but not hepatic destruction (13 +/- 5%). Compared with untreated patients, prednisone treated patients did not have significantly different spleen and liver platelet sequestration. Patients with secondary AITP had similar platelet counts, platelet survivals, and increases in splenic destruction of platelets as did patients with primary AITP. In contrast, patients with myelodysplastic syndromes had a normal pattern of platelet destruction. In AITP patients following splenectomy, the five nonresponders all had a marked increase (greater than 45%) in liver destruction compared to five responders (all less than 40%). Among all patients with primary or secondary AITP, there was an inverse relationship between the percent of platelets destroyed in the liver plus spleen and both the platelet count (r = 0.75, p less than 0.001) and the platelet survival (r = 0.86, p less than 0.001). In a stepwise multiple linear regression analysis, total liver plus spleen platelet destruction, the platelet survival and the platelet turnover were all significant independent predictors of the platelet count. Thus platelet destruction is shifted to the spleen in primary and secondary AITP. Failure of splenectomy is associated with a marked elevation in liver destruction. The magnitude of spleen and liver destruction appears to be of considerable importance in the severity of the disease, as reflected in the platelet survival and platelet count.\r"

Optic gliomas were detected in 10 children (15%). The median age of children with gliomas was 4.3 years (mean 5.8 years, range 9 months to 21 years). Three children (30%) had isolated, unilateral tumors, three (30%) had bilateral tumors, and four (40%) had involvement of the optic chiasm and of one or both nerves. Definite abnormalities of vision were found in only two children (20%). Five additional children were referred to the clinic after evaluation of ophthalmologic complaints led to the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1: three had unilateral exophthalmos and two had plexiform neurofibromas of the eyelid with associated glaucoma. Ipsilateral optic gliomas were found in all five children; one child also had a contralateral tumor. Optic gliomas are commonly identified in young children with neurofibromatosis type 1 who have no ocular or visual abnormalities. Optic nerve gliomas may be associated with plexiform neurofibromas of the eyelid and glaucoma.\r"

The effect of the infusion of high amounts of cysteine and no cysteine (100 mg/kg/day vs none) and of high and low amounts of histidine (165 vs. 95 mg/kg/day) on urinary zinc excretion was determined in 14 newborn infants receiving total parenteral nutrition who had similar zinc intakes (approximately 7 mumol/kg/day). After a 72-hour adaptation period, each infant's urine was collected for two 48-hour periods. Urinary zinc excretion during the high-dose histidine and cysteine infusion periods was significantly elevated compared with that during the no-cysteine and low-dose histidine periods. Therefore concurrent intakes of specific amino acids may have to be considered when zinc dosages are calculated.\r"

The administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) can be delayed until follicular maturation has been achieved; hCG can be withheld if too many mature follicles are present. Monitoring therapy with both modalities as well as with clinical methods ensure a high rate of successful gestations.\r"

Clomiphene citrate has been the first-line drug for ovulation induction in women with PCOS: because it is an attenuated estrogen, its action blocks the acyclic estrone effect in PCOS. However, many women fail to ovulate or conceive on clomiphene, and an appropriate agent for them was unavailable until relatively recently. The use of a \"pure\" FSH preparation, Metrodin, provides physiologic replacement of the deficient gonadotropin in PCOS; thus, Metrodin is the ideal second-line drug. Its use with a low-dose regimen should avoid the hyperstimulation seen with human menopausal gonadotropin in PCOS; spontaneous ovulation is an end point. Thus, PCOS patients who do not achieve pregnancy with clomiphene citrate have available a new, more physiologic approach to ovulation induction.\r"

  ".W": "The goal of ovulation induction in assisted reproduction is the development of multiple follicles, allowing the recovery of multiple mature, high-quality oocytes. Normally ovulatory women may respond very differently to gonadotropin stimulation. Most patients respond best to regimens that provide the highest quantities of gonadotropins in the early follicular phase followed by tapering dosages as the gonadotropin requirements of the developing follicles are reduced. Others, particularly those with inverted luteinizing hormone:follicle-stimulating hormone ratios, respond better to constant, low-dose, pure follicle-stimulating hormone protocols. Patients with elevated basal follicle-stimulating hormone concentrations may require upwards of eight ampules of gonadotropins per day to obtain multifollicular development. Gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists are of value in patients with exaggerated multifollicular responses as well as in those who have premature luteinizing hormone surges. In all cases, optimization of ovulation induction through the customization of stimulation regimens results in improved stimulation quality and outcomes.\r"

We studied the utility of serum hyaluronate in an animal model, with features reminiscent of human RA, in which LEW/N female rats were made arthritic by intraperitoneal injection of sonicated Lactobacillus casei. When serum hyaluronate was measured by an inhibition ELISA, a dose dependent correlation was found between the amount of L. casei injected and both joint score and serum hyaluronate in the chronic phase of the disease. A linear correlation between the chronic phase joint score and serum hyaluronate was observed (r = 0.69, p less than 0.001). Two orally administered compounds, flurbiprofen (20 mg/kg) and methotrexate (0.125 mg/kg), were effective in decreasing both variables. Thus, serum hyaluronate may have utility in evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of antirheumatic/antiinflammatory agents in vivo in the chronic phase of RA-like diseases.\r"

In vitro invasive ability of tumor cells was strongly correlated with spontaneous metastatic ability from the subcutaneous site, regardless of the ability of tumor cells to form artificial metastases when introduced intravenously. However, normal nontumorigenic human trophoblast cells were also highly invasive. Various collagenase inhibitors totally abrogated amnion penetration by all invasive cells; various inhibitors of plasmin, plasminogen, and plasminogen activators prevented invasion in most, but not all, cases. Thus, amnion penetration provides a rigorous test for tumor cell invasiveness required for spontaneous metastasis in vivo, and invasiveness is strongly dependent on metalloproteinase activity, which usually follows plasmin activation.\r"

Improved preservation methods, new immunosuppressive medications, and advances in technical capabilities have allowed innovative procedures to be performed. In May 1987 the first \"domino-donor\" operation was performed in the United States. A 28-year-old man with cystic fibrosis and end-stage lung disease received the heart and lungs of an anonymous donor after he donated his heart to a 38-year-old man with end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy. The technical and logistical aspects of this transplantation procedure are described herein. Other unusual features of this case that are discussed include heart-lung transplantation for a patient with cystic fibrosis, the use of cardiopulmonary bypass to allow lung procurement and transplantation across long distances, and the current role of heterotopic cardiac transplantation.\r"

The 1,008 cancer patients had 3.2 times the financial loss ($1,617 per patient vs. $510 per patient) compared to the 3,351 noncancer patients (P less than .05). Patients with cancer had a greater percentage of outliers, more diagnosis (P less than .0001) and procedures (P less than .0001) per patient, and a higher mortality (P less than .01) than patients without cancer. These findings raise the question of the equity of DRG payment for patients with cancer in many surgical DRGs. Financial disincentives to treat certain groups of Medicare cancer patients at our hospital may affect both their access and quality of care in the future.\r"

We performed genomic Southern blot analysis of muscle mitochondrial DNA from 123 patients with different mitochondrial myopathies or encephalomyopathies. Deletions were found in the mitochondrial DNA of 32 patients, all of whom had progressive external ophthalmoplegia. Some patients had only ocular myopathy, whereas others had Kearns-Sayre syndrome, a multisystem disorder characterized by ophthalmoplegia, pigmentary retinopathy, heart block, and cerebellar ataxia. The deletions ranged in size from 1.3 to 7.6 kilobases and were mapped to different sites in the mitochondrial DNA, but an identical 4.9-kilobase deletion was found in the same location in 11 patients. Biochemical analysis showed decreased activities of NADH dehydrogenase, rotenone-sensitive NADH-cytochrome c reductase, succinate-cytochrome c reductase, and cytochrome c oxidase, four enzymes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain containing subunits encoded by mitochondrial DNA. We conclude that deletions of muscle mitochondrial DNA are associated with ophthalmoplegia and may result in impaired mitochondrial function. However, the precise relation between clinical and biochemical phenotypes and deletions remains to be defined.\r"

  ".W": "Mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase is a functionally complex, membrane-bound respiratory enzyme which catalyses both the reduction of O2 to water and proton-pumping. During respiration, an exogenous donor, cytochrome c, donates four electrons to O2 bound at the bimetallic haem alpha 3 Fe-Cu centre within the enzyme. These four electron transfers are mediated by the enzyme's haem alpha and CuA redox centres and result in the translocation of four protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The molecular mechanism of proton translocation has not yet been delineated, however, and in the absence of direct experimental evidence all four electron transfers have been assumed to couple equally to proton-pumping. Here, I report the effects of proton-motive force and membrane potential on two equilibria involving intermediates of the bimetallic centre at different levels of O2 reduction. The results show that only two of the electron transfers, to the 'peroxy' and 'oxyferryl' intermediates of the bimetallic centre, are linked to proton translocation, a finding which strongly constrains candidate mechanisms for proton-pumping.\r"

  ".U": "89238547\r", 
  ".W": "The leukocyte adhesion molecule LFA-1 mediates a wide range of lymphocyte, monocyte, natural killer cell, and granulocyte interactions with other cells in immunity and inflammation. LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18) is a receptor for intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1, CD54), a surface molecule which is constitutively expressed on some tissues and induced on other in inflammation. Induction of ICAM-1 on epithelial cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts mediates LFA-1-dependent adhesion of lymphocytes. Several lines of evidence have suggested the existence of a second LFA-1 ligand: homotypic adhesion of one cell line was inhibited by a monoclonal antibody to LFA-1, but not by one to ICAM-1; there exists an LFA-1-dependent, ICAM-1-independent pathway of adhesion to endothelial cells; and also, there are some types of target cells in which LFA-1-dependent T-lymphocyte adhesion and lysis are independent of ICAM-1. We have cloned this second ligand, designated ICAM-2, using a novel method for identifying ligands of adhesion molecules. ICAM-2 is an integral membrane protein with two immunoglobulin-like domains, whereas ICAM-1 has five. Remarkably, ICAM-2 is much more closely related to the two most N-terminal domains of ICAM-1 (34% identity) than either ICAM-1 or ICAM-2 is to other members of the immunoglobulin superfamily, demonstrating the existence of a subfamily of immunoglobulin-like ligands that bind the same integrin receptor.\r"

As a result of such cross-linkage, mast cells secrete a variety of preformed biologically active substances, such as histamine, and newly synthesized arachidonic acid metabolites. Here we show that cross-linkage of Fc epsilon RI on a series of nontransformed murine mast cell lines, or treatment of these cells with calcium ionophores, stimulates increased messenger RNA levels and secretion of a group of lymphokines classically produced by a subset of murine T cell lines (TH2 cells). These factors include interleukin-3 (a mast cell growth factor)s interleukin-4 (an IgE 'switch factor'), interleukin-5 (an eosinophil differentiation factor) and interleukin-6 (a factor controlling immunoglobulin secretion). The production of these polypeptide factors by mast cells may have great importance in the induction of allergic and anti-parasite inflammatory responses.\r"

  ".U": "89238549\r", 
  ".W": "The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) exploits the cell surface CD4 molecule to initiate the infection which can lead, eventually, to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The HIV-1 envelope protein, gp120, interacts specifically with CD4 and soluble CD4 molecules have been shown to inhibit HIV infectivity in vitro. Effective inhibition in vivo may, however, require more potent reagents. We describe here the generation of molecules which combine the specificity of CD4 and the effector functions of different immunoglobulin subclasses. Replacing the VH and CH1 domains of either mouse gamma 2a or mu heavy chains with the first two N-terminal domains of CD4 results in molecules that are secreted in the absence of any immunoglobulin light chains. We find that the pentameric CD4-IgM chimaera is at least 1,000-fold more active than its dimeric CD4-IgG counterpart in syncytium inhibition assays and that effector functions, such as the binding of Fc receptors and the first component of the complement cascade (Clq), are retained. Similar chimaeric molecules, combining CD4 with human IgG were recently described by Capon et al., but these included the CH1 domain and did not bind Clq. Deletion of the CH1 domain may allow the association and secretion of heavy chains in the absence of light chains, and we suggest that the basic design of our constructs may be generally and usefully applied.\r"

  ".W": "How many primary lineages of life exist and what are their evolutionary relationships? These are fundamental but highly controversial issues. Woese and co-workers propose that archaebacteria, eubacteria and eukaryotes are the three primary lines of descent and their relationships can be represented by Fig. 1a (the 'archaebacterial tree') if one neglects the root of the tree. In contrast, Lake claims that archaebacteria are paraphyletic, and he groups eocytes (extremely thermophilic, sulphur-dependent bacteria) with eukaryotes, and halobacteria with eubacteria (the 'eocyte tree', Fig. 1b). Lake's view has gained considerable support as a result of an analysis of small subunit ribosomal RNA sequence data by a new approach, the evolutionary parsimony method. Here we report that analysis of small subunit data by the neighbour-joining and maximum parasimony methods favours the archaebacterial tree and that computer simulations using either the archaebacterial or the eocyte tree as a model tree show that the probability of recovering the model tree is very high (greater than 90 per cent) for both the neighbour-joining and maximum parsimony methods but is relatively low for the evolutionary parsimony method. Moreover, analysis of large subunit rRNA sequences by all three methods strongly favours the archaebacterial tree.\r"

  ".W": "The majority of peripheral T cells express a heterodimeric, alpha/beta T-cell receptor, which recognizes specific antigenic peptides bound to self major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, and either the CD4 or CD8 surface markers. An additional subset of T cells, whose physiological function is unknown, express a distinct CD3-associated receptor composed of gamma and delta chains. This subset includes cells lacking both CD4 and CD8 surface markers, which may be involved in autoimmunity. The recognition specificity of the gamma/delta receptors is not well characterized and has been defined in only one case to date, a murine cell line which shows MHC-linked specificity. In this report, we describe the isolation of CD4- CD8-, gamma/delta TCR bearing T cell clones from the synovial fluid of a rheumatoid arthritis patient. These T cell clones respond specifically to mycobacterial antigens without MHC restriction.\r"
