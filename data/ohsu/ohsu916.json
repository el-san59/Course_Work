  ".W": "The recognition that much current medical practice is based on incomplete scientific evidence has led to calls for the generation of guidelines for optimal patterns of practice. These guidelines must be developed from a synthesis of existing scientific data ideally obtained from randomized clinical trials. However, at present we may have to rely on less satisfactory data and the views of experts in the field. The primary purpose of these initiatives must be to improve patient care. The Ontario Medical Association has made recommendations on how such guidelines should be produced, and in a recent survey a substantial majority of family physicians supported them. There is general agreement that the coordinating body should be independent of government and other interested parties. In addition, the medical profession must have the primary role, and a number of medical organizations should also be represented. We propose a possible structure for a group charged with developing guidelines for medical practice at a provincial level and on an experimental basis. Recommendations are made on its membership, function and relationship with other organizations. The identification and diffusion of justifiable, scientific practice patterns will help reduce waste of scarce resources, maintain the role of the profession as guardian of the quality of care and ultimately benefit the patient.\r"

  ".W": "Controversy prompted a systematic and critical review of original research articles to determine the prognosis of depression in the elderly. A search of three computer databases for articles published from January 1980 to May 1989 and of the bibliographies of articles located revealed 10 reports, involving 990 subjects, that met the following inclusion criteria: original research, published in English or French since 1950, sample of at least 25 patients, inclusion of only patients over 60 years, mean follow-up period of 1 year or more and description of the patients' mental state during follow-up. The methods and study designs were then assessed with the use of the criteria for prognostic studies established by McMaster University Health Sciences Centre, Hamilton, Ont. All of the studies had serious, multiple flaws. Nevertheless, when the results were combined it appeared that at least 60% of the patients remained well or had relapses with recovery (mean follow-up 31.9 months); up to 25% remained continuously ill. Physical illness, cognitive impairment and severe depressive symptoms were frequently related to poor prognosis; most of the social factors studied were not related to prognosis. Future studies must pay attention to methods and design, particularly the composition of study populations, the assessment of outcomes and the control of extraneous prognostic factors.\r"

  ".W": "We examined 19 patients (17 men) with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and gastrointestinal symptoms to determine whether those symptoms were due to either a gastrointestinal tract infection or a defect in mucosal absorption because of an enteropathy. The erythrocyte folate and serum vitamin B12 levels were within normal limits in all of the patients. The serum ferritin level was elevated in 12. The xylose absorption test results were abnormal in 8 of the 13 patients able to complete the study. None of the duodenal aspirates yielded a pathogen. Light microscopy revealed nonspecific lymphocytic inflammation without infection in the stomach (in seven patients), the esophagus (in five), the duodenum (in two) and the rectum (in two). However, biopsy specimens were positive for Candida albicans in the esophagus (four patients), cytomegalovirus in the esophagus (one) and the rectum (two), Helicobacter pylori in the antrum (two), Treponema infection in the rectum (two) and Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare in the small intestine (one). Only three patients had a normal series of biopsy specimens. All of the patients had similar ultrastructural changes at the epithelial-stromal junction of the antral glands and in the intestinal crypts. We conclude that abnormal biochemical and endoscopic findings are common in HIV-positive patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. Defects in carbohydrate absorption and ultrastructural changes may be responsible for some aspects of HIV enteropathy.\r"

All of the infants were fed formula fortified with iron (13 mg/L) for at least 6 months, starting at 2 months of age. The plasma ferritin level decreased after the formula was no longer used. Although 90% of the infants were given cereal fortified with iron (30 mg of iron per 100 g) by 9 months of age, the plasma ferritin level continued to decrease. The level was less than 10 micrograms/L in 54% of the infants at 12 months of age and in 74% at 15 months; this indicated depleted iron stores. Because of delayed development very-low-birth-weight infants eat small amounts of cereal and therefore require iron-fortified formula throughout infancy.\r"

  ".W": "To understand better the reasons for the growth in popularity of walk-in clinics in Canada we surveyed 321 patients with a regular physician in Toronto who attended a walk-in clinic in the same city over a 16-day period in February 1988. They were asked their reason for attending the clinic, their perception of the urgency of their problem, their choices as alternatives to walk-in clinics and their satisfaction and concerns with the type of care received at the clinic. The three most common reasons for attending the clinic were convenient location (in 33% of the cases), inability to see their regular physician soon enough (in 16%) and no appointment needed (in 13%). Most (80%) of the patients felt that they needed medical attention within 24 hours after the onset of their problem. Most (83%) of the respondents would have sought medical attention at another walk-in clinic, from their regular physician or at an emergency department had the clinic been closed. Only 36% and 18% of the patients respectively responded that their regular physician worked evenings or weekends. Most of the visits to the clinic were outside regular weekday business hours. The level of satisfaction with the service received at the clinic was high. The extended hours and no-appointment philosophy of walk-in clinics, coupled with family physicians' reluctance to work evenings and weekends, have made such clinics an attractive option for patients with primary care problems that they believe require prompt attention.\r"

Evidence is now abundant to show that gastrin stimulates the growth of both gastric and colorectal cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, and that blockade of gastrin receptors can prolong survival in xenografted nude mice. We have thus performed a randomized, controlled study of the gastrin/cholecystokinin receptor antagonist proglumide as therapy in 110 patients with gastric carcinoma. Proglumide had no overall effect on survival (Mantel-Cox statistic = 0.5, P = 0.48). The 95% confidence interval for the proglumide treated group was 260 to 474 days compared to 230 to 372 days for the control group. No significant difference was seen with proglumide, which has a relatively low affinity with the gastrin receptor and also has partial agonist activity. Drugs that are far more specific and potent gastrin receptor antagonists are becoming available, which may have a greater effect on survival, and further clinical trials of such compounds are clearly indicated to determine the efficacy of hormonal control of gastrointestinal malignancy.\r"

  ".W": "Sixty-six patients with locally advanced (Stages III and IV) carcinoma of the head and neck were treated with three cycles of induction chemotherapy, consisting of cisplatin, fluorouracil (FU) infusion, bleomycin, mitomycin, and hydroxyurea, followed by radiotherapy and/or surgery. There were 48 men and 18 women with a median age of 55 years (range, 18 to 75 years) and Karnofsky performance status of 80 (range, 40 to 90). Primary site was nasopharynx (28 patients), followed by larynx (12) and others (26). Forty-one (62%) patients were presented with Stage IV disease. The response rate to induction chemotherapy was 27% complete response, 50% partial response, 20% stable disease, and 3% progressive disease. There was no significant difference in response rate between patients with cancer of nasopharynx or other sites (P greater than 0.1). Survival was 61% at 24 months. Patients with cancer of nasopharynx had a better survival than those with other primaries (P = 0.033). Toxicities from chemotherapy included alopecia (73%), nausea/vomiting (66%), leukopenia (54%), stomatitis (36%), anemia (32%), thrombocytopenia (16%), and diarrhea (9%). Grade IV toxicity was not observed. Induction chemotherapy with this new regimen resulted in a high response rate but may not be superior to cisplatin and FU alone. It can be safely combined with radiotherapy as a potentially curative therapy in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy may yield survival similar to radical surgery in laryngeal and other head and neck cancers.\r"

Forty patients had mammography performed as part of their evaluations. Mastectomy yielded the primary tumor in one of 13 patients; biopsy yielded positive results in one of five. Among the 29 patients who did not undergo mastectomy, 16 received breast irradiation, and 13 were simply observed for signs of the primary tumor. For the patients who did not undergo mastectomy, the 5-year actuarial risk for appearance of a primary was 17% in the irradiated group versus 57% in the nonirradiated group (P = 0.06). Patterns of failure are correlated with stage and local and systemic therapy. The results affirm our belief that patients with axillary metastases histologically consistent with breast tumor should be treated identically to patients with similar nodal stages and proven breast primaries.\r"

  ".U": "91003842\r", 
  ".W": "To assess how well chemotherapy is tolerated after solid organ transplantation, we reviewed our experience at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh with five patients aged 1 to 12 years. Four patients had a liver transplant, indications for which were hepatoblastoma in two patients, hepatic failure secondary to Wilms' tumor chemoradiotherapy in one patient, and familial intrahepatic cholestasis in one patient. A fifth patient received a cardiac transplant for unresectable angiosarcoma of the right atrium. After transplant, chemotherapy was given for the treatment of the primary malignancy in four of the patients. The patient with familial intrahepatic cholestasis received chemotherapy for secondary lymphoproliferative disease that had not responded to the cessation of immunosuppression. All patients other than this patient were on immunosuppression with prednisone (0.5 to 2 mg/kg daily) and cyclosporine (to maintain serum levels at 800 to 1000 ng/ml radioimmunoassay) throughout the duration of chemotherapy. Courses of chemotherapy included one or more of the following agents: Adriamycin (Adr, 20 mg/m2 daily, three patients), Cyclophosphamide (Ctx, 1 gm/m2, one patient), cisplatin (CDDP, 90 mg/m2, one patient), Vincristine (Vcr, greater than 0.75 to 1.5 mg/m2, three patients), Actinomycin D (Act-D, 7.5 micrograms/kg, one patient), Ifosfamide (I, 1800 mg/m2, one patient) and Etoposide (VP-16, 100 mg/m2, one patient). All patients received greater than or equal to 3 courses (range, 3 to 9; mean, 5) of chemotherapy every 3 to 4 weeks. Dose reductions were made because of neutropenia in three patients but none were greater than 50%. Severe rejection was seen in one patient who had, however, manifested evidence of rejection prior to his first postoperative course of chemotherapy. No nephro or cardiac toxicity was seen. This preliminary experience suggests that chemotherapy is well tolerated after solid organ transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "The application of fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) to the diagnosis of nonpalpable breast lesions was evaluated with a new method which uses standard needle localization under mammographic guidance to assure accurate sampling by FNAB. This method was prospectively applied to 100 mammographically detected breast lesions in 100 women (mean age, 53 years). All 100 patients underwent surgical excision of these nonpalpable lesions after cytologic aspiration. Sufficient aspirated material was obtained for cytologic diagnosis from 91 patients (91%). The histologic and cytologic interpretations were then compared. Twenty malignancies were ultimately diagnosed by histology (12 invasive ductal carcinoma, six ductal carcinoma in situ, and two lobular carcinoma in situ), of which 17 had been cytologically diagnosed. There were no false-positive diagnoses of malignancy by FNAB. False-negative readings (3.3%) included two cases of lobular carcinoma in situ and one case of ductal carcinoma in situ. This technique thus demonstrated a sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 100%, and overall diagnostic accuracy of 96.7% for the nonsurgical detection of malignancy in nonpalpable breast lesions. These results suggest that the established safety, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of FNAB can be maintained in this clinical setting. This procedure may obviate the need for open surgical biopsy in those patients with an unequivocal diagnosis of malignancy. It can also be done using standard techniques and equipment available in many community hospitals.\r"

This molecule is present in all established human cell lines and most malignant human cells. The authors used an indirect immunophosphatase method to study 50 squamous cell carcinomas of the larynx and ten lymph-node metastases, corresponding to six primary tumors, for 4F2 expression. The tumors showed several patterns of 4F2 staining which were correlated with different behaviors and prognoses of the neoplasms. Three different patterns (no staining, peripheral staining, and diffuse 4F2 expression) are described as are their relationships with metastatic behavior of the carcinomas. Tumors with metastases were found only in the third group (P = 0.0001). These results led to the following conclusions: (1) the 4F2 antigen is present in squamous cell carcinomas; (2) its distribution reflects the tumor-spreading pattern; and (3) it correlates with differentiation and metastatic behavior.\r"

Our results show that lymphocytes from patients with bronchogenic carcinoma can acquire LAK activity, but the level of activity acquired was significantly lower compared with lymphocytes from 25 control subjects when IL-2 cultures were supplemented with 10% autologous human serum (AHS) (15.6% +/- 2.1% specific release versus 26.0% +/- 2.9% specific release, P = 0.004). The LAK activity, defined as cytotoxicity of an NK-resistant cell line, of the patients' lymphocytes was augmented when cells were cultured with both IL-2 and IFN compared with IL-2 alone (P = 0.0001, paired t-test). Control subjects were unchanged (P = 0.09). There was no significant difference between groups of patients with different histologic types of tumor or different stages of disease. The NK activity, defined as killing of NK-sensitive K-562 target cells, of the patients' lymphocytes was not significantly different from that of the controls' lymphocytes (42.8% +/- 3.0% specific release versus 49.3% +/- 3.3% specific release, P = 0.16). These studies indicate the feasibility of IL-2 and IFN therapy in patients with bronchogenic carcinoma.\r"

Tumor-antigen 4 immunoreactivity was present in the cytoplasm of many SCC tissues, especially in the hyperparakeratotic region, and in the cytoplasm of differentiated squamous cells of the intermediate layer of normal epithelia of various organs, but not in those of other types of lung cancers or benign pulmonary diseases. Consistent with the results of immunostaining, the TA-4 concentrations in SCC tissues of the lung, esophagus, and normal squamous epithelia were much higher than in those of lung cancer other than SCC, benign pulmonary diseases, normal lung, and submandibular gland tissues. The TA-4 concentration in SCC tissue tended to increase with increasing grades of differentiation. Serum TA-4 was elevated in 15 of 27 patients with SCC but in no patients with other types of lung cancer or benign diseases. These results indicate that TA-4 is an antigen related to the differentiation of squamous cells and that tumor cells of SCC can release a large amount of TA-4 into circulation whereas normal squamous epithelia cannot.\r"

Although treatment-related deaths associated with high-dose IL-2 therapy are uncommon (1.5% in 652 consecutive patients), the potential for significant myocardial ischemia or myocarditis exists, and careful monitoring for arrhythmias or myocardial failure is warranted.\r"

In 11 of 16 patients an increasing reactivity against the vaccine was observed during the vaccination procedure. A challenge test using autologous tumor cells without NDV after the vaccination cycle revealed a specific antitumor sensibilization in 12 patients. The DTH response was not due to bacterial contamination or sensibility to the virus. Histologic examination of the vaccination site showed a dense infiltration of predominantly helper T-lymphocytes. We conclude that in most of the patients treated active, specific immunization led to a specific antitumor sensitivity.\r"

Immunohistochemically, CA19-9 was found in 33 (62.5%) of 53 primary lesions. The antigen was found in the cancer cells of invasive lymphatics and node metastases of every CA19-9 localized cancer, although the cancer cells in veins showed little or no CA19-9. There was little or no antigen in the cancer cells in veins, lymphatics, or metastases of 20 CA19-9 nonlocalized primary lesions. Patients with CA19-9 nonlocalized cancer or with benign diseases showed no elevation of the antigen levels in peripheral or portal blood. CA19-9 levels of portal blood (mean, 76.4 U/ml; positive rate, 33.3%) were not different from those of peripheral blood (mean, 91.5 U/ml; positive rate, 33.3%). Additionally, the antigen levels of the blood in patients with lymphatic invasion or node metastases were significantly higher than those in patients without the invasion or the metastases, and every patient without the invasion showed no elevation of the antigen. These results suggest that production of the antigen in cancer cells may be a premise of CA19-9 elevation in peripheral blood and that CA19-9 may be drained by the thoracic duct of the lymphatic system via node metastases or invasive lymphatics, but not by the hematogenous portal system.\r"

The JK-1 cells grow in suspension culture supplemented with human plasma and carry double Philadelphia chromosomes. Hemoglobin staining with benzidine was positive for about 20% of cells and the type of the hemoglobin was for the most part HbF. Surface-marker analysis revealed JK-1 cells positive for glycophorin A, EP-1, and HAE9. The proportion of mature cells was elevated by the addition of delta-aminolevulinic acid. Erythropoietin (EPO) enhanced the growth of JK-1 cells either in the suspension or in methylcellulose semisolid culture. The total number of EPO receptors was 940 per cell, of which 220 sites had an affinity higher than the other 720 sites.

Eighteen percent of the mesenteric nodes removed at surgery from patients with colon cancer contained a circumferential rim of viable tumor cells in an area corresponding wholly or in part to the normal location of the marginal sinus. In each case this rim of tumor cells surrounded a large central area of necrosis. In contrast, only one of the 135 axillary nodes removed from patients with breast cancer demonstrated this pattern. These findings suggest that by interrupting blood and lymph vessels, the circumferential spread of tumor cells underlies development of central necrosis. Previously described structural dissimilarities between mesenteric and axillary nodes may explain the striking difference in incidence of this pattern in these nodes.\r"

  ".U": "91003858\r", 
  ".W": "The previous cytometric studies on parathyroid tumors have provided conflicting data regarding the relationship between DNA content and histopathology, resulting from differences in technical methods and data analysis. This study measured nuclear DNA of parathyroid tumors by flow cytometry in fresh material and determined whether DNA aneuploidy really assists in making a pathologic diagnosis of carcinoma or not. From May 1987 through April 1989, 65 consecutive patients operated on for primary hyperparathyroidism had DNA analysis of the freshly excised parathyroid tumors. Three of the patients had metastatic lesions of parathyroid carcinoma in the lung, cervical lymph nodes, and lung and mediastinal lymph nodes, respectively. Pathologic classifications of the lesions from the other 62 patients were 54 adenomas, four carcinomas, and four hyperplasias. In all the latter patients, hyperplasia was associated with a multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome. Unequivocal evidence of aneuploidy was found in all of the metastatic lesions and 60% of the primary lesions of the carcinomas, in 9% of the adenomas and in 50% of the hyperplasias. Therefore, parathyroid carcinomas were more apt to be aneuploid than were adenomas (P = 0.0015, both-sided testing). In each of the cases of aneuploid hyperplasia, a small aneuploid peak was found. The high incidence of aneuploidy in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 may indicate the presence of clonal heterogeneity of hyperplastic glands and the presence of an abnormal subset of cells that have malignant potential. Cell distribution analysis did not provide any significant information beyond ploidy level. In conclusion, DNA flow cytometric analysis of DNA ploidy patterns is a valuable adjunct to the histopathologic diagnosis of parathyroid neoplasms.\r"

  ".W": "During a three-year period (1986-1988), 234 colonic brush specimens were received in the authors' laboratory. Nine samples (4%) were deemed unsatisfactory for evaluation because of inadequate cellularity and/or poor fixation. In 11 cases concomitant or follow-up histologic specimens were not available. The remaining 214 specimens included 82 malignant neoplasms, 88 neoplastic polyps (adenomas), and 44 nonneoplastic lesions. Sixty-seven (82%) of malignant neoplasms were correctly diagnosed by brush cytology. Three cases of adenoma with severe dysplasia or in situ carcinoma were diagnosed as adenocarcinoma by cytology. No false-positive diagnoses were made of nonneoplastic lesions. Brush cytology was found to be a more sensitive technique in the diagnosis of colon cancer than endoscopic biopsy (82% and 74% sensitivity, respectively). The combination of the two techniques increased the sensitivity to 90% and improved the overall accuracy of the test. Seventy-one (82%) of the colonic adenomas were correctly diagnosed by cytology. Brush cytology is a convenient, safe, and accurate technique which should be used concurrently with endoscopic biopsy or polypectomy.\r"

This type of CPDN has all the features of the conventional type of CPDN; however, in addition, there are grossly demonstrable papillonodular projections extending from the septa into the cyst lumina. The septa do not show any expansile tumor masses. Like most cases of the conventional type, this new type of CPDN was usually diagnosed in infants. Nephrectomy (total in 10 and partial in 1) was done in these cases. Additional chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy was given in seven cases. No recurrence was noted during the period extending from 21 months to 8 years in the eight cases in which follow-up data are available. Nephrectomy with regular follow-up visits for possible recurrence may be the management of choice. Pathologists should be aware of this variant of CPDN so that overtreatment can be avoided. The revised criteria for CPDN can be summarized as follows: (1) The discrete entirely cystic tumor contains luminal papillonodules in some cases. (2) Septa and the papillonodules, when present, are the only solid portion of the tumor and contain blastemal cells admixed with their normal and aberrant derivatives. (3) The tumor without and with papillonodules is classified as a conventional and papillonodular type of CPDN, respectively.\r"

In addition, the authors conducted an immunohistochemical survey of 23 cases and an electron microscopic examination of three. The findings were compared with observations of 32 cases of de novo malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH). All tumors contained additional distinct anaplastic portions indistinguishable from MFH under conventional light microscopy, ultrastructurally, and in cases of immunoreactivity for alpha-1-antichymotrypsin and alpha-1-antitrypsin and on lectin histochemical findings for ricinus communis agglutinin and concanavalin agglutinin. The desmin reactivity present in anaplastic portions of 14 DSTS and in eight de novo MFH is taken to mean that myofibroblasts are present in these tumors. The anaplastic components of DSTS are presumed to represent the proliferation of another clone of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells that fail to differentiate along any specific lineage other than fibroblast-like cells, histiocyte-like cells, and myofibroblasts. Nineteen patients died of tumor and four are alive and well 1.6, 1.7, 2.1, and 5.2 years after the initial treatment, respectively.\r"

A high percentage of pain relief was attained within a mean duration of 4 days, which on follow-up was maintained at a steady level in most patients (91.1%). Oral morphine could not be continued in three patients because of vomiting. The main side effects noticed were nausea and vomiting, itching, and constipation. At any time during the first 140 days, only 30% of patients had side effects and appropriate medication successfully managed these side effects. During the rest of the study period, the side effects were minimal. Oral morphine used with proper adjuncts offers the best pain palliation in most patients, with minimal side effects.\r"

  ".W": "The authors evaluated the prognostic value of clinically assessed variables for predicting length of survival until death from metastatic disease in 237 patient with a primary choroidal or ciliary body melanoma. Using multivariate Cox proportional hazards modeling, the authors identified the largest linear basal tumor diameter (mm), estimated by indirect ophthalmoscopy and fundus drawing, the location of the anterior margin of the tumor relative to the ocular equator and ora serrata, and the age of the patient at the time of treatment as the best combination of the clinically assessed variables for predicting survival. For each patient in this group, the authors computed a prognostic index based on the best multivariate Cox model. They showed that patients with low, intermediate, and high values of prognostic index had low, intermediate, and high melanoma-related mortality rates, respectively, during the first 5 to 8 posttreatment years. These results suggest that: (1) clinically assessed variables evaluated according to a standardized protocol are useful for predicting the survival of treated patients with posterior uveal melanoma and (2) ophthalmologists who assess potential clinical prognostic variables consistently may identify subgroups of patients with comparable mortality risk on the basis of noninvasive testing.\r"

Although there was a statistically significant trend with age for an increasing proportion of women to report having undergone mammography, there was no significant difference when comparing mammographic histories of cases with controls after controlling for age (31.5% versus 35.1%, P = 0.33). Significantly more cases (79%) perceived their risk for breast cancer to be moderate or greater compared with controls (54%, P less than 0.0001), but mammographic histories were not different when controlling for perceived risk. Both cases and controls cited lack of physician referral and cost as their reasons for not having undergone mammography.

  ".W": "In premenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer, differences in survival curves early during follow-up can be misleading. The authors therefore analyzed long-term survival in 378 patients, entered in three randomized trials, started between 1973 and 1978. Combined data from the three trials were used to increase the power for identifying prognostic variables. Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) trial 7382 randomized patients to oophorectomy plus either cyclophosphamide or combination chemotherapy or observation. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 2174 randomized patients who had not progressed 3 months after oophorectomy to combination chemotherapy or combination chemotherapy or observation. Trial ECOG 2177 randomized estrogen receptor (ER) positive or ER-unknown patients to oophorectomy plus combination chemotherapy or immediate combination chemotherapy, and ER-negative patients were directly assigned to combination chemotherapy. Hence ER-negative patients need not have been healthy enough to be randomized to oophorectomy. With only 14% of the patients still alive, median survival on the three studies was 30, 24, and 28 months. The median survival of individual treatments changed noticeably in ECOG 2174 and ECOG 2177 with long-term follow-up. At this time there are no differences in survival between randomized regimens in any of the three trials. In a multivariate model, factors associated with significantly poorer survival were visceral-dominant disease, nodal metastases, breast metastases, age younger than 45 years, ER negativity, and not receiving chemotherapy immediately after oophorectomy. This treatment difference was thus not due to imbalances in the prognostic variables used in the model, but it may be due to imbalances of unknown prognostic factors or differences in patient selection.\r"

Carcinoma of the lateral walls accounted for 37.1%; the posterior wall, 17.9%; the trigone, 12.6%; the neck, 11.1%; the ureteric orifices, 9.8%; the dome, 7.7%; and the anterior wall, 3.8%. Malignant neoplasms occurring in the neck of the bladder had a significantly poorer prognosis by survival analysis (P less than 0.05). Malignancies of the dome were found to present as higher grade lesions (P = 0.00003), and carcinoma of the ureteric orifices and lateral walls tended to be of lower grade (P = 0.02 and P = 0.05, respectively). Carcinomas of the anterior wall and dome occurred in a more elderly population (mean ages, 75.6 and 73.9 years, respectively), and carcinomas of the trigone and ureteric orifices occurred in a younger group (mean ages, 68.3 and 67.5 years, respectively). On histologic evaluation the trigone gave rise to more squamous cell carcinoma than expected (P = 0.001, 325% of expected). No distribution difference was noted among subsites with respect to sex. These data show significant differences among subsites of the urinary bladder with regard to survival, grade, histology, and age at diagnosis.\r"

The development of aversions to the novel and familiar foods was also assessed. Patients with a history of posttreatment nausea consumed either a novel or a familiar food before chemotherapy and were asked to keep a food record through the next breakfast and to rate their preference for these foods. Patients who consumed halva before treatment were significantly more likely to increase their ratings for foods consumed after chemotherapy than patients who consumed familiar cookies. Aversions to the novel food were significantly more frequent than aversions to the familiar food. These findings provide evidence that a novel but not a familiar food consumed before chemotherapy can act as a scapegoat to prevent items in the regular diet consumed after chemotherapy from decreasing in preference. Providing patients with a novel food before chemotherapy is a useful clinical intervention to reduce the likelihood of forming aversions to familiar foods consumed after chemotherapy.\r"

Observed numbers of deaths from 1979 to 1985 for total cancers and most cancer sites in Suffolk County black men and women were not lower than expected on the basis of age-specific and gender-specific death rates for blacks in the US. Although numbers of deaths from cervical cancer and prostate cancer were slightly lower than expected in Suffolk County blacks versus American blacks, these numbers were still significantly greater than expected on the basis of death rates among American whites. Age-specific death rates for age groups 25 to 44 years to 55 to 64 years tended to be lower in Suffolk County for lung cancers in black men but not for breast cancer in black women. Specific cancer sites, which differ in the direction of the association between incidence and socioeconomic status, age, and gender must be considered in comparisons of cancer mortality by race and socioeconomic level. Implications of the comparisons were discussed with regard to the goal of reducing racial differences in cancer death rates.\r"

Results showed significant correlation with biochemical ER determinations as well as with tumor grade and menopausal status. In 449 cases, results of progesterone receptor assay by ICA using the monoclonal anti-PgR antibody KD 68, also correlated significantly with biochemical PgR measurements. The ERICA/PgRICA positivity was significantly more frequent in postmenopausal white women. Colloid carcinomas were most likely to be ERICA positive and PgRICA positive whereas medullary carcinomas were most often negative. In 47 patients with advanced mammary carcinoma, results of ERICA and PgRICA were more closely related to endocrine response than those of ER and PgR by dextran-coated charcoal assay (DCC). In 339 women with Stage I or Stage II breast cancer, ERICA was significantly associated with disease-free survival. Analysis by Cox's proportional hazard model, however, showed PgRICA to be the best predictor of survival and disease-free survival in 197 women at the same stages of disease. These data indicate that ICA is more predictive of prognosis than biochemical ER and PgR. The ease of ICA performance coupled with these results indicate that the method is an acceptable substitute for DCC in analyzing breast cancers for ER/PgR.\r"

Twenty-two received 150 mg/m2 of VM-26 on days 1 and 2 with 100 mg/2 of Ara-C as a continuous infusion on days 1 through 5; a second shortened course was given on day 14 to eight patients who had evidence of some antileukemic effect or were clinically judged able to tolerate a second course. The last four patients received three daily doses of VM-26 and a 7-day infusion of Ara-C at the same daily dosages. Twelve (48%) achieved complete remission (CR) of ALL. There was a trend toward decreasing response rates with an increasing number of drugs used in the initial induction regimen, i.e., five CR among seven patients with a prior two-drug induction attempt, six CR among 14 patients with a prior three- to four-drug induction attempt, and one CR among four patients with a prior five- to seven-drug induction attempt (P = 0.14). Ten of 17 non-T-cell patients and two of nine T-cell patients achieved remission (P = 0.10). The median time required to achieve a complete remission from the initiation of treatment was 26 days (range, 14-72 days). This period was shorter in those who required one course compared with those who required two induction courses, i.e., 25 days median vs. 44 days median. Toxicity was significant and due mainly to marrow aplasia and infection; one patient had severe prolonged VM-26-induced hypotension. Of the 12 patients entering remission, two were removed for marrow transplant and one was removed due to parental request. In the remaining nine patients, median remission duration was only 2 months (range, 1-18 months). All nine patients relapsed in the marrow. Among the entire group of 26 patients, only one patient is alive and a long-term event-free survivor (after allogeneic marrow transplant). Due to the current use of more aggressive initial induction regimens and the extremely poor prognosis in children who fail to achieve initial remission, more intensive regimens of continuation therapy or alternative therapies, such as bone marrow transplant, should be considered.\r"

When analyzed analogously to previous work, the results confirmed a dose-response relationship: that is, there appeared to be an improved disease-free survival for patients receiving higher doses of adjuvant chemotherapy. The major criticism of such an analysis is its bias. This bias was addressed by considering only patients who were still receiving therapy at 6, 12, and 24 months; then, the dose-response relationship was no longer seen. Although causality cannot be inferred, the apparent differences in disease-free survival among the dose groups can be attributed to recurrences in the first 2 years among patients receiving lower doses of chemotherapy.\r"

Side effects related to the chemotherapy were present in all patients studied. Death from fulminating sepsis occurred in three of the 13 patients with leukopenia. Symptomatic myocardial dysfunction developed in one patient.

Five treatment levels of 5-FU, ranging from 500 to 900 mg/m2/day for 5 days, were studied. Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and oral mucositis were the dose-limiting toxicities encountered. Nephrotoxicity was minimal. Ototoxicity and peripheral neuropathies were rare and mild in this patient group, but most patients received only a small number of treatment cycles. Diarrhea was not dose-limiting. Two complete responses (one non-small cell lung cancer and one sweat gland carcinoma) were observed. No other major responses were noted. With the dose of CDDP set at 35 mg/m2/day for 5 consecutive days, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a concurrent 5-day 5-FU infusion was found to be 900 mg/m2/day. The recommended dosages for Phase II trials are 35 mg/m2/day CDDP and 800 mg/m2/day 5-FU for 5 consecutive days. Cancers of the lung, breast, gastrointestinal tract, and genitourinary tract would be reasonable targets for Phase II studies.\r"

Local control after definitive complementary radiation and/or surgical treatment was achieved in seven patients. Toxic side effects was acceptable; they consisted of nausea and vomiting in all patients, transient skin changes, hematologic (Grade 3/4) abnormalities in four patients, and pulmonary fibrosis in one elderly patient. These results show that this chemotherapy combination could play a role in reducing the tumor mass and in facilitating definitive treatment to obtain better functional and cosmetic results in advanced SCC of the skin.\r"

  ".W": "In osteosarcoma, intraarterial (IA) administration of systemic treatment has been advocated to improve local tumor response preparing for, or even obviating, definitive surgery. Because data from the literature did not unequivocally support the local superiority of IA infusion, a comparative study was started in 1986. Preoperative chemotherapy consisted of 45 mg/m2 of doxorubicin on days 1 and 2; 12 g/m2 of high-dose methotrexate on days 15 and 22; and 3 g/m2 of ifosfamide on days 29, 30, 50, and 51 followed on days 31 and 52 by intravenous (IV) versus IA tourniquet infusion of cisplatin (DDP). A strict randomization of patients was not feasible. A balanced distribution of risk factors was strived for by stratifying and allocating the appropriate patients centrally. The infusion time was prolonged from 1 to 5 hours in the IV group, and the DDP dose was reduced from 150 to 120 mg/m2 in both arms when intolerable ototoxicity became apparent. A multivariate analysis was performed to exclude a bias on the response rates from risk factor distribution and from modifications of DDP infusion time and dosage. The overall fraction of histologic good responders (greater than 90% necrosis) was not found to be different after IA versus IV treatment (34/50 [68%] vs. 41/59 [69%]). Intraarterial instead of IV use of DDP within an aggressive systemic treatment does not seem to improve the local tumor response.\r"

Two hundred fifteen, 28, and 38 cancers originated from the endolarynx, epilarynx, and hypopharynx, respectively. Regions invaded by the tumor were divided into 26 subsites. A classification based on the number of invaded subsites was proposed, which agreed well with the T classification of the TNM system. Cancers originating from the hypopharynx invaded more subsites than cancers from the endolarynx, and among the latter, supraglottic were more invasive than glottic lesions. The number of invaded subsites was strongly associated with nodal involvement. Among symptoms at onset of disease and at diagnosis, patients with endolaryngeal lesions reported dysphonia and dyspnea more frequently, and patients with lesions from other regions had a higher prevalence of dysphagia, odynophagia, otalgia, and adenopathia. Clinical and epidemiologic results of this study suggest considering the endolarynx, epilarynx, and hypopharynx as separate anatomic entities. Diagnostic delay was not associated with tumor size and showed a negative trend with involvement of cervical lymph nodes, suggesting that stage at diagnosis is due to intrinsic differences in tumor aggressiveness.\r"

In the same time period, 21 patients underwent potentially curative radical pancreaticoduodenectomy for periampullary tumors of pancreatic origin. Similar analysis showed an overall operative mortality of 23.8% and a survival rate at 5 years of 27% +/- 12.5 SEM. The results of radical pancreaticoduodenectomy for ampullary carcinoma in the most recent years (1976 to 1988) were compared with those of former years (1953 to 1975). There were no statistically significant differences in the 5-year survival rate; however, the operative mortality decreased from 25% in the former period to 6.3% in the recent period. Survival was dependent on nodal status. The 5-year survival rate was 78% +/- 11.5 SEM in the absence of nodal metastasis versus 50% +/- 25 SEM in the presence of regional nodal metastasis. These findings support the concept that radical pancreaticoduodenectomy offers a realistic probability for cure in a selected group of patients with carcinomas of the ampulla of Vater.\r"

The carcinoma was resistant to treatment, and he died of complications related to metastatic disease 3 years posttransplantation. Molecular biologic studies using nonisotopic-labeled viral DNA probes were done. In situ hybridization demonstrated the presence of HPV 16 DNA in the tumor cells. DNA dot blot analysis confirmed the presence of multiple copies of HPV 16 DNA within the tumor cells and their absence from adjacent normal-appearing tissue. Southern blot analysis suggested that the HPV 16 DNA was integrated into the tumor cell genome. With increasing recognition of the carcinogenicity of HPV type 16 infection, a role for this virus in the development of squamous cell malignancies in immunosuppressed organ transplant recipients is likely to be noted with increasing frequency.\r"

However, expression of this antigen has also been detected in embryonal carcinomas, in nonembryonal carcinomas, in malignant melanomas, and even in some myeloid cell lines and macrophages at late stages of differentiation. In this study, using monoclonal antibody Ki-1, expression of CD30 antigen was immunohistochemically examined in frozen sections of 28 benign and 63 malignant mesenchymal tumors. The authors found CD30 expressed in two of four leiomyomas, seven of 11 leiomysarcomas, one of six rhabdomyosarcomas, two of two aggressive fibromatoses, one of three fibrosarcomas, two of four synovial sarcomas, one giant cell tumors of tendon sheaths, all five malignant fibrous histiocytomas, all three osteosarcomas, one of three Ewing's sarcomas, in a tumor cell subpopulation of two of ten malignant schwannomas, and in the Schwann cell compartment of one of two ganglioneuromas tested. Furthermore, CD30 was consistently expressed in the myoepithelial compartment of 13 fibroadenomas. However, all five lipomas, all seven liposarcomas, all three neuroblastomas, both ganglioneuroblastomas, both chondrosarcomas, and tumors of disputed origin tested were consistently CD30 negative. These findings indicate that, outside the lymphatic system, CD30 antigen is not restricted to epithelial neoplasms but may also be present in tumors of mesenchymal origin. The authors conclude that CD30 antigen, although having limited utility in the differential diagnosis of tumors of questionable histogenesis, may eventually define relevant subgroups within the main tumor categories.\r"

Clustered (CD23, 25, 39, 40, 27, 1c, w75) and unclustered (NuB1, 7F7, KiB3) monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) were tested. Almost all cases showed high reactivity to CD23, 27, w75, 39, 40, and NuB1: expression of CD1c was very low and that of 7F7, KiB3, and CD25 was variable. The reactivity of 7F7 and KiB3 was strictly correlated, and they correlated individually with CD25. Results show that the most frequent B-CLL phenotype (CD19+, 5+, 23+, 27+, 39+, NuB1+, KiB3 +/-, 7F7 +/-, and CD25 +/-) corresponds to one or more cellular subsets in the mantle zone. No correlation was found between MoAb expression, surface immunoglobulin (SIg) class or type, clinical stage, disease activity, or age at diagnosis. The only difference (statistically borderline) was the expression of 7F7 and KiB3 (in young versus old patients). This suggests that modulations in the expression of surface antigens do not affect the clinical behavior of the disease.\r"

The authors studied the immunoglobulin (Ig), T-cell receptor (TCR), and bcl-2 gene rearrangement in 62 cases of malignant lymphoma in this population by Southern blot hybridization. Two cases of Hodgkin's disease showed no rearrangement of the Ig and TCR genes. All 42 cases of B-cell lymphoma had Ig heavy chain (JH) rearrangement with or without additional rearrangement of the light chains (C kappa and C lambda). One case of diffuse B-cell lymphoma had additional T-cell receptor beta-chain (C beta) rearrangement. Sixteen of 18 cases of T-cell lymphoma had C beta rearrangement, and one case of T-lymphoblastic lymphoma had additional JH rearrangement. Two of eight (25%) cases of follicular lymphoma but only one of the 34 (2.9%) cases of diffuse B-cell lymphoma had bcl-2 rearrangement that was detected by pFL-1 probe. None of the 62 cases showed bcl-2 rearrangement using the pFL-2 probe. In conclusion, the Ig and TCR gene rearrangement pattern of the lymphomas found in Hong Kong correlates well with the T-cell and B-cell lineage, which is similar to reports in the white population. However, the incidence of bcl-2 gene rearrangement in follicular B-cell lymphoma is lower than that reported in the US but comparable with that in Japan.\r"

A double concentrate method of cytocentrifuge preparation was used to analyze 4543 consecutive CSF specimens from 349 children with ALL between January 1, 1982, and September 30, 1988. One hundred nine CSF specimens from 58 evaluable children had less than 6 leukocytes/microliter and more than 5% blasts on cytocentrifuge differential count (low-cell-count specimen with blasts [LCB]). During the study period, 25 of 332 evaluable children (7.5%) had CNS leukemic recurrence. In 22 of 25 (88%), the CNS relapse was preceded by at least one abnormal low-cell-count CSF specimen. One of 34 patients with a single LCB at diagnosis (3%) had subsequent CNS relapse compared with five of eight patients (62.5%) with a single LCB during remission (P = 0.0002). Of 16 children with two or more LCB during remission, nine (56%) had CNS relapse defined by standard criteria, whereas six additional patients in this group were declared to be in CNS relapse on the basis of their repetitive LCB. Whether diagnosing CNS recurrence earlier in its course based on a modification of the definition of CNS leukemia will change the frequency of subsequent adverse events or make possible decreased intensity of CNS retreatment remains to be determined.\r"

Dependence of remission duration on 5'-N activity was analyzed in 74 adults with ALL, treated similarly in a prospective multicenter trial. The remission curves for ALL patients with 5'-N activity lower than 10 nmol/h x 10(6) cells were substantially and significantly better than those of patients with high activity (greater than 10 nmol/h x 10(6) cells). This difference was also evident in the immunologic subclass common ALL. Statistical evaluation showed that an interaction between immunologic subtype of the blast cells and their 5'-N activity had prognostic significance for remission duration. In addition to the independent factor, initial age, this interaction was also prognostic for survival.\r"

Androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptor (ER), and progesterone receptor (PgR) were assayed using the dextran-coated charcoal (DCC) method and analyzed by the method of Scatchard. Androgen receptor, ER, and PgR were negative in all of the cytosol prepared from normal thyroid tissues. However, the positive rates for the receptors in the neoplastic and nonneoplastic tissues were 22% for AR, 29% for ER, and 18% for PgR. Especially, the incidence of ER was significantly higher in neoplastic lesions than normal tissues. These data suggest that sex hormones, especially estrogen, may play a role in diseases of the thyroid.\r"

Soluble interleukin-2 receptors in the supernatant of cultured SCLC cells obtained from the patient's pleural effusion while he had malignant pleuritis, increased almost linearly from the time of cell seeding. The expression of interleukin-2 receptors (Tac) on the SCLC cells were demonstrated by an immunofluorescence study. However, other lymphocytic markers, including OKT 11, OKT 4, OKT 8, B 1, and B 4, were not found on the cells with the exception of the natural killer cell marker, NKH-1. Southern blot analysis indicated the rearrangement of the T-cell receptor of the cancer cells. Moreover, monoclonal integration of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) provirus in DNA from the cancer cells was also demonstrated. These observations suggest that some SCLC in HTLV 1 endemic areas are associated with HTLV-1.\r"

The ABH and Lewis phenotype and secretor status of the patients were correlated with histologic findings. An anomalous expression of Lewis a antigen was found in 88 of 249 gastric biopsy specimens of Lewis (a-b+) phenotype patients. The prevalence of this anomaly increased with the evolution of the premalignant process, in agreement with the commonly accepted model of gastric carcinogenesis. Thus, anomalous Lewis a antigen appeared in 66.6% of gastric dysplasia cases, in 64.6% of intestinal metaplasia, in 15.4% of atrophic gastritis, and in 7.4% of superficial gastritis. No alterations were found in subjects with normal gastric mucosa. Forty-seven of the 49 Lewis (a-b+) phenotype gastric carcinoma patients showed antigenic alterations in tumor cells (anomalous Lewis a antigen in 36 and loss of Lewis antigens in 11). In 26 of these gastric specimens an anomalous Lewis a antigen was present in areas of intestinal metaplasia and/or dysplasia away from the area of neoplastic transformation. The expression of Lewis a antigen in Lewis (a-b+) phenotype patients is a frequent phenomenon in gastric neoplastic cells and could result from the blocked synthesis of Lewis b antigen with accumulation of its precursors. These findings suggest that, during gastric carcinogenesis, antigenic alterations may precede neoplastic transformation. An anomalous Lewis a antigen could constitute a significant index of severity of the histologic lesion and contribute to identifying high-risk individuals.\r"

  ".W": "Cytophotomtric DNA contents of tumor cells in primary lesions and the corresponding metastatic lymph nodes were compared in 61 cases of gastric cancer to determine whether the DNA content remains stable during lymph node metastasis. The DNA distribution patterns were grouped into three types, according to the proportion of aneuploid cell population. Changes in DNA patterns between primary and metastatic lesions were evident in 36 of 61 patients (59.0%); in the remaining 25 (41.0%), the same DNA distribution patterns were noted for both lesions. In 33 of these 36, DNA pattern in the primary carcinoma was transformed into a more narrowly scattered one in the metastatic lesion of the lymph node. Mean and modal values and the frequency of cells over tetraploid (4c) or hexaploid (6c) were significantly higher in the primary lesion compared with findings in the metastatic lesions. This reduction in DNA content in the metastatic lesions was a more frequent occurrence in differentiated (18 of 23) than in undifferentiated adenocarcinoma (15 of 35) (P less than 0.01). Therefore, in primary lesions with a widely scattered DNA ploidy, the tumor cells with a smaller DNA ploidy frequently metastasized to lymph nodes, particularly in cases of a differentiated carcinoma. Such observations may be pertinent in future designing of treatment protocols.\r"

The authors now report an additional seven cases of ALCL with unique clinical presentations. One patient presented with prostate enlargement, the second with lytic bone lesions and thickened nasal sinus mucosa, the third had diffuse myalgia, the fourth had dyspnea and pulmonary infiltrates, the fifth had gangrene of the lower extremities, total-body skin involvement, and pancytopenia, the sixth had a lesion of the foreskin mimicking squamous cell carcinoma, and the seventh had a mediastinal mass. In all cases histologic features were characteristic of ALCL with, in two cases, extravascular spread into soft tissue. Immunohistologic studies showed a B-cell phenotype in five cases and a T-cell phenotype in one case. Two patients received combination chemotherapy using established treatment protocol for large cell lymphoma, and remain in complete clinical remission and two patients are responding clinically to combination chemotherapy. Two patients died shortly after receiving combination chemotherapy. One patient has only recently been diagnosed as having ALCL and no long-term follow-up is available. These data indicate that, although ALCL affects predominantly the central nervous system and skin, unusual clinical presentations may occur, and patients with ALCL may respond to combination chemotherapy for large cell lymphoma.\r"

  ".W": "Abnormal cellular DNA content, a hallmark of malignancy, is known to be an important prognostic factor in many human solid tumors; however, no data have been published on whether cellular DNA content carries prognostic significance for patients with nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). Archival, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded pathology specimens representing pretreatment tissue biopsies from 55 patients (41 men and 14 women) with NPC were analyzed for cellular DNA content in a retrospective fashion from 1968 to 1988. Individual tumors were classified as either lymphoepithelioma, squamous cell, or anaplastic carcinoma, and were staged according to International Union Against Cancer (UICC) criteria. All patients were treated with curative intent using a 4 to 6 MeV linear accelerator to total doses ranging from 50 to 60 Gy in 4 to 6 weeks. The overall 5-year actuarial survival for all 55 patients was 44.4% (men, 41%; women, 52%). Survival by T stage was as follows: T1, 65%; T2, 51%; T3, 36%; and T4, 27%. Similarly, the 5-year survival rate declined as the bulk of nodal metastases increased: N0, 62%; N2, 50%; N3, 37%; and N1, 25%. Patients who had anaplastic carcinoma had a 5-year survival of 73%, those with lymphoepithelioma had a 60% survival, and those with squamous cell cancer (SCC) had a 30% survival. There was a statistically significant difference in 5-year survival between patients with SCC and those with nonkeratinizing histologies (P less than 0.05). In addition, there was a significant association between patients older than 40 years of age with SCC and patients younger than 40 years of age with nonkeratinizing malignancies (P less than 0.01). Of the 55 tumors successfully analyzed, 22 (40%) were diploid and 33 (60%) were aneuploid. The mean coefficient of variation (CV) of all 55 samples was 6.17%. There was no significant difference in 5-year survival between patients with diploid and those with aneuploid tumors (48% versus 42%). Furthermore, there was no statistically significant survival difference between aneuploid and diploid tumors within any one histologic subgroup. There was also no significant survival difference related to the DNA index. The results indicate that the extent of local tumor spread is still the most important prognostic factor for patients treated with radiotherapy for NPC. The data support the conclusion that patients with lymphoepithelioma and anaplastic carcinomas have a superior survival to patients with squamous cell carcinoma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The neoplasm developed within the submandibular gland of a 78-year-old woman with invasion of the mandible and metastasis to regional lymph nodes. Histopathologically, cuboidal cells possessing clear cytoplasm and displaced round nuclei proliferated and exhibited an adenomatous pattern. Many cystic spaces surrounded by tumor cell strands were seen, mucus substance filled in the cystic spaces, and the tumor cells seemed mucus-secreting, but neither epidermoid cells nor papillary appearance could be observed. Electromicroscopically, numerous mucous droplets of low electron density were prominent in the cytoplasm, and the tumor cells had sparse irregular microvilli on the luminal surface. Mucin histochemistry, including paradoxical concanavalin A staining, revealed that the tumor cells contained neutral and acid mucins, and these were identified as class II and III mucosubstances. No other neoplastic lesion, except recurrent metastatic neck nodes, has been detected 6 years after the first examination, and it seems that the tumor is a rare primary mucinous adenocarcinoma of the submandibular gland.\r"

Histologic and steroid receptor assays were performed using standard techniques; flow cytometric analysis was performed from paraffin-embedded blocks obtained from the primary tumor. Quality control studies on reproducibility, tissue heterogeneity, and analysis procedures have been included. Of the 197 patients studied, aneuploidy was found in 102 (52%); the median %S value was 8% with a range of 0.4% to 38%. Our results demonstrated that number of positive nodes, receptor status, and grade were of prognostic value. Cell cycle kinetic data were not of independent prognostic value in this series. However, ploidy could differentiate in prognosis in the receptor-negative subgroup. Patients with receptor-negative tumors had a significantly better overall survival if the tumor was diploid in nature. Cell kinetics was not significantly prognostic for either receptor subgroup, although patients with higher %S tended to have better relapse-free and overall survival. This is in disagreement with other studies and may demonstrate that treatment has confounded our results and diminished the ability of flow cytometry data to help predict outcome.\r"

The authors have compared the cytologic diagnosis of 53 lung cancer cases with the immunofluorescence patterns obtained using a panel of monoclonal antibodies, five of which (KG 8.13, KM 4.62, Ks B.17, KS 8.12, KK 8.60) react with specific cytokeratin polypeptides and one with vimentin (VIM 13.2). Only in six of 23 samples cytologically diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma did the immunocytochemical typing of cytokeratins (ICTC) confirm the cytologic diagnosis. In seven cases some of the tumor cells stained positively with antibody Ks B.17 specific for simple epithelial keratin (No: 18), suggesting the presence of some cells of glandular origin. In ten additional cases the ICTC was in conflict with the cytologic diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (i.e., antibodies Ks 8.12 and KK 8.60 were negative, and antibody Ks B.17, positive) supporting a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. In 14 of 18 cases cytologically diagnosed as adenocarcinoma, the ICTC confirmed the diagnosis whereas in four cases additional presence of some squamous cells was noticed. The ICTC labeling of cases cytologically diagnosed as undifferentiated and large cell carcinomas was similar to that of the group of adenocarcinomas. Thus, the application of cytokeratin typing for TFNAB samples seems to provide a vital complementation to routine cytologic study, especially for cases cytologically diagnosed as squamous carcinoma.\r"

Comprehensive fat-clearing pathologically upstaged 29% of the authors' eligible specimens.

The authors evaluated whether the measurement of these molecules could help to discriminate between benign and malignant forms of pheochromocytoma. The NSE levels were normal in all patients with benign pheochromocytoma (n = 13) and elevated in one half of those with malignant pheochromocytoma (n = 13). Plasma NPY levels were on the average significantly higher in the malignant (177.1 +/- 38.9 pmol/l, n = 16) than in the benign forms of the disease (15.7 +/- 389 pmol/l, n = 24). However, there was no difference in the percentage of patients with elevated NPY levels. These results show that determination of serum NSE may be useful for distinguishing between malignant and benign pheochromocytoma; the measurement of plasma NPY is not useful for differentiating the two kinds of tumors.\r"

An algorithm was developed for calculation of the likelihood ratio of the probabilities that measured DNA index differences between multiple tumor localizations within the same patient could be attributed to measurement variation or to true biologic DNA content differences. The results of this statistical analysis show that in 72% of the cases (31 of 43) this probability ratio exceeded 1. Because the probability that two independent tumors will have a near-identical aneuploid DNA content is very low, this finding supports a metastatic process rather than the occurrence of multiple primary tumors in these patients. Thus, flow cytometric DNA-ploidy analysis can be helpful in the identification of metastatic disease in patients with multiple female genital tract malignant tumors.\r"

A high proportion (24%) of the cases were unclassifiable, according to Kiel, because of the precise terms of the classification. The \"favorable\"-prognosis NHL, according to Rappaport, or the low-grade NHL, according to Kiel and the WF, had a more indolent clinical course. However, except for the nodular mixed (Rappaport) or follicular mixed (WF) lymphomas which appeared to behave like the more aggressive NHL, a plateau was not seen in the survival curves of our patients with other kinds of favorable-prognosis or low-grade NHL, indicating the lack of curative potential of these tumors. The lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma, according to Kiel, also appeared to have a more aggressive clinical course. A plateau was seen in most of the other survival curves of patients with the more aggressive tumors, indicating the prospect of cure. However, the prognosis of the very aggressive tumors such as the diffuse lymphoblastic and diffuse small noncleaved cell lymphomas, according to the WF, remains very poor with a median survival of less than 10 months.\r"

Before the initiation of craniospinal radiation, the patient developed progressive disease, deteriorated, and died 9 months after the onset of symptoms.\r"

Recurrence of symptoms led to recatheterization, which in addition to restenosis of the original angioplasty site showed diffuse narrowing of the arterial segment that contained the retained wire fragment. This occurred despite systemic anticoagulation with Coumadin in the interval between procedures. Thus retained guide wire fragments in patent coronary arteries may cause arterial narrowing despite systemic anticoagulation.\r"

Vessel closure depends upon successful thrombus formation around the coil. Since systemic anticoagulation with heparin is commonly used during catheterization and cardiac surgery, we studied the effect of systemic heparinization on the efficiency of vessel occlusion by coil embolization in lambs. Catheters inserted in femoral arteries were used to arteriographically locate and size 36 systemic arteries in 9 lambs weighing 4.2 to 7.4 kg. Twenty-four vessels were embolized prior to heparinization with 400 u/kg heparin, IV. Effective anticoagulation was demonstrated by post-heparin activated clotting time (ACT) values greater than 300 sec. Seven vessels (29%) were not successfully coil-embolized because of inadequate coil position or distant embolization of the coil; 17 (71%) of these vessels were shown to be successfully occluded by arteriography 6 to 77 min later. After a period of systemic heparinization ranging from 71 to 159 min, 9/17 arteries remained occluded, 7/17 could not be examined arteriographically due to early demise of the animal, and only 1/17 showed recanalization. A second group of 12 vessels were embolized after heparinization. Eight (75%) were successfully occluded, and 4 (25%) were not successfully coil-embolized because of inadequate coil position or coil embolization to distant arteries. We conclude that systemic heparinization had no measurable effect on occlusion rates in coil-embolized systemic arteries in the lamb. These data support the use of systemic heparinization, when indicated, during or following therapeutic coil embolization in children.\r"

  ".W": "Estimation of the aortic valve gradient by simultaneous recording of left ventricular and peripheral arterial pressures is subject to error due to delay and modulation of the arterial pressure contour as it propagates from the ascending aorta. This error can be corrected by averaging the mean gradients derived from unaltered and temporally aligned simultaneous left ventricular-peripheral arterial pressure tracings. In 26 patients with aortic stenosis and simultaneous recordings of ascending aortic and femoral arterial pressure we compared this method with a simplified approach in which the peripheral arterial pressure is partially aligned by advancing it against the left ventricular pressure by 50% of the time delay of the simultaneously recorded upstrokes. Gradients measured this way predicted the true aortic valve gradients (left ventricular-ascending aortic) with a mean difference of +1.1 mm Hg (range = +10 to -5 mm Hg). We recommend use of this simplified method of correction because it predicts true aortic valve gradient equally well as the averaging technique (r = 0.977 vs. 0.979) and requires half the time and effort.\r"

  ".W": "Recent reports have suggested that angioplasty may cause or accelerate coronary arterial stenoses secondary to traumatic injury. Ninety-four coronary angiograms performed in a 1 yr period were reviewed in patients who had successful coronary angioplasty 6 to 30 mo (mean 10.7) prior to restudy. Restenosis was found in 43 of 140 dilated lesions (31%) and in 41 of 94 patients (44%). Thirty-three (35%) patients had new or progressive lesions outside the angioplasty site. New or progressive lesions occurred with similar frequency in the arteries that did not have angioplasty (23/155 = 15%) as in the arteries that did (13/127 = 10%; chi-square n.s.). In the arteries which underwent angioplasty, new or progressive lesions occurred as commonly proximal to the PTCA site (7/14, 50%) as distal (6/13, 46%). New or progressive lesions occurred in 29% of patients with concomitant restenosis, and 40% of those without restenosis (chi-square n.s.). No clinical, angiographic, or procedural factors distinguished patients with new and progressive lesions in target vessels from those without these lesions in target vessels. Patients with progressive lesions anywhere in the coronary tree were more likely to have had a shorter duration of anginal symptoms before angioplasty and a family history of coronary disease when compared with patients without progressive atherosclerosis. In conclusion, new and progressive lesions outside the angioplasty site occur after the procedure but appear unrelated to the restenosis process or traumatic injury by angioplasty instrumentation.\r"

Other anomalies may be associated with potentially serious sequelae such as angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, syncope, cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, or sudden death. Potentially serious anomalies include: 1) ectopic coronary origin from the pulmonary artery; 2) ectopic coronary origin from the opposite aortic sinus; 3) single coronary artery; and 4) large coronary fistulae.

During 3 min occlusions of the left main coronary artery with the autoperfusion catheter, regional myocardial blood flow was preserved at 0.60 +/- 0.14 ml/min/g, compared with 0.07 +/- 0.03 ml/min/g during inflation with standard balloon catheters (P less than 0.01). Similarly, at the end of 3 min of inflation, left ventricular systolic pressure and dP/dt were maintained with autoperfusion catheter inflation, but they were severely depressed after standard angioplasty balloon inflation. All seven dogs survived autoperfusion balloon inflation, whereas five of seven developed sustained ventricular tachycardia and/or ventricular fibrillation during or after standard balloon inflation. Thus, distal blood flow, hemodynamics, and survival were preserved during autoperfusion balloon inflation in the left main coronary artery.\r"

  ".W": "Retrograde crossing of valvular aortic stenosis can be challenging even to experienced angiographers. In 446 of 447 consecutive patients with aortic stenosis catheterized during the past 3 years, a technique using a standard Judkins right coronary catheter and a floppy straight tipped guide wire was successful in rapidly and efficiently crossing these pathologically distorted valves in retrograde fashion. Once the valve was crossed, the coronary catheter was replaced with a pigtail catheter for pressure and ventriculography. The majority of these valves required less than 2 min to cross using this technique. This method is valuable in limiting the time required for catheterization, thus helping to reduce procedure related morbidity in these oftimes critically ill patients.\r"

Complications of this procedure, particularly an atrial septal defect following transseptal approach, are generally of minor clinical significance. We describe a woman who initially underwent a successful percutaneous double-balloon mitral valvuloplasty via the transseptal approach. Three months later she presented with right-sided heart failure. Color Doppler echocardiography and cardiac catheterization demonstrated an atrial septal defect (ASD) as well as restenosis of the mitral valve. We conclude that significant ASDs may occur following transseptal mitral valvuloplasty with appearance of right ventricular failure and that color Doppler imaging aids in the diagnosis of this new variant of the classical Lutembacher syndrome.\r"

In comparison with baseline measurements, nitrous oxide administration resulted in small but statistically significant (P less than 0.05) changes in mean arterial pressure (76 +/- 14 to 67 +/- 12), mean pulmonary arterial pressure (37 +/- 14 to 33 +/- 13 mmHg), and cardiac output (3.7 +/- 1.4 to 3.2 +/- 1.1 L.min-1). Seventy per cent nitrogen resulted in no significant changes from baseline. The repeat 100 per cent oxygen measurements were nearly identical to the nitrous oxide measurements. It is concluded that nitrous oxide does not exacerbate pulmonary hypertension or ventricular dysfunction during high-dose fentanyl anaesthesia in patients with mitral valvular disease.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of sufentanil 1 micrograms.kg-1 during N2O-O2 and intermittent isoflurane anaesthesia in major non-cardiac surgery. Thirty-one patients (18 females, 13 males; mean age 47 yr), undergoing cholecystectomy received a 1 microgram.kg-1 bolus of sufentanil before the induction of anaesthesia with thiopentone. On average, three sufentanil increments were administered, to a total (bolus + maintenance) dose of 1.5 micrograms.kg-1. Cardiovascular stability was not achieved in eleven patients who then were given isoflurane. The arterial pressure decreased after sufentanil (P less than 0.05), reaching a nadir (mean 108/65 mmHg, heart rate 63 bpm) at one minute post-incision. Clinically important hypertension or hypotension did not occur in any patient. One patient, receiving beta-blocker therapy, required atropine to control bradycardia. Postoperative respiratory depression did not occur in patients who received less than one micrograms.kg-1.hr-1 with the last increment being given more than 20 minutes before the end of anaesthesia. Slight respiratory depression in the recovery room was reported in one patient, who had received a total of 1.3 micrograms.kg-1.hr-1 of sufentanil, and the last sufentanil increment 24 min before the end of surgery. The most frequently reported side-effects were nausea (35 per cent) and vomiting (23 per cent). Induction, maintenance and recovery from anaesthesia were rated as \"good\" in 87, 87, and 74 per cent of the cases, respectively, and \"satisfactory\" in the remainder. We conclude that this technique is valuable to assure good protection of the cardiovascular system without undue respiratory depression during recovery.\r"

  ".U": "91004542\r", 
  ".W": "This retrospective study was undertaken to assess the efficacy and safety of epidural morphine in providing analgesia following Caesarean section under epidural anaesthesia. The morphine was administered as a single bolus, following delivery, in doses ranging from 2 to 5 mg. The charts of 4880 Caesarean sections, performed on 4500 patients, were reviewed. The duration of analgesia and the occurrence of any symptoms which might be side-effects of the epidural morphine were recorded. The duration of analgesia was 22.9 +/- 10.1 hr and was not correlated with the dose of epidural morphine. Eleven per cent of the patients required no supplemental analgesia during the first 48 hr. Twelve patients (0.25 per cent) had respiratory rates less than 10 breaths per minute, on at least one occasion. No serious sequelae resulted from these periods of bradypnoea. Pruritus occurred in 58 per cent of patients, nausea and vomiting in 39.9 per cent and dizziness in ten per cent. Herpes simplex labialis was recorded in 3.5 per cent of patients. Epidural morphine is thus confirmed as an effective analgesic technique post-Caesarean section with 3 mg being the optimal dose. Even in this young healthy patient population, clinically detectable respiratory depression occurs so clinical respiratory monitoring is indicated.\r"

The mother's lungs were then ventilated using 100 per cent oxygen until the baby was delivered. Intraoperative maternal awareness was assessed by the isolated forearm technique. The Apgar scores of the newborn at one and five minutes, as well as their umbilical vein blood gases were also evaluated and correlated with the induction-to-delivery (I-D) and the uterine incision-to-delivery (U-D) intervals. In 13 patients (Group A) the I-D interval was less than 10 min and U-D interval less than 90 sec, while in seven (Group B) the I-D interval was greater than or equal to 10 min and the U-D interval greater than or equal to 90 sec. The isolated arm test was negative in all patients having an I-D interval less than 10 min, and was positive in three patients when the I-D interval exceeded ten minutes. The newborns of group A showed higher Apgar scores at one minute, as well as higher umbilical vein PO2 than was achieved in Group B. It was concluded that the technique used was not associated with maternal awareness or neonatal depression, provided that the I-D interval was less than 10 min and the U-D interval was less than 90 sec.\r"

Patients in all groups received oral ranitidine 150 mg 2-3 hr before the scheduled time of surgery. Those in Group 1 also received oral metoclopramide 10 mg one hour before surgery, and sodium citrate 0.3 M 30 ml on call to the operating room; Group 2 received sodium citrate but no metoclopramide; Group 3 received metoclopramide but no sodium citrate; Group 4 received ranitidine alone. Following induction of anaesthesia a #18 Salem sump tube was passed into the stomach and all available gastric fluid was aspirated. Volumes were recorded and pH measured. In all groups mean pH was greater than 5.8, although at least one patient in each group had pH less than 2.5. Mean volumes were significantly greater in patients who received citrate (Groups 1 and 2: 22 and 19 ml) than in those in those who did not (Groups 3 and 4: 10 and 8 ml). One patient in Group 2 and one in Group 3 had pH less than 2.5 with volume greater than 25 ml. Our results do not demonstrate any advantage of double or triple prophylaxis over ranitidine alone. The practical difficulty of correctly administering two or even three medications, each at different but exact preoperative intervals, is emphasized.\r"

In 24 patients undergoing open heart surgery, temperatures were measured during the rapid warming phase on bypass (12-35 min). Scattergrams of temperature vs time for the four temperature sites each contained 150 data points. Polynomial regression analysis revealed that LCT, but not axillary or rectal temperatures, correlated with oesophageal temperature. We conclude that forehead LCT may be useful to monitor temperature trends and to detect rapid elevations in body temperature when more invasive temperature monitoring is inappropriate or unavailable.\r"

There is a loss of cellular integrity and function, with increased production of prostaglandins, free radicals, and acidosis with lactate accumulation. These events may be exacerbated by glucose administration. Pharmacological agents aimed at alleviating ischaemic injury could be directed at decreasing cerebral metabolic requirements for oxygen, improving flow to ischaemic areas, preventing Ca+(+)-induced injury, inhibition of free radical formation, lactate removal, inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, and prevention of complement-mediated leukocyte aggregation.

A radiochemical assay was used in the determination of ChAT activity using purified placental enzyme. Pancuronium at concentrations of 10(-7) M, 10(-6) M, 10(-5) M, 10(-4) M, and 10(-3) M inhibited ChAT activity by 3, 10, 15, 40 and 85 per cent, respectively; vecuronium at concentrations of 10(-6) M, 10(-5) M, 10(-4) M, and 10(-3) M inhibited ChAT activity by 5, 10, 26 and 57 per cent, respectively; d-tubocurarine at concentrations of 10(-6) M, 10(-5) M, 10(-4) M, and 10(-3) M inhibited ChAT activity by 0, 4, 12.5 and 29 per cent, respectively; whereas succinylcholine at concentrations of 10(-7) M, 10(-6) M, 10(-5) M, and 10(-4) M activated ChAT activity by 8, 10, 1, and 2 per cent, respectively. Even though our present data demonstrated a significant dose-dependent inhibitory effect on ChAT activity by pancuronium, vecuronium and d-tubocurarine, it is unlikely that this inhibitory effect will contribute to the mechanism of action of NDMR. Our data, however, may suggest an additional mechanism for the phenomena of tetanic and train-of-four fades that are seen following the administration of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants.\r"

The role of Ca++ in the bathing medium and the consequences of substitution of Sr++ for Ca++ in the response to agents associated with malignant hyperthermia were examined. When Ca++ was omitted from the bathing medium the contractures induced in human vastus lateralis by halothane (three per cent) or succinylcholine (50 mM) were reduced by 80 and 100 per cent, respectively, while contractures induced by caffeine (8 mM) were only reduced by 50 per cent. Substitution of Ca++ by another divalent cation, Sr++, completely restored contractures induced by caffeine, but only partially restored contractures induced by halothane or succinylcholine (to 50 and 30 per cent of Ca(++)-containing medium, respectively). Mepacrine (10 microM) was effective in antagonizing contractures by caffeine, whereas verapamil and nifedipine (10 microM) were not. These results support an essential role for extracellular Ca++ not fulfilled by Sr++ in contracture induction by halothane and succinylcholine, but not by caffeine.\r"

The principal reasons for surgery-related admissions were postoperative bleeding, complications, the need for further surgery, the requirement for prolonged postoperative care, and pain. Urology had a particularly high percentage of admissions compared with its workload, because of the diagnostic nature of much of the work. Anaesthesia-related admissions included \"syncope,\" lack of an accompanying adult, aspiration pneumonitis and coincident acute disease. Twelve of the 14 patients admitted with syncope had surgery in the afternoon and had received less than ideal amounts of intravenous fluid. Seven of the 12 ASA physical status II patients admitted had an admission diagnosis related to the coincident disease.\r"

  ".W": "When applied extracellularly in the micromolar range, ATP and related compounds induced a positive inotropy in the rat papillary muscle. This was also true in the rat auricle after pertussis toxin treatment. Then, in both tissues, ATP further increased the contraction after a maximal beta-adrenergic stimulation. The increase in contractile force could be related to the increase in the calcium current. The L-type calcium current was measured by whole-cell patch-clamp recording in single cells isolated from the rat ventricle after the sodium and potassium currents were inhibited by tetrodotoxin and cesium, respectively. When added alone, 10 microM ATP increased the calcium current by 60%. Adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) was also able to increase calcium current. Adenosine was much less effective, and GTP, UTP, CTP, and ITP were without effect. A similar increase in calcium current was observed when ATP was added in addition to a maximal stimulation by a beta-adrenergic agonist or after internal perfusion with cyclic AMP. However, this increase was preceded by a transient decrease whose origin could not be attributed to a P1-purinergic agonistic effect of ATP. The transient decrease was not elicited by adenosine or in a magnesium-free HEPES solution and was not suppressed after pertussis toxin treatment. This effect appeared related to the variations in the holding current also observed upon ATP application. Together with vasodilation, ATP and adenine compounds induced positive inotropy. The latter effect could be attributed in part to the increase in calcium current and was independent of cyclic AMP. Both effects are complementary with the beta-adrenergic stimulation and can help healthy cells to compensate the failing zone from which ATP could be released.\r"

Characterization of receptors present on submucosal arterioles has not been carried out, because these vessels have not been accessible to study by previous methods. We have used a novel optical method for on-line tracking of outside diameter from in vitro preparations of submucosal arterioles in the ileum and colon of guinea pigs, rabbits, and humans to characterize the vasoconstrictor responses to vasopressin as well as other vasopressor agents along the gastrointestinal tract. All ileal submucosal arterioles showed smoothly graded constrictor responses, whereas colonic arterioles from each species exhibited rhythmic vasoconstrictions. Vasopressin constricted guinea pig and human submucosal arterioles (EC50, 1 nM) by activating classical V1 receptors; dissociation equilibrium constants (Kd) for the V1 antagonist d(CH2)5 Tyr (Me) arginine vasopressin were 1-3 nM. This antagonist was 10-50-fold more potent in inhibiting vasopressin constrictions in rabbit submucosal arterioles (Kd = 0.05-0.1 nM). No evidence for the presence of V2 receptors was obtained in any arteriole, and no significant differences in the alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated constrictions were observed in these vessels. Results from this study suggest the presence of heterogeneity of V1 receptors in submucosal arterioles; these differences appear to be species dependent. Our results also suggest that intrinsic vasoconstrictor properties of submucosal arterioles differ along the length of the gastrointestinal tract; these differences appear to be species independent.\r"

It is unclear, however, which mechanisms mediate this effect. In view of the significance attached to endothelial injury in the initial phases of atherogenesis, we decided to test whether sympathetic activation might lead to an increase in endothelial injury. Chloralose anesthesia was used to induce sympathetic activation and the presence of intracellular IgG as a criterion of endothelial cell injury. The beta 1-selective beta-blocker metoprolol was used to evaluate if the effect(s) of sympathetic activation might be mediated by beta 1-adrenoceptors. In normal rabbits, the frequency of injured endothelial cells in unbranched areas of the thoracic aorta was 0.23%, compared with 1.93% in circumostial areas. Chloralose anesthesia caused significant increases in blood pressure, heart rate, and plasma norepinephrine, that is, caused sympathetic activation, and led to an approximately fivefold increase in the number of injured cells both in unbranched and in circumostial areas. This increase was totally inhibited by metoprolol pretreatment, indicating that it was mediated by beta 1-receptors. These observations suggest one possible mechanism that may connect sympathetic activation with atherogenesis and explain why beta-blockade protects against atherosclerosis.\r"

The hypertrophic process can be considered heterogeneous based on whether it also includes a remodeling and accumulation of fibrillar types I and III collagens that are responsible for impaired myocardial stiffness. In the heart, the messenger RNA (mRNA) for fibrillar collagen types I and III has been detected only in cardiac fibroblasts, whereas mRNA for basement membrane collagen type IV is present in both fibroblasts and myocytes. We studied the early and long-term expression of these collagenous proteins in rat myocardium after abdominal aortic banding with renal ischemia. Complementary DNA probes for rat pro-alpha 2 (I), mouse type III and mouse type IV collagens, and chicken beta-actin were used. Northern and dot blot analysis on total RNA extracted from left ventricular tissue indicated a sixfold increase in steady-state levels of mRNA for collagen type I on day 3 of abdominal aortic banding, which had declined to control levels by day 7 where it remained rather constant at 4 and 8 weeks. Type III collagen showed a similar pattern of gene expression after banding. mRNA levels for type IV collagen, on the other hand, were elevated on day 1 after banding, returning to control at day 7 and remaining constant. Actin mRNA levels also increased on day 1 of banding, followed by a rapid return to control levels. Monospecific antibody to types I and III collagens and immunofluorescent light microscopy on frozen sections of the myocardium revealed that at 1 week after banding, the distribution and density of these collagens were similar to those of control animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We studied the changes in pulmonary hemodynamics and lung wet weight induced with opsonized zymosan (OZ) in isolated guinea pig lungs perfused with Ringer-albumin solution containing neutrophils (PMNs). Addition of OZ to the PMN-perfused lungs caused pulmonary vasoconstriction and weight gain; neither OZ nor PMNs added individually to the perfusate altered pulmonary vasomotor tone or wet weight. The steady gain in lung weight by 1,588 +/- 464 mg over the 45-minute study period was associated with pulmonary capillary hypertension and an increase in the capillary filtration coefficient, indicative of increased lung vascular permeability. These responses may not be due to generation of oxygen radicals, because the alterations in pulmonary hemodynamics and lung weight were not reduced by addition of superoxide dismutase, catalase, or superoxide dismutase plus catalase. We examined the basis of the PMN-mediated effects by layering PMNs on bovine pulmonary artery endothelial monolayers. Challenge with OZ resulted in increased endothelial permeability to 125I-albumin. The monoclonal antibody IB4 (directed against CD18, the common beta-subunit of structurally related adhesion receptors on phagocytes, LFA-1, Mac-1, and P150,95) prevented the OZ-mediated increase in PMN adherence to endothelial cells and the increase in endothelial permeability to 125I-albumin. IB4 also inhibited the lung weight gain mediated by the OZ-stimulated PMNs in intact lungs. The protective effect of IB4 could be ascribed neither to inhibition of uptake of OZ by PMNs nor to inhibition of release of oxygen radicals, myeloperoxidase, and elastase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We investigated in a physiological salt solution (PSS) containing HCO3- the intracellular pH (pHi) regulating mechanisms in smooth muscle cells cultured from human internal mammary arteries, using the pH-sensitive dye 2',7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) and 22Na+ influx rates. The recovery of pHi from an equivalent intracellular acidosis was more rapid when the cells were incubated in CO2/HCO3(-)-buffered PSS than in HEPES-buffered PSS. Recovery of pHi was dependent on extracellular Na+ (Km, 13.1 mM); however, it was not attenuated by 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (SITS), indicating the absence of SITS-sensitive HCO3(-)-dependent mechanisms. Recovery instead appeared mostly dependent on processes sensitive to 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EIPA), indicating the involvement of Na+/H+ exchange and a previously undescribed EIPA-sensitive Na(+)- and HCO3(-)-dependent mechanism. Differentiation between this HCO3(-)-dependent mechanism and Na+/H+ exchange was achieved after depletion of cellular ATP. Under these conditions, the NH4Cl-induced 22Na+ influx rate stimulated by intracellular acidosis was markedly attenuated in HEPES-buffered PSS but not in CO2/HCO3(-)-buffered PSS. EIPA also appeared to inhibit the two mechanisms differentially. In HEPES-buffered PSS containing 20 mM Na+, the EIPA inhibition curve for the intracellular acidosis-induced 22Na+ influx was monophasic (IC50, 39 nM), whereas in an identical CO2/HCO3(-)-buffered PSS, the inhibition curve exhibited biphasic characteristics (IC50, 37.3 nM and 312 microM). Taken together, the results indicate that Na+/H+ exchange and a previously undescribed EIPA-sensitive Na(+)- and HCO3(-)-dependent mechanism play an important role in regulating the pHi of human vascular smooth muscle. The involvement of the latter mechanism depends on the severity of the intracellular acidosis, varying from approximately 25% in severe intracellular acidosis up to 50% at lesser, more physiological, levels of induced acidosis.\r"

  ".W": "A theoretical model has been developed to simulate blood flow through large microcirculatory networks. The model takes into account the dependence of apparent viscosity of blood on vessel diameter and hematocrit (the Fahraeus-Lindqvist effect), the reduction of intravascular hematocrit relative to the inflow hematocrit of a vessel (the Fahraeus effect), and the disproportionate distribution of red blood cells and plasma at arteriolar bifurcations (phase separation). The model was used to simulate flow in three microvascular networks in the rat mesentery with 436,583, and 913 vessel segments, respectively, using experimental data (length, diameter, and topological organization) obtained from the same networks. Measurements of hematocrit and flow direction in all vessel segments of these networks tested the validity of model results. These tests demonstrate that the prediction of parameters for individual vessel segments in large networks exhibits a high degree of uncertainty; for example, the squared coefficient of correlation between predicted and measured hematocrit of single vessel segments ranges only between 0.15 and 0.33. In contrast, the simulation of integrated characteristics of the network hemodynamics, such as the mean segment hematocrit or the distribution of blood flow velocities, is very precise. In addition, the following conclusions were derived from the comparison of predicted and measured values: 1) The low capillary hematocrits found in mesenteric microcirculatory networks as well as their heterogeneity can be explained on the basis of the Fahraeus effect and phase-separation phenomena. 2) The apparent viscosity of blood in vessels of the investigated tissue with diameters less than 15 microns is substantially higher than expected compared with measurements in glass tubes with the same diameter.\r"

  ".W": "We determined the effects of changing the spatial dispersion of acetylcholine release on the phase-dependent chronotropic responses to vagal stimulation in anesthetized dogs. We stimulated the vagus nerves with one brief burst of electrical pulses each cardiac cycle, and we changed the timing of the stimulus by a small, constant amount each cardiac cycle to scan the entire cycle. To vary the heterogeneity of acetylcholine release, we changed the voltage of the stimulus pulses over a range of submaximal values. To achieve the maximum homogeneity of acetylcholine release, we used supramaximal voltages, and we varied the level of acetylcholine release from each excited fiber by changing the number of pulses per burst. We used the average cardiac cycle length of the phase-response curve to assess the overall vagal effect, independent of its timing within the cardiac cycle. We found that the amplitude of the phase-response curve varied directly and the minimum-to-maximum phase difference varied inversely with the overall efficacy of vagal activity. However, for any given alteration in the overall efficacy, the specific changes in the characteristics of the phase-response curve did not depend on whether the alteration was achieved by varying the number of pulses per burst or by varying the stimulus voltage. Therefore, we conclude that although the cardiac chronotropic response is very sensitive to changes in the timing of vagal stimulation, it is not influenced appreciably by the spatial dispersion of acetylcholine release from the vagal nerve endings over a wide range of stimulation strengths.\r"

Dextran was more effective in expanding plasma volume (63 +/- 15% [mean +/- SD]) than saline (11 +/- 6%) at the end of the 30-minute infusion. Pulmonary vascular pressures increased after dextran and remained elevated for 8 hours, whereas after saline the pressures returned to baseline within 1 hour. After dextran, lung lymph flow increased and remained elevated. It was only transiently increased after saline. We confirmed that dextran equilibrated rapidly with lung lymph (half-time, less than 0.6 hour), even though it maintained plasma volume expansion for the whole body (half-time, 11.1 +/- 2.7 hours). The dextran increased both plasma and lymph total macromolecular osmotic pressure but did not increase the plasma-interstitial (lymph) osmotic pressure difference in the lung, except transiently during the infusion. The lymph/plasma protein concentration ratio increased after dextran due mainly to plasma protein dilution. There were no differences in the half-time of tracer albumin equilibration between plasma and lung lymph (control, 2.2 +/- 0.6 hours; saline, 2.0 +/- 0.6 hours; dextran, 2.3 +/- 0.6 hours). Dextran 70 increased liquid filtration mainly by increasing microvascular pressure and possibly filtration surface area. There was no evidence for a change in the leakiness of the lung microvascular barrier to albumin.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of an increase in vascular tone on responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation and the receptors mediating these responses were investigated in the pulmonary vascular bed of the cat. Under conditions of controlled blood flow and constant left atrial pressure, stimulation of the sympathetic nerves to the lung elicited a biphasic response characterized by an initial increase in lobar arterial pressure followed closely by a decrease. The response to nerve stimulation was reproducible with respect to time and was not altered when a delay coil was added to the perfusion circuit, indicating that the response was directly mediated. The increase in pressure was reduced by prazosin and by yohimbine, whereas the decrease in pressure was blocked by propranolol or ICI 118551. These data suggest that the pressor component of the response is mediated by alpha 1- and postjunctional alpha 2-adrenoceptors, whereas the depressor response is mediated by beta 2-receptors. The pressor response was enhanced by propranolol or ICI 118551, whereas the depressor response was enhanced by prazosin or yohimbine, suggesting that the response to nerve stimulation represents the net effect of the actions of neuronally released norepinephrine on alpha- and beta-receptors. The pressor response to nerve stimulation was enhanced when tone was elevated with a prostaglandin endoperoxide analogue and when beta-receptors were blocked. The effects of an increase in tone and a passive increase in pressure on responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation were different.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Mean arterial pressure, left ventricular pressure and its first derivative (dP/dt), and heart rate were comparable in rat groups up to 20 months. During the interval from 20 to 29 months, elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and decreased dP/dt indicated that a significant impairment of ventricular function occurred with senescence. In the period between 4 and 12 months, a reduction of nearly 19% in the total number of myocytes was measured in both ventricles. In the subsequent ages, similar decreases in myocyte cell number were found in the left ventricle, whereas in the right ventricle, the initial loss was fully reversed by 20 months. Moreover, from 20 to 29 months, a 59% increase in the aggregate number of myocytes occurred in the right ventricular myocardium. In the left ventricle, a 3% increment was also seen, but this small change was not statistically significant. These estimations of myocyte cellular hyperplasia, however, were complicated by the fact that cell loss continued to take place with age. The volume fraction of collagen in the tissue, in fact, progressively increased from 8% and 7% at 4 months to 16% and 22% at 29 months in the left and right ventricles, respectively. In conclusion, myocyte cellular hyperplasia tends to regenerate the ventricular mass being lost with age in the adult mammalian rat heart.\r"

  ".W": "It has been claimed that the mechanical performance and the related energy turnover of the left ventricle can be reliably predicted on the basis of its time-varying elastance behavior. In its most elementary form, this behavior can be mathematically described by E(t) = P(t)/[V(t)-Vd], where E is ventricular elastance, t is time, P is ventricular pressure, V is ventricular volume, and Vd is the intercept of the end-systolic pressure-volume line on the volume axis. To find out how this behavior of the ventricle as a whole is related to the properties of the myocardium, we tested the energetic prediction for the ventricle that the pressure-volume area of an isovolumic contraction equals the energy released in relaxation in experiments on isolated rabbit papillary muscle at 20 degrees C. To that end, the energy (joules) contained by the force-length area of the muscles, contracting isometrically, was compared with the heat (joules) liberated in relaxation as measured with thermopiles. Mechanical performance of the muscles was varied by altering initial muscle length and external calcium. The slope of the resulting relation between force-length area and heat liberated in relaxation (n = 26) was not significantly different from unity. Thus, the energetic prediction of the time-varying elastance model developed for the whole left ventricle was confirmed by experiments on rabbit papillary muscle at 20 degrees C.\r"

During a continuous infusion of L-[ring-2,6-3H]phenylalanine to anesthetized, overnight-fasted dogs, we measured the uptake of radiolabeled phenylalanine from plasma and the release of unlabeled phenylalanine from myocardial proteolysis using arterial and coronary sinus catheterization and analytic methods previously applied to skeletal muscle. Using these measurements, together with a model of myocardial protein synthesis that assumes rapid equilibration of tracer specific activity between myocardial phenylalanyl-tRNA and circulating phenylalanine, we estimated the rates of heart protein synthesis and degradation. The rate of heart protein synthesis was also estimated directly from the incorporation of labeled phenylalanine into tissue protein. The use of [3H]phenylalanine was compared with L-[1-14C]leucine in the measurement of heart protein turnover in dogs given simultaneous infusion of both tracers. Leucine uptake and release by the myocardium exceeded that of phenylalanine by 3.1 +/- 0.4- and 1.7 +/- 0.3-fold, respectively, consistent with leucine's 2.4-fold greater abundance in heart protein and its metabolism via other pathways. Phenylalanine is the preferred tracer for use with this method because of its limited metabolic fate in muscle. One theoretical limitation to the method, slow equilibration of circulating labeled phenylalanine with myocardial phenylalanyl-tRNA, was resolved by comparison of these specific activities after a 30-minute infusion of labeled phenylalanine in the rat. A second, empirical limitation involves precision in the measurement of the small decrements in phenylalanine specific activity that occur with each pass of blood through the coronary circulation. This was addressed by improving the precision of both the measurements of phenylalanine concentration and phenylalanine specific activity using high-performance liquid chromatography. We conclude that the in vivo measurement of phenylalanine tracer exchange across the myocardium permits the nondestructive estimation of heart protein turnover in the intact animal.\r"

  ".W": "Inotropic interventions were compared with respect to their maximum effect on force of contraction in rat myocardium to identify limiting steps in calcium handling. Peak force, sarcomere length, and action potentials were measured in thin ventricular trabeculae. Relevant control conditions were stimulation frequency, 0.2 Hz; [Ca2+]o, 1 mM; [K+]o, 5 mM; [Na+]o, 150 mM. The inotropic interventions and results were as follows. 1) The interventions of high [Ca2+]o, low [Na+]o, high [K+]o, addition of tetraethylammonium chloride, or postextrasystolic potentiation resulted in approximately the same (within 5%) maximum force (Fmax). Above the respective optimum doses, force declined and aftercontractions were often observed. Combinations of the different interventions never enhanced force to above Fmax. This suggests that Fmax is determined by a maximum level of Ca2+ in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, above which spontaneous release occurs. 2) Sr2+ (10 mM) caused an increase of force to 1.3 X Fmax and lengthening of contraction and action potentials. The force-sarcomere length relation was, then, similar to that in skinned fibers at maximum activation. Hence, 1.3 X Fmax reflects saturation of the sarcomeres. We postulate that a large influx of Sr2+ during the long action potential can circumvent the reticulum and activate the sarcomeres directly. When the reticulum was blocked with ryanodine, maximum force of tetanic contractions was about 1.1 X Fmax. This result supports the above conclusions. 3) Isoproterenol increased force to a maximum that was 20% below Fmax and shortened the contraction. This may be due to a decreased sensitivity of the sarcomeres to Ca2+ or to stimulation of the Ca2+ pump in the reticulum, that is, an increasing fraction of the released Ca2+ is sequestered before it can activate the sarcomeres. Thus, three factors that limit force production were identified, depending on the inotropic stimulus.\r"

  ".W": "Coronary arterial pressure and flow are known to influence left ventricular (LV) diastolic distensibility, but the influence of coronary venous pressure is unknown. To test the hypothesis that increased coronary venous pressure leads to an increase in LV wall volume and a decrease in LV diastolic distensibility, we studied excised, blood-perfused LV isovolumic dog hearts without the pericardium. In protocol I (n = 8), to raise coronary venous pressure the pressure of right atrium (RA) and right ventricle (RV) was increased by the height of a blood reservoir connected with a cannula that opened in both the RA and RV. In protocol II (n = 7), to isolate the effect of RV enlargement on LV diastolic distensibility (direct ventricular interaction), an isovolumic RV balloon was used with coronary venous pressure held constant at 0 mm Hg. Changes in LV diastolic distensibility were assessed by shifts of the LV end-diastolic pressure-volume relation. Changes in LV wall volume were detected by subepicardial segment length at end-diastole. The mean pressures of RA and RV (protocol I) and RV balloon only (protocol II) were increased from 0 to 15 and 30 mm Hg over a range of LV volume. In protocol I, when RA.RV pressure was increased from 0 to 30 mm Hg at three levels of LV volume (22 +/- 2, 31 +/- 3, and 40 +/- 3 ml), LV end-diastolic pressures increased significantly from 5.2 +/- 0.3 to 11.2 +/- 1.5, from 10.4 +/- 0.3 to 18.2 +/- 1.2, and from 20.2 +/- 1.0 to 28.8 +/- 1.2 mm Hg, respectively. In protocol II, when RV balloon pressure was increased from 0 to 30 mm Hg at the three LV volumes (21 +/- 3, 31 +/- 3, and 41 +/- 4 ml), LV end-diastolic pressures showed smaller increases from 5.2 +/- 0.2 to 6.6 +/- 0.2, from 9.8 +/- 0.3 to 11.6 +/- 0.6, and from 19.0 +/- 0.5 to 21.4 +/- 0.8 mm Hg, respectively. In both protocols, the LV end-diastolic pressure-volume relation shifted upward in a nearly parallel fashion, but the shift was much greater in protocol I than in protocol II. Despite constant LV volume, an increase in LV wall dimension in protocol I was significant and much greater than that in protocol II. From these results, we conclude that increased coronary venous pressure decreases LV diastolic distensibility with increasing LV wall volume, and this mechanism appears to act independently of diastolic ventricular interaction caused by RV enlargement.\r"

One of the cDNAs encodes a previously isolated smooth muscle myosin RLC (also referred to as LC20-A); the other encodes a protein that shares 92% homology with the LC20-A isoform. The phosphorylatable threonine and serine residues at positions 18 and 19 of the two myosin RLC sequences are conserved. The two cDNAs are 81% homologous at the nucleotide level over the coding region; the 5' and 3' untranslated regions are divergent. Most of the DNA nonhomology in the coding region does not affect the protein sequence, indicating strong evolutionary conservation pressure to maintain the myosin RLC structure. Northern blot analysis using 3' untranslated region probes reveals restrictive tissue specific expression of one myosin RLC isoform (LC20-A) in smooth muscle tissue and not in other tissues examined. In contrast, the novel myosin RLC isoform messenger RNA (mRNA) is uniformly expressed in all smooth and nonmuscle tissues examined and is designated as cellular myosin RLC for this reason. Our results indicate that cellular and smooth muscle myosin RLC isoforms are distinct and are encoded by separate genes. This report describes the cloning of a novel vertebrate cellular myosin RLC mRNA that differs from previously characterized smooth muscle RLC isoform mRNAs in both primary sequence and expression pattern.\r"

When used alone, GRGDS totally inhibited ADP-induced aggregation of human platelets in platelet-rich plasma; however, the maximum inhibitory effect of the other peptides was less than 80%. The concentrations necessary to inhibit platelet aggregation in plasma by 50% were 100 mumols/l and 1 and 3.2 mmol/l for GRGDS, gamma-chain peptide, and GPRP, respectively. When evaluating the effect of peptide mixtures, we discovered that the combination GPRP + GRGDS worked together synergistically (p less than 0.001, analysis by surface response methodology), whereas GPRP + gamma-chain peptide did not. For example, our analysis indicated that a mixture of 50 mumols/l GRGDS plus 180 mumols/l GPRP would produce 50% inhibition of platelet aggregation. This is an effect twofold greater than that produced by 50 mumols/l GRGDS alone, and one that would require an 18-fold greater concentration of GPRP if used alone. These data indicate that the combination GPRP + GRGDS inhibited platelet aggregation in plasma in a synergistic fashion and suggest the potential value of their combined use in antithrombotic therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to compare the degree of ischemic and hypoxic injury in normal versus hypertrophied rat hearts to investigate basic mechanisms responsible for irreversible myocardial ischemic injury. Hearts from rats with bands placed on the aortic arch at 23 days of age (BAND) and sham-operated rats (SHAM, 8 weeks postoperative) were isolated, perfused with Krebs buffer, and had a left ventricular balloon to measure developed pressure. Hearts were made globally ischemic until they developed peak ischemic contracture and were reperfused for 30 minutes. Additional hearts were perfused for 15 minutes with glucose-free hypoxic buffer followed by 20 minutes of oxygenated perfusion. There was an 87% increase in heart weight of BAND compared with SHAM (p less than 0.01). During ischemia, lactate levels increased faster in BAND compared with SHAM, ischemic contracture occurred earlier in BAND than in SHAM despite no difference in ATP levels, and postischemic recovery of left ventricular pressure was less in BAND (26.8 +/- 5.6% of control left ventricular pressure, mean +/- SEM) compared with SHAM (40 +/- 4.6%, p less than 0.05). During hypoxic perfusion, lactate release was greater in BAND than in SHAM (48.8 +/- 1.2 versus 26.6 +/- 0.97 mumols/g, p less than 0.01), and with reoxygenation, lactate dehydrogenase release was less in BAND than in SHAM (13.2 +/- 0.7 versus 19.5 +/- 0.2 IU/g, p less than 0.01). After hypoxia and reoxygenation, left ventricular pressure recovery was greater in BAND than in SHAM (93 +/- 8.4% versus 66 +/- 5.3%, p less than 0.01). Thus, this study suggests that hypertrophied hearts have a greater potential for glycolytic metabolism, resulting in an increased rate of by-product accumulation during ischemia, which may be responsible for the increased susceptibility of hypertrophied hearts to ischemic injury.\r"

  ".W": "This study 1) compares the negative chronotropic and dromotropic actions of adenosine in guinea pig, rat, and rabbit hearts; 2) investigates the mechanism(s) for the different responses; and 3) determines the physiological implications. Isolated perfused hearts were instrumented for measurement of atrial rate and atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction time. Differences in metabolism of adenosine were determined in the absence and presence of dipyridamole (nucleoside uptake blocker) and erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine (EHNA, adenosine deaminase inhibitor). Dipyridamole plus EHNA decreased adenosine's EC50 for the negative dromotropic effect by 14-fold in guinea pig heart and 1.6-fold in rat heart. This is consistent with the greater number of [3H]nitrobenzylthioinosine binding sites measured in membranes from guinea pig (1,231 +/- 68 fmol/mg protein) compared with rat (302 +/- 31 fmol/mg protein) and rabbit (260 +/- 28 fmol/mg protein) atria. The potency of adenosine to slow atrial rate and prolong AV nodal conduction time was greater in guinea pig than in rat or rabbit hearts. This rank order of potency correlated well with the number of binding sites for the specific adenosine receptor radioligand 125I-aminobenzyladenosine in guinea pig (102 +/- 13 fmol/mg protein), rat (11 +/- 0.5 fmol/mg protein), and rabbit (8 +/- 1 fmol/mg protein) atrial membranes. Hypoxia increased the rate of adenosine release by severalfold and caused slowing of heart rate and AV block. In spontaneously beating hearts, the main effect of hypoxia was a slowing of ventricular rate, which in the guinea pig heart was due to AV block and in the rat heart to atrial slowing. In atrial paced hearts, hypoxia caused a marked prolongation of AV nodal conduction time in guinea pig (39 +/- 4 msec) and rabbit (29 +/- 5 msec) hearts, but only small effect in rat hearts (10 +/- 2 msec). The differences in response to hypoxia could be accounted for by the species-dependent differences in the 1) amount of adenosine released and metabolized, 2) sensitivity of the hearts to adenosine, and 3) dependency of AV nodal conduction on atrial rate. The findings indicate that the results from physiological or pharmacological studies on adenosine in one species may not be applicable to others, and the ultimate effect of adenosine and hypoxia is to slow ventricular rate.\r"

The inhibitory effect of LNMMA on cyclic GMP accumulation was partially reversed by treatment with L-arginine, but was unaffected by D-arginine. To determine the specific site of action of LNMMA, endothelial cells on microcarrier beads were placed in a column and superfused with buffer. The effluent from the column was collected in 30-second (1.5-ml) fractions into 2-cm2 monolayer wells of vascular smooth muscle cells before and after addition of agonists (bradykinin, A23187) to the column inflow. The cyclic GMP content of each well of smooth muscle cells was determined as an index of EDRF activity. LNMMA superfused through the endothelial cell column inhibited cyclic GMP accumulation in vascular smooth muscle cells induced by bradykinin and A23187. LNMMA introduced into the effluent from the endothelial cell column had no effect on smooth muscle cyclic GMP levels. We conclude that LNMMA is an effective, specific inhibitor of EDRF production or release, and its action is specific to the endothelial cell.\r"

  ".W": "Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) is a neuropeptide with potent circulatory effects in the adult animal and human. Little is known about its effects or mechanism of action in the immature animal. These series of experiments evaluated the effects and possible mechanism of action of VIP on the developing canine cardiovascular system. In all three series, measurements of mean heart rate and blood pressure were taken in the control state, after parasympathetic denervation with bilateral cervical vagotomies, and after autonomic blockade with propranolol (1 mg/kg) and phentolamine (0.5 mg i.v.). In series 1, we characterized the role of alpha-adrenergic receptors in early newborn puppies by investigating the hemodynamic effects of phentolamine alone in five early newborn puppies. In series 2, the hemodynamic effects of intravenous VIP infusion (0.2 microgram/kg/min) were recorded and compared in six early newborn puppies and in 10 late newborn puppies. In series 3, the hemodynamic effects of phentolamine in the presence of VIP receptor binding inhibitor were studied. In early newborn puppies, VIP had essentially no effect on heart rate or blood pressure until phentolamine was given; then, blood pressure decreased by 17% (p less than 0.005). In late newborn puppies, VIP resulted in an increase in heart rate in the control state but not after parasympathetic or sympathetic denervation. In early newborn puppies, phentolamine alone resulted in a 24% decrease (p less than 0.005) in blood pressure, compared with a 54% decrease (p less than 0.005) in early newborn puppies preexposed to VIP infusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Application of (+/-)-FRC8653 (less than 1 microM) increased the amplitude of the inward current when depolarization pulses more negative than -10 mV were applied but inhibited it when depolarization was more positive than 0 mV (in each case from a holding potential of -80 mV). At a holding potential of -40 mV, (+/-)-FRC8653 (greater than 0.1 nM) consistently inhibited the inward current. (-)-FRC8653 (greater than 1 nM) inhibited the amplitude of the inward current evoked by a depolarizing pulse more positive than -10 mV (the holding potential being -80 mV). At the holding potential of -80 mV, but not at -40 mV, (+)-FRC8653 (1 microM) enhanced the current amplitude evoked by a depolarizing pulse more negative than -10 mV but inhibited the current evoked by a pulse more positive than 0 mV. (+/-)-FRC8653 shifted the voltage-dependent inhibition curves to the left, and the slope of the curve became steeper (test pulse of +10 mV). Two types of single Ca2+ channel currents (12 and 23 pS) were recorded from the basilar artery by the cell-attached patch-clamp method. Opening of the 12-pS channel occurred with a depolarizing pulse (-20 mV) from a holding potential of -80 mV, but not from one of -60 mV.

In the remaining 16 cases in which slippage exceeded 40 degrees, osteoarthrosis was present in 15, even though correction was adequate. From these observations it can be concluded that intertrochanteric corrective osteotomy does not prevent degeneration in cases with the most severe slip. On the basis of the present observations on treated and untreated cases, the authors advocate treatment by fixation without realignment, accepting the deformity in moderate and severe chronic slips. Rotational osteotomy may be considered in the event of hip joint contracture.\r"

Patients with high bone turnover and decreased femoral thickness and density before surgery were at risk of developing calcar resorption and cancellous diaphyses, conditions that weaken proximal stem support and lead to early failure. These findings suggest that noncemented stems may be indicated in this group. Another group, osteoporotic patients, suffered from osteoblastic insufficiency, which may be the indication for the use of cemented stems rather than noncemented stems, which require bony ingrowth.\r"

Twenty (3.8%) reoperations were performed because of technical complications or nonunion. The Singh index revealed more unstable fractures and technical complications in hips with Grades 1-3 than in hips with Grades 4-6. Reoperation was more frequent if the screw tip was within 8 mm from the subchondral line in the superolateral quadrant or in the anteroproximal quadrant than if the screw ended farther from the subchondral line. Fifty-five (10.8%) of the lag screws migrated 2 mm or more. Postoperatively, the neck-shaft angle decreased more in unstable fractures than in stable fractures. The decrease in neck-shaft angle was less when the proximal fragment impinged medially on the shaft fragment. Unstable fractures with this type of reduction also impacted less than hips with anatomic reduction or medial reduction of the shaft fragment. Weight bearing did not significantly influence the degree of impaction.\r"

The ten knees showed no significant change in stability after knee replacement when the joint line was maintained in its natural position. When the femoral component was repositioned 5 mm proximally and 5 mm anteriorly, a significant increase in laxity occurred during midflexion. When the joint line was shifted 5 mm distal and 5 mm posterior to its anatomic location, significant tightening occurred in midrange of motion. Coupled rotation of the tibia with knee flexion was decreased after surgery in all knees with no specific relationship to joint line position. Coupled rotation with varus-valgus testing, however, remained within the normal range through the first 30 degrees of flexion only when the joint line was restored to its normal anatomic position. Stability in condylar knee arthroplasty is in part dependent on position of the joint line. Surgical techniques that rely on restoring the flexion and extension gap without regard to joint line position may result in alteration of varus-valgus or anterior-posterior displacement in midrange flexion.\r"

Forty anatomic specimen tibiae were stress tested on a servohydraulic mechanical test machine to evaluate the effects of screws and a sleeve on initial fixation of the uncemented total knee tibial component. Twenty specimens were used for posteroanterior shear loading and 20 for anterolateral axial compressive loading. Four cancellous screws were inserted through holes of the tibial tray to pierce the cortex of the proximal tibia. The methylmethacrylate sleeve was applied to the central stem. Rigidity of fixation was significantly improved by the combination of screws and a sleeve. Bone strength was also an important factor affecting the quality of fixation.\r"

A conventional design that employed a single posteriorly angled peg was compared with a new design that was held in place by cancellous bone screws. The components were implanted into the medial condyles of 12 preserved human tibiae, and a cyclic load was first applied anteromedially and then posteromedially. The screwed implants failed at significantly higher loads (1634.8 +/- 121.6 N, mean +/- standard error of the mean) than the pegged implants (1103.3 +/- 152.0 N). On application of a 19.6-N preload, the screwed implants moved significantly less than the pegged implants. Although the differences in micromotion and subsidence were not always significant, there were definite trends. The screwed implants had much lower levels of temporary and permanent displacement compared with the pegged implants for all load levels from the initial load of 245.2 N up to and including the failure load. When the motion that resulted from moving the load from the anterior position to the posterior position was examined, the screwed implant's average total motion was less than 10 microns compared with almost 135 microns for the pegged implant after the 245.2-N load cycle. For the cycle before failure, the screwed implant's average motion increased to less than 29 microns, whereas the pegged implant's average total motion was almost 354 microns. From this information it appears clear that screws provide better initial fixation stability than angled pegs for uncemented unicondylar tibial components.\r"

(2) Controversy regarding this ligament continues despite the increased amount of information available. Much of the recent ACL literature, although regarded as newly discovered, has its roots in far older, and apparently forgotten or overlooked, work. Examples include: (1) ACL intactness is best tested at full extension; (2) hemarthrosis and ACL rupture are closely associated; and (3) ACL rupture sometimes masquerades as a minor injury. Additionally, early investigators achieved notable advances in surgical techniques. These contributions disappeared from the literature for two major reasons. First, early investigators observed few patients, with typical practitioners rarely seeing ACL injuries, and consequently, little data existed to support their observations. Second, observations could not be confirmed until the advent of widespread, successful surgery. Undoubtedly, orthopedists now know much more about the ACL, yet many issues remain controversial. Does the ACL perform a vital function? What is the efficacy of operative versus nonoperative treatment? What are the relative merits of direct repair, intraarticular substitutes, and extraarticular nonanatomic procedures? The origins and continued existence of controversy stem from several sources, including the less than rigorous study design and the scarcity of natural history, long-term follow-up studies, and basic science studies. The perception of the ACL as a simple structural unit has also perpetuated this controversy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Forty-three displaced tibial plateau fractures were treated with open reduction and internal fixation. The fractures were classified into four groups, and the clinical results were evaluated using a standard 100-point knee rating system. The average follow-up period after surgery was 2.7 years. Overall there were 35 excellent, five good, three fair, and no poor results. In five of eight knees with a less than excellent score, the results were due to the technique of fracture fixation or the absence of a bone graft. There were ten postoperative complications, but only one ultimately affected the clinical result. Fourteen patients required removal of implants. Roentgenographic analysis showed that six knees had mild degenerative changes, two had moderate, and two had severe degenerative changes. There was no statistically significant association between the fracture type and a less than excellent result. The absence of bone grafting, however, was associated with a less than excellent result. Bicondylar fractures had a mean range of motion of 110 degrees, 18 degrees less than that of all other types of fracture combined.\r"

Of the original 81 patients, 38 patients were located, seven patients had died from unrelated causes, and 36 were unlocatable. Of the 38 patients located, 37 patients (representing 38 fractures) participated in a detailed clinical review and had a roentgenographic assessment. All fractures had remained united, and normal bone remodeling had occurred. There were no adverse effects of the generator or cathode wire. Six patients initially reported as failures had healed after further surgical intervention. Thus, normal osteogenesis occurs in association with electrical stimulation using an implantable bone growth stimulator. This ten-year review supports the long-term safety and effectiveness of this technique in treating nonuniting fractures.\r"

In monolayer cultures, the adherent periosteal cells showed fibroblastlike morphology and overtly expressed neither osteogenic nor chondrogenic phenotypes. Cultured cells inoculated heterotopically into nude mice eventually gave rise to bone tissue at the subcutaneous injection site. The process of bone formation occurred through two different mechanisms: intramembranous bone formation at the peripheral portion of the inoculum early and endochondral bone formation in the central portion later. Frozen, preserved periosteal cells also formed bone after introduction into nude mice in the same temporal histologic sequence as the unfrozen cells. Cultured chick muscle fibroblasts from donors that were the same age as controls did not form bone or cartilage when inoculated under identical conditions to those of cultured periosteal cells. These results suggest that periosteum of young chicks contains subsets of progenitor cells that possess the potential to differentiate directly into osteoblasts or chondrocytes when inoculated in vivo. Importantly, this potential is retained after enzymatic isolation, cell culture, subculturing, and freeze preservation.\r"

However, in children with arthritis it is important to distinguish among those with rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, or hypogammaglobulinemia. Rheumatoid factor is specific for adult-type rheumatoid arthritis; the presence of antinuclear antibodies increases the likelihood that the child may develop uveitis; and hypogammaglobulinemia may be associated with complicating infections. Other unusual antibodies, autoantibodies, antigen-antibody complexes, and complement activation products are found in children with arthritis, but none of these define a diagnostic or consistent group of diseases. Similarly, changes in the numbers of immunologically active cells and regulating mechanisms occur but not in specific patterns. As yet, none of the known immunologic abnormalities explain the pathogenesis of these diseases and only a few appear disease specific.\r"

Immunostaining showed that a majority of osteosarcomas and all of the chondrosarcoma cells contained a large quantity of BMP. Conversely, none of the fibrosarcomas showed positive staining. Thus, it was possible to differentiate osteosarcomas from fibrosarcomas by immunostaining. In fibrous dysplasia of bone, BMP was abundant in the fibrocellular tissue that had osteogenic activity. In contrast, fibrous tissue of ossifying fibroma showed weak positive staining; only the osteoblasts rimming the bone showed a positive reaction. Immunostaining showed that BMP was also detected in other neoplastic bone diseases such as osteoma, chondroma, and other tumors.\r"

  ".W": "Bone morphogenetic protein is labile and easily inactivated by many extracorporeal factors. It is crucial to establish whether delay in retrieval of donor bone and ambient holding temperature of the donor body influence osteoinductivity of bone left in situ. Of ten adult rats that were killed, five were kept at 4 degrees and five at room temperature. Femurs were harvested at 24, 36, 48, 72, and 168 hours. After processing, segments were implanted in 20 four-week-old syngeneic rats for 14 days. The level of osteoinduction was evaluated histologically. It was excellent in the 4 degrees group in the 24-, 36-, and 48-hour specimens but less advanced at 72 hours. Bone taken from the room temperature group showed findings identical to those kept at 4 degrees through 36 hours, but osteoinduction was less advanced at 48 hours and absent at 72 hours. No bone formed at 168 hours in either temperature group. The following observations were made. (1) Osteoinductivity of demineralized bone left in situ after death was unexpectedly stable. (2) Retrieval time was extended by donor cooling. (3) Microperforated demineralized bone actively induced new bone formation. (4) Ethylene oxide does not inhibit osteoinduction when correctly applied for sterilization. If confirmed in humans, retrieval of bone to be used for osteoinduction could be delayed for some hours, particularly if the donor was immediately refrigerated. This would increase the effective number of bone tissue donors and utilize an undeveloped resource.\r"

Antiserum against nude mouse spleen cells was added to the early passage cultures to eliminate the host fibroblastic cells. The cell line retained a high activity of liver/bone/kidney-type alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and secreted osteocalcin, i.e., bone gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-containing protein (BGP), into the medium. The addition of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) increased the ALP activity as well as the level of BGP secreted into the medium. The ALP of 1,25(OH)2D3-treated cells has the same inhibition characteristics to heat and amino acids as that of untreated cells. Synthetic human parathyroid hormone stimulated the production of intracellular adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) approximately 100-fold within five minutes. However, the stimulation was not observed with a synthetic human thyrocalcitonin. When HuO9 cells were transplanted into the back of a nude mouse, a tumor with an abundant osteoid formation and mineralization was produced. The results indicate that the HuO9 cell line expresses well-differentiated osteoblastic phenotypes. HuO9 is the first established human cell line to produce BGP, and it provides a useful model for the studies of osteoblasts and the regulatory mechanisms of BGP production.\r"

In comparing cases of hyperadrenocorticism with age- and breed-matched controls with hypothyroidism, the incidence was significantly greater than expected. This was not seen, however, in beagle dogs in which the incidence was already high and attributed to chondrodystrophoid tendencies in this breed. To investigate the pathogenesis of this association and its possible relationship to steroid-induced osteopenia, adult dogs were given a placebo, prednisone, or prednisone plus calcium for six months. Torque testing of intervertebral joints revealed a consistent trend of lower force to failure in both prednisone-treated groups, but the difference was not statistically significant. In these dogs with mild to moderate hyperadrenocorticism, compression tests of intact vertebral bodies were not significantly different, but blocks of trabecular bone cut from the vertebral bodies failed at significantly lower compressive forces in both prednisone-treated groups compared with controls. Histomorphometric evaluation of lumbar vertebral trabecular bone revealed that the percentage of bone volume was not significantly decreased in the prednisone-treated groups. Nor was there any difference in the thickness or porosity of vertebral end-plates, which might contribute to weakening of intervertebral ligamentous insertions.\r"

Strength and stiffness were equivalent statistically for the intact physis and the fractured physis fixed with two pins. Single pinning was only 83% as strong and 78% as stiff as the intact physeal plate. Double-pin fixation is recommended over single-pin fixation for acute SCFE.

The resulting motions between bone segments at the metaphyseal and diaphyseal levels were estimated using measured fixator stiffnesses, postural muscle activity, ground reaction forces, and calculated internal and external loads. Relative displacements of bone segments of up to 2.8 degrees were estimated in postural activities; displacements were up to 4.9 times larger at the metaphyseal than at the diaphyseal osteotomy level. The results suggest that due to these increased motions, mechanically inferior conditions for healing at the metaphyseal-lengthening osteotomy level may counteract any supposedly superior biologic healing potential that the metaphyseal region of the bone may have compared with the diaphyseal region. These results correlate well with the clinical findings of the earlier animal study.\r"

A classification of chronic osteomyelitis is as follows: (1) hematogenous osteomyelitis; (2) osteomyelitis in united fractures (fracture with union); (3) osteomyelitis in nonunion (fracture with nonunion); and (4) postoperative or posttraumatic osteomyelitis in which bone was not fractured. For management of the scarring of surrounding soft tissue, there has been a change to excision of the scarred tissue and reliance on muscle flap, free-tissue transfer, or closure of soft tissues without irrigation with antibiotic solution. In recent years, free microvascular osseous grafts have permitted more aggressive resection of the involved osseous tissue. The predominance of gram-negative organisms and penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and the occurrence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus continue.\r"

At the University of Padua, he studied and later taught human anatomy by performing dissections. His discoveries were published in 1543 in his monumental De Humani Corporis Fabrica. Controversy led to his resignation from the University of Padua. His magnum opus was interpreted as a challenge to both academia and the church. He went to Spain, where he served as personal physician to Emperor Charles V. After almost 20 years in Spain, he became involved in an unfortunate incident that incurred the condemnation of the Inquisition. The royal court's intervention saved Vesalius from being burned at the stake, however, and he was ordered to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem to atone for his error. On the return voyage, he became ill and died on the Greek island of Zante.\r"

  ".W": "Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) involves a wide range of joint tissues. Tissue changes include proliferation of synovial cells, alterations in synovial fluid, and degradation of articular cartilage. Synovial cell proliferation results in increased numbers of fibroblasts and lymphocytes. Changes in the synovial fluid include increased content of antibodies, altered complement ratios, increased levels of factors stimulating cartilage-mediated proteoglycan degradation, and decreased levels of insulinlike growth factor I. Levels of cytokine such as interleukin-1 and interleukin-2 vary with cell culture and assay technique. Cartilage degradation is apparent from increased quantities of proteoglycan and glycosaminoglycan in serum and synovial fluid. Type II collagen peptide antibodies are also prevalent in JRA patients. Cartilage degradation appears linked to factors in JRA synovial fluid. Conditioned medium of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with JRA also stimulates increased release of cartilage proteoglycan. Thus, the outcome in JRA likely reflects activities of interacting soluble factors that directly influence cartilage homeostasis.\r"

Because of ethical concerns about studying children, the difficulty of obtaining tissue, and the heterogeneous manifestations and protean course of chronic arthritis in childhood, the scope of potential research has been severely limited. This brief review summarizes a few of the animal models most commonly used in chronic inflammatory arthritis research: subcutaneous air pouch, antigen-induced (including arthritogenic infectious agent), and spontaneous models. In the spontaneous and antigen-induced animal models of arthritis, local and systemic immunoregulatory abnormalities clearly play a major role in the pathogenesis of arthritis. By elucidating the immune response to those antigens, as well as the role of genetics and environment, the pathogenesis of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis may be better understood. At the present time, however, the complexity of these models precludes more definitive interpretation and extrapolation to human diseases.\r"

Multiple new nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are available in the United States, although only a few are approved for use in children, and none have been proven to be significantly better than aspirin in suppressing inflammation. The average time before significant improvement is noticed is over 30 days in the 50% of the children who respond to any NSAID within three months. The percentage of responders progressively increases with the length of therapy, so treatment should be continued until one is reasonably certain that improvement will not occur before changing medication. In the more severely involved child, gold and other disease-modifying medications are used. However, it has been difficult to prove the value of these medications in controlled studies because of the high rate of significant improvement in the control group treated with NSAIDs. In preliminary studies, methotrexate appears to have significant benefit in children who have failed other treatments. Other newer therapies, such as intravenous gammaglobulin, have only been used in a small number of patients and have not as yet been proven beneficial.\r"

Five hundred twenty-eight synovectomies and tenosynovectomies were performed over a period of 13 years. The patients were followed for one, two, three, five, and ten years postoperatively. The evaluation after three years was chosen as the basis for this article. One hundred twenty-five children with arthritis who were not evaluated three years postoperatively had less severe arthritis, both locally and generally, than the evaluated group of 389. The rate for good results and tolerability was high at one, two, and three years postoperatively but decreased with time; more patients went from good results to poor rather than vice versa. Global assessment, soft-tissue swelling, and limitation of movement seemed to be the best parameters for evaluating the results of synovectomies. It appears necessary to wait at least three years to evaluate the long-term effect of synovectomies.\r"

  ".W": "Total hip or knee arthroplasty is indicated in patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis when there is marked functional impairment and/or severe disabling pain from advanced structural hip or knee joint involvement. Relief of pain and dramatic improvement in function can be achieved in most patients. When both the hip and knee are involved, hip arthroplasty should probably be done first. Regional anesthesia is preferable. Careful preoperative planning is essential because custom prostheses are often required. Small bone size, osteoporosis, and soft-tissue contractures make the surgery technically demanding. Skeletal immaturity is not an absolute contraindication to surgery. Component loosening is the most frequent late complication in hip arthroplasty. It is less common in condylar metal-to-plastic knee arthroplasty in which patellar complications predominate. Cementless arthroplasty has an evolving role in the patient with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and, to date, is more often used in the hip than in the knee.\r"

The follow-up period was from six months to seven years and three months (average, three years and five months). Two patients died six and ten months postoperatively because of brain metastases (astrocytoma) and lung metastases (neuroblastoma), respectively. Good alignment with no instability of the cervical or thoracic spine was obtained for all patients, including the two who died. Laminoplasty combined with posterolateral fusion was found to be very effective in preventing the development of spinal deformities after spinal canal surgery for spinal cord tumors or other diseases in children and adolescents.\r"

The authors assess 52 infants less than eight weeks old with a rectal temperature of 38.1 degrees C or higher as having either a readily identifiable focus of infection by physical examination, appearing \"toxic\" without a focus, or appearing well. The authors screened patients by using white blood cell (WBC) counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and chest radiographs in addition to blood, cerebrospinal fluid and urine cultures. The authors found a 9.6% incidence of bacteria in the 52 infants evaluated, with a 4.3% incidence in those febrile infants who appeared well. Five patients had positive blood cultures with Group B B Hemolytic streptococcus (four patients), and Viridans streptococcus (one patient). A clinical assessment of toxicity and a total band count greater than or equal to 0.5 x 10(3) cells/uL together were sensitive indicators of bacteremia, as were toxicity and a positive CRP. A \"toxic\" appearance, a WBC count greater than or equal to 15 x 10(3) cells/uL and an ESR greater than 30 were specific indicators of bacteria. Based on these data, identification of bacteremia in febrile infants may be possible with clinical assessment and screening laboratory tests. Because of the relatively small sampling size of this study, the authors feel that evaluation of a larger number of patients is warranted to evaluate these sensitivities in a more diffuse patient population.\r"

Superficial cultures were positive for pathogens (any streptococcus or enteric gram-negative) in 15% (10/66) of cases. Antimicrobial decision making was affected in only one of these cases, and in a seemingly inappropriate manner. In summary, there was no evidence or review that superficial cultures used in sepsis evaluation influenced physician antimicrobial decision making; in one case they may have led to unnecessary antibiotic exposure.\r"

In an attempt to confirm the diagnosis of a peroxisomal disorder, plasma levels of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) and phytanic acid were determined. In addition, fibroblasts profile of VLCFA and plasmalogen levels were evaluated for Case 2. Pathomorphological examinations represented by lymph node and kidney biopsies as well as postmortem examinations of liver, adrenals and brain were performed in Case 1. The phenotypes of both siblings showed marked resemblance to those observed in children with Zellweger syndrome. The results of biochemical tests performed in Case 1, together with abundant peroxisomes in the liver and the wide spectrum of clinical abnormalities suggest pseudo-Zellweger or Zellweger-like syndromes, but no conclusive data have been found. The plasmalogen level in fibroblasts as well as the fibroblasts profile of VLCFA noted in Case 2 were within the normal range, thus excluding the possibility of a peroxisomal disorder. The striking phenotype resemblance of the siblings mimicking Zellweger, together with discordant biochemical findings, are difficult to explain on the basis of currently available tests.\r"

The type and amount of thyroid hormone replacement, selection of laboratory tests, and timing of office visits are all important for optimizing patient well-being and reducing the costs of medical care. The aim of treatment is to bring the patient to the euthyroid state. Currently this is defined as a normal serum concentration of TSH by recently developed sensitive and specific immunometric assays, and is accomplished by titrating the dose of levothyroxine and changing it not more often than at 4- to 6-week intervals. As an indicator of euthyroidism, the sensitive TSH assay has advantages over tests of serum T4, FT4I, T3, FT4, and TSH by RIA because it is independent of TBG changes that result from pregnancy, birth-control pills, and estrogen replacement, is not spuriously elevated by the levothyroxine treatment itself, and is the only test that detects both subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism. Additional serum tests are not usually necessary but have advantages under special circumstances. Once the optimal replacement dose is determined, monitoring can be done yearly or even bi-yearly, depending on the adequacy of patient education and patient compliance.\r"

In the GPMT, both dithranol and, to a greater extent, butantrone showed sensitizing potential. Because butantrone was less irritant, the concentrations used were 10x higher than those of dithranol. In the CPT, only butantrone was slightly positive. In the MEST, with both CF-1 and Balb/c mice, dithranol caused less swelling of the test ear after challenge than butantrone. According to the evaluation criteria of the MEST, only butantrone caused sensitization in 50% of the CF-1 mice and in 40% of the Balb/c mice. Thus, the GPMT was the only test which indicated the minor contact sensitizing potential of dithranol. On the other hand, the 10-butyryl analogue of dithranol showed undoubtedly stronger contact sensitizing potential than the parent compound in all tests. Therefore, as compared to dithranol, an increased risk of sensitization should be considered.\r"

A total of 54 positive reactions were found, 23 of which were clinically relevant, triethanolamine being the most frequent sensitizer. Patients with emulsifier sensitivity generally give a high prevalence of positive patch tests to other common ingredients of topical preparations, such as preservatives or active ingredients. Cosmetics and topical medicaments were detected as the source of sensitization in an equal number of patients. Patch tests with patients' own causative preparations were frequently negative. To avoid overlooking emulsifier sensitivity, it is advisable to test these compounds in patients with contact dermatitis that is possibly due to topical preparations, regardless of whether they have other clinically relevant positive reactions or whether patch tests with their own products are negative.\r"

Using 3 different guinea pig strains, development was attempted of an experimental guinea pig model that would allow for in-depth studies into the mechanism of sensitization, and a possible role of transdermal device components. Transient low-level clonidine allergy could be obtained only in a minority of animals, with severe sensitization procedures departing from epicutaneous applications, combined with intradermal (adjuvant) FCA injections. Sensitization was not potentiated by additional booster procedures, including cyclophosphamide pretreatment, nor any of the putative cofactors (UV-treatments, C. parvum or acetaldehyde involvement) studied. These results suggest that the persistent skin contacts in man, with transdermal devices for sustained drug delivery, generate unique conditions favouring the development of allergic contact dermatitis, which are difficult to mimic in experimental animal models. Thus, clinical allergy may develop even to extremely weak sensitizing drugs that can be safely used orally, and escape most currently available predictive contact allergy animal models. Clinical studies remain unavoidable for studying factors that may reduce sensitization rates to more acceptable levels.\r"

The notation (meth)acrylates is used to refer to both acrylates and methacrylates. (Meth)acrylate monomers will polymerize in the absence of oxygen when induced by metal ions, peroxides, heat or ultraviolet light. The monomers are of low viscosity and remain in the liquid state at temperatures far below 0 degree C. The volatile compounds, some of which exhibit a most pungent odour, have a tendency to penetrate all tissue and to permeate into the finest fissures, a property which makes them suitable as sealants, glues, embedding material, etc. This and their toxicity may represent a danger to the health of individuals who need to work with them, especially if no precautions are taken. We show with patch testing that one patient reacted strongly to the compound 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate at the dilutions tested (0.5 and 1% v/v), but not at all to 10 other (meth)acrylates. In the same test, 3 volunteer controls were negative to 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate. We demonstrate that at maximum working concentration, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate penetrates both latex and vinyl gloves and elicits irritant/allergic reactions on the patient and irritant reactions on a control. Finally, we discuss the necessary protective measures.\r"

Measurements obtained during the first hours of hospitalization revealed a group of six patients (group 1) with markedly depressed left ventricular function, as evidenced by a low cardiac index (CI) (2.2 +/- 0.8 L/min.m2), reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (21 +/- 8%), and an increased arterial-venous oxygen content difference. Right ventricular systolic function was also severely depressed. These patients were characterized as having sepsis-related cardiogenic shock secondary to profound myocardial depression, which was reversible within 24 to 48 h with inotropic support. The 15 remaining patients (group 2) exhibited an initially increased CI (4.9 +/- 1.8 L/min.m2), with a low systemic vascular resistance. In group 2, LVEF remained within the normal range despite abnormally low peripheral vascular resistance. This finding would suggest the presence of slight to moderate depression of left ventricular systolic function. All patients in this series had a normal left ventricular end-diastolic volume, whether profound myocardial depression was present or not.\r"

Sixty percent of the measured MAP in both groups was within the desired +/- 10% during the first 10 min. Thereafter until the end of observation, the MAP was maintained within +/- 10% of the desired set-point 90% of the time in group 1 vs. 60% of the time in group 2. One percent and 11% of data points were +/- 20% from the set-point in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p less than .05, chi-square test).

To test pulse oximeter reliability in children under these conditions, our study compared 187 SaO2 pulse oximeter readings (Biox 3700) with simultaneous hemoximeter (OSM2, Radiometer) readings from 56 children rewarming after open heart surgery. Ages ranged from 4 months to 18 yr; temperatures ranged from 23.5 degrees to 38 degrees C (toe) and 31.3 degrees to 40.8 degrees C (core). The mean pulse oximeter SaO2 reading was 94.90% (SD 7.18, range 54% to 100%), mean hemoximeter reading was 96.07% (SD 7.06; minimum 54%; maximum 100%). The correlation between the readings was high (r = .88, p less than .005), and was not affected by low core temperature. When oximeter and cardiac monitor pulse rates coincided, the oximeter SaO2 value was within +/- 5% (p less than .05). We conclude that the Biox 3700 oximeter is reliable for noninvasive SaO2 monitoring in mild to moderately hypothermic children after open heart surgery, particularly when oximeter and cardiac heart rates coincide. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings in children with core temperatures less than 31.3 degrees C, and when other oximeters are used.\r"

The NVM is a noninvasive device that measures VT by hot wire anemometry. The quotient of VT and the inflation pressure amplitude from the mechanical ventilator provided a measure of respiratory compliance. This was validated against the single breath occlusion technique in 15 infants (birth weight 0.9 to 4.4 kg). To ensure fully passive expiration, only paralyzed or sedated patients were studied. Only 12 of the 15 infants were analyzed because of limitations in the single breath technique. In three infants the flow-volume curves obtained were alinear, indicating inhomogeneity. In the 12 infants with acceptable single breath data, agreement between the two methods was excellent. Using the expired volume, r2 was .99. We conclude that the NVM can be used to obtain valid estimates of respiratory compliance on-line in intubated infants.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the infectious risk of different methods of managing vascular catheters during long-term use. Consecutive surgical ICU patients requiring triple lumen catheters, pulmonary artery catheters, or arterial catheters for greater than 7 days were prospectively randomized to one of three management groups: a) percutaneous (PERC) puncture with every 7-day catheter change at a new site, b) no weekly change (NWC) with a new site when changed, or c) guidewire exchange (GWX) with every 7-day catheter change at the same site. In all groups, a catheter change was mandatory for a positive blood culture, skin site infection, or sepsis without a likely source. Cultures were obtained when clinically indicated and at the time of every catheter change. Catheter-related sepsis (CRS) was defined as a positive blood culture and catheter culture with the same organism. A total of 112 patients met evaluation criteria. There were no intergroup differences in age, primary diagnosis, severity of injury or illness, number of study days, number of protocol violations, route of catheterization, number of catheters present/patient day, catheter sepsis rate, or bacteremia rate. The NWC group demonstrated an increased number of days/catheter, fewer catheter/subcutaneous tract segment cultures/patient, and a reduced incidence of catheter tip colonization. These results occurred in a setting where the number of CRS episodes/patient was 0.17 for GWX, 0.22 for PERC, and 0.16 for NWC. We conclude that there is no difference in infectious risk between these three methods of long-term catheter management. The method with the least complications and expense should be used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Respiratory system resistance (Rrs,max) was partitioned into its homogeneous (Rrs,min) and uneven (Rrs,u) components. Respiratory system elastance (Ers) was also measured. In both groups Ers did not vary with different inspiratory flows and volumes, but was significantly higher in ARDS. With increasing volume (isoflow maneuvers), Rrs,max and Rrs,u increased but Rrs,min remained unaltered in ARDS. In control patients, however, resistances did not vary but Rrs,max and Rrs,u were smaller and Rrs,min equaled their corresponding values in ARDS. Hence, stress relaxation seems to be increased in ARDS. During isovolume maneuvers Rrs,max and Rrs,u decreased with increasing flows (both groups), although they were significantly higher in ARDS. Rrs,min was not modified by different flows and was similar in both groups. Thus, pendelluft is also increased in ARDS. In conclusion, the mechanical profile of ARDS is characterized by increased Ers and Rrs,max, the latter being secondary to augmented mechanical unevenness within the system.\r"

Recent studies in septic shock indicate that improving oxygen delivery (DO2) by increasing blood flow will increase VO2. We prospectively examined the effect on VO2 of improving DO2 by increasing oxygen content (CO2) with blood transfusion in eight hemodynamically stable septic shock patients. Transfusion consisted of 8 to 10 ml/kg of packed RBC over 1 to 2 h. Hemodynamic and oxygen transport measurements were obtained before and after blood transfusion. Transfusion significantly (p less than .05) increased Hgb and Hct from 10.2 +/- 0.8 g/dl and 30 +/- 2% to 13.2 +/- 1.4 g/dl and 39 +/- 4%, respectively (mean +/- SD). DO2 significantly (p less than .05) increased after transfusion (599 +/- 65 to 818 +/- 189 ml/min.m2), but VO2 did not change (166 +/- 68 to 176 +/- 74 ml/min.m2; NS). In pediatric septic shock patients, increasing CO2 by blood transfusion may not increase VO2.\r"

Since the occurrence of bleeding after ICU admission may be associated with increased morbidity and mortality, many efforts have been directed at defining optimal therapy for stress ulcer prophylaxis. Titration of intragastric pH with antacids or iv doses of H2-receptor antagonists may prevent stress ulcer bleeding in high-risk ICU patients. We evaluated a recently developed pH probe incorporated into an NG tube and compared it with aspiration of gastric contents using pH paper as a means to monitor pH in 22 surgical ICU patients. Regression analysis comparing the intragastric probe pH values with the aspirated pH values showed a good correlation between the two methods (r = .71). This new technique for intragastric pH measurement appears technically simple and clinically applicable for use on patients at risk for stress ulcer bleeding. It may be more accurate than pH paper in patients receiving antacids.\r"

The thoracic and abdominal gauges were calibrated simultaneously in quasi-static and dynamic conditions. The delta FRC measured during HFJV (1 to 5 Hz) and the VT measured during IPPV (0.25 Hz) were found to be equivalent by the two gauges in most patients (r = .90 and r = .99, respectively), but no correlation was found between the VT values inferred by each gauge in HFJV (r = .54). During HFJV, spectral analysis of the gauge signals showed important damping of the abdominal motion (AB) and an amplification of the thoracic displacements (RC) in four patients when measurements were taken at greater than 3 Hz. We conclude that, provided the partition of the volume between AB and RC remains constant, indirect spirometry may measure VT in IPPV and delta FRC in HFJV, but it fails to measure VT accurately during HFJV.\r"

In the present study, we used dobutamine to increase cardiac index (CI) and oxygen delivery (DO2) in 18 patients after open heart surgery. Using increasing doses of dobutamine up to 10 micrograms/kg.min-1, we observed statistically significant (p less than .01) increases in mean CI (2.50 +/- 0.10 to 3.56 +/- 0.18 L/min.m2) and in mean heart rate (HR) (83 +/- 3 to 105 +/- 3 beat/min). Mean systemic vascular resistance index decreased significantly (p less than .01) in all patients (2271 +/- 101 to 1648 +/- 83 dyne.sec/cm5.m2). Pulmonary vascular resistance index did not change in the ten coronary artery bypass graft patients, but decreased significantly (p less than .01) in the eight valve replacement patients (561 +/- 98 to 421 +/- 79 dyne.sec/cm5.m2). Mean DO2 increased in all patients, although there was no concomitant increase in oxygen consumption (VO2) in four patients. We observed a significant (p less than .01) increase in mean VO2 in the remaining 14 patients (110 +/- 6 to 148 +/- 12 ml/min.m2), in spite of significant decreases in PaO2 and increases in right-to-left intrapulmonary shunting. Although increases in HR and ventricular arrhythmias may limit its use, dobutamine increases CI and DO2 in patients after CPB. In the present study, dobutamine's varying metabolic effect exemplifies the need for close monitoring of hemodynamic and metabolic variables when using vasoactive drugs in the postoperative period.\r"

Analysis was performed separately for all patients (group A) and for a subsample (group B), obtained by excluding coronary care patients. Calculation of risk and classification of patients were carried out as recommended in the literature for MPM, APACHE II, and SAPS. In group A, sensitivities (correct prediction of hospital mortality) were 44.7%, 51.1%, and 21.2% and specificities (correct prediction of survival) were 84.5%, 85.4%, and 96.8%, respectively; overall correct classification rates were 73.3%, 75.8%, and 75.6%. In group B, sensitivities were slightly higher, but total correct classification rates did not reach group A levels. Goodness-of-fit testing showed low levels of fit for all methods in both groups. Application of APACHE II to diagnostic subgroups, using disease-adapted risk calculations, revealed marked inconsistencies between the estimated risk and the observed mortality. We conclude that the estimation of risk on admission by the three methods investigated might be helpful for global comparisons of ICU populations, although the lack of disease specificity reduces their applicability for severity grading of a given illness. The inaccuracy of these methods makes them ineffective for predicting individual outcome; thus, they provide little advantage in clinical decision-making.\r"

RAPS is a truncated version of the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score that uses definitions and weighting consistent with APACHE II, but is modified to provide a consistent score just before transport, just after transport, and to use the most deranged (worst) physiologic values during the initial 4 h after arrival at the receiving hospital. During an 8-month period, 1,927 patients transported by six helicopter emergency medical service programs were studied. Over 97% (1,881) of the patients had RAPS obtained before and after transport to the receiving hospital and 92.6% (1,785) had APACHE II scoring completed after hospital admission. Receiver operating curves demonstrate similar predictive power for RAPS and APACHE II (both based on the most deranged physiologic values during the initial 24 h after admission). Before- and after-transport RAPS were also highly predictive of mortality. RAPS appears to be a reliable and highly predictive measure of patient severity/physiologic stability before and after transport to critical care.\r"

Symptoms of clonidine ingestion were typically mild if the dose ingested was less than 0.01 mg/kg, while bradycardia and hypotension occurred usually with doses of greater than 0.01 mg/kg. Apnea and respiratory depression were common when the dose exceeded 0.02 mg/kg. More effective measures are needed to prevent these potentially serious intoxications.\r"

In the first study, a dose response of PGE1 was tested in six animals that were first embolized with sufficient glass beads to double the pulmonary artery pressure (PAP). This study demonstrated that PGE1 reduced PAP and cardiac output by a preload-mediated mechanism, as evidenced by a reduction in the right ventricular (RV) end-diastolic segment length, at doses of 15 and 30 ng/kg.min. The second study was performed in two groups of animals, the control group (n = 6), and the treated group (n = 6), which were given PGE1 at 15 ng/kg.min after the PAP had been doubled by glass bead embolism. RV preload was kept constant. This study demonstrated that there was no difference in pulmonary vascular resistance between either the treated group or the control group. There were no other significant differences between the two groups. The results of both of these studies suggest that there is little afterload reducing effect of PGE1 in this model and at these dose ranges. Part of the mechanism of PGE1 that improves pulmonary edema and gas exchange may be the reduction of filtration surface area and hydrostatic pressures in the lungs.\r"

Through 2 h of CPB and the following 6 h of critical care, there was no difference between CPB-12 and CPB-16 regarding most cardiopulmonary functional variables. Plasma epinephrine was markedly elevated immediately after initiation of CPB (p less than .01 at 1 min CPB vs. basal) and returned rapidly to basal concentrations. Comparison of plasma epinephrine levels between CPB and standard CPR groups showed that responses to cardiac arrest were similar (p greater than .05 at 1 min CPB vs. 11.5 min CPR). We conclude that cardiac arrest is the main or sole determinant of the plasma epinephrine elevation of resuscitation.\r"

  ".W": "The technique of rapid admixture blood warming of cold erythrocyte units is designed to warm erythrocyte units rapidly (less than 30 sec) while simultaneously providing saline for dilution. However, questions have been raised about the recommended use of a standard 250-ml bolus of 70 degrees C admixture saline, the uniformity and speed of blood unit warming, the difficulties inherent in keeping saline bags at 70 degrees C, and the safety of the methodology. To answer these questions, a series of tests were performed and modifications of the technique were introduced. The mean weight of 1000 successive units of erythrocytes for adult infusion was 305 g (range 220 to 410). The maximum temperature was 44 degrees C, using an internal temperature probe (1-cm temperature gradations; 2-sec recording intervals) when the smallest unit was admixed with a 250 ml 70 degrees C saline bolus; the largest unit had a minimum temperature of 30 degrees C. Plasma Hgb, osmotic fragility, and K of the minimum size erythrocyte unit showed no significant deviation from its control. Both thermographic photographs and the internal temperature recordings of the erythrocyte units demonstrated that solely due to fluid turbulence, uniform mixing occurs within approximately 30 sec of beginning the admixture process. Inverting the blood units caused a thermal layering of fluids and an unacceptable maximum blood temperature of 50 degrees C. There was no difference between the mixing time or efficacy in the presence of standard or large-bore iv tubing or additional in-line filters. Volumes of the 250-ml saline bags for admixture decreased markedly with deviations in electrolyte composition after greater than 2 wk at 70 degrees C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Seven adult mongrel dogs were given a general anesthetic, and monitoring lines were inserted. The animals were then subjected to an incremental volume overload of approximately 13% of estimated initial blood volume at 5-min intervals until a total volume infusion nearly equal to the animal's initial blood volume was reached. Comparison of the various monitoring techniques (e.g., cardiac output, CVP, systemic BP, pulmonary wedge pressure) demonstrated that the peripheral measurement of CORRP had better correlation with known administered volume (r = .96) than any of the other variables. The sensitivity of each of the variables in assessing small amounts of volume overload was also studied. The volume of crystalloid infusion necessary to cause a clinically significant change (defined as greater than 2 SD above the baseline mean) was compared for each of the monitoring variables. CORRP was equivalent to the other variables in sensing early volume overload. In summary, in the anesthetized animal model CORRP appears to be a sensitive, minimally invasive method of assessing volume status in acute volume overload. The efficacy of CORRP in a canine hemorrhagic shock and reperfusion model had previously been demonstrated. This technique could be clinically applicable in situations such as trauma with hemorrhagic shock, intraoperative volume changes, and in the assessment of intravascular volume after resuscitation.\r"

Organ capillary blood flow and the fractional distribution of cardiac output were measured by the microsphere (9-microns diameter) trapping method in dogs. Simultaneously, the arteriolovenous shunt rate was measured by continuous collection of venous blood drained at 4.8 ml.min-1 for 2 min from the brain, kidney, liver, splanchnic organs, skeletal muscle of the pelvic limb, and all of the systemic circulatory organs. The capillary blood flow of the brain, thyroid gland, pancreas, and stomach decreased after circulatory arrest in five nonhemodiluted dogs (group C); arteriolovenous shunt rate was unchanged after circulatory arrest in this group. However, with hemodilution, which was induced either before (pre group, n = 5) or after (post group, n = 5) circulatory arrest, no change occurred in the shunt rate in any of the organs, with the exception of an increase in the systemic arteriolovenous shunt rate in the pre group. Capillary blood flow was maintained at almost the same level as before circulatory arrest in the pre group, but increased significantly in several organs of the post group. The data indicated that hemodilution might be effective for prevention of organ ischemia after cardiac arrest.\r"

This study investigates whether the increased Qbr seen 24 h after inhalation injury can be affected by mechanical ventilation with PEEP (5, 10, 15 cm H2O). Sheep (n = 8) previously prepared with cardiopulmonary catheters and ultrasonic transit time flow probes mounted around their bronchial arteries were insufflated with four sets of 12 breaths each of cotton smoke. Different levels of PEEP were added to the mechanical ventilation 24 h after injury; each PEEP level was applied for 45 min. There were significant increases in Qbr and lung lymph flow (QL) associated with a marked decrease in bronchial vascular resistance (BVR) 24 h after injury. However, no change was observed in mean arterial pressure (MAP) or cardiac index (CI). There was a substantial reduction in PaO2/FIO2 (P/F), which indicated a deterioration in arterial oxygenation. The application of varying levels of PEEP decreased Qbr (p less than .05) while BVR increased (p less than .05), but QL and P/F did not. CI and MAP were recorded. After removal of PEEP, none of the cardiopulmonary variables were significantly different from their postsmoke control values. These findings suggest that mechanical ventilation with PEEP markedly decreases the smoke-induced hyperemia edema frequently seen after inhalation injury without any significant alterations in MAP or CI.\r"

Simultaneously with RHC, transmitral flow velocity profiles were obtained by tpDE, and the ratio of the velocity-time integrals of late diastolic active (A wave) and early diastolic passive inflow into the left ventricle (E wave) was calculated (A/E ratio). Invasively determined pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (WP) ranged from 3 to 36 mm Hg (median 13.35, 5%/95% 6/31 mm Hg). Linear regression analysis showed a highly significant correlation between the A/E ratio and WP (r = .98, p less than .001, standard error of the estimate [SEE] = 0.10). The A/E ratio also correlated with other hemodynamic variables such as cardiac output (r = -.68, p less than .001, SEE = 0.33), cardiac index (r = -.74, p less than .001, SEE = 0.31), and stroke volume index (r = -.68, p less than .001, SEE = 0.34). The interobserver agreement (derived by intraclass correlation analysis between two examiners) on the A/E ratio was high (r = .95, p less than .001, n = 26). We conclude that WP can be accurately determined noninvasively by tpDE. For the assessment of systolic ventricular function, tpDE is of limited diagnostic value.\r"

One of the treatment concepts that has recently attracted clinical attention is the administration of kinins and prostaglandins (PGs). On the basis of experimental data, there is reason to believe that these compounds may have the potential to manipulate favorably certain processes and mechanisms (such as inflammatory or ischemic reactions) thought to be important in the pathophysiology of surgical stress. However, thus far, information on those effects in humans is still scarce. On the other hand, administration of kinins and PGs is technically possible and can be performed safely, even in intensive care patients. Therefore, different techniques, effects, and side-effects of kinin/PG therapy deserve clinical testing.
