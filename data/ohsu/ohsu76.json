  ".W": "Ketononestrol aziridine [(6R,TS)1-(N-aziridinyl)6,7-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)5-nonamone (KNA)], an aziridine derivative of hexestrol, is an estrogenic affinity label for the estrogen receptor (ER). It has an apparent relative binding affinity 8% that of estradiol and shows time-dependent irreversible binding to the ER in uterine cytosol preparations and intact human breast cancer cells (MCF-7). The agonistic activity of KNA is evident in MCF-7 cells in culture, where it increases the cell growth rate and elevates the level of progesterone receptor. KNA was prepared in high specific activity tritium-labeled form by iodination of a methanesulfonate precursor, followed by catalytic tritium-iodine exchange and aziridinylation; the material prepared has high radiochemical purity and a specific activity of 67 Ci/mmol. The covalent attachment of [3H]KNA to the ER can be followed directly by a solvent precipitation assay. In cytosol preparations of uterine ER, labeling with [3H]KNA proceeds in a time-, concentration-, and temperature-dependent manner; labeling is efficient and selective and, by competition studies, was shown to be estrogen specific. ER in intact MCF-7 cells can also be covalently labeled by treatment with [3H]KNA. Receptor covalently labeled with [3H]KNA sediments as a 4S species on high salt sucrose gradients, and its sedimentation position is shifted by treatment with monoclonal antireceptor antibodies. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, the principal labeled species migrates with a mol wt of 66,000. KNA should prove to be a useful probe for studies on receptor structure, function, and chromatin interactions, particularly when the behavior of a receptor-agonist complex is being investigated.\r"

  ".U": "87246436\r", 
  ".W": "The density of T3 nuclear receptors is known to vary with tissues and physiopathological conditions, but the factors involved in their regulation are still unknown. We have previously shown in the anterior pituitary gland that T3 modulates its own receptors; the density of T3 receptors in hypothyroid rats is half that in normal rats, and one injection of T3 is able to restore normal density of T3 receptors within 1-3 h. To determine whether T3 has a direct action on the synthesis of its nuclear receptor, the effect of cycloheximide (Cy) on T3-induced nuclear receptor was studied. In addition, the relationship between the density of pituitary T3 receptors and the secretion of TSH in different thyroid states was examined. In normal rats one injection of Cy (0.5-8 mg/100 mg BW) induced within 3 h a dose-dependent reduction in the density of pituitary T3 receptors as well as an important decrease in plasma TSH, with no changes in T4, T3, or pituitary TSH content. In hypothyroid rats the 50% decrease in the density of pituitary T3 receptors was not further reduced by 1 mg Cy. However, when the same dose of Cy was given 30 min before T3 it completely inhibited the induction by T3 of its receptors. When Cy was given 30 min or 1 h after T3 the inhibition was only partial. An inverse correlation was found between the density of T3 receptors in the pituitary gland and plasma TSH (r = -0.8128) in all experimental groups except those treated with Cy; this drug had an inhibitory effect on both TSH secretion and the density of receptors. The present data, therefore, support the view that T3 in the pituitary gland may induce the synthesis of its own nuclear receptors and that the density of T3 receptors is also involved in the control of TSH secretion.\r"

  ".W": "A complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding rat insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I) has been isolated from a kidney cDNA library. By analogy with the sequence of human and mouse preproIGF-IA this cDNA encodes rat preproIGF-I from amino acid minus 3 to amino acid 105. The predicted protein sequence shows 96% and 99% homology with the human and mouse preproIGF-I, respectively. Under stringent conditions the rat IGF-I cDNA hybridizes with at least three mRNA, messenger RNA species which have apparent sizes of 7, 1.8, and 0.7-1.1 kilobases. All three IGF-I transcripts are detectable in each of the normal rat tissues examined and the relative order of abundance in tissues from intact adult male rats is liver greater than lung greater than kidney greater than thymus greater than spleen greater than heart greater than skeletal muscle (quadriceps femoris) greater than testes greater than brain. The GH dependence of the IGF-I mRNAs was demonstrated by the administration of a single ip injection of human GH (hGH) to hypophysectomized (hypox) rats which resulted in an increase in all three transcripts in each of the tissues examined. The increase in IGF-1 mRNAs was most marked in skeletal and cardiac muscle (9.7- and 9.5-fold compared to hypox controls, respectively) and least marked in the brain. In the liver only a 4-fold increase in IGF-I expression was observed, possibly because of the relatively high level of IGF-I expression in the tissue in the hypox control rats. Each of the IGF-I messenger RNAs appeared to increase in parallel and the time course of IGF-I induction was similar in each tissue with maximal levels of IGF-I transcripts present 6 to 12 h after GH administration. A dose-dependent increase in IGF-I mRNAs was observed in most tissues of hypox rats treated for 10 days with hGH. Significant correlations between growth, as determined by body weight gain and IGF-I expression were observed in liver (r = 0.97), kidney (r = 0.90), quadriceps femoris (r = 0.95), diaphragm (r = 0.92), and thymus (r = 1.0). The IGF-I mRNA levels in tissues from rats that had been treated with the highest dose of hGH (90 microgram/rat X day) were similar to those observed in normal intact rats. This study confirms the highly conserved nature of the IGF-I precursor and provides clear evidence for the GH dependence of IGF-I gene expression in multiple tissues of the rat.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of the inhibitory effect of long term treatment with estradiol on dopamine synthesis in tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic (TIDA) neurons was studied by using hypothalamic slices from ovariectomized rats. Treatment with 2 mg estradiol valerate (EV) at a 3-week interval increased the weight of the anterior pituitary gland and the concentration of serum PRL. In vivo and in vitro dopamine synthesis in TIDA neurons were estimated in EV-treated animals by 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) accumulation in the median eminence after injections of 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD 1015), a DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor, and after incubation of hypothalamic slices with NSD 1015, respectively. In vivo DOPA accumulation in the median eminence was less in EV-treated rats than in control rats. The basal rate of in vitro DOPA accumulation in the median eminence of hypothalamic slices from EV-treated rats was lower than that in control rats. Ca2+-dependent DOPA accumulation in the median eminence, determined by incubation in medium containing depolarization agents such as 50 mM K+ and veratridine, was decreased in EV-treated rats. Furthermore, cAMP-dependent DOPA accumulation, determined by incubation with Bu2cAMP or forskolin, was also suppressed in EV-treated rats. The decreased depolarization-induced DOPA accumulation in the median eminence recovered after cessation of EV treatment. Hyperprolactinemia lasting for 6 weeks, achieved by transplantation of anterior pituitaries under the kidney capsule, increased the rate of depolarization-induced DOPA accumulation in the median eminence. On the other hand, EV treatment was effective in inhibiting depolarization-induced DOPA accumulation in hypophysectomized rats regardless of the presence of anterior pituitary transplants. These results suggest that chronically administered estradiol inhibits dopamine synthesis in TIDA neurons via a direct action on the hypothalamus and overcomes the facilitatory action of PRL on dopamine synthesis; and estradiol inhibits all three distinct systems that regulate basal, Ca2+-dependent, and cAMP-dependent dopamine synthesis in TIDA neurons.\r"

The distribution of OXM and glucagon was determined in the gastrointestinal tract and in the plasma of the rat. Reversed-phase HPLC, associated with RRA or RIA, performed with an N-terminally directed glucagon antiserum (GOL), was used. HPLC of intestinal extracts or plasma separated the GOL immunoreactivity into three peaks: two major peaks coeluting with a preparation of rat glicentin (peak I, partially purified from rat intestine) and porcine or rat OXM, respectively, and a smaller peak coeluting with glucagon. The behavior of the three peaks in the analytical systems matched that of glicentin, OXM, and glucagon, respectively, allowing their identification. The concentrations of OXM picomoles per g of tissue) gradually increased from the duodenum (9 +/- 1) to ileum (93 +/- 4), thereafter decreasing in cecum and colon (22 +/- 3). In the gut, OXM, glucagon, and peak I averaged 40%, 1%, and 59% of the total GLI, respectively. OXM was present in significant amounts in the pancreas (18% of GLI) and stomach (27% of GLI), two tissues in which it accounted, together with glucagon, for almost the totality of GLI. In 24 h-fasted rats, plasma concentrations of OXM, glucagon, and peak I, determined after HPLC with GOL antiserum, were 15.1 pM, 8.6 pM, and 12.3 pM, respectively. Two hours after refeeding, both OXM and peak I were significantly increased (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.02) by a similar factor (2-fold), while glucagon remained unchanged. When the HPLC results were compared with RIA measurement of GLI (GOL antiserum) and glucagon (with a C-terminal glucagon antiserum) in plasma, enteroglucagon (GOL--C-terminal glucagon antiserum immunoreactivities) correlated well with the sum of OXM plus peak I. The combination of HPLC and RRA or RIA allows the unambiguous determination of OXM, glucagon, and glicentin (peak I) in tissues and plasma. In the rat intestine and in the plasma, OXM and glicentin appear roughly in the same ratio and seem to be the major components, if not the totality, of enteroglucagon.\r"

The digestion was performed at 37 C for 24 h under nitrogen at pH 5.0 in the presence of 4 mM dithiothreitol. Under these conditions the release of free [131I] iodoamino acids (MIT, DIT, T4, and T3) was quantitatively very similar to that observed with a standard pronase digestion procedure. To determine whether other amino acids in Tg were released as quantitatively as the iodoamino acids, free amino acids in the lysosomal digest were measured, and total free amino acid release was compared with a similar analysis performed after digestion of [131I]Tg with 6 N HCl. Total amino acid release was much less complete than iodoamino acid release, indicating preferential release of iodoamino acids from Tg by lysosomal digestion. Analysis of the lysosomal digest by HPLC on a size exclusion column indicated that Tg was degraded to peptides with a mol wt less than 4000. Assuming that the in vitro lysosomal digestion system represents a valid model for the physiological proteolytic system that degrades Tg, the results of the present study suggest that a substantial portion of the Tg in the thyroid is not degraded to free amino acids and that peptide fragments of Tg are normally present in the thyroid. In such a case, the fate and possible physiological activity of these fragments require further elucidation.\r"

  ".W": "Pulsatile administration of glucagon to perifused rat hepatocytes stimulates hepatocyte glucose production (HGP) more effectively than continuous administration. Having established that this effect was due to delayed relaxation of glucagon-stimulated HGP (t1/2 for decay = 3.54 +/- 0.60 min) we wished to examine the mechanism of response termination. Delayed dissociation of glucagon from its receptor was excluded by the brisk washout of [125I]glucagon from perifusion columns (t1/2 = 1.00 +/- 0.13) and the rapid decay in glucagon-stimulated cAMP released into the perifusion medium (t1/2 = 1.14 +/- 0.12). The relaxation of the HGP response to a pulse of administered cAMP was comparable to the decay in glucagon-stimulated HGP (t1/2 = 3.28 +/- 0.22). Furthermore, the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutyl-methylxanthine did not alter the decay of the HGP response to glucagon despite increasing the amplitude of the response (t1/2 = 3.04 +/- 0.36). These data place the rate-limiting step for HGP relaxation distal to cAMP generation and degradation. The decay of the beta-hydroxybutyrate response to a glucagon pulse was not different from the cAMP response (t1/2 = 1.14 +/- 0.23), whereas the decay of gluconeogenesis from lactate was not significantly different from HGP relaxation (t1/2 = 1.94 +/- 0.08). We conclude that rate-limiting events for HGP relaxation occur distal to the second messenger cascade; however, ketogenesis is more closely coupled to the kinetics of cAMP. These results may help to explain the absence of excessive ketosis during fasting in normal humans, who secrete glucagon episodically at 10- to 14-min intervals.\r"

Recipient rats received bilateral adrenalectomy, followed by the implantation of adrenal cortical tissue beneath the renal capsule. The tissue was transplanted either immediately after its isolation or after pretreatment with 1 week of culture (either at 24 C or in the presence of 95% oxygen).

The addition of a high dose of iodide (10(-4) M) to such cultures caused a marked increase in c-myc mRNA levels, [3H]thymidine incorporation, and mitotic activity. The incorporation of [3H]thymidine started 30-36 h after the addition of iodide. The stimulatory effect was abolished by a simultaneous incubation with methimazole. The concentration dependence of the iodide-induced stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation was similar to that of an inhibitory effect on adenylate cyclase activity. W-7, an inhibitor of calmodulin activity, as well as epinephrine, agents that reduce cAMP levels, also stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation. Moreover, the stimulatory effect of iodide was reduced in the presence of forskolin. The results suggest that an organic form of iodine stimulates thyroid cell growth by reducing cAMP levels and demonstrate the presence of a growth stimulatory pathway in porcine thyroid cells that is independent of exogenous polypeptide growth factors or hormones.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies from our laboratory showed 1) that adenosine (1.65 microM), a substance released by tissues in energy-deficient states, stimulated glucagon secretion by activation of A2 purinergic receptors, and 2) that this effect was potentiated by a low substimulating concentration of epinephrine through activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors. The present work was undertaken to assess the subtype of alpha-adrenergic receptor involved in this potentiation. Therefore, we used adrenergic blockers and agonist drugs more specific for alpha 1- or alpha 2-adrenergic receptors. The potentiating effect of epinephrine (0.01 microM) on glucagon secretion induced by adenosine (1.65 microM) was not prevented by an alpha 1-adrenergic blocker, prazosine (6 microM), but was suppressed by an alpha 2-adrenergic blocker, yohimbine (0.6 microM). The implication of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors in the potentiating effect was confirmed by the use of selective alpha 1- or alpha 2-adrenergic agonist drugs. Indeed, clonidine (0.01 microM), an alpha 2-agonist, ineffective per se, potentiated, whereas phenylephrine (0.01 microM), an alpha 1-agonist, had no effect on glucagon secretion induced by adenosine. We conclude that the potentiation by epinephrine of adenosine-induced glucagon secretion is mediated by alpha 2-adrenergic receptor activation. A potentiation between the effects of A2 purinergic and alpha 2-adrenergic agonists may be of physiological relevance in stressful energy-deficient states, when an increase in glucagon secretion is necessary.\r"

  ".W": "To determine directly whether somatostatin-28 (S-28) physiologically regulates GH secretion, and what its contribution is relative to somatostatin-14 (S-14), we have compared the effects of immunoneutralization with a specific S-28 antibody with those of an anti S-14/S-28 serum on GH secretory dynamics in the rat. Plasma samples were obtained every 15 min for 7 h (1000-1700 h) from conscious, chronically cannulated rats after iv administration of 1 ml of one of the following sera: 1) rabbit anti S-28 (reacts with S-28, but not with S-14; maximum binding, 297 pmol/ml), 2) nonimmune rabbit serum, 3) sheep anti-S-14/S-28 serum (maximum binding, 9.4 nmol S-14 or S-28/ml), and 4) nonimmune sheep serum. A comparison of the mean integrated plasma GH levels during peak and trough periods showed significantly higher trough GH levels in both antibody-treated groups compared to those in the corresponding controls. In the anti-S-14/S-28-treated group, the elevation of trough period GH levels (40.5 +/- 3.5 ng/ml) represented a 3.25-fold increase (P less than 0.01) compared to the control value (12.5 +/- 1.5 ng/ml). In the anti-S-28-treated group, trough period GH levels (14 +/- 1.6 ng/ml) showed a 2.3-fold increase (P less than 0.01) compared to the control value (6.1 +/- 0.9 ng/ml). Mean peak period GH levels were 1.35-fold higher (P less than 0.05) than control values in the anti-S-14/S-28-treated group; anti-S-28 serum did not change mean peak GH levels. These data provide strong evidence that circulating S-28 (like S-14) physiologically regulates trough GH secretion and that the contribution of S-28 to GH inhibition is as important as that of S-14.\r"

Fetuses were obtained at 17 and 21 days of gestation, or pups were killed at different ages after birth. The dams on LID were markedly iodine deficient and developed a large goiter. Their thyroidal iodine content was only 4% of that of LID + I dams. The iodine deficiency of the LID mothers was severe enough to result in very low plasma T4 levels and in hepatic and cerebral T3 deficiency, despite normal circulating levels of T3. The fetuses from LID dams had low concentrations of iodine in their placentas and thyroid glands, and were deficient both in T4 and T3 in all tissues studied, including the brain. After birth, however, suckling LID pups were able to increase the plasma T4 to levels which were higher than those found in either LID fetuses or in adult LID progeny, although plasma T4 was always lower than in age-paired LID + I animals. This increase in T4 was probably due to an approximately 5-fold increase in iodine intake while suckling. Milk from LID mothers was found to contain 22% of the amount of iodine found in milk from LID + I dams, in contrast to their iodine intake, which was about 4% that of the LID + I rats. Cerebral T3 levels were the same for LID and for LID + I pups throughout most of the postnatal period of brain development. This finding might explain the difficulties encountered in obtaining an experimental model of neurological cretinism in rats.\r"

  ".W": "There have not been reports analyzing in detail the reproductive hormone changes in hypogonadal men after usual therapeutic injections of testosterone cypionate (TC). In 11 hypogonadal men 200 mg intramuscular TC caused a threefold rise in serum T (peak values, days 2 to 5), a 33% increase in % free T (%FT) (days 2 to 7), and a 4.5-fold rise of absolute FT (peak on days 2 to 3), a 66% increase in % nonsex hormone-binding globulin-bound T (%non-SHBG-T) (peak days 2 to 7), a sixfold increase in absolute non-SHBG-T (peak days 4 to 5), and a threefold rise of estradiol (days 2 to 7). Many of the men achieved androgen concentrations (T, FT, and non-SHBG-T) above the respective normal concentrations between days 2 and 7; then steroid values declined to basal levels by days 13 to 14. Non-SHBG-T showed the largest-fold absolute increase and on day 4 to day 5 averaged three times the mean in normal men. Five men achieved non-SHBG-T values several times the upper limit of our total normal range. Luteinizing hormone became suppressed in men receiving their first intramuscular TC injection and remained suppressed in men receiving chronic TC. Thus, in hypogonadal men, biweekly injections of 200 mg TC result in wide variations in circulating androgen levels, from high to elevated shortly after intramuscular TC declining to basal by days 13 to 14.\r"

In this study, abnormal luteolysis, as a second factor of luteal dysfunction, was assessed in 13 women with endometriosis and 25 control patients by measurement of ovarian vein estradiol (E2) and P during the follicular phase. The results reveal that women with endometriosis have (1) significantly lower ovarian vein E2, (2) significantly higher both peripheral and ovarian vein P, and (3) threefold higher P/E2 ratios than controls during the follicular phase. These data support the concept of continued P production from an active corpus luteum well into the follicular phase of the following cycle in women with endometriosis. Failure of adequate luteolysis is a second aspect of luteal dysfunction in endometriosis and strongly supports the growing body of data confirming ovulatory asynchrony in the minimal; endometriosis infertility syndrome.\r"

In one of the patients whose Mullerian aplasia had been diagnosed 15 years previously, premature ovarian failure developed.

Embryos that resulted in pregnancy produced significantly higher levels of embryo-derived PAF in vitro than embryos that failed to result in pregnancy. Of a further 85 embryos, 43% had a level of embryo-derived PAF that fell in the same range as the embryos that resulted in pregnancy. The production of embryo-derived PAF was related to the type of treatment used to induce follicular development (with clomiphene citrate and human menopausal gonadotropin commencing on day 5 giving best results); the size and estradiol production of the follicles producing the embryo; the age of the embryo culture medium; and the morphology and cell number of the embryos.\r"

Ten semen samples were each divided into two equal volumes; one was cryopreserved while the other half remained untreated. Frozen samples were thawed, and initial evaluations for motility and hamster egg penetration were made on both untreated and frozen-thawed samples. The time difference between the initial evaluations for the two treatment groups was approximately 30 minutes as a result of the time required to freeze and thaw aliquots. Subsequent evaluations were made 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours later. Over all times both the motility and fertilizability of cryopreserved spermatozoa were significantly reduced (P less than 0.05) when compared with those of untreated sperm. The pattern of motility loss over time was similar between untreated and frozen-thawed sperm (P greater than 0.10). Conversely, differences between untreated and frozen-thawed sperm in fertilizability patterns were dramatic (P less than 0.05). This was evidenced by penetration rates for cryopreserved sperm highest at 0 hour and decreasing over time, whereas penetration by untreated spermatozoa was lowest at 0 hour, increasing to a maximum at 24 hours. These observations may be important in the development of laboratory protocols for freezing and clinical protocols for using frozen-thawed sperm.\r"

Hence, internal ATP standard had to be added to each sample to allow calculation of endogenous ATP. Mean recovery of ATP was 98.5%. The intrassay and interassay coefficients of variation were 3.0% and 3.9%, respectively. A correlation between the number of progressively motile spermatozoa and the ATP concentration was found (r = 0.89, P = 0.0005, n = 22). The mean level of ATP was 0.49 nmol/living sperm X 10(6) in semen with normal sperm motility and sperm density obtained from 22 men attending our fertility clinic. Seminal ATP was detected only in the spermatozoa.\r"

There were 100 transfers of one or two surviving embryos from which 26 pregnancies were initiated. Several factors significantly influenced embryo survival after thawing. They were: the developmental stage of frozen embryos; the appearance of the embryo at the time of freezing; and the mode of ovarian stimulation in the IVF cycle. The pregnancy rate after frozen-thawed embryo transfer was higher with 4-cell frozen embryos than with embryos at all other stages combined. There were also tendencies for the pregnancy rate to be higher if a spontaneous luteinizing hormone surge occurred in the transfer cycle or if the duration of embryo storage did not exceed 1 to 2 months. The results obtained support a new policy in IVF-ET programs: it should be advantageous for the sterile couple if the immediate fresh embryo transfer is only performed with the categories of embryos that demonstrate a poor aptitude for survival following cryopreservation procedures.\r"

Following reversal of Falope ring sterilization, the estimated cumulative probability of pregnancy 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after surgery was 28.4%, 48.8%, 69.3%, and 87.2% respectively. The corresponding estimates following reversal of cautery sterilization were lower at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months following surgery: 22.7%, 37.8%, 52.4%, and 57.9%, respectively. The ectopic tubal pregnancy and spontaneous abortion rate were higher among women sterilized with monopolar cautery. A decreased pregnancy rate was associated with ampullary-isthmic anastomosis in the cautery group; however, pregnancy was least likely to occur in women with shortened oviducts of less than 4 cm.\r"

  ".U": "87247409\r", 
  ".W": "Chronic and transient hyperprolactinemia have been associated with luteal phase dysfunction in both spontaneously cycling women and those subjected to ovarian hyperstimulation by exogenous gonadotropins. It is the objective of the in vitro and in vivo studies reported herein to examine the possibility that prolactin (PRL), a known constituent of ovarian follicular fluid, may account, at least in part, for the luteinization inhibitory (LI) activity exerted by follicular fluid (FF) under both physiologic and pathophysiologic circumstances. In vitro treatment with human PRL (100 ng/ml) reduced by 57% the specific binding of luteinizing hormone (LH) to follicle-stimulating hormone(FSH)-primed cultured rat granulosa cells, an effect associated with a 2.6-fold diminution of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG; 10 ng/ml)-stimulated progesterone biosynthesis. Importantly, the ability of PRL to exert a direct inhibitory effect on FSH-supported LH binding was fully reproduced under in vivo conditions. Inasmuch as the acquisition of LH receptors and progesterone (P) biosynthetic capacity are acceptable as criteria of granulosa cell luteinization, the authors' findings indicate that PRL, acting at concentrations achievable in vivo within the ovarian FF, may account, if only in part, for physiologically encountered LI-like activity. Moreover, subject to limitations imposed by the rat model employed, consideration also must be given to the possibility that hyperprolactinemia-associated luteal phase dysfunction may not only reflect the suppressive effect(s) of PRL at the central level of the reproductive axis, but may also be due, at least in part, to the consequences of inappropriately elevated PRL at the level of the follicular microenvironment.\r"

If laparoscopic drainage of a SDT, marsupialization, and adequate fulguration of cystic wall provide a low incidence of recurrence, the risk of oophorectomy and the necessity of laparotomy will be avoided. The aspirate contents should be examined and histopathologic confirmation of the clinical diagnosis and exclusion of a malignant process should always be performed. The laparoscopic approach must be investigated further to determine its efficacy compared with the conventional approach.\r"

Patients were identified for stage of disease, danazol usage before and after surgery, and identifiable infertility factors. Fertility rates were analyzed with monthly fecundity rates and a two-parameter exponential model. Results indicate monthly fecundity rates comparable to other forms of therapy for stage I and stage II endometriosis, but substantially higher than more traditional modalities for stage III disease. The two-parameter model revealed \"cure\" rates comparable or lower than with major conservative surgery or danazol therapy, but a \"monthly\" probability of pregnancy\" substantially higher than with other treatments. These results indicate that, in experienced hands, laser laparoscopic vaporization of endometriosis is as efficacious as other published forms of therapy, including use in moderate and severe disease. In addition, these results suggest an immediate, transient effect upon the patient with endometriosis-associated infertility.\r"

The technique for laser treatment and the success of the method depend on precise variations of mode, power, beam diameter, and \"buttoning\" the endocervical mucosal remnant. Twelve of the 15 patients were relieved of stenosis and 9 achieved pregnancy within 2 years of the operative procedure. Critical analysis of possible causative factors in this study revealed that virtually every case of stenosis had been iatrogenic.\r"

This fluid was analyzed for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), prostaglandin F2a (PGF2a), 13,14-dihydro-15 keto-PGF2a (PGFM), and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Protein content of the fluid also was determined. No difference (P greater than 0.05) in cul-de-sac fluid volume was found between women with and without endometriosis, nor were differences detected in the level of any of the prostanoids measured in fluid from infertile control patients compared with those with endometriosis. This was true regardless of whether the prostanoids were expressed as a concentration, total amount in fluid, or as a ratio of prostanoid to protein content. The present study does not support the theory that cul-de-sac fluid prostanoids provide a useful diagnostic index of endometriosis.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred forty-nine patients who underwent surgery for tubal pregnancy at five hospitals in Seattle (WA) between 1975 and 1979 were interviewed to determine the risk factors for this disorder. Their responses were compared with those of 706 control women who had conceived an intrauterine pregnancy during the same time period during which the tubal pregnancies occurred. A higher proportion of cases reported a history of infertility (attempt to conceive without success for a period of at least 1 year) than controls (relative risk [RR] = 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.7-3.7). Women who were diagnosed in the investigation of their infertility as having tubal or ovulatory dysfunction had relative risks of tubal pregnancy of 5.8 (95% CI = 2.1-16.4) and 3.4 (95% CI = 1.3-8.5), respectively. The average time over which subjects had attempted to conceive before index pregnancies that were planned was longer among cases (15.4 months) than among controls (6.9 months). These results support the hypothesis that a history of infertility predisposes women to an increased risk of tubal pregnancy. The authors also found that, among infertile women, about twice as many cases (14.3%) as controls (6.8%) were current fertility drug users (RR = 3.1; 95% CI = 1.1-9.1), which suggests that the use of fertility drug(s) may further increase the risk of tubal pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "The authors recently reported on the follicular response to clomiphene citrate (CC) and human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG) in patients with one or two ovaries participating in a program of in vitro fertilization. This study was designed to analyze the follicular fluid hormones in patients with one or two ovaries in order to elucidate the compensatory mechanisms by which a single ovary achieves folliculogenesis equal to that of two ovaries. Twenty-one follicles from ten patients with one ovary were compared to 30 follicles from eight patients with two ovaries present. Ovulation induction was achieved using a standard protocol with sequential CC and hMG. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was administered after appropriate estradiol (E2) values and ultrasonic findings, and oocyte aspiration by laparoscopy was performed 33 hours later. Follicular fluid (FF) hormones were assayed by standard radioimmunoassay techniques and no differences were found in the levels of progesterone (P), testosterone, estradiol/testosterone ratio, prolactin, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone. However, follicles from patients with one ovary had a lower mean concentration of E2 (286 versus 542 ng/ml, P = 0.001) and a lower mean E2/P ratio (0.055 versus 0.107, P = 0.016). Also, the mean follicular diameters and volumes were similar in both groups. In view of the authors' previous finding of a comparable number of mature oocytes from patients with either one or two ovaries, these data suggest that follicles from patients with a single ovary may achieve comparable oocyte maturity despite less efficient production of E2. Although FF E2 levels were lower in patients with one ovary, this dysynchrony between oocyte maturity and FF E2 values does not appear to affect outcome adversely.\r"

The authors report their second TT series performed between October 1, 1985 and February 1, 1986. Of 59 transfers, 18 clinical pregnancies were obtained, of which 2 were ectopic and 1 spontaneously aborted. A triplet pregnancy, 3 sets of twins, and 11 singleton pregnancies delivered normally. Pregnancy was highly correlated with number of mature oocytes aspirated and with number of oocytes transferred. The study demonstrates that, in combination, serum estrogen levels and number of developing follicles observed by ultrasound are predictive of the number of mature oocytes obtained at laparoscopy. These predictive values provide excellent criteria for selecting stimulation cycles for TT and for informing individual patients of the probability for success before surgery.\r"

Nondiabetic BB/W rats (group 1) were compared with moderately (group 2) and severely (group 3) hyperglycemic diabetic animals of similar age. Urinary protein excretion and morphometric measurements of glomerular basement membrane (GBM) width and mesangial area were performed after 4, 8, and 12 mo of study. At 4 mo, urinary protein excretion both in group 2 (9.3 +/- 0.7 mg/24 h) and group 3 (24.8 +/- 1.98 mg/24 h) exceeded that in group 1 (5.4 +/- 0.6 mg/24 h; P less than .05). Moreover, proteinuria in group 3 was significantly greater than in group 2 (P less than .05). In addition, proteinuria increased in group 3 animals between 4 and 12 mo of study but did not advance in groups 1 or 2. GBM width in both diabetic groups (168.8 +/- 2.4 and 165.7 +/- 2.2 nm, groups 2 and 3, respectively) exceeded that in group 1 (148.3 +/- 3.8 nm; P less than .01) by 4 mo. At 12 mo, severely hyperglycemic group 3 animals had significantly greater GBM thickening than group 2. GBM width increased in all three groups over the course of study, but the rate of growth did not differ between groups 1 and 2. However, the rate of growth in group 3 was greater than in either group 1 or group 2. Urinary protein excretion correlated significantly with GBM width in diabetic rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The relaxative responses were elicited in vitro to acetylcholine (-8.0 to -5.5 log M) and histamine (-7.0 to -3.0 log M) after precontraction with norepinephrine (-6.0 log M). The maximum relaxations produced by both acetylcholine and histamine expressed as percentages of the contractions to norepinephrine were significantly lower in diabetic than in nondiabetic rats. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that in diabetic BB rats there was consistent evidence of swollen cells, raised nuclei, and sloughing of nuclei in endothelial cells of the aorta. In nondiabetic animals these features were not evident. These findings suggest the presence of a functional and morphological defect in endothelial cells in the aorta of the BB rat.\r"

We surveyed the designated family practice contacts in all U.S. medical schools and achieved a response rate of 84%. We found wide variations in the degree to which academic family practice units provide patient care within the walls of the academic medical center. Those departments which perform greater than 50% of their patient care within the academic medical center are more involved in medical center-sponsored alternative health care delivery systems. Residents of these programs receive more than 50% of their training at the academic medical center. These departments are also more likely to teach a required first-year course in the medical school curriculum. Finally, we found a suggestion, not statistically significant, that these departments may be supporting a greater proportion of their total budgets through clinical revenues. We conclude that academic family medicine units may benefit from closer clinical and financial connections to parent academic medical centers.\r"

Results from a questionnaire mailed to a random sample of 430 family physicians indicated physicians practice health promotion for themselves more than revealed in earlier studies and that physicians frequently incorporate many preventive medicine activities into their professional practices. Several exceptions, however, were noted. When identifying barriers to practicing preventive medicine, respondents overwhelmingly selected lack of patient motivation more than any other factor.\r"

The purpose of this study was to examine, from the doctor's point of view, changes in the doctor-patient relationship resulting from the physician's pregnancy and child-bearing. Five faculty family physicians participated via individual interviews and group discussion. Two women without children, the clinical psychologist interviewer, and other faculty family physicians joined in the review of the interviews and the group discussion. Comprehensibility, reciprocity, mutuality, identification, credibility, availability for long-term relationships, nurturing, and support emerged as themes in the evolution of relationships with patients. The process of examining the effect of childbearing on our relationships with patients unexpectedly revealed how the dual expectation of career and motherhood causes colleagues without children to feel inadequate. On the other hand, the study itself had the positive effect of facilitating the resolution of long-standing tensions among group members. We conclude that becoming mothers, a significant life change, had a transforming effect on our clinical work with patients and that studying this effect as a group fostered growth in the relationships among the participants.\r"

A total of 221 (62%) of the questionnaires were adequately completed and returned. They indicated that a majority of the primary care provided respondents and their family members was by a physician other than a family practitioner. Care seeking behaviors were not significantly different between practitioners who were family practice residency trained and those who were not, except in the care given to the respondent's spouse, when a family practitioner was used more often. The responses also revealed that the majority of office visits for three of the specific medical problem categories were made to family practitioners, while in four other categories the majority of visits were to specialists. Approximately half of the visits in the remaining three categories were made to family practitioners. There is an apparent discrepancy between the tenet that family physicians can competently care for a vast majority of medical problems and their actual care seeking behaviors.\r"

The presentations were made during the semester in which the students were also taking a required health education course. A second group of seventh graders in the same school system did not receive the presentations but had the same health education course and served as the control group. Both groups showed similar gains in knowledge during their semester of health education. However, only the group which received the DOC talks showed a continuation of knowledge gains on a follow-up questionnaire. Also, only the group which saw the presentations showed positive behavior changes including decreased substance use. While aware of the study's methodologic limitations, we believe the results support the value of the community physician presenting DOC talks to supplement the usual school health curriculum.\r"

The decentralized teaching effort, which consisted of a variety of practice models, had the potential for an inconsistent exposure to the required educational content of the clerkship. Course monitoring and evaluation also was difficult because of the logistics of the various teaching sites. In order to minimize inconsistent content exposure, efforts to standardize course requirements occurred through criterion-based faculty and teaching site selection, initial faculty development, and provision of appropriate library resources. Continuous standardization consisted of required periodic faculty development, frequent evaluation of faculty and teaching sites, and comparative studies of student performance. Standardization of some of the students' patient care experience resulted from the use of predetermined list of required clinical encounters. A computer assisted evaluation of students' patient experience log defined the actual student patient care population at various teaching sites and compared this to course requirements. Deficits in patient care experiences were addressed by providing either the appropriate patient encounters or alternative experiences through print, audiovisual, or teaching sessions.\r"

Three areas were surveyed: residents' views of the elderly, their comparisons of the elderly with younger patients and their ideas of what it would be like to work with elderly patients. The results show that generally residents have positive views of geriatric patients. Residents see the elderly as comparing favorably with younger people. Also, they view the elderly as possessing favorable personality characteristics, such as a sense of humor, preference for independence, flexibility, and being easy to work with. Although residents are positive about working with the elderly, they do feel some ambivalence toward working in stroke-rehabilitation programs, as well as with geriatric patients who have lost contact with reality. Medical educators need to be aware of the perceptions that residents have concerning the geriatric patient, since this type of patient will in the future comprise a larger percentage of the resident's practice.\r"

Responses indicated that the majority of third-year residents (55%) intended to practice obstetrics on graduation. Rural practice plans were significantly correlated with a decision to practice obstetrics, but suburban practice plans were negatively correlated. Residents who reported the presence of a good family practice obstetric role model were significantly more likely to practice obstetrics; residents deciding against obstetrical practice expressed concerns about legal liability and malpractice fees. These findings have important implications for family practice training programs if obstetrics is to remain a central part of comprehensive family care.\r"

Family physicians were used in the outpatient setting and obstetricians in the delivery room in 27% of programs. The 37% of programs using family physician faculty as preceptors in both outpatient and delivery room settings differed from other programs in four significant ways: they were most likely to be medical school or military residency programs; they were most likely to be located in the north central and mountain states; they reported greater general satisfaction with their preceptors; and more of their graduates practiced obstetrics after residency.\r"

Forty-one percent of the patients who completed the SDS rated themselves at least mildly depressed; 37% scored in the same range on the DACL. Four percent of the patients scored in the severe depression range on the SDS, while 15% scored in the severe depression range on the DACL. Residents treating these patients, however, failed to diagnose depression in more than 85% of the patients who had rated themselves as at least mildly depressed on either inventory. The residents also failed to diagnose depression in more than 70% of those who had rated themselves as severely depressed. Teaching and research implications are discussed.\r"

In addition, faculty rated residents and residents rated themselves on overall burnout. Mean resident scores on the Maslach ranged from moderate to high, while global self-ratings indicated moderate burnout. Patterns did not vary across programs surveyed, postgraduate year, or gender. Faculty did not appear to be modeling burnout, since they scored in the low to moderate ranges on all Maslach subscales. Residents and faculty overwhelmingly cited time demands as the factor most responsible for resident burnout. Residency directors were more accurate than psychologist faculty in identifying which residents saw themselves as most burned out. Directors significantly underestimated the absolute level of burnout, but psychologists did not. Combined assessments of both faculty groups resulted in significantly better identification than either alone. The prevalence and patterns of burnout and difficulties in identifying affected residents are discussed in terms of the demands of residency training programs and the investment of residents and faculty in current models of medical education.\r"

It is argued that these lead to an understanding of the community's health-related beliefs and practices and to the ability to deliver community oriented health care. Examples of this ethnographic approach are given from the authors' experiences. A method to represent graphically the process of community analysis is provided.\r"

Flashlamp-pumped tunable dye lasers were coupled to small-diameter flexible quartz fibers that were placed in direct contact with biliary calculi. The minimum laser energy necessary to damage a calculus was measured for wavelengths between 450 and 700 nm and for pulse durations between 0.8 and 360 microseconds. This threshold energy increased with increasing wavelength but was not significantly affected by pulse duration. Cholesterol stones had uniformly higher thresholds than pigmented ones. When a repetitively pulsed laser was used, complete fragmentation required fewer than 500 pulses and fragments were predominantly less than 2 mm. The pulsed dye laser can effectively fragment biliary calculi when transmitted through a small-diameter quartz fiber and may be useful as a tool for fragmenting retained common duct stones.\r"

The median time interval from entry to follow-up liver biopsy was 31 mo (range, 3-44 mo). Patients were stratified into four groups according to their maximal registered ethanol consumption during follow-up. Thirty-six patients (34%) abstained from ethanol, 40 patients (38%) consumed a small amount of ethanol (less than 50 g/day), 19 patients (18%) consumed a moderate amount of ethanol (51-100 g/day), and 11 patients (10%) consumed an excessive amount of ethanol (greater than 100 g/day) during follow-up. Follow-up liver biopsy specimens demonstrated micronodular cirrhosis in 54 patients (51%), micronodular cirrhosis with development of hyperplastic nodules in 47 patients (44%), and nonclassifiable macronodular cirrhosis in 4 patients (4%); 1 patient showed portal fibrosis. The cumulative prevalence of patients developing hyperplastic nodules increased significantly (p = 0.014 for trend) with decreasing ethanol consumption, the prevalence being 57% in abstainers, 58% in those who consumed a small amount of ethanol, 32% in those who consumed a moderate amount, and 18% in those who consumed an excessive amount. In conclusion, alcoholic men with micronodular cirrhosis develop hyperplastic nodules during follow-up, the rate and prevalence of which is significantly related to the amount of ethanol consumed during follow-up. Ethanol consumption may inhibit hepatocellular proliferation in alcoholic men with micronodular cirrhosis.\r"

We have studied the influence of chronic ethanol consumption on bilirubin metabolism as well as on biliary calcium and bile acids in 16 pair-fed male rats. The animals received nutritionally adequate liquid diets containing 36% of total calories either as ethanol or isocaloric carbohydrates for 4 wk. Bile flow was significantly enhanced after chronic ethanol feeding (p less than 0.05 after 90-min bile collection) and was found to be mainly bile acid-independent. The biliary output and concentration of bilirubin monoconjugates, bilirubin diconjugates, and total calcium was significantly increased (p less than 0.01) in alcohol-fed rats compared with controls. This was not the case for unconjugated bilirubin and for the calcium/bile acid ratio. Hepatic bilirubin uridine-5'-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase activity (p less than 0.01), serum total bilirubin (p less than 0.01), and serum free hemoglobin (p less than 0.001) were significantly increased after ethanol consumption. These data provide evidence for enhanced bilirubin production, probably due to hemolysis, after alcohol ingestion. The enhanced bile production is associated with an increased hepatic conjugation and subsequent biliary secretion of bilirubin conjugates. In advanced alcoholic liver disease, these compensatory mechanisms may fail and contribute to the development of jaundice.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of purified toxins A and B on intestinal secretion, epithelial permeability, and morphology in perfused rabbit ileal loops. Intestinal permeability after toxin exposure was assessed by blood-to-lumen clearance of [3H]mannitol. Toxin A at doses of 5-100 micrograms/10 cm ileal loop caused a threefold to fivefold increase in [3H]mannitol permeability (p less than 0.001) vs. equal concentrations of toxin B or buffer control. In addition, perfusate from toxin A-exposed loops contained significantly more neutrophils (p less than 0.001) than toxin B or control loops. Toxin A caused severe epithelial cell necrosis with destruction of villi and polymorphonuclear infiltration. Electron microscopy of mucosa subjected to a low dose of toxin revealed widespread nonspecific dilatation of endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial swelling. In contrast to these effects of toxin A in ileal loops, in vitro experiments with ileal explants in short-term organ culture revealed that toxin A had no effect on epithelial cell permeability, protein synthesis, release of alkaline phosphatase, or morphology. Our results show that purified toxin A but not toxin B causes severe inflammatory enteritis in rabbit ileal loops, but has no discernable effect on rabbit ileum in vitro. We speculate that toxin A may contribute significantly to intestinal damage in C. difficile-associated colitis and diarrhea.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the influence of the composition of refluxed material in the pathogenesis of esophagitis, a dog model was used to allow esophageal reflux of gastric secretions, duodenal pancreaticobiliary secretions, and a combination of both. Control dogs had only an esophageal incision. Incompetence of the cardia was established in five other groups by transecting the distal sphincter and creating a hiatal hernia. Two groups received moderate or maximal histamine stimulation of gastric secretion. A gastrojejunostomy, pyloromyotomy, and duodenal closure distal to the papilla were added in the other three groups, creating duodenogastric reflux; two were stimulated with histamine and one had a truncal vagotomy and no histamine. Radiologic, manometric, and pH studies showed that incompetence of the cardia was obtained. The dogs were killed 4 wk postoperatively and evaluated for gross and microscopic evidence of esophagitis. Erosive esophagitis was found only in dogs with reflux of gastric juice following maximal acid stimulation. Microscopic reflux changes in esophageal mucosa were seen in all groups; again, changes were most pronounced in dogs with maximal gastric stimulation. The combination of duodenogastric reflux and moderate gastric stimulation produced more significant alterations in microscopic reflux criteria than did moderate gastric stimulation alone. Our conclusions are as follows: In a dog model of gastroesophageal reflux of various combinations of gastric and duodenal secretory components, erosive esophagitis occurred only with maximal gastric stimulation in the absence of duodenogastric reflux. All reflux combinations, however, produced some degree of microscopic changes, suggesting they could eventually cause gross changes with a lengthened experimental time span.\r"

  ".W": "We previously have shown that aging alters the expression of several intestinal enzymes during cell migration from the crypt base to the villus tip. The activities of many mucosal enzymes are dramatically altered by starvation and refeeding. We compared the effects of starvation and refeeding on the activities of selected intestinal enzymes in young and aging Fischer 344 rats. Gut mass fell during starvation and rose during refeeding to a similar extent in both groups. Sucrase and maltase specific activities in control aging rats were lower than in young controls and, during starvation, enzyme activities declined at approximately similar rates in both groups. Total duodenal enzyme activities fell by about two-thirds in young animals and by greater than 80% in aged animals. Alkaline phosphatase and adenosine deaminase activities also were lower in aging than young animals. During refeeding, enzyme activities rose more in aging rats than in the young. In fact, the specific activities of sucrase and maltase in aging rats refed for 1 day exceeded the values found in fed aging controls. The adaptive responses of duodenal enzymes exceeded those in the jejunum. In conclusion, the aging intestine responds appropriately to starvation and refeeding. However, the fluctuations in brush-border enzyme activities are much greater in aging than in young rats. Such alterations may be an important influence of aging on gut differentiation and might have an adverse impact upon nutritional maintenance in aging animals.\r"

A double-isotope technique was used to measure gastric emptying, and esophageal emptying was measured as the time for a bolus of the solid meal to enter the stomach. Gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed by a questionnaire. On 2 days each patient received cisapride (10 mg) or placebo intravenously, 5 min before an esophageal and gastric emptying test. After these 2 days each subject took cisapride (10 mg q.i.d., p.o.) for 1 mo. Cisapride improved solid and liquid gastric emptying (p less than 0.001), but had no significant effect on esophageal emptying (p less than 0.1). Upper gastrointestinal symptoms were reduced after cisapride (p less than 0.001), and no side effects were reported. These results indicate that gastroparesis is a treatable cause of morbidity in progressive systemic sclerosis.\r"

Whether assessed by current or previous habits, patients with Crohn's disease were more likely to be or have been smokers than their matched controls and the association appeared strongest at disease onset (matched relative risk 4.1, p less than 0.001). In contrast, patients with ulcerative colitis assessed in the same way were less likely to be smokers compared with their matched controls, with the association being equally strong at disease onset and currently (matched relative risk 0.17, p less than 0.001). Among patients with ulcerative colitis who were exsmokers, 76% reported stopping smoking before disease onset compared with 13% of exsmokers with Crohn's disease. Contrary to earlier reports, there were only small and nonsignificant increases in the risk of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis in exsmokers. The strength, temporal precedence, and contrasting nature of the associations are evidence that smoking has an important etiologic role in inflammatory bowel disease. Smoking appears to be a factor in determining whether Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis develops in predisposed individuals.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, glycine-extended processing intermediates of progastrin were identified in porcine stomach using a radioimmunoassay with conventional polyclonal antisera developed against a synthetic peptide analogue for progastrin processing intermediates, gastrin 6-G(Tyr-Gly-Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-Gly). We developed monoclonal antibodies specific for glycine-extended processing intermediates of progastrin (gastrin G). Monoclonal antibody 109-21 appeared to require the carboxyl-terminal pentapeptide structure of gastrin 6-G for maximal binding. Cross-reactivities of 109-21 against gastrin 17 I, gastrin 17 II, cholecystokinin-octapeptide, des(SO3) cholecystokinin-octapeptide, and gastrin 6-G-R-R were respectively 1%, less than 0.1%, less than 0.1%, 0.1%, and 0.5%. With this monoclonal antibody and a polyclonal gastrin antibody we examined the concentrations of gastrin and gastrin G in tissue and the effects of bombesin on the release of gastrin and gastrin G from rat antral mucosa in tissue culture. The gastrin G to gastrin ratio was 2.2 in rat antral mucosa and 0.66 in rat duodenal mucosa. In tissue culture, bombesin significantly stimulated gastrin and gastrin-G secretion at doses of 10(-8) and 3 X 10(-8) M. Atropine (10(-6) M) abolished the actions of carbachol to stimulate gastrin and gastrin-G secretion but had no effect on bombesin-stimulated gastrin and gastrin-G secretion. These results suggest that gastrin G is cosecreted with gastrin in response to carbachol and bombesin, and the stimulation of gastrin and gastrin-G secretion by bombesin does not involve cholinergic neural pathways and may reflect a direct action on gastrin cells.\r"

  ".W": "Two types of benzodiazepine receptors have been identified in the central nervous system. The aim of these experiments was to determine if ligands for these receptors alter basal water absorption by rat ileum in vivo after central administration. Specifically, the effects on net water flux of the systemic and central administration of diazepam and the central administration of RO 5-4864, a \"peripheral\" receptor agonist, and of the \"central\" receptor agonists clonazepam and lorazepam were determined. Diazepam increased absorption at 4.3 mg/250 g body wt i.p. but not at 430 micrograms/250 g body wt. Intracerebroventricular diazepam (28 micrograms) increased water absorption. Larger doses had a greater effect. Intracerebroventricular RO 5-4864 (100 micrograms) increased net water absorption; intracerebroventricular lorazepam (50 or 100 micrograms) or clonazepam (100 micrograms) reduced basal water absorption. Systemic atropine (2 mg/kg i.v.) abolished the effect of lorazepam (100 micrograms i.c.v.). To evaluate the possibility that diazepam and RO 5-4864 have effects similar to those of calcium channel antagonists, nifedipine, nitrendipine, and diltiazem were administered intracerebroventricularly. The dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists nifedipine and nitrendipine increased basal water absorption. Diltiazem, a benzothiazepine compound, did not alter basal water absorption. We conclude that the binding of benzodiazepine agonists to receptors located in the central nervous system alters net water absorption by the rat ileum. Agonists of the central benzodiazepine receptor reduce basal water absorption via a cholinergic neural pathway. Peripheral agonists increase net water absorption. In this model, diazepam behaves as a peripheral receptor agonist. This study provides further evidence of a role for the central nervous system in the regulation of intestinal absorption of water and ions.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-four randomized, partially gastrectomized subjects were studied to assess whether gastric histologic findings after partial gastrectomy were related to reflux. Gastric biopsy specimens (12) were taken at different distances from the anastomosis. Histologic findings were as follows: (a) hyperplastic changes of the foveolar epithelium and (b) loss of the chief and parietal gland cells with atrophy of gastric glands (chronic atrophic gastritis). Hyperplastic changes typical of the perianastomotic area gradually decreased with increasing distance from the anastomosis. Hyperplastic changes showed a greater prevalence in Billroth II than in Billroth I subjects (100% vs. 29.4%). No significant association was found between histologic findings and symptoms. Hourly bile acid quantity (fasting bile reflux) and concentration were determined in the gastric aspirates. Bile reflux was greater after Billroth II than after Billroth I (fasting bile reflux median values: 30.5 vs. 0.18 mumol/h, respectively). The same was true for bile acid concentration (mean bile acid concentration median values: 624.9 vs. 17.5 mumol/L, respectively). Moreover, Billroth I subjects with hyperplasia had a greater quantity and concentration of reflux than those without hyperplasia (fasting bile reflux and mean bile acid concentration median values: 2.6 vs. 0.8 mumol/h and 4.7 vs. 2.7 mumol/L, respectively). These findings show that bile reflux is correlated with hyperplastic changes of the foveolar epithelium, but prevalence and severity of atrophic gastritis were not related to reflux. Therefore, although we failed to show any relationship between chronic atrophic gastritis and reflux, foveolar hyperplasia was shown to be reflux related.\r"

Doses of 5, 10, and 15 mg CyA/kg body wt or the Miglyol 812 vehicle were administered intraperitoneally for 1, 2, and 3 wk to separate groups of rats to investigate the mechanism of this cholestasis. At 1 wk a dose-response relationship between serum CyA levels and increasing CyA doses was noted. A maximum CyA blood level was achieved by 2 wk with the 10- and 15-mg/kg doses. Subsequent studies were performed using the smaller (10 mg/kg) dose administered for 3 wk. This dose resulted in a marked increase in serum bile acid levels compared with vehicle-treated controls (24.6 +/- 4.0 vs. 4.3 +/- 1.2 mumol/L, p less than 0.001) without inducing significant changes in serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and albumin levels or hepatic architectural alterations. With CyA treatment, baseline bile flow decreased by 35% and bile salt secretion decreased by 25% compared with vehicle-treated animals. Cyclosporin A and vehicle-treated rats were infused intravenously with taurocholate (4 mumol/min X kg) for 2 h and then depleted of bile salts over the next 24 h. Bile samples collected over this period were graphed as bile salt secretion versus bile flow. The mean slope of the linear regression for the CyA-treated rats was 62% of the control, demonstrating a decrease in bile salt-dependent flow. Extrapolation of the linear regression to the ordinate demonstrated a 22% decrease in bile-independent flow with CyA treatment. Therefore, in our experimental model of CyA-induced cholestasis, the decrease in flow observed was the result of a decrease in both bile salt-dependent and bile salt-independent flows and occurred in the absence of significant biochemical or histologically evident hepatotoxicity.\r"

  ".U": "87247945\r", 
  ".W": "Sucralfate has been reported to protect the esophageal epithelium of the rabbit and cat against acid injury. To determine the contribution of its components, aluminum hydroxide and sucrose octasulfate (SOS), rabbit esophageal epithelia were mounted in Ussing chambers to monitor changes in electrical resistance (R) upon exposure to HCl (pH 1.4-1.6). In untreated tissues, acidification of the luminal bath produced a progressive decline in R, indicating increased epithelial permeability. Sucralfate added to the luminal bath 45 min after acidification increased R to preexposure levels--an effect accompanied by increased luminal pH. Similar to sucralfate, aluminum hydroxide added to the acidified bath increased R and luminal pH. However, the effect of aluminum hydroxide could be abolished by titration with HCl to maintain pH similar to acid-treated control tissues. Tissues treated with sucralfate and whose luminal solutions were titrated with HCl to maintain pH similar to controls no longer exhibited an increase in R but, in contrast to aluminum hydroxide treatment, the acid-induced decline in R was prevented. This action of sucralfate was shown to be a property of its other component, SOS. Sucrose octasulfate, like acid-titrated sucralfate solutions, did not increase luminal bath pH, yet prevented the acid-induced decline in R. Confirmation of protection by SOS was shown by additional morphologic and flux studies. Thus 1 h after luminal bath acidification in the Ussing chamber, SOS-treated tissues demonstrated less damage (injury score 0.6 +/- 0.4 vs. 1.6 +/- 0.3, p less than 0.05) and lower permeability to mannitol (0.003 +/- 0.001 vs. 0.013 +/- 0.005 mumol/h X cm2, p less than 0.05) than untreated tissues. Similarly, 1 h of luminal perfusion with HCl in vivo produced less damage (injury score 1.3 +/- 0.5 vs. 3.5 +/- 0.4, p less than 0.05) and less H+ efflux from the lumen in SOS-treated than untreated tissues. These results indicate that sucralfate can protect against acid injury in esophagus and that this protection is mediated by (a) intraluminal pH buffering through its content of aluminum hydroxide and (b) enhancing mucosal defense against H+ entry and injury through its content of SOS.\r"

  ".W": "An increased risk of cancer of the esophagus has been reported in alcoholics and in populations with low dietary vitamin A consumption. As cancer is a disorder of cell proliferation and differentiation, we have assessed the combined effects of ethanol and vitamin A deficiency on cell proliferation and structure of the esophagus. Weanling male rats were fed liquid diets with either a standard amount of vitamin A or lacking vitamin A for 8 wk. Littermates were pair-fed the same diets with carbohydrate (36% of calories) replaced by ethanol. Rats were given [3H]thymidine 1 h before death, and the labeling index of the proliferative basal cells was determined on radioautographs. In rats fed the normal vitamin A diet with or without ethanol, plasma vitamin A was normal. Hepatic vitamin A was markedly decreased, whereas esophageal vitamin A was increased after ethanol feeding. Ethanol feeding resulted in a twofold increase in basal cell labeling index (14.6 +/- 0.7 vs. 6.8 +/- 0.8; p less than 0.001). The thickness of the epithelium and the morphology of basal cells were not altered by ethanol feeding. In rats fed the vitamin A-deficient diet with or without ethanol, plasma vitamin A was extremely low, and hepatic and esophageal vitamin A were unmeasurable. The epithelium was thin (with a 50% reduction in thickness) and showed abnormalities of basal cells and increased production of keratohyalin granules, changes suggesting a disorder in the epithelial differentiation. This altered differentiation caused by vitamin A deficiency was not affected by ethanol consumption. Ethanol feeding again resulted in an increase in the basal cell labeling index (13.2 +/- 1.6 vs. 4.8 +/- 0.7; p less than 0.001). Vitamin A deficiency had no effect on basal cell proliferation. Therefore, the stimulatory effect of ethanol on cell proliferation is independent of vitamin A deficiency. Nevertheless, the combined actions of ethanol and vitamin A deficiency may have a synergistic effect on the susceptibility of the esophagus to carcinogens.\r"

Fifty patients were enrolled in each treatment group. All lesions were pretreated with injection of epinephrine 1:10,000. Subsequently, 1-sec pulses of 80 watt YAG laser power were applied to the vessel or 1- to 2-sec pulses of electrocoagulation of 25 watt BICAP at a setting of 10. The 10 F BICAP probe was always used. Definitive hemostasis after one treatment amounted to 72% in both the laser and in the BICAP group. After two sessions the cumulative success rate was 88% in the laser group and 86% in the BICAP group. Emergency surgery and mortality were also comparable. One perforation occurred in each treatment group and both patients were operated upon without complications. It is concluded that both YAG laser and BICAP are highly and equally effective in the treatment of severe bleeding from peptic ulcers. This study stresses the importance of repeated treatment sessions in order to obtain optimal results.\r"

The median length of follow-up after pouch construction was 36 months (range, 6 to 120 months), and an average of three examinations were performed per patient (range, 1 to 12). Of 127 examinations performed in asymptomatic patients, the pouch was normal in 117 cases, and there was mesh erosion into the pouch in 10 cases. The remaining 228 examinations were for symptoms that included pouchitis (56), difficulty in intubation (47), incontinence (35), follow-up of treated pouchitis (18), parastomal sepsis (22), blood in the stool (13), anemia (8), excess mucus discharge (6), valve prolapse (4), and purulent discharge from the stoma (1). Eighty-four examinations were normal; 144 revealed a likely cause for the symptoms and led to appropriate treatment, which in 45 patients was surgical. Fiberoptic endoscopy was therapeutic in 6 patients in whom it was used on 10 occasions to intubate a pouch with a slipped valve. Radiographic studies were seldom used, with pouchograms being carried out in 16 patients and fistulograms in 5. Only the fistulograms contributed to the assessment of each patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirteen patients with this condition were referred to the authors for consideration of urgent endoscopic common bile duct decompression. All had been judged to be poor surgical candidates. Pus was released from the common bile duct by sphincterotomy within 24 hours of admission in all 13. Stones were removed endoscopically in 10 patients (77%) without complications. After endoscopic stone removal, symptoms, signs, and abnormal laboratory values returned to normal rapidly; follow-up endoscopic retrograde cholangiography did not show retained stones. Three patients whose large stones precluded endoscopic removal underwent operative choledocholithotomy. Urgent endoscopic sphincterotomy offers an important alternative in the treatment of acute suppurative obstructive cholangitis secondary to choledocholithiasis.\r"

We performed endoscopic injection sclerotherapy in eight patients with extrahepatic portal vein obstruction and bleeding esophageal varices. In contrast to other reported series, all but one of our patients were adults at the time sclerotherapy was initiated. Six had episodes of continued bleeding after a variety of surgical procedures. After sclerotherapy, five had no further bleeding with a mean follow-up of 26 months. Three patients had episodes of bleeding prior to variceal obliteration; two of these patients underwent surgical intervention after emergency sclerosis to stabilize their condition. Transfusion requirements were less after sclerosis (p = 0.035), although the follow-up has been relatively short (mean, 24 months) compared to the duration of bleeding. Our results suggest that endoscopic sclerotherapy is an effective therapeutic alternative, and perhaps the initial treatment of choice, in patients with extrahepatic portal vein obstruction and bleeding esophageal varices.\r"

Correct identification of the cause of seizures is important for initiating the appropriate therapy. Selection of an anti-convulsant depends partially upon the side effects to be avoided in specific patients. Complete remission of late-life seizures is uncommon, although excellent seizure control can usually be achieved with the correct medication.\r"

Before starting a vigorous training program, however, the elderly should undergo a thorough physical examination, including medical history, and an exercise stress test to evaluate cardiovascular status. These test results should be used to indicate intensity, duration, and frequency of exercise, as well as reassure patients of its safety. With this approach, full benefits of regular endurance exercise can be realized.\r"

Twenty nine had evidence of oesophagitis which was graded according to severity. Acid exposure (pH less than 4) was calculated in each case for the total study period, the recumbent and upright periods, and the three hour period after the evening meal. Exposure in the upright period correlated closet (r=0.92: p less than 0.001) with that during the total period. Recumbent exposure correlated with both upright and postprandial exposure (p less than 0.001). Acid exposure during all four periods correlated significantly with the severity of oesophagitis, but postprandial acid exposure correlated best and recumbent acid exposure least well. Although acid clearance in the total, recumbent and upright periods correlated with oesophagitis, postprandial clearance showed the closest relationship. Thus the magnitude of daytime reflux, especially postprandial reflux and acid clearance, is more closely related than nocturnal reflux to oesophagitis. The results do not support the contention that night time reflux is inherently more injurious than daytime reflux to the oesophageal mucosa.\r"

Seventy eight of these high risk patients died; 25 at home, 19 in hospital without surgery and 34 postoperatively. Ninety eight patients had bleeding ulcers, 132 perforated ulcers and five had both bleeding and perforated ulcers. One hundred and forty one of these 235 patients (60%) were taking a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and the individual agents have been listed. The overall incidence of NSAID use in a hospital control group was 9.9%. The first sign of an ulcer was a life threatening complication in 58.2% of patients taking a NSAID. Nearly 80% of all ulcer related deaths occurred in patients using an anti-inflammatory agent. Patients using these drugs were older, with more pre-existing medical conditions and had larger ulcers than those not taking NSAIDs. The mortality associated with a peptic ulcer complication in patients taking a NSAID was more than twice that in patients with no such drug history. There appears to be a relationship between the development of a life threatening complication of peptic ulceration and NSAID ingestion. Much of the associated mortality and morbidity may be potentially avoidable.\r"

By survival analysis, it was found that marriage breakup adversely affected duodenal ulcer course, that age 50 years and under, female sex, and aspirin use tended to do so, and that smoking, alcohol ingestion, and paracetamol use did not. Proven healing of index ulcer within four months was associated with a small and non-significant reduction in symptom occurrence over time.\r"

  ".W": "The interaction between smoking and the effect of histamine H2-antagonists on intragastric acidity was examined in a double blind double dummy placebo controlled study. Healthy volunteers, 11 smokers and 10 non-smokers, were given, on four separate days at least one week apart, either placebo or cimetidine 800 mg nocte or ranitidine 2 X 150 mg per day or ranitidine 300 mg nocte. Tablets were taken at 2115 and 0900 h. Smokers smoked a cigarette hourly from 0700 to 2300 h. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner were standardised. Intragastric acidity was measured with a combined intragastric glass electrode and a solid state recorder. The subjects were fully ambulatory. The three histamine H2-receptor antagonist regimens were less effective (p = 0.04) in smokers than in non-smokers, but the difference between acidity of smokers and non-smokers was small. Means of medians of pH during a 24-h period with placebo, cimetidine 800 mg, ranitidine 2 X 150 mg and ranitidine 300 mg were 1.6, 2.3, 3.1, and 2.7 in smokers and 1.5, 2.7, 3.2, and 3.1 in non-smokers, respectively. In a second part of the study seven chronic smokers were reexamined after acutely stopping smoking: inhibition of gastric acidity by histamine H2-receptor antagonists was similar before and after withdrawal. Smoking does not affect intragastric acidity in untreated volunteers and only slightly decreases the effectiveness of histamine H2-receptor antagonists on intragastric acidity. This effect best in part explains the unfavourable effect of smoking on healing of peptic ulcer in patients treated with these drugs.\r"

In both groups, men secreted more than women, and smokers secreted more than non-smokers. Significant correlations were found between maximal gastric secretion on the one hand, and height, age, and chronic smoking on the other. After standardisation for these factors, including standardisation to zero smoking, the subgroups of the controls no longer differed significantly, as was also the case for the duodenal ulcer patients. Thus, differences in height, age, and smoking habit were sufficient to account for the variation in maximal secretion between individuals in either the control or duodenal ulcer groups. Even after standardisation, however, the duodenal ulcer patients still secreted significantly more than the controls, and therefore, although chronic smoking has been shown to affect maximal gastric secretion, it does not appear to be the sole reason for hypersecretion in duodenal ulcer patients.\r"

A dose related reduction in intragastric acidity was seen. All single nocturnal (2300 h) doses of cimetidine produced anacidity overnight. This was not achieved with dosing at 1800 h although the duration of inhibition of gastric acidity was longer. Inhibition of overnight acid and pepsin outputs were similarly dose and timing related, but inhibition of peptic activity was much less after dosing at 1800 h. Cimetidine 1600 mg and ranitidine 300 mg were similar in their effects.\r"

The superior mesenteric artery blood flow response to a combination of a treadmill exercise and a liquid meal in 15 volunteers was significantly smaller at five minutes from the end of the stimuli, than the response to the meal alone (15 controls) (635 +/- 51 ml/min v 846 +/- 72 ml/min) (p less than 0.025), but not different at any other time.

Mucosal penetration by the organisms may be responsible for the unusual immune response. In one patient, treatment with antibiotics eliminated the spirochaetes and resulted in a clinical improvement. Spirochaetes should not always be considered as harmless commensals in the colon.\r"

Senokot was used to accelerate and codeine and/or loperamide to prolong transit in subjects maintained on a constant high fibre diet. Doses of Senokot or codeine/loperamide were adjusted to halve or double transit time measured during a three week control period on diet alone. Stools were collected throughout and analysed for bacterial mass by a gravimetric procedure. Transit was measured by a continuous marker method. Senokot decreased mean transit time from 63.9 to 25.0 hours (n = 6), with increased stool weight from 148 to 285 g/day. Bacterial mass increased in all subjects from a mean of 16.5 to 20.3 g/day (dry weight) (p less than 0.025). Codeine/loperamide increased mean transit time from 47.1 to 87.6 hours (n = 5), with decreased stool weight from 182 to 119 g/day. Bacterial mass decreased in all but one subject from a mean of 18.9 to 16.1 g/day (NS). There was a significant correlation between transit time and bacterial mass in all three periods (r = 0.77, p less than 0.001). Changes in transit time are shown to alter microbial growth in the human colon and result in altered stool output, on a constant diet. Factors which affect transit may be as important as diet in determining large bowel function and hence susceptibility to disease.\r"

  ".W": "The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) initially bred in Kyoto is the most widely studied animal model of essential hypertension. As controls for the SHR, most workers have used normotensive descendants of Wistar rats from the colony in Kyoto from which the SHR strain was derived (Wistar-Kyoto rats, WKY). But the presumption that WKY are serviceable controls for SHR rests on the tacit assumption that all WKY constitute a single inbred strain. It appears, however, that whereas the National Institutes of Health distributed breeding stocks of SHR after they had been fully inbred (i.e., after 20 generations of brother-sister mating), the breeding stocks of WKY were distributed before they had been fully inbred. Accordingly, the biological variability of WKY may be greater than that of SHR. To investigate this possibility, we obtained SHR and WKY from two of the largest commercial suppliers in the United States and systematically measured the growth rate and blood pressure of these rats under identical physical and metabolic conditions. We found that WKY from one source differed from those of the other in both growth rate and blood pressure. In contrast, the SHR from the two suppliers were not different with respect to either growth rate or blood pressure. Because the National Institutes of Health may have distributed breeding stocks of WKY as early as the F6 generation, it is possible that rats currently designated as WKY do not constitute a single inbred strain. Thus, interpretation of studies employing \"the Wistar-Kyoto rat strain\" as a control for the SHR may be much more problematic than has previously been recognized.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the potential effect of hypertension on the results of thallium-201 stress imaging in patients with chest pain, 272 thallium-201 stress tests performed in 133 hypertensive patients and 139 normotensive patients over a 1-year period were reviewed. Normotensive and hypertensive patients were similar in age, gender distribution, prevalence of cardiac risk factors (tobacco smoking, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus), medications, and clinical symptoms of coronary disease. Electrocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy were present in 16 hypertensive patients. Stepwise probability analysis was used to determine the likelihood of coronary artery disease for each patient. In patients with mid to high likelihood of coronary disease (greater than 25% probability), abnormal thallium-201 stress images were present in 54 of 60 (90%) hypertensive patients compared with 51 of 64 (80%) normotensive patients. However, in 73 patients with a low likelihood of coronary disease (less than or equal to 25% probability), abnormal thallium-201 stress images were present in 21 patients (29%) of the hypertensive group compared with only 5 of 75 (7%) of the normotensive patients (p less than 0.001). These findings suggest that in patients with a mid to high likelihood of coronary artery disease, coexistent hypertension does not affect the results of thallium-201 exercise stress testing. However, in patients with a low likelihood of coronary artery disease, abnormal thallium-201 stress images are obtained more frequently in hypertensive patients than in normotensive patients.\r"

  ".W": "A recently presented hypothesis contends that the excess coronary heart disease mortality associated with hypertension is more prominent in lean men than in overweight men. This hypothesis was addressed using data collected in the Israeli Ischemic Heart Disease Study (n = 10,059). The ratios of age-adjusted 15-year death rates in hypertensive and normotensive men were 4.7, 2.8, 2.0, and 1.9 in the Quetelet index groups of less than 2.29, 2.29 to 2.56, 2.56 to 2.83 and greater than 2.83 g/cm2, respectively. The corresponding ratios for all-cause mortality were 2.2, 2.1, 2.0, and 1.7, respectively. The group with the highest all-cause age-adjusted mortality, at 33.6%, was that of the leanest (less than 2.29 g/cm2, bottom 20% of the Quetelet index distribution) hypertensive subjects. The same group also displayed the highest coronary heart disease mortality (age-adjusted rate, 18.2%). The findings persisted for both smokers and nonsmokers and after exclusion of men with coronary heart disease or diabetics at intake, men on antihypertensive medication, or those who died in the first 2 years of follow-up (1963-1965). A multivariate risk score for developing myocardial infarction was calculated, based on levels of age, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus, and Quetelet index. This score varied little across the four Quetelet index groups in hypertensive men: 5-year mean estimated risks of myocardial infarction were between 70 and 74/1000. In normotensive men the scores increased from 19/1000 in the leanest subjects to 29/1000 in the overweight ones.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The increase in heart rate following tilt was similar in groups and exhibited the same reduction in response with age. The increase in vascular resistance following tilt was strongly and positively correlated with both age and baseline vascular resistance. The latter finding was observed mainly in hypertensive subjects. The study provided evidence that differentiated responses of heart rate and vascular resistance may be observed following orthostasis. In both normal and hypertensive subjects, the age dependence of heart rate response possibly reflected differences in baroreceptor reflex control of parasympathetic and sympathetic activity. In hypertensive subjects, the vascular response was amplified with age and baseline vascular resistance, suggesting a role for structural changes of the vessels in the increased vascular response.\r"

All subjects received placebo for 2 to 4 weeks followed by either hydrochlorothiazide (25-50 mg b.i.d.) or diltiazem (120-180 mg b.i.d.) to achieve a reduction in supine diastolic pressure of 10 mm Hg or more and a final pressure below 90 mm Hg. Mean arterial pressure, forearm vascular resistance, plasma norepinephrine, and renin responses to graded lower body negative pressure (-10, -20, -40 mm Hg) and head-up tilt were examined before and after 12 weeks of treatment with either drug. Pretreatment basal values of mean arterial pressure (114 +/- 2 vs 117 +/- 2 mm Hg), forearm vascular resistance (29 +/- 3 vs 35 +/- 7 units), and plasma renin activity (0.7 +/- 0.2 vs 0.6 +/- 0.2 ng angiotensin I/ml/hr) were not significantly different between groups. There were no significant differences in basal plasma norepinephrine or in the increases of norepinephrine in response to lower body negative pressure before and after treatment in either group. Forearm vascular resistance responses to lower body negative pressure were virtually abolished in the diltiazem-treated group but not in the hydrochlorothiazide-treated group despite similar levels of mean arterial pressure and basal forearm vascular resistance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Whether the dopaminergic system may be involved in essential hypertension is of pathogenetic as well as therapeutic interest. Therefore, we investigated in eight hypertensive and 12 normal subjects cardiovascular, endocrine, and renal responses to fenoldopam, which has been characterized experimentally as an agonist of peripheral postsynaptic dopamine1 receptors. A single oral dose of fenoldopam, 100 mg, changed blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive subjects (from 163/103 to 147/76 mm Hg; p less than 0.01 for systolic and p less than 0.001 for diastolic BP) and normal subjects (from 121/81 to 123/65 mm Hg; p less than 0.001 for diastolic BP); percentage decreases in diastolic BP averaged -20 +/- 6 and -16 +/- 7%, respectively. Fenoldopam-induced effects on other variables were similar in the two groups. Heart rate rose (p less than 0.001) on average from 69 to 92 beats/min in hypertensive and from 64 to 84 beats/min in normal subjects. Effective renal plasma flow increased (from 552 to 765 and 634 to 937 ml/min/1.73 m2; p less than 0.01), while glomerular filtration rate tended to decrease (from 121 to 99 ml/min/1.73 m2 in the hypertensive and from 119 to 97 ml/min/1.73 m2; p less than 0.001 in the normal group). Fractional sodium clearance was elevated (from 2.8 to 5.2 and 1.7 to 3.8%; p less than 0.01), as was free water clearance (from -1.7 to 0.6 and -1.7 to 0.1 ml/min/1.73 m2; p less than 0.01). Potassium clearance was largely unchanged. Plasma renin activity increased about twofold (p less than 0.01 in normal subjects), and plasma aldosterone by 40% (NS). Plasma norepinephrine levels increased twofold to 2.5-fold (p less than 0.001), and urinary norepinephrine excretion fivefold to 10-fold (p less than 0.01). Fenoldopam-induced changes were not significantly modified by intravenous and/or oral pretreatment with the dopamine-receptor antagonist metoclopramide or the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin. These findings suggest that in humans, fenoldopam may acutely override the dopaminergic antagonism of metoclopramide given in clinical dosage and that its cardiovascular and renal effects are not prostaglandin-mediated. Although acute sympathetic stimulation may be partially antagonistic, the concomitant BP-lowering, renal vasodilating, and natriuretic actions of fenoldopam represent a desirable profile of a potential antihypertensive agent.\r"

To test the hypothesis that a high salt diet might alter afferent baroreceptor function, Dahl salt-resistant (DR) and salt-sensitive rats (DS) were fed a high or a low salt diet. Blood pressure was measured intra-arterially in unanesthetized animals. Aortic baroreceptor function was then evaluated during urethane anesthesia by recording multifiber aortic depressor nerve activity during a phenylephrine-induced blood pressure ramp. Mean arterial pressure in the conscious state was elevated (155 +/- 5 [SE]mm Hg) in DS fed a high salt diet but was normal in DS fed a low salt diet and in DR. Slopes of linear regressions relating aortic nerve discharge to mean arterial pressure were 71% higher in DR fed a high salt diet than in DR fed a low salt diet (p less than 0.025), indicating that high salt potentiated baroreceptor function in DR. In contrast, high salt diet produced no significant effects on baroreceptor function in DS. No salt-induced changes in dynamic or static aortic distensibility (assessed from pressure-volume curves of the in situ isolated arch) were detectable in either rat strain. Absence of salt-induced baroreceptor sensitization in DS was not due to the hypertensive state because the sensitization also failed to occur in separate groups of DS in which salt-induced hypertension had been prevented by chemical sympathectomy with 6-OH-dopamine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effect of 12 weeks of ethanol feeding on arterial blood pressure and baroceptor reflex control of heart rate in Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats. Baroceptor reflex sensitivity and pressor responsiveness were evaluated by evoking graded rises in mean arterial pressure with increasing doses of phenylephrine and angiotensin II. After 12 weeks of ethanol feeding there was a modest increase in mean arterial pressure with no change in heart rate in both strains. When angiotensin II or phenylephrine was used as the pressor agent, baroreceptor reflex curves (relationships between changes in mean arterial pressure and heart rate) of Wistar rats were shifted upward and had a markedly reduced slope compared with those of control rats, suggesting that impairment of baroreceptor reflex control of heart rate had occurred. This effect was less evident in the Sprague-Dawley rats. Ethanol-fed rats had a higher sympathetic activity, since beta-blockade with propranolol decreased heart rate to a greater degree than that seen in control rats. The pressor response curve of phenylephrine was shifted to the right in control rats challenged with ethanol (0.5 g/kg), implying the presence of alpha-blockade. This shift was not present in ethanol-fed rats, showing that tolerance had developed to this effect of ethanol. These findings show that attenuation of baroreceptor reflex function is associated with ethanol-induced hypertension but do not establish whether this is a cause or an effect of the developed hypertension.\r"

One week after operation, female Sprague-Dawley rats with two-kidney, one clip Goldblatt hypertension were either subjected to a moderate exercise program by swimming (n = 21) or kept sedentary (n = 16) for 9 weeks. Sedentary (n = 16) and exercised (n = 15) sham-operated rats served as controls. Maximal coronary blood flow and minimal coronary resistance, either per unit mass or for the entire left ventricle, an index of the functional cross-sectional area of the coronary resistance vessels, were determined in conscious, unrestrained rats by left atrial microsphere injection following maximal vasodilation with carbochrome (12 mg/kg). Following exercise, left ventricular mass was moderately (+5-10%) but significantly increased in normotensive rats, whereas left ventricular hypertrophy was significantly accentuated in the hypertensive rats. Minimal coronary resistance for the entire left ventricle was significantly decreased (-24%) in normotensive rats but did not change significantly in hypertensive rats. Minimal coronary resistance per unit mass (the coronary vasodilator reserve) tended to decrease in normotensive rats (-17%), whereas it tended to be further augmented in hypertensive rats (+13%). However, these differences were marginally significant and were not associated with any changes in maximal coronary blood flow per unit mass (the coronary flow reserve). Thus, in normal rats, exercise promoted myocardial arterial vascularity in parallel with the development of cardiac hypertrophy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The responses to alterations in extravascular pressure were studied in five orders of arterioles in the cheek pouch of normotensive and renal hypertensive hamsters. Renal hypertension was induced by bilateral compression of both kidneys using figure-of-eight ligatures. Ten to 16 days later, hamsters were anesthetized with pentobarbital (6.0 mg/100 g body weight) and a Plexiglas chamber was positioned in the cheek pouch. Chamber pressure, or extravascular pressure, was increased and decreased by +/- 10, 20, and 40 mm Hg, and arteriolar diameters were monitored continuously. The responses at -20 mm Hg and the slope of the linear portion of the chamber pressure-diameter curve (arteriolar gains) were compared between groups for each branching order of arteriole. Arteriolar responses at one chamber pressure and the arteriolar gains were enhanced in third and fourth order arterioles of the renal hypertensive group compared with the normotensive group, and the responses of these small arterioles were greater than those of larger arterioles in both groups. Control diameters of second and third order arterioles were significantly smaller in the renal hypertensive group, while the diameters after adenosine were not different. These results suggest that the enhanced responses of small arterioles in the renal hypertensive group were not related to structural alterations but may be related to an increased reactivity of smooth muscles in these small arterioles to volume expansion, thus a pressure stimulus.\r"

However, in 40-week-old rats, the activity was decreased only in SHRSP with established hypertension (0.035 +/- 0.002 vs 0.028 +/- 0.003 mol palmitic acid/mol protein WKY). Fatty acid compositions were similar among 5-week-old and 40-week-old control WKY and 5-week-old SHRSP (palmitic acid, 24%; stearic acid, 14%; oleic acid, 30%; linoleic acid, 29%; arachidonic acid, 3%), although the total amount of bound long-chain fatty acids was decreased in 5-week-old SHRSP, explaining the high fatty acid binding activity in this preparation. Fatty acid binding protein from 40-week-old SHRSP had an elevated proportion of endogenous arachidonic acid, with other fatty acids being relatively reduced (palmitic acid, 8%; stearic acid, 2%; oleic acid, 4%; linoleic acid, 10%; arachidonic acid, 76%), indicating increased arachidonic acid transport in the cytosol. These results show that genetically hypertensive rats had an alteration in fatty acid transport mediated by fatty acid binding protein; this alteration may be involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Spontaneously hypertensive rats are less susceptible than normotensive rats to disruption of the blood-brain barrier during acute hypertension. The purpose of this study was to examine mechanisms that protect the blood-brain barrier from disruption in chronically hypertensive rats during acute hypertension. Normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) were studied using intravital fluorescent microscopy and fluorescein-labeled dextran. Disruption of the blood-brain barrier was characterized by the appearance of microvascular leaky sites and quantitated by the clearance of fluorescein-labeled dextran. We measured pressure (servo null) in pial arterioles and venules 40 to 60 micron in diameter. In WKY, acute, phenylephrine-induced hypertension increased pial arteriolar pressure by 47 +/- 7 mm Hg (mean +/- SE) and pial venous pressure by 20 +/- 2 mm Hg. Leaky sites increased from 0 to 28 +/- 2. In SHRSP, acute hypertension increased pial arteriolar pressure 44 +/- 8 mm Hg, but pial venous pressure increased only 6 +/- 1 mm Hg and leaky sites increased from 0 to only 6 +/- 1. All leaky sites were venular. In another group of WKY and SHRSP, we increased pial venous pressure passively with a neck cuff. In WKY, venous pressure increased by 22 +/- 2 mm Hg, and leaky sites increased from 0 to 23 +/- 2. In SHRSP, venous pressure increased by 19 +/- 1 mm Hg, and leaky sites increased from 0 to 24 +/- 2. Thus, when venous pressure is increased to the same level in WKY and SHRSP, disruption of the blood-brain barrier is similar. We conclude that protection of the blood-brain barrier during acute hypertension in SHRSP is related to attenuation of increases in pial venous pressure, not pial arteriolar pressure, and the blood-brain barrier in venules of SHRSP probably is not inherently resistant to disruption.\r"

Additionally, the percentage of tetraploid nuclei in aortic smooth muscle cells increased to 17.0 +/- 0.2% in DOC-salt treated rats versus 7.8 +/- 0.3% in normotensive controls. Administration of propranolol (500 mg/L in drinking water) did not inhibit the development of hypertension for up to 4 weeks or the associated increase in cardiac or aortic weight in DOC-salt-treated rats, but did prevent the increase in polyploidy of aortic smooth muscle cell nuclei (8.9 +/- 0.9% in propranolol-treated rats compared to 7.8 +/- 0.3% in normotensive controls). These results indicate that propranolol inhibits the development of hypertension-induced polyploidy in aortic smooth muscle cells of DOC-salt-treated rats and that factors other than blood pressure may be important in this change.\r"

Rats were studied at 3 days (prehypertensive stage) and 4 to 6 weeks after DOCA-salt treatment (chronic hypertensive stage). Experiments were performed in anesthetized rats using conventional microiontophoretic and single-cell recording techniques. Three days after DOCA-salt administration, the treated rats showed no rise in arterial pressure in comparison with control rats, but 4 to 6 weeks later, the treated rats had significantly greater pressures (p less than 0.01) than controls. Vasopressin administered with currents of 10 to 90 nA for 1 minute produced a current-dependent increase in the firing rate of noradrenergic neurons in all rats. Increases in the firing rate of noradrenergic neurons in DOCA-salt-treated rats, whether in the prehypertensive or the chronic stage, were significantly greater than increases in control rats. These findings indicate that 1) vasopressin can affect neuronal activity in the locus ceruleus and 2) noradrenergic neurons in the locus ceruleus of DOCA-salt-treated rats have an increased responsiveness to the excitatory effects of vasopressin in both prehypertensive and chronic stages of hypertension.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine if mental stress increases muscle sympathetic nerve activity in the leg and causes a dissociation of muscle sympathetic nerve activity in the arm and the leg. We recorded heart rate, blood pressure, and efferent sympathetic nerve activity during mental stress (4 minutes of mental arithmetic) in 13 healthy men. Microelectrodes were inserted percutaneously into a fascicle of the peroneal nerve (leg) and radial nerve (arm) to measure sympathetic discharge to muscle. In Study 1, leg muscle sympathetic nerve activity was recorded in seven subjects. Mental stress significantly increased heart rate and blood pressure. Despite the increased blood pressure (which would be expected reflexly to inhibit sympathetic nerve activity), leg muscle sympathetic nerve activity (in total integrated activity, bursts per 100 heart beats or bursts per minute) increased significantly during stress. Further, whereas heart rate and blood pressure returned to normal during recovery, leg muscle sympathetic nerve activity remained elevated during recovery. In Study 2, simultaneous recordings were made of arm and leg muscle sympathetic nerve activity in six subjects. Mental stress increased heart rate and arterial pressure. Leg muscle sympathetic nerve activity again increased significantly during stress and remained elevated during recovery. In contrast, arm muscle sympathetic nerve activity did not change during stress. However, arm muscle sympathetic nerve activity increased significantly during recovery after stress. These studies indicate that a sympathoexcitatory influence of mental stress overrides or inhibits baroreceptor control of leg sympathetic nerve activity and stress causes a dissociation of arm and leg muscle sympathetic nerve activity with increased outflow to the leg but not to the arm. These observations may contribute to differences in blood flow to arm and leg during mental stress.\r"

  ".W": "The selective alpha 2-adrenergic receptor antagonist rauwolscine was structurally modified to yield a series of arylamine carboxamide derivatives, which were investigated as potential molecular probes for the localization and structural characterization of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors. The arylamine carboxamides differ in the number of carbon atoms separating the reactive phenyl moiety from the fused ring structure of the parent compound, rauwolscine carboxylate. Competitive inhibition studies with [3H]rauwolscine in rat kidney membranes indicate that the affinity for the carboxamide derivatives is inversely related to the length of the carbon spacer arm with rauwolscine 4-aminophenyl carboxamide (zero carbon spacer arm; rau-AMPC) exhibiting the highest affinity (Kd = 2.3 +/- 0.2 nM). Radioiodination of rau-AMPC yields a ligand, 125I-rau-AMPC, which binds to rat kidney alpha 2-adrenergic receptors with high affinity, as determined by both kinetic analysis (Kd = k2/k1 = 0.016 min-1/2.1 X 10(7) M-1 min-1 = 0.76 nM) and equilibrium binding studies (Kd = 0.78 +/- 0.16 nM). 125I-rau-AMPC was quantitatively converted to the photolabile arylazide derivative 17 alpha-hydroxy-20 alpha-yohimban-16 beta-(N-4-azido-3-[125I]iodophenyl) carboxamide (125I-rau-AZPC). In a partially purified receptor preparation from porcine brain, this compound photolabels a major (Mr = 62,000) peptide. The labeling of this peptide is inhibited by adrenergic agonists and antagonists with a rank order of potency consistent with an alpha 2-adrenergic receptor binding site. Both 125I-rau-AMPC and the photolabile arylazide derivative, 125I-rau-AZPC, should prove useful as molecular probes for the structural and biochemical characterization of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors.\r"

We investigated whether chronic prazosin treatment (2 mg/kg, i.p.) caused a functional alteration of other renal alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, using the isolated perfused rat kidney. Prazosin significantly reduced blood pressure and increased heart rate during the 3-day treatment. Renal nerve stimulation (2-8 Hz, 10 V, 1 msec) caused a frequency-dependent increase in renovascular resistance, which was potently blocked by prazosin in vitro in both control and prazosin-treated rat kidneys. The vasoconstrictor response to the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor-selective agonist BHT 933 (3-300 microM) was significantly higher in kidneys from prazosin-treated rats. Yohimbine (3-300 nM) potentiated the response to renal nerve stimulation in both treatment groups. The increase in vascular resistance following renal nerve stimulation was lower in kidneys from prazosin-treated rats, but the response to the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor agonist methoxamine (0.3-1 microM) was unchanged. Further studies revealed that renal nerve stimulation-evoked norepinephrine release from prazosin-treated rat kidneys was significantly lower than release from untreated controls. This response could be normalized to control levels by a combination of cocaine (10 microM) and yohimbine (100 nM). Thus, chronic prazosin treatment caused enhanced alpha 2-adrenergic receptor-mediated vasoconstriction and facilitated renal prejunctional inhibitory mechanisms. We conclude that with chronic alpha 1 adrenergic receptor blockade there is increased alpha 2-adrenergic receptor function in at least two and possibly three sites in the kidney; these include postjunctional tubular, prejunctional vascular, and possibly extra-junctional vascular sites.\r"

Differences in the neural tone and renal hormone levels in SHR and WKY were minimized by denervating the kidney and fixing plasma concentrations of aldosterone, vasopressin, norepinephrine, and cortisol by intravenous infusion. Renal perfusion pressure was varied using adjustable occluders on the lower aorta. The slopes of the relationships between sodium excretion and renal perfusion pressure were not significantly different in 3- to 5-week-old SHR and WKY (0.31 +/- 0.05 vs 0.42 +/- 0.06 microEq/min/g kidney weight); however, the x-intercept of this relationship was significantly shifted to the right by 15 mm Hg in SHR compared to WKY. Blood pressure was moderately elevated even in the 3- to 5-week-old SHR in comparison to WKY (98 +/- 5 vs 81 +/- 6 mm Hg). As the degree of hypertension became more severe, the slope of the pressure-natriuresis relationship became significantly lower in 6- to 9-week-old SHR compared to the corresponding slope observed in age-matched WKY (0.16 +/- 0.02 vs 0.31 +/- 0.04 microEq/min/g kidney weight). These results indicate that the relationship between sodium excretion and renal perfusion pressure is altered even in very young SHR. Thus, the resetting of kidney function occurs very early and may be necessary for the development of hypertension in SHR.\r"

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that pulsatility during acute elevation of pressure modifies this acute resetting. Activity was recorded in 21 single baroreceptor units from the isolated carotid sinuses of dogs anesthetized with chloralose. Single-unit pressure thresholds were determined with a slow ramp increase in pressure. After a control period of static pressure at 25 to 50 mm Hg, the pressure threshold averaged 69 +/- 4 (SE) mm Hg. Three graded levels of static pressure were held for 5 to 15 minutes. The levels averaged 76 +/- 4, 115 +/- 6, and 170 +/- 5 mm Hg. The corresponding nerve activity during these periods was 0, 44 +/- 6, and 63 +/- 6 spikes per second, and the resulting increases in pressure threshold averaged 10 +/- 1, 17 +/- 2, and 26 +/- 3 mm Hg, respectively. In contrast, during equivalent elevations of pulsatile pressure, nerve activity averaged 20 +/- 3, 37 +/- 4, and 61 +/- 5 spikes per second, and the increases in pressure threshold averaged 0 +/- 4, 14 +/- 2, and 24 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively. In some units, the pressure threshold decreased following elevation of pulsatile pressure. The results indicate that: pulsatility during elevation in pressure prevents or attenuates the acute baroreceptor resetting except at maximal pressure; upward resetting occurs with elevation of static pressure even when there is no nerve activity during the period of elevated pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Blood pressure rose immediately, from a baseline of 104 +/- 5 to 131 +/- 7 mm Hg at the end of a 5-minute infusion, and returned to baseline within 2 to 3 minutes after discontinuation of the infusion. When similar doses were administered by continuous infusion to previously nephrectomized rats (n = 5) or as an acute bolus to adrenalectomized rats (n = 5), blood pressure rose from 111 +/- 3 to 125 +/- 5 mm Hg and from 112 +/- 4 to 128 +/- 5 mm Hg, respectively.

This study characterizes vascular reactivity to protein kinase C activators in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Helical strips of mesenteric arteries were mounted in organ chambers for measurement of isometric contractions (responses were normalized as a percentage of maximal force in response to 100 mM KCl; in SHRSP, 350 +/- 16 mg; in WKY, 335 +/- 21 mg). Arteries from SHRSP contracted faster and developed greater force than arteries from WKY (168 +/- 9% vs 143 +/- 3%) in response to the phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. Arteries from SHRSP (0.6 X 10(-8) M) were more sensitive to the phorbol ester than those from WKY (2.2 X 10(-8) M), as indicated by the dose of the phorbol ester required to produce 50% of the maximal response to KCl. Additionally, SHRSP arteries were more sensitive to the contractile effects of mezerein, a non-phorbol ester activator of protein kinase C. Ca2+-free solution (1.0 mM EGTA) and verapamil (10(-7) M) caused relaxation (approximately -60%) of contractions in response to the phorbol ester (10(-6) M). Addition of 10(-6) M of the phorbol ester to arteries that were preincubated in Ca2+-free solution (1.0 mM EGTA for 30 minutes) elicited submaximal contractions (in SHRSP, 26 +/- 4%; in WKY, 38 +/- 7%). Upon addition of 1.6 mM Ca2+, arteries from SHRSP contracted faster (t1/2 = 2.7 +/- 0.6 minutes) than those from WKY (8.2 +/- 0.5 minutes).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The vessels from the offspring of hypertensive patients displayed no morphological changes or differences in reactivity or sensitivity to the vasoconstrictor agonists norepinephrine, angiotensin II, serotonin, and vasopressin. In the presence of cocaine, however, vessels from offspring showed a significantly greater shift in sensitivity to norepinephrine, a phenomenon also observed in previous studies of vessels from hypertensive patients. The results suggest that in essential hypertension, while morphological and functional abnormalities of the resistance vasculature may develop as the blood pressure rises, a defect in neuroeffector activity is present before hypertension is established and may be a manifestation of abnormal sympathetic nervous system activity underlying the disease.\r"

Four-week-old Dahl salt-sensitive rats were fed a high salt diet (3.3% sodium) with either high (4.0%; n = 21) or normal (0.4%; n = 21) calcium content until they were 10 to 11 weeks old. Total plasma calcium concentration was increased and plasma phosphorus concentration was decreased by the high calcium diet. At 10 weeks, food intake and intestinal absorption of sodium were not altered by the high calcium diet. There were three major observations. First, mean arterial pressure was lower in awake rats fed a high versus normal calcium diet (137 +/- 7, n = 11, vs 165 +/- 6 mm Hg, n = 10, respectively; p less than 0.05). This pressure difference was dependent on intact autonomic transmission, since ganglionic blockade eliminated the significant difference between pressures in rats fed high (78 +/- 5 mm Hg) and normal (85 +/- 6 mm Hg) calcium diets. Second, high calcium intake augmented baroreceptor reflex inhibition of renal sympathetic nerve activity and heart rate during ramp increase in arterial pressure produced by infusion of phenylephrine. Reflex suppression of renal sympathetic nerve activity was twofold greater in rats fed the high (vs normal) calcium diet (-2.79 +/- 0.25 vs -1.34 +/- 0.14% delta/delta mm Hg, respectively; n = 9 rats per group; p less than 0.05). Third, high calcium intake did not attenuate vascular responsiveness, since pressor responses to norepinephrine and angiotensin II did not differ between rats fed high and normal calcium diets after ganglionic blockade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Dogs on normal dietary calcium (0.4%) had significant increases in mean arterial pressure (from 92 +/- 2 to 131 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.01); those given high dietary calcium (1.7%) had attenuated but significant increases in mean arterial pressure (from 90 +/- 2 to 107 +/- 1, p less than 0.01). The elevation of blood pressure in dogs on normal dietary calcium was primarily due to increased calculated total peripheral resistance, which was prevented by the high calcium diet. The increases in blood pressure could not be attributed to any changes in cardiac output, blood volume, or plasma norepinephrine. These results suggest that mineralocorticoid hypertension in the dog is associated with abnormalities not only in sodium, but also in calcium metabolism. Further, they suggest a direct link between sodium and calcium metabolism and may thus have implications for the pathogenesis and management of salt-dependent hypertension.\r"

In the present study, the contribution of chloride to the salt-induced hypertensive response was examined in the SHR-S, in order to test the hypothesis that diets high in chloride but moderate in sodium elevate blood pressure in genetically predisposed subjects. SHR-S were fed diets high in NaCl (1.97% Na+, 2.93% Cl-; 5% NaCl), high in chloride (2.93%) but moderate in sodium (0.39%) or moderate in NaCl (0.39% Na+, 0.61% Cl-; 1% NaCl). After 2 weeks, rats on the high (5%) NaCl diet exhibited a significant elevation in blood pressure compared to rats on the moderate (1%) NaCl diet, and this elevation was maintained throughout the next 3 weeks. SHR-S on the high chloride diet were not significantly more hypertensive than 1% NaCl-fed SHR-S during the first 3 weeks, but during the fourth and fifth weeks, SHR-S on the high chloride diet displayed a significant exacerbation of hypertension. The diet-induced elevation in blood pressure in groups fed either the 5% NaCl or high chloride (compared to 1% NaCl) diets was associated with significant decreases in norepinephrine stores in the anterior hypothalamic region, but no other changes in monoamines or monoamine metabolites in this region or in the posterior hypothalamic region.

We tested the hypothesis that this reduction in cardiac performance is due to either hemodynamic or humoral factors. Seven mongrel dogs were fed a low sodium diet (less than 2 mEq Na+ per day) for 5 weeks. Echocardiographic and radionuclide techniques were used to monitor cardiac function. There was a gradual but significant (p less than 0.01) decrease in ejection fraction from 61 +/- 7% (SD) at baseline to 47 +/- 8% after 5 weeks of sodium depletion in association with a fall in left ventricular end-diastolic volume. Ejection fraction did not change in five control dogs fed 55 mEq Na+ per day throughout the 5-week follow-up period. Myocardial contractility did not change in either salt-depleted or control dogs. Plasma norepinephrine levels in the coronary sinus were twice as high in salt-depleted as in control dogs, but there were no significant differences in arterial norepinephrine concentration between the two groups. Therefore, we concluded that reduced ejection fraction during sodium depletion resulted from hemodynamic changes (decreased preload). The excess available norepinephrine failed to increase myocardial contractility, suggesting a dysfunction at the cardiac adrenergic neuroeffector junction.\r"

Sequential phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of the polyphosphoinositides and phosphatidylinositol in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells stimulated with angiotensin II results in a coordinated series of biochemical events: a transient formation of inositol trisphosphate associated with calcium mobilization, and a biphasic, sustained formation of diacylglycerol associated with activation of protein kinase C and cytosolic alkalinization. The initial, rapid phase and the sustained phase of the angiotensin II response appear to be differentially controlled. Formation of inositol trisphosphate and mobilization of calcium are attenuated by activation of protein kinase C. Sustained diacylglycerol formation is promoted by cytosolic alkalinization, and appears to require cellular processing of the angiotensin II-receptor complex. Calcium and cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate do not appear to regulate phospholipase C-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in vascular smooth muscle. Thus, regulation of angiotensin II-stimulated second messenger generation in vascular smooth muscle is complex, perhaps involving protein kinase C activation, changes in intracellular pH, and processing of the angiotensin II-receptor complex.\r"

The rats were given either a diet containing 8% NaCl or 0.1% NaCl for 8 weeks or a diet containing 8% NaCl and a combination of reserpine, hydrochlorothiazide, and hydralazine for 8 or 2 weeks. DS on the 8% NaCl diet developed hypertension, while the other rats did not. Antihypertensive therapy for 8 or 2 weeks prevented or reversed hypertension in DS and lowered blood pressure in DR on the 8% NaCl diet. Aortic rings with and without endothelium were suspended in organ chambers for isometric tension recording. In all groups, acetylcholine, adenosine 5'-diphosphate, and thrombin caused endothelium-dependent relaxations. The relaxations in response to all agonists were significantly decreased in DS on 8% NaCl compared to relaxations in the other rats. Antihypertensive treatment for 8 or 2 weeks prevented or reversed the decreased endothelium-dependent relaxations in response to all agonists tested, but not those to the endothelium-independent agonist, sodium nitroprusside. These results suggest that antihypertensive treatment normalizes endothelium-dependent relaxations. This effect of antihypertensive treatment might be important for the prevention of cardiovascular complications in patients with hypertension.\r"

ANG II receptors and ACE are both concentrated in the nucleus of the solitary tract and dorsal motor nucleus of vagus of the rat, rabbit, sheep, and human. An ANG II receptor-containing band connecting the nucleus of the solitary tract with the dorsolateral medulla was seen in rabbit and human tissue, providing evidence for association of ANG II receptors with vagal afferent fibers. ANG II receptors were found to be concentrated in the rostral and caudal ventrolateral medulla, which corresponded to the region of C1 and A1 catecholamine-containing cell groups in the rabbit. This localization was also evident in rat and human tissue. In all four species, a prominent, ANG II receptor-rich band in the intermediate reticular nucleus was found to connect the ventrolateral medulla and the dorsal vagal complex. In humans and sheep, this band contains puncta that overlie cell bodies. One week after nodose ganglionectomy in the rat, the density of ANG II receptors in the ipsilateral dorsal vagal complex fell markedly. This fall was most prominent in the rostral dorsal motor nucleus of vagus (to 46% of control density) and in the nucleus of the solitary tract (to 56% of control).

The current experiment was performed to determine whether an intact area postrema is required for hypertension development in a low renin model of experimental hypertension in rats. In 11 rats, the area postrema was destroyed using electrical current; the extent and specificity of each lesion was confirmed later by blind histological analysis. In 12 rats, sham operations were performed. All rats were uninephrectomized and drank saline. During once-weekly injections of deoxycorticosterone pivalate (5 mg/wk) for 4 weeks, sham-operated rats (n = 10) showed a significant increase in mean arterial pressure (Days 6-28) and saline intake (Days 12-28), but no significant increase in sodium or water retention. Deoxycorticosterone-treated rats with area postrema ablation (n = 9) exhibited no change in arterial pressure, sodium retention, or water retention, but a significant increase in saline intake (Days 17-28). Plasma renin activity was equally suppressed in both groups of rats. The depressor response to ganglion blockade with hexamethonium (20 mg/kg i.v.) was significantly increased during the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th weeks of steroid treatment in sham-operated, but not area postrema-ablated, rats. Four rats (2 sham-operated; 2 ablated) showed no change in any variable over 28 days in the absence of steroid treatment. It is concluded that the area postrema may be important in some non-angiotensin-dependent forms of experimental hypertension, possibly by affecting neurogenic control mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "The presence of angiotensinogen messenger RNA (mRNA) was assessed in total RNA extracted from hepatoma, glioma, neuroblastoma, and glioma-neuroblastoma hybrid cell lines. Total RNA from 1 X 10(7) cells was extracted, transferred to a membrane, and hybridized with a 32P-labeled, full-length (1650-base pair) rat angiotensinogen complementary DNA (cDNA). Angiotensinogen RNA sequences could be definitively detected only in hepatoma cells. Steroids were used in an attempt to increase the angiotensinogen mRNA level. Dexamethasone (2 X 10(-6) M) or 17 beta-estradiol (1 X 10(-7) M) was added to the cultures 18 to 24 hours prior to harvest. Dexamethasone treatment of the hepatoma cells resulted in a large increase in angiotensinogen mRNA, whereas estradiol had no effect. Steroids failed to induce detectable levels of angiotensinogen mRNA in total RNA from the other cell lines. That the RNA was intact was ensured by hybridizing duplicate Northern blots to a 32P-labeled actin cDNA. Actin mRNA sequences were detected in all cell lines. Blot hybridization of poly(A)+RNA resulted in the visualization of a weak angiotensinogen mRNA signal for a glioma cell line and a glioma-neuroblastoma hybrid line. However, the ability to detect angiotensinogen mRNA in a cell may depend on the phenotype expressed, which can be governed by culture conditions.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between plasma angiotensin and the reduction of blood pressure with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril was studied in rats. Blood pressure was measured in conscious rats with indwelling arterial catheters. To measure angiotensin II, plasma was analyzed by physical separation of angiotensins using high performance liquid chromatography followed by radioimmunoassay. The effects of both single (acute) and long-term (chronic) dosages of enalapril were measured. After a single oral dose of enalapril (10 mg/kg), mean arterial pressure fell from 111 +/- 3 to 86 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than 0.005). Despite the blood pressure reduction, plasma angiotensin II was unaffected (control, 9.9 +/- 1.8 vs 9.7 +/- 1.1 pg/ml). After a higher single oral dose of enalapril (30 mg/kg), there was a reduction in both mean arterial pressure (81 +/- 5 mm Hg, p less than 0.005) and plasma angiotensin II concentration (2.3 +/- 0.6 pg/ml, p less than 0.01). The chronic effects of converting enzyme inhibition were evaluated in rats given enalapril in their drinking water (30 mg/kg 24 hr) for 1 week or 2 months. Mean arterial pressure remained equally low after chronic administration (for 1 week or 2 months), but plasma angiotensin II increased above normal (after 1 week, 28.9 +/- 8.7, p less than 0.01 vs control; after 2 months, 43.1 +/- 16.2 pg/ml, p less than 0.05 vs control). Although plasma angiotensin converting enzyme activity was undetectable at any time after enalapril administration, there was a partial return of the angiotensin I pressor response with chronic administration. The data are most compatible with actions of converting enzyme inhibitors independent of the blockade of plasma angiotensin II formation.\r"

  ".W": "A breeding colony of two subspecies of African green monkeys has been established in an attempt to develop a strain of nonhuman primates with inherited spontaneous hypertension. Selective breeding of normotensive and hypertensive feral animals has produced over 300 first-generation, colony-born offspring of nine possible types, which were grouped according to parentage. Blood pressures were measured by indirect methods in 335 unanesthetized animals aged 0.5 to 6 years. Analysis of variance and covariance of mean blood pressures of animals aged 0.5 to 6 years indicated significant differences between control and experimental offspring groups (p less than .001) both before and after adjusting for sex, subspecies, age, and body weight. Mean blood pressures of control and experimental (p less than .02) offspring were significantly different from 0.5 to 5 years of age. The slopes of the regression of mean blood pressure on age were significantly different between the control and experimental groups (p less than .001). Multiple linear regression analysis indicated significant differences among blood pressure, body weight, and age (p less than .001) and also between age and weight (p less than .001) between the groups. The relative contributions of age and weight to determining the mean blood pressure differed, however. The results indicate that elevated blood pressures can be detected in offspring with even one parent having elevated blood pressure from as early as 1 year of age and that the tendency to develop elevated blood pressure is transmitted from parent to offspring in this species, thereby providing a strong indication that a hypertensive strain of monkeys can be developed through selective breeding.\r"

  ".W": "In the International Prospective Primary Prevention Study in Hypertension, electrocardiographic changes before and during 3- to 5-year antihypertensive treatment were investigated in a cohort of 5819 men and women aged 40 to 64 years with entry diastolic blood pressures of 100 to 125 mm Hg. They were randomly allocated to treatment regimens that either included or excluded the slow-release beta-blocker oxprenolol. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) were assessed using the Minnesota Code and assigned to groups of normal ECGs or ECGs with pressure-related, ischemic, \"intermediate,\" or \"other\" abnormalities. Antihypertensive treatment was associated with a decrease (mainly in men) of pressure-related and (mainly in women) of intermediate abnormalities. Ischemic abnormalities increased, particularly in men. Inclusion of the beta-blocker resulted in a greater reduction in intermediate abnormalities and in a lesser increase in ischemic abnormalities. Better blood pressure control was associated with a lesser increase in ischemic abnormalities and in a regression of pressure-related abnormalities. The presence of ST segment depression and of a complete left bundle branch block in the entry ECG was associated with a significant risk for sudden death and myocardial infarction. Optimal blood pressure control prevents pressure-induced cardiac target organ damage and, hence, heart failure, and may delay the progression of ischemic abnormalities. This tallies with the lower critical cardiac event rate associated with lower blood pressure that was observed in the same study.\r"

Arterioles of both groups exhibited a large transient dilation when the Na+-K+ pump was stimulated by superfusing the cremaster muscle with physiological salt solution containing 15 mM K+ after 20 minutes of 0 mM K+ superfusion. Arteriolar dilation in response to 15 mM K+ was significantly smaller in the hypertensive animals than in sham-operated controls. Ouabain (10(-5) M and 10(-3) M) inhibited arteriolar dilation in response to 15 mM K+ in both groups of animals. Resting diameters, total active tone (assessed by application of 10(-4) M adenosine), and arteriolar responses to inhibition of the Na+-K+ pump by superfusion with 0 mM K+ or ouabain were not significantly different in normotensive and hypertensive animals. These data indicate that an electrogenic Na+-K+ pump can regulate active tone in cremasteric arterioles, and that the maximum response of this pump to stimulation with 15 mM K+ is reduced in arterioles of hamsters with two-kidney Grollman hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "The relaxation of phenylephrine-contracted blood vessels by acetylcholine, nitroprusside, or atrial natriuretic factor has been linked to elevations in cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP). Also, 8-bromo-cGMP can induce vascular relaxation in isolated vascular smooth muscle contracted with phenylephrine. We determined whether these cGMP-dependent vasodilators could relax isolated rat aortas contracted with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. cGMP was measured by radioimmunoassay. Acetylcholine, nitroprusside, and atrial natriuretic factor induced relaxation in vascular smooth muscle contracted by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. These relaxation responses were accompanied by elevations of cGMP. However, the sensitivity to these vasodilators was markedly decreased in phorbol ester-contracted vessels compared to phenylephrine-contracted vessels. Nifedipine and superoxide dismutase induced small but significant relaxations in phorbol ester-contracted vessels; however, blood vessels contracted with phenylephrine and phorbol ester relaxed completely with papaverine. There was a marked decrease in sensitivity to 8-bromo-cGMP in phorbol ester-treated vessels compared to phenylephrine-contracted vessels. Contractions induced by phorbol ester were not inhibited by amiloride or chlorpromazine. Also, following incubation in potassium-free salt solution, vessels incubated with phenylephrine or phenylephrine and phorbol ester underwent similar relaxations when exposed to potassium chloride. The contractile state induced by phorbol ester has decreased sensitivity to cGMP-dependent vasodilators. This may be due to nonspecific effects of the phorbol ester or to the mechanism by which protein kinase C activation maintains vascular tone.\r"

To evaluate the direct effects of the drug on the contractile responses of vascular tissue to adrenergic stimuli, rat caudal artery ring segments were studied before and after the addition of cyclosporin A or its ethanol vehicle in vitro. In a dose-related manner, cyclosporin A augmented the contractile response to transmural nerve stimulation, with a highly significant (p less than 0.001 relative to that produced by the vehicle) lowering of the stimulation rate, a 50% of maximum contractile response (ED50) that elicited. The difference between pretreatment and treatment maximal responses to transmural nerve stimulation was also significantly greater (p less than 0.01) in the cyclosporin A-treated preparations than in those receiving the vehicle. In similar experiments, the responses to exogenous norepinephrine were not significantly affected. The effect of cyclosporin A on transmural nerve stimulation was demonstrated at several extracellular calcium concentrations. The results suggest that cyclosporin A enhances nerve stimulation responses by a presynaptic mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "Consideration of the lung as an elastic continuum led us to investigate the possible propagation of elastic waves. Here the relevant stiffness and density are given by the Lame constants and density of the parenchyma. To test this hypothesis, we measured propagation velocities (c) in dog lobes by recording transit times of a velocity impulse on one side of the lobe and the subsequent arrival on the other side. We compared our measured values of c with elastic longitudinal wave velocities (c long) predicted by values of elastic moduli given by Lai-Fook et al. (J. Appl. Physiol. 40: 508-513, 1976) as a function of translobar pressure (PL) and our measured densities. Good agreement was found between c and c long. Typical values of c ranged from 250-1,500 cm/s as PL ranged from 2-20 cmH2O. No systematic difference in the c-c long relation was found between inflation and deflation, suggesting that the elastic moduli of lungs are essentially a function of pressure. No significant effect was observed by changing the physical properties of the gas within the lobe [air vs. He vs. sulfur hexafluoride (SF6)], suggesting that indeed we were observing waves associated with the coupling of parenchymal density to parenchymal stiffness.\r"

Conventional least-squares analysis with enforced smoothing chooses a single member of this infinite family whose features are assumed to be representative of the family as a whole. To test this assumption, the average of all ventilation-perfusion ratio (VA/Q) distributions that are compatible with given data was calculated using a linear program. The average distribution so obtained was then compared with that recovered using enforced smoothing. Six typical sets of inert gas data were studied. In all sets but one, the distribution recovered with conventional enforced smoothing closely matched the structure of the average distribution. The single exception was associated with the broad log-normal VA/Q distribution, which is rarely observed using the technique. We conclude that the VA/Q distribution conventionally recovered approximates a simple average of all compatible distributions. It therefore displays average features and only that degree of fine structural detail that is typical of the family as a whole.\r"

We have exposed the pulmonary vasculature to protamine sulfate to determine whether electrical charges play a role in protein permeability in lung vascular beds. In anephric rats, protamine sulfate increased hematocrit approximately 25%. With protamine sulfate doses of 0.08 and 0.04 mg/g body wt, lung blood-free wet-to-dry weight ratios were increased (5.24 +/- 0.8 and 4.89 +/- 0.7) compared with control (3.85 +/- 0.3) (P less than 0.05). In isolated, ventilated, and perfused lungs 0.04 mg/g body wt protamine sulfate increased pulmonary arterial pressure from 5.2 +/- 1.4 to 16.3 +/- 3.9 mmHg (P less than 0.01). These lungs gained weight and lung wet-to-dry weight ratios were significantly increased (15.33 +/- 4.26 compared with 6.04 +/- 0.24 for control lungs). Poly-L-lysine, another polycation, also caused significant increases in pulmonary arterial pressure, lung weight, and lung wet-to-dry weight ratios. The addition of diphenhydramine to the perfusate 10 min before the addition of protamine sulfate did not prevent these changes. Heparin (90 U/mg protamine sulfate) reversed the abnormalities. Pulmonary arterial pressure (7.0 +/- 1.1 mmHg) was not significantly different from the control value, lung weight did not increase, and the lung wet-to-dry weight ratio was 6.24 +/- 0.23 (P greater than 0.05). We conclude that polycations have a significant effect on pulmonary vascular resistance and perhaps on permeability.\r"

Anesthetized mongrel dogs were ventilated to maintain an end-tidal PCO2 between 35 and 40 Torr. Venous outflow from the gastrocnemius muscle was measured using an electromagnetic flow probe. The tendon was cut and attached to a strain gauge. The muscle was stimulated to contract isometrically at 2 or 4 Hz for 20 min. Hypoxia (9% O2 in N2) was then imposed for 30 min, followed by 30 min of normoxia. Blood flow first increased in proportion to the contraction frequency and then increased further a similar amount in both groups during hypoxia. O2 extraction and blood flow reached maximal levels during hypoxia in the 2-Hz group. The further O2 deficit that was accumulated during 4 Hz and hypoxia was, therefore, a result of the greater discrepancy between O2 supply and demand. O2 uptake decreased more in hypoxia than did developed tension. These results are best explained by ATP supplementation from nonaerobic energy sources that was promoted by the free-flow condition of hypoxic hypoxia.\r"

  ".W": "Intracellular pH of in vitro diaphragm preparations was determined following low- (5 Hz, 1.5 min) and high- (75 Hz, 1 min) frequency stimulation, using glass microelectrodes of the liquid membrane type (pHm). Results were compared with values obtained by the standard homogenate technique (pHh). High- and low-frequency stimulation reduced peak tetanic tension to 21 +/- 1 (SE) and 71 +/- 2% of initial values, respectively. Peak tetanic tension returned to resting values after 10- to 15-min recovery from high- or low-frequency stimulation. Resting pHm was 7.063 +/- 0.011 (n = 72), and after fatiguing stimulation declined to values as low as 6.33. During recovery pHm significantly increased and by 10 min had returned to prefatigue values. No difference was observed in the recovery of pHm between the low- and high-frequency stimulation groups (analysis of variance test, ANOVA), and in both groups pHm recovery was highly correlated to the recovery of peak tetanic tension (r = 0.94, P less than 0.001). Resting pHh was 7.219 +/- 0.023 (n = 13), which was significantly higher than the pHm value. In contrast to pHm, intracellular pHh was significantly higher during recovery from 75- vs. 5-Hz stimulation (P less than 0.05). For both groups pHh increased significantly with time and by 10 min returned to prestimulation values. The ANOVA test demonstrated that pHh values were significantly higher than pHm values during recovery from fatigue. The results from this study support our hypothesis that fatigue from both high- and low-frequency stimulation is at least partially due to the deleterious effects of intracellular acidosis on excitation-contraction coupling.\r"

One group of ponies was sensitized by subcutaneous injection of M. faeni in complete Freund's adjuvant, and the other group served as control. In both groups of ponies, measurements were made at base line and 5 h after aerosol administration of 30 ml of saline or 30 ml of 1% wt/vol particulate M. faeni antigen in saline. Saline challenge had no effect on any of the measured variables. M. faeni challenge had no effect on pulmonary mechanics or gas exchange in the control group but significantly increased respiratory frequency and minute ventilation and decreased arterial CO2 tension in the sensitized ponies. In both groups of ponies, aerosol M. faeni challenge significantly increased total white blood cell count and neutrophil numbers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid while large mononuclear cell numbers decreased. Airway responsiveness was unaltered by saline or M. faeni challenge in both pony groups. We conclude that aerosol M. faeni challenge induces pulmonary neutrophilia and abnormalities of ventilation but is not accompanied by airway hyperresponsiveness in sensitized ponies.\r"

Untrained rats were run to exhaustion at a speed of 24 m/min, up a 10% grade. Run time averaged 48:30 min. After exercise a significant reduction in glycogen was observed in the diaphragm (43% of control), intercostals (43%), heart (39%), and plantaris (76%). In the diaphragm a significant reduction was shown in both types I and II fibers using the periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain for glycogen. These findings show that muscles with vastly different aerobic capacities utilize endogenous glycogen during moderately intense submaximal endurance exercise and that the costal diaphragm muscle is not an exception as has recently been suggested.\r"

We have developed a technique for assessing diaphragmatic work in this circumstance utilizing measurements of transdiaphragmatic pressure and abdominal volume displacement. Eleven preterm infants without evidence of lung disease were studied. During periods of minimal rib cage distortion, inspiratory diaphragmatic work averaged 5.9 g X cm X ml-1, increasing to an average of 12.4 g X cm X ml-1 with periods of paradoxical rib cage motion (P less than 0.01). Inspiratory work was strongly correlated with the electrical activity of the diaphragm as measured from its moving time average (P less than 0.05). Assuming a mechanical efficiency of 4% in these infants, the caloric cost of diaphragmatic work may reach 10% of their basal metabolic rate in periods with rib cage distortion. When lung disease is superimposed, the increased metabolic demands of the diaphragm may predispose preterm infants to fatigue and may contribute to a failure to grow.\r"

The rate of blood clotting, as measured by prothrombin times, partial thromboplastin times and thrombin times, was accelerated by exercise (all P less than 0.005). The ability of euglobulin clots and plasma clots to lyse incorporated 125I-fibrin, termed 125I-euglobulin clot lysis (IEL) and 125I-plasma clot lysis (IPCL), were used as indexes of fibrinolytic activity. Marathoners had greater increases in fibrinolytic activity with exercise (76% compared with 63% for joggers and 55% for sedentary subjects by IEL; 427% compared with 418% for joggers and 309% for sedentary subjects by IPCL; all P less than 0.05). Fibrin degradation products increased with exercise (P less than 0.005 for the total group of 60 subjects). The absolute concentrations of alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor, alpha 2-macroglobulin, and antithrombin III increased with exercise (all P less than 0.005), but when concentrations were corrected for acute shifts of plasma water during exercise, the quantity of these inhibitors actually decreased (all P less than 0.005). The changes in clotting assays with exercise were not significantly correlated with changes in whole blood lactate, blood pyruvate, or rectal temperatures. Fibrinolytic assays before and after exercise correlated poorly to moderately with blood lactates (IEL: r = 0.441 and r = 0.425, respectively; IPCL: r = 0.294 and r = 0.544, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Both air and saline lung volumes were reduced in the diabetic rats, and volume-pressure (V-P) curves expressed as a percent of maximal lung volume were significantly shifted downward and to the right of those in the control group over the midportion. Total DNA and RNA contents were similar in both groups, whereas protein content and concentration and protein/DNA and RNA/DNA ratios were significantly reduced in the diabetic rats. In contrast, content and concentration of 4-hydroxy-L-proline, elastin, and crude connective tissue were significantly higher in the diabetic group. We conclude that the increase in connective tissue proteins in the BB/W rats is most likely responsible for the shift in the V-P curves.\r"

The water content was similar for the rat hindlimb muscles, however, the concentrations of protein, ATP, phosphocreatine (PCr), creatine, and glycogen ranked as SM less than PM less than WGM for all reference bases except total creatine. In contrast, concentrations of ATP, creatine, and PCr were similar in all muscles studied when expressed as ratios of [TCr]. Horse MGM had the lowest percent of water and protein per gram wet or dry weight but highest glycogen concentration of the muscles studied, irrespective of the reference base used to express concentrations. Coefficients of variation were lowest when muscle constituents were related to [TCr]. It is concluded that expressing muscle constituents relative to total creatine results in the smallest variation and is a good method for making comparisons between muscles of similar fiber composition. However, essential information concerning different types of muscle may be lost when this reference base is used.\r"

Two hours before exercise, each subject ingested a capsule containing either 80 mg of propranolol or placebo in single-blind fashion. Heart rate at 40 min of exercise was reduced (P less than 0.01) from 125 to 103 beats min at 22 degrees C and 137 to 104 beats min at 32 degrees C, demonstrating effective BB. After 40 min of exercise, esophageal temperature (Tes) was elevated with BB (P less than 0.05) from 37.66 +/- 0.04 to 38.14 +/- 0.03 and 38.13 +/- 0.04 to 38.41 +/- 0.04 degrees C at 22 and 32 degrees C, respectively. The elevated Tes resulted from a reduced core-to-skin heat flux at both temperatures, indicated by a reduction in the slope of the forearm blood flow (FBF)-Tes relationship, and a decrease in maximal FBF. Systolic blood pressure was decreased 20 mmHg with BB (P less than 0.01), whereas diastolic blood pressure was unchanged, reducing arterial pulse pressure (PP). Because PP was decreased and cardiac filling pressure was presumably not reduced (since cardiac stroke volume was elevated), we suggest that at least a part of the relative increase in peripheral vasomotor tone during BB was the consequence of reduced sinoaortic baroreceptor stimulation.\r"

Blood flow was measured with the radiolabeled microsphere technique before exercise and during treadmill exercise at 15 or 60 m/min. Alpha- (phentolamine) or beta- (propranolol) adrenergic blocking drugs were administered, and then blood flow was measured and results compared with those from saline-treated rats. Before exercise, alpha-blockade caused increases in total muscle blood flow and in all fast-twitch muscles, whereas muscles composed of greater than 20% slow-twitch fibers showed no effect. During exercise at 15 m/min, the normal increase in total muscle blood flow was attenuated by alpha-blockade. Compared with controls, blood flow was less in the high-oxidative (fast and slow) muscle fiber areas of extensor muscles, whereas blood flow to white areas of extensor muscles was increased. beta-Blockade tended to decrease muscle blood flow before exercise and during exercise at 15 m/min with no apparent relationship between the effects of blockade on blood flow and muscle fiber type. These effects of beta-blockade were not apparent during exercise at 60 m/min. We conclude that before exercise alpha-receptor effects are limited to fast muscle, whereas beta-receptor influences are independent of fiber type, beta-receptors contribute to the initial hyperemia of exercise at 15 m/min, and beta-receptor influence is inversely related to metabolic rate.\r"

Intravenous infusion of SP (0.2-3.3 pmol X kg-1 X min-1) achieving a plasma concentration of SP between 5 and 25 pM produced vasodilatation (mean +/- SD), maximal increase in skin temperature (0.9 +/- 0.3 degree C) (P less than 0.05), and fall in diastolic blood pressure (8.5 +/- 2.9 mmHg) (P less than 0.05) associated with an increase in heart rate (15 +/- 10 beats/min) (P less than 0.05).

Ventilation at rest and when stimulated by transient hypoxia increased (mean increase in resting ventilation 0.73 +/- 0.4 l/min and mean percent increase in transient ventilatory hypoxic response 41 +/- 27%).

Inhaled SP, up to 0.7 mumol, caused a small nonsignificant fall in airway function in asthmatic subjects. SP has demonstrable effects on vascular smooth muscle and control of ventilation but at the doses studied had little effect on airway function.\r"

  ".W": "To determine alveolar pressure-volume relationships, alveolar three-dimensional reconstructions were prepared from lungs fixed by vascular perfusion at various points on the pressure-volume curve. Lungs from male Sprague-Dawley rats were fixed by perfusion through the pulmonary artery following a pressure-volume maneuver to the desired pressure point on either the inflation or deflation curve. Tissue samples from lungs were serially sectioned for determination of the volume fraction of alveoli and alveolar ducts and reconstruction of alveoli. Alveoli from lungs fixed at 5 cmH2O on the deflation curve (approximating functional residual volume) had a volume of 173 X 10(3) microns3, a surface area of 11,529 microns2, a mouth opening diameter of 72.7 microns, and a mean caliper diameter of 91.8 micron (SE). Alveolar shape changes during deflation from total lung capacity to residual volume was first (30 to 10 cmH2O) associated with little change in the diameter of the alveoli (102.7 +/- 2.4 to 100.3 +/- 3.3 microns). In the range overlapping normal breathing (10 to 0 cmH2O) there was a substantial decrease in diameter (100.3 +/- 3.3 to 43.3 +/- 2.3 microns). These measurements and others made on the relative changes in the dimensions of the alveolus suggest that the elastic network, particularly around the alveolar ducts, are predominant in determining lung behavior near the volume expansion limits of the lung while the elastic and surface tension properties of the alveoli are predominant in the volume range around functional residual capacity.\r"

This block served to remove all ipsilateral (which includes all monosynaptic) inputs from PSR to I beta-cells. The effect of withholding inflation on the firing rate and the time of onset of firing of I beta-neurons was determined before, during and after application of the direct current block. There was considerable variation in the strengths of the inputs from the ipsilateral and contralateral nerves; some cells received PSR inputs from only the ipsilateral vagus, but the majority were excited with varying magnitude from both vagi. Several neurons had powerful excitatory inputs from PSR of the contralateral vagus, with the ipsilateral (monosynaptic) contribution being of minor importance.\r"

The average increase in O2 uptake (ml X kg-1 X min-1 X 100 g-1 of added wt) was 0.8% for ankle, 1.3% for hand, and 0.9% for ankle and hand weights. Gross energy cost per mile during weighted walking (120-158 kcal/mile) was comparable to and in some cases exceeded that of running which was independent of speed (120-130 kcal/mile).

The inspiratory inhibitory effect of the pontine stimulus was assessed from the effect the stimulus has on threshold for terminating inspiration. Stimulus effect increased gradually, reached a peak at 0.2-0.4 s, and declined thereafter. The time of occurrence of peak effect was different from that observed in the course of vagal stimulus trains. With long stimulus trains (19-40 s), the initial effect on inspiratory duration (TI) (i.e., shortening) rapidly subsided and, in six of eight animals, was replaced by TI prolongation. The initial effect on expiratory duration (TE) (i.e., prolongation) also gradually declined with time but TE remained above control throughout. The time constant of adaptation was very similar with vagal and pontine stimulus trains (12.2 and 11.0 s, respectively), but the gain of the adapting response was much more pronounced with pontine stimuli, resulting in a paradoxical effect while stimulation continued. We conclude that the response to pontine stimuli, as with vagal stimuli, displays both integrative and adaptive characteristics. The similarity of the time constants for vagal and pontine adaptation responses suggests that these two inputs share common processing pathways.\r"

Fluid flux was followed against the change in concentration of an impermeable tracer (Blue Dextran) measured directly with a colorimetric device. The time course of fluid flux was biphasic with an initial fast transient followed by a slow phase. Hematocrit changes unrelated to fluid flux occurred due to the Fahraeus effect, and their contribution to the total color signal was subtracted to determine the rate of fast fluid flux (Qf). Qf was related to Pi to derive fast-phase conductance (Kf). Slow-phase Kf was calculated from the constant rate of change of lobe weight. For a mean change in Pi of 7 cmH2O, 40% of the color signal was due to fluid flux. Fast- and slow-phase Kf's were 0.86 +/- 0.15 and 0.27 +/- 0.05 ml X min-1. cmH2O-1 X 100 g dry wt-1. The fast-phase Kf is smaller than that reported for plasma-perfused lobes. Possible explanations discussed are the nature of the perfusate, the mechanical properties of the interstitium, and the slow rate of rise of the driving pressure at the filtration site on the basis of a distributed model of pulmonary vascular compliance.\r"

Eight male subjects performed maximal incremental exercise tests on a cycle ergometer on two separate occasions. For the control (C) treatment, the initial work rates consisted of 4 min of unloaded pedaling (60 rpm) and 1 min of pedaling at a work rate of 30 W. Thereafter, the work rate was increased each minute by 22 W until volitional fatigue. Venous blood samples were taken before the onset of exercise and at the end of each work rate for determination of pH and lactate. Ventilatory parameters at each work rate were also monitored. Before the experimental treatment (E), the subjects performed two 3-min work bouts at high intensity (210-330 W) on the cycle ergometer in order to prematurely raise blood lactate levels and lower blood pH. The same incremental exercise test as C was then performed. The results indicated that the increase in VE/VO2 occurred at similar work rates and %VO2max although the venous H+ and lactate concentrations were significantly elevated during the E treatment. These results suggest that a decrease in the blood pH resulting from blood lactate accumulation is not responsible for the increase in VE/VO2 during incremental exercise.\r"

A family of such curves was obtained by releasing the muscle at different points in time during contraction. Stiffnesses of the SEC (slopes of the stress-strain curves) at a specific stress level calculated from these curves (constant-stress stiffness) showed significant difference from one another. The same difference can also be characterized by the slope of the linear stiffness-stress curve, the constant A. The constant A during a 10-s isometric contraction was maximal at 2 s. It then decreased with time. This stiffness behavior is only seen when the effect of stress is held constant or eliminated. If stress is allowed to increase with time as it does during a tetanus then stiffness appears to increase monotonically. The SEC stiffness during active contraction was found to vary within the boundaries of the stiffness of muscle in rigor (upper limit) and that at resting state (lower limit).\r"

There was a significant correlation between arterial O2 partial pressure (PaO2) and the PCr/Pi ratio or pHi; however, between PaO2 130-33 mmHg, metabolite changes were not significant. PCr/Pi and pHi decreased significantly when PaO2 was lowered below 33 and 28 mmHg, respectively. After recovery, metabolite ratios and pHi returned to base-line values within 5 min. During the early phases of hypoxia and recovery, there were large fluctuations in metabolites and pHi, indicating that mitochondrial reactions were not in a steady state. After several minutes of hypoxia or recovery, PCr/Pi and pHi stabilized, suggesting steady state kinetics for mitochondrial respiration. NMR is extremely sensitive to changes in mitochondrial oxygenation, and stable PCr/Pi and pHi indicate that O2 tension in cerebral mitochondria of the newborn lamb is constant between PaO2 of 30 and 140 mmHg.\r"

A box-balloon system, connected to the breathing circuit, allowed smoke to be inhaled spontaneously through the isolated upper airway while preserving its normal respiratory flow and pressure. Our results showed the following. Inhalation of cigarette smoke (25-50% concentration, 300-400 ml) caused a marked increase in activity of laryngeal irritant receptors which were either silent or randomly discharging during control breathing [their activity increased from a control value of 1.67 +/- 0.50 (mean +/- SE; n = 21) to a peak of 5.03 +/- 0.85 impulses/s in 11-15 s]. The activity of laryngeal cold receptors was reduced to 77.3 and 63.8% of control (n = 9) during the two breaths of smoke inhalation, respectively. After returning toward the base-line activity, a more pronounced inhibition (26.3% of control) occurred at three to nine breaths after the smoke inhalation. A small but significant decrease (88.5% of control) in the inspiratory discharge of laryngeal mechanoreceptors was observed during the first test breath. These effects were independent of the CO2 content of the smoke. Furthermore, there was no difference between the responses of these laryngeal afferents to high- and low-nicotine cigarette smoke.\r"

To test this hypothesis, isosmotic isonatremic metabolic alkalosis was produced in two groups of anesthetized, paralyzed, and mechanically ventilated dogs (8 in each group). Group II animals received 50 mg/kg of acetazolamide intravenously 1 h before induction of metabolic alkalosis of 5-h duration. Renal effects of acetazolamide were eliminated by ligation of renal pedicles. In both groups cisternal CSF [Na+] remained relatively constant during metabolic alkalosis. In group I CSF [Cl-] decreased 3.6 and 8.2 meq/l, respectively, 2.5 and 5 h after induction of metabolic alkalosis. Respective increments in CSF [HCO3-] were 3.4 and 6.0 meq/l. In acetazolamide-treated dogs, during metabolic alkalosis, increments in CSF [HCO3-] (4.8 and 7.2 meq/l, respectively, at 2.5 and 5 h) and decrements in CSF [Cl-] (9.1 and 13.3 meq/l) were greater than those observed in group I. We conclude that, in dogs with metabolic alkalosis and bilateral ligation of renal pedicles, acetazolamide impairs CSF regulation of HCO3- and Cl- ions; acetazolamide not only failed to impede HCO3- rise but actually appeared to increase it. The mechanisms for these observations are discussed.\r"

Using a method which allows localized exposure of the peripheral lung to antigen, we investigated the role of locally released thromboxane A2 (TxA2) in the immediate response of collateral airways to aerosolized antigen. In dogs with native sensitivity to Ascaris suum antigen, resistance to flow through the collateral system (Rcs) was measured using a wedged bronchoscope technique. Local administration of antigen aerosol (25 microliters, 1:10,000 dilution) produced a gradual increase in Rcs which reached a maximum of 365% of base line in 4-8 min. Analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from the exposed segment at the peak of the response demonstrated significantly more TxB2 compared with control lavage samples (41.8 +/- 7.8 pg/ml vs. 27.9 +/- 8.3; P less than 0.025). After inhibition of thromboxane synthase with UK-37,248 (3 mg/kg iv) or OKY-046 (5 mg/kg iv), the increase in Rcs was significantly reduced at 40 s (P less than 0.001) and 2 min (P less than 0.01) after antigen delivery, and the maximal increase was attenuated by 41% (P less than 0.005). In contrast, the magnitude and time course of the airway response to aerosols of a stable thromboxane analog (U-46619) were not affected by blockade. Despite a similar attenuation (42%) of the maximal increase in Rcs by sodium meclofenamate (3 mg/kg iv), this cyclooxygenase inhibitor had no effect on the time course of the antigenic response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In healthy subjects breathing spontaneously at rest, we measured the deposition fraction (DF) of a 2.6-microns monodisperse aerosol by Tyndallometry while simultaneous measurement of VT and f were made. Under these conditions particle deposition occurs primarily in the peripheral air spaces of the lung. As an index of peripheral air-space size, we used measurements of aerosol recovery (RC) as a function of breath-hold time (t) (Gebhart et al. J. Appl. Physiol. 51: 465-476, 1981). In each subject, we measured RC (aerosol expired/aerosol inspired) of a 1.0-micron monodisperse aerosol as a function of breath-hold time for inspiratory capacity breaths of aerosol. The half time (t1/2) (the breath-hold time to reach 50% RC with no breath hold) is proportional to a mean diameter (D) of air spaces filled with aerosol. In the 10 subjects studied, we found a variable DF, range 0.04-0.44 [0.25 +/- 0.12 (SD)]. DF correlated most closely with 1/f, or the period of breathing (r = 0.96, P less than 0.01). There was no significant correlation between DF and t1/2 as an index of peripheral air-space size. In fact there was little deviation in t1/2 in these normal subjects [coefficient of variation (CV) = 0.12].(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The original state, in which the relaxed joint is unexpectedly stiff, is restored by several seconds of inactivity. This thixotropic phenomenon has previously been observed in a variety of human joints. We have now investigated the mechanism of thixotropic behavior at relaxed joints in rats anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium, by using a series of preparations including the intact ankle joint, a blood-perfused soleus muscle preparation, an isolated soleus muscle, and ankle joint isolated by severing all muscular attachments. Thixotropic behavior was observed in all intact, isolated muscle, and isolated joint preparations. The contribution of the joint to thixotropic behavior was comparable to, and at times exceeded, the contribution of muscle. We also analyzed the short-range stiffness properties of relaxed, blood-perfused soleus muscles and found them to be similar to thixotropy with respect to range of action (0.2-0.3% of muscle length), elastic modulus (approximately 4 kg/cm2), and time course for redevelopment (time constant = 2.5 s at 34 degrees C). Thus thixotropic behavior at a relaxed joint may be attributed both to the joint structures and to short-range stiffness of muscles acting at the joint.\r"

During inflation and deflation the changes in pulmonary arterial pressure were primarily due to changes in the resistance of the alveolar vessels. At equal Palv (9.9 mmHg), delta Pm was 10.3 +/- 1.2 mmHg during deflation compared with 6.8 +/- 1.1 mmHg during inflation. At equal lung volume, delta Pm was 10.2 +/- 1.5 mmHg during inflation (Palv = 13.8 mmHg) and 5.0 +/- 0.7 mmHg during deflation (Palv = 4.8 mmHg). These measurements suggest that the alveolar pressure was transmitted more effectively to the alveolar vessels during deflation due to a lower alveolar surface tension. It was estimated that at midlung volume, the perimicrovascular pressure was 3.5-3.8 mmHg greater during deflation than during inflation.\r"

  ".W": "Several types of cold adaptation in men have been described in the literature (metabolic, insulative, hypothermic). The aim of this study is to show that the decrease of heat debt can be considered as a new index for cold adaptation. Ten male subjects were acclimated by water immersions (temperature 10-15 degrees C, 4 immersions/wk over 2 mo). Thermoregulatory responses before and after acclimation were tested by a standard cold test in a climatic chamber for 2 h at rest [dry bulb temperature (Tdb): 10 degrees C; relative humidity (rh): 25%]. After adaptation, four thermoregulatory modifications were observed: an increase in the delay for the onset of shivering (32.7 +/- 7.99 instead of 14.1 +/- 5.25 min); a decrease of body temperature levels for the onset of shivering [rectal temperature (Tre): 37.06 +/- 0.08 instead of 37.31 +/- 0.06 degrees C; mean skin temperature (Tsk): 24.83 +/- 0.56 instead of 26.86 +/- 0.46 degrees C; mean body temperature (Tb): 33.03 +/- 0.20 instead of 34.16 +/- 0.37 degrees C); a lower level of body temperatures in thermoneutrality (Tre = 37.16 +/- 0.08 instead of 37.39 +/- 0.06 degrees C; Tsk = 31.29 +/- 0.21 instead of 32.01 +/- 0.22 degrees C; Tb = 35.92 +/- 0.08 instead of 36.22 +/- 0.05 degrees C); a decrease of heat debt calculated from the difference between heat gains and heat losses (5.66 +/- 0.08 instead of 8.33 +/- 0.38 kJ/kg). The different types of cold adaptation observed are related to the physical characteristics of the subjects (percent body fat content) and the level of physical fitness (VO2max).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Inert gas narcotics increase intrinsic pressure tolerance (1,000Pc) in CD-1 mice but interfere with development of the protective responses raising seizure thresholds during slower compression (e.g., 60Pc). This secondary narcotic effect can block up to 40% of the total attainable increase in Pc. The narcosis susceptible moiety of this compression rate effect develops early, whereas a narcosis resistant remnant accounts for increase in Pc occurring after 90 min of compression or pressure exposure. Pressure conditioning by multiday pressure exposure entails increases in both 60Pc and 1,000Pc and in virtual annullment of the compression rate effect. The effect can be completely blocked by narcotic gases in the conditioning atmosphere. In addition to blocking part of the compression rate effect the presence of narcotic gases under these conditions can reverse the effects of previously established pressure conditioning. 60Pc regresses much more slowly under these conditions than 1,000Pc. Either reversal rate is much more rapid in air at 1 ATA than at 80 ATA under 0.9 atm N2O. The implications of these data are discussed with regard to evaluation of the hypothesis of antagonism between inert gas narcotics and high pressures and to elaboration of the monoamine hypothesis to account for the modification of the compression rate effect by narcotic gases.\r"

  ".W": "First-breath ventilatory responses to graded elastic and resistive loads were obtained from 15 people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), 5 people with facioscapulohumeral MD (FSH), 3 people with Becker MD, and 3 people with limb-girdle MD. For each load tidal volumes from different individuals ranged from relatively small to comparatively large values, indicating a correspondingly wide range of end-inspiratory efforts; strong tidal volume defenders generally employed longer inspirations and higher mean inspiratory airflows than did weak tidal volume defenders; and individual frequency responses were mediated by changes in inspiratory and/or expiratory timing. Thus the loaded breathing responses of people with MD are qualitatively the same as those of quadriplegic and able-bodied people. Quantitatively, however, the DMD group generated considerably larger tidal volumes than did the FSH group during both elastic and resistive loading. These larger tidal volumes were achieved by both longer inspirations (a neurally mediated phenomenon) and higher mean inspiratory airflows (a mechanically and/or neurally mediated phenomenon). These findings, which could not be attributed to differences in respiratory motor function, suggest that there are differences between the respiratory sensory and/or central functions in the Duchenne and facioscapulohumeral types of MD.\r"
