Although the female-to-male ratio remained constant at 1.5:1, a high-risk group emerged, consisting of male patients with admitted homosexuality, bisexuality, or a history of anal condylomata acuminata. During the earliest period, 8 percent of male patients were in this group; this subset rose to 72 percent during the latest period (P less than .05). While the number of anal margin cancers has decreased, there has been a steady rise in the number of anal canal and in situ carcinomas, especially in the high-risk group.\r"

  ".W": "This investigation was based on an epidemiologic association of milk consumption and decreased intestinal cancer risk. Furthermore, there is also some indirect evidence that calcium supplementation in humans and animals may decrease colon cancer risk and that calcium, by inference, may be the protective factor in milk. In order to investigate these associations in a controlled laboratory setting, dietary supplementation of low fat dried milk (37 g/kg diet; N = 18) and calcium carbonate (40 mg/kg rat/day; N = 17) were compared separately to regular diet controls in the rat-dimethylhydrazine colon carcinogenesis model. The results of this investigation showed that neither milk-supplemented rats nor calcium carbonate-supplemented rats had fewer DMH-induced colorectal (P = .374) or total gastrointestinal tumors (P = .291) than did regular diet controls (N = 10; by analysis of variance [ANOVA]). Milk supplementation did result in a significant decrease in tumor burden when measured by incidence of metastases (P = .035) and of intestinal obstruction (P = .011; by chi-square test), when compared with calcium-supplemented and control rats. Though this implies that milk supplementation provides protection against some aspects of carcinogenesis of the colon, in rats fed low fat diets, this does not appear to be mediated through the calcium content of milk.\r"

Of the 72 adenocarcinomas, 26 percent were mucinous. Only 17 percent of patients presented with symptoms of radiation proctitis, and the mean radiation dosages were not high. High radiation dosage and severe radiation damage may not be essential for radiation-associated colorectal cancer. The overall five-year survival rate was 48 percent. Close surveillance of the colon and anorectal regions of these high-risk patients at five years after irradiation is indicated.\r"

For the intravenous study, subjects were given placebo or 10 mg cisapride randomly, while in the oral study, they randomly received placebo or cisapride at 5, 10, or 20 mg. Cisapride given intravenously or orally caused a significant increase in resting LES pressure. The increase in LES pressure after oral administration was significant only after the 20 mg dose. Esophageal-body peristaltic amplitude, determined for all smooth-muscle sites, showed a modest but significant increase of approximately 10 mm Hg after intravenous cisapride, whereas no significant increase occurred after oral cisapride. Propagation time of peristalsis was unaffected by intravenous or oral cisapride. Side effects of treatment were minimal and at no time necessitated cessation of the study. We conclude that in healthy subjects during the late fed period, (1) cisapride at 10 mg intravenously or 20 mg orally increased resting LES pressure and (2) at 10 mg intravenously, but at no oral dose, cisapride increased peristaltic amplitude without affecting propagation time. The potentiating effect of cisapride on LES pressure suggests that cisapride could have an ancillary role in the therapy of gastroesophageal reflux disease.\r"

Also, the gallbladder emptying responses to equivalent multicomponent solid and liquid meals were compared. Significant gallbladder emptying was observed in response to the multicomponent meal and the monocomponent fat, carbohydrate, and protein meals. The most rapid and complete gallbladder emptying was seen with the multicomponent meal and the monocomponent fat meal. Significant gallbladder emptying was stimulated, not only by isotonic and hypertonic dextrose, but also by hypertonic saline. The gallbladder emptied more rapidly after a liquid than after a solid meal.\r"

The aim of this study was to assess the human basophil degranulation (HBD) test with hydatic antigen in 100 patients. Seventy patients were clinically suspected of having liver hydatidosis (LH) (group I). Eight patients had asymptomatic hepatic calcifications. Twenty-two patients had previous surgery for LH (group III). In group I the percentage of HBD was significantly higher in patients with LH (23 of 70) than in patients with other hepatobiliary diseases (P less than 0.001). In group II all patients had negative HBD tests. In group III the test became negative within 8-12 months after radical surgery in four patients, and remained positive in the other 18. These results suggest that the HBD test is useful for the diagnosis of LH. In asymptomatic patients with hepatic calcified cyst, a negative HBD test suggests a dead parasite. In previously operated patients, a positive test suggests persistence of antigen.\r"

Individual variables which proved significant (P less than 0.01) included age at presentation to the clinic, serum albumin, sedimentation rate, and the presence of radiologic strictures. Patients eventually requiring surgery were older than the rest because of a later date of symptom onset; furthermore, patients with strictures on initial x-rays had not been ill for a longer period of time than those who did not have strictures. These data suggest that fibrosis and stenosis are characteristic of a subgroup of Crohn's patients, rather than being inevitable phases of disease evolution. Multivariate analysis revealed that patients with low serum albumin, high sedimentation rate, and roentgenologic stenosis at first observation were ten times as likely to require surgery for obstruction at 10 years than those without any of these three unfavorable parameters.\r"

  ".W": "An important histologic feature of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is infiltration of the colonic mucosa with neutrophils. To investigate the nature of the chemotactic agents responsible for this infiltration, colonic mucosa from three normals and nine patients with inflammatory bowel disease (seven ulcerative colitis, two Crohn's colitis) was assayed for chemotactic activity for human neutrophils in vitro in a Boyden chamber. There was more (greater than 10-fold more) chemotactic activity in homogenates of inflammatory bowel disease mucosa than in homogenates of normal colonic mucosa. Analysis of the chemotactic activity in the inflammatory bowel disease mucosa revealed that most was lipid extractable. Moreover, when the lipid extract was fractionated by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography, the only fraction with significant chemotactic activity was the fraction that coeluted with leukotriene B4. The chemotactic response to IBD mucosa was blocked by anti-LTB4 antisera. The amount of chemotactic activity in lipid extracts of different inflammatory bowel disease specimens correlated well with the concentration of leukotriene B4 measured by UV absorbance (250 ng/g of mucosa). These data suggest that leukotriene B4 is an important stimulus to neutrophil chemotaxis in inflammatory bowel disease and, thus, may play a major role in the amplification of the inflammatory response in this condition.\r"

Two enzymatic antioxidants, superoxide dismutase or catalase injected intravenously, reduced mucosal damage either by ethanol or aspirin. Of six nonenzymatic antioxidants, given in a wide dose range subcutaneously 30 min before intragastric administration of absolute ethanol, only propyl gallate decreased mucosal damage, while four of the antioxidants tested against aspirin were protective. These nonenzymatic antioxidants were antisecretory in the pylorus-ligated rat. The concentration of conjugated dienes and malondialdehyde measured in the gastric mucosa shortly after ethanol or aspirin administration remained unchanged or slightly decreased. These results indicate that free radicals may be involved in the pathogenesis of acute gastric mucosal injury caused by chemicals, but their mechanisms of action probably does not involve lipid peroxidation.\r"

A single dose of 938 cGy to the intestine of dogs consistently produced an acute intestinal radiation syndrome consisting of vomiting and diarrhea but was not lethal. In the fasting state, the migrating myoelectric complex was uniformly interrupted. After a meal, jejunal myoelectric activity analyzed by a computer program showed a progressive decline in the number, duration, and length of migration of spike bursts. There were occasionally bizarre motility patterns consisting of clusters of migrating spike bursts. Slow waves demonstrated irregular rhythm and nonuniform morphology. They occasionally migrated in an orad direction and at times were totally uncoupled. At 24 hr and four days after irradiation, the muscle and the neural plexus were nearly normal by light microscopy, but the mucosa exhibited severe necrosis. Therefore, irradiation produces profound functional abnormalities in intestinal muscle even though the morphology is minimally altered.\r"

Rats fed regular cellulose developed a total of 16 tumors, nine in the small bowel and seven in the large bowel. In this group colonic tumors were large and invasive; 75% were carcinomas. Rats fed very high concentrations of cellulose had only four tumors, noninvasive and localized to the small intestine. Large bowels of rats fed high cellulose were completely devoid of neoplasms. This study suggests that very high concentrations of cellulose may suppress the development of large bowel tumors in rats. This could have significant implications concerning dietary protection against colon carcinogenesis.\r"

Therefore, reports which ascribed a hepatocellular carcinoma to non-A, non-B hepatitis but did not examine the tumor for HBV DNA are open to question. We describe a case of chronic active hepatitis with primary hepatocellular carcinoma that lacked HBV DNA in the tumor, the nontumorous liver tissue, and serum. The individual lacked all serological markers for HBV infection. This report more fairly supports the association between hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic hepatitis not due to hepatitis B.

  ".W": "The temporal relationship between the degree of photosensitivity and the intensity of kindling stimulus response was examined in four Senegalese baboons, Papio papio, kindled at the premotor cortical area. When fully kindled, the intensity of photosensitivity diminished significantly in all the animals. With successive daily intermittent light stimulation, two animals showed partial recovery and the other two showed complete recovery to the prekindling level of photosensitivity. When premotor cortical kindling stimulation was subsequently reapplied, three-quarters of the animals failed to respond with kindled seizures and additional stimulations were necessary to reestablish kindled seizure. Two of these three animals also required increased stimulus intensity before the previously established generalized seizure threshold could be reinstated. The frontorolandic cortex is known as the most epileptogenic area in photosensitive Papio papio. In this species, spontaneous generalized convulsive seizures, intermittent light stimulation-induced seizures, and kindled generalized convulsive seizures are all known to share a common electroclinical phenomenology. The reciprocal inhibition observed in this study between generalized seizures induced by either intermittent light stimulation or by premotor cortical kindling stimulation further strengthens the possibility that they also share a common neuronal mechanism.\r"

Chemitrodes were implanted in the amygdala (AM), hippocampus (HIPP), or caudate nucleus (CN) of Long-Evans rats and electrically stimulated once daily until fully generalized seizures appeared (i.e., kindled). Once kindled, various doses (0.001-0.5 microgram/0.5 microliter) of the adenosine analogs, L-phenylisopropyladenosine (L-PIA), N-ethylcarboximidoadenosine (NECA) or vehicle were injected into the seizure focus 5 min prior to electrical stimulation. The afterdischarge (AD) and behavioral seizure stages were measured. L-PIA had potent anticonvulsant effects when injected directly into the kindled seizure focus in the AM, HIPP, or CN. NECA effects were statistically significant only in CN-kindled seizures. The regional differences in efficacy of the two adenosine analogs suggest that L-PIA, an A1 adenosine subtype agonist, may exert its effects through A1 adenosine receptors in the AM, HIPP, and CN, where A1 binding has been demonstrated, whereas NECA, an A2 adenosine receptor agonist, may only be maximally effective in the CN where A2 adenosine binding sites are located.\r"

To test the usefulness as a model for the evaluation of anticonvulsant drugs, the effects of phenobarbital (PB) and phenytoin (PHT) on photosensitivity were studied in the GL-kindled cat under DL-allylglycine. PB (5 and 10 mg/kg intravenously, i.v.) completely suppressed photically induced seizures in most subjects at plasma concentrations of 7-16 micrograms/ml, and this anticonvulsant action persisted for at least 4 h after the injection. PHT (15 mg/kg, i.v.) at plasma concentrations of 9-15 micrograms/ml produced toxic signs, e.g., pupil dilatation, hypersalivation, and tachypnea. At this dose, PHT was inactive against photically induced myoclonus but prevented the elicitation of a generalized tonic-clonic convulsion. From these results showing that the effects of anticonvulsant drugs on photically induced seizures can be assessed in relation to plasma concentration and acute neurologic toxicity, we suggest that the GL-kindled cat is a potentially useful animal model of epilepsy for testing the efficacy of anticonvulsant drugs.\r"

Intravenous administration of 10-40 mg/kg ZNS significantly depresses descending excitatory mechanisms, as well as segmental and descending inhibitory mechanisms, but has only a minor effect on segmental excitatory mechanisms. This spectrum of activity is similar to that of valproate, and suggests that ZNS should also be a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug. In agreement with our experimental observations, it has been found that ZNS is effective against complex partial, generalized tonic clonic, and myoclonic seizures. The antiepileptic profile of ZNS in conventional screening tests resembles that of carbamazepine (CBZ) and phenytoin. However, CBZ exacerbates rather than prevents myoclonic seizures. Our experimental model thus provides a more accurate prediction of ZNS's clinical spectrum of activity. The relationship of these findings to the mechanism of action of antiepileptic drugs is discussed.\r"

Therefore, it may be used to measure concentrations of these drugs in small blood samples, such as obtained by skin puncture and capillary tube collection.

Seralyzer results were compared with serum values from venous blood determined with a gas chromatographic (GC) method.

Compounds such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, and probably valproate act by modifying ionic conductances, particularly sodium and calcium, in excitable membranes, thus limiting sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. In contrast, barbiturates and benzodiazepines tend to affect gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) mediation of the chloride channel opening. Knowledge of drug mechanisms is important for choosing the proper drug for various seizures types. In addition, an understanding of antiepileptic drug pharmacokinetics, nontherapeutic effects, and interactions is essential for optimal therapy. The lack of uniform pharmacokinetics among patients and among different formulations of a drug can make it difficult to arrive at uniform criteria for both seizure control and determinations of toxicity. both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions can occur between antiepileptic medications and other drugs. Three major types of side effects with anticonvulsants can be identified: dose-related alterations of neurologic function, idiosyncratic reactions, and nonidiosyncratic function, idiosyncratic reactions, and nonidiosyncratic direct actions on other organ systems. These effects often compromise treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Appropriate use of carbamazepine for the treatment of epilepsy is based on correct identification of the patient's seizure type. Carbamazepine is effective against partial seizures and against generalized tonic clonic seizures. Therapy should begin gradually, with initial doses increased slowly over 1 or 2 weeks, as tolerated. Side effects include fatigue, dizziness, ataxia, double vision, nausea, and vomiting. Most practitioners agree that, because of carbamazepine's relatively short half-life, the total dosage should be administered in at least two divided doses. This avoids too high a peak blood level that would occur with a single dose. Carbamazepine therapy is associated with the development of two hematologic conditions. Leukopenia, which may be transient or persistent, requires careful monitoring but is not cause for immediate discontinuation of therapy. Aplastic anemia occurs rarely but is potentially fatal, and therefore diligent monitoring of hematologic function is indicated. Aplastic anemia is an idiosyncratic, non-dose-related side effect that is most likely to occur within the first 3 or 4 months of initiating therapy. Once seizures are controlled, plasma levels of carbamazepine should be measured to establish optimum levels for individual patients being treated with this drug.\r"

Paradoxically, these developments have not simplified the task of matching the appropriate antiepileptic drug to a particular seizure type. It is reasonable to assume that anticonvulsant drugs will have different effects on different types of seizures, but faulty, circular reasoning can enter the picture if one also assumes that responses of seizures to different drugs signify different seizure types. There are several examples of differential diagnoses that can fall prey to this problem, including the diagnosis between partial seizures with secondary generalization and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and the diagnosis between complex partial seizures and absence seizures with automatisms, among others. Considerations of etiology in future classification systems can further complicate the problem: should one then choose an anticonvulsant drug on the basis of individual seizure type or on the basis of the type of epilepsy? Ramifications of this issue extend even to the drug approval process. Official sanction is not given for use of a drug for a seizure type not included in the original efficacy studies, even if later scientific evidence shows that seizure type to be related to a type that is included. New trials must be undertaken. These problems arise from how we choose to classify seizures.\r"

This allows the concepts of random and potential continuity to be introduced, providing norms against which the achieved levels of actual continuity can be rated. The results show that the actual physician continuity, although not particularly high, was considerably higher than what could be expected according to chance alone (random continuity). Moreover, actual continuity did appear to increase after the organizational changes were implemented--absolutely as well as in relation to potential continuity. The importance of reducing the mobility of physicians is emphasized in order to further improve the situation.\r"

The supplementary information provided on nutrition and smoking caused a large proportion of them to claim they had changed to a more healthy life-style after the screening test. Those who were under the impression that they had led healthy lives but were still found to have an 'abnormality' were often very astonished and sometimes worried about the result. The men without 'abnormalities' did not lead significantly healthier lives than the rest in terms of exercise, smoking, diet and so on; for them the result might have a 'certificate of health' effect justifying their not always healthy behaviour.\r"

Owing to the prevalence of psychosocial problems in primary care, a screening genogram that is administered to patients routinely may have a significant impact on the care provided by clinicians. A randomized controlled trial was conducted to determine the influence of screening genograms on patients' initial visits to primary care physicians. The genograms captured more information about family structure, major life events, repetitive illnesses, and family relationships than did the physicians on their own. Nevertheless, the experimental and control groups were no different on the dependent variables: physician exploration of family issues, request for interviews with other family members and counseling or referral because of emotional problems. Although the power of the study alone could account for the lack of significant results, several other methodological issues, especially contamination of the control group, could have contributed to the negative results. The results of this study are similar to those of other psychosocial screening studies using similar designs. Hence, additional studies using alternative research protocols are indicated before rejecting the usefulness of screening genograms in primary care.\r"

The volume of the secretion and the output of enzymes in response to CCK under an infusion of secretin, however, remained unchanged although the functional capacity of individual cells to secret amylase and lipase was reduced.

In contrast, bombesin, substance P, and carbachol, factors which interact with separate receptors, and stimulate pancreatic secretion similarly to CCK by mobilising intracellular Ca2+, did not have any effect on the growth of pancreatic acinar cells in vitro. These results suggest both a unique role for cholecystokinin in the physiological regulation of the pancreas and that the mechanisms that mediate the trophic effects of cholecystokinin are different from those that mediate secretion.\r"

Stages of tumour genesis in the transgenic mouse model from hyperplasia to neoplasia, have been compared with human B-cell tumours. A normal complement of peptide containing cells was seen in the transgenic mouse pancreas, but cells containing pro-insulin-derived peptides became more numerous as hyperplasia commenced. The transgenic mouse tumours were composed of B cells, although 30-35% of the tumours were also found to contain PP cells--a finding which is directly comparable with that in human insulin-producing tumours. NSE, 7B2 and chromogranin immunoreactivities were found in most cells from all the tumours examined. Antisera to PGP 9.5, a novel marker for elements of the neuroendocrine system, were found to stain hyperplastic and neoplastic B-cells intensely. In contrast, normal mouse B-cells did not show PGP 9.5 immunoreactivity thus it appears that PGP 9.5 is differentially expressed in transformed and/or growing mouse B-cells and hence may be used as an indicator in studies of early tumour growth.\r"

Its significance for the process of migration and differentiation of the epithelial cells remains to be resolved. It consists of a basement membrane, the anchoring zone and the subepithelial connective tissue, the origin of which is unknown. We therefore established an in vitro model to study the development of the endodermal-mesenchymal interface of the fetal human and murine intestinal mucosa. The distribution of the interstitial collagens type I, III, VI and procollagen type III as well as the basement membrane components collagen type IV and laminin was investigated immunohistochemically in these fetal explant cultures. The cultures were also adapted to serum free culture conditions. It was evident that while laminin and collagen type IV could be detected in the primary intestinal epithelium, the formation of an authentic basement membrane required the presence of both the epithelial and the mesenchymal cells. Interstitial collagens and procollagen type III were produced exclusively by the mesenchymal cells. Basement membrane formation in vitro coincided with cytodifferentiation of the endodermal cells as betrayed by electron microscopy and the activity of brush border enzymes. In conclusion, the maturation of the endoderm and the formation of the subepithelial basement membrane require the intimate proximity of viable mesenchyme in vitro.\r"

Immunofluorescence revealed the presence of collagens type III, IV, and VI and procollagens type I and III as well as fibronectin, laminin and undulin. Primary crypt cells of suckling mice displayed a significantly increased affinity to pepsin and collagenase solubilised intestinal biomatrix when compared with plastic and fibronectin. Colonies of primary crypt cells survived for up to four days and longer on pepsin solubilised biomatrix but only for 48 hours on fibronectin.

We used this experimental model to characterise mechanisms, which may occur under similar conditions in man (stagnant loop syndrome). Epithelial and subepithelial resistance were measured in the Ussing-chamber by voltage divider ratio measurements after positioning a microelectrode between epithelium and subepithelial tissue layers. In the blind loop, epithelial resistance increased from 8 +/- 1 to 23 +/- 1 omega cm2 and subepithelial resistance from 39 +/- 4 to 86 +/- 8 omega cm2 as compared with control jejunum. The increase in the subepithelial resistance was paralleled anatomically by an increase in the thickness of the subepithelial tissue layers from 63 +/- 4 microns to 177 +/- 19 microns. Ultrastructural analysis of the tight junction area by freeze fracture electron microscopy revealed an increase in the total junctional 'depth' in the crypts from 243 +/- 9 nm in control jejunum to 396 +/- 17 nm in the blind loop, while the number of horizontally oriented 'strands' remained unchanged. Villus tight junctions did not differ between blind loop and control. We interpret the alterations in the self-filling blind loop as an adaptive response of the epithelium which reduces backleakage of already absorbed electrolytes across the tight junction into the intestinal lumen. This mechanism is suitable to support the intestine in maintaining body electrolyte and water contents during cellular electrolyte malabsorption.\r"

Because cells producing enteroglucagon are located mainly in the distal small bowel (and colon), ileal resection might be expected to produce less adaptive change than a jejunal resection of equivalent length. This hypothesis was tested in male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 40) weighing 184.0 +/- 7.3 g and receiving a Thiry-Vella fistula (TVF) of the mid-60% of the small intestine. One group had concomitant resection of the jejunum proximal to the TVF (n = 12), another had resection of the ileum distal to the TVF (n = 13), while controls had a TVF alone (n = 15). When killed 10 days postoperatively rats with ileal resection weighed only 81% of controls (p less than 0.001) and 85% of those with jejunal resection (p less than 0.01). Jejunal resection produced an 81% increase in crypt cell production rate (measured by a stathmokinetic technique) over control values (28.5 +/- 4.2 v 15.8 +/- 2.3 cells/crypt/h: p = 0.025), whereas ileal resection had no demonstrable effect (17.5 +/- 2.3 cells/crypt/h). Adaptive hyperplasia in isolated small bowel is modulated by factors localised to the distal small intestine, enteroglucagon being a plausible candidate.\r"

Studies of intestinal adaptation could be much more informative if a valid measure of intestinal function could also be included. One such method is the water absorption capacity. The CCPR of the jejunum and intestinal water absorption were measured in 19 groups of hypo and hyperproliferative rats which were in a 'steady state' of cell production and turnover. The minimum values were obtained after hypophysectomy and the maximum values were observed in lactation. Crypt cell production rate and absorption were significantly correlated (p less than 0.001) to each other. There was a significant (p less than 0.001) correlation between both CCPR and absorption and dry weight of the intestinal segment studies and food intake. Body weight was a poor predictor of either CCPR or absorption. The combined study of CCPR and water absorption is thus a practical and convenient approach to the study of intestinal cell proliferation and intestinal adaptation.\r"

In another experiment, neurotensin (836 pmol/kg) was injected intraperitoneally three times a day for three days in 12 rats. Thereafter, pancreatic DNA and in vitro incorporation of 3H-thymidine into pancreatic DNA was determined. Long term infusion of 282 pmol/kg neurotensin induced an increase of pancreatic weight, DNA, and pancreatic polypeptide, whereas pancreatic protein, RNA, amylase and lipase contents were not increased. In relation to DNA, even these parameters were significantly depressed. Insulin remained unchanged. Neurotensin, therefore, caused hyperplasia of the pancreas. Intraperitoneal injection of neurotensin induced an increase of pancreatic DNA content and stimulated 3H-thymidine incorporation into DNA, whereas caerulein only augmented 3H-thymidine incorporation. Moreover, long term neurotensin infusion led to a rise in protein concentration and an increase in the thickness of the gastric antrum; antral DNA concentration was insignificantly stimulated. Neurotensin, therefore, can act as a trophic factor on pancreas and gastric antrum of the rat.\r"

The tendency to undergo malignant change is augmented by the additional use of a genotoxic carcinogen such as azaserine. The present study has sought to examine the reversibility of the focal neoplastic change in the pancreas. Rats fed RSF for 24 weeks and then given a diet not containing soya flour (NSC) had a normal pancreas when killed after 60 weeks of study. When RSF was fed for only 36 weeks, however, some of the rats developed pancreatic cancer even though the diet had been switched to NSC. Similarly, while azaserine in the dose used in the present study does not produce pancreatic cancer in our strain of Wistar rats, coincident administration of RSF for 12 weeks (but not for six weeks) resulted in progression to pancreatic adenoma. Although change from RSF to NSC after 30 weeks resulted in rapid reduction in pancreatic weight and content of RNA, neoplastic foci persisted and became frankly malignant. We conclude that phenotypic reversion to normal of the RSF diet- and azaserine-treated rat pancreas is only possible if RSF alone is fed continuously for not more than about 24 weeks or six weeks if the rats have been exposed to a pancreatic initiating carcinogen.\r"

We assessed their action in rats by morphometric evaluation of enteroendocrine cells after heterotopic accessory small bowel transplantation (SBT), in which the graft is shunted off from the intestinal passage and is entirely deprived of neural connections, and after orthotopic SBT with normal intestinal passage. Sections of the jejunum and the ileum of the graft were immunostained with antibodies to cholecystokinin (CKK), neurotensin (NT) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). The amount and distribution of positive cells was assessed semiquantitatively. Three weeks after SBT in the heterotopic graft there was a marked decrease in CCK and NT positive cells and VIP positive fibres in the entire organ, compared with the controls. Histological examination revealed that villi and crypts had atrophied. After orthotopic SBT the number of CCK and NT positive cells increased and exceeded normal values by 20-40%. VIP positive fibres did not reach normal amounts. No mucosal atrophy was detected. These findings support the view that the intrinsic neurohormonal system is reestablished in the grafted small bowel and that enteroendocrine regulatory peptides may act as trophic factors that are responsible for adaptation after SBT.\r"

Little effect on CCPR was seen when inert bulk (kaolin) was added to the 'elemental' diet. Addition of a poorly fermentable dietary 'fibre' (purified wood cellulose) had little effect on intestinal epithelial cell proliferation except in the distal colon where it significantly increased CCPR. A more readily fermentable 'fibre' (purified wheat bran) caused a large proliferative response in the proximal, mid and distal colon and in the distal small intestine. A gel forming 'fibre' also stimulated proliferation in the distal colon. There was no significant correlation between CCPR and plasma gastrin concentrations, but plasma enteroglucagon concentrations were significantly correlated with CCPR in almost all the sites studied. Plasma PYY concentrations also showed some correlation with CCPR, especially in the colon. Thus, whilst inert bulk cannot stimulate colonic epithelial cell proliferation, fermentable 'fibre' is capable of stimulating proliferation in the colon, and especially in the distal colon: it can also stimulate proliferation in the distal small intestine and it is likely that plasma enteroglucagon may have a role to play in this process.\r"

In the first part of the study animals were fed an elemental liquid diet for 10 days and then killed, and the growth of the oxyntic gland area of the stomach, 2 cm segments of duodenum and pancreatic tissue was determined. Feeding an elemental diet caused a decrease in organ weight, nucleic acid contents and serum gastrin level. Subsequent addition of pentagastrin prevented this reduction in organ weight and RNA and DNA contents while somatostatin failed to affect the decrease in growth parameters or serum gastrin level in tests with or without addition of pentagastrin. In a second part of the study, sham operated and antrectomised rats were used. Antrectomy caused a significant decrease in serum gastrin concentration and resulted in a significant reduction in the weight and RNA and DNA contents of the tissue tested. As in liquid diet, subsequent administration of pentagastrin prevented the reduction in the growth parameters both in tests with and without somatostatin. These results suggest that somatostatin inhibits the growth of the gastroduodenal mucosa by a mechanism involving, at least in part, the suppression of gastrin release.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the role of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions on intestinal maturation, we cultured embryonic epithelial cells in several experimental conditions. Microexplants of 14-15 days fetal rat intestinal endoderm, separated from the mesenchyme by collagenase, were seeded on dishes coated with different extracellular matrix components (collagens I, III, IV, fibronectin, laminin) or on confluent monolayers of intestinal mesenchymal cells or of fetal skin fibroblasts. Only small variations in the attachment or spreading of the endodermal cells could be observed when they were cultured on the different substrata and their survival never exceeded one week. When cocultured with intestinal or skin fibroblasts, however, endodermal cells grew, formed a monolayer, survival time was prolonged up to two to three weeks, and differentiation occurred. This differentiation was assessed by cell polarisation, morphological maturation of apical brush borders, synthesis of microvillar digestive enzymes and of extracellular matrix molecules seen immunocytochemically. Finally, glucocorticoids which are known to stimulate or induce brush border enzymes, accelerated the morphological and enzymatic maturation only in the cocultures.\r"

At the time of death at 24 hours, one week and two weeks postoperative, stimulation of DNA synthesis in the 3T3 cells was noted after incubation with platelet free plasma from the C-op and R groups, and simultaneously an increase in ileal DNA specific activity occurred. Characterisation of the plasma fraction with growth factor activity revealed it to have a MW of greater than 6,000 and less than 14,000 d. The factor(s) was resistant to reduction with DTT, and was partially inactivated by heating to 60 degrees C.

  ".W": "The effect of jejunal bypass on pancreatic growth and plasma cholecystokinin (CCK) was investigated in rats. Rats underwent bypass of jejunum or sham operation. Rats with jejunal bypass were further divided into three groups; one group received a continuous infusion of a partially hydrolysed liquid diet (Vital) into the bypassed jejunum; a second group received the nutrient solution mixed with trypsin and infused into the bypassed jejunum; the third bypass group did not receive infusion of nutrient or trypsin into the jejunum. Jejunal bypass alone did not significantly stimulate pancreatic growth or DNA content at one or two weeks postoperative. Infusion of nutrient solution into the bypassed jejunum stimulated pancreatic growth and DNA content, with maximal increases of 185% and 181% for pancreatic weight and DNA content, respectively, at two weeks. This coincided with significant increases in postabsorptive plasma CCK concentrations. Infusion of pancreatic proteases into the bypassed jejunum partially reversed the effects of nutrient infusion. These results suggest that exclusion of bile-pancreatic juice or pancreatic proteases from the jejunum does not lead to maximal release of CCK unless the jejunum receives luminal nutrients. It is proposed that CCK release from rat jejunum occurs spontaneously in the absence of pancreatic proteases, and that luminal nutrients in bypassed jejunum increase plasma CCK and stimulate pancreatic growth by maintaining synthesis of CCK.\r"

Intestinal enzyme concentrations were therefore studied in rats fed RSF for from one hour to 400 days to determine whether free trypsin concentrations were depressed during the period of pancreatic growth (up to six to eight weeks after starting RSF). Intestinal levels of enzymes were raised from one hour after starting the diet up to 400 days, indicating that stimulation of pancreatic secretion continued for as long as this diet was fed. Free trypsin concentrations were, however depressed only for the first 12 hours. It seems unlikely, therefore, that lowered free trypsin concentrations alone stimulate the release of CCK in these animals.\r"

This study was undertaken to investigate the effects of chronic pancreaticobiliary diversion on pancreatic morphology as well as the circulating concentrations of pancreatic polypeptide, secretin, gastrin, and CCK. Fifteen month diversion provoked 73 and 86% increases in pancreatic weight and volume (p less than 0.001). Cholecystokinin blood concentration increased by 98%, from 20.9 +/- 5.7 pg/ml in controls to 41.3 +/- 5.4 after diversion (p less than 0.05), but pancreatic polypeptide, secretin, and gastrin levels were not affected. The volume of the exocrine pancreas doubled from 1104.6 +/- 78.2 mm3 in controls to 2201.2 +/- 229.2 (p less than 0.001), with a matching increase in interstitial tissue. On the contrary, the volume of the endocrine pancreas remained unchanged. Hyperplastic nodules developed in the exocrine pancreas, in 71% of diverted rats, but not in transected controls. We conclude from these observations that chronic diversion of bile and pancreatic juice stimulated pancreatic growth, most likely through a persistent rise of CCK plasma concentrations. Furthermore, this long lasting stimulation induced the development of exocrine pancreatic nodules.\r"

Thus when a Thiry Vella fistula is constructed and the crypt cell production rate counted in the fistula it can be shown to correlate with the degree of resection of the main bowel left in continuity. The only hormones which become raised in a similar pattern are enteroglucagon and peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY). Enteroglucagon has been shown to be part of preproglucagon, which contains in addition oxyntomodulin, glucagon like peptide 1 1-37 and 6-36NH2 and glucagon like peptide 2. These form the main candidates for the 'hormone of gut growth'. Peptide tyrosine tyrosine has been tested by direct administration over 12 days, matching the natural rise, but no affect on crypt cell production rate was seen. Glucagon like peptide 1 1-37 was similarly tested and also found to produce no effect. It remains to test the other members of the glucagon family to confirm or refute the hypothesis that one of them is the enigmatic small gut growth factor.\r"

For comparison, the trophic effects of chronic exogenous administration of CCK octapeptide (sc injection of 1 microgram/kg day every eight hours for 10 days) were also studied. In addition, the effects of a proglumide-analogue CCK-receptor antagonist (CR1409) on the stimulatory actions of camostate feeding and chronic administration of exogenous CCK were studied. The effects of the combination of chronic camostate feeding and sc injections of CCK, the effects of acute camostate feeding, and the effects of the CCK-receptor antagonist given without camostate or CCK were also studied. The results show that chronic camostate feeding markedly increased CCK plasma concentrations eight-fold over control values, and that acute camostate feeding increased plasma concentration to four fold of control values. Correspondingly, chronic camostate feeding markedly increased pancreatic weight, protein and DNA content. Exogenous CCK-8 also had qualitatively similar, but quantitatively less potent stimulatory effects. The combination of camostate and CCK-8 resulted in an additive stimulatory effect. The trophic actions of exogenous and endogenous CCK grossly increased chymotrypsinogen content, but left amylase content unaffected. The CCK-receptor antagonist CR 1409 completely abolished the trophic effects of exogenous CCK and greatly inhibited the effects of chronic camostate feeding. The CCK antagonist decreased pancreatic weight, DNA and protein content compared to control values when given without any CCK or camostate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of long term in vivo immunoneutralisation of EG, using monoclonal antibodies to EG, on the hyperplastic ileal response after small bowel resection. Nineteen rats had a 70% proximal resection. A group of 10 rats was given iv 0.5 ml of undiluted hybridoma ascites immediately after the operation and on the 7th day postoperatively. Furthermore 0.025 ml/day of the same hybridoma ascitic fluid was continuously delivered ip for 14 days via mini-osmotic pumps. The hybridoma ascites was prepared from the clone 23.6B4 synthesising a monoclonal antibody directed toward the N-terminal to central region of the glucagon molecule which showed a marked crossreaction with EG. A control group of 9 rats was given a corresponding amount of antibody-free plasmacytoma ascites (Ag 8.653) by the same technique. Seven and 14 days postoperatively there was a plasma anti-EG-antibody excess with an excess binding capacity of 84.9 glucagon eq nM and 88.5 glucagon eq nM respectively. The three dimensional architecture and the proliferative activity of the ileal remnant were evaluated two weeks postoperatively. Despite a continuous immunoneutralisation of circulating endogenous EG by monoclonal antibodies, the adaptive response of the ileal remnants was of the same magnitude as that seen in the control group. These data do not support the hypothesis that EG is a circulating enterotrophic regulatory peptide.\r"

Stressors included the cold pressor test and three reaction-time tasks: noncompetitive, competitive, and competitive plus money incentive. Substantial within-subject variations in blood pressure and heart rate were induced, varying from 119/70 to 148/94 mm Hg and from 63 to 91 beats/min on the average. Men (25 black and 39 white) with marginal SBP elevations during initial casual determinations had higher SBP under all conditions compared with men whose casual SBP levels were normal, and they also showed greater elevations over baseline levels in heart rate, SBP, and DBP during the stressors and the initial casual determination. Black and white subjects did not differ in their blood pressures at baseline or during the initial casual determinations, although blacks had slightly lower heart rates. Blacks did show greater SBP elevations over baseline levels than whites during the stressors, primarily because the blacks with marginally elevated SBP showed substantially greater stress-induced increases than whites with marginally elevated SBP. This enhanced pressor response to stress in blacks with marginal blood pressure elevations may be due to higher vascular resistance during enhanced sympathetic activity and could contribute to the higher incidence of hypertension among blacks.\r"

Subjects on a high salt diet had steeper slopes than those on low salt diets (p less than 0.0025); this trend was especially apparent among blacks (p less than 0.005). Black and white hypertensive subjects responded to the high salt diet in opposite fashion: The blacks showed an increased pressor sensitivity (p less than 0.05), whereas the whites demonstrated a nonsignificant decreased pressor sensitivity.

In the developmental phase of hypertension (3-5 weeks), the SHR showed a significant increase in RBC membrane elastic modulus (i.e., a decrease in RBC membrane deformability) when compared with the age-matched normotensive control rats (WKY). After the establishment of hypertension (7-8 weeks), however, the deformability of the RBC membrane of SHR improved and became comparable to that of the WKY.

  ".W": "To clarify the role of endogenous glucocorticoids in the regulation of blood pressure, the cardiovascular effects of RU 486, a steroid derivative with antiglucocorticoid properties, were investigated in Wistar rats. Pressor responses to angiotensin II (Ang II), norepinephrine, and vasopressin were studied in normal conscious rats before and after administration of RU 486. At 20 mg/kg/day, RU 486 significantly blunted pressor responses to Ang II and norepinephrine, whereas those to vasopressin were not greatly affected. At a lower dose, RU 486 did not alter pressor responses; at a higher dose, it augmented them, probably through its agonistic glucocorticoid effect. At 20 mg/kg/day, RU 486 antagonized the enhancing effect of a glucocorticoid agonist on pressor responses to Ang II, norepinephrine, and vasopressin. Cardiac output and renal blood flow were measured in anesthetized rats by the microsphere method. RU 486 at 20 mg/kg/day did not alter basal cardiac output and renal blood flow. RU 486 pretreatment attenuated pressor responses to Ang II and norepinephrine but did not alter cardiac output. It significantly blunted the decrease in renal blood flow and the increase in renal vascular resistance induced by Ang II. In rats fed a low sodium diet (where the pressor systems are stimulated), administration of RU 486 (20 mg/kg/day for 5 days) decreased total peripheral vascular resistance by 29% and mean blood pressure by 20 mm Hg. This effect was unrelated to any antimineralocorticoid activity of the compound, as shown by unchanged urinary sodium excretion, sodium balance, and plasma renin concentration. In contrast, it was due to the antiglucocorticoid activity, as shown by restoration of mean blood pressure by corticosterone, the major glucocorticoid in rats. Renal vascular resistance decreased during RU 486 administration in anesthetized (-25%) and unanesthetized (-19%) rats. Glomerular filtration rate, estimated from inulin clearance in conscious rats, did not change significantly. In conclusion, the present results suggest that endogenous glucocorticoids increase vascular reactivity and therefore contribute to blood pressure regulation. They also participate in the control of renal hemodynamics. This effect is most apparent in salt-restricted rats. The vascular action of glucocorticoids was unmasked by the administration of the antiglucocorticoid compound RU 486.\r"

We tested the hypothesis that gamma-melanocyte stimulating hormone (gamma-MSH) was such a peptide involved in the postnephrectomy natriuresis. In six rats undergoing sham nephrectomy, no change in UNaV or UKV occurred and plasma immunoreactive gamma-MSH-like material was 40 +/- 18 (SD) fmol/ml 2 hours after the sham procedure. In 10 rats undergoing acute unilateral nephrectomy, UNaV and UKV from the remaining kidney increased significantly, and immunoreactive gamma-MSH was 81 +/- 36 fmol/ml (p less than 0.02). In individual studies, the increase in UNaV after nephrectomy correlated with the postnephrectomy concentration of immunoreactive gamma-MSH (r = 0.75, p less than 0.001). In 17 rats injected with serum or globulin from control rabbits, unilateral nephrectomy led to the expected increases in UNaV and UKV. In 23 rats injected with serum or globulin from rabbits immunized against gamma-MSH, no postnephrectomy natriuresis occurred and the kaliuresis was blunted. In hydropenic, mineralocorticoid-treated rats, intravenous infusion of synthetic gamma-MSH led to natriuresis and kaliuresis with no change in inulin clearance; pretreatment with rabbit anti-gamma-MSH antiserum blocked this effect of peptide infusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In three groups of rats, artificial cerebrospinal fluid with various sodium concentrations (142, 152, and 162 mM) was infused into the third ventricle for 3 hours at 1.0 microliter/min. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and third ventricular pressure were monitored simultaneously, and both increased progressively over the 3-hour infusion period; the rate of rise was significantly greater with infusion of the hypertonic solution. There were no significant differences between the rat groups infused with low, normal, or high artificial cerebrospinal fluid sodium in either the slope or the intercept of the regression equation relating cerebrospinal fluid pressure and MAP: a 1 cm H2O rise of cerebrospinal fluid pressure was always associated with nearly a 1 mm Hg rise in MAP. In other rats, changes in both cerebrospinal fluid pressure and MAP were shown to be highly dependent on the rate of ventricular infusion. We conclude that elevations of systemic arterial pressure are associated with only small elevations of cerebrospinal fluid pressure and that physiological changes of cerebrospinal sodium (+/- 10 mM) influence arterial pressure by altering intravascular hydrostatic pressure rather than sodium or osmosensitive receptors in the cerebral ventricles.\r"

The measurements were made in three different thermal states on separate days: 1) cool-25 degrees C, 40% rh, esophageal temperature (Tes) = 36.64 +/- 0.10 degrees C; 2) warm-35 degrees C, 40% rh, Tes = 36.71 +/- 0.11 degrees C; and 3) hot-35 degrees C, 80% rh with the legs immersed in water at 42 degrees C, Tes = 37.26 +/- 0.11 degrees C. When water temperature was raised at 42 degrees C, Tes = 37.26 +/- 0.11 When water temperature was raised to 39-41 degrees C in the warm state, finger BF in the hand heated locally (BFw) decreased. When water temperature was raised to 43 degrees C, however, BFw returned to the control value. In the hot state, Tes rose steadily, reaching 37.90 +/- 0.12 degrees C at the end of the 50-min sessions. BF in the control finger also increased gradually during the session. BFw showed a tendency to decrease when water temperature was raised to 39 degrees C, but the change was not greater than that observed in the warm state. In the cool state, no such reduction in BFw was observed when water temperature was raised to 39-41 degrees C. On the contrary, BFw increased at water temperatures of 41-43 degrees C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Low inflation pressures (2.5-5 cmH2O) decreased nasal airway resistance, whereas higher inflation pressures (10-20 cmH2O) caused a biphasic response: an initial increase in resistance followed by a decrease in resistance. The nasal responses to all levels of inflation were completely abolished by hexamethonium, guanethidine, or bretylium pretreatment or cervical sympathectomy and greatly lessened by cervical vagotomy or phenoxybenzamine pretreatment. Atropine and propranolol pretreatments had no effect on the responses. These findings indicate that the nasal airway resistance is related to the level of inflation through pulmonary reflexes with afferents along the vagi and efferents via the alpha-adrenergic nervous system.\r"

  ".W": "To establish a natural model of sleep-disordered breathing, we investigated respiration during wakefulness and sleep in the English bulldog. This breed is characterized by an abnormal upper airway anatomy, with enlargement of the soft palate and narrowing of the oropharynx. During sleep, the animals had disordered respiration and episodes of O2 desaturation. These were worst in rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, with most bulldogs having O2 saturations of less than 90% for prolonged durations. In contrast, control dogs never desaturated. In REM sleep, the bulldogs had episodes of both central and obstructive apnea, the latter being associated with paradoxical movements of the rib cage and abdomen. During wakefulness, the bulldogs were hypersomnolent as evidenced by a shortened sleep latency (mean of 12 min compared with greater than 150 min for controls). This animal model should facilitate studies of the natural history of the sleep apnea syndrome and its complications.\r"

One hour after anesthetic induction, end-tidal concentration was set at 1.04% HAL or 0.28% MOF [each representing 1.2 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) for dogs] and maintained for 7 h. No time-related changes were associated with MOF. However, HAL significantly (P less than 0.05) elevated cardiac output (Q) from 2 to 7 h by increasing stroke volume; mean aortic pressure (MAP) also increased with time (P less than 0.05 beginning at 5 h). Four of these dogs were studied again at least 3 wk later at a constant end-tidal dose of 1.48% HAL in O2 (1.7 MAC). Q and MAP were lower initially during 1.7 MAC than during 1.2 MAC but not after 2 h of anesthesia. The greater HAL dose initially depressed ventilation and elevated arterial partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2) compared with the lower dose. PaCO2 continued to increase with duration of 1.7 MAC HAL, as did results of ventilatory gas volume and flow measurements.\r"

Histological sections of each ring were traced and each of the following dimensions measured: the external perimeter (Pe) and external area (Ae) defined by the outer border of smooth muscle and inner surface of cartilage, and the internal perimeter (Pi) and internal area (Ai) defined by the luminal surface of the epithelium and the muscle length (L) along its outer border. Absolute wall area (WA = Ae - Ai) and relative wall area (PW = WA/Ae) were calculated. Carbachol-treated tracheal ring dimensions were compared with those of their matched theophylline-treated rings. In tracheal rings with intact cartilage, maximal smooth muscle shortening of 44% was achieved with 10(-2) M carbachol. In tracheal rings in which anterior and posterior segments of cartilage were excised, the trachealis muscle passively shortened by 20% and maximal shortening (10(-3) M carbachol) was 57%. Although Ai decreased with maximal smooth muscle shortening, there were no changes in the length of Pi or in WA. These data show that the cartilage in the porcine trachea exerts both a preload that passively stretches the trachealis muscle and an afterload that limits maximal smooth muscle shortening.\r"

  ".W": "The role of vagal bronchopulmonary C-fiber afferents in eliciting the immediate changes in breathing pattern after acute inhalation of cigarette smoke was assessed with a selective blockade of myelinated vagal afferents (innervating both stretch and irritant receptors) utilizing the method of differential cooling. In 15 of 17 chloralose-anesthetized dogs tested, spontaneous inhalation of cigarette smoke (19.7% avg conc, 500-700 ml vol) reproducibly caused the following immediate responses: apnea, bradycardia, and hypotension. These responses occurred within 1 to 2 breaths of smoke inhalation and were followed by a delayed hyperpnea. The apneic duration reached 326 +/- 33% (SE) (n = 15) of the mean base-line expiratory duration. Differential cold block of both vagi (coolant temperature 8.4 +/- 0.3 degrees C) abolished the reflex apnea induced by a positive-pressure (7-10 cmH2O) lung inflation but did not affect the apneic response to smoke inhalation (345 +/- 35%). The smoke-induced apnea was completely abolished by lowering the coolant temperature to -1.3 +/- 0.2 degrees C (n = 10) or by bilateral vagotomy (n = 5) and returned to the control level after both vagi were rewarmed. Based on these results, we suggest that the immediate apneic response to inhaled cigarette smoke is elicited by a stimulation of vagal C-fiber afferents in the lungs and airways.\r"

Muscle pain, strength and contractile properties, and plasma creatine kinase (CK) were studied before and after each exercise bout. Muscle tenderness was greatest after the first bout and thereafter progressively decreased. Very high plasma CK levels (1,500-11,000 IU/l) occurred after the first bout, but the second and third bouts did not significantly affect the plasma CK. After each bout the strength was reduced by approximately 50% and after 2 wk had only recovered to 80% of preexercise values. Each exercise bout produced a marked shift of the force-frequency curve to the right which took approximately 2 wk to recover. The recovery rate of both strength and force-frequency characteristics was faster after the second and third bouts. Since the adaptation occurred after the performance of maximal contractions it cannot have been a result of changes in motor unit recruitment. The observed training effect of repeated exercise was not a consequence of the muscle becoming either stronger or more resistant to fatigue.\r"

Embolization with microspheres having mean diameters of 75, 200, and 550 microns and with barrier beads (2 X 3 X 3.5 mm) significantly increased the pressure gradient across the relatively compliant middle region (delta Pm) without increasing the gradients across the relatively noncompliant regions on the arterial (delta Pa) or venous (delta Pv) ends of the vasculature. In contrast ligation of several lobar arteries caused delta Pa to increase from 0.9 +/- 0.3 to 5.9 +/- 1.1 mmHg but did not change delta Pm or delta Pv. Assuming that delta Pa and delta Pv measured by vascular occlusion result from cessation of flow through resistances, these data suggest that in isolated pig lungs the vessels at the boundary between the arterial and middle regions defined by the occlusion technique are arteries greater than 2-3 mm diam and smaller than lobar arteries.\r"

  ".W": "Phrenic and external intercostal motoneuron activities were compared during progressive asphyxia induced by the interruption of artificial ventilation in the pentobarbital-urethan-anesthetized, gallamine-paralysed rabbit. The relative augmentation of inspiratory activity of the T1-T4 external intercostal nerves was significantly greater than that of the phrenic nerve during asphyxic hyperpnea. This was associated with a greater recruitment of intercostal than of phrenic motoneurons, particularly late in the hyperpneic phase immediately before the period of asphyxic apnea. However, peak and average discharge frequencies developed by intercostal motoneurons (n = 20) were only approximately 60% of those of the phrenic motoneurons (n = 28). Gasping respiration terminated the apneic period and was associated with a further intense recruitment of intercostal though not of phrenic motoneurons, but discharge frequencies developed by the intercostal motoneurons remained approximately 60% of those of the phrenic motoneurons. The instantaneous frequency profiles generated by the motoneurons often exhibited progressive changes during the terminal stages of hyperpnea (reduction in inspiratory duration and duty cycle and increases in inspiratory slope and discharge frequencies) such that much of the character of gasping respiration became evident before the apnea. Such smooth transitional sequences do not obviate the existence of an \"independent gasping center\" but do require that such a proposed center at least possess the capacity for interaction with those sites responsible for the generation of eupneic and hyperpneic respiration.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of pulmonary inflations on activities of single phrenic motoneurons. Studies were performed in decerebrate and paralyzed cats; activities of phrenic nerve and single phrenic motoneurons were recorded. Animals were ventilated with a servo-respirator which produced alterations in tracheal pressure in parallel with changes in integrated activity of the phrenic nerve. At end-tidal fractional concentrations of CO2 of 0.05, phrenic motoneurons were distributed into \"early\" and \"late\" populations, depending on time of onset of activity. During the late stages of neural inspiration, differences in levels of integrated activity of the phrenic nerve became evident between cycles with and without lung inflations. At a time approximating 90% of the inspiratory duration during inflations, integrated phrenic activity was higher for cycles with inflation. Concomitantly, with lung inflations, the discharge frequencies of early phrenic motoneurons were lower, and late motoneurons began to discharge sooner than when inflations were withheld. Similar results were obtained in hypercapnia. We conclude that reflexes activated by pulmonary inflations may produce augmentation, as well as inhibition of phrenic motoneuronal activities. Factors responsible for eliciting these reflex augmentations and inhibitions are discussed.\r"

We describe a similar rat model for repeated 31P-NMR studies that follows many of the 31P-NMR features observed in normal human controls. Calf muscles of rats anesthetized with chloral hydrate were indirectly stimulated at four frequencies (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Hz). It was found that 1) several steady states can be briefly maintained in this model; 2) work-induced phosphocreatine (PCr) fall and inorganic phosphate (Pi) rise is stoichiometric; 3) a linear relationship between stimulation rate and Pi/PCr was obtained, with a slope of 2.01 +/- 0.4 (+/- 2SD, n = 15); 4) no significant drop in ATP was observed, allowing the estimation of phosphorylation potential (PP) changes during this range of muscle work (PP at rest was 61,603 +/- 25,100 M-1 and fell to 6,700 +/- 900 M-1 at the end of exercise); and 5) poststimulation recovery was rapid, with a rate of 2.27 +/- 0.5 PCr/Pi U/min. This simple model can be used for prolonged studies of chronic animal muscle disorders.\r"

  ".W": "These experiments characterize the effects of hemoglobin and erythrocyte membrane lipids on the dynamic surface activity and adsorption facility of whole lung surfactant (LS) and a calf lung surfactant extract (CLSE) used clinically in surfactant replacement therapy for the neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). The results show that, at concentrations from 25 to 200 mg/ml, hemoglobin (Hb) increased the minimum dynamic surface tension of LS or CLSE mixtures (0.5 and 1.0 mumol/ml) from less than 1 to 25 dyn/cm on an oscillating bubble apparatus at 37 degrees C. Similarly, erythrocyte membrane lipids (0.5-3 mumol/ml) also prevented LS and CLSE suspensions (0.5-2.0 mumol/ml) from lowering surface tension below 19 dyn/cm under dynamic compression on the bubble. Surface pressure-time adsorption isotherms for LS suspensions (0.084 and 0.168 mumol phospholipid/ml) were also adversely affected by Hb (0.3-2.5 mg/ml), having a slower adsorption rate and magnitude. Significantly, these inhibitory effects of Hb and membrane lipids could be abolished if LS and CLSE concentrations were raised to high levels. In complementary physiological experiments, instillation of Hb, membrane lipids, or albumin into excised rat lungs was shown to cause a decrease in pressure-volume compliance. This decreased compliance was most prominent in lungs made partially surfactant deficient before inhibitor delivery and could be reversed by supplementation with active exogenous surfactant. Taken together, these data show that molecular components in hemorrhagic pulmonary edema can biophysically inactivate endogenous LS and adversely affect lung mechanics. Moreover, exogenous surfactant replacement can reverse this process even in the continued presence of inhibitor molecules and thus has potential utility in therapy for adult as well as neonatal RDS.\r"

If correct, there should be an inverse relation between upper airway volume and the length of hyoid muscles. To test this, known volumes of air were injected into or removed from the isolated sealed upper airway of eight pentobarbital sodium-anesthetized cats, and the resultant changes in geniohyoid and sternohyoid length were measured using sonomicrometry. Increases in upper airway volume shortened the geniohyoid in all cats (P less than 0.001) and shortened the sternohyoid in seven of eight cats (P less than 0.01); mean geniohyoid shortening (as a % of resting length) exceeded that of the sternohyoid. Decreases in upper airway volume lengthened the geniohyoid in all cats (P less than 0.001) but caused variable changes in sternohyoid length. Extension of the neck increased the resting lengths of both the geniohyoid (P less than 0.001) and sternohyoid (P less than 0.002). Neck flexion shortened the resting length of both hyoid muscles (P less than 0.001 for both), with the geniohyoid shortening more (as a % of resting length) than the sternohyoid (P less than 0.005). Progressive flexion of the neck from 180 to 90 degrees caused progressive increases in the ratio of changes in muscle length to changes in upper airway volume during airway inflation but did not affect this relation during airway deflation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The present studies were performed to 1) determine with electromyography (EMG) whether red muscle fiber activity is reduced in walking, curarized rats and 2) study muscle blood flow and glycogen loss during running with different doses of curare (dose response). At 0.5 min of treadmill walking (15 m/min), integrated EMG in vastus intermedius (VI) muscle was reduced by an average of 18% in curarized (60 micrograms/kg) rats, although blood flow (measured with microspheres) was the same as in saline control rats. Comparison of blood flows and glycogen loss in quadriceps muscles at 1 min of treadmill running (30 m/min) with different curare doses (20-60 micrograms/kg) demonstrated that red muscle glycogen loss was inversely related to curare dose but that blood flows in the same muscles were unaffected by curare. These findings provide support for our previous conclusion that at the initiation of low to moderate treadmill exercise, red muscle blood flow is not proportional to the activity or metabolism of the muscle fibers.\r"

We investigated the lactate-ammonia response using prolonged exercise and inspiration of hyperoxic gas (60% O2-40% N2). The exercise consisted of either 70-75% maximal O2 uptake (VO2 max) for 40 min (series 1, n = 6) or 75-80% VO2max for 30 min (series 2, n = 6) with the subjects inspiring room air on one occasion and hyperoxia in the other test. In both series blood ammonia rose continuously throughout the exercise regardless of the inspired gas treatment; in contrast blood lactate did not increase after 10 min with room air, and with hyperoxia blood lactate was reduced. Muscle lactate and ammonia (series 2; vastus lateralis) had responses similar to the blood data. The data demonstrated no apparent lactate-ammonia relationship with prolonged exercise or in response to hyperoxia, suggesting that ammonia production can be independent of lactate metabolism. The data also suggest that type I fibers can be a major source of ammonia in humans.\r"

The respective mean arterial O2 contents (CaO2) were 4.46 +/- 0.20, 3.89 +/- 0.24, and 3.22 +/- 0.19 ml/dl. Mean arterial PO2 was reduced significantly (by 2 Torr) only during moderate anemia, and mean arterial pH was decreased only during severe anemia. No significant changes occurred in arterial PCO2. Fetal tachycardia occurred during anemia. Mean arterial pressure was reduced by 2-3 mmHg during mild anemia; however, no significant blood pressure changes were observed for moderate or severe anemia. The incidence of rapid-eye movements and breathing activity was not affected by mild anemia, but the incidence of both was reduced significantly during moderate and severe anemia. It is concluded that 1) a reduction in CaO2 of greater than 2.48 +/- 0.22 ml/dl by hemodilution inhibits rapid-eye movements and breathing activity, and 2) the PO2 signal for inhibition does not come from arterial blood but from lower PO2 in tissue.\r"

Three protocols employed custom-made bulky mouthpiece with or without nose-clips, two protocols used a scuba-diving mouthpiece and cotton balls placed in the nostrils instead of noseclips, and two protocols employed neck flexion and extension. We found no significant difference in average pharyngeal, glottic, and tracheal areas for any of the protocols except for neck flexion, which was associated with a significantly lower mean pharyngeal area. Intraindividual variabilities were comparable for all protocols, except for protocol employing the customary bulky mouthpiece and no noseclips, which consistently resulted in the most variable measurements of area for all three airway segments: pharynx, glottis, and trachea. Furthermore, we found that the protocol employing the scuba-diving mouthpiece with or without cotton balls in the nostrils resulted in the lowest number of unacceptable measurements. We conclude that measurements of airway area by acoustic reflections may be further simplified by using a scuba-diving mouthpiece without noseclips; furthermore, control of head position during measurements is not critical provided there is no obvious neck flexion.\r"

In the first series of experiments the duration of PE at a power output equivalent to 98% maximum O2 uptake (VO2max) was varied between 0.5 and 6 min before measurement of maximal STPO. As PE duration increased subsequent STPO fell to approximately 70% of control values after 3-6 min. In series ii the effect of varying the intensity of PE of fixed 6-min duration was studied in five subjects. After PE less than 60% VO2max there was an increase of 12% in STPO, but after greater than 60% VO2max there was a progressive fall in STPO as PE intensity increased, indicating a reduction of approximately 35% at 100% VO2max compared with control values. In series iii we examined the effect on STPO of allowing a recovery period after a fixed intensity (mean = 87% VO2max) of 6 min PE before measurement of STPO. This indicated a rapid recovery of dynamic function with a half time of approximately 32 s, which is similar to the kinetics of PC resynthesis and taken with the other findings suggests the dominant role that PC exerts on the STPO under these conditions.\r"

The approach was to measure capillary diffusion capacity (PS) in working hearts and then measure capillary numerical density (CD), capillary surface area density (CSA), and capillary volume density (CV) in specimens from perfused-fixed hearts. Eight dogs (20-30 kg) were exercise trained (ET) for 12-18 wk and compared with a group of seven control dogs. PS for 51Cr-labeled ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid was determined during maximal adenosine coronary vasodilation with perfusion pressures equal to 100 mmHg in both groups. The trained dogs' maximal PS averaged 58 +/- 10 ml.min-1.100 g-1, which was significantly greater than the control value (31 +/- 6). Maximal PS was linearly related to CV (r = 0.61) and CSA (r = 0.78) in the ET group. However, there was no difference between control and trained average left ventricular CD, CSA, CV, or intercapillary distance. The data indicate that although coronary blood flow capacity and capillary transport capacity may be improved in exercise-trained dog hearts, these changes are not the result of an increase in myocardial capillarity. Rather, the increased maximal PS appears to be due to changes in the determinants of capillary blood flow and/or the relationship between capillary area available for exchange and capillary perfusion.\r"

  ".W": "When systemic delivery of O2 [QO2 = cardiac output X arterial O2 content (CaO2)] is reduced, the systemic O2 extraction ratio [(CaO2-concentration of O2 in venous blood/CaO2] increases until a critical limit is reached below which O2 uptake (VO2) becomes limited by delivery. Many patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome exhibit supply dependence of VO2 even at high levels of QO2, which suggests that a peripheral O2 extraction defect may be present. Since many of these patients also suffer from serious bacterial infection, we tested the hypothesis that bacteremia might produce a similar defect in the ability of tissues to maintain VO2 independent of QO2, as QO2 reduced. The critical O2 delivery (QO2crit) and critical extraction ratio (ERcrit) were compared in a control group of dogs and a group receiving a continuous infusion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5 x 10(7) organisms/min). Dogs were anesthetized, paralyzed, and ventilated with room air. Systemic QO2 was reduced in stages by hemorrhage as hematocrit was maintained. At each stage, systemic VO2 and QO2 were measured, and the critical point was determined from a plot of VO2 vs. QO2. The mean QO2crit and ERcrit of the bacteremic group (11.4 +/- 2.2 ml.min-1.kg-1 and 0.51 +/- 0.09) were significantly different from control (7.4 +/- 1.2 and 0.71 +/- 0.10) (P less than 0.05). These results suggest that bacterial infection can reduce the ability of peripheral tissues to extract O2 from a limited supply, causing VO2 to become limited by O2 delivery at a stage when a smaller fraction of the delivered O2 has been extracted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During breathing near TLC compared with FRC, tidal volume decreased (674 +/- 542 vs. 68 +/- 83 ml; P less than 0.025). Both inspiratory changes in gastric pressure (4.5 +/- 2.5 vs. -0.2 +/- 2.0 cmH2O; P less than 0.005) and changes in abdominal cross-sectional area (25 +/- 17 vs. -1.0 +/- 4.2%; P less than 0.001) markedly decreased; they were both often negative during inspiration near TLC. Parasternal intercostal shortening decreased (-3.0 +/- 3.7 vs. -2.0 +/- 2.7%), whereas diaphragmatic shortening decreased slightly more in both costal and crural parts (costal -8.4 +/- 2.9 vs. -4.3 +/- 4.1%, crural -22.8 +/- 13.2 vs. -10.0 +/- 7.5%; P less than 0.05). As a result, the ratio of parasternal to diaphragm shortening increased near TLC (0.176 +/- 0.135 vs. 0.396 +/- 0.340; P less than 0.05). Electromyographic (EMG) activity in the parasternals slightly decreased near TLC, whereas the EMG activity in the costal and crural parts of the diaphragm slightly increased. We conclude that 1) the mechanical outcome of diaphragmatic contraction near TLC is markedly reduced, and 2) the mechanical outcome of parasternal intercostal contraction near TLC is clearly less affected.\r"

Angle-specific torques were measured over a range (0.5-5.0 rad/s) of preset velocities, torque decreasing in a nonlinear manner with increasing angular velocity. The torque-velocity data was adequately described by an exponential equation of the form: V = a(e-1/b - e-Po/b) where V = velocity (rad/s), P = torque (N.m), Po = isometric torque (N.m), and a and b are constants.

Female rats were divided into five groups: 1) a sedentary group that received cortisol acetate (CA, 100 mg/kg body wt); 2) a sedentary group that received the dosing vehicle (1% aqueous carboxymethyl cellulose); 3) an exercise group that received CA immediately after each exercise session; 4) an exercise group that received CA 90 min after each exercise session; and 5) an exercise group that received the vehicle. Steroid treatment and exercise (28.7 m/min for 90 min/day) were performed for 11 consecutive days. Initiation of training prevented muscle mass loss by 60% in plantaris (P) muscles and by 25% in gastrocnemius (G) muscles. Time of steroid injection was not related to the muscle sparing response. In the glucocorticoid-treated exercised rats, the activities of citrate synthase, a training marker, increased 60% in P and 37% in G. Thus the exercise appeared to cause a greater recruitment of P muscles. These data support the hypothesis that entering into an exercise program can be effective in retarding glucocorticoid-induced muscle atrophy. The degree of atrophy prevention, however, may be related to the extent that specific muscles are recruited during exercise.\r"

It was necessary to determine the smallest fraction of muscle that had the same force-velocity properties as the whole muscle. This was approximately 15% for FDL; if the fraction was less, the maximum speed of shortening was depressed and the a/Po value increased. Motor units were enlarged by partial denervation of the muscle, causing the intact motoneurons to sprout and incorporate more muscle fibers; FR units showed the greatest increase. Immediately after the fatigue regime, maximum isometric tetanic tension declined to 67% but subsequently recovered to 90% of the control value by the end of the 60-min recovery period. Maximum speed of shortening dropped to 71% of the control but after 30 min had recovered and did not differ significantly from control values. It is concluded that the capacity for recovery from fatigue is greater for FR units than for a whole muscle, which also contains fast-fatiguable units, and that the mechanisms involved in the recovery of the maximum isometric tension and maximum speed of shortening are independently regulated.\r"

One hundred and twenty-seven healthy elderly subjects (mean age: 68) and 44 young and middle-aged subjects (mean age: 39) underwent a maximal exercise test with breath-by-breath measurement of ventilation and gas exchange variables. Ventilatory threshold was determined by visual inspection of the breakpoints in the VE/VO2 and PETO2 data curves. Additional measures were made in a subset of subjects to determine the reproducibility and interobserver variability of VeT and the relationship between VeT and the venous lactate threshold (LaT). Day-to-day reproducibility of VeT was good with a mean difference in VO2 at VeT on two occasions of 40.23 +/- 125 ml/min. Interobserver variability was low (intraclass correlation coefficient of r = 0.941) and VeT was found to correlate to LaT (r = 0.79, P less than 0.05) with LaT occurring a mean 2.3 min after VeT. VeT declined significantly with age in both males and females but less rapidly than VO2max. Both VO2max and VeT were found to vary with age, sex, height, and weight in a stepwise multiple-linear regression analysis. Age-associated changes in skeletal muscle composition may be in part responsible for the less precipitous decline in VeT with age compared with VO2max.\r"

As specific scavengers of O2-. and H2O2, we infused polyethylene glycol-superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD; 2,000 IU/kg) and PEG-catalase (CAT; 15,000 IU/kg), respectively. Escherichia coli endotoxin (055-B5) was infused intravenously into anesthetized 10- to 14-wk-old pigs at 5 micrograms/kg the 1st h, followed by 2 micrograms.kg-1.h-1 for 3.5 h. During phase 1 (i.e., 0-2 h) and 2 (i.e., 2-4.5 h), endotoxin decreased cardiac index (CI) and lung dynamic compliance, and increased mean pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), total peripheral resistance (TPR), alveolar-arterial O2 gradient, and hematocrit. Endotoxemia also caused granulocytopenia and increased the postmortem bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) albumin concentration and wet-to-dry ratio of bloodless lung. During endotoxemia, PEG-SOD failed to significantly alter any measured or calculated parameter. On the other hand, PEG-CAT attenuated the early (i.e., 0-1 h) endotoxin-induced decrease in CI and increases in Ppa, PVR, and TPR, but failed to modify these parameters during phase 2. PEG-CAT also attenuated the endotoxin-induced granulocytopenia and the increased BALF albumin concentration. In the presence of inactivated PEG-CAT, these protective effects were reversed. We conclude that O2-. does not directly contribute to endotoxin-induced lung injury and that H2O2 (or a subsequent metabolite) contributes to the early endotoxin-induced hemodynamic changes, granulocytopenia, and increased permeability of the alveolar-capillary membrane.\r"

These work rates represented 90% of the anaerobic threshold (AT) work rate and 25, 50, and 75% of the difference between maximum O2 consumption and AT work rates for that subject (as determined from previous incremental exercise tests). Subjects then underwent 8 wk of strenuous cycle ergometer exercise for 45 min/day. They then repeated the four constant work rate tests at work rates identical to those used before training. During tests before and after training, VE and gas exchange were measured breath by breath and rectal temperature (Tre) was measured continuously. A venous blood sample was drawn at the end of each test and assayed for lactate (La), epinephrine (EPI), and norepinephrine (NE). We found that the VE for below AT work was reduced minimally by training (averaging 3 l/min). For the above AT tests, however, training reduced VE markedly, by an average of 7, 23, and 37 l/min for progressively higher work rates. End-exercise La, NE, EPI, and Tre were all lower for identical work rates after training. Importantly, the magnitude of the reduction in VE was well correlated with the reduction in end-exercise La (r = 0.69) with an average decrease of 5.8 l/min of VE per milliequivalent per liter decrease in La. Correlations of VE with NE, EPI, and Tre were much less strong (r = 0.49, 0.43, and 0.15, respectively).\r"

An increase in total pulmonary resistance was sought as the measure of airway narrowing. The role of the ETA in the increased pulmonary resistance with loading was examined by testing the same infants while endotracheally intubated and after extubation. Total pulmonary resistance decreased with loading during the intubated studies (102.5 +/- 41.2 to 82.4 +/- 33.3 cmH2O.1-1.s, P less than 0.05), whereas a significant increase in pulmonary resistance was seen with loading in the extubated studies (101 +/- 58.1 to 128 +/- 68.6 cmH2O.1-1.s, P less than 0.01). Intraluminal pressure in the ETA, measured by the lowest proximal airway pressure, fell significantly with loading in both conditions, with values changing from -0.7 +/- 0.3 to -4.7 +/- 2.7 cmH2O in the intubated infants and from -0.9 +/- 0.3 to -4.6 +/- 0.9 cmH2O) in the extubated infants (P less than 0.01). The results suggest ETA narrowing with loading in extubated infants despite the absence of overt obstructive apnea. Measurements of total pulmonary resistance with IRL can be used as a simple test of ETA stability.\r"

The models were a local random walk model (LDRW), a log-normal distribution, and a two-compartment model. First, the accuracy of the extrapolation of the tail by each model was tested on two undisturbed curves by taking the truncation at five different points on the descending limb. The extrapolated curve area obtained from each model was compared with total area of the undisturbed curve. Next, dilution curves obtained during inspiratory hold maneuvers and characterized by deflection points were analyzed, taking the truncation just before deflection. The estimates of cardiac output by the models were compared with electromagnetically measured flow in the pulmonary artery. The area of the dilution curve was estimated more accurately when more information on the descending limb was available. The LDRW model and the log-normal distribution were superior to the two-compartment model regarding accuracy of cardiac output estimation and root-mean-square errors of the fit. Both models estimated curve area with an error less than 5% when truncation of the descending limb occurred below 60% of the peak value. In circumstances of mechanical ventilation, where only short periods of constant flow will be present, analyses of dilution curves based on the LDRW model or the log-normal distribution are recommended.\r"

We also studied the specificity of histamine tachyphylaxis by examining for tachyphylaxis in response to inhaled acetylcholine in these subjects. We subsequently investigated whether indomethacin pretreatment inhibited histamine tachyphylaxis. Tachyphylaxis in response to inhaled histamine occurred in all subjects. The mean histamine provocative concentration causing a 20% fall in the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (PC20) increased from 3.04 +/- 1.9 (%SD), to 4.88 +/- 1.9, and to 6.53 +/- 2.2 mg/ml (P less than 0.0005) with successive inhalation tests. Tachyphylaxis was still present at 3 h (P less than 0.01), but not in all subjects at 6 h (P greater than 0.05). Tachyphylaxis, however, did not occur in response to inhaled acetylcholine. In addition, indomethacin pretreatment prevented histamine tachyphylaxis. Thus this study demonstrates that there is a histamine-specific mechanism that can partially protect the airways against repeated bronchoconstriction caused by histamine. This effect may occur through the release of inhibitory prostaglandins in the airway after histamine stimulation. Also when histamine inhalation tests are repeated on the same day, the tests should be separated by greater than 6 h to avoid tachyphylaxis.\r"

  ".W": "A mathematical model has been developed that permitted the calculation of the flow-weighted mean tissue O2 consumption (VO2T) at the onset of a step increase in work rate. From breath-by-breath measurements of alveolar O2 consumption (VO2A) and cardiac output (Q) by impedance cardiography and assumptions about the site of depletion of O2 stores, the rate of change in O2 stores (VO2s) was determined. The sum of VO2A + VO2s = VO2T. Six very fit males performed six repetitions of each of two step increases in work rate. STlo was a transition from rest to 100-W cycling; SThi was a transition from 100- to 200-W cycling. For each work rate transition, the responses of VO2A and Q were averaged over the six repetitions of each subject and the model was solved to yield VO2T. The responses of VO2A, VO2T, and Q after the increase in work rate were fit with a monoexponential function. This function included a time constant and time delay, the sum of which gave the mean response time (MRT). In the STlo test, the MRT of VO2A (24.9 +/- 1.1 s, mean +/- SE) was longer than that of VO2T (15.3 +/- 1.3 s) and of Q (16.5 +/- 6.5 s) (P less than 0.05). The MRT of VO2T and Q did not differ significantly. Also for SThi, the MRT of VO2A (34.4 +/- 3.3 s) was significantly longer than that of VO2T (30.0 +/- 3.4 s) (P less than 0.05). The MRT of VO2T and Q (30.3 +/- 5.5 s) were not significantly different at this work rate either.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We made quantitative measurements of the unidirectional flux of radiolabeled chloride between blood and CSF in anesthetized dogs, using 38Cl, a short-lived isotope (half-life 37.3 min). This allowed multiple studies to be performed in a given animal. A three-compartment model for the blood, CSF, brain extracellular fluid, and ventriculocisternal perfusion system was used to determine the flux rate. With normocapnia, the flux was 0.01.1 min-1. The influx could be reproducibly measured for three separate determinations in the same animal over a period of 6 h, being 98 +/- 6% of the control first run on the second run and 113 +/- 6% on the third. Furosemide and bumetanide, inhibitors of sodium-coupled chloride movement, lowered the flux to 43 +/- 3% and 55 +/- 6% of control, respectively. The combination of hypercapnia and furosemide lowered the influx to 63 +/- 9% of control.

In selective segments of the arteries, ID decreased abruptly and maximally by 50-70% in a specific stimulus frequency to the vagal nerve and a dose of ACh. The vasoconstrictor sites were distributed near the branching points of the arteries, particularly those downstream, and their numbers increased with an increase in the stimulus frequencies and ACh doses. The relative frequencies of occurrences were 15.3% with VNS (30 Hz) and 5.3% with ACh (0.9 microgram). In nonselective segments with VNS, ID decreased frequency dependently by 0, 4, 12, and 26% at 1, 4, 15, and 30 Hz, respectively, and with ACh, decreased dose dependently by 21 and 35% with 0.3 and 0.9 microgram, respectively. The vasoconstriction in response to VNS and ACh was attenuated by atropine, enhanced by eserine, and not affected by phentolamine. That vasoconstriction to VNS was abolished by hexamethonium. No selective constriction was found in veins and the ID was decreased uniformly by 1-2% with VNS and ACh.\r"

After CMA administration, minute alveolar ventilation increased by +1.04 +/- 0.22 (SE) 1/min (P less than 0.05) accompanied by decrements of arterial PCO2 (-4.0 +/- 1.0 Torr) (P less than 0.01) and [HCO3-] (-2.1 +/- 0.05 mM/l) (P less than 0.01). On the other hand, in the MPA runs the corresponding changes of the above parameters were +0.71 +/- 0.21 l/min (P less than 0.05), -2.9 +/- 0.6 Torr (P less than 0.01), and -1.3 +/- 0.3 mM/l (P less than 0.01), respectively. The slopes of hypoxic ventilatory and occlusion pressure response lines remained unchanged in hypocapnia after CMA or MPA ingestion, but they increased when entidal PCO2 was adjusted to the predrug level. The hypercapnic ventilatory and occlusion pressure response lines merely shifted to the left without changing their slopes with these agents. No significant differences in all the above parameters were found between CMA and MPA runs. We concluded that in the normal males the effect of CMA on ventilation was similar to that of MPA, despite the fact that the luteinizing activity of CMA was reported to be approximately 10 times higher than the latter.\r"

Pregnant does were injected with betamethasone (0.1 mg/kg per day im) or vehicle on days 24 and 25 of gestation, and fetal rabbits were delivered on days 26 and 27. Natural surfactant (50 mg/kg body wt) was instilled intratracheally into half of the lungs after tracheotomy. After nine cycles of inflation with air to 40 cmH2O and deflation, air pressure-volume curves were measured. Then the lungs were filled with air to rupture, and rupture volume and pressure were recorded. Both corticosteroids and surfactant caused an increase in maximal lung volumes (P less than 0.01) and a decrease of lung rupture pressures (P less than 0.01) compared with controls. The effects of corticosteroids plus surfactant on lung volumes were the sum of each effect individually, but rupture pressures were the same as those for corticosteroids or surfactant alone. Surfactant, in addition, caused an increase in lung stability at deflation, an effect that was not evident in the corticosteroid-treated groups. Measurements of saturated phosphatidylcholine in alveolar washes and lung tissue indicated comparable values in the corticosteroid and control groups. We conclude that changes in static properties and rupture pressures presumably reflect changes in lung structure caused by corticosteroids that are independent of a corticosteroid effect on surfactant pool sizes.\r"

Both segments showed small but significant decreases in end-expiratory length during progressive hypercapnia. Although both costal and crural segments showed electromyographic activity within the first 100 ms of inspiration, in early inspiration crural shortening predominated with minimal costal shortening. Neither segment contracted isometrically early in inspiration in the presence of airway occlusion. The amount of crural shortening during airway occlusion exceeded costal shortening; both segments showed increased shortening with prolonged occlusion and increasing CO2. Costal and crural shortening at 100 ms was not different for unoccluded and occluded states. These observations suggest that neural control patterns evoke discrete and unequal contributions from the diaphragmatic segments at the beginning of an inspiration; the crural segment may be predominately recruited in early inspiration. Despite traditional assumptions about occlusion pressure measurement (P0.1), diaphragm segments do not contract isometrically during early inspiratory effort against an occluded airway.\r"

These findings are consistent with the well-known positive adaptation of skeletal muscle mitochondria to endurance training. However, there was no concomitant increase in the vitamin E content of tissues, which showed an increase in mitochondrial content. Since ubiquinone is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane and the major pool of vitamin E is also associated with mitochondrial membranes, the results suggest that training causes a substantial decrease in vitamin E concentration in the proliferating muscle mitochondrial membranes, thus depleting muscle mitochondria of their major lipid antioxidant. Since vitamin E is the major cellular, lipid-soluble, chain-breaking antioxidant, these findings indicate increased free radical reactions in the tissues of exercising animals.\r"

End-expiratory lung volume assessed by respiratory inductive plethysmography [sum of end-expiratory levels (SUM EEL)] increased early and decreased late during the ventilatory phases (P less than 0.0001, one-way analysis of variance). Inspiratory change in esophageal pressure (Pes) and peak inspiratory diaphragmatic and genioglossal electromyograms (EMGdi and EMGge) decreased while the inspiratory pressure generated for a given diaphragmatic activity (Pes/EMGdi) increased during the preapneic phase (P less than 0.0001, for all). Multiple regression analysis with Pes/EMGdi as the dependent variable (R2 = 0.90) indicated that both the changes in SUM EEL and EMGge significantly contributed to the model (P less than 0.008 and 0.004, respectively). These results indicate that end-expiratory lung volume fluctuates during NREM sleep in patients with occlusive apnea and suggest that these changes along with the changes in upper airway muscle activity contribute to the generation of negative inspiratory pressure, leading to the passive collapse of the upper airways.\r"

  ".W": "Several lines of evidence suggest that the healthy mammalian lung empties homogeneously during a maximally forced deflation. Nonetheless, such behavior would appear to be implausible if for no other reason than that airway structure is known to be substantially heterogeneous among parallel pathways of gas conduction. To resolve this paradox we reexamined the degree to which lung emptying is homogeneous, and considered mechanisms that might control differential regional emptying. Twelve excised canine lungs were studied. Regional alveolar pressure relative to pleural pressure was used as an index of regional lung volume. By use of a capsule technique, alveolar pressure was measured simultaneously in each of six regions during flow-limited deflations; flow from the lung was measured plethysmographically. The standard deviation of interregional pressure differences, which was taken as an index of nonuniformity, was 0.0, 0.74, 0.64, and 0.90 cmH2O at mean recoil pressures of 30, 8.4, 4.5, and 2.1 cmH2O (0, 25, 50, and 75% expired vital capacity), indicating that interregional pressure differences increased more rapidly earlier in the deflation. When we examined the time rate of change of regional alveolar pressure as an index of regional flow, we observed an intricate pattern of differential regional behavior that was inapparent in the maximum expiratory flow-volume (MEFV) curve. The most plausible interpretation of these findings is that regions of the healthy excised canine lung empty heterogeneously to a small degree, but in an interdependent compensatory pattern that is inapparent in the configuration of the maximum expiratory flow-volume curve.\r"

In this study we attempted to localize the responsible mechanism at one of three possible sites: the carotid bodies, the central nervous system (CNS), or the ventilatory apparatus. The ventilatory response to sustained hypoxia (PETO2, 40-50 Torr) was tested in 5 awake and 14 anesthetized adult cats. The roll off was found in both anesthetized and awake cats. Isocapnic hypoxia initially increased ventilation as well as phrenic and carotid sinus nerve activity in anesthetized cats (288 +/- 31, 269 +/- 31, 273 +/- 29% of control value, respectively). During the roll off, ventilation and phrenic nerve activity decreased similarly (to 230 +/- 26 and 222 +/- 28%, respectively after the roll off), but in contrast carotid sinus nerve activity remained unchanged (270 +/- 26%). Thus the ventilatory roll off was reflected in phrenic but not in carotid sinus nerve activity. We conclude that the cat represents a useful animal model of the roll off phenomenon and that the mechanism responsible for the secondary decrease in ventilation lays within the CNS.\r"

  ".W": "The present study examined the effects of elastase-induced emphysema on the structure of the external oblique and transverse abdominis muscles and a non-respiratory muscle, the extensor digitorum longus. Muscle structure was assessed from the cross-sectional area (CSA) and percent of individual fiber types in histochemically stained sections and from the number of sarcomeres arranged in series along the length of individual fibers. Data were obtained in eight hamsters with emphysema and nine saline-injected controls. In the normal (control) animals the external oblique was thicker but contained fewer sarcomeres than the transverse abdominis. Fiber size was similar in the two muscles. In the transverse abdominis the percents of fast-glycolytic and fast-oxidative fibers were greater and smaller, respectively, than in the external oblique. Lung volume of emphysematous hamsters was 168% of control values (P less than 0.001). In emphysematous compared with control animals, the CSA of fast-twitch fibers in the external oblique and transverse abdominis was significantly reduced. Fiber length and sarcomere number were significantly decreased in the transverse abdominis but not in the external oblique in emphysematous hamsters. In contrast, fiber size and composition of the extensor digitorum longus was similar in emphysematous and control animals. These data indicate that cellular responses of the ventilatory muscles to chronic hyperinflation and altered thoracic geometry induced by emphysema are not present in limb skeletal muscle. We speculate that changes in fiber length and CSA of fast fibers in the abdominal expiratory muscles reflect responses to chronic alterations in the mechanics of breathing that may affect muscle load, length, or the pattern of activity.\r"

During normoxia, noncumulative infusions of NaCN (5-400 micrograms/kg body wt) produced dose-dependent ventilatory (VE) stimulation. Maximal VE stimulation (VEmax) and ventilatory sensitivity to NaCN [i.e., log dose producing 50% of VEmax (log ED50)] did not significantly vary with age, with the average VEmax and log ED50 values amounting to 238% above base line and 1.564 micrograms/kg, respectively. During hypoxia, after initial stimulation (average: 152%), VE progressively decreased and stabilized to 67% above the normoxic base-line level. In contrast to normoxia, subsequent NaCN administration during steady-state hypoxia produced dose-dependent VE depression, occasionally manifested by abrupt apnea. The NaCN effect during hypoxia was significantly related to age (P less than 0.05), as well as to the estimated change in CO2 production during hypoxia (P less than 0.01). Both the respiratory depressant effects of hypoxia alone and in combination with NaCN were abolished after denervation of the peripheral chemoreceptors. These findings demonstrate that while PCR stimulation during normoxia produces ventilatory stimulation, the influence of enhanced PCR input during hypoxia is centrally modulated to produce ventilatory depression.\r"

In both groups, the intra-airway temperature fell progressively as ventilation increased, and there were no significant differences between the thermal profiles of the two populations at rest or during exercise. Calculation of water losses and the osmolality of the airway surface fluid failed to demonstrate significant airway drying in either group. With cessation of the work load, the airstream temperature increased abruptly, rising two times more rapidly in the asthmatics than the normals. Since the major source of heat in these experiments is the bronchial circulation, our findings suggest a reaction sequence consisting of vasoconstriction and airway cooling during exercise followed by a rapid resupply of heat when exercise ceases. The latter may cause the hyperplastic capillary bed in the airways of asthmatics to develop an exaggerated rebound hyperemia which may lead to airway edema and EIA.\r"

Sixty-two rabbits in four groups were ventilated for 3 h with VT of either 10 or 25 ml/kg body wt, EEP of 0 or 2 cmH2O, and Tenv of 18 or 35 degrees C. After ventilation, Pel at 80% of total lung capacity (P80) was significantly increased when ventilation was performed with the combination of large VT, 0 EEP, and low Tenv. This change was prevented by altering any one of the three conditions, e.g., small VT, positive EEP, or high Tenv. Similarly, elevation of minimum surface tension and reduction of surface activity index of lavages from excised lungs after ventilation were observed only when increased P80 was noted. Additionally, the increase of P80 was well correlated with increment of wet weight-to-dry weight ratio and degree of perivascular cuffing and alveolar edema formation of excised lungs. These results indicate that elevation of Pel after high tidal ventilation in open-chest animals in vivo was influenced by level of EEP and Tenv and that the degree of edema formation was closely related to the increase of Pel. The increased Pel is presumably primary and causes fluid accumulation.\r"

Am. J. Physiol. 238 (Regulatory Integrative Comp. Physiol. 7): R328-R332, 1980] was examined in muscles and liver in response to pharmacological alterations of gluconeogenic precursor flux. The minor role of lactate for glycogen resynthesis after prolonged submaximal exercise was confirmed by the insignificant accumulation of lactate neither in muscles nor in plasma. When the rate of lipolysis is reduced either by beta-blockade or by nicotinic acid injection, the replenishment of muscle glycogen persisted, suggesting that glycerol released by triglycerides hydrolysis did not play an important role in glycogen resynthesis. On the other hand, when pyruvate oxidation is enhanced by dichloroacetate (DCA), thus reducing plasma levels of lactate and alanine, glycogen resynthesis was completely blocked in liver and partly in some but not all muscles. This failure in total inhibition of glycogen resynthesis associated with the significant reduction of the plasma alanine level could be attributed to the possible stimulation of gluconeogenesis from alanine by DCA (R.A. Harris and D.W. Crabb. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 189: 364-371, 1978). The results could point out alanine as the major gluconeogenic substrate during recovery from exhaustive exercise in fasting conditions.\r"

Spontaneous recovery reversed the 15% reduction in VO2max, whereas training posthypokinesia induced a 20% increase over control values. In the spontaneous recovery group, both citrate synthase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities, decreased by hypokinesia (-40%), increased but remained 20% below the control level. In the training posthypokinesia group, an increase of these activities over control occurred (+50 and +20%, respectively). Recovery or training led to a 100% type I distribution in soleus muscle and to a recovery of all fibers' cross-sectional areas. In the spontaneous recovery group, capillaries per fiber, decreased by 46%, returned to the normal range. In the training posthypokinesia group, training induced an increase in capillaries per fiber above their control values (+23%). These results point to the plasticity of the muscle and indicate the necessity of a posthypokinesia training program for recovery of the total oxidative enzyme capacity.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the increased incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) that occurs in infants of diabetic mothers (IDM) with poor maternal glucose homeostasis, we infused glucose intravenously at a rate of 14 +/- 2 (SD) mg.kg-1.min-1 into eight twin and four singleton chronically catheterized fetal lambs from 112 days (0.77) gestation onward. Twelve catheterized and seven uncatheterized fetuses served as controls, including the eight twins of the glucose-treated fetuses. Glucose infusion resulted in a twofold elevation in fetal serum glucose levels and a 2.2-fold elevation in fetal serum insulin levels. Before 113 days (0.9) gestation, pulmonary disaturated phosphatidylcholine (DSPC) content was 1.5-fold higher in the glucose-infused fetuses than in the controls. However, after 0.9 gestation, pulmonary DSPC content increased 2.2-fold in the controls but did not increase significantly in the glucose-infused fetuses. In addition, the DSPC content of lung lavage was 5.0-fold higher in the controls and lung stability to air inflation was 2.0-fold greater and to deflation was 2.2-fold greater than in the glucose-infused fetuses. Pulmonary adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate-dependent protein kinase activity was also 1.5-fold higher, and pulmonary protein kinase C activity was 1.3-fold higher in the controls than in the glucose-infused fetuses. In contrast, glucose infusion was associated with a 1.8-fold increase in pulmonary glycogen content and with increased activities of glycogen phosphorylase kinase and glycogen phosphorylase. We conclude that the effects of chronic glucose infusion on fetal lamb lung DSPC and lung stability are compatible with a predisposition of the fetus to develop RDS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Diaphragmatic strength was assessed in 17 rats by measuring the abdominal pressure (Pab) generated during supramaximal stimulation of the intramuscular phrenic nerve endings at frequencies of 0.5, 30, and 100 Hz. Halothane was administered during 30 min at a constant minimum alveolar concentration (MAC): 0.5, 1, and 1.5 MAC in three groups of five rats. For each MAC, Pab was significantly reduced for all frequencies of stimulation except at 100 Hz during 0.5 MAC halothane exposure. The effects of halothane (0.5, 1, and 1.5 MAC) on diaphragmatic neuromuscular transmission were assessed in five other rats by measuring the integrated electrical activity of the diaphragm (Edi) during electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerve. No change in Edi was observed during halothane exposure. In five other rats TA contraction was studied by measuring the strength of isometric contraction of the muscle during electrical stimulation of its nerve supply at different frequencies (0.5, 30, and 100 Hz). Muscle function was unchanged during administration of halothane in a cumulative fashion from 0.5 to 1.5 MAC. These results demonstrate that halothane does not affect hindlimb muscle function, whereas it had a direct negative inotropic effect on rat diaphragmatic muscle.\r"

Left diaphragmatic function was assessed by recording the transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) generated during electrical stimulation of the left phrenic nerve at different frequencies (0.5, 30, and 100 Hz). Phrenic nerve stimulations were achieved either directly by electrodes placed around the phrenic nerve above its pericardial course or by intramuscular electrodes placed close to the phrenic nerve endings. Electrical activity of the hemidiaphragm (Edi) was recorded and phrenic nerve conduction time (PNCT) was measured during direct phrenic stimulation. A transpericardial cooling of the nerve, at 0 degrees C, on a length of 1 cm, was performed during 30 min (group A, n = 7) or 5 min (group B, n = 4). After the cooling period, phrenic and diaphragmatic functions were assessed hourly for 4 h (H1-H4). Cooling the phrenic nerve produced a complete phrenic nerve conduction block in all dogs, 100 +/- 10 s after the onset of cold exposure. Conduction recovery time was longer in group A (11 +/- 7 min) than in group B (2 +/- 0.5 min) and PNCT remained increased throughout the study in group A. Furthermore, in group A, Pdi and Edi during direct phrenic stimulation were markedly depressed from H1 to H4. No change in these parameters was noted until H3 during intramuscular stimulation, time at which a significant decrease occurred. By contrast, Pdi and Edi from direct and intramuscular stimulations remained unchanged throughout the study in group B.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

PAF was either injected into the pulmonary artery or instilled into the airway of lungs perfused with Tyrode's solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin. The effect of adding neutrophils or platelets to the perfusate was also tested. Perfusion was maintained 20-40 min after adding PAF and then a fluid filtration coefficient (Kf) was determined to assess vascular permeability. At the end of each experiment, one lung was lavaged, and the lavagate protein concentration (BALP) was determined. Wet weight-to-dry weight ratios (W/D) were determined on the other lung. PAF added to the vascular space increased peak pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) from 13.5 +/- 3.1 (mean +/- SE) to 24.2 +/- 3.3 cmH2O (P less than 0.05). The effect was amplified by platelets [Ppa to 70.8 +/- 8.0 cmH2O (P less than 0.05)] but not by neutrophils [Ppa to 22.0 +/- 1.4 cmH2O (P less than 0.05)]. Minimal changes in Ppa were observed after instilling PAF into the airway. The Kf, W/D, and BALP of untreated lungs were not increased by injecting PAF into the vasculature or into the air space. The effect of PAF on Kf, W/D, and BALP was unaltered by adding platelets or neutrophils to the perfusate. PAF increases intravascular pressure (at a constant rate of perfusion) but does not increase epithelial or endothelial permeability in isolated-perfused rabbit lungs.\r"

J. 236: 765-769, 1986). O2 uptake showed a half-maximal (K0.5) value of 0.5 Torr PO2, whereas the glucose synthesis rate was half-maximal at 1.2 Torr PO2. Halothane at concentrations greater than 1 mM exerted a parallel inhibition of O2 uptake and glucose synthesis at all PO2 levels studied. In contrast, at halothane concentrations less than 1 mM, inhibition of glucose synthesis occurred only at less than 20 Torr PO2. At these low concentrations, halothane was without significant effects on cellular O2 uptake. In isolated mitochondria, inhibition of O2 uptake was already half-maximal at a halothane concentration of 0.5 mM. In this subcellular system the inhibitory effect of halothane was independent of PO2. These results demonstrate that the critical PO2 at which cellular O2 utilization begins to decrease and the PO2 at which glucose synthesis begins to decrease are comparable; both PO2 levels are approximately 5 Torr. The metabolic zonation of the liver lobule is discussed in view of the results presented.\r"

Animals were killed and the lungs studied with fluorescence and electron microscopy. Intensity of formaldehyde-induced fluorescence, which reflects the serotonin content in NEB, was higher on the stimulated side than on the nonstimulated side (118 +/- 7 vs. 100%, n = 8, P less than 0.001). The latter difference was found to correlate with the stimulus amplitude (r = 0.9, P less than 0.05). Ultrastructurally a decrease in the number of exocytotic dense-cored vesicle (DCV) profiles at the level of the NEB basal epithelial cell membrane was found on the stimulated side (0.32 +/- 0.10 vs. 0.45 +/- 0.16 DCV/micron of basal epithelial cell membrane, n = 8, P less than 0.05). Section of the left vagus nerve without electrical stimulation affected neither the fluorescence intensity nor the number of exocytotic DCV profiles. In animals with supranodosal or infranodosal chronic vagotomy the observed effects of unilateral vagal stimulation were no longer present. We conclude that 1) vagal stimulation increases the serotonin content of NEB; 2) it decreases the number of exocytotic DCV profiles; 3) this effect depends on the amplitude of the stimulus; 4) it is obtained through efferent vagal fibers; 5) these results are the opposite of the effects seen after exposing normal NEB to acute hypoxia; and 6) these physiological experiments corroborate a vagal innervation of NEB, which may play an important role in modulating the sensitivity and reaction of NEB to various stimuli.\r"

To simulate the influence of respiratory flow on oscillatory resistance (Rosc), oscillatory and steady flow were superimposed. This resulted in a marked increase of Rosc, dependent on the value of steady flow, a change of the frequency dependence of Rosc, and a decrease of the reactance. The latter effects were particularly pronounced in the preparations of the larynx, especially with a narrow glottis opening. The influence of steady flow on oscillatory resistances is probably the expression of interactions of steady and oscillatory flow regimes in the larynx. Similar but less pronounced interactions are also met in the trachea. These effects lead to a systematic overestimation of upper airway resistance when measured during spontaneous breathing by means of a forced oscillation technique.\r"

The subjects were healthy male volunteers, 21-63 yr. Blood flows were measured by venous occlusion plethysmography using mercury-in-Silastic strain-gauges. The gauges were maintained at the same level relative to the heart during the postural changes. Arterial blood pressure was measured by auscultation; heart rate was counted from the plethysmograms. Changing from supine to sitting caused a decrease in forearm blood flow from 4.13 +/- 0.14 to 2.16 +/- 0.19 ml.100 ml-1.min-1. Corresponding calf flows were 4.21 +/- 0.32 and 4.40 +/- 0.59 ml.100 ml-1.min-1. There was no change in mean arterial blood pressure, and heart rate increased by 8.0 +/- 1.5 beats/min. Arrest of the circulation of both legs with occlusion cuffs on the thighs before sitting, to prevent pooling of blood in them, reduced the degree of forearm vasoconstriction. Neck suction (40 Torr) during sitting, to oppose the decrease in transmural pressure at the carotid sinuses, inhibited the vasoconstriction. During a 30 degrees head-down tilt, there was a dilatation of forearm but not of calf resistance vessels. A Valsalva maneuver caused a similar constriction of both vascular beds. Thus, when changes in vascular resistance in forearm and calf are compared, the major reflex adjustments to changes in posture take place in the forearm.\r"

The regional PMN retention and the rate of exchange between the marginated and circulating PMN pools in the lung were directly related to RBC transit time. The radiolabeled PMNs distributed similarly to the unlabeled cells within the microvasculature and had a similar exchange rate between the marginated and circulating pools (1.4 +/- 0.2%/s using labeled cells and 1.5 +/- 0.5%/s using unlabeled cells).

In all exercised muscles the calculated satellite cell activation was far greater than required to repair the small number (less than 3.0%) of necrotic fibers identified at the light-microscopic level. These results suggest that satellite cells were activated not only on fibers exhibiting overt necrosis but also on those with lesions not discernible with light microscopy.\r"

Six endurance-trained subjects with spinal cord lesions from T10 to T12/L3 underwent a maximal incremental exercise test in which they propelled their own track wheelchairs on a motor-driven treadmill to exhaustion to determine maximal O2 uptake (VO2max) and related variables. One week later each subject exercised in the same wheelchair on a motorized treadmill at 60-65% of VO2max for 80 min in a thermoneutral environment (dry bulb 22 degrees C, wet bulb 17 degrees C). Approximately 10 ml of venous blood were withdrawn both 20 min and immediately before exercise (0 min), after 40 and 80 min of exercise, and 20 min postexercise. Venous blood was analyzed for hematocrit (Hct), hemoglobin (Hb), and lactate, and the separated plasma was analyzed for glucose, K+, Na+, Cl-, free fatty acid (FFA), and osmolality. VO2, CO2 production (VCO2), minute ventilation (VE), respiratory exchange ratio (R), net efficiency, and wheelchair strike rate were determined at four intervals throughout the exercise period. Data were analyzed with an analysis of variance repeated-measures design and a Scheffe post hoc test. VO2max was 47.5 +/- 1.8 (SE) ml.min-1.kg-1 with maximal VE BTPS and maximal heart rate (HR) being 100.1 +/- 3.8 l/min and 190 +/- 1 beats/min, respectively. During prolonged exercise there were no significant changes in VO2, VCO2, VE, R, net efficiency, wheelchair strike rate, and lactate, glucose, and Na+ concentrations. Significant increases occurred in HR, FFA, K+, Cl-, osmolality, Hb, and Hct throughout exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Neither use of multiple points nor inclusion of the interacting term improved the performance of the RIP over that observed using a simple two-compartment model with VT measurements. However, VM coefficients obtained during quiet sleep (QS) were not reliable when used during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, suggesting that coefficients obtained during one sleep state may not be applicable to another state where there is a substantial change in the relative abdominal/rib cage contributions to VT.\r"

These changes seemed to be dependent on the autonomic nervous system, whereas the postprandial heart rate increase did not. During exercise cardiac output was 23% higher after food intake due to a rise in both stroke volume and heart rate. These changes were apparently under influence of the autonomic nervous system, whereas left ventricular dilation was not.

  ".W": "Usually the wall opposite the orifice of alveoli has been used to study interalveolar pores by scanning electron microscopy. To ascertain whether biased results may be obtained from this, the distribution of pores within alveoli was studied in human lungs. By the use of scanning electron photomicrographs, the number, major axes of pores, and proportional area of pores to the alveolar wall were estimated. The alveolar wall seen opposite the orifice was defined as the bottom wall. Average number of pores per alveolus was 13-21, and one-half of them was located in the bottom walls. The average length of major axes was 7-19 micron, and average area fractions were 0.8-5%. The distribution of the numerical density, area fraction, and size of pores was uniform regardless of their location within the alveolus and the size of alveoli. Thus pores can be compared using the bottom walls of alveoli. This will facilitate the study of the effects of age, smoking, and topography on pore size and frequency in humans.\r"

  ".U": "88086653\r", 
  ".W": "There is considerable interindividual variation in ventilatory response to hypoxia in humans but the mechanism remains unknown. To examine the potential contribution of variable peripheral chemorecptor function to variation in hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR), we compared the peripheral chemoreceptor and ventilatory response to hypoxia in 51 anesthetized cats. We found large interindividual differences in HVR spanning a sevenfold range. In 23 cats studied on two separate days, ventilatory measurements were correlated (r = 0.54, P less than 0.01), suggesting stable interindividual differences. Measurements during wakefulness and in anesthesia in nine cats showed that although anesthesia lowered the absolute HVR it had no influence on the range or the rank of the magnitude of the response of individuals in the group. We observed a positive correlation between ventilatory and carotid sinus nerve (CSN) responses to hypoxia measured during anesthesia in 51 cats (r = 0.63, P less than 0.001). To assess the translation of peripheral chemoreceptor activity into expiratory minute ventilation (VE) we used an index relating the increase of VE to the increase of CSN activity for a given hypoxic stimulus (delta VE/delta CSN). Comparison of this index for cats with lowest (n = 5, HVR A = 7.0 +/- 0.8) and cats with highest (n = 5, HVR A = 53.2 +/- 4.9) ventilatory responses showed similar efficiency of central translation (0.72 +/- 0.06 and 0.70 +/- 0.08, respectively). These results indicate that interindividual variation in HVR is associated with comparable variation in hypoxic sensitivity of carotid bodies. Thus differences in peripheral chemoreceptor sensitivity may contribute to interindividual variability of HVR.\r"

We found a uniform increase in extravascular lung density in the patients with acute interstitial edema but a preferentially dependent distribution in the patients with alveolar edema. Fractional blood volume had an abnormally uniform distribution in patients with interstitial edema. In alveolar edema, there was marked redistribution of blood volume away from severely edematous regions. The results are in agreement with previous experimental work with animal models. The distribution of extravascular lung density and fractional blood volume in subjects with acute interstitial edema is, however, different from that found in subjects with chronic interstitial edema, suggesting that the pathophysiological characteristics of the two conditions may be different.\r"

A cooling coil was placed around eight fetal sheep of 132-145 days gestation; thermistors were placed in the fetal esophagus and maternal iliac artery, vascular catheters and a tracheal catheter were inserted, and a snare was placed loosely around the umbilical cord. The next day cold water was circulated through the coil for 5 h. During the 1st h of cooling alone, fetal core temperature fell 2.79 degrees C, but indexes of brown fat activity increased only slightly. After ventilation with O2, plasma free fatty acid concentration (FFA) rose 7.4-fold to 244 +/- 42 mu eq/l, glycerol concentration rose fourfold to 376 +/- 85 microM, and the difference between brown fat and core temperature widened to 0.60 +/- 0.10 degrees C. Ventilation with N2-enriched air did not evoke similar responses. After snaring the umbilical cord while ventilation was continued, FFA rose to 554 +/- 95 mu eq/l, glycerol rose to 684 +/- 76 microM, and the temperature difference widened to 0.77 +/- 0.13 degrees C. Whole-body O2 consumption peaked at 19.6 ml.min-1.kg-1 of fetal tissue. We conclude that fetal thermogenic responses are limited in part by O2 delivery to brown fat and are augmented by occlusion of the umbilical cord.\r"

In model 1, rats were swum in a water bath at 33 degrees C for 30 min, which increased tidal volume (VT) approximately 300% and frequency 60%; they were then allowed to rest for up to 4 h. In model 2, rats were exposed to 5% CO2-13% O2-82% N2 for 24 h, which increased both VT and frequency approximately 200%; these rats were then rested for up to 24 h. In both models we harvested a tissue fraction (lamellar bodies, lb) and two alveolar fractions--tubular myelin rich (alv-1) and tubular myelin poor (alv-2). Immediately after swimming, lb-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPClb) was 18% below the control of 0.94 +/- 0.037 (SE) mg/g wet lung (n = 24 rats; P less than 0.05); this returned to control by 2 h. Whereas DPPCalv-1 was constant at all time points, DPPCalv-2 was increased 50% above the control of 2.68 +/- 0.085 mg/g dry lung (n = 27 rats; P less than 0.001) immediately and up to 1 h after swimming. It returned to control levels between 2 and 3 h. After gas exposure, DPPC in lb, alv-1, and alv-2 was 33, 64, and 89%, respectively, above controls. All three fractions had normalized after 24 h. Our results demonstrate marked differences in the response of the surfactant system to acute and more prolonged stimuli. Of particular interest was the constancy of alv-1 with swimming, suggesting that it may be the controlled variable. However, the system appeared to be reset by prolonged hyperpnea, a process that may involve an increase in synthesis of surfactant.\r"

  ".W": "Using liquid-filled catheters, we recorded, in 30 anesthetized, spontaneously breathing supine rabbits, the hydraulic pressure from the parietal subpleural interstitial space (Pspl). Through a small exposed area of parietal pleura a plastic catheter (1 mm ED), with a closed and smooth tip and several holes on the last centimeter, was carefully advanced between the muscular layer and the parietal pleura, tangentially to the pleural surface to reach the submesothelial layer. Simultaneous measurements of pleural liquid pressure (Pliq) were obtained from intrapleurally placed cannulas. End-expiratory Pspl decreased (became more negative) with increasing height (LH) according to the following: Pspl (cmH2O) = -1 - 0.4 LH (cm), the corresponding equation for Pliq being Pliq (cmH2O) = -1.5 - 0.7 LH (cm). Thus at end expiration a transpleural hydraulic pressure difference (Pliq-Pspl) developed at any height, increasing from the bottom to the top of the cavity as Pliq - Pspl (cmH2O) = -0.5 - 0.3 LH (cm). The Pliq-Pspl difference increased during inspiration due to the much smaller tidal change in Pspl than in Pliq. By considering the gravity-dependent distribution of the functional hydrostatic pressure in the systemic capillaries of the pleura (Pc) and the Pspl and Pliq values integrated over the respiratory cycle we estimated that on the average, the Pc-Pspl difference is sevenfold larger than the Pspl-Pliq difference.\r"

At this time a switch was performed to a mixture with 30% H2, and 8 h later a second switch was performed to 0% H2. In the H2-He-O2 mixture the clinical symptoms of high-pressure nervous syndrome (HPNS) were not present and the electroencephalogram changes were slight. The switch of the mixture induced an isobaric HPNS of high intensity. Twenty-four hours later the HPNS decreased, but the clinical symptoms persisted throughout the stay in the He-O2 mixture. The appearance of isobaric HPNS during the switch might be due to the disappearance of the narcotic substance which suppressed or masked the clinical symptoms; it might also be due to the sudden increase in the partial pressure of He, which was equivalent to a fast compression.\r"

Maximal O2 consumption was significantly increased 10% after training. The left carotid sinus region was functionally isolated in anesthetized animals. Subsequently, static carotid sinus pressure was raised in 20-Torr increments from 95 Torr until a maximal response in systemic arterial pressure and regional blood flows was recorded. Compared with the NT group, baroreflex control of blood pressure and calculated regional resistance of the T animals was less responsive to changes in carotid sinus pressure. Resting blood pressure, heart rate, and changes in peripheral blood flow velocity were similar for the two groups. Peripheral sensitivity to phenylephrine-HCl and hexamethonium bromide were also similar in the T and NT groups. It was concluded that the arterial baroreflex control of blood pressure was attenuated by exercise training. These findings support the concept that the trained individual is at disadvantage during hypotensive episodes and that endurance training will attenuate the sympathetic component of the arterial baroreflex.\r"

To assess whether they are indeed equivalent, 14 healthy subjects underwent gated blood pool scintigraphy during two maximal upright exercise periods separated by 60 min without changing position. Although resting cardiac output and blood pressure returned to base-line values 60 min after the first exercise period, mean resting heart rate was markedly higher (89.4 +/- 2.7 vs. 66.5 +/- 2.5 beats/min, P less than 0.001) and upright cardiac volumes lower [39.1 +/- 4.9 vs. 56.3 +/- 6.0 ml, P less than 0.001, for end-systolic volume (ESV) and 112.6 +/- 8.0 vs. 144.9 +/- 9.0 ml, P less than 0.001, for end-diastolic volume (EDV)] than before the first exercise period. These differences persisted during low levels of the subsequent exercise but not at high and maximum work loads. Cardiac volumes and heart rate 60 min after an identical exercise protocol in a second group of 22 subjects who received propranolol, 0.15 mg/kg iv, after their initial exercise, however, were the same as those preexercise. Thus higher sympathetic tone may be responsible for the persistently higher heart rate and decreased cardiac volumes after exercise, and the assumption that cardiac volumes and function are similar during two closely spaced sequential exercise studies is not always valid.\r"

Twelve men (19-41 yr) ran an equivalent distance (9-12 km) on a treadmill on two separate occasions. On one occasion the exercise was performed at a speed that elicited 60% of the subject's maximal O2 uptake (VO2max), and on the other occasion exercise was performed at a speed that elicited 90% of VO2max. Changes in total cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), HDL-C, HDL apoprotein A (HDL-A), HDL saturation, lactate (LA), and free fatty acids (FFA) were measured during the course of each run, and all values were corrected for changes in plasma volume as indicated by hematocrit. There were significant increases (P less than 0.01) in HDL-C, HDL-A, and HDL saturation with exercise at both intensities, but greater increases in HDL-C (25 vs. 14%) and HDL-A (18 vs. 8%) were observed with the higher intensity exercise. Plasma FFA and TG did not differ between conditions, but LA concentrations rose significantly during the high-intensity exercise. These results indicate that increases in HDL components can occur with a relatively moderate exercise session and that the magnitude of these increases are directly related to the exercise intensity.\r"

The uptake per cell decreased as cell density increased and was lowest when the cells became fully confluent. Most of the uptake was sodium dependent, although the relative contribution of sodium-independent uptake increased with an increase in cell density. Cysteic and aspartic acid strongly inhibited L-glutamic acid uptake, but at higher cell densities this effect was less pronounced than at low densities. Other amino acids, including leucine, glutamine, and serine, exerted a modest inhibitory effect at both high and low cell densities. Thus pulmonary arterial endothelial cells contain similar membrane transport systems for L-glutamic acid as those previously described for fibroblasts, hepatocytes, and nerve cells. However, quantitative properties of the transport systems differ depending on the state of cellular density in monolayers.\r"

The rate of uptake of [3H]glutamic acid also increased by 35-55% after 24 h of exposure of cells to hyperoxia, whereas exposure to hypoxia had no effect on the [3H]glutamic acid uptake. The increase in glutamic acid uptake reflected a specific effect on amino acid transport systems rather than a change in cell membrane permeability. The major portion of the increased uptake was inhibited by the elimination of sodium and the addition of the competitive inhibitor, cystine, to the incubation medium. Thus increases in glutamic acid uptake parallel increases in cellular glutathione, and glutamic acid may be a regulating factor in the increase in glutathione after exposure to hyperoxia.\r"

ACE activity was estimated in vivo from the single-pass transpulmonary metabolism of the synthetic substrate [3H]benzoyl-Phe-Ala-Pro [( 3H]BPAP) under first-order reaction conditions. Within 5 min after PMA administration, all animals developed profound granulocytopenia (15% of control) and moderate thrombocytopenia (57% of control), both lasting for the duration of the experiment. Concomitantly, there was a significant decrease in the transpulmonary metabolism of [3H]BPAP and the calculated apparent first-order reaction constant Amax/Km of ACE for [3H]BPAP. No histological evidence of lung injury was observed at these times. Since a concomitant fall in the permeability surface area product for urea was also observed, we considered that the apparent decline in ACE activity might have resulted from a reduction in perfused endothelial surface area. To resolve this, we studied the effect of PMA on the Km (a measure of enzyme affinity for its substrate) and Amax (a derivative of Vmax that is dependent upon total enzyme present and thus capillary surface area) of ACE and 5'-nucleotidase for [3H]BPAP and [14C]AMP, respectively. A significant increase in Km for both enzymes was observed at 1 h after PMA, whereas Amax was unaffected, suggesting that low-dose PMA may indeed produce endothelial cell enzyme dysfunction independent of its effect on capillary surface area. These results provide evidence of pulmonary capillary functional injury before or in the absence of structural endothelial damage.\r"

When instilled into the airspace at initial concentrations of 8-128 micrograms/ml, lysoPC causes dose-dependent increases in the permeability-surface area product of the alveolar epithelium for small (14C-sucrose, 342) and large (125I-neutral dextran, 70,000) solutes, with maximal values for each solute approximately 15 times control. Rapid whole-lung weight gains are caused by 128 micrograms lysoPC per milliliter, but each of the lower concentrations has no effect on net lung water balance. Electron-microscopic studies demonstrate that type I pneumonocytes are the lung cells most susceptible to lysoPC exposure, with cell swelling being the most prominent feature from low-dose exposure with more severe disruptive changes at the highest concentration tested. The effects of lysoPC are relatively specific, as several structurally related lipids have little or no effect at equivalent concentrations. Instillation of phospholipase A2 causes functional changes similar to those seen with lysoPC, presumably by generation of lysoPC from endogenous phospholipids. Studies employing a 14C-radiolabeled compound show that instilled lysoPC rapidly partitions into the lung lipid fraction where a major portion of the acyl group becomes incorporated into phosphatidylcholine. The amount of instilled lysoPC required to produce functional and morphological effects comprises only a few percent of total lung phospholipids. Since lysoPC is a normal component of lung phospholipids, severe lung dysfunction might result from minor abnormalities in the formation or degradation of this compound.\r"

Capillary permeability was determined by tissue 125I-albumin accumulation in isolated perfused rat lungs. In control lungs the 5-min albumin uptake was 0.50 +/- 0.05 cm3.s-1.g dry tissue-1 X 10(-3). It was increased by 132 +/- 7.8% (P less than 0.001) by protamine (0.08 mg/ml) and 65 +/- 12% (P less than 0.01) by heparinase (5 U/ml), whereas hyaluronidase (25 NFU/ml) was without effect. In control lungs total water was 4.83 +/- 0.15 ml g/dry tissue. Protamine increased lung water 12 +/- 2% (P less than 0.05). Heparinase caused a 9 +/- 3% increase (P less than 0.05), and hyaluronidase had no effect. Electron microscopy demonstrated that protamine increased anionic ferritin binding to the surface of endothelial cells. We conclude that protamine sulfate neutralization of negative charge in the pulmonary microcirculation leads to increased microvascular permeability. Heparin sulfate may be responsible for this charge effect.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the direct effects of thrombin on pulmonary vasomotor tone in isolated guinea pig lungs perfused with Ringer albumin (0.5% g/100 ml). The injection of alpha-thrombin (the native enzyme) resulted in rapid dose-dependent increases in pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) and pulmonary capillary pressure (Ppc), which were associated with an increase in the lung effluent thromboxane B2 concentration. The Ppa and Ppc responses decreased with time but then increased again within 40 min after thrombin injection. The increases in Ppc were primarily the result of postcapillary vasoconstriction. Pulmonary edema as evidenced by marked increases (60% from base line) in lung weight occurred within 90 min after thrombin injection. Injection of modified thrombins (i.e., gamma-thrombin lacking the fibrinogen recognition site or i-Pr2P-alpha-thrombin lacking the serine proteolytic site) was not associated with pulmonary hemodynamic or weight changes nor did they block the effects of alpha-thrombin. Indomethacin (a cyclooxygenase inhibitor), dazoxiben (a thromboxane synthase inhibitor), or hirudin (a thrombin antagonist) inhibited the thrombin-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction, as well as the pulmonary edema. We conclude that thrombin-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction is primarily the result of constriction of postcapillary vessels, and the response is mediated by generation of cyclooxygenase-derived metabolites. The edema formation is also dependent on activation of the cyclooxygenase pathway. The proteolytic site of alpha-thrombin is required for the pulmonary vasoconstrictor and edemogenic responses.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of hydrodynamic shear stress on the adhesive interaction between neutrophils and endothelial cells in vitro was investigated using an apparatus similar to a cone-in-plate viscometer. Isolated bovine neutrophils were labeled with 111In and incubated with monolayers of cultured bovine pulmonary arterial endothelial cells in the presence of different degrees of shear stress. Physiologically relevant shear (less than 2 dyn/cm2) was associated with marked decrease in neutrophil adherence. Stimulation with 10% bovine zymosan-activated plasma increased adherence under static conditions but failed to increase adherence conducted during the application of shear stress. Inhibition of endothelial cell prostacyclin production by meclofenamate or aspirin failed to alter the response to shear. Incubation of neutrophils under static conditions for 10, but not 5, min however, markedly enhanced subsequent resistance to shear, suggesting that a time-dependent reaction between neutrophil and endothelial cell was required to induce an increase in the strength of adherence. Analysis of neutrophil migration underneath the monolayer indicated that such migration in no way accounted for resistance to shear, particularly since shear resistance was enhanced on serum-coated plastic as well as endothelial cells. We conclude that hemodynamic factors may play an important role in modulating neutrophil adherence to endothelium in both normal and inflammatory states.\r"

  ".W": "Within individuals, lung size as assessed by total lung capacity (TLC) or vital capacity (VC) appears to be unrelated to airway size as assessed physiologically by maximum expiratory flows (MEF). Green et al. (J. Appl. Physiol. 37: 67-74, 1974) coined the term dysanapsis (unequal growth) to express this apparent interindividual discrepancy between parenchymal and airway size. We have reexamined this discrepancy using both physiological and anatomic indexes of airway size. Airway area by acoustic reflectance (AAAR), peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR), MEF, and lung volumes were measured in 26 male and 28 female healthy nonsmoking adults. The effect of sex on these indexes of large airway size was significant when assessed in a subset of males and females whose TLC's were matched (5.0-6.5 liters). Within this subset, male AAAR was 2.79 +/- 0.45 cm2, whereas female AAAR was 1.99 +/- 0.67 cm2 (P less than 0.01). Male's PEFR and MEF after 25% of VC had been expired (MEF25) were 23% greater than those of females within this subset (P less than 0.05). For the entire group of subjects, once these sex-related differences had been accounted for, AAAR was not significantly related to TLC, whereas PEFR and MEF25 remained at best weakly related to TLC. We conclude that tracheal areas in males are significantly larger than those of females even after controlling for TLC and that after controlling for sex-related differences, tracheal size in adults is unrelated to lung size across a broad range of lung sizes.\r"

Plantaris muscles of female adrenalectomized rats, enlarged by surgical removal of synergists, were 60% heavier and had higher glucocorticoid cytosol binding (125 +/- 14 vs. 79 +/- 8 fmol/mg protein) than these muscles of controls. Activation, which was quantitated by the ability of the steroid-receptor complex to bind to DNA, was similar in overloaded and control muscles (57 +/- 2 vs. 62 +/- 4%). Diethylaminoethyl-cellulose chromatography of activated receptors showed approximately 16% of the radioactivity appearing as binder II and 38% as binder IB in both hypertrophied and control muscles. These results show that although enlarged plantaris muscles are undergoing certain fast- to slow-twitch biochemical transformations, the activated glucocorticoid-receptor distribution does not shift to that observed in slow fibers.\r"

Three work rates were studied in each of four sessions (either 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 or 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5 W), with measurements made before and during each bout, thereby permitting the partition of the variance attributable to rest, work-dependent, and time-dependent metabolic functions by regression analysis. There were no time-dependent changes in either [ATP] or intracellular [H+] as assessed during the rest intervals between bouts of exercise. In contrast, the total nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-visible phosphorus pool (TVPP) decreased with time, with both phosphocreatine (PCr) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) contributing significantly to TVPP reduction. Muscle [ATP] was unchanged by work at all intensities. Intracellular [H+] increased moderately and proportionately to work rate. [PCr] decreased and [Pi] increased in proportion to work rate, with the work-dependent coefficient for PCr consumption approximately 1.5 times that of Pi production. Neither Pi line width nor motion artifact accounted for the decrease in TVPP, so the reduced Pi accumulation in exercise may represent its sequestering in some NMR-invisible muscle pool and/or loss to the blood. Whatever the process involved, it is proportional to work rate and persists for at least 10-15 min after exercise.\r"

D2O concentration was measured in plasma and saliva samples taken at various intervals after ingestion of 20 ml of D2O mixed with five solutions differing in carbohydrate and electrolyte concentrations. An infrared spectrometer was used to measure D2O in purified samples obtained after a 48-h incubation period during which the water (D2O and H2O) in the sample was equilibrated with an equal volume of distilled water in a sealed diffusion dish. The procedure yields 100% recoveries of 60-500 ppm D2O with an average precision of 5%. When compared with values for distilled water, D2O accumulation in serial samples of plasma and saliva was slower for ingested solutions containing 40 and 15% glucose and faster for hypotonic saline and a 6% carbohydrate-electrolyte solution. These differences appear to reflect known differences in gastric emptying and intestinal absorption of these beverages. Therefore this technique may provide a useful index of the rate of water uptake from ingested beverages into the body fluids.\r"

The present study was concerned with the quantitative and temporal properties of ventilation during sleep onset. Sleep onsets were studied in five young male adults in a series of single-subject designs in which sleep onsets were replications. The results indicated that during sleep onset the loss of alpha-activity in the electroencephalogram was associated with a substantial, rapid, and highly predictable reduction in ventilation. The change in ventilation was typically due to a reduction in tidal volume and was, in part, secondary to a reduction in metabolic rate. We speculate that the nonmetabolic component may reflect the loss of waking neural drive to respiration, though the present study did not eliminate a variety of other interpretations.\r"

The method assumes that radial conduction of heat from the mucosal wall to inspired air dominates heat exchange during a breath-hold maneuver and uses a simplified conservation of energy analysis to extrapolate wall temperatures from air temperature vs. time profiles. Validation studies were performed by simultaneously measuring air and wall temperatures by use of a retractable basket probe in the upper airways of human volunteers and intrathoracic airways of paralyzed intubated dogs during breath holding. In both protocols, a good correlation was demonstrated between directly measured wall temperatures and those calculated from adjacent airstream temperature vs. time profiles during a breath hold. We then calculated intrathoracic bronchial wall temperatures from breath-hold airstream temperature-time profiles recorded in normal human subjects after cold air hyperpnea at 30 and 80 l/min. The calculations show airway wall temperatures in the upper intrathoracic airways that are below core body temperature during hyperpnea of frigid air and upper thoracic airways that are cooler than more peripheral airways. The data suggest that the magnitude of local intrathoracic heat/water flux is not represented by heat/water loss measurements at the airway opening. Both the magnitude and locus of heat transport during cold gas hyperventilation vary with changes in inspired gas temperature and minute ventilation; both may be important determinants of airway responses.\r"

  ".W": "Three adult skeletal muscle sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (MHC) genes have been identified in the rat, suggesting that the expressed native myosin isoforms can be differentiated, in part, on the basis of their MHC composition. This study was undertaken to ascertain whether the five major native isomyosins [3 fast (Fm1, Fm2, Fm3), 1 slow (Sm), and 1 intermediate (Im)], typically expressed in the spectrum of adult rat skeletal muscles comprising the hindlimb, could be further differentiated on the basis of their MHC profiles in addition to their light chain composition. Results show that in muscles comprised exclusively of fast-twitch glycolytic (FG) fibers and consisting of Fm1, Fm2, and Fm3, such as the tensor fasciae latae, only one MHC, designated as fast type IIb, could be resolved. In soleus muscle, comprised of both slow-twitch oxidative and fast-twitch oxidative-glycolytic fibers and expressing Sm and Im, two MHC bands were resolved and designated as slow/cardiac beta-MHC and fast type IIa MHC. In muscles expressing a mixture of all three fiber types and a full complement of isomyosins, as seen in the plantaris, the MHC could be resolved into three bands. Light chain profiles were characterized for each muscle type, as well as for the purified isomyosins. These data suggest that Im (IIa) consists of a mixture of fast and slow light chains, whereas Fm (IIb) and Sm (beta) isoforms consist solely of fast- and slow-type light chains, respectively. Polypeptide mapping of denatured myosin extracted from muscles expressing contrasting isoform phenotypes suggests differences in the MHC primary structure between slow, intermediate, and fast myosin isotypes. These findings demonstrate that 1) Fm, Im, and Sm isoforms are differentiated on the bases of both their heavy and light chain components and 2) each isomyosin is distributed in a characteristic fashion among rat hindlimb skeletal muscles. Furthermore, these data suggest that the ratio of isomyosins in a given muscle or muscle region is of physiological importance to the function of that muscle during muscular activity.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to ascertain the time course of change during both compensatory growth (hypertrophy) and subsequent growth regression on myosin isoform expression in rodent fast-twitch plantaris muscle in response to functional overload (induced by removal of synergists). Peak hypertrophy of the plantaris muscle (92%) occurred after 9 wk of overload. After 7 wk of overload regression (induced by a model of hindlimb unweighting), muscle weight returned to within 30% of control values. Myofibril protein content (mg/g muscle) remained relatively constant throughout the overload period but became significantly depressed relative to control values after 7 wk of regression. However, when expressed on a per muscle basis (mg/muscle) no differences existed at this time point (t = 7 wk regression). The distribution of native myosin isoforms in the myofibril protein pool of the overloaded plantaris muscle reflected a progressive increase (23% at t = 9 wk; P less than 0.001) in the relative proportion of slow myosin (Sm). This change was also accompanied by increases in intermediate myosin (Im) as well as the repression of the fast myosin one (Fm1) isoform (P less than 0.001). These shifts in Sm and Fm1 isoform expression were gradually reversed during the regression period, whereas Im remained elevated relative to control values. These adaptive changes in myosin isoform expression during both hypertrophy and regression were further supported by concomitant shifts in both myosin adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase) activity (decreased during overload) and slow myosin light chain (SLC) expression. However, during regression the changes in myosin isoform expression and myosin ATPase were not as synchronous as they were during overload. Estimation of the mixed myosin heavy chain (MHC) half-life (t 1/2), using a linear model that assumes zero-order synthesis and first-order degradation kinetics, revealed t 1/2 values of approximately 19 and 10 days for the overload and regression periods, respectively. Collectively these data suggest that 1) skeletal muscle myosin isoforms and corresponding ATPase activity are in a dynamic state of change, although not completely synchronous, in response to altered muscle stress, and 2) the kinetics of change in the mixed MHC protein pool are slower during compensatory growth compared with regression of growth.\r"

This paper presents a technique whereby the activity of single phrenic nerve afferents can be recorded from uncut dorsal root filaments. Cervical dorsal roots 4, 5, and 6 were exposed by dorsal laminectomy in 10 anesthetized, spontaneously breathing cats. A stimulating electrode was placed on the right whole phrenic nerve low in the neck. The animal was then placed in a spinal suspension frame. Dissection of the dorsal root filaments was performed with probes made of fine tungsten wire. Single filaments were isolated intact from the dorsal root fascicles and placed across a tungsten electrode. Fiber classification was performed by determining conduction velocity. Monopolar recordings were made from a total of 38 fibers. Tonic activity was observed in 21, respiratory-related activity was evident in 15, and two fibers were silent but could be recruited by phrenic nerve stimulation. The conduction velocities ranged from 2.2 to 103 m/s. Approximately one-half of the fibers had conduction velocities of less than 20 m/s. This technique offers a way to record the activity of diaphragm afferents while maintaining the integrity of possible reflex pathways. Application of this method should prove helpful in elucidating the possible role of the various diaphragm afferents in the control of respiratory motor drive.\r"

The delay of the system is found first from the cross-correlation function of a step change and its response. A two-sided time-domain digital correction filter (deconvolution filter) is generated next from the same step response data using a regression procedure. Other data are corrected using the filter and delay. The mean squared error between a step response and a step is reduced considerably more after the use of a deconvolution filter than after the application of a second-order model correction. O2 consumption and CO2 production values calculated from data corrupted by a simulated dynamic process return to near the uncorrupted values after correction. Although a clean step response or the ensemble average of several responses contaminated with noise is needed for the generation of the filter, random noise of magnitude less than or equal to 0.5% added to the response to be corrected does not impair the correction severely.\r"

The fibers were constructed as square and hexagonal arrays, and the placement of capillaries around the perimeters of the fibers ordered them in similar arrays. Diffusion distances were measured as the percent cumulative frequency of fiber area within a given distance of a capillary when capillary-to-fiber ratio was increased from 0.5 to 4.0. Equations fitted to the data make it possible to estimate diffusion distances in muscle and to correlate changes in diffusion distances with fiber growth, capillary growth, and the geometrical arrangement of capillaries in the muscle bed.\r"

We found that lungs isolated from rats fed a tungsten-rich diet had negligible XO activities and after exposure to hyperoxia developed less acute edematous injury during perfusion with buffer or purified neutrophil elastase than XO-replete lungs from control rats which had been exposed to hyperoxia. In parallel, tungsten-treated XO-depleted cultured bovine pulmonary arterial endothelial cells made less superoxide anion and as monolayers leaked less 125I-labeled albumin after exposure to neutrophil elastase than XO-replete endothelial cell monolayers. Our findings suggest that XO-derived O2 metabolites contribute to acute edematous lung injury from hyperoxia directly and by enhancing susceptibility to neutrophil elastase.\r"

Each was asked to state whether or not key diagnostic features were present before giving a final dysplasia score for the second assessment. Only minor interobserver and intraobserver disagreements were recorded. Pathologists were most consistent at recognising back to back glands, villous mucosal architecture, hyperchromatic nuclei, stratification of nuclei, regenerative nuclei and loss of nuclear polarity. There was poor interobserver agreement in assessing dystrophic goblet cells and columnar mucous cells. Back to back glands, hyperchromatic nuclei, loss of nuclear polarity, stratification of nuclei and columnar mucous cells were considered to be the most important features for determining the severity of dysplasia. As there was poor interobserver agreement in assessing columnar mucous cells and dystrophic goblet cells these features need to be more clearly defined or should be removed from the SC.\r"

Only two of these 174 patients developed gastric adenocarcinoma over the next 10 to 11 years: one with type II and one with type III intestinal metaplasia. Case notes of a separate group of 68 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma diagnosed in 1985 were reviewed for evidence of intestinal metaplasia in a previous gastric biopsy. Only two patients had previously been biopsied; one of these biopsy specimens showed type II intestinal metaplasia and the other showed no intestinal metaplasia. These findings suggest that subtyping of intestinal metaplasia in endoscopic gastric biopsy specimens is of only limited value in identifying patients at risk of gastric adenocarcinoma who require long term follow up.\r"

Its expansion is being hindered by lack of funds for reagents and staff. In a few regions attempts are being made to rationalise expenditure and coordinate development of the service.

In normal endometrium, glands which are not mechanically disrupted have almost entirely continuous basement membranes, even in the menstrual phase. This is also seen in benign cystic hyperplasia. In atypical hyperplasia a small proportion of glands show small breaks in basement membrane staining in the absence of invasion. The number of breaks increases with more severe cytological changes, and this abnormality may persist even when a second biopsy specimen shows an apparent return to normal morphology. Invasive tumours show a strikingly different pattern of basement membrane staining, even when very well differentiated.\r"

  ".W": "The cytological features of testicular germ cell tumours were established in smears from 15 freshly resected tumours. These features were applied to the fine needle aspiration cytology diagnosis of metastases in 27 patients referred for chemotherapy. There were 16 positive reports in 32 aspirates of which 13 were taken before chemotherapy and three in patients with residual or new masses after chemotherapy. Teratomas and typical seminomas showed certain characteristic morphological features in cytological preparations which when present in fine needle aspiration cytology material enabled tumour types to be diagnosed. Spermatocytic and anaplastic seminoma were not represented in this series. It is unlikely that these could be distinguished from malignant teratoma undifferentiated (MTU) in the fine needle aspiration cytology material. Metastases from carcinomatous areas in MTU and malignant teratoma intermediate (MTI) may not be distinguishable in fine needle aspiration cytology material from metastatic adenocarcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma from a different primary site. Positive cytological findings are of value to the oncologist in the management of patients with metastases from testicular germ cell tumours; negative cytology does not exclude the presence of viable tumour. The sampling of small foci of viable tumour in large necrotic masses persisting after chemotherapy is a problem for radiologists, cytologists, and histopathologists. This paper does not advocate the use of fine needle aspiration cytology for the diagnosis of primary testicular tumour.\r"

There was a noticeable difference in the ALT distribution between male and female donors: mean +2.25 SD for male donors was 55.3 IU/l, while that for female donors was 30.8 IU/l at 37 degrees C. In stability studies the optimal temperature for short term storage (10 days) was 4 degrees C (6.4% loss of activity after 10 days). Surprisingly, storage at lower temperatures (-35 degrees C and -80 degrees C) resulted in greater loss of activity.\r"

A second increase in lipopolysaccharides started at 42 degrees C and reached 0.308 (0.038) ng/ml (p less than 0.01) at 44.5 degrees C. Before heat stress the plasma lipopolysaccharide concentration in the primates who had been pretreated with kanamycin was 0.007 (0.006) ng/ml, and despite heating these animals to 44.5 degrees C no increase in plasma lipopolysaccharide concentrations were seen in this group. The cardiovascular variable during heat stress were more unstable in the control group and began to deteriorate at a lower temperature than in the group receiving antibiotic.

Immunologic studies included skin prick tests, serum-specific IgE (RAST), and specific IgG (ELISA) to solutions prepared from commercial food allergens: factory-powdered egg white and yolk products and purified egg white fractions, including ovalbumin, ovomucoid, lysozyme, and conalbumin. Six workers had significant daily PEFR lability (greater than 20%) of whom five had associated cutaneous reactivity to at least one egg allergen. A diagnosis of \"definite asthma\" was established in five workers suspected by the physician of having asthma. These five workers exhibited significant decrements in daily PEFR that were accompanied by bronchial symptoms. Occupational asthma was diagnosed by the physician in four of the five latter workers. Definite asthma was significantly associated with both cutaneous reactivity to egg allergens (p less than 0.01) and RAST binding (p less than 0.01). Of eight workers with cutaneous reactivity to at least one egg reagent, four workers (50%) were positive to only purified egg white fractions. The highest levels of RAST binding were detected in four workers, and the best binding activity was to ovomucoid and ovalbumin fractions. Elevated specific IgG responses were significantly higher in egg-factory workers to whole egg (p less than 0.005), lysozyme (p less than 0.002), and conalbumin (p less than 0.002) allergens compared to responses of nonexposed control subjects. However, no differences in specific IgG were detected between symptomatic and asymptomatic workers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The need for frequent hospital visits for treatment and high cost remain significant problems. To surmount these problems, we developed a program of patient/family-performed home administration of intravenous immune globulin. Fourteen patients were selected with predetermined eligibility criteria. Nine patients chose to enter the study. Patients and/or relatives were taught the technique of intravenous administration. A signed agreement to perform the infusion under physician instructions was required. All patients successfully performed home treatment, with an average of 19 infusions completed per patient (range 10 to 24). Home treatment decreased absence from work and school. Another benefit noted was a better self-image for patients who require life-long therapy. Regular follow-up visits with the physician are important for adequate care of patients. We conclude that home self-administration of intravenous immune globulin is feasible, safe, and effective in selected patients.\r"

  ".W": "Since inhibition of cyclooxygenase precipitates asthmatic attacks in patients with aspirin idiosyncrasy, we have evaluated the effects of pharmacologic inhibition of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) synthetase, next to cyclooxygenase enzyme in arachidonic acid cascade. Sixteen patients with aspirin-induced asthma received increasing doses on 3 days (25 to 400 mg) of an imidazole derivative, OKY-046, which specifically blocks TXA2 synthetase. Twenty-three healthy control subjects received a single dose of 400 mg of OKY-046. In both patients and control subjects, the inhibitor at a dose of 400 mg produced (1) a pronounced fall in thromboxane B2 serum levels, (2) a rise in serum 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, and (3) a depression in platelet aggregability to arachidonic acid and adenosine diphosphate. The drug, however, neither precipitated attacks of asthma nor impaired pulmonary function tests throughout a 24-hour observation period. Five patients, but none of the control subjects, developed transient nasal congestion about 1 hour after taking the drug. Thus, inhibition of TXA2 synthetase, contrary to inhibition of cyclooxygenase, does not affect bronchopulmonary function in patients with asthma and aspirin intolerance.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-seven patients with hereditary angioedema, who, without therapy, had attacks of cutaneous angioedema, gastrointestinal colic, and/or upper respiratory symptoms at a frequency and severity sufficient to prompt treatment with an attenuated androgen, have been evaluated for the incidence of side effects and biochemical toxicity during various schedules leading to the minimal effective dose. Stanozolol was administered in a 2 mg daily dose, initially, and after the symptoms and signs were adequately controlled for 2 months at this dose or at 1 mg per day, the drug was administered every other day at 4 mg. Patients who responded adequately to this schedule were administered 2 or 1 mg every other day, and then the interval between doses was gradually increased to 1 week, after which the agent was stopped. Eighteen patients experienced adverse reactions to stanozolol while the minimal effective dose was attained. In each instance the side effect subsided with a reduction in dosage. The most common adverse reactions were biochemical evidence of hepatic dysfunction and, to a lesser extent, hirsutism and menstrual irregularities. Although 21 of 27 patients in an initial study of the minimal effective dose were maintained with daily therapy in 1980, by 1986 this group and 10 additional patients were distributed so that three patients were receiving daily maintenance, 18 were receiving alternate-day maintenance, and 16 patients were receiving no maintenance therapy [corrected]. Thus, stanozolol appears to be a safe and effective agent for management of hereditary angioedema when patients are continually monitored to define the minimal effective dose or the feasibility of stopping the drug.\r"

Although normal manufacture of HDCV involves the inactivation of the virus with beta-propiolactone (BPL), the effect of BPL on nonviral vaccine components, such as host cell components or stabilizing proteins, may be typical of the haptenic action of small molecular weight chemicals. Specific IgE to commercial HDCV preparations, BPL-treated preparations of noninfected host MRC5 cell sonicate (BPL-MRC5), and a human albumin (HA) (BPL-HA) used as a stabilizing agent were detected in sera from five individuals who reported reactions after booster doses of HDCV. However, these patients had no detectable IgE to normal HA. Sera from nonvaccinated individuals, vaccinated individuals who reported no reaction after HDCV booster, and pollen-allergic individuals had no detectable IgE to HDCV, BPL-MRC5, or BPL-HA. Changes in the ratios of pre- to postbooster serum levels of specific IgE to HDCV and BPL-HA were significantly different in a group of 19 individuals who reported reactions to HDCV boosters; these changes in pre- to postbooster IgE levels in nonreactive vaccinees were not significant. Prebooster serum IgE RAST ratios to HDCV or BPL-HA were not predictive of potential reactions to HDCV. A number of experimental BPL-HA reaction mixtures were assayed to examine the effect of variable concentrations of BPL to HA. Increasing relative molar concentrations of BPL to HA resulted in increased electrophoretic mobility, whereas the highest relative specific IgE binding was detected in BPL-HA molar reaction mixtures of approximately 12.5:1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Whatever the method that was used, there was no statistically significant difference between babies whose mothers received the \"diet\" or the \"nondiet.\" Other factors known to influence the risk of atopy like heredity, sex, month of birth, breast-feeding, and exposure to tobacco smoke, animal dandruff, and solid food did not differ between the groups. The mothers receiving the exclusion diet, by their own choice, had diminished their intake of milk and egg during lactation also, and therefore, their babies were significantly less exposed to cow's milk before 6 months. Still, atopy was equally abundant among their children. Thus, maternal elimination diet during late pregnancy did not protect the baby against allergy.\r"

With these m ABs, we observed epitopes present in as many different hemoglobin (Hb) molecules from the widespread insect family Chironomidae as possible. These Hbs were identified as important allergens in previous studies. Twenty m ABs from seven different clones were tested for specificity against the CTT Hbs III, IIIa, IV, and I to X, as well as against Hbs from 14 other chironomid species; m ABs 1 to 3 were found to be specific for an epitope that was expressed on the CTT III component as well as in Hbs from three other species. m ABs 5 to 7 and 15 recognized an epitope expressed in CTT III, CTT IIIa, CTT IV, and in Hbs from 13 other species. m ABs 8 to 14 and 16 to 20 demonstrated heteroclitic behavior, that is, they bound CTT IIIa better than the immunogen CTT III. Reactivity of m AB 6 with a clinically relevant epitope was demonstrated by up to 15% inhibition of antibody binding by human IgE from sensitized patients. Our results demonstrate that clinically relevant allergenic epitopes can be localized on different molecules with m ABs. This could be important in the development of immunotherapy protocols with highly purified or fragmented allergens.\r"

  ".W": "Cerulenin is an antibiotic that inhibits eukaryotic lipid and sterol synthesis and blocks lipid modification of proteins. The effect of cerulenin on the ability of accessory cells to present antigen to T cells was investigated. This antibiotic strongly inhibits the ability of accessory cells to present antigen to murine T-T hybrids. This effect is observed for multiple distinct antigens including L-glutamic acid60-L-alanine30-L-tyrosine10, bovine insulin, L-glutamic acid56-L-lysine35-L-phenylalanine9, and ovalbumen. Presentation by both macrophage and B lymphoblastoid cell lines is inhibited. The ability to effectively pulse these cells with antigen is inhibited but not the ability of these same cells to present antigen that they have previously processed. Furthermore, this inhibition is selective as it can occur without significant inhibition of the antigen-presenting cell protein or DNA synthesis. Cerulenin does not inhibit antigen uptake or catabolism as assessed with labeled antigen. By these criteria this drug is shown to interfere with an antigen-processing step. The ability of cerulenin to block processing was compared with other known inhibitors. Although cerulenin was effective with all antigens tested, at least one inhibitor was not. Taken together, these results suggest that the effect of cerulenin may define a distinct step in antigen processing and provides evidence that some other processing events are not universally required. The ability of cerulenin to interfere with antigen processing is discussed in the context of the known actions of this antibiotic and events of antigen processing and presentation.\r"

Most studies were done in 2-mo-old lambs, 1 mo after removal of mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN). Extracorporeal perfusion of part of the intestine and addition of fluorescein isothiocyanate to the perfusate led to the labeling, in their normal microenvironment, of a regionally defined population of cells. One day later considerable numbers of emigrant lymphocytes were identified by fluorescence microscopy in the spleen, MLN and peripheral lymph nodes, jejunal PP, and bone marrow. In nonperfused ileal PP and thymus the labeling indexes were low. The highest labeling index was in the blood where 3.7% of the lymphocytes were labeled. A similar organ distribution of emigrant cells was found on day 3. When MLN were included in the perfused region more emigrants were identified. In some animals the intestinal lymphatic draining the perfused ileum was cannulated. Continual lymph drainage caused a dramatic decrease in the labeling indexes in other lymphoid organs. A substantial number of lymphocytes leave both ileal PP and jejunal PP via lymphatics and travel to all other lymphoid organs. However, the number of emigrant lymphocytes compared with the total number of labeled lymphocytes in the perfused tissue was about 10 times greater after perfusing gut with the jejunal PP than after ileal PP perfusion. We conclude that relatively more lymphocytes emigrate from the jejunal PP than from the ileal PP.\r"

  ".U": "88088755\r", 
  ".W": "It was reported earlier that human immune responses to three perennial rye grass (Lolium perenne) pollen allergens, Lol p I, II, and III, are associated with histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR3. Rye-allergic people are often concordantly sensitive to all three of these allergens. Since earlier studies suggested that these antigens are non-cross-reactive, their immunologic relatedness by double antibody radioimmunoassay (DARIA) was studied in order to understand further the immunochemical basis for the concordant recognition of the three allergens. Direct binding DARIA studies were performed with human sera from 189 allergic subjects. Inhibition DARIA studies were carried out with 17 human sera from grass-allergic patients who were on grass immunotherapy, one goat anti-serum, and six rabbit antisera. None of the sera detected any significant degree of two-way cross-reactivity between Lol p I and II, or between Lol p I and III. However, the degree of two-way cross-reactivity between Lol p II and III exhibited by individual human and animal antisera varied between undetectable and 100%. In general, the degree of cross-reactivity between Lol p II and III was higher among human sera than among animal sera. Taken together with earlier findings that antibody responses to Lol p I, II and III are associated with HLA-HDR3, and that most Lol p II and III responders are also Lol p I responders, but not vice versa, our present results suggest the following: the HLA-DR3-encoded Ia molecule recognizes a similar immunodominant Ia recognition site (agretope) shared between Lol p I and Lol p II and/or III; in addition, Lol p I appears to contain unique Ia recognition site(s) not present in Lol p II and III. However, further epitope analyses are required to investigate these possibilities.\r"

  ".W": "Hypaque-Ficoll-purified human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) equilibrated with the membrane potential-sensitive probe 3,3'dipentyloxacarbocyanine [di-O-C(5)(3)] were incubated with buffer or cytochalasin B (cyto B) followed by incubation with prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) (0 to 10(-5) M) for 5 min at 37 degrees C. The cells were then stimulated with N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) (0 to 10(-5) M). Changes in forward light scatter (FWD-SC), 90 degrees scatter (90 degrees -SC), and fluorescence intensity were measured by flow cytometry to determine the effects of PGE1 on FMLP-induced shape change, secretion, and membrane potential responses, respectively. In other experiments, the effects of PGE1 preincubation on FMLP +/- cyto B and phorbol myristate acetate-induced (O2) production were measured by superoxide dismutase-inhibitable cyto c reduction. PGE1 had no direct effects on the FWD-SC, 90 degrees-SC, or resting potential fluorescence of unstimulated or cyto B-pretreated PMN. PGE1 produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the proportion of depolarizing PMN in response to FMLP, which was maximal at 10(-6) M (42.1 +/- 6.9% inhibition, p less than 0.005), but was apparent at 10(-8) M. The PGE1-induced inhibition was maximal after 30 sec of incubation at 37 degrees C and was caused by a decrease in the maximal percentage of depolarizing PMN without a significant change in the FMLP dose-response curve (Km = 2.43 vs 3.62 X 10(-8) M, control vs PGE1-treated) or an inhibition in the degree of depolarization by the responding subpopulation. PGE1 also inhibited the loss of 90 degrees-SC induced by FMLP in cyto B-pretreated cells (secretion response) (46.2 +/- 16.5% inhibition of the maximal 90 degrees-SC loss, n = 5, p less than 0.005), but did not affect the increase in FWD-SC seen with FMLP-induced PMN activation or the ability of cyto B to recruit more PMN to depolarize. PGE1 also inhibited FMLP +/- cyto B-induced O2 production in a dose-dependent fashion; phorbol myristate acetate-induced O2 production was also slightly inhibited, but only at high PGE1 concentrations. The data indicate that PGE1 inhibits FMLP-induced cell activation by a mechanism that involves a step distal to the recruitment of unresponsive PMN by cyto B, and that PGE1 is capable of inhibiting depolarization responses without affecting FMLP-induced shape change, providing more support for a dissociation between the two activation pathways.\r"

To determine whether Ab 60.3 might similarly inhibit neutrophil function in vivo, we measured the effect of antibody administration on neutrophil localization to polyvinyl sponges placed s.c., in rabbits. Studies in 25 animals showed that infusion of Ab 60.3 at the time of sponge insertion resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of in vivo neutrophil migration with almost complete paralysis of neutrophil migration at higher antibody doses. These studies confirm the functional relevance of CD18, demonstrate that neutrophil function can be profoundly inhibited in vivo by Ab 60.3, and suggest that substances such as AB 60.3 may be clinically useful as potent anti-inflammatory agents.\r"

The antigens on neutrophil plasma membranes recognized by mAb NMS-1 were solubilized in Nonidet P-40 and immunopurified on matrix-bound mAb NMS-1. mAb NMS-1 binds to four periodate-sensitive structures of 70,000, 95,000, 140,000, and 170,000 Da on the plasma membrane surface of human neutrophils as was shown by Western blot analysis. Binding of mAb NMS-1 to human neutrophils induced a rapid transient rise in cytosolic free calcium (Quin 2 fluorescence) but no detectable generation of reactive oxygen metabolites. The oxidative burst of N-formyl peptide-treated neutrophils, however, increased in the presence of mAb NMS-1. The kinetics of N-formyl peptide (N-formyl-norleucyl-leucyl-phenylalanyl-norleucyl-tryrosyl-lysine; FNLPNTL)-mediated hydrogen peroxide formation (p-hydroxy phenyl acetate oxidation) in the presence of mAb NMS-1 was analyzed quantitatively. 1) When neutrophils were incubated with mAb NMS-1 before FNLPNTL addition, an increase in rate, magnitude, and duration of hydrogen peroxide formation was observed compared with controls which received no mAb NMS-1 treatment. After termination of the initial linear phase of response, a second transient linear phase of hydrogen peroxide formation was induced. This second phase of activation was not observed in neutrophils which received no mAb NMS-1 treatment. The onset of the response and latency before attainment of the initial linear rate of hydrogen peroxide formation was not changed by mAb NMS-1 pretreatment. 2) When neutrophils were stimulated with FNLPNTL, the addition of mAb NMS-1--after termination of the FNLPNTL-induced response--without delay induced a second transient burst of hydrogen peroxide formation. Persistent activation of hydrogen peroxide formation by mAb NMS-1 in FNLPNTL-stimulated neutrophils was not observed.\r"

The levels of this serum cytotoxic factor increase with the progression of morbidity. Neutralization of Listeria-induced cytotoxic factor activity with a monospecific antiserum to recombinant murine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) revealed that the cytotoxic factor was antigenically indistinguishable from natural TNF present in endotoxin-induced tumor necrosis serum. In contrast to a lethal infection, no TNF activity was detected in sera of mice throughout a sublethal infection. However, shortly after initiation of a sublethal infection, mice acquire a greatly enhanced capacity to produce serum TNF in response to an intravenous injection of endotoxin. Cultures of unfractionated spleen cells from mice with ongoing Listeria infections produced TNF when incubated in the absence, but not in the presence, of antibiotics. However, such antibiotic-treated cultures could be stimulated with endotoxin to produce substantially higher TNF yields than spleen cells of uninfected mice. It is also shown that intravenous infusion of anti-recombinant murine TNF IgG into sublethally infected mice results in increased Listeria proliferation in spleens and livers, and ultimately in death from an overwhelming infection.\r"

We have used MBr1 as the monoclonal antitumor antibody in an idiotypic sequence of immunizations in order to obtain and characterize \"internal images\" of the original epitope to be used as substitutes of the nominal antigen in serologic immunoassays. Two monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies (beta-1 and beta-2), which reacted with paratope-related idiotopes on MBr1, were obtained. The analysis of the antigenic and immunogenic properties of these molecules by both \"antigen\" and \"antibody\" competition assays provided evidence that both beta-1 and beta-2 bear \"internal images\" of the MBr1-defined epitope. Moreover, when injected in mice and rabbits both beta-1 and beta-2 induced anti anti-idiotypic antibodies, which mimicked MBr1 in binding MCF-7 as well as normal and neoplastic mammary gland epithelial cells.

  ".W": "It has been theorized that the administration of human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) in consecutive menstrual cycles will result in a poor follicular response in the second cycle. To examine this, 50 women undergoing ovulation induction in two consecutive cycles were assessed, using in each the same induction regimen during the initial 5 days. The remainder of each cycle was individualized according to their response. Nine women were anovulatory, 19 were oligoovulatory, and 22 ovulated regularly in unstimulated cycles. In repeat cycles only 3 of 50 had poor follicular development and did not receive human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG); all were anovulatory. Forty-two of 50 of the first cycles had continually rising estradiol (E2), while 43 of 47 of the second cycles had rising E2 patterns. Grouping the peak E2 prior to hCG in the ranges less than 300, 300-699, 700-1099, and greater than or equal to 1100 pg/ml, peaks in the second cycle were similar in 25 of 50, lower in 16, and higher in 9. Only 3 of 9 anovulatory women had similar peaks, as compared to 22 of 41 of the oligoovulatory and regularly ovulating women. Comparing the second to the first cycle, the day of hCG was within 1 day in 28 of 50 women, 2 or more days less than the first cycle in 6, and 2 or more days greater than the first cycle in 11. We conclude that in a successive cycle of ovulation induction (i) the follicular response is impaired in anovulatory women, but (ii) in oligoovulatory or regularly ovulating women, clinically significant differences in the estradiol response do not occur.\r"

At the University of the Orange Free State, the GIFT technique was introduced in July 1985, and during phase I, 31 patients were treated by means of GIFT. All patients had had at least six cycles of ovulation induction with human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Their diagnoses were anovulation (3 patients), mild endometriosis (17 patients), and unexplained infertility (11 patients). All husbands' semen analyses were normal. Of the 31 patients, 3 failed, due to spontaneous ovulation before laparoscopy (1 patient) and unsuccessful follicle aspiration at laparoscopy with no oocytes found (2 patients). Four ongoing pregnancies resulted from the remaining 28 patients. This represents a pregnancy rate of 14.29% per laparoscopy (including the failures). The patients who became pregnant had had infertility treatment for 5, 6, 8, and 8 years, respectively. GIFT therefore appears to be a promising method of treatment for long-standing infertility.\r"

However, the rate of embryo development in vitro was retarded compared with that in vivo and the number of normal fetuses following transfer to recipients of blastocysts grown in T6 + Nu-Serum was not different from the number for those grown in T6 alone or with insulin. The addition of neither insulin nor Nu-Serum to T6 optimizes embryo development or viability.\r"

Hyperprolactinemia might compromise luteal support for implantation and contribute to the limited success of ET. We measured serum PRL concentrations in 10 normoprolactinemic women immediately before, during, and after ET and compared the PRL response around ET to that induced by laparoscopy as a measure of the competency of the stress-prolactin axis. Nine of ten patients demonstrated a significant PRL response to surgery. The mean (+/- SEM) intraoperative PRL concentration (124.0 +/- 19.6 ng/ml) was significantly higher than the preoperative level (12.3 +/- 2.4 ng/ml) (P less than 0.01). Three hours after surgery PRL levels had decreased (44.8 +/- 11.5 ng/ml) but remained above baseline. All subjects were normoprolactinemic 48 hr after laparoscopy. Serum PRL concentration did not change significantly in response to ET, with levels of 10.4 +/- 1.7, 12.4 +/- 1.1, and 10.6 +/- 1.8 ng/ml immediately before, during, and 3 hr after ET, respectively. While laparoscopy for in vitro fertilization--embryo transfer commonly induces hyperprolactinemia, the PRL rise is transient, with no carryover to the time of ET. Embryo transfer itself does not induce a significant PRL rise.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of increasing the level of ovarian stimulation on preimplantation embryonic development were assessed using a mouse in vitro fertilization system. When F1 hybrid (C57BL/6 X CBA/Ca) mice received a single injection of 5 IU pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin (PMSG) followed 60 hr later by 5 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) approximately 50% of the resultant postovulatory oocytes developed to the blastocyst stage following in vitro fertilization. Increasing the single dose of PMSG to 10 or 15 IU resulted in significant reductions in the frequency of development to the blastocyst stage. When one or two additional doses of 5 IU PMSG were administered 24 and 48 hr after an initial injection of 5 IU, lower frequencies of oocytes with the potential for full preimplantation development were again observed. This reduction in gamete quality was significantly greater when the final dose of PMSG was administered only 12 hr prior to hCG. The results suggest that excessive gonadotropin stimulation may compromise the quality of the preimplantation embryos obtained following in vitro fertilization and that the timing of gonadotropin administration may also be critical.\r"

  ".W": "Animal and human data would suggest that ultrasound causes deleterious effects to oocytes during meiosis. We directly compared the fertilization rate and embryonic development following in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer of those oocytes exposed to ultrasound and those not exposed in the same patient. In 39 unscreened patients a combination of laparoscopy and ultrasound was used for oocyte recovery. Laparoscopy was performed first on the most accessible ovary (usually the right) and at least one oocyte was obtained. Ultrasound-guided oocyte recovery was successful in the other inaccessible ovary. To assess how oocytes obtained by ultrasound or laparoscopy related to the pregnancy rate, two groups of patients were evaluated in whom the embryos transferred either had been exposed to ultrasound or had not been. The fertilization and the embryo cleavage rates were not significantly different between the ultrasound-exposed and the unexposed groups. The pregnancy rate was also not significantly different [9 of 49 (18.4%) for ultrasound exposed versus 14 of 74 (18.9%) for unexposed]. There was one early spontaneous abortion in each group. Further analysis of a group of 40 patients, in whom the oocytes were exposed to ultrasound in situ, after the endogenous luteinizing hormone (LH) surge had begun 1-27 hr earlier, revealed that 6 became pregnant (15%). This preliminary study suggests that exposure of human oocytes to ultrasonic waves, either during the different phases of meiosis or after the completion of meiosis, did not significantly influence the developmental potential of the in vitro fertilized embryos.\r"

To assess further the relationship between birth weight and EGA in these offspring, a review was made of all infants delivered at our institution from May 1, 1983 to July 15, 1986. Forty-five infants in 39 deliveries were identified. Seventeen of 37 (46%) were delivered vaginally, 20 by cesarean section. Forty-two infants were delivered at term (after 36 weeks). The six sets of twins delivered at 254 +/- 7 days (mean, 36 weeks). Eighteen of 39 deliveries (46%) delivered at or beyond 40 weeks EGA. The mean weight at delivery for the term infants was 3225 +/- 90 g. Thirty-eight infants were size appropriate for dates as assessed by the Lubchenco scale, while the weight in the remaining seven infants exceeded the 90th percentile for their gestational age. We conclude that infants conceived through IVF-ET are not predisposed per se to a low birth weight or delivery at an early gestational age. However, prior studies suggesting lower birth weights for IVF infants may have resulted in part from early delivery due to patient pressure and anxiety.\r"

The latero-medical diameter of this attic at the level of the body of the incus averages 1.7 mm., but is somewhat smaller at the level of the head of the malleus. The medial attic always communicates with the mesotympanum through an opening between the prominence of the tympanic part of the facial canal and the superstructures of the auditory ossicles. The lateral attic is always of smaller dimensions than the medial attic and its latero-medial diameter averages less than 1 mm. This attic very seldom communicates with the mesotympanum.\r"

An attempt has been made to assess the impact of this chronic ear disease in terms of the morbidity it incurs upon the paediatric population. The preponderance of bilateral presentation in cholesteatomatous otitis media (24.5 per cent) and the associated sensorineural or mixed hearing loss (in 25.4 per cent of the ears) is emphasized, to reflect the alarming audiological disability in the afflicted child. An attempt has been made to correlate the otoscopic profile with the extent of disease, osteitic damage and co-existing complications. It was noted that, in Indian children, mesotympanic choleasteatoma was more often associated with large defects of the pars tensa (viz. marginal, subtotal and total perforations--54.4 per cent) than with postero-superior retraction pockets (37.2 per cent) or purely attic defects (7.8 per cent). Further analysis revealed this common otoscopic presentation to be a more active process, occurring in predominantly cellular mastoids and associated with extensive disease. Based on this study, a more aggressive canal down tympanomastoid approach is advocated for children presenting with this otoscopic profile.\r"

  ".W": "While it is clear that the majority of the world's population suffers some deterioration of hearing--especially at high frequencies--with the advance of age, it is equally clear that some individuals reach very old age with clinically normal hearing. It is often difficult to separate the biological changes of senility from the effects of auditory environmental changes, and of specific pathological changes associated with specific disease entities. A better understanding of the etiology of presbyacusis is needed. The first step towards this end is the recognition that not all hearing impairment in the aged is due to biological ageing. This is important because hearing loss due to the acceleration of biological and environmental effects (accelerated presbyacusis) may be preventable, while hearing loss due to biological ageing (presbyacusis) is not treatable. The second step is the realization that not all hearing impairment over age 65 is due to ageing. Hearing impairments that are rapidly progressive, profound, asymmetrical, or fluctuating, and those associated with a marked conductive element or severe dizziness might well be associated with specific ear disease (Nosoacusis) such as infection, otosclerosis, Meniere's disease, or acoustic tumor. A full neuro-otological evaluation including ABR, CT scan, ENG and others should be done in any patient over 65 suspected of having a specific ear disease. The classification presented demonstrates the need to revise the criteria used in determining 'Presbyacusis Curves'. These provide a reference standard for normal hearing at any age or decade. There are too many variables in the averages obtained from different subjects to make those averages a dependable standard reference.\r"

On the basis of this investigation it is concluded that: (1) the Mondini defect is part of Pendred's syndrome; (2) the inherited Mondini malformation is the underlying cause of the sensorineural hearing impairment; and (3) the hearing sensitivity varies greatly in these patients.\r"

In the patients, amplitudes did not differ between Cz and Ccon. This effect of the lesion on BP topography, was found in movements of either side. However, intraindividual comparisons revealed that the reduction of the BP in Cz (relative to Ccon) was larger for movements contralateral to the SMA lesion than for those ipsilateral of it.\r"

Patients often developed muscular weakness of variable severity owing to diplorisation block at nicotinic receptors. During such paralysis nerve conduction velocity and distal latencies were normal even in severely paralysed patients. The amplitude of the compound action potential was smaller than in controls and often showed a repetitive response. The amplitude tended to be lower in those more severely affected. On repetitive stimulation there was usually no decrement with three stimuli per second and only occasional decrement at 10 per second. At 30 Hz several cases showed a decrement even in the absence of paralysis. This response to repetitive stimuli is thus quite distinct from that seen in either myasthenia or Eaton Lambert syndrome. On three occasions after poisoning with dichlorovos there was first anticholinesterase insecticide poisoning and later delayed neurotoxicity as seen with triorthocresylphosphate. These cases showed all the features of a severe pure motor axonal degeneration neuropathy.\r"

An increase of mean arterial blood pressure of 30-40 mm Hg in the rat over the first 2 hours after diathermy of the middle cerebral artery prevented the 100% rise in hemisphere lactate seen in normotensive control animals. Angiotensin infusion also prevented early hemispheric oedema in this model. In the gerbil, 4 hours after placing a clip on one carotid artery, metaraminol-induced increases in blood pressure had no such protective effect on the metabolic changes or on oedema. When the clip was removed after 3 hours to permit 1 hour of reperfusion, lactate levels returned to normal but the degree of oedema was unchanged. Hypertension in this reperfusion model caused a slight but not statistically significant increase in oedema. The evidence suggests that moderate increases in blood pressure may be protective against the early metabolic sequelae of focal cerebral ischaemia, but there are potential problems with oedema formation. It is argued that a clinical trial should study the potentially beneficial effects of a brief early increase in blood pressure in the acute aftermath of ischaemic stroke.\r"

The incidence of IgG immunoreactive banding in the total sample was 30%. Within the diagnostic groups the incidence of banding was: controls 32%, schizophrenia 28%, mental retardation 27%, cerebellar ataxia 33%, Parkinson's disease 22%, myasthenia gravis 45% and epilepsy 31%. The differences are not statistically significant. There was no significant difference in the numbers and locations of bands between the various diagnostic groups and the controls. The overall incidence of immunoreactivity corresponding to the high molecular weight subunit of neurofilaments was only 6%, thus not confirming a previously reported incidence of 95%. The similarity between the diagnostic and the control sera suggests that caution should be exerted in interpreting the pathogenic significance of anti-CNS immunoreactive banding on Western blots.\r"

Fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) was measured in 104,000 x g supernatant fractions. Characterization of the FABP assay with liver supernatants indicated that FABP exhibited sigmoidal kinetics, with an apparent Kd of 0.75 microM. Doubling the protein amount in the assay did not affect the FABP activity. FABP was demonstrated in liver, with an activity of 3448 pmol bound/g liver, and in adipose tissue, with an activity of 276 pmol bound/g adipose tissue. No activity was observed in the muscle tissue. FABP activity of liver and adipose tissue from swine fed 20% canola oil was higher on a per gram tissue basis than that in tissues from pigs fed the control diet.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of four dietary proteins on plasma amino acid (PAA) levels in portal vein and aorta and on hepatic ribosome aggregation were investigated in rats fed 10% protein diets ad libitum. Proteins studied were beef, casein, rapeseed and soybean. Measurements were made at 2000, 2300, 0200, 0500 and 0800 h. Portoaortic differences in essential amino acids (EAA) in plasma were calculated and compared to dietary EAA to verify the time-dependent changes in their intestinal absorption. Each protein generated different variations in portal and aortic PAA levels. Rapeseed produced the lowest plasma concentrations of EAA, but its portoaortic differences were as large as those of the other proteins. With each protein, proportions of EAA in plasma (in contrast to concentrations) tended to remain constant in portal vein and aorta over the 12-h period. Significant correlations between portoaortic differences and dietary EAA were found in all groups, but at varying times, indicating that the kinetics of intestinal absorption were dependent on the protein fed. So were variations in liver polysome distribution. For rapeseed and soybean, times of most active protein synthesis were 0200 and 0500 h; with beef and casein, variations between sampling times were not significant. No direct relationship was found between magnitude and composition of PAA portoaortic differences and ribosome aggregation. Thus these two parameters were both affected by dietary proteins, but no synchrony was evidenced between them.\r"

Mice fed the 40% protein diet had significantly lower NE turnover rates in interscapular brown adipose tissue, heart and kidney (66, 64 and 49%, respectively) and nonsignificantly lower (84%) turnover rate in brain than did mice fed the 20% protein diet, but plasma and tissue tyrosine concentrations did not differ. When energy intake of the 20% protein-fed mice was restricted to 92% of the 40% protein-fed mice, tyrosine concentration in plasma and tissues was lower by half, but NE turnover rate did not differ between the two groups. Supplementation of the 40 or 20% diets with tyrosine, resulting in twofold higher plasma and tissue tyrosine concentrations, had no effect on NE turnover rate in any organ examined. We conclude that both energy intake and dietary protein concentration affect sympathetic nervous system activity in young mice. Tyrosine does not mediate or alter these changes.\r"

To investigate whether the change in activity was mediated by a change in the rate of protein degradation, we measured the fractional turnover rate using the double-isotope technique with [3H]- and [14C]leucine and calculated the apparent half-life of xanthine oxidase in rats fed diets containing either 20 or 5% casein with either 35 or 5 mg iron/kg diet. Under control conditions, xanthine oxidase had an apparent half-life of 4.8 d and approximately 65% of the enzyme subunits were active. Rats fed diets with low dietary protein had lower xanthine oxidase activity, but the enzyme had a slower fractional turnover rate, resulting in an apparent half-life of 6.4 d, and only 15-20% of the enzyme was active. The apparent half-life of xanthine oxidase increased to 7.5 d in rats fed diets with low dietary iron, but dietary iron did not affect the specific activity of the enzyme or the percentage of active subunits. These results suggest that the loss of enzyme activity is not due to loss of enzyme protein by increased degradation, but rather to inactivation of the enzyme.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the digestion of phytate in the stomach and small intestine in humans, studies were performed in subjects with established ileostomy. A recently developed high performance liquid chromatography method made it possible to analyze phytate and its degradation products in food and digesta. The digestibility of phytate in raw bran and extruded bran was investigated in seven ileostomy patients. Each subject was studied for two 4-d periods while consuming a constant low fiber diet with the addition of either 54 g/d of a bran-gluten-starch mixture or the corresponding extruded product. During passage through the subject's stomach and small intestine 58%, on average, of the phytate in unprocessed bran was hydrolyzed to inositol penta-, tetra- and triphosphates. When bran was subjected to extrusion cooking, 25% of the inositol hexaphosphate was hydrolyzed to penta- and tetraphosphate and the phytase activity ceased. Essentially no phytate digestion occurred when the ileostomy subjects consumed the extruded product. The reduced digestibility might be due to the lost phytase activity or to formation of indigestible phytate complexes during extrusion cooking.\r"

This treatment produced rats with vitamin A reserves from depleted to normal (0.03 to 184 micrograms/g) and serum retinol concentrations of 4-67 micrograms/dl. Hydrolase activity in liver homogenates was optimal when assayed with 275 mM CHAPS (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate), 2 mg/ml Triton X-100 and 5 mM retinyl palmitate at pH 7.0. By use of these concentrations and conditions, retinyl ester hydrolase activity displayed relatively low interanimal variability (fivefold). Furthermore, activity was independent of serum or liver vitamin A concentrations. When CHAPS in the assay was replaced with equimolar sodium cholate, or with reduced concentrations of CHAPS and retinyl palmitate, retinyl ester hydrolase activity was more variable, i.e., 37- and 23-fold, respectively. Furthermore, in the latter case, hydrolase activity was threefold higher in rats with liver vitamin A reserves less than 10 micrograms/g. Thus, the type and concentration of bile salt used to assay retinyl ester hydrolase affect its interanimal variability. Furthermore, hydrolase activity measured in reduced concentrations of substrate and detergent is elevated in rats with low liver reserves of vitamin A.\r"

  ".W": "Changes in liver iron concentration in relation to seasonal body weight variations and food iron intake have been investigated in 77 Svalbard reindeer by chemical and histological methods. During the winter season the body weight decreased about 43% in females and 39% in males. Liver weight was reduced about 65% in both sexes. The liver iron concentration showed little or no difference between the sexes and was 29 +/- 13 mg iron/100 g wet weight in the autumn. The concentration increased in late winter to 291 +/- 52 mg iron/100 g in animals eating iron-rich forage plants, and to 165 +/- 92 mg iron/100 g in animals eating forage plants with a normal iron content. Starving animals with a very high iron concentration of the rumen content usually had massive siderosis in both parenchymal and nonparenchymal cells of the liver. In contrast, siderosis was restricted to nonparenchymal cells in starving animals with normal rumen iron concentration. Transferrin saturation was significantly higher in animals eating iron-rich forage plants than in those eating forage plants with a normal content. Therefore it is proposed that seasonal liver siderosis is a result of a) translocation of iron from catabolized blood and lean tissue that is recovered in nonparenchymal cells and b) high uptake of food iron with deposition in the parenchymal cells.\r"

The present study investigated whether Mn deficiency alters pancreatic adaptation to diet. Weanling rats that were fed for 6 wk a high carbohydrate (HC) diet with less than 1 mg Mn/kg diet (Mn deficient) or 40 mg Mn/kg diet (control) were divided into three control and deficient dietary subgroups: 1) HC, 2) high protein (HP) or 3) high fat (HF). Rats were then fed these diets for 10 d. Body weights and food consumption were comparable among the groups. Pancreatic and hepatic Mn contents were significantly lower in Mn-deficient rats than in respective controls. Digestive enzymes adapted to diet in both control and Mn-deficient rats with the greatest amylase, lipase and trypsin activities in HC, HF and HP rats, respectively. Mn deficiency resulted in significantly greater amylase activity in HC and HP groups and lipase activity in only the HF group than in respective controls. These data suggest that Mn participates in the regulation of pancreatic amylase content and in the adaptive response of pancreatic lipase to dietary fat.\r"

Although total food intake during the 4-wk study was similar for all eight treatment groups, rats fed the high protein--containing diets gained significantly (P less than 0.001) more weight than did rats fed the low protein--containing diets. Rats fed high protein diets absorbed significantly (P less than 0.001) more fluoride than rats fed low protein diets at either fluoride level regardless of protein type. The fraction of absorbed fluoride that was actually retained, however, was significantly (P less than 0.001) reduced by high protein at either fluoride level regardless of protein type. This depressive effect of high dietary protein on retained fluoride was reflected in femur fluoride concentration. Our results suggest that food fluoride, such as that originating from preparation of foods with fluoridated water, will be less bioavailable for an individual ingesting a high protein diet than for an individual fed a low protein diet.\r"

The does' urine was collected from catheters and the bucks' urine from stainless steel separators protected with fecal collection bags. The daily urine samples were analyzed for labeled amino acid. Urinary recovery of radioactivity from all does was less than 33% after 3 d and was proceeding at less than 5% d. After 9 d, total recovery was less than 50% of total dose for the does. Elimination rates were slightly higher and more variable for the yearling bucks (25-63% after 4 d). On the basis of these data, 3MH does not appear to be a valid index of muscle protein degradation in either male or female dairy goats.\r"

Measures of copper status were serum copper and serum ceruloplasmin determined by both enzymatic and immunochemical methods. Copper absorption, copper retention, total serum copper and the serum level of ceruloplasmin protein were not affected significantly by the changes in AA intake; however, the oxidase activity of serum ceruloplasmin was decreased an average of 21% during the high (605 mg/d) AA intake period.

Enough casein was added to all cassava diets to bring protein energy to 8% of the total. When compared to the control diet, the 25% diet had no significant effect on consumption time or measures of protein and energy digestion.
