The bone scans were examined at specified postoperative intervals. Radionuclide activity of the femoral, tibial, and patellar regions was measured. Six patients who developed pain postoperatively were excluded. Bone scans immediately postoperative and at three months demonstrated increased uptake, which gradually decreased to baseline levels at ten to 12 months. Radioisotope uptake was comparable in the cemented and cementless groups, but was highly variable in individual patients and in each of the follow-up periods. A single postoperative bone scan cannot differentiate component loosening from early bone remodeling. Sequential bone scans, as a supplement to the clinical examination and conventional radiography, may prove useful in the diagnosis of TKA failure.\r"

The patients had Porous Coated Anatomic primary total knee arthroplasty and were followed for four years. All cases but one were clinically successful. Thirteen components were inserted without cement, while in seven, high-viscosity Palacos cement was used. Full postoperative weight bearing was allowed in all cases. During the first year, noncemented components migrated a mean of 2.6 mm, while cemented components migrated a mean of 1.1 mm. About 1 mm of migration of noncemented components was in the downward direction, i.e., subsidence occurred, mostly during the first year. After one year, the noncemented components had stabilized more than the cemented ones. There was a significant correlation between the migration after one year and the postoperative prosthetic position and alignment of the leg. A mean maximum inducible displacement (the total vector displacement of the prosthetic marker that moved the most) of 0.7 mm and 0.4 mm was found for noncemented and cemented components, respectively. The micromotion found was of the same magnitude as that for other cemented and noncemented prosthetic systems previously reported.\r"

The common mechanisms of injury included motorcycle, pedestrian versus automobile, and motor vehicle accidents. Nineteen of 30 fractures were treated with a posterolateral bone graft within six months of the initial injury, and 11 of 30 were grafted after established nonunion. Union was obtained in 29 of 30 fractures (97%). Healing time from the time of grafting ranged from three to 12 months, with an average of 4.7 months. One patient had a below-knee amputation because of uncontrolled chronic osteomyelitis, drainage, and nonunion. Posterolateral bone grafts consistently produced rapid healing of delayed union as well as established nonunion.\r"

  ".W": "A series of biomechanical analyses were performed to explain the recent reduction in treatment-related complications of external fixation of distal radius fractures using a limited open approach for pin placement and larger 4-mm self-tapping half pins. A comparison of pull-out strength, stress concentration effect, and inherent bending strength of 3- and 4-mm half pins was performed. The effect of proximal pin placement in the radius or in the ulna and the effect of distal pin placement in four, six, or eight metacarpal cortices were determined. These analyses demonstrate that the 4-mm self-tapping half pins result in a significantly higher pull-out strength and only a small decrease in torsional load strength of the bone. They also demonstrate that proximal pin fixation in the radius produces the most stable fixation and that distal pin fixation into six metacarpal cortices produces a strong configuration that does not violate the interosseous muscles of the second intrinsic compartment. The rate of treatment-related complications in the external fixation of distal radius fractures (specifically, pin loosening, bending and breakage, fracture through pin sites, collapse at the fracture site, and intrinsic contracture) are addressed in this study. Such complications can be minimized by using 4-mm pins after central predrilling, with proximal placement in the radius and distal placement through six cortices of the bases of the second and third metacarpals.\r"

There were 106 women and 41 men whose average age was 62 years. Two-thirds of the patients were treated for complete fractures, while one-third were treated for impending fractures. Breast, lung, and kidney carcinoma accounted for the majority of the primary lesions. One-half of the patients died within nine months of surgery, while one-quarter were alive 19.1 months after surgery. The patients with breast cancer had the best prognosis, while the patients with lung cancer had the worst. The probability of implant failure increased linearly with time to 33% at 60 months. The probability of failure for the femoral lesions was greater, with 44% at 60 months. The average survival in the patients with failed fixation in the femoral lesions was 34.5 months with a mean interval to failure at 17.7 months. The failure rate was high (23%) in proximal femoral lesions treated with a compression screw or nail plate. Common reasons for failure included poor initial fixation, improper implant selection, and progression of disease within the operative field. Bone cement augmentation should be used with the fixation device when possible. Complications due to hip-screw cut-out from the head may also be reduced by applying bone cement around the screw threads.\r"

A management protocol using thorough debridement and irrigation and muscle flap coverage was accomplished in four patients with exposed endoprostheses after total arthroplasty or limb salvage surgery. Predisposing factors for late wound dehiscence in the four oncology patients were preoperative radiation and chemotherapy as well as multiple subsequent reoperations. In this study, all four prostheses and extremities were retained without the need for prosthetic removal or exchange. No infections developed. Late aseptic wound dehiscence with exposed conventional or tumor endoprosthesis need not be managed with prosthetic removal, arthrodesis, or amputation. This one-stage procedure avoided infection, allowed early mobilization, shortened hospitalization and, most important, avoided amputations.\r"

Diagnoses for the patients were the following: Hodgkin's lymphoma (44), Wilms's tumor (30), acute lymphocytic leukemia (26), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (18), Ewing's sarcoma (nine), rhabdomyosarcoma (six), neuroblastoma (six), and others (four). Age at the follow-up examination averaged 18 years (range, 14-28 years). Average length of follow-up study was 9.9 years (range, two to 18 years). Asymmetry of the chest and ribs was seen in 51 (36%) of these children. Fifty (35%) had scoliosis; 14 had kyphosis. In two children, the scoliosis was treated with a brace, while one developed significant kyphosing scoliosis after laminectomy and had spinal fusion. Twenty-three (16%) patients complained of significant pain at the radiation sites. Twelve of the patients developed leg-length inequality; eight of those were symptomatic. Three patients developed second primary tumors. Currently, the incidence of significant skeletal sequelae is lower and the manifestations are less severe than reported in the years from 1940 to 1970. The reduction in skeletal complications may be attributed to shielding of growth centers, symmetric field selection, decreased total radiation doses, and sequence changes in chemotherapy.\r"

These children are frequently frail with disabling bone and joint deformities and fractures. In an eight-year cumulative management of 12 children with OI, a comprehensive program included strengthening exercises to the pelvic girdle and lower extremity muscles, in addition to pool exercises and molded seating to support upright posture. Long leg braces were fitted when the children were able to sit unsupported. All 12 were fitted with braces; nine were functional ambulators, and three were home ambulators. Six children required femoral plating or rodding, two of whom subsequently had the metal removed. Lower extremity fractures averaged one and one-half per year prior to bracing for nine children who had fractures. There was 0.83 fracture per year for the ten children who had fractures after bracing. The degree of femoral bowing increased in four, decreased in four, and remained unchanged in four, while the degree of tibial bowing increased in two, decreased in nine, and remained unchanged in one during the observation period. A comprehensive rehabilitation program and long leg bracing with surgical operations on the femur result in a high level of functional activity for children with OI with an acceptable level of risk for fracture.\r"

One-half of the electrodes were functional, while the remainder served as controls. Two animals were killed at two and four weeks, and four animals were killed at six and 12 weeks, postoperatively. Each facet fusion was evaluated using high-resolution roentgenograms and routine histology. In the two-, four-, and six-week specimens, there was little difference in the roentgenographic or histologic appearance of the control and stimulated fusions. However, by 12 weeks, all eight stimulated facet joints showed roentgenographic and histologic evidence of solid bony fusion, but none of the eight control facet joints demonstrated osseous bridging of the fusion site. The results of this study suggest that direct current electrical stimulation appears to enhance the bony union of facet fusions in the canine lumbar spine.\r"

It is characterized by roentgenographic findings of rapidly progressing destructive changes in the pubic rami, pubis, or pubic symphysis. A soft-tissue mass with calcification may be present. Overlapping roentgenographic and even histopathologic features with chondrosarcoma may lead to erroneous diagnosis and over-treatment. Each of the six new cases of pubic osteolysis in this report involved middle-aged to elderly females. Three out of six cases had no antecedent trauma. The pathologic findings were extensive reparative changes that included metaplastic cartilage, bone formation, and granulation tissue with myxoid and angiomatoid patterns. Four of the six cases were initially diagnosed after biopsy as low-grade malignancies. One of these was treated with a partial pelvectomy. The follow-up period in the cases was from one to 41 months. In all cases, the initial complaints of pain about the pelvis gradually subsided with conservative therapy. Differentiating pubic osteolysis, osteitis pubis, and pubic osteomyelitis should not be difficult; pertinent differential features are discussed.\r"

The BBM was not porous coated, and it is not cemented in place. The femoral component is secured in the femoral canal by means of biomechanical fixation. It is biologic by bone ingrowth through the fenestration in the proximal neck. It is mechanical by a snug fit in the isthmus and by three-point fixation within the shaft. The removed femoral head is morselized in the bone mill and packed into the prepared femoral canal to enhance a tight fit. The collar of the BBM transfers stress to the calcar. Postoperative roentgenograms show incorporation of bone graft within the fenestration of the prosthesis and no stress shielding of the calcar. The acetabulum requires reaming only if it is shallow or asymmetric. It usually presents no problem except in revision total hip arthroplasty. The present authors have used the BBM almost exclusively since 1981. After eight years, the BBM has stood up well to the test of time and presented few major problems.\r"

Subgroup analysis revealed comparable outcome in 50 patients with at least three years of follow-up assessment (mean, 5.1 years), indicating no deterioration of results. Anterior thigh pain, attributed to femoral component loosening, was the predominant patient complaint. Use of proportionately sized femoral components and use of cement when indicated should decrease the incidence of anterior thigh pain. This intermediate-term follow-up study suggests a role for bipolar hemiarthroplasty in the primary surgical treatment of osteoarthritis.\r"

There was no certain relationship between the degree of rotation of the outer head and the extent of its migration. Migration of the outer head was prevented by postoperative exercise, in which total loading was initiated after the completion of the radiolucent zone around the outer head and its circumferential zone of osteosclerosis.\r"

Radiolucencies were present in the femoral side in 25%. Radiolucency of more than 2 mm was seen in 20 cases (5%). The complications were six cases of fracture of the plastic insert, four cases of protrusio of the acetabulum, four dislocations, eight cases of loosening of the femoral stem, one deep infection, two superficial infections, 15 cases of thrombophlebitis, one pulmonary embolism, and one death. A careful analysis of these complications and a discussion of their treatment are presented. Reoperations were performed in 20 patients (5%). The universal arthroplasty appears to be a safe and reliable procedure.\r"

The purpose of this study is to determine whether the implant functions as a bipolar device or as a unipolar hemiarthroplasty, which may cause damage to the acetabulum. Of 478 hips replaced from 1973 to 1983, 19 with acetabular changes were randomly selected to evaluate the response of the prosthesis. From the 11 cases with protrusio at the time of surgery, six showed thickening of the acetabular wall, while no changes were observed during ten years follow-up study in the five remaining cases; in one case, the wall gave way, and a revision was necessary. In five patients with subchondral cysts, the cysts tended to gradually disappear. Three patients showed sclerosis in the subchondral acetabular bone, which also decreased gradually. Previous facts suggest the acetabulum tolerates the implant well even with some damage at the time of surgery. Whether this depends on the amount of movement and friction occurring between the head and the insert is still undetermined.\r"

Bone grafting was necessary in most of the patients. Five patients were unavailable for follow-up examination, leaving 96 patients (101 hips), who were followed for an average of two years 11 months (range, two months to 8.5 years). Excellent or good results were obtained in 43 patients; fair results were achieved in 20 patients. Of the nine patients with poor results, five demonstrated roentgenographic evidence of subluxation, and four showed no roentgenographic changes that could explain their persistent pain. Twenty-nine of these bipolar revisions failed and required reoperation. Fourteen of these failures were revised using fixed, cementless devices in conjunction with bone grafting. Ten patients developed deep-wound infection. Nine were treated successfully; the tenth patient died of overwhelming sepsis, her case complicated by multiple infected joint arthroplasties. While the results of revision THA in the present series are not as satisfactory as those reported by others who used fixed cemented or fixed cementless acetabular components, they are superior to the results obtained with excisional arthroplasty, the only alternative in many of these cases.\r"

Digoxin (0.5 to 0.75 mg/day) was given alone and with concomitant administration of quinine (750 mg/day) to reach a steady-state level. In four of the subjects, the study was repeated by administration of equimolar doses of the diastereoisomer quinidine together with digoxin, enabling a within-subject comparison of the effects of the two isomers on digoxin clearance. The biliary excretion of digoxin was studied by use of a modified duodenal marker perfusion technique. A marked reduction was found in the steady-state biliary clearance of digoxin from control value 134 +/- 57 ml/min (mean +/- SD) to 87 +/- 39 ml/min during treatment with quinine (p less than 0.05) and from 95 +/- 24 to 55 +/- 27 ml/min during treatment with quinidine (p less than 0.01; n = 4). Quinidine reduced the renal clearance of digoxin (155 +/- 26 versus 110 +/- 21 ml/min) (p less than 0.05; n = 4), whereas quinine had no such effect (177 +/- 40 versus 185 +/- 53 ml/min; not significant). These findings explain the difference in magnitude between quinidine and quinine in regard to the interaction with digoxin and imply a different degree of stereoselectivity for these isomers in the renal and biliary secretory systems of digoxin.\r"

Codeine and dextromethorphan were used as probe drugs in vitro. The data were compared with the contents of cytochrome P-450IID1 as quantitated by Western immunoblotting by use of a specific monoclonal antibody (MAb 114/2). The O-demethylation of codeine was highly correlated with the O-demethylation of dextromethorphan (r = 0.90). The N-demethylation of codeine was catalyzed at a considerably higher rate than the O-demethylation. The N-demethylation to O-demethylation ratio of codeine was 46 in the poor metabolizer and, on average, 6.2 (range, 2.6 to 11) in the extensive metabolizers, respectively. The band intensity in Western blots correlated with the rate of O-demethylation of codeine (r = 0.95) and of dextromethorphan (r = 0.88) in the extensive metabolizers. The comeasurement of the O-demethylation and N-demethylation of codeine may provide a tool with which to phenotype individuals in vitro with respect to the polymorphism of the cytochrome P-450IID1.\r"

In the first study, nicotine and cotinine were given separately, for 1 hour in four different intravenous doses (3.2, 15.4, 30.9, and 61.7 nmol/min) to each nonsmoker. In the second study, nicotine and cotinine were infused for 4 hours; each subject received five different doses of nicotine (1.5, 3.1, 6.2, 10.8, and 15.4 nmol/min) and one of cotinine (10.8 nmol/min). The concentration of cotinine was constant in both plasma and saliva from 1 to 4 hours after the nicotine infusion; the plateau levels of cotinine were found to be linearly and directly related to the nicotine intake. The ratio of salivary to plasma cotinine was 1:1.27. A linear relationship was also found between nicotine and cotinine infusion rates and the AUC values for cotinine. The fraction metabolized to cotinine was found to be about 0.5. The results from these studies show that: (1) there is a linear relationship between the plateau concentration of cotinine and the amount of nicotine infused over a period of 1 up to 4 hours; (2) salivary cotinine provides the same information on nicotine intake as does plasma cotinine; and (3) single measurements of either plasma or salivary cotinine concentrations at 1 to 4 hours after the exposure could be used to predict the nicotine intake during 1 to 4 hours of environmental tobacco smoke exposure.\r"

Peak serum acifran and radioactivity concentrations were attained 1 to 2 hours after dosing, and the drug was eliminated with a half-life of 1.6 hours. Virtually all of the recovered dose was excreted in the urine. All of the serum and urinary radioactivity was caused by unconjugated acifran. In patients with moderate chronic renal failure, the binding of acifran to plasma proteins was decreased, and the plasma concentrations of total and unbound drug were greater than those of healthy subjects. Renal failure substantially reduced the plasma and renal clearance of total and particularly of unbound acifran, moderately reduced its volume of distribution, and increased its elimination half-life from 1.4 to 1.7 hours to 5.7 hours. The results show that acifran is very well absorbed, is rapidly eliminated, is excreted in the urine, and does not undergo any detectable biotransformation in healthy human subjects.\r"

Using an epidemiologic approach, we examined the hypothesis that serum-caffeine concentration would be positively associated with blood pressure in infrequent (but not habitual) caffeine users in a group of bus drivers. Infrequent and habitual users of caffeine showed no differences in systolic or diastolic blood pressures when there is no measurable caffeine in the serum. However, at serum concentrations of caffeine typical of those achieved after one to two cups of coffee, infrequent users demonstrated greater systolic and diastolic pressures, averaging +5.3 mm Hg and +3.6 mm Hg, respectively, compared with habitual users. The magnitude of difference remained after adjustment for age, body mass index, race, sex, and tobacco and alcohol use. These elevations are large enough to exaggerate the prevalence of hypertension, if such assessments are based on cross-sectional surveys that fail to assess both proximate caffeine consumption and usual caffeine consumption habits.\r"

Saturation binding studies indicated a single class of theophylline binding sites. Theophylline binding capacity (N) was greater in pregnant (N = 4.3 +/- 1.0) than in nonpregnant (N = 3.3 +/- 0.4) subjects, but binding affinity (ka) averaged only 227 +/- 69 (mol/L)-1 in pregnant subjects, compared with 303 +/- 44 (mol/L)-1 in control subjects (F2,17 = 4.26; p = 0.032). At a theophylline plasma concentration of 10 micrograms/ml, the combined effects of hypoalbuminemia and lowered ka would reduce theophylline binding to 31% +/- 3% in pregnant women, compared to 39% +/- 3% in nonpregnant control subjects (p less than 1 x 10(-5]. Nonesterified fatty acid concentrations were similar in both subject groups and did not contribute to the pregnancy-associated decrease in theophylline binding.\r"

The nonrenal clearance of ticarcillin was also significantly higher in patients with cystic fibrosis (24.8 +/- 11.1 versus 13.3 +/- 6.0 ml/min/m2 for the control group; p = 0.006). There was no significant difference in volume of distribution between the two groups. We concluded that the shorter elimination half-life and the higher total body clearance of ticarcillin in patients with cystic fibrosis are a result of an increase in both renal and nonrenal elimination.\r"

The melphalan dose (0.25 mg/kg) was given alone and 5 hours after the administration of human interferon alpha (7 x 10(6) IU/m2), respectively. The plasma concentration of melphalan was determined by liquid chromatography with fluorometric detection after derivatization of melphalan with N-acetylcysteine. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was significantly lower (p = 0.02) when melphalan was given with interferon. There was a significant negative correlation (p = 0.008) between body temperature and dose normalized AUC, whereas no effect was noticed on the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and on the time to obtain Cmax. The rate of elimination showed a tendency (p = 0.06) to increase with increasing body temperature. It is suggested that the cytotoxicity of the drug is most probably enhanced because of the higher alkylating activity of the compound at elevated body temperatures.\r"

Infusion of 5% (w/v) NaCl produced appropriate rises in plasma osmolality and plasma AVP levels which did not differ between the three groups, confirming the normal osmotic release of AVP in the diabetic subjects. 5. During head-up tilt, there were no differences in AVP responses between the three groups, despite a major hypotensive stimulus in the DAN +ve group. 6.

Healthy volunteers were given a 6 h infusion of adrenaline (n = 8), cortisol (n = 8), a triple-hormone combination of adrenaline, cortisol and glucagon (n = 8), or saline (n = 8). 2. The total ribosome concentration declined by 30.4 +/- 7.2% in the triple-hormone group (P less than 0.01), by 26.9 +/- 8.6% in the cortisol group (P less than 0.05) and by 24.8 +/- 11.2% in the adrenaline group (P less than 0.05). The proportion of polyribosomes to total ribosomes decreased by 8.5 +/- 2.2% in the triple-hormone group (P less than 0.05). 3. During hormone infusion the serum glucose levels were enhanced. The insulin concentrations in serum were elevated in the adrenaline group and the triple-hormone group, but not in the cortisol group. Serum insulin decreased in the control group. 4. The results indicate an effect of the combined stress hormone infusion on the total ribosome concentration as well as on the relative abundance of polyribosomes. The single hormones influenced the total ribosome concentration only. The results suggest a critical role for stress hormones in producing the decline in muscle protein synthesis seen after trauma.\r"

We measured methylguanidine in the plasma of dogs with acute ischaemic-induced renal failure and in the plasma and urine of dogs with spontaneous chronic renal insufficiency, using a highly sensitive method involving solid-phase extraction followed by h.p.l.c. with post-column fluorescence detection. 3. Constriction of the remaining renal artery of four uninephrectomized dogs for 90 min resulted in a significant (P less than 0.01) increase in plasma creatinine concentration after 24 h (from 113 +/- 3 to 303 +/- 50 mumol/l; mean +/- SEM). Over the next 14 days, plasma creatinine fell towards baseline concentrations. Plasma methylguanidine also increased significantly (P less than 0.05) 24 h after renal occlusion (from 0.16 +/- 0.04 to 0.86 +/- 0.32 mumol/l) and showed a similar pattern to the plasma creatinine concentration. 4. In a further four dogs, administration of mannitol (2 g/kg) at the time of reperfusion significantly attenuated these responses. 5. Dogs with chronic renal failure demonstrated increased plasma concentrations and urinary excretion of methylguanidine, and the levels appeared to be related to the severity of renal insufficiency. Thus, the dogs with the highest plasma creatinine concentrations and lowest creatinine clearances had the highest plasma methylguanidine concentrations. The clearance of methylguanidine exceeded that of creatinine, indicating that the toxin undergoes renal tubular secretion.\r"

Two theories have been proposed to account for this: the 'underfilling' theory, in which sodium retention is thought to occur secondary to perceived underfilling of the circulation, and the 'overflow' theory, in which sodium retention is considered to be due to a primary renal defect. 2. Using the model of cirrhosis produced by carbon tetrachloride administration in the rat, the ability of the kidney to excrete sodium has been examined in vivo and during isolated perfusion. 3. Cirrhotic animals demonstrated a reduced ability to excrete an acute sodium load: 6 h after 2 mmol of sodium was given by gavage, 27.5 +/- 10.5% had been excreted by the cirrhotic rats and 62.5 +/- 7.0% by control rats (P less than 0.025). 4. In contrast, during isolated perfusion, kidneys from cirrhotic animals excreted the same amount of sodium as control animals over a range of perfusion pressures from 90 to 150 mmHg (12 to 20 kPa). 5. The data are consistent with the view that in cirrhosis the kidney retains sodium in response to immediate external factors.\r"

A de-endothelialized rat aortic ring [maintained at a PO2 of 142 mmHg (18.9 kPa)] was used to bioassay the effluent from a perfused column of bovine endothelial cells grown on microcarrier beads. The endothelial cells were stimulated by 10(-7) mol/l bradykinin given for 1 min at 12 min intervals. 3. At the start, middle and end of the experiment the bovine endothelial cells were exposed to a PO2 of 142 mmHg (18.9 kPa) and when stimulated by bradykinin the perfusate caused respectively a 70 +/- 4%, 63 +/- 6% and 63 +/- 6% (mean +/- SEM) relaxation of an aortic ring which had been pre-contracted by 10(-6) mol/l phenylephrine. At a PO2 of 42 mmHg (5.6 kPa) the relaxation induced by the cells was not significantly altered, but this tailed to zero after 26-38 min exposure of the cells to a PO2 of 15 mmHg (2 kPa). 4. These responses were unaltered by the presence of 10(-5) mol/l indomethacin, suggesting that prostacyclin is not a significant vasodilator in this system. 5. Reduced production of endothelium-derived relaxant factor rather than production of a constrictor factor, or a direct effect on the smooth muscle, may be involved in pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction.\r"

Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on ten patients after operative placement of a prosthetic ascending aortic graft. The MR images were reviewed and a grading system was devised based on appearance of the operative site. An increase in MR signal was noted in some patients between the graft and wrapped native vessel. In 20 percent of patients vascular lumen compromise was noted.

  ".W": "Present-day technology has greatly facilitated the monitoring of respiratory gas exchange in the clinical exercise laboratory. Despite the growing use of these techniques to assess the severity and progression of disease or therapeutic response in patients with heart failure, the long-term reproducibility of oxygen uptake (VO2), carbon dioxide production, minute ventilation, heart rate (HR), and blood pressure at rest and during incremental exercise in such patients, to our knowledge, has not been evaluated. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to quantify the reproducibility of these variables along with exercise duration, maximum VO2 (VO2max) and anaerobic threshold in a group of 16 patients (61 +/- 7 years, 14 male) with chronic, stable cardiac failure of varying severity and etiology who had five or more incremental treadmill exercise tests over a period of time that ranged from 3 to 22 months. For each variable, reproducibility was represented by the coefficient of variation (CVAR). Except for exercise duration, CVAR was not a function of the severity of heart failure and, for all variables, patient-to-patient variation in CVAR was approximately 9 percent. The maximum CVAR for HR, systolic blood pressure, VO2, and VO2max was generally below 10.5 percent and for exercise duration and anaerobic threshold it was less than 12.5 percent. Based on this retrospective analysis, it is concluded that reproducible respiratory gas exchange and HR exercise responses are obtainable over extended periods of time in patients with stable, chronic cardiac failure. Exercise duration, however, is less reproducible in patients with moderate to severe failure.\r"

Serial evaluation of the respiratory health of these six showed all persisted with respiratory symptoms, none had improvement in bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine, and three had a greater than 15 percent decline in FEV1 on one of the days of spirometric testing over the five-year period from 1982 to 1986. Although we could not have predicted the outcome of asthma had these workers left the workplace and ceased isocyanate exposure entirely, occupational asthma persisted despite negligible ongoing TDI exposures.\r"

The relationship of left ventricular to right ventricular function in septic shock is poorly understood. To evaluate right ventricular vs left ventricular performance and to evaluate the relation of biventricular performance to survival, we performed serial hemodynamic and radionuclide angiographic studies in 39 patients with septic shock. Right ventricular ejection fraction was calculated using the two regions of interest method. There were 22 survivors and 17 nonsurvivors. Comparing initial with final (after recovery for survivors; within 24 hours of death for nonsurvivors) studies, each survivor's cardiovascular performance returned toward normal, with significant increases in mean arterial pressure, left and right ventricular ejection fraction, and right ventricular stroke work index. Their profiles also demonstrated significant decreases in central venous pressure, pulmonary artery wedge pressure, pulmonary artery mean pressure, and left and right ventricular end-diastolic volume indices. From initial to final study in the nonsurvivors, there was a statistically significant increase in heart rate but no change in any other cardiovascular parameter, indicating a persistence of the initial cardiovascular dysfunction until death. Comparing serial studies, the pattern of change in right vs left ventricular function was very similar (same direction in 82 percent of patients). Thus, myocardial depression in human septic shock affects both ventricles simultaneously with a similar pattern of dysfunction.\r"

Seven patients who were discharged from the SICU in less than 24 h were excluded from the data analyses. Until discharge from the SICU, patients were monitored daily for development of LRTI or pneumonia. Among 48 patients in the control group, 28 met criteria for LRTI and 19 met criteria for pneumonia. Among 51 patients in the RRKTT group, 13 developed LRTI and 7 developed pneumonia. The differences between groups for all LRTI and pneumonia were both significant. We conclude that continuous postural oscillation decreases the risk of pulmonary sepsis in victims of major blunt trauma.\r"

During the study, there were six episodes of tracheostomy tube (TT) occlusion in six patients included in the PUBCF group. No patient out of 42 included in the HHWS group experienced this complication (p less than 0.01). There were 4 percent of days with thick and tenacious bronchial secretions in the PUBCF group and no case in the HHWS group (p less than 0.02). In the PUBCF group, 23 percent of days with hypothermia were noted as opposed to 12 percent in the HHWS group (p less than 0.01). Fewer breathing circuits were found to be contaminated in the PUBCF group (11 percent) than in the HHWS group (54 percent, p less than 0.01). In patients with an organism growing in bronchial specimens, the same organism was found to contaminate the breathing circuit in 10 percent of cases in the PUBCF group and 77 percent of cases in the HHWS (p less than 0.01). We conclude that, in the conditions of this study, the PUBCF did not provide sufficient humidification of inspired gas in ICU patients.

Acute renal failure and enzymatic abnormalities (AST and LDH) were significantly more common in patients with virologically proven infection with CMV (p less than 0.05). In patients who survived the initial period of bacterial infection, major differences in their clinical course were observed according to their virologic status. After the 15th day of hospitalization following the debridement, the persistence of local infection was more frequent (p less than 0.05) and the mortality was higher (p less than 0.01) in CMV-infected patients. Moreover, the mean duration of hospitalization in the ICU for survivors was 69 +/- 36 days in viral shedders, compared with 48 +/- 27 days in nonshedders (p less than 0.05). Infection with CMV in mediastinitis occurs frequently and is associated with persistence of local infection, prolonged hospitalization, and increased late mortality.\r"

  ".U": "90107544\r", 
  ".W": "Silent ischemia is a common finding in coronary artery disease and occurs more frequently than painful episodes in the total ischemic burden. Since painless ischemia places limits on the history, it can encourage physicians to spend more time studying and treating the electrocardiogram and less time with patients, potentially leading to a deterioration in doctor-patient relationship and care. Silent ischemia should be considered only in patients 35 years of age or older who: (a) have a strong family history of early coronary artery disease, or (b) have two major coronary risk factors. Verification is made by performing an electrocardiographic exercise stress test and followed by a thallium-201 electrocardiographic stress test when the electrocardiograms are equivocal. In females it is best to proceed directly to a thallium-201 electrocardiographic stress test because of the frequency of false positives on the exercise electrocardiograms. The results will help determine the indications for further studies and subsequently the need for drug or interventional management. Frequently a history in which symptoms of lower esophageal disorders, hiatal hernia, gastric disease and arthritic pains mimic angina or in fact coexist with ischemic heart disease makes the clinical diagnosis of angina more elusive and difficult. However, a careful unhurried history and an exercise stress test can often differentiate the etiology of the chest pains. A 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic recording aids in measuring the total ischemic burden. When the diagnosis and severity of the ischemic syndrome is established, a course of medical therapy tailored to the symptoms and with defined end points is initiated. Since silent ischemia and angina frequently coexist, suppression of the frequency and severity of the anginal episodes will also reduce the episodes of silent ischemia. Symptomatic improvement is thus a guide in the treatment of the total ischemic syndrome. Drug management will usually consist of two or more of the following drugs: a nitrate, beta blocker, calcium channel blocker, and aspirin. A 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic recording is helpful in assessing the efficacy of medical management of silent ischemia. Failures in drug management should proceed with coronary angiography, and when indicated, followed by percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft surgery.\r"

Comparisons have been made of national vital statistics data for age groups 55-64 years, 65-74 years and 75-84 years. From 1969 to 1978, under the 8th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), the COPD and asthma category included the codes 490-493 and, for the US and Canada, a special code 519.3. From 1979, under the 9th revision, COPD and asthma codes 490-493, 496 were in use in all three countries. The analyses of US, Canadian and French data show lower death rates for COPD and asthma in France. The ratio of male to female deaths from COPD increased with age in the US and Canada, but not in France. The proportion of COPD and asthma deaths attributed to bronchitis was higher in France. An increased use of code 496 (under 9th revision) was observed in the US and above all in Canada. In the three countries, death rates increased faster between 1979 and 1983 in women than in men and increases in women were steeper in the US and Canada than in France. Intercountry comparability is better for COPD mortality in the 9th revision than the 8th revision. Some differences observed between the three countries can be partly explained by coding practices and ICD revisions, but, allowing for differences in coding and classifying respiratory causes of death as well as ICD revisions, death rates are obviously higher in the US and Canada than in France. This suggests that the difference is real.\r"

The purpose of this study was to compare venous oxygen tension and blood lactate gradients with blood gradients of purine nucleotide degradation products which are derived from tissue ATP catabolism during hypovolemic shock. Sixteen dogs were instrumented to sample arterial and venous blood. Measurements of arteriovenous lactate and PNDP gradients during spontaneous respiration were examined at four tissue sites: gut, kidney, hindlimb, and diaphragm. Hypovolemic shock (mean arterial blood pressure 35 to 40 mm Hg) was induced and maintained for one hour. The above parameters were remeasured at 30 and 60 minutes after induction of shock. Hypoxanthine gradients were greater than that of other PNDP, and so were used as the primary indicator of tissue ATP metabolism. In the hindlimb, the mean AV gradients for hypoxanthine (1 +/- 1 microM) were not significantly greater than baseline, while the lactate gradient (700 +/- 300 microM) rose markedly. In contrast, across the kidney there was a significantly greater AV hypoxanthine gradient (16 +/- 3 microM, p less than 0.002) but no lactate gradient (-400 +/- 200 microM). Both the hypoxanthine and lactate AV gradients were significantly elevated across the diaphragm and gut. Venous PO2 values less than 35 mm Hg predicted an increased hypoxanthine gradient across the kidney, but not across the hindlimb. We conclude that the metabolic response to hypovolemic shock as assessed by PNDP gradients, lactate gradients, and venous PO2 differs among tissues. Although resting muscle such as the hindlimb may be an important source of blood lactate, the viscera and working skeletal muscle (the diaphragm) are major contributors to circulating PNDP.\r"

Only three of the 515 patients had symptomatic venous thromboembolism on follow-up. The frequency of symptomatic pulmonary embolism on follow-up was one of 515 patients.

Electron microscopy of AMs disclosed features of paraffin-laden cytoplasmic vacuoles. Successive treatments included prednisolone and cyclophosphamide. Despite these treatments and withdrawal from exposure, the pulmonary function became impaired progressively, resulting in restrictive syndrome and severe exertional dyspnea. Concomitantly, PMNs harvested by BAL increased, whereas initial lymphocytosis decreased. This is the first case observed of occupational interstitial fibrosis in which electron-microscopic findings clearly established a relationship with an exposure to paraffin. This observation also emphasizes the switch from alveolitis to fibrosis in the pathogenesis of interstitial pulmonary disease.\r"

The clubbed yellow nail may indicate the presence of lung cancer. In contrast to the ominous nature of the clubbed yellow nail, we describe a sign that is more propitious: the sudden cessation of smoking due to an intercurrent disease, often a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), leads to the development of a distinct line of demarcation between the distal pigmented nail and the newly emerging proximal nonpigmented nail. We propose the term \"harlequin nail\" for this curious physical sign. By measurement of the distance between the proximal nail base fold and the line of demarcation, we can deduce the date smoking ceased (and, by inference, the approximate date of a CVA in a patient unable to volunteer this information). This sign also serves as a reminder that the \"nicotine nail\" remains discolored only because of dynamic restaining of the nail with tobacco by-products.\r"

The present report describes three patients who developed life-threatening bradycardia following electrical cardioversion for atrial tachyarrhythmias in the setting of an acute myocardial infarction. All three patients had multivessel coronary artery disease with a totally occluded right coronary artery and a possibility of ischemic sinus node dysfunction. When electrical cardioversion is undertaken for new onset of atrial tachyarrhythmia in the setting of an acute myocardial infarction, measures for immediate, temporary pacing should be easily available.\r"

The patients had been submitted to tracheostomy (71 patients) or had received a weight-loss recommendation (127 patients). Despite a lower mean apnea index (AI) (43 vs 69) and a lower mean body mass index (BMI) (31 vs 34 kg/m2) at entry, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and vascular morbidity were significantly higher in the conservatively treated group. The relative risk (odds ratio) of finding EDS in the conservatively treated group, after adjustment for BMI at seven-year follow-up, was 3.7 (95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 2.6-5.3). The relative risk of developing new vascular problems in the same population, estimated by Cox models, was 2.3 (95 percent CI = 1.5-3.6). The effect of tracheostomy, independent of age, BMI, and AI at entry, was highly significant. At entry, 56 percent of the population already had a vascular problem, particularly hypertension, thus emphasizing the need for earlier treatment of the sleep-related abnormal breathing.\r"

  ".W": "Bronchial histamine provocation tests were performed in nine patients with nonallergic asthma on four consecutive days 45 minutes after inhalation of placebo or ipratropium bromide in a dose-response manner (40 micrograms, 200 micrograms, and 800 micrograms). The drugs were administered double-blind, one dose on each day. This procedure was repeated identically after three to nine months to investigate whether the bronchial responses to ipratropium bromide are constant or change with time. Ipratropium bromide induced a significantly better bronchodilation and protection against histamine-induced bronchoconstriction than placebo with no differences between the three doses. No correlation between bronchodilatation and protection was found. In six asthmatic patients (\"responders\") ipratropium bromide induced a significant protective effect against histamine-induced bronchoconstriction but no dose-response relationship was found. In three patients none or a very poor protective effect was found at all dose levels (\"nonresponders\"). The protective effect of ipratropium bromide against histamine-induced bronchoconstriction did not differ between the first and second occasion. Thus, the bronchoprotection differed between different asthmatic subjects but did not vary with time (three to nine months) within the same subject. This finding seems to be of clinical importance since it implicates that the effect of anticholinergic agents on the airways is predictable.\r"

To confirm these findings in a more comprehensive study, we collected plasma samples from 137 consecutive patients undergoing 148 ventilation-perfusion lung scans for pulmonary embolism. DNA was measured using a counter-immunoelectrophoresis technique that used high titer precipitating double-stranded DNA antibody from a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus. In addition to 17 patients (17 lung scans) excluded for not having plasma collected, 32 patients (37 lung scans) were excluded for having either a condition other than pulmonary embolism that could be associated with plasma DNA or for having nonacute symptoms. Eighteen of 22 patients with a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (defined by either a high probability lung scan or abnormal pulmonary angiogram) had detectable plasma DNA. Only four of 27 patients without pulmonary embolism (defined by either a normal lung scan or normal pulmonary angiogram) had plasma DNA detected. Based on these results, plasma DNA had a sensitivity of 82 percent and a specificity of 85 percent for this condition. Plasma DNA is a promising test for pulmonary embolism and could help physicians interpret equivocal lung scan findings and thereby clarify difficult decisions such as the need for pulmonary angiography.\r"

DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Tertiary university referral center. PATIENTS: Consecutive sample of 50 patients with clinical picture suggestive of pulmonary infection and single or multiple cavitation of at least 1 cm in diameter on chest x-ray films, and lack of clinical suspicion of active pulmonary tuberculosis. One patient was excluded from the study after demonstration of tuberculosis by PLA. INTERVENTIONS: Lung aspirates were obtained under fluoroscopic guidance by introduction of a 22-gauge disposable spinal needle within the abscess cavity and were immediately transported to the bacteriology laboratory and pathology department for processing. All patients were initially treated with clindamycin. Tobramycin was added in all those patients with hospital-acquired infection, lack of foulness of sputum, and those who were initially severely ill. Definite treatment was based on the results of bacteriologic cultures. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Cultures of LAs were positive in 82 percent (40/49) of patients. In 20 cases the isolates were monobacterial (13 aerobic bacteria and seven anaerobic). In the remaining 20 cases, cultures grew more than one kind of bacteria (four exclusively aerobic, five exclusively anaerobic, and 11 mixed), with an average of 3.25 types of bacteria per case. Anaerobes were found as a single bacteria or associated with other aerobic bacteria in only 58 percent (23/40). The results of LA cultures led to change in the initial antibiotic trial in 23 patients (47 percent). Of ten cases in which bronchogenic carcinoma was demonstrated, cytologic study of LA was done in nine, and eight had positive cytologic yield. Pneumothorax occurred in seven cases (14 percent) as the sole complication. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Percutaneous lung aspiration had a high diagnostic yield and accuracy in our series, with a relatively low incidence of complications. (2) Anaerobic bacteria were less frequently implicated in our cases than previously reported. This finding led to significant changes in the initial empiric antibiotic treatment.\r"

Two subjects experienced severe nausea and vomiting during thiabendazole therapy. There were no significant differences in theophylline pharmacokinetic parameters during mebendazole therapy. Thiabendazole administration results in a significant decrease in theophylline clearance and beta elimination rate constant. The theophylline half-life increased significantly. Concomitant administration of theophylline and thiabendazole resulted in severe nausea and vomiting. Mebendazole administration did not seem to alter theophylline pharmacokinetics.\r"

We measured the total IgG and IgA levels in all samples and determined the anti-P32 titer after adjusting IgG and IgA respectively to the same levels in all samples. Those pleural fluids and sera from tuberculous patients contained a higher proportion of anti-P32 antibodies than samples obtained from nontuberculous control subjects; in those patients, the proportion of anti-P32 antibodies was generally higher in pleural effusion fluid than in serum.\r"

In all patients, pulmonary function studies, chest x-ray films, and lung scintigraphic studies were performed prior to and at the end of radiotherapy as well as three months later. No consistent or significant alteration in either parameter was detected. No patient developed clinical symptoms suggestive of radiation-induced lung changes, although in one of them, major radiologic features were found that were consistent with radiation pneumonitis; those changes disappeared completely in the course of the subsequent months. It is concluded that the tangential beam technique for postoperative irradiation as used in these patients is largely safe as regards pulmonary function, perfusion, and ventilation.\r"

Comparative computed tomography specific diagnoses in those 31 cases was made in 65 percent, and suggestive in 23 percent. Computed tomography was particularly useful diagnostically in cases of retrograde obstruction on contrast enema. The authors conclude that contrast enema should be the primary mode of approach, while computed tomography can be a valuable follow-up when the diagnosis is still in doubt, or if it is possible that patient management might be altered by additional information.\r"

All patients had a third-degree or fourth-degree perineal laceration. The median age was 30 (range, 24 to 38) years. Anal manometry revealed low resting and squeeze pressures with a mean pressure of 28.7 +/- 5.3 mm Hg (normal, 60 to 80 mm Hg) and 42.5 +/- 5.9 mm Hg (normal, 100 to 150 mm Hg), respectively. Seven of nine patients had specific anterior quadrant defects demonstrated by cross-sectional analysis of the sphincter. In addition, five patients had evidence of global defects of the sphincter or relatively low pressures in other portions of the sphincter. Follow-up manometric data were obtained in four patients after reconstruction of the sphincter and demonstrated a mean improvement of resting and squeeze pressures of 5.1 mm Hg and 16.0 mm Hg, respectively. Although specific anterior defects may be expected with the history of obstetric trauma, the presence of global defects of the sphincter was unexpected and may support the role of injury to the innervation of the musculature of the pelvic floor as a contributing cause of fecal incontinence after childbirth. Anal manometry provides a quantitative assessment of sphincter function and dysfunction and is an important part of the preoperative assessment of patients with fecal incontinence from obstetric injuries.\r"

Twelve subjects previously had a small-bowel resection or had part of their small bowel out of circuit (mean 95 cm) (Group I) while 12 had an intact small bowel (Group II). The mean peak plasma concentration of N-ac-5-ASA was 1.11 micrograms/ml in Group 1 subjects compared with 2.80 micrograms/ml in Group II subjects (P = N.S.). On average, 53.0 percent of the ingested Rowasa I was detected in the 24-hr ileostomy effluent of Group I subjects compared with 45.3 percent in the Group II subjects (P = N.S.). The mean recovery of 5-ASA and N-ac-5-ASA in urine was 8.5 percent in Group I and 35.6 percent in Group II subjects (P less than 0.001). These studies demonstrate that 5-ASA is released and present in the small bowel following oral ingestion of Rowasa I in patients who have or have not had small bowel resections.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to determine if the construction of an ileal reservoir induces mucosal changes that can potentiate the effect of a chemical carcinogen (1,2-dimethylhydrazine) on ileal mucosa. Animals were divided into three groups: 1) sham operation (n = 19), 2) total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (n = 20), 3) total colectomy with an ileal reservoir made of terminal ileum sutured to the rectum (n = 20). An adaptation period of 12 weeks was allowed to promote fecal stasis and the histologic changes before exposure to weekly subcutaneous injections of DMH (25 mg/kg) for 16 weeks. Sodium butyrate was added to the diet as a tumor promotor. All animals were sacrificed one month later. Fecal stasis, along with enlargement, occurred in all the reservoirs (mean dimensions, 74 X 58 X 43 mm). Their mean volume was 88 +/- 14 ml. The histologic changes in the ileal reservoirs were: chronic inflammation (14/20), villous atrophy (14/20), and atrophy of the glands (8/20). In group 3, five carcinomas were seen. There were three in the duodenum and two in the reservoirs. In contrast, 21 carcinomas were detected in the control groups. There were 17 in the colon, 3 in the jejunum, and 1 in the ileum. No significant difference in the number of carcinomas was seen in the ileum with and without reservoir. Although it is possible to induce carcinomas in ileal reservoirs, the incidence remained significantly less than in the colon. In conclusion, the histologic changes induced by the construction of an ileal reservoir do not increase the risk of malignant transformation in the DMH model for intestinal carcinogenesis.\r"

Signs of functional outlet obstruction occurred in 74 percent. Transit times were normal in 33 percent. Measurement of colonic transit time in patients with disordered evacuation studies is useless from a clinical point of view, because abnormal segmental transit time is the result of outlet obstruction in most cases and will return to normal after adequate treatment. Only when evacuation studies are normal, or have become normal after treatment and constipation persists, are segmental transit studies indicated because they may demonstrate primary slow transit constipation. Primary slow transit constipation probably is caused by impaired motility of the whole gastrointestinal tract. As small-bowel transit time increases, defecation frequency decreases, laxatives are taken again, and abdominal pain persists. Surgery should be performed with restraint.\r"

The authors performed colonic anastomoses on 45 male albino rats, which were divided into three groups. Measurements of collagen synthesis and counts of inflammatory cells in the first group were evaluated as control data. They administered 2000 units aprotinin daily for two days in the second group and 2 micrograms PGE1 daily for two days in the third group. Collagen content as hydroxyproline in the resected anastomotic part of the colon was measured and the inflammatory cells were counted on the first, third, fifth, and tenth days. The results showed that PGE1-administered rats had significantly higher collagen levels (5.21 +/- 1.35 micrograms hydroxyproline/mgr tissue, P less than 0.05 and 3.81 +/- 0.63 micrograms/mg, P less than 0.05) on the third and fifth days, respectively, compared with the control and aprotinin groups. The aprotinin group also had higher collagen levels (3.34 +/- 0.27 micrograms/mg, P less than 0.05 and 3.07 +/- 0.40 micrograms/mg, P less than 0.05) on the third and fifth days, respectively, compared with the control group. There were no statistically important differences in the collagen contents of the control, aprotinin, and PGE1 groups on the tenth day and there was an increase in the collagen content in all groups (P less than 0.05). The inflammatory cells, including PMNs, histiocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells, which play an important role in the inflammatory stage of colonic anastomotic healing, were also counted. The cells were counted on the third, fifth, and tenth days and the results were evaluated as (+) positive and more positive. The results of the control and aprotinin groups were found as ( ), ( ), and (++) on the third, fifth, and tenth days, respectively. In the PGE1-administered group the inflammatory cells were counted as (+), (++), and (++) on the third, fifth, and tenth days, respectively. In addition, there was an increase in fibroblast synthesis and new vessel formation on the tenth day. Thus, it was shown that PGE1 decreased inflammatory cells and increased collagen synthesis in the early stage of colonic anastomoses and fibroblasts in the late stage more effectively when compared with the control and aprotinin groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Review of the characteristics and presentations of these patients suggested that these individuals may harbor a more severe form of FAP. This may be due, in part, to the delay in diagnosis and, therefore, a higher rate of development of colorectal carcinoma and possibly duodenal adenomas. There is also a demonstrable higher rate of extracolonic manifestations of FAP present in this subset of patients. When selecting the initial type of prophylactic colonic resection the surgeon should bear in mind the increased incidence of extracolonic manifestations of the disease in this group of patients and their potential for complications.\r"

In 34 patients, upper gastrointestinal examination disclosed either obstruction or failure of contrast to reach the cecum in 24 hours; all 34 patients required surgery. The remaining 23 patients who had upper gastrointestinal studies recovered with tube decompression. Barium enema demonstrated obstruction in 13 (33 percent) of 39 cases of suspected small-bowel obstruction and localized obstruction in the colon rather than small bowel in 9 of 13 cases. Barium enema was 100 percent predictive of surgery when obstruction was shown, but was not helpful in predicting surgery when obstruction was not demonstrated. Surgery was required in 42 percent of patients whose barium enema did not show obstruction. Barium enema also was performed in 19 of 23 patients with large-bowel obstruction and showed the level of obstruction in all cases. All patients with large-bowel obstruction required surgery except for three who recovered after barium-enema reduction of intussusception or volvulus. Barium upper gastrointestinal examination is recommended in small-bowel obstruction when plain films are nondiagnostic, and in selected cases of small-bowel obstruction that do not resolve with a short trial of tube decompression. Barium enema is not recommended in suspected small-bowel obstruction but should be performed in all cases of large-bowel obstruction, except when perforation is a possibility or when the cecum measures 10 cm or larger in diameter.\r"

There were six men and two women with a mean age of 40 +/- 3 years at the time of survey. The mean age of the patients at the time of diagnosis was 23.8 years (range, 16 to 41 years). Results were compared with eight consecutive patients operated on for Hirschsprung's disease during the neonatal period. The Duhamel operation was performed initially on seven patients in the adult group and on all patients in the neonatal group. Anterior resection was performed on one adult patient initially but this was converted subsequently to Soave's pull-through operation. None of the patients had constipation after definitive surgery. The mean defecation frequency was two in both groups. Three patients in the adult group and two patients in the neonatal group were completely continent, others had occasional soiling. The mean anal sphincter pressures were lower in the neonatal group than in the adult group and in each group lower than in normal controls. Adult Hirschsprung's disease must always be suspected in the context of chronic constipation. Functional results after surgery in adult patients are similar to those achieved in children.\r"

The purpose of this study was to characterize the features of gastrointestinal malignancies that developed in Crohn's patients. In this retrospective review the authors identified six patients with Crohn's disease who developed such lesions over a 20-year period: four patients had colorectal cancers and two had ileal malignant neoplasms. Patients averaged 52.7 years of age (range, 21 to 61 years). Three patients were men and three women. Five of the six patients had endured Crohn's disease for more than 20 years. Only two lesions were diagnosed before surgery. The colorectal lesions were predominantly right-sided and all occurred in bowel segments with active Crohn's disease. The lesions demonstrated aggressive histologic features: three of six tumors were poorly differentiated, one of the five adenocarcinomas was mucinous, and three of the colorectal cancers were Dukes' B or C lesions. Four of six patients survived five or more years. There was a single malignant carcinoid, which represents the seventh case report of a carcinoid tumor occurring in a patient with Crohn's disease. This study indicates that patients with Crohn's disease develop a wide variety of small bowel and colorectal cancers. Furthermore, it suggests that Crohn's patients with colonic disease should periodically undergo surveillance colonoscopy.\r"

The procedures were performed in the office on 212 consecutive, nonselected patients. Intravenous sedation was not started initially, and all procedures were begun without medication. If the patient developed significant discomfort or sharp pain, intravenous diazepam (Valium, Roche, Nutley, NJ) or midazolam (Versed, Roche, Nutley, NJ) was given. Total colonoscopy was successful in 201 (95 percent) patients. Of these procedures, 173 (82 percent) patients required no analgesia or sedation. In the remaining 39 (18 percent) patients, only small doses of Valium or Versed were necessary. There were 2 (1 percent) complications, but they were directly related to polypectomy (stalk bleeding, serosal burn) and not to the colonoscopy. Patient acceptance was high because most of the patients were able to leave the office immediately after the procedure and many (at least 82 percent) were able to return to work or resume normal activities that same day. Intravenous sedation is routinely used during total colonoscopy by most practitioners and is considered the standard of care in most communities. However, the need for sedation during total colonoscopy has never been proven and is probably not necessary in most cases. Furthermore, when sedation is necessary, most patients are probably over-anesthetized. This is significant, as it may make total colonoscopy more accessible, less expensive, and safer.\r"

A technique of dilatation is described that is usually reserved for esophageal stricture, namely, Eder Puestow dilatation over a guide wire inserted under direct vision. Although this technique may not be without risk, this readily available equipment may be valuable in making a further resection unnecessary.\r"

The aim of the present study was to select, among several clinical and functional variables those that could best predict survival at one year. The data collected from 91 consecutive patients with parenchymal cirrhosis hospitalized in our center from February 1984 to January 1986 were subjected to stepwise logistic regression analysis. Death occurring during the first year following entry into the study was considered as a failure. During that period, there were no censored patients. Of 19 variables that entered into the analysis, only two were significant (P less than 0.01): presence (1: moderate; 2: severe) or absence (0) of ascites (A) and breath test (BT: % aminopyrine activity of administered dose at 2 hr). The logistic equation was: 1n (P/1 - P): - 1.95 A + 1.64 BT - 0.393, where P represented the probability of survival at one year. For each patient, P was calculated according to his A and BT values. Using a 0.7 probability cut-point to separate success from failure, 93% (70/75) of successes, 81% (13/16) of failures, and 91% (83/91) of both successes and failures could be correctly predicted. Predictive equations like the present preliminary one can be used in the future to better assess the risk of mortality in patients with parenchymal cirrhosis in whom liver transplantation is considered.\r"

  ".W": "The influences of acute or chronic nicotine pretreatment on ethanol-induced changes on gastric secretion, mucosal blood flow (GMBF), and glandular mucosal damage were studied in anesthetized rats. Ethanol administration decreased gastric acid secretion and GMBF, which were accompanied by a marked increase in gastric mucosal damage. Acute nicotine incubation 2 or 4 mg dose-dependently elevated both the titratable acid in the luminal solution and the gastric secretory volume; it also prevented the depressive action on GMBF and gastric mucosal damage in ethanol-treated animals. Chronic nicotine treatment for 10 days reduced the inhibitory action of ethanol on gastric acid secretion; the higher dose (25 micrograms/ml drinking water) potentiated the decrease of GMBF and the ulcerogenic property of ethanol. However, chronic treatment with the lower dose (5 micrograms/ml drinking water) had the opposite effects; it also markedly increased the gastric secretory volume. It is concluded that acute nicotine pretreatment elevates, whereas chronic nicotine pretreatment differentially affects GMBF. These effects could account for their protective or preventive actions on ethanol ulceration. The increase in nonacid gastric secretory volume by nicotine could partially explain its antiulcer effect. Furthermore, the acid secretory state of the stomach appears unrelated to the ulcerogenic property of ethanol.\r"

Models utilized rats and included a cell-free in vitro system and the in vivo, single-pass, perfused jejunal segment. In vitro all amino acids and oligopeptides tested significantly inhibited pyridoxal 5'-phosphate decay (hydrolysis). The degree of inhibition of decay was dependent on the particular compound used, the concentration of that compound, and the pH of the medium. Similar effects for L-lysine concentration and perfusate pH were demonstrated in perfused segments in vivo; by contrast, L-lysine had no effect on pyridoxine uptake. These studies demonstrate that intraluminal hydrolysis of phosphorylated vitamin B6 may be modulated by yet other intraluminal constituents and conditions.\r"

We describe a patient with Crohn's ileitis who was assumed to have two enterovesical fistulae from his diseased ileum. Laparotomy revealed a Meckel's diverticulum with fistulization to the bladder. The diverticulum contained inflamed and ulcerated ectopic gastric mucosa but was not affected by Crohn's disease. We know of only one other report of an enterovesical fistula resulting from a Meckel's diverticulum. In that case, however, the diverticulum did not contain ectopic tissue.\r"

The nutritional absorptive capacity and digestive motility was studied for 18 months postoperatively. His absorptive capacity reached subnormal values allowing him oral nutritive autonomy and normal social life. The results of the manometric study suggested that the reversed segment delayed intestinal transit time. The prolonged contact of the chyme with the intestinal absorptive mucosa possibly increased its absorptive capacity. Our data and the literature reports suggest that reversal of a bowel loop could help wean patients from their dependence on parenteral nutrition.\r"

The indications for transplantation were: hepatoma in three, acute liver failure in two, and progressive chronic liver disease in five. One patient died during surgery. Of the remaining nine who survived the operation, one died at six months as a result of bronchial aspiration and aspiration pneumonia, and a second transplanted for hepatoma died five months later with metastases. Seven patients are alive 6 months to 6 1/2 years following transplantation. Of these seven patients, six have normal liver function and a good performance status. One is awaiting retransplantation for chronic rejection. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was found either preoperatively or incidentally in five patients, all older than 2 years at the time of their transplant. Four of these are alive and well without evidence of tumor with follow-ups between 3 1/2 and 6 1/2. Four of the five patients less than 2 years of age had hepatocellular dysplasia without evidence of carcinoma on histologic examination of the resected liver. This experience suggests that liver transplantation should be considered seriously for children with hereditary tyrosinemia who are more than 2 years of age because beyond that age the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) increases substantially.\r"

Twenty-eight cases of brown pigment stones were studied and divided into two groups: those with and those without bacteria possessing bile acid-deconjugating activity. In the former, free bile acid amounted to 62 +/- 34% of the total bile acid, while in the latter, only 0.1% of total bile acid was free bile acid. The fraction of total bile acid made up of free bile acids was found to be consistently higher in brown pigment stones than in the corresponding bile, irrespective of the presence or absence of biliary infection. Free bile acid is present in negligible amounts in normal bile. Total bile acid concentration in the bile of patients with brown pigment stones was significantly less than that of controls (13 vs 50 mg/ml). Biliary infection is almost always present in cases with brown pigment stones. These findings suggest that bacterial infection is present at the initiation of brown pigment stone formation as well as during the period of ensuing stone growth.\r"

A single study performed in 15 patients with exudative malignant ascites and 29 patients with alcoholic liver disease demonstrated that a SAAG of less than 1.1 was essentially diagnostic of a malignant origin of the ascites. In an effort to confirm and extend these observations to individuals with nonalcoholic liver disease, 24 patients with nonalcoholic liver disease and 11 with alcoholic liver disease undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation (OTLx) were studied. At the time of liver transplantation, each had their serum and ascitic fluid albumin levels determined, the gradient calculated, and their portal venous pressure (PVP) as well as the corrected portal venous pressure (PPc) measured directly. A significant correlation (r = 0.624) between the PPc and the SAAG was found in the 11 alcoholics (P less than 0.05). No such correlation existed for those with nonalcoholic liver disease (r = 0.398). Moreover, a SAAG less than 1.1 was found in three of nonalcoholics with cirrhosis in the absence of an abdominal malignancy. We conclude that (1) the SAAG and PPc are statistically related to each other in individuals with alcoholic liver disease but not in those with a nonalcoholic cause for cirrhosis, and (2) SAAG less than 1.1 is not diagnostic of abdominal malignancy but can occur in those with advanced nonmalignant hepatic disease.\r"

In 40 subjects the propagation sequence of phasic contractions could be evaluated and were simultaneous in 53%, antegrade in 35%, and retrograde in 11% of the waves. In 20 subjects, pressure measurements done at the common bile duct sphincter waves. In 20 subjects, pressure measurements done at the common bile duct sphincter were similar to those obtained at the pancreatic duct sphincter. In 10 subjects, pressure values obtained at the common bile duct sphincter within a week were similar. Our study should help to establish standards for normal manometric values of the sphincter of Oddi and emphasizes the importance of having a healthy volunteer group from which to obtain the normal values of sphincter of Oddi motor function.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of a single oral dose of loxiglumide, a cholecystokinin antagonist, on postprandial gallbladder contraction and on gastric emptying was evaluated in humans. Following a 12-hr fasting period, two tablets of loxiglumide (400 mg each) or placebo was administered on different days, in random order and in a double-blind fashion to 10 healthy volunteers 15 min before the ingestion of a 1050-kcal standard meal. Gallbladder and antral volumes were measured by real-time ultrasonography in basal conditions and at fixed time intervals after the meal. Oral loxiglumide administration was followed by a total inhibition of the gallbladder contraction for 60 min after the end of the meal ingestion. Thereafter, up to the end of the study period, gallbladder volume was larger than that of the placebo study (at 300 min after the meal 2.7 +/- 1.6 ml after placebo and 8.2 +/- 3.5 ml after loxiglumide; P less than 0.008). No difference between placebo and loxiglumide was found in the antral volumes at any time interval (postprandial 63.5 +/- 16.5 ml after placebo and 59.4 +/- 24 ml after loxiglumide; at 300 min after the meal 20.8 +/- 13.3 ml after placebo and 18.9 +/- 9.5 ml after loxiglumide). In conclusion, a single oral dose of loxiglumide at the dose of 800 mg can inhibit postprandial gallbladder contraction without affecting gastric emptying. It would therefore appear that in man endogenous CCK, released after a solid-liquid, caloric, nutrient-balanced meal, plays a major role in the contraction of the gallbladder but does not affect gastric emptying.\r"

Since it has been suggested that bile acid may influence pancreatic secretion indirectly by interacting with luminal protease activities, intraduodenal protease activities were eliminated by pancreatic juice diversion accompanied with simultaneous intraduodenal infusion of aprotinin. This treatment resulted in gradual increases in pancreatic juice flow, bicarbonate and protein outputs, and an increase in plasma cholecystokinin levels, reaching plateau levels 2 hr after the start of the treatment. When endogenous bile was excluded from the intestine, the pancreatic secretion and plasma cholecystokinin concentrations further increased. The intraduodenal infusion of sodium taurocholate during bile pancreatic juice diversion inhibited cholecystokinin release, while pancreatic protein output was only transiently decreased. The results indicate that bile in the duodenum directly regulates cholecystokinin release, probably through its major components, bile salts.\r"

Moreover, cyclosporine has several untoward effects that might occur as a consequence of alterations in sex hormone activity. To evaluate these questions the following experiments were performed. Estrogen and androgen receptors in cytosol were quantitated in livers of rats treated with cyclosporine or olive oil vehicle before and after partial hepatectomy or a sham operation. Ornithine decarboxylase activity and thymidine kinase activity were assessed as indices of hepatic regeneration. Preoperative levels of estrogen receptor activity in the hepatic cytosol were significantly greater in rats treated with cyclosporine as compared to vehicle treated controls (P less than 0.01). In contrast, preoperative levels of androgen receptor activity in the cyclosporine-treated and vehicle-treated animals were similar. Following partial hepatectomy, a reduction in the activity of both sex hormone receptors in the hepatic cytosol was observed and was compatible with results described previously in normal animals. Unexpectedly the preoperative levels of ornithine decarboxylase (P less than 0.01) and thymidine kinase activity (P less than 0.01) were significantly greater in the rats treated with cyclosporine as compared to the vehicle treated controls. As expected, ornithine decarboxylase activity (at 6 hr) and thymidine kinase activity (at 24 hr) rose and peaked in response to a partial hepatectomy but were significantly greater (P less than 0.05) in the rats treated with cyclosporine as compared to the vehicle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These findings are not compatible with some of the current theories on the origin of these epithelia. The mucosa of the inlet patch has been considered to consist of heterotopic gastric mucosa. The mucosa of the adult human stomach, however, does not contain glucagon cells. These cells are only present in the early embryonic stomach, and they disappear during embryonogenesis. According to our findings, the mucosa of the inlet patch therefore represents embryonic gastric mucosa. The specialized columnar epithelium of Barrett's esophagus has been considered to have evolved from gastric mucous neck cells. However, although glucagon cells are a feature of the embryonic stomach, neurotensin-immunoreactive cells have not been found in the gastric mucosa. Our study suggests that the specialized columnar epithelium of Barrett's esophagus originates from a very immature multipotent gastrointestinal stem cell.\r"

It is essential that the medical director or a designee responsible for quality assurance activities be allotted the necessary time to carry them out properly. Incident reports, critique sessions, audits, education (training) sessions, observation or debriefing in the emergency department, as well as on-line medical control all play a role in inputting data into the system. The quality assurance program forms a continuous action loop starting and ending with protocols and education. Documentation of variance or compliance with protocols forms the basis for analysis of the quality of care delivered. Any intervention must be based on carefully documented information and should include praise for good work, as well as education when needed, and restriction of function when necessary.\r"

Although less expensive than the fully automated system, semen analysis by Autosperm is a subjective and labor-intensive method. Furthermore in comparison, data obtained using Autosperm also provide less information, and agreements of matched data with those obtained by the conventional methods were not significantly better.\r"

The Autosperm system either over- or underestimated the sperm concentration in comparison with the conventional analysis and more often underestimated the sperm concentration in comparison with the automated CellSoft system analysis. Comparison of the results for percent sperm motility by the conventional and Autosperm analyses showed that the latter tended to underestimate the percentage of fast-swimming spermatozoa and overestimate the percentage of slow-swimming spermatozoa. There were considerable variations in the measurement of sperm movement characteristics between the Autosperm and time-exposure photomicrographic and automated CellSoft system analyses, respectively. These findings demonstrate that the performance of the Autosperm system does not agree well with those of the currently available methods employed in the present study. Part of the disagreement in measurements of sperm parameters could be because of the subjective elements inherent in the semi-automated Autosperm analysis.\r"

Why, in the male, serology does not correlate with chlamydial infection in a more remote past is explained.

Another sample was taken from 58 patients who underwent a second insemination procedure. In 16 of the 58 patients the IBT results were positive for one or more immunoglobulin classes. Five patients showed positive SITs. In 7 out of these 16 subjects (12%) the antibodies were bound to the head and to the shaft of the sperm tail. Five of the six patients submitted to a third intraperitoneal insemination procedure showed unchanged SIT values and IBT binding percentages. In one subject, SIT (6 months after the third insemination) became negative. Antibody production may be either a transient response to massive antigen stimulation or the first step toward systemic immunity.\r"

In each controlled assay, sperm binding from men of known fertility with/without preincubation with different carbohydrate constituents was compared. We used human prophase I oocytes obtained from surgically removed ovaries; these oocytes were stored in salt solution and later bisected by micromanipulation. Preincubation of sperm (1 hour) with fucoidin (1.0 mg/mL) significantly inhibited binding by more than 85% as compared with controls. Similarly, lesser fucoidin concentrations of 0.5, 0.25, and 0.01 mg/mL were markedly inhibitory. In addition, preincubation times of 60, 30, and 15 minutes were not different in their degree of inhibitory effect. On the other hand, preincubation of the hemizonae with fucoidin before HZA inhibited binding by 43% compared with controls. Here, the fucoidin effect was significantly less inhibitory than the sperm preincubation effect of fucoidin. Preincubation of sperm with d-fucose had no measurable effect on binding, whereas d-glucose (1.0 mg/mL) and 1-fucose (1.0 mg/mL) increased binding. These results indicate: (1) that the HZA provides a unique internally controlled homologous bioassay to evaluate the effects of simple and complex carbohydrates on sperm zona interactions; (2) that fucoidin is an immediate (less than 15 minutes) inhibitor of human sperm binding to the human zona pellucida under HZA conditions.\r"

All of the gonadotropin surges induced oocyte maturation and enhanced progesterone (P) secretion. Ovulated oocytes were observed in one of four ovaries in the 85% surge group. These data demonstrate that only a small percentage of the gonadotropin surge is required to induce a maximal P secretion and oocyte maturation. Because neither P secretion nor oocyte maturation is enhanced with increasing gonadotropin levels, these two follicular responses must be mediated through a threshold-dependent mechanism such that once the threshold level is obtained, a maximum response is induced. Greater than 85% of the surge appears to be required to induce follicular rupture, suggesting that the threshold for the follicular rupture is greater than that for either P secretion or oocyte maturation.\r"

We would recommend that ET be undertaken as soon as possible after insemination on day 1 so that if suboptimal culture conditions are present, they do not have sufficient time to affect the viability of the embryos and reduce the subsequent chance of pregnancy after replacement. If culture conditions have been optimized there is no difference in pregnancy rate after embryo transfer on day 1 or day 2 and one can then replace embryos on either day and expect the pregnancy rate obtained in either case to be similar.\r"

Women discontinuing OCs with higher doses of estrogen (greater than or equal to 50 micrograms) had greater conception delays than those on lower estrogen doses who, in turn, had longer delays than other method users. Oral contraceptive use was associated with significant reductions in conception for each of the first six cycles after discontinuation. This study provides further evidence for a direct effect of oral contraception on delayed conception, suggests that the delay lasts longer than previously thought, and finds that the probability of conception after OC discontinuation depends on the estrogen dose of the OC.\r"

Triglycerides (total and lipoprotein fractions) increased during treatment and fell to baseline levels within one posttreatment cycle. Very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol was also elevated during the study.

Seven patients ovulated (50.0%), including 3 that had responded to bromocriptine alone. Ovulation occurred once or twice in 6 of the 9 cases of secondary amenorrhea (66.6%). In several occasions, when ovulation induction failed, luteinized unruptured follicles were found under ultrasonographic monitoring. Four patients who had a negative response to progestin challenge did not ovulate with the treatment.

  ".W": "A series of 201 cycles of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in 154 women were reviewed. Pregnancy occurred in 75 of 201 cycles. Twelve pregnant women (16%) presented with torsion of hyperstimulated ovary, but only 3 out of 126 patients (2.3%) who did not conceive had torsion. Because diagnosis of adnexal torsion is usually uncertain and surgical intervention is likely to be delayed, these infertile women risk losing their ovaries. The clinical picture of torsion of adnexa in patients with OHSS is presented here. The combination of ovarian enlargement, abdominal pain, nausea, progressive leukocytosis, and anemias might indicate torsion of adnexa. Although during operation the adnexa appears dark, hemorrhagic and ischemic, we suggest that it can be saved by simply unwinding it. In 11 such cases intraoperative unwinding of the adnexa was performed, and in 8 patients it was the only operative procedure. No postoperative complications were noted and in all the cases the ovaries were proven functional by ultrasonography. We concluded that torsion of hyperstimulated adnexa in patients who conceived after gonadotropin therapy, is a special entity that requires more attention to achieve early diagnosis. Nevertheless even with delayed diagnosis, the ovary can still be saved.\r"

The following factors were associated with a higher success rate: women less than 36 years, azoospermic compared with oligozoospermic husband and women with no history of abdominal surgery. The success rate decreased with increasing duration of infertility and in women with an abnormal hysterosalpingography or laparoscopy, and was unrelated to menarcheal age, the distance between the couples place of residence and the clinic, or if the woman had been pregnant before starting AID treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes from 7 patients with adenocarcinoma of the colon were evaluated for expansion and antitumor activities during culture in the presence of 1000 U/ml of recombinant human interleukin 2. Functional and phenotypic characteristics of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes were compared between weeks 2 and 3 of culture in recombinant interleukin 2. All but one tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte and all autologous peripheral blood lymphocyte preparations proliferated well in vitro. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes expanded better (p less than 0.05) than autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes, reaching median-fold expansions of 2231 (range 1-4720) and 108 (range 13-1263), respectively. Cytotoxicity of interleukin 2-activated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes against fresh autologous or allogeneic colon carcinoma targets was relatively low in these cultures. Due to better proliferation, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes showed significantly greater (p less than 0.05) total cytotoxic activity per culture against fresh autologous tumor-cell targets than did autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes, achieving a median total lytic units of activity per culture of 671 compared with 92 for autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes. Cytotoxicity was not restricted to autologous tumor cells. Two-color flow cytometry demonstrated that the predominant proliferating cell population in interleukin 2-expanded long-term cultures of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes expressed the CD3+Leu19- phenotype. Some cultures were enriched in CD3+ Leu19+ and CD3-Leu19+ cells. This study indicated that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes from most but not all human primary colon adenocarcinomas could be expanded in the presence of recombinant interleukin 2 and mediate non-major histocompatibility complex-restricted antitumor cytotoxicity. Because fresh colon carcinoma cells appear to be resistant to in vitro lysis by interleukin 2-activated tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte and autologous peripheral blood lymphocyte effectors, the role of adoptive immuno-therapy in treatment of advanced colon carcinomas in humans may have to be reevaluated.\r"

We investigated their potential role in a rat model of chronic granulomatous colonic inflammation induced by trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid. Luminal eicosanoid release was quantified in vivo using a dialysis bag placed into the distal colon. We tested the effect of drugs known to modify inflammatory activity or arachidonic acid metabolism. Three days after intracolonic injection of trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid at different dose levels, the dialysates showed a highly significant increase of prostaglandin E2, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, thromboxane B2 (TXB2), and leukotriene B4, compared with levels in controls not subjected to the toxic agent. Remarkably, the release of TXB2 continued to increase during the stage of chronic inflammation (up to day 21), whereas the levels of the remainder eicosanoids declined. Treatment with prednisone or 5-aminosalicylic acid reduced TXB2 levels in the chronic stage of the inflammatory disease and improved the morphological damage as assessed macroscopically and histologically. Moreover, two selective thromboxane synthetase inhibitors, OKY 1581 and R70416, significantly reduced the development of chronic inflammatory lesions in the colon while inhibiting the release of TXB2. Our results indicate that (1) luminal release of thromboxane increases in the chronic stage of colonic inflammation, (2) anti-inflammatory treatment reduces tissue damage and thromboxane release, and (3) selective thromboxane synthetase inhibition improves the course of the disease in our experimental model.\r"

  ".W": "The relative roles of prostaglandins and mucosal injury in aspirin-induced changes in gastric function were evaluated. Conscious rhesus monkeys received a subcutaneous injection of sodium bicarbonate or aspirin (25, 50, 100, or 150 mg/kg) and sodium bicarbonate or 150 mg/kg aspirin subcutaneously plus oral sucralfate (25 mg/kg twice a day). Gastric emptying and fluid and H+ outputs were determined during a fasting period and after an 80-ml water load using a 99mTc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid dilution technique. At the end of each study, the monkeys were gastroscoped to assess mucosal damage, which was ranked blindly on a scale of 0 to 5. Biopsy samples were taken from antrum and fundus for determination of prostaglandins and histological evaluation. All doses of aspirin significantly suppressed prostaglandins in both the antrum and fundus. In contrast, the aspirin-induced increase in gastric mucosal injury was dose dependent. Aspirin also produced a dose-dependent decrease in gastric emptying that was significantly correlated with erosions scores. When aspirin-induced lesions were prevented by sucralfate, the inhibition of gastric emptying was blocked during the fasting period and was attenuated following the water load. Acid secretion was also decreased significantly by aspirin. This action was not modified by sucralfate protection, suggesting that aspirin has a direct inhibitory effect on parietal cell secretion. These data show that mucosal damage contributes significantly to the aspirin-induced changes in gastric function. Moreover, prostaglandins may play a role in the control of gastric emptying, especially during early phase of the response to a water load.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this prospective study was to test the hypothesis that 6 reportedly important psychosocial factors were useful criteria for diagnosing the irritable bowel syndrome. Ninety-seven new patients with entry complaints of abdominal pain, altered bowel habits, or both underwent full evaluation by board-certified or -eligible gastroenterologists in an outpatient setting. The independent measures were 6 questionnaires concerning anxiety, depression, stress, lack of social support, somatization, and abnormal illness behavior. The dependent measure, irritable bowel syndrome, was defined as the absence of an organic disease explanation for patients' entry complaints. Two other board-certified gastroenterologists, independent of the study, made this determination. Their rating was based on full review of transcripts of patients' clinic visits, laboratory data, and the results of a 9-mo telephone follow-up to patients and their physicians. Sixty-five percent of the sample had no organic disease explanation for the entry symptoms, thereby representing irritable bowel syndrome. The psychosocial predictors did not show a significant association with irritable bowel syndrome; the power of the study was 0.86. Post hoc analysis revealed that patients with organic disease, as well as patients with irritable bowel syndrome, had significantly more (p less than 0.01) psychosocial abnormality than normal subjects, which likely contributed to the inability of the psychosocial predictors to distinguish irritable bowel syndrome from organic disease. It was concluded that psychosocial criteria were of limited value in differentiating irritable bowel syndrome from organic disease but that they were determinants of health care seeking for the entire study group.\r"

Seventy-seven patients thought to have bacterial overgrowth, defined as a jejunal culture yielding at least 10(6) organisms per milliliter of aspirate, took part in the study. Bacterial overgrowth was found in 74% of the patients with predisposing conditions and in 32% of those with no clear causes of bacterial colonization. The intestinal juice of some patients was taken at two different levels of the proximal jejunum, using both the closed- and open-tube systems. Highly significant correlations (rs = 0.90, p less than 0.001) were found between the numbers of bacteria per milliliter at the 2 jejunal levels and between the numbers of bacteria per milliliter of jejunal aspirate obtained from the closed and open tubes (rs = 0.84, p less than 0.001). Compared with the jejunal culture, the gas chromatography of volatile fatty acids in jejunal aspirate and the glucose- and lactulose-hydrogen breath tests showed sensitivities of 56%, 62%, and 68% and specificities of 100%, 83%, and 44%, respectively. This work demonstrates the reliability of jejunal cultures and the inadequacy of breath hydrogen testing in the prediction of positive jejunal cultures. When results of testing for volatile fatty acids in jejunal aspirates are positive, this always indicates the presence of bacterial overgrowth; thus, this procedure would avoid the more complicated, time-consuming, and costly bacteriological analysis of jejunal samples.\r"

We have evaluated simultaneous small bowel and gastric biopsies from 22 patients with diarrhea or malabsorption, all of which showed small bowel changes characteristic of sprue or spruelike disease. In 10 of 22 patients, striking lymphocytic gastritis was identified. Cases positive for lymphocytic gastritis had a mean of 46.5 lymphocytes per 100 epithelial cells, compared with a mean of 3.5 in normal gastric controls and 5.1 in abnormal controls, including cases with Campylobacter gastritis. Concurrent small bowel biopsies had a mean of 47.2 lymphocytes per 100 epithelial cells. Cases without lymphocytic gastritis had means of 10.8 and 39.9 lymphocytes per 100 gastric and intestinal epithelial cells, respectively. Campylobacter organisms were identified in only 1 of the 10 patients with lymphocytic gastritis and in 3 of the 12 patients without lymphocytic gastritis. Intraepithelial lymphocytes in small bowel and stomach were positive for the antibody MT-1, indicating a T-cell infiltrate at both sites. These findings suggest that lymphocytic gastritis may occur as a manifestation of celiac sprue or spruelike disease and that the lymphocytic infiltration of celiac sprue may affect gastric epithelial mucous cells.\r"

In this study, the effect of basement membrane components on intestinal epithelial cell maturation in a mesenchyme-free environment was investigated. Fetal rat small intestinal epithelial cells (from the 14th-17th day of gestation) were exposed to basement membrane-derived proteins (laminin, collagen type IV, and a complex basement membrane-enriched extract from the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm sarcoma) and other extracellular matrix proteins (collagen type I and fibronectin) coated onto Petri dishes. The cells attached readily only to fibronectin and basement membrane proteins. For 5 days the developing epithelial colonies were monitored in vitro, assessing morphological and functional parameters of cell maturation. Colonies grown on laminin and the basement membrane extract were larger and of greater cell density. An increase in alkaline phosphatase and lactase activity was observed after 3-4 days in these colonies which could be enhanced to yield 90%-100% positive cells by the addition of dexamethasone to the medium while no sucrase-isomaltase activity was elicited. Electron microscopy confirmed a high degree of cellular polarization illustrated by tight junctions and apical microvilli in epithelial cells grown on a basement membrane-like support. In contrast, none of the other proteins stimulated the cells to mature in vitro. The authors conclude that certain basement membrane components actively promote fetal intestinal epithelial cell differentiation.\r"

Factor analysis of 23 bowel symptoms identified 4 factors (clusters of symptoms that were correlated with each other) in both samples. The factor accounting for the most variance in both samples included relief of pain with defecation, looser stools with pain onset, more frequent stools with pain, and gastrointestinal reactions to eating. This irritable bowel factor was not correlated with an objective measure of lactose intolerance. An independent constipation factor was found in both samples to include self-reported constipation, straining with bowel movements, feeling of incomplete evacuation, and rectal bleeding. Thus factor analysis of bowel symptoms supports the existence of a specific irritable bowel syndrome and suggests symptoms that may be used to diagnose this syndrome.\r"

In this study we determined the frequency of reflux esophagitis in 122 patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and examined their response to medical therapy. Esophageal symptoms, endoscopic abnormalities, or both were present in 61% of patients. Forty-five percent of patients had esophageal symptoms consisting of heartburn, dysphagia, or both. Forty-three percent of patients had endoscopic abnormalities of the esophagus, and 23% demonstrated moderate or severe disease. When sufficient antisecretory medication was administered to lower gastric acid secretion to less than 10 mEq/h in the last hour before the next dose of drug, 67% of the patients with reflux esophagitis responded with complete disappearance of symptoms and normalization of the endoscopic abnormalities. The other 33% of patients required an increase in medication to lower acid output to less than 5 mEq/h in 7% and less than 1 mEq/h in the other 26% to resolve symptoms and signs completely. We conclude that reflux esophagitis occurs in the majority of patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and responds well to medical therapy, although one third of patients require intensive antisecretory medication.\r"

Five animals underwent implantation of the duodenal papilla into the jejunum. Myoelectric recording was obtained from the sphincter, duodenum, and jejunum in these animals and from 5 other animals as controls. The mean spike frequency of the sphincter of controls was 1.6 per min during phase I, 4.2 per min during phase II, 11.0 per min during phase III, and 3.6 per min during phase IV of the duodenal migrating myoelectric complex. After translocation of the papilla, the spike rates during phase II (2.2 per min) and phase III (2.8 per min) were lower than in controls (p less than 0.02), while those during phases I and IV remained unchanged. Feeding disrupted the migrating myoelectric complex and increased sphincter spike activity in both groups; however, the plateau frequency after feeding was lower after the translocation. These data suggest that the duodenum does not control cyclicity of sphincter motility but sphincter-duodenal intrinsic myoneural continuity is important in the increase in sphincter spike activity during phases II and III and after feeding.\r"

Acetate (C2) is nontoxic in contrast to C(3)4-C5 fatty acids (propionate, butyrate, isobutyrate, valerate, and isovalerate), which induce coma in animals and may be important in the pathogenesis of hepatic coma in humans. An in-vitro fecal incubation system was used to map out short-chain fatty acid production in the presence of lactulose, amino acids, albumin, or blood. Albumin and blood increased production of all C2-C5 fatty acids. In contrast, lactulose was converted to acetate only and increased fecal acidity. The degradation of amino acids, albumin, and blood to short-chain fatty acids was completely inhibited by 10-25 mM lactulose. This was caused mainly by the acidifying effect of lactulose. pH-independent inhibition of blood and amino acid degradation to short-chain fatty acids required concentrations of lactulose exceeding 50-100 mM. Thus, the effect of lactulose in the treatment of hepatic coma may be related to its rapid fermentation into organic acids at rates exceeding colonic buffering capacity. This probably reduces formation of toxic fatty acids and ammonia from amino acids, polypeptides, and blood in the colon.\r"

Incubating the luminal surface of gastric mucosa mounted in Ussing chambers in acidified aspirin promoted the exfoliation of surface epithelium and markedly reduced surface hydrophobicity, surface periodic acid-Schiff reactivity, and transmucosal potential difference. Addition of 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 to the nutrient compartment of these chambers maintained surface hydrophobicity at control levels but did not prevent aspirin-induced reductions in potential difference or cellular damage to the surface epithelium. However, prostaglandin did attenuate exfoliation of aspirin-damaged surface mucous cells and preserved the surface mucous gel. These results indicate that the stomach's hydrophobic lining is closely associated with the presence of a surface mucous gel layer, is not an effective barrier to the penetration of lipid-soluble damaging agents such as acidified aspirin, and is maintained by exogenous prostaglandin as is the mucous gel layer, even in the presence of luminal aspirin. The ability of prostaglandin to maintain a hydrophobic mucous gel layer over compromised tissue may, in part, explain its ability to limit aspirin-induced injury and promote the recovery and restitution of the surface epithelium.\r"

In the present study, the epidemiology of hemorrhoids was evaluated and compared with the epidemiology of constipation. The analysis was based on 4 data sources: from the United States, the National Health Interview Survey, the National Hospital Discharge Survey, and the National Disease and Therapeutic Index; from England and Wales, the Morbidity Statistics from General Practice. Results showed that 10 million people in the United States complained of hemorrhoids, corresponding to a prevalence rate of 4.4%. In both sexes, a peak in prevalence was noted from age 45-65 yr, with a subsequent decrease after age 65 yr. The development of hemorrhoids before age 20 yr was unusual. Whites were affected more frequently than blacks, and increased prevalence rates were associated with higher socioeconomic status. This was in contrast to the epidemiology of constipation, which demonstrated an exponential increase in prevalence after age 65 yr and was more common in blacks and in families with low incomes or low social status. The data presented illustrate differences in the epidemiologic behavior of hemorrhoids and constipation, calling the presumption of causality between constipation and hemorrhoids into question.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have reported that small and large intestinal crypt hyperplasia and hyperproliferation occur in senescent rats about 27 mo of age. We have studied duodenal and ileal architecture in ad libitum chow-fed rats and have demonstrated that the increase in duodenal crypt depth and crypt hyperplasia do not develop throughout the life span, but become apparent at 21 and 27 mo of age. These crypt hyperplastic features occur without a change in duodenal villus cell number. Ileal villus cellularity increased throughout the life span, suggesting exposure to a gradually increasing luminal nutrient load. Diet restriction to 60% of the ad libitum feeding rate prolonged the life span of animals from 27 to greater than 33 mo and prevented both the duodenal hyperplasia and the increase in ileal villus cell numbers to the age of 27 mo. Thirty-three-month diet-restricted rats did show evidence of duodenal crypt hyperplasia. We conclude that proximal intestinal hyperplasia is a phenomenon that develops in advanced age, but that ileal villus cellularity increases throughout the ad libitum-fed rodent life span. Diet restriction dramatically retards these intestinal changes that are seen with ad libitum feeding and provides an experimental model for the study of age-related cellular changes of the rodent gastrointestinal tract.\r"

With the gallbladder in situ, these patients are at risk of stone recurrence. Therefore, the early rate of stone recurrence after successful lithotripsy was evaluated. Fifty-eight of the first 60 consecutive patients who became stone free underwent follow-up examinations at least 1 yr (range, 12-37 mo; mean +/- SD, 18 +/- 6) after discontinuation of adjuvant bile-acid therapy. Five patients reported recurrent biliary pain within 1 yr after lithotripsy, and recurrent gallstones were detected. Fifty-three patients were asymptomatic during the first yr, and no recurrence was detected. Thus, the rate of gallstone recurrence was 9% within 1 yr. The rate of gallstone recurrence up to 3 yr was estimated by actuarial analysis. The probability of stone recurrence was 11% (+/- 4%) at 1.5 yr, and no further increase was observed up to 3 yr. Gallstone recurrence within 1 yr after successful shock-wave therapy has to be expected in approximately the same percentage of patients as has been reported in earlier postdissolution trials. It causes recurrent biliary pain in most cases.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of the present study is to examine the efficacy of 6-hydroxy substituted bile acids on the prevention of cholesterol gallstones in a new hamster model of cholesterol cholelithiasis. Male golden Syrian hamsters were fed a nutritionally adequate semipurified lithogenic diet consisting of casein, cornstarch, soluble starch, butterfat, corn oil, and cellulose plus 0.3% cholesterol. Six different bile acids were added to this diet at the 0.05% level: chenodeoxycholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid, hyodeoxycholic acid, murideoxycholic acid, 6 beta-methyl-hyodeoxycholic acid, and 6 alpha-methyl-murideoxycholic acid. At the end of the 6-wk feeding period, the control group receiving the lithogenic diet had a 55% incidence of gallstones. It was found that all bile acids had inhibited the formation of cholesterol gallstones; complete prevention of gallstones was observed with all 4 3,6-dihydroxy bile acids, whereas chenodeoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid were somewhat less effective (80% and 75% prevention, respectively). The accumulation of cholesterol in serum and liver induced by the lithogenic diet was inhibited to some extent by all of the bile acids; hyodeoxycholic acid, murideoxycholic acid, and 6 beta-methyl hyodeoxycholic acid were most effective in this respect. The administered bile acids tended to predominate in bile in the case of chenodeoxycholic acid, hyodeoxycholic acid, and 6 beta-methyl-hyodeoxycholic acid. In contrast, ursodeoxycholic acid seemed to be converted to chenodeoxycholic acid and murideoxycholic acid to hyodeoxycholic acid. Only 4% of the 6-methyl analogue of murideoxycholic acid, 6 alpha-methyl-murideoxycholic acid, was recovered in gallbladder bile. These experiments show that the new hamster model of cholesterol cholelithiasis is suitable for gallstone-prevention studies. It was not possible to draw definite conclusions concerning the mechanism of action of the administered bile acids on the basis of cholesterol saturation or the presence of liquid crystals. The detailed mechanism of gallstone prevention by hydrophilic bile acids in this model remains to be elucidated.\r"

  ".U": "90108556\r", 
  ".W": "Prospective epidemiologic studies have reported an increased risk of rectal cancer following chronic ethanol ingestion. The effect of ethanol on chemically induced colorectal carcinogenesis is controversial depending on the experimental conditions. In the present study the effect of chronic ethanol administration on acetoxymethylmethylnitrosamine-induced rectal cancer and the possible role of acetaldehyde in this process were investigated. Chronic ethanol administration resulted in an earlier occurrence of rectal tumors in this animal model. Because the concomitant administration of cyanamide, a potent acetaldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor, showed a positive trend toward increased incidences of tumors, acetaldehyde could be involved in the ethanol-associated carcinogenesis. To measure colonic acetaldehyde, 12 chronically ethanol-fed and control rats received an acute dose of ethanol (2.5 g/kg body wt). The mucosal concentration of acetaldehyde was significantly higher in the rectum compared with the cecum (198 +/- 23 vs. 120 +/- 23 nmoles.g colon-1, p less than 0.05), but was not affected by chronic ethanol feeding. Furthermore, 6 germ-free rats had significantly lower acetaldehyde concentrations in the rectum (84 +/- 11 vs. 234 +/- 33 nmoles.g colon-1, p less than 0.01) and in the cecum (59 +/- 13 vs. 121 +/- 33 nmoles.g colon-1, p less than 0.05) compared with 6 conventional animals, and this was paralleled by the number of fecal bacteria in the 2 intestinal segments. In addition, to determine the effect of chronic ethanol feeding on colorectal cell turnover, 30 animals were pair-fed liquid diets. Using the metaphase-arrest technique, alcohol feeding induced rectal (19.1 +/- 2.0 vs. 9.1 +/- 1.8 cells.crypt-1.h-1, p less than 0.01), but not cecal (18.9 +/- 1.3 vs. 22.2 +/- 3.3 cells.crypt-1.h-1, p greater than 0.05) hyperregeneration. This was accompanied by an increase in the crypt proliferative compartment and increased mucosal ornithine decarboxylase activity (63 +/- 18 vs. 22 +/- 6 pmoles.hr-1.mg protein-1, p less than 0.05). The data show that chronic ethanol ingestion accelerates chemically induced rectal carcinogenesis and raise the possibility that acetaldehyde probably generated through bacterial ethanol oxidation may be involved in this process. The secondary hyperregeneration of the mucosa, observed after alcohol feeding, could by itself favour carcinogenesis.\r"

Using jejunal self-filling blind loops to create small bowel bacterial overgrowth, we compared biochemical and histological evidence of hepatic inflammation in 3 rat strains chosen for their variable inflammatory responses to bacterial cell wall polymers. Lewis and Wistar rats developed weight loss, hepatomegaly, and hepatic inflammation 4 and 12 wk, respectively, after creation of SFBL. Plasma aspartate aminotransferase levels in Lewis rats 4 wk (578 +/- 77 U/L) and Wistar rats 12 wk (220 +/- 35 U/L) after self-filling blind loops were significantly greater than in rats with self-emptying blind loops (112 +/- 24 U/L, p less than 0.001; 104 +/- 22, p less than 0.05) or sham-operated Lewis (84 +/- 24, p less than 0.001) or Wistar (78 +/- 10, p less than 0.001) rats. Randomized comparison using a histology grading score showed abnormalities that paralleled aminotransferase values. Lewis and Wistar rats with self-filling blind loops had hepatic injury with bile duct proliferation, fibrosis and acute and chronic periportal and focal parenchymal inflammation. Lewis and Wistar rats with self-emptying blind loops developed occasional mild histologic lesions. 50% of Lewis rats with self-filling blind loops for 4 wk died compared with only 15% in other groups. However, Buffalo rats with self-filling blind loops developed no weight loss, hepatomegaly, or hepatic injury. Anaerobic cultures of blood, peritoneum and liver were negative in all strains. Diet-restricted, sham-operated Wistar rats with weights similar to the Wistar rats with self-filling blind loops did not develop histologic abnormalities or elevated aminotransferase levels (76 +/- 31 U/L). These results show that experimental small bowel bacterial overgrowth causes significant hepatic inflammation leading to fibrosis in susceptible rat strains. Caloric deprivation and hepatic bacterial invasion are not etiologically responsible. We suggest that bacterial cell wall polymers or other bacterial toxins from the blind loop cause hepatic lesions in genetically susceptible hosts.\r"

In the control period, the eight patients excreted 327 +/- 91 (mean +/- standard error of the mean) mumol/8 h cholic acid and 214 +/- 38 mumol/8 h chenodeoxycholic acid by their ileal fluid. Following ursodeoxycholic acid administration (500 mg), ileal excretion of cholic acid increased to 517 +/- 96 mumol/8 h, and that of chenodeoxycholic acid increased to 337 +/- 42 mumol/8 h, indicating decreased absorption of these bile acids. Following chenodeoxycholic acid administration (500 mg), no significant increase of cholic acid excretion was observed, whereas chenodeoxycholic acid excretion increased as expected. It is concluded that following ursodeoxycholic acid administration the absorption of common bile acids from the small intestine decreases markedly. This effect of ursodeoxycholic acid on intestinal absorption of common bile acids probably is responsible for the decrease of their plasma concentrations, the reduction of their pool sizes, the increase of their fractional turnover rates, and most likely also contributes to the increased hepatic synthesis of cholic acid.\r"

Previous studies indicate that ethanol added in vitro inhibits amino acid uptake by cultured hepatocytes and liver plasma membrane vesicles; however, the effect of chronic ethanol consumption on amino acid uptake by the liver remains unknown. Therefore, the present studies were performed to determine if chronic ethanol consumption impairs alanine uptake by rat basolateral liver plasma membrane vesicles. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were pair-fed for 6 weeks a diet containing 36% of calories as ethanol or a control diet in which ethanol was isocalorically replaced with carbohydrate. Chronic ethanol consumption reduced basolateral liver plasma membrane sodium-dependent alanine transport activity by 36.3% +/- 15.9% (p less than 0.01). This reduction was caused primarily by impaired activity of amino acid transport system A. The response of system A to glucagon was reduced in the ethanol-fed rats, suggesting that impaired hormonal regulation is at least partially responsible for the lower system-A activity. Kinetic analysis shows that ethanol consumption reduces the Vmax of sodium-dependent alanine transport without affecting the Km. These studies indicate that chronic ethanol consumption reduces alanine uptake by the rat liver. They further show that the reduced uptake is at least partially caused by an intrinsic defect in membrane-transport processes rather than another regulatory mechanism.\r"

Diversion of bile and pancreatic juice to the exterior for 4 h significantly increased pancreatic protein and fluid secretion. Atropine delayed the pancreatic response to diversion, but during 4 h of diversion, neither total nor incremental pancreatic protein or fluid secretion was inhibited by atropine. Plasma cholecystokinin levels were elevated after diverting bile and pancreatic juice and were not significantly reduced by atropine (23.0 +/- 6.6 pM vs. 16.0 +/- 3.9 pM at 1.5 h and 17.3 +/- 5.4 pM vs. 13.1 +/- 2.9 pM at 4 h after bile and pancreatic juice diversion; atropine-treated vs. controls, respectively). These results indicate that cholinergic nerves play no important role in feedback regulation of cholecystokinin release and that the previously reported suppressive effect of atropine on the pancreatic response to diversion of bile and pancreatic juice from the intestine was secondary to inhibition of gastric secretion.\r"

  ".W": "During studies on the effect of bile salt-pool depletion in the bile-fistula rat (adult male Sprague-Dawley), the spontaneous formation of an orange-brown precipitate was noted. The nature of this phenomenon and its relationship to BS and calcium concentration was investigated in depth. Bile from 18 animals was collected in the dark into transparent tubes containing sodium azide, ascorbic acid, and glucaro-1,4-lactone. The tubes were flushed with nitrogen, sealed, and incubated at 37 degrees C. The pigmentary precipitate formed in all the bile salt-depleted (less than 3-5 mM) bile samples (i.e., those collected after 5-7 h of external biliary drainage), but not in bile salt-rich biles. It appeared within 30-240 min after collection, both in bile samples collected at room temperature and at 37 degrees C, initially as a pale flocculation and then slowly sedimenting to form, after centrifugation, a solid, dark-orange pellet. There were no pH changes during incubation, and bile cultures were negative. Under polarizing microscopy, the precipitate appeared amorphous, and there was no evidence of birefringence. High-performance liquid chromatography showed that unconjugated bilirubin was the prevalent pigmentary component, but significant amounts of monoconjugated bilirubin also coprecipitated. Lipid chemistry showed the presence of lecithin (80.1% of total lipids), which was rich in palmitoyl and linoleoyl fatty acids, and of fatty acids (predominantly palmitic and oleic). Infrared spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction showed the presence of calcium bilirubinate and palmitate. In-vivo replenishment of the bile salt pool by intravenous infusion of either taurocholate or taurochenodeoxycholate (1 mumol/min) completely prevented the pigmentary precipitation. In vitro experiments showed inhibition of the precipitate formation by the addition of individual bile salt in concentrations approximating their critical micellar concentration. Precipitate formation was hastened by the addition of calcium chloride (4-12 mM), but only in bile salt-depleted biles. As the composition of the precipitate closely resembles that of human brown-pigment stones and sludge, these findings may provide new insights into an understanding of the pathogenesis of pigment gallstone disease.\r"

The goal of this study was to determine if the mucolytic agent N-acetylcysteine could accelerate gallstone dissolution in vitro. Paired gallstones were dissolved in either pure taurocholate (140 mM) or ursodeoxycholate (100 mM), or in bovine bile supplemented with either taurocholate or ursodeoxycholate to achieve the same respective bile-salt concentrations. N-acetylcysteine was added to 1 stone from each pair at a concentration of 500 mM in pure bile salts and 100 mM in supplemented bile. Gallstones dissolved significantly faster in bovine bile supplemented with taurocholate or ursodeoxycholate than in pure solutions of the respective bile salts (n = 30, p less than 0.001). N-acetylcysteine significantly accelerated gallstone dissolution in pure solutions of bile acids (n = 30, p less than 0.001 for each) and in supplemented bovine biles (n = 30, p less than 0.001). N-acetylcysteine also significantly increased the frequency of complete gallstone dissolution in taurocholate-supplemented (66.6% vs. 40.0%) and ursodeoxycholate-supplemented (76.6% vs. 50.0%) bile. These results indicate that the mucolytic agent N-acetylcysteine significantly accelerates in vitro gallstone dissolution. We speculate that adjuvant therapy with an appropriate mucolytic agent may potentially increase the efficacy of clinical gallstone dissolution.\r"

  ".W": "The increased susceptibility to infections after surgery in jaundiced patients is considered to be caused by an impairment of cellular immunity and/or nutritional status. Endotoxins are suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis. However, the mechanism of action is unknown. Germ-free rats were used to study the effect of biliary obstruction in a model with negligible amounts of endotoxin. Cellular immunity, production of tumor necrosis factor (as a mediator of endotoxin toxicity) by peritoneal macrophages, and the nutritional status were assessed. Significant suppression of cellular immunity was found in conventional rats with obstructive jaundice. In contrast, cellular immunity was not suppressed in jaundiced germ-free rats. Large amounts of tumor necrosis factor were spontaneously secreted by peritoneal macrophages of jaundiced conventional rats, whereas macrophages from jaundiced germ-free rats did not. Moreover macrophage activation (expressed in tumor necrosis factor production) was significantly related to suppression of cellular immunity. Weight changes and depression of albumin levels were not different in germ-free and conventional rats after bile duct ligation. The data presented indicate that suppression of cellular immunity in obstructive jaundice is caused by endotoxins, whereas the impaired nutritional status seems to not be affected by the presence of endotoxins.\r"

A 38-yr-old homosexual man with antibody to human immunodeficiency virus and Cryptosporidium-related diarrhea is described. The patient excreted 6-12 L of stool per day for at least 3 mo, 2 of them spent in the hospital. Trials with more than 6 antidiarrheal medications were ineffective. The patient received bovine colostrum hyperimmune to Cryptosporidium by direct duodenal infusion. During infusion, the patient's fecal output decreased to less than 2 L per day, and 48 h after treatment, stools were formed and oocysts to Cryptosporidium were absent. The patient remained asymptomatic for 3 mo. Hyperimmune bovine colostrum offers an exciting new therapy for cryptosporidiosis; controlled trials to establish efficacy should be undertaken and the active factor(s) characterized.\r"

Although the course of necrotizing esophagitis may parallel that associated with ischemia, severe caustic injury, or overwhelming infection, its etiology is uncertain. Diminished mucosal defenses, microbial implantation by a nasogastric tube placed perioperatively or sepsis, and transient ischemia with oxyradical formation and resultant reperfusion injury are hypothesized as important causative factors in the pathogenesis of acute necrotizing esophagitis.\r"

The patient who died had necrosis of almost all hepatocytes as found at biopsy and autopsy. Biopsy was performed on another patient after resolution of the illness, and showed hyperplastic endoplastic reticulum but no necrosis. All patients had mild large- and small-droplet steatosis in surviving hepatocytes. Inflammation was mild. Drug screenings performed on all patients showed the presence of a cocaine metabolite and the absence of acetaminophen, alcohol, and other potential toxins. Patients typically had early marked increase and rapid decrease of serum aminotransferases, mild-to-moderate increase in prothrombin time, myoglobinuria, and moderate azotemia. The predominant pattern of zone-3 necrosis is similar to that reported of mice given cocaine.\r"

There is evidence that vasoactive intestinal peptide mediates diarrhea, but recent evidence suggested that peptide histidine methionine and peptide histidine valine may be at least as important. Infusion of vasoactive intestinal peptide, peptide histidine methionine, and peptide histidine valine into patients with ileostomies produced mean plateau plasma levels of 163, 1301, and 2106 pM, respectively, which are within the range seen in the Verner Morrison syndrome. Vasoactive intestinal peptide produced an integrated ileal output of 174 (53) g (mean [SEM]), compared with only 20 (7) g with peptide histidine methionine and 10 (3) g with peptide histidine valine. These results suggest that vasoactive intestinal peptide is substantially more important than peptide histidine methionine or peptide histidine valine in mediating diarrhea in the Verner Morrison syndrome.\r"

This substitution converts codon 2153 from glutamine (CAA) in apo-B100 mRNA to a stop codon (UAA) in apo-B48 mRNA. This novel RNA editing process is responsible for the generation of hepatic apo-B100 and intestinal apo-B48. We have established the following concerning this process: (1) by transfection of a series of deletion mutants into the rat hepatoma cell line McArdle 7777, which makes both apo-B100 and apo-B48, we have defined a minimum sequence of 26 nucleotides that is required for apo-B mRNA editing. The sequence containing the modified nucleotide forms a 26 nucleotide highly conserved stem loop with the modified nucleotide occurring in an 8-base loop. (2) Conversion in vitro of apo-B mRNA has been established, using cell free S100 cytoplasmic extract and synthetic RNA templates. Activity was abolished by protease treatment. (3) Transgenic mice were created which expressed a human apo-B construct spanning the stop codon. Apo-B mRNA was found in all tissues examined and this was shown to undergo editing. (4) In the rat liver, which produces apo B-100 and apo-B48, modulation of the relative proportion of these proteins by thyroxine was demonstrated to be mediated at the level of the RNA editing mechanism. It is concluded that apo-B mRNA is edited by a generally expressed protein and editing is highly regulated.\r"

Pigment stone patients never had cholesterol crystals in their fresh biles, and nucleation time was always longer than 20 days. Of the cholesterol stone patients 79% had cholesterol crystals in their fresh biles. Long nucleation times were generally found in cholesterol stone patients with dilute biles despite a high cholesterol saturation index. Nucleation time was usually short if bile was well concentrated despite a relatively low saturation index. Serial in vitro dilution of concentrated biles from cholesterol gallstone patients resulted in progressively prolonged nucleation times. Patients with solitary cholesterol stones had longer nucleation times than patients with multiple cholesterol stones. This study indicates that bile concentration is an important factor for nucleation time and cholesterol saturation index. Moreover, solitary and multiple cholesterol stones may have a different pathogenesis.\r"

A possible explanation for this discrepancy is the presence in plasma of a substance that can inhibit [3H]-GABA binding but is not GABA itself. The aim of this study was to determine whether any of the amino acids that are increased in the plasma of animal models of acute and chronic hepatic encephalopathy (glutamine, glutamate, phenylalanine, tyrosine, citrulline and taurine) can significantly inhibit [3H]-GABA binding and contribute to the GABA-like activity of plasma aliquots. At final assay concentrations equivalent to plasma concentrations found in hepatic encephalopathy, only taurine was found to significantly inhibit [3H]-GABA binding to whole rat brain synaptosomal membranes (36% inhibition at 30 mumol/L final assay concentration). The concentration of taurine that resulted in 50% inhibition (final assay concentration) was 158 mumol/L, corresponding to a plasma concentration of 1.58 mmol/L. Taurine inhibition of [3H]-GABA binding was competitive because the receptor density was unaltered, but the receptor affinity decreased with increasing concentration of taurine. Plasma GABA-like activity (determined by radioreceptor assay) and plasma GABA and taurine concentrations (determined by high-performance liquid chromatography) were measured in 18 rats with acute or chronic hepatic encephalopathy and 9 control rats. Plasma GABA-like activity and plasma GABA and taurine concentrations were significantly increased in rats with hepatic encephalopathy compared with control rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These cells appear to have features similar to several cell types but when cultured assume a fibroblast-like morphology. In this study we evaluated the phenotype of both freshly isolated and cultured Ito cells by examining their gene expression. To better define the modulators of Ito-cell collagen synthesis, we also examined the effect of transforming growth factor-beta 1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and dexamethasone on collagen synthesis by these cells. Northern hybridization analysis revealed that cultured Ito cells expressed different types of procollagen mRNAs than did freshly isolated cells. Cultured cells contained large amounts of type I procollagen mRNA and lesser amounts of types III and IV, whereas freshly isolated cells contained more type IV procollagen mRNA than types I and III. Treatment of cultured cells with either transforming growth factor-beta 1 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha resulted in a greater than three-fold increase in total collagen content, and the effects of these cytokines on Ito-cell collagen synthesis involved different levels of gene regulation. Transforming growth factor-beta 1-treated cells had an approximately threefold increase in their type I procollagen mRNA levels, whereas no increase in this mRNA level was found in tumor necrosis factor-alpha-treated cells. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 treatment induced a twofold increase in transforming growth factor-beta 1 mRNA content in cultured cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To learn whether the growth hormone receptor is present in human hepatocellular carcinoma, we used radioreceptor assays in samples of human hepatocellular carcinoma. The liver tissues adjacent to hepatocellular carcinoma (mostly cirrhotic) and control liver tissues (taken during various surgical procedures) were also studied. The study results showed that the affinity constant and capacity of high-affinity growth hormone receptor in normal liver tissues were 6.6 +/- 2.0 x 10(10) mol/L-1 (mean +/- SE, n = 7) and 20.7 +/- 11.5 fmol/mg protein, respectively. The affinity constant and capacity of low-affinity growth hormone receptor in normal liver tissues were 8.9 +/- 3.3 x 10(9) mol/L-1 and 64.7 +/- 32.1 fmol/mg protein, respectively. The absence of growth hormone receptor in human hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhotic liver samples may explain the absence of growth hormone in the stimulation of hepatoma growth and the decrease of somatomedin levels in cirrhosis.\r"

This 36 kDa fragment derives from original 70 kDa protein because the monoclonal antibody specific to 70 kDa protein reacts with the 36 kDa band equivalent to 70 kDa band. The 36 kDa fragment was purified using an affinity column conjugated with an immunoglobulin-rich fraction of primary biliary cirrhosis serum containing antimitochondrial antibody, preparative electrophoresis and high-performance liquid chromatography using a reverse phase column. The final preparation showed a single band in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Its amino acid composition is in good agreement with that of the subunit binding domain of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex E2 from bovine heart.\r"

Pre-S1 and pre-S2 antigens were detected in HBsAg-positive sera irrespective of the presence of viral replicative markers, and their titers correlated with those of HBsAg (r = 0.74, p less than 0.01; r = 0.74, p less than 0.01, respectively). Sera positive for HBeAg showed higher titers of pre-S1 (p less than 0.01) and pre-S2 (p less than 0.01) antigens than sera negative for HBeAg. The titers of pre-S1 and pre-S2 antigens also correlated with the levels of HBV-associated DNA polymerase activity (r = 0.51, p less than 0.01; r = 0.59, p less than 0.01, respectively) and HBV-DNA (r = 0.50, p less than 0.01; r = 0.46, p less than 0.01, respectively). However, the ratios between the titers of pre-S antigens and HBsAg had no significant relationships with those viral replicative markers. These findings suggest that the expression of pre-S antigens is intimately related to the expression of HBsAg and that they are not useful as markers of viral replication. The ratios between the titers of pre-S antigens and HBsAg tended to be high in patients with chronic active hepatitis and high aminotransferase levels. This finding may have been due to the hepatic release of pre-S antigens, over-production of which may have some relationship to liver injury.\r"

To assess whether there is more widespread extrahepatic virus replication, we assayed brain, heart, lung, thymus, pancreas, kidney, spleen and intestine of 1- to 16-wk-old ducklings for the presence of duck hepatitis B virus DNA and mRNA by blotting and in situ methods. Replicative intermediates and single-stranded duck hepatitis B virus DNA and RNA transcripts were detected in the brain, lung, heart, intestine, kidney, pancreas and spleen. In situ hybridization showed evidence of viral replication in the lung epithelium, germinal center of spleen, acinar cell of pancreas and tubular epithelium of kidney. These data suggest that extrahepatic duck hepatitis B virus replication is more widespread than previously thought. It is yet to be determined whether widespread extrahepatic replication is unique to duck hepatitis B virus infection or is a common feature of other mammalian hepatitis B-like viruses.\r"

There were 53 proven bacterial infections in 40 patients, whereas in 5 of the remaining 10 patients infection was suspected on clinical grounds in the absence of significant cultures. Seven patients (14%) had more than one bacterial infection, and four patients had simultaneous infections caused by different organisms at each site. Fourteen infections (26.4%) were associated with bacteremia, and in six of these no source was found. Twenty-five infections (47.1%) arose from the respiratory tract, 12 (22.6%) from the urinary tract and 2 (3.7%) from central venous cannulas. Thirty-seven (69.8%) of the 53 infections were due to gram-positive bacteria; Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 19 (35.8%) of all the infections. Thirty patients died (60%), 28 of whom had bacterial infection at some time; in 24 of these the infection was diagnosed less than 24 hr before death. All nine deaths that occurred more than 7 days after admission were directly attributable to microbial infection. Clinical features such as elevated temperature and elevated peripheral white blood cell count were poor indicators of bacterial infection because these were absent in 30.2% of cases. These data show that there is a high incidence of bacterial infection early in the course of acute liver failure and suggest that prophylactic antimicrobial therapy, although unproven, might be justified.\r"

A high blood alcohol level was constantly maintained. The spectra were obtained using a surface coil combined with a ferrite screen to eliminate nuclear magnetic resonance signals derived from the superficial muscles. Contaminating 31P nuclear magnetic resonance signals arising from abdominal tissues other than the liver were eliminated from the spectra by digital subtraction. Throughout the study the inorganic phosphate/beta-ATP peak area ratio observed in alcohol-fed rats was found to be consistently elevated in comparison with the control rats (at 3 to 5 wk alcohol-fed rats = 1.20 +/- 0.10, control rats = 0.78 +/- 0.04, p less than 0.05.; at 22 to 24 wk alcohol-fed rats = 1.23 +/- 0.10, control rats = 0.81 +/- 0.06, p less than 0.05.; mean +/- S.E.). The phosphomonoesters/beta-ATP ratio tended to be higher in alcohol-fed rats when compared with control rats. The intracellular pH measured by the chemical shift of the inorganic phosphate peak showed no significant differences between alcohol-fed rats and control rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Little data exist as to the effect of inflammatory bowel disease on the presenting symptoms, radiological features, response to liver transplantation, and potential risk of bile duct carcinoma in individuals with primary sclerosing cholangitis. In an effort to answer these questions, 66 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis were studied. The definitive diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis in each was accomplished using cholangiography, which in each case demonstrated characteristic beading, ectasia and stricturing of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts. Inflammatory bowel disease was present in 47 (71.2%) patients. Thirty nine (59.1%) had ulcerative colitis; their mean age was 42.5 +/- 11.6 yr (mean +/- SD), and the male/female ratio was 2.9:1. In addition, eight patients (12.1%) had Crohn's colitis; their mean age was 40.5 +/- 6.5 yr, and the male/female ratio of this group was 1:1. Nineteen patients (28.8%) had primary sclerosing cholangitis without any inflammatory bowel disease; their mean age was 42.0 +/- 12.1 yr, and the male/female ratio in this group was 0.72:1. Seventy-two percent of the patients without inflammatory bowel disease had either jaundice, pruritus or fatigue at presentation compared with 41% of the patients with inflammatory bowel disease (p less than 0.05). In contrast, abnormal liver function tests were more common as the first manifestation of liver disease in the latter group (38% vs. 11%; p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90109048\r", 
  ".W": "Forty-two patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis were followed for a median of 4.5 yr (range = 1.5 to 21.5 yr). Except for two patients with lipodystrophy, all were obese; 35 of 42 were women, 26 of 32 were hyperlipidemic and 15 were hyperglycemic. Upper abdominal pain was the most common reason for presentation. Initial liver biopsy specimens showed the presence of macrovesicular fatty infiltration, lobular (acinar) inflammation, apoptosis, Mallory bodies (in four cases) and fibrosis (in 18 cases). Cirrhosis was present at initial diagnosis in one subject and in another two subjects liver biopsy showed marked fibrosis with disturbed architecture. Serial liver biopsy specimens revealed minimal or no apparent progression of the disorder in most of the patients, in keeping with their benign clinical course. However, one patient showed progression from fibrosis to cirrhosis during the 5-yr observation period, and in the patients with extensive fibrosis the liver disease evolved from one of active inflammation to one of inactive cirrhosis without fat or inflammation. The patient with cirrhosis later died of hepatocellular carcinoma. The severity or type of hepatic change did not correlate with the degree of obesity, hyperlipidemia or hyperglycemia. However, in individual patients, poorly controlled diabetes and rapid weight loss preceded the onset of steatohepatitis. We conclude that nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is a cause of hepatic inflammation histologically resembling that of alcohol-induced liver disease but usually slowly progressive and of low-grade severity. However, the disorder may ultimately result in cirrhosis. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis should be distinguished from alcoholic steatohepatitis and recognized as a further cause of \"cryptogenic cirrhosis.\"\r"

Both drugs produced a concentration-dependent increase of lactate dehydrogenase release in the culture medium, which correlated well with cell death as measured by trypan blue exclusion test. Desethylamiodarone was more toxic than amiodarone in the cultured hepatocytes. Incubation with subtoxic concentrations of either amiodarone (7.6 microM) or desethylamiodarone (8 microM) for 24 hr resulted in the development of myelinoid inclusion bodies in the hepatocytes without any excess release of lactate dehydrogenase. In experimental protocols where the hepatocytes were exposed to either amiodarone or desethylamiodarone for up to 96 hr, there was an increase in lactate dehydrogenase and the percent volume-density of multilamellar inclusion bodies with cumulative drug exposure with time. A linear correlation between hepatocyte drug concentration and multilamellar inclusion bodies was found for both amiodarone and desethylamiodarone. These results demonstrate that both amiodarone and its major metabolite, desethylamiodarone, induce lysosomal inclusions, which, under appropriate conditions, can be dissociated from cell death. Withdrawal of the drug after 24 hr exposure did not result in disappearance of the inclusion bodies from the hepatocytes for up to 96 hr of tissue culture. The concentrations at which amiodarone- or desethylamiodarone-induced electron microscopic changes and hepatotoxicity were only two to five times as high as the usual serum drug levels in patients given antiarrhythmic therapy with amiodarone.\r"

Malondialdehyde is formed when polyunsaturated fatty acids of membrane phospholipids undergo peroxidative decomposition, and it is metabolized by aldehyde dehydrogenase. We studied mitochondrial metabolism of malondialdehyde in rats with chronic dietary iron overload. Hepatic malondialdehyde concentrations were significantly increased in iron-loaded livers, and mitochondrial respiratory control ratios using glutamate as a substrate were decreased by 47% largely owing to reductions in state 3 respiration. When exogenous malondialdehyde was added to mitochondrial fractions, there was significantly less metabolism of malondialdehyde in mitochondria of iron-loaded livers as compared with controls. In addition, there was a 28% decrease in mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase in iron-loaded livers but no change in cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase. Increased hepatic malondialdehyde in chronic iron overload may result from a combination of increased production and decreased metabolism of malondialdehyde, both of which may be due to iron-induced mitochondrial lipid peroxidation.\r"

They offer CEOs a chance to relax and talk frankly with others about mutual problems and how to solve them.

These patients have virtually undetectable norepinephrine and epinephrine in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. The presence of intact sympathetic nerve activity in these patients has been suggested by the enhanced release of dopamine (but not norepinephrine) in response to maneuvers that augment sympathetic outflow in normal subjects. In the present study, we recorded sympathetic nerve traffic by using microneurography in a patient with dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency and measured sympathetic neural responses to static exercise, the cold pressor test, and pharmacological alterations of blood pressure. At rest, sympathetic nerve activity was abundant and was modulated in a normal manner by handgrip (+278%), the cold pressor test (+169%), hypotension induced with isoproterenol (+102%), and hypertension induced with phenylephrine (-85%). These results provide the first electrophysiological evidence for intact regulation of sympathetic neural outflow in a patient with dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency and suggest that central norepinephrine and epinephrine pathways believed essential for the control of sympathetic neurotransmission in humans may be supplanted by alternative redundant mechanisms.\r"

The diuretic and natriuretic responses to changes in renal perfusion pressure were compared in control rats (n = 15) and in rats receiving either meclofenamate (2 mg/kg, n = 9) or indomethacin (2 mg/kg, n = 4). In control rats, urine flow and sodium excretion increased from 10 +/- 2 to 118 +/- 10 microliters/min/g kidney wt and from 1.8 +/- 0.3 to 21.0 +/- 1.5 mueq/min/g kidney wt, respectively, when renal perfusion pressure was increased from 109 to 167 mm Hg. Urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane B2 increased significantly by 152% and 190%, respectively. Meclofenamate lowered thromboxane B2 and prostaglandin E2 excretion and prevented the increase in eicosanoid excretion produced by elevations in perfusion pressure. The pressure-diuretic and pressure-natriuretic responses of rats given meclofenamate or indomethacin were approximately half of those observed in the control rats. Papillary blood flow increased 21% and renal interstitial pressure rose from 5.0 +/- 0.7 to 8.2 +/- 0.7 mm Hg in control rats when pressure was elevated from 100 to 150 mm Hg. Meclofenamate and indomethacin lowered papillary blood flow and renal interstitial pressure and blunted the increases in these values produced by elevations in perfusion pressure. These results support the view that renal prostaglandins modulate the pressure-natriuresis relation by altering renal medullary hemodynamics and suggest that an intact renal prostaglandin system is necessary for the full expression of the medullary hemodynamic and natriuretic responses to increases in renal perfusion pressure.\r"

The 121 subjects, 18-23 years old, included 38 whites and 83 blacks. Blood pressure and heart rate response to the stress of mental arithmetic was measured before and after 14 days of sodium load, which consisted of 10 g NaCl/day added to the usual diet. A sodium-sensitive response to sodium load occurred in 18.4% of whites and 37.3% of blacks. Sodium-insensitive subjects had a higher rate of sodium excretion (p less than 0.001). Sodium-sensitive hypertensive subjects had a significantly greater weight gain (p less than 0.001). A significant correlation between blood pressure change and sodium excretion (r = -0.28, p less than 0.01) occurred in the sodium-sensitive group. The high sodium intake did not augment the blood pressure or heart rate response to the beta-adrenergic-mediated stimulus of mental arithmetic in the population when grouped by blood pressure, race, or sodium sensitivity. These results suggest that blood pressure increase in response to sodium load, particularly in blacks, is related to functional changes in peripheral vascular resistance.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effect of elevated blood pressure on the ultrastructure of rat aorta, hypertension (average mean pressure 163 +/- 17 mm Hg) was produced by suprarenal aortic coarctation. After 3 weeks, the subendothelium of the hypertensive thoracic aorta showed significantly increased volume measurements for mononuclear leukocytes and basement membrane-like material compared with the sham-operated control group. Focal areas of rarefaction of the subendothelial extracellular material were associated with the nearby presence of mononuclear leukocytes. None of these alterations were found in the normotensive abdominal aorta. The tunica media of hypertensive thoracic aorta also contained significantly increased basement membrane-like material. This new finding in an animal hypertension model is the direct result of the quantitative morphological approach employed in this study. In some rats, the partially constricting aortic ligature compromised the right renal artery leading to ischemic atrophy of the right kidney and hyperreninemia in addition to hypertension. In this group, excluded from the previous analysis and evaluated separately, subendothelial thickening and accumulation of basement membrane-like material in the thoracic aorta were greatly increased compared with the control group and other hypertensive rats. This result could not be attributed to an effect of blood pressure alone and might have been caused in part by humoral factors. Basement membrane accumulation appears to be an important early response of the arterial wall to hypertension or other factors in this rat model.\r"

Diltiazem decreased the basal tension (2.0 +/- 0.4 g) as well as the phasic contractile activity and returned the elevated 42K efflux (0.018 +/- 0.002/min) toward control values (0.010 +/- 0.001/min, p less than 0.001). The diltiazem median inhibitory concentration (IC50) for basal tension (0.04 +/- 0.02 microM), however, was sevenfold less than the IC50 for basal 42K efflux (0.22 +/- 0.08 microM, p less than 0.01). The basal 45Ca influx in aorta from aldosterone-salt hypertensive rats (120 +/- 4 microM/l cell H2O/min) was also decreased by diltiazem in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas the 45Ca influx in aorta from control-salt rats (135 +/- 3 microM/l cell H2O/min) was not altered. Similarly, the dihydropyridine nisoldipine eliminated the basal tension (2.7 +/- 0.5 g) and returned the elevated basal 42K efflux from the hypertensive aorta toward control levels (0.010 +/- 0.0003/min, p less than 0.001). The nisoldipine IC50 for basal tension (0.016 +/- 0.01 nM) was 160-fold less than the IC50 for basal 42K efflux (1.8 +/- 1.2 nm, p less than 0.001). Neither diltiazem nor nisoldipine nisoldipine altered the basal 42K efflux or contractile activity of aorta from control-salt rats. These results suggest that the basal tension and elevated 42K efflux in aorta from aldosterone-salt hypertensive rats are supported by the entry of extracellular calcium into the tissue through potential-operated calcium channels.\r"

We have previously reported that aspirin has antihypertensive effects in the standard animal model of essential hypertension, the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). Because the SHR has been reported to be deficient in T cells, it was of interest to determine whether the course of hypertension in this model could be altered by interleukin-2, the T cell growth factor. A single bolus of interleukin-2 (5,000 units/kg s.c.) prevented the increase of blood pressure in the young SHR and lowered pressure to normotensive levels in the well-established hypertensive adult SHR. In the latter, the effects of a single dose have been found to persist for at least 6 months with no toxic or untoward effects apparent. Blood pressure in Goldblatt, single-kidney wistar-kyoto rats, a model of renal hypertension, was not affected by interleukin-2.\r"

A temporal series of instantaneous pulmonary capillary pressure and the longitudinal distributions of vascular resistance and compliance were evaluated in the intact left lower lung lobe. In the control period, we found a significant phasic variation of pulmonary capillary pressure (Pc) with the cardiac cycle. The ratio of arterial to venous resistances (Ra/Rv) was 6:4, and the ratio of arterial to capillary compliances (Ca/Cc) was 1:11. During the infusions of serotonin and histamine, Pc showed similar phasic variations, despite significant hemodynamic changes induced by these agents. Serotonin predominantly increased Ra, whereas histamine predominantly increased Rv. The ratio of Rv to the total resistance decreased significantly from 0.42 to 0.32 during the infusion of serotonin and increased significantly to 0.62 during the infusion of histamine. The data suggest that phasic Pc determined by ECG-controlled arterial occlusion reflects the pulsatility in the pulmonary microvascular bed under control conditions and after alterations of the pulmonary vascular resistance by serotonin and histamine.\r"

Increasing respiratory flow from 0.1 to 0.4 1/s was found to increase inspiratory and expiratory Raw by 63% and 32%, respectively, and to decrease Iaw, but did not change tissue properties. Raw, Iti, and Cti were larger and Rti was lower during expiration than during inspiration. Decreasing lung volume from 70 to 30% of vital capacity increased Raw by 80%. Cti was larger at functional residual capacity than at the volume extremes. Preceding the measurement by a full expiration rather than by a full inspiration increased Iaw by 15%. The data suggest that the determinants of Raw and Iaw are not identical, that airway hysteresis is larger than lung hysteresis, and that respiratory muscle activity influences tissue properties.\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary and chest wall mechanics were studied in six anesthetized paralyzed dogs, by use of the technique of rapid airway occlusion during constant flow inflation. Analysis of the pressure changes after flow interruption allowed us to partition the overall resistance of the lung (Rl) and chest wall (Rw) and total respiratory system (Rrs) into two components, one (Rinit) reflecting in the lung airway resistance (Raw), the other (delta R) reflecting primarily the viscoelastic properties of the pulmonary and chest wall tissues. The effects of varying inspiratory flow and inflation volume were interpreted in terms of frequency dependence of resistance, by using a spring-and-dashpot model previously proposed and substantiated by Bates et al. (Proc. 9th Annu. Conf. IEEE Med. Biol. Soc., 1987, vol. 3, p. 1802-1803). We observed that 1) Raw and Rw,init were nearly equal and small relative to Rl and Rw (both were unaffected by flow); 2) Rrs,init decreased slightly with increasing volume; 3) both delta Rl and delta Rw decreased with increasing flow and increased with increasing lung volume. These changes were manifestations of frequency dependence of delta R, as it is predicted by the model; 4) Rrs, Rl, and Rw followed the same trends as delta R. These results corroborate data previously reported in the literature with the use of different techniques to measure airways and pulmonary tissue resistances and confirm that the use of Rl to assess bronchial reactivity is problematic. The interrupter techniques provides a convenient way to obtain Raw values, as well as analogs of lung and chest wall tissue resistances in intact dogs.\r"

Muscle carnitine acyltransferase I has previously been reported to be more sensitive to malonyl-CoA inhibition than is liver carnitine acyltransferase I. Fluctuations in malonyl-CoA concentration may therefore be important in regulating the rate of fatty acid oxidation in muscle during exercise. Male rats were anesthetized (pentobarbital via venous catheters) at rest or after 30 min of treadmill exercise (21 m/min, 15% grade). The gastrocnemius/plantaris muscles were frozen at liquid N2 temperature. Muscle malonyl-CoA decreased from 1.66 +/- 0.17 to 0.60 +/- 0.05 nmol/g during the exercise. This change was accompanied by a 31% increase in cAMP in the muscle. The decline in malonyl-CoA occurred before muscle glycogen depletion and before onset of hypoglycemia. Plasma catecholamines, corticosterone, and free fatty acids were all significantly increased during the exercise. This exercise-induced decrease in malonyl-CoA may be important for allowing the increase in muscle fatty acid oxidation during exercise.\r"

  ".W": "To identify lung units associated with liquid leakage into the air space in high-pressure pulmonary edema, we perfused air-inflated dog lung lobes with albumin solution to fill the loose peribronchovascular interstitium. Next, we perfused the lobes for 90 s with fluorescent albumin solution then froze the lobes in liquid nitrogen. This procedure confined the fluorescent perfusate to the liquid flux pathway between the circulation and the air space and eliminated the previously filled peribronchovascular cuffs as a source of the fluorescence that entered the air space. We divided each frozen lobe into three horizontal layers and prepared fluorescence-microscopic sections of each layer. In the most apical layers where alveolar flooding was minimal, 10.6 +/- 21.0% (SD) of alveolar ducts were either fluorescence filled or air filled and continuous with fluorescence-filled alveoli. In the same layers, 11.0 +/- 19.0% of respiratory bronchioles were similarly labeled. No terminal bronchioles in these layers were fluorescence labeled. This suggested that the fluorescent albumin entered the air space across the epithelium of respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, or their associated alveoli. To simulate an alternative explanation, i.e., that fluorescence first entered central airways then flowed into peripheral air spaces, we prepared two additional lobes that we first partially inflated with fluorescent albumin then filled to capacity with air. This pushed the fluorescent solution along the airways into the lung periphery. In these lobes the ciliary lining of bronchi and terminal bronchioles was fluorescence coated. By comparison, cilia in fluorescence-perfused lobes were not coated. We conclude that alveolar flooding in hydrostatic pulmonary edema occurs across the epithelium of alveolar ducts, respiratory bronchioles, or their associated alveoli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Increased Pi content was achieved by intermittent electrical stimulation of the muscle followed by occlusion of the blood flow. Occlusion resulted in the maintenance of a high Pi content over a 60-s observation period during which the muscle was either at rest or was stimulated electrically. The study was performed with and without infusion of epinephrine (EPI). In the absence of EPI the phosphorylase a fraction was 50% immediately at the end of the initial stimulation period, declining to 22% after 60 s. With EPI corresponding values for phosphorylase a were 91% initially, 56% after 30 s, and 33% after 60 s, respectively. In both cases the Pi content was increased by approximately 35 mmol/kg dry muscle during the stimulation and remained constant during the occlusion. In neither of these situations was significant degradation of glycogen observed during the occlusion. In the study performed with electrical stimulation during the occlusion period, muscle glycogen degradation was observed both with and without EPI. Phosphorylase a fractions and Pi contents in this study were similar to those observed when muscle was rested over the 60-s occlusion period. The paradox of a high Pi content and extensive transformation of phosphorylase to the a form but low glycogenolytic activity points to additional factors in the regulation of glycogen breakdown.\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary embolism in humans produces shallow tachypnea, and indirect experimental evidence suggests that this characteristic breathing pattern may result from activation of vagal unmyelinated afferents from the lung. We have investigated, in decerebrate cats, reflex changes in breathing pattern and in the activation of the diaphragm, posterior cricoarytenoid, and thyroarytenoid muscles caused by activating C-fiber afferents in the vagus nerve. The right vagus nerve was sectioned distal to the origin of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, eliminating vagal afferent traffic although preserving motor innervation of the larynx on that side. The left cervical vagus was stimulated electrically, and efferent activation of the laryngeal muscles was avoided by cutting the left recurrent laryngeal nerve. Transmission to the brain of vagal afferent traffic resulting from this stimulation was controlled by graded cold block of the nerve cranial to the site of application of the stimulus. Activation of C-fibers, when A-fibers were blocked, significantly decreased respiratory period and amplitude of diaphragm inspiratory burst. In addition, this selective activation of vagal C-fibers augmented postinspiratory activity of the diaphragm and recruited phasic expiratory bursts in the thyroarytenoid. We conclude that, in unanesthetized decerebrate cats, afferent traffic of vagal C-fibers initiates a pontomedullary reflex that increases respiratory frequency, decreases tidal volume, and augments braking of expiratory airflow.\r"

  ".W": "The vasculature of one lung of unanesthetized spontaneously breathing decerebrate cats was isolated and congested with blood. Such pulmonary vascular congestion (PVC) consistently resulted in a shallow tachypnea associated with expiratory activation of the diaphragm and thyroarytenoid muscles, signifying augmented expiratory braking. With progressive increases in pulmonary vascular pressure, tachypnea and expiratory braking increased progressively and ultimately obscured phasic activity in the diaphragm and thyroarytenoid. Thus the apnea caused by PVC constitutes not an arrest of neural respiratory activity but rather a continuous activation of thoracic inspiratory and laryngeal adductor muscles. When capsaicin, a neurotoxin that activates nonmyelinated afferents, was injected into the pulmonary artery of the isolated lung, it produced changes in timing and distribution of respiratory motor output that resembled those with PVC but were more abrupt in onset. Capsaicin, applied perineurally to the cervical vagi, preferentially blocked the conduction of nonmyelinated afferent fibers. This procedure, which produced little degradation in Hering-Breuer reflexes, eliminated tachypnea and expiratory braking caused by PVC or capsaicin injection. The results indicate that activation of pulmonary vagal afferent fibers of C or A-delta category in unanesthetized cats reflexly modifies the respiratory motor output in a way that resembles the human response to PVC or pulmonary embolism. This is a brain stem reflex.\r"

We estimated the parameters of the model from data obtained in four normal, anesthetized, paralyzed, tracheostomized mongrel dogs. This model explains why lung tissue and chest wall resistances should be markedly frequency dependent at low frequencies and also permits a physiological interpretation of resistance measurements provided by the flow interruption method.\r"

Respiratory and multiple inert gas tensions, ventilation, cardiac output (Q), and hemoglobin concentration were measured at rest and during three levels of constant-load cycle exercise during both normoxia [inspired PO2 (PIO2) = 148 Torr] and normobaric hypoxia (PIO2 = 91 Torr). After acclimatization, the measured alveolar-arterial PO2 difference (A-aPO2) for any given work rate decreased (P less than 0.02). The largest reductions were observed during the highest work rates and were 24.8 +/- 1.4 to 19.7 +/- 0.8 Torr (normoxia) and 22.0 +/- 1.1 to 19.4 +/- 0.7 Torr (hypoxia). This could not be explained by changes in ventilation-perfusion inequality or estimated O2 diffusing capacity, which were unaffected by acclimatization. However, Q for any given work rate was significantly decreased (P less than 0.001) after acclimatization. We suggest that the reduction in A-aPO2 after acclimatization is a result of more nearly complete alveolar/end-capillary diffusion equilibration on the basis of a longer pulmonary capillary transit time.\r"

  ".W": "Complex relationships exist among electromyograms (EMGs) of the upper airway muscles, respective changes in muscle length, and upper airway volume. To test the effects of preventing lung inflation on these relationships, recordings were made of EMGs and length changes of the geniohyoid (GH) and sternohyoid (SH) muscles as well as of tidal changes in upper airway volume in eight anesthetized cats. During resting breathing, tracheal airway occlusion tended to increase the inspiratory lengthening of GH and SH. In response to progressive hypercapnia, the GH eventually shortened during inspiration in all animals; the extent of muscle shortening was minimally augmented by airway occlusion despite substantial increases in EMGs. SH lengthened during inspiration in six of eight animals under hypercapnic conditions, and in these cats lengthening was greater during airway occlusion even though EMGs increased. Despite the above effects on SH and GH length, upper airway tidal volume was increased significantly by tracheal occlusion under hypercapnic conditions. These data suggest that the thoracic and upper airway muscle reflex effects of preventing lung inflation during inspiration act antagonistically on hyoid muscle length, but, because of the mechanical arrangement of the hyoid muscles relative to the airway and thorax, they act agonistically to augment tidal changes in upper airway volume. The augmentation of upper airway tidal volume may occur in part as a result of the effects of thoracic movements being passively transmitted through the hyoid muscles.\r"

To ascertain whether during adulthood other respiratory muscles have biphasic hypoxic responses similar to the DIA, in nine anesthetized cats electromyograms (EMG) were recorded from the DIA, genioglossus (GG), and triangularis sterni (TS) (n = 7) muscles during poikilocapnic hypoxia. DIA and GG EMG started at 60 +/- 4 and 9 +/- 3 units, respectively, during O2 breathing, increased to a maximum of 100 units during the 10-min hypoxic stimulus, and subsequently declined to 81 +/- 6 and 58 +/- 12 units, respectively, by the end of 10 min of hypoxia. The time course of the increase and subsequent decline was similar for the DIA and GG and for GG activity during both inspiration and expiration. Furthermore the degree to which GG EMG declined after reaching its peak activity level correlated with the magnitude of the respective decline in DIA EMG (r = 0.79, P less than 0.02). The TS, in contrast, was maximally active either during O2 breathing or very early during hypoxia, and its activity declined progressively thereafter (to 13 +/- 6% of its peak value at the end of 10 min of hypoxia). The degree to which TS EMG declined did not correlate with the degree to which DIA or GG EMG declined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Female rats were arbitrarily assigned to one of four groups. There were two sedentary groups that received either a vehicle (1% aqueous carboxymethyl cellulose) or cortisol acetate (100 mg/kg body wt) for 11 consecutive days and two exercise (treadmill running 29 m/min, 90 min/day, for 11 consecutive days) groups that received the activity simultaneously with either vehicle or steroid treatments. Protein synthesis measurements were performed by constant infusion of [3H]leucine. Fractional synthesis rates of MHC were determined from the leucyl-tRNA precursor pool, which was similar in all groups (range 2.85 +/- 0.32 to 3.51 +/- 0.43 dpm/pmol). Exercise prevented 30% of the plantaris muscle mass loss as the result of cortisol acetate treatment. MHC synthesis rates (%/day) in plantaris muscles of sedentary animals were reduced by glucocorticoid treatment to 65% (6.2/9.5) of the vehicle-treated group. Exercise did not alter this depression of MHC synthesis. The combination of exercise and glucocorticoid treatment reduced the calculated MHC breakdown rate (%/day) to 80% (-8.0/-10.1) of the rate resulting from hormone treatment alone and 60% (-8.0/-13.3) of the rate resulting from exercise alone. These results show that endurance exercise does not reverse the glucocorticoid inhibition of MHC synthesis in muscle but may act through reducing MHC breakdown.\r"

We have previously reported that cyclophosphamide administration to rats results in acute lung injury manifested by increased bronchoalveolar lavage albumin concentrations. In the current study we examine whether cyclophosphamide treatment affects pulmonary glutathione stores or bronchoalveolar endoperoxide metabolic product levels and whether these effects may be related to acute lung injury caused by the drug. We show that cyclophosphamide treatment causes a dose-dependent reduction in pulmonary glutathione stores 4 h after drug administration. In addition, acute lung injury as the result of cyclophosphamide can be abrogated by coadministration of oxothiazolidine carboxylate, an intracellular cysteine delivery system that also reverses pulmonary glutathione depletion induced by cyclophosphamide in our study. Finally, cyclophosphamide treatment reduces prostaglandin E2 concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage and alveolar macrophage culture supernatant in a dose-dependent fashion and increases bronchoalveolar thromboxane concentrations in low dose-treated animals. These effects are reversed to a variable degree by coadministration of oxothiazolidine carboxylate. Our study suggests in vivo pulmonary arachidonic acid metabolism and cyclophosphamide-induced acute lung injury are modulated by cellular glutathione stores. These findings may have important implications for the treatment of acute lung injury.\r"

  ".W": "For respiratory system impedance (Zrs), the six-element model of DuBois et al. (J. Appl. Physiol. 8: 587-594, 1956) suggests three resonant frequencies (f1,f2,f3), where f1 is the result of the sum of tissue and airway inertances and tissue compliance and f2 is the result of alveolar gas compression compliance (Cg) and tissue inertance (Iti). Three such resonant frequencies have been reported in humans. However, the parameter estimates resulting from fitting this model to the data suggested that f2 and f3 were not associated with Cg and Iti but with airway acoustic properties. In the present study, we measured Zrs between 5 and 320 Hz in 10 healthy adult humans breathing room air or 80% He-20% O2 (HeO2) to gain insight as to whether airway or tissue properties are responsible for the f2 and f3. When the subjects breathed room air, f2 occurred at 170 +/- 16 (SD) Hz, and when they breathed HeO2 it occurred at 240 +/- 24 Hz. If this resonance were due to Cg and Iti it should not have been affected to this extent by the breathing of HeO2. We thus conclude that f2 is not due to tissue elements but that it is an airway acoustic resonance. Furthermore, application of the six-element model to analyze Zrs data at these frequencies is inappropriate, and models incorporating the airway acoustic properties should be used. One such model is based on the concept of equivalent length, which is defined as the length of an open-ended, cylindrical tube that has the same fundamental acoustic resonant frequency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Results from these studies are reported using several different protein transport indexes, including pulmonary transvascular transfer coefficient, relative extravascular protein, pulmonary transcapillary escape rate, protein leak index, lung transferrin index, slope index, and lung-to-heart count ratios. The purpose of this study is to discover the relationships between these indexes by employing a two-compartment theory of protein transcapillary transport in the lung. We found that all the above indexes can be related to a single index, which we call the normalized slope index. This index is the time rate of change of radioactivity originating from protein in lung interstitium divided by radioactivity arising from protein in lung plasma, normalized by this ratio at time 0, and corrected for blood volume changes. In particular the normalized slope index is shown to be the same as pulmonary transcapillary escape rate under normal sampling conditions and is relatively unaffected by changes in interstitial volume. The response of the normalized slope index to changes in microvascular pressure and microvascular permeability is explored by applying a two-pore model of the microvascular barrier. Results indicate that the normalized slope index is relatively insensitive to changes in microvascular pressure but is greatly affected by changes in microvascular permeability (i.e., changes in large-pore size or number). Since all published leak indexes are related, we would encourage all investigators in the field to adopt a single leak index. We recommend that when a two-compartment model is applied to external detection data, the results be expressed as pulmonary transcapillary escape rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Tracheal airflow, inspiratory (TI) and expiratory (TE) times, inspiratory tidal volume (VT), end-tidal PO2 and PCO2, and arterial blood pressure were recorded simultaneously before and after HBO. Steady-state ventilation (VI at three arterial PO2 (PaO2) levels of approximately 99, 67, and 47 Torr at a maintained arterial PCO2 (PaCO2, 28 Torr) was measured for the hypoxic response. Ventilation at three steady-state PaCO2 levels of approximately 27, 36, and 46 Torr during hyperoxia (PaO2 450 Torr) gave a hypercapnic response. Both chemical stimuli significantly stimulated VT, breathing frequency, and VI before and after HBO. VT, TI, and TE at a given stimulus were significantly greater after HBO without a significant change in VT/TI. The breathing pattern, however, was abnormal after HBO, often showing inspiratory apneusis. Bilateral vagotomy diminished apneusis and further prolonged TI and TE and increased VT. Thus a part of the respiratory effects of HBO is due to pulmonary mechanoreflex changes.\r"

Normalized resting length (LFRC) was significantly decreased for the costal segment on postoperative day 1 compared with postoperative day 28. Fractional costal shortening both during QB and at 10% end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) increased significantly from postoperative days 1 to 28, whereas crural shortening did not change during QB but progressively increased at 10% ETCO2. Maximal costal shortening during electrophrenic stimulation was constant at 40% LFRC during recovery, although maximal crural shortening increased from 23 to 32% LFRC. Minute ventilation, tidal volume, and transdiaphragmatic pressure at 10% ETCO2 increased progressively after thoracotomy until postoperative day 28.

Heart rate and blood pressure changes indicated that baroreceptor firing was strongly reduced by TN and only mildly reduced by TP in 24 subjects. Baroreceptor effects of SP were unclear. SN and SP did not differ significantly in their effects on electroencephalogram (EEG) sleep. Among subjects who showed a normal baroreflex response to tilt, both TN and TP inhibited sleep, but TN caused a persistent elevation of EEG beta activity that did not occur in TP plus a greater delay in sleep onset. TN had no such arousing effects in four subjects who showed little or no baroreflex response to tilt. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the fall in baroreceptor firing produced by the upright posture contributes to EEG arousal.\r"

  ".W": "To study amino acid exchange between plasma and erythrocytes in vivo, 4-h primed, continuous intravenous infusions of L-[1-13C]leucine, [15N]glycine, and L-[15N]alanine were administered to five healthy young men in the postabsorptive state. Stable isotope enrichments and amino acid levels were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in both plasma and whole blood and estimated (using hematocrit) in erythrocytes. A high concentration gradient across the erythrocyte membrane was consistently found for glycine (552 +/- 268 microM in erythrocytes vs. 155 +/- 35 microM in plasma), but not for leucine or alanine. A steady-state isotopic enrichment was observed in whole blood as well as plasma for each amino acid in every subject. Steady-state [13C]leucine enrichment in erythrocytes did not differ from plasma enrichment at steady state, the ratio of erythrocyte to plasma enrichment being 1.03 +/- 0.20 (95% confidence limits = 0.78-1.28); in contrast, this ratio reached only 0.23 +/- 0.04 and 0.59 +/- 0.09 (confidence limits 0.18-0.28 and 0.48-0.70) for [15N]glycine and [15N]alanine at steady state, respectively. These results suggest that most of erythrocyte leucine is exchangeable with plasma, whereas only a fraction of erythrocyte glycine and alanine is involved in exchange with plasma in vivo.\r"

The lack of tubes penetrating the bubble surface eliminated potential leakage pathways for the surface film, which was compressed by increasing external pressure. Surface tensions and areas were calculated directly from bubble shapes without the need of pressure measurements. After only one to two compressions, the rabbit surfactant films exhibited the low surface tension, collapse rates, and compressibilities characteristic of the alveolar surface in situ and approached the behavior of spread DPPC films. The bubble \"clicking\" phenomenon described earlier by Pattle (Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 148: 217-240, 1958) was also reproduced, but only with the bovine extract, which did not perform as well as the rabbit surfactant in surface tests. These findings suggest that surfactant apoprotein SP-A, which was probably present in the rabbit but not the bovine preparations, enhances both adsorption and stability of pulmonary surfactant monolayers.\r"

Somatostatin (up to 10(-5) M) did not change resting tension, but it potentiated the contractile response to EFS dose dependently, with a maximum effect at 10(-6) M. Thus, at a concentration of 10(-6) M, somatostatin significantly decreased the mean log of EFS frequency producing 50% of maximum contraction from a control value of 0.52 +/- 0.07 to 0.24 +/- 0.06 (SE) Hz (P less than 0.01). The potentiating effect of somatostatin (10(-6) M) was not inhibited by hexamethonium, indomethacin, BW755C, pyrilamine, methysergide, or D,Pro2,D,Trp7,9-SP, but it was inhibited by atropine or by the somatostatin antagonist cyclo[7-aminoheptanoyl-Phe-D-Trp-Lys-Thr(Bzl)]. In contrast to EFS-induced contraction, contractions produced by acetylcholine (10(-9) to 10(-3) M) were not affected by somatostatin at a concentration of 10(-6) M. These results suggest that somatostatin potentiates contractions produced by EFS via presynaptic cholinergic mechanisms and probably through a specific somatostatin receptor.\r"

Our aim was to examine the effects of prolonged drainage of amniotic and allantoic fluids on lung liquid volume (Vl), secretion rate (Vs), and tracheal flow rate (Vtr) in fetal sheep. In five experimental animals, amniotic and allantoic fluids were drained from 107 to 135 days of gestation. The volume of fluid drained from the experimental animals was 411.8 +/- 24.4 ml/day (n = 140). In six control animals, amniotic fluid volume was 747.7 +/- 89.7 ml (n = 15). Wet and dry lung weights were 20-25% lower in experimental fetuses than in control fetuses. Fetal hemoglobin, O2 saturation, arterial PO2, pH, and hematocrit were unchanged by drainage. During the drainage period, Vl was up to 65% lower, Vs was up to 35% lower, and Vtr was up to 40% lower in experimental fetuses than in control fetuses. We conclude that prolonged drainage of amniotic and allantoic fluids decreases Vl, Vs, and Vtr in fetal sheep. These findings indicate that fetal lung hypoplasia associated with oligohydramnios may be the result of a prolonged reduction in Vl.\r"

  ".W": "This paper deals with a unifying hypothesis addressed at lung tissue resistance and its responses to neurohumoral and biophysical stimuli. The hypothesis holds that dissipative and elastic processes within lung tissue are coupled at the level of the stress-bearing element. Such a description leads naturally to consideration of a readily measured attribute of organ-level dissipative behavior called lung tissue hysteresivity, eta. On preliminary analysis this attribute is found to be nearly frequency independent and numerically conserved across species. To the degree that the numerical value of eta might be conserved during an intervention in which tissue dynamic elastance changes, such behavior would be consistent with the notion that elastic energy storage and dissipative energy loss reside within the very same stress-bearing element and, moreover, that those processes within the stress-bearing element bear an approximately fixed relationship. Tissue hysteresivity is closely related to the parameter K used by Bachofen and Hildebrandt (J. Appl. Physiol. 30: 493-497, 1971) to describe energy dissipation per cycle, and both lend themselves directly to interpretation based on processes ongoing at the levels of microstructure and molecule. Intraparenchymal connective tissues, surface film, and contractile elements appear to submit individually to this description and, in doing so, yield respective hysteresivities that are relatively well matched; this suggests that such hysteretic matching may be a necessary condition for synchronous expansion of the alveolar duct. The overriding simplicity with which this description organizes diverse observations implies that it may capture some unifying attribute of underlying mechanism.\r"

We studied effects of chronic steroid treatment on diaphragm mass and function. Eleven Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with cortisone acetate (100 mg.kg-1.day-1 im) for 10 days. Controls (injected with vehicle) included 11 freely eating rats and 11 animals pair fed to match food intake of cortisone rats. Steroid treatment depressed body weight 30% compared with controls. Mass of diaphragm, gastrocnemius, and extensor digitorum longus showed significant atrophy (30%); heart and soleus were unaffected. Isometric contractile properties of costal diaphragm strips were studied in vitro using direct stimulation. The force-frequency relationship was markedly depressed by steroid treatment, both at low and high frequencies. However, force developed per unit cross-sectional area was similar among all three groups, as were twitch characteristics. When stimulated every minute, forces developed by control strips fell progressively, whereas the forces of cortisone-treated strips remained unchanged. When stimulated every 5 s, the fall in force was not different between groups. We conclude that cortisone weakened the diaphragm by decreasing muscle mass but made the diaphragm more resistant to one form of fatigue in vitro.\r"

We hypothesized that this structural abnormality may also extend to the glottic and tracheal region. Consequently, we measured pharyngeal (Aph), glottic (Agl), cervical tracheal (Atr1), midtracheal (Atr2), and distal (Atr3) tracheal areas during tidal breathing in 66 patients with OSA (16 nonobese and 50 obese) and 8 nonapneic controls. We found that Aph, Agl, and Atr1, but not Atr2 or Atr3, were significantly smaller in the OSA group than in the control group. Obese patients with OSA had the smallest upper airway area, although the nonapneic controls had the largest areas. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the pharyngeal area, cervical tracheal area, and body mass index were all independent determinants of the apnea-hypopnea index, accounting for 31% of the variability in apnea-hypopnea index. Aph, Agl, and Atr showed significant correlation with the body mass index. We conclude that sleep-disordered breathing is associated with diffuse upper airway narrowing and that obesity contributes to this narrowing. Furthermore, we speculate that a common pathophysiological mechanism may be responsible for this reduction in upper airway area extending from the pharynx to the proximal trachea.\r"

In addition, we examined the effects of pentoxifylline (PTXF) on IL-2-induced acute lung injury. Three groups of animals were studied over a period of 8 h. The saline control group was injected intravenously with 2 ml of pyrogen-free saline; the IL-2 group was injected intravenously with 4 X 10(6) U/kg recombinant IL-2; and the IL-2-PTXF group was injected with a 20-mg/kg bolus of PTXF followed by a continuous infusion (6 mg.kg-1.h-1) started 60 min before injection of 4 X 10(6) U/kg IL-2. Lung water (wet-to-dry lung weight ratio), the concentration ratios of 125I-albumin in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung tissue compared with plasma (125I-albumin BAL-to-plasma, 125I-albumin lung-to-plasma), and cell counts in BAL fluid were examined. An intravenous injection of IL-2 caused an increased lung water (P less than 0.01), an increased 125I-albumin lung-to-plasma ratio (P less than 0.05), and a significant increase in the absolute number of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages in BAL fluid compared with the saline control. In contrast, the PTXF-pretreated group did not demonstrate IL-2-induced acute lung injury (lung water, 125I-albumin lung-to-plasma) or increased accumulation of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages in the BAL. These data suggest a possible role for PTXF in attenuating the side effects of IL-2.\r"

The mechanism of this hypoxia-exercise interaction requires intact carotid chemoreceptors. To determine whether carotid chemoreceptor stimulation alone is sufficient to elicit the mechanism without whole body hypoxia, ventilatory responses to treadmill exercise were compared in goats during hyperoxic control conditions, moderate hypoxia (PaO2 = 38-44 Torr), and peripheral chemoreceptor stimulation with the peripheral dopamine D2-receptor antagonist, domperidone (Dom; 0.5 mg/kg iv). Measurements with Dom were made in both hyperoxia (Dom) and hypoxia (Dom/hypoxia). Finally, ventilatory responses to inspired CO2 at rest were compared in each experimental condition because enhanced CO2 chemoreception might be expected to blunt the PaCO2 decrease during exercise. At rest, PaCO2 decreased from control with Dom (-5.0 +/- 0.9 Torr), hypoxia (-4.1 +/- 0.5 Torr), and Dom/hypoxia (-11.1 +/- 1.2 Torr). The PaCO2 decrease from rest to exercise was not significantly different between control (-1.7 +/- 0.6 Torr) and Dom (-1.4 +/- 0.8 Torr) but was significantly greater in hypoxia (-4.3 +/- 0.7 Torr) and Dom/hypoxia (-3.5 +/- 0.9 Torr). The slope of the ventilation vs. CO2 production relationship in exercise increased with Dom (16%), hypoxia (18%), and Dom/hypoxia (68%). Ventilatory responses to inspired CO2 at rest increased from control to Dom (236%) and Dom/hypoxia (295%) and increased in four of five goats in hypoxia (mean 317%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It was hypothesized that cardiac myosin phosphorylation is regulated in accordance with time-dependent sustained elevations in myocardial work demands requiring alterations in either heart rate or left ventricular pressure development. Exercise heart rates (HR) and double products (HR x DP) were equivalent among the three exercise groups and were significantly elevated in comparison with the normal-rest (NR) group (P less than 0.05). In phase II, isoproterenol elicited higher HR, although the atenolol group exhibited a marked reduction in HR, mean arterial pressure, and double product relative to NR (P less than 0.05). Percent myosin P-light chain phosphorylation exhibited both a HR- and a work load-dependent modulation in P-light chain levels (-9% to +23% change) in the two phases of the study (P less than 0.05). These data are consistent with the view that the above responses are associated with modulations in intracellular calcium concentrations commensurate with the alterations in HR and left ventricular pressure. Also, elevations in P-light chain phosphorylation could serve to augment left ventricular pressure development under these functional states.\r"

We investigated whether these receptors may be involved in feedback inhibition of cholinergic reflex bronchoconstriction induced by sulfur dioxide (SO2) in seven nonasthmatic atopic subjects and in six mild asthmatic subjects. In a control experiment, total respiratory resistance (Rrs) was increased by 30 +/- 5% in nonasthmatic and by 60 +/- 18% in asthmatic subjects. In nonasthmatic subjects, pilocarpine, an agonist of muscarinic M2-autoreceptors, increased Rrs by 15 +/- 5% and addition of SO2 increased Rrs to 21 +/- 5% above base line, which was not significantly greater than after pilocarpine alone. Histamine gave a comparable bronchoconstriction (25 +/- 3% increase in Rrs) and SO2 further increased Rrs to 39 +/- 6% above base line (P less than 0.05). Thus pilocarpine appears to inhibit SO2-induced bronchoconstriction in nonasthmatic subjects, and this effect is not explained by an increase in airway tone. In asthmatic subjects, pretreatment with pilocarpine increased Rrs by 31 +/- 8% and SO2 further increased Rrs to 88 +/- 17% above base line. SO2 alone gave a 60 +/- 18% increase in Rrs. Our results suggest that feedback inhibitory muscarinic receptors may be present on cholinergic nerves in normal airways and that there may be a dysfunction of this feedback mechanism in asthmatic airways. This might be contributory to exaggerated cholinergic reflex bronchoconstriction in asthma.\r"

The effects of in vivo activation of neutrophils on the in vitro responses of these cells to stimulation have not been determined, although such information may be important in understanding how different etiological factors may interact to produce infection or acute respiratory failure. By using an assay to sequentially measure superoxide anion (O2-) release from adherent neutrophils stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), we measured the in vitro activation response of peripheral blood neutrophils isolated before and 24 h after infusion of zymosan-activated plasma (ZAP; or untreated plasma as a control), air bubbles, or PMA in awake, instrumented sheep. Each of the three inflammatory agents produced an increase in lung microvascular permeability characteristic of acute lung injury; control plasma did not. For the in vivo ZAP experiments, stimulated O2- release in vitro by using PMA was approximately 50% lower (P less than 0.05) for neutrophils isolated 24 h after the in vivo infusion (4.3 +/- 0.8 nmol/500,000 cells) than before (8.1 +/- 0.2 nmol/500,000 cells). For the air emboli or PMA in vivo experiments, there were no changes in neutrophil activation responses in vitro. Similarly, infusion of control plasma did not result in reduced neutrophil O2- release. These results show that alterations in the inflammatory potential of neutrophils may occur in vivo and that such alterations appear to be dependent on the mechanism and agent by which lung injury is produced.\r"

Samples were obtained from young (28 +/- 0.2 yr) and old (68 +/- 0.6 yr) untrained control subjects and from groups of age-matched old trained subjects, who had been performing well-defined training programs at regular intervals for 12-17 yr. Measurements of maximum isometric force in knee extension showed that running and, especially, strength training produced a significant increase, whereas swim training was without effect. Both running and swim training increased endurance of knee extension, whereas strength training had a negative effect. When compared with untrained age-matched subjects, the swim-, running-, and strength-trained subjects demonstrated increased concentration of [3H]ouabain binding sites of 30% (P less than 0.01), 32% (P less than 0.05), and 40% (P less than 0.05), respectively. In the entire group of 28 individuals tested, maximum isometric strength and the concentration of [3H]ouabain binding sites showed correlation (r = 0.49, P less than 0.01). This upregulation of Na-K pump concentration might contribute to the reduction in exercise-induced hyperkalemia seen in trained subjects.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effect of phospholipase A2 (PLA2; Naja naja) challenge on pulmonary hemodynamics, airway constriction, and fluid filtration in isolated Ringer-perfused guinea pig lungs. Intratracheal PLA2 (10-100 U) produced dose-dependent increases in pulmonary arterial pressure, intratracheal pressure, and lung weight, although intravenous PLA2 administration had no effect on monitored variables. Morphological features indicative of airway constriction and pulmonary edema were observed by light microscopy. PLA2-induced increases in intratracheal pressure and/or lung weight were attenuated to varying degrees by pretreatment with indomethacin (1 microM, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor), ICI-198,615 (1 microM, a leukotriene D4 receptor antagonist), and WEB 2086 (1 microM, a platelet-activating factor antagonist). PLA2-induced increases in pulmonary arterial pressure and intratracheal pressure were also reduced in lungs removed from animals pretreated with dexamethasone (50 mg/kg ip for 2 days; a steroidal antiinflammatory agent). Pyrilamine (1 microM, a histamine1-receptor antagonist) and Takeda AA861 (1 microM, a delta 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor) did not produce significant inhibitory effects on PLA2-induced pathophysiological changes. Intratracheal instillation of high-dose platelet-activating factor (50 micrograms) or lysophosphatidylcholine (100 micrograms) produced gradual increases in intratracheal pressure and lung weight, but these changes were not as large as those induced by PLA2. Thus these studies suggest that resident cell populations associated with airways may play an important role in PLA2-induced pathophysiological changes in the perfused guinea pig lung. These PLA2-induced effects are most likely partially mediated by generation of eicosanoids and platelet-activating factor.\r"

Two normal adult human lungs from the autopsy service were fixed by instillation and serial sections were prepared; three tissues blocks showing a central bronchiole were selected. Primary and secondary alveolar walls were traced and the following parameters were measured: volume, surface area (of primary and secondary septa), curvature (in equivalent radius) for branches of individual generations, and cumulative values starting with the first alveolar duct and moving peripherally. Although branching was dichotomous, we noticed considerable asymmetry in the pattern of branching and number of side branches. The branching trees of alveolar ducts that we studied comprised 6,7, and 10 generations. The average volume of ducts was 0.04-0.13 mm3, the surface area of primary walls ranged from 0.3616 to 0.7931 mm2 and of secondary septal walls from 0.0100 to 0.0647 mm2. The equivalent radius of curvature was between 22.7 and 38.1 microns. Cumulative increases of volume and surface area revealed similarity in the first five generations. Secondary walls represented only 4% (or 8% if 2 sides are considered) of the primary surface area, strengthening the view that alveoli are incompletely developed side chambers secondary to the alveolar ducts.\r"

To study this phenomenon, we designed an in vitro system allowing pharmacological stimulation of either the inside or outside of the airway lumen. Rat tracheas were excised, cannulated, and their inside and outside perfused independently with Krebs solution. Two hooks were inserted through opposite sides of the tracheal wall, the lower one was attached to a fixed point, while the upper one was connected to a force transducer. Isometric contractions of the tracheal muscle were elicited by carbachol solution perfused in single and cumulative concentrations. In one-half of the preparations the epithelium was mechanically removed. Stimulation of the inside or outside of the trachea produced equal maximal tracheal muscle tension [1.55 +/- 0.14 and 1.2 +/- 0.09 (SE) g in and out, respectively]. The time course of tension development was longer when carbachol was administered inside the trachea: an effect that was abolished when the epithelium was removed. In addition, removal of the epithelium was found 1) to increase the maximal tension irrespective of the route of carbachol perfusion and 2) to increase the sensitivity of the preparation to carbachol stimulation.\r"

There were significant differences in pHi and metabolite ratios at the two temperatures under conditions of equal minute ventilation. During hypothermia, the brain pHi was 0.09 U higher, the phosphocreatine-to-inorganic phosphate (PCR/Pi) ratio 49% larger, and Pi-to-ATP 20% lower than at normothermia. These changes were fully reversible on warming the animal. The change in brain pHi/temperature was -0.011U/degrees C (95% confidence interval -0.007 to -0.016). The brain's ability to regulate its pHi and phosphate metabolism during hypercapnic acid-base stress was studied by using 10% CO2 ventilation. Hypothermic rats showed a larger fall in brain pHi (0.145 +/- 0.01 U, 7.15-7.01) with 10% CO2 than normothermic rats (0.10 +/- 0.02 U, 7.06-6.96). Similarly ventilated rats had a larger fall in arterial pH with 10% CO2 at hypothermia (0.36 +/- 0.04 U) than normothermia (0.24 +/- 0.01 U), so the delta brain pH/delta arterial pH was the same at both temperatures. The brain PCr-to-Pi ratio decreased approximately 20% during 10% CO2 breathing in both hypothermic and normothermic animals. Brain pHi and metabolite ratios returned to base line 30-50 min after CO2 washout in both groups. In summary, lowering body temperature while maintaining constant ventilation leads to changes in brain pHi and metabolites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The kinetics of O2 uptake (Vo2) and heart rate (HR) in response to constant work rate exercise have been characterized as two phases, an immediate response as the result largely of abrupt hemodynamic changes and a slower response as the result of increases in both blood flow and arteriovenous O2 difference (avDo2). There are few data reported concerning Vo2 and HR during phase I or the relationship between their kinetics and work rate or intensity. Because phase I responses depend on abrupt cardiovascular adjustments, it was hypothesized that phase I increases in Vo2 and HR would be greater the more \"fit\" the subject and would be relatively independent of work rate. To test this, 10 normal subjects exercised from rest to each of five work rates ranging from unloaded cycling to 150 W. The phase I increases of Vo2, HR, and Vo2/HR had small but significant correlations with work rate but not with fitness. At very low work rates (unloaded cycling and 25 W), Vo2 and HR often exceeded their steady-state levels in phase I. There was therefore no phase II increase for Vo2 or HR at these work rates, the entire O2 requirement having been met by phase I circulatory adjustments. For all other work rates, mean response times for Vo2 and HR were related to fitness and were slower than those for Vo2/HR, suggesting that avDo2 reached a steady state before cardiac output did.\r"

This allowed measurement of the intrinsic resistance (Rmin,rs) and of the effective additional resistance (delta Rrs) as the result of viscoelastic pressure dissipations within the pulmonary and chest wall tissues. We observed that 1) at fixed inflation volume, Rmin,rs increased linearly with increasing flow although delta Rrs decreased according to an exponential function; 2) at fixed inflation flow, Rmin,rs decreased with increasing inflation volume although there was a concomitant increase in delta Rrs. This behavior could be explained in terms of a spring-and-dashpot model incorporating 1) the standard resistance and elastance and 2) a spring-and-dashpot in parallel with standard elastance, reflecting the stress adaptation units within the thoracic tissues.\r"

Collateral resistance was measured in anesthetized dogs before and after exposure to isotonic and hypertonic aerosols and dry airflow. Hypertonic aerosols produced significantly greater responses than isotonic aerosols, and resistance increased in an exposure-dependent manner. Atropine attenuated responses to these challenges, indicating that aerosol-induced peripheral lung constriction was, in part, muscarinic in origin. Paired hypertonic- and dry airflow-induced constriction exhibited marked differences in magnitude and time course: responses to hypertonic aerosol peaked immediately; dry air-induced responses rose slowly to a maximum 5-min postchallenge. These differences may reflect differences in stimulus strength or differences in the regulatory pathways activated by each challenge. Despite this, a significant correlation exists between aerosol- and dry air-induced responses in the canine lung periphery and suggests that changes in airway fluid osmolality have an important role in the initiation of airflow-induced bronchoconstriction.\r"

Total lung deposition was determined by monitoring inert monodisperse aerosols [1.0 micron mass median aerodynamic diam (MMAD)] breath-by-breath, at the mouth, by means of a laser aerosol photometer. Cumulative aerosol deposition over the first five breaths as a percent of the initial aerosol concentration (AD5) was used as a deposition index. Regional deposition pattern was determined by scintigraphic images of sulfur-colloid aerosol (1.5 microns MMAD) tagged with 99mTc. Radioactivity counts in the right (R) and left lung (L) were expressed as a percent of the whole lung count. Half-lung AD5 was then determined by multiplying AD5 by fractional radioaerosol depositions in R or L. Pulmonary airflow resistance (RL mean +/- SE), as determined by an esophageal balloon technique, increased by 111 +/- 28 and 250 +/- 96% after CA and CS, respectively (P less than 0.05). AD5 also increased in all the sheep tested by 29 +/- 3 and 52 +/- 8%, respectively, after CA and CS (P less than 0.05). Radioaerosol deposition pattern was even at base line (R/L = 51:49) but shifted toward the unchallenged L after CS (R/L = 40:60). Deposition pattern after CA was variable: a shift toward L in three, no change in one, and a shift toward the R lung in two sheep.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One of endotoxin's many effects is to inhibit cytochrome P-450 mono-oxygenation reactions, which are believed to produce toxic O2 species. Therefore, one possible explanation for endotoxin's beneficial effect is that it inhibited P-450-mediated O2 radical production during hyperoxia. To test this hypothesis, we administered a single dose of cimetidine, a noncompetitive inhibitor of P-450 activity, to nine lambs before continuous exposure to greater than 95% O2. Compared with six control O2-exposed lambs, the cimetidine-treated O2-exposed lambs maintained normal gas exchange for a longer period of time (P less than 0.01), accumulated lung water at a slower rate (P less than 0.01), and had normal microvascular permeability after 72 h of O2 exposure. Postmortem levels of antioxidant enzymes in blood-free lung homogenate were not increased in cimetidine-treated lambs. However, the levels of oxidized glutathione were significantly lower in cimetidine-treated lambs, and the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione concentrations (GSH/GSSG ratio) was sevenfold higher than the ratio measured in control O2-exposed lambs (P less than 0.001). In four lambs, pretreatment with ranitidine (a drug chemically related to cimetidine but without P-450 inhibitory activity) had no effect either on the time course of O2 injury or on postmortem antioxidants. Microsomes were isolated from blood-free lung of all study animals and P-450 activity of the form 2 isozyme was measured.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

RBC suspensions were prepared using cells previously incubated in isosmolar phosphate-buffered saline with or without 0.0125 or 0.01875% glutaraldehyde. Washed RBCs were resuspended in isosmolar 4% albumin saline solution. Isolated rat lungs were perfused with control and stiffened cells by the use of a perfusion system that allowed rapid switching between suspensions. Pressure-flow (P/Q) curves were constructed by measuring pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) over a range of flow rates. In a second set of experiments, P/Q curves were generated for perfusion with control and stiffened cells (0.0125% glutaraldehyde) before and after vasoconstriction with a synthetic prostaglandin analogue (U 46619). RBC deformability was quantified in all experiments by determination of filtration time of a dilute cell suspension through a 4.7 microns Nuclepore filter. Incubation with 0.0125 or 0.01875% glutaraldehyde produced a 6 or 21% decrease in RBC deformability, respectively. These decreases in deformability were associated with significant increases in Ppa at each flow rate. The increases in Ppa correlated significantly with the degree of RBC stiffening. With 0.0125% glutaraldehyde, the P/Q curve was shifted upward without a change in slope, whereas incubation with 0.01875% glutaraldehyde resulted in a significant increase in slope. Vasoconstriction and perfusion with stiffened RBCs had additive effects on Ppa. These findings suggest that decreases in RBC deformability cause physiologically significant elevations in hemodynamic resistance in the pulmonary circuit independent of vasoactivity.\r"

Compared with control muscles from age-matched unoperated rats (n = 48), muscle mass and cross-sectional area increased in parallel from 28 to 52% over the 30-day postoperative period. Specific force of hypertrophied muscle was depressed 38% at days 1 and 3, and by 28% from days 5 to 30 after synergistic muscle ablation compared with age-matched control values. Interstitial space was 38% greater than the control value of 20.4 +/- 1 microliters/100 mg at day 1 only. Protein concentration was depressed 15% for 7 days after the ablation operation, and connective tissue protein concentration was unchanged. The relative magnitude of increased mean fiber cross-sectional area was less than that of muscle mass until day 7 after ablation. Mononuclear cell infiltration in interfascicular spaces occurred from days 3 to 30 without light microscopic evidence of muscle fiber injury. Initial functional deficits are explained in part by an enlarged interstitial space and decreased protein concentration; later deficits are likely accounted for by intracellular changes.\r"

The present studies were designed, therefore, to evaluate the pattern of activation of these muscles in the dog and to define their action on the rib cage during breathing. The results indicate that 1) the levator costae and external intercostals in the cranial part of the rib cage are active during inspiration, both in the supine and in the prone posture; 2) the inspiratory activation of the two muscles is increased after bilateral phrenicotomy; 3) it is increased even more when the parasternal intercostals in the different interspaces are also denervated; and 4) when the levator costae and external intercostals are the only muscles active during inspiration, the ribs continue to move cranially, and the sternum, rather than moving caudally as it does in the intact animal, moves cranially as well. Therefore, we conclude that the levator costae and external intercostals in the dog have a true inspiratory function. When needed, they are capable of causing a significant expansion of the rib cage and the lung during breathing.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of two consecutive histamine inhalation challenges on airways responsiveness was assessed in a group of eight nonsmoking nonmedicated asthmatics aged 19-27 yr. All subjects had a base-line forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) of greater than 80% of their predicted normal value before the initial challenge and were allowed to recover to greater than 95% of the initial base-line FEV1 value before the second challenge was initiated. The average airways recovery time after the first challenge was 44 min but ranged between 30 and 90 min. The mean +/- SD values of cumulative histamine dose units provoking a 20% decrease of the FEV1 from the buffer control value (PD20FEV1) were 10.79 +/- 5.95 determined with the first and 30.50 +/- 46.36 with the second challenge (P greater than 0.05). We conclude that sequential histamine challenges performed in mild asthmatics with closely controlled prechallenge airways function are well tolerated. Although some variance does exist in intersubject airways recovery time and in intra-subject histamine airways responsiveness determined by sequential challenges, our data do not support recent observations (J. Appl. Physiol. 63: 1572-1577, 1987) that histamine tolerance is a characteristic finding associated with bronchial asthma.\r"

  ".W": "We attempted to estimate the pressure-volume characteristics of airways downstream from the choke point when the airflow was abruptly interrupted during forced expiration. The change of gas volume of the downstream segment after interruption could be estimated by multiplying the maximum flow (Vmax) immediately before interruption by the interruption time because the Vmax is maintained for a short period after airflow interruption at the mouth, as described in our previous report (J. Appl. Physiol. 66: 509-517, 1989). For the pressure of the downstream segment, we used the mouth pressure itself. Airway compliance, a slope of the pressure-volume curve, was measured in an airway model in eight normal subjects, in six patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and in one patient with tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica. Airway compliance was 0.96 ml/cmH2O in normal subjects and 2.49 ml/cmH2O in COPD patients. This difference of airway compliance was believed to be caused by the longitudinal expansion of the downstream segment and changes in the properties of the airway wall.\r"

The osteomyelitis was arrested at the end of therapy and on follow-up examination of eleven patients in the first group and ten in the second group. The average duration of antibiotic therapy (thirty-eight days) and follow-up (approximately thirty months) were about the same for both groups. Oral administration of ciprofloxacin was as effective and safe as parenteral therapy for the treatment of osteomyelitis in these adults.\r"

  ".W": "An animal model of lumbar spinal stenosis was developed in which the pathophysiology of this condition could be examined. Four experimental groups, each containing six dogs, were studied. One group had a laminectomy of the sixth and seventh lumbar vertebrae only; these animals served as controls. In the three other groups, a laminectomy was performed and the cauda equina was constricted by 25, 50, or 75 per cent to produce chronic compression. Cortical evoked potentials were recorded preoperatively, immediately after constriction, and at one, two, and three months postoperatively. Daily neurological examinations were carried out, and the neurological deficits were graded using the Tarlov system. After three months of constriction, the cauda equina of three dogs in each group was examined histologically, and the vascular circulation was examined by latex and India-ink injection with a modification of the Spalteholz technique. The animals in the control group showed no neurological abnormalities, no changes in cortical evoked potentials, normal microvascularity, and no histopathological changes in the nerve roots or the spinal cord. The dogs in which the cauda equina had been constricted 25 per cent had no neurological deficits, mild changes in cortical evoked potentials, slight histological changes, and venous congestion of the root and dorsal root ganglion of the seventh lumbar nerve. The dogs in which the cauda equina had been constricted 50 per cent had mild initial motor weakness, major changes in cortical evoked potentials, edema and loss of myelin in the root of the seventh lumbar nerve, and moderate or severe venous congestion of the root and dorsal root ganglion of the seventh lumbar nerve. The dogs in which the cauda equina had been constricted 75 per cent had significant weakness, paralysis of the tail, and urinary incontinence; two dogs recovered by the third month, but all had neurogenic claudication for three months. All six dogs had dramatic changes in cortical evoked potentials and had complete nerve-root atrophy at the level of the constriction. There was blockage of axoplasmic flow and wallerian degeneration of the motor nerve roots distal to the constriction and of the sensory roots proximal to the constriction, as well as degeneration of the posterior column. Severe arterial narrowing at the level of the constriction and venous congestion of the roots and dorsal root ganglia of the seventh lumbar and first sacral nerves were also present. Cortical evoked potentials revealed neurological abnormalities before the appearance of neurological signs and symptoms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Between January 1, 1976, and January 1, 1986, we treated sixty-three patients who had histologically proved squamous-cell carcinoma that originated in a pre-existing scar or sinus of an extremity. In 49 per cent of the patients, metastases to regional lymph nodes either were present when the patient was first seen or subsequently developed. The age and sex of the patient, the etiology of the original scar, and the duration of illness bore no relationship to the result. The most significant factor in predicting the outcome was the grade of the tumor: for grade-I (low-grade) lesions, the incidence of metastasis was 10 per cent; for grade-II (moderately well differentiated) lesions, 59 per cent; and for grade-III (poorly differentiated) lesions, 86 per cent. Eleven patients had wide local excision of the lesion, which resulted in local recurrence in four patients and metastasis in three. Thirty patients had therapeutic amputation: one patient had recurrent disease and five patients had metastasis. Radical resection of lymph nodes after metastasis was uniformly unsuccessful in preventing additional metastasis. Ten patients who had a grade-II or grade-III tumor had prophylactic irradiation of the regional lymph nodes after the definitive operative treatment. At an average of thirty-seven months of follow-up, only one of them had metastasis. We recommend that well differentiated squamous-cell carcinoma be considered a low-grade tumor, according to the staging system for musculoskeletal neoplasms, and that more poorly differentiated squamous-cell carcinoma (grades II and III) be considered a high-grade lesion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
