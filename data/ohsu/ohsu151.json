There were multifocal, confluent, and nonconfluent creamy patches in the choroid. These lesions changed very little over periods of observation ranging from 1 to 4 years and failed to produce ophthalmoscopically visible disturbances of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Fluorescein angiography demonstrated dye collection within the lesions without leakage into the subretinal or subpigment epithelial spaces. Both ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) showed thickening of the choroid with either anterior or posterior episcleral extensions of lymphoid tissue. Pathologic evaluation of biopsy specimens of extraocular portions of the lesions showed low-grade tumors that were diffuse infiltrates of mature lymphocytes, which exhibited lymphoplasmacytoid features, Dutcher bodies, or small residual germinal centers (so-called borderline lesions). Two patients had uniocular localized disease, whereas the third had bilateral ocular lesions, hypogammaglobulinemia, and another extranodal chest wall lymphoid tumor. Therapy for the localized ocular condition consisted either of oral administration of corticosteroids or low doses of radiotherapy.\r"

Antibodies directed against autoantigens of the inner retina (nerve fiber, ganglion cell, and Muller cell) were found in the sera of 10 of 12 patients, but in only three of nine controls (P less than 0.003). Autoimmune antibodies against the outer segment of the photoreceptor were noted in 7 of 12 patients, in contrast to only one of nine controls (P less than 0.02). Findings with the ocular fluids generally mirrored those with the sera. These autoantibodies could not be absorbed by conventional techniques using either retinal S-antigen (S-Ag) or the interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein, an observation suggesting that other ocular antigens are involved. Such anti-retinal antibodies, especially those directed against the inner retina, may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of the retinal degeneration and optic atrophy that occur as a consequence of onchocerciasis.\r"

However, the manner in which this element is integrated within the more obvious acinar cells, as well as the role neoplastic intercalated duct cells play in determining morphologic patterns in acinic cell tumors, has not been fully investigated. Ultrastructural study and immunostaining with antibodies to cytokeratins and to S-100 protein carried out in nine cases of parotid acinic cell carcinoma suggest two basic differentiation patterns. In three cases, the lesions were essentially composed of acinar cells (with variation in the number and form of secretory granules), and one of these tumors was unique in having ultrastructural evidence of differentiated myoepithelial cells. In the second group of six cases, there was light microscopic, ultrastructural, and immunohistochemical evidence of a significant component of intercalated duct cells. By means of both immunostaining (intercalated ducts were positive for keratin and S-100 protein; acinar cells were negative for both antigens) and electron microscopy, flattened-to-cuboidal intercalated duct cells were noted to enclose and, presumably, to be involved in the formation of microcystic spaces. Acinic cell carcinomas with a more solid growth pattern contained groups of intercalated duct cells positive for keratin and S-100 protein. Ultrastructurally, these cells were organized into well-formed ducts related to nests of acinar cells. Acinic cell carcinoma is another class of salivary gland tumor in which there can be an integrated proliferation of intercalated duct and acinar cells and, infrequently, of myoepithelial cells, all organized in a simulation of the intercalated duct-acinar unit of the normal salivary gland.\r"

In each case, there was clinical resolution of mucositis and a concomitant decrease in the oral microbial burden 1 week after chlorhexidine use began. This strongly suggests that, in addition to its value in protecting these severely immunocompromised patients from oral infection, chlorhexidine also offers a therapeutic benefit in the resolution of existing oral infections and of mucositis.\r"

A review of the English-language literature revealed only 48 well-documented cases of peripheral epithelial odontogenic tumors. Thirty-two were peripheral ameloblastomas; six were peripheral adenomatoid odontogenic tumors; nine were peripheral calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumors; and one was a peripheral squamous odontogenic tumor. An additional four cases were reported as peripheral ameloblastomas in extragingival locations, but their odontogenic origin is debatable. Although the peripheral ameloblastoma is histologically similar to its central counterpart, it differs in its clinical features and biologic behavior. It does not exhibit an aggressive, destructive behavior and does not invade the underlying bone. Conservative excision of the tumor with minimal but adequate margins is the treatment of choice and recurrences are uncommon. This benign biologic behavior appears to be true also for lesions diagnosed as peripheral calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumors and undoubtedly is true for the peripheral adenomatoid odontogenic tumors.\r"

Recuts of all biopsy specimens, accessioned over a 6-month period, that had been stained with Grocott's methenamine silver (GMS) were stained with CW and examined. Of the 34 cases from which specimens were reviewed, 17 had specimens that were positive for the presence of fungal organisms as indicated by both GMS and CW staining. Specimens from all of the 17 remaining cases were negative for the presence of fungal organisms, as staining with both GMS and CW indicated. Similar results were obtained with direct fungal smears. The CW technique has significant advantages over traditional methods, including rapidity, cost, sensitivity, simplicity, and absence of interference with permanent fungal stains.\r"

Consistently high placebo response rates of as much as 44% have been reported in subjective studies of dysmenorrhea. In an effort to evaluate the discordant role of objective uterine activity known to be associated with primary dysmenorrhea and the subjective sensation of discomfort, data from 18 patients undergoing meclofenamate therapy for primary dysmenorrhea were evaluated. In this study both the sum of pain intensity differences (SPID) and the total pain relief scores at each study time (TOTPAR) showed increases during both drug and placebo therapy with statistically significant differences favoring drug therapy. Ten percent of patients eventually reported 'complete relief' during placebo therapy. In contrast to this subjective placebo response, objective measures of intrauterine pressure showed consistent worsening in 13 out of 14 pressure parameters with 25% of patients experiencing a 2-fold or greater increase in the number of contractions while on placebo therapy. The ability to document unchanged or worsening objective parameters associated with the development of 'pain' in the face of reported subjective improvements may provide new insight into the mechanisms by which the 'placebo effect' occurs.\r"

Potassium balance is closely regulated by a variety of nonrenal and renal mechanisms. When potassium losses are sufficient to induce hypokalemia, either through nonrenal or renal causes, profound adverse effects on neuromuscular, cardiac, vascular, and renal tissues may ensue. The diagnostic approach is straightforward, and therapy must be directed to replenish losses without inducing a rapid, excessive, and potentially fatal increase in the potassium concentration of the serum.\r"

However, renal calculi continue to be identified with greater frequency in certain children: those who live in some areas of North America (e.g., the Southeastern United States), in those with relatively common metabolic disorders such as idiopathic hypercalciuria or with congenital urinary tract malformations, and in patients who have remained immobilized for long periods. Evaluation of children with suspected urolithiasis should include a careful history and physical examination to identify associated symptoms and signs and factors known to predispose to calculus formation, appropriate radiographic and blood studies, and timed urine collections. Appropriate management varies with etiology but should include maintaining adequate fluid intake, and long-term monitoring of the activity of the stone disease.\r"

A small functional bladder capacity and a maturational delay appear to be the relevant causes, considering the high rate of spontaneous cure. Only some children with primary enuresis show evidence of emotional or behavioral problems. The physician caring for an enuretic patient should remember that in the absence of obvious clinical manifestations (which must be treated immediately) the best treatment for enuresis is giving reassurance, offering supportive counseling and allowing time for spontaneous remission. Only when the presence of enuresis interrupts the sequence of normal social, emotional, cognitive, or motor development, should the use of medication or devices be considered.\r"

The two treatment groups of patients were comparable with regard to sex, gestational and chronologic ages, associated risk factors, clinical condition on enrollment, focus of infection and bacteriology. Escherichia coli was isolated from blood cultures of 31%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa from cultures of 25%, Klebsiella sp. from cultures of 13% and other Gram-negative enteric bacilli from cultures of 17% of the patients. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 20% (12 of 60), and coagulase-negative staphylococci from 8% (5 of 60) of the patients. All Gram-negative coliform bacilli were susceptible to ceftazidime whereas 10, 56 and 77% were resistant to amikacin, carbenicillin and ampicillin, respectively. Serum bactericidal activity against the offending pathogen was as much as 5-fold greater in ceftazidime-treated compared with conventionally treated patients. Seven patients with infections caused by organisms resistant to the study drugs were excluded from analysis. Case-fatality rates were 6.4% (2 of 31) and 21% (6 of 28) in the ceftazidime- and amikacin/carbenicillin-treated patients, respectively. Total failure rates, including deaths, were significantly higher in patients treated with amikacin/carbenicillin (8 of 28, 28.5%) compared with that of ceftazidime-treated patients (2 of 31, 6.4%). Thirteen percent (5 of 31) and 3% (1 of 28) of the ceftazidime- and amikacin/carbenicillin-treated patients, respectively, developed invasive Candida albicans superinfection while receiving treatment. In this study results of treatment with ceftazidime were superior to results of treatment with amikacin/carbenicillin for invasive bacterial infections of newborn infants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We then determined the relationship between development and the disease-related variables. Infants were assessed with the Bayley scales, and children were assessed with the Stanford-Binet scales of intelligence and the Minnesota Child Development Inventory. The mean +/- SD mental and motor scores for infants were 79.5 +/- 19.6 and 69.7 +/- 17.6, respectively. The mean +/- SD IQ and motor development scores for children were 76.1 +/- 16.6 and 56.9 +/- 18.1, respectively. For infants, mental and motor development were related significantly to height and weight (r values ranged from .42 to .72). Mental development in infants was also related significantly to serum vitamin E levels (P = .03). Multiple regression analyses combining growth and disease-related indices predicted 70% of the variance in mental and motor development in infants (P = .001). For children, development was related to measures of liver function (ie, to serum bilirubin, r = -.51, P = -.08, and to serum albumin, r = .54, P = .06) but not to growth. Careful nutritional support during infancy and aggressive management of liver disease prior to transplantation may be important in optimizing the development of children with biliary atresia who subsequently undergo liver transplantation.\r"

A double-blind, randomized trial of subcutaneous epinephrine upsilon normal saline was conducted in children less than 24 months of age evaluated at Yale-New Haven Hospital. Respiratory assessments using a newly developed Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument were made at baseline and 15 minutes after each of two injections. Relief of respiratory distress was assessed using strict a priori criteria based on changes in respiratory rate, wheezing, and retractions as scored in the Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument. Significantly more children improved their respiratory status with epinephrine (nine of 16) than placebo (one of 14) (Fisher exact test, P = .0067). Paired data in individuals receiving placebo and then epinephrine confirmed this (Wilcoxon signed ranks test, P less than .01). Sixty-three percent of patients less than 12 months and 92% of those 12 to 24 months improved with epinephrine, as did seven of ten children with respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis. In many children, response to the initial epinephrine injection was not indicative of final response. Results of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of epinephrine in the treatment of acute wheezing in children less than 24 months of age.\r"

All subjects received two consecutive identical cycles of chemotherapy with the trial antiemetics given in accordance to a body weight-based dosage schedule beginning eight to 12 hours before treatment. The overall rate of improvement of retching and emesis was 70% during the nabilone and 30% during the prochlorperazine treatment cycles (P = .003, chi 2 test). On completion of the trial, 66% of the children stated that they preferred nabilone, 17% preferred prochlorperazine, and 17% had no preference (P = .015, chi 2 test). Major side effects (dizziness, drowsiness, and mood alteration) were more common (11% v 3%) during the nabilone treatment cycles. CNS side effects appeared to be dose related and were most likely to occur when the nabilone dosage exceeded 60 micrograms/kg/d, but individual tolerance to nabilone varied considerably. Lower dosages of nabilone were associated with equivalent efficacy and no major side effects. Nabilone appears to be a safe, effective, and well-tolerated antiemetic drug for children receiving cancer chemotherapy. Although major side effects may occur at higher dosages, nabilone is preferable to prochlorperazine because of improved efficacy.\r"

Such abnormalities primarily serve to indicate the need for close follow-up and to heighten the physician's concern about the possible development of clinical symptoms. For those patients with systemic manifestations who require corticosteroids, a regimen of single daily doses is appropriate. The dose should be tapered as rapidly as the degree of symptomatic control allows; a switch to alternate-day therapy can be considered as symptoms become quiescent. Intravenous methylprednisolone therapy may be used for patients with very severe systemic disease, particularly acute nephritis. In addition, use of immunosuppressive agents should be considered for all patients with clinically serious renal disease.\r"

Prevention is therefore of the utmost importance and has to come primarily from a reduction in the incidence and damage done from myocardial infarction.

In the present study, we investigated the DNA-binding properties of p40mos and two mos deletion mutant proteins. Nitrocellulose blot protein-DNA binding assays showed that p40mos binds DNA in the presence of Mg2+-ATP and certain other nucleoside triphosphates. Ninety percent of the p40mos-bound DNA is dissociated if the complex is washed in the presence of 1 M NaCl or in the absence of ATP. p40mos-DNA binding is not observed in the presence of AMP or the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog adenosine 5'-[beta, gamma-methylene]-triphosphate; however, in the presence of ADP, p40mos binds DNA at 20% of the level that is observed with ATP. An N-terminal-deletion mutant protein, p19mos, has no DNA-binding activity, whereas a C-terminal-deletion mutant protein, p25mos, does. p25mos contains the ATP-binding domain, binds DNA in the presence of either ADP or ATP, and shows 5% and 45% binding (relative to that in the presence of ATP) in the presence of AMP and adenosine 5'-[beta, gamma-methylene]triphosphate, respectively. These results suggest that the N-terminal domain of p40mos is responsible for nucleoside triphosphate-mediated DNA binding. We also observed differential histone-DNA binding in the presence and absence of ATP.\r"

  ".U": "87231859\r", 
  ".W": "Oligosaccharide processing is controlled by host- and protein-dependent factors. To increase our understanding of the relative contribution of those factors we studied the glycosylation of yeast invertase expressed in a heterologous system. Invertase synthesized in psi-2 cells (an NIH 3T3-derived packaging line) is secreted efficiently, enzymatically active, and heavily glycosylated. It was estimated that the protein contains 8 or 9 carbohydrate chains. Two classes can be observed, of an approximate size of 100-110 kDa and 115-130 kDa, respectively. The size differences are due to differences in glycosylation. The smaller class contains two high-mannose carbohydrate chains; the remainder is of the complex type, sialylated and most likely tri- or tetraantennary. This profile parallels the situation observed with invertase glycosylation in yeast, where 2 of 9 or 10 chains remain unprocessed. The larger size class of invertase expressed in mouse fibroblasts has a different profile, since it contains probably only complex-type glycans. There are no apparent differences, however, in the size of the protein backbone between the two size classes. When invertase is synthesized in the presence of the mannosidase inhibitor 1-deoxymannojirimycin, processing is blocked completely, since all glycans are susceptible to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H. The glucosidase inhibitor 1-deoxynojirimycin does not inhibit processing completely. In both cases secretion of the protein is not affected. The glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin prevents secretion of invertase completely when cells are cultured at 37 degrees C. At 26 degrees C, however, nonglycosylated invertase can be detected in the medium. These data suggest that glycosylation of invertase seems to be essential for the early steps of the secretory pathway but is less critical for later events.\r"

  ".W": "The acute and long-term effects of growth hormone (GH) on the binding of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) were evaluated in adipose cells from hypophysectomized rats given replacement therapy with thyroxine and hydrocortisone and in cells from their sham-operated littermates. After the cells were incubated with insulin and/or GH, the recycling of IGF-II receptors was metabolically inhibited by treating the cells with KCN. IGF-II binding was 100 +/- 20% higher in cells from GH-deficient animals when compared with sham-operated controls. These GH-deficient cells also showed an increased sensitivity for insulin as compared with control cells (the EC50 for insulin was 0.06 ng/ml in GH-deficient cells and 0.3 ng/ml in control cells). However, the maximal incremental effect of insulin on IGF-II binding was reduced approximately 27% by hypophysectomy. GH added to the incubation medium increased the number of IGF-II binding sites by 100 +/- 18% in cells from hypophysectomized animals. This increase was rapidly induced (t1/2, approximately 10 min), but the time course was slower than that for the stimulatory effect of insulin. Half-maximal effect of GH on IGF-II binding was obtained at approximately equal to 10 ng/ml. Thus, GH added in vitro exerted a rapid insulin-like effect on the number of IGF-II receptors. GH also appears to play a regulating role for maintaining the cellular number of IGF-II receptors and, in addition, modulates the stimulatory effect of insulin on IGF-II binding.\r"

  ".W": "The Escherichia coli UvrA protein has an associated ATPase activity with a turnover number affected by the presence of UvrB protein as well as by DNA. Specifically, the structure of DNA significantly influences the turnover rate of the UvrAB ATPase activity. Double-stranded DNA maximally activates the turnover rate 10-fold whereas single-stranded DNA maximally activates the turnover rate 20-fold, suggesting that the mode of interaction of UvrAB protein with different DNAs is distinctive. We have previously shown that the UvrAB protein complex, driven by the binding energy of ATP, can locally unwind supercoiled DNA. The nature of the DNA unwinding activity and single-stranded DNA activation of ATPase activity suggests potential helicase activity. In the presence of a number of helicase substrates, the UvrAB complex, indeed, manifests a strand-displacement activity--unwinding short duplexes and D-loop DNA, thereby generating component DNA structures. The energy for the activity is derived from ATP or dATP hydrolysis. Unlike the E. coli DnaB, the UvrAB helicase is sensitive to UV-induced photoproducts.\r"

Factor TUF was identified by using two highly selective methods. The DNA-protein complex was isolated by pore-limit electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gradient gels and found to contain a single polypeptide of 150 kDa. In a two-step protein-blotting/nuclease-protection (\"footprinting\") procedure, the same 150-kDa polypeptide blotted on nitrocellulose exhibited the same specific DNA-binding properties as TUF factor. A 50-kDa DNA-binding domain of TUF was isolated by selective proteolysis. This suggests a bipolarization of the TUF protein, with distinct functional domains.\r"

Mini-P1 DNA replication requires the E. coli DnaA initiation protein in addition to the P1 RepA initiation protein. The reaction is inhibited by rifampicin, novobiocin, and antibody to DnaB, suggesting the involvement of RNA polymerase, DNA gyrase, and DnaB protein. Replication is initiated in the region of the P1 origin of replication and proceeds unidirectionally as determined by electron microscopy.

We report that purified ubiquitin has intrinsic proteolytic activity and demonstrate that this activity is comparable to that of other well-characterized proteases. Monoclonal antibodies specific to ubiquitin inhibit proteolysis. Ubiquitin has protease activity over a broad pH range with an optimum at pH 8.0. It is stimulated by Ca2+ and is inhibited by high concentrations of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and diisopropyl fluorophosphate. Ubiquitin will cleave proteins at a limited number of sites. We propose that the ubiquitination of a protein can convert that protein into an ad hoc specific protease and models are presented as to how this can play a role in regulating a variety of cellular events.\r"

  ".W": "A cell growth inhibitor (GI), purified from BSC-1 cell-conditioned medium, has little if any effect on DNA synthesis when added alone to monolayer cultures of quiescent Swiss mouse 3T3 cells in serum-free medium. However, the inhibitor, which is closely related to transforming growth factor type beta (TGF-beta), exhibits a pronounced synergistic stimulation of DNA synthesis in combination with certain peptide (bombesin, vasopressin) or polypeptide (platelet-derived growth factor) mitogens. A similar synergistic response has been demonstrated for TGF-beta purified from human platelets. In the presence of 3 nM bombesin, a half-maximal stimulation of DNA synthesis was obtained at a GI concentration of approximately 60 pg/ml, with a maximal response at approximately 600 pg/ml. The synergistic interactions demonstrated by GI or TGF-beta in stimulating Swiss 3T3 cells closely resemble those previously shown for insulin, and we have observed that GI does not synergize with insulin to stimulate DNA synthesis in these cells. Like insulin, and in contrast to bombesin, vasopressin, and platelet-derived growth factor, GI does not activate cellular inositolphospholipid hydrolysis, calcium mobilization, or cross-regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor affinity. These results raise the possibility that the biochemical pathways activated by GI/TGF-beta and insulin converge at a post-receptor stage.\r"

Transformation has been used to introduce a plasmid containing the nit-2 gene into A. nidulans. The nit-2 gene of Neurospora complemented mutations in the areA gene, restoring the ability to use a variety of nitrogen sources. This indicated that the activator function of nit-2 and areA gene products was retained across these two fungal species. Southern blot analysis revealed both single-copy and multicopy integrations and, in at least one case, integration appeared to generate a nit-2 mutation. Integration of the transforming plasmid appeared to be by nonhomologous events at a number of different sites in the Aspergillus genome. The transformants were less sensitive to nitrogen-metabolite repression of extracellular protease activity and nitrate reductase (EC 1.6.6.3) than were wild-type A. nidulans. This indicated that nitrogen control was not completely normal in the nit-2 transformants.\r"

Cisplatin is known to form mainly intrastrand diadducts at ApG and GpG sites. We found that cisplatin efficiently induces mutations in an SOS-dependent way (i.e., dependent upon UV irradiation of the host bacteria). More than 90% of the mutations are single-base-pair substitutions occurring at the potential sites of cisplatin adducts (ApG and GpG). Taking into account the relative proportions of ApG and GpG adducts, we found that the ApG adducts are at least 5 times more mutagenic than the GpG adducts. Moreover, a strong mutation specificity was seen at the 5' side of the ApG adducts (A X T----T X A transversions). The observation that most mutations occur at the 5' end of the adduct at both ApG and GpG sites is discussed in relation to recent structural data.\r"

IAPP from human insulinoma contained 37 amino acid residues and had a theoretical molecular mass of 3850 Da. The amino acid sequence is unique but has greater than 40% identity with the human calcitonin gene-related peptide. A partial amino acid sequence of cat islet IAPP corresponding to positions 1-27 of human insulinoma IAPP was identical to the human IAPP except for substitutions in three positions. An antiserum raised to a synthetic human insulinoma IAPP-(7-17) undecapeptide showed specific immunohistochemical reactivity with human and cat islet amyloid and with islet B cells. The significance of this pancreatic neuropeptide-like protein is unknown, but it is suggested that it may exert an important endocrine regulatory effect.\r"

After surgical transection of the medullary portion of the olivocerebellar tract, CRF-immunostaining accumulated in inferior olive neurons contralateral to the lesion. In situ hybridization histochemistry indicated that CRF mRNA is transcribed in inferior olive neurons for translation to CRF precursor, whereas CRF mRNA was depleted contralateral to the lesion. CRF-immunopositive fibers of the olivocerebellar tract were demonstrated ipsilateral to the transection due to an accumulation in the proximal portion of transected axons. CRF-immunopositivity was demonstrated in climbing fibers in the molecular layer of the cerebellum at both light- and electron-microscopic levels. CRF-immunostained nerve terminals (climbing fiber varicosities) established synaptic contact with dendritic spines of the Purkinje cells. These three observations provide morphological evidence suggesting that CRF might serve as a neurotransmitter in the olivocerebellar system.\r"

Thus, the stain with mAb 271A6 was observed throughout the gray matter of all regions of the neocortex, piriform cortex, hippocampus, striatum, septum, and the amygdaloid nucleus, in addition to the main and accessory olfactory bulbs. The mAb 271A6, however, labeled neither nontelencephalic regions of the central nervous system nor the peripheral nervous system so far examined. Dot-immunobinding assays of homogenates of various brain regions also showed the telencephalon-specific distribution of the antigen designated as 271A6. Antigen 271A6 is developmentally regulated. At birth, the antigen was expressed in a small quantity only in phylogenetically older telencephalic regions such as the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, striatum, cingulate cortex, and hippocampus. It was hardly detectable in most areas of the neocortex. The densities and areas of 271A6-positive structures increased during the early postnatal period. These results demonstrate a molecular specificity of the most rostral brain segment, the telencephalon. mAb 271A6 may be a good tool for obtaining a better understanding of the molecular basis of the segmental organization or the segment-specific functions of the brain.\r"

The insulin-dependent activation of microsomal histone kinase activities occurs within the physiological range of hormone concentrations (ED50 = 0.6 nM). The hormone-enhanced histone phosphorylation by the high-density microsomes appears to be catalyzed by two distinct kinases, based on their differential interaction with wheat germ agglutinin-agarose. The insulin-sensitive serine/threonine kinase is not retained by The insulin-sensitive serine/threonine kinase is not retained by the lectin column, whereas the tyrosine kinase appears to be a glycoprotein as evidenced by its adsorption to the immobilized lectin. The insulin-stimulated serine/threonine kinase exhibits preferential phosphorylation of histone and Kemptide (synthetic Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly) compared to a number of other peptide substrates. The substrate specificity of this serine/threonine kinase shows that it is distinct from the kinases that phosphorylate ribosomal protein S6, casein, phosvitin, ATP citrate lyase, and glycogen synthase and from multifunctional calmodulin-dependent, cAMP- and cGMP-dependent, and Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinases. Furthermore, 22% of the insulin-sensitive serine/threonine kinase activity can be adsorbed by monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies immobilized on agarose. Its adsorption is specifically inhibited by excess free phosphotyrosine but not phosphoserine or phosphothreonine. The data suggest that this insulin-stimulated serine/threonine kinase in adipocyte high-density microsomes is tyrosine-phosphorylated, consistent with the hypothesis that the stimulatory action of insulin on this kinase may be mediated by tyrosine phosphorylation.\r"

They scattered widely downstream from the phi 1.1 promoters and mostly downstream from the phi 1.3 promoter.

Regulation is mediated through sequences that both positively and negatively modulate CAR1 transcription. A short sequence, 5'-TAGCCGCCGAGGG-3', possessing characteristics of a repressor binding site, plays a central role in the induction process. A fragment containing this upstream repression sequence (URS1) repressed gene expression when placed either 5' or 3' to the upstream activation sequences of the heterologous gene CYC1. Action of the URS and its cognate repressor was overcome by CAR1 induction when the URS was situated cis to the CAR1 flanking sequences. This was not observed, however, when it was situated downstream of a heterologous CYC1 upstream activation sequence indicating that URS function is specifically neutralized by cis-acting elements associated with CAR1 induction. Searches of sequences in various gene banks revealed that URS1-like sequences occur ubiquitously in genetic regulatory regions including those of bacteriophage lambda, yeast, mammalian, and viral genes. In a significant number of cases the sequence is contained in a region associated with negative control of yeast gene regulation. These data suggest the URS identified in this work is a generic repressor target site that apparently has been conserved during the evolution of transcriptional regulatory systems.\r"

They contain the P1 (capsomer precursor) region of the poliovirus genome or P1 and part of P2 (a nonstructural precursor), which can be transcribed and translated in vitro. A transcript containing the entire 5' nontranslated region and the P1 region of the viral RNA gave poor translation in a reticulocyte translation system. Truncation of the 5' nontranslated region to its 3'-most segment gave acceptably good yields of radiolabeled P1. P1 was specifically processed to yield capsomer proteins by enzymes supplied in a postmitochondrial supernatant from poliovirus-infected cells. Thus, proteinase 3C can be supplied exogenously (in trans) and effect processing. This system may be used to provide P1 for the assay of proteinase 3C. Precursors that lacked either the 1A or 1D regions were poor substrates for proteinase 3C--observations that demonstrated a stringent structural requirement in processing by 3C. The translation product of a transcript encoding P1 and part of P2 was rapidly cleaved at the P1-P2 site in the absence of infected-cell extract. A transcript that contained a mutated 2A region gave a stable P1-P2 precursor that could be processed specifically by exogenous proteinase from infected-cell fractions. Processing of P1 appeared to require cleavage of the P1-P2 bond. These results support our previous data that 2A is the second polioviral proteinase and also provides a means of assaying proteinase 2A in vitro.\r"

At high fields, sufficiently large circular forms are prevented from migrating into the gel whereas linear molecules and smaller circular DNAs migrate normally. This effect is strongly field dependent, affecting circular molecules of decreasing size with increasing field strength. We have studied this effect with a series of plasmid DNAs ranging from 2.9 to 56 kilobase pairs using continuous and reversing-pulse electric fields. Application of reversing pulses abolishes the effect under certain conditions and supports the model for the gel electrophoresis of open-circular DNA where circular forms are trapped by engaging the free end of an agarose gel fiber.\r"

  ".U": "87231950\r", 
  ".W": "Myosin from a molluscan catch muscle is unusual in being phosphorylated in the rod by an endogenous heavy chain kinase. The overall structure of the molecule resembles that of other muscle myosins, although the tail is somewhat longer (approximately equal to 1700 A). At low ionic strength the unphosphorylated molecules associate in filaments that display a striking axial repeat of 145 A. Phosphorylation of the rod enhances myosin solubility in the range of NaCl between 0.05 and 0.15 M. Depending on the ionic strength and the counterions present, the soluble species corresponds to an antiparallel folded dimer (15 S) or to a folded monomer (10 S). Unphosphorylated myosin can also be partially solubilized into folded monomers by addition of ATP in 0.15 M NaCl. A similar molecular folding has also been observed in smooth muscle and nonmuscle myosins that depends, however, on the state of phosphorylation of the light chains in the myosin head. We discuss these results in relation to possible mechanisms for control of catch contraction.\r"

  ".W": "Expression of the subunit precursor of the human mitochondrial matrix enzyme ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTCase; EC 2.1.3.3) was programmed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae from a 2-micron plasmid by using an inducible galactose operon promoter. In the presence of the inducing sugar (galactose), two polypeptides were specifically precipitable with anti-OTCase antiserum: the human OTCase precursor (40 kDa); and the mature OTCase subunit (36 kDa). When yeast cells containing these species were lysed and fractionated, the OTCase precursor was found to be associated with mitochondrial membranes, while the mature subunit was found partly with mitochondrial membranes and partly in the soluble mitochondrial matrix-containing fraction. When OTCase enzymatic activity was assayed in fractions similarly derived from an S. cerevisiae strain devoid of yeast OTCase activity (an arg3 mutant) but expressing human OTCase, activity was detected specifically in the mitochondrial matrix fraction. A mutant human OTCase precursor containing an artificial mutation in the NH2-terminal leader peptide (arginine-23 to glycine) was similarly examined. As was previously observed with mammalian mitochondria, this precursor failed both to reach the matrix compartment and to be proteolytically processed; it also failed to exhibit OTCase enzymatic activity. Presence of OTCase enzymatic activity in an arg3 strain expressing wild-type precursor was utilized to obtain selective growth in a medium devoid of arginine but supplemented with the OTCase substrate ornithine. We conclude that, during evolution, the pathway of mitochondrial import utilized by the human OTCase precursor is conserved between yeast and humans, and that, by using selective growth conditions, it may be possible to examine genetically this pathway in S. cerevisiae.\r"

No phenotypic effects of the mutation in SSD1 were detected. However, a functional SSC1 gene is essential for vegetative growth.

In addition, Weigle mutagenesis of preirradiated lambda phage was also measured. In all cases, no increase in mutagenesis was noted at the restrictive temperature for DNA polymerase III. Introduction of a cloned DNA polymerase III gene returned the mutation rate of the bacterial genome as well as the Weigle mutagenesis to normal at 43 degrees C. Using a recA-lacZ fusion, the SOS response after UV irradiation was measured and found to be normal at the restrictive and permissive temperature for DNA polymerase III, as was induction of lambda prophage. Recombination was also normal at either temperature. Our studies demonstrate that a functional DNA polymerase III is strictly required for mutagenesis at a step other than SOS induction.\r"

Immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled membranes from an activated T-cell line showed that the MLR3-binding molecule has a molecular size of 28-34 kDa. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that the appearance of the MLR3 antigen is an early event and precedes that of the interleukin 2 receptor both in T lymphocytes and thymocytes. The proliferative response of resting T cells to OKT3-Sepharose and interleukin 1 or accessory cells, but not the interleukin 2-dependent proliferation, was inhibited by the addition of MLR3 monoclonal antibodies. Similar results wer also obtained in an interleukin 1-dependent human thymocyte proliferation assay. In addition when MLR3-positive cells were cultured with purified interleukin 1, MLR3 surface antigen expression was not observed. Thus MLR3 monoclonal antibody appears to recognize an antigen involved in an early step of T-cell activation related to interleukin 1-dependent functions and on both T lymphocytes and thymocytes.\r"

  ".U": "87231989\r", 
  ".W": "The capacity of blood (trypomastigote) forms of Trypanosoma cruzi to infect mouse peritoneal macrophages or rat heart myoblasts in vitro was inhibited by treatment of the trypomastigotes with DL-alpha-difluoromethylarginine (F2Me Arg), monofluoromethylagmatine, or (E)-alpha-monofluoromethyl-3-4-dehydroarginine--all irreversible inhibitors of arginine decarboxylase. Similar results were obtained when F2MeArg-treated parasites were incubated with rat heart myoblasts. The inhibitory effects were characterized by marked reductions in both the proportion of infected cells and the number of parasites per 100 host cells. The concentrations of the arginine decarboxylase inhibitors that affected infectivity had no detectable effect on either the concentration or motility of the parasite and, therefore, could not have affected the collision frequency. F2MeArg appeared to inhibit the ability of T. cruzi to penetrate the host cells since the drug had no significant effect on the extent of parasite binding to the surface of the host cells. The inhibitory effect of F2MeArg was markedly reduced or abrogated in the presence of either agmatine or putrescine, as would have been expected if F2MeArg acted by inhibiting arginine decarboxylase. Addition of F2MeArg to macrophage or myoblast cultures immediately after infection or at a time when virtually all of the intracellular parasites had transformed into the multiplicative amastigote form, resulted in a markedly reduced parasite growth rate. This effect was also prevented by exogenous agmatine. These results indicate the importance of polyamines and polyamine biosynthesis in the following two important functions of T. cruzi: invasion of host cells and intracellular multiplication. Furthermore, concentrations of the inhibitors tested that affected the parasite did not alter the viability of the host cells, the cellular density of the cultures, or the ability of uninfected myoblasts to grow. Thus, arginine decarboxylase inhibitors may have a potential application in chemotherapy against T. cruzi infection.\r"

Viral particles from standard K1 and K2 killer strains were used to inoculate sensitive cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, rendered competent by spheroplasting, lithium acetate treatment, or by natural mating. Extracellular transmission of the killer viruses was judged by the following criteria and controls. Filter-sterilized virus inocula were shown to be free of viable yeast cells, and host cells treated in the absence of added virus did not yield killer progeny. Infected clones originating from spheroplasts or lithium acetate-treated cells were shown to possess the genotype of the host strain and the killer phenotype of the infecting virus. Infected clones derived from complementary mating pairs were found to be wild-type diploids, whose meiotic segregants exhibited 2:2 segregation for unlinked nutritional markers and 4:0 segregation for the killer phenotype. This technique is generally applicable to the study of interactions between yeast viruses and different hosts and suggests that extracellular transmission may be a natural route for the inheritance and dissemination of mycoviruses.\r"

Exposure of the tectum to the active isomer of APV produces desegregation of the RGC terminals without blocking electrical activity in the afferents or altering their terminal arbor morphology. Exposure to the inactive isomer of APV causes no perturbation of the normal stripe pattern. APV-induced desegregation is completely reversible within 2 weeks of removal of the APV. In addition, exposure of the optic tectum to NMDA results in stripes with sharper borders and fewer forks and fusions than untreated animals. These results suggest that the NMDA receptor/channel plays a role in eye-specific segregation in the three-eyed tadpole.\r"

Included in the 15 transfers were 3 scapular free flaps, 11 latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flaps, and 1 groin flap. Thirteen of the patients in this group were refitted with prostheses following reconstruction and did well with no pain or skin breakdown of the resurfaced stumps. The follow-up period on these patients averaged 16 months. One patient, in whom the flap succeeded, underwent stump soft-tissue revision and myodesis. One patient, in whom the flap failed, continued to develop recurrent ulceration in his stump. This clinical experience followed an extensive laboratory study of 12 above-knee amputation patients using noninvasive Doppler ultrasound measurements to determine weight-loading and interface-pressure distribution between the stump and the socket of the prostheses and their relation to stump length and circumference.\r"

The flaps employed include one latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap, two latissimus dorsi muscle-skin graft flaps, one groin flap, and one foot-fillet flap. All five flaps survived; one patient required early venous anastomosis reexploration and revision. The patients have been followed for a mean duration of 5.5 years (range 3 to 8 years). The mean duration to first ambulation with a prosthesis was 3.6 months (range 2 to 7 months). Four of the five patients developed ulcerations on or adjacent to their flaps which required surgical revision. The patients required a mean of 1.28 prosthesis changes annually since surgery. The functional motion (mean active knee motion is 100 degrees) and ligamentous stability of the knee joints were well preserved in all patients. Five patients wear patella tendon-bearing prostheses, with one requiring an additional thigh corset. In two of the patients, nerve anastomoses to their flaps were performed. Both patients developed true cutaneous sensibility, but nevertheless experienced flap ulceration. All the patients are fully ambulatory on their free flaps. Free-tissue transfer can assist in preserving traumatic below-knee amputations so that patients can benefit from the functional advantage of a below-knee prosthetic device.\r"

Endosonography appears to be promising for evaluating preoperatively the local extent of rectal carcinoma. CT is being challenged by MR imaging as the most sensitive modality for detecting liver metastases, but CT currently remains the technique of choice for evaluating recurrent disease and its extent. The diversity of available modalities will ensure that the radiologist remains at the forefront in the clinical investigation of colorectal carcinoma.\r"

The most serious complication of BAE is spinal cord ischemia. This relates directly to the potential anastomotic connections between the bronchial circulation and the anterior spinal artery. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) have been used in the past to monitor spinal cord ischemia during procedures that threaten the vascularity of the spinal cord. The authors report two cases in which SSEPs were employed to monitor spinal cord ischemia during bronchial artery embolization.\r"

The second prosthesis, a stainless steel fatigued helix encased in a siliconized shield, was used to band the main pulmonary artery in two dogs and the descending aorta in two. After a mean duration of 89 days the bands were dilated with an intraluminal balloon dilator at 6 atm (608 kPa) of pressure for 30 seconds. In all 15 experiments the bands dilated and the gradient at the band was reduced. The stainless steel helix was more successful and has technical advantages for clinical application.\r"

Angiography generally showed tumor vascularity, sometimes with a spoke-wheel pattern. Suggestion of tumor nodularity or lobulation on sonography or computed tomography (CT) correlated with the gross appearance. The tumor was usually echogenic and occasionally had small hypoechoic or anechoic areas representing necrosis or hemorrhage. On CT it was usually hypodense, with minimal if any enhancement. The calcification pattern and demonstration of tumor lobulation with septation may help differentiate hepatoblastoma from other liver neoplasms in infants and children under 5 years of age.\r"

One intraabdominal testis was not seen. Testis-fat contrast at 0.35 T was optimal with a short repetition time (TR) and a short echo time (TE). At 1.5 T, good contrast was achieved with short TR/TE sequences, but the contrast was even more pronounced with even longer TR/TE parameters. In seven patients with unilateral undescended testes, the undescended and contralateral testes showed symmetrical tissue signal intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images. In three, the undescended testis was of lower signal intensity, suggesting atrophy. MR imaging promises to become an important diagnostic tool in the detection of undescended testes.\r"

Interferons are induced by exposure to viruses and double-stranded RNA, and one class, gamma interferon, is a lymphokine produced after a mitogenic or antigenic stimulus. The genes for human alpha, beta, and gamma interferons have been cloned and sequenced, and some have been expressed. When given parenterally to humans, interferons cause signs and symptoms such as fever, tachycardia, and malaise, and they may well be responsible for symptoms of this sort in viral infections. Preparations of natural and recombinant alpha interferon have been shown to be active in prophylaxis and treatment of certain viral infections.\r"

Advanced age is accompanied by many physiologic alterations that may have secondary effects on absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of drugs. Information on absorption and metabolism in the elderly is scarce and conflicting. Because renal excretion of penicillins and cephalosporins decreases with the physiologic signs of the kidneys, dose reduction is advisable in elderly patients. Monitoring of serum drug levels is recommended for the selection of correct dosages of renally eliminated antibiotics with a narrow therapeutic range--e.g., aminoglycosides and vancomycin. There is a considerable need for additional studies of the influence of age on the kinetics of antimicrobial agents.\r"

In addition, reports of disease due to species generally considered saprophytic have become more numerous. In this review, the epidemiologic, pathologic, and clinical features of the individual MOTT species are discussed.

Antimicrobial agents active against anaerobic flora reduce colonization resistance, permitting colonization by and overgrowth of potentially pathogenic microorganisms and possibly leading to infections with resistant microorganisms. A distinction can be made between antimicrobial agents that reduce colonization resistance and those that leave it intact by examining the effect of antimicrobial agents on aerobic intestinal flora of mice and humans.\r"

Thirty-eight patients had congenital immunodeficiencies, most frequently X-linked agammaglobulinemia. Most patients who could be assessed were receiving maintenance therapy with intramuscular gamma-globulin before their enteroviral infection. Seven patients had not been recognized as hypogammaglobulinemic before the onset of infection. The commonest pathogens were echoviruses (37 of 41 cases), especially type 11 (11 cases). Thus far, four patients have had sequential or simultaneous infections with a second enteroviral serotype. Other features of the disease have included weakness, lethargy or coma, headaches, hearing loss, seizures, ataxia, and paresthesias. Some patients have also had nonneurologic manifestations of chronic enteroviral infection, including fever, the dermatomyositis-like syndrome, edema, rashes, and hepatitis. Treatment has consisted primarily of antibody administration, either in intravenous immunoglobulin preparations or in immune plasma. Twelve patients have received intraventricular immunoglobulin through reservoir devices; six of these 12 have improved substantially, as judged by clinical criteria.\r"

In some transposons the terminal inverted repeat sequences are capable of independent movement and are called insertion sequences. Transposons carry a gene that encodes transposase(s), the enzyme(s) responsible for recombination of the transposon into another DNA molecule.

  ".W": "A case of recurrent, disseminated sporotrichosis in a renal transplant recipient is reported in which two joints, the skin, and the central nervous system were involved. The disease recurred both eight months and three years after the initial treatment with amphotericin B. The second course of therapy with amphotericin B required systemic and intraarticular administration of the drug. The third course of therapy included systemic and intrathecal administration. The function of the cadaveric transplanted kidney was maintained throughout the first recurrence of disease by careful reduction of immunosuppressive therapy and attention to the level of antifungal therapy. The kidney could not be salvaged after the second recurrence because of continued amphotericin B nephrotoxicity; however, the patient was cured of his infection. Sporothrix (Sporotrichum) schenckii may be a difficult organism to eradicate in chronically immunosuppressed patients, but the disease it causes may be successfully treated with aggressive systemic therapy.\r"

The duration of illness ranged from two to six days, and the outcome was uniformly fatal. This rare but distinct entity resembles clostridial myonecrosis except that it lasts slightly longer and does not involve gaseous crepitus. A definitive diagnosis of myonecrosi scan be established by surgical exploration; early, radical debridement plus penicillin therapy should be undertaken after diagnosis in an attempt to alter the usual devastating outcome.\r"

Thus, it is extremely difficult to identify a clear relation between minimal inhibitory concentrations and clinical outcome. The situation appears more readily resolvable for yeast-like than for filamentous fungi since the former are more easily quantified by standardized microbiologic techniques. Accordingly the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards has initiated the process of developing standards for yeast susceptibility testing. A related issue concerns the measurement of antifungal agents in body fluids. Whereas there may be little value in measuring concentrations of amphotericin B (because of its predictable pharmacokinetics), there is value to measuring levels of flucytosine (serum concentrations may relate to bone marrow suppression and/or the development of drug resistance) and ketoconazole (which may be absorbed unpredictably from the gut). Laboratory standards for these measurements have not been established.\r"

Dissociation treatment destroys the labile antigen, leaving in doubt whether any is antibody bound. Dissociation steps have also been necessary for detection of Aspergillus fumigatus antigen in sera from patients with invasive aspergillosis. Concentrations of the stable antigens of both Candida and Aspergillus appear to be in the nanogram-per-milliliter range, generally lying at the limits of detection by conventional assays. Improvements in sensitivity and practicality are needed, but the tests are clearly promising.\r"

Candidiasis and aspergillosis are common in these patients, and numerous attempts have been made to evaluate potential prophylactic methods. Despite the fact that various agents (polyenes and/or imidazoles) and various formulations have been tested, the reported data on their effectiveness are still controversial. No single regimen can be recommended at this time for prevention of invasive candidiasis. The potential emergence of fungal strains resistant to the polyenes and the selection of Torulopsis glabrata by the imidazoles should also be taken into consideration. Aspergillosis, which is an airborne infection, may be prevented by isolation of patients at risk in rooms equipped with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters. In addition, the prophylactic administration of nasal sprays of amphotericin B has shown encouraging results, and this approach should be further investigated.\r"

In previous studies with en bloc heart-lung transplantation in dogs, we found altered regulation of breathing-abolition of Hering-Breuer reflex and response to hypercapnia inhalation stimulus consisting of augmented tidal volume with no change in respiratory rate-shortly after the operation. The long-term effects of pulmonary denervation on breathing regulation were now studied in dogs after staged bilateral pulmonary autotransplantation. Mechanical and electrical activities of the respiratory muscles were recorded during spontaneous breathing and after deflation and inflation with varying volumes of air. Five months postoperatively the duration of the respiratory cycle increased 2.5 times on inflation with 600 ml of air and occlusion of the airways, compared with tenfold prolongation in intact control dogs, indicating a partial return of the Hering-Breuer reflex after the autotransplantation. The duration of the EMG bursts in respiratory muscles increased in intact dogs and in those with bilateral lung autotransplants. In impulse frequency the response to stretching was less evident after autotransplantation. The mechanism mediating reappearance of Hering-Breuer reflex warrants further study.\r"

These sequences are modular in nature, consisting of arrays of short (10- to 12-base pair) recognition elements that interact with specific transcription factors. Some transcription factors have been extensively purified and the corresponding genes have been cloned, but the mechanisms by which they promote transcription are not yet understood. Positive and negative regulatory elements that function only in specific cell types or in response to extracellular inducers have been identified. A number of cases of inducible and tissue-specific gene expression involve the activation of preexisting transcription factors, rather than the synthesis of new proteins. This activation may involve covalent modification of the protein or an allosteric change in its structure. The modification of regulatory proteins may play a central role in the mechanisms of eukaryotic gene regulation.\r"

Homeotic genes share a characteristic DNA segment, the homeo box, which encodes a defined domain of the homeotic proteins. The homeo domain seems to mediate the binding to specific DNA sequences, whereby the homeotic proteins exert a gene regulatory function. By isolating the normal Antennapedia gene, fusing its protein-coding sequences to an inducible promoter, and reintroducing this fusion gene into the germline of flies, it has been possible to transform head structures into thoracic structures and to alter the body plan in a predicted way. Sequence homologies suggest that similar genetic mechanisms may control development in higher organisms.\r"

Environmental stimuli alter steady-state levels of messenger RNA species encoding neurotransmitters, thereby altering synaptic, neuronal, and network function over time. External or internal stimuli alter impulse activity, which alters membrane depolarization and selectively changes the expression of specific transmitter genes. These processes occur in diverse peripheral and central neurons, suggesting that information storage is widespread in the neuraxis. The temporal profile of any particular molecular mnemonic process is determined by specific kinetics of turnover and by the geometry of the neuron resulting in axonal transport of molecules to different synaptic arrays at different times. Generally, transmitters, the agents of millisecond-to-millisecond communication, are subject to relatively long-lasting changes in expression, ensuring that ongoing physiological function is translated into information storage.\r"

This study also shows that a patient with solid cell or undifferentiated carcinoma of the thyroid might live as long as 17 years after operation. Twenty-three patients in this series had had previous operations, 13 of which were for malignancy of the thyroid. Of these 13 patients, four died of carcinoma of the thyroid. Three had had lobectomy, two for papillary carcinoma and one for follicular carcinoma, and one had had subtotal thyroidectomy for undifferentiated carcinoma. Early and complete resection of thyroid carcinoma is indicated because this disease can be fatal, even after long survivals, multiple foci of malignancy may be present in 27% of cases, the disease can recur in the contralateral lobe after previous lobectomy, death can occur even after secondary operation, and careful surgical treatment can yield an uneventful total thyroidectomy.\r"

Osler's nodes are helpful clues if they appear in patients with infective endocarditis, and biopsy and culture of the lesion may provide an etiologic diagnosis.\r"

  ".U": "87234624\r", 
  ".W": "A prospective study was carried out on the results of chemonucleolysis or surgery in 156 patients who had lumbar disc herniations. All patients were considered as potentially good candidates for chemonucleolysis. Seventy-two received a chymopapain injection and 84 underwent surgery. Based on computerized tomography (CT) scan and/or myelography the herniations were distinguished as small, medium, and large. Also distinguished were three types of preoperative clinical patterns, Type A, Type B and Type C, corresponding to slight, moderate, and severe nerve root compression, respectively. Follow-up evaluations were made 1 month, 3 months, and an average of 2.8 years after treatment. The patients with a small disc herniation, who underwent chemonucleolysis, did slightly better as a group than those treated surgically. At 1 month, the proportions of satisfactory results were 75% in the chemonucleolysis group and 62% in the surgery series. At final follow-up, the proportions were 84% and 82%, respectively, but the ratio of excellent-to-good results was higher in the chemonucleolysis group. In the latter, most patients with satisfactory outcomes had a Type A or Type B clinical pattern. In medium-size herniations the results of surgery were slightly better than those of chemonucleolysis. At 1 month, 55% of patients in the chemonucleolysis group had satisfactory results compared with 74% of those in the surgery series; at final follow-up the proportions were, respectively, 76% and 86%. In the chemonucleolysis group most satisfactory outcomes were found in patients with a Type A or Type B clinical pattern. The results of chemonucleolysis in patients who had large herniations were significantly inferior to those of surgery: at final follow-up the results were satisfactory in 50% of patients in the chemonucleolysis group and 89% of those in the surgery series. Chemonucleolysis appears to be the treatment of choice in most patients with small disc herniations and an effective alternative to surgery in most patients with medium-size herniations when the preoperative clinical pattern indicates a slight or moderate nerve root compression. In all large herniations and in small- or medium-size herniations causing a severe nerve root impingement, surgery should be preferred to chemonucleolysis.\r"

A variety of anterior and posterior procedures with and without instrumentation were performed. The percentage of successful arthrodesis was 87 in those who received autogenous bone, and 86.6 in those who received allograft bone. Thirty-four spinal fusions were surgically explored. Histologic evaluation of the bone taken at the time of surgical exploration showed viable osteocytes laying down osteoid, woven and lamellar bone, and no inflammatory or foreign body reaction. The authors conclude that cryopreserved bone, harvested and processed as described, is advantageous, safe, and results in a rate of bone union comparable to that of autogenous bone.\r"

Both groups received the same bilateral lumbar laminectomy and disc excision by the same surgeon. One group had the addition of an intertransverse fusion with internal fixation. Both groups were studied by an independent examiner at an average of 3 years postoperatively for success rate as determined by activity level, medication, subjective and objective evaluation. Both groups had similar age, sex, and occupational characteristics. No patient had prior surgical treatment or chemonucleolysis. Patients with associated lumbar spine problems such as stenosis, instability, or spondylolisthesis were excluded. Each patient had a positive clinical picture for a herniated lumbar disc, as well as a positive myelogram, venogram or computerized tomographic scan. Most had positive electromyograms. All patients received at least 3 months of conservative care. The 38 patients with fusion had a significantly longer mean time to return to work after surgery versus the 31 patients without fusion. Although the general success rate of both groups was 87%, the best results were in the nonfusion group. A total of 29% of nonfusions had excellent results whereas only 11% of the fusion group had excellent results. The conclusion is that fusions are not necessary and give less excellent results in simple laminectomy cases for herniated lumbar disc.\r"

  ".W": "Small intestinal obstruction remains a frequently encountered problem in abdominal surgery. Although modern day surgical management continues to focus appropriately on avoiding operative delay whenever surgery is indicated, not every patient is always best served by immediate operation. Certain entities, such as SBO secondary to incarcerated abdominal wall hernia, and patients with clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of strangulation do require prompt operative intervention. Other conditions, however, such as postoperative adhesions and neoplastic-associated SBO, particularly in patients with numerous previous abdominal procedures, concomitant medical problems, or incomplete or partial obstruction, often justifiably benefit by a trial of nonoperative management. The risk of strangulation with adhesive and neoplastic SBO is relatively low as compared with incarcerated hernia and small bowel volvulus. Close and careful clinical evaluation, in conjunction with laboratory and radiologic studies, will usually dictate the proper course of management in any given case. If any uncertainty exists, prompt operative intervention is indicated. Because over 50 per cent of all cases of SBO are the direct result of postoperative adhesions, it is probably just as important as the actual management of SBO for all practicing abdominal surgeon to familiarize themselves with the widely accepted \"ischemic theory\" of adhesion formation. A number of intraoperative measures, many of which go against established surgical principles, are now encouraged during routine elective abdominal surgery to reduce the incidence of detrimental adhesions that might subsequently produce SBO. At the same time, surgeons should continue their aggressive attitude towards elective repair of any and all abdominal hernias, which continue to account for close to 15 per cent of all cases of small intestinal obstruction and still remain the most common cause of strangulation.\r"

We have studied 40 patients who required antibiotic prophylaxis prior to surgical treatment randomizing and stratifying them according to age and type of operation, to receive either latamoxef or piperacillin. Five hematologic parameters were studied, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, plasma factor II concentration, plasma factor VII concentration and platelet count. Minor differences were noted with latamoxef producing mild persistant elevation of prothrombin time (0.7 second) associated with depression of factor II and factor VII. In our study, we found that, when used as three dose, single agent prophylaxis, there was no difference between latamoxef and piperacillin in producing clinical disturbances of hemostasis. However, attention is drawn to the importance of recognizing that hemostatic disturbances can occur after the use of broad spectrum antibiotics as prophylaxis for surgical treatment Mechanisms of hemostatic disorders are reviewed and alternative hypotheses are suggested.\r"

One of these rejected an allograft done at our institution with cyclosporine and prednisone and was included a second time in this series when a fourth allograft was received. Nine of 19 allografts were successfully transplanted. Average follow-up time was 39 months. Eight allografts were rejected. One graft was lost to technical complications. In one instance, the recipient died with a functioning graft. Duration of function of previous allografts was not found to be a critical determinant of third or fourth graft survival. Human leukocyte antigen matching was not a statistically significant determinant. Panel reactive antibody was higher in those who rejected the third or fourth allograft, but not with statistical significance. Recipients with the blood type A were less likely to enjoy successful third or fourth cadaver renal transplantation.

Surgical principles have not materially changed over the years and antibiotics are not indicated merely to cover breaks in the operative technique. One must always be cautious of possible untoward reactions and complications. This may be another example of the principle--less is more.\r"

The sensitivity of this technique in detecting metastatic liver lesions (97.8%) was significantly superior (p less than 0.01) to that of preoperative ultrasound (41.3%), computed tomography (47.8%), and surgical exploration (58.7%), while the specificity of each test was comparable (approximately 90%). High-resolution intraoperative ultrasonography is safe, simple to perform and more accurate than preoperative imaging and surgical exploratory methods. Therefore its use is encouraged during colorectal cancer surgery for screening of liver metastases.\r"

At the initial examination, the subjects reported on the presence of breast pain, the degree to which pain affects daily activities, the frequency of pain, the degree of pain associated with breast examinations, and the degree of pain associated with close-fitting clothing. Subjects were then examined and the four quadrants of each breast were rated on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = normal, fatty tissue, 1 = little seedy bumps or fine nodularity, 2 = discrete nodules or ropy tissue, 3 = confluent areas, hard or soft masses). Subjects in all three groups returned for 2- and 4-month follow-up examinations. Total nodularity scores, degree of pain/tenderness, and compliance with dietary restrictions were analyzed. The data showed that decreased caffeine consumption did not result in a significant reduction of palpable breast nodules or in a lessening of breast pain/tenderness.\r"

In these patients, transthoracic esophagectomy was performed, and the whole stomach was used for reconstruction in the right side of the chest. No complications due to the pyloroplasty developed in any of the patients who underwent this procedure. Gastric emptying tests that were performed at the sixth postoperative month in 37 patients demonstrated a prolongation of emptying time in the control group (p less than 0.01). The patients' symptoms, however, did not correlate well with gastric emptying time. Follow-up assessment showed that a higher proportion of patients who did not undergo pyloroplasty suffered from symptoms of incomplete emptying while eating, but the difference was not statistically significant. Moreover, the proportion of patients who were free of postoperative symptoms gradually increased in both groups and reached 100% in the study group and 89% in the control group at 2 years. In the control group, two of the three patients with prolonged gastric emptying time complained of persistent regurgitation and distending discomfort after meals (18 and 24 months after surgery). They were the only two patients who might have benefited from a drainage procedure at the initial operation. Since there apparently were no reliable operative criteria by which to identify patients who might require drainage, and since the risk associated with pyloroplasty was negligible, it would seem reasonable to perform a pyloroplasty on every patient in whom the whole stomach was used for reconstruction after esophagectomy. This procedure would benefit the few patients who might manifest symptomatic gastric stasis.\r"

  ".W": "A device capable of quantitative measurement of intestinal ischemic damage has been designed. The device is called the electrical contractility meter and employs a clip-on strain gauge transducer that delivers a precisely controlled electrical stimulus to the bowel. Threshold stimulus level (TSL) is the stimulus current in milliamperes (mA) that is necessary to produce a clearly defined smooth-muscle contraction. In 30 dogs, TSL was used to establish viability boundaries in 40 cm ischemic bowel segments. Bowel viability was assessed with the use of TSL in comparison with gross features (color, peristalsis) and blood flow measured by means of Doppler ultrasound at 2 cm intervals in the ischemic small-bowel segments. The TSL scale ranges to 100 mA and varied from a low of 22 +/- 2 mA in normal bowel outside the ischemic segment to 97 +/- 4 mA in grossly gangrenous bowel. There was a consistent correlation between rising TSL and worsening bowel color, disappearance of visible peristalsis, and progressive disappearance of audible Doppler signals. Resection and anastomosis were performed in three groups of 10 dogs at TSL measurements of 30 mA, 40 mA, and 50 mA, respectively. Dogs were killed and anastomoses were inspected on the tenth postoperative day. There were no leaks at TSL = 30 mA, one leak at TSL = 40 mA, and four leaks at TSL = 50 mA. The number of leaks at TSL = 50 mA was significantly greater than at TSL = 30 mA (p less than 0.04, Fisher's exact test). These results show that the quantitative myoelectric parameters established by this device provide a reliable in vivo assessment of bowel viability. The electrical contractility meter is easy to use and may have clinical applicability.\r"

  ".W": "Tc-99m galactosyl-neoglycoalbumin (Tc-NGA) is a new liver-imaging agent which binds to hepatic binding protein (an hepatocyte-specific membrane receptor). This study evaluated the sensitivity of Tc-NGA kinetics and imaging anatomy to pathologic states that are encountered after liver transplantation. Studies were performed in adolescent pigs under control conditions (18 studies), and after orthotopic liver transplantation (nine studies), common bile duct ligation (three studies), hepatic artery ligation (one study), and hepatic resection (two studies). Anatomic and kinetic data were analyzed. Excellent liver images and minimal kinetic changes were noted after common bile duct ligation. Marked imaging defects and major kinetic alterations were observed after hepatic artery ligation and in the presence of preservation injury. Marked depression in hepatic Tc-NGA uptake was observed during acute rejection. Minor alterations in Tc-NGA kinetics were noted after a 25% hepatectomy. These studies indicate that minimal changes in Tc-NGA uptake occur after common bile duct ligation; Tc-NGA uptake is markedly sensitive to hepatic ischemia; decreased Tc-NGA uptake occurs during acute rejection; and hepatic infarcts are demonstrated promptly after preservation injury. Thus Tc-NGA imaging provides a novel means of evaluating hepatic ischemia, hepatic preservation, and hepatic allograft rejection. Tc-NGA imaging may also provide a means of evaluating hepatic regeneration and hepatocyte retrodifferentiation during regeneration.\r"

Documented enzymatic activation of the trypsinogen/chymotrypsinogen, which is not present in symptom-free control patients, was thus thought to be responsible for these symptoms. Conversion to enteric drainage by means of a Roux-en-Y loop resulted in resolution of both symptoms and urinary enzymatic activation. Recurrent urinary tract infections were thought to be the most likely mechanism responsible for these findings.\r"

It has been compared with currently used postural drainage techniques. Three treatment regimens were compared in 18 patients with cystic fibrosis. Treatment A consisted of breathing exercises emphasising inspiration, interspersed with the forced expiration technique in gravity assisted positions; treatment B comprised breathing exercises with positive expiratory pressure alternating with the forced expiration technique in the same gravity assisted positions; and treatment C comprised breathing exercises with positive expiratory pressure and the forced expiration technique in the sitting position. During treatment A a significantly greater quantity of sputum was produced than during treatments B and C (p less than 0.025 and p less than 0.001 respectively). Treatment B produced more sputum than treatment C (p less than 0.005). There were no significant differences in arterial oxygen saturation, FEV1 or forced vital capacity. Most adolescent and adult patients are able to carry out their treatment independently using gravity assisted positions, breathing exercises emphasising inspiration, and the forced expiration technique. Sputum clearance was less effective when positive expiratory pressure was included in the treatment regimen.\r"

Double placebo inhalers were used in a randomised crossover fashion during two four week treatment periods. Mean peak expiratory flow (PEF), mean symptom scores, and number of extra salbutamol inhalations required were not significantly different between the two treatment periods. Local side effects were more common during treatment with the four times daily active preparation; overt oropharyngeal candidiasis, however, was not found in either group during the study. On completion of the crossover study patients were transferred to the twice daily regimen. At the three month follow up all patients had remained stable and the outpatient PEF was significantly higher (mean 382 (SD 26)l min-1) than at entry into the trial (mean 345 (24)l min-1) (p less than 0.05). Twice daily beclomethasone administered by a concentrated aerosol inhaler appears to be as effective as the standard four times daily regimen in controlling stable asthma.\r"

  ".W": "At present there is no satisfactory technique for repeated lung biopsy in recipients of heart-lung transplants. A new technique for lung biopsy, which might be adopted for this purpose, has been developed. A Teflon sheath is inserted through the jugular vein into the pulmonary artery with the aid of a balloon catheter. A flexible biopsy forceps is then introduced through the sheath into the pulmonary arterial tree and advanced into the periphery of the lung, where biopsy samples are taken. The procedure was attempted in 14 pigs. Initially crocodile jaw (two pigs) and fenestrated cups forceps (five pigs), which are currently in use for transbronchial lung biopsy, were used. Subsequently the biopsy forceps was modified and the jaws were replaced by a cutting needle mechanism (six pigs). Out of the 13 animals in which the procedure was technically possible, lung parenchyma was obtained from nine and pulmonary arterial wall from 11. One animal died shortly after the procedure. The cause of death could not be determined with certainty at postmortem examination. There was, however, a small tear on the surface of the lung, which could have produced a tension pneumothorax. The other 12 animals recovered from the procedure. They were killed 24 hours later and postmortem examination was carried out. One animal in which the crocodile jaw forceps had been used had a haematoma in the lower lobe (3 X 3 X 4 cm) and 100 ml of blood in the pleural cavity. In the other 11 animals, in which the fenestrated cups or the cutting needle forceps had been used, the intrapulmonary haematomas were 1-2 cm in diameter and the pleural surface was intact. It is concluded therefore that transvenous lung biopsy is feasible and that this procedure might find an application in monitoring rejection in recipients of heart-lung transplants.\r"

Cortical somatosensory evoked response, [14C]iodoantipyrine autoradiographic blood flow, and 111In-labelled granulocyte accumulation were compared 4 hours after a 60-minute exposure to multifocal brain ischemia. Treatment with indomethacin, PGI2, and heparin eliminated neuron-disabling brain blood flows without altering early postischemic granulocyte accumulation. Granulocyte accumulation after 4 hours of reperfusion was not significantly different in control and treated dogs. The final amplitude of the cortical somatosensory evoked response in the treated group averaged 38.0 +/- 13.6% (mean +/- SEM) of the corresponding baseline value compared with 21.0 +/- 4.6% in the control group, but this difference was not significant.\r"

They had previously been randomized either to a diuretic treatment (n = 42), or a beta-blocking agent (n = 41). A 24-hour ambulatory Holter monitoring, and serum potassium, was obtained in all patients, serum magnesium was measured in 35 patients. The mean number of ventricular premature beats (VPBs) and the frequency of complex arrhythmias (19 vs. 5) was significantly higher in the diuretic group (p less than 0.01). The serum potassium was significantly lower (p less than 0.001) in the diuretic group, and there was a significant (p less than 0.005) inverse correlation between the number of VPBs and the serum potassium in all treated patients. The patients with complex arrhythmias were older (p less than 0.01) than the remainder of the patients. No correlation between serum magnesium and VPBs or complex arrhythmias was found. This study demonstrates increased frequency of VPBs in older hypertensive males, treated with diuretics, and that hypokalaemia predisposes to increased cardiac arrhythmias. We conclude that in older mildly hypertensive men hypokalaemia should be avoided.\r"

Noise stimulation caused a significant increase in blood pressure and resistance in the placebo-treated group, while cardiac output decreased significantly. Pretreatment for one month with the central alpha 2-adrenoceptor stimulating agent guanfacine did not block the noise-induced pressor response nor the increase in peripheral resistance. A significant decrease in stroke volume was observed and cardiac output also tended to decrease in this group. It could be concluded that loud noise is a potent pressor stimulus which causes vasoconstriction and that the blood pressure response during noise could not be blocked by the centrally acting antihypertensive agent guanfacine. Since noise causes vasoconstriction it also induces an increased tone in the small arteries and, if the noise stimulus is sufficiently strong and repeated for a long time, it might cause structural changes in the resistance vessels and permanent arterial hypertension in humans.\r"

  ".W": "We compared sorbitol given alone and as part of a mixed meal to nine insulin-dependent diabetics (IDD's) during continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). Blood glucose, sorbitol and breath hydrogen + methane were measured following six test meals: Pure glucose, sorbitol and lactulose, a mixed meal alone, and sweetened with sorbitol and sucrose. Blood glucose increase was very small after lactulose and sorbitol, significantly larger after glucose. A considerable increase in breath hydrogen + methane appeared after sorbitol and lactulose, but not after glucose. No differences in blood glucose responses were found after the mixed meal alone or sweetened with sorbitol and sucrose. A sustained low level increase in breath hydrogen + methane occurred after all solid meals. Sorbitol was not detected in serum after any meal. Conclusion: Sorbitol ingested by IDD's during CSII in watery solution is not absorbed in the small intestine and causes osmotic diarrhoea. Ingested in a composite meal it does not affect blood glucose and does not cause osmotic diarrhoea.\r"

  ".W": "The present study investigated the insulin and C-peptide secretory responses to glucagon in non-diabetic humans. Glucagon induced a transient increase in plasma insulin and C-peptide concentrations. At the dose level of 0.5 mg, glucagon elicited more efficient responses than at the dose level of 0.25 mg (p less than 0.05). However, the responses were not further potentiated by glucagon at 1.0 mg. Plasma glucose levels did not change during the first 2 min after glucagon injection, when already a marked increase in plasma insulin and C-peptide levels were observed. Thereafter, however, plasma glucose levels increased, to be maximal at 20 min after glucagon injection. Calculations of the minute-to-minute increase of plasma insulin and C-peptide levels revealed that plasma insulin levels increased by 32 +/- 7% of the increase in plasma C-peptide levels during the first 2 min, and by 36 +/- 6% of the increase in plasma C-peptide levels during the 3rd and 4th min after injection; the difference being the liver extraction of insulin. We conclude from this study in man that glucagon stimulates insulin secretion through both direct and indirect effects, that following glucagon injection, approximately 65% of the secreted insulin is extracted by the liver, and that the dose level of 0.5 mg glucagon is the optimal dose level for the stimulation of insulin secretion.\r"

In some of the women creatinine clearance changed more than 100% within a week from values below reference range to high normal levels. In all the women the creatinine clearance was higher during the luteal than during the follicular phase and correlated with the production of ovarian hormones. The urinary excretion rate of creatinine was highest during the luteal phase. Urinary volume, serum creatinine and serum water were not significantly influenced by the menstrual phases. An unexplained finding was a parallel change in the individual creatinine clearance and serum beta 2-microglobulin during the luteal, but not during the follicular phase. Our results suggest that ovarian hormones influence creatinine clearance during the menstrual cycle. One must therefore accept even considerable short-time variations in creatinine clearance in fertile women. It remains to be settled if these changes reflect true alterations in glomerular filtration rate or mainly changes in the urinary (tubular) excretion rate of creatinine.\r"

There was no significant difference in annual bone loss from the distal or proximal forearm between the groups. New vertebral fractures were evaluated, and in the treatment group, the annual increase in vertebral fractures was 0.18 +/- 0.387 and in the control group 0.13 +/- 0.330. New long bone fractures were 7 and 5, respectively. None of the observed differences were statistically significant. In the 1,25(OH)2D3 group, 28% had to reduce the dose because of slight hypercalcaemia. We conclude that 1,25(OH)2D3 as used in this study is not effective in the treatment of osteoporosis.\r"

Normalization of blood pressure was observed in 70% and in the remaining subjects the blood pressure was lower than at diagnosis. The blood pressure response to adrenalectomy appeared unpredictable in view of such parameters as the initial blood pressure, age at diagnosis, and duration of the hypertensive state. Toxicosis during pregnancy and metrorrhagia was observed with unexpectedly high frequency in this study population. Low ambulatory plasma renin activity was recorded at the follow-up in 15 out of 18 subjects studied in the absence of evidence of hyperaldosteronism.\r"

Diagnostic aspiration was performed with 20-gauge needles, and therapeutic and empyema drainages were performed by trocar technique with either a 7-French Sacks catheter or a specially designed empyema drainage catheter. Pneumothoraces were seen in 3% of the patients, and most of these were treated by the radiologist with placement of a Heimlich valve. We conclude that the use of sonography allows rapid localization of pleural fluid collections and instant monitoring of drainage of noninfected fluid collections and empyemas.\r"

The ability of sonography to detect renal stones before ESWL, changes in the calculi after ESWL, and the occurrence of pre- and post-ESWL hydronephrosis was evaluated. Abdominal radiographs and linear renal tomography were used as the standard of comparison. Six other patients had sonography only either before or after ESWL. One hundred patients had a total 105 kidneys treated; 18 kidneys with more than three stones were not included. The other 87 kidneys had 102 stones evaluated by sonography before having ESWL; 66 stones (65%) were identified and 36 were not. Of those calculi not seen, 10 were less than or equal to 5 mm in diameter. Nineteen of the other 26 stones were in the ureter or at the ureteropelvic junction. Comparison of sonograms of 80 kidneys obtained before and after ESWL revealed no change in 37 (46%), more stones or fragments detected in 23 (29%), fewer stones or a change in location in 12 (15%), and an apparent decrease in the size of the original stone in eight (10%). Hydronephrosis was detected by pre-ESWL sonography in 16 kidneys (20%) and was noted to develop after ESWL in 20 (31%) of the 64 other kidneys. These results indicate that the ability of sonography to detect renal calculi is related not only to stone size but also to location. The clinical significance of pre- and post-ESWL hydronephrosis found by sonography must be considered in conjunction with the patient's symptoms, laboratory data, and other radiographic studies. Therefore, the routine use of sonography in the post-ESWL patient does not seem warranted.\r"

Six cases of open spina bifida were detected through amniocentesis by elevation of alpha-fetoprotein and acetylcholinesterase levels.

Amniocentesis was 100% sensitive for diagnosis of open spina bifida, while sonography was only 50% sensitive.

The caliber of and the presence and direction of flow in the following veins are assessed: splenic, superior mesenteric, portal and intrahepatic portal, and portasystemic collateral. This examination can be performed on patients of any age without sedation and can establish the diagnosis of clinically significant portal hypertension. Technical success rate was 95%, although 10% of examinations were incomplete because of intestinal meteorism. We conclude that the combined use of Doppler and routine sonography permits precise evaluation of the vascular anatomy in portal venous hypertension.\r"

Fourteen patients were evaluated preoperatively, and 28 patients were evaluated after a variceal decompressive shunt. One patient was studied before and after undergoing a shunt. The direction of portal blood flow by Doppler sonography was compared with both the grading pattern and direction of flow by angiography. When portal blood flow was determined to be antegrade by Doppler sonography, angiography showed antegrade flow in 84% (grade I, II, or III portal venous pattern). Six percent had retrograde flow (grade IV), and 10% had portal vein thrombosis. When the portal blood flow was determined to be retrograde by Doppler sonography, angiography showed retrograde flow (grade IV portal venous pattern) in 80% and antegrade flow (grade I, II, or III) in 20%. When an inadequate Doppler tracing was obtained from the portal vein, angiography showed either grade I, II, or III in 38%; grade IV in 50%, and portal vein thrombosis in 13%. There was poor correlation between the calculated mean flow rates, as determined by Doppler sonography, and the angiographic grade. We conclude that pulsed Doppler sonography is accurate in determining the direction of portal flow when an adequate tracing is obtained (36 of 44 studies). When an inadequate tracing is obtained, retrograde portal flow or portal vein thrombosis is likely.\r"

In three patients with multiple subsegmental hepatic infarcts, most of the lesions were round or oval and centrally located. Only a minority of the lesions were wedge-shaped and peripheral. The early lesion appears hypoechoic on sonography, and CT shows a poorly demarcated low-density region. Later, lesions become confluent with more distinct margins. Bile lakes are a late sequela of large infarcts. Gas formation within sterile infarcts is newly described in two cases. Hepatic infarcts have a variable appearance on CT and sonography and are not reliably distinguished from other lesions such as abscess or necrotic neoplasm.\r"

Injections of the polysaccharide agent SHU-454 were made into the LV of five closed-chest dogs. Data were obtained at different levels of ejection fraction (EF) induced by pharmacologic or mechanical interventions and were documented by left ventriculography (VGRAM) in the right anterior oblique projection. Contrast echocardiography was recorded in the apical four-chamber view. The echocardiographic images were digitized off-line into a 256 X 256 pixel matrix with 256 gray levels/pixel. Two end-diastolic frames prior to contrast appearance were averaged to obtain a mask that was subtracted from end-diastolic contrast frames corresponding to the two beats of peak intensity. The same procedure was repeated for the systolic frames. LV edges from echocardiographic images prior to contrast appearance, from digitally subtracted echo-contrast images, and from VGRAM were traced on two occasions by two different observers. LV volumes were calculated by single-plane Simpson's rule and EF was derived by the classical equation. The intra- and interobserver reproducibility in the measurement of EF was excellent for VGRAM (r = 0.95 and 0.94, respectively), it was good for two-dimensional echocardiography (r = 0.87 and 0.73), and was fair for contrast-echo (r = 0.79 and 0.68).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The realization that a generalized increase in peripheral vascular resistance was the fundamental hemodynamic abnormality in essential hypertension and that the maintenance of arteriolar tone depended on the continuity of the adrenergic nervous system led to the alpha-adrenoceptor inhibitors being the first substances to receive serious consideration as antihypertensive agents. An agent that inhibited the effect of the adrenergic transmitter at the neuroeffector junction was anticipated to be ideal in inhibiting adrenergic vasoconductor tone. The clinical expectations for these compounds in the treatment of arterial hypertension, however, were not fulfilled. Although they lowered blood pressure, the effect was accompanied by unacceptable side effects such as tachycardia, and tolerance rapidly developed. The realization that transmitter norepinephrine modulates its own release through a prejunctionally located, alpha-adrenoceptor operated control mechanism explained several paradoxical phenomena and suggested exciting therapeutic possibilities. Most important, it provided a plausible if not compelling explanation for the clinical failure of the classic alpha-adrenoceptor inhibitors as antihypertensive agents. Characterization of the prejunctional and postjunctional effects of alpha agonists and antagonists led to the conclusion that prejunctional and postjunctional alpha adrenoceptors differed in receptor structure and led to the identification of prazosin as the first virtually specific alpha-adrenoceptor inhibitor. This was a crucially important step in the development of specific agents to combat adrenergic predominance in essential hypertension. Antihypertensive drugs like prazosin and doxazosin preserve feedback control of transmitter norepinephrine release, and consequently cause minimal reflex activation. They represent an alternative choice for therapy in all grades of hypertension with virtually no contra indicatons to their use.\r"

  ".W": "Recent advances in understanding the relation of risk factors to coronary artery disease (CAD) have initiated a change in the approach to managing the hypertensive patient. Reduction of elevated blood pressure still remains a major therapeutic priority. However, the risk of cardiovascular morbidity is also related to hypercholesterolemia, hyperuricemia, hyperglycemia, hyperfibrinogenemia and obesity; all aggravate the risk of CAD in the patient with high blood pressure. Life-style is also important: cigarette smoking, high alcohol consumption and lack of physical exercise all predispose to precocious atheromatous CAD. Thus, the most favorable prognosis in terms of reducing CAD risk is accomplished by reducing elevated systemic arterial pressure while simultaneously improving all other risk factors. The method by which blood pressure is lowered is an important consideration. The ancillary metabolic activities of antihypertensive drugs now available differ widely. Diuretics and beta blockers, for example, have potentially adverse metabolic effects, whereas agents such as selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor inhibitors appear to beneficially affect several metabolic cofactors influencing the CAD risk profile. The impact of such drug-induced metabolic changes on overall prognosis of the hypertensive patient remains to be clarified. In the absence of other contraindications, however, it is sensible to use drugs that do not increase the metabolic predilection to precocious CAD.\r"

In 1 large, multicenter study, 903 patients were evaluated: 408 patients received doxazosin; 323, active comparative agents (nadolol, metoprolol, prazosin or hydrochlorothiazide); and 172, placebo. In another smaller study doxazosin was compared with terazosin treatment. Doxazosin administered as monotherapy lowered blood pressure significantly when compared with baseline and the placebo-treated group. Doxazosin therapy resulted in substantial reductions from baseline readings for systolic and diastolic blood pressure in both the standing and supine positions; the effect of doxazosin was similar to that of the comparative drugs; however, unlike beta blockers, no significant change in heart rate was demonstrated. The effectiveness and safety of doxazosin are practically identical in young and elderly patients, as well as in blacks and whites. Doxazosin exhibited a favorable lipid profile and the reported side effects of doxazosin were comparable to those observed with placebo and other study drugs. Another multicenter trial reported that doxazosin therapy was effective at low doses; 76% of those responders achieved controlled blood pressure at a mean dosage of 3.3 mg daily.\r"

After an initial 2-week period (phase 1) during which eligibility to enter the study was determined (diastolic blood pressure [BP] of 95 to 114 mm Hg), all patients received doxazosin 1 to 8 mg once daily for 8 weeks (phase 2). Patients were then maintained for another 4 weeks on the dosage necessary to control diastolic BP to less than or equal to 90 mm Hg (phase 3). Efficacy and toleration of doxazosin therapy during the study period were good; 81% of evaluable patients (n = 180) achieved BP control with a once-daily mean dosage of 3.3 mg. At the end of phase 2 BPs were reduced by (systolic/diastolic) 23.8/17.3 (sitting) and 23.7/17.1 mm Hg (standing). Side effects were generally mild to moderate and either were tolerated or disappeared with continued therapy; 7 patients withdrew from the study because of intolerable side effects. Overall results demonstrated that doxazosin is suitable for treatment of mild to moderate hypertension and can be administered on a once-daily basis, which enhances compliance.\r"

Factors stimulating this trial are data documenting the high prevalence of mild hypertension in the adult population; mild hypertension's responsibility for a high proportion of morbidity and mortality attributable to hypertension overall; data from long-term hypertension intervention trials showing reduced morbidity and mortality of people with mild hypertension with use of either diuretics or beta blockers as step-1 therapy, and other trials that failed to demonstrate beneficial impact on morbidity and mortality, possibly due to residual questions concerning aspects of benefit to risk ratios with these medications; recent data from trials showing long-term control of mild hypertension and other risk factors by nutritional means; lack of data from long-term trials on benefit to risk ratios with newer drugs such as selective alpha 1 inhibitors, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers; paucity of data from trials on long-term combined effects of diet and drug therapy, and of diet alone, for people with mild hypertension. During the next few years, phase 1 of the trial will study 6 groups of drugs. The step-1 drugs are angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril), alpha 1 inhibitor (doxazosin), beta blocker (acebutolol), calcium channel blocker (amlodipine), diuretic (chlorthalidone) and placebo. All participants are to receive vigorous sustained nutritional counseling to reduce obesity, moderate sodium intake and avoid heavy use of alcohol. Key endpoints for phase 1 of the study are the need for additional medication to control mild hypertension, side effects (i.e., clinical and biochemical) and consequent need to discontinue drug and quality of life. Phase-1 data are to be used to complete the phase-2 design, with the ultimate aim to assess effects on morbidity and mortality.\r"

In a double-blind study, the new alpha 1-adrenoceptor inhibitor, doxazosin, was compared with atenolol for effects on the serum lipid profile. Ninety-six hypertensive patients were treated for up to 1 year with either doxazosin or atenolol once daily. There were statistically significant differences (p less than or equal to 0.01) between doxazosin and atenolol after 20 to 52 weeks of treatment in changes from baseline total triglyceride levels, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels and HDL/total cholesterol ratio. The percentage of change from baseline and the statistical significance of the difference between treatment groups were: total triglycerides, doxazosin -5.9%, atenolol +32.4% (p = 0.01); HDL cholesterol, doxazosin +7.2%, atenolol -5.6% (p = 0.007) and HDL/total cholesterol ratio: doxazosin +8.7%, atenolol -6.2% (p = 0.006). All mean changes were in favor of doxazosin therapy. In addition, doxazosin treatment beneficially decreased total serum cholesterol levels (-1.6%) compared with atenolol (+0.6%), although not to a significant degree. The differences were maintained in the cohort of 67 patients treated for a full year. The favorable change exerted by doxazosin on the lipid profile suggests that it may have a beneficial influence on the lipid risk factor. These results, together with the sustained decrease in blood pressure achieved for up to 1 year of therapy, suggest that doxazosin may reduce the risk of coronary artery disease in susceptible patients.\r"

Doxazosin produced clinically significant decreases in standing and supine blood pressures over a period of 1 year. These decreases were similar to those produced after an initial period of 12 weeks of double-blind therapy. The reductions in blood pressure produced by doxazosin were greater than those produced by prazosin. Minor and clinically nonsignificant changes in heart rate were observed with both drugs. The favorable changes from baseline in plasma lipid concentrations observed after 12 weeks of double-blind therapy were maintained throughout the 1-year open study. These were average increases in the mean high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration and the derived high density lipoprotein/total cholesterol ratio, and average decreases in total cholesterol and total triglyceride concentrations. The incidence of side effects reported was similar for doxazosin and prazosin. Most were rated as being mild or moderate in severity and were tolerated or disappeared with continued therapy. Results of laboratory tests, electrocardiograms, ophthalmoscopy and body weight measurements revealed only minor changes from baseline, and none was judged to be of clinical significance. These findings demonstrate that doxazosin is a safe and effective antihypertensive agent suitable for once-daily dosing, and has favorable effects on the serum lipid profile.\r"

The mean final dosages, administered once daily, to obtain 24-hour blood pressure (BP) control were doxazosin 12 mg (range 1 to 16) and atenolol 91.8 mg (range 50 to 100). Of 12 doxazosin and 7 atenolol patient withdrawals from the study, 7 doxazosin and 4 atenolol patients withdrew for treatment-related reasons. No statistically significant differences between treatment groups were found after 20 weeks in changes from baseline in standing and sitting BPs measured 24 hours after administration. Sitting BP (systolic/diastolic) was reduced by 10.5/9.8 mm Hg after doxazosin treatment and by 10.9/10.7 mm Hg after atenolol therapy. Standing BP was reduced by 8.8/7.7 mm Hg after doxazosin administration and 9.7/9.3 mm Hg after treatment with atenolol. Supine BP was measured in a small cohort of the study population, and doxazosin had a smaller effect than atenolol.

Twenty-four patients with mild hypertension were treated with either doxazosin or placebo for 6 weeks. Supine and upright mean arterial pressures decreased by 9 and 12 mm Hg, respectively, in patients receiving doxazosin. This decrease was significantly more than the blood pressure change with placebo (p less than 0.05). Doxazosin therapy led to a small increase in weight (p less than 0.05). It was also associated with a statistically insignificant decrease in renal vascular resistance (568 dynes s/cm5) so that renal blood flow and creatinine clearance did not change. Doxazosin increased renin levels acutely and norepinephrine levels with 6-week treatment, but these changes were not significantly different from placebo. Norepinephrine clearance, measured after a 120-minute infusion of 3H norepinephrine, did not change. Heart rate increased acutely after doxazosin administration, but returned to baseline during 6-week therapy. Blood pressure, measured hourly for 14 hours after treatment, was consistently decreased in all patients. Doxazosin taken once daily lowers blood pressure without affecting renal blood flow or heart rate.\r"

Terazosin, a structural analog of prazosin, also inhibits alpha 1 adrenoceptors and is recommended as once or twice-daily therapy. Nineteen (73%) of 26 patients randomly assigned to receive doxazosin were therapeutic successes; 17 (65%) achieved normalized blood pressure (defined as blood pressure less than or equal to 90 mm Hg).

Eighteen (64%) of 28 terazosin-treated patients were considered therapeutic successes; 16 (57%) achieved normalized blood pressure. The mean final daily dosage in patients classified as therapeutic successes was 5.6 mg. Treatment-related side effects were observed in 30% of doxazosin-treated and 39% of terazosin-treated patients. Most side effects observed in either treatment group were mild or moderate and either disappeared or were tolerated with continued therapy.

Thirty-five patients were also assessed for comparative effects of the 2 agents on serum lipid parameters. Doxazosin produced potentially favorable changes from baseline in the concentrations of serum lipid fractions (total triglycerides, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol and the derived HDL/total cholesterol ratio) compared with HCTZ. The decreases in total triglyceride and total cholesterol concentrations and an increase in the HDL/total cholesterol ratio were significantly different (p less than 0.006) from the opposite changes observed with HCTZ. Clinically relevant decreases from baseline in supine and standing blood pressures at 24 hours after administration did not significantly differ between the 2 agents. The incidence and severity of side effects were similar for both drugs. Three patients receiving doxazosin and 6 receiving HCTZ were withdrawn due to drug-related clinical side effects including 2 patients receiving HCTZ who were withdrawn because of laboratory test abnormalities. Eight HCTZ- and 1 doxazosin-treated patients developed hypokalemia and 6 HCTZ-treated patients developed hyperuricemia. These findings indicate that doxazosin and HCTZ provide comparable antihypertensive efficacy after 6 months of treatment using a once-daily regimen, but doxazosin produces a beneficial effect on the serum lipid profile as well as fewer biochemical aberrations.\r"

Digital images were obtained postmortem both during contrast injection using a fixed-pressure coronary perfusion system and after fixation when the coronary size was maintained by injection of a barium-gelatin casting mixture. Digital data were analyzed with commercially available, automated edge-detection software using a coronary catheter as the calibration standard. Coronary diameter measured during contrast injection was not significantly different from that measured after casting and fixation. Digital data from both methods correlated well with diameters from pathologic sections (injected, r = 0.85; fixed, r = 0.91). Linear regression parameters comparing pathologic diameters with the contrast injection method were slope = 0.82, intercept = 0.42 mm, and standard error of the estimate = 0.27 mm. Parameters for the comparison of pathology with casted coronary data were slope = 0.95, intercept = 0.16 mm, and standard error of the estimate = 0.23 mm. Intra- and interobserver variability were 3% (0.05 mm) and 4% (0.07 mm), respectively. These data indicate that when a coronary catheter as a calibration standard is used, coronary artery dimensions can be accurately measured by automated digital angiography techniques.\r"

To assess the feasibility and clinical utility of detecting MR during exercise testing, color Doppler examinations were performed in 22 patients with angiographically proved coronary artery disease (CAD) and in 17 normal subjects before, during and after graded supine bicycle exercise. Not only was MR visualized using color Doppler during dynamic testing, but it was also slightly more sensitive (59% vs 54%) and specific (100% vs 88%) than the electrocardiographic response in identifying patients with CAD. When the appearance of MR or diagnostic electrocardiographic changes or both were used to identify patients with CAD, the sensitivity of exercise tolerance testing increased to 82%, although the specificity was 88%. In addition, exercise-induced MR was observed to be as sensitive and specific as exercise-induced wall motion abnormalities. Combining exercise-induced MR with wall motion abnormalities also increased the sensitivity to 82%, with the specificity remaining at 100%. With use of exercise-induced MR, wall motion abnormalities or electrocardiographic changes, the sensitivity and specificity of the exercise test in diagnosing CAD was 91% and 88%, respectively. The degree of MR as estimated by maximal area of regurgitation signals, as well as by its ratio to left atrial area, did not correlate with extent of CAD. However, the presence of exercise-induced MR suggested an increased likelihood of 3-vessel CAD because it was found in 9 of 11 patients with 3-vessel CAD, compared with 2 of 5 patients with 2-vessel and 2 of 6 patients with 1-vessel CAD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

With a half-life of more than 40 hours, once-daily therapy is possible. Twenty-four patients (22 men, 2 women), mean age 58 years (range 43 to 72), with stable exertional angina were assigned to therapy with bepridil and nadolol in a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial. Antianginal efficacy was assessed by a diary of angina frequency and nitroglycerin consumption as well as by treadmill exercise testing. The effect of therapy on ventricular function was assessed by symptom-limited equilibrium gated exercise radionuclide angiography. During therapy with both nadolol and bepridil, the number of episodes of angina per week was significantly reduced and nitroglycerin consumption decreased compared with baseline evaluation. Exercise duration was prolonged by both therapies (baseline 281 +/- 122 seconds, nadolol 377 +/- 96 seconds, bepridil 400 +/- 109 seconds; p less than 0.005 for nadolol and bepridil vs baseline). Time to the onset of angina was similarly prolonged, 50% by nadolol and 65% by bepridil (p less than 0.005). Bepridil had no effect on PR and QRS durations, although QTc was significantly prolonged (baseline 0.43 +/- 0.03, nadolol 0.42 +/- 0.03, bepridil 0.45 +/- 0.04; p less than 0.005 for bepridil vs baseline and nadolol). By radionuclide angiography, neither nadolol nor bepridil had an adverse effect on left ventricular function at rest or during exercise. Bepridil therefore provides effective therapy for angina without adverse effects on left ventricular function, comparable to the effects of beta blockade with nadolol.\r"

An open-label intravenous trail in 10 patients was conducted using a dose of 1.7 mg/kg/min under constant monitoring. An oral short-term in-hospital trial in 20 patients (8 patients entered directly from the intravenous short-term trial) was conducted using a single-blind placebo dose titration protocol in which 50 mg of indecainide every 8 hours was increased at 3-day intervals to 75 mg, and then 100 mg every 8 hours depending on the observed change in ventricular arrhythmia frequency by Holter monitoring. Finally, an outpatient long-term oral trial was conducted in 17 of the 20 patients who completed the inpatient oral short-term trail. Two of the 10 patients from the inpatient intravenous trail did not enter the oral trial, because a proarrhythmic response developed in 1 and because of a lack of efficacy in the other. During the inpatient oral trial, 17 of 20 patients (85%) responded to indecainide and entered the long-term phase. Two of these patients were removed from the trial because of lack of efficacy at 3 and 10 months, respectively. In the oral therapy protocols, minor side effects of the central nervous system occurred in 4 of 17 patients (24%). Six of 20 patients (30%) each had more than a 25% increase in PR and QRS duration that was not associated with higher degrees of block.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirty patients undergoing catheterization received one of the following: pirmenol as a 50-mg intravenous bolus injection followed by a 2.5 mg/min infusion, lidocaine as a 75-mg intravenous bolus injection followed by a 3 mg/min infusion or placebo administered in a similar fashion. Mean plasma pirmenol concentrations during steady infusion were 2.3 to 2.4 mg/liter, and mean plasma lidocaine concentrations were 16 to 24 mumol/liter. Pirmenol increased heart rate from baseline by 10 beats/min (p less than 0.001) and mean arterial pressure by 5 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), with similar increases in systemic (p less than 0.05) and pulmonary vascular resistance (p less than 0.01). Lidocaine induced a comparable increase in mean arterial pressure (6 mm Hg, p less than 0.001), but unlike pirmenol, it increased left ventricular and diastolic pressure by 2.8 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). Indexes of left ventricular work were not affected by either drug. Echocardiographic ejection fraction was reduced more by pirmenol (-0.05, p less than 0.0001) than by lidocaine (-0.03, p less than 0.05), a difference that may be related to the changes in heart rate. Side effects were not observed in any patient. The myocardial depressant effect of pirmenol is relatively slight and comparable to that of lidocaine.\r"

At a daily dosage of 200 to 400 mg, pirmenol was effective in suppressing VPCs. In the double-blind phase of the trial, 60% of patients had at least a 70% reduction in VPC frequency and at least 70% of those patients who entered the open-label phase of the study continued to show at least a 70% reduction in VPC rate. Pirmenol was well tolerated by most patients; 66% of the patients treated with pirmenol in the double-blind phase had no adverse experiences. Of those who did have an adverse experience, the most common complaint was unusual taste. Serious adverse reactions were rare and only 2% of the patients had what may have been a proarrhythmic response. The same pattern of tolerance was seen in the open-label phase of the study when 151 patients were treated for an extended length of time with pirmenol. Pirmenol shows considerable promise for patients in whom the reduction of VPC frequency is desirable. Currently available antiarrhythmic drugs may have limited efficacy, cause serious or intolerable side effects or require frequent administration. Pirmenol has a convenient twice-daily dosing regimen, dependable antiarrhythmic action and a good safety record. This study demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of pirmenol in the control of VPCs.\r"

Therefore, the expression of cytokeratins of different molecular weights (54, 57, and 66 kd) were compared in paraffin sections of 37 primary carcinomas with their lymph node metastases by an avidin-biotin complex (ABC) method, using monoclonal antibodies. The epithelial tumors consisted of 16 squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and 17 adenocarcinomas with different degrees of differentiation (well, moderately, or poorly differentiated), a renal cell carcinoma, a hepatocellular carcinoma, a transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, and a carcinoid tumor of the stomach. The primary and metastatic tumors showed the same cytokeratin profiles. All SCCs and their metastases were positive for 57-kd cytokeratin and negative for 54-kd cytokeratin. All adenocarcinomas and their metastases were positive for 54-kd cytokeratin and negative for 66-kd cytokeratin. The extent of reactions varied with the differentiation of the carcinomas, with well-differentiated tumors showing more diffuse staining. Cases of lymphoma, sarcoma, and melanoma were negative for the three types of cytokeratins. The results indicate that identification of different molecular weight cytokeratins may be used to distinguish poorly differentiated SCCs from poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas, even in metastatic tumors. In addition, demonstration of these cytokeratins is useful in substantiating presence and identity of small foci of metastases in lymph nodes.\r"

Classification often rests on morphologic, cytochemical, and immunologic criteria, and the marker enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) has been considered to be a reliable indicator of lymphoblastic leukemias. Because TdT-positive cells sometimes are seen in leukemias otherwise identified as myeloblastic, the authors evaluated blasts identified as myeloid by the presence of myeloperoxidase (MPO) for the simultaneous expression of TdT. The blasts in the bone marrow aspirate or peripheral blood of unselected patients with hematologic malignancies were evaluated and 60 cases are shown. The French-American-British system and, in some patients, cytochemical and immunologic studies were used to classify the leukemias. The authors demonstrated that blasts simultaneously contained MPO and TdT in 29% of patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia and 3% of patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). This finding supports the hypothesis that TdT is an expression of cell primitivity rather than a marker for lymphoblastic cells.\r"

In eight serous cystadenocarcinomas, both the primary neoplasm and its metastases were examined. Of the 36 tumors, 7 (19.4%) showed positive staining for AL and 5 were of the serous type. The serous tumors showed moderate to strong staining reaction. Three serous cystadenocarcinomas were AL positive in both primary and metastatic sites, while the remaining five were negative in all sites. One mucinous cystadenoma and one clear cell carcinoma showed weak to moderately positive AL reactivity. There was no good correlation between AL positivity and the presence of malignancy or between AL positivity and tumor grade. In view of the relatively high AL reactivity in ovarian neoplasms, it is advisable to exercise caution in interpreting the presence of AL positivity as specific marker for mammary carcinoma.\r"

Three of 128 were positive for anti-HTLV-I antibody. The three seropositive patients had received 62, 82, and 1160 mL of transfused blood. These patients did not receive any transfusion thereafter. In addition, no anti-HTLV-I antibodies were detected in the sera of their mothers and siblings. These data suggested that HTLV-I infection is one of the transfusion-associated complications in neonates.\r"

An additive natriuretic and diuretic effect was observed after both metolazone and thiazide were combined with furosemide. The use of both types of diuretic combination was associated with marked kaliuresis. These combinations of diuretics seem equally effective in inducing natriuresis and diuresis in edematous nephrotic patients.\r"

Twenty-five patients, converted totally to azathioprine (Aza)/Pred, suffered intractable nephrotoxicity with no associated evidence suggesting ongoing rejection. The results with Aza/Pred conversion were disappointing because of an unacceptably high incidence of rejection and allograft loss. Twenty-four patients with intractable CsA nephrotoxicity were, therefore, treated using an alternative approach combining Aza with aggressive CsA dose reduction, and continued Pred therapy. All patients tolerated initiation of Aza without complication; allograft rejection was not common. Renal function improved for 23 of the 24 (96%) CsA/Aza/Pred patients with mean serum creatinine levels falling from 3.5 +/- 0.5 mg/dL to 2.2 +/- 0.4 mg/dL after a mean follow-up of 14 months (P less than .001). Among 18 patients observed at least 12 months, seven (39%) enjoyed serum creatinine values less than or equal to 2 mg/dL. Nine CsA/Aza/Pred-treated patients (37.5%) required hospitalization because of infectious complications, all of which resolved with temporary reduction of immunosuppression and specific antimicrobial therapy when indicated. One patient sustained acute allograft rejection as a result of patient noncompliance, and one patient on a seemingly appropriate CsA/Aza/Pred dose responded initially to steroid pulse antirejection therapy; however, renal function again worsened. Two patients developed progressive renal dysfunction due to chronic rejection, and returned to dialysis 13 and 17 months, respectively, following initiation of CsA/Aza/Pred. Overall, the actuarial graft survival for CsA/Aza/Pred-treated patients was 100% at 1 year, and 84% at 2 years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There is little published data concerning the long-term use of this catheter for hemodialysis, but a review of the literature suggests that pericatheter thrombus formation with or without occlusion of major veins has been a complication of chronic central venous catheterization with a variety of catheters, in both dialysis and nondialysis settings. We had this catheter placed in four diabetic patients who had severe problems related to maintenance of adequate vascular access. Two of the four patients underwent venography within 3 months of catheter placement because of impaired catheter function and were found to have thrombi on the outside of their catheters. These thrombi could not be dissolved with fibrinolytic agents, and the catheters were removed surgically without incident. The other two patients have no radiologic evidence of thrombus formation 4 and 7 months, respectively, after catheter placement. We suggest that proper selection of patients for this type of vascular access should be the subject of future studies and that patients with malfunctioning catheters undergo venography to rule out the presence of significant catheter related thrombosis.\r"

  ".W": "The glucagonoma syndrome is characterized by a necrolytic migratory erythematous rash, angular stomatitis, painful glossitis, a normochromic normocytic anemia, mild diabetes mellitus, weight loss, a tendency to thrombosis, and neuropsychiatric disturbances. The diagnosis is made by finding a high plasma glucagon concentration in the absence of any other cause, such as renal failure or severe stress. A pancreatic alpha-cell tumor can be identified and stained by immunocytochemistry with glucagon antibodies. Optimal treatment is surgical removal, but approximately 50 percent of the tumors have metastasized by the time of diagnosis. Since the tumor is slow-growing, remission can be obtained by hepatic artery embolization to shrink hepatic secondaries or by shrinkage, in about 10 percent of patients, with the combination chemotherapeutic regimen of 5-fluorouracil and streptozotocin. The rash frequently responds to administration of zinc, a high-protein diet, and control of the diabetes with insulin. Alongside the alpha cell in the islets of Langerhans is the D-cell, which produces somatostatin and may well act physiologically as a paracrine inhibitor of glucagon release. A newly developed, long-acting somatostatin analogue, SMS 201-995, which the patient can self-administer as a subcutaneous injection, has proven effective in suppressing glucagon secretion from glucagonomas and, in some cases, causing remission of clinical symptoms.\r"

Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) is produced and released by a tumor of the pancreatic islets or by a tumor of neural crest origin such as a ganglioneuroma. Under normal conditions, current evidence suggests that VIP is a neurotransmitter in the central and peripheral nervous systems and particularly in the peptidergic nervous system. The low VIP plasma concentration observed in healthy subjects is viewed as a neuronal overflow since it has been impossible to ascertain any endocrine role for circulating VIP. Markedly elevated VIP plasma levels in the VIPoma syndrome lead to intestinal secretion with severe secretory diarrhea, resulting in hypovolemia, hypokalemia, and acidosis. These symptoms subside after successful tumor removal. Approximately 50 percent of patients have metastatic spread at the time of diagnosis. For these patients, a new and promising therapeutic modality is available in the form of a subcutaneously administered somatostatin analogue that relieves symptoms through potent inhibition of VIP release from tumor tissue.\r"

Pancreatic enzyme secretion, gall bladder contraction, and cholecystokinin response after a Lundh meal were completely inhibited by SMS, while pancreatic enzyme secretion elicited by intravenous injection of secretin and pancreozymin was suppressed by 80 percent. The inhibitory effect of SMS on endogenous cholecystokinin release was fully operative on the sixth day of injection treatment, whereas the inhibitory effect on exogenous cholecystokinin injection significantly decreased after SMS administration for seven days, indicating desensitization of the end organ by somatostatin. The release of pancreatic polypeptide by a solid test meal is abolished by administration of 25 micrograms of SMS, the release of gastric inhibitory polypeptide is nearly completely suppressed, the response of insulin and C-peptide are significantly lowered, and the gastrin response is only slightly reduced.\r"

Although not a substitute for vaccination, prophylactic amantadine can be particularly helpful in high-risk groups, including those with cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases and those in chronic-care settings. Adjunctive administration to previously immunized high-risk persons enhances the vaccine's efficacy. If given to nonimmunized persons who are then vaccinated during an influenza out-break, it will protect them for the two to three weeks needed for vaccine-induced immunity to develop. If given to residents of a chronic-care facility early in an outbreak, it is helpful in controlling the outbreak. Used therapeutically within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms, amantadine will shorten influenza illness by up to 50 percent, reduce fever, and hasten the resumption of normal activities. Amantadine is particularly recommended for high-risk persons in whom influenza-like symptoms develop during a confirmed or suspected outbreak of influenza A.\r"

However, the increased relative risk for women with benign breast disease developing breast cancer appears to be associated with proliferative benign disease in association with atypia. Their cumulative risk may be as high as 30%. These women represent 3-5% of women with benign disease. They clearly warrant more careful screening and follow-up. The etiology of benign breast mastopathies is unknown, but its incidence and relationship to hormonal events suggests that many of the histologic entities represent an endocrine response. Many hormonal manipulations have been shown to decrease mastodynia and reduce the incidence of breast aspirations and biopsies. However, these and other therapeutic interventions have not been shown to reduce the incidence of breast cancer in women who are at high risk.\r"

In contrast, typical human cytomegalovirus-induced histopathologic lesions bearing human cytomegalovirus antigens were consistently localized in the trophoblastic cells covering placental villi. These data clearly demonstrate that placental cells are permissive of latent and/or abortive human cytomegalovirus infection in vitro.

  ".W": "Expansion of the availability of tertiary level services beyond major medical centers has proved to be a major problem in health care delivery. Routine maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening for neural tube defects, and now also for aneuploidy, is a classic example in which there has been a schism between the clinical expertise to manage such a program within a tertiary level reproductive genetics center and the ability to reach patients in regions that are not routinely accessible to the tertiary center. To address this problem we have established a collaborative university-commercial laboratory statewide maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein program that we believe can serve as a model for others. In the first 4 months since its implementation, the program volume has increased tenfold. The detection frequency of neural tube defects has been consistent with that of other programs (1/1690). Three aneuploid karyotypes were found in amniotic fluid of 118 women less than 30 years old who underwent genetic amniocentesis because of a low maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein value. Thus we conclude that: the establishment of a joint university-commercial maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein program may provide a successful model for efficient tertiary center outreach, assessment of our data suggests that a population at high risk for abnormal fetuses can be identified among patients not generally considered at high risk, low maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein values may likely be a more important public health measure than high ones.\r"

Although much effort has focused on the steroid receptor as a mediator of the steroid's effect in the cell, we are only beginning to understand the structure of steroid receptors. Development of monoclonal antibodies directed against both the steroid-binding \"receptors\" and receptor-associated proteins has allowed novel approaches to the problem. They were important in determining the nucleotide sequences of several receptor genes and subsequently the amino acid sequence of three receptors. Surprisingly, receptors contain amino acid sequences common to v-erb-A, a potentiator of oncogenic transformation. Two receptor-associated proteins have been found and their relationship to the receptors suggests the possibility of additional functions of receptors in addition to binding deoxyribonucleic acid. Thus the role of the receptor in the mechanism of steroid action is evolving from the \"two-step mechanism\" to one that includes the recently discovered receptor-associated proteins.\r"

Amyloid infiltration is also commonly found in insulin-producing pancreatic tumors. It was shown recently that amyloid purified from an insulinoma was composed mainly of a novel polypeptide (insulinoma amyloid polypeptide, IAPP), which had partial identity with the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Cat islet amyloid contained a similar polypeptide. This finding is verified in the present study, and it is shown that the cat IAPP differs from the human peptide only in two of the 16 elucidated amino acid residues. The authors now also show by N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis that human islet amyloid is of IAPP origin. Although the significance of IAPP is unknown, its occurrence in pancreatic endocrine tissue and partial identity with a known neuropeptide suggests an endocrine regulatory function.\r"

MT2 is reactive with mature T cells and B cells, but not with immature T cells, activated T cells, and germinal center B cells. Antibody MB1 is reactive with all B cells, with about 50% of mature T cells, and not with immature T cells. MB2 is reactive with all B cells and not with T cells. However, MB2 also stains endothelial cells and several types of epithelial cells. MB3 is reactive with B cells and histiocytes, but not with T cells. The antibodies were tested on a series of lymphomas that were also immunophenotyped with a panel of well-established reagents on frozen tissue sections. The results indicate that the MB and MT antibodies are useful tools in the study of reactive and neoplastic disorders of the lymphoid system.\r"

Most epithelial cells initially appeared to be of cortical type, too, though many bore subcapsular markers in most samples. However, two-color immunofluorescence revealed unexpected heterogeneity, numerous epithelial cells simultaneously expressing some or all of the markers of both these subsets (even in two pleural metastases). It is inferred that there is a common tumor stem cell whose normal counterpart may be related to the rare patches of similar phenotype in the cortex in control samples. The authors could detect no major differences in 5 of 7 samples from nonmyasthenics; thus, most thymoma cases may risk the development of MG. Finally, thymomas from 6 of 7 further MG cases pretreated with corticosteroids showed very few cortical thymocytes, and the (phenotypically similar) epithelium was more obvious.\r"

Strong reactions for lysosomal cysteine proteinases, which can degrade myofibrillar proteins, were demonstrated in macrophages invading and surrounding the necrotic areas and some degenerative myofibers and also in intramyofibral portions of atrophic fibers of dystrophic mice and humans. Apparently normal and regenerating myofibers did not stain for lysosomal cathepsins. Abnormal increases of cathepsins L and B were seen even in the early stage of plasmocid myopathy and in a 20-day-old young mdx mouse before infiltration of macrophages, suggesting that autodigestion by intramyofibral lysosomal proteinases is an important event before digestion of the necrotic fibers by macrophage proteinases. Activation of the intramyofibral lysosomal system, as in muscular dystrophy, was also observed in distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles without macrophageal infiltration (Am J Pathol 1986, 122:193-198). Thus, this activation seems to be an important, early response to myocellular damage.\r"

Such treatment did not cause immunodepression. Myocarditis varied in intensity, but was quite severe and diffuse in some animals, with focal fibrinoid, coagulative, and lytic necrosis and invasion of disintegrating myocardial fibers by the mononuclear inflammatory cells. Untreated infected controls exhibited mild focal myocarditis, usually represented by accumulation of lymphocytes in the interstitial connective tissue. It is suggested that the administration of low doses of cyclophosphamide interfered with the immunologic suppressor network that is thought to maintain the chronic indeterminate (or latent) phase of T cruzi infection.\r"

  ".U": "87238846\r", 
  ".W": "Sixteen choroid plexus tumors (CPTs) have been investigated for the localization of different immunocytochemical markers of epithelial and nonepithelial nature, namely, simple epithelial-type cytokeratins, vimentin, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a panepithelial antigen defined by the lu-5 monoclonal antibody (lu-5 antigen), S-100 protein, and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). Intermediate filament proteins have been identified in paraffin sections of 14 of 16 cases (87.5%). In all these tumors, cytokeratins and vimentin were constantly coexpressed by the neoplastic cells, in a manner similar to that of the cells lining normal choroid plexus. In 7 of these 14 cases, in addition to cytokeratins and vimentin, the neoplastic cells were shown to coexpress GFAP, which is not synthesized by their normal cell counterpart. The appearance of GFAP immunoreactivity in CPTs might be related to an ependymal differentiation of the neoplastic cells, because normal ependyma and ependymomas constantly coexpress GFAP and vimentin. The simultaneous expression of three distinct intermediate filament proteins by the same neoplastic cells is an exceedingly rare phenomenon, which has never been reported by double labeling technique in neoplasms of the central nervous system. Despite the complex antigenic profile of the CPT, which includes immunoreactivity for lu-5 antigen, S-100 protein, and EMA in most of the cases, positivity for three different epithelial markers indicates that these tumors have an epithelial nature. Moreover, the immunocytochemical typing of CPT with the panel of antibodies used in the current investigation allows differentiation from other primary and metastatic central nervous system tumors.\r"

  ".W": "Pick's disease, a form of progressive senile dementia, is distinguished by the presence of neuronal inclusions known as Pick's bodies. The Pick's body consists mostly of sparse 10-20-nm straight filaments admixed with other cytoplasmic elements. This ultrastructural study was undertaken to establish which components of the Pick's body share epitopes with the normal neuronal cytoskeleton and with Alzheimer's paired helical filaments. Vibratome sections from postmortem brains of patients afflicted with Pick's disease were immunostained by means of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to neurofilaments, an antiserum to microtubule proteins not cross-reacting with neurofilaments, and an antiserum to Alzheimer's paired helical filaments. All the antibodies have been shown previously to react with Alzheimer's paired helical filaments. The peroxidase-antiperoxidase or indirect immunogold procedure was used for immunostaining. In addition, we used Bodian's silver stain, which has a high affinity for neurofilaments. At the electron-microscopic level the antibodies and Bodian's silver reacted with the straight filaments and some amorphous elements contained within the Pick's body. The following preadsorptions blocked the immunoreaction: neurofilament antibodies with neurofilaments; microtubule antibodies with microtubule protein or a preparation of the microtubule associate protein, tau; antibodies to paired helical filaments with Alzheimer's brain tissue. Treatment of brain tissue containing Pick's bodies with sodium dodecyl sulfate, a solvent of the normal neuronal cytoskeleton, did not dissolve straight 12-nm filaments. The detergent extracted filaments contained the same isotopes as the Pick's filaments in intact tissue. These results demonstrate that the straight filament components of the Pick's body contain the same neurofilament and microtubule epitopes as the Alzheimer's paired helical filaments and that the filaments share insolubility characteristics similar to those of the paired helical filaments. It is proposed that these two structures are related and are derived at least in part from altered components of the normal neuronal cytoskeleton.\r"

  ".W": "A distinct population of normal human adrenocortical cells from adult glands spontaneously express HLA-DR, and occasionally also HLA-DQ, antigenic determinants in vivo and in vitro, as detected by immunofluorescence techniques using monoclonal antibodies on frozen tissue sections, primary cultures, and viable cell suspensions. In vivo, these antigenic determinants were found to be confined to the compact-type cells in the zona reticularis. In vitro, the adrenocortical identity of these HLA-DR+ cells was conclusively established by the characteristic change in their morphologic features induced by ACTH1-24 and by the simultaneous detection of tissue-specific adrenal autoantigens in double-label immunofluorescence staining. The cell surface expression of HLA-DR determinants by compact cells persisted in culture for several weeks and was not significantly affected by treatment with ACTH1-24. On the other hand, fetal adrenocortical cells of both transient and definitive zones were invariably negative for the expression of these HLA Class II antigenic determinants. Because normal human adrenocortical cells also express on their surface the molecules which constitute specific autoantigens in autoimmune adrenalitis, these findings argue against the notion that an ectopic HLA-DR expression associated with an otherwise \"silent\" autoantigen might trigger an organ-specific autoimmune response against endocrine cells. In addition, the expression of HLA-DR determinants by viable normal reticularis cells provides a readily detectable surface marker which may allow the physical separation of this population for studies in vitro.\r"

These lesions appear with a delay of about 6 hours; by light microscopy they are characterized by a focal dilatation accompanied by endothelial damage and increased permeability. They are more severe if the pellets are loaded with histamine and are inhibited if the pellets are loaded with serotonin. Electron microscopy shows interendothelial gaps; the media is massively infiltrated with blood components and fibrin. The medial smooth muscle cells are stretched and at times necrotic; inflammatory cells are scarce. On the basis of these features the lesion was named focal arteriolar insudation (FAI). Although its pathogenesis is not yet clear, the data at hand suggest that it is caused by endogenous mediators affecting the smooth muscle cells and/or the endothelium. FAI appears to be a specific arteriolar response to chronic nonspecific irritation.\r"

On the basis of previous experience with seasonal affective disorder, they treated the patient with bright artificial light, which reversed her symptoms. On subsequent occasions they reversed this treatment effect with oral melatonin administration and found that propranolol and atenolol, beta-antagonists that inhibit the production of melatonin, had a therapeutic effect similar to that of light. They discuss the implications of these findings in relation to the importance of melatonin as a mediator of seasonal rhythms in biology.\r"

This study investigates the possibility that the observed tolerance may be due to the recently described endothelium-dependent vasodilator system which mediates the action of several potent vasodilators. The maximum response induced by ethanol in control and intoxicated aortic rings with endothelium was significantly increased by treatment with eicosatetraynoic acid and methylene blue. In addition, these agents significantly decreased the EC50 of ethanol in intoxicated but not control rings with endothelium. The response of control and intoxicated aortic rings without endothelium was unaltered by eicosatetraynoic acid or methylene blue. Indomethacin, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, and FPL 55712 did not alter either the maximum response or the EC50 of ethanol in control or intoxicated rings with endothelium. These observations support the hypothesis that the endothelium-dependent tolerance observed in the aorta may be due to the release of an endothelium-derived relaxing factor.\r"

However, what mechanism is responsible for these cardiovascular alterations remains to be determined. Since it is well known that chronic alcohol consumption leads to hypophosphatemia and hypomagnesemia, we designed experiments to determine if controlled depletion of either phosphorous or magnesium (Mg2+) lead, in themselves, to cardiovascular disturbances and what effects these mineral depletions exert on myocardial cellular bioenergetics. Biochemical studies were carried out on left ventricular muscle, including mitochondrial and myofibrillar preparations. With respect to phosphate depletion, myocardial creatine phosphate, ATP, and ADP levels were reduced. Phosphate depletion also reduced mitochondrial and myofibrillar creatine phosphokinase activities; significant alterations in mitochondrial oxygen consumption, acid-extractable phospholipid precursors, and mitochondrial oxidation of long chain fatty acids were noted. With respect to magnesium depletion, significant reductions in inorganic oxygen consumption was also reduced. Utilizing these data, we have proposed several schemes for possible alcoholic-induced myocardial and vascular injury.\r"

A subhypnotic dose (2 g/kg) or a hypnotic dose (4 g/kg) of ethanol was administered intraperitoneally and the animals were killed 45 min later. In the rat the DA levels were unchanged, while the NE concentrations were decreased after both doses of ethanol. The DA levels did not change in the mouse and guinea pig, while the concentrations of NE showed a minor decrease in the mouse but were unaffected in the guinea pig. After 4 g/kg of ethanol the DOPAC and HVA concentrations were elevated significantly in all three species, and after 2 g/kg the DOPAC levels were increased in the rat and guinea pig brains and the HVA levels in the mouse and guinea pig brains. In the mouse and rat brain the DOPAC + HVA concentrations indicated a dose response relationship: 4 g/kg was significantly more effective than 2 g/kg. The DHPG concentration increased in the rat brain after both 2 and 4 g/kg, while the HMPG concentrations increased significantly only after 2 g/kg. In the mouse and guinea pig the brain DHPG concentrations remained unchanged, while the HMPG concentrations increased after both 2 and 4 g/kg ethanol. These data suggest, that the turnover of both DA and NE was increased 45 min after a subhypnotic as well as after a hypnotic dose of ethanol in all three species studied.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

DSM III diagnoses of major depression were made in 16 (32%) of the patients. The diagnoses were made using the NIMH Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) between the 10th and 24th day after the patients' last drink. Depressive symptoms decreased markedly as the patients progressed from active drinking to abstinence. Alcoholic patients having a diagnosis of major depression had higher BDI scores than those not having a diagnosis of major depression. Analysis of BDI items using a two-parameter logistic item response model confirmed that the BDI measured depressive symptoms in these alcoholics. We conclude that the BDI is valid for screening for depression in alcoholic patients.\r"

This report presents our findings on the composition of gangliosides from LS and SS mouse cerebellum and hippocampus, the composition of gangliosides from synaptosomal plasma membranes (SPM) of LS and SS mice, and the molecular species of cerebellar gangliosides from the two lines. It has been found that GM1 is elevated in the cerebellum and in cerebellar SPM of LS mice compared to SS mice, but that there is no difference between the GM1 concentration in the whole hippocampus of the two lines. Further, there are no differences in the molecular species of the cerebellar gangliosides of LS and SS mice.\r"

A system for measuring drinking problems, based largely on the work of Cahalan and Room, is presented and explained. As when interpreting any system of measuring drinking problems in a general population survey, readers must be aware that the resulting prevalence rates are strongly influenced by arbitrary decisions about where cutpoints should be drawn. With this caveat in mind, the results show that 9% of men drinkers and 4% of women drinkers reported problematic drinking behavior at what is defined as a moderate level of severity. Similarly, 14% of men drinkers and 6% of women drinkers reported adverse tangible consequences of drinking at a moderate level of severity. The age and sex distributions of drinking, heavy drinking, intoxication, and drinking problems were as expected, with greater proportions of men than women reporting these things and greater proportions of younger than older drinkers reporting them.\r"

Analysis of these samples revealed that 51 (50%) had traces of drugs other than alcohol and that 12 (12%) were alcohol free. Benzodiazepines were the most frequently detected drugs and these were found in 32% of all samples. Barbiturates were detected in seven (7%) samples and cannabinoids in 10 (10%) samples. A wide range of urine alcohol concentrations was found and some samples had zero or low concentrations. Although alcohol urine concentrations were generally lower in samples containing other drugs, the distribution of urine alcohol concentrations was similar for samples containing only alcohol and those containing alcohol and some other drug. Of the 51 samples found to contain drugs other than alcohol, subjects' self-reports were concordant in 27 cases (53%). Most of the discrepancies between self-reports and urine analysis were due to the under-reporting of the use of benzodiazepines. Subjects with drugs in their urine tended to be younger than others, but they were not distinguished with respect to their behaviors while in the detoxication center or length of stay. Those with the highest urine alcohol concentrations had shorter stays in the detoxication center. Implications for further studies are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Inasmuch as ethanol is thought to exert its major effects in the autonomic and central nervous systems, it is important to determine whether acute versus chronic ingestion of this abused substance exerts any direct actions on peripheral and cerebral blood vessels. Since the chronic effects of ethanol on the cardiovascular system appear to be pivotal in the etiology of hypertension, coronary heart disease, and strokelike events, it is important to elucidate and understand the effects of chronic ethanol abuse and its mechanism(s) of action on the peripheral and cerebral blood vessels. Data are reviewed which suggest that the peripheral vasodilation and hypotension which result from acute ingestion (or administration) of ethanol may, in large part, be a consequence of its direct actions on vascular smooth muscle cells, both at the macro- and microcirculatory levels. At least two mechanisms appear to contribute to this vasodilator effect: inhibition of the normal rhythm or vasomotion (spontaneous mechanical activity) of vascular smooth muscle, and depression of the contractile responses to endogenous neurohumoral substances that play a role in maintaining vascular tone and regulation of blood flow. The data acquired so far suggest that the dilator actions are related causally to interference with movement and/or translocation of Ca2+ across the vascular membranes. In addition, these actions appear to resemble the peripheral vascular effects of general anesthetics. Evidence is also reviewed which indicate that ethanol, in contrast to acting as a vasodilator in the splanchnic vasculature, is often a potent and concentration-dependent constrictor of arterioles and venules in the skeletal muscle vasculature. Direct in situ observations on the rat brain, using high resolution, quantitative TV image-intensification microscopy, indicates that administration of ethanol, irrespective of the route of administration (e.g., perivascularly, intraarterially, or systemically), produces graded concentration-dependent spasms of arterioles and venules. Concentrations of ethanol approximately equal to greater than 250 mg/dl produce intense spasms resulting in rupture of these vessels. Recent in situ studies in conscious dogs, using radiolabeled microspheres, also indicate that ethanol can produce deficits in regional brain blood flow. Studies with isolated canine middle cerebral and basilar arteries clearly demonstrate that low concentrations of ethanol (e.g., less than 10 mM) can produce concentration-dependent spasms by a direct vascular action.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The control group of patients exhibited significant rises in arterial blood pressure and heart rate for 4 minutes after tracheal intubation. Heart rate exceeded 100 beats/minute and systolic pressure increased by over 20% in every patient. All patients moved or breathed within 10 minutes of the administration of suxamethonium. Sufentanil 0.5 microgram/kg prevented increases in the mean values of heart rate and arterial blood pressure, although increases were observed in five patients. Significant falls in the mean values of heart rate and arterial pressure occurred from 4 minutes after intubation until observations ended 15 minutes after induction of anaesthesia. Two patients moved or breathed during this time, although movement in response to nerve stimulation occurred in all patients 10 minutes after administration of suxamethonium. Sufentanil 1 microgram/kg was effective in suppressing a rise in heart rate or arterial pressure in every patient. Significant falls in these variables occurred from 2 minutes after tracheal intubation onwards. No patient moved or breathed for 15 minutes after induction of anaesthesia, although neuromuscular transmission was present 10 minutes after giving suxamethonium in each case.\r"

Ten patients received intercostal nerve blockade on a total of 29 occasions in order to provide analgesia following liver transplantation and to facilitate weaning from artificial ventilation of the lungs. The opioid requirement of patients who received intercostal nerve blockade was considerably lower than that of those who did not; 56% of the children who received intercostal nerve blockade required no additional analgesia. One child, the first to receive intercostal nerve blockade, developed a pneumothorax following the procedure. The technique has proved to be safe in skilled hands. It is an acceptable method of postoperative analgesia in children after liver transplantation and may be a useful technique in the management of other paediatric patients.\r"

A total of 53 patients were admitted to the study, 28 received EAA, and 25 received standard anesthetic and analgesic techniques without EAA. Surgical \"risk\" was evaluated preoperatively and found to be comparable in the two groups. When compared to control patients, patients who received EAA had a reduction in the overall postoperative complication rate (P = 0.002) and in the incidence of cardiovascular failure (P = 0.007) and major infectious complications (P = 0.007). Urinary cortisol excretion, a marker of the stress response, was significantly diminished during the first 24 postoperative hours in the group receiving EAA (P = 0.025). Finally, hospital costs were significantly reduced for patients who received EAA (P = 0.02). The authors conclude that EAA exerted a significant beneficial effect on operative outcome in a group of high risk surgical patients.\r"

Preoperatively, fibrinolysis defined as a whole blood clot lysis index of less than 80% was present in 29 patients (29.9%), and a euglobulin lysis time of less than 1 h was present in 13 patients. Fibrinolysis increased progressively during surgery in 80 patients (82.5%) and was most severe on reperfusion of the graft liver in 33 patients (34%). When whole blood clot lysis (F less than 180 min) was observed during reperfusion of the graft liver, blood coagulability was tested by thrombelastography using both a blood sample treated in vitro with epsilon-aminocaproic acid (0.09%) and an untreated sample. Blood treated with epsilon-aminocaproic acid showed improved coagulation without fibrinolytic activity in all 74 tests. When whole blood clot lysis time was less than 120 min, generalized oozing occurred, and the effectiveness of epsilon-aminocaproic acid was demonstrated in vitro during the pre-anhepatic and post-anhepatic stages, epsilon-aminocaproic acid (1 g, single intravenous dose) was administered. In all 20 patients treated with epsilon-aminocaproic acid, fibrinolytic activity disappeared; whole blood clot lysis was not seen on thrombelastography during a 5-h observation period, and whole blood clot lysis index improved from 28.5 +/- 29.5% to 94.8 +/- 7.4% (mean +/- SD, P less than 0.001).

Group A (38 patients) was treated with the anticoagulants phenprocoumon or acenocoumarol; group B (32 patients), with the same anticoagulants plus pentoxifylline--800-1200 mg per day; and group C (43 patients) received irregular treatment with various vasodilators, such as xanthinolnicotinate, naftidrofuryl, pyridylmethanol, and others. At the end of the trial period a significant increase in systolic ankle pressure index and walking distance was observed in group B whereas the two other groups showed minor changes only. The elevated plasma fibrinogen concentration in group B was also significantly decreased. The percentage of atherosclerotic complications such as new arterial thrombosis in the lower limbs, newly appeared stenocardia, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack (TIA), and stroke was highest in group C (20%), relatively lower in group A (10%), and lowest in group B (3%). The percentage of hemorrhagic complications was minimal, with no significant differences between group A and group B. These complications were mild and disappeared quickly. The combined therapy with anticoagulants and pentoxifylline had a marked therapeutic and probably prophylactic effect as regards thromboembolic complications in patients with COAD and other localizations of atherosclerosis.\r"

The test, a new technique for evaluating the hemodynamics of limbs, permitted a clear distinction between normal, healthy subjects and patients suffering from arterial disorders. It was also seen that the degree of deterioration in the quantitative parameters was quite obviously related to the seriousness of the clinical picture. A comparison of the more severely and less severely affected limbs of each patient and the values taken bilaterally gave a correspondence of 98.6%. A therapeutic cycle consisting of the intraarterial administration of naftidrofuryl in 20 limbs achieved a statistically significant improvement in two parameters (tL and tR). Four limbs were treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. After treatment the values obtained with the test were found to be absolutely normal. It is therefore suggested that this test be widely adopted in vascular diagnostic laboratories.\r"
