They also scored higher on the Eating Disorders Inventory scales for drive for thinness, interoceptive awareness, bulimia, body dissatisfaction, maturity fears, and ineffectiveness. One of the 48 homosexual men and one of the 300 comparison group men met criteria for probable past histories of eating disorders.\r"

Except for the number of steady partners, the levels of all sexual activities of all groups of study participants declined over time. No effects of test awareness of antibody status were found on protective behavior for receptive anogenital contact. Elimination of unprotected insertive anogenital contact (by elimination of the practice or by condom use) was reported somewhat more often among seropositive men who became aware of their test result. Increased negative emotional reactions were reported by HIV seropositive men who were aware of their test result. These results suggest some behavioral impact of HIV antibody test knowledge in this cohort, but may not be generalizable to other populations.\r"

An oral regimen of 100 mg of azidothymidine and 800 mg of acyclovir every 4 hours was in general well tolerated, with the principal toxicity being megaloblastic erythroid changes. The pharmacokinetics of the two drugs were independent of each other. Six patients received the drug combination for at least 10 weeks; all had increased numbers of T4+ lymphocytes (P = 0.028), and two of three assessable patients had reversal of anergy. Two patients tested positive for serum HIV p24 antigen at entry, but became negative with treatment. Data for this small group suggest that this drug combination can be tolerated in patients with severe HIV infections; this study can be used as a basis for larger studies of this drug combination.\r"

Either A11Bw54Cw1DR4DQw3, A24Bw54Cw1DR4DQ-, A24B7Cw7DR1DQw1, or A24Bw52Cw-DR2DQw1 and the related haplotypes were found in 70% of cases with HAM. None of these \"HAM-associated\" haplotypes was found in patients with ATLL. HLA haplotypes made up of HLA components of A26Bw62Cw3DR5DQw3 and one particular haplotype of Aw33B44Cw-DRw6DQw1 were associated with the ATLL haplotypes. These \"ATLL-associated\" haplotypes were also found in the patients with HAM who had no previous history of blood transfusion. The in vitro cultures of peripheral blood lymphocytes with HTLV-I virion antigens revealed that the response with HAM peripheral blood lymphocytes was remarkably higher than that with ATLL peripheral blood lymphocytes. Based on this HTLV-I-specific immune responsiveness, we can segregate the high responders in HAM (14 of 16 cases) and the low responders in ATLL (6 of 7 cases). The existence of high and low responders was also confirmed by the normal healthy individuals, whose responses were segregated with HAM-associated and ATLL-associated haplotypes. These results suggested that two ethnic groups in southern Kyushu may get the two different diseases, HAM and ATLL, because of their different immunogenetic backgrounds. The high immune response to HTLV-I seems to be an important genetic factor in the development of HAM.\r"

The clinical features are similar to those of TSP reported in Jamaica, Martinique, the Seychelles, and the Ivory Coast of Africa and resemble also those clinical features of the human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I)-associated myelopathy described in southern Japan. Since HTLV-I infection is closely associated with TSP, we conducted a case-control study to evaluate the role of HTLV-I-associated risk factors among patients from the endemic focus in Tumaco, Colombia, and the seroprevalence rates of this virus in other geographical areas of the Pacific Colombian lowlands with and without TSP. From our seroprevalence study of antibodies to HTLV-I among TSP index patients, matched controls, household contacts (first- and second-degree relatives), and healthy controls from these areas, we found a strong association between HTLV-I and TSP. Also, there is a high seroprevalence of HTLV-I among sexual partners of patients and to a lesser extent among their offspring and other relatives some of whom had an early mean acquisition of antibodies to HTLV-I. Heterosexual promiscuity and other close interpersonal contact may play an important role in the transmission of TSP in the Pacific lowlands of Colombia.\r"

The prevalence of antibodies to HTLV-I in patients with chronic neurodegenerative disorders other than tropical spastic paraparesis and in patients with some muscle inflammatory disorders has been investigated. IgG antibodies to HTLV-I were measured in the sera and/or cerebrospinal fluid from 82 Guamanian patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and parkinsonism-dementia, 164 Guamanian normal controls, 10 patients with kuru from the Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea, 4 patients with Viliuisk encephalomyelitis from the Iakut region of eastern Siberia, 45 Italian patients with multiple sclerosis, and 56 patients with polymyositis (49 from the United States and 7 from Jamaica). As determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western immunoblot, and gelatin particle agglutination techniques, serological evidence of HTLV-I infection was found in 1 patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 1 control subject from Guam, and in 1 patient from the United States and all 7 Jamaican patients with polymyositis. Except for the high seropositivity rate among the group of Jamaican patients with polymyositis, our data indicate that HTLV-I is an unlikely causative agent in the spectrum of the neurological diseases examined. The seropositivity of the 7 Jamaican patients with polymyositis requires further study.\r"

In the present study, activated T-lymphocytes were found in the peripheral blood of patients with this disorder. There were increased numbers of large CD3-positive cells that also expressed histocompatibility leukocyte Class II (DR) and interleukin 2-receptor molecules. In addition, a significantly elevated spontaneous lymphoproliferative response was demonstrated in all patients. This is consistent with the known in vitro effects of human T-lymphotropic virus type I. In one patient, a defect in the generation of measles virus-specific cytotoxic T cells was identified. These observations indicate abnormalities of the cellular immune response in tropical spastic paraparesis.\r"

Six weeks after therapy, there was mild improvement in her strength, which peaked 2 months later. At her best, she was able to lift her leg 30 degrees off the bed and stand with assistance. Improvement, which was also demonstrated electrophysiologically, was short lived and partially declined when AZT was discontinued. This case demonstrates that some patients with HIV-related axonal neuropathies even in advanced stages can show objective signs of improvement when given AZT. A systematic trial with AZT in the treatment of patients with HIV-related polyneuropathies is therefore warranted.\r"

Both the area under the concentration-time curve ratio and the concentration ratio (by the disk method) for cefonicid were statistically lower than the ratios for ceftizoxime and cefotaxime. The high degree of protein binding of cefonicid results in the availability of less drug for diffusion to blister fluid than with the low-protein-binding ceftizoxime and cefotaxime.\r"

We assessed the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) as a measure of synoviocyte activation by LPS and their subunit structures. Diphosphoryl lipid A was the smallest portion of lipid A tested that stimulated PGE2 production. The polysaccharide fraction of LPS, containing the O antigen, was also active. Intraarticular injections of the polysaccharide resulted in a synovitis very similar to that found in association with the intact LPS molecule. These observations suggest that both parts of LPS might be involved in gram-negative, organism-associated synovitis.\r"

Endometriosis was surgically induced 10 days later using a previously described experimental technique. Peritoneal fluid PGE2 and PGF2-alpha concentrations were significantly lower in the EPA/DHA group versus controls (P less than 0.05, P = 0.05, respectively). Total endometrial implant diameter 8 weeks after induction of endometriosis was significantly smaller in the experimental group (3.1 +/- 0.2 cm) compared with the controls (4.0 +/- 0.3 cm) (P less than 0.03). The authors conclude that dietary supplementation with fish oil, containing the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids EPA and DHA, can decrease intraperitoneal PGE2 and PGF2-alpha production and retard endometriotic implant growth in this animal model of endometriosis.\r"

Forty-nine episodes (83%) in 34 women were followed by recovery within 1 yr postpartum, and those women remained euthyroid thereafter (group A); 10 women [10 episodes (17%)] developed permanent hypothyroidism during the follow-up period (group B). Five women in group B recovered during the first year, but became hypothyroid again later, the other 5 women in Group B remained persistently hypothyroid. HLA typing revealed significantly higher frequencies of HLA-DR3, -DRW8, -DRW9, -A26, -BW46, and -BW67, and significantly lower frequencies of HLA-DR2, -BW52, -BW62, and -CW7 in women with postpartum hypothyroidism than in normal women. Of 9 women with postpartum hypothyroidism who had HLA-DRW9 and/or -B51 associated with antithyroglobulin-antibody titers of 2(3) X 10 or higher, 6 developed permanent hypothyroidism. We conclude that long term follow-up is essential for women of postpartum hypothyroidism because of the risk of permanent hypothyroidism. The results suggest that some immunogenetic factors may be related to the etiology of postpartum hypothyroidism and that women with HLA-DRW9 and/or -B51 and higher titers of antithyroglobulin antibody are likely to develop permanent hypothyroidism.\r"

Elevated serum beta hCG levels were present initially in the majority of the trophoblastic disease patients. By 12 weeks postevacuation raised serum beta hCG levels were detected in 42% of patients with malignant disease compared to 12% of patients with benign disease. No significant relationship was found between the initial alpha hCG levels and malignancy or resistance to chemotherapy. Increased serum free subunit levels did not distinguish between choriocarcinoma or benign hydatidiform moles, but increasing beta hCG to hCG ratios identified patients with high risk disease requiring multiagent chemotherapy. In nongestational malignancy, increased subunit levels occurred in fewer patients and to a lesser extent. Higher beta hCG and alpha hCG levels coincided with a histology of proliferating intermediate and cytotrophoblast cells, respectively, while high hCG levels occurred in association with syncytial proliferation. A histological mechanism for hCG synthesis is proposed, whereby mRNA for hCG subunits in syncytium depends on supplies of presynthesized mRNA introduced by fusion from differentiating cytotrophoblasts. Abnormalities in the extent and rate of differentiation would result in imbalanced subunit secretion.\r"

  ".W": "A patient with a mixed pituitary tumor secreting TSH and GH was treated, starting 3 months after partial adenomectomy, with the somatostatin analog SMS 201-995 for 8 months. Somatostatin itself inhibited TSH, GH, and alpha-subunit release by the tumor both in vivo and in vitro. Long term treatment with twice daily sc injections of SMS 201-995 resulted in decreased TSH secretion and lower serum thyroid hormone levels. However, euthyroidism was achieved only when the patient was treated with three daily 200-micrograms injections of SMS 201-995. After 30 weeks of SMS 201-995 therapy, TSH secretion increased, while GH secretion remained suppressed. After withdrawal for 6 months, SMS 201-995 (100 micrograms, sc, twice daily) again completely inhibited TSH secretion. SMS 201-995 did not alter the volume of the residual adenomatous tissue. We conclude that SMS 201-995 may be a valuable therapeutic agent for the management of patients with a thyrotroph adenoma. However, desensitization may occur during long term treatment.\r"

In parallel, transcription of the TCR-alpha, beta, and gamma genes was examined in 11 of these patients and in the T cell lines. All T-ALL and the three T cell lines exhibited both TCR-gamma and beta gene rearrangements. 8 of 10 T-ALL and all T cell lines expressed TCR-gamma transcripts. All samples tested expressed both TCR-beta and CD3-gamma transcripts. TCR alpha transcripts were only observed in CD3+ T-ALL but not in CD3- T-ALL or the CD3- cell lines. Among the CD3+ T-ALL, eight had TCR-alpha gene rearrangements. In addition, TCR-alpha gene rearrangements were detected in one CD3- T-ALL and all three T cell lines. These leukemic cells may represent a transient stage between rearrangement and expression and provide an opportunity for analyzing the mechanism regulating the expression of the TCR-alpha gene.\r"

Reporting poor work or whistleblowing is a dilemma not only for dentists and other health care professionals, but also for the engineer, architect, and federal employee, among others. This survey of the ethical or legal perceptions of the dental practitioner supports two conclusions: perplexing situations are perceived as predominantly ethical rather than legal problems and the factor of age (number of years in practice) might affect this trend toward the ethical consideration of complicated issues. Understanding the nature of these and other perplexing situations requires that dental practitioners step beyond the confines of their practice and the boundaries of the dental profession to search for more effective ways of dealing with, and therefore living with, the realities of their practice.\r"

Washing the latex gloves decreased the effect of inhibition of setting on the putty but did not eliminate it. Thus, latex gloves should not be worn while mixing or handling vinyl polysiloxane putties. Putties should not be dispensed while wearing latex gloves as the entire jar can become contaminated. If gloves are removed to mix the putty, hands should be washed thoroughly; however, this violates the barrier technique and is not recommended. Vinyl gloves may be worn over latex gloves (or by themselves), for dispensing and mixing the putty; but the vinyl gloves should not be contaminated with powder from the latex gloves.

If a dropper bottle of these agents is stored in a confined space such as a storage tub along with certain local anesthetic cartridges, the monomer vapor can enter the cartridge and contaminate its contents. A combination of methyl methacrylate in the presence of 2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine appears to be the most reactive of the combinations tested.

Scatchard analysis of PAF binding revealed a single class of PAF receptors (7872 +/- 1310/cell) which had a dissociation constant of 0.08 +/- 0.01 nM (mean +/- SEM, eta = 6). The dissociation constant was confirmed independently by quantifying the kinetics of initial specific PAF binding. PAF binding was stereospecific, required an sn-2 acetyl substituent, and was inhibited by structurally diverse PAF antagonists including kadsurenone, BN 52021, triazolam, and CV3988. The fact that the receptors are functionally active was shown by the observation that 1 to 100 pM PAF increased free intracellular calcium in P388D1 cells in a dose-related manner. These studies demonstrate that P388D1 macrophages have functional PAF receptors whose affinity and structural specificities are similar to PAF receptors in other cells. The availability of a stable cell line that binds but does not metabolize PAF will greatly facilitate studies of the PAF receptor.\r"

  ".W": "Mortality and morbidity rates for childhood leukemia are examined with reference to time trends and racial differences. Prior to 1964, white and nonwhite children had very different acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) mortality rates. With the advent of successful chemotherapy, the mortality rate of ALL in white children has decreased resulting in virtually no racial differences in ALL mortality. The reasons for a stable ALL mortality rate in nonwhite children despite successful chemotherapy include poor access to health care, undefined socioeconomic factors and a biologically different type of ALL occurring in nonwhite children. Recent data from two cancer surveys (1969-1971, 1973-1976) reveal that nonwhite children have a lower incidence of ALL than white children. Underreporting in the nonwhite children could partly account for the difference, but other contributing factors might include a genetic predisposition, undefined socioeconomic influences, and perhaps, a viral agent. Further studies of the factors contributing to racial differences in ALL incidence and mortality are needed.\r"

  ".W": "By radioimmunoassay we determined circulating levels of a tumor-associated antigen, CA 19-9, in 47 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, to learn if serial testing was useful in predicting prognosis or in detecting disease progression. Before treatment, 42 (89%) had an abnormal serum level, and 45 (96%) had an abnormal level at some time during the disease course. A pretreatment value of less than 1,000 U/mL (normal, less than or equal to 37 U/mL) was found in 38 patients; 20 (53%) had resectable disease. One of nine patients (11%) with a pretreatment value greater than 1,000 U/mL had resectable disease (P2 = .05). Among 14 patients who underwent pancreatectomy and were studied serially, the CA 19-9 level normalized in eight; seven (88%) survived greater than or equal to 18 months. Six patients whose levels did not normalize after pancreatectomy all died in less than 12 months (P2 less than .005). Greatly elevated levels occurred in 11 patients after pancreatectomy 1 to 7 months before clinically apparent recurrence. The other three patients without significant elevations remain clinically free of disease. The data suggest that serial determination of serum CA 19-9 levels are useful as a prognostic indicator and in detecting disease recurrence following pancreatectomy. Concurrent determinations of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels showed abnormal preoperative values in 28 of 46 patients tested (61%). Concurrent serial postoperative determinations of CEA were available in ten patients. Whereas CA 19-9 values clearly indicated eight recurrences, CEA was helpful in only four. In this small group of patients, CA 19-9 was a better predictor of recurrence.\r"

We reviewed the data on two Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) trials in acute nonlymphocytic leukemia to determine the incidence of CNS leukemia (CNSL). The incidence of CNSL was 5% (30 of 569 patients) overall, and 3% (ten of 331) in patients in complete remission (CR). A number of factors were evaluated for association with increased risk of CNSL. Men more frequently developed CNSL than women at a three to one ratio, and median presenting WBC counts were higher in affected than unaffected patients (44,200/microL v 17,000/microL, P = .01). The low incidence of CNSL in AML supports the view that CNS prophylaxis is unnecessary. However, because 68% of patients (13 of 19) who developed CNSL early in the course of disease had presenting WBC counts greater than 40,000/microL, screening lumbar punctures should be routinely obtained during induction therapy in patients presenting with high circulating blast cell counts.\r"

  ".U": "88171630\r", 
  ".W": "One hundred ninety-five adult patients with refractory or first relapse acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were randomly assigned to receive high-dose cytarabine (HiDAC), 3 g/m2 as a three-hour intravenous (IV) infusion every 12 hours for four doses, followed by 6,000 IU/m2 asparaginase (ASNase) administered at hour 42, or HiDAC without ASNase. Treatment was repeated on day 8. The median patient age was 52 years. There was an overall superior complete remission (CR) rate for HiDAC/ASNase (40%) v HiDAC (24%), P = .02. Subset analysis according to prior response and age showed the following CR rates: 54% from HiDAC/ASNase treatment of refractory AML in patients less than 60 years, and 31% in patients greater than 60 years; CR from HiDAC in the same refractory groups were 18% (less than 60) and 0% (greater than 60); 37% from HiDAC/ASNase treatment of relapsed AML in patients less than 60 years, and 43% in patients greater than 60 years; CRs from HiDAC in the same relapsed groups were 33% (less than 60) and 21% (greater than 60). Toxicity in the two treatment arms was comparable and consisted primarily of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, mild hepatic dysfunction, diarrhea, conjunctivitis and serositis, and hyperglycemia. There was only one case of transient cerebellar toxicity and no cutaneous toxicity. Median time to full hematologic recovery was 5 weeks. There was an overall survival benefit for patients treated with HiDAC/ASNase (19.6 weeks) compared with HiDAC (15.9 weeks), P = .046, primarily attributable to effects in refractory patients. Median time to failure for refractory patients who achieved CR was 38.5 weeks with HiDAC/ASNase, and 13.3 weeks for those treated with HiDAC. For relapsed patients in CR from HiDAC/ASNase the median time to failure was 17.7 weeks and 18.3 weeks for HiDAC. The overall 42% CR rate from HiDAC/ASNase v 12% from HiDAC in patients with refractory AML indicates that HiDAC/ASNase is not cross-resistant with standard-dose cytarabine (SDAC) and anthracyclines. We conclude that HiDAC/ASNase has substantial activity in poor-prognosis AML and that this combination warrants further trials in earlier stage disease.\r"

Terminal half-life and volume of distribution appeared to be smaller in case of EPI, whereas plasma clearance and cumulative urinary excretion was larger in comparison to DOX. The major metabolite of DOX was doxorubicinol (Aol) followed by 7-deoxy-doxorubicinol (7d-Aolon). Metabolism to glucuronides was found in case of EPI only. The area under the curves (AUC) of the metabolites of EPI decreased in the order of the glucoronides E-glu greater than Eol-glu, 7d-Aolon greater than epirubicinol (Eol). The AUC of Eol was half of the value in its counterpart Aol. In the case of EPI, the AUC of 7d-Aolon was twice the level of that of the corresponding metabolite of DOX. The terminal half-lives of the cytostatic metabolites Aol and Eol were similar, but longer than the corresponding values of their parent drugs. Half-lives of the glucuronides (E-glu, Eol-glu) were similar to the half-life of their parent drug. 7d-Aolon had a somewhat shorter half-life in comparison to both DOX and EPI. Approximately 6.2% of EPI and 5.9% of DOX were excreted by the kidney during the initial 48 hours. Aol was found in the urine of patients treated with DOX, whereas Eol, E-glu, and Eol-glu were detected in urine of patients treated with EPI. The cumulative urinary excretion appeared to be 10.5% for EPI and its metabolites, and 6.9% for DOX and its metabolite. The plasma concentration v time curves of (7d)-aglycones showed a second peak between two and 12 hours after injection, suggesting an enterohepatic circulation for metabolites lacking the daunosamine sugar moiety. The plasma concentrations of the glucuronides were maximal at 1.2 hours for E-glu and 1.9 hours for Eol-glu. All other compounds reached their maximum plasma concentration during the first minutes after the administration of DOX and EPI. Deviating plasma kinetics were observed in one patient, probably due to prior drug administration.\r"

The effect of anterior nares expansion and/or nasal decongestant administration on the nasal component of breathing was also examined in these patients. Although variability among subjects was demonstrated in the ratio of nasal respiration to total respiration, 25% of the \"nasally-obstructed\" patients were 100% nasal breathers and no patient had a nasal component less than 18% of total respiration. Great variability existed among the patients in their response to nares expansion and/or decongestant administration. Collectively, they demonstrated no significant mean increase in nasal respiration with nares expansion alone. The patients demonstrated an increase with administration of the decongestant and with decongestant combined with nares expansion. The latter condition resulted in an increase that was greater than with decongestant alone. The implication of this study is that the traditional diagnostic terms \"mouth breathing\" or \"nasal obstruction\" are not useful. They do not describe the type, location, or severity of an obstruction or the relative contribution of the nose and mouth to respiration. Many patients who experience symptoms or have signs of nasal obstruction can functionally compensate to maintain 100% nasal breathing.\r"

Soft tissue clefts were created in the median region of the palate at the age of 6 (group 1), 16 (group 2), and 25 weeks (group 3). Relaxation incisions were made, and the mucoperiosteum was elevated and closed in the midline, leaving two areas of denuded bone adjacent to the dentition. Metallic implants were placed in the palate, and dorso-ventral and lateral radiographs were made until the age of 37 weeks to study sutural growth and overall growth of the maxilla. In groups 1 and 2, growth in the midpalatal suture was less, compared to the control, from 16 to 25 weeks and from 16 to 37 weeks of age. In group 2, less increase was also found in the transverse palatal sutures. Group 3, the sham group, and the control group did not show significant differences. None of the dimensions measured on the lateral radiographs showed any significant differences for any group. It was concluded that palatal surgery as performed in this study has no influence on vertical and antero-posterior maxillary growth; only transverse palatal growth is influenced to a minor degree, especially when surgery is performed before or during the eruption of the permanent posterior teeth.\r"

Of the two cell types, fibroblasts and macrophages, grown from hydronephrotic explants, neither increased prostaglandin production when grown alone in tissue culture. Recombining the two cell types restored bradykinin responsiveness. Bradykinin responsiveness could be induced in either normal or contralateral cell cultures when macrophages from the hydronephrotic kidney were added to cultures of cells from normal or contralateral cortex.

ELISA specificity and sensitivity exceed 98%; the predictive value of a positive test varies from 2% for a weakly positive test in a low-prevalence population to 99% for a strongly positive test in a high-risk group. Confirmatory Western blot testing identifies antibodies with affinity for specific HIV antigens. Indeterminate Western blot antibody patterns necessitate subsequent testing or alternative methods for interpretation. A \"window\" period of up to 3 or more months follows acute HIV infection before seropositivity occurs.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have indicated that the regional distribution of the arachidonic acid metabolites around a focal ischemic lesion may be important in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia. To determine the functional significance of this regionalization, we examined the effect of imidazole (a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor) on the distribution of the vasoconstrictor thromboxane and the vasodilators prostacyclin and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and on the distribution of cerebral blood flow (CBF) around a focal ischemic lesion, middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion in the cat. The study was conducted in two phases. The first phase examined regional distribution of tissue arachidonic acid metabolites and the effect of imidazole treatment on that distribution. The second phase examined the effect of imidazole treatment on the distribution of blood flow about the focal ischemic lesion as well as on electrocortical function and edema production. MCA occlusion resulted in increased thromboxane, prostacyclin, and PGE2 levels in the ipsilateral hemisphere. These increases were greatest in the region of marginal ischemia and were present both 3 and 6 hours after occlusion. Imidazole pretreatment (50 mg/kg i.p.) significantly inhibited thromboxane production, but augmented production of prostacyclin and PGE2. In the blood flow studies, imidazole was without effect on regions of dense cerebral ischemia (CBF less than 20 ml/minute/100 g for more than 12 of 24 postocclusion hours). In regions of marginal ischemia (20 less than CBF less than 30 ml/minute/100 g for more than 12 of 24 postocclusion hours), imidazole pretreatment significantly increased blood flow in both gray and white matter compared with saline-treated controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Tumor-free and tumor-bearing animals were randomized for three treatments at 12-hour intervals with saline, dexamethasone (10 mg/kg i.p.), or indomethacin (10 mg/kg i.p.). Increase in water content was observed only in the compressed lumbar cord segments of paralyzed rats; the cervical and thoracic segments did not differ from controls. The rate of release of prostaglandins was evenly distributed along the spinal segments in tumor-free rats. In tumor-bearing rats, a consistent significant increase in PGE2 production was found in the compressed lumbar segment in the presence of neurological dysfunction: early (limp tail), P less than 0.05; paraplegia, P less than 0.001. A significantly elevated PGE2 synthesis preceded the increase in water content by 2 to 3 days. A 2-fold increase in TXB2 was detected in only one of three experiments, and synthesis of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha was elevated to 4 times the normal value (P less than 0.005) in two of three experiments. Dexamethasone failed to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis in the spinal cord of normal controls or paralyzed rats, whereas in nonneural tissues (liver, uterus) it reduced synthesis of the three metabolites by at least 50%, thus demonstrating a differential effect on central nervous system (CNS) vs. non-CNS tissues. Dexamethasone also failed to reduce the increased water content of the compressed segments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The patient showed apparent clinical improvement on oral carnitine administration. A quadriceps muscle biopsy revealed a slight increase in intrafiber lipid droplets and mild accumulation of glycogen in the subsarcolemmal portion. An anaerobic glycolysis in vitro study showed a block after glucose-1-phosphate and before glucose-6-phosphate. Direct measurement of individual glycolytic enzymes in muscle of the patient demonstrated a marked decrease in phosphoglucomutase (PGM) activity (13% of the control mean). The specific defect of PGM activity in this patient suggests that the block in the anaerobic glycolytic pathway is the primary abnormality. PGM deficiency can be added as a newly recognized cause of secondary systemic carnitine deficiency syndromes.\r"

The occurrence and treatment of arteriovenous vascular communications in the head and neck region have traditionally presented most perplexing problems. Traditional treatment has usually involved the obtaining of proximal and distal vascular control and surgical removal of the lesions, when feasible. This article presents a case that is of particular interest because it illustrates the successful use of cyanoacrylate as the only treatment for a large arteriovenous malformation of the left side of the mandible. A 4-year follow-up shows no evidence of the lesion and demonstrates complete regeneration of bone in the same area.\r"

In 17 patients with gastric ulcer, the gastric secretion was usually normal. The diagnoses were made with gastroscopy. Seven patients with dental erosion were found, and they all came from the group of 35 dental patients with reflux esophagitis or duodenal ulcer. No erosions were seen in the other diagnostic groups (F = 0.02). Thus, gastrointestinal disorders with increased output of gastric acid may be linked with dental erosions. The finding emphasizes the need for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment of patients with upper gastrointestinal symptoms in order to avoid irreversible lesions in the teeth.\r"

Factors predisposing to caries were evaluated according to Krasse's concept of caries risk. On this basis, 11 of the 15 patients had a high caries risk. The concept of caries risk acknowledges the multifactorial background of caries initiation and progression and, in this pilot study, has proved to be an appropriate basis for evaluation of patients with chronic disease.

One osteosarcoma expressed a 2.4-kilobase transcript in addition to a normal 4.7-kilobase species.

The records of 11 cases of purulent pericarditis were selected from records of 11,000 cases of pericarditis at Duke University Medical Center and reviewed, and experience with three cases of candida purulent pericarditis (CPP) was evaluated. One case occurred in a patient recovering from complicated cardiac surgery, one in a patient with hematologic malignancy, and one in an alcoholic patient requiring intubation for a severe respiratory infection. Each case is representative of a group at increased risk for the development of CPP. Given the poor prognosis for CPP, treatment should include both medical and surgical interventions. Although amphotericin B achieves good penetration into the inflamed pericardial space, the only survivors of CPP have received both amphotericin B and pericardiectomy. Careful attention to clinical indications of pericardial inflammation and systemic infection in the three groups of patients may lead to earlier recognition of CPP, implementation of appropriate therapy, and perhaps a higher rate of cure.\r"

Transcripts for the transducin alpha subunit, TC alpha, which is specific to the cone cell, as well as transcripts for the red or green cone cell photopigment, were found in seven out of seven low-passage retinoblastoma cell lines.

Whereas fetal retinal cells were highly sensitive to the antimitogenic effects of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), retinoblastoma tumor cell lines were all resistant to this factor. Binding assays and affinity labeling of these cells with radioiodinated TGF-beta 1 revealed that the cells did not have TGF-beta receptors. The retinoblastoma cells lacked the three affinity-labeled proteins of 65, 95, and 300 kilodaltons typically seen in human cell lines and thus differed from normal retinal cells and from other types of neuroectodermal tumors that display the normal pattern of receptors. Loss of TGF-beta receptors, which is a rare event among tumor cells, may represent one mechanism through which these cells escape from negative control and form retinoblastomas.\r"

SMS 201-995 was infused intravenously at doses of 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 ng/kg/hr for 2 to 3 hours in the following experimental conditions: (1) interdigestive pancreatic secretion, (2) pancreatic secretion stimulated by the intravenous infusion of both secretin, 0.06 CU/kg/hr, and cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK8), 0.03 microgram/kg/hr, and (3) pancreatic secretion after ingestion of a test meal. Pancreatic juice was analyzed for volume and outputs of bicarbonate and protein. Plasma levels of motilin, pancreatic polypeptide (PP), CCK, and secretin were determined by radioimmunoassay. SMS 201-995 inhibited significantly the pancreatic secretion and release of hormones, including secretin, CCK, PP, and motilin, in all three experimental conditions.

Before radioimmunoassay, our samples were purified by solid-phase extraction with C18Sep-Pak cartridges and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. When concentrations of the three prostaglandins were compared in the milk of mothers delivering prematurely and at term, very low concentrations were measured and no differences were observed. Concentrations of prostaglandins also remained essentially the same at the various stages of lactation. However, the mean ratio of DHKF2 alpha to PGF2 alpha was higher in samples from mothers who delivered early than in samples from those who delivered at term. These ratios were comparable to those reported in the literature for human plasma. The functional significance of these compounds in human milk remains undetermined.\r"

Escherichia coli, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, group D streptococci, Bacteroides sp., and Peptococcus sp. were among the most frequently isolated pathogens. The patients were treated for a mean of 5.6 +/- 1.6 days and received a total dose of 19.27 gm. The signs and symptoms of infection were cleared or improved in 93% of the 133 patients evaluable for clinical response. Of the 116 evaluated bacteriologically, 95% had a satisfactory or presumed satisfactory response; only six patients (5%) were considered to be bacteriologic failures. Differences in the results of several clinical laboratory tests performed before and after treatment were statistically, but not clinically, significant (p less than 0.05). Safety was evaluated in the 158 patients who received cefotetan, and only four (3%) had adverse reactions considered related to the drug. Cefotetan was clearly effective and produced no untoward reactions in these women with obstetric and gynecologic infections caused by both aerobic and anaerobic organisms when administered at 1 or 2 gm every 12 hours.\r"

The polymicrobial origins of pelvic inflammatory disease have been well documented and the major organisms recovered from the upper genital tract in patients with pelvic inflammatory disease include Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and mixed anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. This study was undertaken to compare the efficacy and safety of cefotetan plus doxycycline with that of cefoxitin plus doxycycline in the treatment of hospitalized patients with acute pelvic inflammatory disease. A total of 68 hospitalized patients with acute pelvic inflammatory disease were entered and randomized into two treatment groups: cefotetan (n = 32) and cefoxitin (n = 36). There were six tuboovarian abscesses in each group. C. trachomatis was recovered from 7 (10%) and N. gonorrhoeae from 48 (71%) of the patients. Anaerobic and aerobic bacteria were recovered from the upper genital tract in 53 (78%) of the patients. Cefotetan plus doxycycline and cefoxitin plus doxycycline demonstrated high rates of initial clinical response in the treatment of acute pelvic inflammatory disease. Clinical cure was noted in 30 (94%) of the cefotetan plus doxycycline group and 33 (92%) of the cefoxitin plus doxycycline group. Four failures were sonographically diagnosed tuboovarian abscesses that responded to clindamycin plus gentamicin therapy. The fifth failure was an uncomplicated case that did not respond to cefoxitin and doxycycline and required additional therapy. At 1 week and 3 weeks, respectively, the posttreatment cultures demonstrated eradication, in all instances, of N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis. These regimens also were very effective in eradicating anaerobic and aerobic pathogens from the endometrial cavity. Both regimens were well tolerated by the patients, and few adverse drug affects were noted.\r"

Mean left and right atrial, pulmonary, and systemic pressures (Pla, Pra, Ppa, and Psa, mm Hg), cardiac output (CO, L/min), and heart rate were measured continuously. Systemic (SVR) and pulmonary vascular resistances (PVR) were calculated by (Psa-Pra)/CO and (Ppa-Pla)/CO, respectively. Five groups of experiments were performed using the same sheep (n = 6). After a 30-min baseline period, sheep inhaled a hypoxic gas mixture (O2:N2 = 1:9) for 40 min. Pretreatment with DBcAMP (200 micrograms/kg/min) inhibited HPV (Ppa, 12.0 +/- 2.3 to 20.0 +/- 2.3 versus 13.2 +/- 2.5 to 14.3 +/- 1.4 mm Hg, p less than 0.01; PVR, 2.61 +/- 0.81 to 4.15 +/- 1.14 versus 2.30 +/- 0.87 to 2.52 +/- 0.59 mm Hg/L/min, p less than 0.01). DBcAMP treatment (200 micrograms/kg/min) after induction of HPV also significantly attenuated hypoxic pulmonary response (Ppa, 19.0 +/- 1.7 to 14.2 +/- 2.3 mm Hg, p less than 0.01; PVR, 3.92 +/- 0.39 to 2.34 +/- 0.34 mm Hg/L/min, p less than 0.01) without significant decreases in Psa and SVR. Pretreatment with DBcAMP (200 micrograms/kg/min) did not significantly alter pulmonary pressor responses to bolus injections of prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) (10 micrograms/kg) and norepinephrine (4 micrograms/kg). These results may suggest that intracellular augmentation of cyclic AMP plays a crucial role in modulating HPV.\r"

Increased levels of LTC4 and histamine were associated with significant decreases in the FEV1 for 3 of 4 aspirin-sensitive asthmatics who had both naso-ocular and bronchospastic reactions to aspirin. In contrast, no increase in LTC4 or histamine release was detected in aspirin-sensitive asthmatics who had only bronchospastic reactions to aspirin. No significant decreases in PGE2 levels or increases in LTB4 levels were detected during these reactions to relatively low doses of aspirin regardless of the clinical symptoms, nor was any increase in mediator release apparent in lavage fluids from normal donors, aspirin-insensitive asthmatics, and desensitized aspirin-sensitive subjects before or after various doses of aspirin. Levels of PGE2 decreased in nasal secretions from normal volunteers, aspirin-insensitive asthmatics, and desensitized aspirin-sensitive subjects after ingestion of 650 mg of aspirin. These decreases were not associated with increased LTC4 or LTB4 or with histamine release, decreased FEV1, or naso-ocular symptoms. In addition, reductions of PGE2 release were similar for normal and desensitized aspirin-sensitive volunteers (63 +/- 11 versus 61 +/- 10%, respectively). The data demonstrate that LTC4 and histamine are released into nasal secretions of aspirin-sensitive asthmatics with naso-ocular and bronchospastic reactions after ingestion of low doses of aspirin without a decrease in the levels of PGE2 and suggest that LTC4 and histamine contribute to the naso-ocular and bronchospastic symptoms characteristic of reactions to aspirin.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effects of neurokinin A (NKA) and neurokinin B (NKB), the mammalian-derived tachykinins, on the electrical and ion transport properties of canine tracheal epithelium. Both tachykinins dose-dependently increased short-circuit current (Isc) when added to the mucosal (NKA: delta Isc(max) = 24.2 +/- 2.4 microA/cm2, KD = 9 nM; NKB: delta Isc(max) = 1.42 +/- 2.2 microA/cm2, KD = 32 nM) or submucosal (NKA: delta Isc(max) = 10.5 +/- 1.2 microA/cm2, KD = 45 nM; NKB: delta Isc(max) = 2.2 +/- 1.4 microA/cm2, KD = 80 nM) bath. Isc responses to mucosal addition of tachykinins consisted of transient and subsequent steady-state components, whereas submucosal addition elicited only steady-state responses. Inhibition of Cl transport with bumetanide or substitution of Cl reduced the maximal changes in Isc. In paired tissues, NKA increased net 36Cl flux toward the mucosa from 1.83 +/- 0.49 to 2.71 +/- 0.46 mu eq.cm-2.h-1 (p less than 0.05), without affecting net 22Na flux toward the submucosa. The increases in Isc induced by tachykinins were not modified by prior tissue incubation with phentolamine, propranolol, atropine, tetrodotoxin, or indomethacin, but were effectively inhibited by (D-Pro2, D-Trp7,9)substance P. The cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels in the surface epithelium were increased by the addition of NKA and NKB. These findings suggest that NKA and NKB selectively stimulate the secretion of Cl across canine tracheal epithelium, probably by acting directly on the tachykinin receptors, and that these effects are associated with the increased production of intracellular cAMP.\r"

This study evaluated the effect of isotretinoin on serum levels of precursor and tissue-derived androgens. Twenty-four subjects (15 men and nine women) were treated for 20 weeks with 1 mg/kg/d of isotretinoin. Serum samples were obtained at baseline, 8, 16, and 24 weeks, and assayed for precursor androgens--total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (free T), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA-S); and tissue androgens--dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and its metabolite, 3 alpha-androstanediol glucuronide (3 alpha-diol G). Isotretinoin had no meaningful effects on precursor androgens, except for producing an elevation of free T in women. In contrast, isotretinoin produced depressions in the serum levels of DHT and 3 alpha-diol G in women and in 3 alpha-diol G in men. These decreases are believed to be the result, rather than the cause, of a reduction in the size of the sebaceous glands: The magnitude of the observed decreases may represent the amount of tissue-derived androgens that sebaceous glands normally contribute to the circulating pool.\r"

  ".W": "Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) reportedly increases protein break-down in skeletal muscle. The role of PGE2 for accelerated muscle proteolysis during sepsis, however, is controversial. In this study, the effect of the prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor indomethacin on PGE2 release and protein breakdown in skeletal muscle from nonseptic and septic rats was evaluated. Sepsis was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats (40-60 g) by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). After 16 hours the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and soleus (SOL) muscles were dissected with intact tendons and incubated in an oxygenated medium, and the release of tyrosine (protein breakdown) and PGE2 into the incubation medium was determined. Paired muscles were incubated in the absence or presence of indomethacin (3 mumol/L or 6 mumol/L). In some experiments the effect of indomethacin was investigated in the presence of different concentrations of insulin (1, 10, or 100 mU/mL) since previous reports suggested an interaction between insulin and prostaglandins on protein turnover in skeletal muscle. In other experiments muscles were incubated in a flaccid or stretched state, which is known to influence the metabolic response to different substances. Protein breakdown rate was 0.210 +/- 0.013 and 0.492 +/- 0.025 mumol Tyr/g X 2 hours in EDL from nonseptic and septic rats, respectively (p less than 0.01). The corresponding values for SOL were 0.480 +/- 0.037 and 0.712 +/- 0.039 mumol Tyr/g X 2 hours (p less than 0.01). Addition of indomethacin to the incubation medium reduced PGE2 release from 29.1 +/- 3.1 to 6.8 +/- 0.7 ng/g X 2 hours in nonseptic SOL and from 50.6 +/- 10.4 to 5.6 +/- 0.7 ng/g X 2 hours in septic SOL. Protein breakdown rate in SOL and EDL from sham-operated or septic rats was unaffected by indomethacin, both when muscles were incubated in a flaccid or stretched state, and when they were incubated in the presence or absence of insulin. The present results do not suggest a role of PGE2 for accelerated muscle proteolysis in the present experimental septic model.\r"

The concentration of 2,3-DPG was about half of the normal control value during a period of unrestricted daily activity but was further decreased to one third of normal after a one-day bed rest. Mild ergometric exercise rapidly increased the levels of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate plus glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, and 2,3-DPG in patients' circulating erythrocytes but did not in those of normal subjects. This indicated that a crossover point at the PFK step in glycolysis disappeared after physical exercise and, consequently, the 2,3-DPG concentration, which had decreased because of blockage of the PFK step, was restored considerably. This apparently exercise-related alteration in intermediary metabolism at the beginning of glycolysis was reproduced in vitro by incubating normal erythrocytes in the presence of inosine or ammonia, both of which have increased levels in circulating blood during and after exercise in this disorder. We conclude that physical activity in addition to a genetic deficiency in erythrocyte PFK affects glycolysis in erythrocytes in type VII glycogenosis and that myogenic factors released from exercising muscles may be responsible for this change.\r"

Changes in chromatin proteins have been described following inducer exposure. The significance of these changes, which are greatest in terminally differentiated cells remains unknown. Ubiquitin is a highly conserved 8.5 kilodalton peptide that is covalently linked to up to 10% of histone H2A. We demonstrate that following exposure of MEL cells to inducers of differentiation, a transient increase in ubiquitination of H2A occurs. This change is coincident with the onset of differentiation. This result suggests that ubiquitination of H2A may have a role in the nuclear changes necessary for erythroleukemic cell differentiation.\r"

We studied TGF-beta expression during megakaryoblastic differentiation of the chronic myeloid leukemia cell line K562 in vitro. These cells have mainly erythroid characteristics but acquire several megakaryoblastic properties when treated with the phorbol diester 12-0-tetradecanoyl-13-phorbolacetate (TPA). During four subsequent days of megakaryoblastic differentiation the amount of the 2.5-kilobase (kb) TGF-beta mRNA increased about eightfold, and a novel 2.3-kb mRNA species was induced in the K562 cells. This occurred concomitantly with distinct induction patterns of platelet-derived growth factor A (PDGF-A) and c-sis (PDGF-B chain) RNAs and several platelet antigens. The expression of erythroid markers such as glycophorin A decreased. Culture media of TPA-differentiated K562 cells also contained TGF-beta polypeptides as shown by a sensitive radioreceptor assay and by immunoprecipitation after metabolic labeling of the cells. These polypeptides were not seen in culture media from dimethyl sulfoxide- or sodium butyrate-treated cells. Unlike in several other cells, exogenously added TGF-beta 1 or 2 affected neither TGF-beta nor PDGF RNA expression in K562 cells.\r"

Proteolysis with the soluble thrombin-thrombomodulin complex proceeded normally and to completion as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blotting. Approximately one-third of the protein is functional, indicating a heterozygous defect. Indirect studies suggest that the abnormal component can bind to protein S and phospholipids. Both forms of activated protein C can also incorporate radiolabeled diisopropylfluorophosphate.\r"

Our series consisted of 158 children with newly diagnosed ALL. The mean follow-up time was 69 months (range 22 to 140 months). Blast clearance was significantly associated with length of event-free survival. Only two of nine children with blast clearance greater than or equal to 2 weeks and 4 of 11 children with blast clearance of 11 to 13 days were in remission at the time of analysis as compared with 86 of 138 of the children with more rapid blast clearance. The respective 5-year event-free survivals were 17%, 36%, and 60% (P = .003). Multivariate analysis showed that the relative risk of death or relapse in patients with blast clearance of greater than 10 days was 5.2-fold (95% confidence limits 2.1 to 13.1) as compared with the others (P less than .001). Our results indicate that patients with a slow response to treatment can be identified by simple differential peripheral cell counts during the early induction phase well before or even instead of performance of a more invasive bone marrow aspiration.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-five patients with acute myelogenous leukemia were treated with aclacinomycin A (60 mg/m2/day for 5 days) and VP-16-213 (100 mg/m2/day for 5 days). All were previously treated and had relapsed or were refractory to primary treatment. Most patients (28) had received prior DAT (daunorubicin, cytosine arabinoside, and 6-thioguanine) induction therapy followed by one or more courses of high-dose cytosine arabinoside (HD-Ara C) as consolidation therapy or as treatment for relapse. One patient was in her fourth relapse, one had relapsed acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (following remission with DAT and HD-Ara-C), one had a treatment-induced leukemia, and four patients were treated for primary treatment failures following two induction courses with DAT or a similar regimen. Fourteen patients had infections at start of therapy. Ten patients died within 14 days of treatment, all from sepsis or bleeding, before their marrow could be evaluated for leukemic response. Fourteen patients (40%) responded; 12 (34%) entered complete remission and two (6%) a partial remission (PR). Two of the four patients who were treated for primary treatment failures went into CR. The median CR duration was 99 days (range 30 to 455 days). Side effects from this treatment were similar to the conventional DAT regimen, although the gastrointestinal toxicity and mucositis appeared to be more severe. In addition, two of the patients had severe but reversible ventricular arrhythmias. The overall response (40%) and CR rate (34%) in this group of previously treated AML patients is encouraging, and further studies are needed to evaluate these preliminary findings.\r"

Aspirin provided no meaningful amelioration of side effects compared to our prior experience of IFN-alpha 2A alone. Interestingly, the objective response rate of 34% (10/29) was considerably higher than the 15% recently reported from an aggregate of 344 patients participating in 14 prospective clinical trials. In light of small numbers, subtle selection biases, and the well-recognized hazards of retrospective analyses, currently it is unclear if the apparent therapeutic advantage from ASA plus IFN-alpha 2A reflects chance occurrence or therapeutic potentiation from ASA. A randomized trial is planned to determine if ASA may have enhanced the efficacy of IFN-alpha 2A in patients with advanced RCC.\r"

IRE and CA 19-9 were further assayed in nonpancreatic malignancies (n = 98) and chronic nonmalignant disease (n = 194). In pancreatic cancer, elevated values were observed for amylase in 30% of the patients, for IRE in 70%, for CEA in 28%, and for CA 19-9 in 68%. Elevation of IRE and/or CA 19-9 was found in 95% of the 40 patients. Elevated serum IRE was observed more frequently in head cancer and resectable cancer, whereas elevation in CA 19-9 occurred more often in body-tail cancer and unresectable cancer. Elevation of serum IRE tends to occur at earlier stages of pancreatic cancer. No one test is adequate for the accurate diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. However, the two assays complement each other, and their combined use would provide a sensitive clue for tentative diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.\r"

Transforming growth factors have been found in tumor extracts and in the urine of cancer patients. The specific questions of our study were whether TGF activity can be detected in malignant effusions, how different assays for TGF correlate with each other, and how assays for TGF correlate with soft agar tumor colony formation as measured by the human tumor cloning assay (HTCA). The TGF activity was measured by a normal rat kidney transformation assay (NRKA), a 125I-EGF radioreceptor assay (RRA), and a radioimmunoassay (RIA) for TGF-alpha. Cells from effusions were cytologically examined and plated in the HTCA. A total of 104 effusions from cancer patients and 17 effusions from non-cancer patients was tested. Transforming growth factor activity was detected in some specimens. Only the TGF-alpha RIA and the HTCA showed significant differences between cancer and noncancer patients. Immunoreactive TGF-alpha was measurable in some cases by RIA even when cytologic testing failed to detect malignant cells. Spearman correlations between assays indicated that RIA results correlate significantly with all other assays. It is concluded that TGF-alpha activity might be important for in vitro colony formation of human tumor cells.\r"

  ".W": "Type IV glycogenosis is due to branching enzyme deficiency and is usually manifested clinically by progressive liver disease with cirrhosis and hepatic failure between the second and fourth years of life. We describe a 5-year-old boy who, following an acute febrile illness at 2 years of age, was first noted to have hepatomegaly with mildly elevated serum transaminase levels. Liver biopsy revealed hepatic fibrosis with periodic-acid Schiff-positive, diastase-resistant inclusions in hepatocytes and fibrillar inclusions characteristic of amylopectin by electron microscopy. Enzymatic assay revealed deficient hepatic branching enzyme activity with normal activity of glucose-6-phosphatase, debranching enzyme and phosphorylase activities. During the succeeding 3 years, he grew and developed normally with apparent resolution of any clinical evidence of liver disease and only intermittent elevation in serum transaminase levels associated with fever and prolonged fasting. Repeat liver biopsy at 4 years of age showed persistence of scattered hepatocellular periodic-acid Schiff-positive, diastase-resistant inclusions, but no progression of hepatic fibrosis in spite of persistent deficiency of hepatic branching enzyme activity. Skeletal muscle and skin fibroblasts from the patient also showed deficient enzyme activity. Skin fibroblasts from both parents exhibited half the normal control activity, suggesting a heterozygote state. This is the first documented patient with deficiency of branching enzyme but without evidence of progressive hepatic disease. This patient, coupled with reports of other patients with late onset hepatic or muscle disease with branching enzyme deficiency, suggests that the defect resulting in Type IV glycogen storage disease is more heterogenous and possibly more common than previously suspected.\r"

End-tidal CO2 was held constant by an electronic servocontroller which adjusted ventilator rate; ventilator rate was monitored as an index of CO2 production. Rectal temperature was maintained at 39.0 +/- 0.2 degrees C. The effects on PMO of intravenous and brain ventricular injections of NaCl and agents active in the prostaglandin cascade were compared. Intravenous (0.25-1.0 mg/kg, n = 9) and brain (5-33 micrograms/kg, n = 6) indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, doubled PMO within 30 min. Intravenous (1-10 micrograms/kg, n = 6) and brain (1-40 micrograms/kg, n = 6) prostaglandin E1 inhibited PMO by one-half at 10 and 30 min.\r"

  ".U": "88187379\r", 
  ".W": "In a previous study, potent tumor cytolysis mediated by human neutrophil peptide defensins occurred slowly over 3 to 15 h. Because these kinetics suggested a requirement for target cell metabolic processes before tumor killing could be realized, the mechanism of lysis by these purified peptides was further investigated. 125I-labeled defensin bound extensively to peptide-sensitive K562 targets with biphasic kinetics. Binding was inhibited in parallel with cytotoxicity when both assays were performed at low temperature or in the presence of FCS. The albumin content of serum could account for the inhibitory effects of FCS. Cytotoxicity was also antagonized by agents that interfered with target cell energy metabolism (azide and 2-deoxyglucose), the cytoskeletal apparatus (cytochalasin B and dihydrocytochalasin B), lysosomal function (NH4Cl and chloraquin), or calmodulin-mediated activities (trifluoperazine). FCS also completely removed membrane-bound defensin when it was added after 5 min of binding at 37 degrees C. However, significantly less defensin was removed when FCS was added at later time points after binding was initiated. Cytochalasin B and azide/2-deoxyglucose did not prevent binding of defensin to targets but it significantly inhibited the development of FCS resistance in membrane-bound peptide. However, these two classes of inhibitors acted during distinct time windows: cytochalasin-sensitive events were complete by 1 h, whereas azide/2-deoxyglucose continued to be inhibitory when added as late as 2 h after defensins. These latter data indicated that critical energy-dependent events continue after the cytochalasin-sensitive phase has been completed. The results suggest that defensin-mediated cytotoxicity requires initial binding of defensin molecules to targets and subsequent cytoskeletal- and energy-dependent translocation or internalization. Although the defensins are low m.w. peptides, the initial processes required for their cytotoxic activity resemble those of more complex bacterial, plant and mammalian cytotoxins.\r"

For the primary vaccination recombinant vaccinia virus (V25) expressing the complete gp160 env protein of the HTLV-IIIB strain of HIV-1 was introduced by scarification. This elicited a weak primary response which we subsequently attempted to enhance by additional immunizations (boosting), using four different immunization protocols. We report here that intravenous injection of paraformaldehyde-fixed autologous cells infected in vitro with V25 (individual D.Z.) gave the best results. This individual received second and third boosts of intramuscular gp160 derived from an HTLV-IIIB clone using the hybrid vaccinia virus/bacteriophage T7 expression system. An anamnestic humoral and cellular immune reaction was achieved for over one year after the original vaccination, with high levels of antibodies to the viral envelope, and neutralizing antibodies against divergent HIV-1 strains such as HTLV-IIIB and HTLV-IIIRF (also called HTLV-III HAT) after the first boost. In addition, group-specific cell-mediated immunity and cell-mediated cytotoxicity against infected T4 cells were obtained after the primary vaccine and enhanced by the boosts. Finally, skin tests showed both immediate and delayed hypersensitivity to gp160 in vivo. Although this protocol is not practical for a large scale vaccine trial, our results show for the first time that an immune state against HIV can be obtained in man.\r"

The degree of CA 125 elevation did not correlate with lesion size or weight. Elevated levels were often associated with benign secondary pathology such as endometriosis. Incorporating an age cutoff arbitrarily set at 50 years helped to interpret an elevated CA 125 level. Our findings suggest that an elevated serum CA 125 level by itself does not sufficiently distinguish benign from malignant masses preoperatively.\r"

To determine the range and severity of medical complications encountered in younger anorectic and bulimic patients, we reviewed the medical records of 65 adolescents and preadolescents, aged 10 to 20 years, who were observed in the Eating Disorders Clinic of the Children's Hospital at Stanford. Significant medical instability was present in the majority of our patients. A total of 55% of anorectic patients and 22% of bulimic patients required hospitalization for medical reasons during the study period. Cardiovascular abnormalities were frequent, including bradycardia, prolonged corrected QT intervals, dysrhythmias, and marked orthostatic pulse and BP instability. Hypothermia, with temperatures less than 35.5 degrees C, was common. Renal abnormalities included pyuria, hematuria, and proteinuria. Electrolyte derangements occurred in patients who vomited or purged. Hypokalemia was most common, but hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia were also noted. The majority of our pediatric patients with eating disorders had evidence of physiologic derangement requiring medical intervention. The need for adolescents and preadolescents with eating disorders to receive ongoing medical monitoring in concert with psychiatric treatment and the need for therapists and medical practitioners to become familiar with the potential medical sequelae of eating disorders are underscored by our data.\r"

  ".W": "The cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) of cattle retinal rod outer segments comprises three types of subunits: the two heavy catalytic ones, PDE alpha and PDE beta, each around 85 kDa, and the light inhibitory one, PDE gamma or I (11 kDa). The relative stoichiometry is usually assumed to be 1:1:1. PDE activation in the visual transduction cascade results from removal of the inhibitor by the alpha subunit of transducin (T alpha). The stoichiometric complex T alpha-I, separated from activated PDE, has been isolated and characterized. Analyzing now the activated PDE, we find that it still contains some inhibitor and is resolvable into two species, one with 50% of the inhibitor content of the native enzyme and the other totally devoid of it. The same two species are observed upon activation of PDE by very short tryptic proteolysis, which specifically degrades the inhibitor. This leads us to conclude that the composition of the native enzyme is PDE alpha beta-I2. The two inhibitory subunits are differentially bound, sequentially removable, and exchangeable between the native complex PDE alpha beta-I2 and the fully active PDE alpha beta. The possibility of this exchange precludes as yet an unambiguous estimate of the actual activity of the intermediate complex PDE alpha beta-I. The differential binding and the exchangeability of the inhibitors raises the possibility of a fast, diffusion controlled, switch-off mechanism of PDE activity after a flash, which would shortcut the inactivation resulting from the slow GTPase rate of transducin.\r"

The FASTA program is a more sensitive derivative of the FASTP program, which can be used to search protein or DNA sequence data bases and can compare a protein sequence to a DNA sequence data base by translating the DNA data base as it is searched. FASTA includes an additional step in the calculation of the initial pairwise similarity score that allows multiple regions of similarity to be joined to increase the score of related sequences. The RDF2 program can be used to evaluate the significance of similarity scores using a shuffling method that preserves local sequence composition. The LFASTA program can display all the regions of local similarity between two sequences with scores greater than a threshold, using the same scoring parameters and a similar alignment algorithm; these local similarities can be displayed as a \"graphic matrix\" plot or as individual alignments. In addition, these programs have been generalized to allow comparison of DNA or protein sequences based on a variety of alternative scoring matrices.\r"

The indications for tonsillectomy in certain clinical situations are constantly being debated in the literature and among professionals. We studied the efficacy (or lack of it) of adenotonsillectomy for chronic tonsillitis (recurrent throat infections), oral nasal obstruction, peritonsillar abscess, elimination of a bacterial carrier state, biopsy, and prevention of tongue thrusting with resultant anterior open bite. Adenoidectomy has been advocated in the literature for the treatment of nasal obstruction, sinusitis, and chronic serous otitis media. Complications of tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy include hemorrhage, anesthetic death, infection, nasopharyngeal stenosis, patulous eustachian tube, and hypernasality. Children at risk for hypernasality are those with mental retardation, cerebral palsy, neuromuscular disorders, and submucous cleft of the soft palate. Because of the severity of the complications that can be encountered in any child, medical and conservative therapy should be attempted before operation is done. Proper antibiotic therapy will often control chronic serous otitis, sinusitis, and chronic, recurrent tonsillitis. Bacterial synergy is important to consider when selecting antibiotic therapy, since beta-lactamase production may protect pathogens commonly considered susceptible to standard antibiotic therapy.\r"

In infant and regenerating bone marrow (BM), 41.5% +/- 4.0% of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT+) cells were Ki67+, and 30.0% +/- 4.0% incorporated BrdU. A similar proportion of TdT+ dividing cells was observed in adult BM. The proliferative activity of the B cell progenitors reached the peak at the pre-B stage: 80.8% +/- 7.6% and 35.3% +/- 6.1% of c mu +, RFB7- cells were Ki67+ and BrdU+, respectively. In contrast, greater than 95% of surface immunoglobulin-positive BM lymphocytes were resting cells. In infant thymus the highest dividing capacity (95% Ki67+, 60% to 90% BrdU+) was observed in large cortical thymocytes (TdT+, CD1-, cCD3+), and TdT+, CD1+ cortical thymocytes also showed a high proliferative activity (74.3% +/- 2.3% Ki67+, 22.0% +/- 1.0% BrdU+), but TdT-, mCD3+ thymic lymphocytes were mainly resting cells (less than 5% Ki67+, less than 1% BrdU+). The proliferative activity of null and common ALL blasts was significantly lower than that of normal BM TdT+ cells (15.5% +/- 4.2% Ki67+, 6.2% +/- 2.1% BrdU+; P less than .001). Dividing ALL blasts were TdT+ and expressed surface antigens detected by CD10 and/or CD19 antibodies. In T cell-ALL, the percentages of Ki67+ and BrdU+ blasts were also lower than those found in the corresponding normal immature thymocytes (13.0% +/- 3.1% and 2.4% +/- 1.3%, respectively; P less than .001). Thus, ALLs derive from actively proliferating lymphoid precursors but have a lower dividing capacity than the corresponding normal cell types. In ALL cases with heterogeneous expression of markers such as cmu and CD1, dividing blasts were distributed among both negative and positive populations, thus indicating that blasts with signs of differentiation also remain within the dividing pool.\r"

  ".U": "88193344\r", 
  ".W": "A murine monoclonal antibody (GA3) obtained by immunizing mice with cells of the human erythroleukemic cell line K562 is shown to define a 105 kilodalton (kd) membrane antigen on K562 cells that is restricted within the hematopoietic system to the erythroid lineage and to a minor population of CD3, CD4 positive T lymphocytes. Cocapping studies and immunoprecipitation experiments performed with GA3 and L10, an anti-sialophorin monoclonal antibody reacting with leukosialin (Gp 105) on K562 cells, demonstrate that the antigen detected by GA3 on K562 cells is identical to leukosialin. Neuraminidase treatment but not tunicamycin treatment of K562 cells abolishes the expression of the GA3-epitope without affecting the L10-epitope thus providing evidence that terminal sialic acid present on O-linked oligosaccharide chains on Gp 105 is essential for the expression of the GA3-epitope. Further analysis by flow cytometry and immune panning experiments performed on bone marrow cells with GA3 or L10 demonstrate that, in contrast to L10, which reacts with all types of hematopoietic progenitors, the epitope recognized by GA3 is restricted to the erythroid lineage, and appears during erythroid differentiation before glycophorin A on the earliest morphologically recognizable erythroid precursor, the proerythroblast. Our results therefore suggest that O-linked oligosaccharides on leukosialin express lineage restricted and even maturation restricted antigenic structures that might serve as cell lineage specific markers.\r"

  ".W": "The role of endothelium in the inhibition of human factor Xa was studied in a plasma environment. Human factor Xa can bind to and function on bovine aortic endothelium in a manner similar to that of bovine factor Xa. Approximately 70% of the bound factor Xa is subject to inhibition by plasma proteinase inhibitors, and the remaining 30% is irreversibly bound as part of a 125 Kd membrane-associated complex not subject to proteolytic degradation. The proportion reversibly bound and its rate of release do not alter with changes in calcium, citrate, heparin, or active proteinase inhibitor concentrations. The principal plasma proteinase inhibitor of human factor Xa was antithrombin III, which accounted for 60% to 65% of factor Xa released from endothelium, with alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor inactivating 20% to 25% and alpha 2-macroglobulin approximately 15%. All of the reversibly bound factor Xa was identified in complex with one of these three proteinase inhibitors. The thrombin active-site inhibitor hirudin was found to markedly accelerate the displacement of reversibly bound factor Xa from the endothelium and to associate specifically with factor Xa without a loss of activity toward chromogenic substrates, perhaps accounting for a novel mechanism of anticoagulation.\r"

  ".W": "Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1)-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients consistently show a rearrangement in a 5.8-kilobase length of chromosome 22, referred to as the breakpoint cluster region (bcr). In Ph1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the breakpoint in chromosome 22 is more heterogeneous and, in some instances, does not occur within this region. In such cases the cell of origin of the neoplastic clone and the relationship of the disease to CML has remained obscure. We have analyzed the bcr rearrangement in the malignant cells from three patients who presented with Ph1-positive ALL and who in cytogenetic studies had shown evidence of variable involvement of myeloid cells in the Ph1-positive clone. Rearrangements in bcr typical of most cases of CML were detected in purified granulocyte preparations from two of the ALL patients (nos. 1 and 2) and in the blasts from patient 3 at the time of her terminal relapse. In the same analysis the simultaneously obtained granulocytes from patient 3, however, did not show any evidence of bcr rearrangement. Patient 3 was also heterozygous for the BamHI polymorphism in the X-linked hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene, thus permitting a different method of clonal analysis based on methylation differences in active and inactive alleles. When DNA from her granulocytes that had shown no bcr rearrangement was hybridized to an HPRT probe, a pattern typical of a polyclonal population was seen. A similar pattern was exhibited by her marrow fibroblasts. In marked contrast, her simultaneously isolated blasts showed an unambiguous monoclonal pattern. These findings demonstrate the origin of the disease in the first two patients in a cell with myelopoietic as well as lymphopoietic potential and confirm the restricted lymphoid cell origin of the neoplastic clone in the third Ph1-positive ALL patient. Furthermore, they indicate that different target cells for transformation within the hematopoietic system may be affected by very similar bcr rearrangements.\r"

Elevated concentrations of CA 19-9 (12.9%) and CA 50 (35.2%) were also found in a number of cases with benign disease, especially in patients with obstructive jaundice. These data suggest that both CA 19-9 and CA 50 can be useful markers of pancreatic cancer in nonjaundiced patients.

The ocular anomaly, which characteristically is multiple, benign, and congenital, was studied in three groups. Group 1 contained eight patients with nonpolyposis colon cancer as disease controls. All had negative eye findings. Group 2 included 40 patients with FAP, 35 (87.5 percent) of whom had retinal lesions. Twenty-two of 25 patients with FAP alone had retinal lesions while 13 of 15 patients with FAP and extracolonic manifestations were similarly affected. Group 3 included 11 offspring at risk for FAP. Eight (72.7 percent) offspring had retinal lesions. One of the eight subjects with the ocular trait was subsequently diagnosed with FAP. Two of the eight patients also had other ECM but have not been sigmoidoscoped for FAP. Seven of 11 offspring (mean age, 12.5 years) have had negative flexible sigmoidoscopy. Specificity of the retinal lesions in FAP cannot be ascertained until subsequent adenomas are identified on follow-up of the group at risk. The gene responsible for CHRPE appears to be transmitted from one generation to another, demonstrated by the high sensitivity of the retinal lesions in patients with FAP alone and with other ECM.\r"

  ".W": "Interdigestive motility of the small intestine was examined in 23 fasted healthy volunteers following luminal administration of the prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha. Motility was monitored by means of water-perfused catheters measuring intraluminal pressure changes. The registration points were located 25 cm apart, in the proximal duodenum, at the angle of Treitz, and in the jejunum. Prostaglandin E2 administered intraduodenally delayed the initiation of the subsequent activity front. The interval to the next activity front was prolonged by a dose of 1.0 mg prostaglandin E2 from 79.5 +/- 9.5 min to 137.1 +/- 5.0 min (P less than 0.01) and to 158.0 +/- 14.0 min by 2.0 mg prostaglandin E2 (P less than 0.05). Also, in four of seven experiments, a progressing activity front was arrested by 2.0 mg prostaglandin E2. Prostaglandin F2 alpha at 2.5 or 5.0 mg given intraduodenally induced bursts of contractions with a frequency of 17.7 +/- 0.8 contractions per minute and an amplitude of 10 to 110 mm Hg (P less than 0.01). In comparison, food intake produced irregular contractions at a frequency of 5.3 +/- 1.8 contractions per minute and an amplitude of 10 to 50 mm Hg (P less than 0.05). It is concluded that prostaglandin E2 delays the initiation of activity fronts in the duodenum. In contrast, prostaglandin F2 alpha changes the interdigestive motility pattern to one of intense contractile activity, which is different from the postprandial motility pattern.\r"

T3 sulfotransferase (T3-ST) activity was characterized in normal human liver tissue obtained during clinically indicated surgical resection. Subcellular distribution studies showed that the T3-ST activity was localized to the cytoplasmic fraction. This finding raised the possibility that T3-ST activity might be similar to the 2 previously identified forms of cytoplasmic phenol sulfotransferase (PST) found in human tissue. A thermostable (TS) form of PST catalyzes the sulfate conjugation of micromolar concentrations of p-nitrophenol, and a thermolabile (TL) form catalyzes the sulfate conjugation of dopamine and other monoamines. Thermal stability and enzyme inhibitor experiments showed that T3-ST activity in pooled liver homogenates was very similar to the TS form of PST. The apparent similarity of T3-ST to TS PST was studied further by measuring T3-ST, TS PST, and TL PST activities in 20 individual liver samples. T3-ST activities correlated significantly with TS PST activities (r = 0.939; P less than 0.001) measured with p-nitrophenol, but not with TL PST activities (r = -0.118; P greater than 0.6) measured with dopamine. However, sulfation of T3 by the TL form of the enzyme might have been masked by the 18-fold higher specific activity of TS than TL PST in human liver homogenates. When the two forms of PST were separated by ion exchange chromatography, T3 was found to be a substrate for both the TS and TL forms of PST. \"True\" Km values for T3 were similar for TS and TL PST (81 and 127 microM, respectively).\r"

  ".U": "88195951\r", 
  ".W": "The transient steroidogenic response of the macaque corpus luteum to chronic human CG (hCG) treatment beginning on days 9-10 of the luteal phase (i.e. stimulated early pregnancy) is associated with decreased numbers and affinity of available receptors for gonadotropin and homologous desensitization of adenylate cyclase. This study determined if similar changes in the receptor-adenylate cyclase system accompany the persistent steroidogenic response which occurs when hCG treatment begins earlier in the luteal phase. Female rhesus monkeys received increasing doses of hCG (15 up to 5760 LU) twice daily beginning 5-6 days after the midcycle LH surge. The levels of circulating progesterone increased (P less than 0.05) within 24 h of initial hCG exposure and did not decrease throughout the 10-day regimen. The corpus luteum was removed after 0 (n = 8), 6 (n = 4), or 10 (n = 4) days of hCG treatment. Whereas the numbers of available [125I]hCG binding sites in luteal particulates remained unchanged by 10 days of hCG exposure, the dissociation constant (Kd) for gonadotropin binding was greater than at day 0 (6.17 +/- 1.41 vs. 0.91 +/- 0.06 X 10(-10) M, P less than 0.05). Since the number of binding sites occupied by injected hCG increased with treatment (7.81 +/- 1.55 fmol/mg wet wt at day 10), the total number (available + occupied) of gonadotropin receptors was 3-fold greater (P less than 0.05) at day 10 than at day 0. Adenylate cyclase activity in luteal homogenates, assessed by conversion of [alpha-32P]ATP to [32P]cAMP, was stimulated on day 0 by hCG (2.7 +/- 0.7 X control, at 250 nM hCG), prostaglandin E2 (2.5 + 0.5 X control, at 0.5 mM), and prostaglandin I2 (2.3 +/- 0.5 X control at 0.5 mM) as well as forskolin (100 microM) and 5'-guanylyl-imidodiphosphate (50 microM). In contrast, cAMP production by day 6 of treatment was insensitive to hCG, but remained responsive to prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin I2, and nonhormonal activators. We conclude that CG treatment in the early luteal phase did not prevent the development of gonadotropin receptors to levels typically observed in the functional corpus luteum of the menstrual cycle. Also, many changes in the gonadotropin receptor-adenylate cyclase system in macaque luteal tissue were similar after CG treatment beginning on days 5-6 or days 9-10 of the luteal phase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The processing of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) by MG-63, an IGF-I-responsive human osteosarcoma cell line, has been investigated. At 37 C, the binding of [125I] IGF-I to monolayers of MG-63 cells reaches a maximum after about 1 h and slowly declines thereafter. The addition of the lysosomotropic agents methylamine, chloroquine, and monensin to the binding medium prevents the decline in [125I]IGF-I binding observed in the untreated cells and causes a 1.5- to 3-fold increase in cell-associated radioactivity after 4 h. Leupeptin, an inhibitor of lysosomal proteases, and colchicine, an inhibitor of endosomal transport, also increase cell-associated [125I]IGF-I. Three observations indicate that the increased radioactivity associated with the treated cells is the result of intracellular accumulation of the ligands and not the result of an increase in cell surface IGF binding. First, no increase in [125I]IGF-I binding is observed in cells preincubated with methylamine at 37 C but transferred to 4 C (where endocytosis is inhibited) before the addition of the radiolabeled ligands. Second, the increased radioactivity bound by methylamine-treated cells is not removed by washing the cells with dilute acid, a treatment that removes surface-bound [125I]IGF-I. Third, in leupeptin-treated cells [125I]IGF-I accumulates in a subcellular fraction with properties characteristic of lysosomes. Both alpha IR-3 (100 nM), an antibody that specifically inhibits binding to the type I IGF receptor, and high concentrations of insulin (900 nM) inhibit the accumulation of [125I]IGF-I by methylamine-treated cells, indicating that internalization of IGF-I occurs through the type I IGF receptor and not through the type II IGF receptor or the IGF-binding protein(s) that is also present on these cells. These results demonstrate that in MG-63 cells IGF-I is endocytosed via the type I IGF receptor and that the endocytosed hormone is degraded, at least in part, in lysosomes. These findings are similar to those described for the processing of insulin and other growth factors by their target cells and extend further the homology between IGF-I and these other agents.\r"

In ROS 17/2.8 and its subclone G2, dexamethasone stimulated collagen and noncollagen protein synthesis, with a concomitant decrease in the DNA content of the cells. These data indicate that ROS cell lines are phenotypically heterogeneous and suggest that in normal bone there may be distinct subpopulations of osteoblasts with varying phenotypic traits with respect to the regulation of protein synthesis.\r"

In the present study the effect of pH variations on both antibody-antigen binding and the immunologic stability of the antigen were evaluated for the radioimmunoassay of carcinoembryonic antigen, CA19-9, tissue polypeptide antigen, and ferritin. A significant inhibition of antibody-antigen binding was constantly found in acidic conditions. Antigen concentration was lower in acidified than in untreated samples, possibly due to the carryover of acidity in the incubation mixture. Neutralization of acidified samples partly improved recovery of carcinoembryonic antigen and CA19-9. Tissue polypeptide antigen and ferritin were not recovered by neutralization in samples with pH less than 4.5, suggesting an irreversible damage of the immunologic characteristics of the two antigens. From the present data we conclude that an accurate validation of methods and a rigorous standardization of sample collection are mandatory for tumor marker determination by radioimmunoassay in gastric juice.\r"

  ".W": "This study was performed to further identify the sequence of cell kinetics that occurs in the development of gastric and intestinal epithelial hyperplasia after orally administered prostaglandins of the E series. A high-dose, short-treatment schedule was used to examine the initial effects on kinetic parameters in the rat small intestinal epithelium. Groups of rats were killed after a single dose of oral prostaglandin E2 at 1 h after in vivo labeling with [methyl-3H]thymidine and during continued treatment at 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. As evidenced by autoradiography, the earliest change produced by prostaglandin E2 was an increased cellularity of the villous compartment (p less than 0.05 after 24 h). There was no change of labeling index of the villous compartment or of the leading edge of labeled cells within 24 h. At 48 h, the increased cellularity was accompanied by a significantly elevated labeling index of the villi. Throughout the study period no significant differences were observed between groups in the number of cells or labeling indices in the jejunal crypts, or in cellular input from the crypts to the villi. Epithelial turnover time in the placebo and treatment groups was 69 and 71 h, respectively. To exclude the possibility that prostaglandin E2 initially affects cell birth rate and mean cell cycle time, a metaphase blocker was given after 4 days of treatment in a second study. Animals were killed after 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.5 h. The rate of entry into mitoses was 8.1% cells/h in controls compared with 8.2% cells/h in treated rats. The distribution of mitoses within crypts was identical in the two groups and the mean cell cycle time was 13.6 and 13.2 h, respectively. Also in this study there were trophic changes of the villi. It is concluded that the hyperplasia produced by oral prostaglandin E2 starts in the villi of the small intestine and is initiated by reduced cell exfoliation from the villous tips. Previously recorded retention of cellular elements in villi and crypts, increased cellularity of the proliferative compartments, and reduced mitotic index are secondary events.\r"

Similar to native somatostatin, serosal addition of this compound inhibits electrogenic anion secretion and stimulates neutral sodium and chloride absorption. Both compounds have similar maximal effects on ion transport; however, the ED50 of SMS 201-995 (2.4 X 10(-10) M) was 60 times less than that for somatostatin. In addition, unlike somatostatin, no inherent tachyphylaxis was observed in response to SMS 201-995. The antisecretory profile of SMS 201-995 was also compared with that of epinephrine. Unlike treatment with epinephrine, pretreatment of tissues with SMS 201-995 did not directly inhibit electrogenic anion secretion stimulated by vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, calcium ionophore A23187, and bethanechol. In contrast, this agent blocked vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and bethanechol inhibition of net sodium absorption. We conclude that SMS 201-995 has several unique in vitro properties that may explain its greater biologic activity compared with that of somatostatin. Its effects on secretagogue-stimulated electrogenic anion secretion and electroneutral NaCl absorption appear to differ.\r"

After incubation, the tissue levels of cAMP and the medium concentrations of progesterone (P) were determined, while the concentration of P was analyzed after superfusion. PGE2 stimulated cAMP formation in CL from all phases of the menstrual cycle as well as from early pregnancy and caused an increase in P formation in CL from the early and midluteal phases of the menstrual cycle as well as from early pregnancy. A difference was found in the latency, the lag phase until maximal response, and the duration of response between the effects of PGE2 and hCG on both cAMP and P formation. Thus, the effect of PGE2 started more rapidly and was of shorter duration than that of hCG. The stimulatory effect of PGE2 on CL from early pregnancy was of the same magnitude as that of CL from the menstrual cycle. On the other hand, hCG had less stimulatory effect on cAMP and P formation in CL from early pregnancy compared to CL from the menstrual cycle. We conclude that PGE2 stimulates P and cAMP formation in isolated human CL from all phases of the menstrual cycle as well as in early pregnancy, indicating a luteotropic effect of this PG.\r"

HMFG1 and HMFG2 were the most reactive of all the antibodies; NS19-9 and OC125 were expressed by different populations of cells.

Involved epidermis contained increased numbers of OKT6+HLA-DR+ Langerhans cells and a variable number of OKM5+ epidermal cells (ECs) in all mycosis fungoides (MF) patients tested (N = 14). The OKM5+ EC population from involved epidermis of MF patients were heterogeneous and comprised both OKM5+HLe1- keratinocytes and OKM5+HLe1+ leukocytes. Uninvolved epidermis, in 6 of 14 patients with MF, contained a small number of OKM5+ leukocytes; however, no OKM5+ keratinocytes were detected. Neither OKM5+ leukocytes nor OKM5+ keratinocytes were detected in the epidermis obtained from healthy controls. The increased number of potential antigen-presenting cells, that is, OKT6+HLA-DR+ Langerhans cells and OKM5+HLA-DR+ monocytic leukocytes, in the epidermis of patients with MF may be important for the activation of abnormal T cells contained within the epidermis of these patients. Such activated T cells may release gamma-interferon and induce expression of both HLA-DR and OKM5 antigens on keratinocytes. OKM5+ keratinocytes are present in the epidermis of patients with MF, but not in normal skin, and may thus play a role in the pathogenetic mechanisms of mycosis fungoides by recruitment of immunocompetent cells to the epidermis.\r"

Prior to surgery, five patients were nasal breathers, five were predominantly nasal breathers, six were oral-nasal breathers, and four were predominantly oral breathers. Nine patients had inadequate nasal airways. Six months following surgery, 14 patients were nasal breathers and six were predominantly nasal breathers. Sixteen patients had adequate nasal airways, three had borderline nasal airways and one had an inadequate nasal airway postsurgically. These findings suggest that superior repositioning of the maxilla by Le Fort I down fracture does not adversely affect nasal respiration.

Tolazoline and dopamine were used to treat some of the patients. No patients had congenital heart disease or sepsis. Catheters were placed to measure pulmonary and systemic arterial blood pressures. PGD2 was infused intravenously at doses of 1 to 25 micrograms/kg/min. Pulmonary and systemic arterial blood pressures, heart rate, and descending aortic blood gas values were measured before each dose change. Only two of six patients had a transient increase in PaO2. All had an increase in heart rate. Two of six patients had an increase in pulmonary arterial blood pressure. No deleterious effects occurred during the infusion. Four of six patients subsequently died. Although PGD2 is a specific pulmonary vasodilator in fetal and newborn animals, it did not lower pulmonary arterial blood pressure nor improve oxygenation in newborn infants with persistent pulmonary hypertension syndrome.\r"

Since kappa agonists specifically increase urine output, the interaction between CATH and U50 on this physiological function was also evaluated. Acutely, CATH produced anorexia and diuresis, whereas water intake was not affected. U50 resulted in an increase in both food and water intake as well as urine output. After 9 days of daily CATH, tolerance to its anorectic effects had developed. In addition, water intake, which was not affected acutely by CATH, was significantly enhanced with respect to controls treated daily with water. In a group treated chronically with U50, its diuretic effect was unchanged, but water intake was no longer increased after 9 days of treatment. Food intake in this group remained higher than control intake for at least 19 days, but this hyperphagic effect was not detectable on day 34. On days 10 and 20 of the chronic regimen, the administration of U50 to the chronic CATH group resulted in a doubling of the hyperphagic response to U50, and this effect was naloxone-reversible. Water intake was also increased but to a lesser extent. The diuretic effect of U50 did not appear to be influenced by chronic CATH administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The febrile response to rHu-TNF, unlike lipopolysaccharide, did not decrease after a single or two consecutive doses. A significant reduction in the febrile response, however, was seen after four consecutive doses starting from 7 days after the second dose; the febrile response 3 hr after rHu-TNF was much smaller, but the first peak was hardly smaller. Low anti-rHu-TNF levels were found in serum of rabbits treated repeatedly with rHu-TNF, suggesting that antibody production against rHu-TNF is not responsible for the tolerance formation although it may make some contribution. There was no cross-tolerance between rHu-TNF and lipopolysaccharide. On the other hand, the febrile response to rHu-TNF (33 micrograms/kg i.v.) was inhibited partially or completely blocked by i.v. administration of cyclooxygenase inhibitors or dexamethasone. rHu-TNF produced a marked increase in the cerebrospinal fluid prostaglandin E2 level after bolus i.v. injection. A significant level of rHu-TNF (1.6 and 6.4% of that in serum) was found in cerebrospinal fluid after bolus i.v. injection of 33 and 1000 micrograms/kg, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

While many patients with testicular involvement by acute lymphoblastic leukemia have enlarged or firm testes, clinical examination alone is insufficient to establish or exclude the diagnosis completely. Open biopsy generally has been used to document the presence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, this procedure requires general anesthesia and hospitalization. We studied 11 patients with a history and/or physical findings suspicious for testicular acute lymphoblastic leukemia relapse to determine the efficacy of fine needle aspiration cytology in the evaluation of the testes for leukemic infiltration. Of the 11 patients fine needle aspiration cytology correctly identified all 5 patients with histologically proved testicular acute lymphoblastic leukemia, it was negative in 5 with no histological evidence of leukemia and it demonstrated rare atypical cells that were not evident on subsequent histological examination in 1. No adverse effects were encountered in this series. Fine needle aspiration cytology appears to be a safe, reproducible alternative to open biopsy in the evaluation of patients for testicular relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.\r"

In noninvasive carcinoma absence of marker chromosomes (abnormal morphological forms) forecasts a 90 per cent post-resection cure. In submucosal invasive carcinoma marker chromosomes are valuable prognostic aids. Original marker chromosomes are neither replaced nor supplemented by a different marker in recurrences. To test these tenets the cytogenetics of 50 selected carcinomas of the bladder (37 noninvasive and 13 submucosal invasive) from patients followed for up to 17 years from 1968 through 1985 were tabulated. In noninvasive carcinoma absence of markers, prognostic of long-term remission, does not rule out ultimate recurrence. In submucosal invasive carcinoma the markers, commonly present, only confirm the prognosis inherent in histopathology. In recurrences the original marker chromosomes are commonly repeated but they may be added to or replaced.\r"

Subcutaneous human adipose tissue was obtained during elective surgery and placed in tissue culture. Physical mixtures of long chain triglyceride (LCT) and/or medium chain triglyceride (MCT) were added to the tissue culture medium so that the final concentration was 400 mg/dl. After a 3-day incubation period the tissue was harvested, placed in buffer and used to determine in vitro production of the prostaglandins prostacyclin I2 (measured as its stable endproduct 6-keto PGF1 alpha), thromboxane A2 (measured as TXB2), and prostaglandin E2. Measurements of the fatty acid profile found in the neutral- and phospholipid fraction of the adipose tissue and fat cell size were also made. The results demonstrate that samples incubated in 100% MCT had the most significant increase in prostaglandin production whereas those incubated in 100% LCT had the most significant decrease in activity of the three prostaglandins assayed, when compared to controls. The addition of LCT to MCT caused a dose-related decrease in adipose tissue prostaglandin production. There were no significant changes in the profile of fatty acids found in the neutral- or phospholipid fraction of adipose tissue. The results indicate that the relative level of MCT/LCT incubated with human adipose tissue has a significant effect on prostaglandin production.\r"

To characterize this response we administered 1 g of protein/kg body weight as a beef steak meal to nine, healthy male subjects and measured glomerular filtration rate (inulin clearance), renal plasma flow (p-amino hippurate clearance), plasma renin activity, aldosterone and plasma and urinary catecholamines. The subjects ingested the meal on three separate days and were pretreated with either placebo, 50 mg indomethacin (to inhibit renal prostaglandin synthesis), or 10 mg enalapril (to inhibit angiotensin II synthesis). Following placebo treatment protein feeding significantly increased the glomerular filtration rate, from a pre-meal level of 101 +/- 7 ml/min/1.73 m2 to a post-meal level of 130 +/- 6 ml/min/1.73 m2, P less than 0.005. A parallel rise in renal plasma flow and a fall in renal vascular resistance were noted. Indomethacin pretreatment attenuated the increase in glomerular filtration rate following the protein meal, 105 +/- 6 ml/min/1.73 m2 pre-meal level to 118 +/- 4 ml/min/1.73 m2 post-meal, P greater than 0.1. Enalapril pretreatment had no significant effect on protein-induced glomerular hyperfiltration. Protein feeding following placebo increased plasma aldosterone concentration while the concentrations were unchanged in the studies where enalapril or indomethacin was administered. Protein feeding following placebo or indomethacin did not alter plasma renin activity while plasma renin activity rose following enalapril administration. Urinary norepinephrine excretion rose while plasma norepinephrine concentration was unchanged in all three study groups. A decrease in urinary dopamine excretion was also noted four hours after the protein meal was ingested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We attempted to isolate the virus from the blood and spinal fluid of patients with chronic progressive myelopathy and to define the clinical, radiologic, and electrophysiologic features of this disease. Ten of 13 patients from tropical countries and 2 of 8 from the United States had serum antibodies to HTLV-I. The virus was detected in cultures of peripheral-blood lymphocytes from three of seven patients by means of Southern blot hybridization. Using a sensitive in vitro enzymatic gene-amplification technique, we detected HTLV-I sequences in fresh peripheral-blood mononuclear cells of all of 11 patients tested who were positive for the antibody, and in cell cultures of the spinal fluid from 3 of the 11 tested. Magnetic resonance imaging of the cranium revealed periventricular lesions in the white matter of 3 of the 12 antibody-positive patients. Five of these patients had mild axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy, and one had bilateral lumbar radiculopathy. Visual evoked potentials were abnormal in three seropositive patients, and brain-stem evoked responses were abnormal in two. The detection of the DNA and proteins of HTLV-I strengthens the proposition that this virus is involved in the pathogenesis of a subset of cases of chronic progressive myelopathy.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether one or more hematopoietic-cell lineages are involved in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we designed a technique that simultaneously identifies a cell as malignant and determines its lineage. We used numerical clonal chromosomal abnormalities, which are readily detected, to indicate neoplasia, and monoclonal antibodies in an alkaline phosphatase-antialkaline phosphatase detection procedure to identify lineages as granulocytic-monocytic, erythrocytic, or megakaryocytic. Examination of bone marrow from 12 patients with AML showed metaphases of granulocytic-monocytic lineage with abnormal karyotypes in all patients. In seven patients, we also detected abnormal karyotypes in the erythrocytic or megakaryocytic lineage. In all four patients with monosomy 7, both granulocytic-monocytic and erythrocytic cells were affected. Two of four patients with trisomy 8 also had evidence of multiple-lineage involvement, but in two the erythrocytic lineage had normal karyotypes, suggesting an origin at a progenitor-cell stage committed to granulocytic-monocytic development. Multiple-lineage involvement was found in AML both arising de novo (four of five analyzable cases) and following another cancer (three of four analyzable cases). These data demonstrate multiple-lineage involvement in a high proportion of cases of AML and suggest that many cases originate from the multipotent hematopoietic cell or from an earlier progenitor cell.\r"

Seventeen maxillary third molar teeth from 10 patients whose postsurgical follow-up ranged from 6 months to 78 months (mean, 40 months) were extracted. The long-term biologic effects of Le Fort I osteotomy on the pulp and on the development of teeth were retrospectively evaluated with clinical and standard histologic techniques. Normal teeth from patients who were not operated on were used as controls. Histologic examination revealed an intact pulpal circulation and minimal pathologic changes in the pulpal tissue. Clinical and radiographic studies showed that the growing teeth developed normally after surgery. The Le Fort I downfracture procedure had little discernible long-term effect on the pulp and on the development of human third molar teeth.\r"

This study investigated the prevalence of oral and perioral lesions in a cohort of patients receiving care at a hemophilia treatment center. In a sample of 32 patients with a factor VIII deficiency and 5 patients with a factor IX deficiency who underwent oral examinations, more than 80% were HIV seropositive. Cervical lymphadenopathy was present in more than half of the patients who were HIV seropositive but was absent in those who were HIV seronegative. Intraoral AIDS-associated lesions were present only in patients for whom a diagnosis of AIDS had been made, indicating that oral lesions among persons with hemophilia who are HIV seropositive may be less prevalent than among homosexual males or intravenous drug abusers who are HIV seropositive.\r"

To make a comparison, three groups of patients without malignant disorders (acute disorders, long-term hospitalization, antibiotic treatment) were also studied. The total number of salivary microorganisms remained unchanged during the period. Fourteen of twenty patients with leukemia harbored enterobacteria on at least one occasion. No differences were found in the number of enterobacteria before, during, and after treatment with cytotoxic or antimicrobial drugs. Enterobacteria were also found in the reference group with long-term hospitalization, but seldom in the other reference groups. Staphylococci and lactobacilli were present in all patients in the leukemia group and in the majority in the reference groups. Yeast cells were found in 80% of the patients with leukemia. Patients with ulcers and/or angular cheilitis had higher numbers of yeast cells than the other patients. There was no relationship between enterobacteria or staphylococci and oral lesions.\r"

The nongingival granular cell tumors (NGGCT) were found to be more prevalent among females than males by a ratio of 2:1 and arose on the tongue (67%), the buccal mucosa (13%), the lips (8%), the soft palate (6%), and other sites (6%). With the use of the avidin-biotin-peroxidase method, polyclonal rabbit antisera were employed. The antisera were directed to the following antigens: S-100 protein, myoglobin, myosin, actin, desmin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, and muramidase. Results indicated that granular cell tumors are not homogenous for immunocytochemical markers. Nongingival granular cell tumors were universally positive for S-100 protein and failed to exhibit immunoreactivity for myogenous or histiocytic markers. Alternatively, the gingival granular cell tumor of infancy was negative for all markers, whereas rhabdomyoma was reactive with myogenous markers and a subpopulation of tumor cells displayed S-100 protein immunoreactivity. The granular cell ameloblastoma was reactive only with antiserum to alpha-1-antitrypsin. Ultrastructurally, granular cells from one of two NGGCT showed a direct evolution from skeletal muscle fibers. It is concluded that the oral NGGCT is a tumor positive for S-100 protein that may arise from muscle or nerve sheath.\r"

On the basis of clinical, radiographic, and microscopic findings, a diagnosis of autosomal recessive rough hypoplastic amelogenesis imperfecta was made. The configuration of the abnormal enamel was examined with scanning and transmission electron microscopy as well as with light microscopy. Prismatic structure was virtually absent, and the scant enamel showed globular protrusions superficially. Two different surface structures were identified as covering parts of the enamel. At the ultrastructural level, calcified bodies located in the gingival tissue appeared to be composed, in part, of a dense enamel-like substance and, in part, of a tissue with features of afibrillar cementum.\r"

Overall, eucapercha showed less severe inflammatory responses than Grossman's sealer, CRCS, and Hypocal. Diffuse calcification was induced by the three calcium hydroxide preparations (CRCS, Sealapex, and Hypocal). Eucapercha and Endo-Fill had minute local areas of calcification.

In groups I, II, and III, retrofilling preparation was made and filled with amalgam, varnish and then amalgam, and cyanoacrylate, respectively. In group IV, a hot instrument was used to seal the gutta-percha, and in group V, a cold burnisher was used for the same purpose. All of the teeth were immersed in 1% methylene blue dye for 24 hours and sectional longitudinally; dye penetration was then measured. One-way analysis of variance performed on the means of the groups indicated that group III had the least amount of leakage (p less than 0.05). This study indicates that cyanocrylate may have potential as a retrograde filling material.\r"

  ".W": "A comprehensive analysis of the relationship between clinical observations in dental patients without symptoms and oral disease as detected by full-mouth and panoramic dental radiographs in a large population of patients has never been reported. Knowledge of these relationships is necessary in the design of a diagnostic decision process (clinical algorithm) that can predict which patients require dental radiographs for the diagnosis of dental caries or periodontal disease to be confirmed or refined. An accurate clinical algorithm could reduce the number of radiographs that are taken of certain routinely seen dental patients without symptoms, thus reducing unnecessary exposure x-radiation as well as potentially reducing health care costs for these patients. A sample of 602 adult men on whom a complete series of panoramic, posterior bitewing, and periapical dental radiographs and an independent oral examination were performed provided the opportunity to evaluate the relationship between clinically observed oral disease indicators and independent radiographic evidence of dental caries and periodontal disease. The analysis suggests that combinations of several clinical indicators can predict with some success which patients without symptoms will benefit most from oral radiographs. The presence of several carious lesions on oral examination was the best predictor of radiographic detection of dental caries. Clinical indicators tht appear to predict radiographic evidence of periodontal disease are clinical measures of pocket depth, mobility, and the patient's denture status. An important finding is that because of the high prevalence of gingivitis and plaque, these indicators were not related to radiographic evidence of periodontal disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The results indicated that film was the most useful in identification of noncarious restored teeth (91% correct versus 79% correct for xeroradiography); however, xeroradiography was better than film for detection of recurrent caries (67% versus 53%). With ROC analysis, both film and xeroradiography were equally useful, having the same ROC value of 0.78. At rates of 67% and 53% for detection of the presence of recurrent caries, neither imaging system can overcome basic geometric limitations of superimposition of metallic restorations. Thus, there is the continued need for careful clinical assessesment of existing restorations for the presence of recurrent caries.\r"

  ".W": "Osteonectin is a prominent noncollagenous protein of developing bone. A 2150-base-pair cDNA coding for osteonectin, isolated from a bovine bone cell lambda gt11 expression library, was sequenced and identified by comparison with protein sequence data. The nucleotide sequence predicts that osteonectin contains 304 amino acids, including a 17-residue signal peptide. Analysis of the deduced protein sequence suggests that the secreted protein contains at least four distinct structural domains. An acidic region at the amino terminus of the protein appears to be a potential hydroxyapatite-binding site. This is followed by a second domain, rich in cysteine, that shows sequence homology with cysteine-rich domains in turkey ovomucoid and other serine proteinase inhibitors. Two sequences homologous with central calcium-binding loops of \"EF hands\" and thus having potential to be high-affinity calcium-binding sites are located in two other domains within the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein. Finally, the osteonectin sequence shows near identity (greater than 90%) with another protein, SPARC (secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine), secreted by mouse parietal endoderm. These data suggest that osteonectin, a protein present in bone and other selected tissues, is a multifunctional protein.\r"

  ".U": "88203923\r", 
  ".W": "The impending no-reflow (NRF) state was studied in the rat hindlimb to identify possible biochemical mediators producing the no-reflow phenomenon. After 5 hours of ischemia, the venous effluents draining the ischemic limb and the contralateral nonischemic limb were collected for three 30-minute time periods. Thromboxane B2 (TxB2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha, the stable metabolite of prostacyclin (PGI2), were measured by radioimmunoassay. Venous outflow rate, distal skin perfusion assessed by dermofluorometry, and histology of muscle and skin were examined in control limbs, ischemic limbs, and limbs with impending no reflow. The no-reflow state was characterized by a significantly decreased venous outflow (less than 0.01 ml per minute), decreased skin perfusion (index of fluorescence of 15 percent in no-reflow limbs versus 70 percent in reflow limbs), and absence of thrombosis of the vasculature. The no-reflow state also was associated with 2.4 times more thromboxane B2 and 1.5 times more 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha than that observed in ischemic limbs with reflow. The biosynthesis of vasodilating prostaglandin E2 in the no-reflow state, however, was only 40 percent of the prostaglandin E2 measured in limbs with reflow. We propose that the impending no-reflow state may reflect a state of global microcirculatory \"agonal\" vasoconstriction, most probably due to an overabundant release of the vasoconstrictor thromboxane relative to the vasodilating prostaglandin E2 and prostacyclin. The likelihood of specific biochemical mechanisms producing the no-reflow state suggests that pharmacologic agents may be able to reverse the impending no-reflow state to improve tissue survival.\r"

Longitudinal intraosseous extension of tumor from the adjacent articular surface was measured on imaging studies and macroslides to the nearest millimeter. The average difference between macroslide and CT measurements (15 cases) was 16.5 mm +/- 10.7, and the average difference between macroslide and MR imaging measurements (17 cases) was 4.9 mm +/- 4.3. However, much of the latter difference appears to be caused by use of a different plane of section in MR imaging compared with that in macroslides, since in a subgroup of five specimens with an identical plane of section, the average difference was 1.8 mm +/- 1.6. The authors conclude that MR imaging is extremely accurate in the assessment of intraosseous extent of osteosarcoma.\r"

Genetic evidence indicates that the second nonstructural gene of HTLV-II, here designated rex, acts in trans to modulate tax gene-mediated transactivation in a concentration-dependent fashion. The rex gene may regulate the process of transactivation during the viral life cycle.\r"

Among the clinical data, presence and onset of pain attacks, age, and weight loss were selected as the most informative in assessing chronic pancreatic disease. Clinical data correctly classified 88.5% of chronic pancreatitis and 75.0% of pancreatic cancer; serum markers identified pancreatic tumor in 67.9% of the patients. The adjunct of serum markers to clinical data did not improve accuracy in diagnosing chronic pancreatic disease. Since clinical data and serum markers generally become positive at an advanced stage of the disease, early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is a goal still to be attained.\r"

At the time of entry into the study in 1982 to 1983, 18 subjects (49 percent) were already seropositive for HIV and 11 (30 percent) had persistent generalized lymphadenopathy. Seventy percent of the total population were clinically asymptomatic. In nine subjects, seroconversion occurred during the study such that 81 percent of the population was seropositive at the conclusion. During the same period, lymphadenopathy developed in six subjects, there was progression to AIDS-related complex (ARC) in four, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) developed in one patient. Thus, at the end of the study, 54 percent were clinically asymptomatic, 32 percent had persistent lymphadenopathy, and 11 percent had ARC. Subjects who remained seronegative had received less factor concentrate than seropositive subjects, remained asymptomatic, and had normal results on tests of immune function. In those who had experienced seroconversion, there were decreased absolute numbers of CD4+ lymphocytes prior to seroconversion, and abnormalities of lymphocyte function developed after seroconversion. The development of persistent generalized lymphadenopathy was associated temporally with seroconversion. The presence of persistent generalized lymphadenopathy did not appear to be associated with an increased risk for AIDS in seropositive persons, since the condition of most hemophiliac patients with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy at the time of initial evaluation remained clinically and immunologically stable. In contrast to patients with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, asymptomatic seropositive subjects had progressive abnormalities of lymphocyte function over time that were independent of the numbers of CD4+ cells in the peripheral blood.\r"

Samples from thirty-two of 42 patients (76%) exhibited at least one aneuploid population of tumor cells. Separate analysis of the aneuploid and diploid components of samples with aneuploid populations revealed between-tumor variation: seven of 23 aneuploid populations (30%) were positive for CA125; eight of 22 aneuploid populations (40%) exhibited substantial decreases in major histocompatibility complex class I expression, compared with corresponding diploid components of the same samples; and eight of 22 aneuploid populations (36%) exhibited substantial expression of major histocompatibility complex class II antigens. The frequencies of aneuploid populations and of the foregoing antigen expression categories were independent of tumor cell type, stage, and grade. The significance of these results for prognosis remains to be determined.\r"

Information was collected about use after discharge and about reported advantages and disadvantages. Twenty-three subjects were identified: 21 had spinal cord injuries (SCI), two had had poliomyelitis. The average pneumobelt fitting was three to six months after injury. Twelve SCI patients attained four or more hours of continuous, generally all-day use; another patient achieved this after discharge. Of the remaining eight SCI subjects, all achieved a minimum of two hours of continuous use. The two poliomyelitis patients also achieved all-day use. The survey revealed a high level of satisfaction and continued pneumobelt use after discharge. Major reported advantages were cosmesis, improved speech, independence and mobility, comfort, safety, and health. The pneumobelt is recommended as a leading choice for interim or permanent ventilation of the high quadriplegic population without severe brainstem involvement.\r"

Between 1984 and 1987, 124 patients with peritonsillar infection were treated in our department, and 115 were included in this prospective study. Needle aspiration was not carried out in 11 patients because of young age, noncooperation, or severe trismus. The other 104 patients underwent permucosal aspiration and were followed up for periods of four months to three years. Of these, findings of aspiration were positive in 75 (72%). Only nine (12%) of the 75 patients with positive aspirates had to be hospitalized. In 64 (85%) of the 75 patients, the abscess resolved without further therapy. Aspiration of pus, along with oral administration of antibiotics, thus appears to be a reasonable alternative to incision and drainage or \"hot\" tonsillectomy in patients with peritonsillar abscess. This conservative approach obviates the need for hospital admission in most patients, thus enabling a significant cost reduction.\r"

Analysis of the isotypic distribution of HIV-specific antibodies appears of special interest for two reasons: first, isotypic diversity is partly under the control of antigen-specific T-helper cells, the very cells infected by HIV; second, isotype determines antibody functions, effector (neutralization, antibody-dependent complement, or cell-mediated cytotoxicity) as well as blocking functions. We have investigated by Western blot analysis the isotypic profile of the antibody response to HIV structural proteins (env, gag, pol) and to the nonstructural protein F (3' orf), which is absent from the virion and might primarily target infected cells. In 115 asymptomatic individuals, infected by sexual contact (homosexual men) or intravenously (hemophiliacs), the response to gag-products was polyisotypic, including IgM, IgG1, IgG3 and IgA; the response to F was more restricted (IgM, IgG1, IgA) and the response to env strikingly restricted to the IgG1 isotype, suggesting different regulatory mechanisms in the B-cell response to these proteins. The isotypic distribution was also influenced by the route of infection, IgG4 and IgE (gag-specific) being exclusively elicited in the hemophiliac group. Finally, observations of potential diagnostic interest were made in a limited number of at-risk individuals; these included the presence of gag- and pol-specific IgM or IgA in the absence of any HIV-specific IgG isotypes; and the presence of gag- and F-specific antibodies in the absence of env-specific antibodies, suggesting the early occurrence of both isotypic and antigenic selection mechanisms during the course of HIV infection.\r"

  ".W": "Leukemic cells from 25 cases of non-T-acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) in children were investigated for intracellular immunoglobulin by the use of immunoelectron microscopic study (immuno-EM). As a result, 12 cases were negative for both heavy and light chains of the immunoglobulin in the neoplastic cells. Of these, one case that was also negative for common ALL antigen (CALLA) was defined as null cell type. The remaining 11 cases were defined as common ALL type. Six cases were defined as pre-B-cell type because they were positive for cytoplasmic mu chain but negative for cytoplasmic light chains. Seven cases were defined as B-cell type, all of which possessed lambda light chains in the neoplastic cells. Immunohistologic studies using monoclonal antibodies showed that most non-T-ALL cases were positive for CALLA and B4, whereas about 50% of them were positive for B1. Our immuno-EM study suggests that it is one of the effective ways of subclassifying non-T-ALL in children.\r"

  ".W": "Bone marrow and peripheral blood findings at the time of complete remission were analyzed in 333 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia to determine if any variables were predictive for remission duration and survival. Patients were categorized as to percentage of blasts, promyelocytes, erythroid precursors and lymphocytes in the marrow and hemoglobin concentration, leukocyte and platelet counts, and percentage of granulocytes and blasts in the blood. Additionally, the degree of cellularity in the marrow aspirate and biopsy were analyzed. Patients with less than 1% blasts in the marrow had significantly longer remission durations than those with blasts greater than or equal to 1% (P less than 0.01). Those with hypercellular marrows had significantly shorter remission (P less than 0.05) and survival (P less than 0.01). The transient presence of more than 3% blasts in the blood also was suggestive of a shorter remission duration and survival. The presence of less than 1% blasts in the marrow, normal or decreased biopsy cellularity, and no anemia at the time of remission defined a \"good\" prognostic group. The quality of remission should be assessed in evaluating the results of therapy and assigning further treatment.\r"

  ".W": "The DNA content of osteosarcomas, and of giant cell tumors, osteoblastomas, aneurysmal bone cysts, and fibrous dysplasias was determined by cytophotometry. Of 158 tumors, 141 were histologically noncontroversial, whereas 17 posed diagnostic difficulties. In the noncontroversial group, all 41 benign tumors had a diploid (normal) DNA content. Ninety-two of 96 high-grade osteosarcomas were hyperploid (increased DNA content). The four analyzed low-grade parosteal osteosarcomas were diploid. Among 17 diagnostically controversial cases, nine were primarily diagnosed and treated as benign. Three of these patients, nevertheless, exhibited a malignant clinical course and two had local recurrence. All five proved to have hyperploid tumors. The four nonrecurrent lesions were diploid. Of eight patients primarily evaluated as malignant, one died and two developed local recurrence. These three patients had hyperploid tumors. Among the five nonrecurrent lesions, two were hyperploid and three diploid. In the diagnostically controversial group, recurrence or death was consistently related to hyperploidy. The present study shows that the vast majority of high-grade osteosarcomas are hyperploid. Benign bone tumors, which may be mixed up histologically with osteosarcoma, are diploid. Routine DNA analysis of primary bone tumors, as an adjunct to histopathologic assessment, can be employed to obtain diagnostic confirmation. In cases presenting histopathologic difficulties, ploidy determination may provide decisive diagnostic information.\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective, randomized control trial, 152 consecutive patients requiring emergency or complicated colorectal surgery were allocated either to two doses of cefotetan or to five-day cover with gentamicin, and a single dose of metronidazole. Twenty-one patients received 6 gm of cefotetan before prolongation of prothrombin time dictated a change in the dose regimen such that all remaining patients (N = 55) received only 4 gm of cefotetan. The groups were well matched for diagnosis and surgical procedure. Rates of postoperative infection did not differ significantly between the groups, with wound infection rates occurring in 17 of 75 patients receiving gentamicin and metronidazole (22.7 percent) compared with ten of 75 receiving cefotetan (13 percent). Although wound infection rates were lower in the cefotetan group, the incidence of intra-abdominal abscess was similar in both groups. Eight patients receiving cefotetan developed intra-abdominal abscesses (11 percent), compared with seven receiving gentamicin and metronidazole (9 percent). Prolongation of prothrombin time in excess of 13 seconds occurred in six patients receiving cefotetan compared with no patients receiving gentamicin and metronidazole. None of these patients developed clinical bleeding, however.\r"
