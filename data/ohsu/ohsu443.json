  ".W": "Analysis of human cartilage extracts by radioimmunoassay showed that the noncollagenous 148-kd cartilage matrix protein was present in extracts of tracheal cartilage but was undetectable in normal or arthritic joint cartilage, corroborating previous results with bovine cartilage samples. Concentrations of the protein in the circulation, as studied by radioimmunoassay, were greatly elevated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and polyarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. In contrast, patients with reactive arthritis and oligoarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, as well as rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with low-dose glucocorticoids, had levels similar to those in healthy controls. The serum concentrations were not related to age. A patient with polychondritis and tracheal involvement had a high serum concentration of the protein, which decreased during plasma exchange and cyclophosphamide treatment. Studies of the release of this cartilage matrix protein, which is present in nonarticular cartilage but not in articular cartilage, should aid in the understanding of the mechanisms of cartilage involvement in disease, and the protein may become a clinically useful marker.\r"

  ".W": "Production of antibodies to IgG and to type I and type II collagen (CI and CII) was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunospot assay in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and patients with other inflammatory or degenerative joint diseases. Anti-CII-secreting cells, generally in high numbers, were found among mononuclear cells eluted from inflamed synovial tissue in 12 of 13 patients with seropositive RA and 9 of 14 patients with seronegative RA or with undetermined serum rheumatoid factor levels. In contrast, no anti-CII-producing B cells were present among synoviocytes from 4 patients with other joint diseases. In none of 7 RA sera did we find significant levels of anti-CII. Synovial B cells secreting antibodies specific for CI were observed less frequently in patients with RA. These results indicate that measurement of serum antibody levels is not adequate to assess actual autoantibody production in rheumatoid joints and that local autoimmune reactions to CII are common in RA, which implies that collagen-reactive T cells are present within the inflamed joints of RA patients. The possible role of a local collagen autoimmunity in RA is discussed, particularly in relation to its putative role in rheumatoid factor production.\r"

Scores on the self-report Disability index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire were highly correlated with physical therapist and spouse ratings of disability. Although Health Assessment Questionnaire disability scores were significantly correlated with self-reported and interviewer-assessed ratings of depression, these correlations were significantly smaller. Factor analyses of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and rheumatologist ratings of BDI items indicated that this measure is highly contaminated by the inclusion of items reflecting RA disease severity. A dysphoric mood subcomponent of the BDI may be a more valid measure of depression in RA populations. Although depression and disability are clearly positively correlated in RA patients, depression scales that include somatic items are likely to yield an overestimate of the association. Finally, self-reported pain intensity was more clearly related to disability and reported recent disease activity than to depression.\r"

The patients were evaluated independently by 2 physicians on 2 occasions approximately 1 month apart. Differences between patients demonstrated the largest source of variation in scores, accounting for 56-84% of the total variance, depending on the instrument. Differences between physicians (i.e., error) showed the next largest variation, 11-28% of the total variance, and differences between visits made up 5-16% of the total. The BILAG, SLE-DAI, and SLAM had the best inter-visit and inter-rater reliability. Convergent validity was shown by the strong correlations of scores among the different instruments (r = 0.81-0.97). All instruments correlated highly with the physicians' clinical impression of disease but less well with their evaluation of disease severity. The number of American Rheumatism Association criteria for SLE that were met by the patients correlated poorly with the physicians' global evaluation and with the scores of the instruments. The patients' self-reported disease activity scores correlated highly with the physicians' assessments of disease activity (r = 0.85-0.91), and the mean values from self-reports and from physicians' assessments were nearly equal. In contrast, severity scores correlated less well between self-reports and physician assessments (r = 0.49-0.69), and mean self-reported severity values were lower than the means from physicians. The BILAG, SLE-DAI, and SLAM systems appear to have better psychometric properties than the others for clinical research.\r"

Five additional dogs were studied before and 2 weeks and 6 weeks after sham ACLT. The gaits of 3 dogs that had undergone ACLT 2.5 years previously were also analyzed. Preoperatively, there were no differences in the MFz of the right and left hind limbs of the 9 dogs; we found that each limb exerted approximately 70% of the dog's static body weight on the force plate. Two weeks following ACLT, the MFz of the operated limbs decreased to 25% of the static body weight, while at 6 weeks and 12 weeks after surgery, the MFz generated by the operated limbs rose to about 32% and 37% of static body weight, respectively. No change was noted in the MFz of the contralateral hind limbs. In the 3 dogs that had undergone ACLT 2.5 years earlier, the MFz in the unstable stifle joint was 50% of static body weight. At both 2 weeks and 6 weeks after surgery, the MFz values for all 4 limbs of the animals subjected to sham ACLT were comparable with baseline values. These observations indicate that the osteoarthritic changes seen in the unstable limb are associated with decreased loading of that limb, without increased (compensatory) loading of the contralateral hind limb.\r"

All patients were treated with iv ribavirin, two initially and the third after viremia was detected during hyperacute rejection of a cardiac transplant. No significant adverse effects could be directly attributed to therapy, and viral shedding abruptly terminated coincident with its use; however, both patients treated shortly after onset of myocarditis died. The third required support by an artificial heart, and died 8 mo later. Immunotyping of myocardial tissues in two cases revealed an initial predominance of T helper cells. Serial endomyocardial biopsies available from one of these demonstrated a subsequent marked decrease in the T helper cell population as inflammation and necrosis subsided during and following therapy.\r"

After these studies all patients received intracavernous injection with a combination of papaverine (50 mg) and phentolamine (1.66 mg), and both tumescence and rigidity were monitored. Rigidity response was compared with the PBI. The number of patients with a poor rigidity response in each PBI category were: 3 of 5 with a PBI of less than 0.6 (vasculogenic), 7 of 11 with a PBI of 0.6-0.75 (ambiguous), and 25 of 66 with a PBI of 0.75-1.0 (normal). These results indicate only a marginally significant association between PBI and intracavernous injection. The procedure was safe with no long-term sequelae from injection observed, and no surgical intervention was required. Complications of injections included reversible priapism in 11 patients (13.4%), transient dizziness in 10 patients (12.2%), and hematoma in 5 patients (6.2%). This study suggests that intracavernous injection with a drug combination may be a more sensitive screening test for vasculogenic impotence than noninvasive Doppler studies because it more closely simulates the erectile response.\r"

Simultaneous bilateral pyeloplasty through posterior lumbotomy is a safe and cost-effective alternative to staged procedures for bilateral ureteropelvic junction obstruction.\r"

A blood loss of about 5 mL/g in the 5-FU group was less than in the control group. In addition, the reduction of bleeding was apparent in cases where the removed prostate weighed more than 10 g, and was especially marked in those cases where the removed prostate weighed 20-29 g. A pathologic examination of the 5-FU-treated prostate revealed atrophy of the glandular tissue, hyperplasia of the connective tissue, marked dilatation of the lumen of some of the acini which indicated exhaustion of glandular secretion, a decrease in the number of blood vessels, and formation of lymphoid follicles. All of the test group, with the exception of one whose white blood cell count once dropped to 2,700/mm3, did not show any side effects.\r"

Intermediate filaments are one such family of structural proteins. By characterization of these proteins, using a panel of monoclonal antibodies, poorly differentiated tumors may be definitively classified as carcinomas, sarcomas, lymphomas, or neural tumors. This approach to tumor diagnosis is now applicable to difficult problems in clinical urology.\r"

  ".U": "89224004\r", 
  ".W": "Concepts regarding the surgical treatment of cancer of the prostate have changed significantly at the Mayo Clinic. Rather than emphasizing radical prostatectomy only for low-grade (grade less than or equal to 2) and low-stage (less than or equal to T1/B1) lesions--which may be equally well treated at less than ten years, in regard to crude survival, by radiotherapy--we believe that radical prostatectomy is particularly suitable for lesions of higher local stages, including those with regional node extension. This view is based on a large experience (less than 2,000 cases) with the radical surgical treatment of cancer of the prostate and on the realization that conservative single-modality treatment (hormonal or radiotherapy) for advanced local Stages (C and D1) provides poor cause-specific survival and nonprogression rates and may lead to high local morbidity. The treatment of Stage D1 prostate cancer was thought to be not amenable to surgical treatment, and many have recommended observation only. In 266 patients (mean age, 64 years) followed one to twenty-one years (mean, 4.7 years), immediate adjuvant orchiectomy at the time of radical prostatectomy performed in 162 patients (61%) resulted in a highly significant (P less than 0.0001) decrease in progression compared with no immediate orchiectomy in 104 patients (39%). The ten-year overall and local nonprogression rates for those undergoing immediate orchiectomy were 80 percent and 98 percent, respectively; median time to progression for the no-immediate-orchiectomy group was less than 4.5 years, and the local recurrence rate was 25 percent at ten years. Of all the pathologic variables, only DNA ploidy pattern had a significant influence on progression and cause-specific survival. Also, in patients with D1 disease and a nuclear DNA diploid pattern, immediate adjuvant orchiectomy resulted in a nonprogression rate of 100 percent at ten years compared with virtually 0 percent in those with a nondiploid tumor and no immediate orchiectomy. Because 42 percent of the patients with D1 disease in the Mayo Clinic experience have DNA diploid tumors, adjuvant orchiectomy in this group results in no progression or prostate cancer death. Patients with Stage D1 prostate cancer and DNA nondiploid pattern undergoing prostatectomy should be entered in prospective adjuvant innovative treatment protocols since these tumors do not seem to respond to early hormonal manipulation.\r"

The median follow-up period was twenty-one months, with a range of four to eighty-nine months. All patients received androgen deprivation at the time metastases were identified. A multivariate analysis demonstrated that pretreatment serum testosterone was the most significant variable associated with time until progression (P less than 0.01) and that the extent of bone metastases observed on the bone scan was the second most important variable (P less than 0.05). The following factors did not significantly correlate with progression-free intervals: age, race, and PAP. The performance status was significantly correlated, but was nonsignificant in the multivariate analysis when the model already included the testosterone level and the extent of bone metastases. Patients with a pretreatment testosterone level of less than 300 ng/dL and with more than six areas of increased uptake on the bone scan progressed more rapidly.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether paraventricular nucleus (PVN) can play a role in the hypertension in DOCA/salt-treated rats, DOCA/salt hypertension was produced in PVN lesions and sham-operated rats. In lesioned rats, the development of hypertension was significantly attenuated (day 7: 132 +/- 3 v 157 +/- 5 mm Hg, P less than 0.01; day 14: 132 +/- 3 v 157 +/- 5 mm Hg, P less than 0.01; day 21: 189 +/- 2 v 224 +2- 6 mm Hg, P less than 0.01). Lesions lowered systolic blood pressure in even control rats. Mean blood pressure (mBP) from awake free moving rats was also significantly lower in lesioned DOCA/salt-treated rats than those of sham-operated DOCA/salt-treated rats (155 +/- 14 mm Hg v 193 +/- 13, P less than 0.01), while mBP was not different between lesioned and sham-operated control rats. The reduction of mBP by hexamethonium injections was significantly larger in sham-operated DOCA/salt-treated rats than those of lesioned DOCA/salt rats. (-53 +/- 3% v -45 +/- 2, P less than 0.05). Plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine were significantly elevated in DOCA/salt-treated rats, however, PVN lesions inhibited significantly those elevations. 1-Deaminopenicillamine, 4-valine, 8-D-arginine Vasopressin (dPVDAVP) injections did not affect BP and heart rate in all rats. Body weight, water intake, urine volume, urine Na, K, and vasopressin excretion, and urine osmorality were not altered by lesions. These findings suggest that PVN contributes to development of hypertension in DOCA/salt-treated rats with sympathetic nervous activations.\r"

Other parameters derived from BP monitoring were also correlated with LVMI: daytime diastolic BP (0.54), nighttime systolic and diastolic BP (0.61 and 0.54), pulse pressure (0.58), the average of the five highest systolic and diastolic BP (0.57 both), and the percentage of systolic BP above 140 mm Hg (r = 0.64). However, in a stepwise multiple regression analysis only daytime systolic BP was independently correlated to LVMI. The standard deviation of systolic BP was not significantly correlated to LVMI. The same positive correlation between daytime systolic BP and LVMI was found in normotensive and hypertensive patients, males and females, and patients with and without left ventricular hypertrophy. So, at least regarding the prediction of the degree of left ventricular hypertrophy, the average systolic BP during daytime seems to be the only valuable parameter to look at in ambulatory BP monitorings of untreated hypertensive patients.\r"

The results of separate stepwise regression analyses performed on the pressures measured in each environment showed that perceived job stress (P less than .05) and body fat or mass (P less than .05) significantly elevated systolic pressure in all situations, whereas home stress (P less than .05) and number of children (P less than .05) had the most marked effect on diastolic pressure variation over the day.

The responses to cumulative doses of KCl indicated that SHR aortic rings were hyperresponsive to low but not high doses of KCl compared to WKY aortic rings. After Ca depletion by prolonged incubation of the rat aortic rings with Ca2+-free, EGTA containing solution, Ca repletion resulted in contraction. The magnitude of such a contraction was dependent on the period of Ca depletion and was highly sensitive to dihydropyridine Ca channel blocker, nifedipine. Although the Ca-depleted aortic rings eventually developed to the same level of maximum tension development upon Ca repletion, it took a considerably shorter period of Ca depletion for SHR than for WKY aortic rings to reach the maximum contraction upon Ca repletion. Our findings support the view that cell membranes of vascular smooth muscle in hypertension are more excitable and more susceptible to membrane destabilization by Ca removal.\r"

Seven of the 25 primary cutaneous malignant melanomas were reactive with one or both of the antibodies and this reactivity was more marked in the deeper lesions.

We used a 5 mW He-Ne laser emitting a I mm diameter beam of wavelength 633 nm. Cellular proliferation was not affected by irradiation three times a day for 3 days. There was no effect on cellular migration or on the rate of collagen lattice contraction. The rate of collagen synthesis, measured as the incorporation of 3H-proline into collagenase-sensitive protein, was no greater than that of controls and GAG secretion did not increase in the irradiated group. We have not found any significant effects of He-Ne irradiation.\r"

  ".W": "Onchocerciasis is a chronic parasitic infection in which infiltration of the skin by microfilariae has been associated with a number of different pathological changes. This survey compared the prevalence of different forms of skin disease in two villages, one of which was located within the endemic zone for onchocerciasis (Zapallo Grande), in a lowland rain forest area of western Ecuador. The commonest skin diseases in both villages were scabies, pyoderma and pityriasis versicolor. In addition changes closely correlated with the presence of microfilariae in skin snips were found in Zapallo Grande--such as atrophic gluteal changes, and acute and chronic papular dermatitis. The only other skin disease associated with onchocerciasis was widespread tinea corporis due to T. rubrum. The Amerindians in the endemic onchocerciasis area were more likely than Negroes to have generalized atrophic changes of the skin, whereas in the latter group significant numbers of individuals had no obvious skin lesions but large numbers of microfilariae were detected in skin snips. Acute papular dermatitis was common in both groups and in biopsied lesions microfilariae could usually be identified within the epidermis or close to the dermo-epidermal junction. One patient had developed severe reactive onchodermatitis (Sowda). Swabs taken from onchocercal skin lesions showed no evidence of skin surface carriage of Staphylococcus aureus. Changes classically associated with onchocerciasis such as pretibial hypopigmentation (leopard skin) and hanging groin were notably absent in this population.\r"

In contrast, standard psychological screening tests for psychiatric illness, depression or anxiety revealed that these patients had similar or less evidence of morbidity than controls or other patient groups. It would appear that patients with port wine stains suffer a considerable degree of psychological morbidity which they suppress. This may be related to a need to hide their port wine stain.\r"

Pressure tests were also carried out at regular intervals on seven patients with chronic urticaria who had weals at pressure sites but no history of pressure-induced weals (Kobner weals). These weals coincided with positive pressure tests and it seems likely that they all had DPU but only for a short time. Delayed dermographism was studied in eight patients with DPU. There was a good correlation in time and degree between positive pressure tests and delayed dermographism, confirming that delayed dermographism is in fact DPU provoked by a slightly different mode of pressure.\r"

Compared with the placentas of non-smokers and of those who stopped before pregnancy, it was found that the placentas of smokers and of those who stopped after conception exhibited a reduced capillary volume fraction, and an increased thickness of the villous membrane. Although they must impair gaseous exchange across the placenta, these changes were less severe than suggested by previously published reports. Nonetheless it is clear that in order to prevent these changes women should stop smoking before conception rather than during the course of a pregnancy.\r"

The active contraction area profiles in the three groups were compared with those of matched control groups of nulliparae and multiparae without a uterine scar. Group A had a uterine activity profile similar to that in control nulliparae and significantly higher than that in control multiparae. The uterine activity in group B was less than that in matched nulliparae but was similar to that in matched multiparae. Group C had significantly less uterine activity than matched nulliparae but a similar profile to that in the matched multiparae. Progress of labour into the active phase in the previous pregnancy reduces the uterine activity profile in subsequent labour. Women who had had a vaginal delivery either before or after the CS (group C) exhibited uterine activity profiles similar to multiparae, suggesting that an intact scar did not affect the uterine function.\r"

Fourteen women had slow progress of labour (0.3 cm/h) and were delivered by caesarean section despite adequate and similar augmented uterine activity to that in the women who were delivered vaginally. Those who were delivered by caesarean section had a significantly higher mean maximum dose of oxytocin and a longer period of augmentation. All caesarean sections were for cephalopelvic disproportion and the mean birthweight of babies born by caesarean section (3598 g) was significantly higher than that of babies born vaginally (3230 g). Satisfactory rate of cervical dilatation in the presence of optimal uterine activity is predictive of favourable outcome when oxytocin is used for dysfunctional labour after previous caesarean section.\r"

  ".W": "Serum profiles of growth hormone (GH) were recorded for 24 h in women at different stages of normal pregnancy. Two monoclonal antibodies directed against different epitopes and unaffected by human placental lactogen were used in radioimmunoassays to distinguish the pituitary 22K-GH from the placental GH variant. The 'normal' episodic peak activity of GH in non-pregnant and first trimester pregnant women was dramatically changed into a continuous very stable secretion during late pregnancy. This change was first observed at 17 weeks gestation. It is concluded that during the second half of pregnancy, serum measurements of GH reflect a major contribution from a non-episodically secreted placental GH variant and a concomitant suppression of pituitary GH. This specific signal, i.e. a continuous GH secretion, may be an important regulator of maternal liver metabolism during pregnancy.\r"

The effect was confined to parous women of whom 94% not taking oral contraceptives yielded breast secretions compared with only 51% currently using the pill and 60% of those with a previous history of use. The percentage of nulliparous women yielding breast secretions (30%) was significantly less than that in parous women and was not affected by a present or previous history of contraceptive steroid use. These results provide further evidence of the difference in hormone responsiveness of parous and nulliparous breasts and the potential of oral contraceptive steroids to influence breast function.\r"

Elevated plasma levels of this substance will reflect neutrophil activation in vivo. To determine neutrophil activation in PIH, we studied 30 normal non-pregnant women, 32 women with normal pregnancies, 19 with mild/moderate PIH and 16 with severe PIH between 28 and 39 weeks gestation. Plasma neutrophil elastase was measured by radioimmunoassay. There was a significantly higher concentration of plasma neutrophil elastase in both mild/moderate and severe PIH than in normotensive pregnancies and this may contribute to the vascular lesion associated with PIH. Concentrations were also significantly higher in normal pregnancy than in non-pregnant women which suggests that neutrophil activation and degranulation are increased in normal pregnancy.\r"

Postvoid fundal height measurements were smaller than the prevoid measurements in 69.5% of the women, and 34.5% of the differences were greater than 1.0 cm. Women who had voided within 30 min before measurement had significantly smaller differences between pre- and postvoid fundal height measurements (n = 20, mean 0.16, SD 1.22) than women who voided more than 30 min before measurement (n = 179, mean 0.68, SD 1.27). These findings indicate that women should be instructed to void within 30 min before fundal height measurements are obtained.\r"

All had a progressive spastic paraparesis developing many years after immigration and all 19 tested had antibodies to the human T cell lymphotropic retrovirus type 1 (HTLV1). The clinical and laboratory features and visual, auditory and somatosensory evoked potentials are described. Details of magnetic resonance scanning of the brain and, in a few cases, the spinal cord are compared with those found in multiple sclerosis. The antibody titres to HTLV1 assessed by particle agglutination, Western blot, antibody-directed cell mediated cytotoxicity and pseudotype neutralization were higher than in asymptomatic infected relatives and in patients with adult T cell leukaemia. Some, but not all, of the IgG oligoclonal bands in the CSF were directed against HTLV1. IgM oligoclonal bands directed against HTLV1 were found in 2 patients. Sixty of the 64 first degree relatives of 11 Jamaican patients with TSP were traced in the UK and the Caribbean; 20-30% of those born in the Caribbean had antibodies to HTLV1, irrespective of their present place of residence, whilst none of those born in the UK, who were the children of the patients, had antibodies. The original pathological material obtained from the Caribbean by Montgomery et al. (1964) is reviewed. These results are discussed in relation to animal retroviral neurological diseases, particularly visna in sheep which has clinical and pathological features closely similar to TSP. It is proposed that TSP is due to a HTLV1 infected lymphocyte/macrophage immune-mediated inflammatory response in the spinal cord.\r"

We describe a patient with optic aphasia who could access semantic information relevant to objects he could not name and comprehend written words he could not read. These data suggest that, at least in certain cases, this visual modality-specific naming impairment may not be attributable to impaired visual recognition. We suggest that this patient's preserved object recognition and reading comprehension was mediated by a semantic system supported by the right hemisphere.\r"

  ".W": "Simple unimanual reaction times to lateralized light flashes were measured in 40 normal subjects, 4 commissurotomized patients, and a boy with callosal agenesis. In all subjects, reaction times tended to be shorter when the stimuli were presented on the same side as the response hand (uncrossed condition) than on the opposite side (crossed condition). In 2 experiments, the magnitude of the crossed-uncrossed difference (CUD) was greatest in the commissurotimized patients (ranging from 35 to 96 ms), the acallosal boy showed an intermediate CUD (20 and 12 ms for the first and second experiment, respectively), and normal subjects exhibited the smallest CUD (an insignificant 1 ms difference and a significant 3 ms difference in the first and second experiment, respectively). For all subjects, reaction times increased when the stimulus light intensity was decreased (Experiment 1) or when stimulus eccentricity was increased (Experiment 2). However, the effects of these visual parameters on the CUD revealed group and individual differences. Neither stimulus light intensity nor eccentricity affected the CUD in the normals, in 1 of the commissurotomized patients, and in the acallosal boy. The CUDs in these subjects are attributed to the transfer of nonsensory information via the corpus callosum, via ipsilateral corticospinal tracts, and via the anterior commissure or ipsilateral motor pathways, respectively. The CUDs of 2 commissurotomized patients varied with stimulus eccentricity but not intensity. Subcallosal interhemispheric visual transfer is thus apparently more sensitive to stimulus eccentricity than to intensity. The final commissurotomized patient, R.Y., had slower and less accurate responses to stimuli presented in the right visual hemifield during left, but not right, hand responses. An asymmetry in subcortical visual interhemispheric communication is suspected in this patient. The disparate results amongst these subjects are discussed and contrasted with previous findings. Finally, an information processing model of cortical and subcortical interhemispheric communication is presented.\r"

Changes in neural activity produced by the stimulation were correlated with the time course of paraesthesiae and with changes in the ability to detect cutaneous stimuli. From approximately 20 s after the end of the stimulus train, there was a progressive increase in neural activity, and individual afferents became spontaneously active and discharged in high-frequency bursts. At this time the subjects began to experience paraesthesiae. Repetitive stimulation proximal to a complete digital nerve block induced paraesthesiae that were felt distal to the block in the insensate digit, indicating that they did not arise from the unmyelinated terminal segment of the axon or from a stimulus-induced disorder of receptor function. Recordings of the compound action potential evoked by submaximal test stimuli were made after the 10 min stimulus train and revealed evidence of an early transient increase in excitability superimposed on a long-lasting decrease in excitability, reaching a nadir approximately 30-40 min after the end of the repetitive stimulation. In parallel recordings, there was no detectable change in the cutaneous afferent volley evoked by mechanical stimulation, paraesthesiae, can be attributed directly to a disturbance in peripheral afferent fibres, while the poststimulation negative symptoms such as hypaesthesia arise from stimulation-induced refractoriness at central synaptic relays.\r"

  ".W": "The first reported case of prosopagnosia in a right hemispherectomized woman, B.M., whose intellectual and cognitive functions were otherwise normal or only slightly impaired, is presented. She was totally unable to identify, and to experience a sense of familiarity with, faces of persons she knew, but she could evoke semantic information about them and retrieve their names from visual contextual cues. She was unaware that she was lacking face-recognition skills and that faces alone could be used to access the identity of individuals. The functional nature of her deficit was investigated through sensory, perceptual, memory, and learning tasks to determine the level at which her prosopagnosic disturbance occurred. She was defective at resolving low spatial-frequency information, but this was insufficient to explain the selectivity of her impairment. She was able to carry out cognitive operations specific to faces as long as facial identity did not have to be ascertained, and she performed as well as control subjects at deriving information about the gender, age, and emotion of faces. She was impaired at matching different views of the same faces, and multidimensional scaling analysis of dissimilarity judgements between faces indicated an inability to combine the component features into a configurational facial representation that would uniquely define each face. In contrast to recently reported cases of prosopagnosia, B.M. showed no sign of covert recognition of known faces in a learning task, and there was no indication that she could, even for a few seconds, store a faithful facial representation. The occurrence of prosopagnosia in this hemispherectomized patient confirms that this deficit can emerge without damage to the left hemisphere, and her unawareness of her deficit, which had remained unnoticed for several years, raises the possibility that other hemispherectomized patients may be prosopagnosic. The pattern of cognitive impairments displayed by B.M. indicates a perceptual basis to her disturbance and is discussed in relation to other cases of prosopagnosia.\r"

The present study of upper lip, lower lip, and jaw movements during speech in PD was thus aimed at determining whether (1) PD speech kinematic deficits are comparable to those often observed in simpler limb movements; (2) coordination for multimovement actions such as speech is aberrant in PD, as recently claimed; and (3) the component muscle groups involved in this behaviour manifest uniform deficits. Results indicated that despite reduced amplitudes of jaw and upper lip displacement in PD subjects, all three of these oral movements were of normal duration. Secondly, PD lower lip movements manifested no deficits and bradykinesia (reduced velocity) was only found in movements of the jaw. Finally, there was an indication of movement coordination aberrations in these parkinsonian subjects. Overall, these results not only suggest a difference between orofacial and limb movement impairments in PD, but also document the need to broaden our perspectives on this movement disorder by examining a wider range of functional motor tasks.\r"

  ".W": "The completeness of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) case reporting in Ontario was assessed by reviewing all AIDS death certificates compiled by the Registrar General between Jan. 1, 1985, and Dec. 31, 1987. Several demographic variables were used to match death certificates with cases reported to the provincial AIDS registry. The completeness of case reporting was then estimated by examining the ratio of reported deaths of patients with AIDS to the total number of deaths reviewed. The estimated completeness of case reporting was 81.1% in 1985, 71.5% in 1986 and 75.4% in 1987; the overall rate for 1985-87 was 75.2%. The difference in the completeness of case reporting from year to year was not statistically significant. There was a significant increase from 1985 to 1986 in the proportion of unreported cases in people who had never been married (p less than 0.02). Reporting was not associated with the patient's age, sex, occupation or place of residence. The deficiency in AIDS case reporting could adversely affect the long-term planning of health care resources and the development of programs to prevent and control the spread of AIDS.\r"

The preparations were an oral solution, two types of film-coated tablets and two types of enteric-coated tablets. Blood samples were drawn hourly from 8 am to 6 pm on the day before each study day to assess baseline serum iron concentrations and on the study day. Spectrophotometry was used to measure the serum iron concentrations. The area under the curve (AUC), the maximum concentration and the time to achieve the maximum concentration were compared by analysis of variance. The enteric-coated preparations resulted in AUCs less than 30% of the AUC for the oral solution. The two film-coated products produced AUCs essentially equivalent to that of the oral solution. We conclude that the bioavailability of iron in the enteric-coated preparations was low, relative to that of the film-coated products and the oral solution, and that these products should not be considered interchangeable.\r"

The data were derived from a study comparing rates of macrovascular and microvascular complications among the diabetic subjects and a nondiabetic group matched for age and sex. The data for both groups were collected by means of chart review, interview and body measurement. There were no important differences between the male and female diabetic subjects. Both sexes had high levels of obesity, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and diabetic complications. A total of 86% of the diabetic subjects were obese; the rate was also very high (74%) among the nondiabetic subjects. The mean age at onset of diabetes, 59 years, was 10 years higher than that observed in Oneida Iroquois of Ontario. The rates of macrovascular disease among the diabetic subjects were higher than those found among Cree/Ojibwa in Ontario and Manitoba. Our findings add to the knowledge of non-insulin-dependent diabetes in North American Indians in Canada and show that there are differences between our Mohawk subjects and diabetic people of other native communities.\r"

  ".W": "Sunnybrook Medical Centre is a tertiary care teaching hospital situated in metropolitan Toronto. Its trauma unit, opened in June 1976, serves the inhabitants of metropolitan Toronto and the surrounding area (approximately 5 million). More than 3200 patients were admitted to the unit between 1976 and 1987. The criteria for admission were age at least 14 years and an Injury Severity Score (ISS) of 16 or greater, two or more significant injuries at anatomically discrete sites when the score on the Abbreviated Injury Scale was 3 or greater, or grade IV shock (systolic blood pressure of 80 mm Hg or less). The number of patients admitted annually to the unit increased over the study period. The survival rate also increased, from 76% in 1976 to 88% in 1987, although the average age and ISS of the patients remained unchanged. Less than 2% of the patients required long-term rehabilitative or chronic care. The patient profile is similar to that seen in other trauma centres in North America. The success of this program is largely the result of expeditious stabilization and transfer from referring hospitals coupled with early definitive surgical intervention.\r"

In the fiscal year 1980-81 the rate of application of physical restraints was 52 per 1000 patient-days and the frequency of falls 7 per 1000 patient-days. By 1986-87 the figures were 0.3 and 8.7 per 1000 patient-days respectively; the increase in falls was not clinically significant. During the study period there was a 40% reduction in the use of chemical restraints (psychotropic drugs other than hypnotic and antidepressant agents). Here we record how this change in practice occurred and persisted.\r"

In the current study, a combination of the two drugs (NOAC) was administered to 31 patients with advanced NHL refractory to modern sequential chemotherapy regimens. Ara-C was administered at 3 g/m2 as a 3 hour infusion every 12 hours on day 1 (2 doses) and mitoxantrone at 10 mg/m2/day on days 2 and 3. Of the 18 patients with high-grade malignant NHL, six have attained a complete remission (CR) and two, a partial remission (PR). One CR and 5 PRs were achieved among the other 13 patients with intermediate or low-grade NHL. The median time to relapse (TTR) of patients achieving CR was 7 months with a range from 4 to 17 months. Myelosuppression with subsequent infections was the major toxicity of this regimen. The median duration of severe neutropenia (less than 0.5/nl) was 9 days with a range of 0 to 27 days and the median duration of severe thrombocytopenia (less than 20/nl), 5 days with a range of 0 to 35 days. Infectious complications during cytopenia was seen in 45.3% of the courses administered and fever of unidentified origin was seen in 42.3%. About 63% of the patients were hospitalized for intravenous antibiotic or antimycotic treatment. Other side effects were mild and included nausea, stomatitis, and transient tachycardia of greater than 100/min. Thus, this regimen was active in refractory NHL with poor prognosis, and the toxic side effects were not excessive. Evaluation of the activity of this regimen at higher dose levels of Ara-C is warranted.\r"

Plasma exchange was ineffective in both patients, but plasma perfusion with a staphylococcal protein A column produced a dramatic and permanent response in the second patient. These cases show the importance of considering HUS as a cause of renal failure in such patients who receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy, and support the role of staphylococcal protein A plasma perfusion as treatment for this condition.\r"

The survival curve decrease even after 5 years after pulmonary resection; four of 13 patients who survived more than 5 years subsequently died of metastatic disease and only two patients survived more than 10 years. The number and size of the pulmonary metastases were significantly correlated with postthoracotomy survival. Solitary metastases less than 3.0 cm in diameter were good indicators of favorable postthoracotomy survival. There were no significant differences in survival based on Dukes' classification or location of the primary lesion. Sex, age, disease-free interval between the primary tumor and appearance of metastasis, and extent of pulmonary resection had no influence on survival. It is impossible to say from our experience that surgical resection of pulmonary metastases increased the cure rate. Presumably a good 5-year survival rate after thoracotomy would be a reflection of a length bias caused by the biologic behavior of the metastatic pulmonary lesions.\r"

  ".W": "From April 1985 through March 1988, 24 lung cancer patients with carcinomatous pleuritis were treated with a new combined treatment modality consisting of pulmonary resection and postoperative intrathoracic chemo-thermotherapy (PICT). They consisted of 15 male patients and nine female patients. A majority of the patients (79%%) had adenocarcinoma. The PICT was started 10 to 14 days after the operation. Immediately after a bolus intrathoracic injection of cisplatin (CDDP) 50-100 mg, thermotherapy was carried out using 13.56-MHz or 8.00-MHz radiofrequency waves for 60 minutes. The peripleural temperature was precisely monitored in 20 patients. The temperature was successfully maintained above 42 degrees C for 40 minutes in each of two or three treatment courses in 13 patients, with no complications. However, in the other seven patients the therapy resulted in incomplete treatment because of development of a side effect. Cytologic examination of the pleural effusion, which was performed after the completion of PICT, gave a negative result in 16 of 20 patients examined. The median follow-up period was 16 months. Local relapse was recognized in only three cases who received incomplete treatment or in whom no temperature measurement was performed. The overall survival of the treated patients (n = 24) was significantly prolonged in comparison with a historical control group treated by surgery only (n = 17) or exploratory thoracotomy (n = 11). Of those 17 patients treated by surgery only, ten patients (59%) died of local relapse. These results suggest that this new treatment modality consisting of pulmonary resection and PICT is useful for the treatment of lung cancer patients with carcinomatous pleuritis, especially in the light of improved local control.\r"

Fifteen patients (15.8%) have developed scapular metastases which account for 36.6% of all bone metastases in this series, the majority of which required radiotherapy for pain relief. The scapula was a solitary site of bone metastasis in the majority of patients, and, even when associated with other bone lesions, was frequently an isolated site of pain. A comparative series of 40 consecutive patients with breast cancer metastatic to bone was retrospectively studied. Twenty-five percent of these showed scapular metastases but these were all in association with multiple (greater than 3) other bone metastases; none was symptomatic or required treatment. There was a suggestion that hypernephromas spread more often to the ipsilateral scapula, but the trend did not reach statistical significance. Scapular metastasis in hypernephroma is a common and clinically significant problem, sometimes giving a clue to the primary site. The cause for this predilection is not known.\r"

A review of 371 patients with clinical Stage I malignant melanoma, treated during the period 1970 to 1985, was conducted. The estimated 5-year survival rate for female patients with melanomas 1.0 mm thick was 94%; for each 1-mm increment in thickness the survival rate declined by about 3%, up to the 6 mm mark, the survival rate declining thereafter by about 8% for each additional millimeter in the range of 7 to 15 mm of thickness. The estimated 5-year survival rate for male patients with melanomas 1.0 mm thick was 80%; for each 1-mm increment the survival rate declined by about 9%, up to the 10 mm mark. The proposed method of estimating the expected survival according to the patient's sex and the thickness of the primary lesion hopefully provides a more accurate and convenient method of prognostication for the clinician dealing with specific patients with intermediate or thick melanomas.\r"

  ".W": "Granular cell lesions from many different sites share similar light and electron microscopic features. Immunologically, however, these lesions do not appear to be a homogenous group. This study determines the extent of immunologic heterogeneity of granular cell lesions from a wide variety of sites in skin, mucosa, and jaw. Thirty-one granular cell lesions (26 granular cell tumors [GCT] and five other granular cell lesions) from 18 different sites were evaluated immunohistochemically for keratins, vimentin, desmin, muscle actin, ACT, HLA-DR, and S-100 protein. Paraffin-embedded sections were utilized with an avidin-biotin complex immunoperoxidase technique. Except for ameloblastomas, all lesions were negative for keratin and positive for vimentin. All lesions were negative for desmin and actin. Positive ACT reactivity was found in one of seven GCT of tongue, a colonic lesion, a nose lesion, and a granular cell ameloblastic fibroma. All lesions were positive for HLA-DR except a few in which fixation appeared inadequate. S-100 immunoreactivity was found in all lesions except the congenital epulis, a GCT of the skin of the nose, a colonic lesion, and the odontogenic tumors. The antigenic profile of GCT of skin and mucosa is consistent with Schwann cell origin. However, some GCT and other granular cell lesions appear to be derived from macrophages, epithelial cells, or other cells. The expression of HLA-DR by granular cells is believed to be unrelated to cellular origin but rather to some common immunologic function.\r"

  ".W": "Consecutive serial cryostat-frozen sections of 157 human mammary carcinomas and the uteri of six immature New Zealand white rabbits were stained histochemically for cytoplasmic estrogen receptor (ER) and nuclear ER by a fluorescent estrogen compound (Fluorocep Estrogen, Zeus Technologies, Inc., Raritan, NJ) and by a monoclonal antibody immunoperoxidase technique (ER-ICA, Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL), respectively. The percentage of the ER-positive cells in the cancer cell population under observation was estimated and recorded. The results of the cytoplasmic ER assay were compared with those of the nuclear ER assay in each tumor; all cancers with less than 10% ER-positive cancer cells were grouped together as ER-negative tumors, the cancers with 30% or more ER-positive cancer cells as ER-positive tumors, and those with 10% to 29% ER-positive cancer cells as borderline positive. According to this manner of classification, 94% to 97% of the ER-positive mammary carcinomas diagnosed by one histochemical assay would have been identified as such by the other with no more than 10% difference in the ER-positive cell counts. The majority of ER-positive breast cancer cells and practically all of the luminal lining cells of the immature rabbit endometrium had coexistent cytoplasmic and nuclear ER. In the mammary cancers containing less than 30% ER-positive cancer cells, there was a greater (up to 20%) discrepancy in positive cell counts between the cytoplasmic ER assay and the nuclear ER assay. This discrepancy may be due to sampling errors of small clones of ER-positive cancer cells in two adjacent sections, difference in antigenic determinants between the cytoplasmic and the nuclear ER, and the binding sites in the nuclear ER being preoccupied by estrogen. The findings of this study appear to support the hypothesis that there are ER in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of the mammary carcinoma cells and the epithelial cells of the endometrium.\r"

The types of neoplasia that occurred in this family included cancers of the breast and stomach, multiple myeloma, dermatofibrosarcoma, Wilm's tumor, and leukemia; the latter three occurred in children at an early age. Peripheral lymphocytes from 13 family members were examined for the presence of constitutional chromosomal abnormalities, fragile sites, and mutagen sensitivity. Our data shows that all living members of this family who had cancers were hypersensitive to chromosome breakage induced by bleomycin. In contrast, neither constitutional chromosomal abnormality nor heritable type of folate-sensitive fragile site was observed in any member. The above findings suggest that genetic defects affecting chromosomal breakage and repair may be contributing factors for cancer development in several members of this family.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical and pathologic features of 70 examples of carcinosarcoma (CS) of the breast are reported. Thirty-three neoplasms had infiltrating carcinoma, seven had in situ carcinoma, and 28 had both admixed or contiguous with the sarcomatous component. Squamous carcinoma, present in 15 neoplasms, was the exclusive epithelial component of two. The admixed carcinoma often appeared distinct from the sarcoma component; however, at high magnification transitional differentiation zones and more subtle merging of infiltrating carcinoma with sarcoma were present in most neoplasms. A total of 40 neoplasms were studied by immunohistochemistry for keratins, EMA, vimentin, S-100 protein, and actin. The sarcomatous component in 55% of CS was immunoreactive for keratin, and 98% were immunoreactive for vimentin. A majority were also immunoreactive for actin (77%), and S-100 protein (55%). Ultrastructural examination of the sarcoma in eight neoplasms yielded variable nonspecific findings compatible with sarcoma. These findings indicate biphasic differentiation by cells possessing epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics and suggest myoepithelial origin or differentiation. The cumulative 5-year survival rate for CS was 49%, worse than for other forms of metaplastic carcinoma. The respective 5-year survivals for TNM clinical Stages I, II, and III were 100%, 63%, and 35%. Of patients with axillary dissection, 26% had metastases to axillary lymph nodes with carcinoma as the most frequent component to metastasize. Metastasis was an ominous sign as 33 of 34 patients who developed metastases died from tumor. Local recurrence was not as ominous as 40% who had only local recurrence subsequently died from tumor. Size and microscopic circumscription were also significant prognostic factors.\r"

Epithelial tumors were the most frequent (89%), followed by sarcomas (7.2%). Germ cell and stromal tumors each occurred in 1.9% of cases. Sites of metastasis were nearly identical, with no statistical difference among histologic types. The peritoneum was most frequently involved (83% to 100% of cases), but lymph node metastasis was common (50% to 60% of cases). Metastasis was more common to the paraaortic lymph nodes than to the pelvic lymph nodes. In seven of eight stromal tumors, hepatic metastasis was present but did not cause the patient's death. For epithelial tumors, metastasis to distant sites was dependent on nodal and intraperitoneal disease. However, this was not true in the 31 ovarian sarcomas or the series of germ cell or stromal tumors. This finding supports a hematogenous route of metastasis for ovarian sarcomas. Understanding the metastatic potential of ovarian cancer is important in designing effective treatment regimens.\r"

The 5-year treatment failure rates and survival rates were, respectively, 30% and 100% for well-differentiated, 25% and 88% for myxoid, 60% and 58% for fibroblastic, 100% and 40% for lipoblastic, and 64% and 56% for pleomorphic liposarcomas. Although local recurrence was present in all five subtypes, a significant increment in local failure was seen in patients with high-grade liposarcomas. Distant metastasis after the initial operation was not found in patients with well-differentiated liposarcoma and rare in the patients with myxoid liposarcoma. In contrast, 50% of the patients with fibroblastic, lipoblastic, and pleomorphic liposarcoma had a distant relapse within 5 years.\r"

Almost all BGCT studied by DNA flow cytometry (FCM) have been reported to be diploid. However, the very few cases with lung metastases previously analyzed were all aneuploid. To assess the usefulness of DNA FCM in predicting the metastatic potential of BGCT, seven metastasizing BGCT were studied by DNA FCM using paraffin-embedded tissue. Five were purely diploid, one was tetraploid, and one was aneuploid. The primary and the metastasis showed the same DNA distribution in all but the tetraploid case, in which the metastasis was purely diploid. A single patient, who was in the diploid group, had unresectable tumor in the lungs; she remains alive with stable disease at 30 months. The other six patients, who underwent complete resections of their lung metastases, are free of disease. These results suggest that DNA FCM is not a sensitive method for predicting the metastatic potential of BGCT since most metastasizing cases appear to be diploid.\r"

The impact on women in the reproductive years, on the reproductive health of these women, and on the reproductive outcome of their pregnancies is of substantial concern. Monitoring epidemiologic trends in certain groups will require clever and creative strategies like those of Hoff and colleagues. Additional data may be derived from the CDC's Family of Surveys that will examine HIV prevalence in five groups (in addition to the newborn infant survey described above): intravenous drug users, patients admitted to hospitals, sexually transmitted disease clinic patients, women's health and reproductive health clinics, and tuberculosis clinics. It is hoped that the data obtained from these studies, as well as data gathered on college students and Job Corps applicants, will contribute additional information on HIV infection in women. Monitoring the progress of the AIDS epidemic in women will be difficult. Even more difficult will be the effort to respond to the epidemic in the women it most frequently affects: the poor, minority, disenfranchised women who may be involved in illegal activities (drug use, prostitution, illegal immigration) who are not well networked into the medical and social services of our society.\r"

The oral clearance of propranolol was significantly higher (63%, p less than 0.02) in the men (65.7 +/- 7.7 ml/min/kg; mean +/- SE) than in the women (40.2 +/- 6.2 ml/min/kg). This sex difference was mainly attributable to a 137% higher clearance through the P-450-mediated side-chain oxidation in the men (p less than 0.001). There was also a 52% higher clearance through glucuronidation in the men (p less than 0.02). In contrast, the clearance through the P-450-mediated ring oxidation was not different between men and women. After administration of simultaneous intravenous doses of hexadeuterium-labeled drug (0.1 mg/kg) to 11 of the subjects, there were no differences between men and women in volume of distribution or half-life. Moreover, there were no sex differences in plasma and blood binding of propranolol. This study thus demonstrates that higher plasma levels of propranolol occur in women than in men after oral doses and suggests that some drug metabolizing enzymes, but not others, are regulated by sex hormones in human beings.\r"

Patients with the lowest baseline forearm blood flow levels had the greatest percentage increases in forearm blood flow (r = -0.729, p less than 0.01), and a favorable metabolic effect was documented by a reduction in oxygen extraction across the forearm.

Oral propranolol clearance was reduced 33% +/- 16% (p less than 0.05) by the administration of debrisoquin. As predicted, the 4-hydroxypropranolol partial metabolic clearance was significantly (p less than 0.05) inhibited by debrisoquin. However, the side-chain oxidation pathway, as measured by naphthoxylactic acid, was also significantly (p less than 0.05) inhibited by debrisoquin. Debrisoquin administration did not change the renal clearance of any of the metabolites. These data support the usefulness of the in vivo inhibition model in the prediction of cosegregation of routes of metabolism.

The observations of the transition from heroin to buprenorphine for the first 4 days are described. During this period, subjects reported significantly elevated ratings of \"good effects\" and feelings of \"overall well-being\" and decreased ratings of \"overall sickness.\" Data from subscales of the Addiction Research Center Inventory indicated increasing euphoria and decreasing dysphoria and sedation after buprenorphine administration. Subjects and observers consistently identified buprenorphine as an opiate and not as an opiate antagonist.

This study investigated the time-dependent contributions of quinidine, dihydroquinidine, and the quinidine metabolites to the electrophysiologic effects of a prolonged quinidine infusion in 14 patients referred for management of symptomatic ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Electrophysiologic testing and blood sampling were done at baseline and every 5 minutes throughout a 110-minute quinidine infusion. Changes in ventricular effective refractory periods correlated significantly with serum concentrations of quinidine-N-oxide (r = 0.54; p less than 0.001), 3-hydroxyquinidine (r = 0.50; p less than 0.001), and time (r = 0.52; p less than 0.001) but did not correlate with the quinidine concentrations (r = 0.19). Multiple linear regression revealed that only 3-hydroxyquinidine and time contributed independently to changes in the ventricular effective refractory period. Quinidine concentration was the only variable that contributed independently to changes in ventricular tachycardiac cycle lengths. Time was the only variable that correlated independently with changes in QRS and QTc durations. These data indicate that active metabolites accumulate during an intravenous infusion that attains therapeutic quinidine levels and that quinidine and its metabolites may have different electrophysiologic effects.\r"

The objective of the present investigation was to compare the acetylator phenotypes of white subjects with Down's syndrome with age-matched control subjects, with use of caffeine as the pharmacologic probe. After the ingestion of caffeine-containing beverages, spot urine collections were obtained at 2 and 4 hours in 22 subjects with Down's syndrome and in 22 control subjects (age range of 4 to 49 years). The urinary excretion ratios of 5-acetylamino-6-amino-3-methyluracil (AAMU) to 1-methylxanthine (1X) determined in these 2-hour and 4-hour samples were highly correlated (r = 0.82; p less than 0.001). In addition, more extensive urinary excretion studies performed for an 8-hour period in three subjects with Down's syndrome demonstrated that the coefficient of variability for the ratio of AAMU/1X ranged from 10.1% to 14.2%, which is similar to the reproducibility previously reported for control subjects. A trimodal distribution of acetylator phenotypes was observed, with no differences in average or frequency distribution of ratio values between the subjects with Down's syndrome and the control subjects. This study demonstrates that polymorphic N-acetylator status, as assessed by caffeine metabolism, is similar in subjects with Down's syndrome and in control subjects.\r"

The latter measure was constructed specifically for this study to measure the frequency of oppositional and avoidance behaviors of children regarding diabetes management tasks. Mothers reported that their children displayed significantly more internalizing behavior problems (anxiety, depression, withdrawal) and were a significantly greater source of parental stress compared with corresponding nondiabetic normative group samples. Also, certain maternal attitudes about diabetes and its treatment were correlated with the children's disease-specific behavior problems. The children's general psychological adjustment, however, was not predictive of these diabetes-specific behavior problems.\r"

We therefore hypothesized that the prevalence of clinical proteinuria would be greater among Mexican-American diabetic subjects (n = 317) than among non-Hispanic White diabetic subjects (n = 67). Clinical proteinuria, defined as greater than or equal to 1+ on the Ames Albustix test, was 2.82 times more prevalent in Mexican-American diabetic subjects compared with non-Hispanic White diabetic subjects adjusting for age and duration (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05, 7.55; P = .039). After controlling for other possible confounding variables (i.e., glycemia, systolic blood pressure, smoking, and insulin use), the excess of proteinuria in Mexican-American diabetic subjects was only slightly attenuated, although the statistical significance became borderline (odds ratio [OR] = 2.59, 95% CI = 0.91, 7.32; P = .072).

Moreover, when the same cutoff value (20 micrograms/min) was used to define the normal range, 21% of IDDM patients and 6.3% of NIDDM patients had on the same day normal N-AER and abnormal (greater than 20 micrograms/min) 24-h AER. Although N-AER values were significantly correlated to 24-h AER values (r = 0.67, P less than .001), it was not possible to assess an N-AER value able to predict a 24-h AER value greater than 20 micrograms/min.

Phenytoin (PHT), carbamazepine (CBZ), and valproate (VPA) reduced the ability of mouse central neurons to sustain high-frequency repetitive firing of action potentials (SRF) at therapeutic free serum concentrations. Phenobarbital (PB) and the benzodiazepines (BZDs), diazepam (DZP), clonazepam (CZP), and lorazepam (LZP), also reduced SRF, but only at supratherapeutic free serum concentrations achieved in treatment of generalized tonic-clonic status epilepticus. These AEDs interact with sodium channels to slow the rate of recovery of the channels from inactivation. The BZDs and PB enhanced gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) responses evoked on mouse central neurons by binding to two different sites on the GABAA receptor channel. BZDs increased the frequency of GABA receptor channel openings. In contrast, barbiturates increased the open duration of these channels. VPA enhanced brain GABA concentration and may enhance release of GABA from nerve terminals. Ethosuximide (ESM) reduced a small transient calcium current which has been shown to be involved in slow rhythmic firing of certain neurons. Reduction of SRF, enhancement of GABA-ergic inhibition, and reduction of calcium current may be, in part, the bases for AED action against generalized tonic-clonic, myoclonic, and absence seizures, respectively.\r"

Such investigations have two main objectives: (1) to develop new methods for treating, \"curing,\" or preventing epilepsy: and (2) to learn more about the normal functioning of the human brain, at the cellular/molecular and the neurological/psychological levels by analyzing abnormal brain functioning. The electroencephalogram (EEG) spike is a marker for the hyperexcitable cortex and arises in or near an area with a high epileptogenic potential. The depolarizing shift (DS) that underlies the interictal discharge (ID) appears to be generated by a combination of excitatory synaptic currents and intrinsic voltage-dependent membrane currents. The hyperpolarization that follows the DS (post-DS HP) limits ID duration, determines ID frequency, and prevents ID deterioration into seizures. The disappearance of the post-DS HP in some models is related to the onset of seizures and the spread of epileptiform activity. During the transition to seizures, the usually self-limited ID spreads in time and anatomical space. Several processes may intervene in the pathophysiological dysfunction. These include enhancing GABA-mediated inhibition, dampening NMDA-mediated excitability, interfering with specific Ca2+ currents in central neurons, and perhaps stimulating \"gating\" pathways.\r"

It has become evident that the therapeutic management of epileptic patients would be significantly improved with the elimination of the drawbacks associated with existing antiepileptic drugs. Based on the information accumulated to date, the following set of principles is proposed: (1) The requirement of central nervous system (CNS) penetration automatically creates vulnerability to CNS toxicity. (2) The narrower the therapeutic range of a given drug, the more limiting its pharmacokinetic properties become. (3) The requirements of chronic administration and compliance place narrow limits on the optimum half-life (24 h). (4) The practice of polytherapy and the potential for pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions make it necessary to simplify metabolic schemes (i.e., use of metabolically directed design approaches). (5) New antiepileptic drugs have shown that widely different structures are associated with anticonvulsant properties--it becomes important to minimize toxicity and optimize pharmacokinetic characteristics early in the development of future antiepileptic drugs. (6) Yet-to-be-discovered antiepileptic drugs will probably include biotechnology-based pharmaceuticals. Such biologic agents as neuropeptides present a new set of pharmacokinetic requirements because they are generally receptor targeted, they do not cross absorption barriers easily, and they are labile and subject to degradation.\r"

Nevertheless, spontaneous models of epilepsy are the most commonly used, and chemically or electrically induced seizures in rodents can also identify potential anticonvulsants. In the latter models, the intensity of the seizure stimulus is of paramount importance. The Antiepileptic Drug Development Program evaluates approximately 800 compounds each year, using two models for preliminary screening. One model assesses the ability of a compound to prevent seizure spread; the other weighs the ability to raise seizure threshold. In vivo tests, featuring amygdala- and corneal-kindled seizures, and in vitro assays, employing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors and synaptosomal uptake of adenosine, define drug-drug interactions and elucidate the pharmacological profiles of potential anticonvulsants.\r"

One group of six zygotes was incubated in cytochalasin D for 30 minutes before manipulation. The remaining five zygotes were manipulated without preincubation in cytoskeletal relaxing agents. When cytoskeletal relaxants were used, all six embryos survived manipulation and cleaved. One embryo arrested spontaneously at the two-cell stage; all others cleaved to at least four cells, and one embryo reached the advanced morula stage. Of the five eggs manipulated without prior cytochalasin D and colcemid treatment, none survived for more than 30 minutes after manipulation. In none of the tripronuclear eggs was it possible to definitely identify the male pronuclei. Because development was interrupted for karyotyping, it is likely that these embryos would have otherwise continued to develop to more advanced stages. These results indicate that it is possible to microsurgically \"epronucleate\" tripronuclear human zygotes and obtain further development and that use of cytoskeletal relaxants facilities this manipulative procedure. However, because epronucleated embryos have significant developmental potential, chromosome studies are needed to confirm complete removal of a male pronucleus before such techniques can be applied clinically.\r"

Nine zygotes survived the procedure, and seven cleaved normally (two of which were fixed for chromosome analysis); two proceeded to compact and one cavitated. Eighteen of the polyspermic zygotes (14 with three pronuclei and 4 with four pronuclei) were obtained from zona pellucida-intact oocytes, and seven (1 five-pronucleate 3 four-pronucleate, and 3 three-pronucleate) from previously zona-drilled oocytes. Survival and cleavage occurred in all groups except in four- and five-pronucleate zona-drilled zygotes. Criteria used to identify male pronuclei were (1) pronucleus-associated sperm tails, (2) increased pronucleus size, and (3) greater distance (relative to female pronuclei) from the second polar body. Sperm tails were never seen and pronucleus size usually was identical. Therefore, the third criterion was used, although its reliability should be further evaluated. Until complete pronucleus removal techniques and reliable pronucleus selection criteria are perfected, embryo replacement after polyspermy correction could result in aneuploidy and molar pregnancy.\r"

To test that hypothesis, the spent media of 67 human embryos developed in vitro was evaluated using either the allogeneic one-way mixed lymphocyte response (MLR) or the concanavalin A (Con-A) stimulated lymphocyte response (SLR). Conditioned embryo media was obtained at in vitro fertilization (IVF) in aliquots of (A) the first 24 hours in vitro, (B) the second 24 hours in vitro, and (C) from 24 hours until development of the blastocyst stage. Control media consisted of Ham's F-10 medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) with identical maternal serum concentration to test media. Conditioned media (either A, B, or C) or control media was added to 200-microL wells containing lymphocytes in either the MLR or SLR. A significant suppressive effect of 25% to 60% was observed in seven of nine samples of blastocyst-conditioned media (P less than 0.05). No significant suppressive effect was found in the earlier embryo media (A or B) in either the MLR or the SLR.

Twenty-one ovulatory women with more than 3 years of infertility problems were included in the study. PVP and PVN were highest for detection of urinary luteinizing hormone (LH) peak at ovulation (PVP = 90%, PVN = 95%) and for serum-estradiol peak 1 day before ovulation (PVP = 83%, PVN = 97%). The predictive values were lower for all other tests. The PVP (54%) and PVN (90%) were rather low for detection of ovulation with vaginal electric impedance. However, all ovulations were predicted when urinary LH peak and vaginal impedance were combined. Two women were stimulated with human chorionic gonadotropin to investigate a possible connection between the LH peak and the preovulatory vaginal electric impedance. No close connection between them could be demonstrated. Basal body temperature should not be used for the prediction of ovulation (PVP = 25%). We suggest that ovulation should primarily be predicted from the identification of the urinary LH peak and that other methods be supplementary.\r"

To evaluate the effects of CC on the timing of the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge, we examined the LH surge in 10 cycling normal women for 3 cycles each, during an untreated cycle (control) and during treatment with 50 mg CC (CC 50) and 150 mg CC (CC 150) daily on days 5 to 9. Length of control cycles (mean +/- standard error of the mean) was 28.5 +/- 1.1 days and was not significantly different from either CC 50 (28.2 +/- 0.6 days) or CC 150 cycles (29.0 +/- 0.4 days). LH surge occurred on day 16.4 +/- 1.2 in control, 16.5 +/- 0.5 in CC 50, and 17.1 +/- 0.7 in CC 150 cycles. Similarly, luteal phase lengths were not significantly affected by CC treatment. Individually, however, the effect of CC on the timing of the LH surge depended on when the LH surge occurred in corresponding control cycles. If the control cycle LH surge occurred on day 16 or earlier, CC significantly delayed it. If the normal LH surge occurred on day 18 or later, CC advanced it. During CC 50 treatment, the LH surge was advanced by 1 to 7 days in 3 cycles, unchanged in 2, and delayed in 5 cycles by 1 to 9 days. Detection of urinary LH surge was reliable in CC-treated cycles and correlated well with the day of plasma LH surge.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Plasma prolactin (PRL) was determined in blood samples collected before and at weekly intervals during Cabergoline administration. Cabergoline induced marked inhibition of PRL secretion in conjunction with a CT demonstration of reduction in the pituitary tumor size in all patients. The potent, long-lasting PRL inhibitory effect of Cabergoline and the absence of side effects typical of dopaminergic compounds suggest that the use of this drug is advantageous over others in the medical treatment of hyperprolactinemia.\r"

All serum measurements were normalized to the day of hCG administration (day 0). There was a total of nine pregnancies; two were biochemical pregnancies, whereas 7 of the 22 women had clinical pregnancies (31.8%). Of these, two miscarried and five had term pregnancies (three singleton, two twin). Conception cycles could be differentiated from nonconception cycles by serum E2 levels on day 8 (P = 0.035), by hCG levels on day 11 (P = 0.03), and by P levels on day 14 (P = 0.001). From days 8 to 11, hCG levels plateaued in conception cycles and decreased in nonconception cycles. However, during that period, E2 and P fell in both groups of women. This decline in sex steroids, which was observed in both conception and nonconception cycles, may well negatively influence endometrial development during the peri-implantation period and compromise conception, resulting in failure to conceive, biochemical pregnancy, and early miscarriage.\r"

Although male age and several physical characteristics were related to fertility outcome when all couples were examined, this was, by virtue of these variables, being related to female age and the length of involuntary infertility before investigation. When only those couples were examined in which the female partner was normal on investigation (n = 250), past paternity (x1(2) = 4.21, P = 0.040, RR = 1.81) was the only variable that retained a significant relationship to fertility outcome.

Significant difference in fertility prognosis was found between those who had an SPA greater than 19% and those with an SPA less than 20% (48% versus 20%). Sperm penetration assay greater than 19% was predictive of higher pregnancy rates in both oligospermic (41% versus 17%) and unexplained infertile couples (52% versus 24%).

  ".W": "We examined the role of glucocorticoids in the regulation of pancreatic glandular kallikrein gene expression in vivo and in vitro. Adult male rats were adrenalectomized (Adx). Corticosterone pellets were administered to maintain either physiologic (Adx 1+) or high physiologic (Adx 3+) plasma corticosterone levels. Pancreatic kallikrein mRNA levels were examined by Northern hybridization and quantitated by slot-blot hybridization. Adrenalectomy resulted in a 75% +/- 14% (n = 4) increase in kallikrein mRNA as compared with sham-operated controls. This increase was completely reversed by exogenous corticosterone replacement to normal physiologic concentrations. Replacement with high corticosterone levels (Adx 3+) resulted in a decrease of kallikrein mRNA levels to 53% +/- 4% (n = 4) of controls. A significant negative correlation was observed between individual kallikrein mRNA levels and plasma corticosterone (r = -0.81, n = 12). In vitro, using the rat pancreatic acinar cell line AR42J, dexamethasone decreased kallikrein mRNA steady-state levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner. These data, therefore, indicate that physiologic concentrations of plasma corticosterone decrease pancreatic kallikrein mRNA levels in vivo, and that this is a direct effect on pancreatic acinar cells.\r"

  ".W": "A comparison of the antioxidant protective system and presence of lipid peroxidation was made between rats iron-loaded by two different mechanisms. Superoxide dismutase activity, glutathione peroxidase activity, and reduced glutathione concentrations, together with malondialdehyde production, were measured in the livers of rats chronically iron-overloaded by (a) parenteral iron (primarily Kupffer cell iron deposition) and (b) dietary carbonyl iron (mainly parenchymal iron deposition). In carbonyl iron-treated rats, hepatic superoxide dismutase activity was significantly decreased, whereas hepatocyte lipid peroxidation, as measured by malondialdehyde levels, was significantly increased when compared with control rats at or above iron concentrations of 100 and 185 mumol/g dry wt, respectively. However, no significant decrease in superoxide dismutase activity or significant increase in malondialdehyde levels was observed in iron dextran-treated rats. Glutathione peroxidase activities and reduced glutathione concentrations in rats, iron-loaded by either method, were not significantly different from those of control animals. These results suggest that the deposition of iron in the reticuloendothelial cells of the liver does not lead to lipid peroxidation; however, iron deposited in the parenchymal cells of the liver may lead to an altered free radical antioxidant protective system, resulting in lipid peroxidation in these cells at a similar level of iron loading. We conclude that the cellular site of iron deposition as well as the hepatic iron concentration is important in determining iron-induced liver injury.\r"

No known cause of thrombosis was found but spontaneous formation of erythroid colonies occurred on bone marrow cultures. This indicated the existence of a latent myeloproliferative disorder, a frequent cause of hepatic vein thrombosis. We suggest that this association of a membranous obstruction of the inferior vena cava with a known, albeit often overlooked, cause of hepatic vein thrombosis provides strong support to the thrombosis theory of membrane formation.\r"

Of these, 73 were without dysplasia and 13 had dysplasia (7 low grade, 6 high grade). Eight of the nondysplastic specimens were aneuploid and another 15 had increased G2. Among the dysplastic specimens, two were aneuploid and two had increased G2. These data were grouped into four classifications: type 1 (65 specimens), specialized columnar epithelium (Barrett's) without dysplasia and no aneuploidy; type 2 (8 specimens), Barrett's epithelium without dysplasia and an aneuploid cell population; type 3 (11 specimens), Barrett's epithelium with dysplasia and no aneuploidy; and type 4 (2 specimens), Barrett's epithelium with dysplasia and aneuploidy. Distribution by type was 76%, 9%, 13%, and 2%, respectively. We conclude that histologic dysplasia and aneuploidy are often discordant. They may identify separate subgroups at risk, or when concordant, may reflect an increased cancer risk in that population. Further study will define the role of histology and flow cytometry in the screening and management of patients with Barrett's esophagus.\r"

While awake, acid clearance times of the two groups were equivalent. While asleep, mean acid clearance time increased in subjects with pathologic reflux greater than 500% while remaining essentially unchanged in symptomatic controls. No difference in minimum pH attained during sleep reflux, in percentage of swallows resulting in esophageal peristalsis, or in the frequency of secondary peristaltic waves was found to explain the difference in sleeping acid clearance times in the two groups. However, there was a significant difference between the groups with respect to swallowing rate (p less than 0.01). During sleeping reflux episodes, subjects with pathologic reflux swallowed 0.5 +/- 0.1 times per minute (mean +/- SEM), whereas controls who refluxed swallowed 3.5 +/- 1.3 times per minute. During awake reflux episodes the swallowing rates were equivalent in the two groups, 4.1 +/- 0.4 and 4.7 +/- 0.7 per minute, respectively. We conclude that low swallowing rate during sleeping reflux episodes is primary to the delayed clearance of sleeping reflux in these infants.\r"

The mean daily dose of omeprazole required to control gastric acid secretion was 82 +/- 31 mg. Thirty-one patients required omeprazole once per day. In 9 patients acid output was not controlled by 120 mg once per day, but was controlled by 60 mg every 12 h. The daily dose of omeprazole correlated with the previous dose of histamine H2-receptor antagonist (r = 0.89, p less than 0.001), basal acid output (r = 0.43, p less than 0.01), and maximal acid output (r = 0.39, p less than 0.02) but not with serum concentration of gastrin (r = -0.32). Increases in the dose of omeprazole were required in 9 patients. Twenty-nine patients had mild peptic symptoms with acid outputs less than 10 mEq/h while taking histamine H2-receptor antagonists. Symptoms resolved completely in 23 patients and partially in 3 when taking omeprazole. Omeprazole prevented mucosal disease in all patients including 17 in whom histamine H2-receptor antagonists had produced only partial resolution despite acid output being less than 10 mEq/h and in those with symptoms during omeprazole therapy. Omeprazole therapy was not associated with any significant side effects, nor with any evidence of hematologic or biochemical toxicity. Serum concentrations of gastrin did not change significantly during therapy. In 6 patients treated with omeprazole for 1 yr there was no change in basal or maximal acid output. In all patients, gastric morphology and histopathology demonstrated no evidence of gastric carcinoid formation. These results demonstrate that with long-term treatment of up to 4 yr, omeprazole is safe, with no evidence of hematologic, biochemical, or gastric toxicity. Furthermore, omeprazole remained effective, with only 23% of patients requiring an increase in dose, and continued to control symptoms in patients who had not been entirely symptom-free despite high doses of histamine H2-receptor antagonists. Omeprazole is now the drug of choice in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.\r"

To elucidate the physiologic significance of the cycles and tissue thiol status during stress-induced gastric mucosal injury, dynamic aspects of glutathione metabolism were analyzed in rats that were treated with water-immersion restraint. This treatment induced gastric mucosal lesion with concomitant decrease in the levels of perchloric acid-soluble thiols in various tissues, particularly in the liver and stomach. During the treatment, glutathione levels markedly decreased in the liver but not in other tissues. Depletion of hepatic glutathione by buthionine sulfoximine, a specific inhibitor for gamma-glutamyl cysteine synthetase, markedly decreased hepatic glutathione levels and increased the gastric injury. Intraperitoneal injection of reduced glutathione significantly increased plasma levels of glutathione and inhibited the occurrence of gastric injury without affecting intracellular glutathione levels. These results indicate that extracellular glutathione and its interorgan metabolism might play a critical role in the protection of gastric mucosa particularly when animals were challenged with various stress.\r"

Intravenous infusion of cimetidine was found to reduce by 45% the postprandial increment in plasma somatostatin-like immunoreactivity. This effect was reversed by concomitant intragastric administration of 0.1 N hydrochloric acid, which in previous studies in fasted subjects had not affected plasma somatostatinlike immunoreactivity. The effects of cimetidine on postprandial plasma gastrin were the inverse of those observed on postprandial somatostatin. There was a greatly enhanced increment in postprandial plasma gastrin during cimetidine infusion, which was reduced significantly toward control levels by concomitant intragastric infusion of hydrochloric acid. To exclude direct inhibition by cimetidine of nutrient-stimulated plasma somatostatinlike immunoreactivity we studied the effect of cimetidine on plasma somatostatinlike immunoreactivity stimulated by an intraduodenal infusion of fat. Cimetidine did not alter the incremental response of somatostatinlike immunoreactivity to intraduodenal fat infusion. These data show that cimetidine does not invariably reduce nutrient-stimulated plasma somatostatinlike immunoreactivity and are consistent with the hypothesis that the action of cimetidine in reducing the plasma somatostatin response to ingestion of a meal is a consequence of reduction of postprandial acid secretion. These data suggest that the postprandial elevation in plasma somatostatin observed in humans is mediated in part through postprandial secretion of gastric acid, which in turn acts to elevate plasma somatostatin.\r"

When added to rabbit reticulocyte lysates, this poly A+ RNA stimulated [35S]methionine incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material. Fluorographic analysis of the lysates showed protein synthesis to be dominated by polypeptides with molecular weights from 40,000 to 50,000, presumably prepepsinogen isoforms. Immune precipitation of the lysates with monoclonal antibodies directed against the gastric H+,K+-adenosine triphosphatase yielded bands at 94 kilodaltons and more diffuse banding at 180 kilodaltons. Further purification of the poly A+ RNA on sucrose gradients eliminated prepepsinogen messenger RNA; nascent H+,K+-adenosine triphosphatase synthesized by purified messenger RNA consisted of polypeptides with molecular weights between 88,000 and 94,000. The study indicates that cell-free translation of gastric mucosal messenger RNA may provide a useful model for analysis of gastric H+,K+-adenosine triphosphatase biosynthesis and processing.\r"

In physiologic saline, the pHi determined with the fluorescent dye 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein was 7.00 +/- 0.03 (n = 20) but was 6.68 +/- 0.04 (n = 25) when there was no Na+ in the medium, indicating an important role of external Na+ in maintaining pHi at neutral level. When Na+ was added to an incubation medium lacking the ion, the pHi increased. The time-course of this alkalinization depended on the Na+ concentration, whereas K+ had only a slight effect. Amiloride (1 mM) completely inhibited the Na+ effect, thereby showing the basic role of the Na+/H+ antiport in the regulation of pHi. The effect of 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid and furosemide showed that there also exists an anionic component in the process, probably of the Cl-/OH- (HCO3-) exchange type. These results show that the amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ antiport plays an important but not exclusive role in maintaining the pHi neutral or slightly alkaline in isolated intestinal cells from the hamster.\r"

  ".W": "Individuals with sufficient intestinal lactase hydrolyze ingested lactose to galactose and glucose and these monosaccharides are absorbed. Lactose is not digested completely when intestinal lactase activity is low and the disaccharide is malabsorbed. Breath hydrogen excretion after lactose ingestion is used commonly to diagnose lactose malabsorption. However, no direct tests are currently used to assess lactose absorption. We tested a new method of assessing lactose absorption in 26 healthy individuals. Each subject ingested 50 g of lactose. Participants were evaluated for lactose malabsorption using a standard 3-h breath hydrogen test. In addition, the urinary excretions of galactose, lactose, and creatinine were quantitated for 3-5 h after lactose ingestion. On the basis of breath hydrogen analysis after lactose ingestion, 12 individuals were lactose malabsorbers (defined as a rise in the breath hydrogen concentration of greater than 20 parts per million above the baseline value). The 14 subjects who did not malabsorb lactose by breath hydrogen testing (defined as a rise in the breath hydrogen concentration of less than or equal to 20 parts per million above the baseline value), had significantly more galactose in their urine 1, 2, and 3 h after lactose ingestion than lactose malabsorbers. The ratio of excreted lactose to excreted galactose was significantly decreased in lactose absorbers compared with lactose malabsorbers (p less than 0.001). Determination of the ratio of urinary galactose to urinary creatinine separated lactose absorbers from lactose malabsorbers completely (p less than 0.001). We conclude from this study that the determination of urinary galactose, urinary lactose/galactose ratio, and urinary galactose/creatinine ratio may be used to assess lactose digestion and absorption in healthy adults.\r"

Despite the existence of studies on the prevalence and incidence of inflammatory bowel disease in relation to the continent of residence or origin, there are no studies on the specific countries of origin of Ashkenazi Jewish patients. We report here the first analysis of 233 U.S. Jewish patients by defined world regions and subregions. Using two different sets of controls (a self-referred Jewish population for Tay-Sachs disease carrier detection and a sample of Jewish persons ascertained through unrelated studies from the same hospital as our patients), we found a significant excess of patients of middle European origin relative to those of Polish or Russian origin. These observations suggest that the inflammatory bowel disease gene(s) are more prevalent in the Jewish population that originated in middle Europe than in those from Poland and Russia. These results further suggest that Jewish patients with inflammatory bowel disease probably represent a nonrandom genetically predisposed subset of the Jewish population. This provides further evidence for the genetic contribution to inflammatory bowel disease in general, and to its higher risk in the Jewish population.\r"

Six strain gauge transducers were implanted on the small intestine of each dog. Long-term hyperthyroidism was induced by subcutaneous administration of 100 and 200 micrograms/kg.day of thyroxin. Application of thyroxin did not interrupt the cyclic fasting motor activity. Thyroxin (100 micrograms/kg.day) caused a slight increase in the period of the migrating motor complex (p less than 0.05). The maximum contractile frequency rose dose-dependently up to 11% (p less than 0.05). During phase 2 and the digestive state the contraction frequency increased up to 29% and 27%, respectively (p less than 0.05). More contractions occurred in groups during the digestive state in hyperthyroidism. Half of the dogs showed giant migrating contractions during thyroxin administration, whereas those contractions were not observed during the control period. We conclude that fasted and postprandial intestinal motility is changed in experimental hyperthyroidism. Acceleration of small bowel transit may be caused by changes in contractile pattern of phase 2 and the digestive state or by the increased frequency of giant migrating contractions.\r"

Measurement of colonic transit of radiopaque markers divided patients into those with normal transit (n = 10) and those with slow transit (n = 15). As measured by the Hopkins Symptom Checklist, patients with normal transit constipation demonstrated significantly higher scores for psychological distress in the global symptoms index and nine clinical subscales than did those with slow transit constipation and gastrointestinal control subjects (n = 25). Both groups with constipation had decreased rectal sensation compared with controls but there was no relationship to rectal compliance or threshold of internal sphincter relaxation. There was also no relation between abnormalities of anorectal parameters, including expulsion dynamics, and psychological profiles in two groups. Measurement of colonic transit and psychological profiles in patients with severe idiopathic constipation identify two groups of patients with respect to possible pathogenesis of symptoms. Accordingly, different therapeutic approaches may be required, one behaviourally and psychologically based and the other focused on the possible modification of disordered colonic transit.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate whether the hypercholeresis seen in cirrhotic humans and animals is due to ductular proliferation or altered inactivation of secretin, or both, we studied the response of bile flow and biliary erythritol clearance to synthetic porcine secretin in rats rendered cirrhotic by chronic exposure to phenobarbital/carbon tetrachloride (n = 11) and untreated control rats (n = 5). Bile duct mass was determined morphometrically. Furthermore, plasma disappearance of secretin was measured by radioimmunoassay. Basal bile flow did not differ between the two groups. Whereas secretin had no effect in the control group, it stimulated bile flow by 49% +/- 33% in the cirrhotic group (p less than 0.001). Erythritol bile-to-plasma ratio was lower and biliary bicarbonate concentration higher in the cirrhotic rats, suggesting some ductular contribution to bile flow even in the absence of secretin. Biliary bicarbonate concentration did not increase further during secretin administration, whereas bile salt concentration decreased from 27 +/- 6 to 18 +/- 4 mM. The elimination half-life of secretin was not affected by cirrhosis, averaging 5 +/- 2 min in both groups. Bile duct volume was increased in cirrhotics (2.9% +/- 1.4% vs. 0.2% +/- 0.1%; p less than 0.01) and showed an excellent correlation with the maximal secretin-induced increment of bile flow. Our results suggest that the proliferating ductules contribute to bile flow and that increased secretin responsiveness is not due to altered pharmacokinetics in cirrhotic rat liver.\r"

The time interval between the preoperative and postoperative endoscopic examinations ranged from 0.8 to 9.8 yr (mean 4.7 yr). The partial gastrectomy specimen, which had been resected at the initial operation, was available for assessment in 12 patients (50%). Biopsy specimens were assessed for the presence of C. pylori and scored for severity of reflux gastritis by the use of a histologic grading system. Ten of the 12 partial gastrectomy specimens (83%) were C. pylori-positive. Only 13 of the 24 patients (54%) were C. pylori-positive before the Roux-en-Y operation, rising to 22 (92%) after biliary diversion (p = 0.008). The median reflux score was 6 in the partial gastrectomy specimens; it rose to 11 before the Roux-en-Y operation and fell again to 6 after biliary diversion (p less than 0.001). These results suggest that C. pylori may recolonize the gastric remnant after biliary diversion.\r"

The series included 97 patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and 40 patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma. With TAE using doxorubicin infusion, a partial response of the tumor was seen in only 11%, and the 2-yr survival was calculated to be only 5%. Histologic examination of the specimens obtained by hepatectomy also showed that this treatment was relatively ineffective in daughter tumor and portal tumor thrombi. In contrast, TAE with infusion of cisplatin/ethiodized oil mixture significantly increased the rate of partial response (38%), and significantly prolonged the 2-yr survival (45%). Histologically this treatment gave severe necrosis in daughter tumors (69%) and tumor thrombi (78%) as well as main tumor (75%). This treatment was significantly better than TAE with doxorubicin and ethiodized oil infusion in terms of the tumor regression and histologic responses of main tumor and portal vein tumor thrombi, but not in terms of the 2-yr survival. However, 2 patients (8%) died within 4 wk of the latter treatment, whereas no deaths were reported after the former treatment. Therefore, TAE combined with intraarterial infusion of cisplatin/ethiodized oil mixture may be a safe and useful treatment modality for hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

The almost complete region of the hepatitis B virus X gene was expressed in Escherichia coli, with the resulting protein being approximately 17 kilodaltons in molecular weight. Sera from 139 subjects were analyzed by Western blot analysis. Of the hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients, anti-X was not found in 4 patients with acute hepatitis and in 12 healthy carriers, but was present in 41% (21/51) of the patients with chronic hepatitis, 63% (15/24) of those with liver cirrhosis, and 46% (12/26) of those with hepatocellular carcinoma. The expression of the X product in the liver tissues (43 hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients) was investigated using an indirect immunohistochemical method. The X protein was observed in 64% (21/33) of the patients with chronic hepatitis and 50% (5/10) of those with liver cirrhosis, and was found when the serum was negative for anti-X. Hepatitis B core antigen was frequently expressed together with the X protein in the liver. The conclusions reached were that the frequency of anti-X increases with the length of chronic hepatitis B virus infection, that anti-X may suppress the expression of the X protein in the liver, and that the X protein may be related to hepatitis B virus replication.\r"

The elderly are predisposed to UTI by anatomic changes in the genitourinary system, by underlying disease, by instrumentation, and by residing in long-term care settings. Indwelling urinary catheters are a frequent cause of UTI, and catheter-associated sepsis is the most common cause of gram-negative sepsis in hospitals. Resistant organisms, prevalent in long-term care settings and hospitals, are increasingly responsible for UTI. Empiric antibiotic therapy has changed with the availability of new agents that cover resistant organisms. Oral antibiotics are appropriate for most UTIs; however, more serious infections require parenteral therapy. Length of antibiotic therapy is generally increased for UTI in the elderly.\r"

All parameters were evaluated monthly, and bile acid composition was measured by capillary gas-liquid chromatography. At the time of admission, all patients showed intense pruritus, and their serum alkaline phosphatase, AST and ALT levels were elevated 4.3, 2.7 and 2.3 times over control values. Serum bile acids were elevated almost 38-fold with 2.5 times more cholic acid than chenodeoxycholic acid. Urinary bile acid output was elevated 28 times the control values, and 36% were 1 beta-hydroxycholic acid, 1 beta-hydroxydeoxycholic acid and hyocholic acid (3 alpha,6 alpha, 7 alpha-trihydroxy-5 beta-cholanoic acid). Three months of placebo administration did not significantly affect the clinical or biochemical presentations, and the serum and urinary bile acid composition did not change. In contrast, ursodeoxycholic acid feeding (12 to 15 mg per kg per day) for 6 months abolished pruritus in two and lessened itching in two subjects and reduced serum alkaline phosphatase, AST and ALT levels by 21, 35 and 47%, respectively. The mean values for the total serum bile acid concentrations in these patients declined 26% from the pretreatment value, but the proportion of ursodeoxycholic acid increased from 3 to 40% of the total bile acids; thus, total fasting serum endogenous bile acid levels decreased almost 50%. Similar changes were noted in the urinary bile acids, in which ursodeoxycholic acid became the major bile acid, and approximately 18% were hydroxylated at C-1, C-6 and C-21.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A randomized, double-blind, 1-year pilot study of prednisolone treatment for primary biliary cirrhosis was undertaken. Nineteen patients received 30 mg prednisolone per day initially, with a maintenance dose of 10 mg per day. Seventeen patients received placebo. The groups were matched for age, menopausal status, hepatic histological stage and bilirubin. Treatment was well tolerated without dropouts. Two patients receiving prednisolone developed diabetes, one a duodenal ulcer and one depression. One patient receiving placebo died for liver failure after 3 months. Cholestatic symptoms (itch and fatigue) improved on prednisolone. There was significant (prednisolone vs. placebo) improvement in transaminase (p = 0.0214), alkaline phosphatase (p = 0.0032), procollagen III peptide (p = 0.0103), immunoglobulin G (p = 0.0012) and liver histology (p = 0.016); these changes were greatest among noncirrhotic patients. No patient developed skeletal symptoms. Fifty-seven per cent had abnormal triolein breath tests prior to treatment, and 65% had abnormally low calcium absorption tests. Calcium absorption increased significantly in the treated group vs. placebo at 2 weeks (p less than 0.02), but not at 1 year. Femoral photon absorptiometry fell in the prednisolone group after 1 year (-3.5% vs. placebo +0.5%, p less than 0.05), as did trabecular bone volume (-6% vs. -2.8%, p less than 0.005) and resorption surface (-11% vs. +2%, p less than 0.02) on serial bone biopsy. Prednisolone seems to exert a favorable hepatic effect in primary biliary cirrhosis but at the expense of increased bone loss to approximately twice the expected rate. Prednisolone treatment merits further assessment in primary biliary cirrhosis over a longer period, with attention to selection of patients most likely to benefit and continuing observation of bone mass to better establish the \"cost/benefit\" ratio.\r"

  ".W": "The natural history of primary sclerosing cholangitis was assessed in 174 patients; 37 were asymptomatic and 137 had symptoms related to underlying liver disease. At the time of diagnosis, the mean age was 39.9 years, 66% of the primary sclerosing cholangitis patients were male and 71% had associated inflammatory bowel disease, most commonly chronic ulcerative colitis. Long-term follow-up (mean: 6.0 years; range: 2.7 to 15.5 years) was available in all patients. During follow-up, 59 (34%) of the patients died: 55 in the symptomatic group and four in the asymptomatic group. Median survival from the time of diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis at the Mayo Clinic was 11.9 years. Survival in the asymptomatic group was significantly decreased compared with that in a control population matched for age, race and sex. Multivariate analysis (Cox proportional hazards regression modeling) revealed that age, serum bilirubin concentration, blood hemoglobin concentration, presence or absence of inflammatory bowel disease and histologic stage on liver biopsy were independent predictors of high risk of dying. The development of a multivariate statistical survival model is a major step in identifying individual primary sclerosing cholangitis patients at low, moderate and high risk of dying. Such models will be useful for stratifying patients in therapeutic trials, in patient counseling and in patient selection and timing of liver transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "Transport of taurocholate into the hepatocyte against unfavorable chemical and electrical gradients occurs via a sodium-dependent, carrier-mediated transport system. Although this cotransporter has been characterized in the rodent, it has not been demonstrated in man. Therefore, we utilized human liver, obtained via multiorgan donation but not used for transplantation, to prepare basolateral (sinusoidal) liver plasma membrane vesicles by a Percoll gradient method. Na+,K+-ATPase, a marker enzyme for the basolateral domain, was enriched 28.9-fold in the final membrane fraction compared with homogenate, whereas the bile canalicular membrane enzymes Mg++-ATPase and alkaline phosphatase were enriched only 3.4- and 6.4-fold, respectively. Marker enzyme activities for endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes and mitochondria were not enriched compared with homogenate. Integrity of the membrane vesicles was confirmed by the demonstration of Na+-dependent concentrative uptake of the amino acid L-alanine (estimated intravesicular volume of 0.59 microliter per mg protein). An inwardly directed 100 mM Na+ gradient stimulated the initial rate of 2.5 microM taurocholate uptake and energized a transient 2-fold accumulation of the bile acid above equilibrium (\"overshoot\"). In contrast, uptake was slower and no overshoot occurred with a K+ gradient. A negative intravesicular potential, created by altering accompanying anions or by valinomycin-induced K+ diffusion potentials, did not enhance taurocholate uptake, suggesting an electroneutral cotransport mechanism. Chloride as the accompanying anion stimulated the initial rate of uptake compared with anions of lesser or greater lipid permeability. Na+-dependent taurocholate (4 microM) uptake was significantly inhibited by 250 microM cholate, taurocholate, glycocholate, taurochenodeoxycholate and bromsulfophthalein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Preoperative treatment with orally administered deoxycholic acid prevented endotoxin-related complications, such as renal malfunction. Other bile acids, however, were less effective, and the mechanism of action is not known. Endotoxin toxicity is considered to be largely mediated by tumor necrosis factor/cachectin, a cytokine release by mononucler phagocytes. Therefore, we studied the influence of different bile acids on endotoxin-induced tumor necrosis factor production by monocytes in vitro. Bile acids inhibit tumor necrosis factor production through a direct inhibitory effect on the monocytes. Deoxycholic acid was the most effective, chenodeoxycholic acid was less effective and ursodeoxycholic acid was ineffective in the concentrations used. Bile acids did not inactivate endotoxin as measured in a chromogenic Limulus amebocyte lysate assay. The therapeutic effect of bile acids in obstructive jaundice can be explained by an inhibition of endotoxin-induced tumor necrosis factor release by mononuclear phagocytes.\r"

Whereas expression of duck hepatitis B pre-surface antigen was constant during this time, expression of duck hepatitis B core antigen and of viral DNA rapidly declined. This diminished production of viral components in vitro was paralleled by a change of the hepatocytes toward a fibroblast-like morphology. Supplementation of cell culture medium with 2% dimethyl sulfoxide, a solvent known to maintain the differentiated state of cultured cells, retained competence of the cultured hepatocytes to express duck hepatitis B core antigen and duck hepatitis B virus DNA at high levels. In a second set of experiments, duck hepatitis B virus negative hepatocytes were infected with duck hepatitis B virus from serum of congenitally infected ducks. Dimethyl sulfoxide remarkably improved the competence of cultured duck hepatocytes to become productively infected. This function was maintained for at least 12 days postplating.\r"

Three days after surgical denervation of the liver, hemodynamic studies (radioactive microsphere method) were conducted in conscious rats. The efficacity of the liver denervation procedure was confirmed by a significant decrease in norepinephrine content in various lobes of the liver. Liver denervation did not affect either systemic or splanchnic resting hemodynamics. However, hemorrhage (2 ml per 100 gm body weight) induced a decrease in cardiac index which was significantly more marked in rats with liver denervation (-62 +/- 3%) than in sham-operated rats (-47 +/- 5%; p less than 0.05). This more severe response to hemorrhage may be due to a lack of portal territory vasoconstriction since the fraction of cardiac output reaching portal territory did not decrease during hemorrhage in rats with liver denervation (16 +/- 1% to 14 +/- 1%) but significantly decreased in sham-operated rats (from 15 +/- 1% to 11 +/- 1%, p less than 0.05), this value being significantly lower, after hemorrhage, in sham-operated rats than in denervated rats. The results confirm the lack of tonic neural influence on hepatic circulation during physiological experimental conditions and indicate that hepatic nerve function has a significant contribution to the overall cardiovascular homeostasis.\r"

In cirrhotic and sham-operated rats, clonidine (20 micrograms per kg body weight, intravenously) significantly reduced portal, pressure from 19.0 +/- 0.6 to 14.5 +/- 1.0 mmHg and from 9.8 +/- 0.9 to 7.3 +/- 0.5 mmHg, respectively. No significant change in systemic hemodynamics was observed. In cirrhotic rats, clonidine reduced portal pressure, probably by producing a significant increase in portal tributary vascular resistance leading to a 25% decrease in portal tributary blood flow (radioactive microsphere method). In sham-operated rats, clonidine reduced portal pressure presumably by decreasing hepatic portal vascular resistance, since no significant change in portal tributary blood flow was observed. In both groups, clonidine administration significantly decreased plasma noradrenaline concentration. Placebo administration produced neither significant hemodynamic nor significant plasma noradrenaline concentration change. These findings indicate that the sympathetic regulation of the splanchnic circulation is impaired in cirrhotic rats.\r"

  ".W": "We attempted to ascertain the mechanism of portal hypertension and ascites complicating acute hepatitis in 66 patients who underwent transvenous liver biopsy and measurement of hepatic venous pressure gradient. Increase in hepatic venous pressure gradient was related to the severity of acute hepatitis, as indicated by the significant correlation between the values for hepatic venous pressure gradient and serum bilirubin, serum albumin or coagulation factor V, and by its higher value in patients with, than in patients without, encephalopathy. Hepatic venous pressure gradient was higher in patients with, than in patients without, ascites (12.5 +/- 3.4 vs. 8.4 +/- 3.6 mmHg, respectively; p less than 0.001). No ascites was clinically detectable in the patients in whom hepatic venous pressure gradient was below 6 mmHg. We tested the hypothesis that sinusoidal collapse due to liver cell dropout was a major factor in portal hypertension. Semiautomatic determination of the fractional area of sinusoidal collapse on chromotrope-stained sections and automatic measurement of Sirius red-stained collagen fiber density were performed. Hepatic venous pressure gradient significantly correlated with fractional sinusoidal collapse area (r = 0.61, p less than 0.001) and with Sirius red-stained collagen fiber density (r = 0.43, p less than 0.01). We conclude that portal hypertension in the course of acute hepatitis is related to the severity of liver damage and is a major factor in the development of ascites. Portal hypertension is mainly determined by intrahepatic vascular space being reduced by the collapse of sinusoids.\r"

The different cephalosporins share the same basic molecular structure, yet they exhibit varied extent of plasma protein binding. Different amounts of the antibiotics may be removed by the ultrafiltration procedure because of these variations of physicochemical properties. We evaluated the sieving of eight new cephalosporins across the hemofilter membrane using an in vitro model. Bovine blood was perfused through polysulfone membranes at blood and ultrafiltrate flow rates of 100 and 20 ml/min respectively. Arterial plasma, venous plasma and ultrafiltrate drug concentrations were used to determine sieving coefficients. The sieving coefficients correlated well with the ultrafiltrate-arterial plasma drug concentration ratio (r = 0.679-0.972) but poorly with the extent of protein binding. Factors other than protein binding may therefore affect the drug sieving. Based on the findings, it was predicted that 0.2-21.9% of the daily cephalosporin dose may be removed by the CAVU and CAVH treatment. The need to alter drug dosages depends on the techniques of the ultrafiltration and hemofiltration procedure, the kinetics of the cephalosporins in patients, the sensitivity of the pathogen and the nature of the infection.\r"

Clinically, a column packed with glassbead adsorbents was concomitantly used with CF. The second filtrate was passed through the column and returned to the patient. The removal rate of immunosuppressive substances with molecular weight lower than albumin was only 20% by CF alone, but more than 50% by CF combined with glassbead adsorbents. Clinical symptoms such as severe back pain and general malaise were drastically improved during and after therapy. These results suggest that CF combined with glassbead adsorbents is an effective adjunctive modality to cancer therapy.\r"

Reasons for the shortage are examined and reframing the problem from a shortage of nurses to a shortage of professional nursing practice is suggested as a strategic first step in solving the problems of nurse staffing in acute care general hospitals. Four kinds of shortage situations are identified; only one kind, vacancy, results from vacant positions. The other three types, transient, position, and scheduling, are the result of administrative decisions regarding the use of nursing personnel. A fundamental restructuring of how hospitals use nurses is needed, and this solution will in the long run be more effective in solving the shortage problem than is the effort simply to add more nurses into the existing system.\r"

A comprehensive understanding of the variables of oxygen transport and hypoxemia is essential to ensure correct data interpretation. The accuracy and clinical limitations of pulse oximeters and sensors are presented in this article. The clinical utility of pulse oximetry monitoring in critically ill adults is discussed, with consideration given to patient selection and specific procedures that incur hypoxemic risk.

The process of nursing assessment and diagnosis facilitates the identification of actual and potential health problems and the organization and direction of the planning, implementation, and evaluation of nursing care in striving for optimal patient outcomes. The nursing diagnosis of ineffective airway clearance describes a problem for which many hospitalized patients are at risk because of either acute or chronic illness. Admission to the intensive care unit is often necessary to attain and maintain airway patency, and both autonomous nursing and collaborative interventions are implemented. Standards of nursing care guide professional practice and provide a method of assessing quality of care and achievement of patient outcomes. The standard of care developed for ineffective airway clearance encompasses the areas of etiology, defining characteristics, assessment criteria, process criteria, outcome criteria, and evaluation.\r"

Because both groups had similar responses to weaning, the differences between the groups was nonsignificant and therefore the hypothesis was not supported.\r"

In the late 1970s, Gruentzig overcame initial technical hurdles and performed the first coronary balloon angioplasty. Since then, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty has been progressively refined and now constitutes a major medical intervention in the treatment of coronary disease.

The 30 subjects, who were receiving heparin infusions after a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), had femoral intraarterial lines. With use of a counterbalanced design, APTT values determined in two serial samples of venous and arterial blood were compared for the 30 subjects. The venous blood samples were drawn at the same time as the comparable arterial blood samples. The arterial blood samples were withdrawn after discarding arterial blood equal to four or six times the indwelling catheter volume. A significance level of 0.01 was established to increase statistical control. A histogram was developed from the differences between the arterial and venous blood samples for each of the two groups (four times and six times the discard volume). The histogram indicated that three of the 30 subjects had arterial-venous APTT differences that exceeded 19 seconds when four times the discard volume was used. In the samples where six times the discard volume were used, only one person had an APTT reading greater than 8 seconds. Paired t tests revealed statistically significant differences between the arterial and venous APTT values (t = 2.95, df = 29, p less than 0.01) for discards of four times the catheter dead space volume, whereas no statistically significant difference was found between the arterial and venous APTT values (t = 2.62, df = 28, p greater than 0.01) for discards of six times the dead space volume.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of this 2 by 3 factorial design study was to examine the relationship between the method of instruction and the quality of retention of one-person CPR skills at 4 and 8 months after the initial class. The two methods of instruction under consideration were a BLS-course A (hospital-wide Heartsaver course) and a BLS-course C (Basic Cardiac Life Support course). In addition, the variable of potential use of CPR skills was studied. The three levels of potential use (high, medium, low) were identified according to the area of work, such as critical care, general medical-surgical, and obstetrics-psychiatric, respectively. Other variables that were described in the literature were education, practice of skills, current position, years in profession, previous CPR training, motivation, and felt level of competence. These variables also were included in the study to find out the total variable impact on CPR retention. At least 30 registered nurses were selected from each of the high, medium, and low use areas and randomly assigned to one of the instruction groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To our knowledge, there have been no reports on the histology of fetal growth plates that are affected by this disorder. To characterize this focal developmental anomaly further, we studied the histopathology of the growth plates and epiphyses from a twenty-one-week fetus with unilateral proximal femoral focal deficiency. Although the shape of the cartilaginous anlage of the fetus appeared normal, the growth plate of the proximal part of the involved femur was markedly abnormal. The major findings were: (1) striking failure of the proximal growth plate to migrate proximally, away from the central part of the diaphysis, and failure of formation of a normal growth plate; (2) failure of organization of proliferative and hypertrophic chondrocytes into longitudinal columns; (3) truncation of an immature hypertrophic zone that had abnormal septal architecture; and (4) disorganized vascular invasion with a honeycomb rather than a columnar pattern of primary trabeculae. In contrast, the histological characteristics of the growth plates from the distal part of the femur and from all other long bones were normal.\r"

The prevalence of bleeding problems declined to 15 per cent in patients who were treated more than one week after arthroplasty. In roughly 35 per cent of the patients, therapy with heparin had to be discontinued because of complications. Thrombocytopenia developed in fewer than 5 per cent of the patients.

The fractures occurred in the proximal region of the femur or at the tip of the stem of the prosthesis. Most were incomplete and minimally displaced, and they did not jeopardize the stability of the femoral component. All complete proximal fractures were stabilized with a four-fifths-coated or fully coated prosthesis to provide distal fixation, and, when diagnosed intraoperatively, were fixed with cerclage wiring. When an incomplete fracture near the tip of the stem was discovered postoperatively and the posterior part of the femoral cortex was intact, a spica cast was applied, and the patient was instructed in protected weight-bearing. For a complete fracture at the tip of the stem, we recommend open reduction and internal fixation. No statistical difference was found with respect to residual pain, the score for walking, or the stability of the implant when we compared the results for the patients who had a fracture with those for the patients who did not. Modifications in surgical technique resulted in a decrease in the incidence of fractures (p less than 0.05).\r"

When plain radiographs of the ankle are relied on for the diagnosis of an osteochondral fracture of the talus, many lesions remain undiagnosed. Stage-I osteochondral fractures show no diagnostic changes on plain radiographs, and Stage-II lesions are usually subtle and, therefore, are often overlooked by both radiologists and clinicians. The use of scintigraphy as a screening procedure and of magnetic resonance imaging for patients who have positive scintiscans showed that osteochondral fractures are more common than has previously been indicated in the literature. Scintigraphy should be used to assess patients when there is clinical suspicion of an osteochondral fracture but the plain radiographs appear to be negative. Patients who have positive scintiscans should be assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Patients who have abnormal plain radiographs will derive no major benefits from magnetic resonance imaging; for all but one of these patients, computerized tomography was adequate for staging the fracture.\r"

Sixty-five (86 per cent) of the fractures occurred before the child was nine years old, fifty-eight (76 per cent) were judged to be secondary to the limb being in a cast, and seventy-four (97 per cent) involved the lower extremity. Eleven patients, all of whom had thoracic or upper lumbar involvement, sustained fractures of multiple extremities. All fractures of the lower extremity were distal to the level of neurological involvement; they occurred predominantly in the femur in patients who had thoracic involvement and in the tibia in patients who had lumbar involvement. All of the metaphyseal and diaphyseal fractures healed satisfactorily, whether they were treated by immobilization in a plaster cast or in a bulky Webril dressing, although there were fewer complications in the latter group. The seven fractures that involved the physeal plate were a major problem, as three (43 per cent) had delayed union and two (29 per cent) developed premature growth arrest.\r"

Nearly one-half of the patients had detected a mass before being diagnosed. In addition, nine patients had neurological symptoms and signs when they were first seen. All patients had a surgical biopsy of the lesion, often combined with decompressive laminectomy. Five patients received postoperative radiation therapy in various dosages. No patient received adjunctive chemotherapy. All but five patients died of local progression of the disease. The five-year survival rate was 55 per cent. The median length of survival was six years. Although it is rare, chondrosarcoma of the spine can usually be identified on radiographs. Preoperative assessment must include computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and, possibly, arteriography to assess the precise extent of the disease. Although surgical ablation often is technically difficult, a wide excision should be attempted. If this is not obtainable, postoperative radiation therapy should be considered.\r"

The use of a straight Harrington rod reduced normal thoracic kyphosis, the addition of a compression rod corrected hyperkyphosis, and the use of a rod with sublaminar wires corrected thoracic hypokyphosis or thoracic lordosis.\r"

We found that the pressures easily exceeded 260 millimeters of mercury. Pressures of this magnitude have been shown to cause necrosis of the skin. Orthopaedic surgeons should be aware of this problem when using the brace, and perhaps a wider pad should be used to distribute the force.\r"

Preoperatively, all had complained of pain and tenderness on the ulnar side of the palm or on the dorsal ulnar aspect of the wrist. Most fractures were thought to have occurred while the patient was swinging a racquet, golf club, or baseball bat. Some fractures were caused by striking the palm on a solid object, by falling on the palm, or by a crush injury to the hand. Most of the fractures were diagnosed conclusively on a carpal tunnel roentgenogram or on a special oblique roentgenogram of the wrist supinated. We now believe that computed axial tomography is the best imaging technique for demonstrating this fracture. Except for two patients who had a crush injury, all of the patients returned to their regular occupational and athletic pursuits. There were no surgical complications.\r"

Results were graded on the basis of improvement in the arc of rotation of the forearm. After excision of the area of synostosis in the fifteen patients for whom data were available, the intraoperative arc of passive rotation averaged 121 degrees. At the most recent follow-up, the range of active rotation averaged 55 degrees for all twenty patients. Four patients had an excellent result; three, good; four, fair; and nine, poor. The outcome of this type of surgical treatment varies, but roughly half of the patients can be benefited.\r"

The functional results, according to the rating scale of Merle d'Aubigne, were rated as good or excellent in 75 per cent of the patients and remained almost unchanged with time. Roentgenographic follow-up showed early bone formation around the extramedullary part of the femoral component. The results in this prospective group of patients were compared with those in a similar but retrospective control group of forty-two patients who were treated by internal fixation from 1979 through 1982 and in whom early full weight-bearing was not possible. In the bipolar arthroplasty group, rehabilitation was easier and faster, and the incidences of pressure sores, pulmonary infection, and atelectasis were significantly lower (p less than 0.05). The early walking with full weight-bearing that the bipolar arthroplasty made possible is considered to be a major contributing factor to these results.\r"

The rate of occurrence of this fracture in children, by age and sex, was compared with longitudinal data on the velocity of growth that was collected during the same time for children from the same population. We compared the incidences of the fracture with the results of studies on the levels of activity in children and adolescents during growth. We also compared the age-specific incidence of the fracture in children with the incidence in adults. For both data sets, the age at the peak incidence of fracture of the distal end of the radius almost perfectly matched the age at which peak velocity of growth in height occurs for boys and girls. For girls, the peak incidence occurred between the ages of 11.5 and 12.5 years and for boys, between 13.5 and 14.5 years; these ages corresponded to the mean peak velocity of growth at 11.9 years for girls and 14.3 years for boys. The age-adjusted incidence of the fracture in male subjects was highest at fourteen years and was not exceeded by that in female subjects until fifty-three to fifty-four years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ender nailing is a safe alternative to external fixation for grade-I and grade-II open fractures. It should not be used for comminuted fractures, which might shorten about the nails.\r"

The points of termination of all branches formed an arcuate pattern along the middle one-third of the deep surface of the gluteus medius muscle. The so-called safe area of the gluteus medius muscle was found to be as much as five centimeters adjacent to the greater trochanter. If this distance is not exceeded by the intramuscular incision, the risk to the superior gluteal nerve and its branches will be minimum.\r"

  ".W": "To achieve adequate tissue perfusion during hyperthermic regional perfusion, perfusion pressures should be maintained at near normal mean systemic arterial pressures. During experimental as well as during clinical perfusions however, unphysiologically high perfusion flows were needed to keep the perfusion pressure at the desired level. Since both high perfusion flows and high perfusion pressures have been associated with the post-operative complications such as severe edema and tissue damage, as well as with an increased leakage of perfusate to the systemic circulation, low perfusion flows have been used in regional perfusion. High perfusion flows in our previous experimental studies were attributable to a marked reduction in vascular resistance. This decrease is believed to be caused by the release of vasodilatory constituents of damaged blood cells, and it is the extra-corporeal circuit, and in particular the bubble-oxygenator that is thought to be responsible. The superior haemocompatibility of membrane-oxygenators over bubble-oxygenators has been established in cardio-pulmonary bypass. We compared the use of a membrane-oxygenator with that of a bubble-oxygenator in regional perfusion to see if more normal haemodynamics could be maintained and vasodilatation prevented. In the experimental as well as in the clinical perfusions the use of a bubble-oxygenator required unphysiologically high perfusion flows to maintain the perfusion pressure at the level required to obtain an adequate microcirculation. In contrast the use of a membrane-oxygenator permitted a nearly physiological perfusion flow to maintain an adequate perfusion pressure as well as an adequate micro-circulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, we found no significant differences in any of the biochemical variables between patients belonging to blood group A and \"non-A\". Fifty-seven of the patients had arteriographies done and the arteriograms were evaluated blindly by a radiologist according to occlusive and stenotic atherosclerotic lesions. However, as previously suggested by other investigators, we were not able to demonstrate any significant differences between the number of occlusions and stenotic lesions when dividing the patients into blood group A and \"non-A\". The biochemical differences between patients with either occlusive or stenotic atherosclerotic lesions were also tested and found without any significance. In conclusion: the serum lipoprotein and lipid levels in the present study do not give an obvious explanation, why patients with blood group A seem more liable to develop atherosclerosis than those with blood group \"non-A\".\r"

Five days after transplantation the enzyme activities were higher than in the non-transplanted veins. The rapid increase in enzymatic activity found in histochemical studies on wound healing was not seen in these vein grafts. At four weeks some grafts showed intimal thickening the activity of which did not exceed that of the other layers of the graft wall. At the end of the observation period of sixteen weeks most of the grafts showed intimal thickening, and this layer stained intensely especially for ATPase. The staining pattern of most of the grafts at sixteen weeks resembled that of the aortic media.\r"

  ".W": "Although attempts to restore patency of occluded internal carotid arteries are now rarely made, endarterectomy in the contralateral artery, external carotid endarterectomy and until recently EC/IC bypass have remained surgical options in the management of such patients. Over a four-year period at this institution 104 patients underwent carotid endarterectomy for stenosis. In this group the contralateral carotid was patent (Group A). Fifty-four patients with unilateral carotid artery occlusion underwent contralateral endarterectomy (Group B), 8 underwent ECA/ICA bypass (Group C) and 4 an ECA endarterectomy (Group D). No statistically significant difference was noted in perioperative stroke and death rates for Groups A and B were (1% and 1%) and (3.7% and 1.9%) respectively. One Group C patient died from perioperative stroke (12.5%). For late events the life table adjusted annual rates for stroke and mortality were similar, Group A (stroke 2.1% and death 5%), and Group B (stroke 1.6% and death 5%). In Group C stroke rate was 10% and death 3%. All four patients undergoing ECA endarterectomy were relieved of their symptoms. It is concluded that in patients with internal carotid artery occlusion TEA may be performed with perioperative morbidity and mortality rates comparable to those when the opposite carotid artery is patent. The late outcome for stroke compares favorably with the reported natural history of the disease and outcome for such patients treated medically in the Joint Study of Extracranial Occlusion and EC-IC Bypass Study. External carotid artery endarterectomy appears useful in the treatment of embolic events on the occluded side. ECA/ICA bypass does not appear to confer benefit.\r"

The number of operative deaths/reoperations due to bleeding were: Group I, 2/1; Group IIa, 1/2; Group IIb, 0/0; and Group III, 1/0. There were no late deaths related to the operation or the inserted prosthesis. Of 26 survivors, 21 underwent a follow-up study 1.5-20 years (mean 8.2 years) postoperatively. Except for 6 patients with paralysis of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve none of the patients had sequelae which could be related to the operation or the inserted prosthesis. CT-scanning of the chest revealed neither pseudoaneurysms nor significant stenosis in the suture lines or prosthetic areas. The results indicate that delayed operation of traumatic thoracic aortic ruptures on selected patients may be performed with acceptable results.\r"

Temporary axillo-femoral shunt utilizing a 10 mm woven Dacron tube graft was employed in 10 patients and partial cardiopulmonary bypass in nine. Ischemic SEP changes were seen in five patients. Two patients, whose SCPPs were 32 and 35 mmHg, experienced the complete loss of SEP and developed paraplegia. In the other three cases, increase of MDAP and/or withdrawal of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were performed to increase the SCPP to more than 40 mmHg when ischemic SEP changes occurred. SEP gradually recovered in two cases. The other patient underwent reimplantation of intercostal arteries since the ischemic SEP changes did not revert. These three patients recovered without any neurological deficit. In the other 14 cases without ischemic SEP changes, SCPP was kept at more than 40 mmHg during aortic cross-clamping. We conclude that the maintenance of SCPP at more than 40 mmHg by increasing MDAP and/or withdrawing CSF is an effective procedure in preventing postoperative paraplegia.\r"

In patients operated upon urgently, however, the postoperative mortality was significantly higher (p less than 0.005) in those with a history of myocardial infarction or coronary artery disease. Postoperative morbidity in the emergency group (2.7 complications per patient) was significantly higher than in the elective group (0.94 complications per patient). These results show that early elective operation on asymptomatic aneurysms and younger patients with few risk factors can prevent rupture and reduce postoperative mortality to an acceptable level.\r"

In 5 cases the ACF became apparent after evacuation of the thrombus; only 5 patients presented with features of patent ACF. Four patients in addition presented with extra-caval rupture of the aneurysm. Based on these variables, a classification relating ACF and AAA was developed. In this series all patients were male with a mean aneurysm size of 8.5 cm. All patients required bifurcation grafts for reconstruction. A multifactorial etiology related to enlargement and rupture of all aneurysms seems to apply to ACF. Eight of 10 patients survived. Awareness of this entity and proper preparation allow for successful outcome in the treatment of this condition.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective 5-year follow-up study of 83 femoral-popliteal bypass operations for severe ischemia (79 patients) is presented. There were no operative deaths. At one month, cumulative patency rates (CPR) and limb salvage rates (LSR) were 86.8% and 96.4% respectively. At 5 years, CPR, LSR and cumulative survival were 50%, 79.4% and 71.6% respectively. Post-operative smoking habits were strongly related to CPR and LSR. Smoking more than 5 cigarettes per day adversely affected CPR's. At 5 years, CPR of non-smokers and smokers of up to 5 cigarettes per day (47 patients) was 67.7% and for smokers of more than 5 cigarettes per day (32 patients) it was 44.7% (P less than 0.045). Smoking more than 15 cigarettes per day had an adverse effect on LSR's. Smokers of more than 15 cigarettes per day (17 patients) had a 5-year LSR of 58.5% compared with 89% for non-smokers and smokers of up to 15 cigarettes per day (62 patients) (P = 0.009). For 20 limbs requiring thrombectomy LSR was 100% at 1 year and 57.5% at 5 years. CPR's and LSR's were not significantly influenced by pre-operative smoking, diabetes, run off or level of distal anastomosis relative to the knee joint. Based on zero operative mortality and 96.4% limb salvage at 1 year, it is concluded that an aggressive approach toward revascularization for limb salvage is well justified in most patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The concept of atheromatous embolisation from ulcerated plaques in non-aneurysmal arteries is well recognised but little attention has been paid to lesions in arteries below the inguinal ligament as a source of emboli. Twenty eight of 42 patients (66%) who presented with atheroembolism to the lower limbs had an embolic source in the femoropopliteal segment, with only a third with an identifiable source lesion in the aorta or iliac vessels. A characteristic clinical presentation, combined with a typical appearance on arteriography, usually allows a confident diagnosis to be made, yet many of these patients still have their ischaemic symptoms and signs wrongly attributed to occlusive disease. Successful management depends on early recognition and correction of the source lesion. The treatment of choice is a bypass procedure with appropriate vessel ligation. The majority of ischaemic lesions recover, or the damage is limited to minor digital amputations which will heal primarily. Surgical correction is successful in preventing further embolic episodes.\r"

Ten cm x 8 mm ID ringed PTFE grafts were implanted in the vena-cavae of 29 dogs. Aspirin (325 mg po qd) was administered pre-operatively and continued post-operatively. After preclotting or precoating, all grafts were seeded with porcine endothelial cells. The 32 day patency rates were: 67%, 67% and 37% for WB, FB and CT, respectively (p less than 0.5 CT vs FB, WB). Endothelialized surfaces ranged from 67 +/- 35, 43 +/- 41 to 28 +/- 45% respectively for WB, FB and CT (p less than 0.05 CT vs WB). Preclotting time was shortest for WB technique. We conclude that: 1) FB and WB grafts have the highest patency rate with WB preclotting being a more cost effective and less time consuming technique; 2) endothelial seeding and Aspirin may make vena cava grafting possible.\r"

Thirty-five grafts were implanted to the carotid and/or femoral arteries. The animals were treated with aspirin and/or DN9693, an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase. In the group treated with aspirin (40 mg/kg i.v.), the deposition of platelets on the luminal surface of the implanted polyurethane grafts was suppressed and the luminal surface was covered with adherent leukocytes. Fibrin nets were formed on the adherent leukocytes. In addition, the adhesion of leukocytes on the grafts was considerably suppressed in the group treated with DN9693 (50 micrograms/kg/min i.v.), and the formation of fibrin nets was markedly reduced. In contrast, in the control group the luminal surface was covered with numerous platelets and some leukocytes, which formed thrombi. These findings suggest that leukocytes adhere primarily to the prosthetic graft and play an important role in the initiation of fibrin formation.\r"

  ".W": "Pressure index (brachial/ankle systolic pressure) has been used in vascular surgery for many years and it has been assumed that its value is independent of the systemic pressure. The purpose of this study was to determine whether this assumption is true. Two hundred patients having cardiac catheterisation were studied by measurements of aortic or brachial pressure and ankle systolic pressure using Doppler ultrasound. These measurements were done during catheterisation for cardiac investigation, during operation and in the intensive care unit. None of these patients had peripheral arterial disease. A non-linear relationship was found between the systemic pressure and the systolic ankle pressure. For systemic pressure less than 100 mmHg or greater than 200 mmHg, the ankle pressure was on average 25% lower. For systemic pressure 100 mmHg to 200 mmHg, the ankle pressure was the same or slightly higher. In conclusion, in normal limbs the PI is 1.0-1.2 when the systolic pressure is between 100 and 200 mmHg, but in patients with hypotension or hypertension, it may be less than 1.0. This is an important observation which will prevent vascular surgeons from making erroneous diagnoses of arterial disease in the presence of hypertension or hypotension.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate a new method for limb blood flow measurement using a radioactive isotope and a gamma camera, blood flow measurements have ben made on 108 patients with peripheral vascular disease. Thirty-six patients had ischaemic rest pain, of whom two had previously undergone unilateral amputation. Five had bilateral symptoms, giving 29 asymptomatic limbs and 41 limbs with critical ischaemia. In 72 patients with intermittent claudication a series of exercise tests were attempted, in 33 these were unsatisfactory; 13 patients had a greater than 20% variability in the maximum walking distance between four tests and in 20 walking distance was limited by factors other than claudication. In these 33 patients the limb blood flow to the symptomatic leg was 3.95 (1.36-11.08) ml/100 ml of tissue/minute. This is not significantly different from the limb blood flow to the symptomatic leg of the 39 patients who satisfactorily completed four exercise tests, 3.75 (1.08-8.25) ml/100 ml of tissue/minute. In these 39 patients the mean pain-free walking distance was 40 metres and the mean maximum walking distance was 63 metres. The limb blood flow to the 41 symptomatic limbs of 36 patients with rest pain was 1.90 (0.90-4.49) ml/100 ml of tissue/minute, which is significantly less than that obtained in claudicants. There was a wide range of blood flow values found in the asymptomatic limbs of all the patients and in many cases the flow was markedly reduced from normal. This method of limb blood flow measurement is accurate and reproducible and may be recommended for assessment of peripheral vascular disease.\r"

The first 120 consecutive patients, having received at least one sequential IMA graft were analyzed. The length of the IMA pedicle was the only limitation imposed on its use. Technical artifices enhancing the versatility of the IMA are described. The significant peri-operative myocardial infarction rate was 3.3%. There was no cardiac operative mortality, and 1 late mortality (0.8%). Excellent functional results were illustrated by a 2.5% rate of residual angina and dyspnoea. Six months postoperative angiographic controls could be performed in 70% of the patients: all of the sequential mammary conduits were patent, as were 95% of the anastomoses. By contrast 87.2% of the concomitant venous anastomoses were still functioning. With the expanding utilization of the free graft, IMA is expected to become a true, better and all round substitute for the saphenous vein.\r"
