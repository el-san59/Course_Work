  ".W": "An outbreak of Pontiac fever occurred among 34 of 56 people attending conferences at a hotel in Santa Clara County, California, in 1988. Two groups had an acute febrile upper respiratory illness, with a mean attack rate of 82% and a mean incubation period of 56 hours. Symptoms resolved spontaneously within 5 days. Legionella anisa, which had not previously been associated with outbreaks of Pontiac fever or legionnaires' disease, was isolated from a decorative fountain in the hotel lobby. In addition, 5 of 8 pairs of serum samples from cases showed a more than fourfold rise in antibody titre to the L anisa recovered from the fountain. 42% of hotel employees had titres greater than or equal to 256 against L anisa, whereas none of 48 serum samples from matched controls had titres greater than or equal to 128. The findings raise concern about water treatment protocols for extent of disease that might be caused by exposure to aerosols containing L anisa and other Legionella species.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine the efficacy and morbidity of fine loop diathermy excision of the cervical transformation zone as applied to the management of outpatients with abnormal cervical smears. DESIGN--Prospective programme trial with six month follow up. SETTING--Two hospital based colposcopy clinics. PATIENTS--616 Patients aged 16-60 with abnormal cervical smears. INTERVENTIONS--After colposcopic and cytological assessment excision of the cervical transformation zone by fine loop diathermy under local anaesthesia in the outpatient department. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Time to complete the treatment, immediate morbidity in terms of discomfort and bleeding, and cytological and colposcopic findings at six months. RESULTS--Treatment was completed in a mean of 3.47 minutes (SD 1.99). Immediate morbidity was minimal, and histological specimens were adequate in over 90% of cases. Almost two thirds of patients were treated at their first visit to the clinic. 58 Patients (9.4%) failed to attend for follow up at six months and one had had a hysterectomy. Of the 557 patients who attended for colposcopic and cytological follow up at six months, 506 (91%) were normal cytologically and 19 (3.4%) had histologically confirmed persistence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. The overall confirmed failure rate of the technique was 4.4%. CONCLUSION--Loop diathermy excision is an effective treatment with low morbidity and is an appropriate modality for patients with abnormal cervical smears.\r"

  ".U": "90362979\r", 
  ".W": "Freshly explanted tumour cells from 22 patients with mid-gut carcinoid were used for in-vitro analysis of the capacity of recombinant interferon (rIFN) to induce the enzyme 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (2',5'-A synthetase). 21 samples (95%) could be evaluated. IFN achieved a clinical response, by predetermined criteria, in 9 of the 21 patients (43%). There was a significant association between induction of 2',5'-A synthetase and clinical response: if the in-vitro intracellular concentrations of the enzyme increased by less than a factor of 3, remission did not occur (9 of 9; 100%), whereas remission was observed in 9 of 12 patients (75%) in whom in-vitro intracellular 2',5'-A synthetase concentrations at least trebled. Anti-IFN antibodies developed in 6 of 12 patients treated with rIFN-alpha 2a but in 0 of 10 who received rIFN-alpha 2b. This in-vitro test may help to identify patients with carcinoid tumours who are unlikely to benefit from IFN therapy, so that other forms of treatment can be started early and the side-effects of IFN are not suffered unnecessarily. Adaptations of this test may be possible for other tumours that may respond to treatment by IFN or similar compounds.\r"

It attracted much public interest and a high demand for its services--and profound medical scepticism. In a study beginning in 1986 of 334 women with breast cancer attending the centre for the first time between June, 1986, and October, 1987, information about the diagnosis was obtained from case notes. Controls were a sample of 461 women with breast cancer attending a specialist cancer hospital or two district general hospitals. The same information was obtained for the control group as for the BCHC group. All patients have been followed up to June, 1988. 85% of patients with breast cancer attending the BCHC were aged under 55 at diagnosis. More than half had experienced recurrence of their disease before entry. For patients metastasis-free at entry, metastasis-free survival in the BCHC group was significantly poorer than in the controls (relapse rate ratio 2.85). Survival in relapsed cases was significantly inferior to that in the control group (hazard ratio 1.81). For cases metastasis-free at entry to the BCHC there was a significant difference in survival between cases and controls, confirming the difference in metastasis-free survival. There was no significant difference in survival or disease-free survival between the cancer hospital controls and other controls.\r"

From June 1985 to December 1987, 5,049,883 donations at 48 donor centers were evaluable for analysis. The results of this survey suggest that ballot and barcode methods of CUE are important adjuncts to other donor screening procedures in identifying potentially infectious units, and that both of these methods are superior to the call-back system of unit exclusion.\r"

  ".W": "The resistance of malignant tumors to chemotherapy is often associated with overexpression of the multidrug resistance gene MDR. Its gene product, P-glycoprotein, acts as a drug efflux pump for chemotherapeutic agents. The authors studied MDR expression in 28 adenocarcinomas arising in Barrett's esophagus (EAs) using a monoclonal antibody directed against this gene product. The results were compared with MDR expression in 27 gastric adenocarcinomas (GAs). P-glycoprotein was detected in both tumor and normal mucosa in 7 of 27 GAs and in 6 of 10 EAs that were resected without prior chemotherapy. Chemotherapy was given before surgical resection in 18 of the EAs studied. Five patients had a partial response to chemotherapy, and one had a complete eradication of his carcinoma; all of these tumors were negative for P-glycoprotein. Of 12 patients without chemotherapy response, 6 had tumors that expressed P-glycoprotein. The authors conclude that P-glycoprotein is present in EAs and GAs before exposure to chemotherapy. The presence of P-glycoprotein in tumors usually correlates with its presence in the adjacent mucosa. Its presence in tumor cells may be an indicator of lack of sensitivity to chemotherapy.\r"

Experimental autoimmune hepatitis could be induced most effectively in male C57BL/6 mice by intraperitoneal immunization with the 100,000 g supernatant of syngeneic liver homogenate (S-100) in complete Freund's adjuvant. BALB/C and C3H mice were less susceptible than C57BL/6 mice. Experimental autoimmune hepatitis could not be induced in Lewis rats. Intraperitoneal immunization was more effective than intramuscular or subcutaneous injections, and the amount of protein administered above a threshold was of little influence. A single intraperitoneal injection of S-100 in complete Freund's adjuvant resulted in hepatitis of at least 6 mo duration. Histological changes were most marked 4 wk after disease induction. The histological findings were characterized mainly by perivascular inflammatory infiltrates and hepatocyte necroses. The histological changes were accompanied by biochemical evidence of liver cell death. Passive transfer of experimental autoimmune hepatitis with concanavalin A-activated splenocytes was possible. Specific T-cell reactivity against fractions of S-100 could be demonstrated in vitro. Thus experimental autoimmune hepatitis is a murine model of autoimmune hepatitis probably mediated by autoreactive T cells. It will allow studies of the pathogenesis of autoimmune hepatitis.\r"

A population-based sample of 5300 blacks and whites from east Baltimore, Md, received an ophthalmologic screening examination that included detailed visual acuity measurements. Blacks had, on average, a twofold excess prevalence of blindness and visual impairment than whites, irrespective of definition. Rates rose dramatically with age for all definitions of vision loss, but there was no difference in prevalence by sex. More than 50% of subjects improved their presenting vision after refractive correction, with 7.5% improving three or more lines. Rates in Baltimore are as high or higher than those reported from previous studies. National projections indicate that greater than 3 million persons are visually impaired, 890,000 of whom are bilaterally blind by US definitions.\r"

  ".W": "Using data from the 1986 Adult Use of Tobacco Survey, we analyzed smoking-cessation methods used by adult smokers in the United States who tried to quit. About 90% of successful quitters and 80% of unsuccessful quitters used individual methods of smoking cessation rather than organized programs. Most of these smokers who quit on their own used a \"cold turkey\" approach. Multivariate analysis showed that women, middle-aged persons, more educated persons, persons who had made more quit-smoking attempts, and, particularly, heavier smokers were most likely to use a cessation program. Daily cigarette consumption, however, did not predict whether persons would succeed or fail during their attempts to quit smoking. Rather, the cessation method used was the strongest predictor of success. Among smokers who had attempted cessation within the previous 10 years, 47.5% of persons who tried to quit on their own were successful whereas only 23.6% of persons who used cessation programs succeeded. We conclude that cessation programs serve a small, but important, population of smokers that includes heavier smokers, those most at risk for tobacco-related morbidity and mortality.\r"

Authors of previous reports that included fluorescein angiography during pregnancy provided information about an additional 11 patients. Substantiated side effects were nausea or vomiting in seven patients. Anomalies at birth, an undescended testicle and syndactyly, were reported in two children. There was one stillbirth with pathologic findings classic for toxemia, and one fetal death occurred several months after fluorescein angiography. One therapeutic abortion was performed for complications in toxemia. One spontaneous abortion occurred three days after fluorescein angiography in a patient who was four weeks pregnant. Eight children born to toxemic mothers had low birth weights. We conclude that fluorescein angiography does not cause a high rate of birth anomalies or complications during pregnancy.\r"

CNEs are responsible for obtaining, allocating, and managing nursing department resources; knowledge of nursing turnover costs will allow them to make more informed decisions about how best to allocate scarce resources. The findings of this study are also important to hospital administrators because they demonstrate the financial impact of high rates of nursing turnover on healthcare delivery. Finally, these findings provide nurse researchers direction for future research into the costs and benefits of nursing turnover and retention activities, so that cost-effective methods of minimizing organizational costs can be determined.\r"

In the first 19 months with the protocol, organs (1 heart, 2 sets of heart valves, 2 livers, and 16 kidneys) were retrieved from 8 patients who would not otherwise have become donors.

  ".W": "The long QT syndrome is electrocardiographically characterized by a prolonged QT interval and by several other, more subtle, ST-T-U wave abnormalities, most of which have not been quantified. To determine the possible usefulness of several new electrocardiographic characteristics in identifying patients with known long QT syndrome, logistic regression models were applied to a data base of seven new, relatively independent, electrocardiographic repolarization variables. These were measured on digitized 12-lead electrocardiograms of 315 normal subjects and 37 patients with the long QT syndrome (members of well-identified long QT syndrome families, QTc greater than 0.44 second, 27% symptomatic), who ranged in age from 17 to 60 years. Electrocardiographic variables that independently differentiated (p less than 0.001) patients with long QT syndrome from normal subjects included quantitative measures of repolarization: early duration, rate, T wave symmetry, late phenomena, and heterogeneity. All selected repolarization variables except the early duration variable were essentially independent of the QTc (r2 less than 0.15), and all contributed significantly to the identification of patients with long QT syndrome. A classification model of five electrocardiographic predictor variables resulted in an estimated sensitivity (95% confidence interval) of 92.6% (81.6-100%) and an estimated specificity (95% confidence interval) of 95.8% (93.6-98.1%). This model performed significantly better than an alternative classification model that was based on the early duration variable as a single predictor variable. The symptomatic status of patients with long QT syndrome could not be predicted by any combination of the electrocardiographic variables in the investigated model.\r"

This complication appeared in 1 of 180 children with brain tumours and in none of the 1878 with other malignancies. Risk of therapy-related myeloid neoplasia in patients with Hodgkin's disease was associated with recurrence of the primary malignancy, a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy with alkylating agents, and age greater than or equal to 12 years at diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease. Of the 8 patients who underwent chromosomal analysis of neoplastic myeloid cells, 2 showed complete loss of chromosome 7 and 4 showed t(9;11) or t(8;21) with or without del(16)(q22). The 2 patients who had received an epipodophyllotoxin had an 11q23 abnormality. The risk of therapy-related myeloid neoplasia is low in children with malignant solid tumours.\r"

Significant reduction in left ventricular mass index was observed after 9 months of treatment. Only 13 patients had a reduction in mass greater than the intraobserver variability of the technique. There was no change in doppler indices of left ventricular diastolic function. In 7 patients who were studied for a further 9 months after regression had occurred there was still no appreciable difference in left ventricular diastolic function.

Follow-up was up to two years. Therapeutic effect was documented by clinical assessment of tone, spasms and reflexes and by electrophysiological recordings of mono- and polysynaptic reflex activity. Complications and untoward side-effects of the procedure were few. This procedure is recommended for spasticity of spinal origin refractory to physiotherapy and oral medication. It is a preferable alternative to ablative surgical intervention.\r"

For all but 1 seronegative RA patient, a seropositive RA case control was identified and matched for age, disease duration, degree of destruction on hand radiographs, and disease-modifying drug therapy. DR typing was undertaken on these 105 patients, together with scoring of hand radiographs. The frequency of DR4 was 69% in seropositive RA patients and 60% in seronegative RA patients (P = 0.22), versus 36% in 318 healthy controls (P = 0.008 and P = 0.007 versus seropositive and seronegative RA, respectively). Patients were matched and rematched with different controls in a series of subanalyses in order to make comparisons of hand radiograph scores. We found that HLA-DR4 was associated with destructive RA in both seropositive and seronegative RA patients. In general, DR4+ patients had more severe disease by radiologic criteria than did DR4- patients. Thus, HLA-DR4 may be an additive factor to the serologic status and may be more closely related to disease severity than to disease susceptibility.\r"

Ten patients were included in each group and anesthetic techniques, patient management, and septal temperatures were similar in all cases. No significant difference was found between the preoperative and immediate or 6-week postoperative ejection fractions, either taken overall or between the two groups (p greater than 0.05; Student's t test). No correlation was found between cross-clamp time, bypass time, or the occurrence of ventricular fibrillation and the immediate postoperative ejection fraction (p greater than 0.05; Student's t test). There was no significant difference in the incidence of ventricular fibrillation after each type of vent had been used (chi 1(0) = 3.32; p greater than 0.05). We did not demonstrate any abnormalities in regional wall motion associated with apical insertion of a left ventricular vent, and conclude that pulmonary artery and left ventricular vents are equally satisfactory in terms of postoperative ventricular performance.\r"

The high-risk group identified by this cutoff score was 11 times more likely to commit suicide than the rest of the outpatients.

One-third of the patients experienced unilateral lower extremity numbness following the pudendal block. Symptoms had completely subsided approximately 20 minutes after the procedure, and there were no sequelae. The average length of time of the procedure was 25 minutes. All patients were discharged from the ED within 30 minutes of completion of the procedure. In all patients examined one week postoperatively, the residual pouch had shrunk to less than half its original size and the apertures were patent. There have been no problems with bleeding, infection, pain or dyspareunia. In a follow-up survey, no recurrent cysts were reported. This problem can be treated safely in the ED with good results.\r"

We had previously identified, in Ashkenazi-Jewish adult GM2 gangliosidosis patients, a Gly269----Ser mutation in the beta-hexosaminidase alpha-subunit. All of the Ashkenazi patients were found to be compound heterozygotes with an allele containing the Gly269----Ser mutation together with one of the Ashkenazi infantile Tay-Sachs alleles. We have now found the same Gly269----Ser mutation in six adult GM2 gangliosidosis patients from four different non-Jewish families. Genomic DNA from three of the patients, two of whom were brothers, exhibited a hybridization pattern consistent with homozygosity for the Gly269----Ser mutation. The remaining non-Jewish patients were compound heterozygotes of the Gly269----Ser mutation together with an unidentified alpha-subunit mutation. The results demonstrate that individuals homozygous for the Gly269----Ser change can be clinically affected. The same Gly269----Ser mutation in both the Ashkenazi and non-Jewish patients may be the result of a common ancestor, given that the ancestry of these non-Jewish patients, like the Ashkenazim, can be traced to eastern Europe.\r"

  ".W": "Two patients who suffered a head trauma experienced sudden clinical deterioration more than 1 week after their injury. The initial computerized tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a small hematoma underlying a depressed skull fracture in one patient and a small interhemispheric subdural hematoma in the other. Both patients had made a complete recovery and follow-up CT scans were normal when clinical deterioration suddenly occurred. Both patients developed a large intracerebral hematoma and underwent emergency evacuation of the mass. The first patient recovered with the exception of a moderate hemiparesis and dysphasia, but the second patient died. Delayed traumatic intracerebral hematomas have been described in the literature. Since the advent of CT scanning, the incidence of this phenomenon has been estimated as between 1.7% and 7.4% of closed head injuries. In 1891, Otto Bollinger described four patients who suffered head injury, followed days to weeks later by death from an apoplectic event. His criteria for diagnosis of \"traumatische Spat-Apoplexie\" included the absence of preexisting vascular disease, a definite history of trauma, an asymptomatic interval of at least several days, and an apoplectic episode. These two cases reemphasize the existence of Spat-Apoplexie as a rare clinical condition. In the presence of CT findings of even small traumatic intracerebral or extracerebral hematomas, the possibility of this late complication should be kept in mind.\r"

Thirty-six (97%) of 37 unvaccinated patients had rash illnesses that met the Centers for Disease Control clinical case definition of measles, but 29 (15%) of 198 vaccinated patients did not, primarily because of low-grade or absent fever. Of 122 patients with seroconfirmed measles, 10 patients (all previously vaccinated) had no detectable measles-specific IgM and significantly milder illness than either vaccinated or unvaccinated patients with IgM-positive serum. Of 108 vaccinated patients with seroconfirmed measles, 17 patients (16%) had IgM-negative serology or rash illnesses that failed to meet the clinical case definition; their mean age (13 years), age at the time of vaccination, and time since vaccination did not differ from those of other vaccinated patients. The occurrence of secondary vaccine failure and vaccine-modified measles does not appear to be a major impediment to measles control in the United States but may lead to underreporting of measles cases and result in overestimation of vaccine efficacy in highly vaccinated populations.\r"

Methylprednisolone was given to 162 patients as a bolus of 30 mg per kilogram of body weight, followed by infusion at 5.4 mg per kilogram per hour for 23 hours. Naloxone was given to 154 patients as a bolus of 5.4 mg per kilogram, followed by infusion at 4.0 mg per kilogram per hour for 23 hours. Placebos were given to 171 patients by bolus and infusion.

After six months the patients who were treated with methylprednisolone within eight hours of their injury had significant improvement as compared with those given placebo in motor function (neurologic change scores of 16.0 and 11.2, respectively; P = 0.03) and sensation to pinprick (change scores of 11.4 and 6.6; P = 0.02) and touch (change scores, 8.9 and 4.3; P = 0.03). Benefit from methylprednisolone was seen in patients whose injuries were initially evaluated as neurologically complete, as well as in those believed to have incomplete lesions. The patients treated with naloxone, or with methylprednisolone more than eight hours after their injury, did not differ in their neurologic outcomes from those given placebo. Mortality and major morbidity were similar in all three groups. We conclude that in patients with acute spinal-cord injury, treatment with methylprednisolone in the dose used in this study improves neurologic recovery when the medication is given in the first eight hours. We also conclude that treatment with naloxone in the dose used in this study does not improve neurologic recovery after acute spinal-cord injury.\r"

  ".W": "Irritant contact dermatitis is common in metalworkers exposed to metalworking fluids (MWF). The irritancy of 3 commercially available water-based cutting fluids in maximal user's concentration and 2 neat oils was investigated in 23 healthy volunteers. Additionally, the irritancy of some groups of components of the cutting fluids was studied. After Sellotape stripping, repeated patch tests were performed over 5 days and evaluated by a visual score (VS) and by laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF). In general, the MWF caused marginal skin irritation. In a comparison of the MWF and water, the cutting fluids were ranked higher in irritancy than the neat oils, but the effect of only one cutting fluid could be distinguished from that of water. The components of the cutting fluids also caused no strong reactions. The LDF response showed that one emulsifier was more irritant than water and according to the VS, one corrosion inhibitor was the most irritant. The correlation coefficient between the VS and the LDF response was probably diminished by a strong adverse reaction to the fixing tape in many volunteers. From this experiment, it was concluded that MWF are generally only mildly irritant when used in proper concentrations. However, orthoergic contact dermatitis often develops as a result of repeated and cumulative subclinical insults, in which MWF, especially water-based, play a crucial role because exposure at work is often extensive.\r"

Fifty-one patients had seizures. Seizure episodes were investigated to determine whether they were temporally associated with shunt dysfunction. Episodes of actual or presumed shunt dysfunction were analyzed as to presenting symptoms, ventriculogram, computed tomography scan, and shunt film results. These 51 patients had 129 admissions for possible shunt dysfunction. One hundred one admissions were due to increased intraventricular pressure; nine (9%) of these, had a seizure as one of the presenting symptoms. All of the nine episodes had other common presenting symptoms of shunt dysfunction, such as headache, vomiting, lethargy, or respiratory compromise. We conclude that seizures alone are an inadequate predictor of shunt dysfunction in children with meningomyelocele, but can be seen as one of the presenting symptoms.\r"

The larger number of cases available (220) compared with those of previous US population-based studies enabled us to evaluate change in incidence over time and to more precisely estimate incidence according to various demographic characteristics. The incidence of retinoblastoma has been almost uniform form 1974 to 1985. The average annual incidence of retinoblastoma was 5.8 per million for children younger than 10 years and 10.9 per million for children younger than 5 years. There was no difference in the incidence of retinoblastoma by either sex or race. The overall 5-year cumulative survival rate was 91% (95% confidence interval, 87% to 95%). The data indicate a worsening survival with increasing age at diagnosis, through age 2 years, but a less clear relationship of survival with diagnosis beyond age 2 years.\r"

  ".W": "Studies of radiation therapy and/or surgery in the treatment of cancer frequently use actuarial methods to estimate curves of time to local failure and compare two such curves with statistical methods originally developed for survival data. In such analyses, patients who fail first in distant sites or die before local failure are considered censored for time to local failure. While the arithmetic of these calculations is usually correct, the interpretation of the results is almost universally incorrect. For example, an actuarial Kaplan-Meier curve of time to breast recurrence after breast conserving treatment consistently overestimates the percentage of patients who would benefit from a subsequent mastectomy. Actuarial methods require the assumption that time to local failure and time to distant failure are statistically independent. For most human malignancies this is not a reasonable assumption, since there are always some patient subgroups at high risk of both local and distant failure and some patient subgroups at low risk for either type of failure. Without the assumption of independence, the time to local failure distribution is not well defined. The basic problem is that estimating time to local failure falls into the category of analyzing \"competing risks,\" since the various causes of failure are competing for the same patient. For this reason, the effects of a particular treatment on local failure cannot be assessed separately from its effects on distant failure. This report explains the concepts of statistical independence, nonidentifiability, and competing risks and illustrates the pitfalls of using actuarial methods to assess local tumor control.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The efficacy and safety of magnesium sulfate in the treatment of preeclampsia-eclampsia have been well documented during the past 60 years. During the same time period, numerous anticonvulsant drugs have been used overseas; however, the ideal drug is yet to be found. Recently phenytoin has been recommended as an alternative for magnesium sulfate; however, comprehensive data regarding its safety and efficacy are lacking. The evidence in the literature indicates that magnesium sulfate is the ideal anticonvulsant in preeclampsia-eclampsia.\r"

Two recently treated patients are reported, and the English-language literature on this disease is reviewed from 1960 to the present. Despite the development of computed tomographic scanning to aid in the early diagnosis of mediastinitis, the mortality for descending necrotizing mediastinitis has not changed over the past 30 years, in large part because of continued dependence on transcervical mediastinal drainage. Although transcervical drainage is usually effective in the treatment of acute mediastinitis due to a cervical esophageal perforation, this approach in the patient with descending necrotizing mediastinitis fails to provide adequate drainage and predisposes to sepsis and a poor outcome. In addition to cervical drainage, aggressive, early mediastinal exploration--debridement and drainage through a subxiphoid incision or thoracotomy--is advocated to salvage the patient with descending necrotizing mediastinitis.\r"

  ".W": "A decline in mortality from cardiovascular disease over the past 30 years has been well documented, but the reasons for the decline remain unclear. We analyzed the 10-year incidence of cardiovascular disease and death from cardiovascular disease in three groups of men who were 50 to 59 years old at base line in 1950, 1960, and 1970 (the 1950, 1960, and 1970 cohorts) in order to determine the contribution of secular trends in the incidence of cardiovascular disease, risk factors, and medical care to the decline in mortality. The 10-year cumulative mortality from cardiovascular disease in the 1970 cohort was 43 percent less than that in the 1950 cohort and 37 percent less than that in the 1960 cohort (P = 0.04 by log-rank test). Among the men who were free of cardiovascular disease at base line, the 10-year cumulative incidence of cardiovascular disease declined approximately 19 percent, from 190 per 1000 in the 1950 cohort to 154 per 1000 in the 1970 cohort (0.10 less than P less than 0.20 by chi-square test), whereas the 10-year rate of death from cardiovascular disease declined 60 percent (relative risk for the 1950 cohort as compared with the 1970 cohort, 2.53; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.22 to 5.97). Significant improvements were found in risk factors for cardiovascular disease among the men initially free of cardiovascular disease in the 1970 cohort as compared with those in the 1950 cohort, including a lower serum cholesterol level (mean +/- SD, 5.72 +/- 0.98 mmol per liter [221 +/- 38 mg per deciliter], as compared with 5.90 +/- 1.03 mmol per liter [228 +/- 40 mg per deciliter]) and a lower systolic blood pressure (mean +/- SD, 135 +/- 19 mm Hg, as compared with 139 +/- 25 mm Hg), better management of hypertension (22 percent vs. 0 percent were receiving antihypertensive medication), and reduced cigarette smoking (34 percent vs. 56 percent). We propose that these improvements may have had more pronounced effects on mortality from cardiovascular disease than on the incidence of cardiovascular disease in this population. Our data suggest that the improvement in cardiovascular risk factors in the 1970 cohort may have been an important contributor to the 60 percent decline in mortality in that group as compared with the 1950 cohort, although a decline in the incidence of cardiovascular disease and improved medical interventions may also have contributed to the decline in mortality.\r"

Toxic pollution of air and water, acid rain, destruction of stratospheric ozone, waste, species extinction and, potentially, global warming are produced by the growing numbers and activities of human beings. Progression of these environmental changes could lead to unprecedented human suffering. Physicians can treat persons experiencing the consequences of environmental change but cannot individually prevent the cause of their suffering. Physicians have information and expertise about environmental change that can contribute to its slowing or prevention. Work to prevent global environmental change is consistent with the social responsibility of physicians and other health professionals.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine the effects of lowering cholesterol concentrations on total and cause specific mortality in randomised primary prevention trials. DESIGN--Qualitative (meta-analytic) evaluation of total mortality from coronary heart disease, cancer, and causes not related to illness in six primary prevention trials of cholesterol reduction (mean duration of treatment 4.8 years). PATIENTS--24,847 Male participants; mean age 47.5 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Total and cause specific mortalities. RESULTS--Follow up periods totalled 119,000 person years, during which 1147 deaths occurred. Mortality from coronary heart disease tended to be lower in men receiving interventions to reduce cholesterol concentrations compared with mortality in control subjects (p = 0.06), although total mortality was not affected by treatment. No consistent relation was found between reduction of cholesterol concentrations and mortality from cancer, but there was a significant increase in deaths not related to illness (deaths from accidents, suicide, or violence) in groups receiving treatment to lower cholesterol concentrations relative to controls (p = 0.004). When drug trials were analysed separately the treatment was found to reduce mortality from coronary heart disease significantly (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS--The association between reduction of cholesterol concentrations and deaths not related to illness warrants further investigation. Additionally, the failure of cholesterol lowering to affect overall survival justifies a more cautious appraisal of the probable benefits of reducing cholesterol concentrations in the general population.\r"

  ".W": "Between June, 1984, and May, 1988, 130 patients from three renal units in the United Arab Emirates and Oman went of their own accord to Bombay, where they bought, through brokers, kidneys from living unrelated Indian donors for US$2600-3300. 131 transplants were done, and the 122 patients who survived the perioperative period returned to their original renal units for follow-up. Altogether there were 25 deaths (16 before the end of 3 months, 4 in the next 3 months, and 4 more by the end of the first year), which gave a patient survival rate of 81.5% at 1 year. The patients who died had multiple complications, but infection was the commonest known cause of death. Patients were not properly instructed about their treatment, and little or no information was given to doctors following up the patients, criteria of suitability for transplantation were not strict, and patients were exposed to serious infections (including human immunodeficiency virus infection). In addition, the availability of living-donor programmes slows down attempts to establish cadaver-donor transplant programmes.\r"

A clinical diagnosis was secured in 92 of the 118 remaining patients. Patients were separated into three groups based upon the anatomic location of root involvement: extradural (55), intradural-extraaxial (23), and intraaxial (14). Collectively, patients with intradural-extraaxial disorders had earlier disease onset, shorter symptom duration, and a higher disability score compared with the intraaxial or extradural groups. Pain was an initial complaint in 50 of 55 patients with extradural lesions, 20 of 23 with intradural-extraaxial disease, but only in 4 of 14 with intraaxial involvement. CSF abnormalities and reduced compound muscle action potential amplitudes were more common in the intradural-extraaxial group. We conclude that the anatomic localization of root involvement in patients with polyradiculopathy can be suggested by a combination of clinical, laboratory, and electrodiagnostic features.\r"

Although it is known that antinuclear antibody can be detected in the serum of patients with a wide variety of diseases, it has been proposed that the detection of antinuclear antibody in serosal fluid is a sensitive and specific test for determining that effusions are due to systemic lupus erythematosus. A case is presented in which antinuclear antibody in high titer was identified in the pericardial fluid of a patient who was found at autopsy to have a primary cardiac lymphoma. The case indicates that antinuclear antibody detected in serosal effusions should not be considered pathognomonic for systemic lupus erythematosus.\r"

After baseline assessment over 1 week, 18 patients with mild asthma practised slow deep breathing for 15 min twice a day for two consecutive 2-week periods. During the active period, subjects were asked to breathe through a Pink City lung (PCL) exerciser--a device which imposes slowing of breathing and a 1:2 inspiration:expiration duration ratio equivalent to pranayama breathing methods; during the control period, subjects breathed through a matched placebo device. Mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), peak expiratory flow rate, symptom score, and inhaler use over the last 3 days of each treatment period were assessed in comparison with the baseline assessment period; all improved more with the PCL exerciser than with the placebo device, but the differences were not significant. There was a statistically significant increase in the dose of histamine needed to provoke a 20% reduction in FEV1 (PD20) during pranayama breathing but not with the placebo device. The usefulness of controlled ventilation exercises in the control of asthma should be further investigated.\r"

Fetuses with chromosomal (n = 4) or structural (n = 8) abnormalities were excluded from subsequent analysis. Gestational age at blood sampling (27.8 [95% CI 26.5-29.1] vs 32.2 [30.4-34.1] weeks) and time from sampling to delivery (median 2 (range 0-35] vs 14 [0-77] days) were significantly lower in group 1 than group 2. There were no perinatal deaths in group 2 whereas mortality in group 1 was 65.4%. There were significant differences between the groups at blood sampling in pH, pO2, pCO2, base equivalents, and nucleated-red-cell count, but within group 1 these measurements were similar in surviving fetuses and those who died perinatally. Since acid-base determination does not predict perinatal outcome in growth-retarded fetuses, fetal blood sampling has a limited role in monitoring fetal wellbeing.\r"

In addition, 34% of these women became pregnant within 6 months of completing the program. These findings established a role for stress reduction in the long-term treatment of infertility.

  ".U": "90245040\r", 
  ".W": "Familial hypercholesterolemia carries a marked increase in the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), but there is considerable variation between individuals in susceptibility to CHD. To investigate the possible role of lipoprotein(a) as a risk factor for CHD, we studied the association between serum lipoprotein(a) levels, genetic types of apolipoprotein(a) (which influence lipoprotein(a) levels), and CHD in 115 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. The median lipoprotein(a) level in the 54 patients with CHD was 57 mg per deciliter, which is significantly higher than the corresponding value of 18 mg per deciliter in the 61 patients without CHD. According to discriminant-function analysis, the lipoprotein(a) level was the best discriminator between the two groups (as compared with all other lipid and lipoprotein levels, age, sex, and smoking status). Phenotyping for apolipoprotein(a) was performed in 109 patients. The frequencies of the apolipoprotein(a) phenotypes and alleles differed significantly between the patients with and those without CHD. The allele LpS2, which is associated with high lipoprotein(a) levels, was found more frequently among the patients with CHD (0.33 vs. 0.12). In contrast, the LpS4 allele, which is associated with low lipoprotein(a) levels, was more frequent among those without CHD (0.27 vs. 0.15). We conclude that an elevated level of lipoprotein(a) is a strong risk factor for CHD in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, and the increase in risk is independent of age, sex, smoking status, and serum levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The higher level of lipoprotein(a) observed in the patients with CHD is the result of genetic influence.\r"

Anaemia (defined as a haemoglobin concentration of less than 110 g/l) was diagnosed in 33 children (22%) and was more common among children who were not white. Continued feeding with breast milk and the early introduction of whole cows' milk were associated with a significantly higher prevalence of anaemia. No child taking formula milk was anaemic. Asian children drank significantly more milk a day than other groups, but there was no correlation between daily milk intake and haemoglobin concentration.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. A small percentage of patients infected with Borrelia burgdorferi have chronic Lyme arthritis that does not respond to antibiotic therapy. To learn whether genetically determined variations in the host immune response might account for such outcomes, we determined the immunogenetic profiles of 130 patients with various manifestations of Lyme disease. RESULTS. Of the 80 patients with arthritis, 57 percent of those with chronic arthritis (12 to 48 months in duration) had the HLA-DR4 specificity; only 23 percent of those with arthritis of moderate duration (6 to 11 months) and only 9 percent of those with arthritis of short duration (1 to 5 months) had this specificity (P = 0.003). After the HLA-DR4-positive patients were excluded from each group, a secondary association was noted with HLA-DR2, which was found in 75 percent of the remaining patients with chronic arthritis and in 50 percent of those with arthritis of moderate duration, but in only 20 percent of those with arthritis of short duration (P = 0.023). Altogether, 25 of the 28 patients with chronic arthritis (89 percent) had HLA-DR2 or HLA-DR4, or both, as compared with 27 percent of those with arthritis of short duration (relative risk, 22; P = 0.00006). These HLA specificities appeared to act as independent, dominant markers of susceptibility. Nucleotide-sequence typing, performed in five patients with chronic arthritis, identified the HLA-DR2 allele as Dw2 (DR beta 1*1501), and the HLA-DR4 alleles as Dw4, Dw14, and Dw13 (DR beta 1*0401, DR beta 1*0404, and DR beta 1*0403, respectively). The presence of HLA-DR4 in patients with arthritis was associated with a lack of response to antibiotic therapy (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS. Particular Class II major histocompatibility genes determine a host immune response to B. burgdorferi that results in chronic arthritis and lack of response to antibiotic therapy.\r"

Second, research into the syndromal nature, biology, and treatment of PMS is still in its infancy due to a variety of methodological difficulties. Third, the rate of depression among women during the involutional period or following hysterectomy for benign pathology is not higher than it is at other times.\r"

The safety of these commonly used surgical clips when subjected to high-intensity diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging fields is still debated. Commonly used hemostatic metallic clips manufactured by the Weck and US Surgical Corporations were tested in an in vitro system to assess their safety with regard to migration and displacement. The two tested hemostatic metallic clips proved safe and did not migrate or become dislodged when they underwent magnetic resonance imaging scans. This is in direct contrast to multiple cerebral aneurysm clips, also tested, which have highly ferromagnetic properties and were previously shown to migrate with disastrous results in patients undergoing diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging scans. This study supports the continued widespread use of small metallic hemostatic clips in the myriad of procedures in which they are presently used and illustrates the need for methods of evaluating such devices before they are clinically implanted.\r"

The purpose of this article is to familiarize the anaesthetist with basic tooth anatomy and pathology and to provide an update on the different types of dental treatment and appliances which one may encounter in anaesthetic practice. Traumatic fractures to teeth are classified into six categories; Class I - fracture into the enamel layer, Class II - fracture into the dentinal layer, Class III - fracture into the pulp of a tooth, Class IV - fracture of the root of a tooth, Class V - subluxation of a tooth, and Class VI - avulsion of a tooth. Treatment for each class of fracture is described as well as certain preventative ideas. Some of the more recent developments in dental therapy such as the butterfly bridge, titanium implants and porcelain laminate veneers are described. Such developments in their turn have led to new and different problems. Care must be taken when using the laryngoscope as these teeth may be more easily fractured or dislodged. Several investigations into malpractice claims found that the oral airway was responsible for up to 55 per cent of dental complications. Prevention of dental trauma begins with an understanding of basic tooth anatomy and pathology and a recognition of the different dental treatments and appliances at the preoperative visit. The value of an appropriate preoperative dental consultation must not be underestimated.\r"

  ".W": "Retrospective studies have reported that tracheal enlargement is common in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). To determine whether significant tracheal enlargement occurs in these patients, we used the acoustic reflection technique to prospectively measure the tracheal cross-sectional area near functional residual capacity (FRC) in 39 stable outpatients with CF and 39 age- and sex-matched normal control subjects. The patients with CF had a mean age of 19.0 yr with a mean percent predicted FEV1 of 69%. The mean +/- SEM tracheal area of the patients with CF was 1.99 +/- 0.13 cm2, compared with a mean tracheal area of 1.87 +/- 0.10 cm2 in the control subjects (t = 0.79, NS). CF tracheal area was not a function of age nor of disease severity, as assessed by percent predicted FEV1. To determine whether tracheomegaly might occur only in older patients, we examined the six patients with CF who were 28 yr of age or older. Mean tracheal area for these older patients with CF was 2.46 +/- 0.26 cm2, compared with 2.27 +/- 0.10 cm2 for the control subjects (t = 0.70, NS). Eleven patients with CF also had their tracheal area measured near TLC. At this high lung volume, the tracheal area of the patients with CF was 2.62 +/- 0.23 cm2, significantly larger than the 1.91 +/- 0.13 cm2 in 11 control subjects (t = 2.68, p less than 0.02). The increase in tracheal area per change in lung volume was also significantly greater in the patients with CF than in the control subjects (t = 3.33, p less than 0.01). We conclude that near FRC the tracheal size of patients with CF is not different from that of age- and sex-matched control subjects. The tracheas of patients with CF expand more than do the tracheas of control subjects when higher lung volumes are attained, suggesting increased airway distensibility.\r"

The annual age- and sex-adjusted incidence rate per 100,000 person-years from 1975 to 1984 for Olmsted County was 6.2 and for Rochester, 6.3. This incidence rate is significantly higher than what had been reported previously in Rochester (3.6/100,000) or in other communities. The estimated 25-year survival of the MS population was 76.2% +/- 4.5% compared with 87.7% for the general US white population of a similar age and sex. Survival for men was less than for women. There was no increase in survival for patients diagnosed with MS in more recent decades. No significant increase was found in cancer or autoimmune disease rates in the MS patients.\r"

A randomized, double-blind protocol was used in which 20 patients, ASA physical status I or II, received either nitroprusside infusion (n = 10) or labetalol bolus injections of 10 mg every 10 min (n = 10) until mean arterial blood pressure was reduced to 55-60 mm Hg. Pulmonary artery pressures were measured and mixed venous samples obtained via a pulmonary artery catheter. Nitroprusside increased heart rate significantly more than labetalol during the period of hypotension. When compared with prehypotension baseline values, nitroprusside increased heart rate significantly with a concomitant significant decrease in systemic vascular resistance. Cardiac output increased significantly 60 min after hypotension was achieved in patients treated with nitroprusside. Systemic vascular resistance decreased significantly below baseline levels in patients treated with labetalol but without changes in cardiac output, heart rate, or mean pulmonary artery pressure. There was a 122% increase in intrapulmonary shunt with nitroprusside administration, compared with an 11% increase with labetalol. Labetalol was effective for inducing hypotension and was not associated with an increase in heart rate, intrapulmonary shunt, or cardiac output as seen with nitroprusside.\r"

Although many approaches and techniques have been advocated, since April 1983 we have used a left thoracophrenotomy approach for most lesions of the lower two thirds of the esophagus and gastric cardia. Stapling instruments have been used for mobilization of the stomach and fashioning of the esophagogastric anastomosis. One-hundred fifteen patients undergoing resection of malignant tumors with this technique were retrospectively reviewed. Perioperative mortality was 8.7% (10/115). The rate of anastomotic leakage was 1.7% (2/115), and benign narrowing of the anastomosis requiring dilation developed in 16 patients. The rate of recurrent anastomotic tumor was 4.3%. Eighteen patients had complications, and the mean postoperative hospital stay was 13 days. Survival at 3 years was 22.1%. During the period of study, 22 patients underwent esophageal resection by some other approach; the reasons for this are described. The advantages of the left thoracophrenotomy approach are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Coagulase-negative staphylococci are now the chief cause of bacteremia in neonatal intensive care units. To investigate potential risk factors for this nosocomial infection, we conducted a case--control study among 882 infants treated in two neonatal intensive care units during 1982. RESULTS. The 38 case patients and 76 controls were similar with respect to 27 indicators of the severity of the underlying illness. In addition, of the 20 potential risk factors for bacteremia that we investigated, only 2 met conventional criteria for causality. Infants with coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteremia were 5.8 times as likely as controls (95 percent confidence interval, 4.1 to 8.3) to have received intravenous lipid emulsion before the onset of bacteremia. Because the use of lipids was common, 56.6 percent of all of the cases of nosocomial bacteremia could be attributed to lipid administration. Infants with bacteremia were also 3.5 times as likely as controls (95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 8.3) to have had a percutaneously inserted central venous catheter (attributable risk, 14.9 percent). The induction time for bacteremia after lipid administration, usually through peripheral catheters, was often less than one day. In contrast, the average induction period for nosocomial bacteremia associated with the use of central catheters, which were rarely used for lipid administration, was at least 5.5 days. Similar analyses of data on an additional 31 neonates treated in 1988 confirmed the strong and apparently independent association of coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteremia with the intravenous administration of lipids (adjusted odds ratio, 5.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 3.5 to 6.7). CONCLUSIONS. The risk of coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteremia in infants in neonatal intensive care units can be attributed primarily to the intravenous administration of lipid emulsions. Since lipids are critical for the nutritional support of premature infants, further studies are needed to examine the pathogenesis and prevention of lipid-associated bacteremia.\r"

Hydergine, a combination of ergoloid mesylates, is the only approved medication for Alzheimer's disease, but despite widespread use its efficacy remains to be established. We conducted a clinical trial of Hydergine-LC, a newer preparation of ergoloid mesylates in the form of a liquid in a capsule (LC) that may have greater bioavailability, to determine its value in patients with Alzheimer's disease. METHODS AND RESULTS. Eighty older adults with probable Alzheimer's disease participated in this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of Hydergine-LC for 24 weeks. The recommended dose of 1 mg orally three times daily was used. Cognition and behavior were evaluated before and after the trial, and the patients were monitored for adverse effects. The medication was safe and well tolerated. The Hydergine-LC group did not perform better after treatment than the placebo group on any test, and its performance was worse (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.02, respectively) on one cognitive measure (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Digit Symbol Substitution Task) and on one behavioral scale (the Geriatric Evaluation by Relatives Rating Instrument). CONCLUSIONS. Hydergine-LC appears to be ineffective as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease.\r"

By discriminant analysis, admission serum urea and plasma glucose were identified to be factors with independent significance in predicting severity. If the presence of either factor higher than the cutoff point (urea greater than 7.4 mmol/l, glucose greater than 11.0 mmol/l) was considered as an indication of severe disease, then the sensitivity of this method was 75.0%, specificity 80.3% and the accuracy 79.3%. The predictive ability of this method was comparable with the Glasgow multifactor scoring system when the latter was also used to grade severity of our patients. It has the advantage, however, of simplicity and the ability of predicting severity at the time of admission.\r"

During a 2-year period, 65 carotid endarterectomies were performed with the use of brain mapping as the sole criterion for shunt replacement. Forty-three patients (66%) were found to have abnormal brain maps preoperatively. Ten patients (15%) developed ischemic changes after cross-clamping (all resolved after shunt placement). Postoperative brain maps were unchanged in 54 patients (83%) and improved in 7 patients (11%). A new, small focal abnormality was identified in 4 patients without shunts (6%), none of whom had a change in neurologic status. The overall major morbidity and mortality was 1.5%. Computerized brain mapping is a sensitive and readily interpretable means of monitoring cerebral perfusion during carotid surgery. We found the computerized electroencephalographic data to be a dependable criterion for selective shunting and for confirmation of shunt patency during carotid endarterectomy.\r"

  ".W": "The scope and technique of concentric mastopexy remain unclear and controversial. In our hands, the procedure has application for mild nipple ptosis, glandular ptosis, and areola asymmetry, as well as the tuberous breast. Early disappointment has changed to increasing satisfaction as we have gained confidence in predicting our results based on the identification of three simple principles of concentric mastopexy. The first and most important, which states Doutside less than or equal to Doriginal + (Doriginal - Dinside), requires that the outer concentric circle must be drawn not to exceed the original areola diameter by more than the original areola diameter exceeds the inner concentric circle diameter. The second principle, Doutside less than or equal to 2 X Dinside, recommends that the outer circle diameter be drawn not to exceed twice that of the inner circle, to prevent poor scarring or over flattening of the breast. The third principle, Dfinal = 1/2(Doutside + Dinside), allows prediction of the final areola size as the average of the diameters of the inner and outer concentric circles. These three principles allow excision of a maximum amount of areola and periareola skin without the side effect of poor scars, dilated areola, or misshapened breasts. Applying these three principles to concentric mastopexy with or without augmentation mammaplasty, one may confidently correct a wide variety of deformities, producing more symmetrical, attractive breasts with areolae of a predictable size.\r"

Induction chemotherapy with vincristine-doxorubicin-dexamethasone (VAD) produced a complete remission in five of six patients (83%).

  ".W": "Cyclosporine is a potent immunosuppressive agent with no appreciable effect on the bone marrow and a selective inhibitory effect on helper T cells. Oral cyclosporine was first used to prevent organ rejection but also has been reported to be effective in other disorders. In cutaneous diseases that respond to oral cyclosporine helper T cells appear to be involved in their pathogenesis. This article reviews the cutaneous diseases that have been treated with cyclosporine and its pharmacology and side effects. Two significant adverse side effects are renal dysfunction and hypertension, both of which are reversible when short-term low-dose (less than 5 mg/kg per day) oral cyclosporine is discontinued. Lymphoma is unlikely in an otherwise healthy patient who has received low-dose oral cyclosporine for limited periods. The use of oral cyclosporine in any patient should be carefully considered in terms of the risk/benefit ratio and needs to be carried out under close medical supervision. In view of the limited experience with cyclosporine in dermatology, whenever possible its use should be confined to formal clinical studies with established protocols and guidelines. Further controlled studies need to be performed to evaluate the efficacy of low-dose cyclosporine in many dermatoses and its side-effect profile, particularly over the long term.\r"

The posturing began at 3 to 14 months and consisted of \"leaning episodes\" in which the suprapubic region was applied to a firm edge or the parent's knee in one patient, stiffening of the lower extremities in a standing or sitting position in the second patient, and stiffening of the lower extremities while lying on their sides or supine in three infant patients. The posturing was often accompanied by irregular breathing, facial flushing, and diaphoresis, and lasted less than a minute to hours at a time. Management consisted of convincing the parents of the harmless nature of the activity, which then lessened the reinforcing effect of their responses. The posturing subsided, in time, without medical or surgical treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Viral infections in humans commonly result in the transient appearance of a variety of autoantibodies and, in some patients, the development of autoimmune tissue injury and disease. The capacity to cause or exacerbate an autoimmune process is common to many viruses, affecting mainly organs injured by the replicating virus, as demonstrated by several animal models. Viral \"footprints\" can often be found in patients with autoimmune diseases and include high titers of specific antiviral antibodies, identification of viral (retroviral) sequences, and the presence of alpha-interferons in the serum. Several mechanisms that are not mutually exclusive can account for the pathogenesis of virus-induced autoimmunity. Viruses may modify or release sequestered cellular proteins or affect the host's immune system by direct polyclonal activation of B cells, effects on immunoregulatory cells, and release of lymphokines. The appearance of antiviral antibodies may also be deleterious to the host through molecular mimicry, the generation of anti-idiotypic antibodies, or the formation of immune complexes. No single microorganism or mechanism can explain the extremely varied phenomena of autoimmunity, but growing evidence suggests that certain viral infections may lead to clinically manifest autoimmunity in individuals having genetic and possibly other predisposing factors.\r"

General formulas have been constructed on the basis of the data of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to predict the adult percentile in the population for serum cholesterol levels by age. A mathematical model and a computer program previously published by the author were employed in this study. Analysis of the computer-assisted predicted and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey-reported percentiles indicated that the designed program for calculating the formula was accurate and reliable. The formulas can determine the relationship among adult age, serum cholesterol level, and population percentile. It has been reported that adult individuals tend to have persistently the same percentiles of their serum cholesterol levels in the population with increasing ages in the absence of cholesterol-altering intervention. The percentiles predicted by the formula may reflect the relative degrees of risk for coronary heart disease. This information on the percentile may have a preventive diagnostic value for the detection, evaluation, and treatment of patients with high cholesterol levels. The percentile may be used as a parameter of risk assessment for coronary heart disease for all adult ages and sexes. However, clarification of a probable relationship between high percentiles (like high cholesterol levels) and coronary heart disease, and justification of the use of percentiles as a risk parameter, must await further clinical investigation.\r"

The infants received either placebo or 500 micrograms terbutaline from an inhaler using a coffee cup as a spacer device. Each treatment was maintained for two weeks, first placebo then active drug. The symptom score was reduced by 65% during the active treatment period compared with the placebo period and this was associated with a 32% improvement in lung function, reflected in an increase in functional residual capacity.

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Although neurologic complications are frequent in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, their incidence and progression in early human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection remain controversial. The goal of this study was to assess neurologic manifestations in asymptomatic carriers of HIV. METHODS. We studied 29 HIV-seropositive homosexual men and 33 seronegative homosexual controls by means of neurologic and neuropsychological examinations, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electrophysiologic tests (electroencephalography, multimodal evoked-potential tests, and otoneurologic tests). After six to nine months, the tests were repeated in 27 seropositive men and 30 controls. The investigators were blind to the serologic status of the subjects. RESULTS. The seropositive subjects had a mean CD4+ lymphocyte count of 635 X 10(6) per liter. Neurologic and neuropsychological examination, MRI, and measurements of pattern visual evoked potentials did not show significant differences between the two groups. The latencies of the median-nerve somatosensory evoked potentials were slightly prolonged in the seropositive men. The initial electroencephalogram was judged abnormal in 8 of 27 of the seropositive subjects (30 percent) as compared with none of the controls, with a slowing of fundamental activity, anterior spread [corrected] of alpha rhythm, subnormal reactivity, and unusual anterior theta activities. These findings were confirmed by computerized spectral analysis. The second electroencephalogram was abnormal in 10 of 25 of the seropositive men (40 percent). The otoneurologic evaluation identified abnormalities in the central auditory or vestibulo-ocular pathways in 34 percent of the seropositive men (10 of 29), as compared with 6 percent of the controls (2 of 33), on the first examination and in 44 percent (12 of 27) and 7 percent (2 of 30), respectively, on the second examination. Altogether, electrophysiologic abnormalities were found in 67 percent of the seropositive men (18 of 27) and 10 percent of the controls (3 of 30) (P less than 0.00005). CONCLUSIONS. In persons with asymptomatic HIV infection, electrophysiologic tests may be the most sensitive indicators of subclinical neurologic impairment. Electrophysiologic abnormalities are far more common in asymptomatic carriers of HIV than in controls and tend to progress over time.\r"

Furthermore, the quality of thought disorder in the groups of relatives was similar to that in the groups of probands, although it was clear that the relatives of schizoaffective-manic patients showed the highest amount of thought disorder, which was not found in the proband sample.

Carboxyhemoglobin levels were obtained on 753 patients admitted to the hospital from the emergency department over a 3-month period during the winter. Patients in whom CO poisoning was diagnosed in the emergency department prior to admission were excluded. The mean carboxyhemoglobin level was 2.52% +/- 1.85%; there was no significant difference in mean carboxyhemoglobin among patients with medical, surgical, neurological, and psychiatric admission diagnoses (F = 1.17; df = 3,746; P = .32). Two patients (0.3%; 95% confidence limits, 0.04% to 1.1%) from the entire admission cohort, and one of 20 patients (5%; 95% confidence limits, 0.3% to 26.9%) admitted with seizures, had carboxyhemoglobin levels greater than 10%. The carboxyhemoglobin levels of the two patients were only marginally elevated, with levels of 10.9% and 11.3%. The cost of the carboxyhemoglobin screening program was $2.26 per patient result, or approximately $2,100 over a 3-month winter heating season. A program for screening emergency department admissions with carboxyhemoglobin testing, although feasible in terms of cost, detected few cases of unrecognized CO poisoning.\r"

Review of 796 personal letters to family and friends written between 1884 and his suicide in 1890 reveals a man constantly in control of his reason and suffering from severe repeated attacks of disabling vertigo, not a seizure disorder. His own diagnosis of epilepsy was made from the written diagnosis by Dr Peyron, the physician at the asylum of St Remy (France), wherein on May 9, 1889, Van Gogh voluntarily committed himself to the asylum for epileptics and lunatics. However, the clinical descriptions in his letters are those of a person suffering from Meniere's disease, not epilepsy. The authors point out that Prosper Meniere's description of his syndrome (an inner-ear disorder) was not well known when Van Gogh died and that it often was misdiagnosed as epilepsy well into the 20th century.\r"

Because autoimmune diseases are often associated with an increased incidence of certain histocompatibility antigens, we examined the occurrence of specific HLA antigens in patients who had been treated for RSA. We found HLA-DR5 to be significantly overrepresented in the patients with RSA who aborted again after treatment with paternal mononuclear cell immunotherapy, compared with the incidence of this phenotype in a control population. Neither antinuclear antibodies nor antilymphocyte antibodies segregated with DR5. However, DR5+ patients who developed antilymphocyte antibodies after immunotherapy were more likely than all other treated patients to experience subsequent abortion (P less than 0.01). Our findings suggest the possibility of an underlying autoimmune disease in these women.\r"

Based on previous pathological studies and the experimental data in human and animals, the mechanism of the block is proposed to be ischemic.

Results reveal that final bacterial concentrations in the subcutaneous sites were significantly lower than in the muscle sites (p less than or equal to 0.0001) for each concentration of bacteria, with and without dead bone. Dead bone resulted in very significantly greater bacterial concentrations in both subcutaneous and muscle sites.

DESIGN: A prospective, randomized, crossover clinical trial. SETTING: A hypertension specialty outpatient clinic at the University of Tennessee, Memphis. PATIENTS: Healthy, young, white men who were moderate coffee drinkers (less than 6 cups/day) were recruited. Twenty-four subjects were randomized and 21 (average age 35.5 years) completed the trial. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were randomized to one of two groups: Group A drank three or more cups of coffee/day for two months, then crossed over to abstaining from coffee for two months; group B abstained from coffee first, then crossed over to drinking coffee. Only filter-brewed coffee was used. Subjects were seen at monthly intervals for blood pressure measurements. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The average coffee consumption was 3.6 cups/day during the coffee-drinking phases. There was no difference between the coffee-drinking phase and the abstention phase in either systolic blood pressure (110.1 mmHg vs. 108.0 mmHg, respectively; 95% CI of difference -7.3, 2.5) or diastolic blood pressure (67.2 mmHg vs. 69.6 mmHg, respectively; 95% CI of difference -2.2, 6.4). CONCLUSIONS: Moderate daily consumption of coffee does not elevate blood pressure.\r"

There are no reports of this phenomenon in patients with sickle cell anemia with vaso-occlusive crisis. We studied initial and follow-up immunophenotypic characteristics of 10 adult patients with sickle cell anemia in crisis and 15 adult patients with emergency conditions who presented with absolute lymphocytosis. On admission, both groups demonstrated increases in the numbers of CD20+ B cells and T cells of the CD2, CD4, CD8, and CD56 (NKH-1) phenotypes compared with control values. Findings in both groups of patients mimicked the results of parenteral epinephrine administration: a pan-B and -T lymphocytosis with marked increase in CD56 (fourfold to fivefold) and CD8 cells (threefold to fourfold) as well as moderate increases in CD20 and CD4 cells (twofold), resulting in a decrease in the CD4/CD8 ratio compared with control values. In patients with sickle cell anemia, there was an expected increase in the CD56 and CD4 populations; however, CD8 cells only doubled at the time of crisis. Therefore, the CD4/CD8 ratio was normal compared with control values. CD20+ B cell numbers exceeded those seen in the patients with medical and trauma emergencies. Elevated corticosteroid levels have been measured after injury in previous studies. Parenterally administered cortisol produces a lymphocytopenia after 4 to 6 hours that selectively decreases T cells. At 10 to 38 hours after admission, there was a marked reduction in the number of T cells in both groups of \"stressed\" patients, probably reflecting at least partial effects of endogenous corticosteroids. In contrast to the patients with medical and trauma emergencies, the mean lymphocyte count in the patients with sickle cell anemia remained elevated in the \"high normal\" range and consisted of increased numbers of B cells and CD4 cells. This finding persisted in the patients with sickle cell anemia for up to 3 months after presentation. The lymphocyte responses in both groups probably reflect interactions between adrenergic and steroidal factors.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Whether patients in clinical remission for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) continue to harbor leukemic cells is not known, because methods of detecting residual malignant cells have not been sufficiently sensitive. This information might be useful for predicting recurrence and determining the duration of therapy. METHODS. Using a sensitive new method--identifying complementarity-determining region III sequences with the polymerase chain reaction--we estimated the number of residual leukemic cells in the bone marrow of eight children with B-lineage lymphoblastic leukemia before and after remission. RESULTS. Induction chemotherapy produced a 3-to-4-log reduction in the number of leukemic cells. In all samples obtained up to 18 months after diagnosis, however, 0.004 to 2.6 percent of bone marrow nucleated cells were residual leukemic cells. Among the four patients studied more than 18 months after diagnosis, three had no detectable leukemic cells in marrow samples. Despite this, one of them, who was no longer receiving therapy, had a central nervous system relapse. In one patient receiving maintenance chemotherapy, there was a 60-fold increase in leukemic cells three months before bone marrow relapse. CONCLUSIONS. The complete disappearance of leukemic cells (or their reduction below our method's threshold of detection, 1 in 100,000 cells) may be necessary to achieve a cure of ALL. The quantification of residual leukemic cells in serial marrow aspirates during therapy may allow the early detection of relapse.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Recent improvements in the accuracy of sonographic diagnosis of neural-tube and ventral-wall defects have raised a question about the wisdom of routinely offering amniocentesis to women who have elevated levels of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein with a structurally normal fetus as determined by ultrasonography. METHODS. We reviewed the ultrasound findings in 51 consecutive fetuses with spina bifida, encephalocele, gastroschisis, or omphalocele that were delivered or aborted at a single hospital, to estimate the sensitivity of ultrasonography for these diagnoses. In all cases, the mothers had undergone prenatal sonography at one facility between 16 and 24 weeks after the last menstrual period. We used these data to calculate the probability of an affected fetus in a women with a given level of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein and a normal sonogram. RESULTS. These four types of anomalies were correctly identified in all 51 cases, yielding a sensitivity of 100 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 94 to 100 percent). Using the lower limit of this confidence interval, we calculated that the probability of an affected fetus ranges from 0.01 to 0.15 percent for maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels ranging from 2.0 to 3.5 times the median, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. This level of risk is less than the reported risk of abortion due to amniocentesis and may lead some women with elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein to decide not to proceed with amniocentesis.\r"

Earlobe crease was graded and defined as groups 1, 2, and 3 according to the depth and length in both ears. The extent of atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries and aortas was visually graded. Coronary atherosclerosis was significantly more severe in group 3 in all the decades examined than in groups 1 or 2. Aortic atherosclerosis in group 3 was significantly greater than in group 1 in all the decades examined, and was greater than in group 2 in the seventh and eighth decades. The TC level was significantly higher in group 3 than in groups 1 or 2 except in the sixth decade. Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated that the degree of ELC was dependent on the extent of coronary and aortic atherosclerosis, but was independent of age. Conversely, the extent of coronary atherosclerosis was dependent on the degree of ELC, but was independent of age. The extent of aortic atherosclerosis was, however, dependent not only on the appearance of ELC and TC, but on age. It is thus concluded that ELC provides a significant external marker for atherosclerosis and may reflect a persistent overload of atherosclerosis risk factors, such as TC.\r"

  ".U": "90362877\r", 
  ".W": "The effect of cooling to 25 degrees C on myocardial metabolism was studied during four periods of global ischemia (10 minutes each) followed by 15 minutes of reperfusion in dogs on cardiopulmonary bypass. Systemic and heart temperature at normothermia (group N, 34 degrees C; n = 15) was compared with general hypothermia (group H, 25 degrees C; n = 16). Before and at the end of each aortic crossclamp period in small myocardial biopsy specimens the adenosine triphosphate, creatine phosphate, inorganic phosphate, glycogen, and lactate content was analyzed. Also, lactate and inorganic phosphate were measured in the coronary effluents during the repetitive periods of reperfusion. Hemodynamic function was not different at 60 minutes after cardiopulmonary bypass compared with pre-cardiopulmonary bypass values, and was not different between the groups N and H. The tissue content of adenosine triphosphate and glycogen decreased progressively during the experimental period, resulting in slightly depressed values in both groups at the end of cardiopulmonary bypass. Pronounced effects of ischemia and reperfusion on tissue content of creatine phosphate, inorganic phosphate, and lactate were observed after each period of ischemia. The net decrease in tissue creatine phosphate content was not different between groups N and H (41 +/- 4 versus 38 +/- 4 mumol.gm-1 dry weight; mean +/- standard error of the mean) after 10 minutes of ischemia. However, during ischemia the net inorganic phosphate increase in myocardial tissue was significantly higher in group H (70 +/- 7 mumol.gm-1) than in group N (44 +/- 3 mumol.gm-1). These findings do not support the notion that myocardial protection is improved during hypothermia. Moreover, quantitatively the release of inorganic phosphate and lactate did not correlate with the amount accumulated in the myocardial tissue during the preceding periods of ischemia. The release appeared to be temperature dependent, that is, significantly reduced at 25 degrees C. The present data demonstrate why clinical outcome is satisfactory in both surgical procedures, when in general the periods of aortic crossclamping do not exceed 10 minutes each and the reperfusion periods in between the ischemic episodes last about 15 minutes. Besides, the findings indicate that hypothermia is not strictly necessary under these circumstances.\r"

In most other tissues, however, complete healing is the rule. I have explored the possibility that the high concentration of ascorbic acid normally present in aqueous humor inhibits wound healing after filtration surgery. At the concentration normally present in aqueous humor (1.1 mmol/L), ascorbic acid decreased the plating efficiency of cell suspensions of human Tenon's capsule fibroblasts by a mean (+/- SD) of 40% +/- 10%. When added to low-density monolayer cultures of fibroblasts, ascorbic acid decreased the cell number by 90% +/- 5%, an effect that was completely prevented by catalase. When added to confluent cultures, the cell number was decreased by only 14% +/- 2%. If ascorbic acid has similar effects on fibroblasts in vivo, it may contribute to the incomplete wound healing that characterizes successful glaucoma surgery.\r"

A vascular mark was present at birth in 68% of these infants. Visceral hemangiomas were associated with bulky cervicocephalic hemangiomas or with small hemangiomas scattered over the body. Among the 25 infants, 12 had laryngeal hemangiomas, 3 had hepatic hemangiomas, and 1 had gastrointestinal hemangiomatosis. Ocular sequelae, malocclusion, and cutaneous distortion were the most important functional problems. Corticosteroid treatment was used for 23 of 25 infants with alarming hemangiomas. There was a varied treatment response: total failure (30% of the patients); excellent, dramatic, rapid improvement (30% of the patients); and moderate, doubtful response, with the natural course of the disease remaining unaltered (40% of the infants). Arterial embolization, used in 6 infants, gave inconstant results. Cardiac failure, frequently associated with large cutaneous hemangiomas and always seen with hepatic multinodular hemangiomas, required digitalization. In some cases arterial embolization reduced the increased cardiac output. Liver hemangiomas had a high mortality; all 3 infants with hepatic involvement died.\r"

Some idiopathic movement disorders are markedly improved by small amounts of alcohol and this response occasionally may lead to alcoholism. Alcohol abuse alone or combined with hepatic encephalopathy can cause various types of tremor, asterixis, and cerebellar dysfunction. Alcohol withdrawal is occasionally complicated by transient basal ganglia dysfunction manifested by parkinsonism or chorea. These syndromes are distinct from the movement disorders complicating acquired hepatolenticular degeneration occurring in some chronic alcoholics. This review discusses the clinical and pathophysiologic aspects of the movement disorder syndromes that complicate alcohol abuse.\r"

In a semistructured interview we asked parents to discuss the aspects of the situation that they found stressful and to identify their predominant stressor. Then, using the Ways of Coping Questionnaire, we asked them to identify what coping strategies they used to cope with that predominant stressor. The questionnaire is designed to measure whether the strategies used are focused on the problem (situation) or on emotions engendered by the stressor or on both. Data on selected demographic characteristics of the family also were obtained. Fifty percent of the parent subjects identified stressors that were classified as loss of parenting role, 40% uncertainty over outcome, and 10% information need. Although the specific coping strategies used differed by the classification of stressors, all of the parents used a combination of both problem- and emotion-focused forms of coping. Seeking social support and positive reappraisal were the two most often used strategies by all parents regardless of the classification of stressors. No significant associations were found between stress or coping and any of the demographic variables. Research such as this can be useful to practicing clinicians who plan strategies that offer assistance and emotional support to parents of children hospitalized in the pediatric intensive care unit.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of the rate of intravenous infusion of protamine on the acute hemodynamic and pulmonary effects of heparin neutralization was investigated in six adult sheep surgically instrumented for chronic studies. Bovine lung heparin at a dose of 200 IU/kg was injected intravenously over 10 sec, 5 min before the start of protamine administration. On separate experimental days, each sheep received protamine at the same dose of 2 mg/kg, but it was infused over four different time periods: 3 s, 30 s, 300 s, or 30 min. At an additional session, protamine was administered over 3 s without prior heparinization to assess the effect of protamine alone. The sequence of the sessions was randomized and performed blindly. Injecting protamine in unheparinized sheep produced no change in any of the measured variables. In contrast, when protamine was injected over 3 s in heparinized sheep, it induced a transient and significant (P less than 0.001) pulmonary hypertension (from 17.2 +/- 1.5 to 45.6 +/- 2.4 mmHg at 1 min) with an increased pulmonary (five-fold) and systemic (2.5-fold) vascular resistance; a decrease of cardiac output (from 3.85 +/- 0.43 to 1.93 +/- 0.29 l/min) without change in left atrial pressure (from 5.3 +/- 1.3 to 6.0 +/- 1.7 mmHg; P = NS); a significant (P less than 0.001) increase of plasma thromboxane B2 (TxB2) concentrations (from 349 +/- 131 to 974 +/- 218 pg/ml); leukopenia (76 +/- 4% of baseline white blood cell counts); and hypoxemia (PaO2 decreased from 81 +/- 3 to 63 +/- 4 mmHg at 2 min). Administering the same amount of protamine after heparin at a slower infusion rate significantly attenuated and delayed all components of the adverse response to protamine. This attenuation occurred in an infusion rate-dependent fashion, so that when protamine was infused over 30 min, no significant changes in any of the measured variables were noted. The time course of plasma heparin concentrations following protamine indicated that chemical heparin was completely neutralized over the time period of protamine infusion. These results demonstrate that the rate of generation of heparin-protamine complexes (as detected by changes of plasma concentrations of chemical heparin) during iv protamine infusion started 5 min after heparin administration is a factor involved in the generation of sufficient mediators required to initiate a characteristic physiologic response in sheep, including systemic and pulmonary vasoconstriction, TxB2 generation, and leukopenia. Infusing a neutralizing dose of protamine over 30 min avoids these adverse reactions in sheep.\r"

Thirty patients had periampullary duodenal diverticula, and 14 had no diverticula. Because periampullary diverticula were associated with biliary and pancreatic complications, possibly as a result of stasis in the diverticula, the clinical course in patients with and without diverticula was compared. Endoscopic sphincterotomy was well tolerated and resulted in a rapid clinical improvement in all patients. There were four complications related to the procedure (pancreatitis, two, and cholangitis, two), all were treated conservatively, and there were no deaths. The clinical outcome was similar in both groups of patients. During a mean follow-up of 25 months (range, 6 to 58), only two patients (one of each group) underwent elective cholecystectomy 2 and 3 months after initial presentation. It is concluded that endoscopic sphincterotomy is a safe and effective alternative to surgery as an initial treatment in elderly patients with choledocholithiasis and gallbladder in situ. Periampullary duodenal diverticulum does not interfere with the favorable results of endoscopic sphincterotomy in patients with gallbladder in situ.\r"

The phenomenon is dependent on duration and degree of heating, optimum levels being reached at 3 h at 56 degrees C. Negative samples become positive after heating. The heating effect is more pronounced for IgG-aPLA than for IgM-aPLA and is not observed for adsDNA, atetanus or lymphocytotoxic antibodies. The presence of serum/plasma components in addition to IgG is essential for the phenomenon to occur. Ultracentrifugation and mixing experiments with isolated IgG did not enable us to explain our observations. Nevertheless, knowledge of this phenomenon is of practical importance.\r"

The number of fellowships has more than doubled since 1986, but few fellows graduate from these programs. There is currently a surplus of fellowship positions; over half of all programs did not recruit a first-year fellow for the 1989 academic year. In 1986, most family medicine-affiliated programs had independent administration. Almost half of the programs are now jointly sponsored with an internal medicine department. These programs are over six times more likely to train internists than family physicians. Although there has been a growth in geriatric training programs over the past three years, the number of family physicians seeking such training remains negligible.\r"

Group I patients (n = 57) received general anaesthesia and TEA for the operation, followed by continuous TEA (0.25 per cent bupivacaine) for 72 h. Group II patients (n = 59) received general anaesthesia for the operation, followed by systemic analgesia on request. Significant beneficial effects of TEA in group I were demonstrated by lower pain scores in the first 24 h after surgery and earlier defaecation. However, there were fewer temperature elevations in group II. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of positive bacteriological cultures, blood loss, need for postoperative mechanical ventilation and complications. However, there was a trend toward a higher rate of rectal anastomotic breakdown, increased blood replacement and intensive care therapy, and longer hospitalization in group I. These results do not suggest any significant beneficial therapeutic effect of continuous TEA in colonic surgery compared with a conventional systemic analgesic regimen. In selected patients (i.e. those with severe pain or those prone to develop postoperative ileus) continuous TEA may be beneficial.\r"

Patient characteristics (sex, primary site, type of surgery) were stratified at the time of registration; these and other patient characteristics (age, time from symptoms to diagnosis, race) were distributed similarly between treatments. Surgical resection was encouraged, but not mandatory. Local radiation therapy was the same as for IESS-I. The median follow-up time is 5.6 years. The overall outcome was significantly better on trt 1 than on trt 2. At 5 years, the estimated percentages of patients who were disease-free, relapse-free, and surviving were 68%, 73%, and 77% for trt 1 and 48%, 56%, and 63% for trt 2 (P = .02, .03, and .05, respectively). The major reason for treatment failure for both treatment groups was the development of metastatic disease. The lung was the most common site of metastases followed by bone sites. The combined incidence of severe or worse toxicity (67%) was comparable between the treatments; however, severe or worse cardiovascular toxicity was significantly greater on trt 1. Tne only treatment-associated deaths (N = 3) were on trt 1 and were cardiac-related.\r"

  ".W": "Vanadate, the major oxidized form of the essential trace element vanadium, has rapid effects on glucose transport in vitro and more delayed effects on glucose transport in vivo. We addressed the question that one potential mechanism for the delayed effects of vanadate on glucose homeostasis could be altered expression of one or more of the genes encoding glucose transporters. To do this we studied vanadate regulation of Glut-1 and Glut-4 in NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts. Vanadate (5-40 microM) induced cells to proliferate to higher cell densities, and in addition, 40 microM vanadate caused the cells to exhibit a transformed morphology. Glut-1 mRNA was maximally induced 4- to 5-fold over the control value after 6-h exposure to 30 microM vanadate. Unlike the response to serum and growth factors, the vanadate-induced increase in Glut-1 mRNA remained elevated over the control value in the presence of vanadate for 5 days. The vanadate effect was serum dependent and was fully reversible when vanadate was removed from the medium. In the absence of vanadate, the half-life of Glut-1 mRNA was 0.5-1 h, whereas after treatment for 5 h with 30 microM vanadate the half-life was increased to 1.5-2 h. Thus, mRNA stabilization accounts for at least a part of the increase in glucose transporter mRNA levels after vanadate treatment. Glut-4 mRNA was not detected in these cells in either the absence or presence of vanadate. While the importance of this increased Glut-1 gene expression for the vanadate effect on normalization of blood glucose in vivo remains to be determined, an association between vanadate-induced cell proliferation and transformed phenotype, and vanadate-induced Glut-1 mRNA in vitro has been made. Possible potential therapeutic use of vanadate for treatment of diabetes must, therefore, be viewed with caution.\r"

Patient evaluation by symptom history, computerized tomography and flow-volume loops is emphasized. Preoperative thoracic radiation therapy in severely symptomatic patients is associated with a decrease in postoperative respiratory complications and an improvement in risk. During radiation therapy a small window can be created to spare some tissue for adequate histological diagnosis. Anaesthetic management techniques for these patients are discussed. Life-threatening complications can occur at any point during anaesthesia for patients with mediastinal masses. Anaesthetists should have a high degree of awareness of the underlying anatomy, pathophysiology and anaesthetic alternatives when caring for these patients.\r"

Four equally time-spaced hand radiographs from 50 participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, who were followed for at least 20 years, were read separately and \"blindly\" by 4 experienced, trained readers. Eleven hand joints were individually assessed for the presence of osteophytes, joint space narrowing, subchondral cysts, subchondral sclerosis, lateral deformity, and cortical collapse, and were also graded using the Kellgren/Lawrence scale, a global estimate of OA. The intraclass correlation coefficient was used to determine cross-sectional inter- and intrareader reliability. Interreader agreement on OA progression was evaluated using life-table analysis. Each of the grading scales for the individual radiographic features of OA of the hand, except for cysts, were cross-sectionally reliable between readers. Each reader was able to reproduce his original scores almost perfectly when grading the radiographs a second time. Using these scales, the different readers agreed on all the features of longitudinal progression of OA of the hand, except cysts. We believe that this method for grading hand radiographs for OA has proved to be reliable for both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred four normal subjects ranging in age from 17 to 77 years and in height from 115 to 203 cm underwent nerve conduction studies of sural, peroneal, tibial, and median nerves. Foot temperature was measured in each patient. A strong inverse correlation was found between height and sural (r = -0.7104), peroneal (r = -0.6842), and tibial (r = -0.5044) conduction velocities. These correlations were significant at the P less than 0.001 level. Median conduction velocity was not correlated with height. Height was correlated with the distal latencies of all nerves studied (sural r = 0.6518, peroneal r = 0.4583, tibial r = 0.7217, median r = 0.5440). These correlations were significant at the P less than 0.001 level. Age was inversely correlated with both tibial (r = -0.4071) and median (r = -0.3464) nerve conduction velocities but not with sural and peroneal conductions. There were no correlations between distal latencies and age. If the variation in conduction velocity accounted for by the linear relationship with height was removed, then age would be inversely correlated to all conduction velocity measurements with the exception of the sural. Temperature is inversely correlated with the sural (r = -0.2233), peroneal (r = -0.2102), and tibial (r = -0.2710) distal latencies. In all instances, the effects of age and temperature were minor determinants when compared with the effects of height. Diagnostic conclusions made from nerve conduction data without correcting for height may be invalid in patients taller and shorter than normal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The study included 100 patients, 23 women and 77 men with the average age 34.4 +/- 9.7 (range 18-61) years. The study included only those who were employed. The patients were randomly allocated to two groups, one group receiving treatment according to the McKenzie technique and the other group receiving education in a \"mini back school.\" Assessments were made after 3 weeks by an independent observer and after 52 weeks they were seen by one of the authors. Patients were assessed on seven variables: return to work, sick-leave during the initial episode, sick-leave during recurrences, recurrences of pain during the year of observation, patients' ability to self-help, pain and movement. Although the effect of attention placebo cannot be ruled out, the results demonstrated that the McKenzie method of treatment for patients with acute low-back pain was superior for five out of seven variables studied. The only variables that did not show any statistically significant differences were sick-leave during recurring episodes of pain and patients' ability to self-help.\r"

ARDS was defined as three or four quadrant alveolar filling roentgenographically, a PaO2 less than 80 mm Hg with an FIO2 greater than .5 and a Ppw less than 18 mm Hg. Patients were divided into two groups: group 1 included all patients in whom there was a reduction of Ppw by at least 25 percent, and group 2 included patients in whom there was no, or less than a 25 percent reduction in Ppw. Survival was statistically different between the groups with 12 of 16 group 1 patients and seven of 24 group 2 patients surviving to hospital discharge. This difference remained statistically significant after stratifying patients by age and the APACHE II severity of illness index. We conclude that this retrospective analysis supports the notion that treatment of low pressure pulmonary edema with reduction of Ppw is associated with an increased survival.\r"

There is, however, a third option. The New York State Department of Health has developed a proposal for universal access--Universal New York Health Care, or UNY-Care--that would retain the existing payers, including employer-based insurance coverage, but combine them in a one-payer framework. Providers would no longer have to interact with the many public and private payers, each with its own rules, criteria, and levels of payment. The single payer would serve as the only payer for most health care services and would also negotiate reimbursement rates. The single-payer framework should bring savings in administrative and billing costs and should move government closer to the goal of buying health care services--getting good value for payment rendered--rather than simply paying bills as they are submitted. Although the single-payer strategy could be implemented at either the state or the federal level, it seems ideal as the principal responsibility of the states in a national plan for universal coverage.\r"

The results indicate that formal parotidectomy is an acceptable means of treating the small number of malignant tumours presenting in this way, and strengthen the argument that attempts to obtain a histological diagnosis before treatment are contraindicated.\r"

We performed a prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical trial of the effectiveness of prism adaptation. Two levels of randomization were used. Sixty percent of the patients underwent prism adaptation and 40% did not. Of those who responded to prisms with motor stability and sensory fusion, half underwent a conventional amount of surgery and half underwent augmented surgery based on the prism-adapted angle of deviation. Success rates were highest (54 [89%] of 61 patients) in prism adaptation responders who underwent augmented surgery and lowest (92 [72%] of 127 patients) in patients who did not undergo prism adaptation. Prism responders had better results with augmented surgery than with conventional surgery (54 [89%] of 61 patients vs 53 [79%] of 67 patients, P = .23). Our results indicated a significant beneficial overall effect of prism adaptation in patients with acquired esotropia (success rates, 83% vs 72%, P = .04). Although the process requires some additional time and effort, it appears to result in a higher rate of satisfactory alignment.\r"

One case of pulmonary Aspergillus infection was found with no evidence of cerebral disease. Infection tended to occur in the period soon after transplantation, was associated with high dose steroids, retransplantation, and showed a significant seasonal incidence. Neurological findings were non-specific and only two cases were diagnosed before death. Aspergillus infection soon after transplantation indicates that this organism is a considerable nosocomial hazard, particularly in the winter and spring months. Positive cultures before death are rarely obtained and antifungal treatment should be started on clinical suspicion alone.\r"

  ".W": "Despite the risks associated with renovascular hypertension and the durable benefits of revascularization, the detection of patients with renovascular hypertension and the selection of those who will benefit from interventional therapy remains a challenge. We have previously documented the reliability of captopril renal scintigraphy in predicting angiographically significant renal artery stenosis in patients suspected of having renovascular hypertension. In the present study we report our recent experience with this noninvasive technique in predicting outcome after revascularization. Captopril renal scintigraphy involves the administration of 50 mg of captopril 3 hours after a baseline technitium-99m diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid renal scan and 1 hour before a repeat captopril renal scintigraphy scan. Nineteen of the last 70 patients with clinically suspected renovascular hypertension undergoing captopril renal scintigraphy had abnormal renal scan outcomes, and 17 had a decrease in flow or function after captopril (positive captopril renal scintigraphy). Eight of these 17 with abnormal findings on captopril renal scintigraphy underwent revascularization, and the hypertension was cured or improved in six of the eight: two of three after surgical bypass grafting and four of five after angioplasty. In the seven surviving patients with abnormal renal scan results but no change with captopril (negative captopril renal scintigraphy), improvement in hypertension after treatment occurred in only one: one of two after nephrectomy, zero of three after bypass surgery, and zero of two after angioplasty (p less than 0.05). We conclude that captopril renal scintigraphy is an accurate predictor of hypertension response to revascularization. Further evaluation of this new noninvasive technique for assessing patients with suspected renovascular hypertension appears warranted.\r"

Thirty-five sides of brains from 20 autopsied adult patients were examined under a surgical microscope (x 5-x 25). One attaching point was found on 10 facial nerves, two points on 20 nerves, and three points on four nerves. More than two thirds of the facial nerves were attached at two points: the root exit zone and the distal cisternal portion. In a case of distal attachment, the contact artery formed an arterial-nerve complex with the distal portions of the facial and acoustic nerves. The arterial attachment at the root exit zone was evident on 24 of the 35 facial nerves (69%), and most of the contact arteries were the anterior inferior cerebellar artery and its branches. In five nerves, the root exit zone was attached at two points to arteries. The anatomy of autopsied brains without hemifacial spasm is not identical to that of actual clinical cases of hemifacial spasm; nevertheless, the results do aid in intraoperative anatomical orientations.\r"

In both groups, the ventilatory responses were adequate for the metabolic demands of the exercise; this resulted in regulation of arterial PCO2 and pH despite the absence of cardiac output increase in the implanted group. In this group, there was a small but significant reduction of arterial PO2 by 4 +/- 3 Torr and a rise of blood lactate by 1.1 +/- 1 mmol/l. When cardiac output was experimentally increased in the implanted calves to a level commensurate with that spontaneously occurring in the control calves, ventilation was not affected. However, experimental reductions of cardiac output led to an immediate augmentation of exercise hyperpnea by 4.56 +/- 4.3 l/min and a further significant lactate increase of 1.2 +/- 1.22 mmol/l that was associated with a significant decrease in the exercise O2 consumption (0.32 +/- 0.13 l/min). These observations indicate that neither cardiac nor hemodynamic effects of increased cardiac output constitute an obligatory cause of exercise hyperpnea in the calf.\r"

  ".W": "Exercise electrocardiographic (ECG) testing during follow-up after coronary angioplasty is widely applied to evaluate the efficacy of angioplasty, even in asymptomatic patients. One hundred forty-one asymptomatic patients without previous myocardial infarction underwent quantitative exercise ECG testing and quantitative coronary angiography 1 to 6 months after successful angioplasty in single vessel coronary artery disease to 1) determine the value of exercise ECG testing to detect \"silent\" restenosis, and 2) assess the long-term prognostic value of exercise ECG testing and coronary angiography. The prevalence of restenosis (defined as greater than or equal to 50% luminal narrowing at the dilation site) was 12% in this selected study group. Of 26 patients with an abnormal exercise ECG (ST segment depression greater than or equal to 0.1 mV), only 4 (15%) showed recurrence of stenosis. Sensitivity and specificity for detection of restenosis were 24% and 82%, respectively. One hundred thirty-four patients (95%) were followed up 1 to 64 months (mean 35) after exercise ECG testing and coronary angiography. Thirty-two patients (24%) experienced a cardiac event: in 25 patients (78%) the initial event was recurrent angina pectoris (New York Heart Association class III or IV) and in 7 patients (22%) it was myocardial infarction, although cardiac death did not occur. The mean interval between exercise ECG testing and the initial cardiac events was 14 months (range 1 to 55), whereas 47% of the initial events took place less than or equal to 6 months after exercise ECG testing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Several systems exist for classifying pressure ulcers, though none of them have been evaluated for interrater reliability. A new grading scale was compared with the commonly used Shea classification. This new scale was developed to provide a more complete description of pressure ulcer healing. The advantages of this scale include a classification of red areas as ulcers to help prevent further deterioration and classification of healed sores to note potential problems. The Yarkony-Kirk scale classifies a red area as a grade 1 ulcer, and involvement of the epidermis and dermis with no subcutaneous fat observed as a grade 2 ulcer. Grade 3 indicates exposed subcutaneous fat with no muscle observed. Exposed muscle without bone involvement is classified as a grade 4 ulcer, and grade 5 describes exposed bone with no joint space involvement. Grade 6 indicates joint space involvement. There is a classification of pressure sore healed to indicate a healed pressure ulcer. Interrater reliability was assessed by two nurses. In spite of an increased number of categories for the Yarkony-Kirk scale, there was no decline in reliability. Reliability was excellent with an interrater correlation of 0.90 for the Yarkony-Kirk scale and 0.86 for the Shea classification when measured for 72 patients. Eighty-five percent of the ratings for the Yarkony-Kirk scale were identical, whereas only 68% were identical for the Shea classification. Three percent of the ratings for the Shea classification were greater than +/- 1 category; 6% of the ratings for the Yarkony-Kirk scale were greater than +/- 1 category. This scale appears to possess good reliability and to describe pressure ulcers more completely. This scale may also be used to teach prevention activities as well as ulcer classification.\r"

The medication compliance of 105 patients receiving antihypertensive medications was monitored by analyzing data obtained from special pill containers that electronically record the date and time of medication removal. Inaccurate compliance estimates derived using the simple pill count method were thereby avoided. Compliance was defined as the percent of days during which the prescribed number of doses were removed. Compliance improved from 59.0% on a three-time daily regimen to 83.6% on a once-daily regimen. Thus, compliance improves dramatically as prescribed dose frequency decreases. Probably the single most important action that health care providers can take to improve compliance is to select medications that permit the lowest daily prescribed dose frequency.\r"

  ".W": "Studies of insect host-parasitoid interactions have contributed much to the consensus that spatial patchiness is important in the regulation of natural populations. A variety of theoretical models predict that host and parasitoid populations, although unstable in the absence of environmental heterogeneity, may persist at roughly steady overall densities in a patchy environment owing to variation in levels of parasitism from patch to patch. Observed patterns of parasitism, however, have a variety of forms (with variation in attack rates among patches depending directly or indirectly on host density, or showing variation uncorrelated with host density). There is some confusion about the dynamical consequences of these different forms. Here we first show how the dynamical effects of all these forms of environmental heterogeneity can be assessed by a common criterion. This 'CV2 greater than 1 rule' states that the overall population densities will remain roughly steady from generation to generation if the coefficient of variation squared (CV2) of the density of searching parasitoids in the vicinity of each host exceeds approximately unity. By partitioning CV2 into components, we show that both direct and inverse patterns of dependence on host density, and density-independent patterns, all contribute to population regulation in the same way. Second, we show how a maximum-likelihood method can be applied to the kind of field data that are usually available (that is, percentage parasitism versus local host density) to estimate the components of CV2. This analysis indicates that heterogeneity is large enough to stabilize dynamics in 9 of 34 published studies, and that density-independent heterogeneity is the main factor in most cases.\r"

Ninety-seven (31%) reported severe hypoglycemia, and a further 50 (16%) reported moderate hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person but not resulting in coma or convulsion. In 164 children (53%) there was no history of either moderate or severe hypoglycemia. Sixty-nine (22%) reported the occurrence of more than one severe hypoglycemic episode (range 2 to 20); 52 (16%) reported such an event in a single year. A total of 285 episodes were reported, 39% during sleep and 61% while awake. Children reporting such events tended to have diabetes of longer duration and be younger at the time of the first episode. Hemoglobin A1c concentration at the time closest to the severe episode was significantly lower than in children reporting no hypoglycemia. All families had been taught to use glucagon to reverse severe hypoglycemia at home, but it was available in only 80 of the 97 homes and used in only 30. These data suggest that severe hypoglycemia is common in children with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus who are treated conventionally. Greater vigilance and education are required both to prevent and to treat severe hypoglycemia in children with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\r"

During the last two decades, there have been significant changes in medical practices in America. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the removal of a respirator or hydration or nutrition from a patient who was not brain dead was considered a deviation from accepted medical practices. In 1976, the Quinlan case allowed the removal of a ventilator from a patient in a persistent vegetative state. Subsequent court decisions in the 1980s have equated hydration and artificial feeding with other forms of life-sustaining treatments and have allowed their withdrawal in patients who were not terminally ill. Prominent physicians have recently stated that it is not immoral for a physician to assist in the rational suicide of a terminally ill patient. Active euthanasia programs in the United States are likely in the near future.\r"

  ".W": "Of 84 patients with dystrophic forms of epidermolysis bullosa consecutively enrolled in the National Epidermolysis Bullosa Registry, four were noted by indirect immunofluorescence with the LH 7:2 monoclonal antibody to have granular basilar keratinocyte intracytoplasmic deposits, rather than exclusively linear basement membrane deposits, of type VII collagen. Indirect immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that these deposits were primarily perinuclear, although lesser amounts were also detectable between tonofibril bundles, within hemidesmosomes, and within and beneath the lamina densa. In two patients the mode of transmission was autosomal dominant; in two others the inheritance pattern was unknown. Whereas widespread lesions were present at birth, in each case blistering ceased within the first year of life, reminiscent of the findings in transient bullous dermolysis of the newborn. We interpret these laboratory findings as indicative of the presence of a defect in the intracytoplasmic packaging or in the transport of type VII collagen within basilar keratinocytes.\r"

Patients with panic disorder were less sensitive than controls to diazepam using eye velocity as the dependent measure. Sedation and memory effects did not distinguish the two groups. These findings suggest that panic disorder is associated with functional subsensitivity of the gamma-aminobutyric acid-benzodiazepine supramolecular complex in brain-stem areas controlling saccadic eye movements.\r"

Therefore we investigated the density, distribution, and phenotype of dermal macrophages in normal human skin using a panel of monoclonal antibodies for single and double labeling. We demonstrate here that within normal human dermis macrophages reside with a remarkable density. Principally, these cells exhibit the phenotype of the phagocytic macrophage system (CD11c+, KiM8+), whereas members of the immune phagocyte system (CD11c+, KiM8-) are absent from normal dermis with the exception of a few Langerhans cells in the papillary body. Within the dermal phagocytic macrophage system we uncover an unexpected phenotypical and morphologic heterogeneity, which correlates with the tissue localization. This study provides a basis for investigating the participation and change of the dermal macrophage system in cutaneous disorders.\r"

These findings draw attention to the importance of 1) standardized prospective data for studies of suicide, 2) assessment of short-term suicide risk factors, and 3) anxiety symptoms as modifiable suicide risk factors within a clinically relevant period.\r"

There were 82 male patients and 19 female patients. The mean age was 58 years with a range of 25 to 82 years. The indication for implantation was ventricular fibrillation in 89 patients and recurrent ventricular tachycardia in 12 patients. Seventy-seven patients had a history of prior myocardial infarction or coronary artery disease, or both. Eighteen patients had nonischemic cardiomyopathy. One patient had a prolonged QT syndrome and five patients had no evidence of preexisting structural heart disease. The mean injection fraction was 37% +/- 17%. Forty-one of the automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantations were associated with procedures necessitating cardiopulmonary bypass. The hospital mortality rate was 4% and the morbidity rate was 15%. The only statistical difference between those patients who did and did not have postoperative complications was a history of a prior myocardial infarction (90% versus 54%, p less than 0.05). Twenty percent of patients had new-onset postoperative atrial fibrillation after implantation of the device. Eleven percent of patients had sustained ventricular tachycardia postoperatively. Although there was a trend toward a higher complication/death rate in the patients whose automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was inserted in association with cardiopulmonary bypass (24% versus 15%) and the occurrence of new-onset postoperative atrial fibrillation (27% versus 15%), these findings were not statistically significant. Automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation with and without concomitant cardiopulmonary bypass is associated with a clinically important morbidity and mortality rate and development of postoperative arrhythmias.\r"

Plasma IGF-I levels declined progressively with falling indices of PCM (P less than 0.001) and correlated especially with the parameters relating to protein deficiency. While the severity of liver dysfunction and histopathologic alterations in the liver also related to plasma IGF-I concentration, partial correlation analysis showed that only PCM correlated significantly with IGF-I levels independent of the other factors. These findings indicate that IGF-I levels reflect nutritional status even in the presence of alcoholic liver disease.\r"

Our study group consisted of 74 HIV-positive homosexual men belonging to groups II B, III and IV C2 from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) classification of HIV disease. Following a 3-week observation period, volunteers were treated with zidovudine 600 mg/day for 18 weeks, 900 mg/day for 9 weeks and 1200 mg/day for 9 weeks, followed by a washout period of 6 weeks after which they were re-started on 1200 mg/day or the highest tolerated dose at 8-hourly intervals. Subjects were randomly assigned to 4-hourly or 8-hourly regimens within CDC groups while taking 600 and 1200 mg/day. Clinical and laboratory evaluations were performed at 3-week intervals. Symptomatic adverse effects were present in 96% of subjects, most commonly nausea (64%), fatigue (55%) and headache (49%). These were generally self-limited, reappearing briefly at each dose increment. A decrease in hemoglobin occurred shortly after initiation of therapy. This was not dose dependent and reversed rapidly upon discontinuation of treatment. A red blood cell count decrease, a mean cell volume increase and a granulocyte count decrease developed early in a dose-independent fashion, reverting at least partially during the washout phase. The decrease in reticulocyte count was dose related between 600 and 900 mg/day with no further change when the dose was escalated to 1200 mg/day. Bone marrow changes occurred rapidly as demonstrated by megaloblastosis in 95% of 65 specimens at week 18.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

AIDS attack rates after 30 months in the same cohort have been previously reported [1], and were as follows: 6.8% in the core-antibody positives versus 35.7% in the core-antibody negatives. 6.9% in the HIV-1-Ag negatives versus 43.9% in the HIV-1-Ag positives, and 6.1% in those with CD4+ lymphocyte counts greater than or equal to 0.5 versus 51.9% in those with CD4+ lymphocyte counts less than 0.5 x 10(9)/l. The disappearance of core antibody, the appearance of antigen and the occurrence of low CD4+ lymphocyte counts preceded AIDS by a mean (s.d.) of 21.3 (8.9), 17.7 (8.8) and 15.7 (8.9) months, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We interviewed a group of 145 injecting drug users (IDUs) in Amsterdam about their drug use, participation in a needle-exchange programme and needle sharing. Approximately 1 year later 60 IDUs were followed up. IDUs who exchange regularly ('exchangers') are older, inject longer and are more often in contact with methadone programmes. Exchanging is associated neither with an increase in injecting nor with lending needles to other IDUs. The risk level of injecting of the exchangers is much lower than that of the non-exchangers. From this it can be concluded that a needle exchange is an effective prevention programme against the spread of HIV infection. However, efforts have to be made to reach the group of younger short-term injectors and those IDUs who are not in contact with methadone-maintenance programmes. Since there are indications that regular injectors in particular exchange, and since young male injectors are more at risk of borrowing independent of exchanging, it is argued that an exchange programme should be complemented with other prevention approaches, i.e. intensive counselling and the spread of leaflets with information on cleaning used needles with bleach.\r"

  ".W": "We analysed HIV-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses to gag and env peptides in infants born to HIV-positive mothers. Questions of interest were whether there are early specific markers for prognosis, and whether any specific IgG is related to the prevention of vertical transmission of infection. Fifty-three children, 0-24 months old and born to HIV-1-infected mothers, were retrospectively divided into two groups based on HIV seroreactivity or non-reactivity at 15 months of age. Their sera were used to find reactivities important in diagnosis and/or prediction of the putative HIV disease. Three important findings emerged. First, a low IgG titer against the very immunodominant penv9 in newborns was found to be associated with rapid progression to AIDS. This difference was clearly reflected in the reactivity to a small peptide representing amino acid (aa) 598-606. The second interesting finding was the putative hypervariable loop on gp120 (especially aa 324-338), reactivity to which was found only in the uninfected group, and was seen in six out of 19 uninfected children under 6 months of age. This specific response was not caused by a generally high total anti-HIV reactivity, and may indicate a role of protective antibodies against vertical transmission. The response to this region in the infected group, on the other hand, was directed to the amino terminal half of the putative loop, in particular peptide 53, aa 304-318. Finally, response to a part of the amino terminal end of P17 was seen in seven out of eight infected children over 6 months of age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Cord-blood sera of 36 babies born to HIV-positive mothers in Switzerland were tested for immunoglobulin (Ig) M or IgA by HIV Western blot. IgM was found in 28, and IgA in 19 of unabsorbed sera. Preabsorption with immobilized protein A or G was used to remove IgG, which allowed differentiation between HIV-specific and IgG-specific IgM or IgA. Protein G proved superior and showed that 30% of 23 sera had HIV-specific IgM, while 48% had HIV-specific IgA. HIV-specific IgM and/or IgA was found in 13 out of 21 cases (62%); four out of 21 (19%) had both. HIV-specific IgM reacted most frequently with pol or env proteins, while HIV-specific IgA reacted more frequently with gag than pol; no IgA were directed against env proteins. IgG-specific IgM and IgA, mostly at gag bands, were present in 83 and 38%, respectively. Thus, a large percentage of children born to HIV-positive mothers have HIV-specific IgA and/or IgM which can be distinguished from IgG-specific IgA or IgM, which is also present in the majority of such children. Future studies will have to show whether these antibodies are of diagnostic relevance.\r"

Heat treatment at 56 degrees C or 70 degrees C for 1 h did not demonstrably affect antibody activity as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. Prolonged treatment up to 18 h reduced the activity to some extent. Drying at room temperature of filter papers which had been soaked with HIV was sufficient to inactivate low, but not high, amounts of infectious virus. After exposure of the filter paper discs to 56 degrees C or 70 degrees C for 1 h, HIV could not be isolated from the extracts. The obvious advantage of blood collection on filter paper for serological studies makes it an alternative to venipuncture, especially when the blood might be contagious for HIV.\r"

The number of questionnaires returned was 2143 (55%). Overall, HIV prevalence was 1.2% and was highest among homosexual and bisexual men: 6% in November and 9% in April, with no statistical difference. Sixteen per cent of the men reported homosexual behaviour, 7% reported intravenous drug use, and 60% more than one opposite-sex partner within the last 12 months. No substantial difference was observed between reported risk factors in November and April. Overall, 18% had been tested at least once before; this figure rose to approximately 50% among homosexual men and intravenous drug abusers, a substantial number of whom had engaged in risk behaviour since the latest test. Sixty percent of men and 75% of women were tested at general practitioners', and 22% and 13% at sexually transmitted disease clinics; only 6% of men and 3% of women had used alternative test sites. It is concluded that studies of anti-HIV-tested people can give detailed information about patterns of HIV testing and indications of trends in HIV infection rates, thereby supplementing other forms of HIV surveillance.\r"

The percentages of subjects positive for at least one marker at the first, second, third and fourth examinations were 66, 88, 94 and 97%, respectively. The increase in the number of markers with time was significant (chi-square test; P less than 0.001). This increase suggests a progression to AIDS in the majority of asymptomatic seropositive subjects, even those without a decreased CD4 lymphocyte count.\r"

  ".W": "Treatment of AIDS patients with zidovudine is associated with an increase in lymphocyte counts. The mechanism for this increase is unclear and somewhat surprising in view of the myelosuppressive effect of zidovudine. To investigate this further, we measured lymphocyte numbers, T-cell subsets, and the ability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to form T-cell colonies (T-CFC) in agar formation, in a group of patients with AIDS, before and during the first 6 months of zidovudine treatment. Eight patients were treated for an average of 11 weeks. There was a significant increase in T-CFC with zidovudine treatment (11.5 +/- 4.7% versus 29.8 +/- 6.9%, P less than 0.02 using a paired Student's t-test). There was a non-significant trend in the improvement of lymphocyte counts in these patients (872 +/- 117 versus 1102 +/- 204, NS). In vitro exposure of lymphocytes to zidovudine (200 mumol/l) resulted in modest suppression of T-CFC formation, suggesting that the effect of zidovudine treatment is indirect. Given that we have previously shown that inactivated HIV can inhibit T-CFC formation, we suggest that zidovudine treatment indirectly allows an increase in lymphocyte number by decreasing virus load, thereby permitting greater T-cell repopulation.\r"
