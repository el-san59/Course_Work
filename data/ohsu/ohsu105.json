Acidosis decreased the partition coefficient of both agents into the myocardium and that of bupivacaine into the brain but did not systematically change that of either agent into skeletal muscle or fat. Total body and hepatic drug clearances were not affected systematically, but plasma binding of both agents was decreased. Thus predictions based on the pH partition hypothesis about the effects of acidosis on myocardial:blood partition coefficients being a basis for explaining the relative toxicity of these agents were not supported.\r"

The incidence of conduction block by lidocaine 0.3 and 0.6 mM (8.1-16.2 mg/dl) was determined on 35 individual axons in dissected filaments of rabbit recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) in which the control conduction velocity ranged from 28 to 77 m/sec. Thirty-four axons (97%) remained excitable in lidocaine 0.3 mM; 2 axons (6%) remained excitable in lidocaine 0.6 mM. These proportions did not differ significantly (P greater than 0.2) from those in thinner axons of vagus, either in comparisons with previous data from extracellular recordings or with new data from filament recordings. The results imply that differential blocks observed under clinical conditions probably depend on factors other than a size-related difference in the minimal equilibrium blocking concentration among myelinated axons. Equilibrium depression of the amplitude of RLN compound action potentials by lidocaine 0.3 and 0.6 mM was disproportionately great relative to the incidence of equilibrium conduction block in individual axons, confirming that depression of the compound action potential is not a reliable measure of nerve conduction block.\r"

These cells were chosen because of putative neurotoxicity associated with CP; cell multiplication (measured as colony-forming ability-CFA) was studied because CFA is a reliable in vitro test for drug toxicity at the cellular level. CFA was dramatically reduced (86%) after 20-hr exposure to commercial solutions of CP. Shorter exposure times (3 hr) resulted in a marginal toxic effect (32%). At similar concentrations and after 20-hr exposure time, CP crystalline solutions induced a 37.5% inhibition that decreased with decreased time in culture. Sodium bisulfite reduced cell multiplication to a degree that varied with different samples of SB. With a 3-hr exposure time, CFA was reduced 72-92% by SB-1 and 57-72% by SB-2. The variability of SB toxicity and the difference in toxicity with commercial and crystalline solutions of CP are discussed in terms of possible clinical toxicity.\r"

These data were compared with simultaneous arterial PCO2 measurements. In infants and children weighing greater than or equal to 12 kg, both distal and proximal end-tidal PCO2 values approximated arterial PCO2 measurements. In infants and children weighing less than 12 kg, however, only distal end-tidal PCO2 measurements approximated arterial PCO2 measurements.

The times to recovery from analgesia at T12 and for the total disappearance of analgesia were longer in the older patient group. Effects of age on duration of motor blockade could not be demonstrated.

This prediction proved valid in a study of these four agents in rats given 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, or 1.6 MAC for 2.0 hr or 1.6 MAC for 0.5 or 1.0 hr. At a given dose and duration, awakening was most rapid with the least soluble agent and longest with the most soluble agent. For example, recovery of muscle coordination at 1.2 MAC administered for 2 hr required 4.7 +/- 3.0 min (mean +/- SD) with I-653, 14.2 +/- 8.1 min with sevoflurane, 23.2 +/- 7.6 min with isoflurane, and 47.2 +/- 4.7 min with halothane.\r"

The resistance to breakdown by soda lime of a new halogenated volatile anesthetic, I-653, was compared with the resistances found for halothane, isoflurane, and sevoflurane. The four anesthetics were injected concurrently into flasks containing 500 ml of gas and 100 g of soda lime maintained at 40, 60, and 80 degrees C. Four or five flasks were tested at each temperature. The rate of anesthetic degradation increased as temperature increased. Degradation was greatest with sevoflurane and least with I-653. At 80 degrees C, the rate of degradation per hr was 92.2 +/- 5% with sevoflurane; 16.0 +/- 1.6% with halothane; 13.1 +/- 3.7% with isoflurane; and 0.44 +/- 0.26% with I-653 (means +/- SD). The in vitro stability of I-653 suggests that it may strongly resist biodegradation.\r"

However, cimetidine is known to inhibit clearance of many drugs by reducing hepatic blood flow and by inhibiting cytochrome P-450 enzymes. The purpose of this study was to determine whether cimetidine during epidural anesthesia alters the metabolism, disposition, protein binding, or placental transfer of bupivacaine. Thirty-six patients undergoing cesarean section with 0.5% bupivacaine for epidural anesthesia were studied. Sixteen patients received cimetidine (300 mg IM) 1-4 hr before cesarean section and 20 control patients received sodium citrate (30 ml PO) 10 min preoperatively. Bupivacaine and its inactive metabolite, 2,6-pipecolylxylidine (PPX) were quantitated by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Maternal plasma concentration time curves, fetal/maternal ratios at delivery, cord vein/cord artery ratios. PPX/bupivacaine ratios, and maternal and neonatal urinary excretion were compared between the two groups. No significant differences could be found between the groups in any of the outcome variables. However, in the presence of cimetidine, the percentage of unbound bupivacaine significantly increased from 1.36 +/- 0.63 to 1.66 +/- 0.78%. The results suggest that a single 300-mg IM dose of cimetidine does not significantly affect bupivacaine disposition or metabolism in parturients when given 1-4 hr before anesthesia.\r"

The catheters were inserted in anesthetized dogs in the prone position. Swan-Ganz catheters were positioned with the RA port just above the junction of the superior vena cava (SVC) and the RA, single-orifice Sorensen catheters with the orifice tip located either just above the SVC-RA junction or in the mid-RA, and Bunegin-Albin multiorifice catheters with the proximal orifice just above the SVC-RA junction and the distal orifice near the mid-RA. Dogs were then given a predetermined lethal dose of air (5 ml/kg) over 30 sec via the femoral vein. Attempts to aspirate venous air emboli were begun with first decrease in expired CO2. The amounts of air retrieved and the incidence of successful resuscitation were compared. Significantly greater percentages of injected venous air were retrieved with the Bunegin-Albin catheter (60 +/- 7%) than with the Sorenson catheter in the SVC (16 +/- 6%), with the Sorenson catheter in the mid-RA (10 +/- 3%) or with the Swan-Ganz RA port (4 +/- 1%).

At the conclusion of the surgical procedures under halothane/N2O/O2 anesthetics (n = 419), caudal blocks were performed with 0.5 ml/kg of either 0.25% bupivacaine or 0.25% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine injected at a rate of 0.5 ml/sec. The duration of analgesia was noted by parents or nurses who had been instructed how to identify, in a standard manner, the onset of postoperative pain. The mean duration of analgesia was significantly longer in young children (P less than 0.001), in children having penoscrotal operations (P less than 0.001), and when epinephrine was added to bupivacaine (P less than 0.001).

To determine the MAC of isoflurane in preterm neonates, 20 patients less than 32 weeks gestation at birth and 16 patients 32-37 weeks gestation at birth, all less than 1 month post-natal age, were studied. Following tracheal intubation, the neonates were anesthetized with a predetermined end-tidal concentration of isoflurane in oxygen and air. The move-no move responses to skin incision were recorded, and MAC was determined using the \"up-and-down\" technique. Heart rate and systolic arterial pressure were recorded awake, before skin incision, and after skin incision. MAC (mean +/- SD) of isoflurane in preterm neonates less than 32 weeks gestation was 1.28 +/- 0.17%, and MAC in neonates 32-37 weeks gestation was 1.41 +/- 0.18% (P less than 0.05). Although heart rate did not decrease significantly in either group during the study, systolic arterial pressure decreased between 20 and 30% below awake values both before and after skin incision in both age groups (P less than 0.01). We conclude that the MAC of isoflurane in preterm neonates less than 32 weeks gestation is significantly less than that in preterm neonates 32-37 weeks gestation, and that systolic arterial pressure decreases to a similar extent at approximately 1 MAC isoflurane in both age groups.\r"

The authors investigated whether muscle metabolism in eight MHS subjects, at rest and during moderate and heavy short-term exercise, is different then that in normals. Leg exchange of energy substrates (glucose, lactate, and glycerol) was quantified by measuring leg blood flow and arterial-venous concentration differences. Muscle biopsies were also performed, and ATP, glycogen, and lactate were analyzed. Catecholamines and oxygen uptake were also measured. The study was performed at rest with subjects in the supine position and during two periods (40% and 80% of the subjects maximal oxygen uptake, respectively) on a bicycle ergometer. The principal finding of the study was that there was no major difference in oxygen uptake or leg exchange of glucose, lactate, and glycerol between MHS-subjects and previously standard normals during different grades of exercise. Furthermore, muscle metabolites and plasma catecholamines did not differ between the groups. This study indicates a normal sympathetic activity and muscle metabolism in MHS subjects during rest, as well as during moderate and severe exercise. The authors' results do not support the opinion that persons with positive in vitro tests for MH should restrict their physical activity.\r"

Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured with radioactive microspheres, and cerebral oxygen consumption (CMRO2) was calculated from the arterial-sagittal sinus oxygen content difference and CBF measurements. Fentanyl at the highest dose used (200 micrograms/kg and 400 micrograms.kg-1.h-1) depressed the EEG and decreased CBF 49% and CMRO2 39% in young rats, whereas in old rats, this fentanyl dose decreased CBF 37% and CMRO2 34%, both significantly less than in young rats (P less than 0.05). Midazolam at the highest dose used (5.75 mg/kg) also depressed EEG in both age groups, and decreased CBF 51% and CMRO2 38% in young rats. This depression was significantly less than the 62% decrease in CBF and 59% decrease in CMRO2 produced by midazolam in old rats (P less than 0.05). These results indicate that aging attenuates the cerebrovascular and cerebral metabolic depression produced by fentanyl, but potentiates the same effects produced by midazolam. The enhanced cerebral metabolic depression produced by midazolam in the aged is similar to that seen with phenobarbital, and suggests a similar action of these drugs at the central GABA-benzodiazepine-barbiturate receptor complex.\r"

In a first group of seven dogs, studied awake and during halothane (1.2%), enflurane (2.5%), and isoflurane anesthesia (1.6%), verapamil was infused for 30 min in doses calculated to obtain similar plasma concentrations (83 +/- 10, 82 +/- 6, 81 +/- 10, and 77 +/- 9 ng.ml-1, respectively). For the latter purpose, the infusion dose was 3 and 2 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 awake and during anesthesia, respectively, preceded by a loading dose of 200, 150, and 100 micrograms.kg-1, awake, during isoflurane, and halothane and enflurane, respectively. In awake dogs, verapamil induced an increase in heart rate (24 +/- 5 bpm) and PR interval (35 +/- 9 msec) and a decrease in mean arterial pressure (-5 +/- 2 mmHg) and dP/dt (-494 +/- 116 mmHg/s). Although plasma concentrations were similar in awake and in anesthetized dogs, the only statistically significant changes induced by verapamil were an increase in heart rate and a decrease in dP/dt during halothane and enflurane, while left atrial pressure increased only with enflurane. In a second group of six dogs, verapamil pharmacokinetics were determined in the presence and absence of a ganglionic blocking drug (chlorisondamine, 2 mg.kg-1 iv). Blockade of ganglionic transmission resulted in a decrease in both initial volume of distribution and total clearance of verapamil--changes similar to those previously reported with inhalational anesthetics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Interaction between morphine or fentanyl and thiopental on blockade of the righting reflex were both found to be synergistic. The degree of synergism was relatively small for the fentanyl-thiopental combination; the maximal deviation from additive interaction (expected/observed ratio) for ED50 dose level was 1.15 (P less than 0.01). The degree of synergism was greater for the morphine-thiopental combination; the maximal deviation from additive interaction was 2.27 (P less than 0.001). Comparison of the results with the outcomes of opioid-barbiturate interactions in relation to blockade of purposeful movement response to tail clamping, which was antagonistic, shows that the combination of a barbiturate with an opioid gives different outcomes for different end-points of anesthesia. This suggests that the anesthetic effect of an agent is composed of several components, each with a different mechanism of action.\r"

In a total of 2196 of these procedures, the patient received one of the three volatile anesthetics and, in 2010 of these, both the EEG and the CBF were monitored. Chronologically, halothane was the primary agent from 1972-1974; enflurane progressively replaced halothane during 1975-1981; and isoflurane was used almost exclusively since 1982. This analysis confirmed a previous study that the critical CBF during isoflurane anesthesia (703 procedures) was approximately 10 ml X 100 g-1 X min-1, as contrasted to that of approximately 20 ml X 100 g-1 X min-1 during halothane anesthesia (467 procedures). This analysis also established that the critical CBF during enflurane anesthesia (840 procedures) was approximately 15 ml X 100 g-1 X min-1. The incidence of EEG ischemic changes was significantly less (P less than 0.001) during isoflurane anesthesia (18%) than during either enflurane (26%) or halothane (25%) anesthesia. This difference occurred despite the fact that the preoperative risk status was greater in the patients given isoflurane. There was no difference in neurologic outcome between the three anesthetics, and none was expected, since all patients with EEG changes were immediately shunted, if possible.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A combined pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic model of methohexital was used to establish and evaluate feedback control of methohexital anesthesia in 13 volunteers. The median frequency of the EEG power spectrum served as the pharmacodynamic variable constituting feedback. Median frequency values from 2-3 Hz were chosen as the desired EEG level (set-point). In 11 volunteers, the feedback system succeeded in maintaining a satisfactory depth of anesthesia (i.e., unresponsiveness to verbal commands and tactile stimuli). During feedback control, 75% of all measured median frequency values were in the preset range of 2-3 Hz. This distribution of median frequency was obtained by applying random stimulation (six different acoustic and tactile stimuli) to the volunteers approximately every 1.5 min. The decrease of median frequency from baseline to anesthetic values was primarily induced by increasing the fractional power in the frequency band of 0.5-2 Hz from 12.6 +/- 4.5% (mean +/- SD) to 46.0 +/- 2.5%. The median time to recovery (as defined by opening eyes on command) after cessation of the feedback control period was 20.6 min (10.7-44.5 min) when median EEG frequency was 5.2 Hz (4.7-8.4 Hz). The average requirement of methohexital (mean +/- SD) during the 2 h was 1.02 +/- 0.16 g. It is concluded that pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models of intravenous anesthetics established previously may be used to form a suitable background for model-based feedback control of anesthesia by quantitative EEG analysis. This approach gives a possible solution to the problem of adapting pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data to individuals when using population mean data as starting values for drug therapy.\r"

Urinary excretion of fluoride, a product of reductive halothane metabolism, was increased in the 24-h period following anesthesia, but was the same after the first, second, and third anesthetics. Rats killed 24 h after a single anesthetic all had centrilobular hepatocellular necrosis. All animals killed 24 h after the second or third anesthetic also had centrilobular necrosis, but, in most animals, this was no more extensive than that following a single anesthetic, regardless of whether the interval between anesthetics was one or five days.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of halothane on maternal and fetal hemodynamics, distribution of fetal cardiac output, regional cerebral blood flow, and fetal cerebral oxygen consumption were studied in the ewe (N = 9) using radionuclide-labeled microspheres. An adjustable uterine artery occluder was used to produce a controlled state of fetal asphyxia. Measurements were taken during three periods of study: 1) control, 2) asphyxia, and 3) asphyxia plus 15 min of 1% maternal halothane. The fetal cardiovascular response to asphyxia was acidosis, hypoxia, hypertension, bradycardia, and preservation of vital organ blood flows. There was a significant drop in maternal blood pressure when halothane was administered but uterine blood flow was maintained, 308 ml X min-1 during asphyxia versus 275 ml X min-1 with halothane. Fetal blood pressure during asphyxia plus halothane (54 mmHg) was significantly lower than that during asphyxia alone (59 mmHg), while heart rate was significantly higher: 172 beats per minute (bpm) versus 125 bpm (P less than 0.05). Despite these changes, the administration of halothane during asphyxia did not produce a reduction in vital organ flows. Cerebral blood flow was maintained: 357 +/- 37 ml X 100 g-1 X min-1 during asphyxia alone and 344 +/- 26 ml X 100 g-1 X min-1 after halothane administration (P = NS, mean +/- SEM). Cerebral oxygen delivery also was maintained: 8.3 +/- 0.8 ml X 100 g-1 X min-1 during asphyxia alone versus 9.7 +/- 1.5 ml X 100 g-1 X min-1 after halothane, compared with 11.2 +/- 1.1 ml X 100 g-1 X min-1 during the control period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

SR was incubated at 37 degrees C with 45CaCl2 in the control state (no anesthetic) and in the presence of each of the VA from pH 6.6-7.6. The VA used were: halothane, 1.3%; enflurane, 1.8%; and isoflurane, 1.2%. In the control state, the initial rate of calcium uptake, measured after a 2-min incubation, was maximal at pH 6.8 (mean +/- SEM: 665 +/- 37 nmoles/mg) and markedly inhibited at pH 7.6 (107 +/- 9 nmoles/mg). In the presence of the VA, the calcium uptake rate was mildly depressed (7-32%) at pH 6.6-6.8, unchanged at pH 7.0, and greatly enhanced (52-78%) at pH 7.2-7.6, when compared to control. The maximal uptake of calcium by the SR at a calcium concentration of 10(-6)M, measured by a 20-min incubation, had a similar pH dependence in the control state, with a decline first evident at pH 7.2 and a 50% drop in the maximal uptake of calcium from pH 7.0-7.6. The presence of the VA was associated with a uniform depression of the maximal uptake of calcium by the SR at all pH levels measured. In view of these findings, it appears that pH does affect SR function in the presence of VA. This alteration of the pH effect by VA may be a factor responsible for discrepancies in results previously reported by investigators studying the effects of VA on the uptake of calcium by the SR.\r"

The 68 groups comprised a total of 1,326 patients who had served as subjects in 13 of the authors' previously published studies. In general, the results showed that neither pH nor H+ was normally distributed; most of the pH distributions (47 of 68 = 69%) and most of the H+ distributions (53 of 68 = 78%) showed significant departure from the normal distribution. Moreover, the shapes of the distributions varied, depending upon the conditions under which gastric acidity was assessed. Groups receiving no medication for gastric acidity had positively skewed pH distributions (nonsymmetrical distribution with tail pointing to right and majority of cases in lower range), and groups receiving medications for the reduction of acidity had negatively skewed pH distributions (nonsymmetrical with tail pointing to left and majority of cases in upper range). The medications produced an inverse relationship between mean pH and skewness such that the skewness of the groups decreased from positive to negative as mean pH increased. For H+, all groups had positively skewed distributions, but the distributions were more positively skewed for groups receiving medications for gastric acidity. Again, the medication conditions produced an inverse relationship between mean acidity and skewness such that the groups became more positively skewed as the mean H+ decreased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The following parameters were studied without and with exposure to cold conditions: hemodynamics (finger photoplethysmography), red cell deformability (filtration test), various clotting variables (prothrombin activity, antithrombin III, plasma fibrinogen, partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, thrombelastogram), and clinical symptomatology. After treatment 7 of the 11 patients showed a distinct improvement of peripheral blood flow and of symptoms (decrease or removal of asphyxia attacks, pain, color change) under basal conditions, as well as after exposure to cold. Red cell filtration was significantly (p less than 0.05) improved, increasing by 35% under normal conditions and by 30% after exposure to cold. Positive changes were also found in respect to antithrombin III (increase) and plasma fibrinogen (decrease). The thrombelastogram was unchanged. Clinical and instrumental improvements were probably ascribable to better microcirculatory flow due to increased red cell deformability, reduced viscosity, and decreased fibrinogen, all capable of influencing in various degrees the blood flow at the microcirculatory level.\r"

To assess the prevalence of abnormal humoral immune parameters in bronchiectasis, a retrospective study was carried out on sera from 30 patients. Studies included immunoglobulin quantitation and specific antibody to fungal species. Eleven patients were found to have immunodeficiency (nine with panhypoglobulinemia and two with selective IgM deficiency). Six patients had elevations of serum IgA and four patients had elevations of serum IgE. Six patients had elevated total antibody to Aspergillus or Candida species and six had precipitin bands to one or more fungal antigens. This study indicates that immunodeficiency is prevalent and plays a causative role in some patients with bronchiectasis. Hypersensitivity reactions to Aspergillus, Candida, and other ubiquitous environmental fungi may also play an etiopathogenic role in this disease (bronchiectasis, humoral immunity, immunodeficiency).\r"

Recently, these kits have been modified by the substitution of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detection system (Phadezym PRIST/RAST). We studied the performance characteristics of Phadezym PRIST and RAST kits. Phadezym PRIST was sensitive to 0.5 IU/mL IgE. Reproducibility was excellent in the range of 5 to 200 IU/mL IgE and adequate in the range of 5 to 1000 IU/mL using 1:10 serum dilutions (average inter-assay coefficient of variation = 19%). Phadezym RAST was specific, but sensitivity was limited by absorbances in the RAST class 1/0 range indistinguishable from background values. Average inter-assay coefficient of variation was 29% for the semi-quantitative 'Phadezym RAST Unit' (PRU) reporting system. We modified the test kit procedure by disc incubations in microtiter plate wells with rotational agitation and use of ELISA-dedicated spectrophotometer and computer software. These microplate accelerated computerized assays ('MacPRIST' and 'MacRAST') were shown to perform similarly to the conventional Phadezym procedures with advantages in speed, ease, and handling of data.\r"

  ".W": "The diving reflex is a complex cardiovascular-respiratory response to immersion. This multireflex response in animals consists of apnea; bradycardia (the experimental parameter most often measured); peripheral vasoconstriction (resulting in preferential perfusion of the brain and heart); decreased cardiac output (with a maintained or increased stroke volume); and an increase in mean arterial blood pressure. These cardiovascular alterations act in a manner that conserves oxygen for the heart and brain. Because alcohol is often involved in water accidents with associated submersions, these initial experiments dealt with human volunteers who consumed alcohol to a blood level of 0.1 g% (legal level of intoxication). The diving reflex was elicited before and after alcohol consumption. Heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac output were measured before, during, and after face immersion in 4 C water. In the sober state, immersion decreased heart rate, increased stroke volume, increased blood pressure, and increased total peripheral resistance. In comparison to the sober state, alcohol consumption increased pre-immersion heart rate, but did not significantly alter pre-immersion blood pressure or stroke volume. Following alcohol consumption, facial immersion decreased heart rate, but not to the same low rate as in the sober state. Alcohol consumption also evoked a lesser increase in blood pressure and failed to increase stroke volume significantly.\r"

In addition, there was a frequency of 8 to 10 Hz associated with each low-frequency amplitude modulation. EMG signals from postoperative patients revealed none of the major patterns seen in thermal-induced shivering. Cold-induced vasodilation also was studied and found to occur simultaneously in all cold-stressed fingers regardless of size or innervation. Thermal shivering and cold-induced vasodilation are considered to be manifestations of central neural oscillators.\r"

Data were collected from 13 emergency departments, with 401 of the 428 cases presenting during a two-year study period. Core temperatures ranged from 35 C to 15.6 C (mean, 30.57 C +/- 3.53) with 272 cases (63.6%) less than or equal to 32.2 C. There were no significant differences by age in presenting temperature, rewarming strategies, or mortality. The first hour rewarming rate was significantly (P less than .05) faster in the population less than or equal to 59 years (1.08 +/- 1.39 C/hr) than in those greater than or equal to 60 years (0.75 +/- 1.16 C/hr). Male core temperatures averaged 30.27 +/- 3.44 C versus female temperatures of 31.1 +/- 3.61 C. There were no clinically significant differences in male (N = 296) versus female (N = 132) profiles. High ethanol levels (315 to 800 mg%) did not affect outcome. Nine of 27 (33%) patients who received CPR initiated in the field survived, versus six of 14 (43%) with CPR begun in the ED. The profile of the CPR versus non-CPR population differed significantly (P less than .05) in location (outdoors), initial temperature (24.8 +/- 3.77 C vs 30.94 +/- 3.12 C), third-hour rewarming rate (2.28 +/- 1.53 C vs 1.17 +/- 1.18 C/hr), and numerous laboratory parameters. Tracheal intubation was performed without incident in 117 cases, of which 97 were less than or equal to 32.2 C. There were 73 fatalities (17.1%). Of these, 84.9% (N = 62) were less than or equal to 32.2 C. Predisposing conditions in this group included \"serious\" illness (30), systemic infection (28), trauma (15), immersion (ten), frostbite (seven), and overdose (two). The initial pulse, hemoglobin, and first-hour rewarming rate was lower in the deceased population, while the potassium, urea nitrogen, creatinine, and phosphorus were elevated. Excluding treatment combinations, outcome with exclusive use of a single rewarming strategy was passive external rewarming, 14 deaths below 32.2 C, 13 above; active external rewarming, six deaths below 32.2 C, two above; active core rewarming, 38 deaths below 32.2 C, none above. Refinements of the American Heart Association's CPR standards in hypothermia and a Hypothermia Survival Index are proposed.\r"

Survival was measured by planimetry for all groups. No tissue survival was evident in the frostbite control group. Methimazole treatment allowed 34.3% survival, Aloe vera 28.2% survival, aspirin 22.5% survival, and methylprednisolone 17.5% survival. The data compare the results of a modified frostbite protocol using ibuprofen with therapeutic modalities used by other clinical services. Of 154 patients treated for frostbite from 1982 to 1985, 56 were treated with our frostbite protocol; 98 were treated with other modalities. Of the 56 protocol patients, 18 suffered 1st degree frostbite, 25, 2nd degree frostbite, and 13, 3rd degree frostbite. For all degrees of frostbite, 67.9% healed without tissue loss, 25.0% healed with partial tissue loss, and 7% required amputation (P less than .001). Of the patients not on protocol, 11 suffered 1st degree frostbite, 51, 2nd degree frostbite, and 36, 3rd degree frostbite. Of these, 32.7% healed without tissue loss, 34.6% healed with tissue loss, and 32.7% required amputation. The morbidity of progressive dermal ischemia in frostbite may be decreased by the therapeutic use of inhibitors of the arachidonic acid cascade.\r"

Supplemental care is provided by disaster relief forces; this care should be adapted to prevalent types of injuries. Most care should be provided at the disaster scene through supplemental medical facilities, while some can be provided by evacuating patients to distant hospitals. Medical response teams capable of stabilizing, sorting, and holding victims should staff supplemental medical facilities.

Research in the early 1980s demonstrated that immunosorbent affinity chromatography could purify a highly specific IgG(T) from equine hyperimmune antisera. This IgG(T) provided superior efficacy and reduced adverse effects as compared to commercial antivenin. The advent of newer biotechnical processes has now opened the doors for novel antibody and antibody fragment treatment of snake venom poisoning.\r"

Because aggressive gastroenteric decontamination can reduce the extent of hepatic damage, it is important to attempt to determine during this asymptomatic period whether amatoxin exposure has occurred. Various laboratory methods that might be useful are reviewed.\r"

The purpose of this study was to examine the diagnoses other than ARD on the discharge record of patients hospitalized with ARD. We were particularly interested in determining the frequency of high-risk conditions for which influenza vaccine is currently recommended. The risk for ARD hospitalization was 19.7 per ten thousand for persons with high-risk conditions and only 9.3 for persons without. Chronic pulmonary disorders were the most common underlying conditions identified, and persons with pulmonary conditions had the greatest risk for ARD hospitalization. The highest rate occurred among persons older than 65 yr of age with pulmonary conditions (87.5 per ten thousand), and the rate was 27.5 for persons 45 to 64 yr of age. Cardiac conditions were the second most frequent group of underlying disorders of patients hospitalized with ARD. Only for persons younger than 20 yr of age was the risk of ARD hospitalization greater for persons with cardiac conditions than for those with pulmonary conditions (22.9 and 14.9 per ten thousand, respectively). Death, however, was more frequent among persons with underlying heart disease. Intensified effort is needed to fully implement recommendations for prophylaxis of influenza in order to reduce these risks.\r"

No fatal cases or serious complications were registered. Compromised hosts did not appear to be overrepresented in the material, nor did patients with impaired immune responses seem to be more seriously ill. Laboratory findings indicated that the RS virus pneumonia in adults was in some cases due to a mixed bacterial and RS virus infection, but in a few cases it was caused by the RS virus alone. Positive epidemiologic findings were found only in a few cases. The length of the period between the seasonal peak incidences of RS virus infection varied. A tendency to recurrent long and short intervals between the peak incidences was observed. An IgM antibody response to RS virus was common, and IgM detection was found to be a useful complement in the diagnosis of RS virus disease.\r"

To evaluate the usefulness of PSB and PTBNA in establishing the etiology of pneumonia, we prospectively studied 20 patients with acute bacterial pneumonia not receiving antibiotics. After informed consent, patients had fiberoptic bronchoscopy under fluoroscopy to localize the pneumonia, and specimens were obtained by the PSB. The protective plug of a specially devised needle for PTBNA was pneumatically dislodged and aspiration was performed within the infiltrate under fluoroscopy. Quantitative cultures were plated immediately for aerobes, anaerobes, and Legionella. Greater than 4 X 10(3) organisms/brush or 1 X 10(4) organisms/ml needle aspirate were considered to be consistent with infection. The results using PSB and PTBNA were compared in 15 of 20 patients in whom a definitive diagnosis (positive blood or pleural fluid culture) or presumptive diagnosis (expectorated sputum culture, clinical characteristics, and response to specific therapy) was established. The PSB and PTBNA cultures on uninfected control subjects (n = 5) being bronchoscoped for other reasons were negative. The PSB and PTBNA were each diagnostic in 2 of the 5 patients with definitive diagnoses. In the group with a presumptive diagnosis (n = 10), PSB was diagnostic in 7 of 10 and PTBNA in 9 of 10. The overall (definitive plus presumptive) diagnostic yield was 60% for PSB and 73% for PTBNA. Multiple organisms were isolated in high concentrations in 53% of the patients. The most common organisms recovered in addition to the primary pathogen was alpha hemolytic streptococci.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We investigated the interrelationship between heat exchange, exercise intensity and EIA. In order to differentiate between the effects of RHL and exercise intensity, we arranged for tests to be performed with the same RHL, but with different intensities of exercise and inspired air conditions. Each of 8 asthmatic children exercised twice in random order for 6 min on a cycle ergometer. One test consisted of exercise performed at a greater level of effort while breathing room air, mean (+/- SE) air conditions being 25.0 +/- 0.4 degrees C and 15.7 +/- 0.2 mg H2O/L. The other test was performed at a lesser level of effort while breathing cold (0.0 +/- 0.5 degrees C) and dry air (O mg H2O/L). The mean ratio of minute ventilations in the 2 exercise tests was 1.78 +/- 0.03, but the RHL was similar in both tests. The EIA after the exercise at the greater level was more severe than after the lesser level, the percent fall in FEV2 from baseline being 36 +/- 7% and 21 +/- 5%, respectively (p less than 0.025). We conclude that the exercise level has a major role in determining the severity of EIA and that climatic conditions act as modifying factors.\r"

A bronchoscope was wedged in situ into perfused lower lobes of anesthetized dogs. Through the bronchoscope, dry air was delivered, resistance to collateral flow (Rcs) was measured, and airway wall temperature (Taw) was monitored. A dry-air challenge through the bronchoscope produced a fall in Taw and a rise in Rcs, presumably related to evaporative heat loss (EHL) and/or an increase in osmolarity. By changing the temperature of blood perfusing the lobe it was possible to lower Taw without affecting either EHL or osmolarity. Four series of experiments were performed. In the first series, Taw was lowered in 2 ways: by increasing dry air flow and by cooling the pulmonary perfusate. After a 2-min challenge with dry air, Rcs rose. After lowering Taw with cooled blood for 2 min, Rcs did not rise. In the second series of studies, Taw was lowered for 15-min periods by reducing the temperature of blood. Neither cooling per se nor rewarming after the 15 min of cooling initiated increases in lung tone. In the third series of experiments, a 2-min dry air challenge was performed while the lobe was perfused with cool blood. Despite greater reductions in Taw during the dry-air challenge, responses after the challenge were virtually abolished. In a final series of experiments in which pulmonary perfusion was stopped during challenge, airway cooling was enhanced, and responses were again significantly attenuated. Thus, cooling actually depressed increases in Rcs produced by dry-air challenge.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The asthmatics were lavaged twice. On the first occasion, they inhaled the diluent control (Dil) solution, and after an interval of at least 7 days, allergen (Ag) inhalational challenge was undertaken. Significant differences were observed in the single early responders (SER) only. For instance, when the results obtained on the Dil day were compared with those obtained on the Ag day, there was a significant (p less than 0.05) increase in the percentage of OKT4 cells in the blood of SER. Also in the BAL of SER there was a significant (p less than 0.05) decrease in the percentage of OKT4 and an increase (p less than 0.05) in the percentage and absolute numbers of OKT8 cells. Furthermore, the percentage of OKT4 was highly significantly (p less than 0.005) lower on the Ag day in the SER than on the Ag day in the late-phase responders (LPR). The OKT4/OKT8 ratio was significantly (p less than 0.05) lower on the Ag day than on the Dil day in BAL from SER and highly significantly decreased (p less than 0.001) when results on the Ag day in the SER were compared with those on the Ag day in the LPR. These findings raise the possibility that mobilization of suppressor T-cells into the lung after allergen-induced single early reactions in asthma might be associated with the prevention of a subsequent late-phase response.\r"

We used a recent modification of the multiple inert gas elimination technique allowing frequent serial studies without the need for sampling arterial blood. The VA/Q inequality was expressed as log SD (the second moment) of the distributions of blood flow (Q) and ventilation (V) on a log scale. Log SDQ averaged 0.74, and in every patient log SDQ exceeded the 95% upper limit of normal (0.60) in 2 wk or more. In only 5 patients was mean log SDQ less than 0.6. The ventilation distribution was less abnormal, with mean log SDV exceeding the 95% normal upper limit in only 4 patients. Bimodal blood-flow distributions containing low VA/Q units were observed at some point in 24 of 26 subjects, but occurrence was variable, and in only one third of all measurements was bimodality found. Analysis of variance showed that 70 to 75% of the total variance of log SD was due to intersubject differences, about 20% was due to random changes over time, and the remaining 7 to 9% was not explained by either and was due mostly to experimental error. Arterial PO2 measured 3 times in each subject was inversely related to log SDQ (r = 0.76), but only 60% of the variance in PaO2 was explained by VA/Q mismatch, the rest being due presumably to variation in mixed venous PO2 and similar extrapulmonary factors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this work was to determine whether the nonadrenergic, noncholinergic, inhibitory nervous system can be reflexly activated in humans by laryngeal stimulation. The stimulation was achieved with a cytology brush passed through a bronchoscope previously introduced transnasally and positioned just above the epiglottis. In one series of experiments, subjects were premedicated with beta-adrenergic and cholinergic blockers, and bronchoconstriction was induced by histamine inhalation. The results showed that mechanical irritation of the vocal cords with the cytology brush produced a sharp, short-lasting (less than 1 min) decrease in RL from (mean +/- SE) 6.8 +/- 2.1 to 4.8 +/- 1.5 cm H2O.L-1.s, and in the absence of parasympathetic blockade, laryngeal irritation produced a fall in RL from (mean +/- SE) 9.0 +/- 3.7 to 5.4 +/- 2.0 cm H2O.L-1.s (p less than 0.0001) (ANOVA). This decrease in RL was independent of the slight cough produced by laryngeal stimulation and reflects a change in lower and not upper airway resistance. Adequacy of the beta-adrenergic and cholinergic blockade was checked with an intravenous infusion of isoproterenol and inhaled methacholine, respectively. In 2 subjects, the fall in RL was abolished by a block of the superior laryngeal nerves and direct local anesthesia of the vocal cords. We conclude that mechanical irritation of the larynx produces a partial reversal of histamine-induced bronchoconstriction that is mediated through nervous pathways that are neither beta-adrenergic nor cholinergic in origin. We suggest that this decrease in bronchoconstriction is modulated by the nonadrenergic, noncholinergic, inhibitory nervous system.\r"

  ".W": "Although anatomic and physiologic abnormalities of the upper airway are thought to be important in the pathogenesis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the relative contributions of these factors have not been elucidated. We therefore measured pharyngeal cross-sectional area (PCSA) and pharyngeal air-flow resistance (Rp) in 12 overweight men with severe symptomatic OSA (mean apnea plus hypopnea index [AHI], 66.9 +/- 6.0 events per hour) and in 17 age- and weight-matched control subjects without spontaneous complaints of OSA symptoms (mean AHI, 4.9 +/- 1.6 events per hour). During wakefulness, PCSA was assessed during breath cessation at FRC by computed tomography (CT) and Rp by measuring inspiratory air-flow resistance between the choanae and epiglottis. No measure of PCSA differed significantly between patients and control subjects, and only 1 measure of PCSA, minimal pharyngeal area, correlated with AHI in all subjects (r = -0.38, p less than 0.05). In contrast, Rp was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) in patients (6.9 +/- 1.0 cm H2O/L/s) than in all control subjects (4.2 +/- 0.5 cm H2O/L/s) and correlated significantly with AHI (r = 0.53, p less than 0.01). We conclude that increased inspiratory resistance to air flow in the naso-oropharynx is present during wakefulness in overweight men with OSA, when compared with matched control subjects without symptomatic OSA, and is associated with disordered breathing during sleep. This occurs even though computed tomography is unable to demonstrate that pharyngeal size during wakefulness at FRC is significantly different between patients and control subjects. These observations suggest that the ability to dilate the pharynx during inspiration may be defective in patients with OSA.\r"

  ".U": "87324466\r", 
  ".W": "The mechanisms responsible for hypoventilation during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep in patients with diaphragmatic weakness are not clear. Therefore, we studied the effects of unilateral (UDP) and bilateral (BDP) diaphragmatic paralysis on ventilation during wakefulness (W), slow-wave sleep (SWS), and REM sleep. Studies were performed in 3 trained dogs in which small silicone cuffs had been implanted surgically around the phrenic nerves. Reversible diaphragmatic paralysis was induced during wakefulness or sleep by bathing the phrenic nerves in local anesthetic injected through a catheter attached to the phrenic cuffs. The UDP reduced abdominal expansion and increased rib cage expansion, but had no effect on minute volume of ventilation (VI) or end-tidal PCO2 (PACO2). The BDP produced marked abdominal paradox, but did not reduce VI during W or SWS and had no effect on tidal volume or respiratory frequency. In contrast, during REM sleep, VI was decreased by an average of 21% mainly because of a fall in tidal volume, and PACO2 increased by 2.4 mm Hg compared with that during the intact state. Furthermore, addition of extra dead space to the breathing circuit, which was well tolerated in intact dogs, led to a progressive increase in PACO2 during BDP and to arousal from sleep. The findings indicate that acute BDP does not impair ventilation during quiet W or SWS, but reduces ventilation during REM sleep, supporting the concept that during REM sleep maintenance of ventilation is critically dependent on diaphragmatic compensation for intercostal and accessory muscle inhibition.\r"

These subjects had developed clinically significant airway obstruction during this period of follow-up. Clinical evaluation was not successful in characterizing the nature of the disorder. None of the subjects had alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. In a small proportion of subjects, elevated total serum immunoglobulin E may have played a role in the obstructive airway disorder. Some subjects exhibited loss of lung elastic recoil and diminished carbon monoxide diffusing capacity suggestive of developing emphysema. Others appeared to have intrinsic airway disease involving large and/or small airways, which may be fixed in some and responsive to bronchodilator in others. Thus, neither the site nor the nature of the disorder inferred from results of physiologic tests was uniform, illustrating the heterogeneous nature of chronic obstructive lung disease.\r"

In the present study, we evaluated the effects of hyperoxia for 5 to 6 days in 8 baboons to compare changes in abnormalities in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) biochemical markers, hemodynamic measurements, and pulmonary function tests in order to find early predictors of lung injury. All animals had bilateral alveolar infiltrates, severe hypoxemia, and progressive deterioration of pulmonary function tests. Diffuse alveolar damage and mild-moderate pneumonias were found and were associated with low-grade bacterial infection. Total lung capacity, diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, pulmonary static compliance, and oxygenation were significantly impaired after Day 5; BALF proteins, elastase, and total polymorphonuclear leukocytes increased significantly at least 24 h before (Day 4) any abnormalities in chest radiographs, pulmonary function tests, and hemodynamic measurements were detected. We conclude that exposure to 100% oxygen in this model causes marked gas exchange, hemodynamic, biochemical, cytologic, radiographic, and pathologic changes similar to those noted in patients with ARDS. Bronchoalveolar lavage abnormalities precede hemodynamic and gas exchange abnormalities.\r"

  ".W": "Uncertainty persists concerning the mechanisms responsible for fluid clearance from the lungs after the air spaces become flooded in severe pulmonary edema. In this study, solute and water fluxes were investigated in an isolated, fluid-filled, perfused rabbit lung preparation. These lungs were perfused with physiologic 1.0 or 5.0 g/dl albumin solutions, and the air spaces were flushed and filled with the same solutions. Samples were obtained at intervals from the perfusate, and at the end of 1 or 2 h, fluid was pumped from the trachea into collection tubes. Concentrations of albumin (labeled with Evans blue) in the air space increased by 2.4 +/- 0.7% (SEM) at 1 h and by 7.0 +/- 0.8% at 2 h. Approximately half of the increase at 2 h could be attributed to dehydration (as judged by increases in perfusate and air-space Na+ concentration). Because previous studies have indicated that the movement of labeled protein between these compartments is very slow in this preparation, it can be concluded that fluid is being reabsorbed from the air spaces. However, reabsorption appears to be slower in rabbits than in rats and it is not stimulated by terbutaline, an effect observed in other species. Under control conditions, potassium concentrations in the air-space fluid fell from 4.01 +/- 0.05 (SEM) mEq/L to 3.37 +/- 0.14 mEq/L at 1 h. Concentrations of K+ in the perfusate rose during this interval from 3.95 +/- 0.05 mEq/L to 4.39 +/- 0.08 mEq/L.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have recently described large numbers of pulmonary intravascular macrophages in several ruminant species that also remove inert particles from the bloodstream. To determine the role of these cells in removal of bacteria from the bloodstream, sheep and rats were injected intravenously with a single dose of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and kinetics of clearance, relative uptake among organs, and morphologic changes in the lungs and liver 1 h after injection were compared. In rats, bacteria were removed primarily by the liver, and pathologic changes were found in hepatic sinusoids but not in the lungs. However, in sheep, bacteria were removed primarily by the lungs, and pulmonary capillaries became filled with neutrophils, platelets, and fibrin deposits. We propose that uptake of bacteria by pulmonary intravascular macrophages and subsequent release of inflammatory mediators are central to the pathologic changes produced in ruminant models of sepsis-induced adult respiratory distress syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "A series of studies was performed in which Syrian golden hamsters were injected intratracheally with 25 to 200 micrograms of highly purified human C5 or the 200,000 molecular weight form of trypsin-activated C5 (C5'). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed 4 h after intratracheal injection, the recovered white cells were counted and differentiated, and the BAL fluid was assayed for in vitro neutrophil chemotactic activity. A significant increase in BAL neutrophils and total BAL cell numbers was evident at 4 h after C5' instillation. In contrast, highly purified native C5 induced no evidence of pulmonary inflammation, even at the highest injection doses studied. Kinetic experiments indicated that hamsters receiving an intratracheal injection of 60 micrograms of C5' per animal demonstrated rapid pulmonary neutrophil infiltration that persisted for 120 to 168 h. Control hamsters receiving intratracheal injections of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or 60 micrograms of highly purified C5 did not demonstrate significant neutrophil infiltration. Lung pathology studies revealed neutrophilic alveolitis with intraalveolar and intracapillary neutrophil infiltration in the C5'-treated animals. The BAL fluid obtained from C5'-treated, but not from C5-treated or control hamsters, contained chemotactic factors for neutrophils, which appeared to be unrelated to C5. From these studies we conclude that C5', the 200,000 molecular weight form of protease-activated C5, is capable of mediating an acute inflammatory response in the hamster lung in vivo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A control group of 6 dogs received saline treatments. Hemodynamic measurements were performed during normoxic and hypoxic (10% oxygen) ventilation approximately 3 and 6 months after treatment. Baseline hemodynamic parameters were comparable in both groups and were unchanged at 6 months in the control group. In the papain-treated group at 6 months, there were significant reductions in PaO2 (95 +/- 4 to 79 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.005) and increases in mean pulmonary artery pressure (12 +/- 1 to 18 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) and pulmonary vascular resistance (2.0 +/- 0.3 to 6.2 +/- 2.1 units, p less than 0.01). Morphometric evaluation demonstrated increased medial thickness in muscular pulmonary arteries less than 50 mu in size. Morphologic evaluation confirmed the presence of panlobular emphysema with papain administration. We conclude that chronic emphysema produced in dogs by aerosol administration of papain results in elevated pulmonary artery pressure, which is characterized pathologically by medial hypertrophy of small pulmonary arteries. This model appears suitable for further study of the pathogenesis of pulmonary vascular disease associated with chronic lung disease.\r"

  ".W": "We correlated respiratory system mechanics measured by passive exhalation technique with pulmonary mechanics assessed by esophageal balloon technique to determine the ability of each to detect histamine-aerosol-induced changes in conductance and compliance. Eight beagle pups were anesthetized with chloralose and mechanically ventilated 6 times over a 2-wk period of an acute canine parainfluenza II infection. Measurements of respiratory mechanics were obtained by both methods after aerosol challenge with 5 breaths of saline and after each of 9 increasing doses of histamine. Pulmonary conductance and static compliance of the lung were measured by the esophageal balloon method. The rate constant of the respiratory system was calculated by computer-assisted analysis of passive exhalation. Static compliance of the respiratory system was measured after 2 s of apnea, and conductance of the respiratory system was calculated as compliance multiplied by rate constant. Paired data were obtained on 349 measurements. As expected, both conductance and compliance decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) after histamine aerosol challenge by both techniques. Rate constant did not change significantly by either method. The 2 techniques were highly correlated (p less than 0.001) for conductance (r = 0.76), compliance (r = 0.94), and rate constant (r = 0.66). We conclude that analysis of respiratory mechanics using the passive exhalation method correlates well with esophageal balloon data. Furthermore, passive exhalation techniques are technically simple and can detect changes in respiratory mechanics associated with histamine challenges.\r"

This is also the first reported case of pulmonary edema complicating distance running in which hemodynamic measurements have been made. The pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was low. The cardiac index was initially depressed, and the arterial-venous oxygen tension difference was high, but the latter abnormalities disappeared after volume infusion. These hemodynamic data suggest that pulmonary edema in this distance runner was predominantly noncardiogenic. The etiology of the edema is uncertain, but concurrent hyponatremia and cerebral edema were present in this patient, as in 2 previously reported cases, suggesting that neurogenic pulmonary edema caused by water intoxication may be a contributing factor in pathogenesis.\r"

Above-knee bypasses were performed in 181 patients: 77 were taking ASA and DIP at the time of operation, 41 were placed on postoperative \"low-dose\" warfarin, whereas 63 did not receive adjunctive medications. Late patency demonstrated no significant difference among the groups based on graft material used (SV 71%, UV 68%, PTFE 66%, and Dacron 65%) (P less than .25). Below-knee femoro-popliteal bypasses were performed in 183 patients: 82 were taking ASA and DIP at the time of operation, 40 were placed on warfarin postoperatively and no medications were given to 41 patients. Late patency rates (39 months) demonstrated that SV (62%) was superior to UV (51%), PTFE (30%), and Dacron (18%) (P less than .01). Femorotibial-peroneal bypasses were done in 42 patients: 13 patients were taking ASA and DIP at operation, 21 were placed on warfarin postoperatively and 8 received no medication. SV late patency (33 months) was again superior (43%) to UV (31%); no PTFE or Dacron grafts functioned after 24 months. Patients who took warfarin and ASA had the best early (16 months) patency results. Above-knee prosthetic grafts achieved late patency rates similar to SV while reducing operative time, shortening recuperation, and sparing the saphenous vein for use in the coronary or infrapopliteal vessels. In below-knee bypasses SV was superior to prosthetic grafts, with or without the use of ASA and DIP or warfarin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Reversed saphenous vein was used in 16 (47%) bypasses and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in 18 (53%) bypasses. The mean ankle pressure index prior to the bypass was 0.40 and the post-operative mean ankle pressure index was 0.86. The arterial bypasses remained patent from 1 month to 47 months (mean, 17.7 months). The reversed saphenous vein remained patent for a mean period of 21.3 months and the PTFE for a mean period of 10.6 months. This difference was statistically significant (P greater than .01). After occlusion of the bypasses, arteriography was performed. The postocclusion arteriography was compared with the pre-bypass arteriography. There was significant progression of arterial disease to account for the failure of bypasses in the inflow arteries in three (8.8%) patients and in the arteries distal to the bypasses in 23 (67.6%) patients. Eight patients showed no significant changes in the postocclusive arteriography. In this series of 33 patients with 34 infrainguinal bypasses, 76.5 per cent of the patients developed progression of the arterial disease causing failure of the bypasses.

  ".W": "Three hundred patients without neurologic symptoms had 374 elective peripheral vascular procedures and they were screened preoperatively for incidental asymptomatic carotid bruits prior to surgery. The bruits were hemodynamically evaluated with the GEE-OPG. A bruit was considered hemodynamically significant if the OPG test was positive. Seventy-four patients (24.7%, 74/300) were found to have 118 carotid bruits. Twenty-five (22.3%, 25/112) of the 112 bruits with OPG studies were hemodynamically significant. There were three perioperative strokes that occurred for an incidence of 0.8 per cent (3/374). There was no stroke in patients without bruits and with nonhemodynamically significant bruits. The incidence of perioperative stroke in patients with hemodynamically significant bruits was 16 per cent (3/19). There is a subgroup of patients with hemodynamically significant carotid bruits who are at high risk for perioperative stroke.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred seventeen diabetic patients with lesions involving 174 extremities were reviewed to evaluate the natural history of the problem and specifically those factors that influence its course both acutely and chronically. The extremities of diabetic patients with foot lesions can be categorized based on severity of infection and presence of ischemia. Half of these patients developed lesions in the contralateral extremity either concurrently (synchronous) (7%) or later (metachronous) (43%). Major amputation was required in 59 of the 174 extremities evaluated (34%). In patients with metachronous lesions, unilateral amputations were required in 28 per cent of patients and bilateral amputations in 26 per cent. Limb salvage by revascularization required 1.4 operations per extremity, carried 2 per cent operative mortality and was successful in 66 per cent. Although 24 per cent of these patients died within 5 years of the initial presentation of their foot lesions, these data suggest that limb salvage attempts are reasonably successful and relatively safe. The combination of extremity sepsis and ischemia in the diabetic adversely effects the survival of both the extremity and the patient.\r"

  ".W": "As the population receiving radiation therapy grows, so does the incidence of chronic radiation enteritis. A review of the pathology of chronic radiation enteritis reveals fibrosis, endarteritis, edema, fragility, perforation, and partial obstruction. Conservative management of patients with this disease is common. Because the obstruction is only partial, decompression is easily achieved with nasogastric suction and parenteral support. The patient is then often discharged on a liquid-to-soft diet. This therapeutic strategy does nothing for the underlying pathology. The problem, sooner or later, will return with the patient further depleted by the chronic radiation enteritis. We think surgical intervention is appropriate when the diagnosis of chronic radiation enteritis is assumed. The surgery in relation to this disease is high risk with a 30% mortality and 100% expensive morbidity. Early intervention seems to decrease these figures. All anastomoses, if possible, should be outside the irradiated area. Trapped pelvic loops of intestine should be left in place and a bypass procedure with decompressing enterostomies accomplished. The surgery should be performed by a surgeon with extensive experience with all kinds of bowel obstruction as well as experience in performing surgery in radiated tissue.\r"

This study reports experience with apudomas over an 8-year period (1975-1983) at The Piedmont Hospital. There were 159 tumors with the potential for producing various ectopic hormones as well as biologically active amines, including 112 oat cell carcinomas, 37 carcinoid tumors, 4 paragangliomas, 2 pancreatic islet cell tumors, 2 medullary thyroid carcinomas, 1 pituitary adenoma, and 1 pinealocytoma. Of the 112 oat cell carcinomas, only 2 per cent had hormone-related symptoms. Of the carcinoid tumors, 12 were found in the appendix, 9 in the small intestine, 9 in the lungs, 4 in the colon and 2 in the rectum. Nineteen of the 37 carcinoids had hormone-related symptoms but none had a classic carcinoid syndrome. A third group of apudomas included several of relative rarity, the paragangliomas, the medullary thyroid carcinomas, the pancreatic islet cell tumors, pituitary adenomas, and pinealocytomas. Of this latter group, only the pancreatic islet cell tumors had symptomatology that could be related to ectopic hormone production.\r"

Most common clinical features included right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, a palpable RUQ mass and early postprandial satiety. Liver function studies were uniformly normal. Ultrasound and computerized tomography CT were virtually diagnostic alone or in combination. Eight patients had unilocular, simple cysts and two patients had multilocular complex cysts also designated as biliary cystadenomas. Cysts recurred in four patients treated surgically by needle aspiration, incision, and internal drainage or external catheter drainage. All four patients required reoperation, which included hepatic lobectomy in three patients and extensive unroofing in one patient. No cysts have recurred in six patients treated by extensive unroofing or excision of the cyst and none has required reoperation. One patient who underwent hepatic lobectomy for cyst recurrence after an inadequate primary procedure was found to have an unsuspected carcinoma in the cyst wall. The conclusion is that extensive unroofing of unilocular solitary hepatic cysts minimizes the likelihood of cyst recurrence and obviates the need for hepatic resection. Total cyst excision is indicated for all multiloculated cysts to avoid overlooking a biliary cystadenoma or for unilocular cysts if the biopsy specimen of the cyst wall demonstrates an unsuspected neoplasm.\r"

This study reviews 77 patients with thermal injuries to determine total body surface area (BSA) burned, and white blood cell count (WBC) at time of hospital admission. A subpopulation of 56 patients with serial WBC counts were evaluated to determine lowest WBC count, topical burn therapy, episodes of infection or septic shock and final outcome. There was not a significant incidence of leukopenia on admission. Fifty-six per cent of patients treated with SSD and 12 per cent of silver nitrate-treated patients became leukopenic (P less than .05). The leukopenia was higher among SSD-treated patients who had greater than 15 per cent BSA burns (P less than .05). The onset of leukopenia generally occurred the second day after the burn and the WBC count returned to normal with discontinuance of the drug. The leukopenia was due primarily to a marked decrease in the number of mature neutrophils. There was no difference in the incidence of septic complications or opportunistic infections in the treatment groups. There was no significant difference in final outcome. Silver sulfadiazine-induced leukopenia appears to be a self-limited phenomenon that does not increase the incidence of infectious complications nor affect final outcome.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the effect of 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (desmopressin) on blood loss in surgery, we conducted a randomized, double-blind trial of the drug in 35 patients with normal hemostatic function who were having spinal fusion with Harrington rod instrumentation. Seventeen patients were designated to receive 10 micrograms/m2 of desmopressin, and 18, to receive a placebo. Preoperative testing showed that desmopressin increased factor VIII coagulant activity, von Willebrand antigen concentrations, glass bead platelet retention, and prothrombin consumption and decreased the partial thromboplastin and bleeding times (p less than or equal to 0.0003). During surgery, desmopressin reduced blood loss by 32.5% (547 mL; 95% confidence interval [CI], 19 to 1075; p = 0.015) and reduced the need for concentrated erythrocyte transfusions by 25.6% (0.86 units; 95% CI, 0.08 to 1.65; p = 0.022). After surgery, desmopressin reduced the duration of treatment with analgesic agents by 13.1% (34.0 hours; 95% CI, -5.2 to 72.7; p = 0.105), presumably by decreasing bleeding in the surgical wound. When adjusted for the origin of the scoliosis by two-way analysis of variance, this effect was even more evident (p = 0.014). Multiple regression analysis showed that the best three predictors of blood loss in surgery and transfusion requirements were the bleeding time, glass bead platelet retention, and the use of desmopressin.\r"

Design: Randomized trial with crossover allowed from systemic to intrahepatic therapy if tumor progression occurred on systemic therapy. Setting: Academic medical center, referral-based clinic. Patients: One hundred sixty-two patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal carcinoma agreed to be randomly assigned to treatment groups. At laparotomy, 63 were excluded from the study: 25 had hepatic resection; 33, extrahepatic disease; 1, infection; and 4, no tumor. Intervention: Fourteen-day continuous infusion of fluorodeoxyuridine each month using an infusaid pump (0.3 and 0.15 mg/kg body weight X d in the intrahepatic and systemic arms, respectively). Main Results: Intrahepatic therapy produced a significantly higher complete and partial response rate, 50%, compared with 20% for systemic therapy (p = 0.001). After tumor progression, 60% of the systemic patients crossed over to intrahepatic therapy; 25% then had a partial response, and 33% a minor response or stabilization of disease on intrahepatic therapy. Toxicity included ulcer disease (17%) and biliary sclerosis (8%) in patients receiving intrahepatic therapy and diarrhea (70%) in patients receiving systemic therapy. Extrahepatic disease occurred in 56% and 37% of the patients in the intrahepatic and systemic groups, respectively (p = 0.092). The median survivals were 17 and 12 months, for the intrahepatic and systemic groups, respectively. Conclusion: When compared with systemic therapy, hepatic arterial chemotherapy significantly increases response rate for hepatic metastases from colorectal carcinoma and appears to be a more effective treatment.\r"

The mean duration for sustained remissions was 33 months. Our earlier review of outcome of antithyroid therapy showed markedly reduced remission rates, which appeared to be related to increases in dietary iodine intake. Although the greater percentage of patients entering remission today is in marked contrast to the 1973 report, average dietary iodine content has been decreasing. A continuing role for antithyroid drugs should be maintained as an option in the management of Graves disease. Daily dietary iodine intake may influence the anticipated remission rate after antithyroid drug therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Since 1970, forty-two patients with pulmonary hypertension due to chronic, thromboembolic obstruction of the major pulmonary arteries have had pulmonary thromboendarterectomy at the University of California, San Diego, and the San Diego Veterans Medical Centers. Duration of symptoms before admission averaged 4.4 years, with many alternative diagnoses having been made. At admission, 29 patients had class IV disease by New York Heart Association criteria, and 12, class III. Immediately after surgery, pulmonary vascular resistance declined significantly (p less than 0.001) from 897 +/- 352 dynes/s.cm-5 to 278 +/- 135 dynes/s.cm-5. Seven patients with class IV disease died in the postoperative period. Of the 35 survivors (mean follow-up, 28 months), 16 had class I disease; 18, class II; and 1, class III. Of the 17 patients who have returned for cardiac catheterization at 4 to 12 months after surgery, a further decline (p less than 0.05) in pulmonary vascular resistance has occurred. This experience indicates that the disorder is commoner than we previously suspected and that thromboendarterectomy is feasible, even in patients with severe and protracted hemodynamic compromise.\r"

  ".W": "We have analyzed the safety of doing pulmonary angiography in 67 consecutive patients with moderate-to-severe primary pulmonary hypertension or hypertension secondary to chronic thromboembolic occlusions of the pulmonary arteries. The average (+/- SD) pulmonary arterial systolic and diastolic pressures were 74 +/- 19 and 34 +/- 10 mm Hg, respectively. Fourteen patients had a right ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 20 mm Hg or more. Selective left and right main pulmonary artery injections were done using ionic contrast agents in 56 patients and nonionic contrast agents in 11. No major rhythm disturbances or systemic hypotension requiring therapy occurred, and there were no deaths. Thrombotic occlusions of the pulmonary arteries were identified in 52 patients and confirmed in all 42 of those who had a thromboendarterectomy. At autopsy, 3 of the 15 patients who had normal angiograms were found not to have had thrombotic occlusions. We conclude that pulmonary angiography can be done safely despite the presence of severe pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure, and that the procedure leads to the identification of chronic, major-vessel thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension that may be alleviated by thromboendarterectomy.\r"

  ".W": "Study Objective: To determine the effect of displaying previous results of diagnostic tests on the ordering of selected outpatient tests. Design: Sixteen-week controlled trial with a 13-week pre-intervention and 8-week post-intervention observation periods. Patients were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups so that each physician was his or her own control. Only scheduled visits were included. Randomization occurred before the pre-intervention observation period. Setting: Academic primary care general medicine clinic affiliated with an urban general hospital. Subjects: Pre-intervention period: 111 physicians (97 internal medicine residents, 14 faculty internists), 4683 patients, 5942 scheduled visits. Intervention period: same 111 physicians, 5946 patients, 8148 visits. Post-intervention period: 76 physicians (62 residents, 14 faculty), 2571 patients, 2858 scheduled visits. Intervention: With an order for one of eight selected diagnostic tests through microcomputer workstations, a window was opened on the screen and previous test results were displayed along with the time interval between the first and last result. Tests were ordered for control patients into the same workstations without previous results displayed. Measurements and Main Results: Previous results of one or more study tests were available for display for 96% of scheduled patients. Significantly lower results (p less than 0.05 by paired t-test) for the selected tests were found for intervention patient visits than for control visits: charges per visit (mean +/- SE) for intervention patients $12.17 +/- 0.62, compared with $13.99 +/- 0.77 for controls, a 13.0% difference; tests per visit were 0.51 +/- 0.03, compared with 0.56 +/- 0.03, an 8.5% difference. The number of study tests ordered decreased significantly for intervention patients (16.8%) and for controls (10.9%). During the post-intervention period, ordering of study tests increased for both groups, but the increase from the intervention period was not significant. Conclusions: Presenting physicians with previous test results reduced the ordering of those tests. The actual effect may have been greater than 13%, because there were reductions in study tests ordered for both intervention and control patients during the intervention period when compared with the pre-intervention period, and both tended to rise after the intervention, or display, was turned off.\r"

While postoperative visual acuity is usually good, measurements of acuity are of only limited value and do not describe visual performance for a variety of spatial frequencies and contrasts. In the present study, the effect of radial keratotomy on the contrast-sensitivity function was examined. Six spatial frequencies were tested (0.5, 1.0, 3.0, 6.0, 11.4, and 22.8 cycles/degree) using the Nicolet CS 2000 with patients wearing corrective lenses. The results revealed that, at least for the conditions tested, radial keratotomy does not produce a statistically significant decline in contrast sensitivity.\r"

In eyes with asteroid bodies after the age of 70 years, the prevalence of PVD, either complete or partial, was lower than in age-matched control eyes (P less than .01), and the prevalence of liquefaction (19%) was lower than has been reported in controls. Of eight eyes with proliferative diabetic retinopathy and asteroid bodies, only one showed partial PVD. Patients who were diabetic and who had asteroid bodies were significantly younger than patients without diabetes with asteroid hyalosis (P less than .01). Our data suggest that the presence of asteroid bodies may arrest the process of vitreous collapse or contraction and that diabetes might influence the development of asteroid hyalosis.\r"

Reoperation increases the frequency and severity of mechanical restriction significantly because of additional scar formation. Attempts to isolate the muscle from other tissues using gelatin sponges or Supramid plastic sleeves have been unsuccessful because of the body's reaction to these permanent foreign bodies. We used an ultra-pure fraction of sodium hyaluronate to study whether this nonantigenic, noninflammatory, viscoelastic substance could function as a temporary sleeve to prevent or reduce scarring and mechanical restriction following strabismus surgery. We resected the superior rectus muscle of 14 eyes from seven 5- to 7-pound white rabbits. In one eye, we instilled sodium hyaluronate 1% around the muscle. The other eye served as a control. The rabbits were killed at five, seven, ten, 14, 21, 28, and 42 days. Ante mortem length-tension measurements and post mortem histologic examinations of the operated muscles were performed in a blinded fashion. The results suggested, but did not definitely demonstrate, that sodium hyaluronate may reduce postoperative adhesions.\r"

During the period of upward eye deviation, all functional types of conjugate eye movements were present in the upper field of gaze, suggesting an imbalance of the vertical gaze-holding mechanism. The eyes could be driven down only by a combined blink and downward saccade. Both the thought disorder and the ocular deviation responded promptly to anticholinergic agents. We propose that the disorders of thought and eye movement in oculogyric crisis are linked by a pharmacological imbalance common to both.\r"

  ".W": "In the present study, the number of neurons (greater than 20 microns in diameter) within the lateral part of the pedunculopontine nucleus pars compacta (PPNc) was determined at six rostrocaudal levels in 3 subjects with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), in 9 subjects with Alzheimer's disease, and in 6 age-matched control subjects. At each level examined, significantly fewer neurons were present in patients with PSP than in control subjects (49 to 69% reduction). Significant differences in numbers of neurons were not demonstrated between control subjects and patients with Alzheimer's disease. The extent of pathological changes, particularly neurofibrillary tangles, was examined within the PPNc of subjects in these three groups. The average number of neurofibrillary tangles in a 12-microns-thick midlevel section of the lateral PPNc was 68.7 in subjects with PSP, 18.3 in those with Alzheimer's disease, and 3.0 in aged control subjects. These abnormalities of PPNc neurons in PSP may play important roles in some of the clinical features characteristic of this disease.\r"

Although the scores of the controls in the memory test battery showed no deterioration after the administration of scopolamine, the same dose resulted in significantly reduced memory performance in parkinsonian patients in two tests which involved the recognition of meaningless drawings. The selective vulnerability of parkinsonian subjects without cognitive impairment to a subthreshold dose of scopolamine suggests the existence of an underlying alteration of central cholinergic transmission. The neuropsychological findings in our study agree with postmortem biochemical data, which showed decreased cortical choline acetyltransferase activity in all parkinsonian patients, suggesting the existence of neuronal compensation in parkinsonian patients who are without cognitive impairment.\r"

Because the principal neurotransmitter of the perforant pathway's excitatory action is thought to be glutamate, we microdissected a portion of the pathway's terminal zone and assayed the excised tissue for glutamate. There was an 83% decrease in the level of free glutamate in subjects with Alzheimer's disease as compared to control subjects not affected by dementia (p less than 0.005). We believe that this diminution in the glutamate content is a direct neurochemical correlate of perforant pathway destruction and that disruption of this crucial corticolimbic pathway contributes to the memory dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.\r"

Standard electroculogram showed that fixation, pursuit, saccades, and scanning of salient features of scenes and faces were normal, indicating that the defect was not due to abnormal scanning. However, study of the transitional properties of scanning revealed that the scanpaths of personally meaningful familiar faces, whether or not they were consciously recognized, were less predictable than those of other faces. This result indicates the existence of an internal and relatively specific schema for familiar faces sufficient to alter the \"predictable\" scanpath used for nonfamiliar faces. This internal schema is accessed even when conscious recognition fails, i.e., when other pertinent memories related to the possessor of the face are not evoked. The meaning of this finding is comparable to that obtained with autonomic studies of covert recognition in prosopagnosia and suggests that properties of scanning can be used as an index of higher neural processing.\r"

Third, no \"phosphate trapping\" is observed during prolonged low-level exercise. Fourth, postexercise recovery is abnormally prolonged by the slow dephosphorylation of sugar phosphates, which has an in vivo half-life of about nine minutes. These findings demonstrate how muscle tissue adapts to a block in a major bioenergetic pathway.\r"

Patients were classified into three groups based on the duration of symptoms prior to starting dopa treatment: Group 1, 1 to 3 years; Group 2, 4 to 6 years; Group 3, 7 to 9 years. After 15 years of treatment and 3,689 person-years of observation, Group 1 had an observed-to-expected mortality ratio of 1.43; Group 2, 2.44; and Group 3, 2.95 (p less than 0.05). This result confirmed that increased duration of disease was associated with increased mortality risk. To examine the effect of the time of initiation of dopa treatment, duration of disease was held constant at 17 years for all three groups. Observed-to-expected mortality ratios were 1.43 for Group 1; 2.66 for Group 2; 2.63 for Group 3. This statistically significant advantage for Group 1 (p less than 0.0001) led to the conclusion that early treatment with dopa has a beneficial effect on life expectancy. After 17 years of disease, causes of death in Group 1 were less likely (p = 0.027) to be due to Parkinson's disease than was found in the other groups.\r"

After [NMTT-14C]MOX injection, MOX levels in plasma quickly became high in both rats and monkeys and then declined, with half-lives at the beta phase of 18.8 and 67.1 min, respectively. The levels of NMTT liberated from MOX were much lower than those of MOX, but the apparent elimination was significantly slow. The levels of MOX and NMTT in rat liver were almost comparable but lower than those in plasma. With [14C]NMTT administration, the level of NMTT in plasma declined, with half-lives at the beta phase of 21.5 min in rats and 54.0 min in monkeys. After [NMTT-14C]MOX injection, most of the radioactivity was excreted in urine as MOX, with 11% of the dose in rats and 8% of the dose in monkeys eliminated as NMTT until 24 h. Total biliary excretion was 26% of the injected radioactivity in rats, and most of it was due to MOX. In one monkey, the total biliary excretion was only 0.2% of the injected radioactivity. With [14C]NMTT administration, most radioactivity was excreted in the urine as unchanged NMTT in both animals. Oral administration in rats showed that part of the biliary-excreted MOX was degraded to NMTT in the intestine and then absorbed. Repeated administration of [NMTT-14C]MOX to rats did not change the levels of MOX and NMTT in plasma or liver nor did it change the excretion profiles. Thus, accumulation of MOX and NMTT did not occur.\r"

Geometric mean bactericidal titers for E. coli 1 h after the infusion were 1:60 for ciprofloxacin and 1:252 for cefotaxime, and for K. pneumoniae they were 1:20 and 1:256, respectively. However, geometric mean titers were poor for both antibiotics against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (less than 1:2 for ciprofloxacin versus 1:5 for cefotaxime) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (less than 1:2 for both antibiotics), as well as against P. aeruginosa (1:3 for ciprofloxacin versus 1:2 for cefotaxime). These data suggest that ciprofloxacin may be useful for the treatment of serious infections caused by E. coli and K. pneumoniae. However, caution is suggested when this dose of ciprofloxacin is used in situations in which septicemia is caused by P. aeruginosa or S. aureus and originates outside the urinary tract.\r"

Binding by plasma proteins did not appear to be a determinant of pulmonary entry.\r"

  ".W": "The activity of 9-(4-hydroxy-3-hydroxymethylbut-1-yl)guanine (BRL 39123) against several herpesviruses was compared with that of acyclovir (ACV). In plaque reduction tests with clinical isolates of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), and varicella-zoster virus, mean 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50S) (n = number tested) for BRL 39123 were 0.4 (n = 17), 1.5 (n = 13), and 3.1 (n = 5) micrograms/ml, respectively. Corresponding IC50S for ACV were 0.2, 0.6, and 3.8 micrograms/ml. Cytomegalovirus was relatively resistant to BRL 39123 (IC50, 51 micrograms/ml), but equid herpesvirus 1, bovid herpesvirus 2, and felid herpesvirus 1 were susceptible (IC50S, 1.6, 1.2, and 0.9 micrograms/ml, respectively). BRL 39123 was inactive against an HSV-1 strain which does not express thymidine kinase activity, but a DNA polymerase mutant selected for resistance to ACV was sensitive to BRL 39123 (IC50, 1.5 micrograms/ml). In contrast to the results from plaque reduction tests, BRL 39123 was more active than ACV against HSV-1 and of equal activity against HSV-2 in virus yield reduction assays in MRC-5 cells. After treatment of HSV-infected cultures for short periods, BRL 39123 was considerably more effective than ACV at reducing virus replication, and furthermore, after removal of extracellular BRL 39123, virus replication remained depressed for long periods, whereas such persistent activity was not observed with ACV. Neither compound significantly affected MRC-5 cell replication at 100 micrograms/ml, but at 300 micrograms/ml BRL 39123 was more inhibitory than ACV.\r"

  ".W": "By using a highly specific chromatographic technique, the effect of renal failure on the pharmacokinetics of the six main components of teicoplanin, taken individually or as a whole, was assessed for over 120 h after administration of a 3-mg/kg intravenous dose to healthy volunteers (group 1, n = 6) and to noninfected patients with moderate (group 2, n = 6) or severe (group 3, n = 7) renal failure. In subjects with normal renal function, total teicoplanin was mainly excreted in urine and its concentrations in plasma could be adequately fitted to a three-compartment model. Renal failure did not affect the model or the distribution of teicoplanin but strongly decreased its renal clearance (9.3, 3.2, and 0.6 ml/h per kg, respectively, for the three groups of subjects), in close relationship with the creatinine clearance (r = 0.973, n = 18, P less than 0.001). The cumulative urinary excretion of unchanged total teicoplanin was decreased (50, 21, and 5% of the given dose for groups 1 to 3) and the terminal half-life was enhanced (62, 96, and 111 h for groups 1 to 3) by renal impairment. The relative behavior of the six major components was only slightly affected by renal failure. Consequently, the dosage regimen adjustment could be based on the total teicoplanin concentration, and simulations with the mean estimated pharmacokinetic parameters suggest that the 6-mg/kg daily dose, known to be effective in patients with normal renal function, could be given every 2 and 3 days in patients with moderate and severe renal insufficiency, respectively.\r"

However, no universally accepted histopathologic criteria exist for establishing the diagnosis of this disease. We have combined the method of morphometric point counting with the mast cell-specific stain, conjugated avidin, to accurately quantify mast cells in cutaneous tissue sections of mastocytosis. Using this histologic approach, we found that macules, papules, and nodules of mast cell disease had from ninefold to nearly a 160-fold greater mast cell content than was observed in normal skin and in several other cutaneous disorders. This technique also permitted the objective histologic stratification of mastocytosis skin lesions according to their mast cell density. Morphometric point counting in conjunction with conjugated avidin offers a simple and accurate method for establishing the diagnosis of mastocytosis.\r"

The actual average five-year survival rate of the patients with MM and hypopigmentation (86.3%) was significantly better than predicted (74.8%) on the basis of the risk factors present in each patient at the time of entry into the study. The findings suggest that hypopigmentation is a factor that beneficially influences the prognosis of MM, and that the mechanisms that inhibit or destroy normal melanocytes in patients with MM may also slow the growth of this cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Eighty-seven patients with toxic epidermal necrolysis were observed at Hopital Henri Mondor in Creteil, France, over the last 12 years. The mean percentage of body surface area involved was 39%. Erosive mucous membrane lesions, identical to those of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, were present in all but three cases. Necrolysis was sometimes generalized within 24 hours but usually spread progressively after a Stevens-Johnson syndrome-like aspect at the onset. Mortality was 25%. Infection, mainly with Staphylococus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, was the first cause of death, clearly responsible in ten of 20 cases. Age, extension of necrolysis, idiopathic nature of toxic epidermal necrolysis, ingestion of many drugs, elevation of urea, creatinine, and glucose levels, neutropenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia were statistically linked to a bad prognosis. A multivariant analysis showed that three of these prognosis factors are of paramount importance, namely: age, area of necrolysis, and serum urea level. Pigmentary changes and sicca syndrome were frequently observed sequelae in survivors.\r"

The culpable drug was determined by standardized criteria. Only three patients had received no drugs before the onset of TEN. Most patients (71 of 87) were receiving more than one drug. Patients had taken an average of 4.4 +/- 3.4 drugs each. A culpable drug was determined in 67 patients (77%). The mean time from first drug administration to onset of TEN was 13.6 +/- 8.4 days. The culprit drugs included the following: sulfonamides, 18 cases, and especially sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, 12; anticonvulsants, seven (barbiturates and carbamazepine only); nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 29 (especially the phenylbutazone derivative, 16, and oxicam derivatives, 10); allopurinol, three; chlormezanone, three; and others, seven. Aspirin, antipyretics, and antibiotics are infrequently implicated in this series. The pattern of culprit drugs changed with years. The level of sulfonamide-related TEN remained the same, while incidence of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced TEN increased sharply, the introduction of oxicam derivatives being in part responsible.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have shown an orderly sequence of expression of structural antigens within the skin basement-membrane zone of the human fetus. Interestingly, these findings differ from those reported following split-thickness would induction in Yorkshire pigs. To readdress this apparent disparity, as well as to further extend such studies to include other basement-membrane antigens more recently identified, we produced split-thickness wounds in a primate species and serially examined the wounds by immunofluorescence technique for the expression of seven antigens normally found in intact primate skin basement membrane. By the fourth day following wounding, laminin, type-IV collagen, and fibronectin were all detectable along the dermoepidermal junction. In contrast, bullous pemphigoid antigen, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita antigen, cicatricial pemphigoid antigen, and KF-1 antigen were undetectable until days 6, 8, 10, and 11, respectively. These latter findings are in complete agreement with those previously reported in the developing human fetus. On the basis of the results of this study, we would suggest that primate rather than pig skin may be a more appropriate animal model for wound-healing studies. These data are consistent with previous reports suggesting that the basement-membrane antigens recognized by bullous pemphigoid and cicatricial pemphigold autoantibodies are indeed distinct. Finally, these data bring into question the functional role of bullous pemphigoid antigen during the early phase of wound healing in humans.\r"

Perivascular deposits of MAC were present in 13 specimens of lesional skin and only two specimens of clinically uninvolved skin, suggesting a possible pathogenetic role for MAC in the development of a skin lesion. Control studies were performed on the clinically normal skin of 15 individuals (11 patients with various nonbullous skin diseases and four healthy volunteers) and on skin lesions of seven patients with inflammatory skin diseases. In the clinically normal skin of only one patient, perivascular deposits of MAC were detected. This patient had rheumatoid arthritis and a cutaneous eruption due to the administration of aurothioglucose. We conclude that the activation of the terminal components of the complement system may play an important role in the formation of lesions in leukocytoclastic vasculitis of the skin, but is not an indispensable condition.\r"

With all other agents, histologic fibrosis of the vessel correlating with clinical disappearance occurred after eight days. However, 0.5% polidocanol and sodium tetradecyl sulfate developed recanalization through the initially sclerosed vessel between eight and 14 days, with clinical reappearance of the 0.5% polidocanol-injected vessel at 30 days, after injection. Cutaneous necrosis was noted clinically and histologically in three of ten vessels injected with 1.0% polidocanol and in two of ten vessels injected with hypertonic saline.

  ".W": "Long-lasting and complete remission was obtained in a 48-year-old patient with refractory pemphigus vulgaris by an experimental treatment protocol that tries to synchronize plasmapheresis with subsequent pulse cyclophosphamide therapy. The rationale of the approach tries to utilize the plasmapheresis-induced increased proliferation of pathogenic cell clones for partial deletion of these clones through application of maximum pulse immunosuppression treatment during the period of assumed maximum proliferation and, thus, maximum vulnerability of the antibody-producing cells. The treatment schedule consisted of initial withdrawal of immunosuppressive drug therapy, repeated large-volume plasmaphereses substituted with immunoglobulin-free albumin solutions, subsequent application of high-dose (36 mg/kg of body weight) cyclophosphamide therapy, and low-dose maintenance immunosuppression for several months. As a result, our patient remained disease free over a follow-up period of 40 months without any further immunosuppressive treatment. Stimulation of postexchange antibody production and subsequent application of high-dose cytotoxic drugs might be a valuable tool in the management of refractory pemphigus vulgaris and, possibly, in the management of other autoantibody-mediated diseases.\r"

The ratio of boys to girls, the distributions of salt losers to non-salt losers, and the age at diagnosis were studied in relation to the year of birth. Early diagnosis was found to be more common in children born after 1970 due partly to the introduction of a method of assaying the concentration of 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone in serum, partly to an increase in the number of paediatricians in the West Midlands, and partly to the appointment of a paediatric endocrinologist. A neonatal screening programme does not seem to be necessary.\r"

Two hundred and sixty seven other members of staff underwent serological testing and were given prophylactic pooled gamma globulin. Twenty three per cent were immune before exposure. Of people born in the United States, those at highest risk of developing the disease are physicians, dentists, nurses and those under the age of 40. Of those born outside the United States, being white and under the age of 30 are the two main risk factors. Data from a questionnaire sent to 19 nurses at risk (six cases, 13 controls) suggested that sharing food with patients or their families, drinking coffee, sharing cigarettes and eating in the nurses' office in the intensive care unit were associated with an increased incidence of hepatitis. Nurses with three or four of these habits were at particular risk. The costs of screening and prophylaxis were US $64.72 per employee, while prophylaxis alone would have cost US $8.42 per employee. Assessing risk factors on the one hand and costs of prophylaxis on the other are important elements in the control of nosocomial infections.\r"

Two of the children were known to have had frequent cyanotic episodes and died during these events. In the three remaining cases there was no previous history of cyanotic or apnoeic episodes. The death of one of these three children was seen by his parents and the clinical features suggested that apnoea rather than a cardiac arrhythmia was the primary mechanism for his death.

Of the 37 patients still attending the clinic after a mean of 25 years, having been followed up for a mean of 18.4 years, 16 who had complied well with the diet had normal or only slightly abnormal mucosal morphology whereas all 10 who had not complied had abnormal morphology. In these 10 lactase, sucrase, and alkaline phosphatase activities were significantly less than values in those who complied well. Mucosal sucrase and alkaline phosphatase activities in those who complied well were no different from those in a control population, whereas lactase activity was significantly lower. It is concluded that failure to comply with a GFD during childhood results in decreased adult stature and in persisting active enteropathy with depressed brush border enzyme activity.\r"

Although the mean psychomotor developmental index and the incidence of specific neurodevelopmental impairments were not significantly different between the two groups, survivors in the group born to pre-eclamptic mothers had a significantly lower mean mental developmental index, and significantly more of these children had one or more impairments compared with the control group at 2 years of age.\r"

Facial clefts were registered in 247 infants representing a prevalence of 1.56 per 1000 total births. Cleft palate was more common than cleft lip, with cleft lip and palate occupying an intermediate position. More than half of the infants with facial clefts had associated defects. Males predominated for cleft lip; females for cleft palate. Cleft lip (alone) was more common in babies born to women aged 35 years and over. Sudden declines in registered prevalence were observed in 1978 and 1985. Clefts were more common in socioeconomically deprived areas of the city. In comparison with data from elsewhere, Glasgow seems to have a low rate of cleft lip, a high rate of cleft palate, and a high rate of associated defects. Many of the findings of cleft palate in Glasgow could be explained by the interaction of an unidentified environmental teratogen with a susceptible population.\r"

Fifty five of the referred siblings who had been born at full term (greater than or equal to 37 week gestation) were randomly selected for a detailed analysis of heart rate and breathing patterns, as were all siblings born at full term from the prospective study (16 with a previous sibling in whom SIDS had occurred and seven with a sibling born at full term and in whom SIDS had subsequently occurred). The control group consisted of 197 recordings on 170 infants born at full term and matched by postnatal age. The mothers of the siblings smoked and consumed alcohol more often during pregnancy than the mothers of control babies. The siblings had lower Apgar scores and were more often breast fed than controls. There were no significant differences in the number of apnoeic pauses in the quantities of periodic breathing or in the heart and respiratory rates during regular breathing between the siblings and the controls.\r"

The studies included scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of gallstones, measurements of bacterial adherence to gallstones in vitro, and determination of glycocalyx elaboration by biliary bacteria. Gallstones from 85 patients were studied under SEM. Twenty-five (78%) of 32 pigment stones had evidence of bacterial microcolonies throughout the interior of the stones. Bacteria were absent from the interior of all 35 cholesterol stones studied. Composite stones (stones with separate pigment and cholesterol portions) showed evidence of bacteria within the pigment portions in 14 (78%) of 18 cases. Biliary bacteria adhered to the surface of pigment gallstones in vitro in 35 (90%) of 39 cases, compared with three (8%) of 39 cholesterol stones. Glycocalyx was elaborated by bacteria isolated from nine (82%) of 11 patients with either pigment or composite gallstones. One (33%) of three bacterial species from patients with cholesterol gallstone disease produced glycocalyx. These studies indicate that most pigment gallstones obtained from patients in Western cultures form as a composite of bacteria, bacterial glycocalyx, and pigment solids. Bacteria were found in the majority of black as well as brown pigment stones. These findings serve as the basis of a new theory of pigment stone formation in which bacteria and glycocalyx are postulated to be responsible for the precipitation and subsequent agglomeration of bilirubin pigment. These results also suggest that sepsis is more common in pigment gallstone disease because the stones can serve as a sanctuary for bacteria.\r"

To assess improvement, the patients were separated into two groups by date of operation: Group I, May 1963 to December 1973 (N = 106), and Group II, January 1974 to December 1985 (N = 223). The operative mortality was 11 (10.4%) in Group I and two (0.9%) in Group II. The 10-year actuarial survival rate was 73.4% in Group I and 93.7% in Group II. Baffle complications, similar in both groups, were identified in 81 patients; 19 were major, causing death or requiring reoperation. By latest electrocardiogram, 21 of 45 (46.7%) of Group I patients and 129 of 180 (71.7%) of Group II patients were in normal sinus rhythm. Late ambulatory electrocardiography, however, revealed that a majority of patients had sinus node dysfunction or other dysrhythmias. Right ventricular (RV) angiography revealed definite diminution of RV contractility in 14 (11%) of 126 children. At late follow-up, 113 of 148 (76%) children were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class I and 35 of 148 (24%) were in NYHA Class II. Thirty-five (21%) patients were on cardiac medication chiefly for dysrhythmia management. There has been significant improvement in the early and late mortality with the Mustard operation, and serious baffle complications are infrequent. Dysrhythmias continue to be a major problem but the surviving patients are clinically well and relatively few have significant RV dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-five patients with 59 complex renovascular lesions required two or more branch artery anastomoses during aortorenal grafting. Forty-five reconstructions involving 112 branches were facilitated using hypothermic ex vivo perfusion preservation, whereas 14 involving 28 branches were repaired in situ. Ex vivo repair was used whenever the kidney was considered unreconstructable by in situ techniques. Fibromuscular dysplasia predominated and the branched internal iliac artery was used for renal artery substitution. There were no deaths and only one kidney (ex vivo) was lost. Branch vessel occlusion occurred in two of 140 anastomoses (1.4%). Ninety-eight per cent (51/52) of the heparinized patients had cure or improvement at mean follow-up of 5 years. No late graft dysfunction occurred in postoperative angiographic follow-up. The branched internal iliac artery is uniquely suited and remains the preference of the authors for the replacement of the diseased renal artery and its branches. The in situ repair is ideally suited for lesions limited to the renal artery bifurcation. Ex vivo repair is reserved for complex or reoperative distal arterial lesions. Unique characteristics in the group include: bilateral lesions (25%), solitary kidney (22%), reoperative lesions (16%), children (9%), and coexisting significant aortic disease (7%). In situ and ex vivo repair meet all the challenges of complex renovascular disease. The strategies outlined will achieve outstanding long-term total and segmental renal salvage in the treatment of hypertension or aneurysmal disease. When ex vivo repair is required, it can be accomplished with only one additional simple maneuver, the reanastomosis of the renal vein.\r"

  ".W": "Primary genetic factors are etiologic in at least 5-10% of patients with colon cancer. The polyposis syndromes (FPC) are easily identified examples because of the spectacular number of polyps. The hereditary nonpolyposis syndromes (HNPCC), although five times more common than FPC, are usually not recognized because they do not have such a distinctive clinical, premonitory genetic marker. Colorectal cancer expression was surveyed in 10 extended, thoroughly documented HNPCC kindreds. One hundred sixteen patients were found to have 183 colorectal cancers. Despite the striking family history, less than 5% were correctly treated by subtotal colectomy. This provided a unique opportunity to study the natural history. Five findings differed significantly (p less than 0.05) from patients with sporadic colon cancer: (1) mean age of initial colon cancer diagnosed was 45.6 years; (2) 69.1% of first colon cancers were located proximal to the splenic flexure of the colon; (3) 18.1% had synchronous colon cancer; (4) 24.2% had metachronous colon cancer develop with life table analysis showing the risk for a metachronous lesion at 10 years to be 40%; and (5) only 23.3% of cancers were located in the sigmoid colon or rectum. Based on this data, it is recommended that the family history of all patients with a newly diagnosed colon cancer be evaluated for evidence of this syndrome. If an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern emerges, an in-depth genetic investigation is indicated. When HNPCC is confirmed, the following recommendations apply: a subtotal abdominal colectomy is indicated at the time of the initial colon cancer because of the risk of synchronous and metachronous lesions. The rectum should be spared in favor of careful lifetime surveillance because of the proclivity for proximal colon cancer involvement. As yet unaffected members of a newly diagnosed HNPCC kindred who are in the \"direct genetic line\" should be cautioned that they are at 50% risk and must begin an intensive surveillance program beginning in the third decade with careful attention to the right colon. Patients from newly diagnosed HNPCC families who have had a previous conventional colectomy for colon cancer should, at the very least, enter an intensive surveillance program; a prophylactic completion subtotal colectomy should be considered for patients who are less than totally compliant.\r"

The operation effectively controlled weight and maintained satisfactory weight loss even after 6 years (mean weights and ranges: Preoperative: 290 lbs (196-535); 18 months: 175 lbs (110-300); 72 months: 205 lbs (140-320). The gastric bypass favorably affected non-insulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM), hypertension, physical and role functioning, and several measures of mental health. Rigorous follow-up (97.5% over 6 years) revealed that health problems were common in postoperative patients; there were nine late deaths. Abnormal glucose metabolism was present in 141 (36%) of 397 patients before surgery: NIDDM was present in 88 patients (22%) and 53 patients (14%) were glucose impaired. Of these, all but two became euglycemic within 4 months after surgery without any diabetic medication or special diets. The most recent 42 morbidly obese patients with NIDDM were studied intensively. In that cohort, fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, and glycosylated hemoglobin returned to normal after surgery; insulin release, insulin resistance, and utilization of glucose improved sharply. The normalization of glucose metabolism after gastric bypass may not be related solely to weight loss and restriction of caloric intake, but may also be due to the bypass of the antrum and duodenum.\r"

A \"degree of difficulty\" relative value scale (DODRVS) of surgical services is periodically revised as technology changes. The DODRVS multiplied by a regional factor, determined by local market research, establishes the fee that CAT will pay the surgeon. Balance billing is permitted if the patient (1) is informed in advance by the surgeon that the fee will be higher than CAT will pay, and (2) knows that the service can be obtained from other local surgeons who will accept the CAT fee. The goal of the CAT method of surgeon reimbursement is to gain physician support for an access-oriented, market-driven negotiated fee schedule. Compared with a resource-based relative value scale RBRVS) methodology, the CAT system is not formula-driven and depends on physician acceptance.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1969 and 1986, 88 patients had a Whipple resection for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (N = 50), ampulla (N = 19), distal bile duct (N = 10), and duodenum (N = 9). Forty-nine patients were men, 39 were women, and the mean age was 58 years (range: 34-84 years). The patients were divided into two groups on the basis of two different time periods: those operated on from 1969 to 1980 (N = 41) and those operated on from 1981 to 1986 (N = 47). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of mean age, sex distribution, duration of symptoms before presentation, or mean weight loss. Likewise, preoperative laboratory data were similar for both groups of patients. In addition, mean tumor size for patients with pancreatic cancer (3.5 cm vs. 3.2 cm) and patients with nonpancreatic periampullary cancer (1.9 cm vs. 2.2 cm) was similar in both groups, as was the incidence of positive lymph nodes. Among the 41 patients operated on during the first period, hospital morbidity and mortality rates were 59% and 24%, respectively. In contrast, hospital morbidity and mortality rates were 36% and 2%, respectively, among the 47 patients operated on during the recent period. During the recent period, more Whipple procedures were performed each year (7.8 vs. 3.4) and by fewer surgeons (3.4 operations/surgeon vs. 1.9 operations/surgeon). In addition, between 1981 and 1986, there were fewer total pancreatectomies (9% vs. 39%), fewer vagotomies (26% vs. 76%), and more pyloric-preserving procedures (30% vs. 0) performed compared with the earlier period. During the recent period, mean operative time (7.8 vs. 9.0 hours), mean estimated blood loss (1694 vs. 3271 mL), and mean intraoperative blood replacement (3.6 vs. 6.3 units) were all significantly less than in the earlier period. These findings suggest that the recent decline in operative morbidity and mortality may be due to fewer surgeons performing more Whipple resections in less time and with less blood loss. The actuarial 5-year survival rate for the 38 patients with nonpancreatic periampullary cancer was 34%. Surprisingly, the actuarial 5-year survival rate among the 50 patients with pancreatic cancer was 18%. Moreover, in the absence of positive lymph node involvement, the 5-year actuarial survival rate among patients with pancreatic cancer was 48%. No explanation is obvious for the improvement in survival among patients with pancreatic cancer.\r"

Of the survivors with exocrine cancers, there were nine of 97 patients who had curative operation, two had had palliative resections only, and one was an incidental microfocal carcinoma; in the remaining 11 patients a histologic origin in the pancreas was not established. Preoperatively suspected and histologically proven 3-year survivors included six patients with ductal adenocarcinomas, three patients with mucinous cystadenocarcinomas, one patient with acinic cell carcinoma, and one patient with microadenocarcinoma. Only two patients can be considered cured. Tumor size and lymph node status did not correlate with survival. Cystadenocarcinomas comprised 1% of cases but one third of 3-year survivors. Long-term survival in histologically confirmed pancreatic carcinoma is a rare event that cannot be predicted in the individual case.\r"

  ".W": "Major changes have recently occurred in the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of primary lesions of the mediastinum. New diagnostic techniques and improved therapy have led to more objective preoperative diagnoses as well as better long-term results. These features are clearly demonstrated in a series of 400 consecutive patients with primary lesions of the mediastinum seen at Duke University Medical Center. Of these, 99 (25%) had a primary cystic lesion. The primary tumors included thymic neoplasms (17%), neurogenic tumors (14%), lymphoma (16%), germ cell tumors (11%), and a miscellaneous group. Malignant neoplasms were present in 166 patients (42%). The anterosuperior mediastinum was the most commonly involved site of a primary cyst or neoplasm (54%), followed by the posterior mediastinum (26%) and the middle mediastinum (20%). Symptoms were present in 62% of the patients and included chest pain (30%), dyspnea (16%), fever and chills (20%), and cough (16%). Of the lesions found on routine chest roentgenograms, 83% were benign. In contrast, 57% of the lesions in symptomatic patients were malignant. Prior to 1967, 94% of asymptomatic lesions were benign, but this figure has now decreased to 76%. Fifty percent of symptomatic patients had a malignant neoplasm before 1967 compared with 62% after that year. Newer diagnostic techniques have greatly enhanced the accuracy of the preoperative diagnosis. They include radioisotopic scanning, monoclonal antibodies, hormonal assay, electron microscopy, fine-needle aspiration biopsy, computed tomographic scans, and magnetic resonance imaging. Each has a definite role and is specifically illustrated as being quite important in this series.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Four of the 5 patients who were truly asymptomatic had benign lesions. All 4 patients with palpable adenopathy had malignant tumors. Posteroanterior and lateral chest roentgenograms detected the mediastinal mass in 29 (97%) of the 30 patients. All patients were operated on for tissue diagnosis or resection (13, median sternotomy; 8, right thoracotomy; 3, left thoracotomy; 2, low anterior cervical approach). Eight patients underwent mediastinoscopy, which was diagnostic in 6 and obviated the need for operation in 4. It was of particular value for patients with lymphoma, who can be managed without resection.\r"

  ".W": "From 1981 through 1986, 8 newborns with congenital diaphragmatic hernia required herniorrhaphy in the first 8 hours of life. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was employed in 7 after they met local criteria predictive of 95% mortality. These criteria were an alveolar-postductal arterial oxygen gradient greater than 600 mm Hg for 12 hours or hemodynamic instability. Four of these 7 patients had unremitting hypoxemia after herniorrhaphy (no \"honeymoon\" period), 3 of whom survived. One additional patient died, producing a mortality of 29%. ECMO used for 68 to 241 hours (mean, 163 hours) provided reliable oxygenation in all. Deaths resulted from disseminated intravascular coagulation and bleeding, and bleeding and pulmonary failure after ligation of a patent ductus arteriosus. Complications occurred in 6 patients and included bleeding (3), hernia recurrence (3), and air embolism (1). Follow-up ranging from 1 year to 6 years after discharge of the 5 survivors shows normal growth and development in 4. The reported mortality without ECMO following congenital diaphragmatic herniorrhaphy in the first 8 hours of life ranges between 60 and 80%. While bleeding may present problems, survival of newborns with refractory hypoxemia after diaphragmatic repair has improved with ECMO.\r"

Because physical findings and plain roentgenograms lack specificity, a high index of suspicion based on the path of the bullet tract is essential for early diagnosis. Esophageal injury should especially be suspected when the bullet wound is transcervical or transmediastinal. Perforation was diagnosed by esophagoscopy in 9 patients, esophagography in 4, and surgical exploration in 7. Mean time from admission to operation was 3.8 hours. Associated injuries occurred frequently. Eighteen patients were treated by primary closure and wide drainage, and 2 were managed by esophageal exclusion. There were 2 perioperative deaths, both in patients with associated aortic injuries, and 1 late death, for an overall mortality of 15%. There was one postoperative leak following a cervical repair. No leaks occurred in patients having a thoracic repair. The findings indicate that esophageal perforation must be sought by a variety of methods. With prompt diagnosis and early operation, primary repair can be safely accomplished. When sepsis from esophageal leak is avoided, mortality and major morbidity are related to associated injuries.\r"

The mean correlation coefficient between SvO2 and CI was 0.05 +/- 0.42, and was not significantly different from zero. Although the mean correlation coefficient between the change in SvO2 and the change in CI was significant (p less than .05), the magnitude of the coefficient (0.19 +/- 0.44) indicates poor predictive value. The correlation did not improve when adjusted for multiple clinical variables, and the SvO2 was not predictive of a CI less than 2 L/min/m2, a level of cardiac performance that might require intervention. In conclusion, SvO2 was not predictive of CI postoperatively in the cardiac surgical patient.\r"

The possible direct toxic effect of protamine on human right atrial trabeculae contracting isometrically in vitro was studied. Muscles were stimulated to contract at 1 Hz in Tyrode's solution (maintained at 34 degrees C, pH 7.4) into which protamine was continuously added. Following a polynomial regression analysis, a parabolic dose-response curve resulted. The equation was: y = 95.13 + 38.76x - 278.71x2 where y = relative developed force and x = concentration of protamine (milligrams per milliliters) (r = 0.82). The estimated concentration of protamine resulting in 50% developed force was 0.48 mg/ml. In a second series of experiments, protamine was added to the bath along with a neutralizing amount of heparin. This resulted in a limited reduction in the fall of relative developed force. Thus, protamine in high concentrations alone or in complex with heparin has a direct toxic effect on human myocardial muscle mechanics, and care is warranted in its clinical use.\r"

To determine if the diagnostic yields of lingular or right middle lobe biopsy specimens were unsatisfactory, we reviewed the results of open-lung biopsy in 73 adult patients; 26 were immunocompromised and 47, nonimmunocompromised. We found no evidence to suggest that these two sites were inherently inferior. In 20 of the nonimmunocompromised patients, computed tomography was performed prior to biopsy, and demonstrated no particular tendency for greater involvement of the lingula or right middle lobe. We conclude that lingular and right middle lobe biopsy is useful in the diagnosis of parenchymal lung disease and that these sites should not necessarily be avoided. Computed tomographic scanning prior to biopsy is helpful in guiding the surgeon to the appropriate sites from which to obtain biopsy specimens.\r"

The cases of 28 patients surviving early operative closure of septal rupture (within 1 day to 20 days of the infarction) were reviewed. Only 1 had concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting. Follow-up ranged from 7 to 16 years with an average of 9 years. Four patients were lost to follow-up. There were 4 late deaths, 2 of which were of cardiac origin. One was due to congestive heart failure and 1 to arrhythmia, 1 and 6 years after operation, respectively. Of the remaining 20 patients, 8 are in New York Heart Association Functional Class I and 12 are in Class II. Two patients underwent reoperation, 1 for a left ventricular false aneurysm 5 years postoperatively and the other for unstable angina 10 years postoperatively. Both had an uneventful postoperative course. Only 2 patients had late coronary events (1, nonfatal myocardial infarction; 1, unstable angina). We conclude that aggressive management of postinfarction VSD is fully justified in view of the long-term survival and functional palliation that can be anticipated for operative survivors. We advocate that preoperative coronary artery angiography and subsequent bypass grafting be performed on a selective rather than routine basis.\r"

We have used the isolated working rat heart model of cardiopulmonary bypass and ischemic arrest to assess whether allopurinol or oxypurinol, which should prevent free radical formation through their ability to inhibit xanthine oxidase, can improve postischemic myocardial recovery when the drugs are administered either chronically (pretreatment) or acutely (as an addition to the cardioplegic or reperfusion solution). With normothermic ischemic arrest, both drugs, when given either chronically or acutely, significantly improved postischemic recovery of function. However, under hypothermic conditions, allopurinol conferred no protection when given either as pretreatment or during reperfusion, but it was effective when added to the cardioplegic solution. When administered under the appropriate conditions, both allopurinol and oxypurinol enhanced the protective effect afforded by the St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution, possibly by inhibiting xanthine oxidase activity and preventing the formation of oxygen-derived free radicals.\r"
