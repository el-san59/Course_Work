Analysis of three members of the Anopheles punctulatus complex, 68,458 An. farauti, 36,779 An. koliensis, and 11,667 An. punctulatus caught in landing catches was made using monoclonal antibody based ELISAs to detect sporozoites of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax. Sporozoite rates ranged from 0%-5.5% in An. farauti, 0.2%-3.8% in An. koliensis, and 0%-3.3% in An. punctulatus. In addition, over 3,000 An. longirostris were analyzed and sporozoites were not detected in this species. No significant differences were observed between the three vector species in the densities of P. falciparum sporozoites (geometric mean 2,320). However, the geometric mean P. vivax sporozoite density was significantly higher in An. punctulatus (350) than in either An. koliensis (160) or An. farauti (150). An. koliensis was less susceptible to infections of P. falciparum or P. vivax than either An. farauti or An. punctulatus. Variations in average sporozoite and inoculation rates were found among different villages, despite their close geographic proximity. Sporozoite and inoculation rates varied greatly within a village over time, but malaria transmission was perennial with a higher transmission during the wet season by An. koliensis and An. punctulatus.\r"

  ".W": "The magnitude of the antibody response to three distinct and defined antigens of Plasmodium falciparum was assessed in 144 inhabitants of the Kassa district (Haut Ogooue Province, Gabon), a region where malaria is mesoendemic. Antibodies against a polypeptide consisting of 40 (Asn-Ala-Asn-Pro) repeats of P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein [(NANP)40] were detected by ELISA. Antibodies against the fusion peptide 31.1, which consists of the N-terminal portion of the 190-200 kDa glycoprotein, were also detected by ELISA. Antibodies against ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigens (RESA), mainly the P. falciparum 155 kDa antigen (Pf 155), were detected by IFA on glutaraldehyde-fixed P. falciparum infected red blood cells (IRBC). In addition, a standard IFA employing air-dried P. falciparum IRBC was used to detect antibodies against intraerythrocytic asexual forms. Parasitemia and spleen enlargement were also recorded. The frequency of sera positive for specific antibodies increased with age for all the antigens tested. Plateau antibody levels were reached at different ages for the different antigens. Individual antibody responses varied in titer to the different antigens. Subjects with parasite-negative thick smears showed higher titers of anti-31.1 as well as an increased frequency of anti-RESA antibodies compared to subjects having positive smears. No differences in the titer and in the prevalence of anti-(NANP)40 antibodies were found between these groups. The results suggest that the antibody response against asexual blood stage antigens, especially anti-RESA and anti-31.1, may play a role in controlling parasitemia.\r"

The effects of two antimalarial drugs, qinghaosu and chloroquine, on potassium, sodium, and phosphorus concentrations were studied. Malarial infection causes a decrease in potassium concentration and an increase in sodium concentration in the host red cells. The drastic change in the cation composition, however, occurs only in red cells infected by late stage parasites (late trophozoite and schizont). Red cells infected by early stage parasites (ring stage) show only small changes in sodium concentration. Furthermore, the noninfected red cells in parasitized cultures show no difference in composition from those of normal red cells. Treatment of the parasitized cultures with qinghaosu (10(-6) M) or chloroquine (10(-6) M) for 8 hr causes phosphorus concentration of both early and late parasites to decrease. An 8 hr treatment with qinghaosu also produces a reduction in potassium and an increase in sodium concentrations in early and late parasites. In contrast, 8 hr treatment with chloroquine only causes a change in the sodium and potassium concentrations of the late stage parasites and does not affect the early stage parasites.\r"

Results demonstrate that parasites resistant either to chloroquine, quinine, or mefloquine, or to two of these drugs, were prevalent in four of the areas investigated, but the drug response pattern varies widely from one area to another. The recent explosive emergence of chloroquine resistance in the south of the country, where both prevalences and levels are very high (up to 86%), contrasts with only moderate levels of resistance in the north. This may be related to differences in transmission by mosquitoes between Sahel and forest areas. Quinine resistance was observed in 24% of the isolates studied in vitro and was frequently associated with chloroquine resistance. The presence of isolates responding poorly to mefloquine, observed mainly in northern Cameroon, suggests that resistance may occur in areas where the drug has never been used.\r"

Twelve antigens were detected by antibodies in sera of bartonellosis patients using immunoblot, of which six antigens were detected by immunoprecipitation. Antigens 25, 46, 65, 75, 99, and 160 were identified as probable cell wall antigens. Antigens 50, 65, and 75 detected long-persisting antibodies. Crude Bartonella antigen applied to ELISA reacted with anti-Chlamydia psittaci antibody as well as with antibody of unknown identity in human sera, whereas immunoblot and immunoprecipitation with Triton soluble antigens revealed Bartonella-specific results. Seven Bartonella antigens were prepared by high performance liquid chromatography of which one antigen (48 kDa) reacted Bartonella-specific when applied to ELISA. It was concluded that specificity of antibody determination with crude Bartonella antigen should be confirmed by either immunoblot or immunoprecipitation.\r"

Chronic alcoholism produced no change in contents of cholesterol, total phospholipids, and proportions of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine in erythrocyte phospholipids. The mean values of the rates of acylation of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine with oleic acid were increased respectively by 59% (p less than 0.001) and 38% (p less than 0.05) as compared with the controls. There was no correlation between acylation rates and mean cellular volumes. Increases in acylation rates normalized over several weeks after alcohol withdrawal and were not related to a direct effect of alcohol on the intact erythrocyte, suggesting that these alterations result from ethanol-induced changes in the membrane during erythrocyte formation. The increased rates of acylation might modify the remodeling of the lipid matrix and thereby the membrane function.\r"

Patients who developed seizures or confusion were noted to score higher on the scale, even before these complications, than patients who remained uncomplicated (21.7 +/- 1.2 compared to 15.6 +/- 0.55). When the score was used as a guide for treatment, it was found that patients scoring greater than 15 were at significantly increased risk of severe alcohol withdrawal if they remained untreated (RR, 3.72; 95% confidence interval, 2.85-4.85). The higher the score the greater this relative risk. Some patients however, still suffered complicated withdrawals although their scores were low or they were apparently adequately treated. It is concluded that the use of an objective clinical scale of alcohol withdrawal is valuable in a general hospital to identify those patients in early withdrawal who need sedation to avoid complication. There will however, be a small group of patients whose clinical course will be difficult to predict and further work is needed to determine the reasons for this.\r"

The procedures employed replicated those of a previous study in which FHP subjects showed diminished P300 potentials compared to FHN subjects under the placebo as well as ethanol consumption conditions--a finding which raised the possibility that the P300 ERP component might be a biological marker for subjects at high risk to develop alcoholism. No differences between the family history groups were obtained for the P300 or any other ERP component using the replication procedures.

Binge drinking was associated with current mood, while daily/weekend drinking was associated with low self-esteem. Both measures were associated with the consequences of alcoholism.

The extent to which environmental stress can modify alcohol preference was studied by coupling acute episodes of poisoning with restricted fluid availability, and recovery with free choice of drinking fluids. Addition of actinomycin D, a mycotoxin, to ordinary chow during 2-day periods produced acute episodes of nonlethal food poisoning from which the mice recovered rapidly. Consumption of a 10% alcohol solution and of water was recorded for several weeks before poisoning and for several weeks after the last episode. By varying drinking fluids available to the mice during the episodes of poisoning, long-lasting changes in alcohol preference were produced. When 10% alcohol was the sole drinking fluid available during poisoning, preference for the alcohol solution was abolished. When water was the sole fluid during poisoning, alcohol preference was increased above the already high levels established in the baseline and above a control group that was restricted to water during the treatment periods but was not poisoned. This increased alcohol preference was due to a nearly complete suppression of water intake in the posttreatment period; there was no significant increase in amount of alcohol consumed. The greatest individual differences in subsequent alcohol preference were found in the group of mice which continued to have free choice of alcohol and water during episodes of poisoning. The variety of responses to the same treatment show how environmental influences outside the experimenter's control may account for the variability found in voluntary alcohol consumption among genetically homogeneous mice.\r"

After learning to discriminate the 1.0 g dose, the animals' ability to discriminate doses of 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.0, and 1.5 g/kg was assessed by determining the percentage of responses made on the drug lever during a 2-min test period. Compared to sucrose controls, mice exposed to alcohol in utero learned the lever response more slowly and were less responsive to injected ethanol as evidenced by a reduced effect of the drug on response rates and by a reduction in their ability to discriminate the presence of injected ethanol. The results indicate that prenatal ethanol exposure can have long term consequences which reduce the effects of ethanol in fully mature animals.\r"

A brief Preoccupation with Alcohol Scale (PAS) was derived that exhibited substantial internal consistency. Data from a sample of the 67 males indicated that higher PAS scores were significantly related to alcohol consumption and frequency of intoxication within many different contextual circumstances. The PAS was also related to alcohol problems after controlling for average daily alcohol consumption and frequency of intoxication, suggesting that scores on the PAS are related to, but not redundant with, level of alcohol consumption. Results from a cross-validation sample provided additional support for these findings. The authors suggest that a preoccupation with alcohol may be a cognitive-behavioral risk factor for the development of severe alcohol problems and alcoholism.\r"

  ".W": "Self-reported patterns of alcohol and drug use were examined in gynecological outpatients (n = 1967). Seventeen percent were heavy drinkers, 14% regularly used psychoactive drugs with the potential for nonmedical use, and over 3% both drank heavily and regularly used psychoactive drugs. Significantly higher alcohol intakes (mean usual number of drinks per occasion was 3.6 compared to 3.1, p less than 0.01) and more heavy drinkers (26% compared to 19%, based on quantity-frequency, p less than 0.01) were associated with regular psychoactive drug use. However, the relationship between other measures of alcohol use and regular psychoactive drug use varied as a function of age, marital status, and employment status. Regular psychoactive drug use was significantly elevated among outpatients who were in their fifties, retired/other (not housewives, employed, or looking for work, e.g. students or disabled), not married, or white. The risk of regular psychoactive drug use was more than 1.5 times higher among heavy drinkers than among nonheavy drinkers. It is estimated that there are over 35 million gynecologic office visits per year; therefore, increased case-finding in this population has the potential to reach large numbers of women at risk who otherwise might not be identified.\r"

Insulin administration failed to stimulate the reduced ADH activity in diabetic rats. However, ADH activity in the diabetic-fed rats decreased by 52-54% (p less than 0.001) compared to normal-fed rats regardless of whether they were meal-fed or refed the normal chow. Glucagon blocked by 15% (p less than 0.02) the increase in ADH activity associated with refeeding. Furthermore, insulin caused a marginal stimulation of ethanol elimination rate (EER) when administered to fasted rats. All these results imply that insulin and glucagon may not be the only determining factors in the control of liver ADH activity associated with fasting and refeeding. Meal-feeding or refeeding a high carbohydrate fat-free diet compared to the normal chow-diet caused 29% (p less than 0.001) and 36% (p less than 0.05) decreases in ADH activity, respectively. Concomitant decreases in EER caused by high carbohydrate fat-free diet feeding were also observed under identical conditions. These results raise the possibility that the amount and the type of carbohydrate may be crucial in the regulation of ADH and EER. Alternatively, the presence of fat may be important in maintaining the normal level of ADH and EER.\r"

C57BL/6J mice were administered an acute dose of alcohol (5.8 g/kg orally) or isocaloric sucrose on day 10 of gestation. One half of each group was placed for 6 hr in an incubator set at 32 degrees C and the other half was housed in the incubator at room temperature (22 degrees C). As expected, acute prenatal alcohol exposure at this time of gestation was associated with decreased birth weight and an increase in limb and kidney malformations. The significant alcohol x environmental temperature interaction on these dependent variables indicated that the teratogenic insult was not attenuated, but was in fact even greater for the 32 degrees C/alcohol group. An absence of a main effect of environmental temperature indicated that the 32 degrees C environment, per se, was not teratogenic. Thus, maternal hypothermia is probably not an etiological factor in animal models of fetal alcohol syndrome. Moreover, antagonism of alcohol-induced maternal hypothermia exacerbates the teratogenic actions of alcohol observed at room temperature.\r"

The model best approximates the human situation for length of gestation and type of placentation, coupled with the ability to control for nutritional factors. All mothers received 110% of their minimum daily caloric requirements as a balanced, nutritionally complete diet, including a minimum of 3.5 mg zinc per day. Over a 2-year period, maternal hair samples from 17 pregnancies (using 12 females) were obtained at term. There were 16 live, full-term neonates (nine ethanol exposed and seven control) from whom samples were taken within 1 hr of birth. The ethanol-exposed infant monkeys had a significantly higher incidence of craniofacial dysmorphology and developmental delay compared to the controls. There was no difference in hair zinc levels between ethanol-exposed and control animals for either the mothers or the newborns. Neonatal levels were, however, consistently higher than corresponding maternal. Although the findings cannot exclude transient or early gestational zinc deficiency as a factor, they provide further evidence that ethanol (and/or its metabolites) is the proximate toxin in the type of fetal injury seen in the fetal alcohol syndrome.\r"

The depression of aldehyde dehydrogenase activity not only persisted, but became more marked after 2 weeks of abstinence, while the enhanced activities of the two other enzymes returned to normal. These observations suggest that chronic alcohol ingestion suppresses aldehyde dehydrogenase in the bone marrow, while it enhances other erythrocytic enzymes.\r"

The upper limit of normal CDT levels was 80 mg/liter (2 SD above the mean). CDT values exceeding this level were found in more than 80% of Black, Puerto Rican, and Caucasian alcoholics who had consumed greater than or equal to 50 g of alcohol/day for 1 month or longer prior to testing. Puerto Rican alcoholics had higher CDT values than the Black and Caucasian ethnic groups; however, these differences were significant only when compared to the Black population. Of 64 patients with nonalcoholic liver diseases, one individual with chronic active hepatitis (CAH) with an alcohol consumption of 20 g/day, and 10 of 26 subjects with primary biliary cirrhoses (PBC), who claimed to consume either no or only occasional moderate amounts of alcohol, had CDT levels ranging from 81 to 144 mg/liter. Seven of these individuals were in advanced stages of PBC. Total transferrin levels were variable and not significantly different in all subject groups studied. CDT/total transferrin ratios were increased in most patients with abnormal amounts of CDT, and there was a significant correlation between these ratios and CDT levels in all study groups. Serum enzyme parameters as well as red blood cell mean corpuscular volumes did not correlate with CDT values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Control groups received a diet of lab chow and water and were sacrificed at comparable survival times. An additional experimental group was given ethanol until 9 days after the lesion, then switched to lab chow and water and sacrificed 1 day later. Coronal sections through the dorsal hippocampal formation were stained and analyzed histochemically for the localization of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Quantitative measurements of the histochemical patterns in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus were obtained. Ethanol exposure inhibited the withdrawal of the acetylcholinesterase-stained septohippocampal fibers and limited the typical lesion-induced expansion of the pale-staining commissural/associational zone in the molecular layer of the denervated dentate gyrus. However, abstinence from ethanol for just 24 h released the inhibitory effect on the acetylcholinesterase-staining fibers, resulting in a significant expansion of the commissural/associational zone.\r"

  ".W": "Prenatal exposure to ethanol causes profound disruptions in the development of the cerebral cortex. Therefore, the effect of in utero ethanol exposure on the generation of neurons was determined. Pregnant rats were fed a liquid diet in which ethanol constituted 37.5% of the total caloric content (Et) or pair-fed an isocaloric control diet (Ct) from gestational day (GD) 6 to the day of birth. The time of origin of cortical neurons was determined in the mature pups of females injected with [3H]thymidine on one day during the period from GD 10 to the day of birth. The brains were processed by standard autoradiographic techniques. Ethanol exposure produced multiple defects in neuronal ontogeny. The period of generation was 1-2 days later for Et-treated rats than for rats exposed prenatally to either control diet. Moreover, the generation period was 1-2 days longer in Et-treated rats. The numbers of neurons generated on a specific day was altered; from GD 12-19 significantly fewer neurons were generated in Et-treated rats than in Ct-treated rats, whereas after GD 19 more neurons were born. The distribution of neurons generated on a specific day was disrupted; most notable was the distribution of late-generated neurons in deep cortex of Et-treated rats rather than in superficial cortex as they are in controls. Cortical neurons in Et-treated rats tended to be smaller than in Ct-treated rats, particularly early generated neurons in deep cortex. The late-generated neurons in Et-treated rats were of similar size to those in Ct-treated rats despite their abnormal position in deep cortex. Neurons in Ct-treated rats tended to be rounder than those in Et-treated rats which were more polarized in the radial orientation. A proliferation index, which was based on the amount of autoradiographic signal over each labeled neuron, indicated that an additional, late surge in proliferative activity occurred in Et-treated rats on GD 20-21. The amount of [3H]thymidine incorporated each day was determined by biochemical analyses. In Ct-treated rats, incorporation increased to a maximum on GD 17 and decreased thereafter. In Et-treated rats, there were two maxima, the first on GD 18 and the second on GD 20. These data fully support the findings of the autoradiographic analyses. The present data show that neuronal generation is profoundly affected by ethanol. Such disturbances result from ethanol-induced abnormalities in neuronal proliferation and migration.\r"

When determined by a new, simplified assay, CDT values are nearly normally distributed in low- or non-alcohol-consuming control populations. The importance of transferrin phenotype for this normal variation was analyzed in 100 healthy, European men and women with no or negligible alcohol intake. No significant relation was found between phenotype and CDT value in this population. The three rare B-variants found had low CDT levels, and one subject, examined outside the study, with a rare D-variant indicated that D-variants may result in false-positive CDT values. Moreover, women tended to have somewhat higher values than men, in whom CDT levels were weakly correlated with age. Other as yet undefined biological factors are clearly responsible for the major part of the normal variation of CDT values in nonalcoholic individuals.\r"

In four patients with left ventricular (LV) catheters, the PAOP correlated with the LV end-diastolic pressure during both MV and SV. Gated blood pool imaging showed SV increased the LV end-diastolic volume index (65 +/- 24 to 83 +/- 32/M2, P less than .002) with LV ejection fraction unchanged. Patients were treated for a mean of 10 days with diuretics, resulting in a reduction of blood volume (4.55 +/- 0.9 1 to 3.56 +/- 0.55 1) and body weight (-5 kg, P less than .001). Subsequently, nine of the 15 patients were weaned successfully from mechanical ventilation with unchanged PAOP.\r"

TCAs are located predominantly in the supratentorial compartment and are classified as either \"true\" or \"false.\" A true aneurysm is a dilation resulting from partial disruption of the arterial wall. A false aneurysm results from a full-thickness tear, with the scar from the brain tissue or an organized hematoma acting as the aneurysmal wall. The authors present a case of a false traumatic aneurysm of the pericallosal artery, which was discovered in a young patient fourteen months after a self-inflicted gunshot wound to his head. The aneurysm was an incidental finding on a CT scan performed for the investigation of his late posttraumatic seizures. Its presence was confirmed by angiography. The interval between the traumatic episode and the diagnosis of a TCA usually ranges from a few hours to a few weeks, for most are discovered by angiography performed in the acute or subacute stage of a head injury. The long interval between the injury and the diagnosis in our case is exceptional. A previous CT scan done four months after the injury did not reveal the aneurysm, which strongly suggests a protracted growth of the aneurysmal sac long after the trauma.\r"

  ".W": "The approach to patients with cardiac arrhythmias involves four steps: diagnosis, determination of whether therapy is needed, choice of appropriate treatment, and evaluation of efficacy of therapy. Factors affecting the decision to treat a patient include the presence and type of symptoms associated with the tachyarrhythmia, as well as the frequency with which the arrhythmia occurs. Antiarrhythmic drugs are usually recommended as first-line therapy although nonpharmacologic approaches are preferable in certain specific situations. There are minimal data for most arrhythmias that aid the physician in the selection of a specific drug for a given patient, and many agents will often be equally effective. Most often drugs are selected that have the least potential to produce harmful side effects to the patient; thus, choice of therapy must be individualized. Newer agents are effective but their antiarrhythmic and side effect profiles will not be understood fully until they have been used widely in diverse patient populations. Regardless of which drug is prescribed, invasive or noninvasive methods should be employed to evaluate therapeutic efficacy.\r"

The pharmacology of procainamide and its basic electrophysiologic properties, dosage schedules, and toxicity are discussed. Finally, the current indications for its use are reviewed.\r"

  ".W": "Although procainamide (PA) has been widely used to treat patients with both ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias since 1951, more than twenty years elapsed before N-acetylprocainamide (NAPA) was identified as a major PA metabolite and shown in PA-treated patients to have plasma concentrations generally equaling or being 2 to 3 times greater than those of the parent drug. Numerous investigations have been conducted since then to characterize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of NAPA and to compare these properties with those of PA. Salient differences have been that the elimination half-life of NAPA is 2.5 times that of PA, even when renal function is normal; that NAPA has a spectrum of electrophysiologic action that differs from PA in that NAPA only prolongs action potential duration; and that NAPA is less likely than PA to cause a syndrome resembling systemic lupus erythematosus. Although these properties have provided an impetus for the development of NAPA as an antiarrhythmic drug in its own right, emphasis is placed in this review on the implications of these findings for individualizing PA therapy.\r"

  ".U": "88308067\r", 
  ".W": "The purpose of this review is to discuss the role of mexiletine, tocainide, flecainide, and amiodarone in the treatment of patients with symptomatic ventricular ectopy or sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) and fibrillation (VF). The pharmacologic properties, electrophysiologic effects, clinical efficacy, adverse reactions, and costs of these new agents are compared with those of procainamide, quinidine, and disopyramide. With the exception of more convenient dosing intervals, these new agents do not afford novel or advantageous pharmacologic properties. The incidences and severity of adverse reactions are similar to those reported with conventional antiarrhythmic drugs. Results of clinical studies demonstrate that these newer drugs are comparable to procainamide, quinidine, and disopyramide in suppressing ventricular ectopy. Accordingly, the choice of an antiarrhythmic agent for patients with symptomatic ventricular ectopy can be based on the side-effect profile. The propensity for developing certain adverse effects can be defined if patients are subgrouped by age and left ventricular function. The adverse effects of amiodarone preclude its use in patients manifesting only ventricular ectopy. Treatment of patients with sustained VT/VF is more complex. Mexiletine and tocainide are generally not effective. The efficacy of flecainide is similar to that of procainamide, quinidine, and disopyramide. The negative inotropic effects of flecainide and disopyramide preclude their use in patients with severe ventricular dysfunction. Amiodarone is the most effective of these drugs for preventing recurrences of sustained VT/VF. Its use should, however, be restricted to patients refractory or intolerant to other antiarrhythmic drugs.\r"

The lack of practical therapeutic guidelines prompted us to consolidate our observations on 124 cyanotic adults for general physicians, cardiologists, and hematologists who care for these patients. Specific attention focused on regulation of erythrocyte mass and concepts of compensated and decompensated erythrocytosis, symptoms of deficient tissue oxygen transport, hyperviscosity and iron deficiency, the potential relation between elevated hematocrit levels and brain injury, hemostasis, urate metabolism, and renal function. Cerebral infarction was not seen in any patient. Phlebotomy is best reserved for treatment of symptomatic hyperviscosity. Iron therapy is indicated for symptomatic iron deficient erythropoiesis. Abnormal hemostatic mechanisms are the rule. Antithrombotic medications have little or no role in treatment. Hyperuricemia is the result of abnormal renal uric acid excretion not urate overproduction, and serves as a marker of abnormal renal function. Drugs that promote urate excretion are the preferred maintenance treatment in symptomatic hyperuricemic patients.\r"

In the present studies we evaluated the hypothesis that excitatory amino acids, acting at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, contribute to secondary tissue damage following traumatic spinal cord injury. Administration of NMDA, adjacent to the trauma site, significantly worsened the outcome after thoracic cord injury in rats, whereas its stereoisomer, N-methyl-L-aspartate (NMLA), was without effect. Systemic treatment with MK-801--a selective, centrally active, NMDA antagonist--significantly improved neurological outcome after trauma. These findings extend the excitotoxin concept to central nervous system trauma and indicate that NMDA antagonists may be beneficial in the treatment of traumatic spinal cord injury.\r"

Biopsy specimens taken later showed vascular congestion and still proliferated synovial lining cells, fewer polymorphonuclear neutrophils in some, and a tendency toward increased infiltration with lymphocytes and plasma cells. Electron microscopy of samples from 8 patients during the first month of disease activity showed occlusion of vessels by platelets in 4, and fibrin or dense granular material in the vessel walls in 4. Five of the patients with arthritis of less than 4 weeks duration had unidentified intracellular and extracellular particles; some of these were highly suggestive of Chlamydia. No such particles were noted in samples from patients with more chronic cases. Using an antibody to Chlamydia trachomatis and the peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique, immunocytochemistry showed reaction product in synovial macrophages in 2 patients with arthritis of less than 4 weeks duration, but not in the 1 patient studied who had more chronic disease. These studies provide support for dramatic synovial vascular injury consistent with that caused by endotoxin and the presence of chlamydial antigen in synovial macrophages, at least in the early phases of synovitis.\r"

  ".W": "Doppler ultrasound was used to assess the pressure drop between the ventricles in 109 infants and children (61 less than two years old) with a ventricular septal defect who underwent cardiac catheterisation. The pressure in both ventricles was measured at catheterisation in 103 patients either simultaneously through two catheters (41) or with a single catheter withdrawn across the septum or removed from one ventricle to the other (62). When pressure was measured simultaneously with two catheters (41 patients) the peak to peak and instantaneous gradients showed a maximum difference of 20 mm Hg with levels within 10 mm Hg of each other in 36. Comparison of the difference in the gradients with the average of the measurements demonstrated a tendency for Doppler to underestimate the difference when it was high (greater than 50 mm Hg) and overestimate it when it was low. A Doppler estimate of a low pressure difference between the ventricles indicates pulmonary arterial hypertension and a high one low pulmonary artery pressure, but in the intermediate group Doppler is as yet not sufficiently sensitive to allow selection of those patients who require further investigation and possible operation. Doppler ultrasound was found to be a sensitive method of detecting a very small ventricular septal defect. Thus although Doppler is a very useful means of assessing and following patients with a ventricular septal defect, further studies are required to determine its exact place in clinical practice.\r"

Aortic regurgitation was detected in only one of the eighteen patients, a markedly lower frequency than that reported after two stage anatomical correction. Peak velocities in the pulmonary artery were higher than normal, and in most cases there was some degree of stenosis of the pulmonary artery at the site of anastomosis.\r"

For smoking, there is no good experimental evidence that cessation reduces the risk of IHD, but there are good observational data to show that those who choose to cease have a lower mortality from IHD, and all causes of death, compared with those who continue to smoke. For arterial pressure, none of the randomized controlled trials has shown any benefit from a reduction in arterial pressure in relation to IHD, although the same studies have shown that risk of stroke is reduced substantially. The best trial evidence for risk factor reduction is seen for serum cholesterol, and in all three major placebo control trials, reduction was associated with a corresponding decrease in the incidence of IHD; for each 1% decrease in serum cholesterol concentration there was a 3% reduction in risk of IHD. However, total mortality was unchanged, and in the case of the WHO Co-Operative Study there was a statistically significant excess of deaths in the treatment group. The use of drugs in the primary prevention of IHD is a matter of judgement based on the risk of disease, the efficacy of the treatment and side effects.\r"

Both indomethacin and aspirin inhibited the secretion of alkaline phosphatase and the uptake of [3H]thymidine by osteoblasts in a dose-dependent fashion at therapeutic concentrations. Both drugs also inhibited insulin- and 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol-stimulated alkaline phosphatase production and [3H]thymidine uptake by human osteoblasts.

The early radiation effects on the normal tissues were similar and acceptable. The late skin changes in the chest wall (treated with 70 kV X rays) were progressive and by 10 years were slightly more marked with 6 fractions. Late subcutaneous fibrosis in the axilla (treated with cobalt-60 teletherapy), however, was much less in the 6-fraction group. Twelve fractions resulted in greater restriction of shoulder movement and an increased incidence of lymphoedema of the arm. Doses were selected on the basis of past clinical experience. The dose used to treat the axilla in 6 fractions was 35 Gy, 14.99% less than that predicted by NSD. The dose predicted by alpha:beta, using a value of 2 Gy for late reactions, is 38.14 Gy. Thus simple theory, which omits time, still predicts too high a dose for 6 fractions, although it is closer than NSD. In this trial, the 6-fraction technique showed an advantage over the 12-fraction technique. It was equally effective in controlling local recurrence and had fewer late sequelae. It was also convenient for patients and economic in the use of radiotherapy resources.\r"

Plain X-rays of the renal tracts (KUB films) were also studied to establish whether the prevalence of spina bifida occulta was increased in this group of patients and was a likely explanation for the nerve defects. Forty-three patients were found to have abnormal neurophysiological responses and the prevalence of spina bifida occulta was 50%, which compares with a prevalence of 17% in normal female controls. Genuine stress incontinence appears to be at least partly associated with defective innervation of the lower urinary tract and it is likely that in some cases the defect may be related to the presence of spina bifida occulta.\r"

Twenty-eight patients, 13 females and 15 males, completed two treatment periods of 2 weeks' duration. During the placebo period the weekly number of nocturia episodes was 13.8 and during bumetanide treatment the number was reduced by 3.8. Ten males had a history of prostatic hypertrophy and in these patients treatment with bumetanide was not beneficial. In the remaining 18 patients the weekly number of nocturia episodes was reduced by 4 during bumetanide treatment compared with the placebo period. Of these patients, 3 preferred treatment with placebo, 11 preferred bumetanide and 4 gave no preference. These results suggest that bumetanide offers an alternative in the treatment of adult nocturia not connected with enlargement of the prostate.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical features of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are similar to those of infections of the bowel, although their cause is uncertain. Many bacteria that cause intestinal diseases adhere to the gut mucosa, and adhesion of pathogenic Escherichia coli is resistant to D-mannose. The adhesive properties of isolates of E coli were assessed by assay of adhesion to buccal epithelial cells with mannose added. The isolates were obtained from patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (50 with a relapse of ulcerative colitis, nine with ulcerative colitis in remission, 13 with Crohn's disease, and 11 with infectious diarrhoea not due to E coli) and 22 controls. The median index of adhesion to buccal epithelial cells (the proportion of cells with more than 50 adherent bacteria) for E coli from patients with ulcerative colitis in relapse was significantly higher (43%) than that for controls (5%) and patients with infectious diarrhoea (14%). The index was not significantly different among isolates from patients with ulcerative colitis in relapse, Crohn's disease (53%), and ulcerative colitis in remission (30%). If an index of adhesion of greater than 25% is taken as indicating an adhesive strain 86% of isolates of E coli from patients with inflammatory bowel disease were adhesive compared with 27% from patients with infective diarrhoea and none from controls. The adhesive properties of the isolates from patients with inflammatory bowel disease were similar to those of pathogenic intestinal E coli, raising the possibility that they may have a role in the pathogenesis of the condition; the smaller proportion of adhesive isolates in patients with infective diarrhoea due to other bacteria suggests that the organism may be of primary importance rather than arising secondarily.\r"

After a four week placebo washout period 53 patients with diastolic blood pressures between 90-110 mm Hg were randomly assigned to 50, 125, or 500 micrograms cyclopenthiazide or matching placebo for an eight week period of treatment. Blood pressure was measured in the patients' homes by the same observer every two weeks. Serum urea, electrolytes, urate, and creatinine concentrations and 24 hour urinary sodium excretion were monitored every four weeks and serum magnesium concentration and plasma renin activity at the end of the washout and treatment periods. After eight weeks of treatment systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly reduced in patients taking 125 and 500 micrograms cyclopenthiazide when compared with those taking placebo. The decrement in serum potassium concentration (0.6 mmol/l) and increase in serum urate concentration 0.06 mmol/l) were greatest with the 500 micrograms dose, the increase in serum urate concentration alone being significant. No change in serum magnesium concentration or 24 hour urinary sodium excretion was noted with any dose of cyclopenthiazide. Only the 500 micrograms dose of cyclopenthiazide significantly increased the mean plasma renin activity (1.8 (95% confidence interval 0.2 to 3.4)-5.4 (3.9 to 6.8) nmol angiotensin I/l/h); the other doses like the placebo had no effect. Cyclopenthiazide 125 micrograms, a dose lower than is currently marketed, produced a similar hypotensive response to 500 micrograms of the drug without upsetting the biochemical profile.\r"

DESIGN--Double blind, placebo controlled, random order crossover trial with two week practice run in period. SETTING--Outpatient clinic referrals in secondary referral centre. PATIENTS--39 children aged 2-6 years selected for the following: able to use Nebuhaler; parents able to complete record card; poorly controlled asthma (defined); not already on systemic or inhaled steroids. Eleven withdrew for various reasons not connected with intolerance to budesonide. Age, sex, other atopies, and symptoms during run in period were similar in the 28 children who completed the trial and in the 11 who withdrew. INTERVENTIONS--Budesonide 200 micrograms or placebo (both one puff) given twice daily during 6-week treatment or control periods, using Nebuhaler after prior training. Three week \"washout\" at crossover. Compliance monitored by weighing canisters. Patients withdrawn if their acute attacks required treatment with systemic steroids. END POINT--Control of asthma. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Peak expiratory flow rate measured twice daily where cooperation allowed. Diary of symptoms and concomitant drug use kept daily. Results showed mean peak flow significantly higher (12% in mornings, 14% in evenings) in second three weeks of intervention compared with control period (95% confidence intervals 6.3-17.3% and 7.2-21.0%). Supplementary bronchodilator drugs reduced by 50% during intervention periods. CONCLUSIONS--Budesonide given by Nebuhaler is effective prophylaxis for preschool children with frequent asthma.\r"

Various methods need to be used, and a study of both the acute haemodynamic and longer term symptomatic effects of flosequinan, a new direct acting arteriolar and venous vasodilator, was therefore carried out in patients with heart failure. In one group of patients flosequinan increased cardiac output and caused a fall in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, both effects lasting for 24 hours. In a double blind, placebo controlled study in another group flosequinan improved mean exercise tolerance from 9.9 to 12.7 minutes after four weeks of treatment. The drug also reduced perceived exertion during submaximal exercise and increased calf and therefore skeletal muscle blood flow. It reduced plasma renin activity and noradrenaline concentrations. Flosequinan possesses all the important properties of a drug likely to be of value in the treatment of heart failure.\r"

The study used a double blind, placebo controlled block design with a placebo run in period of two months followed by three phases of active treatment, each of two months' duration. Patients were randomly allocated to one of the six possible sequences of medication so that three patients would be treated with each sequence. Two patients withdrew from the study before completion. The median concentration of total cholesterol decreased from 9.65 mmol/l (interquartile range 8.62 to 8.72) to 7.24 mmol/l (6.70 to 7.52) with cholestyramine, to 8.09 mmol/l (7.18 to 8.68) with bezafibrate, and to 6.31 mmol/l (5.84 to 7.27) with the combination. This fall was due almost entirely to a decrease in the low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration, and the combination was significantly more effective than either drug alone. The 98% confidence intervals for the median differences between the combination and cholestyramine and the combination and bezafibrate were 0.04 to 1.49 mmol/l and 0.51 to 2.18 mmol/l respectively. These results suggest that this combination is an effective and useful treatment in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia.\r"

Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed on 25 patients positive for HIV antibody with clinically suspected pneumocystis pneumonia and 40 patients negative for HIV antibody who presented with interstitial disorders of the lung. Lavage fluid showed pneumocystis only in the patients positive for antibody, the parasite being detected in 19 by immunofluorescence and in 17 by a modified silver methenamine staining method. Chest x ray films obtained at the time of bronchoscopy showed interstitial or alveolar shadowing in 17 of the 19 patients, but clinical symptoms and the presence of antibodies to pneumocystis did not seem to be predictive. Sputum samples were collected during 43 episodes of clinically suspected pneumocystis pneumonia in patients positive for HIV antibody. Pneumocystis was detected consistently more commonly by immunofluorescence than the silver strain in sputum collected routinely and induced by inhalation of saline. In 17 patients bronchoalveolar lavage followed sputum collection, and the sensitivity of detection of pneumocystis in immunofluorescence in sputum compared with lavage fluid was 57% (8/14). Immunofluorescence was suitable for specimens fixed in ethanol and seemed highly specific and more sensitive than the standard cytochemical methods for identifying pneumocystis.\r"

Treatment with a combination of amodiaquine 25 mg/kg over three days plus doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for five days cleared their blood of Plasmodium falciparum. They were then randomly divided into the following three groups matched for age and sex: one group slept under mosquito nets; one group received one or two tablets (100 mg each) of proguanil hydrochloride daily according to weight; one group received one or two placebo tablets daily which were the same size and colour as the proguanil tablets. Malaria was diagnosed when asexual P falciparum were seen on blood films and was treated with pyrimethamine-sulphadoxine. At the end of one school term 188 of the 190 students had completed the study. One new infection was found during 3893 days of follow up in the mosquito net group, eight new infections over 3667 days in the proguanil group, and 35 new infections over 3677 days in the placebo group, representing a reduction of 97.3% and 77.1% in attack rates for the mosquito net method and for treatment with proguanil respectively. Both provide effective protection from malaria.\r"

  ".W": "Recent epidemiologic studies have shown that rates of cardiovascular disease are lower in populations such as the Greenland Eskimos than in those that do not eat seafood, even though the levels of dietary fat intake are often similar. Dietary fish oils are rich in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), a polyunsaturated fatty acid of the omega-3 series. EPA has been shown to prolong bleeding time and to decrease platelet aggregation and blood viscosity. EPA inhibits the production of prostaglandins from endogenous arachidonic acid, which is associated with the formation of thromboxane A2 and may also dampen cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenase metabolites involved in mediating endothelial cell proliferation. Dietary fish oils are now available in the form of EPA-enriched capsules. Short-term trials in humans have shown that EPA significantly reduces the levels of plasma triglycerides and may increase the levels of high-density lipoproteins; however, no consistent effect on serum cholesterol levels has been shown. The results of evaluations of EPA's use in patients with renal disorders, mild hypertension, inflammatory disorders or hyperlipidemia have been promising. On the basis of the epidemiologic and biologic evidence dietary fish oils warrant further study in extensive clinical trials.\r"

  ".W": "Despite the increasing incidence of acute non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, controversy remains regarding its validity as a distinct pathophysiologic physiologic and clinical entity. Review of the data indicates that the controversy is more apparent than real. The pathophysiologic factor discriminating best between non-Q-wave and Q-wave infarction is the incidence rate of total occlusion of the infarct-related artery, approximately 30% in non-Q-wave infarction and 80% in Q-wave infarction. Patients with non-Q-wave infarction have a higher incidence of pre-existing angina than patients with Q-wave infarction; they also have lower peak creatine kinase levels, higher ejection fractions and lower wall-motion abnormality scores, which suggests a smaller area of acute infarction damage. However, patients with non-Q-wave infarction have a significantly shorter time to peak creatine kinase level and more heterogeneous ventriculographic and electrocardiographic infarct patterns. The in-hospital death rate is lower in non-Q-wave than in Q-wave infarction (approximately 12% v. 19%). The long-term death rates are similar for the two groups (27% and 23%), but the incidence of subsequent coronary events is higher among patients with non-Q-wave infarction; in particular, reinfarction is an important predictor of risk of death. Most of the differences in biologic and clinical variables between the two types of acute infarction can be related to a lower incidence of total occlusion, earlier reperfusion or better collateral supply in non-Q-wave infarction. Further study is needed to better characterize the long-term risk and to define the most appropriate therapies.\r"

The positive reactivity of MoAb HMSA-2 with amelanotic melanomas was exemplified by two shave-biopsy specimens of amelanotic subungual and plantar lesions, and by two cases of axillary and cervical amelanotic nodes that were left undiagnosed on routine hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) sections because of lack of melanin pigments. These were found, after diagnosis with MoAb HMSA-2, to possess the regressed primary lesions (both ALM).\r"

  ".W": "The prevalence of endocrine differentiation of conventional gastric adenocarcinoma was evaluated on the 212 cases (including 62 mucosal carcinomas) of consecutively resected stomach for adenocarcinoma in our hospital using anti-chromogranin A (CGA) antibodies. CGA-positive cells were found in 28 of 150 cases (18.7%) as an integral tumor component. In immunocytochemistry and electron microscopic examinations, we could classify these 28 cases into three groups according to the distribution patterns of CGA-positive cells. The first group consisted of 12 cases in which scattered CGA-positive cells were located in neoplastic glands. The second group consisted of six cases of scirrhous carcinoma in which CGA-positive cells were separated by fibrovascular tissue. The third group consisted of ten cases in which the positive cells were present in clusters. No definite correlation was recognized between the appearance of CGA cells and histologic types of predominance. In the analysis of the hormonal substances coexpressed by CGA-positive cells, immunoreactive serotonin (SER) was found most frequently, and somatostatin (SS), gastrin (GAS), glucagon/glicentin (GLU/GLI), and peptide-tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY) like immunoreactivities were found in a few tumor cells. CGA-positive cells occupied limited parts of the tumors in most cases, and they were noticeably more frequent in advanced stage cases. This might explain why endocrine differentiation reflects the dysexpression of the neoplastic stem cells. Furthermore, absence of mitotic figures in this type of cell and negativity of a single colony composed exclusively of CGA cells in metastatic foci suggested that these cells are in a dormant phase and are probably postmitotic.\r"

In HCC sections the majority of tumor cells showed positive hybridization with a 3H-labeled AFP complementary DNA probe. The number of radioactive hybrid grains detected in HCC sections generally paralleled the level of serum AFP in the patient. In liver cirrhosis sections a small number of cells showed positive hybridization. These cells were dispersed in the tissue and morphologically indistinguishable from surrounding hepatocytes. Each of these cells contained a high level of hybridization signals to permit easy identification. In situ hybridization analysis of AFP mRNA may be of use in detecting preneoplastic cells in liver cirrhosis that cannot be defined on the morphologic and immunohistochemical basis.\r"

In addition to 85 neoplasms of testicular origin, the cases included eight ovarian germ cell tumors and 28 extragonadal neoplasms. All tissues had been subjected to formalin fixation and paraffin embedding. Similar immunoreactivity patterns were seen in gonadal and extragonadal neoplasms, gestational and nongestational choriocarcinomas, components of mixed germ cell tumors and their pure counterparts, and metastatic and primary lesions. Placental alkaline phosphatase was a sensitive marker of germ cell differentiation, and expression of this marker in the absence of EMA appeared to be a staining pattern unique to germ cell tumors. Both LCA and S100 were absent in neoplastic germ cells, and thus were useful in differentiating these tumors from malignant lymphoma and malignant melanoma, respectively. Cytokeratin was helpful in distinguishing seminomas/dysgerminomas from nonseminomatous germ cell tumors, although 10% of seminomas showed focal or diffuse cytokeratin reactivity. Finally, 75% of all germ cell neoplasms displayed NSE, calling the specificity of this determinant into question.\r"

Among the 102 Th-related hepatic malignancies, 44 (43.1%) were cholangiocarcinoma (CHC), 39 (38.3%) were angiosarcoma (AGS), 16 (15.7%) were hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and 3 (2.9%) were double cancer. In the non-Th-related cases approximately 90% were HCC, and AGS was very rare. Grossly, the majority (91.7%) of Th-related CHC was located in the middle-peripheral portion of the liver. In contrast, 77.8% of the non-Th-related cases were located in the hilar portion. Th-related AGS was classified into four types: diffuse micronodular, multi-nodular, massive, and mixed multi-nodular and massive. Histologically, AGS was characterized by two cell types (spindle-shaped cells and polyhedral cells) and three growth patterns (sinusoidal, cavernous, and solid). In noncancerous areas foci of varying degrees of sinusoidal dilatation with hyperplastic changes of sinusoidal lining cells were observed in all AGS cases and in some of the cases of Th-related CHC and HCC cases. In many (80%) of the non-Th-related HCC, mixed macronodular and micronodular cirrhosis was associated. By contrast, in Th-related HCC cases cirrhosis was superimposed on varying degrees of hepatic fibrosis related to Th deposition in only four cases (21.1%). Taken together, these findings suggest that Th influences are more carcinogenic to epithelial cells of the bile duct and sinusoidal lining cells than hepatocytes.\r"

  ".W": "K562 is a Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) blast crisis cell line representing a pluripotent precursor cell. At the molecular level, K562 cells express high levels of the aberrant bcr-abl product, p210bcr-abl, believed to be critical to the pathogenesis of CML. The authors demonstrate that exposure of K562 cells to hemin causes a state of partial, reversible erythroid maturation, accompanied by a marked decrease in p210bcr-abl. The change in bcr-abl expression may be mediated at the translational level since steady state amounts and enzymatic activity of the bcr-abl protein are reduced whereas bcr-abl mRNA levels are unaltered. The decrease in p210bcr-abl phosphokinase enzymatic activity can be detected within 2 hours after addition of hemin to the culture media, indicating that changes in expression of this oncogene probably occur before or concurrent with differentiation. No change in bcr-abl protein occurred in a CML cell line (KBM-5) which did not undergo differentiation after exposure to hemin, consistent with a direct relationship between altered p210bcr-abl expression and hemin-induced erythroid differentiation. Importantly, the marked diminution in bcr-abl protein was not associated with a disruption in K562 growth rates, indicating that the proliferative capacity of these cells may be independent of the bcr-abl product. In contrast to hemin, cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) caused terminal erythroid differentiation of K562 cells, characterized by irreversible hemoglobin accumulation and cytostasis; and no change in bcr-abl protein expression was observed. The distinct effects of Ara-C and hemin could reflect the existence of pleiotropic differentiation pathways. Both Ara-C and hemin-exposed cells showed a decrease in c-myc and c-myb transcripts, suggesting that altered levels of these proto-oncogenes may be associated with erythroid maturation, regardless of the rate of cell division. K562 cells provide a useful model for analyzing the interaction between oncogene expression and CML cell growth and differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of low-yield (filter) cigarette (LYC) smoking on lung cancer risk, by two broad histologic groupings (Kreyberg I [KI] and II [KII]), was examined in a large case-control study. Among males, there were 1278 KI patients and 2408 patient controls matched on age, race, hospital, and year of interview and 807 KII patients and 1543 matched patient controls. Among females, there were 513 KI patients and 960 matched patient controls and 499 KII patients and 932 matched patient controls. For the purposes of estimating the reduction in risk due to smoking filter rather than nonfilter cigarettes, odds ratios (OR) for smokers of filter cigarettes only, short-term switchers (i.e., switchers from non-filter to filter cigarettes who had smoked the latter for 1 to 9 years), and long-term switchers (i.e., switchers to filter cigarettes who had smoked filter cigarettes for 10+ years) were calculated relative to smokers of nonfilter cigarettes only (OR = 1.00). Logistic regression was used to obtain estimates adjusted for cigarettes per day (CPD), inhalation, age, and years of schooling. Filter-only smokers of both sexes appeared to have a reduced risk of KI lung cancer (OR = 0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37 to 1.27 in males; OR = 0.64, 0.30 to 1.35 in females). Male long-term switchers had a significantly reduced risk (OR = 0.66, 0.49 to 0.90), and female long-term switchers had a nonsignificant reduced risk of KI lung cancer (OR = 0.74, 0.40 to 1.36). The risks of short-term switchers were closer to 1.00 (OR = 0.83, 0.59 to 1.17 in males; OR = 0.99, 0.49 to 2.03 in females).

Through questionnaires designed for this study and standardized psychologic tests, women with segmentectomies responded as significantly less anxious, less sad, and more in control of their life events than women with mastectomies. The women with segmentectomies had a statistically more positive sexual and body image than those with mastectomies. The trauma of viewing the surgery was much greater in patients with mastectomies. The concern about cancer recurrence was less in the segmentectomy group. The differences in psychosexual adaptation to mastectomy or segmentectomy and the fears of cancer recurrence were significantly better in the segmentectomy group. The adequacies of cancer therapy was the same for both groups in the national study. This study restresses the importance of the segmentectomy option for women with breast cancer in leading to a better quality of life.\r"

Breakdown injuries related to training errors, shoe wear, or change in intensity are frequently seen by the sports medicine physician. In order to understand and treat the pathologic situation, a fundamental understanding of the biomechanics of walking and running is essential. The treating physician must appreciate the distinct differences between the walking and running gait. These differences transcend a simple increase in speed of gait and include distinct changes in joint range of motion and electromyographic activity. Armed with this knowledge, the physician treating a breakdown injury can work to a solution based on scientific understanding rather than anecdotal information.\r"

The challenge is intensified when the primary lesion is located in the foot, whose levers, arches, and pulleys are responsible for absorbing shock, as well as converting a mobile adapter into a rigid lever for propulsion. A thorough knowledge of these active and passive mechanisms is essential for the appropriate and expeditious management of overuse syndromes. Sports and dance medicine health practitioners must also explore and comprehend the kinesiology of the sports and/or dance activity prevalent among their clientele. Furthermore, in order to determine the etiology and make judicious recommendations, clinicians must familiarize themselves with the density and inclines of popular running and dancing surfaces within their referral area. Rehabilitation of the foot requires a multifaceted approach. Physical therapists dealing with these problems need to develop expertise in manual techniques, along with clinical competency in laser, electrical, and thermal modalities. Reduction of predisposing factors is of utmost importance in the successful management of overuse injuries, and often requires greater skill and attention than does the treatment of the primary lesion.\r"

In male, Sprague-Dawley rats, we studied the interaction of chronic atrioventricular heart block induced by transvenous electrocautery for 4-12 months (mean, 7 months) and age at study (12, 19 +/- 0.7, and 24 +/- 0.2 months) on cardiac hypertrophy and muscle function compared with age-matched, sham-operated controls. Hypertrophy was determined by the ratio of heart weight to tibial length. Muscle function was first determined from the mechanical variables of the isometric contraction of an excised, thin, left ventricular trabecular muscle bathed at 29 degrees C under a variety of calcium concentrations and stimulation patterns. Then, in the same muscles after disruption of membranes with Triton X-100, the force-pCa curve of the myofibrils was obtained. No hypertrophy occurred with aging in the control group, but alteration in hypertrophy with age occurred in the block group such that the youngest animals with block had the most hypertrophy (170%) and the oldest animals with block the least hypertrophy (120%). The tension developed by cardiac muscle and the duration of the isometric contraction were not affected by age in the control group but were significantly affected by age in the block group. The young animals with block had a markedly prolonged contraction duration and almost twice the developed tension compared with the older animals with block or with controls. The age-related difference in muscle contraction duration in the block group was associated with, and may have only been secondary to, the age-related difference in the extent of cardiac hypertrophy. For developed tension, the age-related difference in the block group could not be explained by differences in the extent of cardiac hypertrophy. Rather, this difference was attributable to both an increased myofibrillar force-generating capacity in the young block and to an impairment in excitation-contraction coupling in the old block. The results show that during long-term block, age exerted not only a significant effect on the extent of cardiac hypertrophy but also an independent effect on the developed tension of cardiac muscle.\r"

Used in patients with coronary artery disease, positron emission tomography has demonstrated sustained metabolic activity in regions with reduced blood flow and impaired contractile function, and it thereby enables differentiation between viable myocardium and myocardium that has succumbed to necrosis and scar formation. Viable myocardial regions identified by metabolic rather than functional or blood-flow criteria are frequently observed in patients after an acute coronary event and in patients with stable coronary artery disease. Positron emission tomography reflects either acute myocardial ischemia, \"hibernation,\" as well as \"myocardial stunning.\" Findings from metabolic imaging have proved useful in characterizing more accurately coronary artery disease and its functional consequences. These findings have been found equally useful for clinical management.\r"

Arteriography was not performed because of severe unstable angina requiring coronary artery bypass grafting (23 patients) or patient preference (two). Twelve patients were symptomatic, and 13 were asymptomatic but had severe (greater than or equal to 75%) bilateral or unilateral carotid artery stenosis. Operative and pathological analyses confirmed the duplex-scan findings in all 25 cases. All 25 patients survived the operation. One patient had a transient ipsilateral neurological deficit, and one had a permanent contralateral neurological deficit. Five patients died of ventricular arrhythmias within 30 days of operation. Duplex scanning is an accurate method for determining the presence of clinically and hemodynamically significant carotid arterial occlusive disease. Duplex scanning also serves as an alternative method for evaluating patients for whom carotid arteriography may be associated with significant risk.\r"

Electrophysiological studies data were correlated with histopathologic and biochemical findings from daily myocardial biopsies. Electrophysiological studies revealed no significant alteration of sinus or atrioventricular node function, refractoriness, or ventricular pacing threshold. However, ventricular voltage amplitude, measured through the electrodes, decreased steadily with time in all donor hearts and was significantly correlated with histopathologic rejection grade (p less than 0.001) and with adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) depletion (p less than 0.001). Ventricular voltage amplitude less than 75% of baseline occurred 4.5 +/- 1.5 days after transplantation, and this decreased voltage amplitude coincided with a moderate to severe (Grade 2 or 3) histological rejection pattern with a sensitivity of 89% (17 of 19) and a specificity of 77% (17 of 22). Similar changes in voltage amplitude were not found in control hearts. Myocardial tissue ATP values fell significantly from control values with early (Grade 1) rejection (p less than 0.05). Evidence for oxygen free radical injury was indicated by a rise in conjugated dienes of free fatty acids; this increase in diene level occurred 4.3 +/- 1.2 days postoperatively and then regressed during the terminal stages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

When sonography was compared with surgical findings (n = 90 shoulders), the overall accuracy was 95%. The sonographic diagnosis was the same as the arthrographic diagnosis in 91% of the cases (n = 50). Cuff lesions were also created in two cadavers, and images were made to confirm sonographic appearances. Because in the authors' experience sonography is accurate, safe, painless, rapid, and inexpensive, it has now been adopted as the primary study for the examination of the rotator cuff at the authors' institution. Arthrography is recommended in cases in which sonography is negative but there is significant clinical evidence of rotator cuff tear.\r"

After four weeks of implantation in 26-month-old rats, the cylinders were full of bone. This bone was assessed by histologic techniques, by calcium and bone gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (gla) protein (BGP) concentrations, and by alkaline phosphatase activity. Cylinders to which no cells were added produced no bone. Bone marrow cells enclosed in similar cylinders or injected weekly at the implantation site also enhanced new bone formation but to a much lesser extent. Embryonic muscle cells formed large amounts of cartilage and less bone. Fibroblasts were inactive in this system. Prior treatment of the DBM with trypsin inhibited the myoblast response but not that of calvaria cells.\r"

  ".W": "1. Two experiments were carried out. The first with five normal male subjects was placebo controlled and single blind, each subject being studied on two occasions. Lower body subatmospheric pressure (LBSP) was used to assess the cardiovascular effects of graded hypovolaemia before and during either a hyperinsulinaemic, euglycaemic clamp or a placebo clamp using 0.9% (w/v) NaCl only. 2. During hyperinsulinaemia, resting systolic blood pressure rose and was accompanied by forearm vasodilatation. Forearm blood flow (FABF) and heart rate (HR) were higher at each level of LBSP during than before hyperinsulinaemia. In addition, hyperinsulinaemia was accompanied by a small increase in noradrenaline, but packed cell volume did not change. 3. In the second experiment, the effects of a hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp on the cardiovascular responses to LBSP were assessed in seven diabetic subjects with peripheral and autonomic neuropathy. 4. In contrast to the normal subjects, there was a slight fall in systolic blood pressure during the clamp but no effect was noted on HR or FABF. Mean arterial blood pressure was lower at each level of LBSP during hyperinsulinaemia compared with the pre-clamp period. Packed cell volume fell during the clamp and plasma noradrenaline rose. In one of the diabetic subjects, a precipitous fall in blood pressure occurred during hyperinsulinaemia when LBSP of 10 mmHg (1.3 kPa) was applied, this manoeuvre having been well tolerated before the clamp. 5. The mode of action of hyperinsulinaemia is not clear, but there was, however, no evidence that a fall in plasma volume had occurred.\r"

Glomeruli from SHR were significantly less responsive to exogenous ANG II than those from NTR. 4. Sodium loading resulted in a significant increase in ANG II binding by glomeruli from NTR, whereas a decrease in binding occurred in glomeruli from SHR. 5. Although a high sodium intake caused a reduction in the response of glomeruli from both NTR and SHR to exogenous ANG II, these changes were not statistically significant. In NTR this was associated with a decrease in the concentration of agonist required to cause half-maximal response (EC50), whereas an increase in EC50 was shown by glomeruli from SHR.\r"

For discriminant analysis we used an ad hoc graphic (best case) method, a ceiling method based on highest PD in A and two methods (logistic and linear) which considered PDs in both N and A (PDN and PDA, respectively). The distribution of PDN and PDA had substantial overlap and appeared log normal. The PD15, PD20, and PD20C displayed the smallest mean misclassification error followed by PD10T, PD40, and PD10. The linear and logistic methods produced balanced sensitivity and specificity but, predictably, a misclassification error higher than that of the graphic method. The ceiling method proved unsatisfactory with 100 percent sensitivity but approximately equal to 60 percent specificity. Using linear and logistic methods, the posttest likelihood of asthma could be expressed as a function of its pretest likelihood and level of PD recorded. We concluded that: (1) the most discriminant PDs are PD20, PD15 and PD20c; and (2) new normative data for diagnostic bronchoprovocation are needed, because: (a) when PDA and PDN overlap, the currently used ceiling method leads to a high misclassification rate, while the linear and logistic method based on mathematical model have a better discriminant ability; (b) to separate PDA from PDN and allow the application of the ceiling method, \"as-needed bronchodilators\" is not a reproducible criterion.\r"

The response of the ejection fraction to exercise was better in patients with persistent T-wave inversion than in those with pseudonormalization (p less than 0.04). Mechanical evidence of ischemia was seen in 14 (61 percent) of the 23 patients with T-wave pseudonormalization but without ST-segment depression. In patients with resting T-wave inversion, pseudonormalization was slightly more sensitive but less specific than a positive exercise test for predicting significant new wall motion abnormalities or decreases in the ejection fraction with exercise. Although pseudonormalization is not extremely useful alone, the presence or absence of this finding can increase the diagnostic accuracy of exercise electrocardiography in patients with resting T-wave inversion and suspected ischemic heart disease.\r"

To evaluate a possible role for release of neutrophil chemotactic factor (NCF) in the pathogenesis of asbestosis, spontaneous NCF release from alveolar macrophages obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in eight individuals with asbestosis, 13 asbestos-exposed individuals without asbestosis, and five control subjects has been studied. Alveolar macrophages were incubated in medium (four hours; 37 degrees C), and neutrophil responses to the supernatants were assayed in a microchemotaxis chamber. Alveolar macrophages from subjects with asbestosis released more NCF (97 +/- 19 neutrophils per high-power field [N/HPF]) than controls (3 +/- 1 N/HPF; p less than 0.01). Alveolar macrophages from individuals with asbestos exposure and increased BAL neutrophil proportions (n = 7) released more NCF (93 +/- 24 N/HPF) than individuals with asbestos exposure and normal BAL neutrophil proportions (n = 6; 11 +/- 6 N/HPF; p less than 0.02). The results show that spontaneous NCF release occurs in asbestosis and that NCF release is associated with neutrophil alveolitis in asbestos-exposed individuals without asbestosis, suggesting a pathogenic role for NCF in mediating this neutrophil alveolitis. The results of the study also suggest that the presence of crackles is a better predictor of the presence of neutrophil alveolitis than is an abnormal chest x-ray film.\r"

  ".W": "Ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is often the appropriate therapy for treating patients with impaired pulmonary function after cardiac surgery procedures. Circulatory depression, however, sometimes limits the level of PEEP. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of PEEP ventilation (+15 cmH2O) immediately after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass 1) period of PEEP application and 45 min thereafter; 2) period of PEEP application on right ventricular hemodynamics using a new thermodilution technique for measuring right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF), right ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (RVEDV, RVESV). Forty patients undergoing aortocoronary bypass grafting were retrospectively divided into two groups: group 1 (n = 24) in which RVEF was reduced significantly (40----28 percent), and group 2 (n = 16) in which RVEF remained almost unchanged. In patients in group 1, stenosis of the right coronary artery (RCA) was significantly more pronounced in comparison to the others and was detected to be responsible for the different reaction of RVEF (analysis of co-variance). Application of PEEP immediately after weaning from CPB was followed by an increase in RVESV (+4 percent; RVEDV -1 percent) in group 1, whereas patients of group 2 differed significantly (RVESV -14 percent; RVEDV -15 percent). Cardiac index was decreased only in group 1 (-32 percent). During the second period of PEEP application, no further difference could be observed between the groups. We conclude that hemodynamic changes related to PEEP ventilation are minimal in the intact right ventricle. Abnormalities in right ventricular function due to stenosis of the RCA, however, have had marked clinical influence on the circulatory response. Monitoring of right ventricular function seems to be of benefit for cardiac surgery patients in this situation.\r"

The study included 38 brown pigment gallstone cases (28 without cholangitis and 10 with cholangitis). The proportion of unconjugated bilirubin in hepatic bile with cholangitis (16.9 +/- 8.5%, mean +/- SD) was significantly higher than that without cholangitis (3.7 +/- 1.8%, P less than 0.001). A positive correlation was found between bacterial population with beta-glucuronidase activity and the proportion of unconjugated bilirubin in bile in cases of brown pigment stones with cholangitis (P less than 0.05) but not in those without cholangitis despite the fact that bacterial species and population are similar regardless of the presence of cholangitis. In cholangitis, pH of bile becomes lower toward the optimal pH of bacterial beta-glucuronidase. Together the lower concentration of bile acid and the lower pH in bile result in lower solubility of unconjugated bilirubin, promoting its precipitation. Thus occasional bouts of cholangitis may result in periodic deposition of bilirubinate on brown pigment stones with layered structures by inducing cyclic changes of bile composition in situ.\r"

  ".W": "If 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring is to be a useful diagnostic tool, it must reliably discriminate gastroesophageal reflux patients despite daily variations in distal esophageal acid exposure. To address this issue, we studied 53 subjects (14 healthy normals, 14 esophagitis patients, and 25 patients with atypical symptoms) with two ambulatory pH tests performed within 10 days of each other. Intrasubject reproducibility of 12 pH parameters to discriminate the presence of abnormal acid reflux was determined. As a group, the parameters of percent time with pH less than 4 (total, upright, recumbent) were most reproducible (80%). Therefore, a subject was defined as having gastroesophageal reflux disease if at least one of these three values were abnormal. Intrasubject reproducibility for the diagnosis of reflux disease was 89% for the entire sample. Among subsets, the reproducibility was 93% for the normals and esophagitis patients and 84% for the atypical symptom patients. Total percent time with pH less than 4 was the single most discriminate pH parameter (85%) and nearly equaled that of the three combined parameters (89%). The intrasubject variability of this parameter was determined by the mean +/- 2 SD of the relative differences between the two test results for all 53 subjects. Total percent time with pH less than 4 may vary between tests by a factor of 3.2-fold or less (218% higher to 69% lower). We conclude: (1) ambulatory 24-hr esophageal monitoring is a reproducible test for the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease; and (2) the large intrastudy variability in 24-hr total acid exposure may limit this test's usefulness as a measurement of therapeutic improvement.\r"

The sensitivity of the endoscopic diagnosis for adenomas is 0.80 and the specificity 0.71. We conclude the endoscopic diagnosis of polyps 1.0 cm and smaller is not accurate enough for decision making, and these should be biopsied to guide management. Since 97% of polyps larger than 1.0 cm are adenomas, their removal can be advised without biopsy.\r"

There is no evidence that equilibrium concentrations of the principal hormones are altered with age. However, the systems utilized to reach those equilibria become progressively taxed, and new equilibria may be achieved reflecting that regulatory problem. Thus, with advancing age there are significant alterations in hormone production, metabolism, and action. Some of these changes may play a role in the pathophysiology of senescence, although the evidence for that is limited. The magnitude of age-related alterations is highly variable and sex dependent. Whereas only subtle changes occur in pituitary dynamics, adrenal gland physiology, and thyroid function, the changes in glucose homeostasis, reproductive function, and calcium metabolism are more apparent. In the elderly, the interpretation of endocrine tests should reflect the nutritional status of the patient and the presence of coexisting illnesses. In this review, we describe the principles of endocrinology in the geriatric population and elaborate on the changes in specific glandular functions with aging. We also define strategies of evaluation and management protocols appropriate for the elderly with suspected endocrine dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) is not a single entity but a symptom complex that may represent the consequence of mechanical abnormalities, myocardial abnormalities, and/or disturbances of cardiac rhythm. In turn, it affects virtually every organ system in the body. This review focuses on CHF due to systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle, which comprises the majority of cases of this condition. Recent data suggest that CHF may be the most frequent primary diagnosis in patients on medical services in nonmilitary hospitals in this country: it affects approximately 2% of the United States population, or some 4 million people. The mortality rate for CHF is also worse than for many forms of cancer; thus, new therapeutic alternatives are imperative. In order to devise new therapeutic strategies, a detailed understanding of the pathophysiology of this condition is required. The relative advantages and disadvantages of various pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches are considered in detail. Certain medications, such as the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, have been shown to improve survival, and heart transplantation is clearly life-saving for those who are eligible for this therapy. However, the real challenge is to devise strategies to prevent the occurrence of heart failure, or interrupt its progress at a very early stage.\r"

  ".W": "It is known that women suffering from temporal lobe epilepsy may frequently present reproductive endocrine disorders (REDs). We hypothesized that a high occurrence of REDs could be found also in primary generalized epilepsy (PGE), and therefore investigated the hormonal and ovarian echographic profiles in 20 PGE female patients of reproductive age. Fourteen reported normal menstrual cycles, while 6 complained of longstanding menstrual irregularities. All but three patients were receiving antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy. In all subjects, the basal levels of gonadotropins, prolactin, and gonadal steroids were assayed. The response of luteinizing hormone (LH) to gonadotropin-releasing hormone was also investigated and ovarian ultrasonographic findings were evaluated. In five of six patients with menstrual problems (25% of the group), a well-defined RED was diagnosed (polycystic ovarian disease in three cases and hypothalamic ovarian failure in two). The 14 patients with normal menstrual cycles showed an elevation of mean basal follicle-stimulating hormone and prolactin, and a blunting of mean LH response. Our results suggest that a high occurrence of REDs may be found also in PGE. We hypothesize that a neurotransmitter dysfunction might be the common pathogenetic mechanism resulting in both REDs and PGE. The hormonal alterations observed in the patients with normal menstrual cycles seem to support our hypothesis. Previous data seem to rule out a possible AED effect accounting for the hormonal findings observed in our series. However, further studies are needed to confirm our preliminary results.\r"

  ".W": "This review has characterized the current state of knowledge of four clinical situations in which an interrelationship of gynecology, endocrinology and carbohydrate metabolism is recognized. The literature contains conflicting descriptions of changes in glucose homeostasis during the menstrual cycle and while using birth control pills. Physiologic changes in receptor number have been demonstrated in each of these situations, so failure to observe differences using glucose tolerance testing may reflect an in vivo homeostatic response to changes in these hormone levels. Thus, in vivo identification of alterations in carbohydrate metabolism induced by endogenous or exogenous steroids may require utilization of models that prevent these homeostatic mechanisms. The association between hyperandrogenism and hyperinsulinism has been better characterized, but the relationship is complicated by the frequent coexistence of obesity. The association may be due to insulin-stimulated ovarian androgen production, and insulin insensitivity may reflect a postreceptor defect. Insulin and its metabolic effects have also been implicated in ovulatory dysfunction in women with diabetes mellitus and identified as a factor affecting all levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. A clearer understanding of these relationships and their application to clinical management await further study.\r"

Follicular stimulation was induced with clomiphene citrate and laparotomy scheduled day 12 to 15 of the menstrual cycle. Ultrasound measurements of follicular diameter and number of follicles were obtained on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration, and laparotomy and ovum retrieval performed 36 hours later. Embryo transfer was performed 48 to 72 hours after insemination. Patients were treated postoperatively with intramuscular progesterone. In addition to evaluating the overall pregnancy rate, the outcome of patients having one or more follicles greater than or equal to 1.4 cm in mean diameter (group A) were compared to those in group B (no follicles greater than or equal to 1.4 cm in diameter). The number of oocytes obtained and the fertilization rate and polyspermic fertilization rate were not significantly different between groups; 10.1% of patients in group A conceived but no patient conceived in group B, yielding an overall pregnancy rate of 8.7%. These data suggest that physicians having IVF-ET at their disposal offer patients IVF during pelvic reconstructive surgery.\r"

  ".U": "88313387\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of sympathetic neural activation on basal pancreatic hormone secretion cannot be explained solely by the actions of the classic sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine. The nonadrenergic component may be mediated by the 29-amino acid peptide galanin in that this neuropeptide meets several of the criteria necessary to be considered a sympathetic neurotransmitter in the endocrine pancreas. 1) Galanin administration inhibits basal insulin and somatostatin secretion and stimulates basal glucagon secretion from the pancreas, qualitatively reproducing the effects of sympathetic nerve stimulation. These sympathomimetic effects appear to be mediated by direct actions of galanin on the islet. 2) Galanin-like immunoreactivity exists in fibers that innervate pancreatic islets. 3) Galanin is released during electrical stimulation of pancreatic nerves. The quantity released is sufficient to reproduce sympathetic nerve stimulation-induced effects on insulin secretion and to contribute to the neural effects on somatostatin and glucagon release. 4) Whether interference with galanin action or release reduces the islet response to sympathetic nerve stimulation remains to be determined. We hypothesize that galanin and norepinephrine act together to mediate the islet response to sympathetic neural activation. If galanin is a sympathetic neurotransmitter in the endocrine pancreas, it may contribute to the inhibition of insulin secretion that occurs during stress and thereby to the hyperglycemic response. Moreover, the local presence of this potent beta-cell inhibitor in the islet leads to speculation on galanin's contribution to the impairment of insulin secretion that occurs in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and therefore on the potential utility of a galanin antagonist in the treatment of this disease.\r"

Twenty animals from each strain received ad libitum exposure to a high-fat high-simple-carbohydrate diet or standard Purina Rodent Chow for 6 mo. Exposure to the high-fat, high-simple-carbohydrate, low-fiber diet produced obesity in both A/J and C57BL/6J mice. Whereas obesity was associated with only moderate glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in A/J mice, obese C57BL/6J mice showed clear-cut diabetes with fasting blood glucose levels of greater than 240 mg/dl and blood insulin levels of greater than 150 microU/ml. C57BL/6J mice showed larger glycemic responses to stress and epinephrine in the lean state than AJ mice, and these responses were exaggerated by obesity. These data suggest that the C57BL/6J mouse carries a genetic predisposition to develop non-insulin-dependent (type II) diabetes. Furthermore, altered glycemic response to adrenergic stimulation may be a biologic marker for this genetic predisposition to develop type II diabetes.\r"

Diabetic rats had lower body and ventricular weights and higher ratios of ventricular to body weight, all of which shifted toward normal values after 4 wk of untreated diabetes followed by 4 wk of insulin treatment. The contents of major phospholipids were significantly depressed in the diabetic rat hearts. In contrast, the triglyceride and cholesterol contents in the myocardium were increased by streptozocin injection and completely normalized by insulin treatment, and glucose levels returned to normal. The 1,2-diacylglycerol content in the myocardium was also significantly elevated in the diabetic rats compared with age-matched controls. Moreover, the 1,2-diacylglycerol content was significantly higher in rats with 4 wk of diabetes than in those with 8 wk of diabetes. Insulin treatment in the diabetic rats, however, did not produce any decrease in 1,2-diacylglycerol content. The results of this study suggest that the development of cardiomyopathy induced by streptozocin injection is associated with a high 1,2-diacylglycerol level, which may result in the activation of protein kinase C. Insulin is one of the agonists that generates 1,2-diacylglycerol in myocytes; however, the relationship between the sustained 1,2-diacylglycerol level and the normalization of diabetes by insulin administration is unclear.\r"

We extended this study to another model of IDDM, namely BB rats. Male and female BB rats were injected weekly with 0.2 mg OK-432 i.p. starting from 5 to 6 wk and continuing through 20 or 30 wk of age. The cumulative incidence of IDDM over 20 wk in the OK-432-treated BB rats (4 of 54, 7.4%) was significantly (P less than .01) lower than that found in the nontreated BB rats (13 of 47, 27.7%). We examined some of these rats as follows. All of the OK-432-treated BB rats tested showed normal glucose levels before and after oral glucose administrations, as did the nontreated and nondiabetic BB rats. Histological examination of pancreatic sections revealed that the OK-432-treated rats retained a greater number of intact islets without infiltration of the mononuclear cells than did the nontreated BB rats. A preliminary in vitro study further demonstrated that the cytotoxic activities of spleen cells against a rat insulinoma cell line, RIN, were suppressed in the OK-432-treated rat. However, the treatment of BB rats with OK-432 showed no suppressive effects in the spleen cell number, the responsiveness of spleen cells to concanavalin A, the populations of OX19+, W3/25+, and OX8+ peripheral blood lymphocytes, or in the titers of cell surface antibody against RIN. These results suggest that a nonimmunosuppressive immunomodulator such as OK-432 may be useful as an agent for immunotherapy of IDDM.\r"

The validity of this approach was tested by comparing insulin secretion rates, calculated by application of a two-compartmental analysis of peripheral C-peptide concentrations, with UCP excretion rates. Insulin secretion and UCP excretion with subjects on a mixed diet were simultaneously measured over a 24-h period in 13 patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and in 14 matched nondiabetic control subjects. The fraction of secreted C-peptide that was excreted in the urine (fractional C-peptide excretion) showed considerable intersubject variability in the diabetic (11.3 +/- 1.6%, range 3.9-20.8) and control (8.0 +/- 1.7%, range 1.1-27.9, P = .07) subjects (means +/- SE). UCP clearance demonstrated a similar degree of variability and was not significantly different (P = .07) between diabetic (23.8 +/- 3.0 ml/min) and control (16.5 +/- 2.7 ml/min) subjects.

With few exceptions, however, no attention was paid in these studies to the possible effects of hyperinsulinemia on urea nitrogen (N) pool size and the consequences of such changes on the calculated rates of protein, lipid, and carbohydrate (CHO) oxidation. We have determined the effects of euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps on urea N pool size, urinary N excretion, and rates of protein, lipid, and CHO oxidation (measured by indirect calorimetry) in six normal men.

An acid-alcohol extract of the patient's serum contained a factor that inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose transport in rat adipocytes. Low levels of the factor could be detected in 9 of 13 unselected patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes. The factor was heat stable and resistant to treatment with acid, base, and various lytic enzymes. It eluted from a Bio-Gel P-2 column with an apparent molecular weight of 300. The factor also inhibited stimulation of glucose transport in adipocytes by the insulin mimickers hydrogen peroxide and sodium vanadate. In vitro incubation of rat soleus muscles in the presence of the factor resulted in inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport. The factor enhanced 125I-labeled insulin binding in both adipocytes and muscle. A preparation of insulin receptors obtained from muscles incubated with serum factor showed increased binding of 125I-insulin to the alpha-subunit of the insulin receptor. Autophosphorylation of the beta-subunit and phosphorylation of exogenous substrate were increased in the receptor preparation obtained from muscles that had been incubated with serum factor. However, the increase in kinase activity was approximately the same as the increase in binding activity. No difference in kinase activity was observed when assayed under conditions in which 125I-insulin binding activity had been equalized.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To evaluate to what extent this glucose insensitivity can be attributed to a perturbation of the islet glucose metabolism, we estimated the rates of glucose phosphorylation, glucose utilization, oxygen consumption, and glucose oxidation in islets isolated from normal and NIDDM rats and compared these values with rates of islet insulin biosynthesis and release in vitro. The data confirm that islets from rats with NIDDM display a deficient response to glucose of both insulin biosynthesis and release that is still present after an overnight culture of the islets at 5.5 mM glucose. Furthermore, they show that islets of these rats have 1) normal low- and high-Km glucose-phosphorylating activities and no major alteration of the glucose utilization rate, 2) decreased insulin release in response to glyceraldehyde, 3) decreased rates of basal respiration and glucose oxidation and a markedly reduced stimulation by glucose of both islet oxygen consumption and glucose oxidation, and 4) decreased glucose-stimulated net 45Ca uptake. We conclude that the relative unresponsiveness to glucose of islets from NIDDM rats is associated with, and perhaps due to, a deficient islet glucose metabolism. This defect is not due to gross alterations in the glycolytic pathway but probably reflects alteration in the islet mitochondria function.\r"

Unlike insulin, vanadate, at a concentration that inhibited apoB secretion (10 microM), had no effect on intracellular lipogenesis, inhibited the secretion of newly synthesized hepatic proteins, and had a delayed onset and termination of action on inhibition of apoB secretion. At higher concentrations (40 and 80 microM), vanadate stimulated intracellular lipogenesis. In conclusion, our data indicate that vanadate mimics insulin action in hepatocytes with regard to the inhibition of medium accumulation of apoB. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that inhibition of apoB secretion may be secondary to an increase in phosphotyrosine content at its site of synthesis. The kinases responsible for this effect have not been identified. Several effects of vanadate, however, are different from those of insulin, suggesting a differential sensitivity to vanadate, a divergence of the signal transfer by insulin and vanadate at the insulin-receptor or postreceptor level, or both.\r"

A series of nondiabetic KTx patients served as a comparison group. Motor nerve conduction velocity (NCV) was measured in the ulnar, median, peroneal, and tibial nerves; sensory NCV was measured in the median nerve. EMG was performed in the first dorsal interosseus, flexor carpi radialis, anterior tibialis, and gastrocnemius muscles. In 68 pre-KTx diabetic patients, the mean NCV was below normal in all nerves, and the mean amplitudes of the evoked muscle action potential (MAP) were low normal in the upper extremity and below normal in the lower extremity. The values of the comparison group were within the normal range. At 1 (n = 57), 5 (n = 23), and 10 (n = 10) yr after KTx, the mean NCV of the diabetic patients remained essentially unchanged, but MAP amplitudes of all muscles had declined. EMG revealed progression of the denervation process, especially in muscles of the lower extremities. We conclude that diabetic neuropathy continues to progress by a progressive axonal loss after correction of uremia by KTx.\r"

  ".W": "Vitamin E deficiency is associated with increased platelet aggregation, which can be normalized through vitamin E supplementation. In diabetes, increased platelet thromboxane A2 (TXA2) production is correlated with decreased platelet vitamin E content. We therefore investigated the effect of 400 mg DL-alpha-tocopherol acetate daily for 4 wk on ADP- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation and platelet TXA2 production in 22 type I (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients without macroangiopathy and with no or only minimal microangiopathy by a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study. Platelet aggregation was induced in platelet-rich plasma by two or three different concentrations of ADP and collagen. TXA2 was measured by the stable spontaneous breakdown product thromboxane B2 by a specific radioimmunoassay. Whereas metabolic control remained unchanged during the study period, platelet TXA2 production was significantly (P less than .05 and P less than .01) reduced at each ADP concentration and at two of three collagen concentrations. Because increased TXA2 production of diabetic platelets is thought to play an important pathogenetic role in diabetic angiopathy, we conclude that vitamin E treatment could be beneficial with respect to platelet-vessel-wall interaction and thus might be promising for the prevention of diabetic angiopathy.\r"

Infusion of 0.5 mg/h beta-endorphin caused a significant rise in plasma glucose concentrations preceded by a significant increase in peripheral glucagon levels. No changes occurred in the plasma concentrations of insulin and C-peptide. Acute insulin and C-peptide responses to intravenous pulses of different glucose amounts (0.33 g/kg and 5 g) and arginine (3 g) were significantly reduced by beta-endorphin infusion (P less than .01). This effect was associated with a significant reduction of the glucose disappearance rates, suggesting that the inhibition of insulin was of biological relevance. beta-Endorphin also inhibited glucose suppression of glucagon levels and augmented the glucagon response to arginine. To verify whether the modification of prestimulus glucose level could be important in these hormonal responses to beta-endorphin, basal plasma glucose concentrations were raised by a primed (0.5 g/kg) continuous (20 mg kg-1.min-1) glucose infusion. After stabilization of plasma glucose levels (350 +/- 34 mg/dl, t = 120 min), beta-endorphin infusion caused an immediate and marked increase in plasma insulin level (peak response 61 +/- 9 microU/ml, P less than .01), which remained elevated even after the discontinuation of opioid infusion. Moreover, the acute insulin response to a glucose pulse (0.33 g/kg i.v.) given during beta-endorphin infusion during hyperglycemia was significantly higher than the response obtained during euglycemia (171 +/- 32 vs. 41 +/- 7 microU/ml, P less than .01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We tested the hypothesis that the previously observed association among hypertriglyceridemia, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance could be explained by a defect in insulin's antilipolytic effect. Insulin action was measured in 10 nondiabetic and 8 diabetic patients with hypertriglyceridemia (fasting plasma triglyceride 800 +/- 154 and 1105 +/- 445 mg/dl, respectively, P NS; fasting plasma glucose 99 +/- 3 and 161 +/- 12 mg/dl, respectively, P less than .001) and in 8 weight-matched normolipemic nondiabetic individuals (fasting plasma triglyceride and glucose 110 +/- 21 and 91 +/- 3 mg/dl). The slope of the decay in plasma free fatty acid (FFA) during insulin infusion was used as an index of insulin's antilipolytic effect. Insulin stimulation of glucose uptake in vivo during intravenous hyperinsulinemic clamp and in vitro in adipocytes were measures of insulin's glucoregulatory action. Both glucoregulatory and antilipolytic effects were similarly reduced in both hypertriglyceridemic groups compared with normal subjects. The plasma triglyceride concentration correlated positively with the slope of FFA suppression by insulin (r = .81, P less than .0001) and the fasting FFA concentration (r = .65, P less than .0001). In multiple linear regression analysis, insulin's antilipolytic effect and the fasting FFA concentration explained 83% of the variation in the plasma triglyceride concentration. These associations were independent of insulin's glucoregulatory effect and the fasting plasma insulin concentration. The data indicate that patients with endogenous hypertriglyceridemia are resistant to both the antilipolytic and glucoregulatory actions of insulin and that increased flux of FFA as a result of the latter, rather than hyperinsulinemia, is responsible for elevation of very-low-density lipoprotein production.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cultures consisted of small colonies with some areas of stratification and few intercellular spaces. Ultrastructural studies indicated that cultured cells had epithelial features with desmosomes at cell-to-cell contacts and intermediate filaments in addition to secretory granules in the cytoplasm. Insulin and C-peptide were released in equimolar amounts in culture media. When challenged for 30 min with 16.7 mM glucose, 1 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 4 mM tolbutamide, or 10(-6) M glucagon, insulinoma cells responded by a 1.5-, 1.5-, 2-, or 3-fold increase, respectively, in insulin release above baseline levels. A 15-min challenge with 10(-5) M isoproterenol increased insulin secretion by 1.85-fold. By indirect immunofluorescence, an anti-insulin antibody reacted positively with cell cytoplasm, whereas anti-somatostatin and anti-glucagon antibodies did not. Insulinoma cell surface expressed class I MHC molecules but not class II molecules. Immediately after isolation, crude insulinoma cells were contaminated by 2% of DR+ cells from nonislet components that disappeared after several weeks in culture. The ability of insulinoma cells to stimulate allogenic T-lymphocyte proliferation was assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation in mixed culture combinations. Crude insulinoma cells elicited a strong lymphoproliferative response with a stimulation index ranging between 3.5 and 7, whereas no stimulation was found after 1 mo in culture. It is postulated that absence of class II-positive cells in the stimulatory cell preparation conditioned this immune tolerance across the major histocompatibility barrier.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Inbred strains of mice exhibited genetic and sex-dependent differences in spontaneous production of organ-reactive autoantibodies detected by indirect immunofluorescence. Antitestis autoreactivity was found primarily in sera from C57BL/6J (B6) mice, whereas antigastric autoreactivity was common to both CBA/J and 129/J strains. Autoantibodies against islet cell cytoplasmic antigens (ICAs) were uniquely expressed by C57BL/KsJ (BKs) males. Introduction of the diabetes (db) mutation into these various inbred-strain backgrounds induced expression of ICA, with stronger induction observed in males. The stress imposed by the db or obesity (ob) mutation induced ICA in BKs mice at a higher frequency than in B6 mice; this differential sensitivity was somehow related to a gene linked to the H-2 complex because BKs.B6 H-2b congenic mice resembled B6 mice. The db3J mutation increased the expression of these autoantibodies in 129/J mice, which, like B6, were H-2b and therefore presumably possessed the same H-2-linked inducibility allele as BKs. Cytotoxic autoantibodies against islet cell surface antigens were only observed in C3HeB/FeJ db/db males, and their presence was correlated with beta-cell necrosis. It is concluded that db and/or ob genes appear to play an important role in the production of autoantibodies to islet cells, and sex-linked factor(s) may modify the phenotypic expression of the autoantibodies.\r"

The inclusion of nonradioactive inositol (1 mM) in the perifusion medium dramatically improved our ability to monitor glucose-induced increases in 3H efflux. Efflux studies with this method revealed the following. 1) 3H efflux is significantly greater at 7 than at 2.75 mM glucose, and this parallels a small but significant increase in insulin secretion. 2) D-manno-Heptulose reduces 3H efflux with 7 mM glucose to a level approximating that seen in the presence of 2.75 mM glucose and has no effect on 3H efflux with 2.75 mM glucose. 3) In the presence of 20 mM glucose plus 1 mM inositol, 3H efflux is rapid and biphasic, a response that parallels the timing and amplitude of the biphasic pattern of insulin secretion. Direct measurements of labeled inositol and inositol phosphate levels in islets revealed the following. 4) After 50 min of perifusion with 2.75 or 7 mM glucose, labeled inositol phosphates were significantly greater with 7 mM glucose. 5) In response to 20 mM glucose alone, islet levels of free inositol, inositol monophosphate (IP1), and inositol bisphosphate (IP2) increased. 6) In response to 20 mM glucose plus 1 mM cold inositol, islet levels of free inositol increased, whereas islet levels of IP1, IP2, and inositol trisphosphate (IP3) were reduced compared with values obtained with 20 mM glucose alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A few weeks before onset of disease, there is marked recruitment and accumulation of ED1+ macrophages at periductal and perivascular locations adjacent to noninfiltrated islets. These recruited cells, distinct from the resident ED2+ tissue macrophages, then infiltrate the islets. Infiltration of the pancreas by ED1+ macrophages is therefore a very early event in the prediabetic period and suggests a possible role for macrophages in the pathogenesis of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) in this animal model.\r"

  ".W": "Between 12 and 26 wk of age, approximately 80% of female nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice from the inbred Sansum colony develop lymphocytic insulitis and become overtly diabetic. The disease in this animal model is similar to human insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) in both genetics and autoimmune pathogenesis. Cyclosporin A (CsA) has been used for immunosuppression in IDDM of recent onset in humans but has several limiting side effects. Therefore, a different regimen for CsA immunosuppression was investigated. Autologous splenic lymphoid cells from 12-wk-old not-yet-diabetic female NOD mice were cultured for 72 h with CsA plus interleukin 2 (IL-2) before reinfusion into the animal from which they were isolated. After this treatment, only 2 (18%) of 11 mice became overtly diabetic during an observation period of 19 wk, while 18 (86%) of 21 age-matched control mice developed diabetes during the same observation period (P less than .001). These data suggest an ex vivo preferential IL-2 activation of specific suppressor cells for the autoimmune process with CsA blockade of cytolytic/helper activities. Because the in vivo concentrations of CsA with this procedure would be negligible, these findings have implications for the potential nontoxic use of CsA in human protocols as well.\r"

In the first phase of the study omeprazole (20 or 40 mg daily) was compared with placebo in 64 patients. After 4 wk there was endoscopic healing in 81% (25 of 31) of omeprazole-treated patients and in only 6% (2 of 32) of placebo-treated patients. Endoscopic healing of esophagitis was accompanied by symptom relief and histologic healing of ulceration. In the second (dose finding) phase a further 132 patients were randomized to omeprazole (20 or 40 mg daily) and endoscopic healing was assessed. In patients with the mildest grade of ulcerative esophagitis (grade 2), healing occurred at 4 wk in 87% receiving 20 mg and in 97% receiving 40 mg. In patients with grade 3 esophagitis, 67% (20 mg) and 88% (40 mg) were healed. Less than half the patients with grade 4 esophagitis (Barrett's ulcers or confluent ulceration) healed with either 20 mg (48%) or 40 mg (44%). Regression analysis in the 164 omeprazole-treated patients showed no evidence that healing was influenced by factors other than severity of esophagitis at entry and omeprazole dose. In phase 3 of the study the rate of endoscopic relapse was determined in 107 endoscopically healed patients after stopping omeprazole. Erosive or ulcerative esophagitis recurred in 88 of 107 (82%) by 6 mo. Neither initial dose, grade of esophagitis, nor smoking was shown to influence relapse rate. Omeprazole is a highly effective treatment for peptic esophagitis. The 40-mg/day dosage produces endoscopic healing slightly more quickly than the 20-mg/day dosage, and the initial endoscopic gradings are of prognostic value. Relapse occurs rapidly when treatment is stopped.\r"

The first 30-day mortality was 7 (11%) in the injection sclerotherapy group compared with 11 (20%) in the medical treatment group. This difference was not statistically significant. During the entire observation period 9 (14.3%) died in the sclerosed group and 16 (29%) died in the medically treated group, and this difference was statistically significant at the 5% level. Comparison of recurrent bleeding among both groups revealed that the difference was statistically not significant.

Smoking should be discouraged to reduce the risk for both lung cancer and heart disease. Recommendations should be made to increase fiber intake to lessen the risk for carcinoma of the colon. Reducing fat intake also decreases risk for colon cancer, as well as carcinoma of the breast. Postmenopausal bleeding must be investigated for early diagnosis of endometrial cancer and, when endometrial hyperplasia is the finding, it should be treated with progestogens to prevent adenocarcinoma. The progestogen challenge test is recommended for all women with a uterus, and if bleeding occurs, the progestogen should be continued for 13 days each month. Use of mammograms and other diagnostic modalities should be increased to make the earliest possible diagnosis of breast cancer.\r"

The addition of an active, monomeric form of insulin, despentapeptide-insulin, to the serosal side of the intestine from normal rats inhibited luminal glucose absorption (421 (11) to 285 (11) mumol/h/g dry wt, p less than 0.001) and lactate production (340 (28) to 192 (26) mumol/h/g dry wt, p less than 0.001), but had no effect on glucose utilisation (231 (11) and 210 (16) mumol/h/g dry wt). The production of acute insulin deficiency by the injection of anti-insulin serum in vivo caused a marked inhibition of luminal glucose absorption (421 (11) to 240 (13) mumol/h/g dry wt, p less than 0.001), glucose utilisation (231 (11) to 48 (2) mumol/h/g dry wt, p less than 0.001) and lactate production (340 (28) to 94 (2) mumol/h/g dry wt, p less than 0.001) in vitro. The effects of insulin deficiency were reversed by despentapeptide-insulin in vitro, so that the rates of absorption and metabolism for intestine from insulin deficient and normal rats were similar in the presence of the modified insulin. All the effects caused by insulin deficiency and despentapeptide-insulin were apparent within minutes and could not be attributed to hyperglycaemia. It is concluded that rat small intestine is subject to rapid and direct regulation by insulin.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of pharmacological constriction of the lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) on oesophageal varices was investigated in an experimental study followed by a controlled clinical trial. In the experimental study intravariceal pressure was measured just above the LOS in 11 patients before and after constricting the LOS by intravenous pentagastrin. Intravariceal pressure fell from a mean of 23 (range 12-36) mmHg to 4 (range 0-7) mmHg (p less than 0.001). This marked pressure drop indicated the considerable compression of varices that occurred within the LOS. A prospective controlled clinical trial examined whether LOS constriction (effected by the longer acting metoclopramide) would compress varices sufficiently to arrest active variceal bleeding originating from the lowest 2 cm oesophagus--the area encircled by the LOS. Of 11 patients who received metoclopramide, 10 stopped bleeding compared with four of the 11 who received placebo (p less than 0.01). Pharmacological constriction of the LOS appears to offer a new and effective approach for arresting active bleeding from oesophageal varices.\r"

  ".W": "Our previous studies support the hypothesis that activation of the renin-angiotensin system by renal ischemia elevates adenosine levels and that adenosine acts in a negative feedback loop to limit renin release and to mitigate some of the hypertension-producing effects of angiotensin II. To further test this hypothesis, we compared the time course of caffeine-induced increases in plasma renin activity with the time course of changes in plasma levels of adenosine in two models of renin-dependent renovascular hypertension. Also, we compared the effects of caffeine on plasma renin activity and arterial blood pressure in renin-dependent versus renin-independent renovascular hypertension. In comparison to sham-operated rats, plasma levels of adenosine in the left and right renal veins and aorta were elevated severalfold in two-kidney, one clip rats (2K1C) 1 week after left renal artery clipping. However, adenosine levels declined during the second and third weeks after clipping. In 2K1C rats treated chronically with caffeine, plasma renin activity was markedly elevated during the first week after operation as compared to non-caffeine-treated 2K1C rats. However, during the second and third weeks after clipping, caffeine had lesser effects on plasma renin activity. A temporal relationship between plasma adenosine levels and caffeine-induced hyperreninemia was also observed in rats with aortic ligation. Caffeine accelerated hypertension in 2K1C rats and rats with aortic ligation (renin-dependent renovascular hypertension), but it had no effect on plasma renin activity or blood pressure in one-kidney, one clip rats (renin-independent renovascular hypertension). These results lend further support to the hypothesis that adenosine functions to mitigate the renin-angiotensin system in renin-dependent renovascular hypertension.\r"

  ".U": "88314236\r", 
  ".W": "Several new concepts have emerged recently regarding the effects of chronic hypertension on cerebral blood vessels. First, hypertrophy of large cerebral arteries in chronic hypertension attenuates increases in pressure of downstream vessels and protects the cerebral microvasculature. Second, in contrast to large cerebral arteries, which become less distensible during chronic hypertension, distensibility of cerebral arterioles increases during chronic hypertension despite hypertrophy of the arteriolar wall. Third, dilatation of cerebral blood vessels with disruption of the blood-brain barrier, and not vasospasm, appears to be the critical factor in the pathogenesis of hypertensive encephalopathy. This concept is supported by the finding that cerebral edema in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats is preceded by vasodilatation and disruption of the barrier. Fourth, alterations of endothelium-mediated dilatation may impair vasodilator responses in chronic hypertension and predispose to ischemia. Finally, chronic hypertension impairs dilatation of collateral blood vessels in the cerebral circulation. The implication of this finding is that increased susceptibility to cerebral infarction in chronic hypertension may be related in part to compromised responses of the collateral circulation.\r"

The \"in vitro bleeding time\" (in vitro BT) is a new method for measuring primary hemostasis in vitro. Five chronic dialysis patients each underwent two dialyses: 1) with conventional full heparinization, and 2) with the stable PGI2 analogue CG 4203 and additional \"low-dose\" heparin. The predialytic in vitro BT is longer than normal values and values 1 h after the end of dialysis. While heparin has no significant effect on the in vitro BT, CG 4203 prolongs it concentration-dependently. Infusing CG 4203 at a rate of 25 ng/kg/min, the in vitro BT is extended beyond the measurable range of 800 microliter during the first approx. 150 min of dialysis. During the next approx. 90 min it steadily decreases.\r"

  ".W": "Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) production in humans has been thought to be stimulated by estrogens and thyroid hormone and inhibited by androgens. However, recent data indicate that SHBG production in vitro is stimulated by both androgens and estrogens. This study was designed to determine what other hormonal factors regulate SHBG production. Since hyperinsulinemia and hyperprolactinemia both occur in disease states in which low serum SHBG levels are found, the effects of insulin and PRL were compared to and/or studied in combination with estradiol (E2), T4, and testosterone (T) in a human hepatoma cell line (Hep G2). Hep G2 cells were grown to near confluence in medium including 10% fetal calf serum, and then 72-h experimental incubations were carried out which used only fetal calf serum-free medium. Compared to control incubations, both insulin (10(-8) mol/L) and PRL (10(-8) mol/L) decreased SHBG production from 65.0 +/- 0.6 (+/- SE) to 46.8 +/- 1.1 and 46.8 +/- 1.2 nmol/10(6) cells, respectively (P less than 0.01). Insulin also inhibited both E2 and T4-stimulated SHBG production. T stimulated SHBG production to the same degree as E2. Finally, both E2 and insulin significantly increased cell number, an important consideration when expressing the effect of a hormone on SHBG production in cultured cells. We conclude that insulin and PRL inhibit SHBG production and confirm that T4, T, and E2 stimulate SHBG production in vitro. These findings suggest that insulin and PRL may be important factors in the regulation of SHBG production in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "88315251\r", 
  ".W": "Although fasting decreases insulin-mediated glucose uptake (IMGU), its effect on noninsulin-mediated glucose uptake (NIMGU) is not known. To examine this issue we studied seven obese men [mean (+/- SD) age, 36 +/- 5 yr; weight, 91 +/- 13 kg] after an overnight fast (day 0) and 3 days (day 4) and 9 days (day 10) of total fasting and six normal weight men (age, 32 +/- 4 yr; weight, 73 +/- 6 kg) after an overnight and 3 days of fasting. To study NIMGU, somatostatin (0.16 micrograms/kg.min) was infused to create severe insulin deficiency and [3H]3-glucose to measure glucose disappearance (Rd), while serum glucose was sequentially clamped at a level of about 4.7 mmol/L for 180 min and about 11 mmol/L for an additional 100 min. The results from the last 60 min of each glycemic plateau were used for analysis. Under these conditions insulin action is absent and Rd = NIMGU. Since under conditions of euglycemic insulinopenia, NIMGU into noncentral nervous system tissues is negligible, and central nervous system (CNS) glucose uptake saturates at physiological glucose concentrations, it follows that at a glucose level of about 4.7 mmol/L, NIMGU reflects CNS glucose uptake and at about 11 mmol/L, NIMGU reflect CNS plus non-CNS tissues. Thus, non-CNS NIMGU = NIMGU at 11 mmol/L - NIMGU at about 4.7 mmol/L. The obese subjects' mean weight fell to 88 +/- 5 kg on day 4 and 85 +/- 5 kg on day 10 (P less than 0.001 between all values). The mean basal serum glucose level fell from 5.3 +/- 0.1 on day 0 to 4.2 +/- 0.2 and 3.8 +/- 0.2 mmol/L on days 4 and 10, respectively (P less than 0.01 between all values). During insulinopenia plasma FFA and serum beta-hydroxybutyrate levels on day 10 were 3- and 30-fold higher than the basal prefast levels, respectively. Noninsulin-mediated glucose clearance at about 4.7 mmol/L did not change during fasting [0.0016 +/- 0.0001 (day 0) vs. 0.0016 +/- 0.0001 (day 4) and 0.0014 +/- 0.0001 L/kg.min (day 10); P = NS between all values]; at about 11 mmol/L noninsulin-mediated glucose clearance fell from 0.0016 +/- 0.0001 on day 0 to 0.0001 +/- 0.0001 dL/kg.min on day 10 (P less than 0.001). Results in the lean group were similar to those in the obese group after a 3-day fast.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In this study we evaluated the use of glucagon (2 mg, iv) tests in the diagnosis of spontaneous hypoglycemia secondary to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and insulinoma. Twenty-one normal subjects, 45 patients with HCC (11 with hypoglycemia), and 14 patients with insulinoma (all with hypoglycemia) were studied. The fasting blood glucose level was low in all patients with hypoglycemia. The fasting plasma insulin and C-peptide concentrations were high in patients with insulinoma and low in patients with HCC and hypoglycemia. The blood glucose responses to glucagon administration were less than normal in patients with HCC and hypoglycemia and within normal limits in patients with insulinoma. The insulinoma patients had increased plasma insulin and C-peptide responses to glucagon despite having low blood glucose levels. Compared with the HCC patients without hypoglycemia, HCC patients with hypoglycemia had impaired plasma insulin and C-peptide responses. The fasting hypoglycemia, hypoinsulinemia, and impaired insulin/C-peptide responses to glucagon in patients with hepatoma and hypoglycemia presumably reflect the production of insulin-like substances by the hepatoma. We conclude that glucagon administration results in characteristic responses in these groups of patients and can be of use in the diagnosis of spontaneous hypoglycemia secondary to hepatoma or insulinoma.\r"

  ".U": "88315254\r", 
  ".W": "The mechanisms of sc insulin absorption are not understood, and models for interpreting in vivo data cannot be developed without gross simplification. To overcome this difficulty we developed a new approach which makes use of deconvolution analysis and does not require any model of the sc tissue. In five normal subjects and seven insulin-dependent diabetic (IDDM) patients endogenous insulin secretion was suppressed by means of a hypoglycemic glucose clamp procedure (approximately 2.8 mmol/L) sustained by a continuous insulin infusion (approximately 4 pmol/min.kg). A bolus injection of insulin (5.4 nmol) was administered iv, and plasma insulin concentrations were measured frequently for 2 h to assess iv insulin kinetics. Insulin then was injected sc in the abdominal region, and plasma insulin concentrations were measured for 8 h. Each subject was studied twice, with porcine and semisynthetic human insulin (Actrapid, Novo). The rate of insulin absorption was reconstructed by deconvolution from the plasma concentrations and iv insulin kinetic data. Linearity of the iv insulin kinetics, essential for deconvolution analysis, was confirmed by a dose-response study in the range of the measured concentrations (150-1800 pmol/L). In most instances, a two-compartment model was adequate to describe the iv response. The mean plasma insulin clearance rates were 15.5 +/- 1.9 (+/- SD) mL/min.kg (porcine) and 17.2 +/- 6.0 (human) in normal subjects and 20.7 +/- 8.8 (porcine) and 20.9 +/- 9.1 (human) in the IDDM patients. The rate of appearance of human insulin from sc tissue was faster than that of porcine insulin in both normal and IDDM subjects, but no significant differences were found in bioavailability, which was 55 +/- 12% (+/- SD; porcine) and 61 +/- 34% (human) in the normal subjects, and 84 +/- 28% (porcine) and 86 +/- 23% (human) in the IDDM patients. The rate of absorption and bioavailability were higher in the IDDM patients than in the normal subjects, a difference possibly related to increased sc blood flow in the IDDM patients. No differences were found with regard to glucose requirement values, normalized to plasma insulin concentrations, in agreement with the finding that the bioavailability of the two insulin species was similar.\r"

The disappearance of 125I from the injection site was followed by external gamma-counting. Subcutaneous blood flow (ATBF) was measured concomitantly with the 133Xe washout technique. The plasma glucose nadir [mean, 2.0 +/- 0.1 (+/- SE) mmol/L] occurred at 33 +/- 3 min and resulted in maximal arterial plasma epinephrine concentrations of approximately 6 nmol/L. From 30 min before to 60 min after the glucose nadir the [125I]insulin absorption rate was depressed compared to that during normoglycemia. The first order disappearance rate constants were reduced by approximately 50% (P less than 0.01) during the first 30-min interval after the glucose nadir. During the same period ATBF increased by 100% (P less than 0.05). The results suggest that in normal subjects the absorption of soluble insulin from a sc depot is depressed in connection with hypoglycemia, despite considerably elevated ATBF.\r"

One hundred beta lactamase negative isolates, which gave reduced zone diameters (less than 20 mm) around 2 micrograms discs and required 1-64 mg/l ampicillin for inhibition, were detected at The London Hospital. Eighty five of these had been reported as sensitive to ampicillin by the laboratories of origin. Many of these 100 isolates showed reduced susceptibility to other beta lactam antibiotics. Accurate detection of non-enzymic reduced susceptibility to ampicillin may emerge as an important guide to the likely sensitivity of H influenzae isolates to the enzyme stable beta lactams.\r"

The morphology of the lesion and its poor reproducibility under experimental conditions suggested that it was an artefact of the biopsy procedure: it was easily reproduced in resected specimens of large bowel using punch or basket forceps but not when using flat forceps. The presence of the lesion seems to depend on the type of forceps used rather than on differences in deployment and seems to be caused by avulsion of the superficial part of the muscularis propria and its incorporation into the tissues included in rectal biopsy specimens.\r"

Y1/82A bound to determinants present in leukaemic cells from patients with acute myelomonocytic leukaemia and acute monocytic leukaemia, but not to neoplastic cells from patients with malignant lymphoproliferative disorders or malignant epithelial tumours. Y1/82A failed to react with other cell types, with the exception of osteoclasts and megakaryocytes. Analysis by Western blotting showed that the antigen detected by antibody Y1/82A was associated with intracellular granules in macrophages. Monoclonal antibody Y1/82A may be useful in the diagnosis of monocytic leukaemias and histiocytic neoplasms and in the identification of macrophages in tissues from various inflammatory and neoplastic conditions.\r"

Functional T-B cell (T-B) interaction involves binding of Ag by B cell surface Ig, internalization and processing of Ag, expression of an Ag fragment in the context of Ia, binding of Ag/Ia by the TCR and binding of T cell-derived lymphokines by B cell lymphokine receptors. It is becoming increasingly evident that B and T cell accessory molecules also are involved in T-B interactions. To determine the role of accessory molecules in T-B collaboration, we have designed a system in which T-B interaction was artificially induced in the absence of carrier protein. TNP-modified, turkey gamma-globulin-specific, Th cells were allowed to form conjugates with TNP-specific B cells in the absence of hapten-carrier complex. Both B and T cells were induced to proliferate and B cells partially differentiated into antibody-secreting cells when B cells were cultured with TNP-modified but not unmodified T cells. The activation of B cells by TNP-modified T cells was not MHC restricted but was blocked by anti-Ia antibodies, suggesting a role for Ia distinct from Ag presentation. Furthermore, B cell proliferation was also inhibited by antibodies to L3T4 and LFA-1, suggesting a functional accessory role for these molecules in induction of B cell proliferation/differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "The TCA3 gene was originally isolated from a cDNA library derived from a TH1 (inflammatory) T cell clone. Expression of TCA3 RNA was limited to cells in the activated state. Based on its expression profile and the existence of a hydrophobic leader sequence with a predicted cleavage site, we proposed that TCA3 encodes a new lymphokine. In the present study, we examine the subset distribution, kinetics, and regulation of TCA3 RNA expression. We show that TCA3 is expressed in response to selected T cell-activating stimuli. TCA3 is transcribed to peak steady state levels by 4 h after stimulation in TH1, TH2 (helper), and CTL clones. Two intracellular signals, supplied in vitro by phorbol ester and one of several agents capable of increasing intracellular free calcium concentrations, are required for the initiation of TCA3 transcription. In addition, TCA3 transcription is blocked by anti-L3T4 mAb, suggesting that prior signaling through L3T4 can inhibit expression of TCA3 and other lymphokines. In contrast to IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma TCA3 is uniformly expressed at high levels among all individual T cell clones examined, including four TH1, three TH2, and three CTL clones. Furthermore, activation-specific TCA3 expression can be dissociated from T cell proliferation.\r"

  ".W": "The capacity of the human monocyte cell line U-937 to synthesize complement factor H was examined. The kinetics of secretion of factor H into cell culture supernatant were followed by a sensitive solid phase RIA capable of measuring 0.1 ng of protein. Daily secretion of factor H was low and almost linear and was approximately 3 ng of factor H per 10(6) cells. Factor H synthesis was inhibited by cycloheximide but returned to the levels seen in untreated cultures after removal of the inhibitor. LPS and IL-1 both effected a time- and dose-dependent enhancement of factor H synthesis. Induction of U-937 cells with PMA to differentiate into macrophage-like cells also resulted in increased factor H synthesis. RIA of cell lysates, immunofluorescence microscopy, as well as FACS analysis all revealed that factor H Ag was also associated with the U-937 cell membrane. The population of U-937 cells bearing membrane-associated factor H was decreased from 77 to 43% after stimulation for 48 h with LPS (1 microgram/ml). [35S]Methionine metabolic labeling and SDS-PAGE analysis of factor H immunoprecipitates from unstimulated and stimulated culture supernatants and cell lysates demonstrated a major polypeptide, m.w. 150,000, and a minor component, m.w. 42,000. Western blot analysis of factor H in fresh normal plasma also detected both 150,000 and 42,000 m.w. factor H proteins. This is in agreement with the recent demonstration of a 4.4- and 1.8-kb mRNA for factor H in human liver. These data demonstrate that U-937 cells synthesize factor H that is structurally and antigenically similar to factor H in normal plasma. The exact nature of the membrane-bound factor H and its functions and mechanism of attachment to the cell membrane remain to be elucidated.\r"

  ".W": "T cell proliferative responses to Mycobacterium leprae were measured by immunization of mice at the base of the tail with Ag and challenging lymphocytes from draining lymph nodes in culture with M. leprae. C57BL/10J and B10.BR mice were identified as low responder mice and the congenic strains B10.M, B10.Q, and B10.AKM as high responders whereas F1 (high x low) hybrid mice were found to be low responders. The cellular basis of low responsiveness did not appear to result from a defect in Ag-presenting cells or the activation of suppressor T cells by M. leprae. The influence of the environment in which T cells developed on responsiveness to M. leprae was analyzed in chimeric mice prepared by irradiating F1(C57BL/10J x B10.M) mice and reconstituting with bone marrow from C57BL/10J, B10.M, or F1 donors. Six weeks later, chimeric mice were immunized with M. leprae, lymph node cells were subsequently prepared, and H-2 phenotyped and challenged in culture with M. leprae Ag. T cell proliferative responses were found to be low in all cases, similar to those observed using lymph node cells from F1 hybrid mice. These results suggested that high responder B10.M lymphocytes developing in the irradiated F1 mice became tolerized to antigenic determinants found on M. leprae. This implied cross-reactive epitopes existed between some mouse strains and M. leprae. Low responsiveness to M. leprae in low responder and F1 hybrid mice may result from tolerance to H-2-encoded Ag that show cross-reactivity with M. leprae.\r"

  ".W": "Supernatants of Con A-stimulated rat spleen cell cultures contain a factor that induces relative resistance to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity in the YAC cell line, a line that is otherwise highly susceptible to murine NK cell-mediated lysis. This NK-lysis resistance-inducing factor (LRIF) has a Mr of 12,600 Da, as determined by gel filtration chromatography, and an isoelectric pH of 4.8. NK-LRIF is heat labile and is de-activated by treatment with proteolytic enzymes. Unlike immune-IFN (IFN-gamma), NK-LRIF is not inactivated by pH 2 treatment, and antibodies capable of neutralizing IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma do not abrogate the effect of NK-LRIF. Highly purified IL-2 preparations lack NK-LRIF activity. NK-LRIF does not induce a general resistance to lysis in YAC cells, because control and NK-LRIF-treated YAC cells were equally susceptible to alloimmune cytotoxic T cells. YAC cells treated with NK-LRIF showed a marked enhancement (5- to 10-fold) in the expression of class I MHC Ag. This observation supports the proposition that the NK susceptibility of target cells could be inversely related to the expression of class I MHC Ag.\r"

  ".W": "The course of experimental cutaneous Candida albicans infections produced in mice made leucopenic by the administration of cyclophosphamide was compared to that in untreated animals. In the latter, neutrophils characteristically infiltrated the area of infection and the organisms were virtually always confined to the epidermis. However, even though many fewer foci of infection were associated with neutrophils in the cyclophosphamide-treated animals, a majority of these foci were also unable to penetrate past the epidermis. Although Candida yeast proliferated relatively poorly when cultured in homogenates of skin lacking the epidermis, Candida pseudohyphae could invade into the dermis if inoculated skin was isolated from normal animals and cultured in vitro, or if the epidermis was removed by gentle scraping prior to inoculation with Candida yeast onto the remaining skin of leucopenic animals. Therefore, in the absence of neutrophil contact and killing of Candida pseudohyphae in the epidermis, other cutaneous defense mechanisms appear to be capable of preventing invasion of a majority of the organisms into the dermis. These findings may help to explain why deep Candida infections are rare in patients who have extensive superficial candidiasis.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of these studies was to determine whether the production of the cytokine epidermal cell thymocyte-activating factor (ETAF) by human squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells correlated with their tumorigenicity and metastatic potential in athymic nude mice. Cells of the human SCC line A431 produced rapidly growing subcutaneous tumors, few experimental lung metastases, and low levels of ETAF activity in vitro. In contrast, cells of the SCC Colo-16 line produced slower growing subcutaneous tumors, high numbers of experimental lung metastases, and a high level of ETAF activity in culture supernatants. The apparent relationship between production of ETAF and experimental metastasis formation was not consistent. Clonal populations of the SCC A431 and Colo-16 were isolated in vitro. The clones of Colo-16 varied in their ability to produce experimental metastases and in production of ETAF in vitro. However, the levels of ETAF production did not correlate with the propensity of the SCC cells to produce experimental metastases. We conclude that while the growth and metastasis of human SCC in nude mice may benefit from production of the cytokine ETAF, the ETAF production per se is not invariably linked with the capability of the SCC cells to metastasize.\r"

Seven of 13 women with non-gonococcal infection had an adverse reproductive outcome, compared with none of 10 women with gonococcal infection (P = .007). Two groups of causes for adverse reproductive outcome were found. Of the seven infertile women, four had initial tubal abscess, and three had evidence of Chlamydia trachomatis infection.

In most patients, BK viruria began two to eight weeks after transplantation and resolved spontaneously after a two- to three-week period. Posttransplantation, there was a temporal pattern in the onsets of infection with the different viruses; herpes simplex virus infections occurred first (mean, 7 d), followed by BKV infections (mean, 33 d) and then cytomegalovirus infections (mean, 51 d). BK viruria was associated with hemorrhagic cystitis.\r"

After having experienced these three different approaches in our program, we preferentially used the perurethral-transvesical approach as our routine technique for oocyte recovery under ultrasound guidance. We feel that this method is easier to perform and also carries less risk for contamination. From January to December 1986, 186 oocyte retrievals under ultrasound guidance were performed. In 7 cases no oocytes were found despite normal ovarian stimulation. A total of 767 oocytes was collected; the fertilization rate was 71.8%. Forty pregnancies were achieved (21.5% per attempt or 27.7% per embryo replacement). Except for transient hematuria, no complications were observed.\r"

This lesion may cause a predisposition to subsequent colonization by circulating microorganisms, leading to infective endocarditis. We measured platelet adherence in vitro to cultured endothelial cells derived from the porcine aortic valve and ascending aorta. We found that valvular endothelial cells showed a twofold to threefold higher adherence than ascending aortic endothelial cells of chromium 51-labeled platelets in the presence of proteolytically active thrombin. This finding did not correlate with endothelial prostacyclin release: cardiac valve endothelial cells released more prostacyclin than did, ascending aortic cells, exogenous prostacyclin had no effect on thrombin-stimulated adherence, and aspirin inhibition of endothelial prostacyclin synthesis showed no effect on platelet adherence. Fixation of platelets abolished thrombin-stimulated adherence; fixation of endothelial cells had minimal effect. We suggest that these differences may contribute to the propensity of the cardiac valve to develop nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of our study was to assess whether the development of chronic uremia in rats with extensive renal mass ablation was associated with an impairment of primary hemostasis as occurs in humans with terminal uremia. We also wanted to assess whether uremic rats had an increased generation of vascular prostacyclin (PGI2) and whether conjugated estrogens could influence such an abnormality. Our results showed that the development of chronic renal failure in rats was associated with a significant prolongation of bleeding time as reported in humans. Thoracic aorta and inferior vena cava specimens from uremic rats produced significantly more 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (the stable breakdown product of PGI2) than did specimens from the corresponding controls. Conjugated estrogens significantly shortened the bleeding time of uremic rats. The effect on bleeding time was detectable in the majority of animals within 4 hours from conjugated estrogen injection, reached its maximum at 24 hours, and returned to preinjection values within 72 hours from conjugated estrogen injection. Estrogen administration did not influence the generation of vascular PGI2. It is concluded that the model of extensive renal ablation in the rat is a suitable one to study changes in primary hemostasis in chronic renal failure and that the effect of estrogens on primary hemostasis in uremia is not mediated by changes in vascular PGI2.\r"

  ".W": "Platelet factor 4 is a polypeptide constituent of platelet alpha granules that is released during platelet aggregation and inhibits heparin-mediated reactions. Hageman factor (factor XII) is a plasma proenzyme that, when activated by certain negatively charged agents, initiates clotting via the intrinsic pathway of thrombin formation. In earlier studies using crude systems, platelet factor 4 inhibited activation of Hageman factor by dextran sulfate or cerebrosides, but not activation of Hageman factor by kaolin or ellagic acid. In the present study we examined the mechanisms of inhibition by platelet factor 4, using purified reagents. Platelet factor 4 inhibited activation of Hageman factor by ellagic acid, as measured by amidolysis of a synthetic substrate of activated Hageman factor, an effect inhibited by heparin or by an anti-platelet factor 4 antiserum. Coating glass tubes with platelet factor 4 before addition of normal plasma significantly lengthened the partial thromboplastin time of normal plasma. In addition, the clot-promoting properties of kaolin were inhibited by its prior exposure to platelet factor 4. Thus, the inhibitory properties of platelet factor 4 directed against the activation of Hageman factor were confirmed in a purified system. In this purified system, in contrast to earlier studies using crude systems, platelet factor 4 inhibited activation of Hageman factor by glass, ellagic acid, or kaolin.\r"

Variables of interest were detoxification completion rates, relative completion rates with and without program review and approval, psychotherapy, new pharmacological agents to accelerate the detoxification process, and abstinence rates at follow-up as a function of such treatment variables. The review found progressive improvement in overall detoxification completion rates over the three 5-year eras: 39.7%, 54.9%, and 76.3%. Program-recommended detoxification showed much higher completion rates than did unrecommended detoxification in 1970-1975 and psychotherapy-assisted detoxification showed modest but consistently greater completion rates in the two eras during which it was studied, 1970-1975 and 1976-1980. The consistent gains in detoxification completion rates over the three eras are attributed primarily to the use of new drugs which greatly shorten the detoxification interval and ameliorate withdrawal symptoms. The drugs do not appear to have had an effect on follow-up abstinence rates. Limitations upon the conclusions and generalizability of findings are discussed. Suggestions are made for future methadone maintenance detoxification treatment and research.\r"

  ".W": "Monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) react with human colorectal cancer cells, and when labeled with a gamma-emitting radioisotope, may help to localize known and occult metastatic disease. We tested ZCE-025 (Hybritech, Inc, San Diego), a high-affinity immune gamma globulin1 (IgG1) MoAb anti-CEA that does not react with normal granulocyte glycoproteins in a phase I/II trial to determine the reagent's toxicity and its maximum efficacy in detecting metastatic colorectal cancer. Increasing doses of unlabeled ZCE-025 were mixed with 1 mg of Indium-111 (111In)-radiolabeled MoAb and administered intravenously (IV) to 34 patients who had metastatic colorectal cancer. Planar nuclear or single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) scans were performed 48 to 72 and 120 to 144 hours later. Total dose of MoAb and scanning sensitivity (number of imaged lesions/number of known lesions) were correlated up to 80 mg. At doses of 2.5 to 20 mg, a mean of 22% of the lesions were imaged; at 40 mg, 77% were imaged (P less than .01). Liver metastases were detected as areas of increased activity (\"hot\") at the 40 mg dose but showed decreased MoAb uptake at lower doses. At the 40 mg dose normal liver parenchymal uptake of the labeled MoAb was lower with respect to blood pool compared with the other doses. At 80 mg, however, sensitivity of detection declined to 21%. One milligram of 111In-labeled ZCE-025 antibody coinfused with 39 mg of unlabeled antibody appeared optimal for detecting metastatic colorectal cancer, particularly in the liver. Although the exact mechanism(s) for this dose effect is currently unknown, a partial \"blocking\" effect of unlabeled antibody with a change in MoAb biodistribution may be occurring.\r"

In addition, chronic and delayed toxicities, particularly Raynaud's phenomenon, have been reported in 6% to 37% of treated patients. In an attempt to minimize the acute and chronic effects of treatment which are related primarily to vinblastine and bleomycin, a randomized trial comparing the efficacy and toxicity of vinblastine + bleomycin + cisplatin + cyclophosphamide + dactinomycin (VAB-6) and etoposide + cisplatin (EP) was conducted on 164 eligible patients with good-prognosis GCT. Seventy-nine of 82 (96%) patients receiving VAB-6 and 76/82 (93%) receiving EP achieved a complete remission (CR) with or without adjunctive surgery. Similar proportions of patients in both arms were found at surgery to have necrosis/fibrosis or mature teratoma. With a median follow-up of 24.4 months in the VAB-6 arm and 25.9 months in the EP arm, the total, relapse-free, and event-free survival distributions were similar in the two arms. Patients receiving EP experienced less emesis (P = .05), higher nadir WBC (P = .06) and platelet counts (P = .01), less magnesium wasting (P = .0001), less mucositis (P = .09), and no pulmonary toxicity. No treatment-related mortality was observed. EP is an efficacious and less toxic regimen and is recommended for good-prognosis patients with disseminated GCT.\r"

All patients were initially treated with pelvic radiotherapy; arm A, 2,250 rad in ten fractions; and arms B and C, 4,500 rad in 20 fractions. Entry to arm C was discontinued early because of toxicity. In a multifactor analysis using proportional hazards models, no significant difference in survival was observed although there was a marginally significant difference in disease-free survival (P = .015) with arm B being superior to arm A. Stage (P less than .0001), grade (P less than .0001), and histology (P less than .008) were predictors of survival in the multifactor analysis. Performance status, age, and residual disease were significant predictors in the single factor analysis but were not predictive when correction was made for the effects of stage, grade, and histology. Five-year survival rates are 62% for arm A, 61% for arm B, and 66% for arm C. Median duration of follow-up is 8 years. Long-term complications of radiotherapy were seen in 19 patients on arm A, 11 on arm B, and 11 on arm C. Four patients who had received melphalan developed either a myelodysplastic syndrome or acute leukemia. Violations in covering the whole abdominal target volume were correlated with survival.\r"

Patients who relapse after conventional combination chemotherapy have a similar poor prognosis. Thirty-one such patients with lymphoma were studied to evaluate the efficacy of intensive radiotherapy (hyperfractionated total body irradiation [TBI] [1,320 rad]), and cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg/d for two days) followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT). Our results show a disease-free survival advantage (P = .002) for 14 patients who underwent ABMT immediately after induction of remission with 79% surviving at a median follow-up 49.2+ months, compared with a median survival of 5.2 months for 17 patients administered ABMT while in relapse and/or after failing conventional treatment. Our results support the use of aggressive therapy as early treatment for patients with poor prognostic features.\r"
