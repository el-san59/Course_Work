  ".W": "We review recent cross-disciplinary experimental and theoretical investigations on metabolism of the amino acid neurotransmitters glutamic acid and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain during hypoxia and hypercapnia and their possible role in central control of breathing. The roles of classical modifiers of central chemical drive to breathing (H+ and cholinergic mechanisms) are summarized. A brief perspective on the current widespread interest in GABA and glutamate in central control is given. The basic biochemistry of these amino acids and their roles in ammonia and bicarbonate metabolism are discussed. This review further addresses recent work on central respiratory effects of inhibitory GABA and excitatory glutamate. Current understanding of the sites and mechanisms of action of these amino acids on or near the ventral surface of the medulla is reviewed. We focus particularly on tracer kinetic investigations of glutamatergic and GABAergic mechanisms in hypoxia and hypercapnia and their possible role in the ventilatory response to hypoxia. We conclude with some speculative remarks on the critical importance of these investigations and suggest specific directions of research in central mechanisms of respiratory control.\r"

Fibers were classified as type I, IIa, IIb, or IIc on the basis of staining for myofibrillar adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase). Capillaries were identified in sections stained for ATPase at pH 4.2. Fiber cross-sectional areas and SDH activities were quantified using an image-processing system. During postnatal development, the proportions of type I fibers increased while type II fibers decreased. At birth, all type II fibers were IIc. From the 1st to the 2nd postnatal wk, the proportion of type IIc fibers decreased while the numbers of IIa and IIb increased. Thereafter the proportion of type IIb fibers continued to increase while the number of IIa steadily declined. At birth, capillarity, cross-sectional areas, and SDH activities of type I and II fibers were low compared with other postnatal age groups. Fiber cross-sectional areas increased progressively with age. The number of capillaries surrounding type I and II fibers increased markedly by the 2nd wk and then continued to increase at a slower rate. The number of capillaries per fiber area reached a peak by the 2nd wk and then declined as fiber cross-sectional area increased. Postnatal changes in capillarity depended on fiber type, being greatest in IIb. SDH activities of type I and II fibers were initially low during the first 2 postnatal wk and then peaked by the 3rd wk. After the 6th wk, fiber SDH activities decreased to adult values. Among the type II fibers, IIb showed the greatest change in SDH activity during early postnatal development.\r"

Tolerance was defined by progressive lower body negative pressure (LBNP) to presyncope. Maximal calf vascular conductance (Gmax) was measured. The carotid baroreflex was characterized using both stepwise R-wave-triggered and sustained (2 min) changes in neck chamber pressure. High-fit subjects tended to have lower LBNP tolerance than mid- and low-fit subjects but similar baroreflex responses. Subjects with poor LBNP tolerance had larger stroke volumes (SV) (120 +/- 6 vs. 103 +/- 3 ml) and greater decline in SV with LBNP to -40 mmHg (40 +/- 2 vs. 26 +/- 4%). Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis revealed that Gmax and steady-state gain of the carotid baroreflex contributed significantly toward explaining interindividual variations in LBNP tolerance. Thus endurance athletes may have decreased LBNP tolerance, but apparently not as a simple linear function of aerobic fitness. Orthostatic tolerance depends on complex interactions among functional characteristics that appear both related (Gmax and SV) and unrelated (baroreflex function) to fitness or exercise training.\r"

Anesthetized sheep were held in the lateral (n = 2), sternal recumbent (n = 2), or vertical (head-up; n = 2) position for 30 min. The ribs and intercostal muscles were excised along a 20-cm vertical distance of the chest wall region, which was sprayed with liquid Freon 22, cooled with liquid nitrogen, to facilitate the fastest possible freezing of the visceral and parietal pleura. We measured pleural space width in frozen hydrated blocks by reflected-light and low-temperature scanning electron microscopy and in freeze-substituted, fixed, and embedded tissue blocks by light and transmission electron microscopy. We combined the data from the two groups of sheep held sternally recumbent and vertical because the results were comparable. The average arithmetic mean data for pleural space width determined by reflected-light analysis for samples near the top (18.5 microns) and bottom (20.3 microns) of the chest, separated by 15 cm of lung height, varied inversely with lung height (n = 4; P less than 0.009). The average harmonic mean data demonstrated a similar gravity-dependent gradient (17.3 and 18.8 microns, respectively; P less than 0.02). Therefore a slight vertical gradient of approximately -0.10 micron/cm of lung height was found for costal pleural space width. Pleural space width in the most dependent recesses, such as the costodiaphragmatic recess, reached 1-2 mm. We never found any contacts between the visceral and parietal pleura with either of the frozen hydrated preparations. No points of mesothelial cell contact were revealed in the light- and transmission electron microscopic views of the freeze-substituted tissue, despite an apparent narrower pleural space associated with the tissue-processing steps. We conclude that the pleural space has a slightly nonuniform width, contacts if they occur must be very infrequent, and pleural liquid clearance is probably facilitated by liquid accumulation in dependent regions where lymphatic pathways exist.\r"

  ".W": "Although the left lung constitutes 42% of the total by weight and volume in dogs, carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DL) after left pneumonectomy in adults falls less than 30% at rest, indicating a significant increase of DL in the remaining lung. DL normally increases during exercise, presumably by recruitment of alveolar capillaries and surface area as lung volume (Vs) and pulmonary blood flow (Qc) increase. We asked whether the increase of DL in the remaining lung after pneumonectomy in adult dogs could be explained by this kind of passive recruitment by the increased volume and Qc in the remaining lung. We measured the relationship between DL and Qc with a rebreathing technique at increasing treadmill loads in adult foxhounds, before and 6 mo after left pneumonectomy, and the relationship between DL and Vs by the same technique under anesthesia as Vs was expanded. DL was reduced by 29.1% at rest and 26.5% with heavy exercise after left pneumonectomy, indicating either recruitment or new growth in the right lung. With the assumption that the right lung normally receives 58% of the Qc and contains 58% of the DL, DL of the right lung increased with Qc in accordance with the following relationships before and after left pneumonectomy: right lung DL (before pneumonectomy) = 6.44 + 2.40(Qc) (r = 0.963) and right lung DL (after pneumonectomy) = 7.51 + 1.75(Qc) (r = 0.958). Only approximately 7% of the increase in DL from rest to peak exercise could be attributed to the increase in Vs during exercise before pneumonectomy and approximately 15% after pneumonectomy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Determination of the frequency response of pneumotachographs is needed whenever they are used to measure high-frequency flows, such as in the forced oscillation method. When screen and capillary pneumotachographs are calibrated using an adiabatic compression in a closed box as a reference impedance, they can be adequately described by a series of inertial-resistive elements. However, this type of reference impedance strongly differs from the actual respiratory impedance (ZL). We studied the frequency response of pneumotachographs up to 250 Hz in reference to the impedance of a compressible gas oscillating in a long tube, taken as a more generalizable model of actual ZL. We found that, with this device, the series resistance-inertance models fail to describe the frequency response of the pneumotachograph. However, when compressible effects in the pneumotachograph are taken into account by adding to the resistive models a compliance (Cpn) corresponding to the compression in half of the inner volume of the pneumotachograph, the agreement with experiments becomes satisfactory. Gas compression-related phenomena were demonstrated to be negligible only when the parameter omega Cpn magnitude of ZL is much smaller than 1 (omega pulsation). Results obtained in normal humans have shown that such a correction is required above 100 Hz. Similar correction at lower frequency might also be necessary in cases of large respiratory impedance (e.g., babies, subjects with pathological lungs, and intubated subjects).\r"

  ".U": "91185227\r", 
  ".W": "The published morphometric data from human, cat, and dog lungs suggest that the power-law relationships between the numbers (Na and Nv) and diameters (Da and Dv) of arteries and veins and between the lengths (La and Lv) and diameters of the arteries and veins could be used as scaling rules for assigning dimensions and numbers to the intrapulmonary vessels of the arterial and venous trees of the dog lung. These rules, along with the dimensions of the extrapulmonary arteries and capillary sheet and the distensibility coefficients of the vessels obtained from the literature, were used to construct a steady-state hemodynamic model of the dog lung vascular bed. The model can be characterized approximately by 15 orders of arteries with Na approximately 2.07 Da-2.58 and 13 orders of veins with Nv approximately 2.53 Dv-2.61. For the intrapulmonary vessels (orders 1-12), La approximately 4.85 Da1.01, and Lv approximately 6.02 Da1.07. The average ratio of the numbers of vessels in consecutive orders is approximately 3.2 for the arteries and veins. These arterial and venous trees are connected by the capillary sheet with an undistended thickness of approximately 3.5 microns and an area of 33 m2. The average distensibility (% increase in diameter over the undistended diameter/Torr increase in transmural pressure) for the model arteries and veins is approximately 2.4%/Torr, and the distensibility of the capillary sheet (% increase in thickness over the undistended thickness/Torr increase in transmural pressure) is approximately 3.6%/Torr. The calculated arterial-capillary-venous volumes and compliances of the model agree well with experimental estimates of these variables in dogs. In addition, the model appears consistent with certain aspects of the pressure-flow relationships measured in dog lungs. The model appears to be a useful summary of some of the available data on pulmonary morphometry and vessel properties. It is anticipated that the model will provide the basis for dynamic modeling of the dog lung in the future.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies of monocytes isolated from peripheral blood have suggested that the lung sequesters these cells and has an important role in monocyte kinetics. However, the lung also provides the first capillary bed encountered by these cells after intravenous injection. A major criticism of the previous reports is that the behavior of monocytes in the lung may be altered as a result of the isolation procedure. The present study addresses this question by comparing the distribution of isolated monocytes (87% pure) in various organs 10 min after they were injected into either the central venous or the arterial circulation. The data show that the extraction of monocytes on the first passage through the lung after intravenous injection was 86.5 +/- 1.5%. After the monocytes had circulated for 10 min, the lungs contained 35.5 +/- 2.5% of the cells after intravenous injection and 29.7 +/- 2.2% after intra-arterial injection (P greater than 0.05). The lung-to-blood recovery ratio after either intravenous or intra-arterial injection showed that the lung contained a marginating pool of monocytes that was five to seven times the size of the circulating pool. The retention of monocytes in a region of the lung was proportional to the regional erythrocyte transit time. The half-life of the radiolabeled monocytes in the circulation was approximately 25 h. We conclude that the lung contains a marginating pool of monocytes and speculate that they concentrate there in preparation for migration into the interstitium and air space of the lung.\r"

Diaphragm (EMGdi) and scalene (EMGsc) electromyographic activity were monitored with surface electrodes and abdominal EMG activity (EMGab) with wire electrodes. Subjects were studied in the following conditions: 1) awake, 2) stage 2 sleep, 3) stage 3/4 sleep, 4) CPAP during stage 3/4 sleep, 5) CPAP plus end-tidal CO2 pressure (PETCO2) isocapnic to stage 2 sleep, and 6) CPAP plus PETCO2 isocapnic to stage 3/4 sleep. Inspired pulmonary resistance (RL) at peak flow rate and PETCO2 increased in all stages of sleep. Activity of EMGdi, EMGsc, and EMGab increased significantly in stage 3/4 sleep. CPAP reduced RL at peak flow, increased tidal volume and expired ventilation, and reduced PETCO2. EMGdi and EMGsc were reduced, and EMGab was silenced. During CPAP, with CO2 added to make PETCO2 isocapnic to stage 3/4 sleep, EMGsc and EMGab increased, but EMGdi was augmented in only one-half of the trials. EMG activity in this condition, however, was only 75% (EMGsc) and 43% (EMGab) of the activity observed during eupneic breathing in stage 3/4 sleep when PETCO2 was equal but RL was much higher. We conclude that during NREM sleep 1) inspiratory and expiratory muscles respond to internal inspiratory resistive loads and the associated dynamic airway narrowing and turbulent flow developed throughout inspiration, 2) some of the augmentation of respiratory muscle activity is also due to the hypercapnia that accompanies loading, and 3) the abdominal muscles are the most sensitive to load and CO2 and the diaphragm is the least sensitive.\r"

We assessed the influence of whole body DO2 redistribution among organs with respect to the commencement of O2 supply dependency. We measured DO2, VO2, and DO2c of whole body, liver, intestine, kidney, and remaining carcass in eight mongrel dogs during graded progressive hemorrhage. Whole body DO2 was redistributed such that the organ-to-whole body DO2 ratio declined for liver and kidney and increased for carcass. We then created a mathematical model wherein each organ-to-whole body DO2 ratio remained approximately constant at all values of whole body DO2 and assigned organ VO2 to predicted organ DO2 by interpolation and extrapolation of observed VO2-DO2 plots. The model predicted that O2 supply dependency without redistribution would have commenced at a higher value of whole body DO2 for whole body (8.11 +/- 0.89 vs. 6.98 +/- 1.16 ml.kg-1.min-1, P less than 0.05) and carcass (6.83 +/- 1.16 vs. 5.06 +/- 1.15 ml.kg-1.min-1, P less than 0.01) and at a lower value of whole body DO2 for liver (6.33 +/- 1.86 vs. 7.59 +/- 1.95, ml.kg-1.min-1, P less than 0.02) and kidney (1.25 +/- 0.64 vs. 4.54 +/- 1.29 ml.kg-1.min-1, P less than 0.01).

Subjects completed four randomly ordered cycle ergometer rides: ride 1, 30 min at 65% VO2max; ride 2, 60 min at 30% VO2max; ride 3, 60 min at 75% VO2max; and ride 4, 120 min at 65% VO2max. Blood samples were obtained at various times before and after the exercise sessions. Lymphocyte responses to the T cell mitogen concanavalin A were determined at each sample time through the incorporation of radiolabeled thymidine [( 3H]TdR). Despite differences in resting levels of [3H]TdR uptake, a consistent depression in mitogenesis was present 2 h after an exercise bout in all fitness groups. The magnitude of the reduction in T cell mitogenesis was not affected by an increase in exercise duration. A trend toward greater reduction was present in the highly fit group when exercise intensity was increased. The reduction in lymphocyte proliferation to the concanavalin A mitogen after exercise was a short-term phenomenon with recovery to resting (preexercise) values 24 h after cessation of the work bout. These data suggest that single sessions of submaximal exercise transiently reduce lymphocyte function in men and that this effect occurs irrespective of subject fitness level.\r"

  ".W": "As O2 delivery falls, tissues must extract increasing amounts of O2 from blood to maintain a normal O2 consumption. Below a critical delivery threshold, increases in O2 extraction cannot compensate for the falling delivery, and O2 uptake falls in a supply-dependent fashion. Numerous studies have identified a critical delivery in whole animals, but the regional contributions to the critical O2 delivery are less fully understood. In the present study, we explored the limits of O2 extraction in the isolated liver, seeking to determine 1) the normal relationship between O2 consumption and delivery in the liver and 2) the relationship of hepatic lactate extraction to the drop in hepatic O2 consumption at low O2 deliveries. To answer these questions, using support dogs as a source for oxygenated metabolically stable blood, we studied eight pump-perfused canine livers. By lowering the blood flow in a model of stagnant hypoxia, we explored the relationship between O2 consumption and delivery over the entire physiological range of O2 delivery. The critical O2 delivery was 28 +/- 5 (SD) ml.kg-1.min-1; the livers extracted 68 +/- 9% of the delivered O2 before reaching supply dependence. This suggests that the liver has an O2 extraction capacity quite similar to the body as a whole and not different from other tissues that have been isolated. At high blood flows, the livers extracted approximately 10% of the lactate delivered by the blood, but the arteriovenous lactate differences were small. At low blood flows, however, the livers changed from lactate consumption to production. The O2 delivery coinciding with the dropoff in lactate extraction did not differ significantly from the critical O2 delivery. We conclude that reductions in lactate uptake by the liver do not precede the transition to O2 supply dependence.\r"

Thigh glucose uptake during rest, exercise, and recovery was decreased by 64, 33, and 42%, respectively, by Intralipid, whereas muscle glycogen breakdown and release of lactate, pyruvate, and citrate were unaffected. Concentrations of glucose, glucose 6-phosphate, and lactate in muscle before and at termination of exercise were unaffected by Intralipid. During exercise, net leg uptake of plasma free fatty acids was not measurably increased by Intralipid, whereas uptake of ketone bodies was. Local respiratory quotient across the leg was not changed by Intralipid (control 0.87 +/- 0.02, Intralipid 0.86 +/- 0.02). Arterial concentrations of insulin, norepinephrine, and epinephrine were similar in the two trials. It is concluded that at rest and during exercise at a moderate intensity (requiring approximately equal contributions from fat and carbohydrate metabolism), muscle carbohydrate metabolism is affected only with regard to uptake of glucose when plasma concentrations of lipid and lipid metabolites are increased. This effect may be by direct inhibition of glucose transport rather than by the classic glucose-fatty acid cycle.\r"

  ".W": "Effect of edema on the relationship between rate of fluid filtration and vascular pressure was studied in ventilated isolated dog lung lobes blood-perfused at constant flow. Constant rate of lobe weight gain (S), representing transvascular fluid flux, was obtained at different venous pressures (Pv) as Pv was increased stepwise from 2 to 40 and then similarly decreased from 40 to 2 Torr (n = 6). In another group (n = 6), edema was maximized by reversing the sequence of Pv change; S was obtained during similar Pv steps as Pv was decreased from 40 to 2 and then returned to 40 Torr. In both groups, delta S was disproportionately greater for delta Pv at higher Pv's, with S vs. Pv fit by an exponential curve (P less than 0.001). The exponential relationship was independent of lung hydration inasmuch as greater edema on the second limb of Pv change did not alter the curve (P greater than 0.05). At 144% weight gain, interstitial compliance was 55.5 +/- 26.8 ml.100 g-1.Torr-1 (n = 10). Interstitial pressure reportedly remains constant, i.e., fails to increase to further buffer fluid filtration, after transition of the lung interstitium from low to high compliance at approximately 40% lung weight gain. If so, then the exponential S vs. Pv relationship observed in the present study at elevated interstitial compliance does not appear related to tissue pressure-buffering effects.\r"

Rates of endogenous glucose production (EGP) were measured using D-[6-3H]glucose infusions and fuel oxidation using indirect calorimetry. In the basal state, cirrhotic subjects had similar rates of EGP compared with controls. Forearm release of alanine and lactate was significantly greater in cirrhotic subjects (P less than 0.05), suggesting increased basal rates of gluconeogenesis. During exercise, EGP increased 2- to 2.5-fold in control subjects (P less than 0.01) but did not increase in cirrhotic subjects. Despite lower glucose concentrations in cirrhotic subjects, progressive hypoglycemia did not occur during exercise, probably because cirrhotic subjects demonstrated increased plasma concentrations of fat-derived substrates and derived a greater percentage of total energy requirement from fat oxidation than did controls (P less than 0.05) and because forearm muscle glucose extraction was significantly lower in cirrhotic subjects compared with controls (0.5 vs. 3.6%, respectively; P less than 0.05). During recovery, control subjects demonstrated significant increases in EGP rates compared with both the basal and exercise periods, but cirrhotic subjects showed no increase. In conclusion, cirrhotic subjects failed to demonstrate the normal increase in EGP during and after exercise. Significant hypoglycemia during exercise did not occur, possibly because of the increased availability of fat-derived fuels, which may spare the requirement for circulating glucose as an oxidative fuel for exercising muscle tissues.\r"

  ".W": "The development of animal models of respiratory muscle training would be useful in studying the physiological effects of training. Hence, we studied the effects of chronic resistive loading (CRL) for 5 wk on mass, composition, and mechanics of inspiratory muscles in laboratory rats. CRL was produced by means of a tracheal cannula (loaded animals) and results were compared with sham-operated controls. Acutely, upper airway obstruction led to a doubling of inspiratory pleural pressure excursion and 25% decrease in respiratory rate. We observed no changes in lung pressure-volume curves, nor in the geometry of the respiratory system in loaded compared with control animals. Muscle mass normalized for body mass increased in the diaphragm (DI) and the wet weight-to-dry weight ratio increased in the sternomastoid (SM) in loaded compared with control animals. Loaded animals demonstrated a decrease in ether extractable (fat) content of the DI and SM muscles but not the gastrocnemius. For the DI there was no change in length at which active tension was maximal (Lo), but there was an increase in maximum tension at lengths close to Lo in loaded compared with control rats. Endurance did not change, although twitch tensions remained higher in loaded compared with control rats. We conclude that 1) alteration of inspiratory muscle structure and function occurs in rats with CRL; 2) the DI and SM demonstrate different adaptive responses to CRL; and 3) although maximum tension increases, endurance does not.\r"

Maximal exercise capacity was reduced in patients [69% of pred maximal O2 uptake (VO2max)] compared with controls (104% pred VO2max, P less than 0.01); however, maximal expired minute ventilation-to-maximum voluntary ventilation ratio and maximal heart rate were not significantly different between controls and patients. Overall, there was a close relationship between VO2max and FEV1 (r2 = 0.62). Resting EELV was similar between controls and patients [53% of total lung capacity (TLC)], but at maximal exercise the controls decreased EELV to 45% of TLC (P less than 0.01), whereas the patients increased EELV to 58% of TLC (P less than 0.05). Overall, EELV was significantly correlated to both VO2max (r = -0.71, P less than 0.001) and FEV1 (r = -0.68, P less than 0.001). This relationship suggests a ventilatory influence on exercise capacity; however, the increased EELV and associated pleural pressures could influence cardiovascular function during exercise. We suggest that the increase in EELV should be considered a response reflective of the effect of airflow limitation on the ventilatory response to exercise.\r"

  ".W": "The role of neuromuscular activity in maintaining the normal enzyme heterogeneity found in a predominantly fast mixed muscle was studied. Enzymatic profiles of single fibers in the adult cat medial gastrocnemius (MG) were examined after almost complete elimination of neuromuscular activity for 6 mo. Inactivity was achieved by spinal cord isolation (SI), i.e., spinal transection at T12-T13 and L7-S1 combined with bilateral dorsal rhizotomy between the two transection sites. Cross-sectional area and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (GPD) activities were determined in a population of fibers identified in frozen serial cross sections. Each fiber was categorized as light or dark on the basis of its staining characteristics for qualitative myosin adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase), alkaline preincubation, and its reaction to fast and slow myosin heavy chain (MHC) antibodies. SI resulted in a conversion of nearly all light (approximately 36% in the control) to dark ATPase fibers. Virtually all MG fibers in the SI cats reacted with the fast MHC antibody, whereas very few fibers reacted with slow MHC antibody. On the basis of fiber cross-sectional area, it was estimated that the MG atrophied by approximately 10% after SI. Compared with the mean of the dark and light ATPase fibers in control (weighted by the percent fiber type distribution), mean SDH activity was significantly lower (approximately 70%) and mean GPD activity was significantly higher (approximately 120%) in the SI cats. These data indicate that prolonged electrical silence of a mixed fast hindlimb extensor results in virtually all fibers expressing fast MHC as well as oxidative and glycolytic enzyme profiles normally observed in fast glycolytic fibers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Subjects performed 20 sustained maximal inspiratory maneuvers daily for 6-18 wk. Maximal inspiratory pressures (MIP) increased from 124 +/- 10 to 187 +/- 9 (SE) cmH2O (P less than 0.005). Exponents of the power function relationships between mouth pressure (Pm) and the intensity of the sensation of force, corrected for inspiratory duration, during magnitude scaling of resistive and elastic ventilatory loads were the same before and after training (P greater than 0.05). However, absolute sensation intensity (S) during resistive and elastic loading was reduced significantly after strength training but returned toward baseline levels greater than or equal to 8 wk after the cessation of training when the MIP had fallen to 150 +/- 5 cmH2O. The absolute S at a given Pm during ventilatory loading changed inversely with changes in MIP (P less than 0.001). Furthermore the relationship between absolute S and Pm expressed as a proportion of the MIP (Pm/MIP) was constant over testing periods. These results suggest that the sensation of respiratory muscle force reflects the proportion of the maximum force utilized in breathing and may be based on the level of respiratory motor command signals.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of a single bout of exercise to exhaustion on pancreatic insulin secretion were determined in seven untrained men by use of a 3-h hyperglycemic clamp with plasma glucose maintained at 180 mg/100 ml. Clamps were performed either 12 h after an intermittent treadmill run at approximately 77% maximum O2 consumption or without prior exercise. Arterialized blood samples for glucose, insulin, and C-peptide determination were obtained from a heated hand vein. The peak insulin response during the early phase (0-10 min) of the postexercise clamp was higher (81 +/- 8 vs. 59 +/- 9 microU/ml; P less than 0.05) than in the nonexercise clamp. Incremental areas under the insulin (376 +/- 33 vs. 245 +/- 51 microU.ml-1.min) and C-peptide (17 +/- 2 vs. 12 +/- 1 ng.ml-1.min) curves were also greater (P less than 0.05) during the early phase of the postexercise clamp. No differences were observed in either insulin concentrations or whole body glucose disposal during the late phase (15-180 min). Area under the C-peptide curve was greater during the late phase of the postexercise clamp (650 +/- 53 vs. 536 +/- 76 ng.ml-1.min, P less than 0.05). The exercise bout induced muscle soreness and caused an elevation in plasma creatine kinase activity (142 +/- 32 vs. 305 +/- 31 IU/l; P less than 0.05) before the postexercise clamp. We conclude that in untrained men a bout of running to exhaustion increased pancreatic beta-cell insulin secretion during the early phase of the hyperglycemic clamp. Increased insulin secretion during the late phase of the clamp appeared to be compensated by increased insulin clearance.\r"

Exogenous neuropeptides can induce microvascular leak. Therefore we tested whether dry gas hyperpnea also elicits bronchovascular hyperpermeability by measuring Evans blue-labeled albumin extravasation along the airways of mechanically ventilated guinea pigs. We found that 1) room temperature dry gas hyperpnea increased Evans blue extravasation in extrapulmonary and intrapulmonary airways as a specific consequence of local airway heat/water losses, 2) capsaicin pretreatment ablated the bronchoconstrictor response to dry gas hyperpnea and reduced bronchovascular leak only in intrapulmonary airways, 3) phosphoramidon given to capsaicin-pretreated animals partially restored dry gas hyperpnea-induced bronchoconstriction and increased the vascular hyperpermeability response to hyperpnea in intrapulmonary airways, and 4) propranolol administration had no important effects on any of these airway responses. We conclude that dry gas hyperpnea causes bronchovascular hyperpermeability in guinea pigs. Tachykinins have a dominant role in this response in the intrapulmonary airways, although another mechanism may also contribute to the microvascular leak in the extrapulmonary airways.\r"

The values have been compared with tracheal arterial inflow (Qtr) by use of an electromagnetic flow probe and with tracheal arterial perfusion pressure (Ptr) produced by mechanical perfusion. Changes in blood flow were caused by injections of methacholine, phenylephrine, and histamine into the perfusion circuit. These interventions produced a range of measurements for each animal. Correlations of Qm against Qtr were significant in two of five animals (R = 0.03-0.93); correlations of Qm against Ptr were significant in two of four animals (R = 0.56-0.96). Percent changes in Qtr were generally much larger than those of Qm, and there was considerable variability between Qm and either Qtr or Ptr. Qm reflected the same vascular changes as Ptr or Qtr in 28 interventions and showed an opposing change in 4 cases. In 11 interventions, changes measured by Ptr or Qtr were not reflected by any changes in Qm. Thus qualitative changes in tracheal perfusion measured with these methods were usually the same; quantitatively the three methods showed great differences. These differences may reflect different regulatory mechanisms in various components of the tracheal vasculature or different technical aspects of the methods used.\r"

Capsaicin dose-dependently increased fluid output from the nose (nasal fluid output) and the lateral nasal gland (glandular fluid output). The secretory response to capsaicin (80 nmol/kg ia) was completely blocked by atropine and hexamethonium, indicating that a cholinergic reflex mediates capsaicin-induced nasal hypersecretion in this model. The amount of nasal secretions collected as nasal fluid output was similar to that collected as glandular fluid output, indicating that the lateral nasal gland contributes significantly to this increase in nasal secretions induced by intra-arterially administered capsaicin. In addition, the nasal fluid output had a higher protein concentration and osmolality than the glandular fluid output. This finding suggests that the gland is not the sole site of action of capsaicin on the nasal secretory response. It is likely that capsaicin also increases microvascular permeability, thereby contributing further to the alteration in the nasal secretions. Finally, repeated subcutaneous injections of capsaicin significantly reduced the secretory response to capsaicin, indicating the development of desensitization in vivo. These results support the role of capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves in mediating a secretory response in the ferret nose.\r"

Our aim was to determine, in fetal sheep, the effects of prolonged oligohydramnios on the incidence and amplitude of tracheal pressure fluctuations associated with fetal breathing movements (FBM), on tracheal flow rate during periods of FBM (VtrFBM) and periods of apnea (Vtrapnea), on tracheal pressure relative to amniotic sac pressure, and on amniotic sac pressure relative to atmospheric pressure. In five sheep, oligohydramnios was induced by draining amniotic and allantoic fluids from 107 to 135 days of gestation (411.8 +/- 24.4 ml/day), resulting in fetal lung hypoplasia. In five control sheep, amniotic fluid volume was 732.3 +/- 94.4 ml. Oligohydramnios increased the incidence of FBM by 14% at 120 and 125 days and the amplitude of FBM by 30-34% at 120-130 days compared with controls. From 120 days onward, VtrFBM was 35-55% lower in experimental fetuses than in controls. Influx of lung liquid during FBM was 87% lower in experimental fetuses than in controls. Vtrapnea, tracheal pressure, and amniotic sac pressure were not significantly altered by oligohydramnios. Our tracheal flow rate data suggest that transient changes in lung liquid volume during periods of FBM and periods of apnea were diminished by oligohydramnios. We conclude that the primary factor in the etiology of oligohydramnios-induced lung hypoplasia is not an inhibition of FBM (as measured by tracheal pressure fluctuations) or a reduction in amniotic fluid pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A second aim was to study whether myosin heavy chain (MHC) synthesis rates are coordinated with the cardiac mass responses. Female rats received either a vehicle (1% aqueous carboxymethyl cellulose in saline) or hydrocortisone 21-acetate for 1, 3, 7, 11, and 15 days. Peak cardiac enlargement (10-15%) was observed after 7 days of hormone treatment in two separate series of experiments. The enlargement was maintained through 11 days of steroid injections but by 15 days had declined toward control levels. MHC synthesis measurements were performed by constant infusion of [3H]leucine. Leucine specific activities were similar among precursor pools (intracellular, extracellular, and leucyl-tRNA) and did not vary with steroid treatments. Fractional synthesis rates of ventricular MHC (%/day) did not change during the period of increase in ventricular mass but were reduced to 56-59% of controls (-11/19.5) at 7 and 11 days of treatment, when ventricular mass increases were highest. MHC breakdown (%/day) was reduced to approximately 60% (-11.5/18.7) of controls at 7 and 11 days. Changes in total protein synthesis, which was measured in isolated perfused hearts, were similar to the MHC responses and indicated that the alterations in MHC synthesis are synchronized with the hormonal effects on total protein metabolism. These results demonstrate that peak cardiac enlargement is not maintained with long-term glucocorticoid treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine whether this bilateral deficit is due to neural mechanisms. For one experiment, three groups of subjects (untrained, cyclists, and weight lifters) performed maximal one- or two-limb isometric tasks for which the two-limb combinations were either both legs or the left arm and the right leg. The untrained subjects exhibited a bilateral deficit, the cyclists did not, and the weight lifters produced a bilateral facilitation. Although the changes in electromyogram did not completely parallel the changes in force, variability in the filtered electromyogram associated with the maximal contraction was too great for reliable interpretation. The arm-leg task demonstrated that the bilateral deficit affects only homologous contralateral muscles. For the second experiment, two groups of subjects (bilateral deficit and bilateral facilitation) performed maximal left leg contractions while the right leg either rested or was activated with electrical stimulation. All subjects produced an increase in the maximal voluntary left leg force during right leg electromyostimulation. The magnitude of the increase was greatest for the bilateral facilitation subjects. These results suggest that interlimb interactions during maximal bilateral contractions are mediated by neural mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "The present investigation was designed to examine the influence of water temperature and prior hyperventilation on some of the potentially hazardous responses evoked by immersion in cold water. Eight naked subjects performed headout immersions of 2-min duration into stirred water at 5, 10, and 15 degrees C and at 10 degrees C after 1 min of voluntary hyperventilation. Analysis of the respiratory and cardiac data collected during consecutive 10-s periods showed that, at the 0.18-m/s rate of immersion employed, differences between the variables recorded on immersion in water at 5 and 10 degrees C were due to the duration of the responses evoked rather than their magnitude during the first 20 s. The exception to this was the tidal volume of subjects, which was higher on immersion in water at 15 degrees C than at 5 or 10 degrees C. The results suggested that the respiratory drive evoked during the first seconds of immersion was more closely reflected in the rate rather than the depth of breathing at this time. Hyperventilation before immersion in water at 10 degrees C did not attenuate the respiratory responses seen on immersion. It is concluded that, during the first critical seconds of immersion, the initial responses evoked by immersion in water at 10 degrees C can represent as great a threat as those in water at 5 degrees C; also, in water at 10 degrees C, the respiratory component of this threat is not influenced by the biochemical alterations associated with prior hyperventilation.\r"

  ".W": "This study of newborn (3-10 day old) and juvenile (6-8 mo old) in situ isolated lamb lungs was undertaken to determine whether 1) histamine receptor blockade accentuates hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction more in newborns than in juveniles, 2) histamine infusion causes a decrease in both normoxic pulmonary vascular resistance and hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in newborns, and 3) the H1-mediated dilator response to infused histamine in newborns is due to enhanced dilator prostaglandin release. Pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) was determined at baseline and in response to histamine (infusion rates of 0.1-10.0 micrograms.kg-1 min-1) in control, H1-blocked, H2-blocked, combined H1- and H2-blocked, and cyclooxygenase-inhibited H2-blocked lungs under \"normoxic\" (inspired O2 fraction 0.28) and hypoxic (inspired O2 fraction 0.04) conditions. In newborns, H1-receptor blockade markedly accentuated baseline hypoxic Ppa, and H2-receptor blockade caused an increase in baseline normoxic Ppa. In juveniles, neither H1 nor H2 blockade altered baseline normoxic or hypoxic Ppa. Histamine infusion caused both H1- and H2-mediated decreases in Ppa in normoxic and hypoxic newborn lungs. In juvenile lungs, histamine infusion also caused H2-mediated decreases in Ppa during both normoxia and hypoxia. During normoxia, histamine infusion caused an H1-mediated increase in normoxic Ppa in juveniles as previously seen in mature animals; however, during hypoxia there was an H1-mediated decrease in Ppa at low doses of histamine followed by an increase in Ppa. Combined histamine-receptor blockade markedly reduced both dilator and pressor responses to histamine infusion. Indomethacin failed to alter the H1-mediated dilator response to histamine in newborns.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of two isoforms of human endothelin (ET) on the pulmonary and systemic vascular beds were compared in the anesthetized intact-chest rabbit under conditions of constant pulmonary blood flow and left atrial pressure. Intralobar bolus injections of ET-1 (0.1-1 micrograms) and ET-3 (1-3 micrograms) produced modest vasoconstriction in the pulmonary vascular bed, whereas both peptides decreased systemic arterial pressure. The pulmonary vasoconstrictor response to ET-1 and ET-3 was inhibited by intralobar infusion of nitrendipine but was not altered by indomethacin. In contrast to the small effects of ET-1 and ET-3 on intact pulmonary resistance vessels, both peptides markedly contracted isolated pulmonary conductance vessels, with greater activity on venous than on arterial segments. Intravenous bolus injection of ET-1 (0.1-0.3 micrograms) or ET-3 (0.3-1 microgram) decreased systemic arterial pressure, increased cardiac output, and markedly decreased systemic vascular resistance. Higher doses of ET-1 produce a biphasic systemic vascular response with a prominent secondary pressor component. The present data suggest that the pulmonary vasoconstrictor activity of ET-1 is greater than that of ET-3 and their pressor activity depends on an extracellular source of calcium. The pulmonary and systemic hemodynamic effects of ET-1 and ET-3 in the rabbit do not depend on cyclooxygenase products. The systemic vasodilator response to ET-1 is not altered by first-pass lung transit. Furthermore the systemic vasodilator response to both peptides occurs independent of activation of muscarinic, beta 2-adrenergic, and platelet-activating factor receptors. Although ET-1 and ET-3 were initially reported as vasoconstrictor peptides, the present data suggest that, by having unique and potent systemic vasodilator activity, ET-1 and ET-3 act differently in the systemic and pulmonary vascular beds under resting conditions in the rabbit.\r"

Estimated fluid intake during the race for HN was 12.5 +/- 1.6 (SE) liters over 9 h 41 min (+/- 28 min). HN excreted a net fluid excess of 2.95 +/- 0.56 (range 1.2-5.9) liters compared with a fluid deficit of 2.7 +/- 0.3% body weight in NN. The sodium deficit was 153 +/- 35 mmol in HN and 187 +/- 37 mmol in NN. Despite the fluid overload, plasma volume was decreased by 24.1 +/- 5.0% in HN compared with 8.2 +/- 2.6% in NN. Serum renin activity (5.1 +/- 2.0 ng.ml-1.h-1), aldosterone concentrations (410 +/- 34 ng/l), creatinine clearances (174.8 +/- 28.2 ml/min), and urine output (6.4 +/- 1.0 ml/min) were markedly elevated in HN during recovery. Thus the hyponatremia of exercise results from fluid retention in subjects who ingest abnormally large fluid volumes during prolonged exercise.\r"

In four anesthetized mongrel dogs, we measured the peripheral airway resistance (Rp) to gas flow out of a wedged lung segment in different lobes on multiple occasions. We obtained dose-response curves of peripheral airways challenged with iv histamine or aerosols through the bronchoscope. During the same iv bolus challenge, whole lung airway pressure (Paw) responses to histamine were also measured. On separate occasions, changes in lung resistance (RL) were measured after the whole lung was challenged with a histamine aerosol. Reactivity was assessed from the dose-response curves for Rp and RL as the PD50 (dose required to produce a 50% increase); for changes in Paw we calculated the PD15 (dose required to produce a 15% increase over baseline). Results for Rp showed considerably more variability among different lobes in a given animal with the aerosol challenge through the bronchoscope than with the iv challenge. With aerosol challenge there were no significant differences in the mean PD50 for Rp among any of the animals. However, with the iv challenge two of the dogs showed significant differences from the others in reactivity assessed with Rp (P less than 0.01). Moreover, the differences found in the peripheral airways with iv challenge reflected differences found in whole lung reactivity assessed with either iv challenge (Paw vs. Rp, r2 = 0.96) or whole lung aerosol challenge (RL vs. Rp, r2 = 0.84). We conclude that the measurement of the collateral resistance response to iv challenge may provide a sensitive method for assessing airway reactivity.\r"

By use of path analysis, the genetic variance of measured peak O2 uptake was estimated at 77% (P less than 0.001), at 71% (P less than 0.001) after adjustment for weight and skinfold thickness, and at 66% (P less than 0.001) after additional adjustment for weekly hours of sports participation. O2 uptake at a heart rate of 150 beats/min, a submaximal estimate of exercise capacity, showed less genetic variance, i.e., 61% (P less than 0.001) before and 50% (P less than 0.001) after weight adjustment and only 16% (NS) after correction for life-style factors. Similarly, the heritability of peak O2 uptake, when estimated from submaximal data, was 68% (P less than 0.001), 40% (P = 0.05), and 26% (NS), respectively. Mechanical efficiency had no significant genetic component. O2 uptake at the respiratory exchange ratio of 0.95 and the slope of the curvilinear relationship between CO2 output and O2 uptake, used to assess the anaerobic energy generation during progressive exercise, showed significant (P less than 0.001) genetic variance before (72 and 74%) and after adjustment for weight (67 and 69%) and sports participation (63 and 57%). The heritability of peak aerobic power remained significant (58%; P less than 0.001) after adjustment for these expressions of anaerobic energy generation. In conclusion, the genetic variance of measured peak O2 uptake is significant and persists after adjustment for anthropometric characteristics, life-style factors, anaerobic energy generation, and mechanical efficiency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the magnitude of this training response is exercise intensity specific. Obese Zucker rats were randomly divided into sedentary (SED), low-intensity (LI), and high-intensity (HI) exercise groups. For the LI rats, exercise training consisted of running on a rodent treadmill at 18 m/min up an 8% grade for 90 min. Rats in the HI group ran at 24 m/min up an 8% grade for four 17-min bouts with 3 min between bouts. Both exercise groups performed the same amount of work and trained 5 days/wk for 7 wk. To evaluate muscle insulin resistance, rat hindlimbs were perfused for 30 min with perfusate containing 6 mM glucose (0.15 mu Ci of D-[14C(U)] glucose/ml) and either a maximal (10.0 mU/ml) or a submaximal (0.50 mU/ml) insulin concentration. Perfusions were performed 48-56 h after the last exercise bout and a 12-h fast.

We characterized the activity of these oscillations in nine healthy young men who underwent 0, 10, and 40 Torr of lower body negative pressure (LBNP). Postocclusive SkBF was estimated in both forearms simultaneously in a stable thermal environment with laser-Doppler velocimetry. Periodic behavior of SkBF was characterized by frequency-domain power spectral analysis. LBNP at 40 Torr increased heart rate, decreased forearm blood flow, and decreased postocclusive SkBF amplitude but did not change the periodicity of SkBF in the frequency response range that is characteristic of postischemic SkBF oscillations (0.11 +/- 0.04 Hz). We observed that LBNP did not alter the frequency response of the postocclusive SkBF as quantified in the periodogram, even though the amplitude of the SkBF was markedly diminished as a part of the general decrease in arm blood flow. We found inferential evidence for a disseminated common pacemaker mechanism that performs similarly at distant sites. We conclude that the LBNP baroreflex-mediated modulation of SkBF reduces the amplitude but does not change the frequency behavior of postocclusive SkBF. We propose on the basis of our findings that the preservation of vasomotion suggests that this phenomenon is an adaptation to the ischemic changes induced by disruption of blood flow.\r"

However, doubt has remained as to whether these changes in breathing pattern are induced exclusively by direct stimulation of pulmonary C fibers or whether secondary stimulation of slowly adapting pulmonary stretch receptors by capsaicin-induced reflex bronchoconstriction also contributes to the response. To determine the contribution of this secondary mechanism to changes in breathing pattern, we evoked the pulmonary chemoreflex in spontaneously breathing dogs before and after blockade of muscarinic receptors with atropine. Right atrial injections of capsaicin before the administration of atropine induced a classical pulmonary chemoreflex, i.e., apnea, hypotension, and bradycardia followed by rapid shallow breathing and bronchoconstriction. After atropine, all components of the pulmonary chemoreflex induced by right atrial injections of capsaicin remained intact except bronchoconstriction. However, the absolute magnitude of the change in each component of the reflex except apnea was significantly attenuated. We conclude that the classic pulmonary chemoreflex is a complex phenomenon initiated primarily by stimulation of pulmonary C fibers but significantly influenced by secondary stimulation of slowly adapting pulmonary stretch receptors.\r"

They exercised 30 min on a bicycle ergometer at 80 and 40% of the predetermined maximal O2 uptake (VO2max). Exercise at 80% VO2max was performed twice, at room temperature (20 degrees C) and in a cold room (0 degrees C), whereas exercise at 40% was performed only at room temperature (20 degrees C). Blood was collected from the antecubital vein immediately before and after exercise. Sweat was collected from the hypogastric region by use of gauze pads. It was shown that the plasma ammonia level was elevated after exercise at 80% VO2max and remained stable after exercise at 40% VO2max. The volume of sweat produced during exercise at 80% VO2max at 20 degrees C was 428 +/- 138 ml and at 0 degrees C 245 +/- 86 ml and during exercise at 40% VO2max was 183 +/- 69 ml. The ammonia concentration in the sweat after exercise at 80% VO2max at 20 degrees C was 7,140 mumol/l and at 0 degrees C 11,816 mumol/l. After exercise at 40% VO2max, it was 2,076 mumol/l. The total ammonia lost through the sweat during exercise at 80% VO2max was similar at both temperatures, despite the difference in the sweat volume (at 20 degrees C, 3,360 +/- 2,080 mumol; at 0 degrees C, 3,310 +/- 1,250 mumol). During exercise at 40% VO2max, it was 350 +/- 230 mumol. These results show that part of ammonia formed during exercise is lost with sweat. The amount lost increases with increased work rate and the plasma ammonia concentration.\r"

Respiratory infection by Sendai virus in neonatal rats also has been reported to cause permanent changes in lung morphology and increased numbers of bronchiolar mast cells and eosinophils. We evaluated pulmonary mechanics, gas exchange, and airway responsiveness in rats at 7 and 13-16 wk after neonatal Sendai virus infection. Rats from the virus group had lower arterial PO2 and increased total lung resistance compared with controls. There were no significant differences between groups for arterial PCO2, dynamic lung compliance, quasi-static respiratory system compliance, or vital capacity. Rats from the infected group were significantly more sensitive to aerosolized methacholine than were controls, although both virus and control groups became less sensitive with age. We conclude that neonatal Sendai virus infection in rats results in persistent alterations in lung function and airway responsiveness. This phenomenon may be valuable for the study of the relationships among airway inflammation, lung morphology, and airway hyperresponsiveness, and it may be relevant to human airway disease.\r"

To investigate this association, we utilized a system in which neonatal calves are exposed to chronic hypobaric hypoxia and develop severe pulmonary hypertension. For the present study, one of each pair of six age-matched pairs of neonatal calves was continuously exposed to hypobaric hypoxia at 4,500 m (CH); the other remained at 1,500 m. At 2 wk of age, mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP), dynamic lung compliance (Cdyn), resistance (RL), and static respiratory system compliance (Crs) were measured at 4,500 m in both CH and control calves exposed acutely to hypoxia (C). These measurements were repeated after cumulative administrations of nebulized methacholine (MCh). Tissues were removed for histological examination and assessment of bronchial ring contractility to MCh and KCl. After 2 wk of hypobaric hypoxia, MPAP (C 35 +/- 1.7 vs. CH 120 +/- 7 mmHg, P less than 0.001) and RL (C 2.64 +/- 0.16 vs CH 4.99 +/- 0.47 cmH2O.l-1s, P less than 0.001) increased.

Compared with airways of C calves, airways of CH animals did not exhibit in vivo or in vitro MCh hyperresponsiveness; however, in vitro contractility to KCl of airways from CH animals was significantly increased.

We compared seven patients who had unavailability of muscle glycogen and blood glucose as oxidative fuels due to muscle phosphofructokinase deficiency (PFKD) with five patients who had a selective defect in long-chain fatty acid oxidation due to carnitine palmitoyltransferase deficiency (CPTD) and with six healthy subjects. Peak cycle exercise work rate, peak O2 uptake (Vo2), and arteriovenous O2 difference were markedly lower (P less than 0.001) for PFKD patients (23 +/- 6 W, 14 +/- 2 ml.min-1.kg-1, and 7.1 +/- 0.5 ml/dl, respectively) than for CPTD patients (142 +/- 33 W, 31 +/- 4 ml.min-1.kg-1, and 15.0 +/- 0.8 ml/dl, respectively) or healthy subjects (171 +/- 17 W, 36 +/- 1 ml.min-1.kg-1, and 16.4 +/- 0.7 ml/dl, respectively). Peak cardiac output (Q) was similar (P less than 0.05) in all three groups, but the slope of increase in Q (l/min) on Vo2 (l/min) from rest to exercise (delta Q/ delta Vo2) was more than twofold greater (P less than 0.001) for PFKD patients (11.2 +/- 1.2) than for CPTD patients (4.6 +/- 0.6) and healthy subjects (4.6 +/- 0.2). Increasing availability of blood-borne oxidative substrates capable of metabolically bypassing the defect at phosphofructokinase (by fasting plus prolonged moderate exercise to increase plasma free fatty acids or by iv lactate infusion) increased peak work rate, Vo2, and arteriovenous O2 difference, lacked consistent effect on peak Q, and normalized delta Q/ delta Vo2 in PFKD patients. The results extend our previous observations in patients with a block in muscle glycogen but not blood glucose oxidation due to phosphorylase deficiency and imply that specific unavailability of muscle glycogen as an oxidizable fuel is primarily responsible for abnormal muscle oxidative metabolism and associated exercise intolerance and exaggerated delta Q/ delta Vo2 in muscle PFKD. The findings also endorse the concept that factors closely linked with muscle oxidative phosphorylation participate in regulating delta Q/ delta Vo2, likely via activation of metabolically sensitive muscle afferents.\r"

  ".W": "A theoretical analysis of the effect of altitude on running performance is presented using a mathematical model we have recently described and validated (J. Appl. Physiol. 67: 453-465, 1989). This model relates the average power output available over a given running time for a given combination of anaerobic capacity, maximal aerobic power, and endurance capability. For short sprinting distances, the contribution of aerobic metabolism to the energy requirement is small and the speed sustained is high. The reduction of maximal aerobic power with altitude is, thus, negligible, whereas the reduction of aerodynamic resistance is beneficial. Accordingly the performance steadily increases with altitude (e.g., average speed for 100 m at Mexico City is 101.9% of the average speed at sea level). On the other hand, the reduction in maximal aerobic power with altitude is associated with a reduction in performance over middle and long distances (800 m to marathon). For 400 m an improvement in performance is observed up to an altitude of approximately 2,400-2,500 m (average speed approximately 101.4% of sea level speed). Beyond this altitude the reduction in air density cannot compensate for the reduction in maximal aerobic power, and the performance deteriorates. Tables of performances equivalent to the current world records for selected altitudes ranging from 0 to 4,000 m are proposed.\r"

  ".W": "In six anesthetized and mechanically ventilated adult sheep, the bronchial artery was perfused with blood from an oxygenator-pump circuit. When the lungs were ventilated with 100% O2 and the bronchial O2 tension (PbrO2) was approximately 600 Torr, the mean of the pulmonary vascular resistances (PVR) measured at the beginning (3.32 +/- 0.29 units) and end (3.17 +/- 0.13 units) of the experiment was 3.24 +/- 0.20 units. When the PbrO2 was changed to 58 +/- 1 Torr, the PVR (2.99 +/- 0.14 units) did not change significantly. However, when the lungs were ventilated with air as PbrO2 was decreased to 91 +/- 4, 77 +/- 3, 56 +/- 2, and 42 +/- 1 Torr, the PVR increased to 3.67 +/- 0.18, 4.03 +/- 0.16, 4.79 +/- 0.19, and 4.71 +/- 0.35 units, respectively. However, when the PbrO2 was decreased further to 26 +/- 1 and 13 +/- 1 Torr, the PVR decreased to 3.77 +/- 0.28 and 3.91 +/- 0.30 units, respectively. In contrast, the bronchial vascular resistance decreased monotonically as PbrO2 decreased. The bronchial circulation supplies vasa vasorum to the walls of all but the smallest pulmonary arteries, and it is therefore suggested that the PO2 of the bronchial circulation is responsible for the bimodal response of the pulmonary vasculature, with stimulation of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction at moderate hypoxemia and of hypoxic pulmonary vasodilation at profound hypoxemia. The physiological and pathophysiological significance of the influence of systemic PO2 on pulmonary vascular tone is discussed.\r"

Four groups of experiments were conducted: 1) 5 g/dl albumin in the air spaces and perfusate, 2) 15 g/dl albumin in the air space and 5 g/dl albumin in the perfusate, 3) 5 g/dl albumin in the air space and 15 g/dl albumin in the perfusate, and 4) a mixture of 5 g/dl albumin and 7 g/dl Dextran 70 in the air spaces and 5 g/dl albumin in the perfusate. Fluid reabsorption was determined by following the concentration of albumin labeled with Evans blue (T-1824) in the air space and perfusate compartments. Because leakage of protein between the air space and perfusate compartments is very slow, increases in T-1824 concentrations in the air spaces indicated loss of fluid from this compartment, whereas decreases in these concentrations in the perfusate compartment provided evidence of fluid transport into the vasculature. Approximately 30% of the air space fluid was reabsorbed in a 2-h period, and virtually all of this fluid reached the perfusate compartment. Despite oncotic differences that ranged from -65 to 65 Torr, variations in air space or perfusate albumin concentrations did not have a significant effect on this process. A 30% decrease in fluid reabsorption was observed when dextran was in the air space solution, but this decrease did not appear to be due to the oncotic properties of this solution because albumin did not have a measurable effect on reabsorption.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Seven lambs at 130 days gestational age had a bronchial balloon placed at birth before the first breath to obstruct the left lower lobe. Surfactant and 131I-albumin were instilled into the left lower lobe while surfactant and 125I-albumin were instilled into the remaining lung, and 70,000 molecular weight [3H]dextran was given into the vascular space at birth. Twenty-five percent of the lung by weight was not ventilated, and 24% of the total leak of dextran from the vascular space was recovered in the unventilated lungs at 3 h. An epithelial leak of protein from the two lung regions was documented by the loss of 11.4 and 18.4% of the labeled albumins in the nonventilated and ventilated lung regions, the appearance of 4.9 and 7.5% of the airway-instilled albumin in the vascular space from the nonventilated and ventilated lung regions, and the recovery of the labeled albumins in the carcasses of the lambs. The bidirectional flux of macromolecules was larger in the ventilated than in the nonventilated lung regions, indicating that ventilation can increase the leak of protein in the preterm lung. The lung areas that were never exposed to ventilation or oxygen also demonstrated a large bidirectional flux of macromolecules, a finding not present in the fetus, fullterm newborn, or adult. These findings indicate that ventilation is not solely responsible for the increased protein leak found in preterm lungs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Blood samples drawn during isotopic steady state were analyzed for 13C enrichment of leucine and alpha-ketoisocaproic acid, and expired gas samples were analyzed for 13CO2. Resting leucine flux was higher in the FS, and there was a slight increase in leucine oxidation. During exercise, leucine flux did not differ between PAS and FS but leucine oxidation rose markedly. In the FS, leucine oxidation was 25 +/- 7 (SD) mumol.kg-1.h-1 at rest and rose to 75 +/- 21 mumol.kg-1.h-1 during exercise; in the PAS, oxidation was 20 +/- 5 mumol.kg-1.h-1 at rest and 52 +/- 17 mumol.kg-1.h-1 during exercise.

To test the hypothesis that actively altered end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) affects upper airway resistance in the supine position and to explore the mechanisms of any EELV-induced resistance changes, we studied five normal males during wakefulness. Supraglottic upper airway resistance (Ruaw) was calculated at an inspiratory flow of 0.1 l/s. The genioglossal electromyogram was obtained with indwelling wire electrodes and processed as moving time average. End-tidal CO2 was monitored by infrared analyzer. Observations were made during four 20-breath voluntary maneuvers: two at high and two at low EELV in each subject. Each maneuver was preceded by a control period at functional residual capacity. At high lung volume the EELV was increased by 2.23 +/- 0.54 (SD) liters; Ruaw decreased to 67.8 +/- 35.1% of control, while tonic and phasic genioglossal activities declined to 79.0 +/- 23.1 and 72.4 +/- 29.8%, respectively.

The findings were not explained by CO2 perturbations or respiratory pattern.

  ".W": "To characterize the effects of glucose on the pulmonary vascular response to anoxia and hypoxia, isolated ferret lungs were ventilated with 28% O2 and 5% CO2 and perfused at constant flow (100 ml.kg-1.min-1). Perfusate glucose concentrations were allowed to fall spontaneously to less than 1 mM (low glucose) or were controlled at 5-6 mM (normal glucose) or 12-17 mM (high glucose). At 60, 120, and 180 min of perfusion, the inspired O2 tension (PIO2) was reduced to 0, 10, or 30 Torr for 30 min, and vasomotor responses were quantified by continuous measurement of pulmonary arterial pressure. At PIO2 of 0 Torr, the response consisted of an early phase of transient intense vasoconstriction and a late phase of sustained slight vasoconstriction. High glucose markedly potentiated the magnitude of late-phase vasoconstriction with each successive anoxic exposure. This effect was not reproduced in normal glucose lungs and was not caused by a change in perfusate osmolarity, an action on blood cells, or an altered ability of pulmonary vascular smooth muscle to contract. At PIO2 of 10 Torr, high glucose not only potentiated late-phase vasoconstriction but also slowed the onset of early-phase vasoconstriction. At PIO2 of 30 Torr, high glucose had no effect on vasomotor responses, which were characterized by a slowly developing sustained vasoconstriction. Our results suggest that the vascular response of isolated ferret lungs to severe hypoxia consisted of separate early and late phases of vasoconstriction. This biphasic response may have resulted from two distinct vasoconstrictor mechanisms or from modulation of a single vasoconstrictor mechanism by a secondary vasodilator influence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We studied the possibility that a tidal reverse pulmonary venous flow is driven by the alternating distension and compression of alveolar and extra-alveolar vessels with the lung volume changes of breathing and also that a pulsatile reverse flow is caused by left atrial pressure transients. We infused SF6, a relatively insoluble inert gas, into the left atrium of anesthetized goats in which we had interrupted the left pulmonary artery and the bronchial circulation. SF6 was measured in the left lung exhalate as a reflection of the reverse pulmonary venous flow. No SF6 was exhaled when the pulmonary veins were occluded. SF6 was exhaled in increasing amounts as left atrial pressure, tidal volume, and ventilatory rates rose during mechanical ventilation. SF6 was not excreted when we increased left atrial pressure transients by causing mitral insufficiency in the absence of lung volume changes (continuous flow ventilation). Markers injected into the left atrial blood reached the alveolar capillaries. We conclude that reverse pulmonary venous flow is driven by tidal ventilation but not by left atrial pressure transients. It reaches the alveoli and could nourish the alveolar tissues when there is no inflow of arterial blood.\r"

  ".W": "Mechanisms of blood flow during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) were studied in a canine model with implanted mitral and aortic flow probes and by use of cineangiography. Intrathoracic pressure (ITP) fluctuations were induced by a circumferential pneumatic vest, with and without simultaneous ventilation, and by use of positive-pressure ventilation alone. Vascular volume and compression rate were altered with each CPR mode. Antegrade mitral flow was interpreted as left ventricular (LV) inflow, and antegrade aortic flow was interpreted as LV outflow. The pneumatic vest was expected to elevate ITP uniformly and thus produce simultaneous LV inflow and LV outflow throughout compression. This pattern, the passive conduit of \"thoracic pump\" physiology, was unequivocally demonstrated only during ITP elevation with positive-pressure ventilation alone at slow rates. During vest CPR, LV outflow started promptly with the onset of compression, whereas LV inflow was delayed. At compression rates of 50 times/min and normal vascular filling pressures, the delay was sufficiently long that all LV filling occurred with release of compression. This is the pattern that would be expected with direct LV compression or \"cardiac pump\" physiology. During the early part of the compression phase, catheter tip transducer LV and left atrial pressure measurements demonstrated gradients necessitating mitral valve closure, while cineangiography showed dye droplets moving from the large pulmonary veins retrograde to the small pulmonary veins. When the compression rate was reduced and/or when intravascular pressures were raised with volume infusion, LV inflow was observed at some point during the compressive phase. Thus, under these conditions, features of both thoracic pump and cardiac pump physiology occurred within the same compression. Our findings are not explained by the conventional conceptions of either thoracic pump or cardiac compression CPR mechanisms alone.\r"

Five healthy males completed 2 h of treadmill exercise consisting of running at 4-6 km/h for 30-45 min followed by 75-90 min of walking up a 2-10% grade. This exercise bout was performed by two subjects in hot (46 degrees C, 15% relative humidity) and by five subjects in cooler (30 degrees C, 40% relative humidity) environmental conditions. Exercise resulting in rectal temperature (Tre) less than 40 degrees C did not alter the amount of 70K stress protein synthesized by leukocytes incubated at 41 degrees C. In contrast, exercise resulting in Tre greater than 40 degrees C reduced the amount of 70K stress protein synthesized by leukocytes incubated at 41 degrees C. A protein immunoblot, probed with an antibody specific for the inducible 72K stress protein, showed that the reduction of 35S-labeled 70K stress protein in these postexercise leukocyte samples occurred without marked elevations of this protein. In vitro incubation of human leukocytes at 40 degrees C for 15-120 min reduced, in a time-dependent manner, the amount of 70K stress protein synthesized during a subsequent 41 degrees C heat stress. This reduction of 70K stress protein synthesis in 41 degrees C-treated leukocytes was abolished when cycloheximide was present during the 40 degrees C preincubation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Addition of external VD was associated with a significant increase in tidal volume (VT) and decrease in respiratory frequency (f) at moderate and high levels of ventilation (VI); at a VI of 120 l/min, VT and f with added VD were 3.31 +/- 0.33 liters and 36.7 +/- 6.7 breaths/min, respectively, compared with 2.90 +/- 0.29 liters and 41.8 +/- 7.3 breaths/min without added VD. Because breathing pattern does not change with CO2 inhalation during heavy exercise (Gallagher et al. J. Appl. Physiol. 63: 238-244, 1987), the breathing pattern response to added VD is probably a consequence of alteration in the PCO2 time profile, possibly sensed by the carotid body and/or airway-pulmonary chemoreceptors. The increase in VT during heavy exercise with VD loading indicates that the tachypneic breathing pattern of heavy exercise is not due to mechanical limitation of maximum ventilatory capacity at high levels of VT.\r"

We impaled the subpleural alveolar epithelium with microelectrodes and measured the transepithelial potential difference (PD) of the liquid-filled vascular-perfused left lobe of the rat lung. When the air space was filled entirely with Krebs-Ringer-bicarbonate, the PD was 4.7 mV (lumen negative). The PD was not affected significantly by agents that modify either Na+ or Cl- transport, but replacement of luminal Cl- with gluconate resulted in a fourfold hyperpolarization, a response also noted for large airways. When the airways were blocked by an immiscible nonconducting fluorocarbon, basal PD was not different from unblocked lobes (4.0 mV) but was inhibited 73% by luminal amiloride. Cl(-)-free Krebs-Ringer-bicarbonate blocked in the alveoli with fluorocarbon did not induce hyperpolarization. This result suggests that 1) Cl- permselectivity of the alveolar epithelium is less than that of large airway epithelium and 2) airway PD dominates the voltage across the liquid-filled lung, even when measurements are made from alveoli. When airways are blocked by fluorocarbon, the PD across the alveolar epithelium is largely dependent on Na+ flow through a path with amiloride-sensitive channels.\r"

The load was adjusted to increase spontaneously generated transdiaphragmatic pressure five to six times baseline. Six 1-mo-old piglets acted as controls and were identically instrumented but were not subjected to IRL. Measurements of ventilation, blood gases and pH, diaphragmatic electromyogram, force-frequency curve, blood flow, and end-expiratory lung volume were obtained hourly. Diaphragmatic muscle samples were obtained after 6 h for determination of ATP, phosphocreatine, lactate, and glycogen levels. No changes occurred in the control animals. IRL resulted in a significant decrease in ventilation, an increase in diaphragmatic EMG, onset of abdominal expiratory muscle activity, and a fall in end-expiratory lung volume by 1 h. The force-frequency curve adjusted for lung volume change fell by 20% at all frequencies of stimulation at 1 h and by 40% at 6 h. Blood flow to the costal and crural diaphragm increased by 51 and 141%, respectively. No differences were noted in ATP, phosphocreatine, lactate, or glycogen between control and IRL animals. It is concluded that submaximal spontaneous contractions of the piglet diaphragm over a 6-h period cause a substantial decrease in its maximal force-generating capacity that is not related to substrate depletion.\r"

Blood flow in the ascending aorta, common carotid, renal, superior mesenteric, and femoral arteries was measured by electromagnetic and Doppler flow probes. Injection of 1 mg capsaicin into the left phrenic artery produced congruent to 15% increase in mean arterial pressure and congruent to 7% increase in heart rate with no change in aortic flow. Phrenic arterial flow decreased by 64%, renal arterial flow by 16%, and superior mesenteric arterial flow by 10%, whereas carotid flow increased by 13% and flow to the right gastrocnemius muscle did not change. Mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and blood flow distribution (with the exception of the decline in phrenic blood flow) returned to baseline within 60 s of the injection. Injection of 1.5 mg capsaicin into the right isolated and innervated gastrocnemius produced congruent to 35% increase in mean arterial pressure, 17% rise in heart rate, and no change in aortic blood flow. Phrenic and carotid arterial flow rose by 240 and 41%, respectively, whereas renal and superior mesenteric flow declined by 50 and 20%, respectively. In conclusion, thin-fiber phrenic afferents have an excitatory effect on arterial pressure and heart rate. They redistribute blood flow away from the renal and intestinal vascular beds and toward the carotid vascular bed. On the other hand, the cardiovascular reflex from thin-fiber phrenic afferents seems less potent than that from limb muscle afferents.\r"

The mean duration of 36, 55, 73, and 100% MLP was 3.31, 0.781, 0.270, and 0.1 min, respectively. All intensities were greater than those eliciting peak O2 uptake for the individual subjects.

Muscle sounds were detected with an omni-directional electret microphone encased in closed-cell foam and attached to the skin over the muscle. Acoustic amplitudes from the middle and end of the sustained contractions were compared with the amplitudes from the beginning of contractions to determine whether acoustic amplitudes varied in magnitude as force remained constant. Physiological tremor was eliminated from the acoustic signal by use of a Fourier truncation at 14 Hz. The amplitudes of the acoustic signal at a contraction intensity of 75% MVC remained constant, reflecting force production over time. At 50% MVC, the root-mean-square amplitude decreased from the beginning to the end of the contraction (P less than 0.05). Acoustic amplitudes increased over time at 15 and 25% MVC and were significantly higher at the end of the contractions than at the beginning (P less than 0.05). Alterations in the acoustic amplitude, which reflect changes in the lateral vibrations of the muscle, may be indicative of the different recruitment strategies used to maintain force during sustained isometric contractions.\r"

Subjects were seated at functional residual capacity, and quasi-sinusoidal forcing at the mouth (0.4 Hz, 500 ml) was imposed during the maneuver in the absence of active breathing. Magnitude of total chest wall impedance (magnitude of Zw) increased with effort during all maneuvers; changes in phase were small. Maneuvers involving primarily muscles of the neck and rib cage--holding a 10-kg weight, 10 kg of isometric tension between the arms, and isometric neck flexion--roughly doubled the magnitude of rib cage impedance (magnitude of Zrc) and, to a lesser degree, increased magnitude of diaphragm-abdomen impedance (magnitude of Zd-a). Unilateral and bilateral leg lifts, in addition to increasing magnitude of Zd-a, increased magnitude of Zrc. Passive 90 degrees rotation of the torso caused approximately 25% increases in magnitude of Zrc and magnitude of Zd-a; if the rotation was actively maintained by the trunk muscles, both regional impedances increased over 100%. Increases in magnitude of regional impedance were correlated to increases in regional electromyographic activity; changes in phase were small. Passive restriction of rib cage displacement by strapping increased magnitude of Zrc and magnitude of Zw but not magnitude of Zd-a, whereas abdominal strapping increased magnitude of Zd-a but did not affect magnitude of Zrc or magnitude of Zw.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thus, using standard microsphere techniques, we compared blood flow to the parietal pleura, including the subpleural interstitium, with blood flow to the adjacent internal intercostal muscle, as well as with flows to other serous tissues, including mediastinal pleura, pericardium, and parietal peritoneum, in anesthetized dogs that were either breathing spontaneously (n = 9) or ventilated to control arterial PCO2 (n = 5). Blood flow (ml.min-1.g-1) was measured after 20 min of equilibration in four successive body positions: right lateral decubitus, supine, left lateral decubitus, and prone. Overall, flow to parietal pleura was not different in spontaneous [1.07 +/- 0.14 (SE)] and mechanically ventilated animals (0.74 +/- 0.11). Flow to the internal intercostal muscle was significantly less than pleural blood flow, averaging 0.24 +/- 0.03 and 0.16 +/- 0.03 in the same groups, although again there was no effect of ventilation mode. Blood flow to other serous tissues in the thoracic cavity, specifically the mediastinal pleura (0.67 +/- 0.14) and pericardium (0.88 +/- 0.22), was similar to parietal pleural flow, whereas that to the parietal peritoneum was an order of magnitude lower (0.09 +/- 0.02, P less than 0.05). Changing body position had no effect on blood flow to any of the sampled tissues. Blood flow to the dorsal aspect of the chest wall muscle in spontaneously breathing animals tended to be greater than that to lateral or ventral portions of the chest wall.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There were no significant differences, respectively, between the aspirin and no-aspirin groups for units of blood transfused (1.32 +/- vs 1.21 +/- 0.20, p = 0.843) and patients not receiving transfusions during the entire hospitalization (44% vs 50%). Patients taking 85-325 mgm of aspirin with a normal bleeding time undergoing elective CABG did not have increased RBC loss or increased transfusion requirements.

In 1986 the in situ technique was introduced at our clinic as the preferred method for femoropopliteal bypass with the lower anastomosis below the knee or femorodistal bypass. Forty patients operated with the in situ technique were compared with an equal number of patients operated with the reversed technique 1983-1985. The two groups were comparable regarding concomitant cardiovascular and pulmonary disease, preoperative ankle-brachial index and level of distal anastomosis. Patency after 6 months was significantly higher (84%) for the in situ grafts compared to reversed veins (49%). The difference was mainly caused by a significantly higher patency for in situ grafts anastomosed to infrapopliteal arteries. Despite better patency rates in the in situ group limb salvage at 6 months was the same in both groups. Operating time was also similar in both groups. It is concluded that the in situ technique is superior to the reversed technique, at least in infrapopliteal reconstructions. The superior patency rate and the technical advantages without apparent disadvantages are the basis for the recommendation to use the in situ technique for femoropopliteal and femorodistal bypass.\r"

Twenty-five of 109 patients (23%) developed significant postoperative ventricular dysrhythmias that required counter-shock or drug intervention. Seven of eight instances of sustained ventricular tachycardia, the most serious dysrhythmia, occurred within 36 hours of operation. There was no postoperative mortality related to these dysrhythmias. Serious postoperative complications, such as stroke, hemorrhage, or myocardial infarction, were decreased in patients with ventricular dysrhythmias versus those without (8% versus 16%, p = 0.053 for the Fisher's exact test statistic). Univariate statistical analysis was performed using 15 patient variables and revealed that advanced age (p = 0.008 for the unpaired t test), failure to use an internal mammary artery conduit (p = 0.03 for the two-tailed Fisher's exact test), and development of postoperative atrial dysrhythmias (p = 0.02 for the two-tailed Fisher's exact test) were significantly more common in patients with postoperative ventricular dysrhythmias.

However, limb salvage was significantly less in the secondary group (52% vs 68% at 2 years, p less than 0.05). This decrease was primarily due to poorer limb salvage using composite grafts (prosthetic/vein) compared to vein grafts in patients who underwent secondary femoral-distal bypasses (37% vs 76% at 2 years, p less than 0.05). Postoperative wound infections and mortality were similar in both groups.

Isolated rat heart was flushed with and stored in one of the storage solutions at 0 degrees C for 7 hours. The recovery of function was assessed using the working heart perfusion. Cardiac output returned to 34 +/- 6, 59 +/- 3 76 +/- 5, and 75 +/- 8% (mean +/- SE) of the control level in hearts stored in Euro-Collins, St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic, a modified University of Wisconsin (MUW) solutions, and a solution developed by us (CP-8), respectively. Therefore, MUW and CP-8 were superior to the other two solutions. During post-storage reperfusion, the coronary flow correlated directly with the aortic flow (r = 0.98), suggesting that preservation of coronary perfusion may be crucial to the recovery of function. There was also a good correlation between myocardial ATP levels and the cardiac output (r = 0.81). Thus, measurements towards the enhancement of ATP preservation and regeneration may be beneficial to the stored cardiac explant.\r"

The plasma levels of thromboxane B2 and 6 keto PGF1 alpha (metabolites of thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin) in systemic artery and coronary sinus blood were measured during early reperfusion. A significantly larger arterio-venous difference in 6 keto PGF1 alpha concentration was found immediately after aortic clamp release in the diltiazem group (124 +/- 77 vs 12 +/- 47 pg/ml, p less than 0.05). The plasma thromboxane B2/6 keto PGF1 alpha ratio in coronary sinus blood was lower in the diltiazem group immediately after aortic clamp release (0.47 +/- 0.16 vs 0.74 +/- 0.18, p less than 0.05). There was no significant difference in arterio-venous TxB2 concentration between the two groups. In terms of myocardial protective effect evaluated by CPK-MB release, there was no significant difference between the two groups. The results indicated that diltiazem used as an adjunct to cardioplegia enhanced the production of endogenous PGI2 during early reperfusion, although its beneficial effect on myocardial protection was not shown in terms of enzyme leakage.\r"

Thromboxane B2 (TXB2, a stable metabolite of thromboxane A2) and beta-thromboglobulin levels in the control group increased significantly during CPB compared with preoperative values. These increases were significantly suppressed in the aprotinin group. 6-Keto-PGF1 alpha (stable metabolite of prostacyclin) increased significantly during CPB in both groups, and there was no significant difference between the two groups. In the aprotinin group, the TXB2/6-Keto-PGF1 alpha ratio decreased significantly during CPB compared with the preoperative value, whereas no significant decrease was observed in the control group. Platelet counts decreased significantly during and after CPB in both groups. Platelet aggregability decreased significantly during CPB in the control group, whereas no significant decrease was found in the aprotinin group. In conclusion, aprotinin treatment improved prostaglandin metabolism and preserved platelet function during open heart surgery.\r"

All patients had had gastroduodenal ulcers. Preoperative gastroscopy demonstrated active ulcers (No. = 4) and a healed pyloric ulcer with pyloric stenosis (No. = 1). Despite the presence of ulcers, a non-biologic prosthesis was preferred in each patient because of their young age (No. = 3), chronic atrial fibrillation requiring anticoagulant therapy (No. = 1), and refusal of the eventuality of subsequent reoperation (No. = 1). In each patient, a truncal vagotomy with pyloroplasty was performed simultaneously with the valvular procedures by the same incision. The postoperative courses were uneventful. With a mean follow-up of 15 +/- 3 months, no gastrointestinal bleeding was observed during anticoagulant therapy. With anticoagulant drugs, bleeding may occur with a frequency of 4% per patient treatment-year, half of which are gastrointestinal in origin. Nevertheless, in selected patients with gastroduodenal ulcers, performing a vagotomy-pyloroplasty simultaneously with valvular replacement allows implantation of a non-biologic prosthesis, with greater durability than bioprosthesis.\r"

Twenty mongrel dogs were divided into 5 groups of 3 recipients and 1 donor each. Liver and kidney mobilization was performed when the core temperature of the liver reached 27 degrees C, a result of ice slush in the abdominal cavity. As the core temperature of the liver reached 20-22 degrees C, the aorta and inferior vena cava were clamped just above the diaphragm. After excision of the liver and kidneys, another team harvested the heart as it continued to beat. The heart and liver were transplanted orthotopically after simple preservation for 12 and 6 hours, respectively. The kidney was transplanted heterotopically after simple 12-hour preservation. The maximum survival time was 7 hours for heart transplantation and 16 days for liver transplantation. Kidney homogenate ATP levels decreased to 19% of baseline after preservation and were restored to 68% one hour after reperfusion. Our method is simple and safe for harvesting the heart, liver, an kidneys for transplantation and may offer a definite possibility for clinical application.\r"

The results of all patients were then categorized by two different definitions of severity of stenosis. Category A classified 1-29% stenosis as mild, 30-69% stenosis as moderate, and 70-99% diameter reduction as severe stenosis. Category B defined mild stenosis as 1-19% lumen diameter reduction, moderate as 20-49% stenosis, and severe as 50-99% stenosis. The findings by each classification were compared in 60 patients with hemispheric symptoms and in 59 patients with nonspecific symptoms. CAN was our \"gold standard\", and exhibited greater sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and predictive values than DS. Carotid arteries with 70% stenosis were identified by DS with greater specificity, accuracy, and predictive values than were arteries with 50% stenoses. Only the sensitivity was comparable in categorizations A and B (80% and 83%). All parameters of measurement were superior in patients with hemispheric symptoms. DS alone cannot substitute for CAN in selecting patients for carotid endarterectomy because its error rate exceeded acceptable rates of complications for carotid artery surgery. The false positive rate of DS was 4%. DS failed to diagnose 7 of 19 carotid artery occlusions, 9 of 11 ulcerated plaques, 7 of 119 instances of aortic arch disease, and 13 cases of severe intracranial artery stenosis.\r"

There were 71 (61.7%) males and 44 (38.3%) females with a median age of 46 years (range 16-67). Renal revascularization was unilateral in 96 (83.4%) cases and bilateral in 19 (16.6%). Dacron knitted bypass grafts, were used in 51 and PTFE in 33 instances. Saphenous vein grafts were used in 11 patients. In 15 cases treatment was by local endarterectomy with concomitant angioplasty (12 unilateral and 3 bilateral). Simultaneous aortorenal reconstruction was undertaken in 38 (33%) patients. There were no deaths in the group with isolated renal artery reconstruction. In the group of aortorenal reconstructions, two deaths were encountered (5.7%). Postoperatively, blood pressure was either normal or improved in 83 (72%) patients at a mean follow-up period of 48.3 months (range 1-195 months). The best results were obtained in younger individuals with segmental renal artery lesions. Linear progression analysis, showed age to be a major determinant in the postoperative response to hypertension. There was a greater degree of long term success in patients with fibromuscular dysplasia, as compared to individuals with atherosclerosis. Crude survival probabilities, were 78% and 61% at 5 and 10 years respectively. Late deaths encountered in the present series, were mostly attributable to myocardial infarction (7.8%). In this series, the best results were obtained in individuals younger than 50 years of age, with segmental renal artery lesions.\r"

Good blood pressure control was achieved in all three groups but those who underwent PTA had a small but significant fall in their requirement for antihypertensive medications (p less than 0.05). However, no patient was \"cured\" of hypertension and blood pressure was able to be controlled in both Group II and Group III subjects without an increase in their number of antihypertensives. Serum creatinine did not improve significantly during follow-up in those who underwent PTA and was not different from that of Group II subjects at follow-up. Although unselected renal artery PTA for RAS may make blood pressure control easier it does not delay or prevent further deterioration in renal function and should not be used for this purpose.\r"

  ".W": "Angiography is required for a detailed anatomical investigation before reconstructive surgery or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty can be performed. Although angiography is a safe procedure, it is associated with renal dysfunction, usually transient, in about 10% of the cases. This study concentrates on the evaluation of renal dysfunction induced by \"conventional\" (i.e. film-screen) Seldinger angiography and a consecutive series of 396 angiographic procedures have been evaluated. Induced Renal Dysfunction was defined as an increase of more than 10% in the serum creatinine after angiography. To identify \"risk factors\" for Induced Renal Dysfunction we have studied whether clinical and angiographical variables were associated with the occurrence of Induced Renal Dysfunction. These variables included: age, hypertension, the use of antihypertensive drugs, diabetes mellitus, technique of angiography, site of contrast injection and type and quantity of contrast medium. Induced Renal Dysfunction was found in 21 cases (5.7%) and appeared to be associated with age above 70, hypertension, administration of more than 150 ml contrast medium and the presence of renal disease prior to angiography. More than 95% of the 21 patients with dysfunction had two or more of these \"risk factors\". The presence of diabetes was not clearly associated with Induced Renal Dysfunction and haemodialyses was not required in any of the patients. The incidence of Induced Renal Dysfunction after angiography was 5.7% which is low but not negligible. However, renal dysfunction was always transient and never severe. Furthermore, the identification of \"risk factors\" allows the prompt identification of patients at risk before angiography, which may help to reduce the incidence of Induced Renal Dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate duplex imaging as a means of assessing perforating veins in patients with longstanding venous stasis ulceration. Thirty patients with nonhealing venous stasis ulcers and twenty normal volunteers serving as controls were evaluated with a standard 8-MHz imaging probe and integrated pulsed Doppler. The internal diameter of perforating veins was measured and perforators were grouped into one of four categories based on functional criteria: competent perforator with venous flow (C); incompetent perforator with venous flow (IC); competent perforator with arteriovenous flow (C-AVC); incompetent perforator with arteriovenous flow (IC-AVC). Sixteen of the patients with ulcers were subsequently studied by ascending venography and in 11 patients, intraoperative identification of perforating veins was made during the Rob procedure. In this subset of patients the vessel was categorized as competent or incompetent regardless of flow signal. There were significant differences in mean perforator diameter between ulcer patients and normal volunteers. Duplex imaging identified 93 perforators and venography a total of 70. In all 16 extremities, duplex imaging made the diagnosis of significant perforating vein incompetence, verified by venography. Intraoperative findings demonstrated an excellent correlation with duplex imaging. We believe duplex imaging to be a promising new modality for evaluation of the perforating veins of the lower extremity.\r"

The indicating symptoms for these procedures were (1) progressive chronic edema, (2) claudication while walking, or (3) trophic lesions. Doppler ultrasound and plethysmographic techniques were employed in the diagnosis while phlebography was considered the most useful and most essential technique. Iliac vein obstruction was the most common venous obstruction, followed by superficial femoral vein obstruction. Two patients were operated on for combined obstruction at both levels. Free veno-venous bypass was the most frequently used procedure. In two cases of cavo-iliac obstruction, an original technique of femoro-axillary veno-venous bypass yielded good results. Temporary arteriovenous fistulas to improve patency at sites distal to venous bypass were used in the most complex cases. Good results were obtained in 80% of the operated cases. Postoperative follow-up phlebograms were obtained in 30 of 43 operations.\r"

The recent availability of antibodies to 15-LO now allows us to determine which specific cells contain the enzyme, to characterize its subcellular localization, and to determine its expression at the translational level. A polyclonal antibody to recombinant human reticulocyte 15-LO was used with a standard immunofluorescent technique. In rabbit red blood cells, fluorescence appeared during the course of anemia. Early reticulocytes did not fluoresce, but more mature reticulocytes showed increased fluorescent intensity. Late reticulocytes contained little fluorescence. Among human leukocytes, only eosinophils fluoresced. In human trachea, 15-LO immunofluorescence was localized to epithelial cells, and both basal and ciliated cells fluoresced. In all cells studied, fluorescence was localized to the cytoplasm and was variable in degree among cells in each preparation. We conclude that the 15-LO of airway cells and eosinophils is immunologically related to the reticulocyte 15-LO. Furthermore, the variable fluorescence among cells (e.g., in epithelium) and during development (e.g., reticulocytes) suggests a role of 15-LO in cell growth and development.\r"

  ".W": "Oxidatively modified low density lipoprotein (LDL) exhibits several potentially atherogenic properties, and inhibition of LDL oxidation in rabbits decreases the rate of the development of atherosclerotic lesions. In vitro studies have suggested that cellular lipoxygenases may be involved in LDL oxidation, and we have shown previously that 15-lipoxygenase and oxidized LDL are present in rabbit atherosclerotic lesions. We now report that epitopes of oxidized LDL are also found in macrophage-rich areas of human fatty streaks as well as in more advanced human atherosclerotic lesions. Using in situ hybridization and immunostaining techniques, we also report that 15-lipoxygenase mRNA and protein colocalize to the same macrophage-rich areas. Moreover, these same lesions express abundant mRNA for the acetyl LDL receptor but no detectable mRNA for the LDL receptor. We suggest that atherogenesis in human arteries may be linked to macrophage-induced oxidative modification of LDL mediated by 15-lipoxygenase, leading to subsequent enhanced macrophage uptake, partly by way of the acetyl LDL receptor.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the mechanisms which regulate the functions of the intercalated cells (ICs) in the cortical collecting duct (CCD), the effect of isoproterenol on intracellular pH (pHi) of ICs was studied with the in vitro microperfused rabbit CCD, using the single cell pHi determination technique with fluorescent dye, 2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5(and-6)carboxyfluorescein. The pHi of beta-IC was significantly decreased with the addition of basolateral 10(-6) M isoproterenol (7.21 +/- 0.04 to 7.05 +/- 0.04), whereas alpha-IC did not show any change. This response of beta-IC to isoproterenol was dose-dependent and completely inhibited by the beta-blockers, atenolol or propranolol. The addition of forskolin or 8-Br-cAMP mimicked the effects of isoproterenol, suggesting that the activation of adenylate cyclase induced the decrease in pHi. The rate of pHi changes after the Cl- removal from the perfusate, which is considered to reflect the activity of luminal anion exchanger, was significantly higher with isoproterenol (0.032 +/- 0.009 pH unit/s) than that in the control (0.023 +/- 0.009 pH unit/s). The present studies provide direct evidence for the regulation of beta-IC function by beta-adrenergic receptor; and the luminal Cl-/HCO3- exchanger was considered to be stimulated by beta-agonist, directly.\r"

  ".W": "Endothelin (ET) is a vasoactive peptide produced by both endothelial epithelial cells with documented mitogenic action on mesangial cells. The present studies were designed to test the hypothesis that ET is also produced by human mesangial cells (HMC) and that other mitogens such as arginine vasopressin (AVP) and insulin stimulate cellular proliferation, in part, through modulation of endogenous production of this peptide. Studies were conducted on cultured normal HMC between the third and seventh passages. All mitogenesis experiments were carried out in 96-well plates and assessed by tritiated thymidine incorporation into DNA under various concentrations of AVP in the presence and absence of insulin, antiendothelin antisera (ETAS), a MAb against ET-1 (AbET), and a vasopressin-1 receptor antagonist. ET concentrations were measured daily from conditioned medium by a sensitive and specific RIA. ET was present in all concentrations of FCS as well as conditioned medium compared with medium alone. AVP (10(-6) M) in the presence of insulin increased ET production by quiescent HMC by 261% as well as cellular proliferation by 440% after 48 h incubation. In addition, cells cultured with ETAS or AbET demonstrated a blunted mitogenic response to AVP, a response not observed in cells cultured with ETAS where ET was added. Insulin significantly potentiated the mitogenic effects of AVP as well as media levels of ET, an effect significantly blunted by AbET. We conclude that ET is produced by HMC and its production is affected, in part, by both AVP and insulin. ET may thus serve to modulate the mitogenic effects of AVP on human mesangial cells.\r"

To understand the molecular basis of LPL deficiency, two siblings with drastically reduced postheparin plasma lipolytic activities were selected for analysis of their LPL gene. We used the polymerase chain reaction to examine the nine coding LPL exons in the two affected siblings and three relatives. DNA sequence analysis revealed a single nucleotide change compared with the normal LPL cDNA: a G----A substitution at nucleotide position 680. This transition caused a replacement of glutamic acid for glycine at amino acid residue 142 of the mature LPL protein. Amino acid sequence comparisons of the region surrounding glycine-142 indicated that it is highly conserved among lipases from different species, suggesting a crucial role of this domain for the LPL structure. Expression studies of the mutant LPL cDNA in COS-7 cells produced normal amounts of enzyme mass. However, the mutated LPL was not catalytically active, nor was it efficiently secreted from the cells. This established that the Gly----Glu substitution at amino acid 142 is sufficient to abolish enzymatic activity and to result in the chylomicronemia syndrome observed in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "Prolidase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder with highly variable symptoms, including mental retardation, skin lesions, and abnormalities of collagenous tissues. In Japanese female siblings with polypeptide negative prolidase deficiency, and with different degrees of severity of skin lesions, we noted an abnormal mRNA with skipping of 192 bp sequence corresponding to exon 14 in lymphoblastoid cells taken from these patients. Transfection and expression analyses using the mutant prolidase cDNA revealed that a mutant protein translated from the abnormal mRNA had an Mr of 49,000 and was enzymatically inactive. A 774-bp deletion, including exon 14 was noted in the prolidase gene. The deletion had termini within short, direct repeats ranging in size of 7 bp (CCACCCT). The \"slipped mispairing\" mechanism may predominate in the generation of the deletion at this locus. This mutation caused a 192-bp in-frame deletion of prolidase mRNA and was inherited from the consanguineous parents. The same mutation caused a different degree of clinical phenotype of prolidase deficiency in this family, therefore factor(s) not related to the PEPD gene product also contribute to development of the clinical symptoms. Identification of mutations in the PEPD gene from subjects with prolidase deficiency provides further insight into the physiological role and structure-function relationship of this biologically important enzyme.\r"

Mean +/- SEM weight (kg) was 67 +/- 2 (ln), 100 +/- 7 (ob), and 114 +/- 11 (NIDDM), P = NS between obese groups. NIDDM were also studied after 3 wk of intensive insulin therapy, GHb post therapy was 10.1 +/- 0.9, P less than 0.01 vs. pretherapy. Insulin (120 mu/m2 per min) was infused and the arterial blood glucose (G) sequentially maintained at approximately 4, 7, 12, and 21 mmol/liter utilizing the G clamp technique. Leg glucose uptake (LGU) was calculated as the product of the femoral arteriovenous glucose difference (FAVGd) and leg blood flow measured by thermodilution. Compared to ln, ob and NIDDM had significantly lower rates of whole body IMGU and LGU at all G levels. Compared to ob, the NIDDM exhibited approximately 50% and approximately 40% lower rates of whole body IMGU over the first two G levels (P less than 0.02) but did not differ at the highest G, P = NS. LGU was 83% lower in NIDDM vs. ob, P less than 0.05 at the first G level only. After insulin therapy NIDDM were indistinguishable from ob with respect to whole body IMGU or LGU at all G levels. A significant correlation was noted between the percent GHb and the EG50 (G at which 1/2 maximal FAVGd occurs) r = 0.73, P less than 0.05. Thus, (a) insulin resistance in NIDDM and obese subjects are characterized by similar decreases in capacity for skeletal muscle IMGU, but differs in that poorly controlled NIDDM display a decrease in affinity for skeletal muscle IMGU, and (b) this affinity defect is related to the degree of antecedent glycemic control and is reversible with insulin therapy, suggesting that it is an acquired defect.\r"

Amyloid fibrils were isolated from the kidney and heart of a patient with Finnish amyloidosis. After solubilization, the amyloid proteins were fractionated by gel filtration and purified by reverse-phase HPLC. Complete amino acid sequence analyses show that the two amyloid components obtained are fragments of gelsolin, an actin-modulating protein occurring in plasma and the cytoskeleton. The larger component represents residues 173-243 and the minor component residues 173-225, respectively, of mature gelsolin. When compared with the predicted primary structure of human gelsolin a single amino acid substitution is present in amyloid: at position 15 of the amyloid proteins an asparagine is found instead of an aspartic acid residue at the corresponding position (187) in gelsolin. Antibodies to a dodecapeptide of the amyloidogenic region of gelsolin specifically stain the tissue amyloid deposits in Finnish hereditary amyloidosis. The results show that the amyloid subunit protein in Finnish hereditary amyloidosis represents a new type of amyloid that is derived from an actin filament-binding region of a variant gelsolin molecule by limited proteolysis.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to investigate the mechanisms by which an infusion of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor I (rhIGF-I) increases GFR and renal plasma flow (RPF) in rats. Glomerular micropuncture studies were carried out in 14 nonstarved Munich Wistar rats and in 12 rats deprived of food for 60-72 h. Animals were given an intravenous injection and infusion of either rhIGF-I or vehicle. In both nonstarved and starved animals, the IGF-I injection and infusion increased the serum IGF-I levels, left kidney GFR, single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR), single nephron blood flow rate (SNBF), and single nephron plasma flow rate (SNPF). The increase in SNPF and SNGFR was in part due to a fall in efferent arteriolar resistance (RE); there was a tendency, not significant, for afferent arteriolar resistance (RA) to fall in comparison to controls. The increase in SNGFR was partly caused by a rise in SNPF but was primarily due to an increase in glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient (LpA) to twice the control values. The increase in LpA resulted in an increase in SNGFR because the rats operated at ultrafiltration pressure disequilibrium. Control starved as compared with nonstarved rats had lower SNGFR, SNBF, and SNPF. This reduction was due to a tendency, not significant, for both RA and RE to be higher. Decreased SNGFR in food-deprived rats resulted from a reduced SNPF, a lower glomerular transcapillary hydrostatic pressure difference (delta P), and possibly a somewhat reduced LpA. These data indicate that IGF-I increases SNGFR, SNPF, and SNBF primarily by increasing LpA and also by decreasing RE without affecting delta P. Short-term starvation lowers SNGFR, SNPF, and SNBF primarily by decreasing delta P and possibly by lowering LpA and increasing RA and RE. IGF-I reverses some of the glomerular hemodynamic effects of short-term food deprivation.\r"

The branched chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) activity in the patient was 4.2-4.5% of the control level. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the E2 subunit of BCKDH (Mr 52,000) was absent and another protein band with an Mr of 49,000 was present. We amplified the cDNA of the E2 subunit obtained from the patient's cell using the polymerase chain reaction method, then sequenced the amplified cDNA, in which a 78-bp deletion was identified. The consanguineous parents and a sister had two species of mRNA; the one corresponding to the normal E2 subunit and the other with a 78-bp deletion, whereas findings in a brother were normal. The molecular size of the translation products as deduced from the abnormal mRNA sequence was compatible with an abnormal protein band (Mr 49,000) detected in the patient's cells by immunoblot analysis. Analysis of genomic DNA of BCKDH-E2 subunit revealed that the 78-bp deletion in the mRNA was caused by an exon skipping due to a single base deletion in the 5'-splice donor site. As a result of the mutation, part of the inner E2 core domain was omitted. The specified region of the inner E2 core domain was highly homologous to the region of the E2 subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. These observations imply the biological importance of the region in the inner E2 core domain of BCKDH to maintain normal function of the activity.\r"

  ".W": "Muscle is an important target tissue for insulin-like growth factor (IGF) action. The presence of specific, high affinity IGF receptors, as well as the expression of IGF peptides and binding proteins by muscle suggest that a significant component of IGF action in this tissue is mediated through autocrine and/or paracrine mechanisms. To explore autocrine/paracrine action of IGFs in muscle, we studied the regulation of the IGF-I receptor and the expression of IGF peptides during differentiation of the mouse BC3H-1 muscle cell line. Differentiation from myoblasts to myocytes was associated with a 60% decrease in IGF-I receptor sites determined by Scatchard analysis. Analysis of mRNA abundance and protein labeling studies indicated that the decrease in IGF-I receptor sites was associated with similar reductions in IGF-I receptor gene expression and receptor biosynthesis. IGF-II peptide gene expression was detected in myoblasts and increased 15-fold with differentiation; the increase in IGF-II gene expression preceded the decrease in IGF-I receptor gene expression. In contrast, IGF-I peptide gene expression was low in myoblasts and decreased slightly with differentiation. To explore the potential role of endogenous IGF-II in the differentiation-associated decrease in IGF-I receptor expression, we investigated the effects of IGF-II treatment in myoblasts. The addition of IGF-II to undifferentiated myoblasts resulted in downregulation of the IGF-I receptor which was associated with decreased IGF-I receptor biosynthesis and decreased IGF-I receptor mRNA abundance. These studies suggest, therefore, that IGF-I receptor expression during muscle cell differentiation may be regulated, at least in part, through autocrine production of IGF-II.\r"

  ".W": "Many variants of von Willebrand disease (vWD) with qualitatively abnormal von Willebrand factor (vWF) are recognized. In vWD type IIB, the abnormal protein displays enhanced affinity for a platelet vWF receptor, the glycoprotein Ib-IX complex. 14 patients from 7 unrelated families with vWD type IIB were studied to determine the molecular basis for this phenotype. Specific oligonucleotide primers were used to amplify portions of vWF exon 28 encoding a domain that interacts with the platelet glycoprotein Ib-IX complex. Candidate missense mutations were identified for all 14 patients by DNA sequencing, allele specific oligonucleotide hybridization, and restriction endonuclease digestion. These sequence changes occur in an 11 amino acid segment within a single disulfide loop bounded by Cys(509) and Cys(695). All of these sequence changes are C----T transitions within CG dinucleotides. Six patients from two unrelated families were heterozygous for the encoded sequence Arg(543)----Trp. Seven patients from four unrelated families were heterozygous for the encoded sequence Arg(545)----Cys; this sequence change appears to have occurred independently three times, once as a new spontaneous mutation. One patient with apparently sporadic vWD type IIB was heterozygous for the encoded sequence Val(553)----Met, and this appears to be a new mutation. None of these sequence changes was found in 100 normal alleles. These findings suggest that vWD type IIB may be caused by relatively few distinct mutations, that these mutations may cluster within a specific region of one disulfide loop in vWF domain A1, and that this region can modulate the affinity of vWF for the platelet glycoprotein Ib-IX complex.\r"

  ".W": "Type IIB von Willebrand Disease (vWD) is characterized by the selective loss of large von Willebrand Factor (vWF) multimers from plasma, presumably due to their increased reactivity with platelets and subsequent clearance from the circulation. Using the PCR, one of a panel of four potential missense mutations was identified in each of the 14 patients studied from 11 unrelated families. None of these substitutions was encountered in a large panel of normal DNAs. These changes all represent C----T transitions at CpG dinucleotides, proposed \"hot spots\" for mutation in the human genome. The four resulting amino acid substitutions, Arg543----Trp, Arg545----Cys, Val553----Met, and Arg578----Gln, are all clustered within the GpIb binding domain of vWF. Disruption of this latter functional domain may explain the pathogenesis of Type IIB vWD. By sequence polymorphism analysis, the Arg543----Trp substitution was shown to have occurred as at least two independent mutational events. This latter observation, along with the identification of mutations in all 14 patients studied and their localization to the GpIb binding domain, all strongly suggest that these substitutions represent the authentic defects responsible for Type IIB vWD. This panel of mutations may provide a useful diagnostic tool for the majority of patients with Type IIB vWD.\r"

  ".W": "Exposure of platelets to shear stress leads to aggregation in the absence of exogenous agonists. We have now found that different adhesive proteins and platelet membrane glycoproteins are involved in aggregation depending on the shear stress conditions and the concentration of divalent cations in the medium. When blood is collected with trisodium citrate as anticoagulant, which causes a decrease in the levels of external ionized calcium ([Ca2+]o), platelet aggregation can be induced under low shear force (12 dyn/cm2) and is mediated by fibrinogen binding to the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex. Aggregates formed under these conditions are not stable, and when shear force is increased to 68 dyn/cm2, disaggregation results. By contrast, platelets from blood collected with hirudin as anticoagulant, wherein [Ca2+]o is within normal plasma levels, do not undergo low shear-induced aggregation; however, after exposure to a shear force above 80 dyn/cm2, aggregation is observed but only when von Willebrand factor is present and can interact with both its platelet binding sites, glycoprotein Ib-IX and glycoprotein IIb-IIIa. Fibrinogen is not involved in high shear-induced aggregation which, in fact, occurs normally in patients with severe afibrinogenemia. Thus, von Willebrand factor in the absence of exogenous agonists can mediate platelet aggregation in experimental conditions that may mimic the hemorheological situation of partially occluded arteries. This pathway of platelet aggregation involving only one adhesive ligand and two membrane adhesion receptors may play a relevant role in thrombogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "The ED50 of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I-stimulated alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) uptake (mean +/- SD) in cultured fibroblasts from a child with short stature that we have reported (1.40 +/- 0.24 nM), is significantly higher than the ED50 of IGF-I-stimulated AIB uptake in fibroblasts from 11 normal subjects (0.42 +/- 0.12 nM) and from 127 short children (0.35 +/- 0.11 nM). Similarly, the ED50 of IGF-I-stimulated thymidine incorporation in fibroblasts from this child is 2.8 times higher than that in fibroblasts from four normal subjects. To minimize potential modulation of IGF-I action by endogenous IGF binding proteins in these assays, fibroblast responsiveness to [Q3,A4,Y15,L16]IGF-I, an IGF-I variant that has a 600-fold reduced affinity for serum IGF binding proteins, has been examined. The biological activity of this variant is comparable in the patient's and normal fibroblasts, suggesting that the resistance to IGF-I action cannot be attributed to a defective IGF-I receptor. To investigate directly the possibility that IGF-I sensitivity in the patient's fibroblasts is reduced by endogenous IGF binding proteins (IGFBP), binding proteins that are secreted into AIB assay buffer during a 3-h collection and that are cell-associated at the end of the collection have been analyzed. Ligand blot analysis of conditioned AIB assay buffer demonstrates that fibroblasts from the patient secrete 1.3-2.2 times more of Mr 46,400/42,900, 32,000, and 26,800 binding proteins than normal fibroblasts. The major difference between fibroblasts from the patient and from normal subjects is a striking 10-fold increase in the amount of a cell surface Mr 32,000 binding protein in the patient's fibroblasts. The Mr 32,000 binding protein is similar in size to IGFB-1 and different from IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3, but it does not cross-react with an antibody against IGFBP-1. We conclude that the resistance to IGF-I action in the patient's fibroblasts is caused by an abnormal production and/or cell association of IGF binding proteins.\r"

We show that in quiescent human myometrial cells ET produced a dose-dependent increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ (Cai2+), which was markedly attenuated when the cells were studied in Ca2(+)-free media. Preincubation with nicardipine, diltiazem, or verapamil reduced the ET-evoked Cai2+ transient by 30, 40, and 65%, respectively. The presence of voltage sensitive Ca2+ channels was demonstrated by Mn2+ quenching of fura-2. Activation of the Na+/H+ antiport could not be demonstrated with ET stimulation. In nonquiescent cells, the ET-evoked Cai2+ transient was significantly reduced, while the response to oxytocin was retained. This is at least partially explained by a reduction in Bmax (maximal binding capacity) for ET (mean +/- SEM) from 3,506 +/- 268 binding sites/cell in quiescent cells to 2,411 +/- 300 binding sites/cell, as well as 72% increase in Kd (equilibrium dissociation constant), in the nonquiescent cells. We conclude that, in human myometrial cells, ET and oxytocin modulate Cai2+ through independent receptors and propose that ET, like oxytocin, is an important endogenous modulator of uterine contractility.\r"

  ".W": "To discern the mechanism(s) that underlie abnormal cholesteryl ester transfer (CET) in patients with hypercholesterolemia, we have studied this dysfunctional step in reverse cholesterol transport in 13 subjects with genetically heterogeneous forms of hypercholesterolemia (HC). In all HC patients, the mass of CE transferred in whole plasma from HDL to VLDL and LDL increased rapidly initially and was significantly greater than in controls at 1, 2, and 4 h (P less than 0.005). To further characterize this disturbance, we performed a series of recombination experiments. Combining HC d less than 1.063 containing acceptor VLDL + LDL with the d greater than 1.063 fraction from controls containing donor HDL + CE-transfer protein (CETP) and not the converse combination showed the same characteristics of accelerated CET noted with intact HC plasma, indicating that abnormal transfer was associated with the HC acceptor lipoproteins. When HC VLDL and its subfractions and LDL were isolated separately and then combined with control d greater than 1.063 fractions, accelerated CET was only associated with VLDL1. Consistent with an acceleration of the neutral lipid transfer reaction occurring between HDL and VLDL1 in HC in vivo, we found that the triglyceride/CE ratio was decreased in HC VLDL1 (P less than 0.001), and increased in HDL (P less than 0.25). CETP mass was significantly increased in HC plasma (HC 2.3 +/- 4 micrograms/ml vs. control 1.3 +/- 0.3 micrograms/ml; mean +/- SD; P less than 0.025). This series of observations demonstrate that CET is accelerated in the plasma of HC patients, and this disturbance results from dysfunction of the VLDL1 subfraction rather than an elevation of CETP levels. Since an abnormality of this type in vivo can lead to the accumulation of potentially atherogenic CE-enriched apoB-containing lipoproteins in plasma, it may be an additional previously unrecognized factor that increases cardiovascular risk in HC patients.\r"

  ".W": "The complex events by which digestive enzyme zymogens and lysosomal hydrolases are segregated from each other and differentially transported to their respective membrane-bound intracellular organelles in the pancreas have been noted to be disturbed during the early stages of several models of experimental pancreatitis. As a result, lysosomal hydrolases such as cathepsin B are redistributed to the subcellular zymogen granule-rich fraction and lysosomal hydrolases as well as digestive enzyme zymogens are colocalized within large cytoplasmic vacuoles. The current study was designed to create an in vitro system that would reproduce this redistribution phenomenon. Our results indicate that cathepsin B redistribution occurs when rat pancreatic fragments are incubated with a supramaximally stimulating concentration of the cholecystokinin analogue caerulein along with plasma from an animal subjected to in vivo supramaximal caerulein stimulation. Neither the plasma nor a supramaximally stimulating concentration of caerulein, alone, is sufficient to induce in vitro cathepsin B redistribution. The ability of the plasma to induce in vitro cathepsin redistribution is dependent upon its content of a 10,000-30,000-D protein and is lost by exposure to protease inhibitors. In vitro cathepsin B redistribution also occurs when rat pancreatic fragments are incubated with plasma obtained from opossums with hemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis caused by bile/pancreatic duct ligation.\r"

Basilar arteries were harvested from New Zealand white rabbits fed normal chow or that supplemented with 2% cholesterol for 10 wk. Vessels were cannulated for perfusion at physiologic pressure. Changes in vessel diameter were monitored by videomicroscopy. In comparison to normal vessels, those from hypercholesterolemic animals vasoconstricted more to KCl, endothelin (E), and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). Conversely, vasodilation to acetylcholine (ACh) (but not that to verapamil) was significantly impaired in the hypercholesterolemic animals. In vitro administration of L-arginine (3 mM) for 45 min normalized vasodilation to ACh and vasoconstriction to E, 5-HT, and KCl in the isolated vessels from hypercholesterolemic animals. This effect was stereospecific, since D-arginine had no effect. To conclude, these data confirm that hypercholesterolemia attenuates endothelium-derived relaxation, and enhances the sensitivity of these vessels to vasoconstrictors. In vitro administration of L-arginine normalized vascular reactivity of isolated vessels from hypercholesterolemic animals. Thus, hypercholesterolemia induces a reversible endothelial dysfunction that may be corrected by supplying the precursor of EDRF, L-arginine.\r"

In this study we examine the localization of angiotensinogen mRNA in the blood vessel wall of two rat strains, the Wistar and Wistar Kyoto (WKY), as well as the regulation of vascular angiotensinogen mRNA expression by dietary sodium. Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization histochemistry demonstrate that in both strains angiotensinogen mRNA is detected in the aortic medial smooth muscle layer as well as the periaortic fat. In WKY rats fed a 1.6% sodium diet, angiotensinogen mRNA concentration is 2.6-fold higher in the periaortic fat than in the smooth muscle, as analyzed by quantitative slot blot hybridization. Angiotensinogen mRNA expression in the medial smooth muscle layer is sodium regulated. After 5 d of a low (0.02%) sodium diet, smooth muscle angiotensinogen mRNA levels increase 3.2-fold (P less than 0.005) as compared with the 1.6% sodium diet. In contrast, angiotensinogen mRNA level in the periaortic fat is not influenced by sodium diet. In summary, our data demonstrate regional (smooth muscle vs. periaortic fat) differential regulation of angiotensinogen mRNA levels in the blood vessel wall by sodium. This regional differential regulation by sodium may have important physiological implications.\r"

We provide evidence that PMN both transcribe and translate IL-1 alpha and beta genes after stimulation with LPS or IL-1 alpha. A combination of mouse thymocyte comitogen proliferation assay, ELISA, and immunocytochemistry was required to establish that IL-1 alpha and beta synthesis observed in preparations of PMN could not be accounted for by the low level of contaminating MNL. Synthesis of IL-1 beta in PMN exceeded that of IL-1 alpha, but little or no IL-1 alpha was released by PMN. Although increases in IL-1 mRNA after stimulation of PMN and MNL with LPS were similar, PMN were less efficient than MNL in translating IL-1 mRNA. In contrast, PMN and MNL IL-1 alpha and beta mRNAs were translated with equal efficiency in rabbit reticulocyte lysates, suggesting that synthesis of IL-1 in PMN is subject to some form of translational control. We conclude that PMN stimulated with LPS efficiently transcribe but inefficiently translate IL-1 genes relative to MNL. IL-1 beta transcription and translation predominates over that of IL-1 alpha, and IL-1 beta is the predominant IL-1 protein released by PMN. IL-1 can induce its own synthesis in PMN.\r"

Cocaine in concentrations less than or equal to 10(-4) M caused a contractile response in a dose-dependent manner. The response of control muscle was significantly larger than that in muscle from ferrets pretreated with reserpine. Cocaine-induced contraction was not affected by endothelial factors, but was significantly inhibited by prazosin 10(-7) M pretreatment. The intracellular calcium [( Ca++]i), as measured with aequorin, rose in conjunction with cocaine-induced contraction. The degree of contraction generated by 10(-4) M cocaine decreased after higher concentrations of cocaine greater than or equal to 10(-3) M, while aequorin luminescence remained elevated above the levels before 10(-6) M cocaine. The dose-response relationships of norepinephrine and sympathetic nerve stimulation were enhanced by 10(-6) M cocaine in control muscles; this did not occur in muscles from reserpine pretreated ferrets. In conclusion, (a) cocaine in concentrations less than or equal to 10(-4) M caused vascular contraction presumably by its presynaptic action with consequent alpha-1 adrenoceptor activation and consequent [Ca++]i rise; (b) high concentrations of cocaine greater than or equal to 10(-3) M reduced muscle tone by decreasing the Ca++ sensitivity of the contractile proteins; and (c) supersensitivity to norepinephrine was mediated by cocaine's action on adrenergic nerve endings.\r"

Using radiolabeled sialic acid (NeuAc) as a substrate, we have recently detected and characterized a proton-driven carrier for sialic acid in the lysosomal membrane from rat liver. This carrier also recognizes and transports other acidic monosaccharides, among which are uronic acids. If no alternative routes of glucuronic acid transport exist, the disposal of uronic acids can be affected in the sialic acid storage disorders. In this study we excluded the existence of more than one acidic monosaccharide carrier by measuring uptake kinetics of labeled glucuronic acid [( 3H]GlcAc) in rat lysosomal membrane vesicles. [3H]GlcAc uptake was carrier-mediated with an affinity constant of transport (Kt) of 0.3 mM and the transport could be cis-inhibited or trans-stimulated to the same extent by sialic acid or glucuronic acid. Human lysosomal membrane vesicles isolated from cultured fibroblasts showed the existence of a similar proton-driven transporter with the same properties as the rat liver system (Kt of [3H]GlcAc uptake 0.28 mM). Uptake studies with [3H]NeuAc and [3H]GlcAc in resealed lysosome membrane vesicles from cultured fibroblasts of patients with different clinical presentation of sialic acid storage showed defective carrier-mediated transport for both sugars. Further evidence that the defective transport of acidic sugars represents the primary genetic defect in sialic acid storage diseases was provided by the observation of reduced, half-normal transport rates in lymphoblast-derived lysosomal membrane vesicles from five unrelated obligate heterozygotes. This study reports the first observation of a human lysosomal transport defect for multiple physiological compounds.\r"

  ".W": "We have prepared a construct (designated CATTNF) in which the mouse TNF (cachectin) coding sequence is replaced by a sequence encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), with preservation of the TNF promoter and 3'-untranslated sequences known to be important in the regulation of gene expression. When activated by LPS, permanently transfected RAW 264.7 (mouse macrophage) cells synthesize large quantities of CAT. Unlike TNF itself, CAT is nonsecreted and quite stable in the macrophage cytoplasm. Fewer than 1,000 LPS-induced macrophages can easily be detected by CAT assay. Cells maintain the ability to respond to LPS in vivo; as such, when injected intravenously, they accurately report conditions required for the production of TNF in diverse tissues. These cells may thus be used for the detection of cachectin/TNF synthesis in mice under conditions in which endogenously produced cachectin/TNF would be undetectable. Studies of the expression of CATTNF in nonmacrophage cell lines have revealed that the modified TNF gene is constitutively expressed in L-929 cells, but that its expression is tightly suppressed in HeLa cells and in NIH 3T3 cells. This finding would suggest that certain non-macrophage cells are potentially capable of utilizing the TNF promoter and translating the TNF mRNA; however, the endogenous gene has been developmentally silenced.\r"

Respiratory burst oxidase activity was restricted entirely to the cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton also contained approximately 15% of the neutrophil cytochrome b558, an oxidase-associated heme protein, as well as most of the oxidase-related cytosolic polypeptide p67phox. In contrast, the components of the oxidase-associated phosphoprotein family p47phox were found almost exclusively in the detergent extract, suggesting that p47phox is needed for oxidase activation but not for O2- production by the activated oxidase. Activation of the oxidase had no apparent effect on the distribution of any of these species between the cytoskeleton and the detergent extract. Our results support earlier studies implying that the cytoskeleton participates in an important way in regulating the activity of the O2(-)-forming respiratory burst oxidase of neutrophils.\r"

The syndrome is characterized by T cell infiltration of skin, gut, liver, and spleen leading to diffuse erythroderma, protracted diarrhea, failure to thrive, and hepatosplenomegaly. Blood T cells as well as those infiltrating the skin and gut were found to express activation markers and were partially activated by mitogens but not by antigens. Although the lesions resembled those in graft-versus-host disease, the blood T cells were shown by DNA haplotype analysis using probes revealing variable number of tandem repeats to belong to the patients as well as the T cells infiltrating the gut and skin in one patient. A given T cell subset (TCR alpha beta+, CD4+/CD8+, or TCR gamma delta+) was predominant in each patient, with a specific distribution in the skin lesions. Moreover, the study of T cell receptor beta, gamma, and delta gene rearrangements in four patients revealed oligoclonality involving C beta 1, C beta 2, or different V gamma J gamma or V delta J delta genes. This indicates that restricted heterogeneity of the T cell repertoire, previously reported in one case, is a major feature of this syndrome. The occurrence of alymphocytosis-type severe combined immunodeficiency in the brother of one of the patients suggests that the restricted heterogeneity of T cell receptor gene usage in Omenn's syndrome may arise from leakiness, within the context of a genetically determined faulty T cell differentiation.\r"

The inflammatory polypeptides, IL-1 and TNF, were tested in an experimental rat model as candidate mediators for induction of meningitis and BBB injury. Intracisternal challenge of rIL-1 beta into rats induced neutrophil emigration into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and significantly increased BBB permeability to systemically administered 125I-BSA as early as 3 h later (P less than 0.05). This injury was reversible, dose dependent and significantly inhibited by prior induction of systemic neutropenia (via intraperitoneal cyclophosphamide) or preincubation of the rIL-1 beta inoculum (50 U) with an IgG monoclonal antibody to rIL-1 beta. Similar kinetics and reversibility of CSF inflammation and BSA permeability were observed using equivalent dose inocula of rIL-1 alpha. rTNF-alpha was less effective as an independent inducer of meningitis or BBB injury over an inoculum range of 10(1) U (0.0016 micrograms/kg)-10(6) U (160 micrograms/kg) when injected intracisternally, but inoculum combinations of low concentrations of rTNF alpha (10(3) U) and rIL-1 beta (0.0005-5.0 U) were synergistic in inducing both meningitis and BBB permeability to systemic 125I-BSA. These data suggest that in situ generation of interleukin-1 within CSF (with or without TNF) is capable of mediating both meningeal inflammation and BBB injury seen in various central nervous system infections.\r"

Recent studies indicate that such binding can stimulate the production of antibodies against the acetaldehyde adducts. We raised rabbit antibodies which recognized various protein-acetaldehyde conjugates but not the corresponding control proteins. Such antibodies were used in immunohistochemical studies to find out whether acetaldehyde-generated epitopes can be detected from liver specimens of 13 human subjects with different degrees of alcohol consumption. While the specimens obtained from alcohol abusers (n = 4) and alcoholics (n = 3) exhibited marked positive staining for acetaldehyde adducts inside the hepatocytes in a granular uneven pattern, the control samples (n = 6) were almost devoid of immunoreactivity. In the alcohol abusers with an early stage of alcohol-induced liver damage, staining was detected exclusively around the central veins. The data indicate that intracellular acetaldehyde adducts occur in the centrilobular region of the liver of individuals consuming excessive amounts of alcohol. Immunohistochemical detection of such adducts may prove to be of value in the early identification of alcohol abuse and in elucidating the mechanisms of alcohol-induced organ damage.\r"

Biologically active cell-associated TNF activity peaked at 3 h and was exceeded at 6 h by extracellular activity, which peaked at 12-18 h. Comparable kinetics were observed with immunoreactive TNF alpha. TNF alpha mRNA accumulation in monocytes stimulated with MSU crystals appeared as a single peak at 2-4 h, kinetics compatible with rapid production of a short half-life transcript. In contrast, crystals of calcium pyrophosphate or of hydroxyapatite did not stimulate significant production of TNF or of message. Fresh tophaceous material from a patient with gout contained significant levels of TNF alpha and cells cultured from the tophus produced TNF alpha in vitro. In rheumatoid synovial cells, spontaneous release of TNF alpha was increased by in vitro exposure to MSU crystals. Taken together with earlier work, these results support an expanded view of gouty inflammation in which the crystal-stimulated production of cytokines provides a crucial link between crystal deposition and many of the clinical and pathological facts of both acute and chronic gouty arthritis.\r"

The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether this was due to the presence of beta-adrenergic receptors on the G cells. A newly developed short-term culture system of enriched antral G cells was used to eliminate the possibility of input from factors in the circulation and the peripheral innervation. The results demonstrated that epinephrine and terbutaline (a beta 2 agonist) significantly stimulated gastrin release above basal which could be blocked by the addition of propranolol (beta-adrenergic antagonist). However, the beta 1 agonist, dobutamine, and phenylepinephrine did not stimulate gastrin release above basal. In addition, simultaneous administration of epinephrine and the neuropeptide, bombesin, resulted in a potentiation of gastrin release. It was concluded that the stimulatory effect of the sympathetic system on gastrin release was mediated through beta 2-adrenergic receptors. The data indicated that adrenaline released from the adrenal medulla and gastrin releasing peptide (the mammalian homolog of bombesin) released from the intrinsic innervation of the stomach interact with respect to the stimulation of gastrin.\r"

Both VLA-2 antibodies also inhibited collagen-induced platelet adhesion, but had no effect on fibronectin-induced adhesion of normal platelets.

Insulin resistance was induced by a 20-d continuous intravenous infusion of nicotinic acid (NA). Normal animals showed compensatory increases in several measures of insulin secretion (fasting insulin [FI], acute insulin response to arginine [AIRarg], acute insulin response to glucose [AIRgluc], and glucose potentiation slope [delta AIRarg/delta G]), with no net change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAtc). STZ-40 animals showed compensatory increases in FI, AIRarg, and AIRgluc, but delta AIRarg/delta G failed to compensate. Although FPG remained normal in this group during NA infusion, HbA1c rose significantly. STZ-200 animals failed to show compensatory changes in both AIRgluc and delta AIRarg/delta G, with both HbA1c and FPG rising. These animals showed a paradoxical inhibition of insulin secretion in response to intravenous glucose during NA infusion, at a time when they were hyperglycemic. These data indicate that a significant degree of insulin resistance does not cause hyperglycemia in the presence of normal B cell function but, in animals with reduced B cell mass and superimposed insulin resistance, the degree of hyperglycemia is proportional to the degree of pancreatic B cell dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the nature of the mutant androgen receptor in a family with a severe defect in virilization associated with a qualitative defect in receptor function. The androgen receptor gene in this family contains two structural alterations: a single nucleotide substitution at position 2444 in exon 5 (adenosine----guanosine) that converts tyrosine 761 to a cysteine residue and a shortened glutamine homopolymeric segment in exon 1 that encodes 12 rather than the usual 20-22 glutamines. A family study was performed using polymerase chain reaction amplification of the glutamine-rich segment, and it was shown that the sister of the proband does not carry the mutant allele. The effects of these two mutations on the function of the androgen receptor were studied by introducing the changes, individually and in combination, into cDNAs encoding the normal human androgen receptor and analyzing the receptor protein produced after transfection of the cDNAs into eukaryotic cells. The presence of a cysteine residue at position 761 causes rapid dissociation of dihydrotestosterone from the receptor protein. Marked thermolability of the transfected receptor protein, however, was demonstrable only upon introduction of an androgen receptor cDNA containing both the partial deletion of the glutamine homopolymeric segment and a cysteine residue at position 761. Likewise, the ability of the receptor to stimulate a reporter gene is strikingly diminished only when both alterations are present, suggesting that the shortened glutamine homopolymeric segment amplifies the impairment of receptor function caused by the tyrosine to cysteine substitution.\r"

The cbl analogues, with either modifications of the propionamide side chains of the A-, B-, and C-rings, the acetamide side chain of the B-ring, or the nucleotide moiety, were administered to rats by continuous 14-d subcutaneous infusion. Infusion of cbl-stimulated, cbl-dependent activity. Changes in any part of the cbl molecule always abolished stimulation and, in some cases, caused potent inhibition of both cbl-dependent enzymes. The most inhibitory analogues, OH-cbl[c-lactam], a B-ring analogue, and OH-cbl[e-dimethylamide] and OH-cbl[e-methylamide], two C-ring analogues, decreased mean liver holo-L-methylmalonyl-coenzyme A mutase activity to 65% of control values and increased serum methylmalonic acid concentrations to as high as 3,200% of the control values. Liver methionine synthetase activity was decreased to approximately 20% of the control and mean serum total homocysteine concentrations were increased to 340% of control. A similar level of inhibition was demonstrated in rats who were exposed to 28 d of inhaled nitrous oxide or a prolonged period of dietary cbl deficiency. The inhibitory cbl analogues, nitrous oxide, and diet deficiency all depleted liver cbl. The naturally occurring cbl analogues with modifications of the nucleotide moiety had no effects. We conclude that all parts of the cbl molecule are necessary for in vivo cbl-dependent enzyme activity and that modifications of the side chains of the B and C rings are associated with potent in vivo inhibition of cbl-dependent enzyme activity.\r"

  ".W": "A nonperturbing 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) method was used to monitor the equilibrium distribution of carboxyl 13C-enriched fatty acids (FA) between distinct binding sites on human serum albumin, native human lipoproteins, and/or phospholipid model membranes, under conditions that mimic the normal and diabetic human circulation. Two variables pertinent to the diabetic circulation were examined: FA/albumin mole ratio (as elevated in insulin deficiency and/or nephrosis) and pH (as decreased in acidosis). 13C NMR spectra for samples containing carboxyl 13C-enriched palmitate, human serum albumin, and phospholipid vesicles or native lipoproteins (all samples at pH 7.4, 37 degrees C) exhibited up to six carboxyl NMR resonances corresponding to FA bound to distinct binding sites on albumin and nonalbumin components. When the sample FA/albumin mole ratio was 1, three FA carboxyl resonances were observed (182.2, 181.8, and 181.6 ppm; designated peaks beta, gamma, and beta', respectively). These resonances corresponded to FA bound to three distinct high-affinity binding sites on human serum albumin. When the sample mole ratio value exceeded 1, additional carboxyl resonances corresponding to FA bound to phospholipid vesicles (179.0 ppm, peak phi), lipoproteins (180.7 ppm, peak sigma), and lower affinity sites on albumin (183.8 ppm, peak alpha; 181.9 ppm, peak gamma'), were observed. The intensity of peaks phi and sigma increased with increasing mole ratio or decreasing pH. Using Lorentzian lineshape analysis, the relative mole quantities of FA bound to albumin and nonalbumin binding sites were determined. Plots of the fraction of FA associated with nonalbumin components as a function of FA/albumin mole ratio were linear and extrapolated to the abscissa at a mole ratio value of 1. This pattern of FA distribution was observed regardless of the type of nonalbumin acceptor used (phospholipid vesicles, human high- or low-density lipoproteins) or the type of FA used (palmitate, oleate, or stearate), and provided evidence for negative cooperativity for human serum albumin upon binding of 1 mol of FA per mole albumin. These in vitro NMR results suggest that the threshold FA/albumin mole ratio value for alterations in FA distributions in the human circulation may be 1, rather than 3, as previously held. The pathophysiological implications of these findings are discussed.\r"

We assayed for enterotoxic activity in culture filtrates (CF) of EAggEC strains in Ussing chambers mounted with rabbit ileal mucosa. CF from strain 17-2, a prototype Chilean EAggEC strain, caused a greater rise in potential difference and short circuit current (SCC) than that seen in HB101 control, and this effect was abolished by protease pretreatment and partially stable after heat treatment. Ultrafiltration of 17-2 CF preparations localized the active moiety to the 2-5 kD Mr size range. CF from HB101 transformed with the 17-2 plasmid showed Ussing chamber activity. less than 10-kD CF fractions from five of six other EAggEC strains screened in Ussing chambers gave SCC responses of similar magnitude to 17-2. The 17-2 CF activity was not neutralized after pretreatment with polyclonal anti-STa antibody. Additionally, all of the seven EAggEC strains studied were nonreactive by heat-stable enterotoxin variant STa ELISA, were negative in the suckling mouse assay, and failed to hybridize with heat-stable enterotoxin variant STh and STp DNA probes. In summary, our data indicate that 17-2 produces a low molecular weight, partially heat-stable, protease-sensitive enterotoxin which appears to be plasmid associated, and genetically and immunologically distinct from E. coli STa. Preliminary screening suggests that this tox+ phenotype may be common among EAggEC.\r"

In this study, a portion of the Norwalk viral genome encoding an immunoreactive region was cloned from very small quantities of infected stool using sequence-independent single primer amplification. Six overlapping complementary DNA (cDNA) clones were isolated by immunologic screening. The expressed recombinant protein from a representative clone reacted with six of seven high titer. Norwalk-specific, postinfection sera but not with corresponding preinfection sera. Nucleic acid sequence for all clones defined a single open reading frame contiguous with the lambda gt11-expressed beta-galactosidase protein. Only oligonucleotide probes specific for the positive strand (defined by the open reading frame) hybridized to an RNaseA-sensitive, DNaseI-resistant nucleic acid sequence extracted from Norwalk-infected stool. Furthermore, RNA extracted from serial postinfection, but not preinfection, stools from three of five volunteers hybridized to a Norwalk virus cDNA probe. Clone-specific oligonucleotide probes hybridized with cesium chloride gradient fractions containing purified Norwalk virion. In conclusion, an antigenic, protein-coding region of the Norwalk virus genome has been identified. This epitope has potential utility in future sero- and molecular epidemiologic studies of Norwalk viral gastroenteritis.\r"

Itraconazole, in a dose-dependent manner, enhanced intracellular accumulation of daunorubicin and reversed the drug resistance in murine leukemia P388/ADR cells. In addition, itraconazole corrected the altered plasma membrane potentials of P388/ADR cells. The concentrations of itraconazole that reversed drug resistance are comparable to the plasma levels achieved by therapeutic dosage used in the treatment of fungal infections. Therefore, itraconazole is a potential candidate for in vivo use to reverse multidrug resistance in cancer with added benefit of its antifungal property.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the effects of direct intratracheal instillation of purified eosinophil granule proteins on pulmonary function and airway responsiveness in primates. The results of this study show for the first time that installation of major basic protein (MBP) directly into the trachea of primates results in a significant and dose-related increase in airway responsiveness to inhaled methacholine. Furthermore, MBP and eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) induce a transient bronchoconstriction immediately after instillation that resolves by 1 h postinstillation. In contrast, instillation of other eosinophil granule proteins had no effect on airway responsiveness or pulmonary function. These data indicate a direct role of the eosinophil in the pathogenesis of airway hyperresponsiveness. We suggest that the MBP of human eosinophils has an effector role in the pathogenesis of airway hyperresponsiveness which may involve active interaction with resident airway tissue cells. MBP may also mediate altered lung function in various inflammatory lung diseases associated with pulmonary eosinophilia.\r"

  ".W": "In order to model crypt abscesses, a histological finding which correlates with disease activity in intestinal inflammation, human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) were layered onto monolayers of the human intestinal epithelial cell line T84, a crypt-like epithelium which is capable of Cl- secretion. Such PMN-epithelial interaction had no substantial effect on monolayer integrity or function. However, when PMN were stimulated by conditions including those present naturally in the human colonic lumen, monolayers responded with a bumetanide-sensitive short circuit current (Isc) indicative of Cl- secretion, the basis of secretory diarrhea. This Isc response was induced by a neutrophil-derived secretagogue (NDS), which was only active when applied to the luminal surface of monolayers and did not require PMN-epithelial contact. NDS activity is resistant to boiling, acid, and trypsin and passes a 500 nominal mol wt cutoff filter. NDS activity is not secondary to the respiratory burst products O2- or H2O2 and does not appear to be a myeloperoxidase product. We speculate NDS elicited Cl- secretion may contribute to the secretory diarrhea seen in patients with intestinal inflammation and crypt abscesses.\r"

The NOSGER contains 30 items of behavior, each rated on a 5-point scale according to frequency of occurrence. Item scores are summarized into 6 Dimension scores (memory, instrumental activities of daily life, self-care, mood, social behavior, and disturbing behavior) which are clinically relevant in dementia, depression, and other psychiatric disorders of old age. Validation studies with a preliminary version of the NOSGER indicated good acceptance of the scale, high inter-rater and test-retest reliability, and high correlations of all NOSGER Dimension scores with results of a variety of established assessment instruments. The NOSGER is currently being used in a number of European and North American centers and should turn out to be a useful instrument for longitudinal studies in psychogeriatrics.\r"

This study of 45 SNFs and their 15 attached ICFs evaluated the length of time required to reach physicians by phone about significant clinical changes in patients' conditions and the appropriateness and timeliness of action taken by the physicians once contact was made. Calls on administrative matters, updating of orders, and similar routine calls were excluded. Seven hundred and fifty calls were identified from 24-hour nursing reports; the nature of the problem and the time and details of physicians' responses were recorded from patient charts. Judgment on the quality of physicians' responses was made by consensus of the regional UR committee except in the case of infections where decisions were based on detailed criteria developed in a previous study. The most frequent clinical problems were acute infections (32%), trauma (12%), GI tract disorders (11%), cardiorespiratory problems (10%), neurological disorders (7%), and diabetic control (7%). Results were very encouraging: 96% of physicians' call-backs and actions were judged to be timely, and 87% of physicians' actions taken were judged to be appropriate. However, actions taken were judged inappropriate for certain specific clinical problems, ie, in 22% (54/243) of infections, 24% (4/17) of CVA's, and 12% (6/49) of diabetic control problems. Implications for nursing home care and recommendations for improving the response to acute problems are discussed.\r"

In addition, in two groups of young (less than 65 years; n = 25) and old (greater than 65 years; n = 15) subjects, the effects of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) on LH and alpha-subunit secretion were determined. Age-related increases in serum alpha-subunit and LH were noted only in the oldest men while T levels decreased progressively with advancing age. LHRH stimulation resulted in significantly greater secretion of alpha-subunit in the old subjects while no difference in LH release between young and old men was observed. Moreover, there was a delay to peak LH and alpha-subunit levels after LHRH in the old subjects. These data suggest that the aging process in males involves deficits in both testicular and gonadotroph functions as demonstrated by (1) the relative hypogonadotropic hypogonadism seen until the ninth decade; (2) the hypergonadotropic hypogonadism apparent in men greater than 80 years; (3) the delay in the timing of peak responses of LH and alpha-subunit after LHRH administration; and (4) the disproportionate increase in the secretion of alpha subunit relative to intact LH.\r"

By examining the relationships among the four subscales of the LPRS and conducting factor analyses, it was demonstrated that the four subscales were not measuring different phenomena. The internal consistency of the full 36-item scale was high (Cronbach's Alpha = 0.96) indicating the total LPRS score provided a reliable global index of behavioral function. The total LPRS scores correlated with the independently administered Goldfarb Mental Status Examination scores (r = -0.79). The LPRS differentiated between the normals and the combined demented groups and between inpatients and outpatients. The LPRS continues to have clinical value for functional assessments in a non-intrusive manner. The LPRS may be particularly useful in situations where direct assessment of mental status is not practical.\r"

Sixty-four ambulatory, non-depressed, non-demented veterans greater than 74 years of age were interviewed and educated. Knowledge of CPR at baseline was variable and most overestimated their survival chances. Most subjects desired routine CPR discussions with physicians. Only 17% had previously discussed their CPR preferences, and none had done so with physicians. Knowledge of CPR increased (P = 0.01) after educational intervention. There was no change in subjects' CPR decisions after education and presentation of current CPR outcome data. In considering five hypothetical scenarios, 9% never wanted CPR, and 17% always wanted CPR. Those who never wanted CPR were more realistic about their suspected survival chance (P = 0.003) and had higher educational levels (P = 0.03) Folstein (P = 0.03) and Geriatric Depression Scale (P = 0.04) scores. With the dependent variable being the number of hypothetical situations in which the patient desired CPR, a regression analysis (adjusted r2 = 0.72) limited significant variables to the patient's current CPR decision, Folstein score, religion, marital status, and previous ICU admissions. This study emphasizes that most elderly male veterans are willing and want to discuss their CPR attitude with physicians and that most have fixed CPR decisions which may be elicited under stable clinical conditions.\r"

Thirty-six women aged between 40 and 60 years and 40 women aged 70 years or more were randomly selected from the clients attending an incontinence clinic and interviewed using the SIP questionnaire. Urge and stress incontinence subgroups were defined by means of a symptom questionnaire. Total, psychosocial, and physical dysfunctions were moderate (8%, 7%, and 8% respectively) in general, but major differences were found when age and symptom groups were analysed. Urge symptoms were associated with more impairment than symptoms of stress incontinence. The elderly women with symptoms of stress incontinence were relatively little affected, while their younger counterparts were severely affected, especially in the categories of emotional behavior and recreation and pastimes. We conclude that urinary incontinence in women adversely affects quality of life to a significant degree; the extent depends on the nature of incontinence and the age of the person.\r"

Subjects were studied every 6 months from January 1983 through January 1989, and since enrollment was continuous some participated in more surveys than others. PGC residents were middle class and lived either in a self care apartment house (CL) or nursing home (NH); LCC residents were middle or upper class. Antimicrobial therapy for asymptomatic bacteriuria was not given by the study team. The ages of the 865 women studied averaged 80.3, 82.8, and 83.3 years in LCC, CL, and NH, respectively. On each survey about 11% at LCC, 18% at CL, and 25% at NH sites had positive cultures. Turnover was high. The conversion rate from a negative to a positive culture was 5% at LCC, 11% at CL, and 8% at NH. The reversion rate from a positive to a negative culture was 33% at LCC, 34% at CL and 31% at NH (P greater than 0.05). Persistent infection with the same organism was uncommon. Infection risk was associated with residence, which was partially explained by a factor evaluating mobility, but was unrelated to age or scores evaluating activities of daily living or mental status. Besides mobility, other more complex factors play a role in the acquisition of infection.\r"

Care of the elderly would be enhanced by research focused on defining those older patients most at risk of experiencing NSAID-induced peptic complications, improved methods for preventing or treating NSAID-induced ulceration that are well tolerated and cost-effective, and better regimens for preventing the recurrence of ulcers and UGI bleeding in these patients.

  ".W": "Two major groups of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) strains, A and B, have been identified and their patterns of isolation determined in different communities but not simultaneously in multiple communities. In this study, we tested 483 RSV isolates from 14 university laboratories in the United States and Canada for the 1984/1985 and 1985/1986 RSV seasons; 303 (63%) isolates were group A, 114 (24%) were group B, and 66 (14%) could not be grouped. Isolates were subdivided into six subgroups within group A and three within group B; up to six and often four or more different subgroups were isolated in the same laboratory during the same RSV season. The pattern of group and subgroup isolations varied among laboratories during the same year and between years for the same laboratory. These differences suggest that RSV outbreaks are community, possibly regional, but not national phenomena. The ability to identify group and subgroup differences in isolates is a powerful tool for epidemiologic studies of RSV.\r"

  ".W": "To better understand the duration of immunity against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and the role of serum antibodies to the surface glycoproteins, F and G, in susceptibility to reinfection, 15 adults with previous natural RSV infection were challenged with RSV of the same strain group (A) at 2, 4, 8, 14, 20, and 26 months after natural infection. By 2 months about one-half and by 8 months two-thirds of the subjects became reinfected. Each challenge resulted in infection in at least one-fourth of the subjects. Within 26 months 73% had two or more and 47% had three or more infections. The duration of immunity tended to increase after two closely spaced infections. Higher neutralizing, F and GA antibody levels before challenge correlated significantly with protection against infection. However, even in subjects with the highest antibody levels, the risk of reinfection was 25%. Specific nasal IgA antibody titers did not correlate significantly with protection. This suggests that humoral neutralizing, F, and G antibodies correlate with resistance to reinfection, but protection is far from complete and is of short duration.\r"

  ".W": "Testing saliva for the detection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies has many potential advantages for epidemiologic surveillance. A commercial ELISA kit and a standardized in-house immunoblot (IB) system were slightly modified to enhance antibody detection in saliva. Frozen saliva specimens from Toronto Sexual Contact Study participants (including sequential saliva specimens collected during seroconversion) were tested as were fresh saliva samples collected from a population of street-based intravenous drug users (IVDUs). HIV antibody results on saliva were compared with HIV serostatus determined by ELISA and IB on serum or dried blood spots. The overall sensitivity was 98.3% (117/119) for the kit and 99.2% (118/119) for IB; the specificity was 100% (429/429). In the IVDU population, compliance in the voluntary submission of specimens increased from 69% agreeing to provide blood samples to 89% agreeing to provide blood, saliva, or both. Saliva specimens can be easily collected under difficult field conditions with minimal training and provide a valuable alternative to testing blood for HIV-seroprevalence studies.\r"

  ".W": "CD4(178)-PE40 is a recombinant protein consisting of a portion of human CD4 linked to active domains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A. In previous experiments with human T cell lines, the hybrid toxin was found to selectively kill cells infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and to inhibit HIV-1 spread in mixtures of infected and uninfected cells. CD4(178)-PE40 inhibits HIV-1 spread in cultured primary human lymphocytes. Moreover, the hybrid toxin selectively kills HIV-1 chronically infected monocyte/macrophage cell lines and inhibits HIV-1 spread in primary macrophage cultures. Control experiments indicate that the protective effects of CD4(178)-PE40 against HIV-1 spread are due to selective killing of the infected cells rather than simply to neutralization by the CD4 moiety. Thus, for the major cell types susceptible to HIV infection in vivo, surface envelope glycoprotein is expressed at sufficient levels to enable binding and internalization of CD4(178)-PE40 and consequent selective cell killing.\r"

  ".W": "Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) is characterized by focal lesions of hemorrhage and necrosis, primarily in the inferior temporal lobe. Since immunosuppressed patients with HSE lack the focal inflammatory changes and temporal lobe localization, it has been suggested that the immune system participates in the pathogenesis of HSE. Evaluation of this hypothesis has been impeded by the lack of an immunologically defined animal model that resembles the human disease. Toward this end, 10 strains of inbred mice were infected intranasally with a neurovirulent clinical isolate of herpes simplex virus type 1. Most mice died without localizing signs of disease in the central nervous system. However, a significant number of SJL mice had a pattern of encephalitis highly reminiscent of that described in humans. To our knowledge, this is the first murine model that faithfully mimics this human disease, and thus it affords the opportunity to study the immunopathogenesis of HSE.\r"

Of 98 placebo recipients, 39 (40%) developed 43 lesions inside or within 10 mm of the irradiated zone. The temporal distribution of lesions was bimodal. 11 (26%) occurring within 48 h (immediate) and 32 (72%) 2-7 days after UVR exposure (delayed). Prophylactic peroral ACV begun 7 days before or 5 min after UVR prevented the development of the delayed but not the immediate lesions (P less than .001). When peroral ACV was started 48 h after UVR, delayed lesions developed but were less severe (P = .01-.05). Prophylactic topical ACV begun 5 min after UVR did not reduce lesion frequency or severity. ACV therapy can be efficacious, but some rapidly developing lesions are unresponsive to treatment. This suggests that more than one process may contribute to the pathogenesis of herpes labialis.\r"

The vaccine was highly immunogenic in the seronegative vaccinees; 54% of the seropositive vaccinees also developed an increase in serum antibody. The ca vaccine was well tolerated, with only a mild increase in upper respiratory tract symptoms seen in the seronegative vaccinees.

The most important factors for predicting chlamydial infection were the presence of a sibling with laboratory evidence of infection, increased number of flies around the house, a household that herded cattle, and practice of a local religion. Younger children and girls were at no increased risk for a positive laboratory test, although these subgroups have more clinical disease. The data are compatible with a model of less frequent episodes of reinfection as children become older.\r"

Using this technique, it was not possible to find broadly cross-reactive core LPS antibodies after immunization of rabbits and humans with rough mutants of gram-negative bacteria.

A median three-fold increase in antibodies directed against J5 LPS was observed, but no significant increase in the antibodies against Re LPS or lipid A was found. Since J5 antiserum did not react with several smooth LPS or with Re LPS and lipid A, cross-reactivity could not be demonstrated.

  ".W": "The c protein (Ibc) of group B streptococci (GBS) is associated with at least four antigens (alpha, beta, gamma, delta). To assess the virulence potential of these antigens, 255 GBS isolates recovered from septic neonates, healthy neonates, and pregnant women were serotyped and surveyed for reactivity with sera to c protein and the four associated antigens. A radioimmunoassay using intact bacteria was used to detect the GBS antigens. In contrast to earlier reports, most (66%) of the type III strains expressed the c protein. Except for the gamma antigen, none of the other c protein-associated antigens showed an increased association with pathogenic strains independent of the polysaccharide antigens. The gamma antigen was expressed by 15 of 41 c protein-positive early-onset strains and by 4 of 38 c protein-positive late-onset strains (P = .007). This association was independent of the type-specific antigen, suggesting a potential role for the gamma antigen as a virulence factor in GBS strains causing early-onset sepsis.\r"

Unfortunately, most conventional immunoglobulin preparations possess little GBS antibody. The protective activity of a human monoclonal antibody (HuMAb) and a human hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin (HivIg) were evaluated against these organisms and compared with a conventional intravenous immunoglobulin (ivIg). The HuMAb and the HivIg possessed significant protective activity (50%-95%) against extremely virulent strains of types I, II, and III GBS in doses as low as 4-20 mg/kg. In contrast, the conventional ivIg had little protective activity against some of these strains in doses as high as 500 mg/kg. The opsonic activity of the HuMAb and HivIg also usually exceeded that of the conventional ivIg. These studies suggest HivIg or HuMAb with markedly enhanced specific activity may provide optimal immunotherapy for GBS infections.\r"

Control rats were fed the same diet except that ethanol was replaced isocalorically with carbohydrate. Ethanol treatment increased pneumococcal bacteremia, levels of capsular polysaccharide antigenemia, and susceptibility to lethal pneumonia. Once dissemination occurred, ethanol-fed rats failed to eliminate pneumococci from the bloodstream. Ethanol-fed rats demonstrated a defect in late pulmonary clearance of pneumococci that was temporally associated with a significantly higher pneumonia severity index. Pneumonia was characterized by an intense polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration, severe edema, and a fibrous exudate. Bronchoalveolar lavage confirmed the heightened inflammatory response in the lungs of ethanol-fed rats, suggesting that chronic ethanol intoxication did not impair polymorphonuclear leukocyte recruitment but may alter their antipneumococcal functions.\r"

Capsular type was determined for 87 isolates: 70% were capsular type 9V, 28% 9N, and 2% 9A. In terms of protein type, the 9V isolates were four times as diverse as the 9N isolates. Significant associations were observed between the protein type, geographic origin, and year of isolation. Statistically significant associations were also observed between different manifestations of pneumococcal disease and protein type of the capsular type 9V isolates. Thus, even within capsular types, pneumococci can be highly diverse; pneumococcal protein types may be useful in epidemiologic studies to distinguish related strains in the environment.\r"

Previously it was shown that HO. is not a physiologic product of human neutrophils or monocytes but can be generated in the presence of high concentrations of iron. This study was undertaken to determine whether bacterial iron could be used for the generation of HO. The growth of Staphylococcus aureus under iron-rich conditions increased bacterial iron concentration and phagocytosis of iron-rich bacteria allowed neutrophils to accumulate threefold more iron than ingestion of iron-starved organisms. Neither neutrophils nor monocytes ingesting iron-rich S. aureus generated iron-catalyzed HO. at levels detectable by spin-trapping techniques. No differences in the killing of iron-rich organisms by neutrophils was noted. The results suggest that HO. does not play a role in the killing of S. aureus by human neutrophils, regardless of their ability to deliver iron to the cell.\r"

  ".W": "Although up to 40% of patients with early syphilis have evidence of central nervous system (CNS) invasion by Treponema pallidum, the pathogenesis of CNS syphilis is not understood. A rabbit model that mimics early CNS involvement in humans was developed and characterized. Mild cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis was evident 2 weeks after intracisternal inoculation of T. pallidum and peaked at 9 weeks. The VDRL test in cerebrospinal fluid was reactive in 24% of animals, most commonly at 9 weeks after infection. T. pallidum could be isolated from the CNS of animals infected for 4, 6, or 9 weeks but not from animals infected for 12 or 20 weeks. Clinically, 6% of animals developed uveitis, similar to the frequency in patients with secondary syphilis. Thus, this model of meningeal and ocular syphilis seems to be analogous to the early CNS infection in humans and can be used for studies of pathogenesis and treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Molecular analysis of the humoral response to pathogen-specific polypeptides was done using sera from patients at different stages of syphilis and sera from Treponema pallidum-infected rabbits and guinea pigs collected at various times after infection. The sera were examined by ELISA, fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test (FTA-ABS), and immunoblot before and after sequential adsorption with cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B coupled individually to five sonicated nonpathogenic treponemes. Guinea pig antisera were also adsorbed with rabbit proteins. After adsorption, sera from all three species reacted neither by ELISA nor by immunoblot with nonpathogenic treponemes, nor did guinea pig sera react with rabbit proteins. Regardless of the species of treponema used for initial adsorption, none by itself could effectively remove all cross-reactivities. Nine pathogen-specific polypeptides (15, 17, 33, 37, 39, 43, 45, 47, 97 kDa), eight (15-47 kDa) known as integral membrane or endoflagellar components, were commonly recognized by the tree species when chancre immunity developed. The substantial reduction in immune reactivity after adsorption suggests that most of these peptides consist of specific and common treponemal epitopes. Throughout the various stages of the human disease, pathogen-specific antibodies were exclusively of the IgG isotype.\r"

Isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (n = 7) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 13) produced a significant increase in leukotriene B4 generation by peritoneal macrophages compared with unstimulated cells (P less than .001). The coincubation of peritoneal macrophages with gram-negative organisms (n = 3), however, did not result in an increase in leukotriene B4 synthesis. In contrast, all the organisms tested significantly inhibited the formation of prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane B2 but the degree of inhibition was species dependent. The above results were reproduced using bacteria-free supernatants, indicating that the interaction was dependent on a secreted bacterial product. Thus in response to certain bacterial species, the recruitment of neutrophils may be facilitated by the generation of leukotriene B4 from peritoneal macrophages. In addition, the reduction in synthesis of prostaglandin E2 may remove a regulatory effect that this metabolite has on the immune response.\r"

A third subgroup, A/4, exhibited more extensive genomic heterogeneity, but all isolates were distinguishable from those in subgroups A/2 and A/2V. Individual RSV epidemic seasons included isolates representing multiple subgroups of group A and multiple intrasubgroup variants, in addition to isolates from group B. Isolates that were indistinguishable by either antigenic or genomic analysis were present in more than one epidemic season.

To address the potential usefulness of this approach, a monoclonal antibody directed against the host cell receptor for the coronavirus MHV-A59 was administered to infant mice that were then challenged oronasally with 10(4) intracerebral infant mouse median lethal doses of MHV-A59. Antibody treatment of virus-challenged mice resulted in lower proportions of mice with MHV-A59 in target organs and markedly reduced viral titers in these organs compared with mock-treated infected mice. Some antibody-treated infected mice survived for 7 days after viral challenge, whereas no mock-treated, infected mice survived beyond day 3 after viral inoculation. These results support a receptor-targeted approach to intervention in coronavirus disease.\r"

Levels were significantly higher in spinal fluids than in serum samples, and the TNF alpha bioactivity of spinal fluids and sera was considerably below predictions based on ELISA measurements. Gel filtration chromatography demonstrated the presence of both polymeric (greater than 200 kDa) and oligomeric (10-40 kDa) TNF alpha in spinal fluid. Significant bioactivity was obtained only from samples containing oligomeric cytokine. In agreement with previous in vitro findings, these results strongly indicate that bioactive TNF alpha oligomers form inactive polymers and monomers, which could contribute to the observed in vivo discrepancies between immunoreactive and bioactive protein. Finally, the data support the concept of local central nervous system production of TNF alpha in meningitis.\r"

  ".W": "The genetic characteristics and biochemical and structural properties of a number of autoagglutinating (AA) strains of Aeromonas associated with invasive and noninvasive disease in humans and infections in animals and from environmental sources were investigated. Of 27 strains analyzed by multilocus enzyme typing and DNA hybridization studies, 25 (93%) were confirmed to belong to either hybridization group 1 (phenospecies and genospecies Aeromonas hydrophila) or 8 (phenospecies Aeromonas sobria; genospecies Aeromonas veronii). Further analysis of 19 of these strains indicated that four major groups could be identified on the basis of serologic and surface characteristics, protein and lipopolysaccharide composition, and virulence properties; these groupings held true regardless of the site of isolation or disease process involved. The major AA+ group identified was serogroup O:11, whose strains possessed an S layer, were resistant to the bactericidal activity of normal serum, and were pathogenic in mice. The results suggest a set of useful phenotypic and structural markers for identification of specific subsets of mesophilic Aeromonas involved in a wide range of infections in the animal kingdom.\r"

Pneumococcal bacteremia was documented in six cases (50%); in three of these, pneumococci were also cultured from the involved soft tissues. In the cases in which bacteremia was not demonstrated, pneumococci were isolated from the infected sites. Six patients had connective tissue diseases, of which five were diagnosed as systemic lupus erythematosus. Four of these patients were receiving corticosteroids when their infections developed. Two additional patients were HIV-seropositive intravenous drug users. S. pneumoniae may be a more important cause of soft-tissue infections than previously appreciated, especially in patients with connective tissue diseases.\r"

A system has been developed in which different clones of fibroblasts were incorporated into a floating whole blood clot. The effect of the incorporated fibroblasts on clot lysis has been analyzed in relation to their basic characteristics: clot retraction, production of plasminogen activators (PAs) and their inhibitors (PAIs), and secretion of collagen. In neoplastic fibroblast-enriched clots, secretion of PA was associated with spontaneous lysis of a whole blood clot. Normal fibroblasts, secreting levels of PA and PAI similar to those of the cancer cells, did not induce spontaneous lysis of the clot. Moreover, these cells protected whole blood clot from thrombolysis by added PA. Our data show that the resistance to fibrin clot degradation induced by normal fibroblasts was mainly mediated by collagen secretion and deposition rather than PAI secretion or retraction of the clot. We suggest a key role for normal fibroblasts in the acquisition of resistance to proteolytic fibrin degradation of whole blood clots through the secretion of collagen.\r"

Two subpopulations of patients with SCN were defined by their pattern of absolute neutrophil response, superoxide production, and cytochrome b559 levels. One group had an oscillating absolute neutrophil count and reduced ability to produce superoxide and cytochrome b559 (n = 4), and the second group had a relatively constant absolute neutrophil count response with normal superoxide and cytochrome levels (n = 3). Neutrophils from both groups had decreased surface expression of FcRIII and abnormal upregulation of the C3bi receptor (CR3). All patient neutrophils, however, had normal contents of the primary granule constituent, beta-glucuronidase, and the specific granule constituent, vitamin B 12 binding protein. The clinical response to rhG-CSF was evident by marked improvement in the degree of periodontitis and reduction in the number of oral ulcers in both groups of patients. Although neutrophil function is not completely normal in patients with SCN, it is likely that enough redundancy exists in neutrophil bactericidal capacity to promote normal host response to inflammation.\r"

Ingestion of fluorescent bacteria by CGD and myeloperoxidase-deficient PMNs was significantly increased, that is, about 1.5 times that of normal controls. In CGD carriers, two PMN populations were found: one population consisted of PMNs with enhanced phagocytosis, and the other consisted of PMNs with normal phagocytic activity. With a two-dimensional analysis, we also demonstrated in CGD carriers that phagocytosis of the PMNs that failed to generate hydrogen peroxide was significantly elevated, as was phagocytosis of PMNs in patients with CGD, while on the other hand, the PMNs that normally produced hydrogen peroxide exhibited a normal phagocytic activity. When sodium azide, an inhibitor of myeloperoxidase and catalase, was added to control and carrier PMNs, phagocytic activity was significantly increased, p less than 0.01 in both, but not to the level seen with CGD PMNs. Phagocytosis of CGD and myeloperoxidase-deficient PMNs, however, remained unchanged by the azide treatment. On the basis of above findings, we speculate that phagocytosis of CGD PMNs is increased because the H2O2-myeloperoxidase-halide system, which may modulate phagocytic activity of PMNs, fails to operate.\r"

Hepatic fatty acyl:cholesterol acyl transferase activity and cholesterol content were not measurably affected by probucol. Probucol also abolished the induction of HMG CoA reductase activity that resulted from feeding of lovastatin, when activity was measured in microsomes washed free of drugs. These effects are consistent with previous reports that probucol increases fractional clearance of lipoprotein cholesterol by the liver. The findings raise the possibility that some patients with hypercholesterolemia may benefit from combined therapy with lovastatin plus probucol.\r"

The continuous intravenous infusion of the AVP antagonist (36 micrograms/12 microliters/day) via osmotic minipumps over 11 days resulted in an increase in urine volume and a decrease in urinary osmolality by approximately 10-fold on the first day, but in subsequent days this response decreased in both the post-MI (n = 7) and normal (n = 6) rats. Nevertheless, the daily urine volume remained significantly higher and the urinary osmolality lower in the post-MI rats than in the normal ones throughout the study (p less than 0.05). In two other groups of post-MI (n = 5) and normal (n = 6) rats, intermittent intraperitoneal injections of the AVP antagonist (100 micrograms/kg) every third day resulted in a profound diuresis that was reproducible by each injection and was again significantly greater in the post-MI rats than in the normal rats (p less than 0.05). The cumulative urinary output over the first 10-day period of each treatment was greater with intermittent injections than with continuous infusion in both the post-MI and normal rats, but the difference was significant only in the post-MI rats (398.82 +/- 12.87 ml vs 309.07 +/- 32.44 ml, intermittent vs continuous, respectively, p less than 0.05), even though the cumulative dose of AVP antagonist given intermittently was only about one third of that given continuously.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Renal response to PTH in terms of 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1-hydroxylase (1-OHase) stimulation involves increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production, increased cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity, and dephosphorylation of renal ferredoxin (renoredoxin). To identify the step where diabetes might impair PTH stimulation of 1-OHase, we studied the effects of PTH on 1,25(OH)2D production, cAMP content, cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity, and the phosphorylation state of renoredoxin by using renal slices from diabetic and nondiabetic rats. PTH and forskolin significantly stimulated 1,25(OH)2D production in renal slices from nondiabetic animals but not from diabetic animals. PTH-stimulated cAMP production and cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity in renal slices were not altered by diabetes. However, diabetes significantly impaired the capacity of PTH to dephosphorylate renoredoxin and to increase the activity of the 1-OHase enzyme complex. These results suggest that the decreased capacity of PTH to stimulate 1-OHase activity in diabetic animals may reflect the decreased capacity of PTH to alter the phosphorylation state of renoredoxin in these animals.\r"

It is obvious that such a marker would have its greatest utility in patients with mild or early osteoarthritis. CMGP is a disulfide-bonded 550,000 dalton cartilage matrix glycoprotein with a half-life of only 48 to 72 hours that has been found, through immunolocation analysis, in the serum of dogs with experimentally induced osteoarthritis and in the synovial fluid of patients with osteoarthritis but not other types of arthritis. To determine whether detection of CMGP in serum might be of value in identifying patients with \"early\" osteoarthritis, we examined serum samples from 26 patients with knee pain who had articular cartilage lesions of osteoarthritis at arthroscopy but whose knee radiographs were normal or showed only mild or moderate osteoarthritis. CMGP was identified by immunolocation analysis with specific antibodies. Eleven patients (42%) were seropositive for CMGP. In two, the degenerative cartilage lesions visualized at arthroscopy were mild (grade 2); in the other nine they were more severe (grade 3 or 4). However, 10 of the 15 seronegative patients also had grade 3 or 4 cartilage degeneration. Thus, this serum assay for CMGP was often negative in this group of patients in the presence of well-defined cartilage degeneration.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Despite the importance of the epidemic of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), little is known about the incidence and prevalence of AIDS in the patient population of primary care physicians. This study was designed as an initial step in evaluating the impact of this disease on primary care practices. METHODS. We conducted a survey to characterize the AIDS cases in the Ambulatory Sentinel Practice Network (ASPN). ASPN is a practice-based primary care research network. In 1987 it was composed of 65 practices and 193 clinicians serving approximately 270,000 patients in the United States and Canada. Clinicians representing each practice were asked to report the number of AIDS patients that their practice cared for between January 1982 and December 1987. They were further asked to characterize relevant data for these patients. RESULTS. Thirty-nine prevalent cases of AIDS were reported in ASPN from January 1982 through December 1987. Seventy-nine percent of the patients were male, 15 to 44 years of age; three patients (7.6%) were female; and all cases had at least one risk factor for AIDS. An expected number of cases for the 194,973 patients of 47 practices was calculated using age-sex register data and nationally based rates from 1986. The projected number, 13, corresponded with the number of AIDS cases, 11 and 15, reported from ASPN practices in 1986 and 1987, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. This survey suggests that AIDS is at least as prevalent in the primary care practices in ASPN as predicted using national estimates, and may, in fact, be more prevalent. Primary care clinicians need to be prepared to assume a major role in addressing the AIDS epidemic.\r"

The majority of those surveyed had worried about catching HIV and had spoken with friends or relatives about HIV. Approximately 7.5% had had the HIV test. Approximately half of all the respondents expressed a desire to discuss HIV-related issues with their family doctor; however, less than 8% had actually done so. The majority of the respondents believed their family doctor was competent to answer questions about HIV disease. Furthermore, the majority were well informed about the modes of transmission of HIV. Many of the respondents were unsure of the lack of risk from casual contact, however, and whether acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is incurable at the present time. CONCLUSIONS. Family physicians need to take a more active role in educating and counseling patients about HIV disease.\r"

METHODS. During routine screening of 14,890 patients, 174 patients with elevated diastolic blood pressures but no previous diagnosis of hypertension were identified over a 3-month period. Only 115 (64%) returned as requested for two subsequent blood pressure readings. RESULTS. Sixty percent of those returning fit the definition for hypertension using the criteria of the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of Hypertension. Sixty-nine percent (43/62) of the men and 49% (26/53) of the women were hypertensive. Women under 40 years old were less likely to be hypertensive, but age did not predict hypertension in men. Among those patients with a diastolic pressure reading below 105 mm Hg, progressively higher diastolic readings on the first visit did not predict a higher probability of hypertension. Among those patients with a diastolic pressure reading above 105 mm Hg, however, 90% (9/10) were hypertensive. CONCLUSIONS. Physicians should take incidental elevation of diastolic pressure seriously because of the high prevalence of confirmed hypertension in this group of patients.\r"

A physician can obtain a patient's complete lipoprotein profile at the time of the office visit including assays of the total serum cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and fasting triglyceride concentrations, and then calculate the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Until recently, this was not possible. Instruments are currently available that provide reliable rapid total serum cholesterol and fasting triglyceride measurements. METHODS. This study evaluated the accuracy and precision of a recently developed analytical method for the rapid measurement of HDL-C (Seralyzer Cholesterol System) as compared with a reference clinical laboratory method (Kodak Ektachem 700 XR). Blood specimens were taken from 90 participants and were analyzed in duplicate for HDL-C concentrations and total cholesterol using the Seralyzer and a standard Ektachem 700 XR. RESULTS. Nearly all (98.9%) of the initial Seralyzer HDL-C measures were within +/- 0.08 mmol/L (+/- 3 mg/dL) of the duplicate Seralyzer values. Most (98.3%) of the Seralyzer HDL-C results were within +/- 0.16 mmol/L (+/- 6 mg/dL) of the Kodak HDL-C values. CONCLUSIONS. The Seralyzer HDL-C test provides a reliable and accurate measure of the HDL-C concentration.\r"

The difficulty could be that fluid behavior at the lung capillary membrane level may vary depending on the patient's particular pathology. METHODS. Mortality rates taken from randomized controlled trials were analyzed to compare colloidal and crystalloidal fluid for resuscitation efforts. We controlled for the underlying pathological process by categorizing subjects into three groups: (1) surgical stress, (2) hypovolemia, and (3) severe pulmonary failure. A cost-effectiveness analysis also was performed. RESULTS. No statistically significant differences in mortality rates were found. The cost of each life saved using crystalloids is $45.13, and the cost of each life saved using colloidal solutions is $1493.60. CONCLUSIONS. Because there is no significant mortality-rate advantage to using colloids, and because the cost-effectiveness ratio for crystalloids is much lower than for colloids, it is concluded that crystalloids should always be used in resuscitation efforts.\r"

Because of the association between locus of control and anxiety, this study was conducted to determine the health locus of control (HLOC) in patients with panic attacks, changes in HLOC through treatment of panic attacks, and the relationship between HLOC and phobic avoidance. METHODS. The HLOC and panic screening questionnaires were administered to 50 patients complaining of a panic-related symptom or condition known to be associated with panic, and to 119 randomly selected patients. Nineteen patients with panic attacks were later reevaluated to determine if there had been a change in locus of control. RESULTS. Stepwise multiple regression demonstrated that panic attacks, educational level, and being divorced significantly predicted HLOC (F = 5.66, P less than or equal to .0001). An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) showed that resolution of panic attacks was associated with a greater decrease in the HLOC score (F = 4.68, P less than or equal to .05). Phobic avoidance was also associated with greater levels of externality (r = .48, P less than or equal to .05) and correlated with HLOC in response to treatment. CONCLUSIONS. This study suggests there is a significant relationship between HLOC and panic attacks, and between HLOC and phobic avoidance. Panic resolution is associated with a decrease in externality. Measurement of HLOC may be helpful in assessing the treatment response of patients who have panic attacks.\r"

During the past 10 years several studies have shown that lead is toxic to children at levels previously thought to be harmless. Black children living in urban neighborhoods have been identified as being at greatest risk. METHODS. To determine whether children seen in a suburban family practice center were being exposed to lead, voluntary screening of 1-year-old patients was performed. RESULTS. Over a 7-month period venous specimens for blood lead level were obtained from 40 children. Seventeen (43%) of the children had levels of 0.0 to 0.2 mumol/L (0 to 4 micrograms/dL). Fifteen (38%) had levels of 0.24 to 0.43 mumol/L (5 to 9 micrograms/dL). Eight (20%) children had levels of 0.48 mumol/L (10 micrograms/dL) or greater. The highest value obtained was 0.82 mumol/L (17 micrograms/dL). Seventy-five percent of the children with significantly elevated lead levels resided in suburban communities. CONCLUSIONS. Children seen in a suburban family practice setting are at risk for lead exposure, and screening should be considered by primary care physicians who practice in nonurban settings.\r"

A study group of forced early retirees was compared with two control groups: (1) regular steel industry retirees, and (2) regular retirees from jobs outside the steel industry. Utilizing multivariate analysis techniques, the effects of retirement on a number of different health measures were isolated. RESULTS. Over the long term, the health of forced retirees does not seem adversely affected by sudden job loss and unexpected retirement, at least in the steel industry. CONCLUSIONS. Continuity theories of retirement--that workers do not experience abrupt catastrophic changes in lifestyle and in health--best explain the lack of negative health impacts.\r"

Video recordings of these performances were rated by a large sample of experienced and inexperienced neurologists and by psychology undergraduates, using a four point scale. Inter-rater reliability was moderately high, being higher for gait than hand function items. Clinical experience proved to have no systematic effect on ratings or their reliability. The idiosyncrasy of particular performances was a major source of unreliable ratings. Study 2 examined the intercorrelation of several standard rating scales, comprised of sign-and-symptom items as well as activities of daily living. The correlation between scales was high, ranging from 0.70 to 0.83, despite considerable differences in item composition. Inter-item correlations showed that the internal cohesion of the tests was high, especially for the self-care scale. Regression analysis showed that the relationship between the scales could be efficiently captured by a small selection of test items, allowing the construction of a much briefer test.\r"

The stereological estimates made in this study are unbiased, in that they are independent of nerve cell size, section thickness and of dimensional changes in brain tissue induced by histological procedures. The stereological method is considerably more efficient than previous conventional methods.\r"

The COR was found to be weak or absent in both groups. The VOR gain was similar in the two groups but five patients had a significant asymmetry of the response. There was no evidence of abnormal cervico-vestibular interaction during active head rotation. The study suggests that the VOR asymmetry frequently found in ST cannot be explained on the basis of an abnormal cervical input.\r"

  ".U": "91186140\r", 
  ".W": "To determine the possible role of Wallerian degeneration secondary to the grey matter neuronal loss in the pathogenesis of \"leuko-araiosis\", computerised tomography (CT) of the brain was studied in 98 normotensive and non diabetic subjects free of cardiac diseases: 32 with Alzheimer's disease, 36 with Parkinson's disease, eight with progressive supranuclear palsy, and 22 controls. In Alzheimer's disease, leuko-araiosis scores were greater than in control subjects. Leuko-araiosis was more prominent in anterior periventricular areas in Parkinson's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy, and in posterior periventricular areas in Alzheimer's disease. In two patients with Alzheimer's disease and leuko-araiosis, necropsy revealed diffuse white matter pallor, mild fibrillary astrocytosis, and in one patient limited hyaline thickening of small white matter vessels, without any infarction or hypertensive change. Changes were more severe in white matter close to cortical areas with a great density of neurofibrillary tangles. Leuko-araiosis was more severe or more widespread in Alzheimer's disease than in Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and normal ageing. Differences in the location of leuko-araiosis between the four groups might be due to differences in the location of the grey matter disorder and Wallerian degeneration rather than amyloid in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and normal ageing. Wallerian degeneration might be another cause of leuko-araiosis in neuro-degenerative disorders beside previously reported extra-cerebral predisposing factors and amyloid angiopathy.\r"

  ".W": "Traumatic intracerebral haematomas are a common neurosurgical emergency. Their management, particularly the role of surgical removal, is controversial. Deterioration often occurs late, and is unpredictable. Eight patients with traumatic intracerebral haematomas were admitted to the neurosurgical unit to monitor their clinical state. All were studied within 48 hours of admission with single photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT), using the recently introduced radionuclide 99Technetiumm-Hexamethyl propylene amine oxime (99Tcm-HMPAO). At the time of the SPECT study, all the patients had been clinically stable. Three patients remained so; in the other five, the conscious level deteriorated, necessitating craniotomy and evacuation of the haematoma. In all the patients, the SPECT studies demonstrated perfusion defects that corresponded to the location of the haematoma, as demonstrated by computerised tomography (CT). However, in the five patients who subsequently deteriorated, the perfusion defects seen on the SPECT scan appeared larger than the haematoma, as seen on the CT scan. In addition, there was widespread poor retention of 99Tcm-HMPAO in the ipsilateral hemisphere. These differences were quantifiable. Interestingly, these differences were present at a time when the patients were clinically stable, before their deterioration. It is concluded that SPECT studies with 99Tcm-HMPAO are of possible use as predictors of late deterioration in the management of traumatic intracerebral haematomas.\r"

Warm and cool thresholds, temperature sensitivity limen (difference between warm and cold thresholds, TSL), and hot and cold pain thresholds were quantitated on the skin of the index finger, hand, foot and medial calf. The diabetic group had mean values that were significantly different from controls in all variables except the pain thresholds in the upper extremity. TSL was the most sensitive parameter, being abnormal in 57, 63, 79 and 78% of patients in the four skin sites tested. Hot pain sensitivity was abnormal in 37, 21, 39 and 26% of patients in the same sites. Thermal sensitivity abnormalities were more frequently observed than abnormalities in motor and sensory nerve conduction studies. Thermal tests correlated with the duration of the diabetes, although there were abnormalities at all stages of the disease. The results show that diabetic neuropathy has a variable presentation in different types of nerve fibres.\r"

An anatomical study showed changes of the relationship of the posterior interosseous nerve with its surrounding structures with pronation and supination of the forearm. On the basis of the clinical features, the anatomical studies and the response to a simple physiotherapeutic regime, it is suggested that prolonged pronation of the forearm may cause transient entrapment of the nerve.\r"

The results of an acoustic analysis of cerebellar voice tremor in a patient with hereditary ataxia and presenting with a purely cerebellar syndrome are reported. Analysis included computation of speech intensity contours, fundamental frequency contours, and spectral parameters from sustained productions of vowels and voiceless fricatives. Fundamental frequency contours during sustained phonation of vowels showed rhythmic oscillations at a rate of about 3 Hz. No concomitant periodicity could be detected for the parameters characterising voiceless fricative production. The results indicate an impairment of phonatory control in relation to the maintenance of a constant isometric activity of the internal laryngeal muscles. Cerebellar voice tremor may therefore be classified as a form of postural tremor.\r"

Bone was the most frequent site of metastases in adults (77%) and children (78%), followed by lymph nodes (33%) in both children and adults. Lung metastases were more common in adults (17%), but liver metastases occurred more frequently in children (15%). Possible routes of spread and development of metastases are discussed, with special emphasis on the role of shunts in tumour seeding. Distant extracranial metastatic spread of medulloblastoma occurs at the rate of 7.1%. Mean interval between operation of the primary tumour and the discovery of metastases was shorter in children (20 months) than in adults (36 months). Survival after the discovery of metastases was also shorter in children (5 months) than in adults (9.5 months). Shunts were associated with an earlier appearance of metastases and with a poorer prognosis. A detailed review of the literature of 119 cases of medulloblastoma with extracranial metastases is provided.\r"

To further characterize the nature of the reactive-like changes that were noted by light and electron microscopy following MTX exposure, the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) content of astrocytes in culture was investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, flow cytometry and double-immunofluorescent staining. An increase in GFAP content which did not correlate with drug dosage or DNA synthesis was noted in the MTX-treated cultures. It is postulated that this increase in GFAP content of astrocytes reflects an adaptive response to MTX-induced injury and partly explains the gliosis that is seen in methotrexate encephalopathy.\r"

After an interval of five to 12 weeks, the recovered rats were reinoculated by a different route and usually with a different adjuvant. The onset of the second attack was determined by the histologic detection of EAE lesions at intervals during the incubation period. In each of ten experiments, the second attack of EAE occurred one or two days earlier than in naive controls injected at the same time. Residual EAE lesions left over from the first attack could not explain the findings in the reinoculated rats. The accelerated response to the second inoculation may be related to the anamnestic response of classical immunology or to residual damage to the blood-brain barrier. Resistance to a second attack was not encountered in this histopathologic study.\r"

This observational study found that 1) age and sex were statistically significant factors in describing the incidence rates, whereas year group and geographic region were not; 2) no incidence peak in the third decade of life was observed; 3) a significant improvement in survival was observed in the combined 1978 to 1986 year groups relative to the 1973 to 1977 year group; 4) the overall 5-year survival probability was 45%; and 5) there has been an increase over time in the use of more than two modalities of treatment.\r"

Freezing lesions resulted in laminar necrosis of the infragranular layers and the subsequent migration of supragranular neurons through the region of damage. The result was most often a region of four-layered microgyric cortex consisting of a molecular layer, a thickened layer ii, a lamina dissecans (corresponding to the necrotized layers IV, V, and VIa), and a neuronal layer iv which corresponded to layer VIb of the intact cortex. Immunocytochemical investigation of the microgyric cortex with antibodies to neurofilament, glial fibrillary acidic protein and glutamate showed more widespread disruption of neocortical architecture than could be seen from Nissl preparations. In contrast, vasoactive intestinal peptide-containing neuronal bodies appeared to be distributed normally in the microgyric region although their processes were sometimes distorted. These results are considered in the light of previous research on induced microgyria, and possible implications for the behavioral consequences of focal, developmental neuropathologic lesions are discussed.\r"

Paraformaldehyde or formalin-alcohol-acetic acid fixation followed by protease treatment of paraffin-embedded sections provided the most satisfactory double-labeling. The results demonstrated GFAP-positive astrocytes and Tf-positive oligodendrocytes as two subpopulations of glia with no overlap. Our results suggest that, with some exceptions, immunocytochemical double labeling of GFAP and Tf has a potential application for the simultaneous identification of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the rat brain.\r"

A sensitive immunostaining kit in conjunction with rabbit antisera to human serum, albumin, immunoglobulins and complement component 3c was used to demonstrate specific immunoreactivity in paraffin-embedded sections. Most AIDS patients with CNS lesions had serum protein immunoreactivity in some neurons, glial cells (including astrocytes), gliomesenchymal cell nodules, vascular endothelial cells, inflammatory cells or microvascular walls. Cases with the most necrosis tended to have the least immunostaining. Immunoreactivity for IgG and fixed complement in anatomically intact or morphologically altered neural cells may indicate cellular lesions and potential cellular necrosis beyond the damage indicated by routine studies alone. Part of this immunoreactivity might represent a humoral autoimmune response.\r"

  ".W": "Human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) has been considered as an agent responsible for tropical spastic paraparesis and HTLV-I associated myelopathy. However, the pathogenesis of the diseases remains unclear. In a previous study we demonstrated that HTLV-I could infect adult human astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in vitro, although the rates of infected cells were low, at a rate of 0.1% and 0.01-0.05% respectively. Since mother-to-child transmission has been proposed as one of the major pathways for the prevalence of HTLV-I endemic, in the present study we investigated the susceptibility of human fetal astrocytes to HTLV-I in culture. After two days of co-culturing fetal brain cells with irradiated MT-2 cells (an HTLV-I-producing T-cell line), immunofluorescence staining revealed many positive astrocytes for HTLV-I p19 antigen. Multinucleated giant cells doubly immunoreactive to glial fibrillary acidic protein and HTLV-I antigen were frequently observed and showed a characteristic feature of hairy or fluffy external appearance. The percentage of infected astrocytes became as high as 19.4% at Day 21 of co-culture and then decreased. Electron microscopic examination revealed type C virus-like particles in astrocytes. These results indicate that human fetal astrocytes are more susceptible to HTLV-I infection than adult human astrocytes in tissue culture.\r"

The known risk factors for vascular disease--blood pressure, lipids, glucose, hematocrit, alcohol consumption and Body Mass Index were also measured. A moderate stenosis (diameter reduction 30-59%) of the internal carotid artery was found in 95 men (20%); 15 men (3%) had a greater than or equal to 60% stenosis of the internal carotid artery, while 7 (1.5%) had complete unilateral occlusion. Smoking was found to be significantly related to severe carotid artery disease. There was also a significant correlation between maximum flow velocity in the internal carotid artery and triglycerides. Those quitting smoking before the age of 50 had the same incidence of internal carotid artery disease as non-smokers, while those quitting later in life had a slightly higher incidence than life-long smokers.\r"

The relationship of self-reported physical activity and all cause and disease-specific mortality was examined by survival analysis and with the Cox proportional hazards model, controlling for demographic and lifestyle characteristics. Moderate activity was associated with a protective effect on cardiovascular and all cause mortality in both analyses. In the Cox model, age-specific estimates of relative risk (RR) were obtained for several endpoints due to a significant interaction between level of physical activity and attained age (age at death or end of follow-up). This model permits calculation of the age at which the RR = 1.0, or the age at crossover of risk. For moderate activity, this age was 95.6 years (95% confidence intervals, 81.7-109.4 years) for all cause mortality and 91.5 years (95% confidence intervals, 79.0-104.0 years) for cardiovascular mortality. While the protective effect on mortality associated with moderate activity decreased with increasing age, it remained significant to the verge of the present life span.\r"

The natural history of the disease is constructed using a four stage model characterized by a multivariate distribution for duration in each stage. Preserving its important features, we simplify the model to a function of two parameters; the average duration in stage I and the coefficient of variation of duration in each stage. A yearly screening program is superimposed using exponential CA 125 growth curves which result in stage-specific sensitivities corresponding to values reported in the literature. By implementing a computer simulation of the stochastic model, we estimate the benefit due to screening. This benefit is expressed as expected years of life saved per case of ovarian cancer. The model incorporates the stochastic nature of the disease process, allows easy analysis of repeated screens, and automatically accounts for correlation between subsequent tests. It provides the basis for planning optimal screening strategies with CA 125 testing.\r"

Data were collected in Nova Scotia, where extensive computer-based records of utilization of health services are kept, and the nine health care regions are in sufficient proximity to make visits and interviews feasible. Interviews with 9 x 25 = 225 randomly-selected family physicians, using scenarios analogous to ICD-9 codes, permitted testing of hypotheses about the effects of selected variables on referral rates for hypothetical cases. The family physicians' self-reported referral behavior for the written case scenarios was compared, region by region, with the actual referral of analogous cases by physicians in the same region, as determined from Nova Scotia Health Services and Insurance Commission records. The results indicated that written scenarios provide a useful tool for studies of such variables. Generally, the family physicians responded appropriately to the information that described the hypothetical patients (\"case cues\"). However, comparisons of hypothetical and actual referral rates indicated that appropriate information about the environment within which referral decisions take place (\"environmental cues\") may be needed to explain actual regional variations in referral rates.\r"

Among the patients aged 65 years or more, there were 2120 cases and 193 controls, while for the patients aged 35-49 years there were 1493 cases and 707 controls. Odds ratios obtained from logistic regression indicated that age, male sex, diabetes, cigarette smoking, hypertension, total cholesterol and left ventricular hypertrophy were all significant risk factors for CAD in both age groups, although the odds ratios tended to be somewhat lower in the elderly. Logistic regression analysis for gender subgroups generally revealed similar findings when compared with the combined (males + females) age groups, although power was limited for the subgroup of elderly males which had few controls. We conclude that most of the traditional cardiovascular risk factors which have been described as correlated with the presence of CAD in younger populations are also correlated with angiographically-proven CAD in older patients.\r"

Pregnancy weight gains were examined at 4-week intervals from 12 to 36 weeks' gestation, as well as total gain for gestation, in a cohort of over 2000 young pregnant women, aged less than or equal to 18 at entry to prenatal care. The effect of diet was studied in a 15% random sample of the cohort, using a 24-hour dietary recall obtained at entry to prenatal care (averaging 17 weeks' gestation). As early as 16 weeks' gestation, gains below the lower limit of a clinical standard were associated with a decrement in birth weight at delivery of more than -85 g (p less than 0.01), and after 24 weeks of approximately -180 g (p less than 0.001). After adjusting for potential confounding variables, teenagers who went on to develop inadequate total weight gain for gestation had consumed 1878 kcal vs 2232 for teenagers with adequate total gain (p less than 0.05). There were significant deficits in protein (p less than 0.05) and carbohydrate intake (p less than 0.05) associated with inadequate gain. However, there was no direct effect of nutrient intake on birth weight, LBW, or preterm delivery. This suggests that the relationship between nutrient intake during pregnancy and birth weight may be indirect and moderated by weight gain during pregnancy.\r"

In both the Dabao and placebo groups an increase in the amount of hair was observed; 133 and 109 hairs on a 5 cm2 marked area, a difference of 24 hairs (p = 0.03, one-sided). Participants as well as the panel reached a similar conclusion. Regarding cosmetic effect, 42% of the participants in the Dabao group and 37% in the placebo group reported positive results. The average panel score for the cosmetic result on a scale of -10 to +10 was 0.46 in the Dabao and 0.21 in the placebo group, a difference of 0.24 (p = 0.04, one-sided).

The objectives of regulatory agencies do not differ significantly from the major responsibilities of nursing administration. Despite similar accountabilities between the surveyor of the regulatory agency and the nurse administrator of an organization, there may be a great deal of anxiety and stress before an accreditation visit. A method of understanding the standards, developing tools to monitor compliance with the standards, educating staff regarding the standards, and assuring nursing practice is in compliance with the standards is presented. A mechanism for organizing materials and information for the survey that will be effective for ongoing monitoring of standards is also discussed.\r"

All invasive cancers were diagnosed correctly with frozen sections and confirmed with permanent sections. When hysterectomy immediately followed conization, no complications occurred, and no significant increase in blood loss was noted.

  ".W": "Chronic suppurative hidradenitis is a disease of the apocrine glands occurring predominantly in the axillae of the anogenital region. Treatment, to date, has been frustrating. Prolonged antibiotic therapy and multiple incisions and drainage have been the usual form of therapy, but those surgical procedures leave patients with ugly scars; retracted, hypertrophic skin edges; and pitted, indurated and disfiguring abscesses. The only successful treatment to date has been wide excision of the entire apocrine gland-bearing tissues, such as radical vulvectomy, which often necessitates grafts to cover the surgically exposed areas. That has left patients with unsatisfactorily functioning vaginas and a mutilated appearance. Recently we instituted the use of the CO2 laser to treat these patients with the goal of eradicating the suppurative sinus tracts and the infected apocrine glands without removing large volumes of adjacent, unaffected tissue. Over the past eight years we treated 11 patients who had extensive, chronic hidradenitis of the anogenital area with the CO2 laser. The use of laser therapy for these patients has produced effective and less-mutilating results. Such treatment has been a successful option for treating this debilitating disease.\r"

Five of the 30 (16.7%) were seropositive on both an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot test. The majority of the patients expressed concern about their HIV risk; 23 (74%) requested confidential testing. Of those tested, five (21.7%) were seropositive; three had traditional risk factors (intravenous drug abuse and/or sexual contacts at risk), and two denied traditional risk factors but reported nonintravenous cocaine use and multiple sexual partners. Of the seronegative women, 33% reported nonintravenous cocaine use (many with multiple sexual partners). Preventing the heterosexual spread of HIV into this vulnerable population is a formidable public health challenge.\r"

Ostensibly, those documents and a number of others promulgated by the two professional organizations enhance the safety of patient care. Knowledge of the documents is equally important to the obstetrician and the anesthesiologist since care rendered to the parturient by the two specialists is closely intertwined, and so are their respective fates in case of legal action.\r"

Specifically, we sought to evaluate whether consumption of \"junk foods\", chocolate, caffeine-free cola, fruit juices or alcoholic beverages might exert an effect on the premenstrual syndrome apart from any effects of daily consumption of beverages that are high in caffeine (caffeine-containing coffee, tea and colas). The study was based on 853 responses to a questionnaire probing menstrual and premenstrual health and certain daily dietary practices; it was mailed to female university students in Oregon. An analysis of the data revealed that the consumption of chocolate, but not of other junk foods, was related to the prevalence of the premenstrual syndrome among women with more severe premenstrual symptoms. Likewise, the consumption of alcoholic beverages (all alcoholic beverages and beer only) was related to the prevalence of the premenstrual syndrome among women with more severe symptoms, as were both fruit juice and caffeine-free soda. None of the associations was substantially altered when the daily consumption of beverages high in caffeine content was controlled for. Taken together, these data suggest that the consumption of foods and beverages that are high in sugar content or taste sweet is associated with prevalence of the premenstrual syndrome.\r"

From March 1988 through June 1989, 70 women had two consecutive smears reported as IA; all underwent colposcopy and cervical biopsy. In 58 patients (83%) the biopsies and smears obtained during colposcopy were negative for condyloma and/or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Ten patients (14%) had condylomas, and two (3%) had condylomas with CIN (one CIN I and one II). The initial IA smears from those 12 patients were reviewed retrospectively: 2 showed condylomas (they had been undercalled), 5 were \"suggestive of condyloma\" (the atypical cells were too few or poorly preserved for a definitive diagnosis), and 5 showed IA. None showed cytologic evidence of CIN, most probably because of sampling error. Our results suggest that colposcopy is warranted after two consecutive diagnoses of IA on cervical smears, considering that 17% of the patients in our study showed underlying intraepithelial lesions of the cervix.\r"

Fourteen percent of the patients demonstrated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), and 29% had condyloma without CIN. Both cervicography and the colposcopist's impression, though not ideal, were superior to a repeat smear, human papillomavirus typing or both.

  ".W": "A study was undertaken to evaluate the utility of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA screening and colposcopy in the management of women whose Papanicolaou smears demonstrated atypia less than dysplasia. Fifty patients whose initial Papanicolaou smears were interpreted as showing atypia less than dysplasia were evaluated for the presence of HPV 16 DNA in exfoliated cervicovaginal cells and for histologic findings on biopsy. Those 50 patients were compared to two groups of patients: one consisting of 124 patients with biopsy-documented cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and another of 112 patients with normal Papanicolaou smears. The presence of HPV 16 DNA was confirmed with Southern analysis in 46% of patients with atypical Papanicolaou smears, 46% with confirmed CIN and 11.6% with normal Papanicolaou smears. The 50 patients with atypical smears underwent colposcopically directed cervical biopsies, revealing the following results: 14 (28%) had normal histology, 29 (58%) had koilocytosis without dysplasia, and 7 (14%) had CIN. HPV 16 DNA was present in exfoliated cervicovaginal cells from a large percentage of patients from each category (50% of patients with normal histology, 41.2% with koilocytosis and 57% with CIN). HPV 16 DNA screening did not predict which patients with atypical smears had underlying CIN. Colposcopically directed biopsy remains the evaluation method of choice.\r"

  ".W": "A system for monitoring blood flow in femorodistal vein grafts with Doppler ultrasonography in the immediate postoperative period has been developed. Twenty-three grafts have been monitored for periods of up to 72 hours. Seventeen grafts have remained patent at minimum follow-up of 6 months, and six grafts occluded in the immediate postoperative period. Successful Doppler recordings were obtained in 16 successful and all failed grafts. Fast Fourier transform analysis of the Doppler signals was performed, and pulsatility index and time-averaged mean velocity were derived from the spectral information. Successful grafts displayed hyperemic flow with pulsatility index less than 2 and time-averaged mean velocity greater than 10 cm/sec. Failed grafts could be classified in two groups: those that occluded less than 24 hours after operation and those that occluded after 24 hours after operation. Short-term failure was categorized by highly pulsatile flow, with pulsatility index rising rapidly and time-averaged mean velocity falling correspondingly before actual cessation of flow. Delayed failure was less well defined but was suggested by failure to develop, or early deviation from, the hyperemic flow seen in successful grafts. Occlusion was heralded by development of the pulsatile pattern seen in the short-term failure group.\r"

  ".W": "Angiopeptin, a novel synthetic octapeptide, was evaluated as a new approach toward the inhibition of neointimal hyperplasia in vein grafts. Male New Zealand white rabbits (n = 22) underwent carotid artery interposition bypass grafting with autologous reversed jugular vein. Nine rabbits were in the treatment group, and 13 were in the control group. The treatment group received angiopeptin 20 micrograms/kg/day by subcutaneous injection beginning 1 day before operation and continuing for 3 weeks until they were killed. At death the vein grafts were fixed in situ with 10% buffered formalyn at 80 mm Hg perfusion pressure. Histologic sections through each vein graft were analyzed by computerized morphometric analysis for area of neointimal hyperplasia (mm2). Neointimal hyperplasia in the control animals was 0.080 + 0.017 mm2 (mean + SEM), whereas neointimal hyperplasia in the group treated with angiopeptin was 0.022 + 0.006 mm2 (mean + SEM) (p = 0.02). This is the first time that peptide inhibition of neointimal hyperplasia has been demonstrated in vein grafts and may have significant implications for future use in vascular surgery.\r"

  ".W": "The vascular endothelium is important in the modulation of vascular tone via production of endothelium-derived relaxing and contracting factors. The abdominal aortas of five groups of rabbits were subjected to varying lengths of ischemia (0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 hours), removed, sectioned into transverse rings, and placed in tissue baths containing Krebs' buffer at 37 degrees C and aerated with 95% O2/5% CO2. After equilibration the rings were tested for endothelium-dependent vasodilation with methacholine and nonendothelium-dependent vasodilation with nitroprusside. Endothelium-dependent relaxation as elicited by methacholine was impaired at 3 and 4 hours of ischemia but was not significantly different at 1 and 2 hours as compared to control, whereas endothelium-independent vasodilation remained normal throughout the different periods of ischemia. The addition of 1 x 10(-6) mol/L rabbit hemoglobin reduced the time needed to demonstrate significant impairment of endothelial function to 2 hours. Endothelium-independent vasodilation was not affected by hemoglobin. We conclude that hemoglobin exacerbates ischemia vascular dysfunction in the rabbit aorta.\r"

  ".U": "91186442\r", 
  ".W": "Approximately 25% of patients with stasis ulceration have normal or below normal ambulatory venous pressures. A reflux index was calculated by multiplying postexercise pressures by Valsalva-induced foot venous pressure elevation. In patients with stasis ulceration, reflux index was found to have an excellent negative predictive value with a clear discriminant line between normal limbs and those with ulcers. Increasing incidence of stasis ulceration was demonstrated with increasing reflux index value. Even when ambulatory venous pressure was within the normal range, the index was found to be abnormal in ulcerated limbs because Valsalva-induced foot venous pressure was elevated in these limbs. Conversely, some patients with stasis ulceration and normal Valsalva foot venous pressure elevation were found to have abnormal ambulatory venous pressure values, yielding an elevated reflux index. Preliminary analysis indicates that reflux index may be a better predictor of surgical outcome after valve reconstruction procedures than either ambulatory venous pressure or Valsalva-induced foot venous pressure elevation. The concept of reflux index is a hypothesis that attempts to explain inconsistencies observed in implicating ambulatory venous hypertension as the sole determinant of venous reflux.\r"
