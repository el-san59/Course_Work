  ".W": "Using immunohistochemical techniques, we have determined the localization and distribution of CRH immunoreactivity (CRH-IR) in the human placenta, fetal membranes, decidua, and umbilical cord. Tissues were obtained at 6-8 weeks of pregnancy, at term, in association with premature birth, and from patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension or diabetes mellitus. A polyclonal antibody to the epithelial cell marker cytokeratin was used to identify trophoblast cells. CRH-IR was not detected in placenta or decidua at 6-8 weeks gestation. In tissues obtained after idiopathic premature delivery after 21 weeks gestation, positive CRH staining was found in placenta in syncytiotrophoblast and intermediate trophoblast, but not cytotrophoblast. CRH-IR was present in intermediate trophoblast cells that had invaded maternal blood vessels in decidua basalis. In the fetal membranes, CRH-IR was localized in the epithelium and subepithelial cells of amnion, in the trophoblast layer, in some cells of the reticular and cellular layers of chorion, and in some stromal cells and invasive trophoblast cells of decidua. CRH-IR was found in the amniotic epithelium of the umbilical cord and in the musculature of the umbilical vessels. This pattern of distribution of CRH-IR was found in tissues from 21 weeks gestation to term and postterm, and was similar in tissues examined from patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension and diabetes mellitus. These results show clearly that in placenta and membranes, CRH is localized primarily to syncytiotrophoblast and intermediate trophoblast, but not to cytotrophoblast cells. We suggest that the localization of CRH-IR is consistent with CRH affecting paracrine/autocrine interactions within the placenta, fetal membranes, and decidua that may be involved in the maturation of the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and in the stimulus and maintainance of labor.\r"

Twenty six subjects completed 6 months of therapy with 100 mg/day CPA and 19 subjects completed 6 months of 100 mg/day spironolactone. All except 10 subjects received concomitant estrogen therapy. Measured objectively, total hair diameter fell by 17.1% with spironolactone (P less than 0.001), and by 16.8% with CPA (P less than 0.001). The diameter of the hair medulla fell by 17.8% with spironolactone (P less than 0.01), and by 31.7% with CPA (P less than 0.001). There was no difference between the drugs in their effect on hair diameter. Plasma testosterone levels also fell significantly with both drugs. As a subjective assessment of treatment efficacy, the frequency with which subjects performed cosmetic measures was recorded. This fell by 38% with spironolactone and by 44.7% with CPA (P less than 0.001 both drugs), and again there was no difference between the drugs. Side effects caused cessation of treatment in one subject taking CPA and two subjects taking spironolactone, and milder side effects were noted in two further subjects from each treatment group. We conclude that spironolactone and CPA, in the dosages used in this study, are effective and well tolerated agents for the treatment of hirsutism, and that neither drug demonstrates a particular advantage over the other.\r"

  ".U": "91217179\r", 
  ".W": "The decidualized endometrium during the first trimester of pregnancy synthesizes and secretes a 32-kDa insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (termed hIGFBP-1) at high levels. IGFBP-1 is the major soluble protein product of this tissue and is principally localized to the differentiated endometrial stromal cell, the decidual cell. In the present study long term culture of stromal cells from the nonpregnant endometrium have been employed to elucidate the hormonal requirements for IGFBP-1 production. Immunoreactive IGFBP-1 was undetectable in control cultures. However, inclusion of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) induced rates of 0.35 +/- 0.09 microgram/0.1 mg cell DNA.day (mean +/- SEM; n = 5) after 20-30 days. In these cultures cells exhibited morphological changes consistent with decidual cell differentiation. In all cultures removal of MPA after exposure for 10-16 days, with or without subsequent inclusion of relaxin (RLX), increased production of IGFBP-1 450- to 4600-fold to rates of 150-710 micrograms/0.1 mg cell DNA.day or 26-131 micrograms/10(6) cells.day on days 24-26. The rates tended to be higher with the inclusion of RLX and were sustained in contrast to cultures without RLX, where rates fell by day 30. Individual cultures responded differently to RLX when added from the initiation of culture, with either a response similar to MPA alone or a cyclical change in production, achieving maximal rates of 190-290 micrograms/0.1 mg cell DNA.day. Cultures in which RLX alone induced high IGFBP-1 high production were obtained from endometrium during the progesterone-dominated luteal phase. In cultures exhibiting high rates of immunoreactive IGFBP-1 production, the protein represented their major secretory protein product. This was confirmed by [35S]methionine incorporation and the presence of IGFBP-1 as the predominant protein in serum-free culture medium. The immunoreactive IGFBP-1 isolated from culture medium was found to be identical, by a number of criteria, with IGFBP-1 derived from decidual tissue. These results were consistent with a primary role of progestin exposure, whether in vivo or in vitro, in converting endometrial stromal cells to cells potentially able to exhibit the high rates of IGFBP-1 production typical of the decidualized endometrium of pregnancy.\r"

In phase 1, plasma CGRP concentrations were measured hourly for 24 h during normal activity; in phase 2, the CGRP response to diuretic-induced volume depletion and upright posture was measured over 3 h; in phase 3, the CGRP response to volume loading and supine posture was measured over 4 h. During phase 1, the mean 24-h plasma CGRP concentration averaged 30 +/- 16 pmol/L; hourly CGRP concentrations ranged from 25-37 pmol/L over 24 h and oscillated from 16% below to 27% above the mean 24-h CGRP value, changes that were highly significant (P = 0.005). The peaks were at 0600 and 0700 h, while the nadirs were at 1200 and 2000 h. No significant difference was found between fasting CGRP at 0800 h and levels taken 1, 2, and 3 h postprandially (P = 0.68). During phase 2 (volume depletion and upright) mean plasma CGRP rose significantly, going from a baseline of 42 +/- 8 pmol/L at 0800 h to a peak of 60 +/- 10 pmol/L at 1100 h (P = 0.0005). The percent CGRP increment was relatively small (26% to 42%) compared to the rise in PRA (518% to 1033%) and aldosterone concentrations (333% to 465%). Hematocrit increased from 40.5 +/- 0.7% to 45.8 +/- 0.7% (P = 0.0001) in phase 2, while serum osmolality did not change significantly. In phase 3 (volume loading and supine), plasma CGRP did not change significantly, while PRA and aldosterone concentrations fell significantly (P = 0.0001); neither serum osmolality nor hematocrit changed significantly. We conclude that plasma CGRP concentrations fluctuate spontaneously and significantly during the day, and rise in response to volume depletion. The reasons for the CGRP fluctuations seen over 24 h, which are not apparent from this study, may be related to changes in vascular volume or other as yet unidentified factors. These studies are consistent with the concept that CGRP, acting either directly or through the renin-aldosterone system, may have a role in regulating peripheral vascular tone or controlling vascular volume.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of hCG and pregnancy on the circulating levels of relaxin was investigated in 48 women undergoing in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (ET) for the treatment of infertility. Subjects were allocated randomly to receive hCG (Profasi; 2000 IU, im) or placebo on the day of ET (day 0) and on day 3 after ET (day 3). Samples of peripheral blood were taken on days -4, 6, and 10. An additional sample was taken on day 22 from women who became pregnant. The subjects were allocated retrospectively to 1 of 4 groups: no pregnancy, no hCG (NP); pregnancy, no hCG (P); no pregnancy, hCG (NPH); and pregnancy, hCG (PH). Two patients with blighted ova and one with a tubal pregnancy were excluded from the analysis. The concentrations of relaxin were similar and rose significantly in all groups at each time point (P less than 0.05). On day 6 there was no significant difference in the increment between the groups, but by day 10, circulating levels in the P compared to the NP and those in the PH compared to the NPH group were significantly greater (P less than 0.05). By day 22 the difference between the PH and the P groups was significant (P less than 0.05). Relaxin levels correlated with progesterone levels on day 10 in the NP and P groups (r = 0.633; P less than 0.05 and r = 0.697; P less than 0.05, respectively) and with estradiol levels in the P group only on days 6 and 22 (r = 0.659; P less than 0.05 and r = 0.783; P less than 0.05, respectively). These data demonstrate that in women undergoing in vitro fertilization, relaxin levels increase during the luteal phase, and in those women who establish a pregnancy, the values are significantly greater by day 10. The administration of hCG in the early luteal phase, before implantation, to women who subsequently become pregnant significantly increased the level of circulating relaxin on day 22. The positive correlation between relaxin levels and ovarian steroid levels in the groups not receiving exogenous hCG suggests that a common factor may control the release of both.\r"

Nine normal subjects and 10 nondiabetic acromegalic patients (5 of them with normal glucose tolerance) were studied after an overnight fast (12-14 h) and for 3 h after the ingestion of 75 g glucose. Peripheral glucose metabolism was analyzed by the forearm technique to estimate muscle exchange of substrate combined with indirect calorimetry. Decreased forearm glucose uptake was observed in the acromegalic patients compared to that in the normal subjects (380 +/- 84 vs. 709 +/- 56 mumol/100 mL forearm.3 h) with diminished nonoxidative glucose metabolism (262 +/- 81 vs. 572 +/- 53 mumol/100 mL forearm.3 h). The acromegalics with normal glucose tolerance also showed decreased forearm glucose uptake and nonoxidative glucose metabolism compared to normal subjects (271 +/- 124 vs. 709 +/- 56 and 133 +/- 110 vs. 572 +/- 53 mumol/100 mL forearm.3 h, respectively). Muscle glucose oxidation did not differ significantly in normal subjects, the entire group of acromegalic patients, and the acromegalics with normal glucose tolerance (137 +/- 18 vs. 118 +/- 22 vs. 138 +/- 34 mumol/100 mL forearm.3 h, respectively). Serum FFA levels and lipid oxidation rates were similar in the normal subjects and the acromegalic patients, and declined in a similar fashion after glucose ingestion. Insulin levels were significantly higher in acromegalic patients than in normal subjects before and after glucose loading. In conclusion, this study showed that the insulin resistance occurring in the presence of chronic GH excess is accompanied by impaired muscle glucose uptake and nonoxidative glucose metabolism, which are early derangements because they are also observed in acromegalic patients with normal glucose tolerance.\r"

  ".U": "91217186\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously shown that high dose cortisol (F; 240 mg/day)-induced Na+ retention and systolic blood pressure (BP) increases are not inhibited by the glucocorticoid (type II) receptor antagonist RU486. Adequacy of type II receptor blockade with RU486 was clearly demonstrated, indicating that the Na+ retention was not mediated through the glucocorticoid receptor. Spironolactone (Sp: 400 mg/day), in a preliminary assessment, also did not inhibit F-induced Na+ retention. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the Na+ retention produced by F administration is mediated by the type I receptor by comparing the effects of F to a potent type I agonist [9 alpha-fludrohydrocortisone (9 alpha FF)] with and without Sp administration. The effects of the two agonists and Sp on urinary K excretion and BP were also compared. Normal male volunteers, on a constant daily diet for 10 days, received either F (240 mg/day) or 9 alpha FF (3.0 mg/day) with or without Sp (400 mg/day) for the last 5 days. The mean cumulative reductions in Na+ excretion during the 5 days compared to baseline values before hormone administration were 255 +/- 38 and 494 +/- 81 mmol/5 days for F (n = 9) and 9 alpha FF (n = 5), respectively (P = 0.01). Sp (n = 5) completely inhibited 9 alpha FF-induced Na+ retention (494 +/- 81 vs. -37 +/- 130 mmol/5 days; P less than 0.01), but had no effect (n = 5) on F-induced Na+ retention (255 +/- 38 vs. 193 +/- 50 mmol/5 days; P = NS). After the expected first day kaliuresis, the effects of both steroids on net cumulative urinary K+ excretion were minimal. Systolic BP was increased by F, but not 9 alpha FF, and Sp did not inhibit this increase. A 2-fold greater Sp-inhibitable Na(+)-retaining effect of the mineralocorticoid demonstrates that the failure of Sp to block F-induced Na+ retention is not due to inadequate type I receptor blockade. Based on these findings and earlier studies, we conclude that high dose (stress level) F-induced Na+ retention and systolic BP increase are not mediated by either the mineralo- or glucocorticoid receptor in normal man.\r"

The middle-aged obese rhesus monkey is an animal model in which these defects can be separated in time during the development of diabetes. It is, therefore, a model system for examining the sequence of metabolic changes which occur before and after the onset of diabetes. This sequence of changes was used in the present study to determine if lipoprotein changes occur in association with the development of diabetes in the rhesus monkey. Increases in plasma triglyceride, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglyceride, and VLDL cholesterol, and decreases in high density lipoprotein cholesterol were observed across previously identified groups ranging from normal to diabetic. Plasma triglycerides increased from 0.54 +/- 0.09 (normal) to 1.27 +/- 0.50, 1.93 +/- 0.79, and 4.28 +/- 2.24 in three intermediate groups with progressive hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, to 7.59 +/- 2.73 mmol/L in the diabetic monkeys. Increases in VLDL triglyceride and VLDL cholesterol paralleled the plasma triglyceride increases. High density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased across the groups from 2.33 +/- 0.16 (normal) to 1.72 +/- 0.20, 1.17 +/- 0.13, and 1.09 +/- 0.20 mmol/L in the intermediate groups, and was lowest in the diabetic monkeys, 1.00 +/- 0.21. The obese rhesus monkey can therefore be used to study lipoprotein abnormalities as they occur both before and in noninsulin-dependent diabetes.\r"

  ".U": "91217188\r", 
  ".W": "In previous work we reported that oxytocin activates phospholipase-C (PLC) and increases prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release in amnion. Whether either of the consequences of activation of PLC by oxytocin, activation of protein kinase-C (PKC) or increases in intracellular calcium, directly results in the production of PGE2 is unknown. Phorbol esters (PMA) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) are also known to increase PGE2 release from amnion. In some tissues these agents are capable of activating the PLC postreceptor cascade system. This study was undertaken primarily to explore the mechanism of oxytocin-induced PGE2 production in amnion and secondarily to determine whether common aspects of PGE2 production by oxytocin, PMA, and EGF include activation of PLC or subsequent steps in this cascade followed by new mRNA/protein production. Involvement of PLC was assessed by inositol phosphate (IP1) turnover. IP1 turnover was increased by oxytocin (2.99 +/- 0.31-fold; P less than 0.01), but not by EGF or PMA. PMA inhibited oxytocin-provoked IP1 turnover (P less than 0.05). PKC involvement was initially evaluated with two PKC inhibitors, H7 and staurosporine. Each inhibited PGE2 production by oxytocin as well as that by PMA and EGF in a dose-dependent fashion. With H7, the IC50 for all agents was 5 microM; the IC50 for staurosporine was 2 nM for PMA and oxytocin and 5 nM for EGF. Agonist-induced PGE2 production was also assessed in cells in which PKC activity had been tachyphylaxed with a high concentration of PMA (400 ng/mL for 48 h). In such cells oxytocin and PMA no longer stimulated (P less than 0.001) PGE2 production, but EGF-stimulated PGE2 production was only slightly reduced. PKC involvement is, thus, implicated for oxytocin and PMA. Other enzymes that are inhibited by H7 and staurosporine are implicated in the production of PGE2 caused by EGF. Although tachyphylaxed cells produced no PGE2 with oxytocin, oxytocin increased intracellular calcium to levels higher than those seen in control cells (435 +/- 102 vs. 286 +/- 1.2) Actinomycin-D (P less than 0.001) and cycloheximide (P less than 0.05) inhibited PGE2 production caused by oxytocin, PMA, and EGF. PGE2 production by oxytocin in human amnion cells proceeds by activation of PKC, followed by new protein and mRNA production. Further, in cells without PKC, oxytocin-induced calcium transients do not increase PGE2. The ability of EGF to stimulate PGE2 in cells with no PKC activity also establishes that PKC activation is not a common intracellular step in the induction of PGE2 production by all agents.\r"

Both blood and follicular fluid samples were analyzed for radioactivity as DS, dehydroepiandrosterone (D), androstenedione (delta 4A). T, and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and the blood was also analyzed for the concentration of nonisotopic DS by RIA. In other subjects the concentrations of D and DS were measured in paired samples of blood and follicular fluid. From these data, values of 13.6 +/- 0.69 L/day four (mean +/- SE; n = 4) for MCRDS, 607 +/- 90 L/day (n = 3) for MCRT, and 0.0190 +/- 0.0089 (n = 3) for [p]DS-T (fraction of plasma DS metabolized to plasma T) were obtained.

Comparison of these data to known follicular fluid steroid concentrations shows that DS from the intravascular pool can be used as an ovarian prehormone.\r"

Purified immunoglobulin G (IgG) containing potent thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin bioactivity competed for radiolabeled TSH binding to recombinant TSH receptor in parallel to inhibition by unlabeled TSH. Using polyethylene glycol-prepared IgG, this assay discriminated very well between sera from normal individuals [TBI, 0.98 +/- 0.04 (+/- SD); range, 0.92-1.08; n = 35] and patients with untreated Graves' disease (TBI, 0.49 +/- 0.23; range, 0.06-0.98; n = 93). Only four of the sera from the untreated Graves' patients were TBI negative (greater than or equal to 0.92), providing a sensitivity of 96%. In sera from patients with Graves' disease receiving antithyroid drug therapy, TBI was 0.63 +/- 0.18 (range, 0.19-0.97; n = 75). In this group of treated patients, 2 of 75 were TBI negative. Four of 12 patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (33%) were positive for TBI activity. All 18 patients with nonautoimmune thyroid diseases (toxic nodular goiter, single toxic adenoma, subacute thyroiditis, or thyroid cancer) were TBI negative. Correlation of the TBI values with thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin bioactivity revealed a generally positive correlation (r = 0.31; P less than 0.05); however, there were many discrepancies among individual sera. TSI bioactivity was undetectable in all 4 patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis who were TBI positive. These data indicate that the recombinant TSH receptor in Chinese hamster ovary cells is a suitable system for detecting TBI activity in the sera of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease.\r"

We describe the youngest individual so far reported with this condition, a 22 month child with a large hyperfunctioning thyroid nodule who became overtly hyperthyroid after iodinated contrast administration. The histology of the nodule was compatible with follicular cell hyperplasia. These tumors are often called toxic adenomas, although there is no solid evidence that they are true neoplasms. We examined the clonal composition of the child's thyroid tumor by X-chromosome inactivation analysis, taking advantage of a polymorphism in the X-chromosome gene phosphoglycerate kinase. The tumor consisted of an even mixture of cells containing activated paternal and maternal PGK alleles, indicating that the tumor was polyclonal. Furthermore, the nodule had no structural rearrangements or activating point mutations of ras oncogenes, which are found in up to 50% of solitary monoclonal follicular adenomas. Solitary hot nodules may at least in some cases be secondary to hyperplasia, and not to clonal expansion of an abnormal, mutated cell. This may also explain the relatively low frequency of malignant transformation observed in hyperfunctioning thyroid tumors.\r"

The mean (+/- SEM; femtomoles per mL) serum concentration of TNF alpha was 45 +/- 4.3 in normal subjects, 84 +/- 38 in NTI, 54 +/- 6.0 in hyperthyroidism, and 50 +/- 10 in hypothyroidism; the various values did not differ significantly from one another. Serum TNF alpha was well within the normal range in all NTI patients, except one patient with a brain glioma and infection in whom it was elevated (540 fmol/mL). There was no significant correlation between serum TNF alpha and serum T4, T3, or rT3 levels in NTI patients. Similarly, there was no correlation between serum TNF alpha and serum thyroid hormone (T3 or T4) levels when data in normal subjects were combined with those in NTI patients. The dialyzable fraction of T3 and the free T3 concentration did not correlate with serum TNF alpha levels. However, there was a tendency toward a positive correlation between dialyzable fraction of T4 and the serum concentration of TNF alpha in NTI (r = 0.54; n = 11; 0.05 greater than P less than 0.1). The relationship between these two parameters became more clear when data in normal subjects and NTI patients were combined for statistical analysis (r = 0.59; n = 22; P less than 0.005). The free T4 concentration correlated positively with serum TNF alpha levels whether the data in NTI patients were analyzed alone (r = 0.93; P less than 0.001) or in combination with data from normal subjects (r = 0.85; P less than 0.001). Our data suggest that circulating TNF alpha may contribute to elevated free T4 in NTI. However, it is not a universal or common factor in the pathogenesis of other alterations in serum thyroid hormone levels in NTI (euthyroid sickness syndrome).\r"

Previous studies have suggested that specific IGF-I receptors are present on peripheral blood leukocytes, including polymorphonuclear leukocytes, lymphocytes, and monocytes. We sought to determine what type of IGF receptor was present on peripheral blood mononuclear cells and which types of cells possessed these receptors. Binding of [125I]IGF-I to mononuclear cells was inhibited by both unlabeled IGF-I and insulin, insulin being 200-fold less potent than IGF-I. Covalent affinity labeling with [125I]IGF-I, followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography, revealed a specific binding species with an apparent mol wt of 130 kDa. Two color flow cytometric analysis of mononuclear cells stained with mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for the human IGF-I receptor, the human insulin receptor, and monoclonal antibodies directed against specific monocyte and lymphocyte subset cell surface antigens revealed that both IGF-I receptors and insulin receptors were present on nearly all monocytes and B-lymphocytes, but were present on only 2% of T-lymphocytes. We conclude from these data that among human peripheral blood nonactivated mononuclear cells, IGF-I binds to specific type I IGF receptors found predominantly on monocytes and B-lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "A cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonist, loxiglumide, was used to investigate the potential regulating role of CCK in the entero-insular axis in humans. Ingestion of a mixed liquid meal stimulated plasma CCK, insulin, and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) release in the control experiment. With iv loxiglumide (22 mumol/kg.h), mean plasma insulin and glucose levels did not differ between placebo and loxiglumide treatment. The area under the plasma concentration for PP was reduced to 6,060 +/- 1,706 (P less than 0.05) compared to that during placebo treatment (12,266 +/- 4,748). Administration of loxiglumide failed to change insulin secretion in response to perfusion of the same meal or perfusion of a 10-amino acid solution into the duodenum. However, PP secretion in response to the intraduodenal meal or amino acid mixture was abolished after loxiglumide (P less than 0.05). Intravenous administration of the 10-amino acid mixture stimulated insulin from a mean basal level of 7 +/- 3 microU/mL to a peak level of 16 +/- 4 microU/mL. Infusion of a CCK octapeptide (CCK-8) at 8.6 pmol/kg.h, which produced a plasma concentration of 3.3 pmol/L, which is within the postprandial range, augmented amino acid-stimulated insulin and PP output (P less than 0.05). When CCK-8 was infused with loxiglumide, the insulin and PP responses were similar to the values found with loxiglumide alone. We conclude that CCK receptor blockade with iv loxiglumide does not affect postprandial insulin secretion. CCK is, therefore, not a major incretin. However, it is involved in the postprandial PP response, especially during the intestinal phase stimulation. These data suggest that CCK has a role in the human enteroinsular axis.\r"

To further elucidate the magnitude and mechanism of these abnormalities in humans treated with foscarnet for opportunistic herpes virus infections, we analyzed anaerobic serum specimens and 24-h urine samples before and after single and multiple doses of iv foscarnet and performed a series of in vitro experiments with normal human serum and plasma. Plasma ionized calcium concentrations acutely decreased by a mean 0.17 mmol/L in the 6 individuals who received a 90 mg/kg dose of foscarnet and by a mean 0.28 mmol/L in the 11 individuals who received a 120 mg/kg dose (P = 0.016, 90 vs. 120 mg/kg dose). Results of in vitro experiments showed a highly significant inverse linear relationship between foscarnet and ionized calcium concentrations, but no correlation between foscarnet and total calcium or phosphate concentration. Dialysis experiments suggested that the complexing of foscarnet with ionized calcium could be a cause of this ionized hypocalcemia. Physicians must be aware of this phenomenon and should measure serum ionized calcium during foscarnet therapy (preferably at the end of a foscarnet infusion) whenever neurological or cardiological abnormalities occur.\r"

We also investigated serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels before and during CV 205-502 therapy. In 12 macroprolactinoma patients followed for 1 yr, 0.075-0.450 mg CV 205-502 lowered PRL levels by 91.2 +/- 5.4%. Only 3 of the patients had transient side-effects of nausea, dizziness, or fatigue. In eight patients with PRL-secreting tumors who were bromocriptine intolerant, CV 205-502 (0.075-0.300 mg daily) lowered PRL levels by 80.2 +/- 6.3%. Four of these patients showed transient side-effects (nausea, fatigue, and/or tachycardia). None of the patients discontinued therapy. There was a close correlation between pretreatment circulating PRL levels and tumor size, expressed in cubic millimeters. The decrease in pituitary tumor size after 52 weeks of CV 205-502 therapy (-74 +/- 6%) was also correlated with the decrease in PRL levels (P less than 0.01). In four patients with hypopituitarism, lowered IGF-I levels did not change during CV 205-502 therapy. However, in seven previously untreated patients with macroprolactinoma and normal CV 205-502 is a potent dopaminergic drug, which effectively controls PRL secretion and induces tumor shrinkage. At the doses used in our study, it causes only mild and transient side-effects in a minority of patients and can also be used to treat hyperprolactinemic patients who have shown intolerance to bromocriptine therapy.\r"

All subjects received a total metGH dose of 0.3 mg/kg.week by sc administration, but were randomized to receive the drug daily (D; n = 12; dose, 0.043 mg/kg) or three times per week (TIW; n = 8; dose, 0.1 mg/kg). After drug administration, repeated blood samples (n = 14) were obtained over a 10-h period. Concentrations of metGH from each sample were determined using a monoclonal antibody radiometric assay (range of linearity, 0.5-40.0 ng/ml; coefficient of variation, less than 4%). Plasma concentration vs. time data were curve fit using a nonlinear weighted least squares algorithm which permitted calculation of the following PK parameters (mean +/- SEM; FD vs. MD group): elimination rate constant (0.23 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.25 +/- 0.04 h-1), absorption rate constant (0.43 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.48 +/- 0.04 h-1), elimination half-life (t1/2; 3.01 vs. 2.77 h), total plasma clearance (CL/F; 0.32 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.54 +/- 0.09 L/h.kg), and apparent volume of distribution (VDss/F; 2.2 +/- 0.14 vs. 3.15 +/- 0.28 L/kg). Both the CL/F and VDss/F of metGH were significantly greater when data from the entire study population were compared on the basis of FD vs. MD administration. With the exception of a larger VDss/F in subjects who received daily (3.6 +/- 0.4 L/kg) vs. TIW metGH (2.4 +/- 0.2 L/kg), no significant differences were found for the PK parameters between the D and TIW dosing groups. In all subjects, absorption of metGH was slow, with an average time to reach maximum concentration (Tmax) of 4.4 h and an absorption t1/2 that ranged from 1.4-1.8 h. Proportionality was also found between the dose and the area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve, suggesting dose-independent PK of metGH. Our data demonstrate that the PK of metGH after sc administration to children are markedly different from those previously reported in adults and, also, do not vary as a consequence of dosing schedule (i.e. D vs. TIW). The apparent increase in CL/F and VDss/F for met GH with multiple dosing may reflect concentration-dependent changes in plasma binding of the drug or, alternatively, represent the effect of increased body mass on the pharmacokinetics of GH.\r"

In addition, the age dependence of the mineral content was assessed by regression analysis from each subdivision. The results demonstrated a nonhomogenous distribution of mineral density within the trabecular bone. The lateral and anterolateral subcortical regions show significantly lower mineral density than the posterolateral or anterior subcortical domains. Moreover, with increasing age, bone density was also lost in a nonuniform fashion. Finally, the analysis of regional intervertebral change for the L1-L3 vertebrae revealed a nonhomogeneous pattern of mineral distribution.\r"

Recently, an independent committee appointed by The National Institutes of Health examined the available data and concluded that \"The evidence clearly indicates that the overall composition and nutritional quality of milk and meat from bGH-treated cows is equal to that from untreated cows\". Similarly, the FDA has concluded that the use of bGH presents no increased health risk to consumers. In addition, there is compelling evidence to indicate that GH poses no increased health risk to the target animal. Thus, GH treatment of farm animals is not only an effective technology for increasing productive efficiency but one that poses no increased health risk for either the consumer or the target animal.\r"

The 38-amino acid peptide shows a close sequence homology to vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). Binding sites for PACAP in membranes from postmortem human brain tissue were studied using [125I]PACAP27 as the radioligand. High specific binding sites (amount of specific binding measured at 0.25 nM [125I]PACAP27 in femtomoles per mg protein +/- SEM; n = 4) were present in hypothalamus (344.5 +/- 13.0), brain stem (343.0 +/- 29.3), cerebellum (292.0 +/- 21.1), cortex (259.6 +/- 19.8), and basal ganglia (259.2 +/- 50.3). Specific binding sites in pituitary, although present, were less abundant (35.0 +/- 8.9). Binding of [125I]PACAP27 was reversible and time, pH, and temperature dependent. Despite the homology with VIP, VIP was a poor inhibitor of [125I]PACAP27 binding (IC50, greater than 1 microM) compared with PACAP27 (IC50, 0.5-1.3 nM) and PACAP38 (IC50, 0.2-1.3 nM). Scatchard plots of [125I]PACAP27 binding showed the presence of both high and lower affinity sites. Chemical cross-linking of PACAP-binding sites revealed that [125I]PACAP27 was bound to polypeptide chains of 67,000 and 48,000 mol wt. Thus, we have demonstrated the presence of PACAP-specific receptors in human brain which are not VIP receptors. This opens the possibility of PACAP functioning as a novel neurotransmitter/neuromodulator in human brain.\r"

Because of potential bias in this study which was carried out in families with autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), the inheritance of thyroid autoantibodies has been evaluated in 49 families unselected for autoimmune thyroid disease. Among these families (24 with facioscapulohumeral disease, 10 with Friedreich's ataxia, and 15 with schizophrenia) the prevalences of TPO Ab and Tg Ab were 27.8% and 26.7%, respectively, in women and 9.2% and 11.7%, respectively, in men. In 40 families where one or more individual had TPO Ab and/or Tg Ab, segregation analysis showed that the tendency to make antibodies was consistent with a Mendelian dominant trait in women but not in men. In young women, however, the prevalence of both TPO Ab and Tg Ab increased with age, rising from 14% and 10%, respectively, at age 15-24 to 35% and 40% at age 35-44. As this is inconsistent with a simple dominant hypothesis, a further segregation analysis by age was carried out in the families unselected for thyroid disease together with 16 pedigrees with AITD previously studied and two additional large AITD families. The results of the combined analysis provided strong support for the hypothesis of dominant inheritance but also showed significant reduction in gene expression among women aged 15-24 yr.\r"

The subjects were grouped by age in consecutive intervals of 6 months each, and pubertal development was determined in every subject. TSH showed a significant increase, reaching a peak in the 9- to 9.5-yr interval. The same was found for T3 and T4, which reached a peak by 10 and 11 yr. The T4/T3 ratio did not show any significant variation with age. After 9.5 yr, a decrease in rT3 and increase in the T4/rT3 ratio was found. The TSH peak preceded the onset of clinical pubertal development, while the T3 and T4 peaks coincided with this onset. The variations in rT3 suggest an increase of peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. These transient events, not described until now, could be termed thyroidarche and could have a significant effect on pubertal growth and development.\r"

  ".W": "Luteal phase deficiency (LPD) as a clinical infertility problem is considered to have a heterogeneous etiology. Hyperprolactinemia has long been considered a causative factor of LPD. In this context we investigated PRL secretion in 18 women with LPD. All of the subjects were infertile with 2 out of phase (greater than 2 days) endometrial biopsies; 10 of the women also had daily blood samples, this latter subgroup had significantly decreased integrated luteal phase progesterone (P) levels compared to normal women with in-phase biopsies. PRL secretion was investigated as follows: 1) daily blood levels; 2) pulsatile secretion patterns in 3 cycle phase [early follicular (12 h); late follicular (12 h); midluteal (24 h)], 3) LH-PRL coupling, and 4) nocturnal patterns. Results were compared to findings in 36 normal women. The mean daily levels of PRL over the menstrual cycle were not different between the two groups (LPD, 12.1 +/- 1.5; normal, 13.8 +/- 0.8 microgram/L; P = 0.3). There was no correlation between luteal phase integrated P and PRL levels for either group. There was a small difference in the PRL pulse amplitude in the early follicular phase between the LPD and normal women (2.6 +/- 0.3 vs. 5.5 +/- 1.3 micrograms/L; P less than 0.05). There were no significant differences between groups in PRL pulse frequency or mean level during the 12 or 24 h in any cycle phase. There was an equivalent amount of LH-PRL pulse coupling in both groups in all three cycle phases. Diurnal and nocturnal PRL secretion was studied by breaking the 24 h data (midluteal) into day (0700-2300 h) and night (2300-0700) segments. Mean PRL levels were higher at night in both groups (LPD, 15.9 vs. 12.6; normal, 15.4 vs. 9.3 micrograms/L; P less than 0.05), as expected. There were no differences in nocturnal PRL secretory patterns between the two groups. In summary, we have serious reservations whether abnormalities in PRL secretion are a common or integral part of the pathophysiology of LPD. From previous work we know these subtle abnormalities in PRL secretion in LPD are associated with definite abnormalities in gonadotropin secretion. We believe these gonadotropin abnormalities are probably more significant in terms of decreased P secretion.\r"

In the present study, unidirectional Cl- gradients were established in short-term cultured rat hepatocytes and their effect on BSP uptake was determined. These investigations revealed that BSP uptake requires external Cl- and is not stimulated by unidirectional Cl- gradients, suggesting that BSP transport is not coupled to Cl- transport. In contrast, BSP transport is stimulated by an inside-to-outside OH- gradient, consistent with OH- exchange or H+ cotransport. As the presence of Cl- is essential for but not directly coupled to BSP transport, binding of 35S-BSP to hepatocytes was determined at 4 degrees C. This revealed an approximately 10-fold higher affinity of cells for BSP in the presence as compared to the absence of Cl- (Ka = 3.2 +/- 0.8 vs. 0.42 +/- 0.09 microM-1; P less than 0.02). Affinity of BSP for albumin was Cl(-)-independent, and was approximately 10% of its affinity for cells in the presence of Cl-. These results indicate that extracellular Cl- modulates the affinity of BSP for its hepatocyte transporter.\r"

After short-term culture pHi was measured with a single cell microfluorimetric set-up using the fluorescent pHi indicator BCECF, and calibrated with nigericin in high K+ concentration buffer. Major contaminants were identified using vital markers. In HCO3(-)-free media, baseline pHi (7.03 +/- 0.12) decreased by 0.45 +/- 0.18 pH units after Na+ removal and by 0.12 +/- .04 after amiloride administration (1 mM). After acid loading (20 mM NH4Cl) pHi recovery was inhibited by both Na+ removal and amiloride (JH+ = 0.74 +/- 1.1, and JH+ = 2.28 +/- 0.8, respectively, vs. 5.47 +/- 1.97 and 5.97 +/- 1.76 mM/min, in controls, respectively). In HCO3- containing media baseline pHi was higher (7.16 +/- 0.1, n = 36, P less than 0.05) and was decreased by Na+ substitution but not by amiloride. Na+ removal inhibited pHi recovery after an intracellular acid load (0.27 +/- 0.26, vs. 7.7 +/- 4.1 mM/min, in controls), whereas amiloride reduced JH+ only by 27%. pH recovery was inhibited by DIDS (0.5-1 mM), but not by Cl- depletion. Finally, acute Cl- removal increased pHi by 0.18 pH units in the absence but not presence of DIDS. These data indicate that BDE cells possess mechanisms for Na+/H+ exchange, Na+:HCO3- symport and Cl-/HCO3 exchange. Therefore BDE may be capable of transepithelial H+/HCO3- transport.\r"

Rats were fed a diet containing zero, minimal, or normal amounts of chloride, while drinking either water or a solution of 0.15 M sodium bicarbonate. Neither extracellular fluid volume contraction nor negative chloride balance ensued. Analysis of covariance with repeated measures demonstrated that dietary chloride, drinking sodium bicarbonate, and perfusion with either 45 mM or zero chloride, each have separate and significant modulating effects on distal tubule bicarbonate secretion. During mild alkalemia, there is modest bicarbonate secretion which is significantly different from zero (-9.9 +/- 3.2 pmol.min-1.mm-1, P less than 0.01), and which is suppressed after perfusion with zero chloride. In contrast, during more pronounced metabolic alkalosis after supplemental bicarbonate drinking, the bicarbonate secretory flux is brisk (-26 +/- 3 pmol.min-1.mm-1) and significantly different from zero and persists (-11 +/- 3 pmol.min-1.mm-1) even during perfusion with zero luminal chloride. Accordingly, in this two-day model of alkalosis induced by dietary chloride restriction, there is regulatory secretion of bicarbonate by distal tubules in vivo which is modulated by luminal chloride concentration.\r"

Monolayered cardiomyocytes were exposed to H2O2 and the effect on spontaneous beating and leakage of LDH was determined. Hydrogen peroxide irreversibly blocked rhythmic beating and resulted in a significant membrane injury as shown by release of LDH. The injury was prevented by catalase which removes H2O2 and by cell-permeable, metal-chelating agents such as desferrioxamine or bipyridine. In contrast, reagents which are excluded from the cell such as superoxide dismutase or DTPA did not protect the cells against H2O2. Five- and six-membered ring, stable nitroxide radicals which have previously been shown to chemically act as low-molecular weight, membrane-permeable, SOD-mimetic compounds provided full protection. The nitroxides prevented leakage of LDH and preserved normal cardiomyocyte contractility, presumably by intercepting intracellular O2-radicals. Alternatively, protection may result through nitroxides reacting with reduced transition metal ions or by detoxifying secondary organic radicals.\r"

  ".W": "We recently observed that specific antibodies to type II collagen do not bind in appreciable amounts to the intact surface of articular cartilage, whereas antibodies to the minor collagen types V, VI, and IX do. These results suggest that the outermost cartilage surface layer prevented interaction of the antibodies with the major collagen type in articular cartilage. The present studies were designed to investigate the pathogenic mechanisms involved in the disruption of the cartilage surface layer in inflammatory arthritis. Articular cartilage obtained from rabbits undergoing acute antigen-induced arthritis of 72 h duration showed a significant increase in binding of anti-type II antibody to cartilage surfaces compared with normal control cartilage (P less than 0.01). Augmentation of anti-type II binding was also observed upon in vitro incubation of bovine articular slices or intact rabbit patellar cartilage for 1 h with human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN), PMN lysates, or purified human PMN elastase. This increase was not inhibited by sodium azide, nor was it enhanced by incubation of cartilage with the strong oxidant hypochlorous acid. Chondrocyte-mediated matrix proteoglycan degradation in cartilage explants cultured in the presence of cytokines failed to increase antibody binding appreciably. The augmentation in antibody binding seen with PMN lysates was inhibited by the nonspecific serine-esterase inhibitor PMSF, but not by the divalent metal chelator EDTA. The elastase-specific inhibitor AAPVCMK also inhibited most of the PMN-induced increase in antibody binding, whereas the cathepsin G-specific inhibitor GLPCMK was much less effective. Incubation of intact cartilage with purified human PMN elastase indicated that this serine esterase could account for the increase in anti-type II collagen antibody binding to intact cartilage surfaces. These studies suggest that in an inflammatory response, PMN-derived elastase degrades the outer layer of articular cartilage, exposing epitopes on type II collagen. They also help clarify the pathogenic mechanisms involved in early articular cartilage damage in inflammatory joint diseases.\r"

The changes in arteriolar diameter after topical administration of recombinant TNF (rTNF; 10(-4)-10(4) ng/ml) were studied in second-, third-, and fourth-order arterioles (A2-A4) whose mean diameters under control conditions were 64.3, 30.7, and 14.8 microns respectively. rTNF induced a concentration-dependent vasodilation whose amplitude was largest for the smallest arterioles. At the highest concentration tested, arteriolar diameter increased by 21, 29, and 41% of control diameter for the A2, A3, and A4 arterioles, respectively. Indomethacin or mefenamic acid, two structurally different prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors, markedly inhibited the degree of vasodilation induced by rTNF in the three arteriolar orders. As regards the effect of rTNF on vasoconstriction in response to norepinephrine, vasoconstriction was greatest for the smallest arterioles, and did not change 10 min after rTNF administration for any of the three arteriolar orders. We conclude that (a) rTNF has a direct vasodilatory effect which is greatest in the smallest arterioles, (b) this vasodilation is at least partly mediated by prostaglandins, and (c) administration of rTNF in itself does not acutely alter the response of the arterioles to vasopressive drugs.\r"

Bronchial biopsies were obtained from 10 asthmatics and 9 nonatopic normal controls. A radio-labeled cRNA probe was prepared from an IL-5 cDNA and hybridized to permeabilized sections. These were washed extensively before processing for autoradiography. An IL-5-producing T cell clone derived from a patient with the hyper-IgE syndrome was used as a positive control. As a negative control, sections were also treated with a \"sense\" IL-5 probe. Specific hybridization signals for IL-5 mRNA were demonstrated within the bronchial mucosa in 6 out of the 10 asthmatic subjects. Cells exhibiting hybridization signals were located beneath the epithelial basement membrane. In contrast, there was no hybridization in the control group. No hybridization was observed with the sense probe. The six IL-5 mRNA-positive asthmatics tended to have more severe disease than the negative asthmatics, as assessed by symptoms and lung function, and showed a significant increase in the degree of infiltration of the bronchial mucosa by secreting (EG2+) eosinophils and activated (CD25+) T lymphocytes. Within the subjects who showed positive IL-5 mRNA, there was a correlation between IL-5 mRNA expression and the number of CD25+ and EG2+ cells and total eosinophil count. This study provides evidence for the cellular localization of IL-5 mRNA in the bronchial mucosa of asthmatics and supports the concept that this cytokine regulates eosinophil function in bronchial asthma.\r"

The purpose of this study was to characterize further the location, function, and regulation of Cl-/HCO3- exchange in two cell types using measurements of intracellular pH (pHi). In the principal cell there was no evidence for apical Cl-/HCO3- exchange, including no change in pHi with increases in luminal HCO3-. The principal cell possesses a basolateral Cl-/HCO3- exchanger that is inactive normally but stimulated by intracellular alkalosis. Decreased PCO2 results in increased pHi associated with activation of Cl-/HCO3- exchange and partial recovery of pHi. In contrast, the beta-intercalated cell possesses an apical Cl-/HCO3- exchanger and alkalinizes with increases in luminal HCO3-. Also in contrast to the principal cell, the beta-intercalated cell apical Cl-/HCO3- exchanger does not appear to be involved in pHi regulation and may be specifically modified for transcellular HCO3- transport. In conclusion, the separate Cl-/HCO3- exchangers in the principal cell and the beta-intercalated cell not only have opposite polarity but are regulated differently.\r"

In a group of 28 cynomolgus monkeys fed high fat, high cholesterol diets, plasma CETP concentration was strongly correlated with the abundance of CETP mRNA in liver and in adipose tissue, and with the output of CETP in liver perfusates. Plasma CETP concentration showed a strong inverse correlation with HDL cholesterol concentrations (r = -0.62, P less than 0.001) and a positive correlation with LDL cholesterol concentration (r = 0.54, P less than 0.005) and molecular weight (r = 0.57, P less than 0.001). The extent of coronary artery atherosclerosis was positively correlated with LDL cholesterol concentration and molecular weight, and with plasma CETP concentration. Thus, in monkeys fed an atherogenic diet, individual variation in CETP mRNA abundance in liver and adipose tissue probably plays a major role in the determination of plasma CETP levels. In plasma, CETP influences the distribution of cholesteryl esters between LDL and HDL, and CETP concentration appears to be a key determinant of the relative atherogenicity of the plasma lipoproteins.\r"

We used botulinum C2 toxin to perturb cellular actin and determined its effect on the permeability of endothelial cell monolayers derived from porcine pulmonary arteries. The substrate for botulinum C2 toxin is nonmuscle monomeric actin which becomes ADP-ribosylated. This modified actin cannot participate in actin polymerization and, in addition, acts as a capping protein. Exposure of endothelial cell monolayers to botulinum C2 toxin resulted in a dose- (3-100 ng/ml) and time-dependent (30-120 min) increase in the hydraulic conductivity and decrease in the selectivity of the cell monolayers. The effects of C2 toxin were accompanied by a time- and dose-dependent increase in ADP-ribosylatin of G-actin. G-Actin content increased and F-actin content decreased time- and dose-dependently in C2 toxin-treated endothelial cells. Phalloidin which stabilizes filamentous actin prevented the effects of botulinum C2 toxin on endothelial permeability. Botulinum C2 toxin induced interendothelial gaps. The effects occurred in the absence of overt cell damage and were not reversible within 2 h. The data suggest that the endothelial microfilament system is important for the regulation of endothelial permeability.\r"

  ".W": "The Capnocytophaga are inhabitants of the hypoxic human gingival crevice that are normally prevented by neutrophils from causing periodontal and systemic infection. To identify potential nonoxidative bactericidal mechanisms against Capnocytophaga within human neutrophils, gel filtration chromatography was used to fractionate neutrophil granule extracts. Seven granule fractions, designated A through G, were obtained. The Capnocytophaga were most sensitive to killing by fraction D. Fraction D exhibited substantial bactericidal activity under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The bactericidal activity associated with ion-exchange subfractions D8-D11, which contained primarily cathepsin G as assessed by enzymatic activity, amino acid composition, and NH2-terminal sequence. Heat-inactivation, diisopropylfluorophosphate, PMSF, and N-benzyloxycarbonylglycylleucylphenylalanyl-chloromethyl ketone inhibited bactericidal activity against Capnocytophaga sputigena but not Escherichia coli. We conclude that (a) human neutrophil cathepsin G is an important antimicrobial system against the Capnocytophaga, (b) the bactericidal activity of cathepsin G against Capnocytophaga is oxygen independent, and (c) an intact enzyme active site is involved in the killing of C. sputigena but not E. coli. We suggest that human neutrophil cathepsin G is an important antimicrobial system against certain oral bacteria and that cathepsin G kills bacteria by two distinct mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "Remodeling of myocyte interconnections may be an important determinant of ventricular tachycardia in regions bordering healed infarcts. We used quantitative electron microscopy to characterize the distribution of gap junctions in 10 canine left ventricles 3-10 wk after coronary occlusion. In three normal canine left ventricles analyzed ultrastructurally, myocardial gap junctions were distributed anisotropically; gap junction profile length was significantly greater in the transverse than in longitudinal planes of section. In infarct border zone tissues, the normal anisotropic distribution was completely abolished and fewer gap junctions per unit intercalated disk length were observed. Analysis of individual gap junction profile length distributions revealed selective disruption of the largest gap junctions that collectively comprised only 9.6% of total junction profiles, but encompassed nearly 40% of aggregate gap junction length in the transverse plane of section. Three-dimensional reconstructions of myocyte interconnections by high resolution quantitative light microscopy of serial sections demonstrated a reduction in the number of cells connected by intercalated disks to a single myocyte from 11.2 +/- 1.0 in normal myocardium to 6.5 +/- 1.3 in border zone tissues (P less than 0.001). Connections of cells in primarily side-to-side apposition were reduced by 75%, whereas primarily end-to-end connections were reduced by only 22% (P less than 0.05). These alterations would disproportionately enhance axial resistivity in the transverse direction, potentially contributing to development of reentrant arrhythmias.\r"

The VL gene segments used by these rheumatoid factors are not as restricted as previous work on mixed cryoglobulin rheumatoid factors had suggested. Each of the different VK families is represented and there are two examples where a V lambda gene segment is used. Molecules with structures similar to those of the Wa and Po CRI, characteristic of mixed cryoglobulin rheumatoid factors, are not common among these rheumatoid factors isolated from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. While there are clear examples of rheumatoid factors that are direct copies of germline genes, most of the sequence data suggest that the processes of antigenic selection and somatic mutation contribute significantly to the generation of monospecific rheumatoid factors in patients with autoimmune disease.\r"

Two reovirus isolates (type 1 Lang and type 3 Dearing) differ in their capacity to grow in cultured mouse heart cells. The mammalian reoviruses contain a genome of 10 double-stranded RNA gene segments. By the use of 37 reassortant viruses (consisting of viruses with different combinations of genes derived from the two parents), difference in capacity of different strains to grow in heart cells was mapped to three different genes, all of which encode viral core proteins: the M1 gene (P less than 0.000044); the L1 gene (P = 0.00094); and the L3 gene (P = 0.019). Using the same set of reassortant viruses, the L1 (P = 0.00015) and L3 (P = 0.0065) genes were involved in differences of the ability of viral strains to grow in mouse L cells (fibroblasts), but the M1 gene (P = 0.12) was not. These findings suggest that the M1 gene plays an important and specific role in determining the relative capacity of certain viral strains to grow in the heart. Thus, we have identified viral genes responsible for differing growth capacity in heart muscle cells in culture. These findings provide a novel system for studies of viral myocarditis at a molecular genetic level.\r"

The TSAb positive sera were obtained from 19 patients with Graves' disease. In 14 experiments with the slices system, TSH significantly increased cyclic AMP accumulation (TSH, 0.03-10 mU/ml) as well as the cyclic AMP-independent inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) generation (TSH, 1-10 mU/ml). In the same 14 experiments, TSAb (0.10-28 mg/ml) enhanced cyclic AMP intracellular levels as expected while they did not induce any InsP accumulation. Even when TSAb increased cyclic AMP levels to the same or higher values as those obtained with TSH concentrations allowing InsP3 generation. TSAb were still unable to activate the phosphatidylinositol-Ca2+ cascade. The patterns of the response curves of TSAb and TSH on cyclic AMP accumulation were different, suggesting that different mechanisms may be involved. In addition, unlike TSH, TSAb were not able to stimulate H2O2 generation, which in human tissue mainly depends on the activation of the phosphatidylinositol-Ca2+ cascade. Immunoglobulins from six additional Graves' patients lacking measurable cyclic AMP-stimulating activity in both slices and cells systems did not activate phospholipase C either. In conclusion, our results show that TSAb do not share all the metabolic actions of TSH on human thyroid tissue. The data provide support for the concept that the pathogenesis of Graves' disease can be fully accounted for by the ability of TSAb to stimulate adenylate cyclase. This work also confirms that TSH activates the cyclic AMP and the phosphatidylinositol cascade by independent pathways in the human thyroid.\r"

Aorta treated for 10 min with 4-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a protein kinase C activator, showed decreased relaxations to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator, acetylcholine, similar to normal aorta exposed to elevated glucose (22 and 44 mM) for 6 h. Relaxations to the receptor-independent endothelium-dependent vasodilator, A23187, and those caused by the direct smooth muscle vasodilator, sodium nitroprusside, were unaffected by treatment with PMA or exposure to elevated glucose. Indomethacin increased relaxations to acetylcholine of aorta treated with PMA indicating a role for vasoconstrictor prostanoids. PMA caused a significant increase in basal and acetylcholine-stimulated release of vasoconstrictor prostanoids including thromboxane A2 from aortic segments with, but not without endothelium. Protein kinase C inhibitors, H-7 or sphingosine, restored the abnormal acetylcholine-induced relaxations as well as suppressed the abnormal release of prostanoids in aorta exposed to elevated glucose. These findings suggest that the dysfunction of receptor-mediated endothelium-dependent relaxation associated with exposure to elevated glucose is due to increased production of vasoconstrictor prostanoids by the endothelium as a consequence of protein kinase C activation.\r"

  ".W": "Although endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) has been studied extensively in large vessels, little is known about its role in the preglomerular afferent arteriole (Af-Art). We tested the hypothesis that EDRF, which is produced locally in the Af-Art, modulates arteriolar responses to angiotensin II (AII). A single rabbit Af-Art with its glomerulus intact was microperfused in vitro at 60 mmHg. When 0.1 microM AII was first applied, luminal diameter decreased by 49 +/- 7.0% (n = 9; P less than 0.0001); however, constriction waned, with the decrease becoming 15 +/- 3.5% at 1 min. After washing the Af-Art, repeated AII caused less constriction (13 +/- 4.0%; P less than 0.0002 vs. first application), showing tachyphylaxis. Pretreatment with Nw-nitro-L-arginine (N-Arg), which inhibits synthesis of nitric oxide (an EDRF), decreased basal diameter by 18 +/- 3.0% (n = 14; P less than 0.0001). N-Arg also augmented AII-induced constriction (86 +/- 6.8%; P less than 0.02 vs. nontreated Af-Art) and rendered it persistent (82 +/- 6.9% at 1 min). Even after pretreatment with N-Arg, repeated AII caused a weaker response, which was restored by washing with kidney homogenate rich in angiotensinase. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that local production of EDRF is an important determinant of the tone of the Af-Art. Our results suggest that the transient nature of AII-induced constriction of the Af-Art may be due to production of EDRF, while tachyphylaxis may be the result of long lasting receptor occupancy.\r"

P450c11 is encoded by the CYP11B1 gene which is located on chromosome 8q22 along with a homologous gene of unknown function, CYP11B2. To identify mutations in CYP11B1 associated with 11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency in Moroccan Jews, oligonucleotides were used that selectively amplified portions of CYP11B1 in polymerase chain reactions without amplifying CYP11B2. Sequence analysis of amplified fragments from one patient revealed a single base substitution in exon 8, codon 448 from CGC (arginine) to CAC (histidine). This residue is within the \"heme binding\" peptide that contains a cysteine that is a ligand to the heme group. The equivalent of Arg-448 is found in every known eukaryotic P450, and therefore it seems likely that a mutation of this residue would adversely affect enzymatic activity. 11 of 12 affected alleles from six Moroccan Jewish families carried the mutation in codon 448. This mutation is not normally present in CYP11B2 and thus appears to have arisen in CYP11B1 as a true point mutation rather than a gene conversion.\r"

In animals treated topically with acetone, DNA synthesis is increased 102%, in tape-stripped animals 127%, in essential fatty acid deficient animals 50%, and in animals chronically treated with topical lovastatin 64%. This linkage between disturbances in barrier function and increased DNA synthesis is further supported by specific and correlative observations: (a) in these disparate models, artificial replacement of the barrier with a water-impermeable membrane inhibits the expected increase in DNA synthesis; (b) the extent of the burst in DNA synthesis is proportional to the degree of barrier abrogation; (c) the inhibition of DNA synthesis by membranes is directly related to the degree of permeability of these occlusive membranes, i.e., the more impermeable the greater the degree of inhibition; (d) topical treatment with lipids that restore barrier function corrects the increase in DNA synthesis; and (e) barrier abrogation with acetone produces an increase in epidermal DNA synthesis without altering bulk protein synthetic rates in contrast to events known to follow injury or cell replacement. Autoradiographic studies show that the increase in DNA synthesis after acetone treatment is limited to the epidermal basal layer. This constellation of findings strongly suggests that cutaneous barrier function is one factor that regulates epidermal DNA synthesis.\r"

IL-1 beta and TNF alpha induce fever, and elevated temperature may affect cytokine expression. Dexamethasone treatment improves outcome in bacterial meningitis possibly by inhibiting IL-1 beta and TNF alpha. In this report, the effects of elevated temperature and dexamethasone on LPS-stimulated IL-1 beta and TNF alpha mRNA gene expression and protein synthesis were studied in human astrocytoma cell lines and primary cultures of human fetal astrocytes. Cells cultured at 40 degrees C exhibited smaller peaks of IL-1 beta and TNF alpha transcription and protein synthesis compared with cells cultured at 37 degrees C. The addition of dexamethasone before, during, or after exposure of the cells to LPS resulted in temperature-dependent inhibition of IL-1 beta transcription and protein synthesis. The most extensive inhibition occurred in pretreated cells cultured at 37 degrees C. Cotreatment with LPS and dexamethasone also inhibited TNF alpha mRNA transcription at both temperatures. The effects of another antiinflammatory agent, indomethacin, on LPS induction of IL-1 beta and TNF alpha mRNA were temperature and cell line dependent. These findings provide a possible explanation for the efficacy of dexamethasone treatment of bacterial meningitis and support the proposal that fever may be beneficial to the host in this disease.\r"

Regional [11C]HED retention was compared to regional blood flow as assessed by rubidium-82. Transplant patients were divided into two groups. Group I had recent (less than 1 yr, 4.4 +/- 2.3 mo) surgery, while group II patients underwent cardiac transplantation more than 2 yr before imaging (3.5 +/- 1.3 yr). [11C]HED retention paralleled blood flow in normals, but was homogeneously reduced in group I. In contrast, group II patients revealed heterogeneous [11C]HED retention, with increased uptake in the proximal anterior and septal wall. Quantitative evaluation of [11C]HED retention revealed a 70% reduction in group I and 59% reduction in group II patients (P less than 0.001). In group II patients, [11C]HED retention reached 60% of normal in the proximal anterior wall.

In addition, the genetic loci for a number of familial tumor syndromes have been mapped by linkage analysis. To explore the possible role of tumor suppressor genes in endocrine tumors, we tested 41 pheochromocytomas (34 sporadic and 7 familial) and 11 medullary thyroid cancers (MTC) (10 sporadic and 1 familial) for LOH near a variety of potentially important genetic loci: (a) the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN 2A) locus on chromosome 10; (b) the von Hippel-Lindau locus on 3p; and (c) the p53 and neurofibromatosis 1 loci on 17. We also examined chromosomes 1p and 22q because previous studies in a small number of pheochromocytomas and MTCs suggested LOH in these regions. Background rates for LOH were assessed using several \"random\" probes. Finally, we examined a number of clinical and histologic characteristics of these tumors for possible correlations with specific genetic alterations. LOH in the region of the MEN 2A locus was uncommon (0% for MTCs, 5% for pheochromocytomas). However, we found significant allelic losses in pheochromocytomas on chromosomes 1p (42%), 3p (16%), 17p (24%), and 22q (31%). We also noted a correlation between LOH on 1p and urinary excretion of metanephrine by these patients (P = 0.02). LOH on 1p, 3p, and 17p also appeared to be associated with increased tumor volume. Analysis of the smaller number of MTCs demonstrated allelic losses on chromosomes 1p and 22q. Our results suggest that tumor formation and/or progression in pheochromocytomas and MTCs involves multiple genes, analogous with the model proposed for colon carcinoma.\r"

The basal rate of incorporation of [3H]myo-inositol and [3H]glycerol into phosphoinositides of aortae from pregnant rats in vitro was significantly reduced, when compared with vessels from virgin animals. After injection of [3H]myo-inositol intravenously into chronically instrumented conscious pregnant and virgin rats, the incorporation of the label by phosphatidylinositol was 66 +/- 4% less in aortae of gravid versus virgin animals (P less than 0.001), despite comparable plasma concentrations of radioactivity. Fold stimulation of total [3H]inositol phosphates by arginine vasopressin, norepinephrine, and angiotensin II over a 15-min period was not different between aortic segments from virgin and gravid rats, although both absolute basal and stimulated levels were significantly less in vessels from pregnant animals. After 45 s of incubation with 10(-7) M arginine vasopressin, however, the fold-stimulation of [3H]inositol trisplus tetrakisphosphate was reduced in aortae from gravid rats, when compared with vessels from virgin animals (P less than 0.005). By HPLC, greater than 90% of the radioactivity in the [3H]inositol trisplus tetrakisphosphate column fraction after 30 and 60 s of agonist stimulation was [3H]inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate. We further observed that the rate of uptake of [3H]myo-inositol by aortic vasculature obtained from gravid rats was significantly (24%) less than uptake by vessels from virgin animals. Plasma myo-inositol concentrations were not significantly different, but presumably as a consequence of reduced uptake, aortic segments freshly isolated from pregnant rats contained 22 +/- 6% less myo-inositol than vessels from virgin controls as measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (P less than 0.03). We conclude that myo-inositol uptake and content, phosphoinositide turnover, and inositol phosphate production are reduced in aortic vasculature of gravid rats.\r"

Apoptosis is an internally programmed cell death pathway that may regulate both T cell development and senescence, and that is characterized by cleavage of DNA at internucleosomal regions. The present experiments show that acute HIV-1 infection of MT2 lymphoblasts and activated normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells induces apoptosis. The addition of anti-gp120 neutralizing antibody, after HIV-1 infection of MT2 cells, permitted sustained high levels of viral replication, but blocked apoptosis and cell death. Apoptosis may account for the direct cytopathologic effects of HIV-1 in T cells.\r"

  ".W": "We report methods allowing the culture of rapidly dividing gastric epithelial cells to investigate the regulation of mucosal cell replication. Cells from canine fundic mucosa were dispersed by enzyme treatment, enriched by filtration and elutriation, and cultured on collagen gel in DMEM/F12 medium. After 48 h, greater than 95% of the cells displayed immunoreactivity with antibody to cytokeratin, an epithelial marker. The cells formed confluent monolayers by 72 h with a transmembrane resistance of 1,600 ohm.cm2 when mounted in a Ussing chamber indicating retention of epithelial cell characteristics. Calf serum (0.1-2%) produced a dose-dependent mitogenic effect evident by increases in [3H]-thymidine incorporation into acid-precipitated material and in cell number. After an 18-24-h incubation with [3H]-thymidine, approximately 55% of the cells cultured in 2% serum showed evidence of DNA synthesis by autoradiography and all of the replicating cells were cytokeratin positive. Using comparable culture conditions, a similar proportion of cells incubated for 18-24 h with bromodeoxyuridine displayed nuclear anti-bromodeoxyuridine immunoreactivity, thus indicating that over half of the cells in these cultures synthesized DNA during this period. As with serum, epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha) (10 pM to 1 nM), insulin (10 nM to 1 microM) and insulinlike growth factor-I (IGF-I, 1-100 nM) increased [3H]-thymidine uptake. The greater potency of IGF-I, compared to insulin, suggests the presence of IGF-I receptors. We conclude that this culture preparation is composed of fundic mucosal epithelial cells and contains a predominance of dividing epithelial cells. EGF/TGF alpha and IGF-I are potential factors directly regulating proliferation of fundic mucosal cells.\r"

  ".W": "Apolipoprotein C-III is a major protein constituent of triglyceride rich lipoproteins and HDL. It occurs in plasma in three isoforms differing by their sialic acid content. Apo C-III putatively inhibits lipolysis and the apo E mediated hepatic uptake of remnants from triglyceride rich particles. We identified a heterozygous carrier of an apolipoprotein C-III variant by the presence of additional bands after isoelectric focusing (IEF) of VLDL. Structural analysis of the variant protein by HPLC, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, and automated gas phase sequencing revealed a lysine to glutamic acid replacement in position 58. The underlying A to G exchange was verified by direct sequencing subsequent to amplification by polymerase chain reaction of exon 4 of the apo C-III gene. Family studies revealed vertical transmission of this defect. The two variant carriers exhibited plasma concentrations of HDL cholesterol and apo A-I above the 95th percentiles of sex matched controls whereas the unaffected father and sister showed normal values. The plasma concentrations of apo C-III in the two variant carriers were decreased by 30-40% compared with those of the two unaffected family members and to random controls. Using two-dimensional immunoelectrophoresis as well as IEF and subsequent scanning densitometry, we found that the low serum concentration of apo C-III was a consequence of diminished concentrations of the variant apo C-III isoproteins in both VLDL (15% of normal) and HDL (25% of normal). Apo C-III(Lys58----Glu) heterozygotes possessed unusual HDL as demonstrated by nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. They consisted mainly of HDL2b and contained a proportion of atypically large particles, enriched in apo E, with a Stokes diameter of 13-18 nm and resembling HDLc. In conclusion, heterozygosity for a structural apo C-III variant--apo C-III(Lys58----Glu)--was identified in two hyperalphalipoproteinemic subjects characterized by the presence of low plasma apo C-III concentrations and atypically large HDL.\r"

  ".W": "Glucocorticosteroids have an inhibitory effect on the expression of interleukin 2 (IL-2) and interleukin 2 receptor (IL-2R) genes. To determine the mechanisms of this inhibition, human T lymphocytes were stimulated with mitogens in the presence of dexamethasone. Nuclear transcription run-off assays showed that high doses of dexamethasone inhibited the transcription of the IL-2 gene but not that of the IL-2R gene. Post-transcriptionally, high doses of dexamethasone (10(-4) M) were required to inhibit IL-2R mRNA levels by 50%, whereas lower doses (10(-6) M) inhibited by greater than 70% the accumulation of IL-2 mRNA. IL-2 mRNA half-life decreased in the presence of dexamethasone (10(-6) M) by approximately 50%. At the protein product level, dexamethasone inhibited both IL-2 production, as well as cell surface and soluble forms of IL-2R. IL-2R gene expression was inhibited for at least 72 h after exposure of cells to dexamethasone. In the presence of exogenous IL-2, dexamethasone failed to exert a significant effect on the production of IL-2R protein. These data indicate that dexamethasone has a greater effect on the expression of the IL-2 gene than on the IL-2R gene. Dexamethasone both inhibits transcription of the IL-2 gene and decreases the stability of IL-2 mRNA. The effect of dexamethasone on the IL-2R gene is post-transcriptional and may result indirectly from decreased IL-2 production.\r"

The plasma lipoproteins of the affected subjects contained a unique species of apolipoprotein (apo) B, apo B67, in addition to the normal species, apo B100 and apo B48. The size of apo B67 and immunochemical studies with a panel of apo B-specific antibodies indicated that apo B67 was a truncated species of apo B that contained approximately the amino-terminal 3,000-3,100 amino acids of apo B100. Sequencing of genomic apo B clones revealed that affected family members were heterozygous for a mutant apo B allele containing a single nucleotide deletion in exon 26 (cDNA nucleotide 9327). This frameshift mutation is predicted to result in the synthesis of a truncated apo B containing 3,040 amino acids. Apo B67 is present in low levels in the plasma but is easily detectable within the very low density lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein fractions. Examination of the proband's immediate family revealed seven normolipidemic subjects and seven subjects with hypobetalipoproteinemia. In the affected subjects, the mean total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were 120 and 42 mg/dl, respectively. A significantly higher mean high density lipoprotein cholesterol level was found in the affected subjects (75 vs. 55 mg/dl). We hypothesize that the elevated high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in subjects heterozygous for the apo B67 mutation may be metabolically linked to the low levels of apo B-containing lipoproteins in their plasma.\r"

  ".W": "Diabetes was induced in rats by administration of a single i.p. injection of streptozotocin (50 mg/kg body wt). After 7 d, diabetic rats were further treated with insulin or 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [1,25(OH)2D3] for an additional 5-7 d. Control, diabetic, diabetic + insulin, and diabetic + 1,25(OH)2D3 rats were then killed, their proximal small intestines were removed, and villus-tip epithelial cells were isolated and used to prepare brush-border membrane vesicles. Preparations from each of these groups were then analyzed and compared with respect to their amiloride-sensitive, electroneutral Na(+)-H+ exchange activity, using 22Na uptake as well as acridine orange techniques. The results of these experiments demonstrated that (a) H+ gradient-dependent 22Na uptake as well as Na+ gradient-dependent transmembrane H+ fluxes were significantly increased in diabetic vesicles compared to their control counterparts, (b) kinetic studies demonstrated that this enhanced 22Na uptake in diabetes was a result of increased maximal velocity (Vmax) of this exchanger with no change in apparent affinity (Km) for Na+, (c) serum levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 were significantly lower in diabetic animals compared with their control counterparts; and (d) insulin or 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment restored the Vmax alterations to control values, without any significant changes in Km, concomitant with significantly increasing the serum levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 in diabetic animals. These results indicate that Na(+)-H+ activity is significantly increased in proximal small intestinal luminal membranes of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Moreover, alterations in the serum levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 may, at least in part, explain this enhanced antiporter activity and its correction by insulin.\r"

  ".W": "Medium from cocultures of human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) and smooth muscle cells (HASMC) taken from the same donor contained approximately two- to fourfold more macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and up to 5.1-fold more transforming growth factor beta than could be accounted for by the sum of the activities of media from equivalent numbers of HAEC and HASMC cultured separately. After pulse labeling, immunoprecipitated [35S]fibronectin and [14C]collagen were also found to be substantially increased in the coculture compared to the sum of HAEC and HASMC cultured separately. The cocultivation of HAEC and HASMC resulted in a 2.7-fold increase in connexin43 messenger RNA. When direct physical contact between HAEC and HASMC was prevented by a membrane that was permeable to medium, the levels of [35S]fibronectin and [14C]collagen in the coculture were significantly reduced. Monocytes cultured alone contained low levels of [35S]fibronectin and [14C]collagen but when added to the coculture there was up to a 22-fold increase in [35S]fibronectin and a 1.9-fold increase in [14C]collagen compared to the coculture alone. The increase in fibronectin was prevented in the presence of neutralizing antibody to interleukin 1 and antibody to interleukin 6 by 45% and 67%, respectively. Addition of monocytes to cocultures also induced the levels of mRNA for connexin43 by 2.8-fold. We conclude that the interaction of HAEC, HASMC, and monocytes in coculture can result in marked increases in the levels of several biologically important molecules and that increased gap junction formation between the cells and interleukins 1 and 6 may be partially responsible for these changes.\r"

In contrast, we have observed that AIDS monocytes express significant levels of a third Fc gamma R, Fc gamma RIII (CD16), which is normally associated with activation or maturation of the monocyte population. By dual-fluorescence analysis using a monoclonal antibody specific for Fc gamma RIII (MAb 3G8), 38.5 +/- 3.2% of the LeuM3 (CD14)-positive monocytes in AIDS patients were CD16 positive as compared to 10.4 +/- 1.0% for healthy individuals (n = 29; P less than 0.005). Furthermore, AIDS monocytes expressed Fc gamma RIII-specific mRNA which is expressed minimally or not at all in control monocytes. As a recently identified inducer of Fc gamma RIII expression on blood monocytes, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) was found to be elevated in the serum and/or plasma of AIDS patients. Moreover, incubation of normal monocytes with AIDS serum or plasma induced CD16 expression which correlated with serum TGF-beta levels (r = 0.74, P less than 0.001) and was inhibited with a neutralizing antibody to TGF-beta. Thus, the increased CD16 expression on peripheral blood monocytes in AIDS patients may be the consequence of elevated circulating levels of the polypeptide hormone TGF-beta.\r"

We hypothesized that heparin may inhibit vWF-dependent platelet hemostatic functions by directly binding vWF in solution and interfering with vWF-GpIb binding. Using the in vitro techniques of ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination, fluorescent flow cytometric measurement of vWF-platelet binding, and conventional radioligand binding assays we observed that heparin inhibited both vWF-dependent platelet function and vWF-platelet binding in a parallel and dose-dependent manner. Heparin also inhibited platelet agglutination induced by bovine vWF and inhibited the binding of human asialo-vWF to platelets in ristocetin-free systems. The inhibitory potency of heparin was not dependent upon its affinity for antithrombin III, but was molecular weight dependent: homogeneous preparations of lower molecular weight were less inhibitory. Heparin impairment of vWF function may explain why some hemorrhagic complications of heparin therapy are not predictable based on techniques for monitoring the conventional anticoagulant effects of heparin.\r"

However, there is presently no available information regarding the molecular mechanisms responsible for the regulation of cytokine gene expression by ionizing radiation. In this report, we describe the regulation of the TNF gene by ionizing radiation in human myeloid leukemia cells. The increase in TNF transcripts by x rays was both time- and dose-dependent as determined by Northern blot analysis. Similar findings were obtained in human peripheral blood monocytes. Transcriptional run-on analyses have demonstrated that ionizing radiation stimulates the rate of TNF gene transcription. Furthermore, induction of TNF mRNA was increased in the absence of protein synthesis. In contrast, ionizing radiation had little effect on the half-life of TNF transcripts. These findings indicate that the increase in TNF mRNA observed after irradiation is regulated by transcriptional mechanisms and suggest that production of this cytokine by myeloid cells may play a role in the pathophysiologic effects of ionizing radiation.\r"

  ".U": "91217260\r", 
  ".W": "In vivo microscopy was used to assess the relationships among shear rate (and shear stress), leukocyte rolling velocity, and leukocyte adherence in a cat mesentery preparation. Shear rate in individual venules and arterioles of 25-35 microns diameter were varied over a wide range by graded occlusion of an arterial loop. There was a linear decline in leukocyte rolling velocity (Vwbc) as red cell velocity (Vrbc) was reduced. The ratio Vwbc/Vrbc remained constant despite variations in shear stress from 5-25 dyn/cm2. A reduction in shear stress was associated with an increased leukocyte adherence, particularly when Vwbc was reduced below 50 microns/s. Reduction in wall shear rate below 500 s-1 in arterioles allowed 1-3 leukocytes to adhere per 100 microns length of vessel, while venules exposed to the same shear rates had 5-16 adherent leukocytes. In arterioles, leukocyte rolling was only observed at low shear rates. At shear rates less than 250 s-1 leukocyte rolling velocity was faster in arterioles than venules, and the ratio Vwbc/Vrbc for arterioles was 0.08 +/- 0.02, which was fourfold higher than the ratio obtained in venules at similar shear rates. Pretreatment with the CD18-specific antibody (mAb) IB4 increased leukocyte rolling velocity in venules by approximately 20 microns/s at red cell velocities below 2,000 microns/s. mAb IB4 largely prevented the leukocyte adherence to arterioles and venules, and increased the ratio Vwbc/Vrbc observed in venules at low shear elicit a CD18-dependent adhesive interaction between leukocytes and microvascular endothelium, and that differences in shear rates cannot explain the greater propensity for leukocyte rolling and adhesion in venules than arterioles.\r"

In 7 of 7 atopic patients but in only 1 of 4 apparently normal controls, allergen induced appearance of ELAM-1 on EC. ELAM-1 expression occurred concurrently with the development of inflammatory cell infiltrates by 3-4 h after intradermal injection. Saline injected sites in all subjects were negative. Skin organ cultures demonstrated that allergen could produce the same EC changes in vitro whether allergen was injected in vivo 20 min before culture or added during skin culture. These EC changes in organ culture were inhibited by the presence of combined anti-sera to both TNF-alpha and IL-1, but not by antisera to either cytokine alone. We conclude that EC activation occurs in elicited LPR and suggest that cytokine-induced EC activation may play a role in the migration of inflammatory cells into allergic skin reactions. Furthermore, resident cells in the skin rather than infiltrating leukocytes appear to be the source of the cytokines that mediate endothelial activation.\r"

  ".W": "Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activities in cytosolic, mitochondrial, and microsomal fractions of rat kidneys were characterized under control conditions, after ischemia, and subsequent to ischemia and reperfusion. Two forms of PLA2 activity were present in the cytosolic fraction: a high molecular weight form, active against phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), which upon purification has a molecular mass of 110 kD; and smaller form (Mr approximately 14 kD), active against PE. In mitochondrial and microsomal fractions a single form (Mr approximately 14 kD), active against both PC and PE, was dominant. Activities in each fraction were optimal at pH 8.5-9.5. Cytosolic PLA2 activity was enhanced when Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]) was increased over the range of 10(-7) to 10(-6) M. Mitochondrial PLA2 activity required higher [Ca2+] for activation (greater than 10(-6) M). After 45 min of ischemia cytosolic PLA2 activity was decreased, whereas mitochondrial and microsomal activities were increased. When ischemia was followed by 1 h of reperfusion, cytosolic, mitochondrial, and microsomal activities were enhanced. Ischemia alone did not change the gel filtration chromatography patterns of PLA2 activity, but ischemia and reperfusion resulted in the appearance of a new peak of activity in cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions (Mr approximately 2-3 kD). Thus, the rat kidney has multiple forms of PLA2 activity, likely representing distinct enzymes, with Ca2+ dependencies suggesting regulation by Ca2+ in vivo. Ischemia and reperfusion result in stable increases of PLA2 activity in each subcellular fraction, perhaps related to covalent modifications of PLA2's, which likely account for membrane phospholipid degradation, and increased tissue levels of unsaturated free fatty acids.\r"

  ".W": "We sought to determine whether systemic administration of proteases ameliorates membranous nephritis induced in rats by immunization and challenge with cationic bovine gamma globulin, and whether targeting of protease to glomerular capillaries increases efficacy. Proteases substituted with biotin were targeted via the cationic protein avidin A, which by virtue of its charge has affinity for the glomerular basement membrane. Despite identical pretreatment proteinuria, rats given untargeted protease (biotin-conjugated without avidin, or unconjugated plus avidin) had significantly less proteinuria than saline-treated controls and nephrotic rats given avidin plus biotin-conjugated (targeted) protease had even less proteinuria and reduced glomerular rat IgG and C3. Among more severely nephrotic rats, targeted protease was again more effective than untargeted protease at reducing proteinuria, and also decreased the size of electron-dense glomerular deposits, hypercholesterolemia, and creatininemia. Inactivated targeted proteases had no effect on proteinuria, hypercholesterolemia, or azotemia. Finally, active targeted protease did not affect proteinuria in the nonimmune mediated nephrosis induced by puromycin aminonucleoside. We conclude that systemic protease can specifically diminish glomerular immune deposits, proteinuria, hyperlipidemia, and creatininemia associated with experimental immune complex glomerulonephritis but not toxic nephrosis, and that targeted protease is more effective than untargeted protease.\r"

  ".W": "Normal structure and function of the lung parenchyma depend upon elastic fibers. Amorphous elastin is biochemically stable in vitro, and may provide a metabolically stable structural framework for the lung parenchyma. To test the metabolic stability of elastin in the normal human lung parenchyma, we have (a) estimated the time elapsed since the synthesis of the protein through measurement of aspartic acid racemization and (b) modeled the elastin turnover through measurement of the prevalence of nuclear weapons-related 14C. Elastin purified by a new technique from normal lung parenchyma was hydrolyzed; then the prevalences of D-aspartate and 14C were measured by gas chromatography and accelerator-mass spectrometry, respectively. D-aspartate increased linearly with age; Kasp (1.76 x 10(-3) yr(-1) was similar to that previously found for extraordinarily stable human tissues, indicating that the age of lung parenchymal elastin corresponded with the age of the subject. Radiocarbon prevalence data also were consistent with extraordinary metabolic stability of elastin; the calculated mean carbon residence time in elastin was 74 yr (95% confidence limits, 40-174 yr). These results indicate that airspace enlargement characteristic of \"aging lung\" is not associated with appreciable new synthesis of lung parenchymal elastin. The present study provides the first tissue-specific evaluation of turnover of an extracellular matrix component in humans and underscores the potential importance of elastin for maintenance of normal lung structure. Most importantly, the present work provides a foundation for strategies to directly evaluate extracellular matrix injury and repair in diseases of lung (especially pulmonary emphysema), vascular tissue, and skin.\r"

Their expression was correlated to the clinical behavior of 245 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas followed up for the median of 87 mo after the diagnosis. Lymphomas that showed no or weak staining intensity for HRs were more often of stage I (P = 0.005), disseminated less frequently hematogenously (P = 0.003), and had more favorable prognosis than lymphomas with intensive staining for HRs (P less than 0.0001) despite that they were more often histologically of high grade malignancy (P = 0.002). Expression of LFA-1 beta chain (CD18) did not correlate significantly with stage or survival, but had prognostic value in a subgroup of HR expression negative lymphomas (P = 0.03). HR staining intensity was an independent prognostic factor in a multivariate analysis. These findings indicate that Hermes/CD44 molecule is associated to the determination of the metastatic potential and prognosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. They also reveal a new entity among non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, because lymphomas that express low levels of HR have favorable prognosis despite their often highly malignant histological appearance.\r"

  ".U": "91217266\r", 
  ".W": "Direct measurement of de novo lipogenesis has not previously been possible in humans. We measured de novo hepatic lipogenesis in normal men by means of stable isotopes and by combining the acetylated-xenobiotic probe technique with mass isotopomer analysis of secreted very low density lipoprotein-fatty acids (VLDL-FA). Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) was administered with [13C]acetate during an overnight fast followed by refeeding with intravenous glucose (7-10 mg/kg of weight per min), oral Ensure (7-10 mg of carbohydrate/kg of weight per min), or a high-carbohydrate mixed-meal breakfast (3.5 g of carbohydrate/kg of weight). Respiratory quotients remained less than 1.0. High-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry-determined enrichments in SMX-acetate attained stable plateau values, and hepatic acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) dilution rate did not increase with refeeding (approximately 0.024 mmol/kg per min). The fraction of VLDL-palmitate derived from de novo lipogenesis was only 0.91 +/- 0.27% (fasted) and 1.64-1.97% (fed). For stearate, this was 0.37 +/- 0.08% and 0.47-0.64%. Precursor enrichments predicted from isotopomer ratios were close to measured SMX-acetate enrichments, indicating that SMX-acetate samples the true lipogenic acetyl-CoA pool. Stearate synthesis was less than palmitate and the two did not move in parallel. Estimated total VLDL-FA synthesis is less than 500 mg/day. Thus, de novo hepatic lipogenesis is a quantitatively minor pathway, consistent with gas exchange estimates; fatty acid futile cycling (oxidation/resynthesis) is not thermogenically significant; and synthesis rates of different nonessential fatty acids by human liver are not identical in nonoverfed normal men. The contribution and regulation of de novo lipogenesis in other settings can be studied using this technique.\r"

Using a primary rat hepatocyte bioassay, we have tested the biological activity of recombinant hHGF and compared it with native hHGF. Dose-response curves were almost identical, with half-maximal stimulation of DNA synthesis at 1-2 ng/ml (equivalent to approximately 10 pM). S-phase labeling index was similarly enhanced and numerous mitotic cells were observed. Recombinant and native hHGF also stimulated DNA synthesis and S-phase labeling index in primary adult human hepatocytes. Human cells were more responsive than rat hepatocytes, with recombinant hHGF slightly more potent than native hHGF (half-maximal stimulation 0.3 and 0.6 ng/ml, respectively). Since HGF levels rise in patients with fulminant hepatic failure and in animals after partial hepatectomy or administration of hepatotoxins, situations where liver regeneration occurs, HGF is suggested to play a key role in regulation of hepatic growth. The high potency of the factor on human hepatocytes reinforces its candidacy as a critical mitogen in human liver growth. The availability of a recombinant hHGF opens the way for in vivo experimental studies and to the possibility of using hHGF as a clinical therapeutic agent, either alone or in combination with other factors.\r"

To elucidate the role of copper metabolism in the development of the hepatitis in LEC rats, we examined the copper concentration in the tissues and serum levels of copper and ceruloplasmin. Copper concentration in the liver of LEC rats was over 40 times that of normal Long-Evans Agouti (LEA) rats, while the serum ceruloplasmin and copper concentrations in LEC rats decreased significantly. The hepatocytes of LEC rats show steatosis in cytoplasm and pleomorphism of mitochondria, resembling the histologic features of the liver in Wilson's disease. These findings suggest that the hereditary hepatitis in LEC rats is closely associated with copper toxicity, and may be dealing with a rat form of Wilson's disease. Thus the LEC rats will provide a unique and useful animal model for clarifying the mechanism and for developing treatment strategies for Wilson's disease and other abnormal copper metabolism in humans.\r"

  ".W": "Branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) deficiency results in maple syrup urine disease (MSUD). We examined the molecular basis of familial cases of MSUD by analyzing the activity, subunit structure, mRNA sequence, and genome structure of the affected enzyme. The BCKDH activity in the proband with MSUD was approximately 6% of the normal control level. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the E1 beta subunit of BCKDH was absent and that the E1 alpha subunit of BCKDH was markedly reduced. We amplified the cDNAs of the E1 alpha subunit and the E1 beta subunit of the BCKDH complex obtained from cells of the patient, using the polymerase chain reaction method, then sequenced the amplified cDNAs. The deduced amino acid sequence for the E1 alpha subunit of the patient's cell was normal. An 11-bp deletion was identified in the region that encoded the mitochondrial targeting leader peptide in the E1 beta cDNA. This 11-bp sequence is found in the first exon of the BCKDH-E1 beta gene, as a direct tandem repeat. Amplification of genomic DNA revealed that the consanguineous parents were heterozygous for this mutant allele, and sister and brother of the patient with the disease were homozygous for this mutant allele. This 11-bp deletion mutation caused a change in the reading frame and the mature E1 beta protein was defective. These observations show the biological importance of the E1 beta subunit of BCKDH to maintain normal function of the enzyme activity. The absence of the E1 beta subunit results in instability of the E1 alpha subunit.\r"

ET-1-like immunoreactivity was released from both HeLa and HEp-2 cells as a function of time. Reverse-phase HPLC of the conditioned media from HeLa cells revealed a major peak coeluting with standard ET-1. Northern blot analysis demonstrated the expression of mRNA for ET-1 precursor in both tumor cell lines. Both cell lines contained a single class of specific binding sites for ET-1. ET-1 dose-dependently induced increases in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration in fura-2-loaded tumor cells, whose effect was completely abolished by chelating extracellular Ca2+ or by Ca(2+)-channel blocker. ET-1 stimulated proliferation of the quiescent cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, whose effect was inhibited by Ca(2+)-channel blocker. Polyclonal antibody for ET-1 inhibited proliferation of these cell lines, whereas nonimmune serum had no effect. These results demonstrate that ET-1 is synthesized by and released from human epithelial carcinoma cell lines, and that exogenous and endogenous ET-1 stimulates proliferation of the cells possibly through Ca2+ influx, suggesting its role as an autocrine/paracrine growth factor for certain tumor cells.\r"

The following conditions should be followed: The selection of a posterior composite resin should be based on well-documented clinical data, not physical and mechanical properties. Complete moisture control is essential for the successful restoration of posterior teeth with composite resin. Always use a glass ionomer as a liner. The material should cover all the dentin. Cavity preparations should be minimal in dimension. Avoid unnecessary removal of tooth structure. Do not bevel the occlusal cavosurface margin. Insert the composite in increments. Minimize introduction of trauma during the finishing procedure. Use a surface penetrating sealant to reduce wear rate and to enhance margin integrity. Evaluate carefully the clinical performance of the restored tooth at least once a year. Discuss possible limitations of posterior composite resins as compared with amalgam restorations.\r"

METHODS: The project had two parts: (1) a retrospective, case-control study of 50 hospitalized patients greater than or equal to 65 years old whose serum cholesterol was normal on admission (greater than or equal to 160 mg/dL) and fell to less than or equal to 120 mg/dL during hospitalization; (2) a laboratory study of lipoproteins in 17 hospitalized patients greater than or equal to 65 years old whose cholesterol was normal on admission but fell to less than or equal to 120 mg/dL during hospitalization. RESULTS: Case-control Study--Nine percent of patients greater than or equal to 65 years old developed hypocholesterolemia while in the hospital, and these patients were more likely than controls to have undergone surgery and to have nothing by mouth for 5 days or longer. Cases had a longer length of stay, more complications, and were slightly more likely to die in the hospital than controls. LABORATORY STUDY--Hypocholesterolemic patients had low concentrations of all lipoproteins (VLDL, LDL, HDL), and the LDL and HDL were enriched in triglyceride and depleted of cholesterol ester. CONCLUSION: Acquired hypocholesterolemia is a common finding in hospitalized older patients and is associated with poor outcomes. Patients who became hypocholesterolemic in the hospital had both a low concentration of lipoprotein particles and abnormalities in lipoprotein particle composition.\r"

  ".W": "An anorexia nervosa-like syndrome has been reported in older persons. To gain additional insight into this condition, a questionnaire designed to assess the severity of eating disorders (the EAT-26) was administered to 183 male outpatients. Thirty-four subjects were found to be undernourished by midarm circumference measurement and 21 by weight adjusted for age-sex-height. Approximately 60% of malnourished subjects acknowledged inappropriate self-control around food, up to 26% described other unsuitable eating attitudes, and 3% to 52% evidenced various forms of distorted body image. They scored high on EAT-26 Oral Control subscale but low to normal on Dieting and Bulimia and Food Preoccupation subscales. These results indicate that abnormal eating attitudes and body image occur in an important minority of undernourished elderly males, but the pattern of abnormalities differs from that seen in classical anorexia nervosa. This association deserves additional investigation, with special attention to the psychopathology producing high Oral Control responses and to females as well as males. In the meantime, clinicians need to consider anorexia-like attitudes when caring for malnourished seniors.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between behavioral symptoms and cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is only poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to examine cognitive correlates of urinary incontinence in AD. Although incontinence is generally accepted as an accompaniment of AD, it was our clinical impression that it correlated poorly with global measures of cognitive impairment. A retrospective pilot study of 17 incontinent demented patients and 17 continent patients, matched for age, sex, and total score on the Folstein Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE), revealed a striking association between an inability to do a copy task and urinary incontinence. A prospective study confirmed this finding in a sample of 45 patients meeting DSMIII-R diagnostic criteria for dementia, probable Alzheimer's disease. The 17 incontinent patients did not differ from the 28 continent patients in age, sex distribution, or total score on the MMSE. However, the incontinent subjects scored significantly lower on a cube copying task. Qualitative analysis revealed that the drawings by incontinent patients showed features comparable with those observed in the drawings by patients with right-sided parietal lesions, in particular, poor representation of perspective and spatial orientation. Further investigation of the relationship between copying performance and incontinence may have implications for understanding the cortical mechanisms of urinary continence. The present results also underscore the limitations of the MMSE as a measure of dementia severity and suggest there are areas of cognitive ability which are inadequately assessed by MMSE but which may be of major important in understanding the loss of functional skills in the dementing patient.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether there are clinical and epidemiological differences between familial and non-familial Alzheimer's disease, we studied 151 patients with the clinical diagnosis of Dementia of the Alzheimer Type (DAT). Eighty-four index patients (56%) had at least one relative with reported DAT-type memory loss; the remaining 67 did not. For comparison, patients with a positive family history were grouped into a suspected familial DAT (FDAT), and those with a negative family history were grouped into a suspected non-familial DAT (NFDAT). There were no significant differences between FDAT and NFDAT patients with respect to age of symptom onset, survival time, rate of cognitive decline, motor function, behavioral signs or symptoms, head trauma, thyroid dysfunction, maternal age, or birth order. There were no significant differences between pedigrees of FDAT and NFDAT patients in respect to the prevalence of Down's syndrome or age of mortality. To examine a more \"familial\" set of FDAT patients, an FDAT subgroup (F2DAT) consisting of 33 index patients with two or more affected relatives with DAT-type memory loss was compared to the 67 NFDAT patients in a similar analysis. No significant differences were found. However, NFDAT index patients had a higher reported prevalence of head trauma than those patients in the F2DAT subgroup (NFDAT 22%, F2DAT 7%, OR = 4.2, CI = 0.9-20.0, P = 0.08). Thus severe head trauma may be a more important etiological factor in the non-familial form of DAT. To better examine this tendency, future studies should be conducted utilizing a larger number of pedigrees and familial criteria which account for the number of persons at risk and the age at onset of disease.\r"

The rationale for developing a multicentered, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to determine whether low-dose aspirin (100 mg daily) prevents cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality in persons aged 70 years and over with no evidence of pre-existing cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease is described. Sample size calculations have indicated that 15,000 subjects would be required over a 4-year follow-up period in order to demonstrate a 20% reduction in overall cardiovascular mortality at the 0.01 level with a power of 0.8. Such a large-scale community-based clinical trial has never been conducted in Australia in this age group. Therefore the PACE (prevention by low-dose aspirin of cardiovascular disease in the elderly) pilot study has been developed to test recruitment strategies and methods and ascertaining disease end-points.\r"

It may, therefore, be an alternative to height in calculating BMI. We studied the relationship between height and armspan in 101 elderly men and women. A comparison of BMI by height and armspan was made. The correlation between height and armspan was 0.93. Armspan could be estimated by doubling halfspan (recumbent). The mean difference between BMI by height and armspan was 1.79 (SD 1.11) kg/M2. We concluded that armspan is a reliable and practical estimate of height in the non-ambulant elderly. There is a case for the use of armspan instead of height in the determination of BMI in the elderly.\r"

Results show that disruptive vocalizers were more functionally impaired and were more likely to receive a diagnosis of dementia. They were also more likely to display a higher activity level and to experience sleep disturbance and to be prescribed neuroleptic medications. Descriptive data are presented on typology of disruptive vocalizations, likely situations for their occurrence, and the utilization and perceived efficacy of common interventions. Suggestions are made regarding behavioral treatments for this vexing problem.\r"

Fifty-eight percent (280) of the patients received no recommendation for a change in the living situation. Of the 200 patients receiving a recommendation for a change in living situation, 97 (49%) were felt to be able to stay at home with increased in-home support and/or day care, and 51.5% (103) were advised to seek placement. After adjusting for age and gender, risk factors predicting a recommendation for change were dementia (odds-ratio = 9.98), vision deficits (odds ratio = 2.02), lower education level compared to college (odds-ratio = 1.88 high school, 1.42 for less than high school), an increasing number of medical diagnoses (odds-ratio = 1.49 per diagnosis), and a functional impairment on the Katz index (odds-ratio = 1.09). The presence of these risk factors should lead to consideration of further evaluation of the home environment in this study. We conclude that geriatric patients presenting for a comprehensive outpatient evaluation commonly need a change in home situation, though most can remain in their home, and that simple clinical observations can be helpful in screening patients for further evaluation of their home environment.\r"

Most patients with widespread chronic T. rubrum infection fail to express a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to intradermally injected trichophytin. We propose that cell-mediated immunity to T. rubrum may be suppressed in chronic infections by the mannan cell wall component of the fungus. The proposed suppressive effect of T. rubrum mannan on cell-mediated immunity was tested by measuring the ability of extracted mannan to inhibit lymphoproliferative responses of human mononuclear leukocytes to antigens, mitogens, and an anti-T-cell receptor antibody (anti-CD3) in vitro. Mannan was found to be highly antigenic in two of five donors and weakly antigenic in the other three. Despite its antigenic property, mannan exhibited a dose-related ability to inhibit lymphoproliferation stimulated by other agents including 1) antigens from Candida albicans, T. rubrum, and tetanus toxoid (ID50 = 250 micrograms/ml); 2) anti-CD3 antibody (ID50 = 250 micrograms/ml); and 3) Phaseolus limensis mitogenic lectin (ID50 = 64 micrograms/ml). Mannan added to cultures later than 24 h after initiation had no inhibitory influence, but culture of cells with mannan for a period of 24 h prior to the addition of stimulus enhanced the inhibitory effect of the glycoprotein. Lymphoproliferation in response to recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) was not inhibited. The influence of time of addition of mannan and the failure of mannan to inhibit IL-2-stimulated lymphoproliferation demonstrate that the suppressive effect of mannan must be pharmacologic rather than cytotoxic. The observed ability of T. rubrum cell wall mannan to suppress cell-mediated immune function in vitro may provide an important clue to a mechanism enabling the fungus to avoid elimination in chronically infected patients.\r"

It is not known what role NGF plays in melanoma development, but nevus and malignant melanoma cells express NGF-receptor (NGF-R). We counted nerve fibers within melanocytic nevi, primary cutaneous melanomas, and cutaneous melanoma metastases using a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) as marker against a 200-kD glycoprotein that is expressed on human nerves. The expression of NGF-R was studied in serial cryostat sections using a MoAb against the NGF-R. Compared to normal skin, increased numbers of nerve fibers were found in 72 melanocytic nevi. In congenital nevi their number significantly increased with age. In 47 primary cutaneous melanomas the number of nerve fibers decreased in proportion to tumor thickness. In 33 cutaneous melanoma metastases no accumulation of nerve fibers was found. NGF-R was not expressed in normal skin melanocytes and in the majority of nevus cells in melanocytic nevi. Considerable numbers of NGF-R-positive nervus cells were found only in some congenital nevi and few acquired nevi with dysplastic features. By contrast, in primary and metastatic melanomas higher expression of NGF-R was observed. The increased number of nerve fibers in melanocytic nevi suggests that neurite-promoting factors are produced in situ. Production of such factors appears to be lost in malignant melanoma cells. The finding of an inverse correlation between an abundance of nerve fibers in NGF-R-poor nevi and a high expression of NGF-R in melanomas that show no evidence of nerve growth suggest a role of NGF and its receptor in malignant melanocytic tumors.\r"

Polyclonal affinity-purified antibodies and a monoclonal antibody raised to purified pig tongue trichohyalin both stained the inner root sheath of hair follicles and the medulla of hair fibers and identified human trichohyalin as a single 220-kDa band on immunoblots of human hair bulb proteins. These antibodies were used to examine human epidermis by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting. The antibodies decorate granules in cells in the granular layer and stratum corneum of non-hair-bearing human skin, and immunoblots identify a protein in epidermis comigrating with trichohyalin from human hair and human tongue epithelium. Absorption of antibody to trichohyalin on a trichohyalin affinity column abrogated staining of the epidermis and the bands on the immunoblots. Trypsin-separated epidermis contained 220 and 160 kDa bands identified as trichohyalin, but epidermis shaved from skin and quickly frozen showed only a single 220-kDa band, indicating that the 160-kDa protein was generated by proteolysis. Double immunofluorescence for trichohyalin and filaggrin showed that some cells containing filaggrin also contain trichohyalin. These studies show that trichohyalin is not limited to hair and tongue but is present in isolated cells in the granular layer and stratum corneum of normal epidermis.\r"

Similar areas from a further eight patients were examined using light and electronmicroscopy. \"Active\" and \"normal\" areas of alopecia areata scalps were immunohistologically similar and varied from normal controls in the number, distribution, and ratio for T4 and T8-positive cells. Similarly the ultrastructural changes seen in the \"active\" areas when compared to normal controls were also present in the \"normal\" areas of alopecia areata scalps. The most significant differences found between normal \"control\" follicles and both \"active\" and \"normal\" areas of alopecia areata scalps were the polymorphic nature of the dermal papilla cells and the loss of cellular organization within the dermal papillae taken from alopecia areata scalps. In addition, the junction between the dermal papilla and the bulb of the hair follicle, the dermo-epithelial junction of the hair follicle bulb, demonstrated critical changes in follicles taken from both \"active\" and \"normal\" areas of alopecia areata scalps. These results support the suggestion of a subclinical state of alopecia areata and indicate that further work on the etiology of alopecia areata should be directed towards the \"normal\" areas of alopecia areata scalps, in particular the cells of the dermal papilla and the dermo-epithelial junction of the hair follicle bulb.\r"

  ".W": "Neutrophil-activating protein-1/interleukin 8 (NAP-1/IL-8), purified to homogeneity from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human peripheral blood monocytes, was injected intracutaneously into human skin. Sequential biopsy specimens were taken in order to investigate the sequence of ultrastructural changes induced by the cytokine. Whereas intracutaneous injection of 100 ng of NAP-1/IL-8 per site caused no macroscopic changes, by histology infiltration with polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and monocytes was present within 1 h and increased at 3 and 5 h. No lymphocyte infiltration was noted. The first ultrastructural changes (30 min) consisted of the presence of cytoplasmic 7-nm microfilament bundles, as well as numerous protrusions of the luminal plasma membrane of endothelial cells (EC). As a striking feature, multiple 100- to 160-nm electron lucent vesicles could be observed in the EC cytoplasm. These structures differed from plasmalemmal vesicles and suggest secretory activity. When PMN and monocytes appeared in the vascular lumen (1 h and later), the number of 100-160-nm electron-lucent vesicles had decreased significantly. In contrast to C5a-injected skin sites, mast cell degranulation was absent.\r"

  ".W": "Neutrophil attractant/activation protein-1 (NAP-1) is a recently described cytokine that attracts neutrophils, but not monocytes or eosinophils. This leukocyte specificity is not absolute, in that NAP-1 attracts basophils and small numbers of lymphocytes. Our purpose was to determine in vivo effects of NAP-1, and to compare them to the reported action of the complement attractant, C5a. Intradermal injection into normal human subjects of 40 microliters of NAP-1, over a concentration range of 4 x 10(-8) M to 10(-6) M, caused no symptoms or signs such as wheal-and-flare, itching, induration, or tenderness. However, biopsies of injection sites showed perivascular neutrophil infiltration as early as 30 min, which increased at 1 and 3 h. The mean number of neutrophils per mm2 of dermis for 15 biopsies taken 3 h after intradermal injection of 2 x 10(-7) M or 10(-6) M NAP-1 was 164 +/- 41; the response to saline or a NAP-1 inactive fragment was 5 or less. Intradermal NAP-1 did not cause basophil or lymphocyte infiltration. Consistent with the absence of a wheal-and-flare, acid toluidine blue-stained sections showed no evidence of mast cell degranulation, in contrast to previously reported results with C5a. Thus, the predominant response by human subjects to intradermal NAP-1 was neutrophil accumulation in proximity to dermal blood vessels.\r"

However, their function in this kind of immune response is not known presently. Therefore, in vivo studies were initiated to test the effect on allergic (ACD) and irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) of the neuropeptides substance P (SP), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and somatostatin (SOM), which are released from afferent neurons in the skin. Each neuropeptide was applied topically at the site of contact with the allergen (oxazolone) or irritant (croton oil) during the challenge and sensitization phase of contact dermatitis. The intensity of the inflammation was measured as an increase of ear-swelling response, which represents the degree of plasma extravasation in the early phase of inflammation. Neuropeptides alone led only to a distinct vasodilation. All three neuropeptides were equally able to increase allergic and irritant inflammation. Even minor irritant stimuli were enhanced. Beyond that, CGRP was able to boost sensitization, whereas SOM and SP did not show any effects on the sensitization process. The results presented demonstrate that neuropeptides increase plasma extravasation independent of the pathogenesis of inflammation and may act as priming substances for other mediators of increased vascular permeability. In addition, CGRP enhances the sensitization process.\r"

Dolichos biflorus agglutinin reacted uniquely with junctional epithelium, not staining other gingival cells of non-blood group A1 donors. We have demonstrated that the moiety recognized in junctional epithelium is not blood group A1 antigen or Tn antigen. Using a panning technique with this lectin to isolate the cells, we have grown keratinocytes from human junctional epithelium, and compared their phenotype in vitro to that of cells grown from the sulcular and attached gingival epithelium. Colonies established from each epithelial type were examined in frozen section with the anti-keratin antibodies. All expressed keratin 14 (keratinocyte marker), keratins 4 and 13 (suprabasal non-cornification markers), and keratins 7, 18, and 19 (simple epithelia keratins). Keratins 1, 10, and 8 were not expressed. Vimentin, the intermediate filament of mesenchymal cells, was also expressed by all types of cells in culture. Thus we have shown that when cells from the three areas of the gingiva were grown in culture they revert to one phenotype, at least with respect to their keratin expression. These results support the hypothesis that the epithelial phenotype is influenced by the sub-epithelial mesenchyme, and it is this that is responsible for the unique phenotype of the junctional epithelium.\r"

  ".U": "91217465\r", 
  ".W": "Epibolin, a plasma protein, was initially purified on the basis of its ability to enhance spreading of keratinocytes. It is now known that epibolin is identical to serum spreading factor, S protein, and vitronectin, and the current name for the protein is vitronectin. Studies of vitronectin on cultured keratinocytes showed that it caused spreading and epiboly but not cellular adhesion to the substratum. In studies with other types of cells, vitronectin increased migration of several types of cells in a Boyden chamber. Because some agents that enhance spreading and adhesion, such as collagen and fibronectin, also increase motility, we tested whether vitronectin increased motility of keratinocytes. By photographing and quantitating motility of keratinocytes plated on a bed of colloidal gold particles, we determined that vitronectin increased local movement of keratinocytes in a concentration-dependent fashion, resulting in clearing of gold particles in a circular pattern around the cells, but did not cause the production of tracks found in cultures plated on collagen or fibronectin. The small increases in clearing of the gold particles that occurred in the presence of vitronectin were abolished by antibody to vitronectin. Furthermore, the marked increase in motility produced by type I collagen was significantly reduced when the keratinocytes were treated with vitronectin. Antibody to vitronectin also abrogated the vitronectin-induced reduction in collagen-stimulated motility, confirming that this action was specific for vitronectin. Serum, which contains vitronectin, stimulated motility in a fashion identical to purified vitronectin, but serum lacking vitronectin was inactive. These studies show that vitronectin causes a localized increase in movement associated with spreading resulting in a halo around individual cells, that vitronectin does not enhance directional motility of keratinocytes in this assay but in contrast antagonizes such motility produced by collagen, and that vitronectin is the factor in serum responsible for this effect. The findings with vitronectin and collagen show that these agents stimulate different types of motility. The roles in wound healing of agents stimulating different types of motility are unclear and require further study.\r"

Ultrastructural analysis of this electron-dense zone revealed recesses that contained numerous anchoring fibrils. Indirect immunofluorescence staining with antibodies to collagen VII, the major structural component of the anchoring fibrils, showed strong fluorescence of this zone. Collagen VII could be isolated from tumor tissue by limited pepsin digestion or by extraction with chaotropic agents. Cylindroma cells were cultured from the tumor and passaged several times. The cells exhibited a strong expression of collagen VII in vitro, when assayed with immunofluorescence staining or immunoblotting of culture extracts. These results suggest that cylindroma can be used as an abundant source to produce collagen VII in vitro to study the biosynthesis and regulation of collagen VII and the formation of the anchoring fibrils, as other culture systems have failed to produce ample amounts of this anchoring fibril protein.\r"

We have previously shown that freshly isolated LC (fLC) are able to deliver endocytosed membrane MHC class II molecules into acidic environments, and that this capacity is lost when LC are placed in culture (cLC). Inasmuch as processing of antigens requires their passage through acidic compartments, we undertook the present study to examine the ability of fLC and cLC to take up acridine orange, and to identify proton-translocating ATPases in these cells. Using flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy, acridine orange was observed to accumulate in acidic compartments in both fLC and cLC. Using a radioactive ATPase assay, crude membrane preparations from both fLC and cLC were shown to possess three types of ion-translocating ATPase, based on sensitivity to the following inhibitors: ouabain (Na+, K+ ATPase), oligomycin (mitochondrial F1F0 ATPase), and bafilomycin (vacuolar-type proton pump ATPase); the last type is responsible for acidification in vacuolar compartments. cLC displayed markedly less (less than 50%) total ATPase activity compared to fLC; however, the relative proportions of specific ATPases were similar in fLC and cLC. Combined use of the three inhibitors resulted in abrogation of only 25-40% of the total ATPase activity. Finally, treatment of LC with bafilomycin inhibited both acridine orange uptake and acidification of internalized HLA-DR molecules. These results confirm the ability of both fLC and cLC to acidify vacuolar compartments, thereby suggesting that lack of acidification of endocytosed membrane class II molecules in cultured cells is due to alternative routing to non-acidic organelles.\r"

We have investigated the nature of the association of vitronectin with elastic tissue, and compared it to that of other elastic fiber-associated proteins, namely fibrillin and amyloid P component. Samples of normal human dermis were incubated with a variety of extraction agents, including high molar salt solution, non-ionic detergent (Nonidet P-40), the reducing agents dithiothreitol or 2-mercaptoethanol, and the chaotropic agents sodium dodecyl sulfate or guanidine hydrochloride. Vitronectin purified from serum typically migrates as two bands of 75 and 65 kD. By contrast, immunoblotting studies of residual dermal material after extraction with the various agents revealed only lower molecular weight (58, 50, 42, 35, and 27 kD) anti-vitronectin reactive bands. Although these bands may represent degradation products of vitronectin generated as a result of the extraction procedure, we cannot exclude the possibility that tissue vitronectin is distinct from plasma vitronectin. Anti-vitronectin reactive polypeptides co-migrating with the 58-, 50-, and 42-kD bands were solubilized following extraction with sodium dodecyl sulfate or guanidine hydrochloride, but not with the other extraction agents. Immunofluorescence studies using residual dermal material after extraction with guanidine hydrochloride demonstrated a marked reduction in elastic fiber staining intensity with anti-vitronectin and anti-amyloid P component, but not with anti-fibrillin. Thus the majority, if not all of dermal vitronectin, is, like amyloid P component, non-covalently associated with, and not an integral constituent of, elastic fibers.\r"

In the studies presented here, the effects of UVA radiation (320-400 nm) on the barrier capacity of human stratum corneum were examined. Penetration of a homologous series of primary alcohols through unirradiated (control) and UVA-irradiated (test) human epidermis was determined in vitro. Permeability constants, kp, were calculated. Mean ratios of permeability constants for UVA-irradiated and unirradiated epidermis (mean kp test)/(mean kp control) ranged from 2.3 to 3.0 for methanol and from 2.2 to 2.5 for ethanol. These mean ratios were determined using different pieces of epidermis from the same piece of skin for test and control samples. When kp control and kp test were determined on the same piece of epidermis on successive days, the ratios (kp test/kp control) were similar to the mean ratios determined on different pieces of epidermis. For other primary alcohols, propanol, butanol, hexanol, and heptanol, UVA radiation did not alter their permeability constants significantly. Partition coefficients, Km, were determined for ethanol and heptanol using UVA-irradiated and unirradiated stratum corneum. For ethanol, irradiation resulted in a 1.5 to 2.6 times increase in Km. For heptanol, irradiation caused no change in Km. These results demonstrate that the barrier capacity of stratum corneum for small, polar, primary alcohols is diminished (permeability increases) and for higher molecular weight less polar alcohols, is unaffected by small doses of UVA radiation. This increased permeability of small polar alcohols through human skin may be due to enhanced partitioning into UVA-irradiated stratum corneum, which was not apparent for a higher molecular weight less polar alcohol.\r"

We have studied two forms of cutaneous inflammation to investigate in vivo the kinetics of adhesion molecule expression in relation to tissue accumulation of leukocytes. Immunohistology was performed on skin biopsies taken from human volunteers at 1, 6, 24, 72 h, and 1 week after two minimal erythema doses (MED) of ultraviolet B (UV-B) or intra-cutaneous tuberculin-purified protein derivative (PPD) (10-100 U). ELAM-1 expression on vascular endothelium and polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration were first observed at 6 h and maximal at 24 h after both UV-B and PPD. At 72 h and 1 week, however, endothelial ELAM-1 was more strongly expressed in PPD biopsies. VCAM-1 was minimally expressed in control skin, and was induced above background levels on endothelium, on some perivascular cells, and on stellate-shaped cells in the upper dermis at 24 h after injection of PPD; it was maintained up to 1 week. In contrast, no induction of VCAM-1 was seen following challenge with either 2 or 8 MED UV-B. Following PPD, but not UV-B, there was marked induction of ICAM-1 expression on basal keratinocytes. In these biopsies, the inflammation induced in response to PPD therefore differed from UV-B-induced inflammation in showing prolonged expression of endothelial ELAM-1, induction of VCAM-1 on endothelium and other cells, and induction of keratinocyte ICAM-1. These differences may result from differences in the cytokines released and may in turn be responsible for the differences in the nature of the leukocytic infiltration during the two types of inflammatory response.\r"

The rate of secretion of these cytokines can be augmented in response to a variety of stimuli including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, transforming growth factor-beta and the combination of lipopolysaccharide and phorbol myristate acetate. Interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 have been reported to influence the proliferation of cultured human fibroblasts. However, these cytokines had no significant effect on the proliferation of human keratinocytes or the SCC lines tested. Although it seems unlikely that interleukin-1 or interleukin-6 could directly influence keratinocyte proliferation in vivo, the capacity of these cells to synthesize and release these cytokines supports earlier observations that keratinocytes may play an important role in augmenting an immune or inflammatory response.\r"

Cutaneous wounds (50-mm length, 2-mm width, and 5-mm depth) were produced on the flank area of two pigs and left unsutured. Daily biopsies from day 1 to day 20 were studied by light microscopy on paraffin-embedded sections and by indirect immunofluorescence on cryostat sections using human sera to bullous pemphigoid antigen (BPA) with specificity previously confirmed by indirect immuno-electron microscopy, rabbit antisera to type IV collagen (Coll IV) and to fibronectin, and the monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) 4C 12-8 to laminin and NP-76 to type VII collagen (Coll VII). Histologically, reepidermization started from day 1 and progressed unidirectionally and exclusively from the wound edges. Up to day 9, the distal tips of the neo-epidermal tongues generally extended between the crust and the granulation tissue (GT). They fused on day 10, restoring epidermal continuity. For each EDJ component, the date of appearance (emergence), the spreading under the neo-epidermis tongue (expression), and the morphologic aspect of the labeling were studied. BPA and Coll IV were detected from day 1 to day 20 and found to be expressed all along the neo-EDJ. Fibronectin and laminin were detected from day 1, were present in the proximal and median zones of the neo-EDJ before day 7, up to the distal tip from day 7 to day 9 and were all along the neo-EDJ from day 10 to day 20. Coll VII was only detected from day 3. It was present in the proximal zone on day 3 and day 4, in the proximal and median zones on day 5 and day 6, than all along the neo-EDJ from day 7 to day 20. From day 10, all the labeling characteristics of the five components were found to be similar in the neo-EDJ and in the normal EDJ. With regard to the neo-epidermis progression, we found a synchronism of emergence and expression for BPA and Coll IV, a synchronism of emergence but a delay of expression for fibronectin and laminin and lastly, a delay of emergence and expression for Coll VII. We concluded that BPA and Coll IV could constitute the framework on which the neo-EDJ is progressively built by adjunction of the other components, restitution being obtained just after epidermal continuity is restored.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to determine the effects of 13-cis-RA, all-trans-RA, and acitretin on the proliferation, lipid synthesis, and keratin expression of human sebocytes in vitro and to elucidate possible mechanisms of retinoid action on sebaceous glands at the cellular level. It was found that 13-cis-RA and all-trans-RA decreased sebocyte proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with a 13-cis-RA-IC50 of 10(-5) M (after 7 d) and 10(-6) M (after 14 d) and an all-trans-RA-IC50 of 10(-7) M (after 14 d; no IC50 after 7 d). Acitretin inhibited sebocyte proliferation only at 10(-5) M. Furthermore, 13-cis-RA was the most potent inhibitor of acetate incorporation into lipids, which indicated lipid synthesis (48.2% reduction), followed by all-trans-RA (-38.6%), and by acitretin (-27.5%). All retinoids tested markedly decreased the synthesis of triglycerides, wax/stearyl esters, and free fatty acids in cultured sebocytes, whereas squalene synthesis remained uninfluenced and cholesterol synthesis slightly increased. On the other hand, keratin 5 was down-regulated, keratin 17 was up-regulated, and the expression of keratin 13 was virtually unaffected by all retinoids tested. Keratins 6 and 16 were down-regulated by 13-cis-RA and by all-trans-RA, keratin 14 was down-regulated by 13-cis-RA only, and keratin 19 was up-regulated by all-trans-RA. These investigations indicate that 13-cis-RA and, to a lesser extent, all-trans-RA are potent inhibitors of both cell proliferation and lipid synthesis in human sebocytes in vitro, whereas acitretin only decreases lipogenesis in this model. In addition, retinoids may modify the differentiation of sebocytes in vitro by modulating keratin expression. Models of cultured human sebocytes are useful tools for further investigations on the sebaceous gland and its activity at the cellular level.\r"

Forty primary care physicians were surveyed to assess their knowledge, attitudes, and experiences regarding cancer and cancer screening, and patients' medical records were reviewed to measure physicians' screening rates. RESULTS. Over 80% of physicians believed doctors should urge screening. On average, 23% of their patient visits were scheduled primarily for preventive care interventions. Screening performance scores expressed the percentage of compliance with the American Cancer Society's recommendations and demonstrated the low levels of compliance for six out of seven tests; however, there was substantial variance in performance among physicians. The best predictors of screening performance were (1) the percentage of visits scheduled primarily for prevention (mammography, and pelvic and breast examinations [P less than .05]); and (2) the number of medical journals read regularly (stool occult blood test [P less than .01], sigmoidoscopy [P less than .01], and Papanicolaou smear [P less than .02]). Also, female physicians performed more Papanicolaou smears (P less than .05) and scheduled more visits for preventive care (P less than .001). CONCLUSIONS. A small group of predictors explain large portions of the variance in cancer screening performance.\r"

Although experts estimate that 30% of breast cancer deaths could be prevented if women were screened according to published guidelines, fewer than 50% of physicians follow screening mammography guidelines, and fewer than 30% of women are screened with mammography. METHODS. Physician recommendations for screening mammography were examined in a questionnaire mailed to 300 randomly selected physicians of the Ohio Academy of Family Physicians. Physicians responded with their likelihood of recommending screening mammography to 24 clinical vignettes that high-lighted patient, mammographic, and encounter characteristics. RESULTS. Seventy-one percent responded. Ninety-one percent reported almost always recommending screening mammography to a 55-year-old woman at her yearly examination. They were significantly less likely to recommend mammography to women who were young (40 years old), were old (70 years old), were poor, had small breasts, had painful mammograms, did not want the doctor to look for cancer, lived in a nursing home, or were retarded. Physicians recommended mammography less often when the mammography unit was far away or produced poor quality films or ambiguous interpretations. When physicians ran behind schedule, perceived a more urgent medical problem during the encounter, or saw a woman for an acute visit, they recommended mammography significantly less often. CONCLUSIONS. Patient, mammographic, and encounter characteristics significantly limit physician recommendations for screening mammography as assessed by clinical vignettes. These characteristics must be addressed if breast cancer mortality is to be reduced with early screening.\r"

Fewer studies have investigated the relationship between stress and the immunologic response to vaccines. A follow-up study was designed to investigate the relationships between stress, distress, and the antibody response to a recombinant hepatitis B vaccine. METHODS. Eighty-one seronegative medical students received a standard immunization protocol of a recombinant hepatitis B vaccine. Six months after the first dose, corresponding to the induction phase of immunization, each subject completed both the Survey of Life Experiences and the Symptom Distress Check List to assess levels of stress and distress during that period. Three months after the third dose, corresponding to the booster phase of immunization, each subject completed the same questionnaires and was also tested for a quantitative hepatitis B surface antibody titer. Correlations were statistically analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient and stepwise multifactorial regression analysis. RESULTS. Higher levels of negatively perceived stress, irascibility, depression, and anxiety during the induction phase of immunization were significantly associated with higher peak antibody titers. Together these psychosocial factors accounted for 5.8% of the variance, and were as strong a determinant of peak antibody titer as was age. CONCLUSIONS. In addition to the known vaccine-related and biological factors, psychosocial factors appear to affect the immune response to a recombinant hepatitis B vaccine. The positive direction of the correlation raises the question of whether the effect of psychosocial factors on antibody formation is different from their effect on antibody function.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. This study describes billing practices of family physicians. Significant increases in the reimbursement for family physicians are expected from implementation of the resource-based relative value scale (RBRVS). However, the real impact of the RBRVS is unknown since little is known about how family physicians use the present reimbursement system to charge their patients. METHODS. A random sample of 270 North Carolina family physicians was surveyed, using standardized progress notes of five hypothetical patients. RESULTS. One hundred thirty-eight (51%) physicians responded; 107 (77.5%) were in private practice. Family physicians in private and nonprivate practices were similar in their Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) coding and level of service for each hypothetical case. Family physicians in smaller communities showed greater variation in CPT coding of visits than did family physicians in larger communities, and they were more likely to use CPT codes that indicated a lower level of visit. Rural family physicians demonstrated a significant inverse relationship between the CPT level of visit coded (ranging from \"brief,\" with a CPT code of 90040, to \"comprehensive,\" coded CPT 90080) and the amount they charged established patients for a \"limited\" visit (CPT 90050). CONCLUSIONS. These findings suggest that the lower income of rural physicians is due, in part, to billing at a lower CPT code, and thus charging less for comparable services, than urban physicians. The findings also lend further support to contentions that federal reimbursement reforms will have less impact on the incomes of rural physicians than originally expected.\r"

This study investigated the effect of free office cholesterol testing on screening behavior and on blood cholesterol reduction in a family practice center. METHODS. After a baseline period of 5 months, an office cholesterol analyzer was made available for 1 year to two teams of patients and providers (study group), but not to the other two teams (control group). RESULTS. The percentage of patients screened increased from 28% to 52% in the study group, and from 29% to 42% in the control group (difference favoring study group, prevalence odds ratio = 1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.33 to 1.62). Compared with those whose cholesterol tests were sent to outside laboratories, patients screened with the office analyzer were younger (mean age 36 years vs 42 years), and the barrier to those without insurance was reduced. There was no clinically or statistically significant effect on lowering cholesterol (difference favoring study group = 0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI = -0.15 to 0.17). CONCLUSIONS. The availability of free office cholesterol testing increased the prevalence of cholesterol testing, particularly for younger patients and those without insurance; however, the testing had no discernible effect of motivating patients to lower their blood cholesterol levels.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Depression is one of the most important psychiatric disorders of older people. Between 1% and 5% of elderly persons who live in the community have major depression. Depressed elderly people are thought to be more likely to complain of symptoms such as headache, constipation, and pain than of disordered mood. The purpose of this study was to determine whether certain symptoms, diseases, or drugs used by older people correlate with scores on the Beck Depression Inventory. METHODS. Beck Depression Inventory scores were obtained in an ambulatory elderly population to identify correlates with self-reported signs, symptoms, diseases, drugs, and laboratory values. A total of 1048 participants were studied, including 712 women and 336 men. RESULTS. In this study, 13.7% of the men and 20.7% of the women had scores suggesting possible depression. A linear regression model revealed eight factors of significance in predicting scores on the Beck Depression Inventory. The most important predictors were the total number of symptoms reported by the patient (P less than .0001), and subjective complaints of memory loss (P less than .0003) and of pain in the abdomen (P less than .0004). CONCLUSIONS. Clinically, the results of this study suggest that depression is underdiagnosed in older patients and that multiple somatic symptoms are the best indicator of depression in this population.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Primary care physicians often make decisions about the use of endocarditis prophylaxis (EP). Compliance with American Heart Association (AHA) recommendations has been found to be poor in hospitalized patients and in a dental school clinic. The purpose of this study was to examine the use of endocarditis prophylaxis in a primary care clinic. METHODS. The problem list of all adult patients seen in a primary care clinic in 1989 was reviewed for diagnoses that might require EP. Eighty-four charts were identified and reviewed. RESULTS. Sixty-five percent of the study patients had documentation in their charts about the need for EP. Mitral valve prolapse was the most frequent diagnosis. The physicians recommended EP for most patients with mitral valve prolapse regardless of whether there was documented mitral insufficiency. Endocarditis prophylaxis was most commonly prescribed for dental procedures. Six patients received prophylaxis for procedures for which the AHA does not recommend prophylaxis. Only 19% of the antibiotic regimens prescribed were entirely consistent with the AHA 1984 guidelines. The most common deviation from the AHA guidelines was continuing oral antibiotics too long. CONCLUSIONS. Compliance with the AHA 1984 recommendations, although better than reported in other settings, was less than optimal in this primary care clinic. Family physicians should consider whether EP is indicated in any patient with cardiac disease. If prophylaxis is indicated, then such a recommendation should be clearly documented in the chart. Family physicians need to be familiar with the 1990 AHA recommendations.\r"

  ".W": "The many unique features of glucocorticoids makes therapy with these steroids challenging. The anti-inflammatory potency, relative mineralocorticoid activity, plasma half-life, and route of administration of the synthetic cortisol preparations are compared. Because they produce profound anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, exogenously administered glucocorticoids are effective therapy for a variety of diseases and conditions. The appropriate dosing regimen is an adequate dose administered for a sufficient period to precipitate an acceptable response. It is impossible to predict the regimen that will suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis and thereby increase the risk of developing adrenal insufficiency during periods of stress. Until recovery of the axis is complete, patients require daily physiologic replacement doses; high-dose supplemental therapy may be required during a major illness or surgery. Once there are signs of improvement, the dosing regimen should be adjusted to a single morning dose, then to an alternate-day regimen, and, as soon as possible, the steroid should be discontinued. This tapering process maintains disease suppression while minimizing toxicity; however, it is often complicated by exacerbation of the disease and withdrawal symptoms. Potential complications associated with glucocorticoid therapy are numerous, involve all organ systems, and are potentially more devastating than the HPA axis suppression.\r"

  ".W": "Although critics have argued that psychiatric medications in correctional settings are often prescribed in a clinically irrational manner, without adequate diagnostic criteria, and for the purposes of coercive control rather than treatment, there has been no systematic research in an attempt to validate these claims. The present study examines the influence of inmate clinical and social characteristics, as well as prison setting factors, on the prescription of psychiatric medication to New York State prison inmates. Study findings show that clinical characteristics predominate in the psychiatric medication prescription process. Specifically, psychiatric impairments, measured in terms of levels of depression, manifest symptomatology, agitation, and prior psychiatric hospitalization were found to be highly significant predictors of drug prescription. This finding suggests clinically appropriate use. Some researchers have suggested that the influence of patient social characteristics on psychiatric treatment is greatest when patient symptomatology is less severe. The conditional effect of inmate social characteristics on drug prescription was examined by levels of inmate impairment, and differences were found. The decision to prescribe medication for mildly impaired inmates appears to be influenced by social factors. However, when an inmate's behavior is unquestionably bizarre or disruptive, social status characteristics are less likely to influence physicians' clinical judgments.\r"

Despite similar levels of intellectual functioning and lesion parameters, the longer duration group showed significantly higher depression scores and significant (T greater than 70) elevations on several other clinical scales of the MMPI. In contrast, the mean overall profile of the short-duration group was roughly within normal limits.

Low Scale 1 subjects made fewer confusions than high Scale 1 subjects when distinguishing between memories about their health and the health of a friend or of a stranger. However, high Scale 1 subjects were at least as able to determine the origin of a memory as were normal subjects when the discrimination did not involve a memory about themselves. Interestingly, it does not appear that high Scale 1 individuals are particularly poor at monitoring the origin of health-related memories, but rather that normals are particularly good monitors in this domain.\r"

To measure alexithymia, we used the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS); to measure depression, we used the revised Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Factor analyses identified three alexithymia factors (Feelings, Daydreaming, and External Thinking) and two depression factors (Somatic-Performance and Cognitive-Affective). The three TAS factors were not positively related to each other; the two BDI factors were. We used LISREL software to examine the relationships between the TAS factors and the BDI factors. The only two significant unidirectional coefficients were between the TAS-Feelings factor and the two BDI factors. Our results suggest that in recently sober alcoholics, alexithymia, as measured by the TAS, consists of three independent, unrelated dimensions. Moreover, only the dimension associated with an inability to identify feelings and to distinguish them from bodily sensations is related to depressive symptoms. To determine whether this alexithymia feelings dimension actually is dependent on situational depression and/or anxiety will require confirmation in additional samples, such as primary alexithymics and patients with major depressive disorders.\r"

Soon thereafter the forelimbs also become weak, and all mice die six to seven weeks after birth. Heterozygotes are normal. Skeletal muscles show neurogenic atrophy without histological signs of reinnervation. Axonal degeneration apparently starts at the endplates and is prominent in the sciatic nerve and its branches and the phrenic nerve. Axonal sprouts are abundant. There is no evidence of demyelination, and unaffected nerve fibers are normally myelinated. Sensory axons are spared. Almost all distal motor axons have disappeared in four to five weeks after birth. Ventral nerve roots show a reduced diameter of the largest fibers but no fiber deficits. The ventral horn cells show slight chromatolysis. The corticospinal tract is normal, but in terminally ill animals the fasciculus gracilis, the rubrospinal tract and possibly also reticulospinal fibers degenerate. The brain is histologically normal. The disease manifests itself in a dying-back fashion in the distal portion of the motor neurons and may represent an animal model of hereditary motor neuron diseases in man.\r"

Until recently, BDV-infected neural cells could only be identified immunocytochemically using serum from BDV-infected animals. The advent of BDV cDNA clones allowed definition of the relationship between viral nucleic acids and viral proteins in vivo. In situ hybridization with strand-specific RNA probes from a BDV cDNA clone, pAF4, identified BDV genomic RNA and BDV mRNAs in neurons, astrocytes, Schwann cells and ependymal cells in an anatomic distribution consistent with that of BDV proteins. Genomic RNA was contained primarily within the nucleus, whereas mRNAs were found in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. Viral RNAs were demonstrated in neurons expressing BDV proteins and in glial cells by combined techniques of immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization.\r"

We compared mast cell numbers in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) of rodent strains that differed in their susceptibility to experimental demyelination. Mast cells were counted by toluidine blue staining of formalin-fixed tissue. Normal Lewis rats (susceptible to both EAN and EAE) had significantly greater numbers of mast cells in the dura mater (about 6x) of the meninges and the sciatic nerve (3x) than Brown Norway rats (resistant to EAE and EAN induction under normal circumstances). Similarly SJL/J mice (susceptible to EAE and EAN) had significantly greater numbers of CNS (3x) and PNS (8x) mast cells than C3H mice (more resistant to disease induction). Other mouse strains were also examined, and PNS mutant Trembler mice had high numbers of PNS mast cells, while the mast cell deficient W/Wv mice contained no detectable mast cells in either the CNS or PNS. Reconstitution of W/Wv mast cells was accomplished by intravenous injection of bone marrow cells from congenic littermates. After seven months, mast cells could be seen in both the CNS and PNS of reconstituted animals. The possibility that mast cells and mast cell precursors can migrate into the nervous system of animals, in the absence of inflammatory disease, may have implications for their role in the pathogenesis of experimental demyelinating diseases.\r"

  ".U": "91217707\r", 
  ".W": "The effect of chronic hyperglycemia and polyol pathway activation on the Schwann cell has not been resolved although injury to this cell has long been suspected in diabetic neuropathy. Hyperglycemia, resulting from galactose intoxication of four months duration, induces dose-dependent accumulations of endoneurial fluid sodium and chloride that are linked to polyol pathway activity and associated with dose-dependent increases in sciatic nerve water content, endoneurial fluid pressure and (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity. In order to understand the impact of these changes on the nerve microenvironment, cellular elements of the endoneurium were quantitatively and qualitatively assessed in rats receiving 0%, 10%, 20% or 40% galactose diets. After four months of galactose intoxication, dose-dependent changes in the size distribution of myelinated nerve fibers were apparent. A shift in size-frequency histograms of galactose-intoxicated animals towards smaller fibers was accompanied by a decrease in axon diameter and the volume fraction ratio of axon to myelinated nerve fibers. In the sciatic nerve of all 40% galactose-fed rats examined by electron microscopy, Schwann cells of myelinated fibers showed both reactive and degenerative changes. Demyelination was preceded by splitting at the intraperiod line. Remyelination was identified by axons with disproportionately thin myelin sheaths. Axonal dystrophy and degeneration were infrequently seen, but there was axonal regeneration. Dose-dependent increases in mast cell number were observed with degranulation apparent in rats receiving 20% and 40% galactose. Endothelial cell number and basal lamina thickness were increased in the endoneurial vessels of galactose-intoxicated rats. Increased cytoplasmic area and degenerative changes in pericytes were also noted. These observations indicate that significant morphologic changes accompany the hyperosmotic imbalance resulting from galactose intoxication of four months duration. Schwann cell injury and demyelination are present in a disorder linked to polyol metabolism since aldose reductase, the anabolic enzyme of the polyol pathway, is localized to this myelin-forming cell.\r"

These include axonal swellings and the death of neurons after five days. Electron microscope findings were compared between DRG grown in control medium containing 10% calf serum, DRG incubated in the same medium exposed to the blood compartment of capillary flow or plate dialyzers and DRG grown in medium supplemented with 10% dialysis patient serum. Electron microscope findings included frequent axonal swellings with the accumulations of membrane bound vesicles and the apparent disruption of microtubules. There were also conspicuous accumulations of membrane bound vesicles, dense bodies, myeloid figures, and areas of vesicular degeneration in Schwann cells. These changes were seen with dialyzer exposed medium or with medium containing patient serum but not with controls or with medium incubated in plate dialyzers. The changes were similar to those reported in nerve biopsy specimens from patients with known EO neuropathy.\r"

It is present in the midfrontal, inferior parietal, temporal, cingulate, and occipital cortices, as well as in the motor cortex. Compared to matched regions from other neurological diseases, the gliosis in ALS does not appear to be the nonspecific result of a progressive, degenerative disease. In cell number and apparent cell size, the gliosis is comparable to that present in neurological diseases known to have white matter gliosis. Cytologically, the gliosis most closely resembles that present in cases of cerebral infarction. The basis for this similarity is unknown.\r"

Patients with proven disease were treated differently in that 79% were receiving antianginal therapy and 56% were considered for catheterization (p less than 0.001). Nuclear exercise test results reduced the perceived need for catheterization in all groups, on average by 49%. Nuclear exercise tests are a standard by which patients are managed, sometimes substituting for the traditional role of the history in physician decision making.\r"

The reproducibility was inversely related to the size of 201TI perfusion abnormalities. Intraobserver variability was not different between exercise and dipyridamole studies for lesions of similar size. Based upon intraobserver variability, objective quantitative criteria for reversibility of perfusion abnormalities were defined. These objective criteria were tested prospectively in a separate group of 35 201TI studies and compared with the subjective interpretation of quantitative circumferential profiles. Overall, exact agreement existed in 78% of images (kappa statistic k = 0.66). We conclude that quantification of planar 201TI scans is highly reproducible, with acceptable inter- and intraobserver variability. Objective criteria for lesion reversibility correlated well with analysis by experienced observers.\r"

All patients had contrast venography (considered as the gold standard) and 111In-AF scintigraphy within 24 hr. Two to 3 mCi of 111In-AF were injected intravenously, and planar scintigraphy of the limbs was recorded within 10 min (17 times), 3 hr (44 times), and 18 hr (39 times). Indium-111-AF images were then interpreted without knowledge of the results of the other examinations. The DVT diagnostic accuracy of 111In-AF was greater when interpretation was based on images recorded at different time periods after injection. Indium-111-AF sensitivity for diagnosis of DVT was 85% (29/34) and was not apparently decreased by heparin therapy. None of the 10 patients with negative contrast venography had a positive 111In-AF scan. The results demonstrate the importance of recording serial images and the excellent accuracy of 111In-AF for diagnosing DVT.\r"

Thirty-six subjects, (19 volunteers and 17 patients) underwent repetitive bicycle exercise using sequences of both VEST monitoring and gamma camera imaging. A high intraclass correlation was noted for both absolute ejection fraction [0.84 (0.56, 0.95)] and delta ejection fraction [0.87 (0.63, 0.96)] during repeat VEST monitoring. The intraclass correlation for ejection fraction was comparable for data averaged over 30 sec versus 2 min. These correlations compared favorably to those obtained for assessment of absolute and delta ejection fraction as derived by gamma camera determination by the same computer operator (intraobserver variability), two different computer operators (interobserver variability), and during repeat exercise using gamma camera imaging. In concordance, correlations between VEST and gamma camera measurements were relatively high for both absolute ejection fraction (0.78 [0.61, 0.88]) and delta ejection fraction (0.63 [0.39, 0.79]). Thus, the VEST represents a reproducible means of measuring ejection fraction change during dynamic physical activity. Its accuracy in ejection fraction measurements is similar to gamma camera imaging during exercise testing.\r"

Both 111In-WBC and 99mTc-IDA scintigraphy accurately detected acute cholecystitis: hepatobiliary scintigraphy demonstrated a cystic duct obstruction and 111In-WBC imaging detected the inflammatory infiltrate within the gallbladder wall.

Dose estimates to the bladder, gonads, marrow, thyroid, uterus, and whole body were estimated for maximum thyroid uptakes from 20% to 100%. Bladder dose varied from 0.6 to 1.0 mGy/MBq and dose to the uterus varied from 0.036 to 0.063 mGy/MBq under different model assumptions. Dose estimates to the fetus and fetal thyroid were approximated at all stages of pregnancy. Average fetal dose was a maximum between 0 and 2 mo of pregnancy, with the maximum ranging from 0.048 mGy/MBq to 0.083 mGy/MBq, depending on model assumptions. Some radiation risks for irradiation of the fetus and the fetal thyroid are discussed.\r"

The brain uptake index and the brain slice studies indicated the affinity of I-L-AMT for carrier-mediated and stereoselective active transport systems, respectively; both operating across the blood-brain barrier and cell membranes of the brain. The tissue homogenate analysis revealed that most of the accumulated radioactivity belonged to intact I-L-AMT, an indication of its stability.

To increase the specific radioactivity of Ga-DF-IgG, we used dialdehyde starch (DAS) as a multi-site spacer for the binding of DF to IgG. Six DF molecules bound to each IgG molecule after DAS conjugation. DF-DAS-IgG was then labeled with the previously reported 67Ga labeling solution, producing labeled IgG with a specific radioactivity of 11,766 MBq/mg IgG. Using this method, we labeled an anti-CA125 tumor-associated antigen monoclonal antibody (130-22), allowing the first application of 67Ga-DF-DAS-IgG to an IRMA system. With this system, a higher sensitivity could be obtained than with 125I IRMA. In addition, a very high correlation (r = 0.995) was obtained between serum CA125 levels as determined by 67Ga IRMA and 125I IRMA. Gallium-67-labeled antibodies with a high-specific radioactivity appear to hold promise for use in highly sensitive radioassay systems.\r"

To determine absorbed doses to the blood and to the surface of the blood vessel wall, EGS4 Monte Carlo calculations were performed. Absorbed doses were calculated for the blood and the blood vessel wall (lumen) for different blood vessels sizes. The radionuclides chosen for this study were those commonly used in nuclear medicine. No penetration of the radionuclide into the blood vessel was assumed nor was cross fire between the vessel assumed. The results are useful in assessing the dose to blood and blood vessel walls for different nuclear medicine procedures.\r"

Commonly, in absorbed dose calculations for internally deposited beta-emitting radionuclides, it is assumed that the absorbed fraction of energy for the mean beta energy is a sufficient representation of the beta spectrum. The accuracy of this assumption was tested by comparing absorbed fractions calculated using actual beta spectral energies with those obtained using the mean beta energy for several radionuclides commonly used in nuclear medicine. A sphere composed of tissue was chosen as the preferred geometry. Spheres of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 cm radius were used, and absorbed fractions were calculated as a function of surface-to-volume ratios. This allows the assessment of absorbed fraction in spheres where there is a uniform distribution of a radionuclide.\r"

Both uniform surface and volume distribution of the radioactivity are considered. The key findings of the calculations can be stated in terms of the MIRD \"S-factors\" for red bone marrow and the endosteal layer of cells on bone surfaces. In particular, the S-factor for red bone marrow is either 0.0276 mGy/MBq.h or 0.0077 mGy/MBq.h for surface and volume distributed radioactivity, respectively. For the endosteal layer of thickness (10 microns) on bone surfaces, the corresponding values are 0.0723 mGy/MBq.h and 0.0213 mGy/MBq.h, respectively.\r"

The radiopharmaceutical is identical with a chemically characterized sample of [99TcO(DMSA)2]- when studied by mobility methods including thin-layer chromatography, reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, gel filtration, and electrophoresis. The technetium is pentavalent and coordinated by an oxo-ligand and four thiolate sulfurs of two DMSA ligands. No-carrier-added preparations consist of mixtures of three stereoisomers of the square pyramidal, mononuclear complex. The isomers arise from differing orientations of the carboxylate groups in the DMSA ligands and may be designated syn-endo, syn-exo, and anti. All three isomers are significant components of the radiopharmaceutical, raising the question of which are tumor-specific. The carboxylate groups in the complex are almost completely ionized at pH 7, thus the average charge on the complex at this pH approaches -5.\r"

To optimize the quality of radionuclide measurements of ventricular function in small animals, a comparison was made of gated blood-pool scans recorded with five blood-pool radiopharmaceuticals (99mTc-labeled human polyclonal IgG, 99mTc-human serum albumin labeled by two methods, and red blood cells radiolabeled with 99mTc via in vivo and in vitro methods) in rats and three pinhole apertures in hamsters. The quality of the radiopharmaceuticals was evaluated by comparing count density ratios (LV/BACKGROUND and LV/LIVER) and ejection fractions recorded with each agent. The edge definition of the left ventricle and count rate performance of the 1-, 2-, and 3-mm apertures was evaluated in hamsters. In general, the images obtained with the radiolabeled cells were superior to those obtained with the labeled proteins and no significant differences between the protein preparations were detected. Left ventricular ejection fractions calculated with all five radiopharmaceuticals were not significantly different. The best quality images were obtained with the 1-mm pinhole collimator. Ejection fraction and acquisition time were inversely related to aperture size. A good compromise between resolution and sensitivity was obtained with the 2-mm pinhole collimator.\r"

  ".W": "The cause of 180-degree diametrical artifactual defects in clinical thallium-201 SPECT imaging was investigated using phantom simulation. This artifact was observed on SPECT images acquired with a \"body contour\" or \"peanut\" orbit. It was hypothesized that this artifact was caused by differences in spatial resolution that occur when the heart-to-detector distance changes employing noncircular orbits. To test this hypothesis, a series of planar static images of a normal cylindrical phantom was obtained at varying distances from the camera detector head. From these images, tomographic acquisition files were created that simulated tomographic data acquired with circular orbits and elliptical orbits. The reconstructed phantom short-axis slices showed no artifacts for circular orbits. However, for various elliptical orbits, significant regional nonuniformity, similar to the artifacts noted in patients, was observed. The degree of nonuniformity correlated with the long-short axis ratio of elliptical orbits (r = 0.98). In addition, circular orbits with the phantom in an eccentric position resulted in similar nonuniformities. It is concluded that a noncircular tomographic orbit can create characteristic artifacts on thallium-201 SPECT images. For rotational thallium 201 SPECT, a circular orbit with the heart in the center of rotation should be employed.\r"

After incubation with dilute HCl (pH 1.4) at 37 degrees C for 3 hr, approximately 5% of the total radioactivity eluted into the aqueous phase. When incubated with human gastric juice (pH 1.8 and 2.2), approximately 8% of the activity was detected in the aqueous phase at 3 hr. Scintigraphic studies performed in two rabbits showed that olive oil labeled with 99mTc(V)thiocyanate emptied slowly from the stomach, with a gastric half-emptying time (T50) of more than 3 hr. A low-nutrient soup labeled with 113mIn-DTPA and mixed with 99mTc(V)thiocyanate labeled oil was consumed by six human volunteers. The oil emptied much more slowly (p less than 0.02) (median T50 = 198 min) than the aqueous component (median T50 = 30 min). These observations indicate that 99mTc(V)thiocyanate is a suitable pharmaceutical to measure gastric emptying of extracellular fat.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To assess practice trends in the general internal medicine departments of large multispecialty clinics. DESIGN: A survey questionnaire addressing the following issues: 1) department size and rate of growth, 2) services provided, 3) patient population, 4) individual clinical workload, 5) call arrangements, 6) time away from practice, and 7) benefits and salary. PARTICIPANTS: 22 multispecialty clinics, with a mean of 279 physicians. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Mean general internal medicine department physician expansion was 28% over the preceding three years. Primary care, clinic system access, care of patients laterally shifted from subspecialty internists, and preoperative evaluations were the four major services provided. The mix of fee-for-service, Medicare/Medicaid, and prepaid-plan patients was diverse. Mean outpatient clinical scheduling was 35 hours per week exclusive of hospital practice, administrative time, and paperwork. Study of call arrangements revealed a definite trend toward a group practice model of shared responsibility during the day as well as nights and weekends. Mean meeting and vacation time was 35 days per year. Salary was set by committee, formula, or both. Department stresses and dissatisfactions were also reported. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid expansion of general internal medicine departments and services will continue as subspecialists back away from providing primary care. The evolution of general internal medicine practice must be anticipated and managed for optimal patient and departmental outcomes.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk factors for left atrial thrombus (LAT) and the prevalence of thrombi in cases of mitral valve disease whose severity was judged to necessitate surgical intervention. DESIGN: Hospital record review of all operative cases from 1982 to 1985. SETTING: A community serving a referral population encompassing 1.5 million people. Only two hospitals in the geographic area performed cardiac surgery, and both hospitals' records were reviewed. PATIENTS: All 372 patients who underwent either mitral valve replacement or open mitral commissurotomy. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-six patients (7%) were noted to have LAT at surgery. Five preselected factors were significantly (p less than 0.05) associated with LAT in univariate analysis: female gender, prior history of embolism, prior anticoagulant therapy, mitral stenosis (MS), and atrial fibrillation (AF). In logistic regression analysis, only MS and AF remained as significant independent predictors of LAT. Mitral stenosis patients in sinus rhythm had a relatively low [2.4 +/- 3.3% (observed +/- 95% confidence interval)] likelihood of having an LAT. Likewise, mitral regurgitation patients in sinus rhythm (n = 139) had an extremely low (0.7 +/- 1.4%) prevalence of LAT. In contrast, MS patients in AF (n = 122) had a prevalence of LAT of 18.0 +/- 6.8%. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that, overall, LAT in mitral valve disease may be less common than previous studies have suggested. In addition, mitral valve disease patients who remain in sinus rhythm appear to have a low risk of harboring an LAT. Conversely, MS patients, especially those in AF, appear to be at high risk of harboring an LAT. These results may be helpful in formulating strategies for the use of prophylactic anticoagulation in categories of patients with clinically severe mitral valve disease, or perhaps in estimating the likelihood of a cardiac source of embolism in mitral valve disease patients with suspected cerebral or peripheral emboli.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To develop and validate a predictive model that would allow clinicians to determine whether an electrophysiologic (EP) study is likely to result in useful diagnostic information for a patient who has unexplained syncope. PATIENTS: One hundred seventy-nine consecutive patients with unexplained syncope who underwent EP studies at two university medical centers comprised the training sample. A test sample to validate the model was made up of 138 patients from the clinical literature who had undergone EP studies for syncope. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of patients undergoing EP studies for syncope. The data collector was blinded to the study hypothesis; the electrophysiologist assessing outcomes was blinded to clinical and historical data. Clinical predictor variables available from the history, the physical examination, electrocardiography (ECG), and Holter monitoring were analyzed via two multivariable predictive modeling strategies (ordinal logistic regression and recursive partitioning) for their abilities to predict the results of EP studies, namely tachyarrhythmic and bradyarrhythmic outcomes. These categories were further divided into full arrhythmia and borderline arrhythmia groups. RESULTS: Important outcomes were 1) sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) and 2) bradyarrhythmias, including sinus node and atrioventricular (AV) conducting disease. The results of the logistic regression (in this study, the superior strategy) showed that the presence of organic heart disease [odds ratio (OR) = 3.0, p less than 0.001] and frequent premature ventricular contractions on ECG (OR = 6.7, p less than 0.004) were associated with VT, while the following abnormal ECG findings were associated with bradyarrhythmias: first-degree heart block (OR = 7.9, p less than 0.001), bundle-branch block (OR = 3.0, p less than 0.02), and sinus bradycardia (OR = 3.5, p less than 0.03). Eighty-seven percent of the 31 patients with important outcomes at EP study had at least one of these clinical risk factors, while 95% of the patients with none of these risk factors had normal or nondiagnostic EP studies. In the validation sample, the presence of one or more risk factors would have correctly identified 88% of the test VT patients and 65% of the test bradyarrhythmia patients as needing EP study. CONCLUSION: These five identified predictive factors, available from the history, the physical examination, and the initial ECG, could be useful to clinicians in selecting those patients with unexplained syncope who will have a serious arrhythmia identified by EP studies.\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective chart audit one year after high (greater than 240 mg/dL) cholesterol level. PATIENTS: 257 (243 after exclusions) consecutive patients with serum cholesterol levels greater than 240 mg/dL. SETTING: Primary care practice of group-model university-based HMO. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS: In the one-year interval following the index elevated cholesterol level, 67% of 243 patients had received documented dietary counseling, 53% had had a follow-up cholesterol test, and 8% were started on drug treatment. Only two patients (1.8%) without a history of hypercholesterolemia prior to the index level were started on drug treatment, compared with 18 patients (15%) with such a history. The odds (and 95% confidence intervals) of patient dietary counseling increased twofold (1.35 to 2.95) for each 25-mg/dL increment in serum cholesterol, and by 1.45 times (1.12 to 1.87) for each additional coronary risk factor. Patients who had high cholesterol levels obtained as isolated determinations had 2.46 times (1.32 to 4.64) higher odds of being followed by counseling than did those whose levels had been obtained as part of a chemistry panel. CONCLUSIONS: Compliance with National Cholesterol Education Panel guidelines for dietary counseling, but not drug therapy, was higher in this setting than in other published compliance studies. Quality assurance monitoring of compliance with dietary counseling and obtaining lipid measurements using a threshold approach are suggested. A similar approach to drug therapy of hypercholesterolemia appears premature.\r"

DESIGN: Paired case-control comparisons of the relative frequencies of visual impairment in demented cases and nondemented controls. Cohort analyses of correlation between visual acuity and cognitive functioning in demented cases. SETTING: Internal medicine clinics at two academically affiliated medical centers. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-seven consecutively selected patients greater than or equal to 65 years of age with mild-to-moderate, clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (cases) and 87 nondemented controls matched to the cases by age, sex, and education. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The prevalence of visual impairment was higher in cases than in controls [unadjusted odds ratio for near-vision impairment = 2.7 (95% CI = 1.4, 5.2); unadjusted odds ratio for far-vision impairment = 2.1 (95% CI = 1.02, 4.3); odds ratios adjusted for family history of dementia, depression, number of medications, and hearing loss were 2.5 (95% CI = 1.1, 10.5) for near-vision impairment and 1.9 (95% CI = 0.8, 4.6) for far-vision impairment]. When further stratified by quartiles of visual acuity, no statistically significant \"dose-response\" relationship between vision impairment and dementia risk was observed. Among cases, the degree of visual impairment was significantly correlated with the severity of cognitive dysfunction for both near and far vision (adjusted ps less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Visual impairment is associated with both an increased risk and an increased clinical severity of Alzheimer's disease, but the increased risk may not be consistent with a progressive dose-response relationship. Further studies are needed to determine whether visual impairment unmasks and exacerbates the symptoms of dementia or is a marker of disease severity.\r"

DESIGN: 292 patients were randomized into three (3) groups: Control (n = 88); simple notification of primary care provider (n = 102); intensive notification, provision of pharmacy profiles, compliance index, and chart review by senior clinician with recommendations (n = 104). SETTING: Veterans Affairs Medical Center affiliated with the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: All patients receiving greater than ten (10) active medications who are followed by clinic staff at the Denver VAMC. The mean age was 62 years (range 26-88) and 96% were male. INTERVENTIONS: The simple notification group received only a single letter recommending that the patient's number of medications be reduced. The intensive notification group received more sophisticated intervention with a chart review, two letters with calculation of patient compliance, and individualized suggestions for reduction in polypharmacy. The control group received no intervention. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Control patients had significantly less reduction in polypharmacy then either the simple or intensive intervention groups at four months (p = 0.028). There was no significant difference between the intervention groups (p = 0.189). By six months the difference was no longer significant. CONCLUSIONS: A simple intervention can result in a significant reduction in the number of medications prescribed to patients with polypharmacy. The authors were unable to show that a more complex intervention resulted in a further reduction in polypharmacy.\r"

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There was no correlation between mean student interest scores for the topics and either immediate or end-of-rotation lecturer evaluation scores (R = -0.14 and 0.09 and p = 0.47 and 0.61, respectively). For 20 of 30 topics (66%) more than 50% of the students assigned the same level of high, intermediate, or low interest. There was no significant difference (p = 0.84) in the mean lecturer evaluation scores for these three divergent groups. Analysis of individual lecturers' evaluation scores revealed stratification to a given range independent of student interest in the topic. CONCLUSIONS: Students do not appear to be biased by their degree of interest in a subject when evaluating teaching skills. It appears unlikely that specific teaching assignments need to be considered when evaluating competence in didactic teaching.\r"

Subjects completed a socio-demographic survey at the conclusion of training, and faculty-assigned clinical ranks and examination scores were used to rate their clinical performances. MAIN RESULTS: Personal characteristics had a stronger relationship to psychological states during the first training year than in subsequent years. The highest association was found for depression, for which 25% of the variation was accounted for by personal characteristics. The combination of personal characteristics and psychological states explained 48% of the variation in clinical ranks and 38% of the variation in American Board of Internal Medicine certifying examination scores. CONCLUSION: There are recognizable relationships among the personal characteristics of residents, their psychologic states during training, and their clinical performances. These results should be helpful to program directors and faculty in identifying potentially weak residents and avoiding pitfalls when working with troubled residents.\r"

DESIGN: Evaluations were gathered three times during the 1987-88 academic year. Generalizability coefficients (interpreted like traditional reliability coefficients) were generated to establish the form's reliability, while data from attending physicians and from housestaff evaluation committee members were used to help establish its validity. SETTING: Three hospitals in central Ohio: a large university tertiary care center, a large private hospital, and an urban community hospital. PARTICIPANTS: The nurse raters were volunteers solicited by their head nurses. The criteria governing their participation were two years of postgraduate experience in nursing and regular contact with residents, which was self-determined. All IM residents who had worked on a medicine inpatient service at least once during the months under study were included. A total of 493 nurses and 116 residents participated. RESULTS: Sixty-four percent of the generalizability coefficients were 0.90 or higher, and 82% were above 0.75, indicating stable, reliable ratings. The nurses' ratings were positively and significantly correlated with attending faculty's and evaluation committee members' ratings (r = 0.38, p less than 0.01; r = 0.49, p less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation form and the nurses provided consistent, reliable information about medical residents' humanistic behavior; data from five to six nurses should provide statistically reliable ratings using this form. Also, nurses' data yielded information somewhat different from those provided by physicians, suggesting that the form is a useful instrument for assessing this dimension of residents' performance.\r"

  ".W": "A fatal immunodeficiency syndrome with clinical and pathologic features similar to human AIDS is inducible in cats by experimental inoculation with a specific strain of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) called FeLV-FAIDS. The course of the feline disease is characterized by an age-dependent prodromal period during which a non-disease-specific, common form of proviral DNA is detected in bone marrow. Preceding clinical onset of immunodeficiency is production of high levels of specific, pathogenic variant genomes, primarily as unintegrated viral DNA, in bone marrow. Acute immunodeficiency syndrome (survival period approximately 3 months) is associated with a short prodromal period and appearance of a characteristic variant genome (variant A) that persists at high copy number as integrated and full-length unintegrated viral DNA in bone marrow. Chronic immunodeficiency syndrome (survival greater than 1 year) is marked by a longer prodromal period, a more gradual onset of severe clinical immunosuppression, and a predominance of other variant genomes that often contain substantial internal deletions. In both forms of the disease, tissue-specific replication of certain variant viruses is noted in the bone marrow, intestine, and lymph nodes. Evidence from in vitro and in vivo virus transmission studies indicates that the appearance of FeLV-FAIDS variant viruses reflects differential replication of viral genomes pre-existing in the inoculum rather than rapid de novo evolution of new variants within each animal. These results demonstrate that retrovirus-induced immunodeficiency disease in cats can be associated with and prefigured by the amplified replication of specific viral variants in target tissues.\r"

  ".U": "91217915\r", 
  ".W": "The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Rev protein is a positive posttranscriptional regulator of viral structural gene expression and essential for virus replication. Rev mediates its effects through interaction with an RNA target sequence, the Rev responsive element (RRE), present within the env mRNA. Previous studies have shown that the basic stretch of amino acids are required for Rev's ability to bind RNA, whereas residues present near the carboxy terminus are essential for full biological activity. Deletion mutagenesis was used to define the minimal domain required for RNA binding and function. We found that amino acids 8 through 67 confer full binding activity, whereas full biological activity requires the presence of residues 8 through 83. The minimal RNA binding sequence of HIV-1 Rev also interacts and functions with the HIV-2 and SIV RRE elements, indicating that the same domain is responsible for the biological activity with different, but related viruses. Mutational analysis of the RRE was also carried out in an effort to further define elements crucial for its function. Our findings indicate that interaction with Rev involves a stretch of three G nucleotides present at the base of a stem loop structure previously shown to be critical for Rev binding. These results suggest that the high degree of secondary structure of the RRE RNA may serve as a guide to bring Rev in contact with a primary nucleotide sequence required for stable protein-RNA association.\r"

  ".W": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is characterized by a progressive impairment in immunocompetence leading to severe opportunistic infections and malignancies. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the potential impact of immunomodulation by oral ranitidine, 600 mg daily, for 28 days was studied in 18 HIV-positive patients (CDC group II). All were without clinical signs of infections and were not treated with other known immunomodulating agents. Several immunological parameters related to HIV infection were studied and confirmed to be impaired early in HIV infection. Spontaneous and in vitro interleukin-2- and interferon-alpha-stimulated natural killer cell activity improved in the ranitidine-treated patients in contrast to a decrease in nontreated patients (#p less than 0.03, #p less than 0.01, #p less than 0.02 between groups, respectively). Furthermore, T-cell blastogenesis to phytohemagglutinin stimulation and soluble interleukin-2 receptors in serum increased in ranitidine-treated patients compared with nontreated patients (#p less than 0.01). However, ranitidine treatment did not change CD4+ cell counts. Although the significant improvement in immunocompetence shown in this study is small, the present result indicates the need for further trials with immunomodulation by ranitidine in HIV-infected individuals.\r"

  ".W": "The ventricular area at the level of the foramen of Monro was measured from axial x-ray computed tomography (CT) scans obtained prior to and 6 months after the initiation of continuous infusion of zidovudine (ZDV) in eight children with human immunodeficiency virus-induced encephalopathy. Evidence of moderate to severe central atrophy was present on initial CT scans (p less than 0.05). Ventricular area and ventricular brain area ratio (VBR) decreased after ZDV therapy in seven of eight children (mean decrease of 21.5 and 20%, respectively, p less than 0.05). The degree of decrease in VBR correlated with reductions in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein concentration (r = 0.93, p less than 0.01), but not lymphocyte T4 or T8 counts. Intelligence quotients (IQs) improved in all seven children tested (mean improvement of 17.7%, p less than 0.01) and correlated significantly with reductions in CSF protein concentration (r = -0.85, p = 0.003). The magnitude of IQ changes was not significantly correlated with the magnitude of changes in ventricular area. We conclude that the cognitive improvement of HIV encephalopathy seen after 6 months of continuous infusion of ZDV is accompanied by reduction in brain atrophy and decreased CSF protein, suggesting an ameliorating effect of ZDV on the pathogenesis of AIDS encephalopathy in children.\r"

In order to determine the role of erythropoietin (EPO) response as a cause of the anemia, serum levels were determined by direct radioimmunoassay in 110 symptomatic patients with various stages of HIV infection. Symptomatic patients (ARC and AIDS) not receiving zidovudine (ZDV) therapy demonstrated a strong inverse relationship between serum EPO and hemoglobin levels (p = 0.01 and p less than 0.001, respectively). Patients with AIDS who were anemic while receiving ZDV demonstrated serum EPO levels that ranged from normal to markedly elevated (9-3,390 mU/ml). The diversity of serum EPO levels in patients with HIV infection and anemia suggests that the etiology of anemia in these patients and their potential response to recombinant human EPO may not be uniform.\r"

Campylobacter infection was reported in 29 (0.7%) of 4,433 AIDS cases. The average annual incidence of Campylobacter among AIDS cases (519/100,000) exceeded the crude population rate by 39-fold and exceeded the rate among males aged 15-55 years by 35-fold. Campylobacter infection was more common in female AIDS patients than male patients (p = 0.065). A distinct seasonal variation was noted with peaks occurring in July and November. The median survival time for AIDS patients with Campylobacter (14 months) was lower than that for AIDS patients without Campylobacter (21 months); however, we were not able to assess potential confounders such as subsequent opportunistic infections or antiviral therapy and prophylactic regiment to validate this finding. Campylobacter cases with AIDS had higher rates of bacteremia and hospitalization than Campylobacter cases without AIDS. Attempts should be made to elucidate the sources of Campylobacter and other enteric infections among AIDS patients.\r"

HIV-infected patients may have impaired phagocytic function as a result of antiretroviral therapy or treatment of opportunistic infection, or due to HIV infection itself.

In addition to estimating the frequency of HIV-1 infection and of risk factors related to drug use, the study estimated the temporal gap between relevant events in the drug history of each subject. Forty-eight centers participated, representing 16 of the 20 Italian regions. Among 1,038/1,348 subjects, 395 (38%) were carriers of HIV-1 antibodies. Seropositivity was related to the length of heroin use (with the risk of being seropositive increasing by 1% for each month of use), to frequency of sharing injection equipment, and to sexual intercourse with a seropositive partner. Women were more likely to have shared injection equipment and to have engaged in sexual intercourse with seropositive partners. Most subjects began sharing injection equipment within a year of initiating drug use, and the median temporal gap between first drug use and first visit to a drug dependency center was 5 years. A high proportion of both seropositive (87%) and seronegative (74%) subjects reported the adoption of safer drug-use practices. In both groups many behavioral changes (38%) were reported to have been introduced before the initial HIV test. These findings confirm that efforts to reduce HIV infection among drug users in Italy will need to concentrate both on prevention of drug use and on early intervention to reduce high-risk behaviors.\r"

Seroprevalence rates among samples in six cities ranged from 2% to 25%. In multiple logistic regression models controlling for city, insertive/receptive behavior (IRB), and meeting partners in bathhouses, the following were independently related to seropositivity (p less than 0.05): city, IRB, syphilis, sex with a person with AIDS, and meeting partners in bathouses. The independent risks associated with categories of IRB were no or almost no activity (odds ratio 1.0), only insertive (3.0), mostly insertive (4.9), mixed (6.0), mostly receptive (3.3), and only receptive (0.9). The condom use rate on last sexual encounter was 30%. The main sexual risk for HIV-1 infection is not exclusively receptive anal sex, but rather mixed behavior. This association may be explained by the infectious state of the partner pools. The sociologic risk variables (national and local partner pools) are better predictors of seroprevalence than behavioral variables, such as the number of partners or use of condoms. These results imply that more effective individual strategies for risk reduction are needed, including better knowledge concerning the risk status of partners.\r"

An additional 33 (2%) sera displayed some reactivity to HIV-2-infected cells by IF. All 33 sera were subsequently tested in HIV-1 and HIV-2 Western blots as well as an ELISA using HIV-1- or HIV-2-specific peptides. All sera were confirmed as positive for HIV-1 and negative for HIV-2 antibodies in both assays. We conclude that caution should be used in the interpretation of serologic cross-reactivity between HIV-1 and HIV-2 and that there is no evidence that HIV-2 has entered groups at risk for HIV infection in Brazil.\r"

Immunophenotypic analyses of peripheral blood lymphocytes from nine anti-HTLV-positive recipients, assumed to be infected during or since late 1984, showed no significant changes from healthy controls.

All 15 infants with congenital heart block and NLE had both anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies. Of 8 patients with cutaneous NLE alone, 2 had anti-Ro antibodies alone while the remaining 6 had both anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies. One woman gave birth to 2 children; one had both Ro and La antibodies and developed congenital heart block, the other had only anti-Ro and anti-U1RNP antibodies and was clinically normal. Our study demonstrates that the presence of anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies define the immune response that is associated with the development of congenital heart block of NLE.\r"

Independent variables, measured in 1984, include years of schooling, age, age squared, sex, labor force status, occupation, marital status, race, income, sedimentation rate, log latex, number of tender joints, and duration of illness. A negative association between schooling and the disability index is strongly apparent for men and weaker in women. Results for men persist even after adjustment for occupation and income, but not after additional adjustment for biological variables. The effects of schooling upon progression of RA are complex and interpretation requires simultaneous assessment of a variety of other variables. Causal effects of level of schooling are seen with a social science perspective which considers the biologic data to represent dependent variables yet cannot be inferred from a clinical model which considers the biology of the disease as an independent variable.\r"

Pain in the lower extremity, and the knee or hindfoot separately, showed correlations with functional ambulation. Foot deformity did not correlate with functional ambulation at all. Foot pain correlated well with velocity and especially stride length (p less than 0.005), and not as well with cadence and double stance time. Fewer correlations were seen between foot deformity and gait. In general, hindfoot disease was associated with greater impairment of gait and mobility than forefoot disease.\r"

The following conclusions may be drawn from a study of 1331 consecutive patients with AS: the prevalence of uveitis was 40% (535 subjects), almost half of whom had greater than 5 attacks. Family studies of sib pairs, concordant for AS, showed that uveitis occurred randomly with a concordance for uveitis/no uveitis of only 43%. A comparison of patients with (n = 535) and without (n = 796) uveitis showed no important differences. Analysis of potential trigger factors among 72 patients with recurrent disease revealed no seasonal, infective or other correlation. The removal of an intrauterine device from a woman with severe intractable bilateral uveitis was associated with remission of the eye disease. In summary, although genetic background determines susceptibility to uveitis the pattern of the disease suggests the possibility of random environmental triggers unrelated to the course of the underlying rheumatological disorder.\r"

In clinic interviews with patients of PHN showed modest, but significant, increases in 14 of 16 target behaviors attributable to inservice education. Because measured arthritis impact was low in this older adult population, physician referral rates were not affected by either intervention.

  ".W": "Agents used to treat rheumatoid arthritis were examined for their ability to modify synovial fluid phospholipase A2 (SF-PLA2) activity. Nonsteroidal or steroidal antiinflammatory drugs and disease modifying agents exhibited little or no PLA2 modulatory activity. The exceptions include weak inhibition displayed by the cyclooxygenase inhibitors, indomethacin (IC50 = 144.8 microM) and sulindac sulfide (30.2 microM) and a 5-lipoxygenase translocation inhibitor, MK-886 (IC50 = 50 microM). Cyclosporine potentiated acylhydrolysis (EC50 = 1.5 microM) whereas the other immunomodulators examined demonstrated no significant effect on SF-PLA2 activity. Our data show that there are no selective PLA2 inhibitors currently used in the treatment of human arthritic disease and the viability of this novel approach remains to be tested.\r"

  ".W": "Understanding the dissolution mechanisms involved in calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals may prove important for the development of therapy for CPPD arthropathy. We demonstrate that yeast pyrophosphatase effectively dissolved CPPD crystals in solutions. Maximum enzymatic dissolution of CPPD crystals was achieved at neutral pH and when the enzyme had access to the crystal surface. The enzymatic dissolution of CPPD crystals was highly dependent on ambient [Mg++] and [Ca++]. The stimulating effects of Mg++ on crystal dissolution in the presence of the enzyme is due to stimulation of pyrophosphatase activity and to enhanced direct release of pyrophosphate ions from the crystal surface. The inhibiting effect of Ca++ on crystal dissolution by the enzyme is mainly due to the suppression of pyrophosphatase activity.\r"

  ".W": "We present evidence supporting the hypothesis that locally produced platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) B-like polypeptides, as well as heparin binding growth factor-1 (HBGF-1), are involved in stimulating the pronounced hyperplasia of rheumatoid synovial stromal fibroblastlike cells. Explanted rheumatoid synovial tissues in vitro spontaneously secreted, in a time dependent manner, mitogenic activity for rheumatoid synoviocytes that was neutralizable by anti-PDGF antibody. PDGF B/c-sis mRNA transcripts were detected in synovium from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (n = 5). Spontaneous PDGF B-like synthesis was detected by immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled PDGF B-like polypeptides secreted by explanted tissues. Furthermore, rheumatoid synovial tissues, particularly macrophage-like cells, immunostained specifically with anti-PDGF B chain. The extent and intensity of staining and mononuclear cell infiltration were highly correlated. Immunostaining of osteoarthritic and normal synovial tissues was significantly less than RA synovium. PDGF-B immunostaining of synovial specimens previously characterized for expression of HBGF-1, the precursor of acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF), revealed that the extent and intensity of expression of HBGF-1 and PDGF-B were highly correlated.\r"

Compared with the patients in the physical therapy group, the patients in the hypnotherapy group showed a significantly better outcome with respect to their pain experience, fatigue on awakening, sleep pattern and global assessment at 12 and 24 weeks, but this was not reflected in an improvement of the total myalgic score measured by a dolorimeter. At baseline most patients in both groups had strong feelings of somatic and psychic discomfort as measured by the Hopkins Symptom Checklist. These feelings showed a significant decrease in patients treated by hypnotherapy compared with physical therapy, but they remained abnormally strong in many cases. We conclude hypnotherapy may be useful in relieving symptoms in patients with refractory fibromyalgia.\r"
