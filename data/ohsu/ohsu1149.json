  ".W": "To explore the role of calcium channels in hypertension, dihydropyridine ([3H]PN200-110) binding to heart, brain, and skeletal muscle microsomes of 4-, 8- and 15-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats was measured. At a constant Ca2+ ion concentration (pCa 3.0), maximal binding (Bmax) of dihydropyridine binding to heart and brain microsomes was significantly enhanced in 8- and 15-week-old SHR compared with WKY rats (p less than 0.01), whereas this phenomenon was not observed in 4-week-old SHR and WKY rats. Bmax and dissociation constant (Kd) values for skeletal muscle microsomes from SHR showed no difference compared with WKY rats irrespective of age. Dihydropyridine binding to heart microsomes, brain microsomes, and solubilized skeletal muscle microsomes exhibited strong calcium dependence. The Ca2(+)-dependent dihydropyridine binding curves for heart showed a Hill slope, and pK 0.5 values for 15-week-old SHR and WKY rats were 0.70 +/- 0.12 and 4.66 +/- 0.12 versus 0.72 +/- 0.12 and 5.66 +/- 0.08 (n = 4, mean +/- SD), respectively, indicating that 15-week-old SHR require 10-fold higher calcium concentration than WKY rats to promote dihydropyridine binding. The pK 0.5 values of calcium for brain and solubilized skeletal muscle calcium channels in 15-week-old SHR were also significantly lower than in WKY rats. This difference first became apparent in SHR and WKY rats as early as 4 and 8 weeks after birth. These results suggest that enhancement of calcium channel density might occur in the heart and brain of SHR in response to elevated blood pressure and that reduced calcium sensitivity of dihydropyridine binding to calcium channels might be a primary characteristic of this rat strain.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the mechanisms responsible for the postpartum suppression of reproductive function, LH and PRL levels were determined at 10-min intervals for 8 h in 10 lactating women, in 10 nonlactating women treated with bromocriptine, and in 5 nonpuerperal women. The lactating women were studied on postpartum day 7 (n = 5) or between days 28 and 35 (n = 5). All nonlactating women were studied on day 7. Five of them were treated with the opioid antagonist naltrexone to evaluate the role of endogenous opioids. By using a specific LH assay which does not cross-react with hCG, we were able to measure pulsatile LH secretion in the early puerperium for the first time. On day 7, LH levels were below the detection limit in both lactating and nonlactating women, hence no pulses could be detected. Chronic opioid blockade in bromocriptine-treated non-lactating women did not result in increased LH levels. Pulsatile LH secretion was present between days 28 and 35 of lactation, although pulse amplitude (P less than 0.05) and mean LH level (P less than 0.05) were lower than in nonpuerperal women. Mean LH in lactating women was negatively correlated with mean PRL (-0.87, P less than 0.05). Deconvolution analysis of the PRL responses to suckling revealed that PRL was secreted in distinct bursts, separated by intervals of secretory quiescence. Mean duration of PRL bursts was 40 +/- 4 min and the maximum secretory rate was reached around the end of suckling. We conclude that pulsatile LH secretion is completely suppressed during early lactation and partially suppressed during late lactation. Because the duration of suckling was similar, the relatively strong suppression during the early puerperium must be due to additional inhibitory factors. It has been suggested that endogenous opioids are involved in this process, but our results in puerperal women do not support this hypothesis.\r"

  ".W": "Several recent observations suggest that atrial natriuretic peptides (ANP) can modulate steroidogenesis in isolated rat Leydig cells. At present, it is unknown whether ANP influence human testicular steroidogenesis. We therefore evaluated the effects of alpha-human ANP (hANP) administration on testosterone plasma levels in peripheral and internal spermatic venous blood of young men (catheterized for contrast study of varicocele). Six subjects were injected with 100 micrograms alpha-hANP in the cubital vein. Six different patients similarly received 50 micrograms LHRH. Three controls received 2 ml saline. Plasma LH, FSH, and testosterone were then determined 15 min before, at time of injection, and 15, 30, 45, and 60 min thereafter in spermatic vein and peripheral venous blood, as well as at 120 min in peripheral blood. LHRH--induced LH increase was followed by a marked increase of spermatic vein testosterone concentrations, but the peripheral testosterone concentration did not increase. Similarly, alpha-hANP administration did not affect peripheral testosterone and LH concentrations, but significantly increased spermatic vein testosterone levels (P less than 0.01). Our findings demonstrate that alpha-hANP exerts its stimulatory effect on testicular steroidogenesis in man without modifying gonadotropin secretion, suggesting that alpha-hANP may directly influence Leydig cell function.\r"

After 2 weeks of treatment of eight patients with stones at a dose of 80 meq/day, urinary citrate rose significantly from 2.5 +/- 1.6 mmol/day (no drug) to 5.1 +/- 1.7 mmol/day with potassium citrate and to 4.5 +/- 1.5 mmol/day with potassium bicarbonate (P less than 0.05), but did not change significantly with potassium chloride. Citrate clearance increased from 8.0 to 27.4 mL/min with potassium citrate and 25.8 mL/min with potassium bicarbonate (P less than 0.05), but did not increase with potassium chloride. Both potassium citrate and potassium bicarbonate significantly raised urinary bicarbonate and decreased urinary ammonium, titratable acid, and net acid excretion. Potassium chloride was without effect. Effects of potassium citrate on urinary citrate, citrate clearance, and acid-base status tended to be more prominent than those of potassium bicarbonate, but these changes were not significant. Thus, the citraturic action of potassium citrate is largely accountable for by provision of an alkali load. Potassium itself had no effect in the absence of potassium deficiency.\r"

  ".W": "A 37-yr-old female presented with clinical signs and symptoms of mild hyperthyroidism, high serum levels of free T4 (24.2 pmol/L), free T3 (11.7 pmol/L), and sex hormone-binding globulin (157 nmol/L) as well as measurable (by immunofluorometric assay) serum TSH concentrations (1.9 mU/L) in the absence of any known methodological interference. The above finding indicated the presence of hyperthyroidism due to inappropriate secretion of TSH, whose neoplastic origin was documented by computed tomographic scan showing a 1-cm pituitary adenoma. The diagnosis was confirmed by elevated alpha-subunit levels (9.2 micrograms/L) and alpha-subunit/TSH molar ratio (25.2) as well as absent TSH suppression after T3 administration. TRH injection (200 microgram, iv) caused impaired TSH (from 3.0 to 4.8 mU/L) and unexpectedly exaggerated alpha-subunit (from 8.8 to 18.2 micrograms/L) responses. Such a discrepancy was also observed after other dynamic tests. Double gold particle immunostaining of the adenomatous tissue removed at surgery showed that all of the cells contained secretory granules positive for alpha-subunit, while very few cells were positive for TSH beta and alpha-subunit. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates the existence of TSH-induced hyperthyroidism due to a pituitary adenoma composed of two different cell types: one secreting alpha-subunit alone and another cosecreting alpha-subunit and TSH.\r"

To determine how endurance training may affect androgen levels, we measured serum total testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, free androgen index, LH, FSH, PRL, cortisol, and weight in 15 previously sedentary males. We also examined pulsatile LH release in a subset of 5 subjects. Over 6 months of training, the men increased weekly running mileage to an average of 56 km/week. Total testosterone and free androgen index levels decreased significantly. PRL and cortisol also decreased, while single sample LH and FSH remained unchanged. There was a significant reduction in weight, which did not correlate with changes in serum testosterone levels. LH pulsatile release was not altered by training in the subset of 5 runners. These data confirm previous findings of physiological reduction in serum testosterone and PRL levels and suggest that the testosterone decrease is not related to changes in LH pulsatile release, weight, or increased serum cortisol levels.\r"

The 17-OH P release and the ratio between 17-OH P and F release in response to the ACTH stimulation test were significantly higher (P less than 0.05) in hyperandrogenic women with high T levels than in normal subjects. Eight hyperandrogenic women with high T received intranasal GnRH agonist (Buserelin, 1200 micrograms/day) for 4 weeks, and the 17-OH P and F release in response to the ACTH stimulation was reassessed after agonist treatment. At the end of GnRH agonist administration the mean circulating levels of T were significantly reduced (P less than 0.05). The F response to the ACTH test was not modified by pretreatment with the GnRH agonist. The 17-OH P response to the ACTH stimulation test after the GnRH agonist was unchanged in comparison with control tests, as well as the ratio between 17-OH P and F responses to the ACTH test. These data do not seem to confirm, as previously suggested, that high T levels of ovarian origin affect adrenal steroidogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "We have conducted biochemical and genetic studies in five unrelated families (denoted A, C, R, P, and G), which included nine goitrous subjects (five borderline euthyroid and four hypothyroid) with complete (n = 6) or partial (n = 3) thyroid peroxidase (TPO) deficiency. Thyroid tissue was obtained from four subjects, respectively, in families A, C, and R. No iodide organification or iodide incorporation into protein was present in families A and C. The two affected siblings in family R had a low normal tissue thyroperoxidase activity. Using a 0.8-kilobase (kb) cDNA clone (pM5) encoding 30% of the cDNA of human TPO gene down-stream from basepair 730 and four restriction enzymes (TaqI, PstI, BglI, and BglII), we were unable to find any polymorphisms in family A. In another family (C) blood samples were obtained from only two family members, and consequently, it was not possible to determine linkage. DNA from families G, P, and C showed biallelic polymorphisms when digested with BglII, at 8.7 and 8.5 kb. In family R we detected two biallelic polymorphisms at 9.0 and 8.5 kb, and the 9.0-kb bands were clearly larger than 8.7-kb bands found in the other subjects. Also, there was an absence of a 4.0- to 3.9-kb band that may represent a partial gene deletion. With PstI-restricted DNA a possible deletion of 5.5-kb band was also present in affected siblings of family R. The logarithm of odds (Lod) score analyzed from the family with inbreeding (R) was compatible with linkage of disease and the TPO gene (Lod = 2.08). When this method was used with families G and P, the Lod score was inconsistent with linkage between disease and the TPO gene. These data suggest that the cause of TPO deficiency in these families is heterogeneous. However, the restriction fragment length polymorphism pattern of BglII-restricted DNA in the R family strongly suggests that a partial TPO gene deletion has occurred in this family.\r"

Serum TSH levels varied between 1.1-36.3 mU/L. The serum alpha-subunit level was low in 1 case, while in 4 other cases the concentration was elevated and varied between 3.7-7.8 micrograms/L. Serum TSH beta levels were normal in the 4 cases in which it was determined. Serum GH or PRL levels were elevated in 5 cases. In 1 patient the cosecretion of TSH, GH, and PRL was confirmed by immunocytochemical examination. Serum TSH and alpha-subunit responses to TRH, GnRH, CRF, GRF, dexamethasone, methimazole, T3, and bromocriptine administration were variable when studied. Serum TSH and alpha-subunit circadian rhythms were absent in 1 case and inverted in another. A serum alpha-subunit pulsatility without TSH pulses was observed in 1 patient. Five patients underwent transsphenoidal adenomectomy. Three of 4 patients operated on in our center were cured, but a recurrence of the adenoma was found in 1 of them after 5 yr. The fifth patient was not cured. Treatment with octreotide in 3 patients resulted in normalization of serum TSH, GH, and thyroid hormones levels. Cosecretion of PRL in 1 case and alpha-subunit in 2 cases was also inhibited. Partial tachyphylaxis occurred in 1 patient. In summary, heterogeneity in clinical presentation, hormonal expression, and therapeutic response appears to characterize these TSH-secreting adenomas.\r"

  ".U": "91123349\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously demonstrated the presence of binding sites for atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in human platelets. These sites have pharmacological characteristics similar to those of rat vascular smooth muscle. They are subject to regulation by circulating levels of ANP in plasma, varying inversely with the latter after high sodium intake, in arterial hypertension and congestive heart failure. We have now solubilized these platelet receptors with the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 (0.6%). The preparations were incubated with [125I]ANP in the presence of increasing concentrations of ANP-(99-126), ANP-(101-126), ANP-(103-126), and ANP-(103-123). The order of potency of these peptides to displace [125I]ANP was similar for the solubilized and particulate receptor. Bound [125I]ANP was covalently cross-linked to the receptor with 5 mM disuccinimidyl suberate. Autoradiography of the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel showed that [125I]ANP specifically interacts with a 125-kDa membrane component, some of which may be reduced by 2% mercaptoethanol or 10 mmol/L dithiothreitol to a 70-kDa species. A small proportion of a 70-kDa peptide is also found under nonreducing conditions. The concentration of ANP-(99-126) that inhibits binding of [125I]ANP by 50% to both the 125-kDa and the 70-kDa species was 0.1 nM, while that for ANP-(103-123) was 3 nM. The internally ring-deleted analog Des(Gln116,Ser117,Gly118,Leu119,Gly120)ANP -(102-121) or C-ANP displaced with equal potency ANP binding to the high and low mol wt (Mr) bands, as also found in cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells, but not in the mesemteric arteries these cells are derived from. In the latter, C-ANP displaced only binding from the lower Mr band. These results show that the ANP receptor in human platelets is heterogeneous. There is one nonreducible species with of 125,000 Mr, another of similar Mr containing two disulfide-linked subunits of 70,000 Mr, and, to a lesser extent, a nonreducible 70-kDa species, in agreement with findings in other tissues in experimental animals.\r"

However, several observations indicate that inhibin and activin are produced in various organs and serve multiple functions. Because bone marrow and spleen produce inhibin and activin, our aim was to evaluate their possible effect on cell-mediated immune function. For this reason we studied 1) monocyte chemotaxis, 2) lymphocyte interferon-gamma production, 3) phytohemagglutinin-induced lymphocyte proliferation, and 4) nonmajor histocompatibility complex-restricted and lymphokine-activated lymphocyte cytotoxicity. All studies were performed on human peripheral blood cells in the absence or presence of various doses of inhibin, activin, or inhibin plus activin. A significant dose-related increase in monocyte chemotaxis was induced by inhibin. Activin increased the migrational activity of monocytes, but via random, not directed, migration. Inhibin significantly decreased interferon-gamma production, and its effect was reversed by activin. Inhibin and/or activin had no significant effect on either phytohemagglutinin-induced lymphocyte proliferation or lymphocyte cytotoxic capability. The present demonstration that inhibin and activin may affect some immune parameters suggests a possible involvement of these hormones in regulating cell-mediated immune function.\r"

  ".W": "We have recently reported that in patients with hyperthyroidism, red blood cell (RBC) zinc (Zn), most of which is present as the metal of carbonic anhydrase-I isozyme (CAI), reflects a patient's integrated thyroid hormone level over the previous few months. In the present report the RBC CAI concentration was measured by RIA in 26 healthy controls, 25 patients with hyperthyroid Graves' disease, 5 patients with primary hypothyroidism, and 10 subjects with subacute thyroiditis with elevated thyroid hormone levels. The mean (+/- SD) RBC CAI concentration in euthyroid controls was 380 +/- 70 nmol/g hemoglobin (Hb), and the normal range defined as the mean +/- 2 SD, was 240-520 nmol/g Hb. The mean RBC CAI in Graves' disease was decreased (180 +/- 53 nmol/g Hb), and 22 patients (88%) had subnormal values. The mean RBC CAI concentrations in hypothyroidism and subacute thyroiditis were not different from the control values. After treatment with antithyroid drugs, both mean the plasma T4 and T3 levels in 11 Graves' patients became normal within 4 weeks, but the normalization of RBC CAI lagged behind by about 2 months. Furthermore, the highest correlation was observed between the RBC CAI and plasma T4 and T3 levels measured 8 weeks earlier. During prednisolone therapy the RBC CAI in patients with subacute thyroiditis remained at a normal level. These results suggest that 1) not only RBC Zn but also the RBC CAI concentration in patients with Graves' disease reflect the patient's mean thyroid hormone level over the preceding several months; and 2) in patients with subacute thyroiditis, elevation of plasma thyroid hormone concentrations is transient and causes little change in the RBC CAI concentration.\r"

  ".W": "Production of the neutrophil-activating peptide (NAP)-1/IL-8 by mononuclear phagocytes from patients with RA and from control subjects was studied under various conditions. Mononuclear cells from bone marrow (BMMC), PBMC, and synovial fluid (SFMC) were cultured for up to 48 h in the absence or presence of Escherichia coli LPS, different interleukins, interferon-gamma, zymosan, or immune complexes, and the neutrophil-stimulating activity released into the culture medium was determined. As shown by neutralization with an antiserum raised against human recombinant NAP-1/IL-8, over 90% of this activity could be attributed to NAP-1/IL-8. In unstimulated mononuclear cells from control individuals and BMMC from RA patients, the production of NAP-1/IL-8 was very low and was enhanced moderately by stimulation with LPS. By contrast, the spontaneous production of NAP-1/IL-8 was 3- to 10-fold higher in PBMC and even much higher in SFMC from RA patients. In all instances, the yield of NAP-1/IL-8 could be enhanced by stimulation in culture. In addition to LPS, rheumatoid factor-containing immune complexes, zymosan, and IL-1 were highly effective in inducing NAP-1/IL-8 production, while IL-3, GM-CSF, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and IL-2 were somewhat less potent. An inhibitory effect was obtained with IFN-gamma, which significantly decreased the spontaneous NAP-1/IL-8 release from SFMC and the IL-1- and LPS-induced NAP-1/IL-8 from RA and control PBMC. Inhibition was also observed with glucocorticoids. The production of NAP-1/IL-8 was markedly reduced by dexamethasone in phagocytosis-stimulated PBMC, and almost totally inhibited in SFMC obtained from joints after intraarticular administration of betamethasone. By contrast, the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, tended to increase the NAP-1/IL-8 yield from PBMC in culture.\r"

  ".W": "The human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, secreted an activity that degrades platelet-activating factor (PAF) by the hydrolysis of the sn-2 acetyl group. This activity was Ca++ independent, inhibited by diisopropylfluorophosphate but not by p-bromophenacyl bromide, and resistant to treatment with trypsin or pronase. Separation of HepG2-conditioned medium by gel filtration disclosed that the activity was associated with lipoproteins. An antiserum against PAF acetylhydrolase immunoprecipitated this activity. It was not recognized by an antibody against lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), which also is secreted by HepG2 cells. Therefore the phospholipase A2 activity of LCAT was excluded as a source of the observed activity. PAF added to the culture medium stimulated the secretion of the PAF-degrading activity by HepG2 cells, while lyso-PAF was inactive. Maximal stimulation was observed with 5 ng/ml PAF, which induced a fivefold increase. The presence of 5 ng/ml PAF, enhanced the secretion of [35S]methionine-labeled PAF acetylhydrolase and cycloheximide inhibited both the basal and PAF-stimulated secretion of the labeled enzyme. We conclude that HepG2 cells produce PAF acetylhydrolase. The liver may be a major source of plasma PAF acetylhydrolase, and PAF may induce the production of its inactivating enzyme by the liver.\r"

  ".U": "91123444\r", 
  ".W": "To define the mechanisms of impaired muscle glycogen synthase and reduced glycogen formation in non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), glycogen synthase activity was kinetically analyzed during the basal state and three glucose clamp studies (insulin approximately equal to 300, 700, and 33,400 pmol/liter) in eight matched nonobese NIDDM and eight control subjects. Muscle glycogen content was measured in the basal state and following clamps at insulin levels of 33,400 pmol/liter. NIDDM subjects had glucose uptake matched to controls in each clamp by raising serum glucose to 15-20 mmol/liter. The insulin concentration required to half-maximally activate glycogen synthase (ED50) was approximately fourfold greater for NIDDM than control subjects (1,004 +/- 264 vs. 257 +/- 110 pmol/liter, P less than 0.02) but the maximal insulin effect was similar. Total glycogen synthase activity was reduced approximately 38% and glycogen content was approximately 30% lower in NIDDM. A positive correlation was present between glycogen content and glycogen synthase activity (r = 0.51, P less than 0.01). In summary, defects in muscle glycogen synthase activity and reduced glycogen content are present in NIDDM. NIDDM subjects also have less total glycogen synthase activity consistent with reduced functional mass of the enzyme. These findings and the correlation between glycogen synthase activity and glycogen content support the theory that multiple defects in glycogen synthase activity combine to cause reduced glycogen formation in NIDDM.\r"

  ".W": "Low HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels may elevate atherosclerosis risk, and often associate with hypertriglyceridemia (HTG); however, the metabolic causes of low HDL-C levels with or without HTG are poorly understood. We studied the turnover of radioiodinated HDL apolipoproteins, apo A-I and apo A-II, in 15 human subjects with low HDL-C, six with normal plasma TG levels (group 1) and nine with high TG (group 2), and compared them to 13 control subjects with normal HDL-C and TG levels (group 3). The fractional catabolic rate (FCR) was equally elevated in groups 1 and 2 vs. group 3 for both apo A-I (0.313 +/- 0.052 and 0.323 +/- 0.063 vs. 0.245 +/- 0.043 pools/d, P = 0.003) and apo A-II (0.213 +/- 0.036 and 0.239 +/- 0.037 vs. 0.185 +/- 0.031 pools/d, P = 0.006). Thus, high FCR characterized low HDL-C regardless of the presence or absence of HTG. In contrast, transport rate (TR) of apo A-I did not differ significantly among the groups and the apo A-II TR differed only between groups 2 and 3 (2.15 +/- 0.57, 2.50 +/- 0.39, and 1.83 +/- 0.48 mg/kg per d for groups 1 to 3, respectively, P = 0.016). Several HDL-related factors were similar in groups 1 and 2 but differed in group 3, as with FCR, including the ratio of lipoprotein lipase to hepatic lipase activity (LPL/HL) in post-heparin plasma, the ratio of the HDL-C to apo A-I plus apo A-II levels, and the percent of tracer in the d greater than 1.21 fraction. In linear regression analysis HDL-C levels correlated inversely with the FCR of apo A-I and apo A-II (r = -0.74, P less than 0.0001 for both). Major correlates of FCR were HDL-C/apo A-I + apo A-II, LPL/HL, and plasma TG levels. We hypothesize that lipase activity and plasma TG affect HDL composition which modulates FCR, which in turn regulates HDL-C. Thus, HTG is only one of several factors which may contribute to elevated FCR and low HDL-C. Given the relationship of altered HDL composition with high FCR and low HDL-C levels, factors affecting HDL composition may increase atherosclerosis susceptibility.\r"

Inhibition of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (A-kinase) is considered as a possible mechanism of insulin action for glycogen synthase activation. In this study, we investigated the time course of insulin action on human muscle A-kinase activity during a 2-h insulin infusion in 13 insulin-sensitive (group S) and 7 insulin-resistant subjects (group R). Muscle biopsies were obtained from quadriceps femoris muscle at times 0, 10, 20, 40, and 120 min. Insulin infusion resulted in significant inhibition of A-kinase activity at 20 and/or 40 min using 0.2, 0.6, and 1.0 microM cyclic AMP in group S. A-kinase activities both before and after insulin administration were lower in group S than in group R using 0.6 microM cyclic AMP. The decrease in apparent affinity for cyclic AMP during insulin infusion was larger for group S compared with group R. Glycogen synthase activity increased significantly after insulin infusion in both groups and was higher in group S compared with group R. The data suggest that a defective response of A-kinase to insulin in insulin-resistant subjects could contribute to their reduced insulin stimulation of skeletal muscle glycogen synthase.\r"

  ".W": "We examined effects of priming with recombinant human interferon-gamma (IFN) or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) on neutrophil responses to Candida albicans hyphae. Both cytokines increased early superoxide generation after hyphal stimulation. The more pronounced effects of TNF were accompanied by an augmented surface membrane depolarization rate and were insensitive to both pertussis toxin and calcium ion chelation, but were negated by concomitant incubation with puromycin or cycloheximide during priming. IFN augmented hyphal killing despite its only minor enhancement of early respiratory burst responses, but TNF reduced neutrophil fungicidal activity to nearly 40% below those by unprimed control cells even though it enhanced early superoxide responses more dramatically. Though TNF-primed neutrophils killed hyphae at normal initial rates, IFN-primed or even unprimed cells manifested more fungicidal sustained activity. These disparate consequences of cytokine priming on hyphal destruction were paralleled by differences in late generation of potentially candidacidal oxidants, hydrogen peroxide, and hypochlorous acid. IFN added during priming failed to correct TNF-associated functional defects in neutrophil anti-Candida responses. Thus, augmentation of early respiratory burst responses to oxidant-sensitive organisms need not necessarily reflect concomitant salutary effects on microbicidal activity.\r"

  ".W": "Gamma delta (gamma delta) T cell receptor (TCR) expressing T cells comprise 3% of human peripheral blood lymphocytes, yet their role in the immune response remains largely unknown. There is evidence both in humans and in animal models that these cells participate in the immune response to mycobacterial antigens. In mice, exposure to mycobacterial antigens leads to the expansion of gamma delta T cells in draining lymph nodes and lungs. In humans, gamma delta T cell lines with reactivity to mycobacterial antigens have been derived from synovial fluid of a rheumatoid arthritis patient, skin lesions of leprosy patients, and peripheral blood of a healthy tuberculin reactor. Very little is known, however, about the factors which induce human gamma delta T cells to expand. In studies comparing the human T cell response to live and heat-killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MT), we have found that monocytes infected with live MT are very effective inducers of human gamma delta T cell expansion. After 7 d of exposure to live MT, gamma delta T cells were greatly increased in all healthy tuberculin reactors (PPD+) tested and frequently were the predominant T cell population. In contrast, heat-killed MT or purified protein products of MT induced a CD4+, alpha beta TCR+ T cell response with very little increase in gamma delta T cells. Furthermore, a similar selective induction of gamma delta T cells was observed when monocytes infected with live Salmonella were used to stimulate T cells. Heat-killed Salmonella, like heat-killed MT, induced a predominantly CD4+ alpha beta TCR+ T cell response. These findings suggest that human gamma delta T cells are a major reactive T cell population during the early stages of infection with living intracellular bacteria and are therefore likely to exert an important role in the initial interaction between host and parasite.\r"

However, there is little evidence for the role of cytokines in vivo, either in humans or in the spontaneous animal models of IDDM such as the NOD mouse or BB rat. To address this question, we used the model of cyclophosphamide (CYP)-induced autoimmune diabetes in the NOD/Wehi mouse to examine for (a) the production of IFN-gamma and IL-6 from isolated islets, and (b) the effect of anti IFN-gamma or anti IL-6 monoclonal antibodies on the development of diabetes. After cyclophosphamide, the majority of these mice develop of mononuclear cell infiltrate (insulitis) which by 10-14 d is associated with beta cell destruction. IFN-gamma activity at low levels (2.7 +/- 0.3 U/ml) could be detected only in culture supernatants from islets isolated at day 7 post-cyclophosphamide. In contrast, IL-6 activity progressively increased from 457 +/- 44 U/ml at day 0 to 6,020 +/- 777 U/ml at day 10. Culture of islets with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody resulted in a significant increase in IFN-gamma activity from 41 +/- 7 U/ml at day 0 to 812 +/- 156 U/ml at day 10. Mice given either anti-IFN-gamma or anti-IL-6 antibody had a significantly reduced (P less than 0.001) incidence of diabetes and especially with IFN-gamma, decreased severity of insulitis. We conclude that IFN-gamma and IL-6 have essential roles in the pathogenesis of pancreatic islet beta cell destruction in this model.\r"

All patients were studied by coronary angiography, measurement of ejection fraction and signal-averaged ECG. The infarct-related artery was closed in 51 patients and open in 73. Among patients with no prior myocardial infarction undergoing early attempted reperfusion therapy, a patent artery was associated with a decreased incidence of late potentials (20% versus 71%; no significant difference in ejection fraction). In the 48 patients receiving thrombolytic agents within 4 h of symptom onset, the incidence of late potentials was 24% and 83% among patients with an open or closed artery, respectively (p less than 0.04). The most powerful predictors of late potentials were the presence of a closed infarct-related artery, followed by prior infarction and patient age. Among patients receiving thrombolytic agents within 4 h of symptom onset, the only variable that was predictive of the presence of late potentials was a closed infarct-related artery. These data imply that reperfusion of an infarct-related artery has a beneficial effect on the electrophysiologic substrate for serious ventricular arrhythmias that is independent of change in left ventricular ejection fraction as an index of infarct size. These findings might explain, in part, the low late mortality rate in survivors of myocardial infarction with documented reperfusion of the infarct-related artery.\r"

Oral administration of the selected agent was continued for 3 months along with other antianginal medications, including nonangiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor vasodilators. Repeat measurements of left ventricular function were obtained before hospital discharge and at 3 months. There were no significant differences in baseline clinical characteristics between groups.

  ".W": "Depletion of sulfhydryl groups may contribute to nitroglycerin tolerance after long-term exposure. This study was performed to assess whether methionine, an amino acid capable of augmenting sulfhydryl availability, would restore the venodilative response to sublingual nitroglycerin once tolerance had developed. The venodilative response to organic nitrates was assessed with use of the equilibration technique of forearm plethysmography. Venous volume was measured before and after sublingual administration of 0.4 mg of nitroglycerin at baseline study and after 5 g of intravenous methionine. Retesting was performed 2 h after application of a 10 mg nitroglycerin patch and compared with the response after 74 h of nitroglycerin patch exposure before and after intravenous methionine. Methionine alone had no intrinsic venodilative action. Although the venous volume at rest was unchanged after methionine administration, the response to sublingual nitroglycerin was potentiated compared with baseline values (37 +/- 15% versus 32 +/- 13%, p less than 0.02). During nitroglycerin patch exposure, the response to sublingual nitroglycerin was significantly attenuated at 74 h compared with the response at 2 h of exposure (16 +/- 10% versus 31 +/- 13%, p less than 0.001). The venodilative response to sublingual nitroglycerin was restored at 74 h after methionine administration (35 +/- 14% versus 16 +/- 10%, p less than 0.001). Thus, methionine potentiates the venodilative effect of sublingual nitroglycerin both immediately and in the setting of nitrate tolerance.\r"

  ".W": "Recent imaging studies suggest that technetium-99m (Tc-99m) pyrophosphate yields a considerably larger estimate of myocardial infarct size than does indium-111 (In-111) monoclonal antimyosin antibody. To determine whether Tc-99m pyrophosphate may be taken up by reversibly injured myocytes, particularly in the setting of coronary reperfusion, the tissue localization of Tc-99m pyrophosphate and antimyosin antibody was compared in 11 dogs 24 to 68 h after anterior descending coronary artery occlusion (4 dogs with permanent occlusion, 7 with reperfusion). Technetium-99m pyrophosphate and In-111 antimyosin antibody content was determined in serial 2 to 3 mm wide endocardial and epicardial samples taken through the infarct zone in multiple short-axis left ventricular slices. The number of samples with increased In-111 antimyosin antibody (defined as greater than or equal to mean + 2 SD of normal) was not significantly different from that with increased Tc-99m pyrophosphate. This was true in both reperfused and nonreperfused infarcts. However, the intensity of uptake of Tc-99m pyrophosphate exceeded that of In-111 antimyosin antibody, particularly in the border zones of reperfused infarcts, and the area with moderate to marked increase in tracer uptake (greater than or equal to 2 times normal) was significantly larger with Tc-99m pyrophosphate than In-111 antimyosin antibody (p less than 0.001). A specific zone of abnormal Tc-99m pyrophosphate with normal In-111 antimyosin antibody content could not be identified. Histologic evidence of myocardial necrosis was found in virtually every sample with increased In-111 antimyosin antibody, Tc-99m pyrophosphate, or both.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91123604\r", 
  ".W": "Interleukin-4 (IL-4) has been demonstrated to induce IgE synthesis by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) of healthy donors. In this study, we demonstrated that IL-4 also can enhance spontaneous IgE synthesis by PBMNCs of allergic/atopic patients and patients with Buckley's or hyper-IgE syndrome. Spontaneous IgE production by PBMNCs of these patients was suppressed by interferon (IFN)gamma or IFN-alpha in a dose-dependent fashion. Despite high serum IgE levels, no IL-4 could be detected in the serum of the patients, but indirect evidence was obtained indicating that enhanced IL-4 production in vivo may be associated with the high serum-IgE levels in these patients. Spontaneous IL-4 production was measured in PBMNC cultures of 4/21 patients tested. Furthermore, spontaneous IgE synthesis by PBMNCs of three other patients of seven tested in vitro was partly blocked by anti-IL-4 antiserum. In addition, levels of soluble CD23 (which is specifically induced by IL-4) were strongly elevated in sera of patients. Finally, activation of PBMNCs of the patients resulted in levels of IL-4 and of IFN-gamma synthesis that were higher and lower, respectively, than levels produced by PBMNCs of healthy control donors tested in parallel. Collectively, our data indicate that spontaneous IgE synthesis in vitro can be modulated by IL-4, IL-5, IFN-gamma, and IFN-alpha. In addition, our data suggest that enhanced IL-4 and reduced IFN-gamma production is associated with the elevated serum IgE levels observed in these patients.\r"

Does actual or ideal body weight better predict energy expenditure? Two groups of obese subjects--65 hospitalized adults and 65 nonhospitalized adults--were studied. Both groups had actual body weights that were at least 30% above ideal body weights. For both groups, energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry and calculated using the variables sex, actual and ideal body weight, age, and ventilatory status. All but three patients were receiving nutrition support by the enteral route (either orally or by tube) or by the parenteral route (with hypertonic dextrose, amino acid, and fat). The nonhospitalized subjects fasted during measurements of energy expenditure. Regression equations were derived to predict energy expenditure. Actual body weight better predicted energy expenditure than did ideal body weight. We conclude that actual weight should be used to predict energy expenditure in obese individuals.\r"

Over 40 months, 473 residents were evaluated by a psychiatric consultation-liaison clinical nurse specialist; 100 of these cases were reviewed in detail. Apparent depression was the most common reason for referral, and depressive and adjustment disorders were the most common diagnostic conclusions of the consultation team. Behavioral complications of dementia were also frequently diagnosed. Treatment recommendations usually included the development of a behavioral management plan, but the institution of psychotropic medications, usually antidepressants, was indicated in about one-fifth of the 100 cases. Treatment interventions were effective in the majority of cases. About one-half of the problems prompting referral were within the expertise of the nurse specialist and did not require the direct involvement of the geropsychiatrist. This nurse-centered consultation model proved effective, well accepted, and easy to implement.\r"

Eighty-one incontinent patients were treated with the prompted-voiding toileting procedure. Thirty-six of these patients proved responsive to the toileting procedures, and nursing home staff was instructed to maintain the toileting program for these responsive patients. The first part of the quality-control model involved setting job standards specifying how dry the patients should be if toileted on a 2-hour schedule. Second, a job-monitoring control chart was used to continuously assess how well the job standards were being met. The remaining forty-five patients, who were unresponsive to the toileting protocol, were managed with a 2-hour changing schedule. Job standards specifying how wet (volume) the patient would be if changed on a two-hour basis were set. Control-chart monitoring of these patients urine output assessed how well the changing procedures were being implemented. Incontinence care in nursing homes is difficult to supervise because of problems in measuring how consistently nursing aides change or toilet patients. This paper describes a management system for effective incontinence care.\r"

We show here that this thymocyte subset bears NK1, a surface Ag previously thought to be expressed exclusively by TCR- NK cells. Analysis of peripheral lymphocytes for the coexpression of TCR-alpha beta and NK1 revealed a subset with similar characteristics to the NK1+ thymocytes: a large fraction that are CD4-8- and a skewed TCR repertoire in which V beta 8 is overrepresented. Thymus transplant experiments into congenically marked athymic (nude) mice revealed that the NK1+TCR alpha beta+ subset was exclusively thymus derived and represented a distinct subset from the thymus-independent NK1+TCR- population. Finally, the NK1+TCR alpha beta+ population preferentially localizes to the bone marrow. These results demonstrate that this T cell subset is exported to the periphery after developing in the thymus. Their unique surface Ag expression and tissue localization suggest an immune function distinct from classical T cells.\r"

  ".W": "The injection of mature T cells into a tolerant or immunocompromised allogeneic host animal produces a graft versus host response (GVHR) that can result in splenomegaly, immunosuppression and death of the host animal. We demonstrate here that lymphocytes from T cell receptor beta-chain (TCR-beta) transgenic mice, in which the expression of the transgene inhibits endogenous beta- and gamma-gene rearrangements and thus causes abnormal T cell development, are unable to mediate a GVHR. The GVHR was measured after the injection of lymphocytes from transgenic mice into normal F1 mice and also after transplantation of bone marrow and lymphocytes from transgenic mice into lethally irradiated F1 recipients. In both systems, cells from transgenic mice failed to produce a significant GVHR. Cells from the transgenic mice were able to recognize the foreign histocompatibility Ag of the host in vitro and in vivo although the transgenic mice rejected skin grafts more slowly than controls. Thus, lymphocytes from transgenic mice were unable to produce a GVHR despite the presence of alloreactive T cells. These results suggest that lymphocytes from TCR-beta transgenic mice fail to mediate a GVHR either because lymphocytes with a single transgenic TCR-beta chain have a limited ability to recognize allogeneic cells in vivo or because the transgenic mice lack lymphocyte subsets that are important for the mediation of a GVHR.\r"

  ".U": "91123680\r", 
  ".W": "We have characterized CD4-CD8- double negative (DN) thymocytes that express TCR-alpha beta and represent a minor thymocyte subpopulation expressing a markedly skewed TCR repertoire. We found that DN TCR-alpha beta + thymocytes resemble mature T cells in that they (a) are phenotypically CD2hiCD5hiQa2+HSA-, (b) appear late in ontogeny, and (c) are susceptible to cyclosporin A-induced maturation arrest. In addition, we found that DNA sequences 5' to the CD8 alpha gene were demethylated relative to their germline state, suggesting that DN TCR-alpha beta + thymocytes are derived from cells that had at one time expressed their CD8 alpha gene locus. Because DN TCR-alpha beta + thymocytes are known to express an unusual TCR repertoire with significant overexpression of V beta 8, we were interested in examining the possible role played by self-Ag in shaping their TCR repertoire. It has been suggested that DN TCR-alpha beta + thymocytes are derived from potentially self-reactive thymocytes that have escaped clonal deletion by down-regulating their surface expression of CD4 and/or CD8 determinants. However, apparently inconsistent with such an hypothesis, we found that the frequency of DN thymocytes expressing various anti-self TCR (V beta 6, V beta 8.1, V beta 11, V beta 17a) were not increased in strains expressing their putative self-Ag, but instead were either unaffected or significantly reduced in those strains. With regard to V beta 8 expression among DN TCR-alpha beta + thymocytes, V beta 8 overexpression in DN TCR-alpha beta + thymocytes appeared to be independent of, and superimposed on, the developmental appearance of the basic DN thymocyte repertoire. Even though V beta 8 overexpression appeared to be generated by a mechanism distinct from that generating the rest of the DN TCR-alpha beta + thymocyte repertoire, we found that super-Ag against which V beta 8 TCR react introduced into the neonatal differentiation environment also significantly reduced, rather than increased, the frequency of DN TCR-alpha beta + V beta 8+ thymocytes. Thus, the present study is consistent with DN TCR-alpha beta + thymocytes being mature cells derived from CD8+ precursors, and documents that their TCR repertoire can be influenced, at least negatively, by either self-Ag or Ag introduced into the neonatal differentiation environment. However, we found no evidence to support the hypothesis that DN TCR-alpha beta + thymocytes are enriched in cells expressing TCR reactive against self-Ag.\r"

When anti-transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) antibodies are added to the co-cultures, IFN-gamma production is restored to normal levels. Irrelevant control antibodies have no effect. The same pattern of response was obtained with cells incubated in serum-free medium. In other experiments, purified TGF-beta was added to cultures of effector cells in the presence of antigen. TGF-beta inhibited the production of IFN-gamma by these cells in a dose-dependent manner, but had no apparent inhibitory effect on IL-2 production. Finally, supernatants from cultures containing effector cells and CD4+ suppressor cells plus Ag contained measurable amounts of TGF-beta, whereas supernatants from cultures of effector cells plus Ag contained no measurable amounts of TGF-beta. These results suggest that CD4+ Ts cells of EAE regulate effector cells of EAE through a mechanism that involves the secretion of TGF-beta and that the inhibitory function of this cytokine can be reversed with neutralizing antibodies directed against TGF-beta.\r"

The phenotype and functional properties of these TCC were compared with those of 122 TCC contemporarily established from PB mononuclear cell suspensions of the same patients, 120 TCC established from lymph nodes of three patients with nonspecific hyperplastic lymphoadenitis and 159 TCC established from thyroid lymphocyte infiltrates of three patients with Graves' disease. The great majority of conjunctival TCC displayed the CD4+ CD8- phenotype (CD4/CD8 ratios ranging from 6.1 to 7.0), whereas the mean CD4/CD8 ratios for control TCC ranged from 0.9 to 2.4. After stimulation with either PHA or PMA plus anti-CD3 mAb, conjunctival TCC differed from control TCC for their ability to produce cytokines. In particular, a large number of conjunctival TCC produced IL-4, but no, or limited amounts of, IFN-gamma, whereas no difference was observed between conjunctival and control TCC with regard to the production of IL-2. The failure of IFN-gamma production by conjunctival TCC was apparently not caused by delay or block in cytokine production, but actually reflected the lack of IFN-gamma transcription. Virtually all conjunctival TCC able to produce IL-4, but not IFN-gamma, as well as most of those producing both cytokines, provided helper function for IgE synthesis in allogeneic normal B cells. The accumulation in the conjunctiva of patients with vernal conjunctivitis of CD4+ T cells that, apart from the production of IL-2, resembles murine Th2 cells for their profile of cytokine production and helper function suggests a possible role for these cells in the pathogenesis of the disease.\r"

  ".U": "91123686\r", 
  ".W": "The CD45 Ag family is comprised of at least five isoforms generated by the alternative splicing of three exons encoded by a single leukocyte common Ag gene. These isoforms, differentially expressed on subsets of T cells, are widely believed to delineate maturational status. Thus, cells expressing the high molecular mass CD45RA+ isoforms (220 and 205 kDa) are believed to represent naive cells, whereas those lacking CD45RA and expressing high density CD45RO (180 kDa) represent memory cells. This is based on findings that after activation, CD45RA+ cells \"convert\" to the CD45RA- phenotype, losing CD45RA and gaining CD45RO. This conversion is believed to be both unidirectional and irreversible. We now report a strategy for the development of polyclonal CD45RA+ cell lines derived from peripheral blood CD4+CD45RA+ cells. However, in such cell lines, CD45RA expression was not constant, but varied cyclically with restimulation. After restimulation, CD45RA expression decreased significantly, nadiring on days 5 to 7. However, CD45RA was fully re-expressed by days 14 to 16. These cells coexpressed high density CD45RO, which did not vary through the stimulatory cycle. Cells sorted CD45RA- on day 7 of the cycle rapidly reexpress CD45RA. Metabolic labeling revealed that the 220 kDa CD45RA isoform is no longer synthesized. Synthesis of the 205 kDa (CD45RA) isoform decreased significantly early after stimulation, but then increased back to baseline after day 12. The 180-kDa (CD45RO) isoform followed an opposite pattern. Our results document that alternative splicing of the different CD45 isoforms is highly regulated after activation and that conversion from CD45RA+ to CD45RA- is neither unidirectional, nor irreversible.\r"

  ".W": "Monocytes accumulate in the epidermis and along the dermo-epidermal junction in several different inflammatory skin diseases. To determine whether human epidermal keratinocytes elaborate a specific chemotaxin responsible for the accumulation of monocytes at these anatomic sites, monocyte chemotactic activity in conditioned 16-h cultured keratinocyte supernatants were assayed using human peripheral blood monocytes as the target cell. Dilutional analysis revealed directed monocyte migration in IFN-gamma-treated (100 U/ml) keratinocyte supernatants (80% maximal FMLP response) which was 10-fold more than IFN-gamma itself or untreated keratinocyte activity alone. Gel filtration chromatography revealed that this activity eluted just ahead of a 12.5-kDa molecular mass marker. Blocking studies demonstrated that a rabbit polyclonal antibody to monocyte chemotaxis and activating factor (MCAF) inhibited all monocyte chemotaxis by greater than 80%. Keratinocytes were metabolically labeled with 35S-cysteine/methionine, and after 16 h incubation the supernatants immunoprecipitated with the same anti-MCAF antibody. MCAF was detected as a protein doublet of 12 and 9 kDa only in IFN-gamma-treated (100 U/ml) keratinocyte supernatants. Incubation with IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha (250 U/ml) in combination resulted in increased production of MCAF protein. By Northern blot analysis, MCAF mRNA was constitutively expressed in keratinocytes and upregulated only in the presence of IFN-gamma. TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, transforming growth factor-beta and phorbol esters had no positive or negative influence on MCAF mRNA. These studies demonstrate that biologically active MCAF is elaborated by human epidermal keratinocytes upon activation by IFN-gamma, a cytokine also required for the induction of adherence between monocytes and keratinocytes. Keratinocyte-derived MCAF is likely to be important in the regulation of cutaneous monocyte trafficking and may also be responsible for the recruitment of Langerhans cells and dermal dendrocytes, which share many phenotypic features with monocytes/macrophages, to their anatomic locations in skin.\r"

Cross-linking experiments performed with a bifunctional cross-linking agent revealed a specific band with a m.w. of 94,000. Preincubation of macrophages with IFN-gamma prevented the binding of TNF to receptors. This effect was dose-dependent and maximal at 100 U/ml. IFN-gamma also reduced specific TNF binding to preexisting receptors (50% inhibition in 3 h), but IFN-gamma did not change the internalization rate of TNF. These studies showed that the number of TNF receptors increased on macrophages vs maturation in culture and was negatively controlled by IFN-gamma.\r"

  ".W": "Granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) primes human neutrophils for increased functional responsiveness to a variety of inflammatory agonists. In the present report, we have investigated the effect of human GM-CSF on the ability of platelet-activating factor (PAF) to induce the synthesis of 5-lipoxygenase products in human neutrophils. Human neutrophils stimulated with PAF in the range of 10(-5) to 10(-7) M for 15 min released small quantities of leukotriene B4 and its omega-oxidation products, 20-OH- and 20-COOH-leukotriene B4 in amounts that were detectable by enzyme immunoassay. Preincubation of normal peripheral blood neutrophils with human rGM-CSF enhanced the synthesis of the 5-lipoxygenase products in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Treatment with GM-CSF enabled their detection in response to lower concentrations of PAF (greater than or equal to 10(-9) M). The PAF receptor antagonist BN52021 inhibited the synthesis of 5-lipoxygenase products by GM-CSF-treated neutrophils in response to PAF. In addition to its effect on PAF-induced leukotriene synthesis, GM-CSF also augmented intracellular calcium mobilization by PAF. This observation prompted us to examine the effect of GM-CSF on two calcium-dependent events that are essential for leukotriene synthesis, arachidonic acid liberation, and 5-lipoxygenase activation. GM-CSF by itself, did not directly activate either of these two processes, however, it consistently and markedly enhanced the ability of PAF to do so. These results indicate that preincubation of peripheral blood neutrophils with GM-CSF enhances the ability of PAF to stimulate leukotriene synthesis by increasing both arachidonic acid availability and 5-lipoxygenase activation in response to PAF. These observations provide additional evidence of an important role for GM-CSF in the modulation of inflammatory responses to endogenous agonists through enhancement of the production of potent cellular inflammatory mediators such as leukotrienes.\r"

  ".W": "The cytokine, TNF-alpha, interacts with human neutrophils (PMN) via specific membrane receptors and primes leukotriene B4 (LTB4) production in PMN for subsequent stimulation by calcium ionophores. We have further examined the effects of TNF-alpha on arachidonic acid (AA) release, LTB4 production, and platelet-activating factor (PAF) formation in PMN by prelabeling cells with either [3H]AA or [3H]lyso-PAF, priming with human rTNF-alpha, and then stimulating with the chemotactic peptide, FMLP. TNF-alpha, alone, had little effect; minimal AA release, LTB4 or PAF production occurred after PMN were incubated with 0 to 1000 U/ml TNF-alpha. However, when PMN were first preincubated with 100 U/ml TNF-alpha for 30 min and subsequently challenged with 1 microM FMLP, both [3H] AA release and LTB4 production were elevated two- to threefold over control values. Measurement of AA mass by gas chromatography and LTB4 production by RIA confirmed the radiolabeled results. TNF-alpha priming also increased PAF formation after FMLP stimulation. These results demonstrate that TNF-alpha priming before stimulation with a physiologic agonist can enhance activation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) resulting in increased AA release and can facilitate the activities of 5-lipoxygenase (LTB4 production) and acetyltransferase (PAF formation). Reports in the literature have hypothesized that the priming mechanism involves either production of PLA2 metabolites, increased diglyceride (DG) levels, or enhanced cytosolic calcium levels induced by the priming agent. We investigated these possibilities in TNF-alpha priming of PMN and report that TNF-alpha had no direct effect on PLA2 activation or metabolite formation. Treatment of PMN with TNF-alpha did not induce DG formation and, in the absence of cytochalasin B, no increased DG production (measured by both radiolabel techniques and mass determinations) occurred after TNF-alpha priming followed by FMLP stimulation. TNF-alpha also had no effect on basal cytosolic calcium and did not enhance intracellular calcium levels after FMLP stimulation. These results suggest that an alternative, as yet undefined, mechanism is active in TNF-alpha priming of human PMN.\r"

Studies of PMN activation during the time course of PT treatment yielded these results. 1) Responses were differentiated based on their sensitivity to PT treatment. Suboptimal PT treatment that resulted in 50% inhibition of the FP-induced actin-associated right angle light scatter response resulted in greater than 90% inhibition of oxidant production. Exhaustive PT treatment was required to completely inhibit the right angle light scatter response. This is consistent with previous observations that, relative to oxidant production, actin polymerization requires 100-fold fewer active N-formylpeptide receptors to elicit the response. This differential sensitivity to PT treatment has important implications for studies that use pertussis toxin to determine if the neutrophil G-protein is involved in the signaling of responses. If inhibition of oxidant production is used as the only indicator of the effectiveness of PT treatment, significant cytoskeletal changes may still be activated in these cells. Inhibition of actin polymerization is a much more rigorous indicator of complete G-protein inhibition by PT. 2) Analysis of FP-induced actin polymerization and cytosolic calcium elevation using flow cytometry, which measures individual cell responses, revealed that PT treatment resulted in the conversion of PMN from a responding to a non-responding population. In contrast, in control PMN, submaximal doses of FP caused submaximal stimulation of all the cells. The all-or-none effect of PT may result from heterogeneous insertion of the A-promoter of PT into the cell or it may result from a sharp threshold of coupled G-proteins required to transduce the responses.\r"

Th2 cytokine production was not detected in substantial quantity until the 6 to 8th wk of infection and after reaching peak levels at 8 to 12 wk declined slowly thereafter. The time courses of IL-4 and IL-5 production, whereas differing from each other, closely resembled corresponding published data on IgE and peripheral blood eosinophil levels during murine schistosome infection. In contrast, Th1 cytokine responses occurred only during the first 6 wk of infection and were virtually absent during the peak period of Th2 production. To assess the role of egg deposition in the observed pattern of Th response, cytokine production was assayed in mice carrying unisexual schistosome infections in which parasite eggs are absent. Splenocytes from these animals displayed only marginal Th2 cytokine synthesis but greater Th1 cytokine responses than the corresponding cells from mice with bisexual infections. Moreover, cultures of liver tissue or isolated granulomas from infected mice constitutively produced high levels of IL-4 and IL-5 but failed to synthesize significant amounts of IL-2 and IFN-gamma even when stimulated with egg Ag or mitogen. Taken together the data indicate that egg deposition is the major stimulus of Th2 cytokine response in S. mansoni-infected mice and suggest that T cells belonging to this subset must play a major role in egg granuloma formation.\r"

C57BL/6 mice were depleted in vivo of L3T4+, Lyt-1+, Lyt-2+, IL-2R+ cells, or IL-4 by administration of appropriate mAb. Resistance and various correlative parameters of the immune response were studied in normal, depleted, and congenitally athymic mice. Depletion of T lymphocytes by anti-L3T4 or anti-IL-2R mAb reduced the development and expression of resistance, IgG2a and IgE antibody formation, and delayed type hypersensitivity reactivity against schistosome Ag. Depletion with anti-IL-4 antibody led to profound suppression of IgE-eosinophil-mediated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis responses against the parasite and no effect on IgG2a antibody, Ag-mediated blast transformation, or resistance. Depletion of Lyt-2+ cells produced augmented development and expression of resistance and an increase in the immunological parameters of anti-schistosome reactivity. These studies suggest that protective immunity to S. mansoni in mice, induced by irradiated cercariae, is dependent on L3T4+, IL-2R+ lymphocytes and negatively regulated by Lyt-2+ cells. IL-4 does not appear to be essential for the development of resistance but is essential for the IgE response to the parasite.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred thirteen HSV-specific CD4+ T cell clones were established from the PBL of a healthy person and their functional heterogeneity was investigated. All clones proliferated in response to stimulation with HSV in the presence of autologous APC. Among those, 48 clones showed cytotoxic activity to HSV-infected autologous EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line, but not to HSV-infected autologous fibroblasts, HSV-infected allogeneic cells, or K562 cells (group 1). Five clones showed cytotoxicity against HSV-infected autologous cells as well as HSV-infected allogeneic cells and K562 cells (group 2). The cytotoxicity of these clones was found to be mediated by the direct killing but not by the \"innocent bystander\" killing of target cells. Sixty clones showed no cytotoxic activity, however, among these, 23 revealed HLA-unrestricted and nonspecific cytotoxicity in the presence of PHA in culture (group 3), and the remaining 37 did not show any cytotoxic activity even in the presence of PHA (group 4). The cytotoxic patterns of these clones did not change in activated and resting phases, suggesting that the difference in cytotoxic ability does not depend on cell cycles. The cytotoxic activity of group 1 was inhibited by addition of anti-HLA-DR or anti-CD3 mAb to the culture, whereas these mAb had no effect on the cytotoxicity of group 2. All four groups of clones had helper activity for anti-HSV antibody production by autologous B cells. Moreover it was found that all groups of clones simultaneously produced IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma after culture with APC followed by HSV Ag stimulation. The surface phenotype of all clones was uniformly CD2+, CD3+, CD4+, CD8-, CD29+, CD45RA-, but expression of Leu 8 was varied. These data therefore indicate that HSV-specific human CD4+ T cells are classified into at least four groups according to the presence and specificity of cytotoxicity, i.e., Th cells with HSV-specific and HLA-class II-restricted cytotoxicity, Th cells with HLA-unrestricted and nonspecific cytotoxicity, Th cells with lectin-dependent cytotoxicity, and Th cells without cytotoxic activity. The present finding of functional heterogeneity among virus-specific human CD4+ T cells might shed light on the pathogenesis of CD4+ T cell immunodeficiency, such as human retrovirus infections.\r"

By using the polymerase chain reaction technique, V gamma 3-J gamma 1 rearrangements and RNA expression were detected in the murine adult thymus. Individual genomic and cDNA junctions were cloned and sequenced. In genomic DNA, 55% (16/29) of V gamma 3-J gamma 1 junctional sequences had N regions ranging in length from 1 to 12 nucleotides resulting in considerable junctional diversity. Only 5% (2/42) of cDNA sequences had N regions. The canonical DEC sequence represented 36% (15/42) of the cDNA sequences. Thus, fetal-type V gamma 3-J gamma 1 rearrangements lacking N regions were preferentially expressed in adult thymocytes, some of which may be DEC precursors. The developmental stages in which V gamma 3-J gamma 1 rearrangements are generated were studied by using polymerase chain reaction to detect circular rearrangement products. Active V gamma 3-J gamma 1 rearrangement was detected in thymuses from fetal, newborn, and 2-wk-old mice but not in 5-wk or 8-wk-old (adult) mice. V gamma 2, one of the most common V gamma rearrangements in the adult, was found to be actively rearranging to J gamma 1 in the adult thymus. However, V gamma 2-V gamma 3 replacement rearrangement was not found. These results support the hypotheses that adult thymocytes with rearranged V gamma 3-J gamma 1 are persistent from earlier developmental stages and represent a separate lineage from those with V gamma 2-J gamma 1 rearrangements.\r"

To further study this phenomenon of concerted developmental and pigmentary activity, we followed the sequence of tyrosinase (key enzyme of melanogenesis) expression and activity and the presence of the melanosomal protein gp 75 during the development of traumatically induced anagen follicles (days 0 = telogen, and days 1-12, after anagen induction studied). In addition to performing Northern and Western blots for tyrosinase, tyrosine hydroxylase activity (THA) and dopa oxidase activity (DOA) were measured. On day 0, DOA was undetectable, and THA was very low. On days 1 and 2, both activities were undetectable; starting from day 3, they increased rapidly, reaching a plateau on days 8 and 12. DO-positive proteins had apparent molecular weights (MW) of 66-68 kD (days 3-12), 72-74 kD (days 5-12), and 130 kD (days 8 and 12). Western blotting emphasized proteins of MW 66-68 kD (tyrosinase), and 73-75 kD (gp 75); tyrosinase was undetectable on day 0, but already present on days 1 and 2; it increased by day 5 and had reached a plateau on days 8 and 12; gp 75 was undetectable on days 0-2; it was present on day 3, increased by day 5, and reached a plateau on days 8 and 12. Northern blot analysis revealed high levels of tyrosinase mRNA on days 5 and 8, low levels on days 1-3, and none on day 0. These data suggest a highly regulated, time frame-restricted, differential pattern of tyrosinase transcription, translation, and enzyme activity during the different stages of the developing murine anagen follicle, possibly as a result of complex interactions between follicular melanocytes and their environment.\r"

We have investigated the possibility that these cytokines act as regulators of melanization and proliferation of cultured normal human melanocytes (NHM). All three cytokines elicited a dose-dependent decrease in the activity of the enzyme tyrosinase after 48 h of treatment. IL-1 alpha had the greatest inhibitory effect, resulting in a 22% inhibition of tyrosinase activity at a concentration of 3 x 10(-14) M. An equivalent effect was elicited by 4 x 10(-11) M IL-6 and 10(-11) M TNF-alpha. All three cytokines also inhibited melanocyte proliferation, as measured by a decrease in the rate of 3H-thymidine incorporation and an increase in doubling time. IL-1 alpha at 6 x 10(-14) M, 6 x 10(-13) M, and 3 x 10(-12) M, TNF-alpha at 10(-10) M, 10(-9) M, and 10(-8) M, and IL-6 at 4 x 10(-10) and 1.2 x 10(-9) M produced a dose-dependent inhibition of 3H-thymidine incorporation. The effects of IL-1 alpha, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 were cytostatic, not cytotoxic, because melanocytes remained viable following several treatments with the cytokines. Also, melanocytes treated with IL-1 alpha and TNF-alpha recovered and resumed proliferation after cessation of treatment. These effects of IL-1 alpha, IL-6 and TNF-alpha do not seem to be mediated by stimulation of eicosanoid production, because inhibition of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism by indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, and nordihydroguaiaretic acid, a lipoxygenase inhibitor, did not reverse the inhibitory effects on either proliferation or tyrosinase activity of NHM. This is the first demonstration that NHM respond to epidermal cytokines, and suggests a role for paracrine and possibly autocrine regulation of melanocytes by immune modulators.\r"

  ".W": "The involvement of proteoglycans in hair growth has been recognized through the observation of increased hair growth in diseases such as the mucopolysaccharidoses and pre-tibial myxedema, which involve an increase in skin proteoglycan content. In an attempt to understand this, we have examined the distribution of chondroitin 6 sulphate (C6S), unsulphated chondroitin (COS), dermatan sulphate (DS), and heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPG) in frozen tissue sections of normal scalp by immunostaining. Results show that during anagen, the thick connective tissue sheath around the follicle strains strongly for C6S, COS, and DS. COS is uniquely associated with this region and is not found beneath the epidermis or infundibular epithelium. HSPG is, however, localized in the basement membrane zone adjacent to the outer root sheath. In addition, all of these proteoglycans are localized in the dermal papilla. In mid-catagen, we observed significant loss of C6S and COS staining from both the dermal papilla and the connective tissue sheath, but no decrease in staining for HSPG. In late catagen, very little staining of C6S and COS was observed. In early anagen, we observed that C6S was again present in the connective tissue sheath and dermal papilla; however, COS staining appeared to be weaker and less closely associated with the follicle. HSPG staining was observed in early anagen in a pattern very similar to that found for other basement membrane components. Results for DS were not obtained for catagen or early anagen. These results provide further evidence that hair growth is associated with the presence of chondroitin proteoglycans in the follicle environment and that the cessation of growth is associated with their removal. Further studies are underway to characterize the relationship between hair growth and proteoglycans.\r"

Catalase (100 micrograms/ml) completely reversed the cytotoxic action of 0.3 mM dopac and reduced its tyrosinase-stimulating effect by approximately one half. The results show that extracellular hydrogen peroxide is a mediator of both the tyrosinase-stimulating and cytotoxic actions of dopac. Analysis of the degradation products of melanin from dopac-treated melanoma cells after hydriodic acid (HI) hydrolysis revealed the presence of aminohydroxy-phenylacetic acid (AHPAc). This substance is obtained by HI hydrolysis of melanin formed by oxidation of cysteinyl-dopac. Thus, the presence of AHPAc indicates that dopac is transported into the melanocytes where it serves as a substrate for tyrosinase.\r"

In addition, most of DH patients' sera contain IgA class anti-reticulin antibodies, anti-endomysium antibodies (EMA), and anti-jejunal antibodies (JAB) during times of gluten intake. In previous studies, JAB and EMA seemed to be identical and related to the group of anti-reticulin antibodies. In the present study, pre-embedding en bloc immunoelectronmicroscopic methods were applied for analysis of the ultrastructural binding sites of JAB on monkey and rabbit small bowels. These substrates were incubated with sera from DH patients strongly positive for JAB. Simultaneous investigations with the PAP technique and with 5 nm gold-labeled protein A or second antibodies visualized the bound IgA identically: it was associated with collagen fibrils underlying the epithelial and cryptal basement membranes and with collagen fibrils around capillaries. Staining was also detected along the endomysial collagen fibrils of smooth muscle layers, around elastica and smooth muscle cells of blood vessel walls, and along collagen fibrils near smooth muscle cells in the lamina propria. Neither the peroxidase product nor gold deposition was detected directly on the fibers, but was associated with amorphous material surrounding collagen fibers of different diameters. The distribution of JAB-stained structures corresponded to the localization of reticulin network of the small bowel. Our data indicate that JAB recognize an antigen or antigens associated with an amorphous component of the reticulin-collagen structure of jejunum and may have identical binding sites, as anti-reticulin antibodies and EMA.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin-8 (IL-8), formerly known as NAP-1, is formed by a variety of cells upon stimulation with IL-1 or tumor necrosis factor (TNF). The biologic activity of the cytokine involves activation of almost every neutrophil function studied so far in different species. In the present study, we compared the effects of recombinant human IL-8 (rIL-8) and the lipid mediators, leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and platelet-activating factor (PAF), on neutrophil functions in dogs. All three chemotactic factors induced neutrophil aggregation and chemotaxis, with rIL-8 being far more potent than LTB4 and PAF. The migration induced by rIL-8 was significantly greater than that observed towards LTB4 and PAF. In the aggregation assay, rIL-8 was shown for the first time to be a potent stimulant. The aggregation response was more persistent than that obtained with LTB4 and PAF and the potency of rIL-8 was greater. An intradermal dose-response study showed that rIL-8 is an extremely potent inducer of selective neutrophil infiltration in canine skin. The infiltration was more pronounced than following injection of LTB4 or PAF. It was proposed that the superior effect of rIL-8 was caused by a synergistic effect between injected rIL-8 and LTB4, which was shown to be produced in biologically active amounts by canine neutrophils stimulated with rIL-8. From a therapeutic point of view, the simultaneous presence of rIL-8 and LTB4 in inflammatory skin diseases highlights the need to develop drugs that inhibit the production and/or effect of both mediators.\r"

  ".W": "Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) is a primary mediator in the pathogenesis of infection, tissue injury and inflammation. It is synthesised by various activated, phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells, and a wide variety of infectious or inflammatory stimulae are capable of triggering TNF biosynthesis. Recent studies indicate that overproduction of TNF in septicaemia is a critical step in triggering septic shock and multiple organ damage. Intravenous administration of recombinant human TNF induced the same types of derangement in cardiovascular homatologic, inflammatory and metabolic homeostasis that are found with endotoxic or septic shock. Chronic TNF production causes a potentially lethal syndrome of cachexia, anaemia, and protein and lipid wasting. Several investigators have recently demonstrated elevated levels of serum TNF in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), these levels being closely correlated with the severity of the disease. This review discusses the role of TNF in the pathophysiology of AIDS and of several disorders associated with the latter. In addition, it discusses the interactions between TNF and several agents used in AIDS therapy, and suggests the use of TNF-antagonists in combination as a therapeutic regimen for AIDS patients.\r"

After immediate postexercise planar imaging, patients received either i.v. ribose (3.3 mg/kg/min x 30 min) or saline as a control. Additional imaging was performed 1 and 4 hr postexercise. Reversible defects were identified by count-profile analysis. Significantly more (nearly twice as many) reversible 201Tl defects were identified on the post-ribose images compared to the post-saline (control) images at both 1 and 4 hr postexercise (p less than 0.001). Quantitative analyses of the coronary arteriogram was available in 13 patients and confirmed that the additional reversible defects were in myocardial regions supplied by stenosed arteries. We conclude that ribose appears to facilitate 201Tl redistribution in patients with CAD and enhances identification of ischemic myocardium.\r"

Animals had access ad libitum to the AIN-76A purified diet (control) or were given 65% of the intake of controls for 3 wk. The high fat diet was isoenergetic to the control diet by substituting corn oil for equal energy from carbohydrate and addition of cellulose to obtain equal energy density. Activities of arylhydrocarbon hydroxylase and 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase were significantly increased in lungs of food-restricted rats and decreased by the high fat diet but were not altered in liver. Both diets increased arylhydrocarbon hydroxylase approximately twofold in kidney. Glucose 6-phosphate and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase were lowered in lung, kidney and liver by the high fat diet. Hepatic glutathione S-transferase was increased by high fat feeding. Food restriction decreased activities of arylsulfatase and beta-glucuronidase about 40% in lung. Hepatic arylsulfatase was also decreased about 40% by this treatment. Changes in hydrolase activities in livers and lungs of animals maintained on restricted diets raises in the interesting possibility that net production of glucuronide and sulfate conjugates of carcinogens by the liver and their hydrolysis in lung is altered by food restriction.\r"

  ".W": "A major question in the pathogenesis of AIDS encephalopathy and dementia is whether HIV-1 directly infects cells of the central nervous system (CNS). The propagation of HIV was attempted in six cell lines: three related and three unrelated to the nervous system. HIV was able to propagate in two human neuroblastoma cell lines and a lymphocytic cell line control but did not result in infections of African green monkey kidney cells, human cervix carcinoma cells, and one human brain astrocytoma cell line. Neuroblastoma cell lines infected with HIV showed peaks of reverse transcriptase activity at 10-14 days postinfection. After prolonged growth in cell cultures, one of the neuroblastoma cell lines showed multiphasic virus production, additional high peaks of reverse transcriptase activity, 20-fold greater than the first, lasting from 36 to 74 days and 110 to 140 days postinfection. The presence of HIV was confirmed by p24 antigen capture. The neuroblastoma cell lines had weak but detectable levels of CD4 immunoreactivity by immunoperoxidase and flow immunocytometric analysis. Although no T4-specific RNA sequences were detected by hybridization of Northern blots of total and poly A-selected RNA extracted from the two neuroblastoma cell lines by using a T4 specific complimentary DNA probe, monoclonal antibodies to the CD4 receptor blocked HIV infection in both neuroblastoma cell lines. Thus, the infection of neuroblastoma cells by HIV occurs in part by a CD4-dependent mechanism. Passaging the neuroblastoma cell lines weekly and bimonthly resulted in similar cell cycle-DNA content patterns for the more permissive cell line and with significant numbers of cells in the S phase. HIV-infected neuroblastoma cell lines provide an in vitro model for the evaluation of virus-host cell interactions and may be useful in addressing the issue of the persistence of HIV in the human CNS.\r"

Mononuclear leukocytes were obtained before administering the drug, and after 3 and 6 months of treatment. The cells were stimulated with lectins in order to assess variations of mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation and production of gamma-interferon (IFN) and interleukin-2 (IL-2), and with Newcastle disease virus (NDV) to assess variations of alpha-IFN production. Mean proliferative responses to PHA and Con-A did not show any significant change between baseline, 3 months, and 6 months values (25,158 +/- 11,763, 24,662 +/- 8,955, and 34,924 +/- 16,283 D-cpm, respectively, for PHA, p greater than 0.05; and 5,470 +/- 1,890, 4,953 +/- 2,518, and 4,539 +/- 3,286 D-cpm, respectively, for Con-A, p less than 0.05).

We investigated the relationship of 3-year mortality to duration of dialysis in a 1984-1985 national random sample of 600 hemodialysis patients from 36 dialysis units. Mortality was negatively associated with duration of dialysis treatments, as shown by the Cox model, adjusted for other patient and dialysis unit covariates. With adjustment for other covariates, patients receiving an average dialysis treatment duration of less than 3.5 hours had relative mortality risks of 1.17 to 2.18 compared with those with treatments longer than 3.5 hours (mortality risk of 1.0). Reverse causation (the possibility that more seriously ill patients received dialysis for a shorter time) appears unlikely. We conclude that duration of the dialysis procedure is an important element in determining patient mortality as one of the factors determining the adequacy of dialysis.\r"

This treatment also reversed the inhibitory effect of cystic fibrosis ELF on pseudomonas killing by neutrophils, which suggests that it may augment host defence in cystic fibrosis.\r"

The peak-to-peak amplitudes and voltage-time areas of the responses were measured at rest, between 40 maximum voluntary contractions (each lasting 3 s) and also during a 2-min recovery period. In 34 of the 36 control muscles the M-waves potentiated during the period of intermittent voluntary contractions. In the MMD patients, however, the M waves exhibited initial declines in 25 of 30 muscles. In the APB and EDB muscles the normalized mean values for the smallest M-waves, recorded during the 350 s total observation periods, differed significantly between the 2 groups of subjects.

These data may not represent true normal values. Cordocentesis (ultrasound-guided blood sampling from the umbilical cord) is a technique that allows investigation of physiologic processes in fetuses not under stress. METHODS. We measured serum thyroid-stimulating hormone, total and free thyroxine (T4), total and free triiodothyronine (T3), and thyroxine-binding globulin in blood samples from 62 fetuses. The samples were obtained by cordocentesis (n = 58) or cardiocentesis (n = 4) at 12 to 37 weeks of gestation. Maternal serum samples were obtained immediately before fetal blood sampling. RESULTS. Fetal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroxine-binding globulin, and total and free T4 and T3 concentrations increased significantly with the length of gestation (P less than 0.001). The only significant association among these variables, independent of the length of gestation, was between thyroid-stimulating hormone and free T4 (P less than 0.0001). Maternal serum concentrations of these variables did not change during gestation, and there was no significant relation between fetal and maternal values. Most fetal serum concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone were higher, whereas most serum total and free T3 concentrations were lower than the respective values for normal adults. The fetal serum total T4, free T4, and thyroxine-binding globulin values reached the level of the mean adult values at approximately 36 weeks of gestation. CONCLUSIONS. The increases in fetal serum concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroxine-binding globulin, and total and free T4 and T3 during gestation reflect increasing maturation of the pituitary, thyroid, and liver. The finding of increasing fetal serum concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone in the presence of increasing thyroid hormone concentrations suggests that the sensitivity of the fetal pituitary gland to negative feedback is limited or is counterbalanced by increasing stimulation by thyrotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Pituitary adenomas that arise from the gonadotroph cells are being recognized with increasing frequency in men, but they are still rarely recognized in women. This rarity could be the result of an actual difference in occurrence or of greater difficulty in recognition. The tumors are usually recognized in men more than 50 years old, but elevated serum gonadotropin levels in women of that age could be produced by normal gonadotroph cells. METHODS. Because the stimulation of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and the beta subunit of LH (LH beta) by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is a characteristic of gonadotroph adenomas in men, we administered TRH to 16 women with apparently nonsecreting pituitary macroadenomas and measured serum FSH, LH, LH beta, and the glycoprotein hormone alpha subunit every 15 minutes for 90 minutes before and 90 minutes after. The results were compared with the responses in 16 healthy women matched for age and in 10 women with macroadenomas secreting prolactin, growth hormone, or corticotropin. The tumors from 12 of the women with nonsecreting adenomas were cultured, and the secretion of FSH, LH, and LH beta in culture was determined. RESULTS. Eleven of the 16 women with apparently nonsecreting adenomas had significant increases in serum LH beta in response to TRH, 3 had FSH responses, and 4 had LH responses. None of the 16 healthy women and none of the 10 women with secreting macroadenomas had LH beta, FSH, or LH responses to TRH. Ten of the 12 adenomas that were cultured secreted readily detectable amounts of FSH, LH, and LH beta, and their secretion in vitro correlated with the patients' responses to TRH in vivo. CONCLUSIONS. Most apparently nonsecreting pituitary macroadenomas in women arise from gonadotroph cells. The majority of these can be recognized, even in postmenopausal women, by the serum LH beta responses to TRH, and some can be recognized by the responses of serum FSH and LH.\r"

  ".W": "A collection of superantigens, molecules which in combination with class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) engage T cells bearing particular V beta chains as part of their alpha beta receptors, have recently been described. The mouse self superantigen, Mls-1a, for example, in conjunction with many MHC class II proteins, engages mouse T cells bearing V beta 6, 7, 8.1 and 9, almost regardless of the sequences of the other variable components of the receptors on the T cells. Two types of superantigen have been identified so far: first, superantigens encoded in the mouse genome, such as Mls-1a; second, superantigens produced by bacteria, such as the staphylococcal enterotoxins. Although the latter type of superantigens are in many cases known to be proteins of about 220 amino acids, nothing is known about the structures of any of the superantigens encoded in mouse. Here we describe the properties of a new mouse superantigen. The antigen is maternally transmitted in milk and is probably encoded by a mammary tumour virus (MTV). Given the known genetic linkage between at least one of the mouse genomic superantigens and endogenous MTV integration sites, it is tempting to speculate that the superantigen described here and some of the endogenous mouse superantigens are encoded by MTVs.\r"

The minor lymphocyte stimulation antigens (Mls) effect these deletions through interactions with the V beta portion of the T-cell receptor, thus mimicking bacterial 'superantigens'. Intrigued by the fact that each known Mls gene maps to the same chromosomal region as an endogenous mouse mammary tumour virus (Mtv), we reevaluated the linkage relationships between the two gene families. Here we report perfect concordance in inbred and recombinant inbred mice between the presence of four Mtv proviruses with the expression of Mls gene products. These data suggest a general model in which mammary tumour virus gene products themselves are the ligands that shape a considerable portion of the immunological repertoire of common laboratory mice.\r"

  ".W": "A special class of self-antigens (endogenous superantigens) is capable of deleting many murine T cells on the basis of their expression of particular T-cell receptor V beta gene segments. In mice that endogenously express these antigens, tolerance is mediated in part by the clonal deletion of the relevant V beta-bearing T cells. The deletion of I-E-reactive V beta 5.2-bearing T cells is dependent on the coexpression of an I-E tolerogenic coligand (Etc)14 and the gene for one of these coligands, Etc-1, maps to chromosome 12, near the mouse mammary tumour viral integrant, Mtv-9. Here we report a perfect genetic linkage between Etc-1 and Mtv-9 and show that Etc-1 is also involved in the I-E-dependent deletion of T cells bearing V beta 5.1 and V beta 11 domains. We also demonstrate that Mtv-9 transcripts are present in B cells expressing Etc-1 and suggest that the coligand recognized by roughly 15% of all T lymphocytes is encoded by the Mtv-9 genome.\r"

  ".U": "91125482\r", 
  ".W": "The T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire is selected in the thymus after rearrangement of genes encoding TCR alpha and beta chains. Selection is based on the recognition by newly emergent T cells of self-ligands associated with molecules of the major histocompatibility complex: some combinations result in positive selection, others in negative selection. Negative selection, or clonal deletion, is an important mechanism for eliminating autoreactive T cells. A group of self-ligands involved in clonal deletion was identified because they, like exogenous superantigens, were recognized by almost all T cells expressing particular TCR V beta genes. V beta 17a T cells are deleted by a tissue-specific ligand; V beta 6, V beta 7, V beta 8.1 and V beta 9 T cells are deleted by the minor lymphocyte-stimulating (Mls) determinant Mls-1a; V beta 3 T cells by Mls-2a and Mls-3a; V beta 11 T cells by ligands encoded by independently segregating genes; and V beta 5 T cells by ligands encoded by two genes. Chromosome mapping using recombinant inbred strains of mice and classic backcrosses show that Mls-1a in DBA/2 mice is encoded on chromosome 1, that one of the two ligand genes for deletion of V beta 5 T cells maps to chromosome 12 and that a ligand gene for V beta 11 deletion is linked to the CD8 locus on chromosome 6. Here we present evidence from three sets of backcross mice for concordance between V beta 11 deletion ligand genes on chromosomes 6, 12 and 14 and endogenous mouse mammary tumour virus integrant (Mtv) genomes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The partition between CD4+CD8- and CD4-CD8+ T cells is generally considered to be irreversible, although a small percentage of circulating CD3+ T lymphocytes coexpressing CD4 and CD8 molecules has been identified. It has been suggested that in CD8+ T cells the CD4 genes may be methylated and thus highly repressed, whereas in CD4+ T cells the CD8 genes are unmethylated and their transcription can be induced by physiological stimuli such as interleukin-4. Here, we demonstrate that infection with human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), a virus proposed as a potential cofactor in AIDS, dramatically upregulates the expression of CD4--the receptor for human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1)--in a human neoplastic T-cell line. More importantly, HHV-6 induces de novo expression of CD4 messenger RNA and protein in normal mature CD8+ T lymphocytes, rendering them susceptible to infection with HIV-1. These findings demonstrate that human CD3+CD4-CD8+ T lymphocytes can reacquire CD4 in the post-thymic life and elucidate a novel mechanism--receptor regulation--through which HHV-6 may positively interact with HIV-1 in coinfected patients.\r"

Several patients benefited from anticholinergic medications and a few from carbamazepine. Levodopa was the most effective treatment in all cases. In the majority, there was an excellent response, with continued long-term clinical stability on levodopa therapy for as long as 10 to 22 years. Four men with sporadic disease and 1 woman with a sister affected with adolescent-onset parkinsonism had similar initial treatment response, but developed \"wearing-off\" and a less satisfactory response to levodopa within the first few years of treatment. This indicates that some patients with clinical syndromes suggestive of DRD may not have an excellent prognosis on long-term levodopa treatment and may represent misclassified cases of childhood-onset parkinsonism.\r"

Immunohistochemistry with antibodies directed against individual subunits of COX differentiated the 2 phenotypes: the fatal infantile myopathy was characterized by absence of the nuclear DNA (nDNA)-encoded subunit VIIa,b of COX, while in the benign myopathy both VIIa,b and the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded subunit II were absent. Early differential diagnosis between fatal and benign COX-deficient myopathies is of critical importance for prognosis and management of these infants, because the benign form is initially life-threatening but ultimately reversible.\r"

In 17 subjects treated with a monthly goserelin implant, serum estradiol (E2) levels were suppressed into the menopausal range. Mean decreases from pre-treatment values in the lumbar spine and femoral neck were -5.7 and -3.8% at 3 months and -8.2 and -7.7% at 6 months of treatment, respectively; lumbar spine values were significantly different (P less than .05) from those of the control group, whose values changed little during the same period. Significant increases over baseline values were also observed in urinary calcium-creatinine ratio and serum alkaline phosphatase. In nine danazol-treated subjects, serum E2 levels were generally within the early follicular-phase range. There were no significant changes in bone assessments. Normal menses returned within 2 months after cessation of either medication. Six months after goserelin treatment, the lumbar spine and femoral neck bone mineral content was still reduced but to values not significantly different from the pre-treatment and control values; urinary calcium-creatinine ratio was decreased, whereas serum alkaline phosphatase was still elevated. The rapid and deep suppression of ovarian steroidogenesis by a monthly goserelin implant induced significant bone loss compared with the control and danazol groups. This loss was not reversed completely 6 months after cessation of treatment, but bone densities at that time were not different from those of controls. Studies of larger numbers of patients followed for longer periods will be required to resolve the question of complete reversibility.\r"

We have isolated a genomic clone encoding the yeast FKBP (FKB1). The gene encodes a protein of 114 amino acids having a calculated Mr of 12,158. Disruption of the gene shows that FKB1 is not essential for growth. A search of translated nucleic acid data bases revealed bacterial FKBP homologs in Neisseria meningiditis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Comparison of the conserved amino acids in FKBP homologs with the conserved amino acids in the cyclophilins has revealed a region of similarity that we speculate to be a homologous domain related to the functional similarities of the two proteins.\r"

The reduced capability to remove bacteria is associated with increased mortality due to these bacteria. There is a dose-dependent relationship between the phospholipase A2 inhibitor dexamethasone and both the reduced bacterial clearance and increased larval mortality. The dexamethasone effects on larval survival were reversed by treatment with arachidonic acid. Maleic acid, a nonspecific antioxidant, did not interfere with the insects' ability to remove bacterial cells from hemolymph. The larvae were shown to contain all of the C20 polyunsaturated fatty acids necessary for eicosanoid biosynthesis and to be capable of converting radioactive arachidonic acid into several primary prostaglandins. These results strongly suggest that eicosanoids mediate transduction of bacterial infection signals into the complex of cellular and humoral responses that comprise invertebrate immunity.\r"

  ".W": "Treatment of T cells with staphylococcal enterotoxins in vitro is known to activate T cells in a subset restricted manner based on beta-chain variable region (V beta) gene expression. In particular, staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) activates T cells bearing V beta 7 or V beta 8. We examined the ability of SEB to activate T cells in vivo. Treatment of C3H mice with doses of SEB ranging from 5 to 250 micrograms resulted in a dose-dependent activation of V beta 8+ T cells as reflected by increased interleukin 2 receptor (IL-2R) expression, proliferation to exogenous IL-2 and allogeneic cells, and production of gamma interferon. SEB also caused proliferation of the CD8+ subset of V beta 8+ cells in vivo. Thus, T-cell activation by SEB in vivo appears to be specific since V beta 2+ cells (non-SEB reactive) did not show increases in IL-2R expression similar to those seen with V beta 8+ cells nor did they proliferate. We then studied the ability of these activated cells to potentiate the immune response to a malignant progressor tumor. Treatment of C3H mice with 50 micrograms of SEB at the time of inoculation with tumor fragments resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the frequency of tumor outgrowth. These data demonstrate that treatment of C3H mice with SEB results in specific activation of V beta 8+ cells in vivo and that these activated cells are capable of preventing the outgrowth of a malignant tumor.\r"

Upon insertion into the r gene, this chimeric element generated an 8-bp target-site duplication, characteristic of P elements. At the non-P-element end of the insertion, the first 8 bp are identical to the first 8 bp of the inverted terminal repeats of the P element. Thus, this element has inverted terminal repeats of 8 bp. This large element can excise from the r gene under conditions of hybrid dysgenesis, which indicates that it behaves like a normal P element. These data support the conclusion that a normally stable single-copy sequence has now become unstable and duplicated within the genome.\r"

  ".W": "Although in vitro experiments have established that extrinsic pathway inhibitor (EPI) is the only known plasma inhibitor of factor VIIa-tissue factor (TF) catalytic activity of potential physiologic significance, evidence of its function in vivo has been lacking. TF-induced intravascular coagulation may occur in patients despite normal plasma levels of EPI and, in our earlier studies, normal plasma EPI levels did not protect rabbits from intravascular coagulation induced by an infusion of purified TF (1 microgram/kg). Studies have now been carried out in which plasma EPI levels were reduced in rabbits to below 20% of the initial level by injection of anti-rabbit EPI IgG. Infusion into such animals of purified rabbit TF apoprotein (0.25 microgram/kg) reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles induced substantial disseminated intravascular coagulation. Infusion of control saline or phospholipid vesicles not containing TF was without significant effect as was infusion of TF (0.25 microgram/kg) into animals injected with nonimmune goat IgG. These data establish that EPI can dampen TF-induced intravascular coagulation in rabbits. They support the hypothesis that EPI plays a significant role in regulating coagulation resulting from the exposure of blood to trace concentrations of TF during the illnesses and minor injuries of normal existence.\r"

While the alpha subunits of these heterodimeric proteins can be interchanged without effect on receptor-binding specificity, their beta subunits differ and direct hormone binding to either LH/CG or FSH receptors. Previous studies employing chemical modifications of the hormones, monoclonal antibodies, or synthetic peptides have implicated hCG beta-subunit residues between Cys-38 and Cys-57 and corresponding regions of hLH beta and hFSH beta in receptor recognition and activation. Since the beta subunits of hCG or hLH and hFSH exhibit very little sequence similarity in this region, we postulated that these residues might contribute to hormone specificity. To test this hypothesis we constructed chimeric hCG/hFSH beta subunits, coexpressed them with the human alpha subunit, and examined their ability to interact with LH and FSH receptors and hormone-specific monoclonal antibodies. Surprisingly, substitution of hFSH beta residues 33-52 for hCG beta residues 39-58 had no effect on receptor binding or stimulation. However, substitution of hFSH beta residues 88-108 in place of the carboxyl terminus of hCG beta (residues 94-145) resulted in a hormone analog identical to hFSH in its ability to bind and stimulate FSH receptors. The altered binding specificity displayed by this analog is not attributable solely to the replacement of hCG beta residues 108-145 or substitution of residues in the \"determinant loop\" located between hCG beta residues 93 and 100.\r"

When two rabbit immunoglobulin-specific helper-T-cell clones were mixed, either separately or together, with splenic B cells in the presence of the antigen rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibodies, stable T-cell-B-cell conjugates were seen up to 29 hr later. Microscopic observations of these cells revealed that interferon gamma and interleukin 2, inside one of the T-cell clones, and interleukins 4 and 5, inside the other T-cell clone, were concentrated very close to the T-cell-B-cell contact area. The cytokines were not seen in the T cells prior to their interaction with the B cells and their production was strictly antigen-specific. These studies show, at the single-cell level, that helper-T-cell clones can remain bound to splenic B cells long enough for the T cells to produce cytokines, which are synthesized near the bound B cells. We propose that the polarized synthesis of the cytokines may result in their directed secretion toward the bound B cells. By locally secreting the cytokines, which are not antigen-specific, at the contacting T-cell-B-cell membranes, where T- and B-cell surface receptors are engaged and clustered, the helper T cells can induce selective and specific B-cell responses.\r"

Here we demonstrate that tube mutations also have a zygotic effect on pupal morphology and that this phenotype is shared by mutations in Toll and pelle, two genes with apparent intracellular roles in determining dorsoventral polarity. We then describe the isolation of a functionally full-length tube cDNA identified in a phenotypic rescue assay. The tube mRNA is expressed maximally early in embryogenesis and again late in larval development, corresponding to required periods of tube activity as defined by distinct maternal and zygotic loss-of-function phenotypes in tube mutants. Sequence analysis of the cDNA indicates that the tube protein contains five copies of an eight-residue motif and shares no significant sequence similarity with known proteins. These results suggest that tube represents a class of protein active in signal transduction at two stages of development.\r"

The c-jun protooncogene codes for an important component of the AP-1 transcription factor complex, which regulates the expression of many unlinked genes. Repeated experiments have shown that Tam rapidly increases the steady-state c-jun mRNA levels in the avian oviduct but decreases the levels in the liver. The Tam effects are time- and dose-dependent. These results are supported by other studies that have demonstrated that 17 beta-estradiol decreases steady-state levels of c-jun protooncogene mRNA in oviducts of animals fully withdrawn from estradiol. The effect of Tam in the avian oviduct is in contrast to the reported effects of Tam on the expression of practically all other genes in the avian oviduct and other animal tissues. Transcription analyses using nuclear runoff experiments with oviduct nuclei demonstrate a decrease in the c-jun gene transcription within minutes after Tam treatment with a return to 75% of control values by 4 hr. The fact that Tam transiently decreases the transcription of the c-jun gene but increases the steady-state c-jun mRNA levels suggests that Tam must alter both transcriptional and post-transcriptional events. The results support a role of the c-jun protooncogene as a regulatory gene in the cascade model for steroid action whereby steroids rapidly regulate the regulatory genes, which in turn regulate many other structural genes.\r"

  ".U": "91126103\r", 
  ".W": "Previous experiments have demonstrated that double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) can exert an antiproliferative effect on human tumor cells, independent of interferon (IFN) induction. However, the mechanism by which dsRNAs inhibit tumor growth has not been elucidated. As a first step in determining the molecular events responsible for growth arrest, we have explored the role of signal transduction through the cAMP system in the antiproliferative effect of the mismatched dsRNA, r(I)n.r(C12,U)n (Ampligen). These studies utilized the human glioma cell line A1235, which does not produce detectable levels of IFN-alpha, -beta, or -gamma in response to mismatched dsRNA treatment. Treatment of A1235 cells with mismatched dsRNA in combination with either 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7), which inhibits cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C, or N-(2-guanidinoethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (HA1004), which preferentially inhibits the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, yielded an antagonism of the mismatched dsRNA-induced antiproliferative effect. Measurement of adenylate cyclase activation showed a dose-dependent increase in activity at antiproliferative mismatched dsRNA concentrations, but not at lower, nonantiproliferative doses. This increase in activity was rapid, seen as early as 30 sec after initiation of treatment, and it was sustained at peak levels for 1-2 hr. Analysis of the intracellular cAMP concentration gave similar kinetics of induction. Exposure of cells to the stable cAMP analogue dibutyryl cAMP yielded dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth. The cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine also inhibited proliferation. In contrast, neither H-7 nor HA1004 had an effect on growth inhibition induced by human natural IFN-alpha treatment. In addition, antiproliferative doses of IFN-alpha did not increase cAMP concentrations. These results indicate that the cAMP system is utilized by mismatched dsRNA as an early signal transduction mechanism for growth control. Furthermore, the antiproliferative effects induced by mismatched dsRNA and IFN can occur by different mechanisms of action.\r"

The purification was achieved in a single step using a C5a affinity column in which the C5a molecule was coupled to the resin through its N terminus. The purified receptor, like the crude solubilized molecule, exhibited a single class of high-affinity binding sites with a Kd of 30 pM. Further, the binding of C5a retained its sensitivity to guanine nucleotides, implying that the purified receptor contained a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein). SDS/PAGE revealed the presence of three polypeptides with molecular masses of 42, 40, and 36 kDa, which were determined to be the C5a-binding subunit and the alpha and beta subunits of Gi, respectively. The 36- and 40-kDa polypeptides were identified by immunoblotting and by the ability of pertussis toxin to ADP-ribosylate the 40-kDa molecule. These results confirm our earlier hypothesis that the receptor exists as a complex with a G protein in the presence or absence of C5a. The tight coupling between the receptor and G protein should make possible the identification of the G protein(s) involved in the transduction pathways used by C5a to produce its many biological effects.\r"

  ".W": "To understand the principles of control and selectivity in gene expression, the biochemical mechanisms by which promoter- and enhancer-binding factors regulate transcription by RNA polymerase II were analyzed. A general observed repressor of transcription was purified and identified as histone H1. Since many aspects of H1 binding to naked DNA resemble its interaction with chromatin, purified H1 bound to naked DNA was used as a model for the repressed state of the DNA template. Three sequence-specific transcription factors, Sp1, GAL4-VP16, and GAGA factor, were shown to counteract H1-mediated repression (antirepression). In addition, Sp1 and GAL4-VP16, but not the GAGA factor, activated transcription in the absence of H1. Therefore, true activation and antirepression appear to be distinct activities of sequence-specific factors. Furthermore, transcription antirepression by GAL4-VP16 was sustained for several rounds of transcription. These findings, together with previous studies on H1, suggest that H1 participates in repression of the genome in the ground state and that sequence-specific transcription factors induce selected genes by a combination of true activation and release of basal repression that is mediated at least in part by H1.\r"

  ".W": "Putative Alzheimer disease (AD)-specific proteins (A68) were purified to homogeneity and shown to be major subunits of one form of paired helical filaments (PHFs). The amino acid sequence and immunological data indicate that the backbone of A68 is indistinguishable from that of the protein tau (tau), but A68 could be distinguished from normal human tau by the degree to which A68 was phosphorylated and by the specific residues in A68 that served as phosphate acceptors. The larger apparent relative molecular mass (Mr) of A68, compared to normal human tau, was attributed to abnormal phosphorylation of A68 because enzymatic dephosphorylation of A68 reduced its Mr to close to that of normal tau. Moreover, the LysSerProVal motif in normal human tau appeared to be an abnormal phosphorylation site in A68 because the Ser in this motif was a phosphate acceptor site in A68, but not in normal human tau. Thus, the major subunits of a class of PHFs are A68 proteins and the excessive or inappropriate phosphorylation of normal tau may change its apparent Mr, thus transforming tau into A68.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin-2 therapy leads to respiratory dysfunction caused by increased vascular permeability. This study examines the role of oxygen-derived free radicals (OFR). Sheep (n = 6) with chronic lung lymph fistulae were given interleukin-2, 10(5) units/kg, as an intravenous bolus. The mean pulmonary artery pressure rose from 13 to 23 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) at 1 hour and remained elevated for 4 hours, although the pulmonary artery wedge pressure was unchanged at 4 mm Hg. Arterial oxygen tension fell from 88 to 77 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). Lung lymph flow rose from 2.2 to 6.4 ml/30 min (p less than 0.05) at 3 hours. This rise coincided with an increase in the lymph/plasma protein ratio from 0.67 to 0.77 (p less than 0.05) and lymph protein clearance from 1.5 to 4.4 ml/30 min (p less than 0.05), indicating increased lung microvascular permeability. Interleukin-2 led to transient increases in plasma thromboxane B2 from 168 to 388 pg/ml (p less than 0.05) and lung lymph thromboxane B2 from 235 to 694 pg/ml (p less than 0.05). The leukocyte count fell from 8156 to 4375/mm3 (p less than 0.05) primarily caused by a 78% drop in lymphocyte count. Platelet count declined from 292 to 184 X 10(3)/mm3 (p less than 0.05). Pretreatment with the hydroxyl radical scavenger dimethylthiourea, 1 gm/kg, intravenously, (n = 6) prevented the interleukin-2-induced increase in mean pulmonary artery pressure, lung lymph flow, lymph/plasma protein ration, lymph protein clearance, and thromboxane B2 levels in plasma and lung lymph. The arterial oxygen tension decreased from 85 to 80 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). The leukocyte count declined from 7854 to 6229/mm3 (p less than 0.05), but this was not as low nor as prolonged as the interleukin-2 group. Further, the decrease in platelet count was prevented (p less than 0.05). Interleukin-2 incubated with sheep or human leukocytes led to a dose-dependent increase in intracellular hydrogen peroxide production by neutrophils as measured by flow cytometry of dichlorofluorescein oxidation. These data indicate that interleukin-2 stimulates OFR generation and that OFR moderate the interleukin-2-induced increased lung permeability.\r"

Local hypoxia with later secondary organ failure may develop, however, despite an often hyperdynamic circulation. The splanchnic organs seem to be of vital importance in this context. In experiments performed in pigs we compared total body VO2 and DO2 with oxygen consumption and delivery in the gastrointestinal organs and the liver in two different shock states: (1) septic shock induced by peritonitis (n = 6) and (2) hemorrhagic shock (n = 6). Another group of six animals not in shock served as controls. Total, gastrointestinal, and liver DO2 decreased in a similar pattern in both septic and hemorrhagic shock. Gastrointestinal and liver VO2 increased in sepsis, whereas it was unchanged in hemorrhage. In the later phase of sepsis, liver VO2, but not gastrointestinal VO2, again decreased, because liver oxygen extraction was almost total and liver DO2 decreased further. The development of flow-dependent liver hypoxia was reflected in a decrease in liver lactate turnover (increased liver lactate release) during late sepsis. Early hypoxia in the splanchnic region is suggested as a plausible mechanism behind the development of secondary organ failure, especially in sepsis.\r"

The selection of the method for androgen ablation in a given patient with stage D adenocarcinoma of the prostate should be based on patient preference and on cost, because the therapeutic outcomes of medical castration and orchiectomy are equivalent. The addition of androgen receptor antagonists to a given patient's regimen should be made with the knowledge that the impact on the mortality rate is modest and the cost significant. Further manipulation of androgen production or action in patients with hormonally resistant cancer is unlikely to improve either the disease progression or the mortality rate. Research efforts should be focused on the development of effective chemotherapy for such disease.\r"

This improvement in survival rate is not a huge advance but is a step in the right direction. Future clinical trials are needed to evaluate newer methods to improve survival rates. The results also open up the possibility of employing this combined androgen blockade in earlier stages of prostate cancer in order to delay progression of the cancer and perhaps improve patient survival. Only carefully constructed clinical trials will be able to answer these questions.\r"

Thus, a delay in the appearance of progression has not improved survival. In fact, the duration of survival after progression tends to be shorter on Zoladex plus flutamide. There is thus no evidence to suggest any survival benefit with Zoladex plus flutamide. The quality control of our data revealed acknowledged problems in defining responses in patients with advanced prostate cancer. The review of the Bone Scan Committee provided the data for Tables 5 to 7. These data must provoke some reflections and emphasize once again the heterogeneity of the studied patient population. Table 4 on pain response after 4 weeks is just one of the many items to be analyzed by the committees for response criteria and quality of life. We expect that the other trials face similar problems. More work and patience are needed to obtain a firm answer to this clinical problem. These efforts will never be wasted, however, because the combined results of these trials will increase our knowledge of the treated history of prostate cancer and will, we hope, indicate a net treatment benefit in some subsets of patients. An individually tailored treatment for each patient selected from the anonymous mass of cases of advanced prostate cancer would be the highest reward of our continued collaboration with all the study groups.\r"

The four tumors were composed of uniform round cells often surrounded by a lacunar space. The tumors often contained a peripheral zone of metaplastic bone. The cellularity was high, but the mitotic rate was low, suggesting a benign or borderline nature of the lesion. Longer follow-up was available for three cases, showing recurrence-free survival times of 11, 8, and 3 years. Immunohistochemistry studies revealed that all tumors were strongly positive for S-100 protein and focally positive for Leu-7, whereas melanoma-specific marker HMB45 was negative. Vimentin was the main type of intermediate filament protein, and one case also contained scattered glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells. Epithelial markers (keratins, epithelial membrane antigen), desmin, and muscle actins were negative. Electron microscopic examination showed partial, sometimes reduplicated, basal lamina surrounding many cells. Complex cell processes were also present. No myofilaments were found. The immunohistochemical and electron microscopic results may suggest that this tumor has Schwann's cell differentiation.\r"

The measured blood-count parameters (i.e., white blood cells [WBCs], red blood cells [RBCs], hemoglobulin [Hb], mean corpuscular volume [MCV], and platelets [PLTs]), compared very well between the two aperture impedance-based systems; precision, linearity, and lack of carryover were excellent. The STKS WBC differential (DIFF), derived from a combination of aperture impedance, aperture conductance, and laser light scatter, also was precise; linear and carryover were insignificant. The DIFFs (n = 424) compared well to the manual WBC differentials, with r values of 0.97, 0.97, 0.73, and 0.86 for neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils, respectively. The DIFF and Suspect Flagging system produced 6.2% false negatives and 2.6% false positives when compared with the manual technique. These were further investigated and discussed. STKS DIFFs were stable for 18 to 24 hours in normal samples anticoagulated with K2EDTA and stored at 20 degrees C prior to analysis. Storage in the same anticoagulant at 4 degrees C and immediate aspiration preserved the DIFF analysis for considerably longer than 24 hours. These performance characteristics make the STKS a significant advancement in automated hematology.\r"

This report summarizes studies by our laboratory to investigate possible roles for calcium, sodium, membrane pumps, and the vasoactive hormones, atrial natriuretic peptide (hANP) and endothelin, in modulating the change in vascular reactivity characteristic of preeclampsia. Urinary calcium excretion, 1 alpha-25(OH)2D3 levels, and serum free calcium levels were all decreased, whereas parathyroid hormone levels and intraplatelet calcium concentrations were increased in women with preeclampsia. Erythrocyte sodium content was elevated, while red blood cell membrane Na-K-ATPase activity was decreased in patients with severe disease. Preeclamptics also had elevated levels of hANP, which failed to increase further when saline was infused or when blood pressure was increased transiently with angiotensin II administration. Finally, endothelin levels that are reduced in normal gestation, were increased in preeclampsia. While the cause of increased vascular reactivity is still unclear, there appear to be changes in the intracellular cation environment, combined with loss of compensating mechanisms, both at the membrane and humoral level, as well as enhanced concentrations of a potent vasoconstrictor in blood; all which lead to increases in vasoreactivity and blood pressure in preeclampsia.\r"

  ".W": "Immunofluorescence (IF) of urine sediment with antisera to light-chain immunoglobulins (LC) was used for patients with renal disease due to various monoclonal gammopathies. Urinary casts and/or masses from 20 of 27 patients (74%) of this group stained predominantly for one or another of the two LC, but from none of the 25 controls, who all had renal diseases other than monoclonal gammopathies. In all but one patient with monoclonal gammopathy the more intensely staining LC in the urine sediment was the same as that found in the paraprotein. For 68.7% of patients, the prevailing LC in urinary casts was the same as that prevailing in the casts of the renal biopsies. The sensitivity of IF of urine sediment for identifying patients with plasma cell dyscrasias was 74%, the specificity 100%, and the accuracy 86.5%. The positive predictive value was 100% and the negative predictive value was 78%. Globally, urine sediment IF was more sensitive than serum or urine electrophoresis (74% v 63% and 66.6%), but less than serum or urine immunoelectrophoresis (74% v 85%). In light-chain deposition disease, a disorder in which there are often no definite symptoms, urine sediment IF was more sensitive than both traditional methods. We conclude that IF of urine sediment is a useful test to identify patients with renal disease associated with monoclonal gammopathies.\r"

All patients underwent oxytocin induction of labor and crystalloid and/or colloid expansion to produce a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 10 to 15 mm Hg and a colloid osmotic pressure of greater than 17 mm Hg. Intravenous nitroglycerin was administered before induction of general anesthesia. The hemodynamic effects associated with endotracheal intubation revealed a change in the heart rate from 104 +/- 10 to 133 +/- 17 beats/min, an increase in mean arterial pressure from 134 +/- 12 to 164 +/- 32 mm Hg, and an increase in systemic vascular resistance from 1262 +/- 342 to 1351 +/- 259 dynes-sec-cm-5 that was accompanied by a small change in the cardiac index from 4.5 +/- 1.2 to 4.5 +/- 0.9 L.min-1.m-2.\r"

  ".W": "Nitric oxide is thought to be the endogenous endothelium-derived relaxing factor. We investigated the effects of compounds that either generate nitric oxide intracellularly or inhibit its action on the vasculature of the human placental villus. Addition to perfusion medium of methylene blue (10(5) mol/L), which is an inhibitor of activation of guanylate cyclase by nitric oxide, significantly increased perfusion pressure of the fetal-placental circulation over a range of flow rates (1 to 10 ml/min) compared with the perfusion pressures seen in the absence of methylene blue. This suggests basal release of nitric oxide may contribute to maintenance of resting vascular tone. Both glyceryl trinitrate (10(-9) to 5 x 10(6) mol/L) and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (10(-8) to 10(-4) mol/L), which generate nitric oxide intracellularly, were able to significantly vasodilate the fetal-placental circulation preconstricted with the thromboxane mimetic U46619 (1 to 5 x 10(-8) mol/L) in a concentration-dependent manner. These compounds had no effect in the absence of the vasoconstrictor. Thus it appears that the placental villus tree has the ability to both generate and respond to nitric oxide.\r"

The use of the video endoscope allowed laser surgery to be performed across a broad range of intranasal structural variations and provided an excellent medium for teaching this new technique.\r"

No morphologic evidence of tissue plasminogen activator toxicity was found in the rabbit retina at a dose of 25 to 50 micrograms/0.1 ml. Subretinal hemorrhage cleared faster after subretinal injection of tissue plasminogen activator when compared to balanced salt solution (P = .0005) but did not completely prevent overlying retinal degeneration. Both tissue plasminogen activator and balanced salt solution were found to decrease the toxic effects of subretinal blood on the morphologic characteristics of the rabbit retina, and this effect can be explained at least partly by dilution of the subretinal blood.\r"

Eleven cases of NLPHD and 19 cases of Hodgkin's disease of nodular sclerosis (NSHD) and mixed cellularity (MCHD) type were analyzed for immunoglobulin JH gene rearrangement. bcl-2 translocation was determined with Southern blot analysis and the polymerase chain reaction using biotin labeled probes to the major breakpoint region and the alkaline phosphatase reaction. All cases of NLPHD were negative for JH gene rearrangement and bcl-2 translocation. Cases of NSHD and MCHD were similarly negative for bcl-2, although three cases exhibited clonal JH gene rearrangements. These results confirm that a clonal B-cell population is not detected in NLPHD. Cases of NLPHD differ from most low-grade follicular B-cell lymphomas in that they lack bcl-2 gene rearrangement and t(14;18) translocation at the major breakpoint region.\r"

  ".W": "Juvenile ceroid lipofuscinosis, or Batten disease, is a hereditary disorder characterized by progressive visual loss, seizures, cognitive and psychomotor deterioration, and early death, usually between 15 and 35 years of age. Individuals with this disease have massive deposits of autofluorescent inclusion bodies in cells of most tissues. The accumulation of these intracellular deposits suggests that juvenile ceroid-lipofuscinosis is a storage disease resulting from the inability of cells to metabolize some normal cellular constituent. It has been reported that the storage material is largely protein, much of which is a specific mitochondrial protein that apparently is not properly metabolized in subjects with Batten disease. The storage bodies were partially purified from the retinas of two siblings who died as a result of juvenile ceroid lipofuscinosis, as well as from the cerebral cortex of an unrelated individual with this disorder. Chromatographic analysis of storage body protein acid hydrolysates indicated that they contained a large amount of the modified amino acid epsilon-N-trimethyllysine. The abundance of this amino acid in the storage protein suggests that the disease may result from excessive methylation or from a failure to demethylate intermediate forms of the stored proteins. Acid hydrolysis also solubilized a fluorescent component from the retinal storage material, suggesting that the stored protein has a bound fluorescent adduct.\r"

  ".U": "91127629\r", 
  ".W": "A central unresolved issue in Alzheimer's disease is the origin of the extracellular amyloid beta protein (A beta P) found in senile plaques and its relationship to the dystrophic neurites that intimately surround it. Here the presence and distribution within senile plaques of various epitopes of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) are compared with the distribution of A beta P itself and markers for plaque neurites. Several principal findings emerge: 1) antibodies to regions of APP outside of A beta P ('APP antibodies') recognize only a subgroup of senile plaques; 2) within these plaques, APP antibodies label discrete globular and granular structures morphologically resembling neurites; 3) virtually all of the plaques labeled by APP antibodies also contain neurites reactive with antibodies to tau; 4) double labeling with anti-tau and an APP antibody shows that the neuritelike profiles stained by the APP antibody are always closely associated with tau-positive neurites within the same plaque and that a minority of profiles appear to be labeled by both antibodies; and 5) antibodies to different regions throughout APP label the same profiles within plaques, suggesting the presence of the full-length precursor. The authors conclude that only a subgroup of senile plaques contain APP epitopes and that the immunostained structures are neurites. Because many A beta P-containing plaques in neocortex, cerebellum, and striatum were found to be devoid of any APP labeling, as were vascular A beta P deposits, it is unlikely that the extracellular A beta P is principally derived from the APP found within dystrophic neurites. The immunodetection of apparently full-length APP, an axonally transported protein, in selected plaque neurites provides yet another protein marker of neuritic dystrophy, possibly indicative of an aberrant regenerative response.\r"

Low molecular weight (LMW) heparin (mw about 5000 Dalton), which selectively inhibits the Xa factor with minimal risk of hemorrhage, seems to offer new possibilities in the prevention and treatment of both venous and acute arterial thromboembolism. Therefore, 44 patients with intermittent claudication were recruited to a randomized, double-blind, controlled study. Twenty-two were treated for six months with a single daily subcutaneous dose (15,000 UaXa) of LMW heparin and 22 with placebo administered in the same way over the same period of time. After six months, LMW heparin treatment not only improved walking capacity (by lengthening the pain-free walking time by 25%) but also significantly modified the hemorrheologic pattern (by reducing fibrinogen concentrations and whole blood viscosity at low shear rates). LMW heparin also exerted an antithrombotic and profibrinolytic effect by significantly increasing both the anti-Xa factor and plasminogen activity without markedly modifying activated partial thromboplastin time (+20%). No LMW heparin-treated patient hemorrhaged or reported other noteworthy side effects. These results suggest LMW heparin might be a useful drug in the long-term treatment of chronic arterial occlusive disease of the limbs.\r"

  ".U": "91127872\r", 
  ".W": "In recent trials, patients with myocardial infarction who received either recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) or streptokinase showed essentially no difference in the amount of myocardial salvage, in mortality reduction, or in the incidence of bleeding complications. These findings thus failed to fulfill the expectation that rt-PA would be twice as effective as streptokinase as a thrombolytic agent. The basis for this mistaken prediction was an unfortunate overemphasis on an inadequate surrogate endpoint, namely, the patency or reperfusion rate at 90 minutes after the start of therapy. Using the 90-minute patency or reperfusion rate as an endpoint has several serious limitations. First, it is an observation made at only one point in time during a dynamic process that may change even during the infusion proper. Second, a single view at 90 minutes completely disregards the possibility of subsequent reocclusion which often occurs within 1 hour after treatment. Third, an image at 90 minutes is more a reflection of the speed of thrombolysis than of whether lysis will eventually occur; the pace of clot lysis depends on both the agent used and the age of the thrombus. Fourth, lysis at 90 minutes is of minimal relevance for myocardial salvage unless observed within the time frame when infarction size can be limited significantly, which is generally less than 4 hours between symptom onset and the time that reperfusion is accomplished. Fifth, a stable state of vessel patency is meaningful for mortality reduction even if stabilization occurs after completion of the infarction. Such \"late,\" but lasting, patency is a critical component of the \"open vessel\" principle and explains, at least in part, the survival benefit that accrues to patients treated even 24 hours after the onset of symptoms. There is currently no evidence that rt-PA has a more beneficial effect on survival or function than does streptokinase or any other plasminogen activator used in treating acute myocardial infarction; nor is there any evidence that patients who receive rt-PA therapy show a decreased incidence of bleeding complications compared with those who receive streptokinase, despite the relative fibrinogen-sparing attribute of rt-PA. Given the poor predictive value of the 90-minute angiogram for ultimate clinical advantage of one agent over another, studies that are limited to this endpoint are of marginal use in evaluating treatment regimens used in mortality studies. The best evidence to date indicates that streptokinase and rt-PA are of equivalent value for survival after acute myocardial infarction, a conclusion that can be justifiably challenged only with a valid mortality study.\r"

Yet, largely because of the fear of complications, immediate enteral feeding is not commonly performed in patients with major burns until after the resuscitation period. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of immediate enteral tube feedings in patients with burns larger than 20% of their body surface area. The daily intake of enteral feedings begun immediately (less than 6 hours) after burn was measured during the first 7 days after burn in 106 consecutive patients with a mean +/- SD burn size of 40% +/- 21%. The incidence of complications related to enteral feeding was low; aspiration pneumonia did not occur. Vomiting was the major complication observed and occurred 21 times in 16 patients during the 745 study days (2.8% daily incidence). The mean number of calories absorbed enterally increased daily and met the patient's calculated resting energy expenditure (REE) on day 3 after burn (99% +/- 7% REE). The results of this study indicate that immediate enteral feeding is a safe and effective method of delivering nutritional support to burn victims with major burns.\r"

In our cohort there were 0.06 cases of typhoid or paratyphoid per patient year of observation; this rate is approximately 60 times that in the general population in Lima, and 25 times that in the 15- to 35-year-old age group.

Samples from patients with lupus anticoagulants were included in the 1986 and 1987 College of American Pathologists proficiency survey program. Participant performance on these samples demonstrated significant variation in the responsiveness of different activated partial thromboplastin reagents to lupus anticoagulants. The level of factor VIII in these samples reported by the participants also varied with the reagent used. Follow-up studies demonstrated striking reagent-dependent differences in the dilutional effect on apparent factor VIII, IX, XI, and XII activity. These results point out the importance of selecting sensitive and responsive reagents for appropriate identification of lupus inhibitors. In addition, the results indicate that the choice of reagent used for factor assays can affect the apparent factor activity as well as whether a dilutional effect is noted when a lupus anticoagulant is present in the test sample, an important consideration when trying to distinguish a lupus anticoagulant from a specific factor inhibitor.\r"

  ".U": "91128128\r", 
  ".W": "Nitric oxide, a highly reactive radical, was recently identified as an intermediate of L-arginine metabolism in mammalian cells. We have shown that nitric oxide synthesis is induced in vitro in cultured hepatocytes by supernatants from activated Kupffer cells or in vivo by injecting rats with nonviable Corynebacterium parvum. In both cases, nitric oxide biosynthesis in hepatocytes was associated with suppression of total protein synthesis. This study attempts to determine the effect of nitric oxide biosynthesis on the activity of specific hepatocytic mitochondrial enzymes and to determine whether inhibition of protein synthesis is caused by suppression of energy metabolism. Exposure of hepatocytes to supernatants from activated Kupffer cells led to a 30% decrease of aconitase (Krebs cycle) and complex I (mitochondrial electron transport chain) activity. Using NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis, we demonstrated that the inhibition of mitochondrial aconitase activity was due, in part, to the action of nitric oxide. In contrast, in vivo nitric oxide synthesis of hepatocytes from Corynebacterium parvum-treated animals had no effect on mitochondrial respiration. This suggests that inhibition of protein synthesis by nitric oxide is not likely to be mediated by inhibition of energy metabolism.\r"

This study examines the role of the macrophage in host defense in the malnourished state. Swiss-Webster mice (N = 300) were randomly allocated to control (24% casein) or low-protein (2.5% casein) diets for 8 weeks. We studied the ability of two populations of macrophages, peritoneal macrophages, and Kupffer cells to produce superoxide anion after in vivo administration of endotoxin or mycobacterium (bacille Calmette-Guerin). Phorbol diester and Candida albicans were used as stimuli. In another group of mice, we evaluated the ability of interferon gamma to up-regulate superoxide anion release and Candida phagocytosis and killing. Mice under protein-energy malnutrition demonstrated decreased mean body weights, serum protein levels, and cell yields. Superoxide anion production in resident and activated (lipopolysaccharide, interferon gamma, bacille Calmette-Guerin infection) peritoneal macrophages was significantly reduced in the malnourished group. Candida phagocytosis and killing were also both depressed in malnourished mice. Kupffer cells failed to generate superoxide anion in all groups. We conclude that severe protein-energy malnutrition significantly impairs macrophage function, which could diminish response to acute and chronic septic challenges. Interferon gamma up regulated peritoneal macrophage and Kupffer cell microbicidal function, which suggests a therapeutic role for this lymphokine in the malnourished septic host.\r"

  ".W": "Infusing pigs with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) decreases superior mesenteric artery blood flow (Qsma), suggesting that mesenteric hypoperfusion may be responsible for LPS-induced alterations in gut mucosal permeability. To test this hypothesis, we studied four groups of anesthetized swine. Group 1 animals (N = 6) were infused with LPS (250 micrograms/kg over 1 hour beginning at 60 minutes) and continuously resuscitated with Ringer's lactate (48 mL/kg per hour). In group 2 (N = 5), Qsma was decreased by 50% by means of a mechanical occluder to mimic the LPS-induced alterations in Qsma observed in group I. Group 3 (N = 5) was included to document our ability to detect ischemia/reperfusion-induced alterations in mucosal permeability; in these pigs, Qsma was decreased in steps to zero flow (at 150 to 210 minutes) and then perfusion was restored (at 210 to 270 minutes). Pigs in group 4 (N = 6) served as normal controls; these animals were resuscitated with Ringer's lactate at the same rate as in group 1 but were not infused with LPS. To assess mucosal permeability, we measured plasma-to-lumen clearances for two markers, chromium 51-labeled edetic acid monohydrate (EDTA) and urea. Loading and maintenance infusions of the markers were given intravenously, and a 20-cm isolated segment of small intestine was continuously perfused at 2 mL/min with Ringer's lactate at 37 degrees C. Results were expressed as the ratio of the clearances for the two probes (CEDTA/CUREA). In group 3, CEDTA/CUREA was 999% +/- 355% of baseline at 270 minutes. In group 1, CEDTA/CUREA was 572% +/- 235% of baseline at 270 minutes. In groups 2 and 4, however, CEDTA/CUREA did not change significantly from the baseline value over the duration of the study. These data suggest that increased mucosal permeability after LPS is due to factors other than (or in addition to) mesenteric hypoperfusion.\r"

Low-toxicity lipopolysaccharide preparations induced levels of tumor necrosis factor similar to those induced with more toxic types of lipopolysaccharide. Late tolerance was associated with progressively lower levels of lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor and increasing titers of antilipopolysaccharide antibodies after repeated injections of homologous lipopolysaccharide. During late endotonxin tolerance, a direct correlation between the lipopolysaccharide dose and peak tumor necrosis factor serum levels was found. We conclude that since tumor necrosis factor serum levels do not correlate with mortality, tumor necrosis factor alone cannot explain the lethal effect of lipopolysaccharide.\r"

Each bacterial species colonized the cecum in similarly high numbers. Bacteria were recovered from the mesenteric lymph node of every mouse in inconsistent numbers, eg, greater numbers of P mirabilis and E coli were recovered from T-cell-deficient nude mice than from their normal littermates, but the opposite was observed with E faecalis. Comparing the three bacterial species resulted in relatively consistent observations, eg, the incidence of E faecalis translocation to the liver was greater than that of E coli or P mirabilis translocation. Thus, the identity of the translocating microbe significantly affected the recovery of viable translocating bacteria.\r"

Invasive preoperative monitoring was not used. Our results, with respect to the control of seizures and behavioral improvement, are comparable with series in which data from invasive recordings were used in the selection process. Sixty-three percent of the 35 patients (76.5% of those operated on after the introduction of long-term electroencephalographic monitoring) became either seizure free or experienced a reduction in their frequency of seizures by at least 75%. The favorable outcome in this group of patients strengthens the argument for early operation in children with intractable epilepsy, even when the seizure focus is outside the temporal lobe.\r"

Tissue plasminogen activator (1800 IU/0.1 mL) was injected into the anterior chamber 24 hours after creation of the hyphema. Two control groups (one receiving balanced salt solution and one receiving no treatment) were used for comparison. A multivariate analysis of covariance indicated that the greatest difference in hyphema clearance between the groups occurred at days 3, 4, and 5. Five days after tissue plasminogen activator treatment, the mean size of the clot remaining in the anterior chamber was 27% of that of the original hyphema. In control eyes, almost 60% of the original clot remained at day 5. Treatment of animals with tissue plasminogen activator doses of 5000 IU and 10,000 IU produced a substantial increase in repeated bleeding episodes in our rabbit model. We concluded that although the use of tissue plasminogen activator in our rabbit model of traumatic hyphema significantly improved clearance of blood from the anterior chamber, the remaining clot was of such size that the clinical benefit was questionable.\r"

We found a measurable increase in retinal adhesion as early as 10 minutes and as late as 4 hours after mannitol injection. We suspect that mannitol dehydrates the subretinal space and thereby enhances the adhesive properties of the interphotoreceptor matrix or tightens the interdigitation between photoreceptors and pigment epithelial cells. Our data suggest that mannitol could have clinical application in the management of retinal detachments.\r"

It has been identified and characterized using monoclonal antibodies on Western blots and by amino-terminal sequence analysis. The presence of p24 in the soluble fraction of infected cells following lysis by detergent or sonication, combined with a high level of expression (in excess of 50 mg/l of culture) facilitates the enrichment of large quantities of recombinant HIV antigen in a simple two-step procedure involving ammonium sulphate fractionation and gel filtration. p24 antigen purified in this way is shown to be an efficient diagnostic reagent.\r"

Recordings were made on 378 of the 436 patients admitted to a double blind trial of alteplase or placebo in one participating centre of the Anglo-Scandinavian study of early thrombosis (ASSET), patients being selected according to the availability of recorders. Of these, 309 (158 given alteplase and 151 placebo) had greater than 5 hours of analysable data. Most of the arrhythmias were recorded in patients with an in hospital diagnosis of myocardial infarction. Ventricular couplets and ventricular tachycardia were significantly more common in the patients treated with alteplase. Further, in patients with myocardial infarction who had ventricular extrasystoles, couplets, or ventricular tachycardia type a, the number of hours in which each arrhythmia was recorded was significantly higher in the alteplase group. The various ventricular arrhythmias in the alteplase group tended to cluster in the first 4-12 hours of the recordings. During the first 24 hours admission there were four episodes of ventricular fibrillation in the alteplase group and five in the placebo group of taped patients. By one month there had been 18 deaths in these 309 patients (alteplase four, placebo 14). These bore no relation to any recorded arrhythmia. Clinical records for the patients with no or minimal tape data yielded six further episodes of ventricular fibrillation during the first 24 hours (three in the alteplase group and three in the placebo group).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Implantation of subcutaneous indomethacin pellets prior to carcinogen treatment prevented the changes in LC numbers and morphology in BP, but not DMBA-treated skin. Indomethacin treatment was also found to reduce elevated prostaglandin E2 (PGE)2 levels in the skin of BP-treated mice, whereas PGE2 levels were not significantly raised in DMBA-treated mice. There thus appears to be a link between altered prostaglandin levels and LC numbers in murine skin treated with BP, but not DMBA. In the latter, LC numbers were reduced by mechanisms not reversed by indomethacin. It is concluded that increased prostaglandin levels may contribute to the impairment of cutaneous immunity previously observed in BP-treated mice by altering LC density and morphology within the epidermis.\r"

Additional treatment with radiotherapy and laser therapy was given and, in some cases, isolated skin nodules were excised. Within 7 months of initiation of therapy one patient had a complete remission of his tumours, however, tumour progression recurred after the patient discontinued treatment. In another patient the tumour cleared within 9 months of rIFN therapy, and after 52 months he is still free of KS. The condition of a third patient tended to become stabilized during the first 6 months of therapy, but after 60 months there has been a slow progression. The fourth and fifth patients died 25 and 28 months, respectively, after the histological diagnosis of KS and the initiation of treatment. While on therapy with rIFN-alpha-2a, no life-threatening opportunistic infections occurred. The side-effects were mostly well tolerated, and no severe changes in haematological parameters were caused by the therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been shown to be associated with posttransplant lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, and T-cell lymphoma, in addition to African Burkitt's lymphoma. In a retrospective study of 56 consecutive cases of T-cell lymphoma, EBV DNA was found by Southern blot and in situ DNA hybridization in 10 (20%) of 50 peripheral T-cell lymphomas, but in none of six cases of T-lymphoblastic lymphoma. Peripheral T-cell lymphomas containing EBV DNA could be subclassified into three categories according to histology and immunophenotypic studies: (1) T-cell lymphoma of the helper phenotype, five cases. Two cases had histologic features resembling angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy (AILD). (2) T-cell lymphoma of the cytotoxic/suppressor phenotype, four cases. AILD-like features could also be recognized in two cases. Reed-Sternberg-like giant cells were identified in three cases designated Hodgkin-like T-cell lymphoma. (3) Angiocentric T-cell lymphoma or lymphomatoid granulomatosis in one case, initially affecting the skin and nose; no T-cell subset could be defined. Six of the eight EBV DNA-positive patients tested for serum EBV antibodies had elevated titers of IgG antiviral capsid antigen (greater than 640) and/or early antigen (greater than 10). From combined studies of Southern blot hybridization by using EBV termini fragment probe and in situ DNA hybridization, the EBV genomes appeared to be clonotypically proliferated in the neoplastic T cells. The patients in all three groups usually had prolonged fever preceding the diagnosis, hepatosplenomegaly, an aggressive clinical course, and poor response to chemotherapy; nine died with a median survival of only 8 months. We propose that these EBV-associated aggressive T-cell lymphomas, like human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus-positive T-cell lymphoma, have characteristic clinicopathologic features and should be treated as a separate disease entity.\r"

This activity was characterized to be urokinase-PA (u-PA) by incubation with specific IgG and by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis zymography. Increased u-PA activity reflected GM-CSF-induction of u-PA mRNA levels. The stimulatory properties of GM-CSF for monocyte PA activity differed from those of interleukin-4, which induced monocyte tissue-type PA (t-PA) activity, and of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), which alone was not stimulatory but augmented lipopolysaccharide-induced t-PA activity. GM-CSF alone did not stimulate detectable monocyte t-PA activity but combined with IFN-gamma to promote this activity. Plasmin formation arising from GM-CSF-induced u-PA in monocytes may contribute to the matrix turnover involved in, eg, cell migration and inflammation, and may explain some of the pathology seen in GM-CSF transgenic mice.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To estimate the cost of treating babies with severe respiratory distress syndrome with natural porcine surfactant. DESIGN--Retrospective controlled survey. SETTING--Regional neonatal intensive care unit, Belfast. PATIENTS--33 Preterm babies with severe respiratory distress syndrome who were enrolled in a European multicentre trial during 1985-7. 19 Babies were treated with surfactant and 14 served as controls. INTERVENTIONS--Treatment with natural porcine surfactant. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Cost associated with surfactant replacement treatment per extra survivor in the treatment group and cost per quality adjusted life year for each extra survivor. RESULTS--Fifteen (79%) of the 19 treated babies and five (36%) of the 14 control babies survived. On average, the control babies required 20 days in hospital compared with 61 days for the treated babies (or 95 [corrected] days per extra survivor in the treatment group). The cost per extra survivor in the treatment group was pounds 13,720, with the cost per quality adjusted life year estimated at pounds 710. CONCLUSION--These costs compare favourably with those of established forms of treatment in adults. Thus surfactant replacement treatment for severe respiratory distress syndrome is fairly inexpensive and cost effective.\r"

  ".W": "Heterotopic bone can be induced in experimental animals by trauma to the soft tissues, by induction from living cells, or by extracts from bone and teeth. In the first two types, the mechanism of the inductive process is not known, whereas in the latter, a factor isolated from bone matrix induces bone formation. Mesenchymal cells in bone marrow are determined for development into cartilage and bone cells and only an unspecific stimulus, such as trauma or autotransplantation, is sufficient for the development into mature osteogenic tissue. Mesenchymal cells will not differentiate into bone cells unless stimulated by a specific inductive substance, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP). Implanted to a heterotopic site, BMP induces undifferentiated mesenchymal cells into a bone morphogenetic pathway of development, causing heterotopic bone formation. The quantitative inductive response is dependent on the source of the BMP, and the bone formation is also determined by the recruitment of inducible target cells and by the environment at the implantation site. Hence, the environment at the implantation site is of major importance for the amount of bone formed. BMP initiates a cascade of events that is modulated by endocrine and paracrine factors. The heterotopic bone has all the morphologic and biochemical characteristics of orthotopic bone, is subjected to turnover, and even has the intriguing ability to generate the formation of bone marrow. Experimental induction of heterotopic bone has become a most useful method to study osteoneogenesis and has supplied important information on the prerequisites for new bone formation and on the regulation of bone metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "Biopsy specimens of mature trabecular bone from tumors of two typical cases of pseudomalignant heterotopic ossification (PHO; myositis ossificans circumscripta) were transplanted into athymic nude mice. Specimens of normal metaphyseal bone in adjacent areas were also transplanted in the contralateral hindquarter muscles for controls. By seven days, control bone transplants were necrotic and enveloped in granulation tissues whereas PHO transplants were surrounded by proliferating connective tissue derived from the host-bed muscle tissues. In the intervals from 14 and 21 days, the PHO transplants showed vascular and hypertrophied connective-tissue proliferation with appositional deposits of new bone. The microscopic features of the new bone suggested that it was of mouse host-bed origin because the new bone from Case 1, a female, showed nuclei without sex chromatin. The quantities of new bone were measured by correlated histomorphometric and computer image analysis of microradiographs. Little or no cartilage development was noted at any stage. The normal control trabecular bone tissue was slowly resorbed by macrophages and mononuclear phagocytes; multinucleated giant cells were few and relatively small. Except in one questionably small area of one transplant, nontumorous undemineralized normal human bone failed to induce bone formation within the 28-day period of observation. The quantity of new bone formed in athymic mice in response to implants of PHO, estimated from equivalent quantities of bone developed from implants of lyophilized matrix-free bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) was about 1 microgram/g of wet PHO tumor weight. Although circumstantial evidence implicates BMP in the pathogenesis of heterotopic ossification, more research should be directed toward regional and systemic factors inhibiting bone development in normal and abnormal conditions, including malignant bone tumors.\r"

The most common sign and symptom are decreased range of motion and pain. The locations are the proximal limbs and joints. Sites of HO about a joint may vary according to the etiology of the HO. Roentgenographic evolution of HO occurs during a six-month period in the majority of patients. Treatment modalities include diphosphonates, indomethacin, radiation, range of motion exercises, and surgical excision. Surgical timing differs according to etiology: traumatic HO may be resected at six months; spinal cord injury HO is excised at one year; and traumatic brain injury HO is removed at 1.5 years. A small number of patients have progression of HO with medicinal treatment and recurrence after resection. The patients seem recalcitrant to present treatment methods regardless of the HO etiology.\r"

A scoring system was used to rate the following symptoms: spontaneous pain, mobilization pain, wearing pain, articular disability, flaccidity, muscular spasm, edema, and hematoma. Each symptom was categorized as none (0), mild (1), moderate (3), or severe (4). Patients were evaluated at the beginning of the study and on the fourth and eighth days of treatment. At the end of the trial, the decrease in each symptom score was significantly greater in patients receiving SS than in patients receiving a placebo. Analgesic intake during the study was also noticeably lower in the SS group. The incidence of drug-induced side effects (mainly abdominal discomfort) was minimal. Oral SS ameliorates the inflammatory symptoms associated with ankle sprains and therefore may be used as an alternative to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.\r"

The reported occurrences concerning this complication vary considerably in different reports, ranging from 15% to 90% with significant amounts in 1%-27% of the cases. Heterotopic ossification (HO) starts with the surgical operation, and the extent is well delineated on roentgenograms after six to 12 weeks. The amount of bone varies from small islands in the soft tissue to widespread bridging ossification. The cause of HO seems to be mainly related to systemic factors and is chiefly dependent on gender, diagnosis, and concurrent antiinflammatory medication. Patients at risk seem to be those with HO after a previous surgical operation, patients suffering from certain types of ankylosing spondylitis, otherwise healthy men with osteoarthrosis, patients with hypertrophic osteoarthrosis, and patients operated upon for fresh fractures or other posttraumatic conditions. The surgical technique and the local tissue trauma probably moderate both the occurrence and amount of HO. HO does not seem to cause pain or to decrease hip muscle strength but does limit hip mobility in cases with significant amount of ossification.\r"

Three approaches are used for HO resection at the elbow: (1) a posterolateral approach for posterolateral HO; (2) an anterolateral approach for anterior HO; and (3) a medical approach for medial or posteromedial HO or anterior transfer of the ulnar nerve. Two approaches are recommended for resection of HO at the hip: (1) an anterior approach for anterior or inferomedial HO and (2) a posterior approach for posterior HO. Posterior HO is often associated with a hip-flexion contracture, and an anterior soft-tissue release may be necessary as well. Physical examination indicates the prognosis for functional improvement as well as recurrence. Patients with a near normal neurologic recovery have minimal to no HO recurrence with improved limb function and increased joint motion, whereas a poor neurologic recovery and persistent spasticity are associated with recurrence of HO and no functional limb improvement. Standard roentgenograms aid in selecting the appropriate surgical approach. Radiation, indomethacin, and diphosphonates have been administered for prophylaxis. Physical therapy is necessary until range of motion stabilizes.\r"

Long-term follow-up study was available for 18 patients who had 38 surgical procedures. This was a descriptive study since preoperative, surgical, and postoperative care varied slightly over time and were dependent on newer advances in surgical techniques and therapeutic agents. Primary complications included excessive bleeding, infection, fractures, and recurrence of the heterotopic ossification. Procedures are outlined that may reduce the incidence of postoperative infection. Fractures are related to the degree of regional osteoporosis. Recurrence is still a common problem, and any or all therapeutic agents that may reduce the extent of postoperative recurrence should be considered before surgical excision is planned.\r"

Prophylaxis with indomethacin should be given in 25-mg doses three times daily for at least three weeks, starting on the first postoperative morning. However, a shorter treatment period may be equally effective in preventing the severest degrees of HO, and a postoperative delay of five days before the initiation of prophylaxis does not seem to be followed by the development of severe HO. As evaluated one year after surgery, treatment with antiinflammatory medications in the immediate postoperative weeks did not increase the incidence of implant-bone interface radiolucencies, aseptic loosening, or revisions in cemented or cementless THAs when compared with cases that did not have postoperative treatment. However, although no major complications have been reported regarding the use of antiinflammatory medications in the prevention of HO after THA, orthopedic surgeons prescribing such treatment should be aware of their contraindications as well as early and late side effects. Since several antiinflammatory agents are reported to be effective in preventing HO, future reports dealing with HO after THA should always include information about the postoperative antiinflammatory treatment used.\r"

Patients at risk for this complication include those with preexisting ipsilateral or contralateral HO, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, hypertrophic osteoarthrosis, posttraumatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. Low-dose radiation therapy effectively prevents HO in this high-risk group when treatment is begun early in the postoperative period. A prospective evaluation has established the efficacy of fractionated and single-dose radiation therapy protocols. Limited radiation portals are used in patients receiving cementless prostheses. A rectangular radiation portal obliquely oriented to the prosthesis enables radiation treatment of the periarticular soft tissues while avoiding exposure of the bone-prosthesis interface. Radiation therapy to this interface may inhibit or delay bony ingrowth. Radiation therapy is the only treatment used to prevent HO that is delivered locally and not systemically. Low-dose radiation therapy using a limited radiation portal is the treatment of choice to prevent HO in high-risk patients after cementless THA.\r"

The factors to be considered in its development are the percentage of burn, the location of burn, the length of bed confinement, osteoporosis, superimposed trauma, and genetic predisposition. Characteristically, heterotopic bone develops between one and three months after the acute burn. It may continue to proliferate as long as there are open wounds but it tends to regress once the burn wound has healed. If it has bridged a joint it may be surgically excised after the burn has healed. The more extensive the heterotopic bone the poorer the prognosis for restoration of motion after excision. Prevention of heterotopic bone appears to be linked in part to early mobilization of the patient and recovery from the postburn hypermetabolic and catabolic state.\r"

The frequency of adverse skin reactions is controversial and may vary from 10% to 75%, according to various authors. 33 patients using transdermal nitroglycerin for more than 7 days were examined and patch tested (nitroglycerin 0.5% aq., 2% pet. and TTS in toto). 5 patients (15%) had adverse reactions. The patch tests were all negative in the 33 patients. Contact dermatitis occurs in many cases, about 15% of the cases with the newly available TTS, and even if patients respect the conditions for using TTS. These contact dermatitides are mainly irritant reactions and do not require transdermal nitroglycerin treatment to be stopped. Nevertheless, since some cases of allergic contact dermatitis have been reported, a contact dermatitis from transdermal nitroglycerin should lead to patch testing.\r"

All of the operations were performed by one surgeon who used the same operative approach. Preoperative, immediate postoperative, and six-month follow-up radiographs were reviewed for all patients. For 90 per cent of the hips, radiographs that were made after a minimum follow-up of one year were also reviewed. In the group of patients who had an uncemented femoral component, there was a statistically significant increase in the frequency of heterotopic bone and in its severity. Either none or only class-I ectopic bone developed in 74 per cent of the hips in the hybrid group, compared with 40 per cent of the hips in the uncemented group (p less than 0.005). In contrast, class-III or IV heterotopic ossification was evident in 13 per cent of the hips in the uncemented group (p less than 0.005). None of the patients in the hybrid group needed reoperation for excision of ectopic bone, but four (6 per cent) of the patients in the uncemented group needed such a reoperation because of severe limitation of motion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Uncemented, porous-surfaced implants were used in all other patients. The over-all clinical results were similar for the three groups. For the fifty-two hips that had a cemented prosthesis, the mean total Harris hip rating was 91 points and the score for pain, 42 points; for the twenty-seven hips that had a hybrid prosthesis, 90 and 43 points; and for the sixty-five hips that had an implant allowing ingrowth of bone in both the acetabulum and the femur, 95 and 43 points. Two prosthetic stems that were designed to allow ingrowth of bone had aseptic loosening; one was revised. Pain in the thigh, usually slight and not disabling, occurred at one year in 24 per cent of the patients in whom a femoral component allowing ingrowth had been used; the prevalence of pain then declined. The incidences of migration of the components and of radiolucent lines were greater in the acetabula that had a cemented component than in those that had a cup allowing ingrowth of bone.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to investigate whether heart rate variability could be reliably assessed in patients with ventricular arrhythmias and to evaluate whether it is affected by antiarrhythmic drugs. The study was based on an analysis of 239 ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings obtained from 67 patients with frequent and complex ventricular arrhythmias enrolled in the Antiarrhythmic Drug Evaluation Group (ADEG) study. In each recording, after exclusion of premature ventricular complexes, the number of times during a 24 h period in which two consecutive sinus RR intervals differed by more than 50 ms was calculated. The total 24 h count from each recording was then used as an index of heart rate variability. This method is a reliable marker of cardiac parasympathetic activity. Recordings were analyzed at baseline (n = 56), during long-term treatment with amiodarone (n = 17), flecainide (n = 22) or propafenone (n = 17) and after washout in selected patients (n = 5). Despite the presence of a different number of arrhythmias, total 24 h counts in the same patient appeared reproducible over time (r = 0.83 between two different recordings, n = 49, p less than 0.0001). Baseline counts (median 1,698, range 26 to 13,648) were not correlated (r = 0.15) with the number of arrhythmias. The three antiarrhythmic drugs had a disparate effect on total 24 h counts: no change was observed in patients treated with amiodarone (median percent change [delta %]-8, p = NS), whereas a significant (p less than 0.025) decrease occurred in patients treated with flecainide (median delta % -56%) or propafenone (median delta % -64%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effect of nitroglycerin on the thrombolytic effects of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was examined in dogs with an electrically induced occlusive coronary artery thrombus. Eleven dogs were randomly given rt-PA alone and seven rt-PA with nitroglycerin. The dose of rt-PA was 0.75 mg/kg body weight given over 20 min and the dose of nitroglycerin was 125 micrograms/min for 40 min. The reperfusion rate in the dogs given rt-PA alone was 73% (8 of 11 dogs) and that in the rt-PA plus nitroglycerin group was 57% (four of seven dogs) (p = NS). The time to thrombolysis (or reperfusion) in dogs receiving rt-PA plus nitroglycerin was 70% greater than in those receiving rt-PA alone (means +/- SD/29.8 +/- 9.9 versus 17.6 +/- 5.9 min, p less than 0.02), and the duration of reperfusion much shorter (11 +/- 17 versus 42 +/- 16 min, p less than 0.02).

The purpose of this study was to determine if the reduced Na+,K+ ATPase activity was due to an enzyme inhibitor. Na+,K+ ATPase activity of a particulate fraction of sonicated platelets was determined by spectrophotometry in asymptomatic adults with and without allergy. The Na+,K+ ATPase level (mean, nanomoles per microgram of protein per minute; +/- STD) of allergic subjects (0.9 +/- 1.3) was lower (p less than 0.001) than that of nonallergic subjects (3.9 +/- 1.6). In contrast, when the same platelet fractions were frozen before assay, Na+,K+ ATPase was higher (p less than 0.005) in allergic subjects (6.0 +/- 1.4) than in nonallergic subjects (3.6 +/- 2.0). An inhibitor of canine kidney Na+,K+ ATPase was detected in the buffer in which these platelet fractions were frozen, allergic subjects (0.5% +/- 0.4% inhibition per microgram of protein) compared to nonallergic subjects (0.04% +/- 0.08%; p less than 0.005). The level of inhibition correlated positively with the postfreezing increase in platelet membrane Na+,K+ ATPase, suggesting a freezing-induced displacement of an inhibitor from the membrane. Plasma from these same subjects inhibited Na+,K+ ATPase activity of normal platelets, allergic subjects (70% +/- 31% inhibition) compared to nonallergic subjects (13% +/- 16%; p less than 0.001). These data suggest that the transport-enzyme defect observed in platelets from allergic subjects was due to a circulating Na+,K+ ATPase inhibitor. In vivo Na+,K+ ATPase inhibition in allergy could have profound effects on intracellular cation concentrations and broad implications for pathogenesis.\r"

Histamine dosage was increased every 5 minutes by 0.1 to 0.2 microgram/kg/min until mean BP fell greater than 15 mm Hg or a dosage of 1.6 micrograms/kg/min was reached. Plasma catecholamine samples were taken between the fourth and fifth minute of each histamine dosage. Identical measurements were made during nitroglycerin-induced hypotension in these subjects. Histamine produced threefold greater increases in heart rate and plasma norepinephrine (NE) levels than did nitroglycerin for comparable decreases in BP. Although NE levels increased twofold to fivefold from baseline with histamine infusion, epinephrine levels increased minimally at the highest doses or not at all. Our data demonstrate that histamine selectively releases NE from adrenergic nerve terminals without significant adrenal catecholamine release. We suggest that neural NE release plays an important role in the cardiac effects of histamine.\r"

  ".W": "The maturation potential of CD4-8- thymocytes purified from mice of different developmental ages was examined in vivo after intrathymic injection. As previously reported, 14-day fetal CD4-8- thymocytes produced fewer CD4+ than CD8+ progeny in peripheral lymphoid tissues, resulting in a CD4+:CD8+ ratio of less than or equal to 1.0. In contrast, adult CD4-8- thymocytes generated CD4+ or CD8+ peripheral progeny in the proportions found in the normal adult animal (CD4+:CD8+ = 2 to 3). Here we have shown that CD4-8- precursor cells from the 17-day fetal thymus also produced peripheral lymphocytes with low CD4+:CD8+ ratios. Precursors from full term fetuses produced slightly higher CD4+:CD8+ ratios (1.1-1.6) and precursors from animals three to 4 days post-birth achieved CD4+:CD8+ ratios intermediate between those produced by fetal and adult CD4-8- thymocytes. Parallel changes in the production of alpha beta TCR+ peripheral progeny were observed. Fetal CD4-8- thymocytes generated fewer alpha beta TCR+ progeny than did adult CD4-8- thymocytes. However, peripheral lymphocytes arising from either fetal or adult thymic precursors showed similar proportions of gamma delta TCR+ cells. The same pattern of progeny was observed when fetal CD4-8- thymocytes matured in an adult or in a fetal thymic stromal environment. In contrast to fetal thymic precursors, fetal liver T cell precursors resembled adult CD4-8- thymocytes by all parameters measured. These results suggest that fetal thymic precursors are intrinsically different from both adult CD4-8- thymocytes and fetal liver T cell precursors. Moreover, they lead to the hypothesis that the composition of the peripheral T cell compartment is developmentally regulated by the types of precursors found in the thymus. A model is proposed in which migration of adult-like precursors from the fetal liver to the thymus approximately at birth triggers a transition from the fetal to the adult stages of intrathymic T cell differentiation.\r"

  ".U": "91132000\r", 
  ".W": "In cyclophosphamide (CP)-induced tolerance, a long lasting skin allograft tolerance was established in many H-2-identical strain combinations without graft vs host disease. Destruction of donor-reactive T cells of host origin, followed by intrathymic clonal deletion of these cells, has been revealed to be the chief mechanisms of this system. Here, we studied the fate of host-reactive populations in donor-derived T cells of C3H/He (C3H) (H-2k, Mls-1b, Mls-2a) mice rendered CP-induced tolerant to AKR/J (AKR) (H-2k, Mls-1a, Mls-2b), by assessing AKR-derived Thy-1.1+ T cells bearing TCR V beta 3 that are specifically reactive with Mls-2a-encoded Ag of the recipient C3H mice. In the AKR-derived Thy-1.1+ lymph node cells of the C3H mice that had been treated with AKR spleen cells plus CP, CD4(+)-V beta 3+ T cells were obviously decreased by day 10 after the CP treatment. At this stage, the Thy-1.1+ T cells were not detected in the C3H thymus, suggesting that the obvious decrease of CD4(+)-V beta 3+ T cells of AKR origin was not due to intrathymic clonal deletion in the recipient C3H mice. Therefore, the destruction of the host-reactive mature T cells of donor origin, as well as that of the donor-reactive mature T cells of host origin, occurred by the CP treatment at the induction phase. Furthermore, after the establishment of intrathymic mixed chimerism in the recipient C3H mice, V beta 3+ T cells were not detected among the Thy-1.1+ T cells of AKR origin in the mixed chimeric thymus, suggesting that the host-reactive immature T cells repopulated from the injected donor hematopoietic cells were clonally deleted in the recipient thymus. These two mechanisms appear to prevent graft vs host disease in CP-induced tolerance.\r"

  ".U": "91132004\r", 
  ".W": "The positive and negative selection of immature thymocytes that shapes the mature T cell repertoire appears to occur at an intermediate stage of development when the cells express low levels of TCR/CD3. These cells are also CD4+CD8+ and CD28+ (dull), and signals delivered by these three accessory molecules have been implicated in the selection process. We have examined the regulatory function of these accessory molecules on responses of immature thymocytes stimulated through the TCR/CD3 complex. Cross-linking CD4 or CD8 with CD3 strongly enhanced signal transduction via CD3 as assessed by protein tyrosine phosphorylation and calcium mobilization. Subsequent cell proliferation could be induced by soluble anti-CD28 mAb, which was comitogenic for cells stimulated with CD3 x CD4 or CD3 x CD8 cross-linking, but was without effect on cells stimulated with CD3 x CD3 cross-linking. A potential role for CD28 signal transduction in thymic maturation is suggested by the demonstration that the BB-1 molecule, a natural ligand for CD28, is expressed on thymic stromal cells. Taken together, our data suggest a model of thymic development in which CD4 or CD8 may enhance TCR/CD3 signaling upon coligation by an MHC molecule. If the CD28 surface receptor is simultaneously stimulated by a BB-1 expressing stromal cell, this set of interactions could lead to proliferation and positive selection. In the absence of CD28 stimulation the enhanced TCR/CD3 signals might lead to apoptosis and negative selection.\r"

  ".W": "The immunoregulatory mechanisms that determine the high serum IgE antibody levels in disorders such as helminth parasite infections and the hyper-IgE recurrent infection syndrome (HIE) remain poorly understood. To assess whether elevated serum IgE levels result from an increased number of B lymphocytes committed to IgE production, the proportion of IgE-producing B lymphocytes was determined by a filter immunoplaque assay using PBMC from persons with a broad range of serum IgE levels that included normal persons (n = 9) and patients with loiasis (n = 12), tropical pulmonary eosinophilia (TPE) (n = 6), lymphatic filariasis (n = 28), and HIE (n = 8). PBMC from these persons were assessed for production of in vitro IgE. The geometric mean number of IgE-secreting cells in 10(5) B lymphocytes in PBMC was 0.42 (range 0-2.2) in normal persons, 5.6 (range 0.1-35.5) among patients with loiasis, 9.4 (range 0-53.2) among patients with lymphatic filariasis, 52 (range 31.5-115) among patients with TPE, and 218 (range 56-1404) among patients with HIE. When all study subjects were grouped, there were significant correlations with serum IgE levels (r2 = 0.78; p less than 0.0001) and net spontaneous in vitro IgE production (r2 = 0.8; p less than 0.0001). Estimates of the amount of IgE production per B lymphocyte were similar among normal persons, patients with filarial infections, and patients with TPE (geometric means of 134, 96, and 141 pg/ml/cell, respectively); in contrast, for HIE patients, IgE production by individual B cells was significantly lower (geometric mean 28 pg/ml/cell; p less than 0.001). These observations demonstrate that clonal expansion of IgE-producing B lymphocytes is a major mechanism underlying the elevated serum IgE levels seen in persons with hyper-IgE states.\r"

  ".W": "The pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) is believed to involve an autoimmune component directed against the myelin sheath. One potential target Ag for such autoimmune attack is the myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) because an anti-MOG mAb has profound influence on the course of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, which to some extent represents an experimental model of MS. Using single cell assays, we have evaluated T and B cell reactivities to MOG in MS patients and controls. T cell reactivity was estimated by counting the number of cells that secreted IFN-gamma in response to MOG, whereas B cell reactivity was estimated by enumerating cells secreting antibodies that bound to MOG. MOG reactive T cells were detected in the peripheral blood of the majority of the 16 MS patients examined (mean 1/7299 mononuclear cells), but infrequently and at lower numbers in samples from neurologic controls. MOG-reactive T cells were more frequent among MS patients' cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) mononuclear cells (mean 1/450 cells). The T cell response to MOG was evidently MHC class II restricted, because Fab fragments of a rabbit polyclonal anti HLA-DR antibodies abrogated the Ag-induced increase in number of cells that secreted IFN-gamma, as analyzed on CSF and PBMC from three patients with MS. Anti-MOG IgG antibody-secreting cells were detected in blood in 8 of 16 MS patients (mean 1/25,641 cells), but they were also strongly accumulated in CSF, being detected in 8 of 10 MS patients examined (mean 1/265 cells), while rarely found in controls. The findings imply that MOG may represent a pathogenetically important target Ag in MS.\r"

  ".W": "Although the secretion of Ig isotypes other than IgM is generally accompanied by a DNA rearrangement that deletes C mu (and the other IgCH genes located between VDJ and the expressed CH gene), a system has recently been described that generates a high frequency of IgE-secreting cells that have failed to delete IgCH genes or to rearrange their C epsilon genes. These cells, derived from EBV-transformed human PBMC, secrete IgM and IgD as well as IgE. To determine whether the absence of C epsilon rearrangement and CH gene deletion is a general phenomenon for human IgE-secreting cells, we have characterized IgE-secreting cells that are generated by culturing purified human B cells with EBV plus IL-4 in the presence of irradiated human PBMC. In contrast to the earlier observation, we have not been able to detect any cells that demonstrate cytoplasmic staining for IgE and concurrently stain for a second Ig isotype. Stable IgE-secreting cell lines and clones produced by this method have rearranged one of their C epsilon genes and have deleted both C mu genes. These observations demonstrate that the generation of human IgE-secreting cells can involve the same gene rearrangement and deletional mechanisms that lead to the generation of cells that secrete other isotypes.\r"

  ".U": "91132030\r", 
  ".W": "Growth hormone (GH) and the GH-dependent growth promoting peptide, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), are both potent signals for priming human and porcine polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) to secrete superoxide anion (O2-). PMA, opsonized-zymosan, or FMLP could all be used as triggering stimuli to demonstrate priming by GH or IGF-I. As positive controls, IFN-gamma and LPS also primed both human and porcine PMN for enhanced O2- release. However, only the LPS-mediated enhancement was inhibited by polymyxin B, which demonstrates that the priming induced by GH, IGF-I, or IFN-gamma was not caused by LPS contamination. Furthermore, a specific antibody to GH abrogated priming induced by this molecule. In contrast to IGF-I, the closely related molecule insulin was unable to prime PMN even at pharmacologic levels. Insulin, at pharmacologic levels, antagonized the priming mediated by IGF-I but had no effect on GH priming. A mAb directed against the human IGF-I receptor blocked the enhanced secretion of O2- by human PMN that was caused by IGF-I, but not GH, indicating that neutrophil priming induced by GH was not mediated by inducing extracellular release of IGF-I. However, priming PMN by both GH and IGF-I required de novo protein synthesis, because cycloheximide completely abrogated enhanced O2- secretion that was caused by these growth factors. These data show that a classic pituitary hormone (GH), as well as its widely recognized growth promoting peptide (IGF-I), are involved in regulating an important functional activity of both porcine and human PMN. Inasmuch as GH and IGF-I have recently been demonstrated to be synthesized by leukocytes, these data support the possibility that both of these proteins could act in a paracrine fashion as cytokines to prime PMN for an enhanced respiratory burst.\r"

  ".U": "91132031\r", 
  ".W": "RBL 2H3 cells (a model of mast cell function) were sensitized with anti-TNP IgE (0.5 micrograms/ml) and triggered to secrete both histamine and arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites by the addition of TNP-OVA (0 to 100 ng/ml). After a 3-min delay, the release of both groups of mediators proceeded in a parallel manner. In cells labeled with [14C]-AA, TNP-OVA produced a rapid increase in phosphatidic acid (PA), and subsequently, 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) and intracellular AA levels. Concurrently, there was a decrease in [14C]-AA labeled phosphatidylcholine. The release of labeled AA from phosphatidylcholine in response to TNP-OVA was paralleled by a liberation of free choline but no evidence of liberation of phosphorylcholine. When ethanol (0.05 to 2% v/v) was included in the culture medium, phosphatidylethanol was synthesized at the expense of PA and DAG, with a resulting inhibition of secretion. D,1 propranolol, an inhibitor of PA phosphohydrolase, inhibited the IgE-dependent production of [14C]-DAG, and [14C]-free fatty acid but not [14C]-PA. The IgE-dependent release of both histamine and AA metabolites was completely inhibited by pretreatment with propranolol. Taken together, the above results suggest that phospholipase D is activated upon cross-bridging of IgE receptors on the surface of RBL 2H3 cells and that this may be a pivotal step in the signal transduction cascade leading to the release of both presynthesized and de novo synthesized mediators.\r"

  ".W": "ATP-specific P2-purinoceptors expressed on various cell types have been shown to trigger cell activation via a phospholipase C pathway. In the present study, we provide evidence that P2-purinoceptors are expressed on B lymphocytes but not on T lymphocytes. ATP at concentrations of 10 to 100 microM triggered a dose-dependent increase in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) levels as well as total inositol phosphate in human B lymphocytes. As expected from the changes in IP3, incubation of B cells with increasing concentrations of ATP lead to a dose-dependent increase in cytosolic free Ca+2 ([Ca+2]i). Extracellular ATP also induced increases in the levels of c-fos and c-myc mRNA. Because no responses were elicited by other nucleotides, the increase in IP3 production, the rise in [Ca+2]i levels, and the enhanced expression of c-fos and c-myc mRNA seem to be mediated by P2-purinoceptors. These responses were exclusive to B lymphocytes, in that ATP had no effect on IP3, [Ca+2]i, or oncogene expression in T cells. The results show that binding of extracellular ATP to P2-purinoceptors on quiescent B cells leads to the activation of genes associated with cell activation. This appears to be mediated via the phospholipase C signal transduction pathway.\r"

  ".W": "Platelet-activating factor is a potent mediator of the inflammatory response. Studies of the actions of platelet-activating factor have centered mainly around neutrophils, monocytes, and platelets. In this report we begin to uncover the influence of platelet-activating factor on B lymphocytes. Employing the EBV-transformed human B cell line SKW6.4, we demonstrate that platelet-activating factor significantly alters membrane phospholipid metabolism indicated by the incorporation of 32P into phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidic acid but not significantly into phosphatidylethanolamine at concentrations ranging from 10(-9) to 10(-6) M. The inactive precursor, lyso-platelet-activating factor, at a concentration as high as 10(-7) M had no effect on any of the membrane phospholipids. We also show that platelet-activating factor from 10(-12) to 10(-6) M induced rapid and significant elevation in intracellular calcium levels, whereas lyso-platelet-activating factor was again ineffective. We further demonstrate the impact of platelet-activating factor binding to B cells by measuring platelet-activating factor induced arachidonic acid release and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid production. Moreover, platelet-activating factor was capable of inducing transcription of the nuclear proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-jun. Finally we explored the possible role of 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid as a regulator of arachidonic acid liberation demonstrating that endogenous 5-lipoxygenase activity modulates platelet-activating factor induced arachidonic acid release perhaps acting at the level of phospholipase A2. In summary, platelet-activating factor is shown here to have a direct and profound effect on a pure B cell line.\r"

In this study, we have used TSST-1 to probe the role of MHC-class II molecules in the activation and differentiation of resting human B cells. Highly purified B cells were stimulated with TSST-1, alone or in combination with PMA or with anti-human IgM antibodies (anti-mu) and the resulting B cell proliferation and Ig production were monitored. On its own, TSST-1 failed to induce B cell proliferation or Ig production. However, TSST-1 synergized with PMA and with anti-mu in inducing B cell proliferation in the absence of any added T cells or T cell factors. TSST-1 did not induce or potentiate early activation events associated with anti-mu treatment such as phosphoinositide hydrolysis and Ca2+ mobilization. Also, TSST-1 did not potentiate the capacity of anti-mu to induce the transcription of early activation genes such as c-myc. Finally, in contrast to its capacity to promote mitogen-trigered B cell proliferation, TSST-1 failed to induce the differentiation of B lymphocytes into Ig-secreting cells in the absence of added T cells. These results indicate that TSST-1 delivers a comitogenic signal to B cells via MHC-class II molecules that is distinct from signals delivered via surface mu and further strengthens the role of MHC-class II molecules as signal transducing structures.\r"

  ".W": "Liver fibrosis is the most serious complication of infection with Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma japonicum and is responsible for severe morbidity and mortality in hundreds of thousands of patients in many Third World nations. The pathogenesis of this condition remains to be elucidated. We proposed that certain cytokines produced by cells that comprise the chronic granulomas that surround the helminth eggs within the liver initiate hepatic fibrogenesis. We now report our successful purification to apparent homogeneity of the egg granuloma-derived fibroblast mitogen. The high affinity of this factor for heparin (elutes from heparin-Sepharose with 1.5 M NaCl) facilitates its purification by a two-step procedure, and identifies the cytokine as a heparin-binding growth factor (HBGF). Furthermore, because it has an isoelectric point approximately equal to 6.2, it has one of the characteristics of a class 1 (acidic) HBGF. We immunized rabbits with the purified factor and observed that the resulting antibodies (IgG) detected the factor but not acidic fibroblast growth factor (the prototypic class 1 HBGF) either by dot-blot ELISA or neutralization of biologic activity. The granuloma product and fibroblast growth factor also differ in target-cell specificity and amino acid composition. On the basis of these distinctions, we have designated the granuloma-derived mitogen fibroblast-stimulating factor-1. With the availability of purified fibroblast-stimulating factor-1 and the future analysis of its amino acid sequence, its structural relationship to other mesenchymal growth factors can be determined.\r"

In this study, the clearance of t-PA, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), and t-PA-PAI-1 complex was determined in an isolated perfused rat liver system. The clearance of t-PA-PAI-1 complex was twice as fast as that of t-PA, whereas PAI-1 was cleared slowly. The half-lives for t-PA, determined by a two-compartmental pharmacokinetic model, were: alpha, 20.1 minutes, and beta, 120.0 minutes. The corresponding values for t-PA-PAI-1 complex were: alpha, 9.7 minutes, and beta, about 7 hours. The model microconstants were computed for t-PA and t-PA-PAI-1 complex and the marked difference between the \"on\" microconstants k12 for t-PA (0.026 +/- 0.001 min-1) and t-PA-PAI-1 complex (0.090 +/- 0.025 min-1) suggests that the effect on binding to liver cells is the most important factor in the faster clearance of t-PA-PAI-1 complex when compared with t-PA.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) that occur immediately after head injury and the effects of different posttraumatic lesions on CBF, 61 CBF studies were obtained using the xenon-computerized tomography method in 32 severely head-injured adults (Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS) less than or equal to 7). The measurements were made within 7 days after injury, 43% in the first 24 hours. During the 1st day, patients with an initial GCS score of 3 or 4 and no surgical mass had significantly lower flows than did those with a higher GCS score or mass lesions (p less than 0.05): in the first 1 to 4 hours, those without surgical mass lesions had a mean CBF of 27 cc/100 gm/min, which rose to 44 cc/100 gm/min by 24 hours. Patients without surgical mass lesions who died tended to have a lower global CBF than did those with better outcomes. Mass lesions were associated with a high global CBF and bihemispheric contusions with the lowest flows. By 24 hours after injury, global blood flow increased in groups that originally had low flows and decreased in those with very high initial flows, such that by 36 to 48 hours, most patients had CBF values between 32 and 55 cc/100 gm/min. Lobar, basal ganglion, and brain-stem blood flow values frequently differed by 25% or more from global averages. Brain-stem CBF varied the most but did not correlate with clinical signs of brain-stem dysfunction. Double studies were performed at two different pCO2 values in 10 patients with various posttraumatic lesions, and the CO2 vasoresponsivity was calculated. Abnormal CO2 vasoresponsivity was found with acute subdural hematomas and defuse cerebral swelling but not with epidural hematomas. In patients without surgical mass lesions, the findings suggest that CBF in the first few hours after injury is often low, followed by a hyperemic phase that peaks at 24 hours. Global CBF values vary widely depending on the type of traumatic brain injury, and brain-stem flow is often not accurately reflected by global CBF values. These findings underscore the need to define regional CBF abnormalities in victims of severe head injury if treatment is intended to prevent regional ischemia.\r"

After 60 minutes, intravascular virus was cleared by saline perfusion and the animals were sacrificed. A marked increase (fourfold, p less than or equal to 0.02) in radioactivity was observed in the ipsilateral brain hemisphere when compared to control animals without barrier modification. Administration of intravenous virus immediately after BBB modification displayed no difference in delivery when compared to intracarotid saline-infused controls (without BBB modification) suggesting the importance of a first-pass phenomenon. There were no significant differences in serum concentrations among intracarotid or intravenous groups. These preliminary studies suggest the possibility of delivering viral particles across the BBB with osmotic disruption, which may permit delivery of genetic material in replication-defective viral vectors in the feline model of GM2-gangliosidosis.\r"

The specimens were taken from 23 glioblastomas, 35 metastatic tumors, 42 meningiomas, 16 low-grade gliomas, and seven acoustic neurinomas; seven specimens were from normal brain. A strong correlation was found between the results of the two assays (r = 0.77, p less than 0.0001). There was a threefold difference in the tPA content of the benign tumors as compared to malignant tumors (p = 0.0006), the latter having less tPA. Histologically benign meningiomas contained higher tPA than malignant meningiomas (p = 0.01); however, the difference between low-grade gliomas and high-grade gliomas was less evident. Overall regression analysis data have shown an inverse relationship between the tissue content in tPA and the presence and degree of tumor necrosis and peritumoral brain edema (p = 0.004 and p = 0.0004, respectively). This finding was most consistent in the glioblastoma group where the correlation coefficient values were r = 0.53 and r = -0.55, respectively. There was no significant correlation between the tissue tPA content and the age and sex, steroid use, or plasma tPA of the patients or the duration of symptoms. In summary, this is the first demonstration of tPA in a large series of human brain tumors and in normal brain. The differences observed have clear biological significance and, although the source of tPA in tumor tissue is still unknown, a relative reduction in tPA in tumor tissue may play an integral role in the development of tissue necrosis and tissue edema. The lack of tPA in tumor necrosis was not due to tissue destruction and cell death since urokinase was readily detectable in that tissue.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the relationship between eradication of bacterial infection and clinical improvement in children with otitis media, we reviewed the clinical outcome of bacterial otitis media in patients enrolled in double-blind trials of antibacterial therapy from 1979 to 1988. Cultures of middle ear exudates showed the distribution of bacterial pathogens to be similar to that observed in other geographic areas. Two hundred ninety-three patients had otitis media caused by bacterial pathogens and underwent repeat tympanocentesis after 3 to 6 days of therapy. Bacteriologic success was demonstrated in 253 patients (86%); 40 patients (14%) had bacteriologic failure. Children who had bacteriologic failure were younger than those with bacteriologic success (median age 10.6 vs 18.5 months; p = 0.001); 38% of patients who had bacteriologic failure were black, compared with 18% of patients with bacteriologic success (p = 0.007). Gender, history of frequent otitis media, and presence of bilateral otitis media were not risk factors for bacteriologic failure. Clinical success was demonstrated in 261 patients (89%); 32 patients (11%) had clinical failure. Agreement between clinical and bacteriologic response was 86% (95% confidence interval: 81.6% to 89.6%). Ninety-three percent (236/253) of subjects whose infection was eliminated had clinical resolution, whereas 37% (15/40) of those with bacteriologic failure had persisting symptoms or signs of clinical failure. We conclude that failure to eliminate bacteria from the middle ear is often associated with persistent signs and symptoms. Bacteriologic failure affects children less than 18 months of age almost exclusively. Bacteriologic and clinical failure are frequently discordant; mechanisms unrelated to the bacterial infection may explain some of the persisting clinical signs.\r"

  ".W": "The stimulation of postsynaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)B receptors leads to slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials due to the influx of K(+)-ions. This was studied biochemically, in vitro in mammalian cultured spinal cord neurons by using 86Rb as a substitute for K+. (-)-Baclofen, a GABAB receptor agonist, produced a concentration-dependent increase in the 86Rb-influx. This effect was stereospecific and blocked by GABAB receptor antagonists like CGP 35 348 (3-aminopropyl-diethoxymethyl-phosphonic acid) and phaclofen. Apart from the GABAB receptors, both adenosine via adenosine1 receptors and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) via 5-HT1 alpha agonists also increased the 86Rb-influx. These agonists failed to show any additivity between them when they were combined in their maximal concentration. In addition, their effect was antagonized specifically by their respective antagonists without influencing the others. These findings suggest the presence of GABAB, adenosine1 and 5-HT1 alpha receptors in the cultured spinal cord neurons, which exhibit a heterologous regulation of the same K(+)-channel. The effect of these agonists were antagonized by phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, an activator of protein kinase C, and pretreatment with pertussis toxin. This suggests that these agonists by acting on their own receptors converge on the same K(+)-channel through the Gi/Go proteins. In summary, we have developed a biochemical functional assay for studying and characterizing GABAB synaptic pharmacology in vitro, using spinal cord neurons.\r"

  ".W": "RP 49356 is a novel compound which relaxes airway smooth muscle in vitro. Like cromakalim, RP 49356 reduced contractility in guinea pig isolated trachealis under basal conditions or when challenged with low (less than 20 mM) but not high K+. These effects were antagonized by the sulphonylureas glibenclamide and glipizide. This spectrum of action is typical of the class of compounds known as potassium channel openers (KCOs). Unlike RP 49356 and cromakalim, nifedipine had no effect on basal tone, relaxed tissues contracted with low or high K+ and was not antagonized by the sulphonylureas. These data suggest that the KCOs are not acting directly at the voltage-gated Ca++ channel in this tissue. RP 49356 and cromakalim were similar to nifedipine by being more potent at relaxing tissues precontracted with carbachol or histamine (spasmolytic effects) than they were at preventing initiation of the response to these spasmogens (antispasmogenic effects). Because the maintained phase of contraction in airway smooth muscle may be associated with some Ca++ influx, the data presented here suggests that, like nifedipine, the KCOs are more active smooth muscle relaxants under conditions of Ca++ influx. In summary, RP 49356, like cromakalim, is a compound which relaxes airway smooth muscle in vitro by opening a sulphonylurea-sensitive K+ channel which may be similar to the ATP-sensitive K+ channel found in other tissues.\r"

DA neuronal activity was estimated by measuring: 1) the accumulation of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine after administration of a decarboxylase inhibitor and 2) the concentration of the DA metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenyla-cetic acid in brain (striatum, nucleus accumbens and median eminence) and pituitary regions (intermediate lobe and neural lobe) containing terminals of these neurons. Under basal (non-stimulated) conditions, U-50,488 produced a dose- and time-related decrease in the activity of tuberohypophysial DA neurons, but failed to alter the activity of nigrostriatal, mesolimbic or tuberoinfundibular DA neurons. The ability of U-50,488 to inhibit the basal activity of tuberohypophysial DA neurons was blocked by pretreatment with the kappa opioid antagonist nor-binaltorphimine. The activity of nigrostriatal, mesolimbic and intermediate lobe tuberohypophysial DA neurons was increased by haloperidol, whereas the activity of tuberoinfundibular DA neurons was increased by prolactin. U-50,488 decreased the activity of nigrostriatal, mesolimbic and tuberohypophysial DA neurons in haloperidol-treated rats, and decreased the activity of tuberoinfundibular DA neurons in prolactin-treated rats. These results indicate that activation of kappa opioid receptors inhibits all DA neuronal systems in the brain, but that this effect on nigrostriatal, mesolimbic and tuberoinfundibular DA neurons is evident only after these neurons have been activated.\r"

We postulated that the effect of salt balance on the vasoconstrictor response to A1-adenosine receptor stimulation was due to a change intrinsic to the kidney, perhaps related to a change in responsiveness of the renal A1-adenosine receptor population. We tested this hypothesis by determining the renovascular response to the metabolically stable, selective, A1-adenosine receptor agonist N6-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA) in salt-loaded and salt-depleted rats in vivo and in isolated, perfused kidneys harvested from these rats. CHA was a renal vasoconstrictor in the salt-depleted animals and a renal vasodilator in the salt-loaded rats. In the isolated, perfused kidneys, CHA produced a biphasic response with submicromolar concentrations being vasoconstrictor and higher concentrations being vasodilator. In contrast to the response in vivo CHA was a more potent vasoconstrictor in the isolated, perfused kidneys that had been removed from salt-loaded animals. Indomethacin enhanced the vasoconstrictor response to CHA in the kidneys removed from salt-loaded animals but had no effect on the kidneys from salt-depleted animals. These findings indicate that the inhibition of the renal vasoconstrictor response to CHA in salt-loaded animals is not related to a change within the kidney but that a factor extrinsic to the kidney must be responsible for the change in adenosine responsiveness in vivo.\r"

We have investigated the effects of this compound on contractile force and 86Rb efflux, using the rabbit aorta, in order to assess its K channel activator properties. K channel blockers and ionic conditions thought to modulate specific K channel types have been used to provide insight into the K channel(s) affected by this compound. WAY-120,491 evoked relaxation of precontracted rabbit aortic rings and increased the rate of 86Rb efflux from strips of rabbit aorta; both effects occurring in a concentration-dependent manner. The WAY-120,491 (1 microM)-induced 86Rb efflux was inhibited by tetraethylammonium (IC50 = 0.38 mM), indicating that the increased efflux was mediated by K channels. Glyburide completely blocked the WAY-120,491 (1 microM)-evoked 86Rb efflux with 50% block occurring at a concentration of 0.48 microM. Glyburide also antagonized the WAY-120,491-induced relaxation of aortic rings. Omission of Ca from the solution bathing the aorta did not inhibit the WAY-120,491 induced 86Rb efflux but rather caused an augmentation of the response. It is concluded that WAY-120,491 may be classified as a K channel opener. Furthermore, the K channel upon which WAY-120,491 acts exhibits some characteristics normally associated with the ATP regulated K channel although the involvement of other K channel types has not been ruled out.\r"

We have previously demonstrated that this agent manifests the properties of both a direct nitrovasodilator and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in vitro. The present investigation was performed to evaluate the effects of SnoCap in vivo. Intravenous administration of SnoCap produced immediate reductions in blood pressure and significantly attenuated the pressor response to angiotensin I. Equieffective doses of SnoCap had a greater duration of action after intravenous bolus administration compared with nitroglycerin (15.3 +/- 2.6 min vs. 3.2 +/- 0.5 min, respectively; P less than .01); importantly, this effect was apparent despite the relatively short plasma half-life of the compound (T1/2 alpha = 0.48 min, T1/2 beta = 5.54 min) and did not appear to be the result of inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme. Another unexpected property of SnoCap was that its nitrovasodilator effect was 10- to 30-fold less potent than nitroglycerin when administered as a bolus, but more efficacious when given by continuous infusion. These data support the view that SnoCap is a vasoactive substance with the properties of a nitrovasodilator and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, as well as the unique properties of an extended duration of action and greater potency when administered by continuous intravenous infusion than by bolus injection. The clinical utility of this compound in humans and in individuals with specific disease states remains to be demonstrated.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic treatment of neuroblastoma x glioma NG108-15 hybrid cells with the opioid agonist D-Ala,2 D-Leu5-enkephalin (DADLE) induces a homologous desensitization of the delta opioid receptors present in these cells. Since the Kd value of the delta opioid receptor's high-affinity state reflects the potency of the agonist, we examined the effect of receptor desensitization in NG108-15 cells on the percentage of receptor in the high-affinity state. When NG108-15 hybrid cells were treated with 10 or 100 nM DADLE for 4 hr at 24 degrees C, loss of DADLE's ability to inhibit adenylate cyclase was observed. However, when competition binding experiments were carried out with P2P3 membranes isolated from the delta opioid-desensitized hybrid cells, it was determined that 41.7 +/- 3.4% of the total binding sites remained in the high-affinity state, with no apparent alteration in the Kd value of either high- or low-affinity states. Similarly, when NG108-15 cells were treated with 100 ng/ml of pertussis toxin for 3 hr at 37 degrees C, 39.9 +/- 3.6% of the binding sites remained in the high-affinity state. This reduction in the percentage of receptor in high-affinity state was agonist specific, for chronic treatment of hybrid cells with levorphanol, a partial agonist, or the antagonist naloxone did not alter the percentage of opioid receptors in the high-affinity state. Furthermore, the delta opioid receptors remaining in the high-affinity state after chronic DADLE treatment were still sensitive to both Na+ and guanyldylimidodiphosphate, indicating that opioid ligand binding remained coupled to the G-proteins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This was tested in a dog model of acute myocardial infarction that used pentobarbital anesthetized dogs subjected to 90 min regional myocardial ischemia and 5 h reperfusion. Dogs were treated with 1 unit/kg Ancrod (venom from the Malayan pit viper, Agkistrodon rhodostoma) or vehicle i.v. 60 min after left circumflex coronary artery occlusion. Therapeutic defibrination was verified in Ancrod-treated dogs by measurements of clottable fibrinogen, alpha-2 antiplasmin and plasminogen, by the activated partial thromboplastin time and by immunoelectrophoresis. Fibrinogen was depleted to below detectable limits of the assay (less than 0.05 mg/ml) after treatment with Ancrod. The defibrination effect was accomplished by the expected activation of the fibrinolytic system: alpha-2 antiplasmin was decreased by 10% and plasminogen activity was decreased by 30% with Ancrod treatment. There were no measureable differences between the two treatment groups in heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, rate pressure product or circumflex coronary blood flow throughout the 90 min of regional ischemia or during the 5 h of reperfusion. The relative severity of ischemia between the two treatment groups was similar when assessed with radiolabeled microsphere measurement of myocardial blood flow. The accumulation of neutrophils (measured by myeloperoxidase activity) within the myocardium after reperfusion was not reduced by prior depletion of fibrinogen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

TRGs were developed using 1983 Maryland trauma patient hospital discharge abstracts (n= 34,702), the same source used to assign a DRG. We compared estimated TRG and DRG payments to actual charges for 17,398 trauma cases treated during 1986 at five trauma centers and 18 community hospitals in the Central Maryland Metropolitan Statistical Area. The unexpected findings of this study are that an anatomic severity-based classification of hospital trauma discharges (TRGs) does not perform as well as DRGs in: 1) explaining variations in length of stay for trauma cases, or 2) assuring an appropriate distribution of revenues to regional trauma centers and community hospitals. Solutions discussed include segregating community hospital and trauma center costs in computation of average per case rate setting, and inclusion of physiologic and mechanism of injury parameters in prospective payment classification systems to increase explained variance of resource use.\r"

Treatment of Oxy-Hb with ascorbic acid suppressed the ability of Oxy-Hb to contract the arteries, especially in the monkey arteries. The ability of intracisternally applied Oxy-Hb to constrict the basilar artery in anesthetized dogs was diminished when Oxy-Hb was treated previously with ascorbic acid (AsA-Hb). The contraction caused by Oxy-Hb was suppressed by treatment with indomethacin and aspirin in isolated bovine cerebral arteries. Endothelium-dependent relaxations elicited by substance P and relaxations induced by stimulation of the vasodilator nerves with nicotine were suppressed by treatment with Oxy-Hb and AsA-Hb; however, the inhibitory effect of AsA-Hb was markedly less. Oxy-Hb attenuated nitroglycerin-induced relaxations in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas AsA-Hb in concentrations up to 1.6 x 10(-5) M did not significantly influence the relaxations. It is concluded that incubation of Oxy-Hb with ascorbic acid alters markedly the biological activity of Oxy-Hb; the vasoconstrictor activity is suppressed, and the ability to diminish vasodilator actions is minimized. These findings provide a rationale for the use of ascorbic acid in cisternal irrigation to prevent the development of cerebral vasospasm after a subarachnoid hemorrhage.\r"

Lifelong pharmacologic immunosuppression renders these patients susceptible to many infections. The purpose of this article is to provide guidelines for treating the patient with end-stage liver disease, both before and after transplantation. In addition, we shall discuss some of the medical implications associated with end-stage liver disease and their clinical presentations and appropriate presurgical management. Adverse side effects of long-term immunosuppression and their effect on the oral and maxillofacial region shall also be discussed. Last, a brief discussion of FK506, the latest immunosuppressant, will be presented together with the implications of its use on our surgical treatment of these patients.\r"

Minimal antimicrobial concentrations of these two agents against selected microbial flora reported in carious primary teeth were 3.125% for glutaraldehyde and 0.75% for formocresol. At a doubling of these concentrations, most organisms, except Candida albicans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus mutans, were killed by both substances in 30 seconds. Cytotoxicity was evaluated on tissue cultures of pulp fibroblasts and HeLa cells at minimal cidal concentrations and at 10- and 100-fold dilutions. Exposure of pulp fibroblasts and HeLa cells to formocresol and indirect exposure to vapors caused the cells to become atrophic and to form a less dense tissue pattern. Cells directly exposed to glutaraldehyde retained their normal cell shape and tissue pattern, whereas cells indirectly exposed to vapors continued to proliferate. These data showed effective antimicrobial activity at concentrations of 3.125% glutaraldehyde and 0.75% formocresol and suggested that glutaraldehyde may exert a less cytotoxic effect on the immediate and surrounding tissues when used as a pulpotomy agent.\r"

Unmonitored tube passage may result in complications and delays the beginning of tube feedings. The authors studied the results of 882 fluoroscopically guided feeding tube placements in 448 patients in 1 year to determine rates of success and complications, as well as the long-term outcome of this population of patients. Seven hundred sixty-four attempts (86.6%) were successful in positioning the tube distal to the third portion of the duodenum. Four major complications (three fatal arrhythmias and one tracheobronchial injury) were encountered. Only seven patients (2%) experienced aspiration events that were due to positioning of the tube in the distal duodenum. Seventy-seven percent of patients required either one or two tubes; the average \"tube life\" was 7.8 days. Most repositionings were required because of patient noncompliance or inappropriate administration of solid medications. Fluoroscopically guided nasoenteric tube passage is safe, easily performed, and highly successful, and has resulted in widespread clinical acceptance in our institution.\r"

  ".W": "Limited-stage small cell lung cancer is frequently treated with induction combination chemotherapy (ICC), followed by consolidation with thoracic irradiation. It has been suggested that patients who do not have a complete response to ICC are unlikely to have control of occult distant metastasis and consequently have such a poor prognosis that thoracic irradiation is unlikely to be of benefit. To examine this hypothesis, 48 patients treated on prospective protocols who achieved a complete response to ICC or subsequently to thoracic irradiation were analyzed. Twenty-four patients had a complete response to ICC (CR-ICC), and 24 subsequently converted to complete-response status after thoracic irradiation (CR-TI). The two groups had similar prognostic factors and treatment. Comparing CR-ICC and CR-TI patients, survival was 40% versus 26% at 2 years and 35% versus 4% at 5 years, respectively (P less than .05). Freedom from distant metastasis was 41% at 5 years for the CR-ICC patients and 8% for the CR-TI patients (P less than .05). A modest number of CR-TI patients were long-term survivors, suggesting a value for thoracic irradiation as consolidation therapy.\r"

Breast sonography is not useful for screening for breast cancer in any age group. Its main use is for the differentiation of cystic vs solid palpable and mammographically visible masses. If strict sonographic criteria are used for a simple cyst, the diagnostic accuracy approaches 100%. Sonographic diagnosis of a simple cyst precludes the need for further workup, including aspiration, biopsy, or followup. This article emphasizes the technical aspects of breast sonography, especially those factors that alter the diagnostic information on the images. These factors can be especially problematic in differentiating cysts and solid masses, the most common diagnostic use of breast sonography. Selection of equipment depends largely on the requirements of a specific practice. Optimally, the sonographic equipment is located close to where mammography is performed, and the sonographic and mammographic findings are interpreted together.\r"

Review of the literature identified potential uses for this technique: (1) in the spine, for differentiation between scar tissue and recurrent disk herniation and for evaluation of epidural tumors; (2) in musculoskeletal tumors, for differentiation between tumor necrosis and peritumoral edema and for characterization and evaluation of tumors before and after treatment; (3) in the joints for delineation of cartilage and tendon tears, with intraarticular injection, and for differentiation between pannus and joint effusion, with IV injection; and (4) for delineation of infectious processes. Further studies are needed to confirm most of these potential indications. It is unlikely that gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced MR imaging will become a routine part of musculoskeletal MR imaging, and its use will be reserved for specific circumstances.\r"

We compared plain film radiography with five postprocessing algorithms of storage phosphor digital radiography (2144 x 1744 x 10 bit matrix with 0.2-mm pixel size) in the detection of CT-proved bullous lung disease (35 patients and 25 normal control subjects). Receiver-operating-characteristic analysis of 2160 observations by six interpreters was done to evaluate the observers' performance. By analysis of variance (p less than .05), we found that the default digital algorithm and the three edge-enhancing algorithms of high and medium frequencies performed less well than plain films did, but the differences fell short of statistical significance. Gray-scale reversal was the only digital algorithm that performed significantly less well than plain films did. We conclude that any differences between digital algorithms and plain films in the detection of bullous lung disease were too small to be detected in this study. Any difference between the two methods in providing clinically important, diagnostic information is likely to be insignificant.\r"

In both conditions, extracolonic expressions are the rule rather than the exception, and familiarity with them is essential for accurate diagnosis and correct patient management. In this pictorial essay, we discuss familial polyposis coli and Gardner syndrome together under the heading familial adenomatous polyposis syndromes. The colonic characteristics of these syndromes will be reviewed briefly, followed by examples of the most common extracolonic manifestations.\r"

CT findings in patients with disseminated M. tuberculosis included focal lesions in the liver (11%), spleen (30%), kidneys (19%), pancreas (7%), and gastrointestinal tract (15%) and lymph nodes with central or diffuse low attenuation (93%). CT findings in patients with disseminated M. avium-intracellulare included marked hepatomegaly (20%); marked splenomegaly (14%); focal lesions in the liver (9%), spleen (7%), and kidneys (2%); diffuse jejunal wall thickening (18%); lymph nodes with central low attenuation (14%); and enlarged lymph nodes exclusively of homogeneous soft-tissue density (55%). The presence of focal visceral lesions and low-attenuation lymph nodes suggests disseminated M. tuberculosis, whereas marked hepatic and splenic enlargement, diffuse jejunal wall thickening, and enlarged soft-tissue-density lymph nodes suggest disseminated M. avium-intracellulare. Recognition of these CT features can lead to a tentative diagnosis so that appropriate therapy can be instituted before the results of mycobacterial cultures become available.\r"

  ".W": "In vitro lithotripsy with the Siemens Lithostar was conducted on 36 radiolucent or minimally calcified gallstones housed in an anthropomorphic phantom. The ease and pattern of fragmentation were correlated with global composition for the entire stone, regional or microcomposition (determined by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy), and microstructure (determined by scanning electron microscopy). Stones made up of more than 62% cholesterol required 50% more shock waves to pulverize all fragments to 0.3 cm or less than did stones of less than 62% cholesterol (p less than .01). An inverse relationship was found between the number of shock waves needed for fragmentation and the cholesterol content (r = .77). Although a broad range of fragmentation responses occurred, little variation was seen in the ease of fragmentation within stone families. The majority of stones fractured along radially oriented cholesterol plates, but one third of stones treated showed initial chipping or flaking at the periphery before radial fracture. This type of peripheral erosion most often occurred in stones with peripheral pigment rims. These stones required more shock waves and lagged in pulverization compared with more homogeneous cholesterol stones. The efficiency of fragmentation during biliary lithotripsy correlates with the stones' global cholesterol content. A stone's architecture, as reflected by its regional composition and microstructure, partially predicts the mechanism of fragmentation. These in vitro data may be useful in further refining criteria for selecting patients and understanding the fragmentation process.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with end-stage kidney disease, particularly those treated with dialysis, develop proliferative processes in their native kidneys that result in the formation of multiple acquired renal cysts, renal adenomas, and carcinomas. Data about these abnormalities have been acquired mainly from retrospective studies. We undertook a longitudinal prospective study in which the native kidneys of 30 dialysis patients were surveyed by serial CT during a 7-year period to study the natural history of acquired renal cystic disease and the frequency of associated complications. Acquired cysts were seen in 87% of patients at the end of the study compared with 57% at the study's onset, and a significant increase was seen in mean renal volume with time. Five patients (17%) developed large hemorrhagic renal cysts and four (13%) developed large perinephric hematomas. Renal cell carcinomas developed in two patients (7%) without renal symptoms. One carcinoma invaded the renal capsule, but did not cause metastases. The other carcinoma was widely metastatic. Our findings are consistent with those of earlier studies documenting an increased prevalence of renal cell carcinoma in dialysis patients as compared with the general population. However, our conclusions are limited because the study sample is small and no control population was studied. We conclude that acquired renal cystic disease in dialysis patients is a progressive disorder often associated with cyst hemorrhage. Dialysis patients may also have an increased prevalence of renal cell carcinoma.\r"

  ".U": "91135594\r", 
  ".W": "The use of superselective embolization was assessed as a treatment for bleeding from postbiopsy arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) in renal transplants. AVFs commonly occur after biopsy procedures in renal transplants, but severe bleeding is rare. Transcatheter embolization can be used to control bleeding, but unless it is sufficiently selective, the procedure results in loss of significant amounts of renal parenchyma. During a 4-year period, embolization procedures were attempted in seven patients 30-65 years old. All had AVFs shown on arteriography. Five patients underwent embolization; occlusion occurred only in the branch supplying the AVF. In one patient with three large AVFs, two were found to have occluded the day after embolization was attempted. In another, an AVF occluded when superselective catheter position was achieved but before embolization. Catheter manipulation in these cases may have precipitated occlusion. In five cases, coaxial embolization techniques were used. Embolization materials consisted of coils in three cases: 0.038 in. (0.97 mm) in one case, 0.025 in. (0.64 mm) in one case, 0.018 in. (0.46 mm) in one case; 0.038 in. (0.97 mm) coils and gelatin foam particles in one case; and localized contrast extravasation in one case. Serum creatinine level was measured before and after embolization in all patients, and radionuclide studies were undertaken in three cases. In all patients, bleeding was effectively controlled. None of the patients showed an increase in serum creatinine level after embolization, and in four, significant improvement was seen. Nuclear medicine studies showed no loss of renal function and a dramatic improvement in one patient. No complications due to the procedure were seen. Our experience suggests that superselective embolization with coaxial catheter techniques is an effective method of treating bleeding from postbiopsy AVFs in renal transplants with minimal loss of renal parenchyma.\r"

However, the likelihood of extracapsular spread of prostatic cancer rises with increasing tumor volume. The aim of our study was to assess the accuracy of MR with a body coil in diagnosing capsular penetration indirectly via an estimation of prostatic tumor volumes. Twenty-six patients with proved prostatic cancer that was clinically confined to the gland underwent MR imaging before radical prostatectomy and whole-mount pathologic sectioning of the specimen. Twenty of 31 lesions prospectively outlined on the MR images corresponded to cancers outlined on the pathology slides, and tumor volumes were calculated by using a voxel summation technique. On MR, tumor volume was underestimated in 11 of 20 cases and overestimated in nine of 20 cases. Only two of 20 size estimates based on MR findings were within 10% of actual tumor volume. Overlap in MR tumor volumes was significant between lesions with and without capsular penetration at microscopy. Factors contributing to inaccuracies in measurements of tumor volume on MR images included the variable histologic make-up of the tumors. Our results show that, although knowledge of the size of a prostatic lesion is important in predicting the behavior of the tumor, MR imaging with a body coil is not reliable for accurate estimation of tumor volume.\r"

As the spines are difficult to identify on the anteroposterior digital scout radiograph, the fovea of the femoral head has been used as a landmark to determine the level of the appropriate axial slice. We assessed the accuracy of this landmark on CT scans in 23 women undergoing CT pelvimetry and in 20 nonpregnant women having pelvic CT scans. In each case the relationship between the level of the foveae and the level of the ischial spines was determined. True interspinous distances were measured and compared with the apparent interspinous distances at the level of the foveae. In none of the women were the ischial spines above the foveae. In 15 (65%) of 23 pregnant women and in seven (35%) of 20 nonpregnant women, the ischial spines were below the foveae. An incorrect scanning level led to an overestimation of interspinous distance by an average of 1.0 cm. We conclude that for CT pelvimetry, the fovea as seen on the anteroposterior digital radiograph is an inaccurate landmark for the level of the ischial spines.\r"

The purpose of our study was to establish the range of appearances of fibromatoses on MR images and perform a pathologic correlation to explain the variable signal-intensity patterns. During a 3-year period, 26 patients with deep fibromatoses were examined with MR. The MR images were evaluated for signal-intensity characteristics, and findings were correlated retrospectively with the pathologic diagnoses. The results showed that the MR appearance of fibromatoses is similar to that of other soft-tissue lesions, and the signal intensities vary greatly from lesion to lesion and within lesions themselves. The fibromatoses were either hyperintense, isointense, hypointense, or of mixed signal intensity relative to adjacent skeletal muscle. The hypointense areas appear to be zones of hypocellularity and dense collagen deposition. Microscopically all of the lesions invaded adjacent structures, but the MR appearances of the margins varied and were judged to be well demarcated (n = 14), intermediate (n = 5), or poorly demarcated (n = 6). Our experience shows that fibromatoses have a variable MR appearance no different from that of other soft-tissue lesions, and this variability reflects the composition and cellularity of the lesions.\r"

Whether the dysplastic bone growth was related to drug dose or age of onset of chelation could not be determined, as deferoxamine dosages differed in the two groups. Findings on radiographs included flattening of the thoracic and lumbar vertebral bodies, circumferential metaphyseal osseous defects, sharp zones of provisional calcification, and widened growth plates. Healing was noted in one of the patients after the dose of deferoxamine was decreased. Zinc levels in both affected patients did not differ from those in the 25 other chelated patients.\r"

Ten of those neonates were reevaluated at 36-42 months of age for evidence of hypertension, renal abnormalities, and leg-growth disturbances. They were compared with an age-matched control group of seven infants. Blood pressures were greater than the 95th percentile in three infants and between the 50th and the 95th percentile in six of the 10 infants. Height was less than the fifth percentile for age in four infants with aortic thrombosis. One child had a 1.0-cm discrepancy in leg-length measurements, and seven of nine patients exhibited a 0.5-2.0 cm discrepancy between legs in either thigh or calf circumference. Sonography showed no evidence of residual clot in the aorta or renal vessels. Doppler flow was normal in all cases. Despite resolution of neonatal aortic thrombosis, complications resulting in renovascular hypertension (three of 10 patients) and leg-growth abnormalities (eight of nine) can occur. Hypertension (one of seven) and leg-growth discrepancy (four of seven) were less frequent in the 3-year follow-up of the seven matched control infants. We suggest that infants with known aortic thrombosis receive long-term follow-up to detect these potential problems.\r"

In all five cases, the diagnosis was made prospectively by cranial sonography. Sonographic findings were compared with those in a control group of 15 infants with normal posterior fossae at autopsy. The following sonographic abnormalities were exhibited in neonates with posterior fossae hemorrhage: loss of definition of the cerebellum and fourth ventricle on midline sagittal images, heterogeneous cerebellar parenchyma, focal hypoechoic lesions, ventricular dilatation, and tentorial abnormalities. Bright foci inferior to the third ventricle were seen in four neonates in the normal control group. These foci measured 5-10 mm in diameter. One cranial sonogram was falsely interpreted as showing a posterior fossa hemorrhage because of prominent echoes in the interpeduncular cistern. Infants treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation are at risk for developing posterior fossa hemorrhage. Awareness of sonographic signs and potential pitfalls in the interpretation of posterior fossa hemorrhage is important for early and accurate recognition of these unusual and sometimes treatable hemorrhages.\r"

We previously reported the immediate technical efficacy of the method in eight arterial and 10 bypass graft occlusions. We now describe the clinical efficacy of the method in a second, larger series of 23 native artery occlusions and 25 bypass graft occlusions. Transluminal angioplasty was performed after thrombolysis in 21 of the arteries and 24 of the bypass grafts. Initial thrombolysis was observed in all artery occlusions and all but one bypass graft occlusion with an average time for pulsed-spray lysis of 65 +/- 28 min in native arteries and 93 +/- 38 min in bypass grafts. Recanalization with improvement in symptoms or distal pulses after thrombolysis and angioplasty was achieved in 74% of treated arterial occlusions and 92% of treated graft occlusions. Of the 15 arteries that were recanalized and did not require adjunctive surgery, seven remained patent at 3-28 months follow-up. Nine of 23 recanalized bypass grafts required early adjunctive surgery. Of the nine synthetic and five saphenous vein grafts successfully recanalized and not requiring surgical revision, the mean patency was 4.3 +/- 3.1 months and 3.0 +/- 2.2 months, respectively. Minor complications were seen in 23% of cases. The two major complications (4%) involved one groin hematoma requiring surgery and one episode of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. We conclude that combined pulsed-spray thrombolysis and angioplasty achieve rapid and consistent arterial and graft recanalization with minimal risk. The method offers a favorable alternative to standard thrombolytic therapy of arterial occlusions. In occluded synthetic and vein bypass grafts, the technique is sometimes beneficial, either alone or combined with surgical revision.\r"

Stenosis of the subclavian vein can significantly compromise this venous outflow. The development of such subclavian vein stenoses has been associated with the prior placement of temporary subclavian vein dialysis catheters. We evaluated the importance of preoperative detection of these stenoses before placement of a permanent vascular-access graft in the upper extremity. Upper extremity venography was performed before placement of a permanent vascular-access graft in 43 patients. A total of 62 extremities were evaluated. A 40% prevalence of moderate or severe subclavian vein stenosis was found in patients with prior or existing temporary dialysis catheters in the subclavian vein. No stenoses were found in patients without a history of dialysis catheters in the subclavian vein. This difference in the prevalence of subclavian vein stenosis is statistically significant (p less than .001). In no case was the stenosis suspected clinically. Before placement of a permanent vascular-access graft, the subclavian vein should be evaluated in all patients with a history of a temporary dialysis catheter in the subclavian vein. The use of sites other than the subclavian vein for temporary dialysis is strongly encouraged.\r"

  ".W": "The fate of rejected manuscripts that were originally submitted to the American Journal of Roentgenology (AJR) during the first 5 months of 1986 was investigated to learn whether, when, and where they had been published. AJR, a peer-reviewed journal of diagnostic radiology with a circulation of over 21,000, annually publishes about 500 papers and receives over 11,500 citations. MEDLINE searches conducted 45 to 54 months after the dates of rejection by AJR located 162 (64%) published papers out of a consecutive series of 254 manuscripts rejected by AJR, including 69% of the rejected major papers and 62% of the rejected case reports. The papers had been published in 30 different radiologic and 27 different nonradiologic journals. Most of these journals published fewer papers, had smaller circulations, and had lower impact factors (a ratio of citations received to papers published) than AJR does. The mean time lapse between rejection by AJR and publication in other journals was 15 months. The delay in publication was greater for papers published in nonradiologic and foreign journals than for papers published in radiologic and American journals. The results of this study indicate that rejection of a manuscript by a peer-reviewed journal such as AJR delays but by no means precludes publication. At least 82% of the major papers and 70% of the case reports that are submitted to AJR are eventually published, either in AJR or elsewhere. Because a scientific paper represents not only many hours of writing and manuscript preparation but also a great investment of research time and resources, authors are reluctant to abandon rejected manuscripts. In the majority of cases, submission to other journals gains acceptance and publication.\r"

A more rapid development of QRS changes has been reported in patients treated with thrombolytic agents. Patients with strongly suspected acute myocardial infarction (AMI) included in a placebo-controlled trial of 100 mg of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) were monitored for 24 hours with continuous, on-line vectorcardiography. The magnitude of the QRS vector changes correlated with infarct size estimated by the maximal value of lactate dehydrogenase-1 (r = 0.69, p less than 0.001) as well as with left ventricular ejection fraction 30 days after randomization (r = 0.49, p less than 0.001). Treatment with intravenous rt-PA limited total QRS vector change but the QRS vector changes observed occurred more rapidly and reached a plateau 131 minutes earlier in patients treated with rt-PA than in those receiving placebo (p less than 0.01). A certain pattern of highly variable ST vector magnitude was identified and was associated with higher maximal lactate dehydrogenase-1 values (23 +/- 13 vs 14 +/- 10 mu kat/liter, p less than 0.001) and a tendency to higher 1-year mortality (24 vs 9%, p = 0.08) than in patients without this pattern. In patients with this pattern, rt-PA did not affect maximal lactate dehydrogenase-1, time to maximal creatine kinase and final magnitude of QRS vector change.\r"

Fourteen (11 with atrial flutter and 3 with atrial fibrillation) had clinical evidence of congestive heart failure (CHF). Conversion to sinus rhythm was successful in 39 patients. The mean ANP concentration in the entire group decreased after cardioversion from 38 +/- 4 to 17 +/- 2 pmol/liter (p less than 0.001). In the subgroup with CHF, the ANP level, which was not significantly higher than that in the group without CHF, decreased from 47 +/- 8 to 19 +/- 3 pmol/liter (p less than 0.01). Neither mode of cardioversion (spontaneous 1, pharmacologic 2 and direct-current countershock 36) nor associated CHF influenced ANP response to cardioversion. One patient with atrial flutter and \"failed cardioversion\" had unchanged ANP level. The decrease after cardioversion in ANP concentration correlated with its control level (r = 0.88, p less than 0.001) but not with the decrease in heart rate. The ANP level in patients with atrial fibrillation was 45 +/- 9 vs 38 +/- 5 pmol/liter in those with atrial flutter (difference not significant). Arrhythmia duration, left atrial size, and ventricular rate or arterial blood pressure did not correlate with ANP concentration in any subgroup. It is concluded that (1) the ANP level is elevated comparably in patients with both atrial flutter and fibrillation regardless of the presence or absence of CHF; and (2) the level decreases, independent of the mode of cardioversion or presence of CHF, promptly after successful cardioversion.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether dilated cardiomyopathy, myocarditis or cardiac transplantation affect the relation between plasma immunoreactive atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and cardiac filling pressures, right atrial plasma ANF concentration, pulmonary arterial wedge pressure and right atrial pressure were measured in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 48), dilated cardiomyopathy secondary to myocarditis (n = 20) and prior cardiac transplantation (n = 34). ANF level significantly correlated with both pulmonary arterial wedge and right atrial pressures in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy; however, the presence or absence of myocarditis did not significantly alter these relations (p = 0.88 and p = 0.33 for interaction terms, respectively). For the combined group the ANF-pulmonary arterial wedge pressure relation had a slope of 8.1 pg/ml/mm Hg (95% confidence interval (CI), 5.4 to 10.8; p = 0.0001) and the ANF-right atrial pressure relation a slope of 13.6 pg/ml/mm Hg (CI, 8.5 to 18.7; p = 0.0001). Receiver operator curve analysis identified an optimal dividing point of ANF 150 pg/ml with 100% (CI, 72 to 100%) of patients with right atrial pressure greater than or equal to 8 mm Hg having ANF greater than or equal to 150 pg/ml, but only 56% (CI, 42 to 69%) with pressure less than 8 mm Hg having ANF less than 150 pg/ml. Unlike the patients with cardiomyopathy (with or without myocarditis), cardiac transplant recipients displayed no correlation between ANF level and either pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (p = 0.50) or right atrial pressure (p = 0.29) despite similarly elevated ANF concentrations (mean +/- standard deviation 168 (83) pg/ml in transplant patients versus 185 (114) pg/ml in cardiomyopathy patients). It is concluded that left and right intracardiac pressures are important determinants of circulating ANF level unaffected by inflammation in patients with cardiomyopathy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ages ranged from 1 month to 7 years; there were 26 boys and 21 girls. Fourteen of the subjects with Down syndrome who had an exaggerated thyroid-stimulating hormone response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation had two or more annual follow-up tests. The remaining 33 subjects who only underwent one thyrotropin-releasing hormone test were compared with 22 age-matched controls (11 boys and 11 girls). Mean basal thyroxine 4 and triiodothyronine 3 values were in the normal ranges. All thyroid antibody titers were negative. Mean basal thyroid-stimulating hormone levels of subjects with Down syndrome were significantly higher than those of controls for all ages, even though there was a decline in thyroid-stimulating hormone levels in both groups. Peak thyroid-stimulating hormone response levels were significantly greater in the subjects with Down syndrome than in the controls. Longitudinal study of the 14 children with Down syndrome with an exaggerated thyroid-stimulating hormone response showed that the response remained exaggerated until the third year of life, when it declined to normal levels. Thyroid dysfunction during the growth spurt of infancy or delayed maturation of the hypothalamic pituitary thyroid axis are proposed mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "Adenotin is a low affinity adenosine binding protein that has amino terminal homology with mammalian and avian stress proteins. Human placental adenotin was solubilized and reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles with an overall yield of 30%. The properties of adenotin in vesicles were similar to the native membranes as follows: association has a Kobs of 0.61 +/- 0.03 minute-1; equilibrium is reached in approximately 15 minutes; and the first order dissociation constant is 5.0 +/- 0.3 minute-1. Displacement analysis reveals an agonist potency order and Ki values as follows: N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine, 0.35 microM; 2-chloroadenosine, 1.5 microM; R-phenylisopropyladenosine, greater than 1000 microM. The addition of 100 microM 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate did not decrease binding of 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) at 37 degrees C or 4 degrees C but did decrease the IC50 for PC12 and JAR cell membrane agonist binding from 9.9 to 3.3 microM and increase the binding to 150-211% of the control value at 37 degrees C. The latter studies at 37 degrees C showed high variability. Using binding sites reconstituted into vesicles and gel filtration chromatography and agonist related guanine nucleotide release, the authors investigated whether these changes were related to an interaction between adenotin and a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein. No evidence for such an interaction was found. These data suggest that adenotin retains its binding properties when reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles. The function of this low affinity adenosine binding site remains to be discovered. However, the reconstitution of adenotin into phospholipid vesicles provides a method to study its function.\r"

Her premature menopause was thought to be due to the severity of her liver disease, but her iron overload also could have contributed to gonadotrophin deficiency. She underwent liver transplantation and 5 months later, she experienced return of menstrual function. The distinction between hepatitis as a cause of iron loading, hemochromatosis as a cause of hepatic inflammation, the small influence of alcohol on increased iron stores, and other features of her history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation are discussed.\r"

In the first set of seven experiments, the authors found that venous blood oxygen fell as core temperature rose. Intraperitoneal injection of 20 ml of the oxygen carrying fluorocarbon (perfluorotributylamine, FC-43) emulsion in three of the animals shifted the curve to the right improving venous oxygen content (p less than 0.1). In the second series of experiments, a catheter was placed in the carotid artery. This catheter was attached to a pressure transducer for continuous recording of blood pressure and heart rate. Periodic blood samples were removed for measurement of blood gases, pH, and lactate. Four of the animals received 20 ml of isotonic saline, three received 20 ml of FC-43 emulsion both given intraperitoneally, and four served as controls. In the control group, there was an increase in systolic blood pressure and heart rate which peaked at a colon temperature of 42 degrees C, followed by cardiovascular collapse and death around 43 degrees C. Arterial PO2 (corrected for temperature) remained relatively constant up to 42 degrees C, and then fell. The arterial PCO2 rose sharply when the core temperature exceeded 43 degrees C. Arterial lactate content began to increase at 42 degrees C and above 43 degrees C was 2.5 fold elevated. Isotonic saline provided circulatory support but did not change the hypoxia or mixed acidosis from CO2 and lactate above 43 degrees C. FC-43 emulsion decreased hypoxia and improved circulatory performance but was associated with a mild respiratory alkalosis as arterial PCO2 fell.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The injury rate in this study was 1.97/100 hours of play. Before the tournament, the participants' history was taken, and during the week of participation, records were kept of every player who presented with an injury. Players ranged in age from 17 to 60 and competed in five age/gender groups. Females had an injury rate of 2.3 and males had an injury rate of 1.7. The highest injury rate was seen in the men's open division, ages 17 to 35 (2.7), and the lowest rate was seen in the men's Golden Masters, ages 46 and up (1.5). Seventy-nine percent of the injuries occurred during the tournament and 21% were considered to be chronic injuries with an acute exacerbation. The upper extremities accounted for 20% of the injuries. The ankle (17.6%), low back (14.2%), and knee (11%) were the most common injury sites. Strains (36%) and sprains (28%) were the most frequent types of injury. Only eight (5.2%) injuries resulted in more than 5 days of time loss. Two of these injuries involved the knee and two others required surgery. It is likely that in studies relying upon retrospective methods, fewer of the less severe injuries are found, thereby leading to an overestimation of the percentages of knee and ankle injuries and the proportion of severe injuries. The clinician contemplating providing care for a high-level tournament should expect a preponderance of minor injuries occurring in a variety of anatomical locations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Recreational sports injuries are expensive to society. Prevention of such injuries must be a major public health goal. In a previous retrospective study, base sliding was found to be responsible for 71% of recreational softball injuries. Because most injuries occurred during rapid deceleration against stationary bases, quick-release (break-away) bases were evaluated as a means to modify this mechanism of injury. In a prospective study, 633 softball games were played on a break-away base fields and 627 games were played on stationary base fields. Forty-five sliding injuries occurred on the stationary base diamonds (1 injury for every 13.9 games) and only two sliding injuries occurred on the break-away fields (1 injury for every 316.5 games). The medical costs for injuries on the stationary base fields was 79 times greater than that on the break-away fields. In a 1035 game follow-up study performed on all fields equipped with break-away bases, two sliding injuries occurred (1 injury for every 517.5 games). Installing break-away bases in fields used by recreational leagues would achieve a significant reduction of serious softball injuries (98%) and, therefore, should be mandatory. Based on our findings, the Centers for Disease Control has estimated 1.7 million injuries would be prevented nationally per year, saving $2.0 billion per year nationally in acute medical care costs.\r"

Gamma IFN in 72-hour culture supernatants was measured using a solid phase radioimmunoassay. Maximum production in allergic patients occurred between 25 and 50 micrograms/mL of mite antigen. Both spontaneous and antigen-stimulated levels were highest in the group of mite-allergic patients compared with nonallergic patients or normal controls. Gamma IFN production was lower in a group of mite-allergic patients on immunotherapy compared with the nonimmunotherapy group. Treatment with even small doses of oral corticosteroids completely obliterated both spontaneous and stimulated gamma IFN production. These results indicate that this whole blood assay coupled with a lymphokine radioimmunoassay is a convenient, rapid, and sensitive method for measuring cell-mediated immunity to allergens and responses to IT or drug treatment that can be easily adapted to testing large number of patients.\r"

In contrast, the responses to GTP, Gpp(NH)p (a GTP analogue), sodium fluoride, and forskolin (a direct stimulator of the catalytic unit) were similar between the two groups. These results suggest that impairment of the stimulatory GTP binding protein or the catalytic unit is not the major cause of beta adrenergic hyporesponsiveness in asthma, and that hyporesponsiveness may be due to other mechanisms in the hormone-sensitive adenylate cyclase system.\r"

  ".W": "Central to several current theories of the etiology of Parkinson's disease is the premise that the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system degenerates with normal aging. Much of the evidence for this assertion has come from postmortem neurochemical studies. We have used L-6-[18F] fluoro-Dopa and positron emission tomography in 26 healthy volunteers (age range, 27-76 years) to examine striatal and frontal cortical tracer uptake. Data have been analyzed by using a graphical approach to calculate an influx constant (Ki) for L-6-[18F]fluoro-Dopa uptake into the caudate, putamen, and medial frontal cortex of each subject. In the population studied, there was no decline in Ki with age for any of these structures. A series of physiological measurements made on the older subjects also showed few significant changes with age. The positron emission tomographic findings demonstrate preservation of nigrostriatal dopaminergic function in normal aging. The pathological process causing Parkinson's disease may operate closer to the time of presentation than has been suggested.\r"

  ".W": "An in vitro chemostat system in which Pseudomonas aeruginosa can be cultivated at a slow growth rate and under iron limitation conditions was used to study the susceptibilities of sessile bacteria of mucoid and nonmucoid P. aeruginosa strains to tobramycin and piperacillin. Planktonic cells of both mucoid and nonmucoid P. aeruginosa strains were susceptible to tobramycin and piperacillin. None of the cells was found to be viable after 2 h of exposure to 200 micrograms of piperacillin plus 10 micrograms of tobramycin per ml. Young sessile bacteria were slightly more resistant to piperacillin or tobramycin than the planktonic cells were. However, eradication of young sessile bacteria could be achieved with a combination of piperacillin and tobramycin. None of these young biofilm bacteria were found to be viable after a 2-h exposure to 200 micrograms of piperacillin plus 10 micrograms of tobramycin per ml. Old sessile bacteria were very resistant to these antibiotics. Eradication of old sessile bacteria could not be achieved with either tobramycin (200 micrograms/ml) or piperacillin (200 micrograms/ml) alone. Combination of higher concentrations of tobramycin with piperacillin resulted in an enhancement of killing of the old sessile bacteria. Exposure of old sessile bacteria to 200 micrograms of piperacillin plus 100 micrograms of tobramycin per ml resulted in the reduction of the viable count to approximately 0.02%. The data suggest that the eradication of biofilm-associated infections is best carried out as early as possible. Enhanced activities against the sessile bacteria were achieved when higher concentrations of aminoglycosides were combined with beta-lactam antibiotics.\r"

  ".W": "Dideoxynucleosides (zidovudine[AZT], dideoxycytidine[ddC], and dideoxyinosine[ddI]) are promising new agents for the management of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infections. In light of recent data demonstrating defects in the polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) bactericidal activity of HIV-1-infected patients and since many chemotherapeutic agents affect PMN function, we examined their effects on the function of PMNs from both healthy and HIV-1-infected individuals in vitro. AZT (0.1 to 25 microM), ddC (0.01 to 1 microM), and ddI (0.2 to 50 microM) had no effect on viability, chemotaxis to N-fromylmethionyl leucyl phenylalanine, phagocytosis of Candida albicans or Staphylococcus aureus, or superoxide production following stimulation by N-formylmethionyl leucyl phenylalanine. Killing of C. albicans was not affected by AZT but was enhanced by 0.1 and 1 microM ddc (a 1 microM, killing was 26.0 +/- 2.02% compared with 17.0 +/- 0.73% for controls: P = 0.006) and 0.2 to 50 microM ddI (at 10 microM, killing was 25.0 +/- 0.68% compared with 17.8 +/- 0.91% for controls; P = 0.002). Killing of S. aureus was unchanged by AZT and ddC but was significantly enhanced by ddI at 0.2 to 20 microM (at 2 microM, killing was 71.2 +/- 5.57% compared with 51.4 +/- 6.29% for controls; P = 0.0045). In addition, the preexisting defective bactericidal capacity of PMNs from HIV-1-infected patients was enhanced by ddI (P less than 0.025). Potential enhancement by these dideoxynucleosides of certain PMN functions of HIV-1-infected patients deserves further study.\r"

  ".U": "91136186\r", 
  ".W": "A mutant with decreased susceptibility to imipenem (IpR) was selected in vitro from a susceptible clinical isolate of Listeria monocytogenes (IpS). IpR exhibited decreased susceptibility to penicillin G (4 x MIC) and imipenem (16 x MIC) and increased susceptibility to cefotaxime (0.25 x MIC). Electrophoretic profiles of membrane proteins and penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) were identical in the two strains; each strain had five PBPs with molecular masses of ca. 97, 83.3, 81, 77.1, and 42.6 kilodaltons. A decreased affinity of PBP 3 for penicillin G and imipenem (10-fold) was observed in IpR. In contrast, the affinity of PBP 3 for cefotaxime in IpR was increased twofold and correlated with the decreased MIC of this drug. From these findings and competition experiments with different beta-lactam antibiotics, we conclude that the alteration of PBP 3 is responsible for the decreased susceptibility of IpR to penicillin and imipenem and that PBP 3 might be an essential target of beta-lactam antibiotics in L. monocytogenes.\r"

  ".W": "A new type of norfloxacin-resistant mutant of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO was isolated. This mutant showed cross resistance to imipenem and chloramphenicol and hypersusceptibility to beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics. The new norfloxacin resistance gene nfxC was mapped near catA (46 min) on the PAO chromosome. Norfloxacin accumulation was decreased in the nfxC mutant; furthermore, the rate of imipenem diffusion through the outer membrane of the nfxC mutant was lower than that of the parent strain. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of outer membrane proteins showed a decrease of a 46-kilodalton protein and an increase of a 50-kilodalton protein in the nfxC mutant. We conclude the nfxC is a new norfloxacin resistance gene that affects outer membrane permeability to quinolones and other antimicrobial agents.\r"

In contrast to the related fungicidal antibiotics nystatin and amphotericin B, which show no activity against bacteria, faeriefungin showed bactericidal activity against all species of gram-positive bacteria examined. MICs for these species ranged from 8 to 64 micrograms/ml, and the MIC for 90% of the isolates tested was 32 micrograms/ml. Isolates of some fastidious gram-negative species, including Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae, were slightly susceptible to faeriefungin, with MICs ranging from 16 to 128 micrograms/ml, but all members of the families Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonadaceae, with the exception of Pseudomonas cepacia, were completely resistant to faeriefungin at the concentrations tested. Faeriefungin is also active against fungi, nematodes, and mosquito larvae. The mode of action of faeriefungin against both bacteria and fungi is under investigation.\r"
