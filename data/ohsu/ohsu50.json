  ".W": "In a prospective study of hospitalized patients referred to a psychiatry consultation service, 46 patients were referred for a presumed diagnosis of depression because crying was a prominent symptom. Psychiatric consultation determined that 20% had a psychiatric disorder only, 33% had a neurological disorder only, 43% had both psychiatric and neurological disorders, and 4% had a previously undescribed entity, \"essential\" crying. The most common neurological disorder in these crying patients was bilateral hemispheric dysfunction associated with dementia or delirium; the most common psychiatric disorder was major depression. Effective therapy for patients who cry depends on proper identification of the cause of crying.\r"

Comparisons were made with a group of soldiers who had fought in the same battles but had not been treated for this reaction. A dramatically higher percentage of soldiers with combat stress reaction (59%) than of soldiers without combat stress reaction (16%) developed posttraumatic stress disorder. Age was significantly associated with posttraumatic stress disorder. The authors discuss the differential quality of posttraumatic stress disorder among both groups as well as the factors facilitating recovery.\r"

They demonstrate more errors of omission, difficulties with time and number of concepts, and occasional misinterpretations of others' actions. Children's testimony can be influenced by an overly authoritative or ingratiating attorney stance, an attorney's preconceived notions, age-inappropriate questions, and the child's limited attention span. Children may be helped or harmed by testifying. The risk of further traumatization can be minimized through the judge's use of discretionary power, inclusion of professionals trained in child development in the investigative and court process, and use of videotaping or one-way screens.\r"

Her history, as it unfolded during analysis, suggested a form of atypical depression linked to a neurochemical abnormality, which appeared to be related to her reluctance to take the emotional risk involved in examining transference phenomena. The analysis was modified by a trial of phenelzine. Changes within the analysis and in the patient's private life after the drug trial ended support the hypothesis that her affective vulnerability had inhibited her ability to engage in analysis of transference before the administration of the drug.\r"

Fifty percent of the patients had mitral valve prolapse according to both cardiac auscultation and echocardiography. Twenty-six percent of the women had some thyroid abnormality; 17% had thyroid microsomal antibodies. There was no apparent relationship between mitral valve prolapse and thyroid abnormalities. These observations suggest that panic attacks, mitral valve prolapse, and autoimmune thyroid disorders are associated.\r"

The authors describe the development and validation of Cambodian, Laotian, and Vietnamese versions of the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25. This brief, simple, and reliable instrument is well received by refugee patients, offers an effective screening method for the psychiatric symptoms of anxiety and depression, and is especially helpful for evaluating trauma victims.\r"

  ".U": "87182138\r", 
  ".W": "We examined the relationship of machine-estimated nicotine yield by cigarette brand with the level of cigarette consumption and two biochemical measures of smoke exposure (expired-air carbon monoxide and plasma thiocyanate) in a large, population-based sample of smokers (N = 713). The lower the nicotine yield of the cigarette, the greater the number of cigarettes smoked per day. Prior to adjusting for number of cigarettes smoked per day, nicotine yield was not related to the actual measures of smoke exposure. Smokers of ultralow-yield cigarettes had laboratory tests of smoke exposure which were not significantly different from those of smokers of higher-yield brands. Only after adjustment for number of cigarettes smoked per day did nicotine yield become significantly related to expired-air carbon monoxide and to plasma thiocyanate. In multivariate analysis, the number of cigarettes smoked per day accounted for 28 per cent and 22 per cent of the variance in observed expired-air carbon monoxide and plasma thiocyanate levels, respectively, whereas nicotine yield accounted for only 1 per cent and 2 per cent of the variance, respectively. The relative lack of an effect of nicotine yield on the biochemical measure appears to be due to the fact that smokers of lower nicotine brands smoked more cigarettes per day, thereby compensating for reduced delivery of smoke products. Our data do not support the concept that ultralow-yield cigarettes are less hazardous than others. Machine estimates suggesting low nicotine yield underrepresent actual human consumption of harmful cigarette constituents.\r"

  ".W": "Sera from 4,652 children whose blood was submitted to the New York City Department of Health for lead analysis were tested for antibodies to Toxocara canis using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Standardized to the age distribution of the study population, T. canis seropositivity (inverse titers greater than or equal to 16) was 5.7 per cent in males and 5.1 per cent in females. T. canis antibody titers and lead exposures as measured by Centers for Disease Control lead classes were positively correlated. Children who were seropositive to T. canis (cases) were compared to seronegatives (controls) matched on age (+/- 6 months), sex, time-of-screening (+/- 3 months) and CDC lead class. Logistic regression analysis of 155 case-control pairs demonstrated elevated relative risks (RRs) for geophagia (RR = 3.14; 95% CI = 1.75, 5.64) and having had a litter of puppies in the home (RR = 5.22; 95% CI = 1.63, 16.71). Compared to controls, cases had increased eosinophil counts, serum immunoglobulin E concentrations, and anti-hemagglutinin-A titers. Small deficits in cases compared to controls were found in performance on several neuropsychological tests after adjustment for potential confounders including case-control differences in race, socioeconomic status, and current blood lead concentrations. The study thus confirmed that T. canis infection is common in urban children and suggested that infection may be associated with adverse neuropsychological effects.\r"

  ".W": "We studied British general practitioners' use of ambulatory resources to determine whether the quantities of different resources used were related to each other, and whether these quantities were associated with their personal characteristics. Rates of laboratory requests, referrals for specialty opinion, prescriptions, and visits per patient per year were examined for 21 physicians in seven practices over one year. Physicians who more frequently saw their patients referred and prescribed for them more often and ordered more tests, once the number of years they had practiced was taken into account. Doctors who ordered more tests referred their patients more frequently, regardless of how often they saw them. Doctors longer in practice saw and prescribed for their patients more frequently. Resource use was not related to other personal characteristics we studied. Greater frequency of patient-physician contact appears to increase costs not only through use of more professional time but also through greater use of other ambulatory resources. Attention to the use of only one type of resource may result in a distorted picture of how physicians care for their patients and the costs that such care incurs.\r"

There was a clustering of cases in an office that was air cooled by a dedicated cooling tower separate from the remainder of the building. A high concentration of live L. Pneumophila cells in the cooling tower was quantified. Airborne spread via settle plates placed along the air intake system and within the office was demonstrated. Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 antigen was found in the urine of two cases, and identical monoclonal antibody reactivity patterns of isolates from all sources was observed. Difficulty was experienced in eliminating the organism from the tower.\r"

Cases of acute gastro-intestinal disease (AGID) occurring among 29,272 inhabitants were reported through physicians, pharmacists, and primary school teachers. A loglinear model identified fecal streptococcus (FS) as the best predictor; the presence of fecal coliforms enhanced the effect of FS. The total bacteria count and the total coliforms had no independent contributions. A threshold analysis suggested that any level of indicator bacteria above zero was associated with an excess of AGID.\r"

Households with shallow well or surface water sources had an odds ratio (OR) for giardiasis of 2.1 (95% confidence interval (95%CI) 1.3-3.2) compared with households with drilled well or municipal water supply. Other observed risks include family member in day care program (OR 2.2 95%CI 1.3-3.7) and family member with diagnosed giardiasis (OR 17, 95%CI 7.4-37). Previously reported risks such as travel out of country (OR 3.2, 95%CI 1.5-7.2) and camping (OR 1.7, 95%CI 0.9-3.2) were also observed. Virtually no giardiasis risk was observed associated with report of dog or barnyard animal proximity. Control for confounding and adjustment for recall and non-response bias does not materially alter the risk estimates. We suggest that shallow well or surface household water source is an important and previously unrecognized giardiasis risk factor.\r"

Initial levels of triceps skinfold thickness (TRSF) and Rohrer index (weight/height3) were moderately predictive of subsequent levels: r = 0.54 and 0.67, respectively. However, TRSF and Rohrer index tended to track most strongly in Black females (r = 0.64 and 0.72) and less well in both White females (r = 0.45 and 0.57) and preschool children (r = 0.45 and 0.54). Based on elevated levels of TRSF or Rohrer index, children were classified as obese or overweight, respectively. Of the 222 children who were initially above the 85th percentile for TRSF, 43 per cent remained obese after eight years. Persistence of overweight was slightly greater at follow-up, with 50 per cent of initially overweight children staying above the 85th percentile for Rohrer index. Severe, initial obesity/overweight (greater than 95th percentile) and consecutively elevated levels increased the probability of remaining obese/overweight. Results indicate that moderate, juvenile-onset obesity is malleable, but that the child who is extremely obese over consecutive examinations is likely to become an obese adult.\r"

One year later, Massachusetts increased drunk driving penalties, particularly for repeat offenders and intoxicated drivers involved in fatal crashes. In Maine, single-vehicle nighttime fatal crashes declined 22 per cent the year before passage of the law, and 33 per cent the year after. Maine's rates returned to pre-law levels by the third post-law year. Prior to Massachusetts' new law, single-vehicle nighttime and overall fatal crashes there also declined 20% and 22%, whereas after this law fatal crash rates did not decline further compared with the pre-law year or other New England states. Pre- and post-law surveys indicate that both laws were followed by some increases in public perceptions that drunk drivers stopped by police would be arrested, convicted, and receive automatic penalties. But, few believed it was very likely that drunk drivers would be stopped. For only two of three years studied after Maine's law did more people there report decisions not to drive because they had drunk too much. In Massachusetts, reported driving after heavy drinking declined as much the year before as the three years after its law.\r"

While no effect of spouse cigarette smoking was found among current or former smokers, never smokers married to smokers had about a two-fold increased risk of lung cancer. Lung cancer risk in never smokers also increased with duration of exposure to a smoking spouse, but not with increasing number of cigarettes smoked per day by the spouse. Our findings are consistent with previous reports of elevated risk for lung cancer among never smokers living with a spouse who smokes cigarettes.\r"

The largest proportional increase of new users occurred for prescribed psychoactive drugs. Alcohol showed the most persistence of use, followed by cigarettes and marijuana. As the cohort ages, those who continue to use illicit drugs actively do so at lower levels of intensity than at younger ages. For each drug class, the persistence of use is strongly related to earlier intensity of involvement. By age 29, men have accumulated almost twice as many months of use of illicit drugs as women.\r"

The rate of war-related deaths among Nicaraguans now exceeds that of the United States citizens in either the Vietnam War or World War II. Forty-two of the 84 documented war-related casualties among Nicaraguan health workers have been deaths. This high case fatality rate reflects the targeting of health workers by contra troops. The number of staff and services of the public medical system decreased by approximately 10 per cent from 1983 to 1985. Population movements, the establishment of new settlements, and war-related destruction of the primary health infrastructure are associated with recent epidemics of malaria, dengue, measles, and leishmaniasis. The estimated rate of infant mortality in Nicaragua, which had declined from 120 per 1,000 in 1978 to 76/1,000 live births in 1983, has since shown no further decline. Internationally mandated protections enjoyed by civilians and health workers during times of war do not appear to operate in this so-called \"low intensity\" conflict. Further declines in infant mortality, prevention of epidemics, and improvement in other health indicators will likely await the cessation of military hostilities.\r"

Patients at risk for these tumors are usually more than 50 years of age with vague complaints such as weight loss, pain, abdominal fullness, and fatigue. They should undergo complete evaluation centered around exhaustive radiographic studies and liberal use of endoscopy.\r"

An abdominal mass (53 percent, p less than 0.05) and fever (81 percent, p less than 0.01) were most frequently documented in patients with Crohn's disease, whereas a positive result on fecal occult blood testing (77 percent, p less than 0.025) was common in those with malignant perforations. Otherwise, clinical and laboratory manifestations, including radiographic evidence of free air, were inconstant. The overall mortality rate was 29 percent, with 65 (86 percent) of the patients undergoing operation. Survival was independent of diagnostic delay (p greater than 0.10). In general, despite various causes and delays in diagnosis, resection and primary anastomosis remains an effective treatment for perforation of the small bowel.\r"

Ten telescoped intestinal valves were uniformly created in dogs. A tolerance test to barium reflux was performed before the animals were sacrificed 16 weeks postoperatively, which yielded various barium tolerance values. Statistical analysis revealed that the differences in barium tolerance values in the uniformly constructed valves were closely related to the proportion of the enteric plexuses which contained ganglion cells with normal shapes (r = 0.97, p less than 0.001) and their intestinal segment coverage (r = 0.94, p less than 0.001), but no correlation was found between barium tolerance and the thickness of the valvular musculature (r = 0.04) or the length of the artificial valve (r = 0.39). The results in this study suggest that the intact enteric plexuses play an important role in modulating the competency of the telescoped intestinal valve.\r"

In addition, the deterioration of patients while being treated conservatively, or the presence of severe acute pancreatitis preoperatively, were not predictive of the finding of hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis at operation. In a significant proportion of patients with severe pancreatitis, the diagnosis of pancreatitis was first made at laparotomy. More use should be made of the newer investigative methods to better identify any complications which may have occurred and the necessity for operative intervention.\r"

One hundred twenty-six had undergone a bypass operation (Group I) and 48, a potentially curative resection (Group II). The two groups were divided into the following three risk groups according to the postoperative course: D, patients who died during the first postoperative month; C, patients with postoperative complications; and U, patients with an uneventful course. Preoperative weight loss, duration of jaundice, serum bilirubin level, total protein level, and age of every patient were collected and transformed into a three-score ordinal scale. Stepwise discriminant analysis of these data enabled us to correctly classify 88 percent of the patients who underwent palliative operations and 83 percent of those who had pancreatic resection. This method is useful in identifying the risk group for a single patient using individual preoperative variables. It may, moreover, suggest the most suitable treatment for each patient with pancreatic cancer.\r"

Our program stressed centralization of care in a hernia clinic; early operation of patients at risk of incarceration; optimization of underlying systemic disorders by consultative services; operation under local anesthesia; preoperative, operative, and postoperative protocol; and continuity of care by senior personnel. Over a 4 year period, we have performed 241 abdominal herniorrhaphies in patients over 65 years of age (median age 71.5 years old) who exhibited an 84 percent incidence of significant preoperative systemic disorders. Since the inception of our program, our rate of emergent operation has decreased significantly from 7 percent to 2 percent (chi-square less than or equal to 0.05). Our rate of systemic complications after elective operation was 1.2 percent and 0 after emergent operation. These data are statistically better than those reported in the literature (chi-square less than or equal to 0.05). These results suggest that the creation of a hernia clinic significantly improves the care of herniated patients.\r"

Concentrations of bile acids were determined by gas chromatography and mucosal specimens were obtained by endoscopic biopsy. The total bile acid concentration and all of the individual fractional bile acid levels, whether free or conjugated, were significantly higher in the Billroth II group than in the other two groups. The amount of gastric aspirate was also highest in the Billroth II group. Endoscopic biopsy revealed glandular dysplasia to be predominantly in the Billroth II group.

A new segment of polytetrafluoroethylene graft is anastomosed to the axillary vein, and then to the old graft segment. This technique was employed in six patients over a 12 month period, with a 24 month graft patency rate of 84 percent. The advantage over a new access graft is immediate hemodialysis through a puncture of the preserved arterial limb of the polytetrafluoroethylene graft.\r"

A highly specific radioimmunoassay (N-carboxymethylnormorphine RIA) was used to measure unchanged morphine in plasma in six normal subjects and in eight cirrhotic patients with hypoalbuminemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and prolonged prothrombin time. All subjects received a single intravenous bolus of morphine hydrochloride (0.1 mg/kg). Peripheral blood samples were collected at frequent intervals from 2 min to 36 hr after injection. In cirrhotic patients as compared with normal subjects, terminal half-life of unchanged morphine was longer (201 +/- 39 vs 111 +/- 32 min (mean +/- SD), P less than 0.01) and total body clearance was slower (21 +/- 7.5 vs 33.5 +/- 8 ml X min-1 X kg-1, P less than 0.05). The apparent volume of distribution and the steady-state volume of distribution did not differ in the two groups. In conclusion, cirrhotic patients have a prolonged terminal half-life of unchanged morphine that is attributable to a decrease in total body clearance.\r"

  ".W": "In a randomized prospective controlled study in humans, the metabolism and hepatic effects of a single administration of halothane were compared with enflurane and meperidine. Pre- and postoperative antipyrine pharmacokinetics, intraoperative indocyanine green clearance, liver histology, and postoperative liver function tests were determined in 24 patients undergoing abdominal surgery who were randomly allocated to receive either halothane (0.5%, group I), enflurane (0.8%, group II), or meperidine (group III) as a supplement to a common basal anesthetic regimen consisting of thiopental, nitrous oxide/oxygen/muscle relaxant. In addition, end-tidal concentrations of the volatile reductive metabolites of halothane, chlorodifluoroethylene (CDF), and chlorotrifluoroethane (CTF) were determined in group I patients and serum and urinary inorganic fluoride were determined in both group I and II patients. Indocyanine green clearance was measured before anesthesia (stage I), during basal anesthesia (stage II), in the presence of surgical stimuli (stage III), and after introduction of the selected anesthetic agent (stage IV). CDF and CTF were detectable within 20 min of the start of halothane anesthesia in every patient receiving halothane. Peak serum fluoride concentrations occurred at 2 and 24 hr in the enflurane and halothane groups, respectively, whereas urinary fluoride excretion was elevated postanesthesia in the enflurane group only. There was no difference between the pre- and postoperative disposition of antipyrine in group II or III, but after anesthesia, antipyrine clearance was significantly decreased (P less than 0.02) and plasma half-life increased (P less than 0.05) in group I patients (halothane). Concentrations of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and bilirubin were significantly elevated (P less than 0.5) postoperatively in groups I and II but unchanged from preoperative values in group III patients. Three of the 24 liver biopsies taken at the end of stage IV showed several foci of acute liver cell necrosis; of these, two patients were from group I and one from group II. There were no significant differences in liver cell morphology (P greater than 0.5) in biopsies taken at the end of stage IV compared with biopsies at the end of stage III, from groups I and II. The results of this study show that reductive metabolism of halothane occurs routinely in patients undergoing halothane anesthesia under conditions of normoxia. This may be the cause of the changes in antipyrine clearance after halothane anesthesia.\r"

In the SCh group, mean plasma norepinephrine concentrations, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate significantly increased with onset of fasciculations, whereas in the pretreated patients these variables did not change significantly and no fasciculation was observed.

  ".W": "The effects of succinylcholine (SCh: 2 mg/kg) alone and in combination with lidocaine (4.5 mg/kg in two increments) on muscle oxygen consumption (VO2) and blood flow (MBF) in normal and denervated gastrocnemius muscle were studied in 18 dogs anesthetized with halothane (0.94%, end tidal) to examine the interactions of both drugs at the neuromuscular junction. In an additional five dogs with normal gastrocnemius muscle, the effects of lidocaine alone on VO2 and MBF were also studied. In normal muscle, VO2 increased as much as 150% with SCh alone, while with the combination of lidocaine and SCh, VO2 remained unchanged. MBF remained unchanged with SCh alone and the combined use of lidocaine and SCh. Neither the VO2 nor MBF was affected by lidocaine alone. In denervated muscle, VO2 increased as much as 304% with SCh alone and MBF increased 115%. With the combined use of SCh and lidocaine the VO2 in denervated muscle increased up to 360% with a 290% increase in MBF. These findings indicate different effects of lidocaine on metabolic and circulatory responses to SCh in normal and in denervated muscles in dogs.\r"

Patients were divided into three groups: group 1 initially received 10 or 15 ml followed by 10 ml of 2% plain mepivacaine at 1-hr intervals; group 2 received 10 or 15 ml followed by 10 ml of epinephrine-containing 2% mepivacaine at 1-hr intervals; group 3 received 10 or 15 ml followed by a constant infusion of 10 ml/hr of epinephrine-containing 2% mepivacaine. There were no significant differences between groups 1 and 2, but the mean blood concentration was slightly lower for the first 3 hr in group 2 than group 1. The mean blood concentration of mepivacaine in group 3 remained significantly lower than the concentrations in groups 1 and 2 from 3.5 to 5 hr. These results demonstrate that the blood concentrations of mepivacaine are not reduced by the addition of epinephrine to mepivacaine solutions when intermittent epidural injections are repeated more than four times at 1-hr intervals, but that blood mepivacaine levels are reduced below levels seen with intermittent injections by the continuous epidural infusion of epinephrine-containing mepivacaine.\r"

  ".W": "Isoflurane has protective properties during experimental global brain ischemia or hypoxia. However, this has not been evaluated in the more common case of focal ischemia, e.g., as caused by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The authors therefore compared the effects of isoflurane, thiopental, and N2O/fentanyl anesthesia on neurologic and neuropathologic outcome in baboons subjected to 6 h of transorbital left MCAO. Prior to MCAO, animals were assigned to one of three groups: Group 1 (n = 7) received isoflurane (in O2/air) in concentrations sufficient to maintain deep burst suppression on the EEG (2.0% +/- 0.5% inspired, mean +/- SD); group 2 (n = 6) received thiopental (O2/air) in doses adequate to maintain similar EEG suppression (3.6 +/- 0.7 g total); and group 3 (n = 6) received 60% N2O/40% O2 and fentanyl (25 micrograms/kg load, 3 micrograms X kg-1 X h-1 infusion). Efforts were made to keep mean arterial pressure (MABP) between approximately 80 and 100 mmHg, using nitroprusside/hydralazine or phenylephrine/metaraminol, with PaCO2 at approximately 30 mmHg. The selected anesthetic was established 45 min before MCAO, was maintained until 1 h after clip removal, and in decreasing concentrations for 5 h. Neurologic status was scored for 7 days and formalin-fixed brains were later sectioned for determination of infarction volume. Six of seven group 1 (isoflurane) animals were hemiplegic, and 7/7 had verified infarctions. By contrast, 4 of 6 group 2 (thiopental) animals were normal, with 2/6 having infarctions. Outcome in group 3 (N2O/fentanyl) was intermediate between groups 1 and 2 (3/6 hemiplegic, 4/6 with infarctions). Differences in the infarction rates between groups 1 and 2 was significant (P less than 0.05), while a similar comparison of neurologic outcome scores achieved a P value of 0.055. Infarctions in group 1 were more hemorrhagic in character than in group 3 (groups 1 and 2 could not be meaningfully compared). These results must be considered in light of differences in MABP during the occlusion period; MABP in group 1 was approximately 80 mm Hg in spite of vasopressor use, while that in group 2 was approximately 100 mmHg (in spite of vasodilators). Nevertheless, they fail to demonstrate any protective value of isoflurane anesthesia, at least when compared with thiopental.\r"

Five conditioned dogs under halothane anesthesia received calcium chloride (4, 8, 12 mg/kg) and calcium gluconate (14, 28, 42 mg/kg) intravenously. Ten children scheduled for burn wound excision and grafting received both calcium chloride (2.5 mg/kg) and calcium gluconate (7.5 mg/kg) injected through a central venous cannula. Ionized calcium was measured at 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 5, and 10 min in the children, and 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, and 45 min in the dogs. The authors conclude that equal elemental calcium doses of calcium gluconate (10%) and calcium chloride (10%) (approximately 3:1), injected over the same period of time, are equivalent in their ability to raise [Ca++] during normocalcemic states in children and dogs; the changes in [Ca++] following calcium administration are short-lived (minutes); rapidity of ionization seems to exclude hepatic metabolism as an important factor in the dissociation of calcium gluconate; and equivalent rises in [Ca++] produced by calcium gluconate or calcium chloride resulted in equivalent cardiovascular effects. The authors feel that either form of calcium salt would be satisfactory if indicated during cardiopulmonary resuscitation or for the treatment of ionized hypocalcemia due to massive blood transfusion.\r"

One hundred and twenty ASA physical status I or II patients scheduled for elective surgery received either 0.06 mg/kg pancuronium or 0.36 mg/kg d-tubocurarine during a thiopental-nitrous oxide-enflurane anesthetic. Train-of-four stimulation was applied every 12 s, and the force of contraction of the adductor pollicis muscle was recorded. When first twitch height had recovered spontaneously to 10% of its initial value, neostigmine (0.005, 0.01, 0.02 or 0.05 mg/kg), pyridostigmine (0.02, 0.04, 0.1, or 0.2 mg/kg), or edrophonium (0.1, 0.2, 0.4 or 1 mg/kg) was injected by random allocation. Recovery was measured 10 min after the injection of the antagonist. First twitch ED50's were 0.013, 0.085, and 0.17 mg/kg after pancuronium, and 0.017, 0.11, and 0.27 mg/kg after d-tubocurarine, for neostigmine, pyridostigmine, and edrophonium, respectively. The ED50 for pyridostigmine and edrophonium obtained after d-tubocurarine was significantly larger (P less than 0.05) than that after pancuronium. The train-of-four dose-response curves were significantly flatter for edrophonium than for the other two agents, indicating a greater ability of edrophonium to antagonize fade at low doses. It is concluded that the potency of reversal agents may be different for different relaxants, and that potency ratios might depend upon the end-point chosen as full neuromuscular recovery.\r"

To define this risk, the authors studied prospectively the breathing patterns of 47 preterm infants less than 60 weeks postconception with pneumocardiograms before and after general inhalational anesthesia. Eighteen infants (37%) had prolonged apnea (greater than 15 s) postoperatively, and an additional seven infants (14%) had short apnea (6-15 s) postoperatively. An infant's risk of prolonged and short postoperative apnea was related to a young postconceptional age (P less than 0.05) and to a history of necrotizing enterocolitis (P less than 0.01). Furthermore, as the postconceptional age of the infant increased, the risk of postoperative apnea decreased proportionately (P less than 0.025). Among the 18 infants with prolonged apnea, 83% experienced multiple apneic episodes. Manual stimulation was required in order for breathing to return in 13 (72%) of the infants. Breathing resumed spontaneously in four (22%) of the infants, and one infant required mechanical ventilation due to repeated prolonged apnea. The first apneic event occurred within 2 h postoperatively in 13 of the infants (72%); the remaining five infants (28%) had their initial apneic episode as late as 12 h after operation. The postoperative time to the last prolonged apneic event was inversely related to the postconceptional age (P less than 0.01, r = -0.70) and extended up to 48 h postoperatively. The preoperative pneumocardiogram was not a reliable test for predicting postoperative apnea (sensitivity 56%, specificity 83%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Nine of these segments exemplified EEG changes during transient anesthetic states or surgical conditions. Epoch-to-epoch variability was computed within frequency bins for all segments, and ANOVA with hierarchal classification was used to determine the length of the EEG segment necessary to identify a statistically significant change in those EEG segments recorded during changing conditions. In 16 segments, the epoch-to-epoch variability with power spectra were computed using 2-s epochs was significantly less than the variability when power spectra were computed using longer epoch lengths. In five segments, no significant difference existed between the variance at 2-s epochs and longer (4-s) epochs. In one case, an EEG containing a burst-suppression pattern, the variability was significantly increased when 2-s epochs were used. Analysis using 2-s epochs also identified changes more rapidly than analysis using any longer epoch length in eight of nine segments, and the differences were clinically significant as well (over 30 s faster when 2-s epochs were used instead of 16-s epochs). These findings suggest the preferability of short epoch lengths when power spectrum analysis is used for intraoperative EEG monitoring.\r"

  ".W": "Intrathecally administered clonidine produces analgesia, but also produces hypotension. To assess the effects of epidural administration, the authors inserted lumbar epidural catheters in seven nonpregnant ewes, and injected, on separate days, clonidine (50-750 mcg), morphine (5-10 mg), and a clonidine-morphine combination (clonidine 150 mcg + morphine 5 mg). Clonidine produced dose-dependent antinociception and sedation, with the lowest maximally effective antinociceptive dose being 300 mcg. Morphine produced less intense antinociception than clonidine, and did not potentiate clonidine's effect. Antinociception, but not sedation, following clonidine injection was reversed by epidural injection of the alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist, idazoxan. Epidurally administered naloxone and prazosin did not reverse clonidine's antinociceptive effect, nor did intravenously administered idazoxan. Epidurally administered clonidine did not decrease blood pressure or heart rate or affect arterial blood gas tensions or spinal cord histology. These data suggest that epidurally administered clonidine produces analgesia by a local, alpha 2-adrenergic mechanism. In sheep, epidurally administered clonidine does not produce hypotension.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of lidocaine on the fetal circulatory responses to asphyxia were evaluated in chronically instrumented pregnant sheep. Twenty-six preparations were studied. Animals were assigned to one of three groups. The animals in group I (N = 10) did not have umbilical cord occluders placed. Lidocaine at 0.1 mg X kg-1 X min-1 was infused to the mother for 180 min. The animals in group II (N = 11) had an umbilical cord occluder, which was inflated to induce fetal asphyxia (PaO2 15 mmHg) for 90 min. Occlusion was then maintained for an additional 180 min while lidocaine at 0.1 mg X kg-1 X min-1 was infused. The animals in group III (N = 5) also had an umbilical cord occluder inflated for 90 min. While occlusion was maintained for an additional 180 min, saline was infused, in place of lidocaine. The infusion rate of lidocaine of 0.1 mg X kg-1 X min-1 over 180 min resulted in a steady-state arterial lidocaine blood concentration in the mother of approximately 2.15 micrograms/ml. Fetal circulatory responses to asphyxia were evaluated before and after maternal infusion of lidocaine or normal saline. Measurements included heart rate, blood pressure, arterial pH, and blood gases. Cardiac output and organ blood flow were determined using the radio-labelled microsphere technique. In general, arterial and tissue lidocaine concentrations in asphyxiated fetuses were higher than those in the nonasphyxiated ones, the differences being significant in the brain, heart, liver, and adrenal glands.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of intravenously administered ephedrine upon uterine artery blood flow velocity (UBFV) in the gravid guinea pig subjected to terbutaline infusion and acute hemorrhage. Ephedrine, 1.0 mg/kg, was administered intravenously to ten chronically instrumented pregnant guinea pigs near term, before and after intravenous infusion of terbutaline and acute hemorrhage. Before terbutaline and hemorrhage, ephedrine increased maternal mean arterial pressure (MMAP) by 30 +/- 1% (P = .0001) and 17 +/- 1% (P = .0001) at 30 s and at 1 min after injection, respectively; UBFV was decreased by 10 +/- 4% (P less than .01) and 14 +/- 4% (P less than .01) at 1 min and at 90 s after injection, respectively. Infusion of terbutaline (1.5-6.0 ug X kg-1 X min-1) increased maternal heart rate (MHR) by 22 +/- 1% (P = .0001), decreased MMAP by 13 +/- 2% (P = .0001), and decreased UBFV by 24 +/- 3% (P = .0001). During hypotension resulting from acute hemorrhage, ephedrine, 1.0 mg/kg, was superior to placebo in restoring MMAP and UBFV toward the prebleed values. The authors concluded that ephedrine, 1.0 mg/kg, results in a small, transient decrease in UBFV in the normotensive gravid guinea pig. However, ephedrine aids restoration of UBFV in the gravid guinea pig rendered hypotensive by acute hemorrhage during terbutaline infusion.\r"

To further investigate this possibility, 780 patients undergoing anesthesia and surgery were randomly divided into four groups: group I: enflurane/nitrous oxide/oxygen; group II: enflurane/air/oxygen; group III: isoflurane/nitrous oxide/oxygen; and group IV: isoflurane/air/oxygen. The frequency of postoperative nausea and vomiting was ascertained in the recovery room and at 24-h follow-up by blinded observers. Other data collected included gender, age, body mass index, previous history of postoperative nausea and vomiting, and postoperative narcotic use. The authors found no association between the use of nitrous oxide and subsequent development of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Use of the 95% confidence interval allowed the authors to project a maximum potential increase in the frequency of postoperative nausea and vomiting associated with nitrous oxide to be 5.4% with enflurane and 9.7% with isoflurane in the immediate postoperative period. Female gender, younger age, and a previous history of postoperative nausea and vomiting, but not body mass index, were found to be associated with postoperative nausea and vomiting (P less than 0.05). It is concluded that there is no association between the use of nitrous oxide and the development of postoperative nausea and vomiting.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of histamine and curare on cerebral blood flow (CBF) were measured in rats with an intact blood-brain barrier (BBB) and in rats in which the BBB was disrupted by hypertonic urea. Using radioactive microspheres cortical and subcortical CBF were measured in paralyzed ventilated rats anesthetized with 70% N2O, 30% oxygen. Blood gas tensions were controlled by mechanical ventilation. In rats with an intact BBB, neither histamine infusion (10 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1) nor curare (1 and 5 mg/kg) increased CBF. Twenty minutes after the BBB was disrupted by 2 M urea, histamine (10 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1) produced an increase in cortical (180-210 ml X 100 g-1 X min-1) and subcortical CBF (103 to 124 ml X 10 g-1 X min-1). Twenty minutes after BBB disruption, curare also produced a significant increase in cortical CBF (1 mg/kg: 176-201 ml X 100 g-1 X min-1, 5 mg/kg: 190-209 ml X 100 g-1 X min-1). The increases in CBF produced by curare were completely blocked by pretreatment with 30 mg/kg cimetidine, a histamine H2 receptor antagonist, 3 min before curare. The results indicate that curare may produce cerebrovasodilation and increases in CBF by release of histamine and stimulation of central nervous system H2 receptors. These effects occur only when the BBB is disrupted and circulating histamine has access to brain perivascular tissue.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of fentanyl or cardiovascular function, regional distribution of cardiac output, and the dose required for producing anesthesia were studied in ten previously catheterized, newborn lambs. In addition, the effects of fentanyl on cerebral blood flow and oxygen utilization were examined. Fentanyl in cumulative doses as high as 4.4 mg/kg (average plasma levels of 646 +/- 95 ng/ml, maximum plasma level of 862 ng/ml) did not reliably produce anesthesia as assessed by tail and foot clamping, although it did cause profound respiratory depression. With normocapnia maintained by mechanical ventilation, fentanyl did not alter cerebral oxygen delivery or consumption, and the two remained coupled. Fentanyl did not affect cardiac output, heart rate, or mean arterial blood pressure at the highest dose level, nor did it reduce blood flow to specific organ beds, other than the kidney. Thus, the hemodynamic stability seen with fentanyl in the lamb does not occur at the expense of reduced blood flow to organs, such as the gastrointestinal tract or brain, that are particularly vulnerable in the neonate.\r"

The authors used the technique of sonomicrometry in chronically instrumented dogs to measure the length changes occurring in the costal and crural diaphragm during anesthesia. Seven dogs were studied in lateral decubitus; first awake, and then during pentobarbital anesthesia. The end-expiratory length (LFRC) of the crural segment increased gradually and reached a plateau after 30 min of anesthesia. Costal LFRC did not change. The results were similar when the hemidiaphragm under study was placed in a gravity-dependent or in a non-dependent position. In the awake state, variable levels of post-inspiratory or tonic diaphragmatic EMG activity were observed, which disappeared during anesthesia. The authors conclude that anesthesia induces a 7-8% increase in end-expiratory length of the crural, but not of the costal, diaphragm. This selective adjustment is not due to a pressure gradient effect, but is compatible with a loss of tone in the crural diaphragm.\r"

They measured histamine release directly in the in vitro preparation and measured the wheal size resulting from intradermal injection in vivo. Both in vivo and in vitro testing revealed dose-related histamine release with d-tubocurarine and atracurium (P less than .05). Vecuronium did not release histamine at any concentration. It was concluded that the infant foreskin model is a valid predictor of histamine release by muscle relaxants in vivo, and can provide valuable information about mechanisms of histamine release by these, and perhaps others, drugs used in anesthetic practice.\r"

  ".W": "A polarographic multiwire surface electrode was used for measurement of local oxygen partial pressure (pO2) on human brain cortex during neurosurgical operations. The two major problems encountered in this application of the electrode involved sterility of the equipment and mounting of the electrode. The described method of sterilization does not alter the electrical properties of the electrode. A special mount was designed to allow free three-dimensional placement of the electrode without exerting pressure on the cortex. Basic results of this technique demonstrated that it is possible to distinguish different pO2 distribution patterns displayed in pO2 histograms for various types of brain tumors and edematous brain tissue. In patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the brain, an increase of tissue pO2 in cortical areas adjacent to the AVM was the result of extirpation of the lesion. The effect of intravenously administered pentoxifylline was studied during extraintracranial bypass operations in patients with cerebrovascular disease. In 7 patients a consistent shift of the pO2 histograms to the right, i.e., to higher pO2 values, could be demonstrated. Mean pO2 values increased statistically significantly by 16 +/- 7 mmHg as early as ten minutes after infusion of pentoxifylline. The rapid improvement of tissue oxygenation of human brain cortex is thought to be the result of an improvement of microcirculation, for other parameters influencing tissue pO2 showed no significant alterations if any.\r"

Measurements of gas exchange across this tissue should be expected to parallel disease activity. Five patients with histologic and/or radiographic evidence of interstitial lung disease were evaluated by serial exercise studies over time with respect to therapy. Preexercise and postexercise values were obtained, for exercise is felt to make these measurements more sensitive to changes in gas transfer. Good correlations were seen in all five patients. Exercise studies are concluded to be of value in patients with interstitial lung disease due to sarcoidosis and may prove to be a sensitive form of follow-up during therapeutic intervention.\r"

Adrenal cortical adenoma is commonly the result of a basophilic tumor of the anterior pituitary that secretes excessive amounts of ACTH. Adrenal medullary hyperplasia (or pheochromocytoma) are clinically hazardous tumors because of their excessive secretion of catecholamines. Combined adrenal cortical adenoma and adrenal medullary hyperplasia of the right adrenal gland has never been described previously.\r"

Yet relatively little is known about endotracheal drug therapy. Plasma lidocaine levels were measured in 23 dogs after the administration of endotracheal lidocaine at a dose of 2 or 4 mg/kg. Endotracheal lidocaine was given either as a dilution with normal saline (1:1 dilution) or undiluted (Group 1, no dilution; Group 2, dilution). Significantly higher plasma lidocaine levels occurred with the dilution group in all the time periods and with either dose of lidocaine (2 or 4 mg/kg) (P less than .001). Mean plasma lidocaine levels (microgram/mL) at five minutes were: (at 2 mg/kg dose) Group 1, 0.64; Group 2, 3.4; and (at 4 mg/kg dose) Group 1, 1.9, Group 2, 4.7 (P less than .001). Arterial blood gases were not significantly different before or after endotracheal drug administration. This study suggests that higher plasma lidocaine levels are achieved and maintained longer when diluted with normal saline than when given undiluted; and higher plasma lidocaine levels can be obtained by dilution without any detrimental effect on respiratory function as measured by arterial blood gases.\r"

Electrical capture occurred in 85 (93%), mechanical capture (pulses) occurred in ten (11%), and a measurable blood pressure occurred in three (3%) of the 91 patients. Despite a high rate of electrical capture, palpable pulses were produced only in 11%, and no patients survived to be discharged from the hospital. There was no difference in the frequency of electrical capture, palpable pulses, or outcome for patients receiving pharmacologic intervention before or after pacing. Likewise there was no difference in the frequency of electrical capture, palpable pulses, or outcome for patients receiving ALS therapy within or after ten minutes of their arrest. Although we found that external cardiac pacing was easily used in the prehospital setting, pacing did not result in any increase in survival in cardiac arrest patients.\r"

Forty-two cases of dysbaric air embolism (DAE) were identified on the basis of clinical criteria, accounting for 18% of the patients undergoing recompression treatment for diving-related disorders during this four-year period. In 22 patients (52%), DAE was part of a dysbarism syndrome that involved one or more forms of decompression sickness and/or in which DAE could not be differentiated from neurologic decompression sickness. The presenting signs and symptoms varied, with asymmetric multiplegia being the most common finding. Two patients died, giving a case fatality rate of 5% for those who survived until reaching the recompression chamber. Overall, 78% of the cases manifested either complete (61%) or substantial (17%) recovery with recompression and adjunctive medical measures. Traditional concepts of dysbaric cerebral air embolism are not adequate to explain the spectrum of clinical manifestations encountered in this condition.\r"

Twenty patients (50%) manifested evidence of cardiac injury as demonstrated by abnormal ECGs, elevated CPK isoenzymes, or abnormal echocardiograms. Nine (23%) patients had abnormal echocardiograms with findings of pericardial effusions in four, chamber enlargement in three, and echodense areas of the right ventricle in two.

We found that: as compared with healthy nonsmokers, healthy smokers had higher serum ceruloplasmin concentration, similar serum transferrin and AIBC concentration, and lower serum AOA; ceruloplasmin, AIBC, and smoking acted additively, accounting for about 60% of the variability of serum AOA; the impact of AIBC on serum AOA was significantly greater than that of ceruloplasmin; and pulmonary function in the smokers was not significantly related to serum AOA, ceruloplasmin, or AIBC. Our findings suggest that: serum AIBC has a greater role in serum AOA than has previously been attributed to it; suppression of the AOA of serum constituent(s) other than those we measured may account for the significantly lower serum AOA in healthy smokers than in healthy nonsmokers; and normal air flow in healthy cigarette smokers is unrelated to serum AOA, ceruloplasmin, or AIBC concentration.\r"

This relationship between FEV1 \"slope\" and \"level\" has been called a \"horse-racing effect\" and is the basis for the widely accepted concept that detecting a low FEV1 will predict a rapid decline in FEV1 and the development of clinically significant COPD. However, when both age and smoking habits were taken into account, the effect persisted only in male smokers. Even in them, it was dependent on the inclusion of part of the delta FEV1 in calculation of the mean FEV1 value. While neither a low initial FEV1/Ht3 nor percent predicted FEV1 significantly predicted a subsequent rapid fall in FEV1, presumably because of regression toward the mean, other initial spirometric variables proved better predictors, at least among male smokers. In them, a low FEV1/FVC ratio on entry was almost uniformly associated with a high rate of decline in FEV1. This was not seen in ex-smokers with similar initial spirometric findings. Also, delta FEV1 could not be predicted with any precision in women regardless of their smoking status. The findings strongly support the concept that detection of early airway disease by spirometric screening will identify those male smokers who are likely to develop clinically significant illness if they continue to smoke and that smoking cessation, even at this point, can markedly improve the prognosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In both men and women, there were excessive rates of decline in FEV1 in smokers, at least in those smoking more than 10 cigarettes per day. The excess decline of smokers was age dependent, particularly in men, with much of the excess loss of function occurring between 50 and 70 yr of age. Effects of smoking on delta FEV1, observed minus expected delta FEV1 and observed minus expected percent delta FEV1, were greater in men than in women even when controlled for current cigarette dose. Ex-smokers show delta FEV1 values similar to those of nonsmokers. In subjects younger than 35 yr of age, quitting smoking during follow-up was associated with an actual increase in FEV1. In men 50 to 70 yr of age, smoking cessation early in the study appeared to lead to a relatively prompt return to normal rates of functional decline. Thus, the findings suggest relatively prompt beneficial effect of smoking cessation even in late middle age.\r"

On the basis of data from these subjects, reference equations were derived for DL, alveolar volume (VA), and DL/VA.

Because a significant proportion of women, but not of men, had low hematocrit values, an effect of hematocrit on DL and DL/VA could be demonstrated only in females in this population sample.\r"

We reviewed history, chest radiographs, pulmonary function studies, and exercise tests. The workers were 59.9 +/- 9.5 (mean +/- SD) yr of age and their first asbestos exposure had been 34.4 +/- 10 yr prior to the study; 63% were smokers, 19% were ex-smokers, and 18% were nonsmokers. Chest radiographs were normal in 4%, showed only pleural disease in 35%, only parenchymal diseases in 5%, and pleuroparenchymal disease in 56%. Restrictive pulmonary function abnormalities were present in 25% of the workers, and obstructive abnormalities were present in 27%. Because the impairment of one of several organ systems (i.e., ventilatory, cardiac, pulmonary vascular, or peripheral circulatory) may limit exercise performance, we designed an exercise test score in an attempt to identify the system causing the limitation. No abnormal limitation was detectable in half (49.2%) of the subjects. Only 26% had a ventilatory limitation, which was much more frequent in smokers (32%) than in nonsmokers (9%) (p less than 0.05). Unexpectedly, rather more (37%) had a cardiac rather than a ventilatory limitation. We conclude that the complaint of dyspnea in these asbestos-exposed workers was usually not caused by a ventilatory dysfunction.\r"

The challenges were separated by 60 min when the FEV1 values had returned to within 10% of baseline values. Four patients were refractory to exercise-induced asthma (EIA) after an initial exercise task, and these patients also demonstrated a refractory period to hypertonic-saline-induced bronchoconstriction after an initial hypertonic challenge. Furthermore, hypertonic challenge produced refractoriness to EIA in the patients, and exercise rendered them refractory to hypertonic-saline-induced asthma. Six subjects were not refractory to EIA after an initial exercise task, and they were also not rendered refractory by an initial hypertonic challenge to asthma induced by hypertonic saline or by exercise. Histamine-induced bronchoconstriction in the 4 refractory subjects did not induce a refractory period to EIA, indicating that the refractory periods developing after hypertonic saline challenge and exercise were not due to the bronchoconstriction alone. Inhalation of isotonic saline in the same volumes as those used for hypertonic challenges did not induce a refractory period, indicating that the refractory period caused by the inhalation of hypertonic saline was not due to the volumes of fluid inhaled. Thus, exercise and aerosolized hypertonic saline induced refractoriness interchangeably, suggesting that airway hypertonicity and exercise produced a refractory period through a very similar, if not identical, final common pathway.\r"

Mucous hypersecretion and airway obstruction (a sustained increase in pulmonary resistance) developed in 4 dogs exposed to 50 ppm SO2. Histologic examination of the dogs' airways demonstrated epithelial thickening and an increase in size of the mucous glands. No inflammatory cell infiltration of the airways was noted and, in addition, responsiveness to inhaled histamine and methacholine did not change. The increase in lung resistance correlated with increase in mucous gland volume and airway wall thickening, but not with any change in airway responsiveness. Dogs exposed to 15 ppm SO2 showed minimal histologic and physiologic changes compared with control dogs. Previous work with a similar model of chronic bronchitis, using higher level SO2 exposure, has demonstrated an association of airway inflammation with decreased responsiveness to inhaled bronchoconstrictors. In the present study, with a lower exposure level to SO2 (50 versus 200 ppm), we found similar histologic findings associated with airway obstruction, but in the absence of airway inflammation, responsiveness to inhaled bronchoconstrictors was unchanged. This supports the theory that chronic airway inflammation may be associated with decreased responsiveness to inhaled bronchoconstrictors. This contrasts with the hyperresponsiveness induced by acute exposure to irritant gases noted by others.\r"

A principal constituent of eosinophil granules is the major basic protein (MBP). Previous light and electron microscopic observations have indicated that guinea pig and human MBP produce detachment of tracheal epithelial cells and cessation of ciliary activity. To quantitate the damage, selected regions of the epithelial surface of rabbit tracheal explants were videotaped before and after treatment with human MBP. Tapes were analyzed for ciliary beat frequency and the extent of zones along the epithelial surface displaying ciliary activity. The MBP at 0.1 mg/ml reduced beat frequency and significantly reduced the measured zones of ciliary activity. Also, MBP at 0.7 mg/ml significantly reduced beat frequency and the measured zone of ciliary activity on the epithelial surface. Beat frequency was lowered by 27% within 10 min, with only 1% further decrease by 60 min. The zones of ciliary activity on the epithelium were continuously decreased throughout the 60 min to 29% of the initially active zone. To examine whether MBP was capable of direct inhibition of ciliary activity, isolated porcine tracheal ciliary axonemes, the structural organelles of individual cilia, were treated with human MBP. Concentrations above 67 micrograms/ml of MBP were completely inhibitory to reactivated isolated axonemes, 67 micrograms/ml stopped activity within 10 min, and 27 micrograms/ml stopped activity within 15 min. Pretreatment of isolated axonemes with increasing concentrations of MBP resulted in decreasing ATPase activity. These effects were not attributable to pH alteration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The airway edema that develops in guinea pigs after exposure to toluene diisocyanate (TDI) requires the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). To determine whether this airway edema is mediated by the release of hydrogen peroxide from PMN, we treated animals intravenously with catalase bound to polyethylene glycol and examined the extravasation of Evans blue dye into the tracheal wall after exposure to air or 3 ppm TDI for 1 h. Catalase (25,000, 100,000, and 300,000 IU/kg) caused a dose-dependent inhibition of the TDI-induced increase in dye extravasation. However, treatment with catalase, inactivated at the peroxide binding site with 3-aminotriazole, inhibited dye extravasation after exposure to TDI as effectively as the equimolar 100,000 IU/kg dose of active catalase. Injection of polyethylene glycol alone was without effect. Dose-dependent decreases in extravascular migration of PMN and in circulating PMN also were noted after catalase treatment. These results suggest that the catalase preparations used in these studies inhibited the PMN-dependent airway edema by an effect other than hydrogen peroxide scavenging. Examination of this and other commercially available catalase preparations revealed trace concentrations of endotoxin at levels that could be responsible for the observed effects on PMN function. Treatment of animals with doses of Escherichia coli endotoxin similar to those inadvertantly administered to the catalase-treated groups (0.1 ng/kg to 100 ng/kg, intravenously) inhibited TDI-induced extravasation of Evans blue dye in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that contaminating endotoxin may contribute to some of the protective effects of preparations of catalase observed in previous studies of vascular permeability.\r"

Rabbits were challenged intratracheally with live pneumococci, capsular polysaccharide, purified cell walls, or cell wall subcomponents. Leukocytosis and elevation of protein concentration was quantitated in bronchial lavage fluid during the first 24 h after challenge. Of the pneumococcal surface components tested, cell wall preparations had the highest specific activity in inducing inflammation; abnormalities in bronchial lavage fluid cytochemistry appeared rapidly and in a dose-dependent manner. Cell wall building blocks and the products of penicillin-induced hydrolysis of the cell wall were also highly inflammatory, indicating that inflammation can be generated by disruption of the cell wall during lysis of bacteria by beta-lactam antibiotics. Administration of inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism suggested that inhibition of the lipoxygenase pathway reduced inflammation associated with cell walls. We propose that pulmonary inflammation during pneumococcal pneumonia arises in large part from the interaction of the bacterial cell wall with complement and noncomplement-mediated host defenses.\r"

Diffuse interstitial infiltrates were seen on chest radiographs in 5 and bibasilar atelectasis in 1. Pulmonary function tests showed mild to moderate restriction in 4 and decreased diffusing capacity in 4. The initial pathologic interpretation in 3 patients suggested a variant of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and these patients received corticosteroids because of this diagnosis. All patients have remained stable or improved after a mean follow-up of 3.2 yr. Respiratory bronchiolitis should be recognized as an uncommon cause of chronic interstitial lung disease. It must be separated from the other diseases in this category because of marked differences in treatment and prognosis.\r"

The main determinant of TPAIIFR was the mixed venous AI concentration. Administration of oxygen for 30 min led to a small increase in TPAIIFR in the majority of patients. This increase could not be accounted for by changes in mixed venous AI. There was no correlation between serum angiotensin-converting enzyme levels and either the TPAIIFR or the systemic arterial AII concentrations.\r"

In a laboratory on Denali (Mt. McKinley) at 4,400 m (PB = 440 mm Hg), we used a double-blind, randomized, three-way crossover design. The HVR was measured during the waking state. Periodic breathing and SAO2% were measured during 3-h sleep studies. Almitrine and acetazolamide both increased SaO2% during sleep, although almitrine increased periodic breathing, whereas acetazolamide decreased periodic breathing. The HVR (delta VE/delta SaO2%) was doubled with almitrine (p less than 0.05), but unchanged with acetazolamide. The HVR was positively related to periodic breathing (p less than 0.05). We conclude that periodic breathing during sleep at high altitude is related to the hypoxic ventilatory response, and that acetazolamide is a superior agent to almitrine for ameliorating periodic breathing.\r"

These hypotheses were tested during periodic breathing induced by mild hypoxemia in NREM sleep in 9 healthy male subjects. In 6 subjects during periodic breathing as central respiratory neural activity decreased, the tonic and phasic EMG activity of the upper airway inspiratory muscles decreased at a rate greater than that of the chest wall EMG activity. When the ratio of upper airway to chest wall EMG activity decreased below a critical level, which was reproducible across subjects, upper airway inspiratory resistance increased hyperbolically. Resistance at peak inspiratory flow increased from 4.10 +/- 0.97 (mean +/- SEM) to 48.70 +/- 21.00 cmH2O/L/s as tidal volume decreased from 0.79 +/- 0.12 to 0.20 +/- 0.02 L during periodic breathing in these subjects. In the 3 remaining subjects, the ratio of the upper airway to chest wall EMG activity did not decrease below the critical level as the activity of both muscle groups decreased during periodic breathing, and upper airway resistance did not increase. We conclude that within the confines of this study the nonlinear activation of upper airway and chest wall inspiratory muscles contributed to fluctuations in upper airway resistance observed during periodic breathing in sleep.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ventilatory and mouth occlusion pressure (P0.1) responses to hypercapnia and hypoxia were measured with standard rebreathing techniques. In a randomized, single-blind fashion, we studied the effect of 15 min of hyperoxia or air on transcutaneous carbon dioxide (PtcCO2), CO2 production (VCO2), total minute ventilation (VE), and calculated dead space to tidal volume ratio (VD/VT). With O2, the PtcCO2 (p less than 0.01) and VD/VT (p less than 0.02) increased. The change in PtcCO2 with O2 was not significantly related to the indices of respiratory drive, nor to the baseline PtcCO2 or SaO2, but was related to the FEV1 (p less than 0.05). The O2 caused a slight decrease in mean VE and mean VCO2, but the effects in individual patients were variable. Both substantial increases or decreases in VE (delta VE) occurred, but these were accompanied by changes in VCO2 (delta VCO2) in the same direction. The effect of changes in VE on PaCO2 is shown to be almost completely cancelled by the concomitant changes in VCO2. Thus, the major portion of the change in PaCO2 was due to changes in VD/VT. We conclude that hyperoxic-induced hypercapnia is primarily due to impairment in gas exchange rather than to depression of ventilation. A reduced FEV1 appears to be a significant risk factor, whereas indices of respiratory drive are not likely to play a major role.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with severe COPD are frequently flow-limited during expiration at rest. When expiratory flow is at its maximum, application of negative pressure at the mouth should accentuate dynamic compression downstream from the flow-limiting segment (FLS) without substantially affecting flow or pressure upstream. The purpose of this study was to determine the ventilatory response to such intervention and to determine its effect on respiratory sensation. Such responses should reflect the effect of airway receptors downstream from the FLS. Nine patients with severe COPD (FEV1 +/- SE = 27 +/- 3% predicted) breathed into a closed-circuit apparatus that incorporated a rolling-seal spirometer. The spirometer was fitted with a linear actuator that caused mouth pressure to become negative in proportion to expiratory flow (expiratory assistance, EA). Ventilatory responses were measured during 4 min of EA (-9.7 cm H2O/L/s) and were compared with those during control periods (4 min each) before and after this (C1 and C2). Sense of breathing effort was assessed at 1-min intervals by asking the subject to point to a category scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being minimal effort and 5 indicating that breathing was very difficult. There were small but significant (p less than 0.05) decreases in TI (mean +/- SE, -0.2 +/- 0.05 s) and TE (-0.3 +/- 0.07 s), with increases in breathing frequency (+2.25 +/- 0.7) and ventilation (+1.5 +/- 0.6 L/min). No significant changes were observed in tidal volume or end-expiratory volume. The EA caused a highly significant (p less than 0.001) increase in the sense of breathing effort.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After allowing time for learning, the maximum sustainable inspiratory pressure (SIPmax) was 46% greater than SIP. We therefore developed a test of ventilatory muscle performance that used progressive 2-minute increments in threshold inspiratory resistance. Subjects started with a low load and continued to breathe until they could no longer inspire. With increasing load there was a fall in minute ventilation and time of inspiration, and an increase in oxygen consumption and PETCO2. Power was greatest when loads were 55 to 75% of maximum static inspiratory pressure (MIP). The inspiratory mouth pressure corresponding to the greatest load achieved (PmPeak) was the same in trained and naive subjects. PmPeak/MIP was reproducible and was not influenced by fixing subjects' breathing frequency. We concluded that tests of ventilatory muscle performance should allow subjects to develop breathing strategies to handle high inspiratory loads. Two-minute incremental loading is a simple assessment of ventilatory muscle performance and the test may have clinical application where reproducibility is necessary.\r"

We found significant differences in cum I-O and delta wt between survivors and nonsurvivors on almost every day. Survivors lost weight and had a significantly lower cum I-O compared with nonsurvivors. Logistic regression was used to determine if delta wt and cum I-O could predict survival. Patients who lost 3 kg or more weight had a much higher survival than did those who gained 3 kg or more weight (67 and 0%, respectively, on Day 14). Similar results were obtained using comparably low and high values for cum I-O. The logistic regression equations demonstrated that weight loss and low cumulative I-O correlated with improved survival. Although cause and effect relationships are difficult to determine from these types of analyses, they can be used to formulate prospective studies and predict survival in patients.\r"

Proteins derived from the actions of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems may potentiate these inflammatory reactions as well as influence the subsequent repair process. However, the factors regulating fibrin formation and dissolution in acute pneumonitis have not been defined. In this study, we characterized the procoagulant (PC) and fibrinolytic activities simultaneously present in the alveolar space during the course of acute lung injury induced in rabbits by an intravenous injection of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Within 6 h of PMA injection, this injury was characterized histologically by extensive intra-alveolar fibrin formation and marked accumulation in pulmonary parenchyma of intravenously administered 125I-fibrinogen. Clearance of fibrin ensued over the remainder of the 72-h study period. Normal BAL fluid contained high levels of procoagulant activity which did not vary after the onset of inflammation. The procoagulant activity was attributed to particle-bound tissue thromboplastin as well as other factors of the extrinsic coagulation pathway. There were low levels of plasminogen activator (PA) activity in normal BAL fluid, but the mean activity increased 9.3-fold over control values by 12 h after PMA injection (p less than 0.01). When plasminogen activator activity in BAL fluid was referenced to the concomitant procoagulant activity, this ratio (PA/PC) increased 17.8-fold over controls, peaking 24 h after PMA injection (p less than 0.01). The levels of both procoagulant and plasminogen activator activities associated with alveolar macrophages were stable during the study period. Compared to alveolar macrophages, granulocytes expressed similar levels of plasminogen activator but negligible procoagulant activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

NK can limit pulmonary metastases in animal models and could be important mediators of tumor defense in human lung. Previous studies in humans have suggested, however, that pulmonary NK cells obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) are functionally inert. We purified lymphocytes from human lung tissue and compared the NK activity of these cells with lymphocytes purified from peripheral blood. The activity of NK cells obtained from minced whole lung specimens was comparable to that found in peripheral blood. Monoclonal antibodies to 2 markers found on peripheral blood large granular lymphocytes (LGL) were utilized to determine the phenotype of pulmonary NK cells. Lymphocytes expressing Leu 11b were responsible for pulmonary NK activity as all NK function was abrogated by pretreatment with anti-Leu 11b and complement. In contrast, lymphocytes expressing Leu 7 had little NK activity. Although the frequency of lymphocytes expressing Leu 7 or Leu 11 in blood was comparable, there were significantly more (p less than 0.001) Leu 7+ lymphocytes in the lung than Leu 11+ cells. Immunofluorescent staining of lung tissue demonstrated that LGL expressing Leu 11 were confined largely to the lung interstitium, whereas LGL expressing Leu 7 were frequently located in alveoli and larger airways. These findings suggest that NK function is present in the human lung and that it is compartmentalized with the NK-active Leu 11+ lymphocytes located primarily in the lung interstitium.\r"

Our results indicate that neutrophil-derived O2 metabolites contribute to perfusate TXB2 elevations and lung weight gains but not PAP increases in isolated perfused rat lungs.\r"

  ".W": "Severe emphysema is reported in a patient with Salla disease, a recessively inherited disorder of sialic acid metabolism that leads to intralysosomal accumulation of free sialic acid in cells of various tissues. The disease is among the rare genetically determined diseases typical of the Finnish population. The patient was 41 yr old at the time of his death. He had been a nonsmoker with no evidence of alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. Chest radiographs suggested that severe emphysema had developed during the last 4.5 yr of his life. Emphysema was also documented by postmortem radiography, which showed it to be located mainly in the lower lobes. The uneven distribution of tissue destruction within individual lobules, as shown in histologic sections, indicated a centrilobular type of emphysema, which was probably related to the basic storage disease. Thus, some involvement of storage lysosomes in altering the functioning of pulmonary macrophages is suspected. The serum proteinase inhibitory capacity as well as the alpha-1-antitrypsin phenotypes were normal among 5 brothers and sisters of the patient, 1 of whom was affected by the disease. The exact pathogenetic mechanism(s) for the rapid development of severe emphysema in this rare case of Salla disease remains unclear.\r"

The patients ranged in age from 15 to 69 years (mean, 37) and were predominantly male (14 patients) and white (only 1 was of oriental descent). Fifteen patients had significant functional limitation, which was usually caused by exertional dyspnea and fatigue. Several electrocardiographic patterns were identified in the study group, but only 4 of these patients showed \"giant\" negative T waves. Only 3 patients had a morphologic expression of apical hypertrophy that closely resembled that described in Japanese patients--that is, hypertrophy that was particularly localized and confined to the true left ventricular apex (2 of these patients had giant negative T waves). Hence, hypertrophy located predominantly in the distal left ventricle was uncommon in our primarily North American patient population with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Most of our patients showed morphologic and clinical features that were dissimilar to those found previously in Japanese patients with apical hypertrophy.\r"

Seventy-one persons were found to be heterozygous for protein S deficiency, which is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Venous thrombotic events occurred in 39 patients (55%) and were recurrent in 77%. Most symptomatic patients had various combinations of deep venous thrombosis (74%), superficial thrombophlebitis (72%), and pulmonary embolism (38%), either in succession or simultaneously. On five occasions thrombosis was found at unusual sites, like the axillary, mesenteric, and cerebral veins. The age at the first thrombotic event ranged from 15 to 68 years (mean, 28 years), and at age 35 the probability to be still free of thrombosis was only 32%. Fifty-six percent of the thrombotic events were not preceded by a precipitating condition. In these respects protein S deficiency is similar to protein C deficiency.\r"

In addition, bacteriuria was significantly associated with incontinence of bladder (96% of continuous, 66% of intermittent, and 25% of nonbacteriuric; p less than 0.001) and bowel (52%, 39%, and 5.5%, respectively; p less than 0.002). At 6 years of follow-up there were no differences in survival among the three groups. Urinary tract infection caused or contributed to only two (2.9%) deaths.

The procedure resulted in a significant reduction in the mean (+/-SD) aortic valve gradient, from 47 +/- 13 to 32 +/- 12 mm Hg (change, -32%, p less than 0.01), and a significant increase in the mean area of the aortic valve, from 0.64 +/- 0.12 to 0.90 +/- 0.17 cm2 (change, +40%, p less than 0.001). Blood loss from the femoral puncture site was the only major procedural complication. At a mean follow-up of 2 months after the procedure, all patients were alive and dyspnea had improved by two New York Heart Association functional classes in four patients and by one functional class in two patients. A significant short-term increase in aortic valve area and alleviation in symptoms can be achieved safely by percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty in elderly patients with severe calcific aortic stenosis who are at high risk for surgical complications.\r"

  ".W": "Study Objective: To test the hypothesis that patients with asthma who develop cough and wheezing after the use of beclomethasone aerosol would have a better tolerance for triamcinolone aerosol. Design: Randomized, double-blinded, crossover trial. Setting: Pulmonary function laboratory. Patients: Volunteer sample of 24 patients attending an asthma clinic who had developed cough, with or without wheezing, after inhaling beclomethasone aerosol. All patients completed the study. Interventions: Aerosols were used in habitual manufacturers' preparations and canisters, but both were administered in three puffs through the delivery system used for triamcinolone. The preparations differed in drug (beclomethasone dipropionate or triamcinolone acetonide), propellant (trichloromonofluoromethane and dichlorodifluoromethane, or dichlorodifluoromethane alone, respectively) and dispersant (oleic acid or dehydrated alcohol, respectively). Patients inhaled three puffs of one aerosol on one day and three of the other on the next. Measurements and Main Results: Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was measured before and after each aerosol application. The FEV1 decreased a mean of 17.7% from baseline after inhalation of beclomethasone, and 0.8% after triamcinolone (difference, 16.9; 95% confidence limits, 12.36 to 21.34; p less than 0.001). Coughs were counted after each puff. The mean number of coughs after beclomethasone aerosol inhalation was 35.8, and after triamcinolone, 0.5 (difference, 35.3; 95% confidence limits, 22.62 to 47.98, p less than 0.001). Conclusions: Asthmatic patients who are unable to inhale beclomethasone aerosol due to cough or wheezing can inhale triamcinolone aerosol without difficulty. Our investigation does not determine the exact cause of the coughing and wheezing with the beclomethasone aerosol, but we suspect the dispersant as the source.\r"

All patients survived with little fetal wastage; all had preeclampsia. Histologic findings included cholestasis, hepatocellular necrosis, and inflammation, as well as microvesicular fat. Histologic findings from biopsy specimens of four of seven patients were initially misinterpreted as hepatitis. This disorder may have both a broad clinical and histologic spectrum; it is probably not rare but often misdiagnosed, perhaps as viral hepatitis. The concurrence of this disorder with toxemia of pregnancy suggests that these entities may be pathophysiologically related.\r"

The major implications of organ donation for the primary physician are reviewed. Patients who die will more frequently be eligible as cornea, skin, or bone donors, but the criteria for both tissue and internal organ donation are reviewed. Ethical issues unique to organ donation and responses of survivors to donation requests are described. If appropriately offered, the opportunity to authorize an anatomic gift can be a source of comfort to survivors while the donation provides the benefits of transplantation to persons on organ waiting lists.\r"

Finally, the evaluation methods, particularly videolaryngoscopy, may be used for biofeedback purposes to facilitate voice therapy.\r"

  ".U": "87183008\r", 
  ".W": "The postnatal development of the eustachian tube and its surrounding structures (tubal cartilage, tubal gland, tensor veli palatini muscle, and levator veli palatini muscle) was investigated in serial vertical histologic sections from 12 normal temporal bones of individuals whose ages ranged from 39 weeks' gestation to 19 years of age. After projecting tissue sections onto paper and tracing the structures, several measurements were made in order to analyze this development. Findings revealed that the eustachian tube and its accessory structures developed postnatally up to the age of 19 years. The lumen area in a 19-year-old specimen was 4.7 times that of the 1-day-old infant. The development of the tube was greatest in the pharyngeal part. Postnatal development of the eustachian tube appears to be related to growth of the face. The cartilage area in the 19-year-old specimen was 3.6 times that of the 1-day-old infant. The mucosal acinar cells were predominant in infants but no greater than the number of serous acinar cells by the age of 19 years. The areas of the tensor and levator veli palatini muscles in a 19-year-old specimen were 5.1 and 11.1 times, respectively, those of the 1-day-old infant. This preliminary study reports the postnatal development of the eustachian tube and its accessory structures, a subject never thoroughly investigated to date. However, because of the limited number of cases available, further investigation of a greater number of cases should be performed so that the relationship between tubal development and alterations in function that occur with age can be understood clearly.\r"

In the animal model, eardrum inflammation and negative middle ear pressure mirrored epithelial damage in the eustachian tube and the accumulation of cellular and mucous debris in the tubal lumen. Epithelial damage was greatest in the proximal two thirds of the tube near the nasopharynx, whereas goblet cell metaplasia and increased secretory activity was greatest in the distal, tympanic one third of the tube. These results provide a morphologic correlate to the development of negative middle ear pressure, and perhaps explain the pathologic basis for purulent otitis media during viral respiratory tract infection.\r"

On the basis of our study, we strongly recommend the interposition of a disk of autologous cartilage and perichondrium between the middle ear implant and eardrum when an Al2O3 implant is used.\r"

In conclusion, the ciliary activity at the entrance to the eustachian tube and that more distal to the tube present a similar pattern of reaction to S aureus in an in vitro system. On the other hand, the ciliary activity of the middle ear lining displays a varying pattern of reaction according to the locations within the tympanic cavity.\r"

Overall, amphotericin B and ketoconazole were equally effective. Amphotericin B may have been more effective than ketoconazole for the treatment of pneumonia. Also, five of eight Candida tropicalis infections treated with amphotericin B responded, whereas all eight infections treated with ketoconazole failed to respond (P = 0.03). Response rates for localized fungal infections were similar with both drugs. Ketoconazole should not be used as empiric antifungal therapy at institutions where there is a high frequency of infections caused by Aspergillus spp. or C. tropicalis because this agent lacks activity in vitro against these species.\r"

Killing curve experiments showed that the concentrations of rifabutine and clofazimine needed to kill two log units of M. avium are at least 32 times greater than the concentrations needed to inhibit growth. Little or no killing occurred at concentrations of these antimicrobial agents that are achievable in serum. In contrast, five of seven strains tested were killed by ciprofloxacin at concentrations that can be achieved in serum.

The plasma method involved protein precipitation with acetonitrile and trichloroacetic acid followed by extraction of the acetonitrile into dichloromethane. After centrifugation, the organic phase was discarded, the aqueous solution was injected into a reverse-phase column, and peaks were detected at 280 nm. The urine method involved dilution of a urine sample with sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.25) and direct injection into the high-pressure liquid chromatography system. The assay validation data indicate that the assays for BMY-28142 in plasma and urine were specific, accurate, and reproducible. The analytical methods were applied to the determination of protein binding in human serum and to a pharmacokinetic study in rats. The results of the protein-binding study indicated that BMY-28142 was 16.3% bound to human serum proteins. In the pharmacokinetic study in rats, the maximum level in plasma of 38.7 micrograms/ml was achieved at 2.33 h after administration of a subcutaneous dose of 100 mg/kg. The levels in the plasma then declined with an elimination half-life of about 0.56 h. The mean values for the steady-state volume of distribution and total body clearance were 0.46 liters/kg and 11.9 ml/min per kg, respectively. The 0- to 24-h excretion of intact BMY-28142 in urine accounted for 88.6% of the dose.\r"

Drug resistance was a result of the production of dihydrofolate reductase with a decreased sensitivity to antifolates. By characterization of the partially purified enzyme and by restriction enzyme digestion analysis, the newly found gene was shown to be distinct from the earlier known plasmid-borne resistance genes which express dihydrofolate reductases of types I, II, and III. Cloning of fragments containing the resistance gene and further restriction enzyme digestion analysis showed that this gene was inserted very close to a sulfonamide resistance gene. Evolution of trimethoprim resistance in Sri Lanka thus seems to have taken a different route from that taken in the industrialized world, where transposon Tn7 seems to dominate. The close combination of the new trimethoprim resistance gene with sulfonamide resistance on the plasmids studied would effect an efficient spread of these genes, since trimethoprim has most often been used in combination with a sulfonamide.\r"

At the end of a 30-min intravenous infusion, the mean maximum concentration of drug in serum was 39 micrograms/ml for unchanged Sch 34343 and 49 mu eq/ml for total radioactivity. The mean serum half-lives of Sch 34343 were 0.16 h for the distribution phase and 0.80 h for the elimination phase. The total body clearance of Sch 34343 was 7.52 ml/min per kg, and the mean apparent volume of distribution was 525 ml/kg. Over a 4-day period, mean urinary excretion of radioactivity accounted for 87.9% of the dose, and mean urinary excretion of unchanged Sch 34343 accounted for 23.6% of the dose. The total radioactivity in feces on days 0 to 6 accounted for only 0.8% of the dose. In serum from 0.5 and 1 h, unchanged Sch 34343 represented the major radioactive peak, with negligible amounts of several metabolites. In urine, there were at least six metabolites in addition to Sch 34343. The amount of unchanged Sch 34343 accounted for 33% of radioactivity in samples of urine from 0 to 2 h, 22% in urine from 2 to 4 h, 15% in urine from 4 to 8 h, and 0% in urine from 8 to 12 h.\r"

For 3-day-old animals, the glomerular filtration rate was similar to that measured in control guinea pigs of the same age whose mothers were given saline during the same period of gestation. The same applied to fractional excretion of water, urea, total solutes, Na, K, Ca, and Mg but not to fractional phosphate excretion, which increased significantly in the gentamicin group when compared with the controls (mean +/- standard error, 21.7 +/- 4.9 versus 7.3 +/- 1.8%; P less than 0.05; n = 6 for both). The glomerular volume of the juxtamedullary nephrons diminished by about 40%, and their proximal tubule length decreased by about 20%. The glomerular volume of the superficial nephrons also diminished, by about 30%, but their proximal tubule length did not change. The gentamicin concentration was higher in the renal cortex than in the medulla (13.1 +/- 2.6 versus 5.7 +/- 2.2 micrograms/g [dry wt]; P less than 0.01; n = 6 for each). It decreased significantly from days 3 to 20 in both tissues. No functional impairment of the kidney was found in 10-day-old animals, and normal or even supranormal morphometry of the nephrons was observed in the 20-day-old animals. It is concluded that fetal exposure to gentamicin impairs proximal tubular function in the developing animal and might also adversely affect glomerular and tubular growth. However, both the functional and morphometric impairments of nephrons are transitory.\r"

The most common pathogens were members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (MICs, less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MICs, 0.13 to 2 micrograms/ml), and Enterococcus faecalis (MICs, 0.5 to 2 micrograms/ml). Sixty-eight patients were able to be evaluated for determining efficacy; all responded symptomatically, and all urinary pathogens were eradicated on days 3 to 5 of treatment. Five patients, who were treated for a relatively short duration (2 to 10 days), relapsed 5 to 9 days posttreatment. Six patients became colonized with yeasts during treatment, and seven patients developed bacterial reinfections 5 to 9 days posttreatment. All patients whose infections relapsed or who developed infections with new organisms had neurogenic bladders, structural abnormalities of the genitourinary tract, or urinary catheters. There was no instance of bacteria developing resistance during treatment. Ciprofloxacin probably caused nausea with or without vomiting in 7 of the 83 patients, headache in 3 patients, and mild elevation of hepatic enzymes in 2 patients; other adverse reactions were observed but were probably not drug related. Oral ciprofloxacin was effective and safe for the treatment of serious urinary tract infections caused by a variety of bacterial pathogens.\r"

Four noninfected patients received both a 15-mg/kg (body weight) intravenous dose and a 30-mg/kg intraperitoneal (i.p.) dose. Bioavailability ranged from 0.35 to 0.65 after i.p. administration. i.p. absorption was rapid, with concentrations in serum of 8.8 +/- 6 micrograms/ml noted at 1 h peak values of 30.4 +/- 7 micrograms/ml at 6 h. A slow distribution phase was apparent, with a terminal elimination phase emerging after 12 to 24 h. Vancomycin was eliminated slowly, with a mean total clearance of 5.0 +/- 1.3 ml/min, and concentrations in serum were 7.0 +/- 1.2 micrograms/ml at 168 h. The mean serum half-life was 91.7 +/- 28.1 h, and similar pharmacokinetics were noted after intravenous administration. Subsequently, four patients with catheter-related exit site or tunnel infections received a 30-mg/kg i.p. dose of vancomycin and displayed a similar kinetic pattern. This method of administering vancomycin achieved therapeutic serum and end-dwell dialysate concentrations over a 1-week period, represents a simple, cost-effective therapy which avoids the possibility of infusion-related toxicity, and deserves further investigation in patients with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis.\r"

Cefoperazone reduced the numbers of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria to undetectable levels. At the other extreme, cefoxitin had little effect on the normal flora. Aztreonam markedly reduced the numbers of aerobes, whereas piperacillin had a variable effect on both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. There was extensive overgrowth of enterococci in subjects given cefoxitin or aztreonam, which have little activity against this species, and of yeasts in subjects given cefoperazone or piperacillin. Cefoperazone reached concentrations of 2,727 to 8,840 micrograms/g in the feces, whereas the other agents were generally undetectable. These results show that the new beta-lactam antibiotics produce widely varying effects on the fecal microflora after parenteral administration and that these effects are consistent with the antibacterial and pharmacological properties of the drugs.\r"

A variety of infections were treated, including endocarditis, septic thrombophlebitis, osteomyelitis, pyogenic arthritis, and soft tissue infection. Of 13 infections that could be evaluated in 12 patients, there were 8 clinical cures, 2 improvements, 1 recurrence, and 2 failures. Of the eight patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, seven were clinically cured or improved with teicoplanin therapy. Of the nine patients in whom the bacteriological response to treatment could be fully evaluated, six were cured; there was recurrence of infection in one, and treatment failed in two patients. In vitro testing showed the 13 bacterial isolates (9 S. aureus, 3 S. epidermidis, and 1 group B streptococcus) to be uniformly susceptible to teicoplanin, with MICs ranging from 0.12 to 0.5 microgram/ml. Every isolate was more susceptible in vitro to teicoplanin than to vancomycin. Three of the staphylococcal isolates were resistant to methicillin. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that after an initial drug-accumulation period, a single daily dose adequately maintained the teicoplanin concentrations in serum within therapeutic ranges. Teicoplanin also penetrated well into synovial fluid. The drug was well tolerated by either intravenous or intramuscular administration. The most significant adverse reaction was an urticarial rash which required discontinuation of therapy in one patient; a second patient experienced a modest decrease in high-frequency auditory threshold. Asymptomatic eosinophilia and mild elevation of serum transaminases were noted as well. The results of this study suggest that teicoplanin is a safe and effective new agent for treatment of serious infections caused by gram-positive organisms.\r"

Dis. 155:220-228, 1987) that clindamycin, rifampin, and tetracycline were more efficacious than penicillin in the treatment of fulminant gas gangrene in mice caused by Clostridium perfringens. We hypothesize that antibiotic efficacy correlated with bactericidal or toxin-suppressing properties of these agents. To investigate the possibility that penicillin is only bacteriostatic against C. perfringens, we performed macrobroth dilution MIC and MBC determinations using C. perfringens ATCC 13124. Mean MICs were equal to MBCs for the following antibiotics (micrograms per milliliter): clindamycin, 0.07; tetracycline, 0.05; rifampin, 0.03; metronidazole, 0.69; and penicillin, 0.27. The MIC/MBCs of chloramphenicol were 1.50/3.10 (micrograms/ml). Because antibiotic efficacy did not correlate with bactericidal activity, we measured alpha-toxin activity and found complete suppression of alpha-toxin activity by tetracycline, metronidazole, rifampin, clindamycin, and chloramphenicol at concentrations equal to the MIC. In contrast, alpha-toxin activity persisted at concentrations of penicillin equal to and above the MIC. The dynamics of bacterial killing and kinetics of alpha-toxin production were next studied in log-phase cultures of C. perfringens with antibiotic concentrations 10 times the MIC. Clindamycin, metronidazole, and rifampin all caused rapid reductions in viability, turbidity, and alpha-toxin activity by 15 to 45 min. In contrast, penicillin demonstrated slower bacterial killing, increased turbidity (62.6% of control), and persistent alpha-toxin activity (80% of control values) for 2 h. Tetracycline and chloramphenicol were the least effective in reducing viability; however, the turbidity of cultures did not increase, and alpha-toxin activity was not detectable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One strain of M. mulieris was resistant to erythromycin and josamycin. All were resistant to colistin, cycloserine, nalidixic acid, and neomycin. Tetracycline had variable activity.

All 12 M. curtisii and 1 of 10 M. mulieris strains were resistant to tinidazole. M. curtisii and M. mulieris produced two mutually exclusive clusters of MICs when tested against ampicillin, cefoxitin, cephalothin, moxalactam, alizarin red, Evans blue, and sodium fluoride. Gardnerella vaginalis was more susceptible to Nile blue A than was either M. curtisii or M. mulieris.

  ".W": "The treatment of experimental gas gangrene caused by Clostridium perfringens was investigated by using combinations of antimicrobial agents. This study demonstrated that rifampin, penicillin, metronidazole, and clindamycin were all bactericidal against standard inocula (10(5) to 10(6) CFU). These antimicrobial agents were then administered to mice beginning 30 min after intramuscular injection of 10(9) CFU of C. perfringens type A. The highest doses used produced levels of drug in blood which exceeded the MIC by at least a factor of 40. In addition, other groups of mice received monotherapy at full dose or one-fourth full dose or combination antimicrobial therapy at full or one-fourth full dose. Among the single and combination antimicrobial treatments, metronidazole alone, clindamycin alone, and clindamycin plus penicillin were the most efficacious (P less than 0.05). Although the survival of mice treated with clindamycin plus penicillin was greater than that of mice treated with clindamycin alone, the difference did not reach statistical significance (P greater than 0.05). In contrast, mice treated with a combination of metronidazole and penicillin demonstrated greater mortality than those treated with metronidazole alone (P less than 0.05). In summary, combination antimicrobial therapy of experimental C. perfringens infection did not improve survival compared to that achieved with metronidazole or clindamycin alone, and some combinations significantly reduced survival (P less than 0.05).\r"

  ".W": "The acyclic guanosine analogs R- and S-enantiomers of 9-(3,4-dihydroxybutyl)guanine [(R)- and (S)-DHBG], 9-(4-hydroxybutyl)guanine (HBG), and 9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)guanine (ACV) were examined for their effects on human cytomegalovirus (CMV) replication and on CMV DNA synthesis in cell culture as well as for their ability as triphosphates to interact with CMV DNA polymerase. Production of early CMV antigens was not affected. All analogs inhibited CMV DNA synthesis and late viral antigen synthesis. Primary CMV isolates were less susceptible to all tested analogs than was the laboratory strain CMV Ad.169. The triphosphate of ACV was the most potent inhibitor of CMV DNA polymerase, with an observed Ki of 0.0076 microM. The corresponding Ki values of the triphosphates of (R)-DHBG, (S)-DHBG, and HBG were 3.5, 13.0 and 0.23 microM, respectively. All triphosphates of the analogs given above inhibited CMV DNA polymerase in a competitive manner with respect to dGTP. The triphosphates of the analogs also inhibited reactions when the synthetic template poly(dC)oligo(dG)12-18 was used, whereas no inhibition was observed with poly(dA)oligo(dT)12-18. None of the triphosphate analogs supported DNA synthesis in the absence of dGTP, showing that no analog was an alternative substrate to dGTP.\r"

Most isolates were resistant to trimethoprim, and some were resistant to aztreonam. Most regimens for the empirical treatment of septic episodes in immunocompromised patients are suitable for the treatment of Capnocytophaga spp. infections.\r"
