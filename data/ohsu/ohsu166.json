  ".W": "Airway anesthesia with inhaled aerosolized lidocaine has been associated with increases in minute ventilation (VE) and mean inspiratory flow rate (VT/TI) during CO2 inhalation. However, it is unclear whether these increases are local effects of the anesthesia or systemic effects of absorbed and circulating lidocaine. To evaluate this 20 normal subjects were treated on separate days with aerosolized lidocaine, intravenous lidocaine, aerosolized control solution, or intravenous control solution, and the effects of each treatment on VE and VT/TI were determined and compared during room-air breathing and inhalation of 5% CO2-95% O2. None of the treatments altered VE or VT/TI during room-air breathing. Aerosolized lidocaine produced small (5.9-6.0%) increases in VE and VT/TI during CO2 inhalation, but these effects were not present after intravenous lidocaine despite equivalent lidocaine blood levels. We concluded that the increases in VE and VT/TI after aerosolized lidocaine were local effects of airway anesthesia rather than systemic effects of absorbed and circulating lidocaine.\r"

  ".U": "87108942\r", 
  ".W": "Constant-flow ventilation (CFV) is a ventilatory technique in which physiological blood gases can be maintained in dogs by a constant flow of fresh gas introduced via two catheters placed in the main-stem bronchi (J. Appl. Physiol. 53: 483-489, 1982). High-velocity gas exiting from the catheters can create uneven pressure differences in adjacent lung segments, and these pressure differences could lead to gas flow through collateral channels. To examine this hypothesis, we studied CFV in pigs, animals known to have a high resistance to collateral ventilation. In three pigs we examined steady-state gas exchange, and in six others we studied unsteady gas exchange at three flow rates (20, 35, and 50 l/min) and three catheter positions (0.5, 1.5, and 2.5 cm distal to the tracheal carina). During steady-state runs we were unable to attain normocapnia; the arterial CO2 partial pressure (PaCO2) was approximately 300 Torr at all flow rates and all catheter positions, compared with 20-50 Torr at similar flows and positions in dogs studied previously. The initial unsteady gas-exchange experiments indicated no consistent effect of catheter position or flow rate on the rate of rise of PaCO2. In three other pigs, the rates of rise of PaCO2 were compared with the rates observed with apneic oxygenation (AO). At the maximum flow and deepest position, the rate of rise of PaCO2 was lower during CFV than during AO. These data suggest that flow through collateral channels might be important in producing adequate gas transport during CFV; however, other factors such as airway morphometry and the effects of cardiogenic oscillations may explain the differences between the results in pigs and dogs.\r"

  ".W": "We altered the concentration of plasma proteins in human blood in vitro by adding solutions with [Na+], [K+], and [Cl-] resembling those in normal blood plasma, either protein-free or with a high concentration of human albumin. After equilibrating the samples with a gas containing 5% CO2-12% O2-83% N2 at 37 degrees C, we measured pH, PCO2, and PO2; in separated plasma, we determined the concentrations of total plasma proteins and albumin and of the completely dissociated electrolytes (strong cations Na+, K+, Mg2+ and anions Cl-, citrate3-). With PCO2 nearly constant (mean = 35.5 Torr; coefficient of variation = 0.02), lowering plasma protein concentration produced a metabolic alkalosis, whereas increasing plasma albumin concentration gave rise to a metabolic acidosis. These acid-base disturbances occurred independently of a minor variation in the balance between the sums of strong cations and anions. We quantified the dependence of several acid-base variables in plasma on albumin (or total protein) concentration. Normal plasma proteins are weak nonvolatile acids. Although their concentration is not regulated as part of acid-base homeostasis, hypoproteinemia and hyperalbuminemia per se produce alkalosis and acidosis, respectively.\r"

We analyzed the long-term results in 120 patients who had used the Milwaukee brace and had been followed for at least five years after the completion of treatment. The average age of the patients at the initiation of treatment was twelve years and five months, the average age at the completion of treatment was sixteen years and one month, and the average age at the last follow-up examination was twenty-four years. Of the patients who wore the brace consistently, seventy-six showed improvement in the kyphosis between the initial evaluation and the evaluation at final follow-up, while twenty-four showed worsening and ten were unchanged. Seven of the twenty-four patients who were worse had had surgery before the review for this study. The indication for surgery was a kyphosis of more than 60 degrees that was increasing and was not controlled by the brace. Ten patients were inconsistent in their use of the brace. Two of the ten patients had improvement and eight had worsening of the kyphosis; three of the latter eight had a spinal fusion. This study showed that the Milwaukee brace is usually an effective method of treatment for patients who have Scheuermann kyphosis; however, four of fourteen patients who had an initial kyphosis of more than 74 degrees required a spinal fusion.\r"

  ".W": "This report describes the properties of a neutral protease that was synthesized and secreted into medium by intact cartilaginous growth plate in tissue culture. Bovine cartilaginous growth plate was grown for seven days in tissue culture, during which time the chondrocytes remained viable and metabolically active as determined by quantitation of trypan-blue exclusion and incorporation of 3H-cytidine. Protease activity, assayed by viscometry using proteoglycan monomer from cartilage as a substrate, was absent on day 1 but was present at high levels on days 2 through 5. The protease activity did not require activation and was highest at neutral and alkaline pH. Protease activity was abolished by twenty-millimolar EDTA but was unaffected by pepstatin, iodoacetate, and soybean trypsin inhibitor. In contrast to the high levels of activity of neutral protease that were present in tissue cultures of the intact growth plate, no protease activity could be detected when chondrocytes from the cartilaginous growth plate were grown in cell culture, even after sonication of the cells or activation with aminophenyl mercuric acetate or trypsin. Since hypertrophic chondrocytes probably do not survive the disruption of tissue that is involved in establishing cell cultures, these observations suggest that neutral protease is probably released into the medium by the hypertrophic chondrocytes that are present in the cultures of cartilaginous growth-plate tissue. It appears that the organization of the growth plate in tissue culture, as well as the maturation of proliferating chondrocytes into hypertrophic chondrocytes in tissue culture, may be required for synthesis of the neutral protease and its extracellular secretion by hypertrophic chondrocytes.\r"

We isolated five UDPGT isoforms from solubilized microsomal fractions from liver of inbred Wistar (RHA) rats and congeneic Gunn rats. UDPGT isoform V (elution pH 7.5) from Wistar (RHA) rats is active toward bilirubin and 4'-hydroxydimethylaminoazobenzene. The corresponding isoform from Gunn rat liver was enzymically inactive but exhibited normal elution pH and mobility on NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Mr 53,000), and was recognized by a UDPGT-specific antiserum. UDPGT isoform I (elution pH 8.7) from Wistar (RHA) and Gunn rats was active toward 4-nitrophenol. The isoform from Gunn rat liver had only 10% of normal UDPGT activity, however UDPGT activity increased to normal upon addition of 15 mM diethylnitrosamine in vitro. Isoforms II (elution pH 8.4), III (elution pH 8.0), and IV (elution pH 7.8) from Gunn rats had normal UDPGT activities, except that Isoform IV was inactive toward bilirubin.\r"

The observations in these experiments: demonstrate that consumption of galactose-enriched diets for 3 wk selectively increases 125I-albumin permeation of the same vascular beds affected in diabetic rats and by diabetic vascular disease in humans (i.e., the aorta and vessels in the eye, kidney, sciatic nerve, and new tissue formed in the diabetic milieu); demonstrate that the susceptibility of the vasculature to aldose reductase-linked injury (increased permeability) varies greatly in different tissues; indicate that collagen solubility (crosslinking) changes in galactose-fed rats differ sharply from those in diabetic rats; and provide new evidence that consumption of galactose-enriched diets induces a hypogonadal state in male rats.\r"

The alpha-L-iduronidase levels in these tissues were 0.8-7.4, 26-45, and 6.3-14.9% of the paired donor tissues, respectively. Although iduronidase was present in relatively low levels in the recipients' brains and cerebrospinal fluid at both biopsy times, reduction in brain glycosaminoglycan (GAG) was comparable to that observed in liver. Ultrastructural studies of cells within the transplanted dogs' brains showed less lysosomal distension and storage product than in affected, nontransplanted, littermate controls. The most marked clearing of stored GAG was in cells surrounding blood vessels, but decreased lysosomal storage in neurons and glial cells was also observed. Urinary GAG excretion also decreased to near normal levels by 5 mo posttransplantation.\r"

We now report further enzymatic and immunological characterizations. Both NADH and ferricyanide titrations of complex I activity (measured as NADH-ferricyanide reductase) were distinctly altered in the mitochondria from the patient's tissues. In addition, antisera against complex I immunoprecipitated NADH-ferricyanide reductase from the control but not the patient's mitochondria. However, immunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of complex I polypeptides demonstrated that the majority of the 25 polypeptides comprising complex I were present in the affected mitochondria. A more detailed analysis using subunit selective antisera against the main polypeptides of the iron-protein fragments of complex I revealed a selective absence of the 75- and 13-kD polypeptides. These findings suggest that the underlying basis for this patient's disease was a congenital deficiency of at least two polypeptides comprising the iron-protein fragment of complex I, which resulted in the inability to correctly assemble a functional enzyme complex.\r"

DMCM (1.5-5 mg/kg) increased short-term (1 h) survival in a dose-dependent fashion, with an optimum survival rate more than five times greater than mice receiving pentobarbital alone. Statistically significant increases in long-term (24 h) survival were also observed after both 5 and 10 mg/kg of DMCM (34 and 33%, respectively) compared with animals receiving pentobarbital alone (6%). Two doses of DMCM (5 and 2.5 mg/kg, respectively) administered 55 min apart produced an even greater increase (58%) in 24-h survival rates. Doses of DMCM that increased 1- and 24-h survival were not lethal when administered alone, and were below the dose that produced convulsions in 50% (CD50) of the animals. The protective effects of DMCM were blocked by pretreatment with the benzodiazepine receptor agonist ethyl-8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo- 4H-imidazo[1,5a][1,4]benzodiazodiazepine-3-carboxylate (Ro 15-1788), which suggests the effects of DMCM are mediated through the benzodiazepine receptor. These findings suggest that DMCM or another benzodiazepine receptor ligand with full inverse agonist qualities could prove effective as an antidote for barbiturate intoxication in man.\r"

The concentration required for 50% inhibition of protozoal DHFR was 1.4 nM. As an inhibitor of this enzyme, trimetrexate was almost 600-fold (amount of antifolate required to inhibit catalytic reaction by 50%) and 750-fold (inhibition constant) more potent than pyrimethamine, the DHFR inhibitor currently used to treat toxoplasma infection. When the protozoan was incubated with 1 microM trimetrexate, the drug rapidly reached high intracellular concentrations. Since toxoplasma organisms lack a transmembrane transport system for physiologic folates, host toxicity can be prevented by co-administration of the reduced folate, leucovorin, without reversing the antiprotozoal effect. The effectiveness of trimetrexate against toxoplasma was demonstrated both in vitro and vivo. Proliferation of toxoplasma in murine macrophages in vitro was completely inhibited by exposure of these cells to 10(-7) M trimetrexate for 18 h. When used alone, trimetrexate was able to extend the survival of T. gondii-infected mice.\r"

ANF caused little or no increase in cGMP content in other nephron segments. The threshold concentration for increased cGMP accumulation by ANF was 0.1-1 nM in IMCD, which is in the range reported for rat plasma. Sodium nitroprusside (1 mM), which selectively stimulates soluble guanylate cyclase, increased cGMP content in glomeruli but not in IMCD. ANF did not alter cAMP accumulation in the absence or presence of vasopressin (AVP) or parathyroid hormone (PTH) in outer and inner medullary tubule suspensions, or in microdissected proximal convoluted tubules (PCT), medullary thick ascending limbs (MAL) or IMCD. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that cGMP is a second messenger for a physiologic action of ANF in the inner medullary collecting duct. ANF apparently activates membrane-bound guanylate cyclase in this segment.\r"

The cDNA clone identified a single collagenase gene of approximately 17 kb from blots of human genomic DNA. The identity of human skin and synovial cell collagenase and the ubiquity of this enzyme and of its substrates, the interstitial collagens types I, II, and III, imply that common mechanisms controlling collagenolysis throughout the human body may be operative in both normal and disease states.\r"

HDL and Apo CI had no effects on the release of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone from rat pituitary cells or the release of prolactin from human decidual cells.

Results indicate that: Plasma aldosterone level decreased markedly in TX rabbits but was not restored 3 h after T3 injection; Early stimulation of Na-K-ATPase by T3 was abolished when plasma aldosterone level was suppressed by adrenalectomy or when aldosterone effects were blocked by spironolactone; Administration of aldosterone to TX rabbits mimicked the action of T3; Sensitivity of Na-K-ATPase to aldosterone markedly decreased after thyroidectomy. These results demonstrate an interaction between aldosterone and T3 in the control of Na-K-ATPase in the collecting tubule. Triiodothyronine enhances the sensitivity of Na-K-ATPase to aldosterone which, in turn, produces a stimulatory action despite the decreased plasma level observed during hypothyroidism.\r"

  ".W": "Iron and iron compounds--including mammalian hemoglobins--catalyze hydroxyl radical production and lipid peroxidation. To determine whether hemoglobin-mediated lipid peroxidation might be important in hemorrhagic injuries to the central nervous system (CNS), we studied the effects of purified hemoglobin on CNS homogenates and injected hemoglobin into the spinal cords of anesthetized cats. Hemoglobin markedly inhibits Na/K ATPase activity in CNS homogenates and spinal cords of living cats. Hemoglobin also catalyzes substantial peroxidation of CNS lipids. Importantly, the potent iron chelator, desferrioxamine, blocks these adverse effects of hemoglobin, both in vitro and in vivo. Because desferrioxamine is not known to interact with heme iron, these results indicate that free iron, derived from hemoglobin, is the proximate toxic species. Overall, our data suggest that hemoglobin, released from red cells after trauma, can promote tissue injury through iron-dependent mechanisms. Suppression of this damage by desferrioxamine suggests a rational therapeutic approach to management of trauma-induced CNS injury.\r"

Lesser elevations were seen in a group of age-matched control subjects who did not have Kaposi's sarcoma or intercurrent illness. The greater elevations in plasma von Willebrand factor antigen therefore appear to be the direct consequence of the presence of Kaposi's sarcoma cells. Our findings also suggest that there is a direct relationship between tumor load and degree of von Willebrand factor antigen elevation.\r"

A group of twenty-four patients, treated by identical high-dose electron beam therapy alone, served as control subjects. Actuarial analysis by the Kaplan-Meier method and statistical analysis by the generalized Wilcoxon test of Gehan demonstrated a significant difference (p = 0.008) in the probability of Stages I and II patients' remaining in complete clinical remission when combination therapy was compared with high-dose electron beam therapy alone. No statistically significant difference was demonstrated in patients in Stages III and IV mycosis fungoides. Although 60% of patients were in \"complete clinical remission,\" the longest follow-up being 75 months, all continued to show karyotypic abnormalities of circulating lymphocytes, and 70% had intermittently and abnormally elevated blood levels of Sezary cells.\r"

In successfully treated lesional skin 1 month after the end of electron beam therapy, the density of epidermal Langerhans cells and indeterminate cells had decreased markedly. In incompletely resolved lesions, Langerhans cells and indeterminate cells were still at pretreatment levels. Epidermal T6 and Ia antigens showed the same pattern of response. Epidermal cell suspensions from lesional and normal skin before and after electron beam therapy were assayed for epidermal thymocyte activating factor. The values of production of this factor did not correlate with the source of the epidermal cells, response to therapy, or the patient's disease course. Skin lesions resembling xerosis and parapsoriasis and histologically lacking the criteria for mycosis fungoides appeared during clinical remissions. These nonspecific skin lesions had densities of epidermal Langerhans cells, indeterminate cells, and T6-positive and Ia-positive cells comparable to levels found in pretreatment lesional skin.\r"

Biopsy specimens showed dense infiltration of lymphoid cells in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue associated with the formation of lymphoid follicles. The clinical and histologic pictures were similar to those of lymphocytoma cutis. Immunohistologically, the nodular lesions were characterized by the proliferation of T cells, mainly suppressor/cytotoxic T cells, and the presence of histiocytic cells displaying Leu-3a antigens on the surface. Patch tests of aqueous gold compound induced a strong skin reaction. A histologic study of the patch test reaction sites revealed a picture of ordinary allergic contact dermatitis showing that T cells, including both helper and suppressor T cells, invaded the spongiotic epidermis and the papillary dermis. Eosinophils and a few Langerhans cells were also present in the dermal infiltrates. These findings suggest that pierced-type gold earrings induced a long-term dermal response that resulted in producing benign lymphoplasia in the sensitized individuals.\r"

To examine the role of the rapid inhibitor of t-PA, plasma samples were analyzed from 75 patients with chest pain syndrome undergoing coronary angiography (mean age 57 years), 24 patients with clinically documented coronary artery disease (unstable angina, positive exercise stress test or previous history of myocardial infarction; mean age 58 years) and 15 young normal subjects (mean age 26 years). Plasma t-PA inhibitor levels were similar in age-matched patients regardless of the absence or presence (and degree) of coronary artery disease. Plasma t-PA inhibitor levels correlated significantly with age (r - 0.46, p less than 0.005), suggesting an age-dependent decrease in fibrinolytic activity. Plasma t-PA inhibitor levels also correlated significantly with serum triglyceride levels (r - 0.60, p less than 0.001), but not with coronary risk factors such as serum cholesterol, diabetes, hypertension, serum uric acid levels or body weight. Association of high levels of inhibitor of t-PA with hypertriglyceridemia may be of importance in the development of coronary thrombosis, especially in elderly patients. Nonetheless, this study does not suggest a pathogenic role of t-PA inhibitor in coronary atherosclerosis.\r"

  ".W": "The antiarrhythmic and antifibrillatory effects of flecainide acetate during the early postinfarction period were evaluated in a conscious canine model of sudden cardiac death. Ventricular tachycardia remained inducible early after infarction in eight of nine dogs receiving an intravenous loading dose of flecainide (2.0 mg/kg body weight) and seven of eight dogs receiving saline vehicle. In both the drug and vehicle groups, there was no significant change in the ventricular refractory period or in the cycle length of the induced ventricular tachycardia. With a maintenance intravenous infusion of flecainide, 1.0 mg/kg per h for 4 hours, the subsequent occurrence of acute posterolateral ischemia resulted in the development of ventricular fibrillation and sudden death in seven of eight flecainide-treated and eight of eight vehicle-treated dogs. Seven additional postinfarction dogs with noninducible tachycardia during pretreatment programmed stimulation, and thereby considered to be at \"low risk\" for the development of ischemic ventricular fibrillation, were also given flecainide in an intravenous loading and maintenance dosing regimen. The subsequent occurrence of posterolateral ischemia resulted in the development of ventricular fibrillation in three of these seven dogs. These findings suggest that flecainide acetate may not possess pharmacologic properties useful in managing ventricular tachycardia or in preventing ischemic ventricular fibrillation in the presence of recent myocardial damage.\r"

Nitrate sensitivity was defined by a prior 20 minute infusion of nitroglycerin, 21 micrograms/min. Five patients with a satisfactory hemodynamic response to intravenous nitroglycerin received two nitroglycerin patches of 10 cm2 each and five patients who did not achieve a satisfactory response to intravenous nitroglycerin (that is, greater than or equal to 25% reduction in left ventricular filling pressure) received larger doses of transdermal nitroglycerin. In the five nitrate-sensitive patients who received 20 cm2 of transdermal nitroglycerin, one study was terminated at 90 minutes, at which point there was no detectable hemodynamic response or arterial plasma nitroglycerin evident. Two patients had a minimal hemodynamic response and a peak plasma concentration of 1 ng/ml. A fourth patient had a short-lived hemodynamic response at 60 and 120 minutes and a plasma nitroglycerin concentration of 1 ng/ml at 60 minutes. A fifth patient had a hemodynamic response persisting for 24 hours and plasma concentrations between 0.6 and 1.1 ng/ml. The remaining five patients showed little or no hemodynamic response despite doses of transdermal nitroglycerin from 40 to 60 cm2. The highest plasma concentration achieved in these patients was 2 ng/ml and there was no relation between dose administered and plasma concentration achieved. In 4 of the 10 patients who subsequently received nitroglycerin ointment, there were a greater decrease in left- and right-sided filling pressures and greater increase in plasma nitroglycerin concentrations (from 1.6 to 4.8 ng/ml) than those that occurred with transdermal nitroglycerin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the present experiments, we demonstrate a direct inhibitory effect on the growth of human T cells by anti-T3 or anti-Ti antibodies. The proliferation of human peripheral blood T cells preactivated by exposure to PHA was inhibited in a specific manner by anti-T3. Colony formation in soft agar by REX cells, a leukemic cell line of early T cell phenotype, was completely inhibited by anti-T3 or anti-Ti antibodies, whereas isotype-matched antibodies to a variety of other T cell markers had no effect. Growth of REX cells in suspension culture was not affected by anti-T3 or anti-Ti. A cell line, T3.N1, was established from an agar colony of anti-T3-resistant REX cells. T3.N1 was phenotypically identical to REX except for failure to express any detectable T3 or Ti surface antigen. T3.N1 colony formation in soft agar was not inhibited by anti-T3 or anti-Ti. There was no rise in [Ca2+]i of T3.N1 cells after anti-T3 or anti-Ti exposure. These results indicate that in addition to the well-known positive regulatory effects of ligand binding to the T3/Ti complex, T3/Ti binding can also result in a down-regulatory signal for human T cell growth.\r"

  ".W": "We report here a comparative study of the effects of several cytokines known to affect myeloid cell differentiation on functional properties of human mature granulocytes. We show that recombinant interferon-gamma (rIFN-gamma), recombinant granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor (rGM-CSF), recombinant tumor necrosis factor (rTNF), and lymphotoxin (LT) purified to homogeneity are potent stimulators of polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) activity. All cytokines enhance antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (Ab-CMC) mediated by human PMN; however, rGM-CSF, rTNF, and LT have an immediate and short-lived effect on the PMN, whereas the activation by rIFN-gamma requires several hours of induction but can be observed up to 24 to 48 hr of culture. Only the effect of rIFN-gamma is in part dependent on induction of a high-affinity FcR for monomeric IgG on PMN, as suggested by two-color sorting analysis, and on mechanisms that result in prolonged survival of PMN in a functionally active state to mediate oxidative burst, phagocytosis, and bactericidal activity. Greater enhancement of Ab-CMC is obtained by using rIFN-gamma in combination with the other cytokines. Our data indicate that cytokines previously defined on the basis of their cytotoxic effects mediate a wide spectrum of activities on mature myeloid cells and provide evidence for their possible role in vivo, alone or in combination with rIFN-gamma, in modulating functional activities of cells responsible for non-adaptive systems of defense.\r"

  ".U": "87110604\r", 
  ".W": "Cyclosporin A (CsA) has been found previously to block mitogen-stimulated T cell proliferation and production of discrete T cell-derived lymphokines such as interleukin 2 (IL 2) and interferon (IFN)-gamma. In addition, CsA blocks pokeweed mitogen (PWM)-driven T cell-dependent differentiation of B cells into immunoglobulin (Ig)-secreting cells. Recently, we reported that CsA (1 microgram/ml) inhibited PWM-induced T cell production of IL 2 and IFN-gamma, but supernatants retained B cell differentiation factor (BCDF)-like activity. The present study demonstrates the ability of CsA to suppress T cell functions in PWM-driven Ig production in mononuclear cells (MNC), and the capacity of exogenous T cell lymphokines to reverse CsA-induced suppression. CsA profoundly suppressed PWM-driven PFC formation (greater than 95%). However, Ig production was substantially reconstituted by the addition of IL 2 at concentrations of 10 to 50 U/ml. In contrast, no effects were observed by the addition of IFN-gamma or BCGF. The kinetics of CsA inhibition of Ig production and IL 2 secretion were found to be closely related. In addition, to obtain effective reconstitution in the CsA-treated PWM-MNC system it was necessary to add IL 2 at the initiation of culture. T cells themselves were also required for B cell differentiation in this system. However, surface Ig+ cells obtained by cell sorting after 3 days of culture could differentiate in the absence of T cells but only in response to IL 2, not in response to IFN-gamma or BCDF. Thus, in PWM-driven B cell differentiation T cells are necessary early in culture, whereas IL 2 is essential from the initial stage of B cell activation through the final stage of B cell differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "This report demonstrates that 125I-recombinant human interferon-gamma (125I-rHuIFN-gamma) binds to high-affinity specific receptors on human platelets. Scatchard analysis of binding data indicates the presence of homogeneous sites estimated in the order of 150 to 200, with an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd, of 2 X 10(-10) M. The binding of 125I-rHuIFN-gamma to platelet membrane was inhibited by unlabeled rHuIFN-gamma but not by unlabeled rHuIFN-alpha or unlabeled rHuIFN-beta. High affinity binding sites for HuIFN-alpha were not detectable. Cross-linking of 125I-rHuIFN-gamma to platelet membrane proteins with the use of a bifunctional agent (DSS) yielded a predominant complex of 100,000 +/- 5,000 daltons on SDS-PAGE autoradiography, which confirms the presence of specific receptors for IFN-gamma. Two faint bands of lower m.w., 70,000 and 90,000, could also be visualized. Cross-linking of 125I-rHuIFN-alpha to platelet surface could not be demonstrated by using the same procedures. This is the first time that a receptor for a lymphokine (IFN-gamma) has been demonstrated on human platelets. These findings are consistent with data already published, suggesting an interrelationship between IFN and platelet function.\r"

In addition, an anti-peptide serum against CD3 delta-chain was made. The anti-alpha peptide serum reacted with all human TcR (from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes, cytotoxic T cell clones, and the T cell leukemias: HPB-ALL, Jurkat, JA3, and JM), and the anti-beta peptide serum reacted with only human TcR of the C beta 2 isotype (from a cytotoxic T cell clone which had a C beta 2 transcript, HPB-ALL, and a proportion of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes, but not with Jurkat, JA3, and JM). A comparison of the detergents NP-40 and digitonin revealed that digitonin was more efficient at keeping the TcR/CD3 complex intact, but was less efficient at solubilizing the total amount of TcR or the total amount of CD3. With these reagents and the use of digitonin, it was shown that all of the alpha, beta, and CD3 moieties on the surface of a T cell leukemia HPB-ALL occur as a bound TcR/CD3 complex. The proportion of C beta 1 to C beta 2 isotype expressed on the surface of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes was 0.8, indicating approximately equal use of the two beta-chain isotypes.\r"

  ".U": "87110611\r", 
  ".W": "We have shown recently that an average of three or more C9 molecules must bind to C5b-8 on Escherichia coli strain J5 to cause direct complement killing in the absence of serum lysozyme. We initially confirmed and extended this observation by showing that deposition of a large number of C5b-9 complexes bearing 1C9 per C5b-8 was not bactericidal for J5. To identify the target site for bactericidal C5b-9 deposition, we measured release of periplasmic and cytoplasmic markers of different size from J5 as the C9:C5b-8 ratio was changed, because the diameter of the C5b-9 channel is known to increase as the C9:C5b-8 ratio increases. To facilitate measurement of release of the periplasmic marker beta-lactamase (BLA), J5 was transformed for high level constitutive TEM-1 BLA production (J5-Amp). Multimeric C9 within C5b-9 (C9:C5b-8 greater than 3) was required to release BLA (m.w. 28,900) from J5-Amp regardless of whether cells bore 310, 560, or 890 C5b-9/organism. Curves of both BLA release and killing vs C9:C5b-8 ratio were sigmoidal and nearly superimposable. Release of the small cytoplasmic marker 86Rb, a potassium analog, also required a minimum C9:C5b-8 ratio of 3:1; specific 86Rb release did not occur in the absence of killing. Release of the large cytoplasmic marker beta-galactosidase (m.w. 505,000) did not occur even at the highest achievable C9:C5b-8 ratio of 11:1, despite greater than 99.9% killing, indicating that there was no dissolution of the peptidoglycan layer due to incomplete removal of serum lysozyme. Complement-mediated killing of J5 requires sufficient damage to the outer membrane or formation of a sufficiently large C5b-9 channel to release the large periplasmic marker BLA. The requirement of multimeric C9 for 86Rb release suggests that at low C9:C5b-8 ratios, either C5b-9 does not have access to the cytoplasmic space or that the J5 K+ transport systems are able to compensate for putative C5b-9 channels.\r"

These may be purified to 80% by use of density gradient centrifugation. The majority of mast cells (79%) measured between 9 and 13 micron in diameter, and the mean histamine content was 4.6 pg/cell. Viability was demonstrated by trypan blue exclusion by 93% of the cells and the low spontaneous histamine secretion of less than 7% in functional studies. Anti-IgE released up to 17.5% of cell-associated histamine within 5 to 7 min. Calcium ionophore-induced release was optimal with 0.3 microM A23187 when 28.6% histamine was released. Unlike human lung mast cells, skin mast cells released histamine in response to compound 48/80 and poly-L-lysine. This release, which was complete within 20 sec, was totally dependent on intact glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation and partially dependent on extracellular calcium. The same characteristics were observed with secretion induced by substance P and morphine. The weak activity of eledoisin and physalaemin suggests that the substance P receptor, like that of the rat mast cell, is not of the classical types described for smooth muscle. Morphine-induced secretion was partially blocked by naloxone in a manner not compatible with competitive antagonism at a classical opioid receptor. The sensitivity of skin mast cells to nonimmunologic stimulation clearly distinguishes them from mast cells of the lung and lymphoid tissues and provides evidence of functional heterogeneity within human mast cells.\r"

Spleen cells from these mice were shown to have depressed in vitro responses to concanavalin A (Con A) that coincided with the development of indomethacin-sensitive suppressor cells. Depressed responses to Con A were noted as early as 1 wk after parasite inoculation and correlated with the increased production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by spleen cells from infected mice. Mice induced by prior irradiation (550 rad) to heal infection did not develop indomethacin-reversible depression in responsiveness to Con A. Although macrophages appear to be the major source of PGE2 production, in vitro studies indicate that infection per se is not a sufficient stimulus to initiate prostaglandin (PG) synthesis, suggesting the involvement of other cell types. Mice treated in vivo with indomethacin exhibited significantly fewer metastatic lesions than control mice, suggesting that PG may play a role in the exacerbation of cutaneous disease in these animals.\r"

  ".W": "The inability of most untreated patients with Kala-azar to control their visceral infections with Leishmania donovani has been attributed to a defective cell-mediated immune response to leishmanial antigens. We examined the in vitro response of T cells, including Leu-2+-depleted T cell populations, to determine whether unresponsiveness could be reversed. These studies on patients with visceral leishmaniasis in Bihar, north India, support previous observations regarding T cell unresponsiveness in patients with active disease: it is profound, it is specific, and it is reversible after successful chemotherapy. However, these studies also indicate that the specific unresponsiveness cannot be reversed by depletion of \"suppressor\" Leu-2+ T lymphocytes, nor by the addition of exogenously supplied human IL 2 to the cultures. One interpretation of these results is that in active cases of Kala-azar, there is an absence of Leishmania-specific T cells in the periphery. The possibility that reactive cells can be found in situ cannot be excluded. The observation that 13 of 25 family members of active cases were able respond to L. donovani in vitro or by skin testing suggests that the frequency of infection within an endemic area in Bihar is very high, and that assays for T cell responsiveness are far better epidemiologic tools for the detection of asymptomatic infection than is ELISA. Identification of such an exposed, Kala-azar-resistant population will be required to study host factors which influence the development of disease in infected individuals.\r"

These T cell clones were also tested for their reactivity to three abundant M. tuberculosis proteins of 65, 19, and 14 kD, each expressed from recombinant DNA in Escherichia coli. The three proteins were expressed from DNA clones that were previously isolated from a lambda gt11 genomic DNA library of M. tuberculosis by using monoclonal antibodies directed against this pathogen. A T cell clone from one patient was stimulated by an E. coli lysate containing the 65 kD antigen, and a T cell clone from a second patient was stimulated by an E. coli lysate containing the 19 kD antigen in an in vitro proliferation assay. Both T cell clones showed very limited cross-reactivity when tested against other mycobacteria. We conclude that some patients with tuberculosis exhibit a T cell response to the 65 and 19 kD M. tuberculosis proteins defined by these isolated genes.\r"

  ".W": "V kappa Ig germ-line genes have been isolated from recombinant clones prepared in separate libraries constructed from adult BALB/c liver DNA. Three different clones that strongly hybridized with a V kappa-GAT-specific probe were completely characterized and sequenced. All three genes exhibited common characteristic features in their sequences encompassing the 5' to the 3' noncoding region, with coding sections 95% homologous. A comparison with other V kappa genes shows that the size of the first intron is variability subgroup specific. Moreover, a direct correlation exists between the size of this intron and the entire length of the coding region. Nucleotide sequences of these genes were compared with V kappa chains expressed at the Ab1 and Ab1' levels of the GAT idiotypic network: Ag----Ab1----Ab2----Ab3 (Ab1'). K1A5 and K5.1 genes account for V kappa chains in Ab1 and Ab1' hybridomas, respectively. The high conservation of Ab1' sequences in light chain was also recently reported for the heavy chains, suggesting that immunization with Ab2 (anti-idiotypic) antibodies preferentially stimulates the direct expression of germ-line genes. K5.1 and K1A5 genes belong to the V kappa-1 variability subgroup and encode, without any amino acid substitution, V kappa domain in myeloma TEPC 105 and MOPC 467, which are V kappa-1A and V kappa-1C subgroup prototypes, respectively. These genes are extensively used in different mouse strains and in a number of antibodies of discrete specificities, such as anti-GAT, anti-DNP, anti-flagellin, anti-phosphorylcholine, anti-digoxin, anti-phenyloxazolone, and anti-DNA.\r"

By using the human lymphoblastoid cell line WI-L2-729-HF2, and mononuclear cells from several sources, a panel of hybridomas was generated that produced 17.109 CRI-positive Ig. A recently cloned human germ-line V kappa III gene, Humkv305, served as a probe to identify genes which were rearranged and expressed in 17.109 CRI-positive and -negative hybridomas. This probe, when hybridized to human genomic DNA under stringent conditions, identified only two to five germ-line bands. In 10 separate 17.109 CRI-positive hybridoma clones, an additional rearranged V kappa band was identified. The probe did not anneal to rearranged V kappa bands in hybridoma clones that produced kappa-chains lacking the CRI. RNA dot-blot studies provided evidence for expression of genes hybridizing to the Humkv305 probe. The results indicate that the 17.109 CRI is a serologic marker for a single V kappa gene, or a small family of closely related V kappa genes, which is identified by the Humkv305 probe.\r"

  ".U": "87110627\r", 
  ".W": "We recently reported the preparation and characterization of a monoclonal antibody, 32.2, specific for the high-affinity Fc receptor (FcR) for IgG on human monocytes. We have utilized the hybridoma cell line producing this antibody as a target for monocyte-mediated cytotoxicity. The hybridoma was selected for stable sublines that expressed high quantities of surface 32.2 immunoglobulin (Ig) through flow cytometry. Monocyte-mediated cytotoxicity, with these sublines used as targets, was evaluated with the use of a 51Cr-release assay. It was found that monocytes could efficiently lyse the hybridoma cells (HC 32.2) bearing surface Ig directed to the high-affinity FcR. Consistent with the specificity of the 32.2 antibody for an epitope on the high-affinity receptor outside of the ligand binding site, human IgG did not block monocyte killing of HC 32.2. In contrast, monocytes could not mediate lysis of hybridoma cells bearing high levels of antibody directed to other monocyte cell surface molecules, in particular, class I MHC molecules, the C3bi receptor, and the My 23 antigen. The effect of IFN-gamma on the ability of monocytes to mediate lysis of the 32.2 Ig-bearing hybridomas was also assessed. Monocytes cultured in the absence of IFN-gamma could lyse the hybridoma line expressing high levels of 32.2 Ig as efficiently as monocytes cultured in the presence of IFN-gamma. However, untreated monocytes were less able than IFN-gamma-treated monocytes to kill HC 32.2 expressing lower levels of Ig. Thus, IFN-gamma may enhance the efficiency of monocyte-mediated antibody-dependent killing under conditions where limited antibody is available on the target. These studies demonstrate that the high-affinity FcR on monocytes can act as a cytotoxic trigger molecule for killing of tumor cell targets and that this trigger does not require specific binding to the Fc binding epitope. These results further encourage possible clinical application of the 32.2 monoclonal antibody in tumor therapy.\r"

  ".U": "87110628\r", 
  ".W": "As we have reported, calcium ionophore A23187 activates macrophages for tumor cell killing, and the activated macrophages produced a soluble cytotoxic factor (M phi-CF) that is similar, if not identical, to tumor necrosis factor. Based on these observations, we have investigated whether calcium is involved in the activation mediated by another potent macrophage activator, namely lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We first showed that A23187 caused uptake of extracellular calcium-45 by macrophage monolayers, whereas LPS did not. Because in this system rapid changes would not have been detected, several other approaches also have been used. We have examined the effect of depleting extracellular calcium by using medium containing no added calcium, supplemented with 1 mM EGTA. In no case did depletion result in decreased M phi-CF production by LPS-treated macrophages. Measurements using the fluorescent intracellular calcium indicator Quin 2 have also been performed. The calcium ionophore ionomycin caused a rapid change in the intracellular Quin 2 signal. LPS, even at a concentration in vast excess of that required to activate the macrophages, caused no change in the signal during a 2-hr period. If the macrophages were loaded with high doses of Quin 2 or another intracellular chelator, TMB-8, M phi-CF production decreased and cytotoxic activity was impaired. These data indicate that one or more of the processes involved in M phi-CF production does require calcium, but that activation mediated by LPS occurs without the influx of extracellular calcium or redistribution of intracellular calcium.\r"

Three of the preparations were highly cytotoxic against autologous fresh melanoma tumor cells, but not against autologous fresh normal cells or allogeneic fresh tumor targets. The other three were highly cytotoxic against autologous fresh melanoma tumor cells and also had a limited capacity to kill allogeneic fresh tumor targets. The tumor-associated specific killer cells could be expanded from threefold to 95,652-fold with maintenance of specific antitumor lysis. The expanded tumor-infiltrating cells were Leu-4+ T cells, and in five of six patients the majority were Leu-3+. These studies demonstrate that the melanoma-bearing patient raises an immune response against autologous tumor and presents a method for the generation of human lymphocytes with antitumor reactivity that may be useful in the adoptive immunotherapy of tumors.\r"

A striking correlation was observed between Pgp-1 expression and enrichment for antigen-specific memory cytolytic T lymphocyte precursors (CTLp). After immunization with the male minor transplantation antigen H-Y, virtually all the H-Y-specific CTLp were found in the minor Pgp-1+ subset of Lyt-2+ cells. In addition, after alloimmunization the frequency of allospecific CTLp resistant to inhibition by anti-Lyt-2 antibody was markedly enriched within the Pgp-1+ cells, suggesting an enrichment for CTLp bearing high avidity antigen receptors. Taken together, these data suggest that surface Pgp-1 expression is stably acquired at the time of primary antigenic stimulation by virgin T cells. As such, Pgp-1 represents an important marker for identifying a subset of Lyt-2+ T cells with the quantitative and qualitative properties of memory CTLp.\r"

This raises the question of how the lectin or oxidizing agent alters the system in such a way that an \"inappropriate\" CTL-TC interaction takes place, in a class I-dependent manner. In this study we show that if papain-sensitive molecules are cleared from the TC surface and are allowed to regenerate in the presence of tunicamycin, the cells still serve as targets in direct, class I antigen-specific CTL killing, but not in LDCC or ODCC. Target cells treated in this way display N-linked carbohydrate-less class I proteins, and presumably other N-linked carbohydrate-less, papain-sensitive molecules as well. We present data showing that both types of molecules are important in nonspecific lytic reactions.\r"

Previous studies from this laboratory have established that low doses (0.0025 microgram) of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) or a T-dependent form of PVP, PVP-coupled horse red blood cells (PVP-HRBC) can activate PVP-specific TH. The present study was undertaken in order to determine some of the characteristics of the TH activated by PVP and to compare their properties with those of classical TH1 and of TH2 cells described in many T-dependent systems. TH activated with either 0.0025 microgram of PVP or PVP-HRBC were characterized with respect to cell surface antigens, Igh restriction and generation in mice expressing an X-linked immune defect (xid mice). PVP-specific TH are similar to TH1 cells in that they are required for the production of IgG subclasses absent in primary responses and have the Lyt-1+, L3T4+, I-J-surface phenotype. These TH may not be identical with TH1 cells, however, since they are I-A+ and Igh restricted. PVP-specific TH can be generated in xid mice which do not produce antibody in a primary anti-PVP response and do not develop a memory response to PVP, regardless of whether it is presented as a type 2 or T-dependent antigen.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the role of B cells in antigen presentation in lymph nodes in several ways. We found that mice depleted of B lymphocytes via chronic injection of anti-mu-chain antibody do not mount peripheral lymph node T cell proliferative responses to normally immunogenic doses of antigen. Depletion of B cells by passage of immune lymph node cells over anti-immunoglobulin columns early after immunization depletes antigen-presenting function from draining lymph nodes, and this function can be restored by using B cells or splenic adherent cells to allow the remaining T cells to proliferate. Lymph node B cells present antigen very effectively to lines of antigen-specific T cells. However, unfractionated lymph node cells from anti-mu-treated mice present very poorly, if at all, whereas unfractionated spleen cells from the same mice do present antigen. This is in keeping with our previous finding that helper T cell function in the spleen is normal in B cell-deprived mice. Finally, when mice homozygous for the lymphoproliferative gene lpr are treated chronically with anti-mu-chain antibody, lymphadenopathy is greatly retarded, suggesting a role for B cells in the massive proliferation of T cells in this syndrome. From this analysis, it would appear that the initiating antigen-presenting cell in the lymph node is a B lymphocyte, and that B lymphocytes in lymph nodes may be distinct from those in the spleen. It is of interest that these results also suggest that the lymph node lacks an antigen-presenting cell that is found in the spleen, perhaps the dendritic cell.\r"

Human blood lymphocytes were cultured for 3 days with 100 U/ml recombinant interleukin 2 (rIL 2), subpopulations isolated with monoclonal antibodies and a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) and assayed for cytotoxic activity against 51chromium labeled noncultured melanoma tumor cells. Initial experiments compared the LAK effector function of CD5+ T lymphocytes vs CD5- cells (predominantly CD16+ NK cells). The mean percent specific release at a 10:1 effector:target (E:T) ratio was 25% +/- 16 for CD5- cells, 10% +/- 6 for CD5+ cells, and 22% +/- 9 for unsorted cells. In contrast, when lymphocyte subpopulations were isolated before rIL 2 culture (LAK precursors), CD5- cells but not CD5+ cells developed LAK activity (28% +/- 12 vs 1% +/- 1, mean percent specific release, 10:1 E:T ratio), confirming our previous results showing that only CD16+ cells were LAK precursors. The discrepancy between LAK effector and precursor phenotypes suggested that LAK precursors acquired CD5 determinants during rIL 2 culture; however, double label immunofluorescence of rIL 2 cultured CD16+ cells showed that this was not the case. The data suggested that in the presence of other cell types, some T lymphocytes may develop LAK activity, but purified blood T lymphocytes do not develop LAK function when cultured with rIL 2 alone. We also analyzed LAK effector function in lymphocyte subpopulations defined by CD4 and CD8 antigens. The data showed that lymphocytes with a low density expression of CD8 and no expression of CD4 were enriched for LAK effector cells, whereas CD4+ and CD8- had less activity than unsorted cells. Lymphocytes with a high density expression of CD8 had activity similar to unsorted cells. We also assessed the contribution of Leu-7 (HNK-1) granular lymphocytes to LAK effector function. After culture with IL 2, lymphocytes were depleted of Leu-7+ cells by antibody and complement treatment and then were sorted into CD5+ and CD5- fractions. The cytotoxic activity of Leu-7-CD5+ cells was a mean 5% +/- 5 vs a mean 14% +/- 8 for the total CD5+ population (20:1 E:T ratio). The activity of Leu-7- CD5- was slightly less than the total CD5- fraction (21% +/- 9 vs 28% +/- 14, 10:1 E:T ratio). In conclusion, LAK effector function was highest in non-T cell (CD5- CD16+) populations and some activity was also present in T cell populations (CD5+ and predominantly Leu-7+).\r"

Clones A7 and B7 transfer thyroiditis to irradiated (475 rad) syngeneic mice, but not to normal recipients. The thyroid lesion induced by the B7 clone is characterized by the infiltration of both mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells. The thyroiditis is transient in that lesions are apparent 7 and 14 days after transfer, but thyroids return to normal by day 21. Clone B7 showed helper activity for trinitrophenyl-keyhole limpet hemocyanin-primed B cells in vitro when stimulated with trinitrophenyl-MTG and also stimulated the production of anti-MTG antibody in recipient mice. Clone A7 induced thyroid lesions characterized by infiltration of the thyroid with mononuclear cells, with virtually no polymorphonuclear cell infiltration. This clone has shown no helper activity following stimulation with trinitrophenyl-MTG. The third clone (D2) proliferates to and shows helper activity to MTG, but fails to transfer thyroiditis to syngeneic, irradiated mice. On continuous culture, clone B7 lost its surface Thy. The loss of Thy appears unrelated to the ability to transfer thyroiditis since subclones of B7 with markedly different percentages of Thy+ cells transferred disease equally well.\r"

I-E-restricted T cell clones derived from B10.A(5R) mice were found to fall into three groups: Type I clones recognized antigen only in the context of syngeneic apcs, Type II clones recognized antigen with the same highly specific major histocompatibility complex restriction but in addition proliferated in response to allogeneic stimuli; Type III clones were \"degenerate\" in their major histocompatibility complex-restricted recognition of antigen and proliferated when antigen-presenting cells bearing Eb beta Ek alpha (syngeneic), Ek beta Ek alpha, or Ed beta Ed alpha were used. These observations allow some conclusions to be drawn about sites on the I-E molecule that may be functionally significant in the presentation of this antigen. By using the B cell hybridoma LK35.2 as target cells, some of these T cell clones act as cytotoxic cells in the Class II-restricted manner predicted from the results of proliferative assays. Class II-restricted cytotoxicity can therefore be controlled by both I-A and I-E mouse Ir gene loci.\r"

  ".W": "Because infiltration of mononuclear cells and fibroblast proliferation are associated in chronic inflammatory lesions, we tested the hypothesis that leukotrienes (LT), a product of activated mononuclear cells, may modulate fibroblast growth. Proliferation of cultured human skin fibroblasts was estimated by [3H]thymidine incorporation and cell count at increasing concentrations (0.1 nM to 0.1 microM) of LTC4 or LTD4. LTC4 and LTD4 stimulated cell growth in a dose-dependent manner only in the presence of 50 microM indomethacin. Under similar conditions, LTE4 but not LTB4 (0.1 microM) was active. Both asynchronous, growing cells and synchronous, quiescent cells were sensitive to LT when prostaglandin (PG) synthesis was suppressed by indomethacin. Other blockers of cyclooxygenase such as ibuprofen and aspirin exhibited identical permissive activity, and the effect of indomethacin was totally abolished by addition of PGE2. LTC4 modified neither [3H]arachidonic acid release from prelabeled fibroblasts nor PGE2 production by fibroblasts. These results demonstrate that the sulfidopeptide LT stimulate fibroblast proliferation only when the endogenous synthesis of PG is blocked, but they do not enhance the synthesis of PG in their target cells showing no evidence for a negative feed-back loop. Nevertheless, it seems likely that the initiation and development of the fibrotic process in the different tissues depends in part on the local balance between PG and LT productions.\r"

  ".W": "The interaction between prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and chemotactic peptide formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) in cAMP production in guinea pig neutrophils was investigated. Both PGE1 and fMLP increased the cAMP content in neutrophils. At low concentrations of PGE1 (less than 10 nM), the effects of fMLP and PGE1 in stimulating cAMP accumulation were additive, but at high concentrations of PGE1, their effects were synergistic. The effects of PGE1 and Ca2+ ionophore A23187 instead of fMLP on cAMP accumulation were also synergistic. The synergy did not appear to be related to change in cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity, because it was still marked in the presence of isobutyl-3-methyl-1-xanthine, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Studies on the time course of PGE1-induced cAMP accumulation showed that cAMP production ceased within 5 min after the addition of high concentrations of PGE1. The period of cAMP production could not be prolonged by combined treatment with PGE1 and fMLP or Ca2+ ionophore A23187. The synergy was found to be caused through Ca2+-dependent processes, because depletion of the medium of Ca2+ and addition of the Ca2+ antagonist TMB-8 inhibited the synergistic increase in cAMP. Moreover, the calmodulin antagonist W-7 also effectively inhibited the synergistic increase in cAMP. These results suggest that the potentiation of PGE1-induced cAMP production by fMLP or Ca2+ ionophore A23187 is catalyzed by calmodulin-dependent processes. However, the synergistic increase in cAMP production was not inhibited by arachidonic acid cascade inhibitors such as indomethacin, BW755C, or nordihydroguiaretic acid, and a combination of PGE1 and a protein kinase C activator, tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA), did not cause synergistic increase in cAMP. Marked increase in cAMP was also induced by a combination of cholera toxin and fMLP or Ca2+ ionophore A23187, but not by a combination of forskolin and fMLP or Ca2+ ionophore A23187. The synergistic increase in cAMP was not sustained in isolated membranes. On the contrary, PGE1-induced cAMP production in isolated membranes was suppressed by their pretreatment with fMLP or Ca2+ ionophore A23187. These data suggest that the synergistic effects of PGE1 and fMLP or Ca2+ ionophore in increasing the cAMP level are due to potentiation of PGE1-induced cAMP production by Ca2+ and calmodulin-dependent processes.\r"

Approximately 25 to 30% of these clones are recognized by KJ16-133, an anti-T cell receptor monoclonal antibody presumably specific for products of the V beta 8 gene family, and an antibody with similar specificity, F23.1. In contrast to most previous reports, both KJ16-133 and F23.1, over a wide range of antibody concentrations, fail to inhibit the antigen-specific effector function of these CTL. Instead, the antibodies activate the CTL to kill without regard for the MHC haplotype of the target cells or the presence of the appropriate viral antigen. This anti-T cell receptor antibody-induced cytolysis by our clones does not appear to be mediated by Fc receptors on target cells. Nuclear destruction of target cells as a result of antibody-induced lysis suggests that it occurs via a mechanism similar to antigen-specific lysis by CTL. In addition, both soluble bivalent F23.1 and F23.1 coupled-Sepharose beads are able to induce the secretion of interferon-gamma from these CTL clones.\r"

In a series of earlier studies that made use of mice undergoing spontaneous resolution of footpad infections with Leishmania major, we obtained evidence suggesting that a subpopulation of Leishmania-sensitized lymph node T lymphocytes could activate antimicrobial effects in Leishmania-infected macrophages by an apparently lymphokine-independent mechanism. These effector lymphocytes are not cytotoxic to host cells, and their effects are antigen specific and genetically restricted. To more rigorously investigate this apparently novel mechanism of macrophage activation, we examined the effect of blocking lymphokine production with cyclosporin A (CSA) on the capacity of these effector lymphocytes to exert macrophage activating function. Although CSA blocked lymphokines that activate antileishmanial effects, it did not inhibit the antimicrobial capacity of the effector lymphocytes. We also confirmed that IFN-gamma is the major macrophage-activating lymphokine that induces antileishmanial effects; treatment of lymphokine-containing supernatants with anti-IFN-gamma antibody markedly reduced their antimicrobial effects. In contrast, treatment of effector lymphocytes with this antibody failed to reduce their macrophage-activating capacity. We conclude that there exists an apparently novel macrophage-activating mechanism for antimicrobial defense that is independent of soluble lymphokine mediators.\r"

  ".W": "T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL) can be regarded as the malignant counterparts of cells in various T cell differentiation stages. To study the expression of the human T cell receptor (TcR)-CD3 complex during the early stages of T cell differentiation, we have analyzed 22 T-ALL at the cell membrane level and the DNA level and 12 of them at the RNA level. According to their immunologic phenotype, the T-ALL could be divided into three main groups: 10 immature T-ALL (CD1-/CD3-), seven common thymocytic T-ALL (CD1+/CD3-or+), and five mature T-ALL (CD1-/CD3+). Among the 10 immature T-ALL three appeared to express the immunologic phenotype of the putative prothymocyte (TdT+/HLA-DR+/CD7+/CD2+/CD5-/CD1-/CD3-), whereas the other seven T-ALL appeared to be immature thymocytic (TdT+/HLA-DR-/CD7+/CD2+/CD5+/CD1-/CD3-). Transcripts of the CD3-delta and CD3-epsilon genes were present in all CD3- and CD3+ T-ALL tested, including prothymocytic T-ALL. However, prothymocytic T-ALL had germline TcR-beta genes and were not rearranged to the characterized TcR-gamma joining regions. The presence of CD3 transcripts and absence of TcR gene rearrangements in prothymocytic T-ALL supports their immature T cell character. Two immature thymocytic T-ALL also had germline TcR-gamma genes and one of them had germline TcR-beta genes. In all other T-ALL the TcR-gamma and TcR-beta genes were rearranged. The presumptive functional 1.3-kilobase TcR-beta transcripts were detected in the majority of T-ALL with rearranged TcR-beta genes. Distinct levels of TcR-gamma transcripts appeared to be present only in some thymocytic T-ALL, i.e., some immature thymocytic T-ALL and common thymocytic T-ALL. TcR-alpha mRNA could only be detected in CD3+ mature T-ALL, but was absent in all CD3+ common thymocytic T-ALL tested. Our data indicate that CD3 gene transcription is one of the earliest events during T cell differentiation and already occurs in prothymocytes. The TcR-gamma and TcR-beta genes rearrange early during thymocytic differentiation and can subsequently be transcribed. High levels of TcR-gamma gene transcription may only occur in a part of the T cells during thymic differentiation, while TcR-beta gene transcription continues during further differentiation. TcR-alpha gene transcription may be the final step in the production of the complete set of TcR and CD3 proteins, resulting in the expression of the TcR alpha beta-CD3 complex at the cell surface of mature T cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The expression of class II major histocompatibility (MHC) antigens is central to the mounting of a successful immune response. Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the induction of class II MHC expression may therefore provide the knowledge necessary to manipulate the immune system appropriately. We are particularly interested in the induction of class II MHC antigens on cells in the brain, because of the potential involvement of such brain cells in the initiation and perpetuation of autoimmune-like diseases of the central nervous system. We examined the mechanisms involved in interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) induction of class II MHC antigens on a human glioblastoma multiforme cell line. This paper describes the identification of a 297-bp (base pair) fragment of the class II MHC DR alpha chain gene which is involved in IFN-gamma induction. We were able to identify this IFN-gamma responsive sequence by preparing recombinant plasmids containing 5' flanking pieces of the human DR alpha chain gene placed upstream of the indicator gene, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). These recombinant plasmids were transfected into human glioma cells which were then cultured in the presence or absence of IFN-gamma. After 48 hr, transient expression of CAT was assayed by thin layer chromatography. CAT enzyme activity was significantly increased only in IFN-gamma-treated cells. This increase was also reflected at the RNA level in that IFN-gamma treatment resulted in higher CAT transcripts. A computer homology search revealed a possible consensus sequence shared among different IFN-gamma-inducible genes.\r"

At least six germ-line VH gene segments distributed among four families are used in this response. Seven of the 10 independently rear-ranged VH genes were identified as germ line, with the other three possibly germ line. In all of them the D and JH portions retained the germ-line sequences of the D and JH segments from which they were derived. Maximum diversity was found in the D segments and the use of noncoded nucleotides at the VH-D and D-JH junctions. Of the eight cell lines expressing the lambda light chains, all were germ line and involved the three subtypes. Maximum affinity for the homologous ligand was found among the seven cell lines identified as expressing germ-line gene segments. Thus any somatic mutation among the remaining 3 cell lines did not provide enhanced affinity and the observed affinity of each cell line can be described as germ-line affinity. It is further suggested that the anti-Dns selectivity of the IgM antibodies is associated primarily with the CDR3 regions.\r"

By FACS sorting we separated PBL into Leu-11- and Leu-11+ cell fractions and cultured them for 4 days in 100 U/ml rIL 2. Under these culture conditions, cells of the Leu-11+ fraction acquired a stronger LAK activity against fresh autologous or allogeneic melanoma cells as compared with Leu-11- cells or unfractionated PBL. To better characterize the cells responsible for this cytolytic activity, we directly cloned Leu-11+ and Leu-11- FACS-sorted cells in the presence of 1% PHA, irradiated spleen feeder cells, and rIL 2. From 6 to 10% of the Leu-11+ cells and from 42 to 66% of the Leu-11- cells plated gave rise to clonal progenies that were tested simultaneously for cytolytic activity against fresh melanoma cells and NK-sensitive K562 target cells in a 4-hr 51Cr-release assay. Most of the Leu-11+ microcultures lysed fresh melanoma target cells (35 out of 38 and 26 out of 34 in two separate experiments), whereas only a few clones derived from the Leu-11- cell fraction had this capability (four out of 45 and one out of 41). All the clones lysing fresh melanoma cells also efficiently killed K562 target cells, whereas other clones lysing only K562 could be found among Leu-11+ and Leu-11- clones. Nine clones expressing LAK activity were tested for their reactivity against a panel of different tumor target cells. All clones were able to lyse a broad panel of target cells including NK-sensitive and NK-resistant cultured or noncultured human tumor target cells, as well as mouse tumor cell lines. Surface marker analysis of 14 clones displaying LAK activity, all derived from Leu-11+ cells, showed that they were all T3 (CD3)-, whereas 10 out of 14 expressed the T11 (CD2) antigen and only four were weakly stained by an anti-T8 (CD8) mAb. All 14 clones expressed the T40 (CD7) T cell marker and DR and LFA-1 antigens. Cytolysis inhibition experiments performed on a rIL 2-activated Leu-11+ population and on two LAK cell clones, both expressing T11 antigen, showed that anti-LFA-1 but not anti-T11 mAb could inhibit cytolysis of freshly derived tumor target cells.\r"

Hemolytically active normal mouse serum and C5-deficient mouse serum were used to deposit complement (C) on P815 tumor cells, in the absence of exogenous antibody, by an alternative pathway mechanism. Cell-bound C3 was detected and was quantified by using a cellular enzyme-linked immunospecific assay. Activated M phi produced tumor cytolysis in a serum-free 16-hr 51Cr-release assay. The lysis of C-treated tumor cells was increased over targets treated with sera containing 10 mM EDTA, heat-inactivated mouse sera, or medium. In addition, C alone did not cause specific 51Cr release. M phi elicited by casein or PBS did not lyse any of the tumor targets tested. The increase in lysis was dependent on the dilution of serum used, and was strongly correlated with the amount of C3 detected on the tumor cells. The enhanced lysis was abrogated by incubating C3-bearing tumor cells with F(ab')2 fragments of a goat anti-mouse C3 antibody. C treatment did not alter the kinetics of tumor cell lysis, nor did it enhance the binding of the targets to effector cells. These results suggest that C may regulate M phi-mediated killing of tumor cells by increasing the lytic efficiency of M phi that are in contact with target-bound C3.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of recombinant immune interferon (IFN-gamma) on the expression and shedding of HLA antigens and of melanoma-associated antigens (MAA) by epidermal melanocytes was investigated by using serologic and immunochemical techniques. IFN-gamma enhances the expression and/or shedding of HLA class I antigens and of the cytoplasmic MAA defined by monoclonal antibody (MoAb) 465.12S and induces a slight reduction in the expression of the high m.w. melanoma-associated antigen (HMW-MAA). In agreement with the data in the literature, melanocytes incubated with IFN-gamma acquire HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP antigens. Contrary to previous information in the literature, the effect is not restricted to HLA class II antigens, since IFN-gamma also induces the expression of the 96-kDa MAA recognized by MoAb CL203. The effect of IFN-gamma on HLA class II antigens and 96-kDa MAA is dose and time dependent and is specific, because recombinant leukocyte interferon affects the expression of neither type of antigen. In spite of the expression of HLA class II antigens, IFN-gamma-treated melanocytes do not acquire the ability to stimulate the proliferation of allogeneic lymphocytes. HLA-DR antigens are more susceptible to induction by IFN-gamma than HLA-DQ and -DP antigens, since the percentage of melanocytes acquiring HLA-DQ and -DP antigens is lower than that acquiring HLA-DR antigens. Furthermore, the dose of IFN-gamma is higher and the time of incubation is longer to induce HLA-DQ and -DP antigens than to induce HLA-DR antigens. The differential susceptibility of HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP antigens as well as of melanocytes from various donors to the modulating effect of IFN-gamma may provide an explanation for the more frequent detection of HLA-DR than of HLA-DQ and -DP antigens in melanoma lesions and for the expression of HLA class II antigens by some, but not all, melanoma lesions.\r"

  ".U": "87110688\r", 
  ".W": "In this study, we examine the expression of IL 2 receptors on class I and class II MHC-restricted, influenza-specific murine T lymphocyte clones at early (day 3) and late (day 8 to day 12) times after antigenic stimulation. IL 2 receptor expression on the three clones examined increases to peak levels early and subsequently decays 10-fold to 50-fold during this time period, as evidenced by monoclonal anti-IL 2 receptor antibody binding. However, in IL 2 binding site studies these clones retain high levels of high-affinity IL 2 receptors (46 to 97% of day 3 levels) at the later time points, despite their inability to proliferate in response to IL 2 in the form of supernatant from Con A-stimulated rat splenocytes. Considerable clone to clone variation is seen in binding site affinity for IL 2, whereas no significant change in binding affinity for IL 2 is exhibited for a particular clone as a function of time after activation, suggesting little structural change in the IL 2 receptor with time. Contrary to this finding, Con A-stimulated murine splenocytes exhibit a sharp decay in IL 2 receptor expression reaching 25% of peak (day 3) levels by day 10 after stimulation by lectin, with a significant decrease in the average binding site affinity for IL 2 in the population. This change in affinity in the Con A-stimulated population may, however, reflect a selection with time for lymphocytes with lower affinity for IL 2. To elucidate where the potential block may be that prevents these CTL clones from proliferating in an IL 2-dependent manner, the ability of the cells to internalize bound IL 2 at late times after activation is examined. All three clones late after activation are able to internalize bound IL 2 with efficiencies equivalent to that seen at day 3. Additionally, two of the three clones late after activation are able to upregulate expression of IL 2 receptors in response to picamolar concentrations of IL 2, indicating that the receptors on these clones are able to transmit a signal, although insufficient to induce proliferation of the cells. These observations strongly suggest that for the CTL clones examined, at late times after antigenic stimulation, engagement of IL 2 by the high-affinity receptor is not a sufficient signal to induce cells to transit through the cell cycle.\r"

Tp103 is expressed on all proliferating normal T cells but is not present, or present only in low amounts, on resting peripheral blood T lymphocytes. Cross-linking of T cell and Fc receptor-positive accessory or target cells by an antibody against Tp103 leads to activation of the T cell. The proliferative response is due to an autocrine IL 2-dependent mechanism and can be inhibited by antibodies against the IL 2 receptor or by Cyclosporin A. Resting Tp103-positive T cells also respond to anti-Tp103. Although Tp103 is not linked to the antigen receptor/T3 complex, triggering via Tp103 can be inhibited by modulation of the T3 molecule. Thus, Tp103 defines a new antigen-independent pathway of T cell activation that can be regulated via other T cell surface structures.\r"

Although the specificity and restriction patterns of T lymphocytes are determined by the T cell receptor for antigen, CD4 might represent an additional \"interaction\" molecule that is required to strengthen the interaction between T cells, antigen, and antigen-presenting cells. In this manuscript, we have shown that the cell surface expression of CD4 is correlated with activation of T cells. Data presented in this paper have demonstrated, for the first time, that antigenic stimulation of human T cell clones caused a decrease in the expression of the CD4 marker (as well as to the CD3 marker) to about 50% of the constitutive level. As previously demonstrated, PMA caused modulation of CD4 and CD3, which suggested that phosphorylation by protein kinase C played a crucial role in the regulation of the expression of both markers. The parallel down-regulation of CD3 and CD4 after antigen stimulation suggested that both markers might be members of a multimolecular complex mediating T cell activation.\r"

Such mice failed to generate in vitro cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses that were dependent upon L3T4+ T helper cell (Th) function (e.g., anti-B6-TNP) but were capable of generating in vitro CTL responses that could be mediated by Lyt-2+ Th cells (anti-allo class I). When Th function was assayed directly by interleukin 2 (IL 2) secretion, class II GVH animals were found to be deficient in L3T4+ but not Lyt-2+ IL 2-secreting Th cells. This selective deficiency in L3T4+ Th function correlates with a selective decrease in class II GVH mice of host-derived derived L3T4+ T cells. In addition, it was found that the spleens of class II GVH mice contained cells capable of selectively suppressing L3T4+ Th function. In contrast, mice in which a class I + II GVH occurred were depleted of both L3T4+ and Lyt-2+ Th function as assessed by IL 2 production. The findings that class II GVH selectively depletes L3T4+ T cells and T cell functions are discussed with respect to the immune function of distinct T cell subsets in normal and diseased states.\r"

  ".W": "Two experimental situations have been studied, and the results provide evidence for a negative regulatory role for the low affinity interleukin 2 receptor (LA-IL 2R). The IL 2-dependent T helper cell line L-14, deprived of IL 2, becomes quiescent and expresses comparable numbers of high affinity IL 2R (HA-IL 2R) and LA-IL 2R. After activation by recombinant IL 2, this cell line preferentially expresses LA-IL 2R. The IL 2 responsiveness of the L-14 cell line was found to vary according to the ratio of LA-IL 2R to HA-IL 2R: the relative predominance of the LA-IL 2R coincides with a hyporeactivity of cells to IL 2. In contrast, a predominance of HA-IL 2R is accompanied by an increase in cellular IL 2 reactivity. Treatment of three IL 2-dependent T cell lines (L-14, HT-2, and C30.1) with limited amounts of recombinant IL 2 and moderate concentrations of anti-IL 2R monoclonal antibodies stimulates T cell growth. This treatment was shown to selectively diminish the expression of membrane LA-IL 2R. The stimulation was attributed to the decrease of expression of LA-IL 2R.\r"

The chemotactic peptide N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe caused a time- and concentration-dependent increase in diacylglycerol that was maximal at 4 min. Diacylglycerol returned toward basal levels by 15 min. The basal level of diacylglycerol was 290 +/- 25 pmol/10(7) cells (n = 36). Maximally effective concentrations of N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe and N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys increased diacylglycerol to 176% +/- 16 of basal (n = 8) and 198% +/- 15 of basal (n = 4), respectively. t-Boc-Phe-Leu-Phe-Leu-Phe, a competitive antagonist of formyl peptide receptor function, competitively inhibited the N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-induced diacylglycerol increase. Pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin abolished the stimulated rise in diacylglycerol, whereas depletion of extracellular Ca2+ markedly inhibited the increase. The Ca2+ ionophore A23187 stimulated a large (450% of basal) and persistent (greater than 30 min) increase in diacylglycerol. These data suggest that agents which raise intracellular Ca2+ levels in differentiated HL-60 cells produce a prolonged increase in cellular diacylglycerol which may activate protein kinase C.\r"

Products were identified and were quantified by using high-pressure liquid chromatography and ultraviolet spectroscopy. Under all conditions of product generation, both macrophages and monocytes generated predominantly (5S,12R)-dihydroxy-(6Z, 8E, 10E, 14Z)-eicosatetraenoic acid (leukotriene B4 (LTB4] and (5S)-hydroxy-(6E, 8Z, 11Z, 14Z) - eicosatetraenoic acid (5 - HETE), but, in each subject, macrophages invariably released greater amounts of LTB4 and 5-HETE than monocytes. In response to A23187, macrophages released a maximum of 183 +/- 96 pmol of LTB4 and 168 +/- 108 pmol of 5-HETE per 10(6) cells (mean +/- SEM), whereas monocytes released only 16 +/- 1 and 18 +/- 8 pmol per 10(6) cells of LTB4 and 5-HETE, respectively. After adding arachidonic acid, macrophages released a maximum of 52 +/- 21 pmol of LTB4 and 223 +/- 66 pmol of 5-HETE, whereas monocytes released no detectable products. The results suggest that mononuclear phagocyte maturation in the lung may be accompanied by an enhanced ability to generate 5-lipoxygenase products.\r"

Several molecular species of PAF ranging from C14:0 to C19:0 were detected in all of the cells studied. PAF produced by each cell type exhibited a unique pattern of molecular species distribution. Although C16:0 was the major PAF molecular species of rat PMN and RBL cells representing 96% and 85% of the total PAF, respectively, PAF from mice PMN contained 81% of C16:0, 10% of C18:1, and 6% of C18:0. Alternatively, A23187-stimulated guinea pig PMN yielded PAF molecular species 35% in C16:0, 35% in C17:0, 8% in C18:1, and 3% in C18:0. Small but significant differences in the PAF molecular species distribution of resting and ionophore stimulated cells were also observed. In contrast to the PAF molecular species composition, the precursor 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine of all the cell types was predominantly hexadecyl (C16:0) alkyl chain in the sn-1 position, representing 60 to 80% of the total 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine. Thus, these results not only indicate a high degree of selectivity for utilization of precursor substrates for PAF biosynthesis, but also demonstrate that the selectivity is species specific.\r"

E.1 did not bind to the surface membranes of lung or adult worms, or recognize secreted egg antigen in infected liver tissue. The E.1 epitope was present in the glycocalyx of cercariae, as well as on the syncytial membrane as determined by electron microscopy. Immunoprecipitation of iodinated surfaces of cercariae and schistosomula demonstrated E.1 binding to a high m.w. moiety in cercariae, which corresponds to the glycocalyx because it was not immunoprecipitated from schistosomula. In addition, a band at 38,000 daltons was immunoprecipitated from both cercariae and schistosomula. When compared with in vitro cultured parasites, schistosomula that were obtained from mice 1 to 24 hr after tail vein injection showed significant loss of E.1 binding. Consistent with the rapid loss of antigen in vivo, E.1 antibody was unable to passively transfer protection to naive mice when administered 5 days after cercarial challenge.\r"

  ".W": "Tissue fibrosis in schistosomiasis is largely responsible for the important morbidity that results from infection with the trematode worms, Schistosoma. Neither the migrating larval forms (cercariae) nor the intravascular adult worms appear to incite pathological responses that are important in chronic schistosomiasis. On the other hand, eggs deposited in tissue incite chronic granulomatous inflammatory responses that are the hallmark of infection and precede the onset of adjacent tissue fibrosis. We previously reported that products of the egg granulomas can stimulate a number of relevant responses in fibroblast cultures that in vivo would be expected to promote tissue fibrosis. We report here that the granulomas secrete factors that in vitro can stimulate collagen and fibronectin synthesis in fibroblasts. We determined that activity stimulating collagen synthesis is congruent to 10 Kd (gel filtration) with a pI of congruent to 5.5 (isoelectric focusing); additional activity is also detected in some other fractions (congruent to Kd; pI approximately 7.0). In contrast, the activity stimulating fibronectin synthesis was congruent to 22 Kd with a pI of 5.5. Activity was also present in fractions of 50 Kd with pI of approximately 7.5. Fibroblasts grown in granuloma supernatant-containing medium contained greater steady-state levels of specific mRNA coding for type I procollagen and fibronectin compared with cells cultured in unsupplemented medium. These observations support the hypothesis that biologically active molecules secreted by granuloma cells are instrumental in the initiation of tissue fibrosis in schistosomiasis.\r"

The availability of two monoclonal antibodies specific, respectively, for the VHT15 and VK21 D-E gene products allowed us to study, both in the selected and in the preimmune repertoire, the expression of VHT15-VK21 D-E pairs in several mouse strains. Our data establish, first, that even before antigen encounters B cells, clones utilize a highly biased repertoire of VH-VL combinations and, secondly, that the level of productive VH-VL pairing depends primarily on the \"allelic\" form of the relevant VH and VK genes. Furthermore, clonal analysis revealed that this asymmetry in Ig gene expression affects a large proportion of newly arising B cells. Together, these studies demand reconsideration of the current estimates of the available antibody repertoire size, and provide new insights for our understanding of the phenomenon of clonal dominance.\r"

Hybridomas were selected that produced 260 idiotype-positive antibodies, and their light chain mRNA were partially sequenced. (RF is an idiotype-negative strain, and sequencing was done without this selection.) All newly sequenced BALB/c, C57BL-Igha, DBA/2, A/J, or CE VK segments had a 100% nucleotide homology with the VKOx1 (H3) germline gene. This gene codes for one third of early BALB/c phenyloxazolone antibodies, and according to our results the same gene has a significant role in the early response of at least five strains of mice. Four RF hybridomas had identical nucleotide sequences, suggesting that they express a non-mutated nucleotide sequence of a new VK germ-line gene (VKOx2). This gene codes for a CDR1 which is two amino acids longer than the CDR1 coded by the VKOx1 gene, but otherwise the two genes are related (94.5% sequence homology). All but one of the 16 kappa chains studied had the J5 segment; this segment had the same sequence in all six strains. One RF antibody had the J4 segment the nucleotide sequence of which differs from the BALB/c J4 segment in two places. Three of the kappa chains had an extra long CDR3. Long and \"normal\" kappa chains were probably coded by the same pair of germ-line genes (VKOx1 and J5, or VKOx2 and J5). The length heterogeneity was probably caused by a lack of precision in VK-JK joining.\r"

To investigate the participation of the T gamma gene in functional T cells, we estimated its variable (V gamma) gene diversity among mature polyclonal T cells and assayed for in vivo selection of rearranged V gamma genes during the immune response. In this study, we present evidence that functionally mature, normal human T cells have rearranged their T gamma genes but display a limited range of gene rearrangement choices. In contrast to clonal T cell neoplasms, an invariant array of seven T gamma gene rearrangements was found to be proportionately distributed within normal polyclonal T cell populations, as well as in benign polyclonal T cell proliferations incited by a wide variety of pathological conditions. Findings presented here indicate that the likelihood of rearrangement of each human V gamma gene may be fixed. Lack of selection of V gamma genes during the mature T cell immune response implies a limited role of any single V gamma gene at this stage of T cell development.\r"

  ".W": "A small subpopulation (about 2%) of normal CD3+ human T lymphocytes lacks both CD4 and CD8 antigens. We have cloned these cells from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) obtained from healthy individuals and from a patient with severe combined immunodeficiency. Six out of seven CD3+4-8-clones exert strong cytolytic activity against a variety of so-called NK-susceptible and -nonsusceptible tumor target cells. Their target cell specificity spectrum can virtually be as wide as that of CD3-NK cell-derived clones, with strong lytic capacity. Some of these clones also exert antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), a characteristic of NK cell-derived clones but not of CD3+4+ or CD8+ mature T cell-derived clones. Such CD3+ T cell clones do not express the CD16 (IgG Fc receptor) antigen, but as we demonstrate here, the CD16 antigen can be identified on CD3+4-8-clones. Both ADCC activity and CD16 antigen expression are lower in CD3+4-8- than in CD3- NK cell clones. Lytic activity of mature CD3+4+ or CD8+ and CD3- NK cell clones can be augmented, respectively, by anti-CD3 or anti-CD16 monoclonal antibodies (MAb), but that of CD3+4-8- clones are augmented by both MAb. Lytic activity of CD3+4+ or CD8+ clones is considerably enhanced after 3 hr of incubation with recombinant IL 2, as found for CD3- NK cells. Enhancement of lytic activity of allospecific CD3+4+ or CD8+ clones requires 18 hr of incubation. Thus, CD3+4-8-16+ cells share several features with CD3- NK cells. However, they express the CD3 antigen, which is characteristic for CD4+ or CD8+ mature T cells. Our results also indicate that although CD3+4-8- clones react with five preparations of anti-CD3 MAb tested, these clones do not express a classical CD3+/Ti alpha, beta antigen receptor complex. This is suggested by the finding that the CD3+4-8- clones do virtually not express the common epitope of the T cell receptor alpha, beta-chains as identified by the WT31 MAb. These CD3+4-8- lymphocytes may represent functionally mature lymphocytes of a distinct T cell subpopulation having a particular immune function.\r"

LAK can also lyse autologous lymphoblasts that have been modified with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). In this study, we examined the surface markers of murine LAK precursors. It was found that depletion of Thy 1- or Lyt 2-bearing precursor cells abolished the ability of spleen cells to generate LAK against TNBS-self, but had no effect on the generation of LAK against tumor cells. Depletion of asialo-GM1 (AGM1)-bearing precursors abolished the generation of LAK against all target cells tested. Normal spleen cells were fractionated on a Percoll density gradient and two fractions were examined: fraction (Fxn) 3, which is enriched for NK activity but depleted of the ability to generate cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), and Fxn 5, which had no NK activity but was enriched for the ability to generate CTL. Both fractions were capable of generating LAK, although Fxn 5 required a relatively larger amount of interleukin 2 (IL 2). Upon examination of the surface markers of LAK precursors in these fractions it was found that the precursors in Fxn 3 giving rise to LAK against tumors were Thy-1-, Lyt-2-, AGM1+, whereas the precursors in Fxn 5 were Thy-1+, Lyt-2+, AGM1+. The precursors generating LAK against TNBS-self were Thy-1+, Lyt-2+, AGM1+ in both fractions. The time kinetics of LAK generation in both fractions were different, with Fxn 3 showing much earlier kinetics. These data delineate at least two different LAK precursors defined by their buoyant density, by their surface markers, and by their susceptible target cells. These data also may resolve the confusion in the literature regarding the phenotype of LAK precursors.\r"

We therefore studied systematically the effects of chronic intracutaneous administration of arachidonic acid, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), leukotriene B4 (LTB4), and 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) in guinea pigs, and describe previously unrecognized findings partly different from those reported in the past for short-term or topical application of these inflammatory mediators. Leukotriene B4 and 12-HETE led to massive histologic changes characteristic of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. These changes could be prevented by concomitant PGE2 administration. In epidermis, LTB4 and 12-HETE caused some spongiosis as well as hyperplasia and increased tritiated thymidine autoradiographic labeling index. Arachidonic acid and PGE2 alone had little effect. These data suggest that in addition to other inflammatory or hyperproliferative dermatoses, arachidonic acid metabolites formed via lipoxygenase pathways could play a major role in leukocytoclastic vasculitis, whereas PGs could exert a tissue-protective effect.\r"

Production of the cyclooxygenase products was inhibited by the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone. The stimulation appeared to be modulated by deesterification of arachidonic acid from the cellular lipids, presumably by phospholipase A2. Increased intracellular levels of Ca++ and phosphorylating activities that result from polyphosphoinositol turnover as well as phosphorylating activities independent of phosphatidylinositol turnover appear to be regulating phospholipase A2 hydrolysis of phospholipids.\r"

This factor, which is distinct from prostaglandins, epidermal cell-derived thymocyte activating factor (ETAF), and the well-known thymic hormones (thymulin, thymopoietin, and thymosin alpha 1) did not exhibit any interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, or IL-3 activity. It strongly inhibited in vitro lymphoproliferative responses of normal mouse spleen cells to phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A, and lipopolysaccharide. This dose-dependent phenomenon was associated with a suppression of IL-2 production rather than any toxic effect. It can be concluded that ELDIF, a product of human epidermal cells, which displays in vitro T-cell differentiation and regulatory activities, could be of major importance in vivo in the control of cutaneous inflammatory reactions.\r"

Exposure to L-[3H]serine resulted in labeling of the phospholipids phosphatidyl (Ptd) serine, Ptd ethanolamine, sphingomyelin, and, to a slight extent, Ptd choline. The time course of labeling suggested synthesis of Ptd serine was initiated; Ptd serine was converted to Ptd ethanolamine; little methylation of Ptd ethanolamine to form Ptd choline took place. Separation of nonradioactive phospholipids and phosphorus assay of individual lipids showed that serine-supplemented cells had only slightly increased content of Ptd serine and Ptd ethanolamine.

Following isotopic labeling with the precursors [3H]glucosamine and [35S]sulfate, GAGs were extracted from the keratinocytes into several operationally created compartments associated with the cells and extracellular matrix. Chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate accounted for the majority of the incorporated label in all preparations. Although total sulfated GAGs per culture increased from proliferative to differentiated conditions, GAG content normalized to the DNA content of the cultures demonstrated the reverse trend. This was particularly evident for the chondroitin sulfates, which declined 60-70% in the differentiated cultures. Furthermore, label incorporation into chondroitin and heparan sulfates revealed a relative compartmental shift to a trypsin-accessible site upon keratinocyte differentiation. An analysis of heparan sulfate structure by characterization of the oligosaccharide products resulting from low pH nitrous acid deaminative degradation provided evidence that the parent material from differentiated keratinocytes contains a larger region of N-sulfated glucosamine residues unassociated with ester sulfate groups. The correlation of variations in GAG content and compartmentalization with the growth condition of human keratinocytes constitutes evidence that this heterogeneous group of cell surface-associated carbohydrates is involved in some aspect of cell function associated with growth control or differentiation. Furthermore, the apparent differences in heparan sulfate primary structure indicate that there is structure-function specificity to this association.\r"

Since the CD4 molecule has been implicated as a receptor structure for HTLV-III/LAV (human T-cell leukemia virus/lymphadenopathy-associated virus), we asked whether LC from HTLV-III/LAV-seropositive individuals display signs of HTLV-III/LAV infection. In skin biopsies from 7/40 HTLV-III/LAV-infected persons (1 asymptomatic carrier, 2 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related complex and 4 patients with AIDS), LC were the only epidermal cells to react with a monoclonal antibody specific for the HTLV-III core protein p17. A varying percentage of p17+ LC were morphologically altered with blunt dendrites and poorly demarcated cellular contours. In one of these biopsies, the presence of LC-associated viral particles characteristic of HTLV-III/LAV as well as cytopathic changes in approximately one-third of the LC population were demonstrated by electron microscopy. These results strongly suggest that LC may harbor HTLV-III/LAV. The infection of LC with this retrovirus may have deleterious consequences for the immunologic functions of this cell system and may thus contribute to both the acquisition of immunodeficiency and the infectious and neoplastic complications of AIDS.\r"

  ".W": "Enzyme immunoassay (EIA), immunodiffusion (ID), and complement fixation (CF) tests for antibody to the A antigen of Blastomyces dermatitidis were assessed in 47 patients in an epidemic of blastomycosis and in 89 control subjects with lower respiratory tract illness. Antibody was detected by EIA, ID, and CF in 77%, 28%, and 9% of the patients, respectively. EIA titers ranged from 1:8-1:512 (median titer, 1:128). Antibody detected by ID or CF was always detectable by EIA. Antibody was detected by EIA 13 days after illness onset, and the peak seroprevalence rate and geometric mean titer occurred 50-70 days after onset. Antifungal therapy produced a significant decline in antibody titer by approximately six months after onset. Seven (8%) control subjects had detectable antibody, six had EIA titers of 1:8, and one had a titer of 1:16. The specificities for EIA, ID, and CF were 92%, 100%, and 100%, respectively. The EIA provides a significant advance in serodiagnostic testing for blastomycosis and can be used in an outbreak setting as an epidemiological tool to identify acute B. dermatitidis infection; titers greater than or equal to 1:32 strongly support the diagnosis, whereas titers of 1:8 or 1:16 are suggestive.\r"

Human sera from residents of various regions of Sweden were examined for antibody to Puumala virus, and the incidence of NE was determined. Small mammals were captured at locations throughout Sweden and were examined for antibody to Puumala virus and for antigen. The human serosurvey found the highest prevalence rates and the highest incidence rates in northern Sweden. The bank vole was found to be the most-abundant rodent, as well as the species most frequently positive for antibody. Antibody-positive voles were restricted to the northern two-thirds of the country, an area corresponding to that where most human disease was noted. These results suggest that the bank vole is the principal host of Puumala virus in Sweden and clearly establish the region near 64 degrees N as highly endemic for NE in humans.\r"

The case-fatality rate in group B disease was significantly associated with serotype 2b (B:2b) strains (P = 0.03). Age and year of admission did not account for this association. Septicemia was also found more frequently with B:2b than with other B serotypes, but neurological complications and sequelae were not. Neither C:2a nor W:2a was associated with a higher case-fatality rate, with more cases of septicemia, or with more sequelae than were other C or W serotypes. We concluded that the 2b antigen, although not likely a causal factor, is a virulence marker among group B strains and that the protective effect of a vaccine containing this protein (among others) needs to be studied.\r"

Treatment was given 24 hr (\"early\") or 48 hr (\"late\") after infection. With early treatment the dose-response relationship between the drug concentration and the diminution in bacterial counts in the vitreous humor was linear with all three drugs. By contrast, with late treatment the same vitreal concentrations had no significant effect on bacterial counts. The failure of late treatment was not due to an increased rate of clearance of drugs from the eyes and could not be reproduced with a similar bacterial inoculum in vitro. Bacteria cultured from treated eyes were fully sensitive when plated directly onto drug-containing agar. The poor bactericidal effect of late treatment may in part be related to transient phenotypic alterations in the bacteria in response to changes in the environment of infection such as hypoxia, low pH, and exhaustion of critical bacterial nutrients.\r"

Forty-two patients undergoing ovulation induction with human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG)/hCG for in vitro fertilization were studied. A total of 192 cervical scores was obtained together with plasma estradiol levels and pelvic sonography. hCG was given based on estradiol and ultrasound results without knowing the cervical score. An independent decision to give hCG was made based on the cervical score only following a mean of 2.5 days of a cervical score of 9-12 without the examiner's knowledge of estradiol and ultrasound results. This decision was theoretic and was not considered for the actual timing of hCG. In 16 (38%) of the cases this decision coincided with that based on estradiol and ultrasound. In 24 (57%) of the cases there was a 1-day gap. A direct correlation was found among the cervical score, the plasma estradiol concentration, and the mean diameter of the two leading follicles (P less than 0.001). The overall distribution of the cervical score grouped according to estradiol levels (less than 200, 201-400, and greater than 401 pg/ml) was significantly different (P less than 0.001). The proportion of \"mature\" cervical scores (score of 11-12) in the three different estradiol groups was 15.6, 34.5, and 68.0%, respectively. In conclusion, independent decisions to give hCG based on cervical score or estradiol and ultrasound were coincident +/- 1 day in 95% of the cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After 2 days, CO2 reactivity began to reappear, but even after 1 year restitution was not complete. The prolonged (though partly reversible) attenuation of CO2 responsiveness suggests that ischaemia is followed by a long-lasting state of haemodynamic imbalance, which may be responsible for the slow progress of post-ischaemic recovery processes.\r"

  ".U": "87111672\r", 
  ".W": "One hundred ninety-two patients with previously untreated metastatic cancer (102 non-small-cell lung cancer [NSCLC]; 90 colorectal cancer) were randomized to receive either ad lib nutritional intake (control group) or specific nutritional intervention during a 12-week study period when chemotherapy was administered. Those patients randomized to nutritional interventions were counselled to take oral nutrients with caloric intake equal to 1.7 to 1.95 times their basal energy expenditure, depending on their pretreatment nutritional status (\"standard\" group). An augmented group was counselled to have a caloric intake equivalent to that of the standard group but with 25% of calories provided as protein and additional supplements of zinc and magnesium. Counselling increased caloric intake in both tumor types but reduced weight loss in the short term only for lung cancer patients. Ninety-three NSCLC patients were evaluable for tumor response to vindesine and cisplatin. Overall, only 20.4% of the patients responded, and there were no significant differences in response rates, median time to progression, or overall duration of survival between the nutrition intervention groups and the control group. The tumor response rate to time-sequenced 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and methotrexate in the 81 evaluable patients with colorectal cancer was only 14.8%, and no significant differences in tumor response rates were noted between the three groups. Furthermore, the median time to progression and overall duration of survival were not different for the control, standard, and augmented groups. Nutritional interventions using dietary counselling had no impact on the percent of planned chemotherapy dose administered, the degree of toxicity experienced by patients, or the frequency of treatment delays. A multivariate prognostic factor analysis demonstrated that for lung cancer, the percent of weight loss, serum albumin concentration, and presence of liver metastases were significant (P less than .05) and independent prognostic variables for survival duration. For colorectal cancer, serum albumin, alkaline phosphatase, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, and percent targeted caloric intake (TCI) were significant independent predictors of survival duration.\r"

No patient had symptoms of cardiac disease. All were normotensive. All patients had a normal cardiothoracic ratio. There were no abnormalities of voltage or rhythm in the ECGs. The left ventricular end diastolic volume was increased in 19.2% of patients, none of whom had evidence of impaired left ventricular function. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was increased in 15.3% of patients. No patient had a decreased LVEF. Pericardial thickening was demonstrated on echocardiograms from 12 of 28 patients (42.9%). Thickening was more frequent among those patients observed for 72 or more months (47.1%; eight of 17) than among those with shorter periods of follow-up (36.4%; four of 11). This study demonstrates that cardiac dysfunction is an infrequent sequela of mediastinal irradiation following treatment using an equally weighted, anterior-posterior technique. Longitudinal study of these patients will be necessary to determine the clinical significance and evolution of the occult pericardial thickening that was identified.\r"

Four patients died as a consequence of severe, overwhelming infections or progressive disease during their period of aplasia. Of the 18 evaluable patients, a complete response (CR) was achieved in three patients and a partial response (PR) in ten patients for an overall response rate of 72%. The median duration of response was 14 weeks. Other nonhematologic toxicities included nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, skin rash, and cardiomyopathy. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of thiotepa was 700 mg/m2 or 6 mg/kg for three doses. Although there are substantial toxicities associated with this regimen, high-dose thiotepa and cyclophosphamide produce high response rates in patients with disseminated cancer.\r"

Intracarotid infusions of normal saline and hyperosmotic mannitol were then made, followed by intravenous injection of Evans blue dye plus albumin (EB, MW 68,000), horseradish peroxidase (HRP, MW 40,000), and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU, MW 130). Uptake of the drug and the consistency of drug levels in the normal brain and tumor varied widely among these three agents. Both EB and HRP penetrated the brain tumors but did not stain the normal brain tissues. After BBB opening, penetration of EB and HRP into the normal brain was drastically increased; however, the uptake of EB and HRP in the tumor was not increased. The concentration of 5-FU in the tumor was higher than that in the serum and, although it increased 1.5-fold after BBB opening, the increase was not statistically significant. Conversely, there was a progressive increase in concentrations of 5-FU in the tumor-free brain regions (p less than 0.05). These observations suggest that an intracarotid infusion of hyperosmotic mannitol may increase neurotoxicity because it allows greater delivery of anticancer drugs into the normal brain tissue than into the tumor tissues.\r"

The technique uses liquid scintillation counting to record 14CO2 accumulation on a fluor-impregnated filter paper within a double-chambered scintillation vial that also houses the bacterial growth medium. We have successfully identified and corrected the major causes for a variably low detection efficiency, and also established the optimum mixture of reagents for the detection system. Incorporation of Triton X-100 into the scintillation fluid used for the detector reduced the variability between identical assays in a single batch from 50% to 5%, and, in conjunction with an increase in the scintillator concentration, raised the counting efficiency from 30% to 70-88%. The response of the improved detector is linear over a wide range of count-rates. Another significant modification was the interchange of growth and detector chambers. Overall, a 40-fold increase in count-rate during the exponential phase of bacterial growth was obtained by improving 14CO2 detection efficiency, increasing the rate of 14CO2 transfer from liquid to gas phases and enlarging the growth supporting capacity of the detector system. The minimum detection time for bacterial growth was shortened and the exponential phase of bacterial proliferation was lengthened by at least 2 hr. High counting efficiency, precision, and linearity make the improved detector a sensitive and reliable tool for radiometry of bacterial growth and metabolism.\r"

Such a high dose would seriously compromise the 15O-CO2 inhalation method for positron emission tomographic (PET) measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF). In order to verify these results, we have assayed 15O activity in the tracheal region of three volunteers by PET during inhalation of 15O-CO2 and 15O-O2. Using methods similar to those of the above authors for estimating absorbed dose in the tracheal mucosa, we have obtained a value of 14-38 rad, which is more in keeping with 3-5 rad found by Bigler et al. from direct assay of mucus and saliva. We conclude that the 15O-CO2 inhalation method is a safe and practical means of measuring CBF by PET.\r"

The average residence time for [99mTc]DTPA in total body, less bladder contents, was only 65% of the MIRD value. However, despite this difference, the dosimetry is similar in both cases largely owing to the influence of radioactivity in bladder contents. Approximately 2-3% of the administered radioactivity was retained in the body for a time that was long relative to the physical half-life of 99mTc, and probably reflects a small amount of protein binding of the DTPA preparation.\r"

Compared with their normal intake, during the week of low carbohydrate intake there was a rise in the level of fasting plasma 3-hydroxybutyrate from 0.12 +/- 0.07 (mean +/- SD) to 1.01 +/- 0.40 mmol/L(P less than 0.01, paired t-test); a fall in serum bicarbonate from 26.2 +/- 0.75 to 25.0 +/- 1.41 mmol/L (P less than 0.05) and in serum chloride from 107 +/- 1.3 to 105 +/- 1.8 mmol/L (P less than 0.05). Serum urea rose from 4.3 +/- 0.71 to 5.7 +/- 0.70 mmol/L (P less than 0.01), and serum uric acid from 0.34 +/- 0.08 to 0.39 +/- 0.10 mmol/L (P less than 0.05). Functional residual capacity was increased from 2.07 +/- 0.35 to 2.26 +/- 0.34 L (P less than 0.01). Respiratory gas exchange ratio fell from 0.81 +/- 0.05 to 0.75 +/- 0.04 (P less than 0.05) and partial pressure of expired carbon dioxide reduced from 22 +/- 3.3 to 21 +/- 3.1 mmHg (P less than 0.05). There was a reduction in endogenous carbon dioxide production and arterial carbon dioxide tension. An analysis of ambulatory electroencephalogram showed that REM latency increased from 66 +/- 8 to 111 +/- 38 min (P less than 0.05), with no significant changes in sleep time and stages. These studies show that a low carbohydrate isoenergetic diet is tolerable, influences sleep behavior, reduces carbon dioxide production and respiratory gas exchange ratio, and may be therapeutically useful in patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure.\r"

Mitochondria prepared from these cells revealed two types of respiratory chain defect. In four patients the deficient activity was present in NADH-coenzyme Q reductase (14% to 21% of controls), and in six the deficiency was in cytochrome c oxidase (21% to 28% of controls). The four patients with NADH-coQ reductase deficiency presented early with lactic acidosis, respiratory failure, anorexia, and hypotonia; all four died within 7 months. The group with cytochrome oxidase deficiency had a somewhat later (18 months to 2 years of age) presentation with milder lactic acidemia, but also with hypotonia and anorexia. They had delayed development, beginning to walk and talk at 18 to 24 months, and then slowly regressed. Although an investigation of central nervous system disorders in this latter group has not been possible, the clinical progression fits into the broad category of Leigh disease. We conclude that in these two groups respiratory chain defects can be detected and localized by the use of skin fibroblast cultures.\r"

To relate differences in urethral microflora to sexual activity, 42 sexually active patients with a negative FPU were compared with the never sexually active group. The profile of anaerobic, but not aerobic, bacteria isolated from the urethra was related to the presence or absence of previous sexual activity. Mycoplasma species and Ureaplasma urealyticum were isolated from sexually active patients only, and may be markers of sexual activity in adolescent boys. Of the 32 patients with FPU evidence of urethritis, 22 (69%) had cultures positive for Chlamydia trachomatis, and an additional three (9%) had cultures positive for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The findings in sexually active patients with a positive FPU were otherwise similar to those of sexually active patients without evidence of urethritis. C. trachomatis appears to be the most important agent of urethritis among adolescent boys with a positive FPU.\r"

ADO concentrations of 1, 10 and 50 microM decreased perfusion pressure by 19, 42 and 57 mm Hg, respectively, from a control (saline infusion) perfusion pressure of 110 mm Hg. Sympathetic vasoconstrictor responses were attenuated only at 50 microM ADO. Sympathetic responses during 1 and 10 microM ADO infusion were the same as during infusion of 10 and 100 microM nitroglycerine, which produced the same degree of vasodilation as 1 and 10 microM ADO, respectively. Except for greater vasodilator potency, 2-chloroadenosine infusions produced effects similar to ADO. Infusion of hydralize produced concentration-dependent decreases in control perfusion pressure and sympathetic vasoconstrictor responses. These results indicate that intra-arterial administration of ADO or one of its stable analogs (2-chloroadenosine) does not cause inhibition of sympathetic vasoconstrictor responses except at concentrations that cause nearly maximal vasodilation.\r"

To evaluate its effect on the activity of disaccharidases and on metabolic control, groups of obese diabetic mice (C57BLKsJ db/db) were given the drug for periods of 3, 7 and 84 days as a drug food mixture (5 or 10 mg/100 g of food). Nondiabetic mice of the same strain were dosed for 3 and 7 days. The drug did not influence body growth, food intake or fasting blood glucose. However, urine glucose excretion was significantly decreased at the higher dose in the diabetic mice. The drug had no effect on the protein content of jejunum (proximal and middle thirds) or ileum (distal third) of the small intestine. The activity of sucrase and maltase was significantly decreased in practically all segments of the small intestine in both diabetic and nondiabetic mice. These changes were evident after 3 days of drug administration. Lactase was not affected by the drug. The mechanism underlying these changes, although unclear, is of significant interest and deserves further investigation.\r"

Although at different concentrations it has been reported to induce either immunosuppression or immune stimulation, its effects upon immediate hypersensitivity reactions are largely unknown. Because purine metabolism appears to be important in mast cell secretion, the effects of ribavirin on mouse bone marrow-derived mast cell functions were investigated. When ribavirin was added to mast cells at the time of stimulation with A23187 or specific antigen, no effect on the release of beta-hexosaminidase, a preformed mediator, was evident. However, mast cells cultured in 1 to 20 microM ribavirin for 1 to 7 days exhibited dose- and time-dependent inhibitions of stimulated beta-hexosaminidase and leukotriene C4 releases without altering mast cell mediator content. This inhibition occurred even when ribavirin had no effect on cell growth. A concomitant decrease in antigen-challenged mast cell intracellular Ca concentration was also observed after ribavirin treatment. Chronic ribavirin exposure in vitro inhibits mast cell secretory processes stimulated by both immunoglobulin E- and nonimmunoglobulin E-related signals. Its precise mechanism of action and any potential efficacy as an antiallergic agent remain to be elucidated.\r"

The EEG was analyzed by power spectral analysis and a parameter (spectral edge frequency) chosen to quantitate the narcotic-induced EEG slowing. An inhibitory sigmoid Emax pharmacodynamic model related spectral edge frequency to narcotic serum concentrations. The dose requirement of fentanyl or alfentanil decreased significantly with increasing age (a 50% decrease from age 20 to 89). No age-related changes in the pharmacokinetic parameters were found. Brain sensitivity (as determined by EEG changes) did decrease significantly with age. Thus, the decreased dose requirement in the elderly had a pharmacodynamic explanation, using the EEG as a measure of narcotic drug effect.\r"

  ".W": "Behavioral responses to D1 and D2-dopamine agonists are enhanced when these agonists are administered systemically to 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats. In the present investigation, microinjection of SKF-38393, a D1-dopamine agonist, into the nucleus accumbens of adult rats lesioned as neonates with 6-OHDA produced a dose-related increase in locomotor activity that was enhanced markedly compared to control. LY-171555, a D2-agonist, elicited less locomotor activity than did SKF-38393 after microinjection into this site. Administration of SKF-38393 or LY-171555 into the nucleus accumbens did not increase locomotion in unlesioned rats at the doses administered to lesioned animals. In adult-6-OHDA-lesioned rats, microinjection of SKF-38393 into the nucleus accumbens also increased locomotion more than did LY-171555. As described previously, systemic administration of SKF-38393 produced little locomotion in adult-6-OHDA-lesioned rats, whereas LY-171555 produced a markedly enhanced response. Administration of SKF-38393 or LY-171555 into the caudate nucleus of neonatally and adult-6-OHDA-lesioned rats produced negligible locomotor activity, but did induce stereotypic behaviors similar to those observed after systemic treatment with these drugs. Stereotypic behaviors occurred to a greater degree in the 6-OHDA-lesioned rats than in unlesioned controls. A regional specificity for certain behaviors induced by dopamine agonist administration was observed. In spite of the enhanced behavioral responses of D1 and D2-dopamine agonists after microinjection into the brain of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, binding of [3H]spiperone (D2-receptor antagonist ligand) and [3H]SCH 23390 (D1-receptor antagonist ligand) to tissue from striatum and nucleus accumbens was not altered significantly. In contrast to this lack of change in binding characteristics in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, blockade of dopaminergic transmission with haloperidol treatment caused an elevation of [3H]spiperone binding sites in striatum without affecting affinity for the site. However, chronic haloperidol treatment did not alter significantly [3H]SCH 23390 binding to striatal membranes. These latter findings suggest that chronic dopamine receptor blockade need not produce the same adaptive mechanisms as destruction of dopamine-containing neurons. Thus, a change in receptor characteristics as measured by dopamine antagonist binding does not account for the behavioral supersensitivity observed after D1- and D2-dopamine agonist administration to neonatally or adult-6-OHDA-treated rats.\r"

  ".W": "Amphetamine, 10(-7) M or greater, evoked the release of [3H]dopamine ([3H]DA) and inhibited subsequent K+-evoked [3H]DA release from striatal synaptosomes superfused at a flow rate (1 ml/min) that prevented reuptake. Amphetamine inhibited the K+-evoked release of [3H]DA to a lesser extent in striatal slices or in synaptosomes superfused at a flow rate (0.35 ml/min) that allowed reuptake. The observed decrease in amphetamine inhibition of K+-evoked release was primarily due to amphetamine blocking [3H]DA reuptake. Interneuronal interactions may account for some of the inhibitory effects of amphetamine on K+-evoked release in the slice. Inhibition of K+-evoked release from either slices or synaptosomes was still evident when 10(-6) M amphetamine was removed from the superfusion buffer and the spontaneous release had returned to control levels. The presence of Ca++ during amphetamine exposure was required for subsequent inhibition of K+-evoked release in synaptosomes. Amphetamine in the presence of Ca++ did not affect the subsequent release of [3H]DA evoked by the Ca++ ionophore, A23187. Therefore, amphetamine inhibition of the K+-evoked release of [3H]DA cannot be explained by prior depletion of Ca++-releasable pools. Nifedipine, 1 microM, failed to block either the Ca++-dependent release of [3H]DA or the inhibition of K+-evoked release by amphetamine. However, 1 mM cobalt inhibited the Ca++-dependent release of [3H]DA by amphetamine and antagonized the inhibition of K+-evoked release after amphetamine exposure. This suggests that amphetamine may open voltage-dependent Ca++ channels sensitive to cobalt but not nifedipine. Amphetamine may desensitize these voltage-dependent Ca++ channels and inhibit their activation by K+ depolarization.\r"

  ".W": "Effects of K+, ethanol and norepinephrine on the binding kinetics of ouabain to (Na+,K+)-adenosine triphosphatase in beef brain microsomes were examined. K+ reduced the rate and apparent affinity for ouabain binding markedly. Whereas ethanol and norepinephrine themselves inhibited ouabain binding slightly, they stimulated binding in the presence of K+. Norepinephrine enhanced the effect of ethanol. Dissociation of ouabain was biphasic, with fast and slow components corresponding to high and low apparent affinity. About 65% of the enzyme had high affinity, regardless of conditions. Norepinephrine and ethanol had differential effects on the rate of dissociation from high and low affinity enzyme, however. Alpha receptor blockade generally prevented the effects of norepinephrine. These results show that, although norepinephrine and ethanol have a modest effect on the amount of enzyme that can bind ouabain, their main effect on (Na+,K+)-adenosine triphosphatase is to antagonize the binding of K+ to its allosteric site that inhibits ouabain binding. The data support the hypothesis that ouabain binds rapidly to a K+-insensitive form of phosphorylenzyme or to its dephosphorylated analog and dissociates rapidly from E1.\r"

  ".W": "In an experimental model in which cultured endothelial cells (EC) and platelets were incubated with autologous plasma, we investigated the pharmacological modulations by isosorbide nitrates (ISN) [isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) + 2-isosorbide mononitrate (2-ISMN) + 5-ISMN] of the EC-induced inhibition of platelet aggregation; and the associated changes in prostanoid profile of these mixed EC-platelet suspensions. ISDN antiplatelet activities were found to be magnified profoundly by EC, being dependent upon both ISDN concentration and EC number, e.g., 5.10(-5) M ISDN in the presence of 2.10(4) cells, fully arrested ADP-induced aggregation, whereas the same ISDN concentration induced 30% inhibition in control platelet activities. In contrast, there were no significant changes in 2- and 5-ISMN antiaggregating properties, whether incubated in the presence or absence of EC. Thromboxane B2 accumulated noticeably after aggregation, whereas 6-keto-prostaglandin (PG) F1 alpha and PGE2 accumulated poorly in the medium. In the presence of EC, thromboxane B2 accumulation fell in parallel to the extent of aggregation, whereas 6-keto-PGF2 alpha and PGE2 accumulated in the medium. Aspirin-treated, washed ECs still inhibited platelet aggregation. ISDN was the only ISN capable of inducing PG-accumulation profile changes. These results demonstrate the existence of an endothelium-dependent ISDN antiplatelet activity. Furthermore, this effect is specific to ISDN not being shown by its mononitrate metabolites. These results suggest that PG accumulation changes may be a consequence rather than a cause of the inhibition of platelet activity by (ISDN-stimulated) EC.\r"

  ".W": "SR 95191 [3-(2-morpholino-ethyl-amino)-4-cyano-6-phenyl-pyridazine], a novel compound, has been shown in preliminary experiments to inhibit type A monoamine oxidase (MAO). This report describes the activities of SR 95191 in behavioral experiments in mice and rats and shows that SR 95191 has the profile of a selective type A MAO inhibitor (MAOI). Moreover, SR 95191 also possesses dopamine (DA) stimulant properties. The activities of SR 95191 were compared to those of the MAOIs moclobemide, clorgyline, pargyline and l-deprenyl, as well as to those of the antidepressant drugs imipramine, nomifensine and indalpine and to those of the DAergic drugs (+)-amphetamine and apomorphine. SR 95191 p.o. antagonized the effects of reserpine in mice and rats, decreased immobility in the mouse despair test, antagonized haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats and potentiated 5-hydroxytryptophan in mice and rats with an overall potency which was half that of imipramine. SR 95191, like moclobemide, did not potentiate yohimbine-induced lethality and did not antagonize oxotremorine-induced tremor. Like selective type A MAOIs, SR 95191 potentiated 5-hydroxytryptophan-induced tremor without affecting beta-phenethylamine-induced stereotypies in mice. SR 95191 did not antagonize 3-hydroxy-4-methyl-alpha-phenylethylamine-induced hyperthermia. Like all DA stimulant drugs, SR 95191 induced stereotypies in rats, which were blocked by haloperidol and alpha-methylparatyrosine, and induced contralateral turning in mice with a unilateral striatal 6-hydroxydopamine lesion. Based on these results, it is postulated that SR 95191 has a unique profile of activity combining the properties of a selective type A MAO inhibitor and those of an atypical DAergic drug.\r"

The MAOI activity of SR 95191 was examined in the rat brain, liver and duodenum and compared to that of clorgyline, harmaline, l-deprenyl, moclobemide and cimoxatone. In vitro, SR 95191 selectively inhibited MAO-A and was less potent than cimoxatone, clorgyline and harmaline, but was more potent than moclobemide. Ex vivo, SR 95191 also preferentially inhibited MAO-A in the brain and was 6 and 13 times less potent than cimoxatone and moclobemide, respectively. Like all MAO-A inhibitors, SR 95191 in vivo caused a dose-dependent increase in striatal 3-methoxytyramine, dopamine, serotonin and in hypothalamic norepinephrine contents. A concomitant decrease in deaminated metabolites was observed. SR 95191 inhibited peripheral MAO activity in liver and duodenum. In brain, liver and duodenum, MAO inhibition induced by SR 95191 was short-lasting. Repeated dosing for 14 days did not enhance MAO-A inhibition. Like all reversible MAOIs, SR 95191 antagonized the long-lasting MAO-A inhibition induced by clorgyline. Finally, SR 95191 did not affect monoamine uptake either in vitro or in vivo and did not interact in vitro with a variety of neurotransmitter or drug receptor sites. Based on these results it is postulated that SR 95191 is a selective and reversible type A MAOI of medium potency, which may be of therapeutic benefit in depressed patients.\r"

A dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure and heart rate was induced by intrathecal injections of clonidine (0.3-3 micrograms), at the T6-T7 level. Guanabenz (3-30 micrograms) and an azepine derivative B-HT 920 (1-3 micrograms) also reduced blood pressure and heart rate. In contrast, an imidazolidine derivative St 587 (10 micrograms) was ineffective. The clonidine-induced hypotensive effect was antagonized by yohimbine but not by prazosin. Yohimbine (3-10 micrograms) alone caused an increase in blood pressure and heart rate while only a weak hypotenion occurred with prazosin (10 micrograms). Pretreatment with intrathecal 6-hydroxydopamine (50 micrograms X 2) did not impair the hypotensive action of clonidine (1 microgram) whereas the hypertensive effect of yohimbine was reduced markedly by this treatment. When injected i.v. or intrathecally at the C1-C2 level, clonidine (1 microgram) produced only a slight decrease in blood pressure. It is concluded that, in rat spinal cord, alpha-2 adrenoceptors located postsynaptically are involved in blood pressure control. Endogenous catecholamines, especially norepinephrine in the spinal cord seem to activate tonically the alpha-2 adrenoceptors.\r"

The authors investigated whether ethanol and its metabolites affect the vascular release of prostacyclin, a potent vasodilator, and whether such an effect might be modified by chronic alcohol consumption. Aortic rings from rats fed Chow ad libitum or pair-fed liquid diets containing either ethanol (36% of energy) or isocaloric carbohydrate for 4 to 5 weeks were incubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate supplemented with saturating amounts of arachidonate (10-20 microM) in the presence of ethanol (10-100 mM), acetaldehyde (10-100 microM) or acetate (1.25-5 mM). Prostacyclin was measured by the radioimmunoassay of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha. Acetaldehyde produced a concentration-dependent stimulation of prostacyclin production both in alcohol-fed and control rats, whereas acetate did not. This effect was associated with increased conversion of arachidonate (either exogenous or released with A23187) and of prostaglandin endoperoxide H2 to prostacyclin. Ethanol did not affect prostacyclin release in control rats, but, in aortas from alcohol-fed animals, 50 mM ethanol did stimulate prostacyclin formation. These effects may contribute to the cardiovascular responses associated with high blood acetaldehyde levels in flushers and with high ethanol levels in alcoholics. In conclusion, acetaldehyde is a potent stimulant of vascular prostacyclin production. This effect is due, at least in part, to enhanced activity of prostacyclin synthase. Ethanol acquires such a stimulatory effect on prostacyclin formation after chronic alcohol consumption.\r"

Previous studies of tracheal muscle showed carbachol concentration-response curves for contraction and myosin phosphorylation were superposable. In contrast, there was a striking difference in the Ca++ sensitivities of tension and myosin phosphorylation when Ca++ concentration-response curves were constructed in the presence of 10(-7) M carbachol. Significant phosphorylation (greater than 0.3 moles phosphate/mole 20,000 dalton myosin light chain) was observed in the absence of active tension. In the present study, carbachol (10(-7) and 10(-6) M) and serotonin (10(-5) M) also induced significant myosin phosphorylation in low Ca++ solutions (0-0.025 mM CaCl2) without proportional increases in tension. K+ depolarization in Ca++-free physiological salt solution (60 mM KCl, 10(-6) M atropine) yielded phosphorylation not significantly different from basal levels. All stimulants induced active stress after readmission of Ca. The Ca++ dependence curve for myosin phosphorylation in muscles stimulated with carbachol was shifted up and to the left of the force curve. Atropine (10(-6) M) significantly reduced phosphorylation induced by carbachol in Ca++-free solutions, as did 3 X 10(-6) M nifedipine and 10 mM ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid. Phorbol 12-myristate, 13-acetate or phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate did not increase basal phosphorylation or phosphorylation in low Ca++ solutions, suggesting that protein kinase C did not phosphorylate myosin in this case. Myosin phosphorylation under these conditions is not sufficient to support contraction, and is reduced by treatments that decrease Ca++ entry.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Two groups of monkeys were trained to respond under a fixed-interval schedule of food presentation. In one group, responding was suppressed (punished) by superimposing a fixed-ratio schedule of response-produced shock. Dose-effect curves were determined for all three drugs by administering cumulative doses i.v. during timeout periods that preceded sequential components of the fixed-interval schedule. Low and intermediate doses of CGS 9896 (0.03-3.0 mg/kg), lorazepam (0.03-0.3 mg/kg) or zopiclone (0.1-1.0 mg/kg) produced dose-related increases in the rates of both suppressed and nonsuppressed responding. The maximal increases in response rates produced by CGS 9896 were usually less than those produced by either lorazepam or zopiclone. Pretreatment with the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 antagonized the increases in suppressed and nonsuppressed response rates produced normally by intermediate doses of CGS 9896, lorazepam or zopiclone, suggesting that the rate-increasing effects of the three drugs are mediated similarly. CGS 9896 was studied additionally for antagonist activity by administering selected doses before lorazepam or zopiclone. Pretreatment with a high dose of CGS 9896 (5.0 mg/kg) antagonized the rate-increasing effects of both lorazepam and zopiclone, suggesting that CGS 9896 has antagonist effects in addition to its agonist effects at benzodiazepine recognition sites.\r"

Both 2-MTTP and 1-methyl-4-(3-thienyl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine were like MPTP in being potent, competitive inhibitors of MAO-A (MAO type A) and weak, noncompetitive inhibitors of MAO-B (MAO type B) in vitro. 2-MTTP resulted in persistent depletion of striatal dopamine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid 1 week after the last of four daily injections to mice although 2-MTTP was less than one-fourth as potent as MPTP. The other isomer, 1-methyl-4-(3-thienyl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, failed to deplete dopamine or its metabolites in mouse striatum. Dopamine and its metabolites were also depleted in mouse nucleus accumbens by 2-MTTP and by MPTP; however, norepinephrine in frontal cortex was depleted by MPTP but not by 2-MTTP. The depletion of dopamine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid by 2-MTTP was prevented by pretreatment with deprenyl, a selective inhibitor of MAO-B, or with EXP 561, a dopamine uptake inhibitor, just as the depletion by MPTP was prevented. Mouse brain MAO oxidized 2-MTTP in vitro less rapidly than it oxidized MPTP; deprenyl was a potent inhibitor of the oxidation of both substrates, suggesting that MAO-B oxidizes both 2-MTTP and MPTP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-HDA) on hemodynamic function were assessed in pithed male Sprague-Dawley rats prepared for continuous measurement of cardiac output by electromagnetic flowmetry. One week after 6-HDA administration, 100 mg/kg s.c., blood pressure increments elicited by electrical stimulation of the lumbar sympathetic outflow (0.25-8.0 Hz) were reduced significantly (P less than .01), whereas heart rate responses were normal. The reduction in blood pressure responses was due to an attenuation of increases in both cardiac output (P less than .01) and total peripheral resistance (P less than .02). Cardiac output responses were reduced exclusively due to a fall in stroke volume inasmuch as heart rate increases were not altered by 6-HDA. Furthermore, the reduction in neurally mediated cardiac output increases by 6-HDA appeared to result from impaired sympathetic control of inotropic activity. This conclusion was supported by the observation that pretreatment with the beta adrenergic receptor antagonist, nadolol, markedly decreased cardiac output responses in control animals, but did not further attenuate cardiac output increases in 6-HDA-treated rats. However, after nadolol a substantial cardiac output response remained that was equivalent in 6-HDA-treated and control rats. This remaining response may be accounted for by venous constriction and because there was no difference in the cardiac output increases in the two groups after nadolol it appears that neural control of venoconstriction was not impaired by 6-HDA. Thus results of the present study indicate that at 1 week after 6-HDA treatment noradrenergic control of resistance vessels and cardiac inotropism are reduced significantly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Two groups of monkeys were trained to respond under a fixed-interval schedule of food presentation. In one group, responding was suppressed (punished) by superimposing a fixed-ratio schedule of response-produced electric shock. Dose-effect curves were determined for all drugs by administering single doses i.m. 15 min before the start of the fixed-interval schedule. Low and intermediate doses of ZK 93423 (0.03-0.3 mg/kg), ZK 91296 (0.3-10.0 mg/kg), lorazepam (0.03-0.3 mg/kg) and suriclone (0.003-0.03 mg/kg) produced dose-related increases in the rates of both suppressed and nonsuppressed responding. The increases in response rates normally produced by maximally effective doses of ZK 93423, ZK 91296, lorazepam or suriclone were eliminated when the drugs were given in combination with the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788. Although many beta-carboline derivatives have been found to act as \"inverse agonists\" at benzodiazepine recognition sites, the present results show that ZK 93423 and ZK 91296 have clear benzodiazepine-like (agonist) effects on schedule-controlled behavior in squirrel monkeys.\r"

Animals were administered clonazepam (CNZ) or lorazepam (LRZ) i.p. or i.v., followed by [3H]Ro 15-1788. Plasma and cerebral cortical concentrations of the drug and cortical benzodiazepine receptor occupancy were determined at varying doses and times after administration. For both drugs, plasma and brain concentrations decreased in parallel with decreasing doses and with time, and the brain/plasma ratios remained constant. Receptor occupancy was maximal for CNZ and LRZ at doses above 1 and 4 mg/kg, respectively, and decreased with decreasing doses. Comparison of receptor occupancy with brain concentration yielded IC50 values of 21 ng/g for CNZ and 133 ng/g for LRZ. The apparent dissociation constant (Kd) for CNZ was 56 pmol/g and, for LRZ, 372 pmol/g. Hill plots yielded slopes of 1.30 for CNZ and 1.71 for LRZ. Alterations in the nonspecific uptake or elimination of Ro 15-1788 did not explain occupancy changes, inasmuch as brain concentrations of unlabeled Ro 15-1788 (6 mg/kg) were not changed by LRZ administration. The correlation between receptor occupancy and the pharmacodynamic actions of these drugs in blocking pentylenetetrazol seizures and inducing rotarod ataxia indicated that ED50 for these effects occurred at receptor occupancy of 30 to 60% for both drugs.\r"

Arteries were tested before and 60 min after removal of Ca++ from the bath solution. Norepinephrine-induced contraction and acetylcholine and A23187-induced relaxation were calcium-dependent in the thoracic and upper abdominal aorta. Contractions were resistant to the effect of calcium removal in segments from the aorta below the origin of the renal artery and from the renal artery itself. The aorta between the superior mesenteric and the renal arteries was intermediate in its dependence. Relaxation of the aorta caudal to the origin of the celiac artery and the renal artery was also resistant. The insertion of an intact everted vessel into an artery whose intima had been inactivated by rubbing restored partially the relaxation to acetylcholine and A23187 in the presence of normal calcium. Vessels that did not relax to acetylcholine after Ca++ exclusion from the bathing solution relaxed when the renal artery was the donor. Donor arteries whose relaxation was sensitive to Ca++ removal did not increase the relaxation response of the renal artery after calcium removal. Diltiazem and D600 reduced the relaxation responses of acetylcholine in the thoracic aorta and enhanced those in the renal artery. It is concluded that there is a transition in the extracellular Ca++ dependence of contraction and endothelium-derived relaxation along the length of the abdominal aorta. Changes in the dependence of contraction occurred more gradually than relaxation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At this age both brain histamine levels and mast cells number are at a maximum. In addition the major portion of the amine is stored in mast cells and upon subcellular fractionation it sediments in the crude nuclear fraction (P1). Treatments with thyroid hormones or thyrotropic hormone up to 5 days of age leads to a decrease in the histamine levels and mast cells number in the brain, whereas administration of the antithyroid agent 6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil increases both parameters. All treatments affected only the histamine in the P1 fraction and failed to alter the levels of neuronal histamine which is located in the supernatant of P1 (S1). These facts suggest that in neonatal rat thyroid hormones could be involved in the regulation of the levels of brain histamine by regulating the number of brain mast cells.\r"

In radioligand binding studies, TPA treatment did not interfere with [3H]BK specific binding to intact cells or to cell membranes. The ability of guanyl-5'-yl-imidodiphosphate to promote the conversion of the high affinity sites of the BK receptors into a low affinity sites was unaffected by TPA. TPA treatment showed the dose-dependent, noncompetitive inhibition of BK-stimulated formation of inositol trisphosphate. In the membrane preparations from TPA-treated cells, guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate-stimulated inositol trisphosphate formation was inhibited by 50%. These data indicate that TPA exerts its inhibitory action on BK responses at the sites of guanine nucleotide-binding protein or phospholipase C or both.\r"

The degree of separation was indicated by significant differences between the pp and pv cells in their activity of the pp markers, alanine aminotransferase (pp/pv = 2.1), gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (3.4) and lactate dehydrogenase (1.3), and of the pv markers, glutamate dehydrogenase (0.73) and pyruvate kinase (0.81). This pattern was not altered by a 3-day pretreatment with phenobarbital (PB). The hepatocytes isolated from the pv area contained higher activities of microsomal NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase, 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase and benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylase, and of cytosolic glutathione transferase. Cytochrome P-450 and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase were slightly higher in pv cells. Treatment with PB induced NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, glutathione transferase, cytochrome P-450 and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase but the degree of induction was found to be at least as strong in pp cells as in pv cells. The induction of 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase and 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase was clearly more prominent in pp cells. On the other hand, PB reduced the activities of benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase in both cell types. These results demonstrate by direct enzyme assay of separated cells the dominance of the pv-region for metabolizing drugs in the normal liver. Contrary to several other studies, however, our data indicate that induction by PB occurs panacinarily, i.e., relatively more in the pp region, thus diminishing rather than exaggerating the original pv dominance.\r"

Because of suggestions that this difference in muscarinic receptor-mediated physiological responses may be due to changes in the guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins (termed Go and Gi) associated with the receptor, we compared the functional and biochemical properties of these proteins in atria and ventricles from 8-day chick embryos. The affinity of agonist for the muscarinic receptor in either the absence or presence of guanine nucleotides was the same in membranes from atria and ventricles; similar concentrations of guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate were required to regulate agonist binding in both tissues (EC50 of 2.7 X 10(-8) and 2.0 X 10(-8) M for atria and ventricles, respectively). Forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in atria and ventricles was equally sensitive to inhibition by guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate. In addition, the muscarinic agonist carbachol inhibited adenylate cyclase in ventricles with an IC50 similar to that observed in atria, although the magnitude of inhibition was slightly less in ventricles. The physical properties of the alpha subunits of the guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins were examined after covalent modification by islet activating protein. Two [32P]ADP-ribosylated polypeptides were detected by one dimensional gel electrophoresis, with molecular weights equal to those reported for Go and Gi from other tissues. Similar amounts of both proteins were found in atrial and ventricular membranes. Peptide mapping demonstrated that although the 39 and 42 kD proteins had nonidentical peptide maps, atrial and ventricular peptide maps were identical.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have improved our arteriographic methods by the routine application of selective pudendal injections, vasodilation pharmacoangiography with nitroglycerin and papaverine, and direct magnification. Experience in 37 impotent patients demonstrates marked improvement in the quality of visualization of distal vessels, and the frequent presence of functional vasoconstriction of medium and small arteries that can be distinguished from organic disease only with vasodilators. We believe these angiographic methods will improve the criteria against which other diagnostic and therapeutic methods can be objectively assessed.\r"

  ".W": "Male weanling F344 rats were orally gavaged with aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) in daily doses of 200, 235, 270, 300, and 350 micrograms/kg/day for a total of 10 doses over a 12-day period, and then 1 week after the last dose they were fed diets of varying protein (casein) content to compare the contribution of AFB1 dose and dietary protein level on the development of presumptive preneoplastic gamma-glutamyltransferase-positive (GGT+) foci in rat liver. All animals were fed the same 20% dietary casein level during the dosing period. One week after the end of the dosing period, one-half of the animals in each dose group were then continued on the 20% casein diet for the entire 12-week foci-development period; the remaining half in each dose group were fed lower levels of dietary casein during the foci-development period for the increasing AFB1 dose groups (20, 16, 12, 8, and 4% casein for the 235-, 250-, 270-, 300-, and 350-micrograms/kg/day groups, respectively). The AFB1 dose groups used were determined in a preliminary experiment. In this previous experiment, a clearly discernible threshold dose at about 100-150 micrograms AFB1/kg/day (below which no GGT+ foci were observed) and a steep slope between 150 and 400 micrograms/kg/day were produced. In the second experiment, while the expected positive slope of (AFB1) dose versus (GGT+ foci) response relationship was found for animals fed the 20% casein diet, the dose response for the animals fed the lower levels of casein was eliminated, providing evidence that nutrient intake during the postdosing foci development is more rate limiting toward the development of these preneoplastic lesions than is the carcinogen dose.\r"

In 13 patients with early stages of the disease, the method was used as an emergency treatment with good response in 84.6% of the cases without serious complications. In 43 patients with advanced disease, the concentrated dose was generally repeated for palliation and relieved symptoms in about 72% of the cases but with complications in 16.3%. The authors recommend this method only when absolutely necessary to stop severe haemorrhage and suggest that patients with good response to the first flash course should continue treatment with conventional fractionation, bearing in mind the tolerance of the normal tissues.\r"

The advantages for doctors commonly attributed to this arrangement are insubstantial. A system of no-fault compensation is unlikely to be implemented in this country in the foreseeable future.

The purpose of this study was to determine arachidonic acid metabolites and to measure concentrations of PGs and LTs in nasal polyps and nasal mucosa. Samples of nasal polyps and nasal mucosa were obtained at the time of polypectomies and nasal procedures. Metabolites of arachidonic acid in tissue were determined by incubation of tissue-homogenates with 14C-arachidonic acid and analyses with thin-layer chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Levels of PGE2, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, thromboxane (Tx)B2, 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE), LTC4, LTB4 were measured by radioimmunoassay. The predominant arachidonic acid metabolite in both nasal polyps and mucosa with 15-HETE. The HPLC analysis showed that the predominant metabolite in nasal polyp was 15-HETE, especially in polyps from aspirin sensitive patients. Levels of 15-HETE and PGE2 were higher in polyps from patients with a history of allergy than from nonallergic patients. Levels of LTC4 and LTB4 in nasal polyps were determined. The findings of this study will help to explain biochemical basis of the pathogenesis of aspirin-sensitive nasal polyps and to develop better medical treatment for them.\r"

Fifteen animals underwent laser excision with the Sharplan 733 CO2 laser (TEMoo, 125 mm handpiece, 25W continuous wave). Primary tumor size was 17.6 +/- 1.4 mm in the scalpel group and 21.2 +/- 6.3 mm in the laser group. Tumor recurred in 14/15 (93.4%) of the scalpel group and 5/15 (33.3%) of the laser group (p less than 0.001). The site of recurrence was incisional in 13/15 (86.7%) of the scalpel group and 3/15 (20%) of the laser group (p less than 0.001). Axillary metastases occurred in 2/15 (13.3%) in each group.

In groups II and III, two artificial dyes, congo red or methylene blue, were added to the suspensions prior to lasing. In group IVa, no laser energy was used, and group IVb was used to measure the bactericidal thermal effects of the laser. It was concluded that: Low dosages of laser energy exceeding 1,667 J/cm2 resulted in a 2 to 8 log decline in the number of viable bacterial colonies in vitro. Compared to the other two bacterial strains, P aeruginosa was the most sensitive to YAG laser irradiation. Addition of methylene blue, a dark-colored dye, enhanced the bactericidal effects of the YAG laser as indicated by the significantly reduced viability of P aeruginosa after irradiation with 2,222 J/cm2.\r"

This group includes those who have diffuse coronary artery disease, those with poor ventricular function, and those who have had poor results from previous surgery. Developing a method to directly revascularize the myocardium by creating channels through the ventricular wall has challenged many investigators. Early methods, including needle acupuncture, were successful in the acute phase, but long-term patency could not be achieved. Closure of the channels was due to fibrosis and scarring. Experiments in our laboratory demonstrated that myocardial channels, made with the CO2 laser, remained patent up to five years. Histopathologic examination of the channels showed minimal damage to the surrounding cells in the acute phase. Studies at intervals of two months to two years showed patent endothelialized channels, with no evidence of fibrosis. Channels created in the myocardium protected the ventricle against an ischemic event when the left anterior descending branch of the coronary artery was ligated. Clinical experience with direct myocardial revascularization by CO2 laser indicates it may be a viable method of treating those patients with ischemic heart disease who are not candidates for other forms of management. The treatment and early postoperative follow-up in one patient are described.\r"

There was no mortality or morbidity related to the procedure. In five patients with villous adenoma the tumor was resected with one recurrence as yet (followup 4-16 months). Five patients with inoperable carcinoma were treated for palliation with good results.

  ".W": "The milliwatt carbon dioxide laser was used to induce focal lesions and to perform wedge resections in the livers of 75 strain A mice. The procedures were feasible and well tolerated by the mice, with only one postoperative death in the wedge resection group in an early experiment. The hepatic lesions produced by the laser were characterized histologically by an inner area of vaporization, an intermediate area of coagulation necrosis, and an outer rim of cells with variable damage. The lesions healed by fibroblastic proliferation and scar formation with no hepatocytic contribution. The small vessel and bile ductule sealing effect of CO2 laser, together with the sound healing of laser-induced wounds, highlights the usefulness of this modality in liver surgery in general, and suggests its particular application in the treatment of liver trauma and a variety of hepatic focal lesions, neoplastic or otherwise.\r"

  ".W": "Evidence suggests that plasma-volume expansion leads to the release of a digitalis-like factor, which is thought to act on the renal tubular cells and cause natriuresis. We postulated that this factor might be present in patients with acromegaly (in whom plasma volume is elevated) and might return to normal levels when the disease was treated successfully. We measured the ability of plasma extracts from patients with acromegaly to inhibit the binding of ouabain to the sodium pump in normal red cells and to inhibit the enzymatic activity (sodium-potassium-ATPase) of the sodium pump in membrane preparations from normal kidneys. In 21 patients with active acromegaly, the mean (+/- SE) level of ouabain-binding inhibition (1.56 +/- 0.38) was higher (P less than 0.01) than that in either 11 successfully treated patients (0.18 +/- 0.05) or in 27 normal controls (0.19 +/- 0.03). The inhibition of sodium-potassium-ATPase activity by plasma was also greater in patients with active acromegaly (38.1 +/- 6.8 percent) than in successfully treated patients (18.4 +/- 5.6 percent, P less than 0.05) or controls (21.1 +/- 2.7 percent, P less than 0.05). Significant correlations were found between plasma volume and ouabain-binding inhibition in 23 patients (r = 0.72, P less than 0.01) and sodium-potassium-ATPase inhibition in 19 patients (r = 0.62, P less than 0.01). Pituitary adenomectomy decreased plasma volume and the inhibition by plasma of ouabain binding. We conclude that an endogenous digitalis-like factor is present in the plasma of patients with chronic volume expansion due to acromegaly. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that this natriuretic factor may have a physiologic role in water and sodium homeostasis.\r"

The effects of myo-inositol on nerve conduction are now explained by concepts that were largely unappreciated in 1976, including the fundamental role of phosphoinositide metabolism in cell regulation and the importance of the activity of sodium-potassium-ATPase in nerve conduction. Aldose reductase inhibitors firmly link defects in myo-inositol metabolism to activation of the polyol pathway in diabetes; the resulting \"sorbitol-myo-inositol hypothesis\" has been extended from its application to the lenses and peripheral nerves to most of the tissues involved with diabetic complications. These biochemical mechanisms provide a new framework within which to explore the complex interactions between hyperglycemia and the vascular, genetic, and environmental variables in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications. It is anticipated that these endeavors will result in the appearance of new classes of therapeutic agents, the first of which--the aldose reductase inhibitors--has emerged from the laboratory and is now undergoing extensive clinical testing. These efforts are very likely to result in the appearance of new treatment methods that may dramatically lighten the burden of chronic complications in patients with diabetes.\r"

Here we confirm the blocking effects of IAP and GTP gamma S (a nonhydrolysable analogue of GTP) on the ACh-induced K+-current recorded from the ganglion cells of the sea slug Aplysia and compare their effects on histamine (HA)-induced and dopamine (DA)-induced K+-currents. Intracellular injections of IAP irreversibly and selectively block the openings of K+-channels activated by either ACh, HA, or DA without affecting the resting potential or conductance states of the membranes. Intracellular application of GTP gamma S alone caused extremely slow, irreversible opening of K+-channels; however, repetitive receptor activations significantly increase the rate of the GTP gamma S effect. These results strongly suggest that a GTP-binding protein such as Gi regulates the opening of K+-channels coupled with these receptors.\r"

The action of IL-2 seemed to be limited specifically to lymphocytes, however, and the term 'T-lymphocytotrophic hormone' was used. Here we provide evidence that human monocytes display a substantially increased cytotoxic activity as a direct and rapid response to human recombinant IL-2 but not to human recombinant glycosylated interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) or lipopolysaccharide. Our results reveal a previously unknown function of IL-2 and suggest its possible involvement in monocyte-T cell interactions.\r"

These elements are composed of a number of different protein binding sites. The regulatory factors that recognize such 'modules' may be ubiquitous, tissue- or stage-specific, and positively or negatively acting. According to this model the transcriptional activity of a given gene is programmed by a combination of different modules. We analysed such a site of protein-DNA interaction, the octamer motif, in the enhancers of the simian virus (SV40) early genes and the murine immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene, and in the distal sequence element (DSE) of the U2 small nuclear (sn)RNA gene of Xenopus laevis. The corresponding DNA-binding factor appears to be the same in the three cases. Moreover, a fraction containing partially purified octamer motif binding factor has a stimulatory effect on transcription in an in vitro system.\r"

Analysis of the cell binding sites of vertebrate fibronectin and other extracellular proteins that interact with cell surfaces implicate the same amino acid triplet. Peptides containing this sequence inhibit certain developmental events such as cell-matrix adhesion or cellular migration in vitro and in vivo. The RGD-sequence is also part of the cellular recognition site of the aggregation protein discoidin I in Dictyostelium suggesting that the RGD-recognition system could be universally used. In Drosophila, despite its advanced genetics, very little is known about the extracellular components that are involved in cell movements and morphogenesis. We report here that peptides containing the RGD-sequence prevent gastrulation of Drosophila embryos. The phenotypic effect is similar to that observed in the dorsal-group mutants: no ventral furrow is formed and the embryos lack dorsal-ventral polarity. The specificity of the inhibiting action suggests that the RGD-sequence may also be used by invertebrates to mediate cell-attachment phenomena.\r"

The mechanism by which odorant binding could initiate membrane depolarization is unknown, but the recent discovery of an odorant-stimulated adenylate cyclase in purified olfactory cilia suggests that cyclic AMP may serve as an intracellular messenger for olfactory transduction. If so, then there might be a conductance in the ciliary plasma membrane which is controlled by cAMP. Here we report that excised patches of ciliary plasma membrane, obtained from dissociated receptor cells, contain a conductance which is gated directly by cAMP. This conductance resembles the cyclic GMP-gated conductance that mediates phototransduction in rod and cone outer segments, but differs in that it is activated by both cAMP and cGMP. Our data provide a mechanistic basis by which an odorant-stimulated increase in cyclic nucleotide concentration could lead to an increase in membrane conductance and therefore, to membrane depolarization. These data suggest a remarkable similarity between the mechanisms of olfactory and visual transduction and indicate considerable conservation of sensory transduction mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "In neuronal cells, opioid peptides and opiates inhibit neurotransmitter release, which is a calcium-dependent process. They also inhibit adenylyl cyclase, presumably via the membrane signal-transducing component, Gi, a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G-protein). No causal relationship between these two events has yet been demonstrated. Besides Gi, membranes of neuronal tissues contain large amounts of Go, a G-protein with unknown function. Both G-proteins are heterotrimers consisting of alpha-, beta- and gamma-subunits; the alpha-subunits can be ADP-ribosylated by an exotoxin from Bordetella pertussis (PT), which modification inhibits receptor-mediated activation of the G-protein. It was recently shown that noradrenaline, dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibit the voltage-dependent calcium channels in dorsal root and sympathetic ganglia; this inhibition is mimicked by intracellular application of guanine nucleotides and blocked by PT, suggesting the involvement of a G-protein. Here we report an inhibitory effect of the opioid D-Ala2, D-Leu5-enkephalin (DADLE) on the calcium current (ICa) in neuroblastoma X glioma hybrid cells (N X G cells). Pretreatment with PT almost completely abolishes the DADLE effect. The effect is restored by intracellular application of Gi and Go. As the alpha-subunit of Go (with or without beta-gamma complex) is 10 times more potent than Gi, we propose that Go is involved in the functional coupling of opiate receptors to neuronal voltage-dependent calcium channels.\r"

Monoclonal antibodies against CD4 have been shown to block numerous T-cell functions; moreover, recent results suggest that the CD4 molecule may be involved in transmembrane signal transduction. The human CD4 glycoprotein has also been shown to form at least part of the receptor for the AIDS virus, HIV-1. Elucidation of the functions of CD4 will be facilitated by the ability to manipulate the protein by genetic means. Because the mouse system is well suited for a variety of functional studies, we have isolated, sequenced and expressed cDNA clones encoding the murine CD4 (L3T4) glycoprotein. Comparison of the mouse and human CD4 sequences reveals striking evolutionary conservation of the cytoplasmic domain, suggesting that this region is essential for CD4 function. In addition, both the human and mouse CD4 gene contain a large intron in the coding region of the V-like domain. As no other members of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily have been shown to contain similarly placed introns, this finding may have important implications regarding the evolution of this gene family in particular and of introns in general.\r"

  ".W": "Several human bacterial pathogens, including the Gram-negative diplococcus Neisseria gonorrhoeae, produce extracellular proteases that are specific for human immunoglobulin IgA1. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) proteases have been studied extensively and the genes of some species cloned in Escherichia coli, but their role in pathogenesis remains unclear. Recently we derived a DNA fragment of 5 kilobases (kb) from N. gonorrhoeae MS11 directing extracellular active enzyme in E. coli. Although the mature enzyme of strain MS11 was shown to have a relative molecular mass of 106,000 (Mr 106K) in gels, the DNA sequence of this cloned fragment reveals a single gene coding for a 169K precursor of IgA protease. The precursor contains three functional domains, the amino-terminal leader which is assumed to initiate the inner membrane transport of the precursor, the protease, and a carboxyl-terminal 'helper' domain apparently required for extracellular secretion (excretion). Based on the structural features of the precursor, we propose a model in which the helper serves as a pore for excretion of the protease domain through the outer membrane. IgA protease acquires an active conformation as its extracellular transport proceeds and is released as a proform from the membrane-bound helper by autoproteolysis. The soluble proform further matures into the 106 K IgA protease and a small stable alpha-protein.\r"

It acts on resting B cells to enhance the expression of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, to prepare these cells to respond more promptly to subsequent stimuli, such as anti-IgM antibodies, and causes the secretion of IgG1 and IgE by B cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). BSF-1 has been shown to stimulate T cell lines, resting T cells and some mast cell lines. Recently, the designation interleukin-4 (IL-4) has been suggested for BSF-1. We report here the existence of high-affinity cell-surface receptors specific for BSF-1 on both B and T lymphocytes, and on cells of several other haematopoietic lineages, including mast cell, macrophage and undifferentiated haematopoietic cell lines. Resting B and T lymphocytes express receptors, which increase in number upon activation of B cells with LPS or anti-IgM, and of T cells with concanavalin A. Cross-linking of 125I-labelled-BSF-1 to its receptors creates a complex of Mr approximately 80,000.\r"

  ".W": "In human T lymphocytes the antigen receptor (Ti) is associated non-covalently on the cell surface with the invariant T3 antigen which comprises 3 chains: two glycosylated polypeptides of relative molecular mass 26,000 (Mr 26K) and 21K (gamma and delta) and one non-N-glycosylated polypeptide of Mr 19K (epsilon). The proposed function of T3 is to transduce the activation signals delivered via the antigen receptor. Recently we have shown that phorbol esters, which stimulate protein kinase C, can induce phosphorylation of the gamma subunit of the T3 antigen. But the critical question is whether T3 phosphorylation occurs as a normal consequence of immune activation of T lymphocytes. In this respect, it has been shown that immune stimulation of murine T cells results in phosphorylation of Ti-associated polypeptides that may be the functional analogues of the human T3 antigen. We have therefore monitored T3 phosphorylation after exposure of human T cells to antigen or phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). The data show that both stimuli initiate phosphorylation of the gamma subunit of the T3 antigen which indicates that T3 phosphorylation is a physiological response to immune activation.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a polypeptide growth factor which stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of T lymphocytes. The receptor for IL-2 is expressed on activated T lymphocytes, cloned IL-2 dependent cells and several other cell types. Analysis of the primary structure and of immune-precipitated receptor suggests that this molecule has no intrinsic signal transduction function, unlike other growth factors. IL-2 interaction with a high affinity receptor has been shown, however, to activate the calcium/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C (PK-C) presumably via phosphoinositide hydrolysis. Members of a family of closely related guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins) regulate a diverse group of metabolic events. Two of them, Gs and Gi, stimulate and inhibit adenylate cyclase activity respectively, and other G proteins are involved in diverse signal transduction system. Another member, Go, has no known function and activation of phospholipase C has been attributed to the action of an unidentified G protein, Gp. Since it has been observed that IL-2 inhibits the catalytic activity of adenylate cyclase and that agents such as PGE2 which stimulate adenylate cyclase activity inhibit the lymphoproliferative response to IL-2, association of GTP binding proteins with IL-2 signal transduction was investigated. In this report we describe for the first time the participation of a GTP binding protein in the action of a polypeptide growth factor, interleukin-2.\r"

Subsequent studies indicated, however, that this pattern was neither unique to malignant tumors nor an essential characteristic of all varieties of cancer. In attempting to synthesize the data on oxygen consumption of human brain tumors, it is difficult to relate activity to malignancy, and the integrity of the mitochondrial electron transport chain has not been systematically examined. In this study, oxygen consumption was measured using a whole cell mixture and subsequently with isolated mitochondria prepared by routine differential centrifugation from a variety of human brain tumors. It is clear from these data that low oxidative respiration is not uniquely characteristic of malignant tumors, but that a number of benign tumors such as meningiomas and pituitary adenomas display very low levels of oxygen consumption. Many of these tumors have normal respiration, with isolated mitochondria using substrates that enter at different points in the electron transport pathway. However, several of the tumors in this series showed defects in respiration at various points in the electron transport pathway. These data suggest that both benign and malignant brain tumors have depressed respiratory capacities secondary to either a decrease in mitochondria per cell or defects in electron transport activities.\r"

Both latent and active forms of collagenase were detected in serum by molecular sieve chromatography; these forms had a relative molecular weight (Mr) of 65,000 and 45,000, respectively. Only latent collagenase was detected in crude serum after destroying inhibitors by treatment with 3 M potassium thiocyanate. Collagenase levels in males were lower than in nongravid females (34 +/- 5 versus 53 +/- 5 U/dL; mean +/- SEM; 1 unit = 1 microgram collagen digested per minute at 30C). During pregnancy there was no significant change in serum collagenase levels until the onset of spontaneous labor in full-term pregnancies (37-42 weeks), at which point there was a 66% increase over the nongravid level to a value of 88 +/- 5 U/dL. There was a further rise at one day postpartum, and high levels continued for at least four days. Women in premature labor (24-36 weeks) exhibited an eightfold increase in the level of serum collagenase to 405 +/- 110 U/dL; 16 of 17 patients in this group had collagenase levels above the 95th percentile for women at 16-40 weeks but not in labor. This evaluation of serum collagenase may provide a key for detecting premature labor. It is suggested that the increase in serum collagenase arises from the lower uterine segment and cervix.\r"

Abnormal elevations of lactate were found in the umbilical artery at hemoglobin concentrations below 8 g/dL (oxygen content 2 mmol/L) and in the umbilical vein at hemoglobin concentrations below 4 g/dL (oxygen content 2 mmol/L); the arterial lactate values were higher than the venous. These results show that lactate is produced by the human fetus stressed by anemic hypoxia and suggest that compensatory cardiovascular mechanisms are unable to maintain adequate oxygenation to all tissues when the umbilical venous oxygen content falls below 2 mmol/L.\r"

The alternative system was used to grade fundus photographs obtained during a large prevalence study, the Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic Retinopathy (WESDR). The alternative method involved grading seven stereoscopic standard fields as a whole, and assigning a level of severity for the eye according to the greatest degree of retinopathy using a modified Airlie House Classification scheme. Using an eight-level classification system of increasing severity of retinopathy, there was 78.3% exact agreement between the alternative and ETDRS systems. A grader regraded all 503 disagreements, and was in exact agreement 49.3% of the time with the alternative system, 35.7% of the time with the detailed system, and 15.0% with neither the alternative or detailed systems. Interobserver agreement for the alternative system was 78.5%; intraobserver agreement over a 9 month to 1 year period was 90.0% for grader 1 and 84.0% for grader 2. The alternative system of grading, when used by experienced graders, is a reproducible method for objectively determining retinopathy status in epidemiologic studies.\r"

Our findings indicate that physicians and patients need to reexamine the concept that congestive heart failure is necessarily a chronic disease. Certainly, evidence exists that continuing digitalis therapy indefinitely is inappropriate and may be harmful. Further investigation may prove that congestive heart failure in the elderly, like pneumonia, is a common acute occurrence and in many cases not a chronic state for which patients are destined to receive medication indefinitely. We hope that the findings from our small sample will stimulate other investigators to question the indiscriminate long-term use of digitalis in the elderly.\r"

We show here that none of these mutants exhibited insulin-activated autophosphorylation and kinase activity in vitro. They also do not mediate insulin- and antibody-stimulated uptake of 2-deoxyglucose. The tyrosine kinase activity is thus required for a key physiological response of insulin.\r"

  ".W": "The light-modulated current of vertebrate retinal rods flows through a 3',5'-cyclic GMP-dependent conductance located in the outer segment plasma membrane. We report the incorporation into planar bilayers of a conductance derived from vertebrate rod outer segment membranes specifically activated by cGMP but not by cAMP, 5'-GMP, GTP, or 5'-AMP. When the mean currents were measured as a function of increasing cGMP concentration, maximal activation occurred at concentrations less than 50 microM. Washout of cGMP rapidly reversed the effect. The apparent half-saturating concentrations were between 12 and 27 microM. Sodium, lithium, cesium, and potassium supported current in the presence of low concentrations of Ca2+, Mg2+, and 100 microM cGMP; choline did not. Removal of the divalent cations reversibly increased the currents. When calcium was the only current-carrying cation, attenuated currents were seen. These experiments support the hypothesis that calcium is a permeant blocker of the conductance. At low concentrations of cGMP in solutions also containing 0.5 mM EDTA, brief current spikes occurred with amplitudes from 0.5 to 4 pA at 50 mV. These spikes differed from the well-defined, unitary conductance steps usually associated with the opening and closing of ion channels. Occasionally we saw longer-lasting channel-like events; however, amplitude histograms did not resolve discrete conductance levels.\r"

Chimeric DNA fragments consisting of well-defined wild-type plus mutant DNA subsegments were constructed, introduced into flies by germ-line transformation, and assayed for biological activity. These experiments localized both pero1 and pers to a 1.7-kilobase DNA fragment that is mostly coding DNA. Sequencing of this subsegment from each mutant showed that pero1 is completely accounted for by a nonsense mutation in the third coding exon of a 4.5-kilobase RNA transcribed from this locus. The pers mutation is also a single nucleotide substitution, in the fourth coding exon, which results in a serine-to-asparagine substitution in the per gene protein product. The functional significance of these changes is discussed with reference to the phenotypes of the two mutations.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma samples obtained from a patient 6 wk, 6 months, and 4 yr after recovery from anti-VIII:C (anti-hemophilic factor, where VIII:C = factor VIII procoagulant activity) autoimmune disease were found to contain antibodies that inhibited anti-VIII:C activity in the patient's prerecovery plasma and in the plasma of two other patients with anti-VIII:C autoantibodies. F(ab')2 fragments from postrecovery IgG suppressed anti-VIII:C activity in F(ab')2 fragments from prerecovery IgG within a narrow range of molar ratios. Anti-VIII:C activity in F(ab')2 autoantibodies was also inhibited by F(ab')2 fragments from polyspecific therapeutic immunoglobulins prepared from a large pool of normal donors (IVIg). IgG from prerecovery plasma bound to F(ab')2 from postrecovery IgG and to F(ab')2 from IVIg, as assessed by ELISA. Affinity chromatography experiments demonstrated that F(ab')2 from postrecovery IgG preferentially bound anti-VIII:C antibodies among F(ab')2 fragments from prerecovery plasma containing anti-VIII:C autoantibodies. F(ab')2 from prerecovery plasma bound in higher amounts to postrecovery F(ab')2 than to IVIg. Insolubilized F(ab')2 fragments from postrecovery plasma also bound F(ab')2 fragments prepared from the plasma of another patient with anti-VIII:C autoimmune disease, although in lesser amounts than the patient's own prerecovery anti-VIII:C F(ab')2 antibodies. These observations suggest that human anti-VIII:C autoantibodies share idiotypic determinants and that spontaneous recovery from anti-VIII:C autoimmune disease occurs through idiotypic suppression of autoantibodies. In patients who recover from autoimmune disease and in patients in whom autoantibodies have been suppressed by infusions of IVIg, antiidiotypic antibodies, possibly by providing internal images of the antigen, may have shifted the immune system toward the steady-state equilibrium that prevents autoimmunity in normal individuals.\r"

This report briefly summarizes the deliberations of conference working groups (composed primarily of State and Federal public health officials) that addressed these issues. Numerous suggestions for improved surveillance, applied research, and training related to chronic disease prevention and control were offered, as well as ideas on organizing and marketing chronic disease intervention programs. The conference clearly identified a pressing need for a coalition of public health agencies and interested professional and voluntary organizations, as well as a coherent national agenda to combat chronic diseases.\r"

Three main components of compliance were investigated (medication, diet, and urine testing), and each component was broken down into three separate tasks. Physicians and patients rated the components on a scale of 0 to 10. For each of the three components, physicians rated compliance tasks as more difficult than did the patients. In addition, statistically significant differences were found in the difficulty ratings given separate tasks within each component of compliance. Finally, a statistically significant interaction reflected differences in difficulty ratings of patients compared with those of physicians for the various tasks associated with dietary compliance. Results indicated that physicians and diabetic patients differ in their perceptions of compliance difficulties. It would appear that either physicians were overestimating the difficulty that diabetic patients experience with various tasks or that patients underestimated (or underreported) their difficulty. Possible sources of these differences and their implications for patient and physician education are discussed.\r"

The proportions of currently employed persons who perceived exposure to health-endangering substances, work conditions, or risks of injuries were reported for age, race, sex, and occupation groups. Occupational groups were further characterized by the proportion of men and women who reported specific exposures (such as exposure to chemicals or to loud noise) and specific health consequences of exposure (such as risk of developing cancer or hearing impairment). Greater proportions of men than women reported perceived risk from exposure to health-endangering substances, work conditions, and injuries in their present job. Also, a greater proportion of workers perceived risk of injury in their present job than other occupational risk categories. The greatest proportions of perceived exposure to occupational risk were reported by farm operators and managers, police and firefighters, and by workers in forestry and fishing occupations. Among workers reporting perceived exposures, chemicals, noise, and risk of injuries from vehicles were cited by the greatest proportion of workers, as were such health consequences as lung and respiratory problems and hearing impairment. Data from this study may be used to target employment groups for health promotion or education and to develop indepth studies of specific occupational groups to reduce or prevent risk at the worksite.\r"

This report examines responses to these questions and analyzes self-reported levels of stress by sex and other respondent characteristics. In 1985, an estimated 34 million people aged 18 years and older experienced \"a lot\" of stress in the 2-week period preceding the interview. Women were more likely than men to report a lot of stress (23 percent versus 18 percent), and respondents 65 years of age or older were more likely than younger respondents to report \"almost no\" stress. An estimated 21 million people (13 percent) believed that, over the past year, stress had \"a lot\" of effect on their health. Seventeen percent of the population considered seeking help in the past year for personal or emotional problems from family, friends, helping professionals, or self-help groups. Sixty-nine percent of those who thought about seeking help reported that they actually did seek help. In terms of health practices, men and women who reported higher levels of stress than others of their sex also were more likely to report that they rarely or never ate breakfast, slept 6 or fewer hours per night, were physically less active than their peers, or drank more alcoholic beverages than usual in the 2 weeks prior to the survey.\r"

According to what the authors consider their best estimates, personal medical care costs of AIDS in current dollars will rise from $630 million in 1985 to $1.1 billion in 1986 to $8.5 billion in 1991. Nonpersonal costs (for research, screening, education, and general support services) are estimated to rise from $319 million in 1985 to $542 million in 1986 to $2.3 billion in 1991. Indirect costs attributable to loss of productivity resulting from morbidity and premature mortality are estimated to rise from $3.9 billion in 1985 to $7.0 billion in 1986 to $55.6 billion in 1991. While estimated personal medical care costs of AIDS represent only 0.2 percent in 1985 and 0.3 percent in 1986 of estimated total personal health care expenditures for the U.S. population, they represent 1.4 percent of estimated personal health care expenditures in 1991. Similarly, while estimated indirect costs of AIDS represent 1.2 percent in 1985 and 2.1 percent in 1986 of the estimated indirect costs of all illness, they are estimated to rise to almost 12 percent in 1991. Estimates of personal medical care costs were based on data from various sources around the United States concerning average number of hospitalizations per year, average length of hospital stay, average charge per hospital day, and average outpatient charges of persons with AIDS. For estimating the indirect costs the human capital method was used, and it was assumed that average wages and labor force participation rates of persons with AIDS were the same as those for the general population by age and sex.\r"

At the same time, the public fails to discriminate between effective disease preventive factors related to periodontal diseases as opposed to those related to dental decay. Knowledge of oral disease prevention modalities generally varies across educational, income, age, and racial categories. However, there appears to be little variation in knowledge by gender. Additional information from upcoming surveys may shed more light on the relationships between knowledge of oral diseases and their prevention and personal preventive practices.\r"

More than half of the overweight respondents in the 1985 National Health Interview Survey were trying to lose weight, and almost half of this group reported both increasing their physical activity and decreasing their intake of calories. Dietary restriction without exercise was the next most common weight-loss regimen, suggesting that educational efforts should emphasize the need to increase physical activity as part of appropriate weight-loss regimens. Attempts to lose weight were reported frequently among those of normal and lean weight as well as among those who were overweight, especially among women and the better educated. About one-fifth of already lean young women reported attempting weight loss, an indication that some inappropriate dieting is probably occurring, suggesting the need for caution in public health promotion of weight loss. Another 1990 objective is that 90 percent of adults should understand that eating fewer calories or increasing activity, or both, is essential to lose weight. More than 70 percent of adults in this survey were able to identify these as the two best ways to reduce weight, with greater proportions of the younger adults and the more highly educated being knowledgeable. The survey also provided data for an objective that targets some nutrition education and counseling as part of all routine health contacts with health professionals by 1990. Twenty-nine percent of all women and 22 percent of all men reported that eating proper foods was discussed sometimes or often in routine contacts.\r"

In reference to smoking, interviewers asked about miscarriage, stillbirth, prematurity, and low birth weight; in reference to heavy drinking, they asked about miscarriage, mental retardation, low birth weight, and birth defects, as well as fetal alcohol syndrome. For each of these adverse outcomes, a majority of subjects acknowledged increased risk because of smoking or heavy drinking during pregnancy. The range was 66-80 percent of respondents for the four questions on smoking, with the perceived association to smoking strongest for low birth weight. Approximately 84 percent of respondents associated heavy drinking with increased risk for each of the suggested pregnancy outcomes. Smoking seemed to be perceived to pose a lesser risk to pregnancy than heavy drinking. This relative lack of awareness of the pregnancy risks of smoking was more apparent among respondents with less education and more pronounced among blacks than whites. Women were more likely than men to express some opinion on these pregnancy-related questions and were more cognizant than men of the risks. On this limited survey, Americans ages 18-44 were not very knowledgeable about fetal alcohol syndrome. Among the 55 percent who had heard of fetal alcohol syndrome, fewer than one in four correctly identified it as a set of birth defects when offered three possible definitions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The three-component, interactive program--sex education, adolescent clinic services, and community support and involvement--is proposed for preventing adolescent pregnancy which, in turn, will decrease the rate of births of low birth weight infants and, consequently, the rate of infant mortality in target areas of Illinois. Medical and college students will be trained to teach the sex education course and to serve as counselors. A clinic will provide primary care, contraceptive education, and access to contraceptives. The clinic staff will be a resource for the community as well as for the adolescents. In the target areas, church and community members will sponsor health fairs and discussions of adolescent pregnancy at church and at parent-teacher association meetings. The overlapping activities of the instructors, clinic personnel, and church and community members will give continuity and consistency to the prevention message directed to the adolescents.\r"

  ".W": "This proposal is aimed at reducing the risk of adverse drug interactions that may occur when over-the-counter (OTC) preparations are taken in conjunction with prescription drugs in an unsupervised regimen. Such polymedicating is practiced widely among the elderly. A pilot program would be implemented over 12 months at three drugstores of a major retail chain. A barcode-based computer system would be used to identify potential adverse drug interactions for elderly customers. All volunteers admitted to the study, controls and subjects, would agree to buy all their medications, prescriptions and OTC, at the participating pharmacies. In return, the volunteers would receive discounts of 25 percent on prescription and OTC drugs and 10 percent on vitamins. Study subjects (N = 375) would carry barcoded identification (BID) cards that would activate the computerized program to assess each purchase for compatibility with their other medications; controls (N = 375) would carry \"dummy\" BID cards that would prompt the computer to approve all drug purchases. A final comparison of the subjects with the controls, as well as with a sample of elderly residents selected randomly from the community, would determine whether such a computerized, commercially based drug use review system could reduce the potential for adverse interactions between OTC and prescription drugs among the elderly.\r"

Mass media will include radio, television, newspapers, posters, and literature. The program will use resources of the public health department and junior high school; it will also depend on 8 teachers and 25 peer leaders, all trained in the program. Reducing the use of smokeless tobacco is the program's objective. If that goal is achieved, the program will reduce oral cancers in the target population by 75 percent within 10 years. The incidence of leukoplakia will be reduced by 50 percent within 3 years of the end of the program. By the end of the program, 90 percent of the target population will be able to identify warning signs of oral cancer and leukoplakia, and 85 percent of the students will no longer believe that use of smokeless tobacco is less harmful than smoking. As a result of the program, use of smokeless tobacco will not be viewed favorably by 80 percent of the target population; usage will be regarded as socially unacceptable.\r"

In all 11 patients with neurofibromas, these tumors had slightly greater signal intensity than muscle on T1-weighted images and markedly increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images. In seven patients central areas of decreased signal intensity within the neurofibromas were demonstrated on T2-weighted images. In one patient these central areas corresponded pathologically to relatively fibrous components of the tumors surrounded by myxoid matrix. Five patients had extensive plexiform neurofibromatosis, one had lateral meningoceles, one had a neurofibrosarcoma, three had extradural spinal cord compression, and two had cystic intramedullary tumors of the spinal cord. The ability to obtain high-resolution, multiplanar images in a noninvasive fashion makes surface coil MR imaging an ideal technique for evaluating neurofibromatosis involving the spinal cord, spinal canal, and paraspinal soft tissues.\r"

Subtractive hybridizations of complementary DNA's to polyadenylated RNA isolated from derepressed cultures of these strains reveal the presence of nuclear-encoded transcripts whose abundance varies not only between them and their respiratory-competent parent, but among the respiratory-deficient strains themselves. Transcripts of some nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins, like cytochrome c and the alpha and beta subunits of the mitochondrial adenosine triphosphatase, whose abundance is affected by glucose or heme, do not vary. In the absence of major metabolic variables, yeast cells seem to respond to the quality and quantity of mitochondrial DNA and modulate the levels of nuclear-encoded RNA's, perhaps as a means of intergenomic regulation.\r"

Both T alpha mRNA and T alpha immunoreactivity were observed only in photoreceptors. Within the photoreceptor T alpha mRNA was present primarily in the inner segments and to a lesser extent in the outer nuclear layer at all times during the day and night. However, the distribution of T alpha immunoreactivity varied profoundly with the light-dark cycle; during the day, T alpha immunoreactivity was highest in the inner segments, and at night the outer segments were more immunoreactive. The amounts of T alpha mRNA and T alpha immunoreactivity also depended on the light-dark cycle. Levels of T alpha mRNA were high immediately before and after lights on; levels were low for the rest of the light-dark cycle. During the day, T alpha immunoreactivity increased in the inner segments following the increase in T alpha mRNA. After the lights were turned off, T alpha immunoreactivity decreased in the inner segments and increased in the outer segments. Thus, it appears that T alpha is synthesized in the inner segments after a morning increase in T alpha mRNA. Newly synthesized T alpha remains in the inner segments until it is transported to the outer segments at night, where it may be involved in the increase in the sensitivity of photoreceptor rods at night.\r"

As with activation of protein kinase C by phosphatidylserine and sn-1,2-diacylglycerol, inhibition was subject to surface dilution. Accordingly, inhibition in mixed micelle assays was dependent on the molar percentage of lysosphingolipids rather than the bulk concentration. Lysosphingolipids inhibited protein kinase C activity at molar percentages similar to those required for activation by phosphatidylserine and sn-1,2-diacylglycerol. Since lysosphingolipids accumulate in Krabbe's disease, Gaucher's disease, and other sphingolipidoses, the hypothesis that lysosphingolipid inhibition of protein kinase C represents the missing functional link between the accumulation of sphingolipids and the pathogenesis of these disorders appears to unify existing data. The accumulation of lysosphingolipids would cause progressive dysfunction of signal transduction mechanisms vital for neural transmission, differentiation, development, and proliferation and would eventually lead to cell death.\r"

  ".W": "Liver damage induced by the antiepileptic drug valproic acid (VPA) is believed to be mediated by an unsaturated metabolite of the drug, delta 4-VPA. In studies of the biological origin of this hepatotoxic compound, it was found that liver microsomes from phenobarbital-treated rats catalyzed the desaturation of VPA to delta 4-VPA. Indirect evidence suggested that cytochrome P-450 was the responsible enzyme, a conclusion that was verified by studies with a purified and reconstituted form of the hemoprotein, which catalyzed the oxidation of VPA to 4- and 5-hydroxyvalproic acid and to delta 4-VPA. Desaturation of a nonactivated alkyl substituent represents a novel metabolic function of cytochrome P-450 and probably proceeds via the conversion of substrate to a transient free radical intermediate, which partitions between recombination (alcohol formation) and elimination (olefin production) pathways. These findings have broad implications with respect to the metabolic generation of olefins and may explain the increased hepatotoxic potential of VPA when it is administered in combination with potent enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants such as phenobarbital.\r"

The neuropeptide substance P is one possible mediator of this interaction, since it can be released into joint tissues from primary sensory nerve fibers. The potential effects of the peptide on rheumatoid synoviocytes were examined. The results show that substance P stimulates prostaglandin E2 and collagenase release from synoviocytes. Furthermore, synoviocyte proliferation was increased in the presence of the neuropeptide. Similar effects were observed with a truncated form of substance P. Synoviocytes were sensitive to very small doses of the neuropeptide (10(-9) M), and its effects were inhibited by a specific antagonist. Thus, the specific stimulation of synoviocytes by the neuropeptide substance P represents a pathway by which the nervous system might be directly involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

Each had symptoms of fatigue, hypersomnolence, morning headache, and orthopnea, the cause of which was misdiagnosed. The key to diagnosis was paradoxic abdominal motion on inspiration. This finding, consistent with diaphragmatic paralysis, led to neurologic evaluation, electromyographic examination, and muscle biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. The symptoms of alveolar hypoventilation were reversed with chronic nocturnal ventilation, which assisted in rehabilitating some patients.\r"

After deflation of the tourniquet, EtCO2 and PaCO2 increased maximally within one minute; EtCO2 returned to baseline at a mean time of 13 minutes 7 seconds +/- 5 minutes 17 seconds, while PaCO2 was still above baseline when the study was terminated. The pH level decreased significantly, with the maximal fall occurring within four minutes; it remained below baseline when the study was terminated. The PaO2 level decreased and the bicarbonate level increased, though neither change was statistically significant. After tourniquet release, hyperventilation may be indicated to facilitate the return of PaCO2 and pH levels to baseline; in patients whose acid-base status is compromised by preexisting disease, PaCO2 and pH should be monitored closely. The PaCO2 level could be predicted by monitoring the EtCO2 level.\r"

Participating physicians submit information on the initial hospitalization of emergent and acute burn patients and, separately, on the reconstruction process for these patients. As of January 1986, a total of 94,594 patient's data are on file from 130 hospitals; 13,671 of these are reconstructive and 80,923 emergent and acute admissions. Information concerning new patients is submitted at a rate of about 6000 patients annually. The data are analyzed using INQUIRE, an original data retrieval system. Data on treatment methods and outcome have been used to establish baseline standards for the burned patient's care and survival. In addition, these data have been used to document institutional differences in mortality rates and indicate methods used by the more successful hospitals. The data also are being used to describe the long process of recovery from severe burns and to monitor changes in outcomes of burn accidents continually. The result of these analyses has been documentation of an overall improvement in survival and decline in hospitalization times at all levels of burn severity. Data also can be used with institution-specific data to look at organizational variables affecting survival. Use of this epidemiologic data allows prevention projects to be targeted at the groups at greatest risk. A newer application looks at the equity of the HCFA prospective payment system based on the DRGs assigned to burn severity. The NBIE is an example of how a voluntary, national registry, properly computerized and effectively managed, can contribute to resolving the problem it was established to study. The NBIE has been useful in increasing the understanding of health professionals and government decision makers of a complicated disease process. It has had a direct effect on the quality of patient care and on the process of controlling the incidence of burn injuries.\r"

  ".W": "Systemic antibiotics are a valuable therapeutic modality in the burned patient when properly used. Injudicious use, however, may not only fail to be beneficial to the patient but also may produce harmful effects--either through direct toxicity or by contributing to the emergence of resistant strains of micro-organisms. General guidelines and principles for systemic antibiotic use include the following: The burned patient, despite all efforts, will be exposed to microorganisms. No single agent or combination of agents can destroy all the organisms to which the burned patient is exposed. Treatment involves first identifying the organism responsible for clinical sepsis, then choosing appropriate agents. Combinations of antibiotics are not always synergistic or even additive in effect. Multiagent therapy may have the untoward effect of predisposing to superinfection by yeast, fungi, or resistant organisms. Antibiotics should be used for a long enough period to produce an effect, but not long enough to allow for emergence of opportunistic or resistant organisms. Dosages must be adjusted based on serum concentrations when serum assays are available. In general prophylactic systemic antibiotics are indicated in only a few clinical situations including the immediate preoperative and postoperative periods associated with excision and autografting, and possibly in the early phases of burns in children. The penetration of systemic antibiotics into burn eschar remains an area not fully studied; hence, they cannot be the only therapeutic modality used to treat burn wound infection. Systemic dosages of antibiotics in burns will require alteration depending on the clinical status of the patient. The choice of agent requires a thorough knowledge of side effects, toxicity, and potential benefit. Above all, active surveillance and monitoring of the burned patient and the environment in which he or she is being treated is mandatory for effective treatment. The increasing number of new antimicrobial agents has presented a new dilemma to the practicing clinician because many of these agents have not been evaluated thoroughly in the burned population. With further studies, the armamentarium of the burn treatment team will inevitably increase. It is in this manner only that so many of the unanswered questions will be solved, and that infection will start to decline as the major cause of death in the burned population.\r"

Studies were performed in the basal state, during glucose infusion (4 mg/kg/min), and during total parenteral feeding (patients with AGI cancer only). Patients with early stages of the disease were also studied 2 to 3 months after resection of the cancer. Basal rates of glucose turnover were similar in volunteers and in patients with EGI cancer (13.9 +/- 0.3 mumol/kg/min and 13.3 +/- 0.2 mumol/kg/min, respectively) but were significantly higher in patients with AGI cancer (17.6 +/- 1.4 mumol/kg/min). Glucose infusion resulted in significantly less suppression of endogenous production in both patient groups than that seen in the volunteers (76% +/- 6% for EGI group, 69% +/- 7% for AGI group, and 94% +/- 4% for volunteers). The rate of glucose oxidation increased progressively in proportion to the tumor bulk. In the volunteers the percent of VCO2 from glucose oxidation was 23.9% +/- 0.7%, and in EGI and AGI groups the values were 32.8% +/- 2.0% and 43.0% +/- 3.0%, respectively. After curative resection of the cancer, glucose utilization decreased significantly (p less than 0.05). The rate of urea turnover was significantly higher in the AGI group (8.4 +/- 1.0 mumol/kg/min) in comparison with the volunteer group value of 5.9 +/- 0.6 mumol/kg/min (p less than 0.03). Glucose infusion resulted in a significant suppression of urea turnover in the volunteers (p less than 0.02), but in the AGI group glucose infusion did not induce a statistically significant decrease. We conclude from these studies that the presence of even a small, potentially curable gastrointestinal cancer is associated with a loss of the normal host-regulatory mechanisms designed to conserve body resources; this effect is more marked as the tumor bulk increases; increasing tumor bulk effects a progressive increase in glucose utilization and in protein breakdown.\r"

Infarcts were clearly visible in coronal, T2 weighted brain sections, 24, 48 and 72 h after MCA occlusion in the left hemisphere, as areas of increased NMR signals. The infarcts were quantified by pixel counting in each section, the sum of 4 sections representing an accurate estimate of the total infarct size. The location and extent of infarction, determined by MRI, were found to be highly reproducible and correlated well with post-mortem histological and biochemical data. A neurological score, made every 24 h, paralleled the evolution of the infarct size, which culminated after 48 h. Pre- or post-treatment of MCA occluded rats with the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist PN 200-110 resulted in a substantial reduction of infarct size, determined by MRI 24, 48 and 72 h after infarction, compared to vehicle treated controls. These findings were corroborated by corresponding improvements of the neurological scores as well as histological and biochemical data. Post-treatment with nimodipine showed qualitatively similar effects. These results support the notion that calcium antagonists, through vascular and/or metabolic mechanisms, are effective in treating acute stroke. Since they were obtained in a chronic, relevant model of stroke with a method directly applicable also to humans, they should encourage further clinical studies with calcium antagonists.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was conducted to clarify the effect of hyperosmolar solutions on the constrictor responses of cerebral arteries to vasoactive agents, in vitro. The canine basilar arteries under resting tension were slightly relaxed with both mannitol (0.5, 1 and 2%) and sucrose (1, 2, and 4%). Constrictor responses of canine basilar arteries to 40 mM K+, 10(-7) M serotonin or 10(-6) M prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) were markedly suppressed by pretreatment with either mannitol or sucrose. The rate of suppression correlated well to osmolarity changes in the Kreb's solution. When the specimens were incubated in Ca++-free medium, 10(-6) M PGF2 alpha elicited small contractions. Addition of 1 mM Ca++ to the bath promptly elicited larger contractions. The large contractions in response to the influx of extracellular Ca++ were markedly suppressed by pretreatment with mannitol or sucrose, while the small contractions induced by intracellular Ca++ were not inhibited. In addition, the contractions induced by the addition of Ca++ to the specimens depolarized with 80 mM K+ in Ca++-free medium were dose-dependently inhibited with either mannitol or sucrose, while the caffeine-induced contractions in Ca++-free medium were not altered by mannitol. These results suggest that hyperosmolar solutions produce non-specific vasodilation of cerebral arteries by inhibiting the influx of external Ca++ rather than the release of intracellularly stored Ca++. This direct vasodilatory effect may account in part for the transient increase of cerebral blood flow following administration of hyperosmolar mannitol.\r"

We report here that ganglioside (GM1 or AGF2) treatment results in a 52% decrease in mortality 48 hours after the induction of ischemia in gerbils by permanent unilateral ligation of the common carotid artery. By comparing the occluded vs. nonoccluded sides of the brain (cortex and hippocampus) we found a significant loss of membrane Na, K-ATPase activity due to ischemia in control animals, but no such differences were found between the hemispheres of ganglioside-treated gerbils. We hypothesize that gangliosides may be \"protecting\" membrane function as indicated by these ATPase analyses, reducing local CNS damage at the time of injury (i.e., reduced cell loss, fiber degeneration, membrane failure). By acutely limiting the extent of CNS tissue damage, conditions may be optimized for any subsequent CNS regrowth and functional recovery.\r"

  ".U": "87121321\r", 
  ".W": "Pial arterioles of mice were suffused in situ with tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP). This agent has been reported to stimulate synthesis or release of the constrictor, thromboxane. In the present study we observed pial arterioles by in vivo microscopy. Locally applied TBHP produced dose-dependent constriction, significantly inhibited by each of three drugs: acetylsalicylic acid, OKY-046, and SQ-29548. These drugs are respectively a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, and a thromboxane receptor blocker. Since each acts by a different mechanism to interfere with thromboxane-mediated responses and each inhibited the contractile response to TBHP, thromboxane appears to be a mediator of this response. Platelet aggregation was not seen after local application of TBHP, and the dwell time of platelets at the site of TBHP application is less than 1 second. Thus, platelets are an unlikely source of the thromboxane mediating the local constriction. It is much more likely that the source of thromboxane is either the wall of the pial vessels or the underlying brain and/or its vessels. These data do not distinguish between the latter two possibilities, but if this suggestion is correct, then the data show for the first time that thromboxane can be released from normal brain and/or brain vessels in amounts sufficient to cause arteriolar constriction.\r"

Clinical spectra, cerebral angiographic findings, associated conditions, and response to therapy are presented. Typical features include a relatively young age (mean 39 years), female preponderance, transient ischemic attacks (including amaurosis fugax) or stroke, and normal or large vessel occlusions on angiography. Commonly associated conditions were systemic lupus erythematosus (34%), noncerebral venous thrombosis (31%), hypertension (28%), false-positive VDRL (28%), and spontaneous abortions (22%). Four of our 5 patients (all without systemic lupus erythematosus) and 11 of the 20 (55%) patients in the literature without systemic lupus erythematosus had other definite stroke risk factors coexisting.

Group 1 (47 patients) did not receive IVIG. Group II (47 patients) received high-dose IVIG as prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus infections. Before transplantation no alloantibodies were found in the serums of 92 patients and anti-E was found in the serums of two patients. DATs were negative in all patients before BMT. Four percent of Group I had a positive IAT and 13 percent had a positive DAT. In contrast, 25.5 percent of Group II patients had a positive IAT and 49 percent had a positive DAT, usually within 1 week after initiation of IVIG therapy (p less than 0.001). Antibodies identified in serums and eluates of patients in Group I were anti-A and anti-B. Antibodies identified in serums and eluates of patients in Group II were anti-A, -B, -D, and -K. Twenty-one lots of IVIG were tested and antibodies identified were anti-A, -B, -D, and -K. The data suggest that the higher frequency of positive serologic tests in Group II was due to passively acquired antibodies from high-dose IVIG.\r"

This proved feasible in 98 per cent of patients. The vast majority of such mass lesions (82 to 90 per cent) is diagnosed with acceptable confidence by computed tomography and sonography alone. For a shrinking group of such patients, yet still 16 to 18 per cent, guided percutaneous aspiration biopsy is necessary to affirm the diagnosis. However, this technique has been refined during recent years to incorporate the use of thin needle equipment and can now be performed on an outpatient basis without significant risk of morbidity. For diagnosing hyperdense inflammatory and infected renal cysts, guided percutaneous aspiration is recommended as the most effective method. This procedure should take precedence over surgical exploration because it can diagnose and provide pertinent bacteriologic information that may determine the course of therapy. In many instances inflammatory cysts or even silent renal abscesses are diagnosed by a percutaneous aspiration technique that is then expanded to serve therapeutic purposes such as percutaneous drainage. Even these procedures can be performed safely on an outpatient basis provided the patient is followed closely. Because complications of percutaneous aspiration procedures are extremely rare, the procedure can be used safely on an outpatient basis. The impact of magnetic resonance imaging on the diagnosis of asymptomatic space-occupying lesions of the kidney is as yet not fully determined; however, this method appears promising for diagnosing some of the refractory lesions such as hemorrhagic cysts, aneurysms, or arteriovenous malformations.\r"

Initially, treatment was randomized between Zoladex 250 micrograms and 500 micrograms self-injected subcutaneously every day for a minimum period of twelve weeks following which a sustained-release, once-monthly depot formulation of Zoladex 3.6 mg s.c. was used. Acute rises in serum gonadotropins and testosterone during the first two days were followed by declines in hormone levels over the following three weeks. Median time to castration with 500 micrograms/day was twenty-two days compared with forty-three days with 250 micrograms/day (p = 0.06). No significant endocrinologic changes occurred during the transfer to the depot, and serum testosterone remained 95 per cent suppressed throughout the duration of the study. After three months the median daily serum Zoladex concentrations ranged between 0.47 and 0.53 ng/ml and were not significantly different among the three dosage forms. No specific correlation among serum Zoladex concentrations, endocrinologic parameters, and tumor response rates were found. Hot flashes initially, and decreased libido were the only common complaints. Zoladex was well tolerated, and no side effects required dose-modification or removal from the study. Tumor response rates up to one year appeared to be comparable to the conventional endocrine therapies. This analog in monthly depot formulation is recommended for further clinical evaluation.\r"

The seven patients with unsuccessful recanalization after coronary thrombolysis had total occlusion or subtotal occlusion with delayed washout of contrast material, and three of them had collaterals. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive accuracy of positive results of early scintigraphy in predicting the presence of early reperfusion were 73%, 100%, and 90%, respectively. Patients with positive early scintigrams showed increasing regional ejection fraction and decreasing thallium defect scores from the acute stage to the chronic stage. These findings indicate that early 99mTc-PYP scintigraphy is a sensitive noninvasive technique for detecting early recanalization in infarcted vessels.

The basal coronary transstenotic pressure gradients showed more severe stenosis than that seen on coronary arteriography, suggesting that angiography in this setting may underestimate the true extent of coronary atherosclerosis. Episodes of angina were triggered by marked, sudden increases in the transstenotic coronary pressure gradient and a decrease in coronary blood flow without alterations in systemic arterial pressure or heart rate. These changes in coronary hemodynamics were promptly reversed by the intracoronary administration of nitroglycerin. No such spontaneous variations in transstenotic coronary pressure gradients were observed in 37 patients with a history of classic exertional angina but no rest angina. These unique data represent direct hemodynamic evidence that an increase in resistance at the site of a coronary stenosis, most likely the result of an increase in arterial tone, can be a cause of transient myocardial ischemia in patients with angina at rest.\r"

Relaxation responses were induced with methacholine, the calcium ionophore A23187 and maitotoxin before and after removal of Ca++ from the external medium; in the presence of calcium-channel entry blockers (verapamil and nifedipine); or with trifluoperazine. Deletion of Ca++ greatly impaired responses to all 3 agonists while trifluoperazine only blocked cholinergic-induced relaxation. The calcium-channel blockers had effects that were concentration- and time-dependent, but their action included blockade of A23187. Cytosolic-free Ca++ concentrations were measured in cultured endothelial cells after incubation of the cells with 10 microM Fura-2/AM or 50 microM Quin 2/AM. Bradykinin (1 X 10(-10) to 1 X 10(-7) M) and melittin (0.5 to 5 micrograms/ml) caused dose-dependent increases in intracellular Ca++ with maximal responses at 3 X 10(-8) M and 3 micrograms/ml, respectively. Both agents were able to induce an increase in cytosolic-free Ca++ in the presence of EGTA (1.5 X 10(-3) M) or verapamil (1 X 10(-5) M). The plateau phase of the Ca++ transient appeared to be modified slightly by verapamil, while the peak responses and plateau were attenuated by '0' Ca++/EGTA. To assess a function of the endothelium, production of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) was studied in cells grown on microcarrier beads superfused in a column, and the column effluent was bioassayed on aortic rings.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Contractile responses to 80 mM K+ were inhibited by both Ca++ antagonists with the same potency and efficacy in SHR compared with WKY vessels (PN 200-110 IC50 = 2.8 +/- 1.3 X 10(-8) M in SHRs and 2.5 +/- 1.5 X 10(-8) M in WKYs; nisoldipine IC50 = 1.1 +/- 0.4 X 10(-8) M in SHRs and 1.2 +/- 0.9 X 10(-8) M in WKYs). However, contractile responses to norepinephrine (10(-4) M) were inhibited less potently by nisoldipine in SHR vessels (IC50 = 2.2 +/- 0.3 X 10(-9) M) compared with WKY vessels (IC50 = 1.6 +/- 0.6 X 10(-10) M). Similarly, PN 200-110 tended to be less (but not significantly less) potent in SHR vessels (IC50 = 3.3 +/- 1.8 X 10(-8) M) than in WKY vessels (IC50 = 3.4 +/- 0.9 X 10(-9) M); its efficacy was significantly depressed in the SHR vessels (by approximately 20%). When norepinephrine-stimulated calcium-45 influx was determined in the presence of these Ca++ antagonists, a similar profile emerged with respect to a comparison of SHR and WKY vessels. These results support a previously hypothesized alteration in receptor-activated Ca++ influx pathways in SHR mesenteric resistance vessels.\r"

An interim analysis of the efficacy and safety of a new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (PN 200-110 [isradipine]) in patients with confirmed coronary artery disease is reported. The study was carried out in 3 centers; 50 patients of an anticipated 96 have completed the double-blind comparative phases in 3 separate studies. Preliminary results from the placebo-controlled study indicate that PN 200-110 was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the anginal attack rate and glyceryl trinitrate consumption in the 15 patients so far enrolled. Dose-response comparisons against nifedipine in 21 patients and against isosorbide dinitrate in 14 patients demonstrate that PN 200-110 has a similar antianginal efficacy profile to both drugs. No significant change in any of the monitored safety factors was noted in any of the patients taking PN 200-110. The side-effects profile compared favorably with that of nifedipine. These interim results suggest that PN 200-110 will prove to be an effective and safe drug for the treatment of angina pectoris.\r"

Patients who qualified for entry after a 3 week placebo-washout period were enrolled in 1 of 5 studies; 2 studies were placebo controlled; 3 studies evaluated PN 200-110 against 1 of 3 active controls: hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) propranolol or prazosin. A separate study assessing the effects of PN 200-110 in combination with HCTZ versus propranolol plus HCTZ is also discussed. Compared with placebo, PN 200-110 decreased mean supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures by 20/16 mm Hg versus 4/6 mm Hg. Compared with placebo and active control drugs, PN 200-110 normalized supine diastolic blood pressure to less than or equal to 90 mm Hg in 72% of patients, versus 13% in the placebo group, 74% in the HCTZ group, 45% in the propranolol group and 69% in the prazosin group. In the ability to decrease diastolic blood pressure by greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg, PN 200-110 compared favorably to prazosin (81% vs 81%), and was superior to HCTZ (81% vs 61%) and propranolol (81% vs 36%). In combination with HCTZ, PN 200-110 exerted as great an antihypertensive effect as propranolol plus HCTZ. Long-term therapy with PN 200-110 was also effective. Supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased a mean of 15/13 mm Hg at 3 months, and 18/20 mm Hg at 12 months. PN 200-110 is well tolerated with relatively few adverse effects reported.\r"

  ".W": "A generalized accumulation of cholesterol, calcium and matrix materials (collagen, elastin and proteoglycans) occurs in an age-dependent manner in major arteries. Human atherogenesis is a disease of arteries characterized by a focal accumulation of fibrous matrix elements, lipids and calcium at lesion sites. Studies in cholesterol-fed animal models have indicated that calcium competitors and chelating agents can reduce calcium, lipid and matrix accumulation in arterial lesions and reduce the extent of lesion formation. These agents generally alter soft and hard tissue calcium pools or have deleterious side-effect profiles. Antiatherogenic studies with calcium antagonists (which have been shown to be safe in human clinical studies) have created confusion because of conflicting results. It is apparent, however, that high doses of calcium antagonists can significantly decrease atherogenic lesion development in cholesterol-fed rabbits. The antiatherogenic effects of calcium antagonists may be the result of changes in intracellular calcium pools within smooth muscle cells, which may lead to alterations in cellular metabolic activity or may be due to activities not related to calcium channel effects. Several mechanisms involving regulation of lipoprotein receptor synthesis, lipoprotein uptake or degradation, cholesterol ester hydrolytic activity and arterial matrix synthesis are discussed as potential sites of activity for calcium antagonists. A dihydropyridine channel antagonist, PN 200-110 (isradipine), has been shown to be a very potent antiatherogenic agent in the rabbit and also to be a potent inhibitor of smooth muscle cell matrix synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "PN 200-110 (isradipine) is a new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist with selective actions on the heart as well as the peripheral circulation. It selectively inhibits the sinus node but not atrioventricular conduction and its negative inotropic action is minimal, about 20 times weaker than its negative chronotropic effect. This in vitro pattern also expresses itself in vivo: partial suppression of the reflex tachycardia induced by its peripheral vasodilatation and no effect on the P-Q interval on the electrocardiogram even at large doses. The presence of first- or second-degree heart block should therefore not limit its use, whereas the sick sinus syndrome might. PN 200-110 does not decrease myocardial contractile force even in vagotomized animals with full beta blockade. PN 200-110 nevertheless lowers myocardial oxygen consumption mainly by its action on afterload. It should therefore be useful in angina pectoris. PN 200-110 is a powerful peripheral vasodilator. It preferentially dilates coronary, cerebral and skeletal muscle vasculature. Its long lasting (24 to 48 hours) antihypertensive action is not accompanied by tachycardia in spontaneously hypertensive rats and it enhances sodium and water excretion in normotensive rats. It should be useful in the treatment of hypertension, and, considering its pattern of cardiac actions, perhaps also as an after-load-reducing agent for the treatment of heart failure. Antiarteriosclerotic effects in conscious rabbits were found at reasonably small doses, suggesting that such effects might occur in man at therapeutic doses.\r"

In order to eliminate compensatory reflexes that may mask negative inotropic and chronotropic effects of blood pressure-lowering agents, the animals were vagotomized and pretreated with 1 mg/kg propranolol. Dose-response curves were obtained with 4 doses of each drug in 6 animals. The doses were chosen to cause comparable decreases in blood pressure. PN 200-110 had the highest efficacy with respect to peripheral vasodilatation (increase in total peripheral conductance) and coronary blood flow, measured with radioactive-labeled microspheres. It did not decrease myocardial contractile force (measured with a strain gauge). The 2 other compounds caused biphasic changes in coronary blood flow and cardiac output. Their efficacy with respect to peripheral vasodilatation was limited by cardiodepression. Their dose-response curve for cardiodepression was flat at the 2 smaller doses and became steeper at the 2 larger doses. Nifedipine did not change heart rate; PN 200-110 decreased it minimally and diltiazem had a dose-dependent negative chronotropic effect. After eliminating autonomic influences on the heart, direct myocardial effects of calcium antagonists become demonstrable in whole animals and can be compared with the vascular effects measured in the same animals.\r"

  ".W": "The interaction between beta-adrenoreceptor blockers and calcium antagonists may occasionally be dangerous. The effects of the new calcium antagonist PN 200-110 (isradipine) were compared with those of verapamil in 3 groups of conscious rabbits pretreated with either pindolol 0.3 mg/kg, propranolol 1 mg/kg intravenously or placebo. Each animal received PN 200-110 (0.01, 0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg) and 2 or more days later verapamil (0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg). The calcium antagonists were given to lower mean blood pressure to the same extent as in the placebo group. This blood pressure effect remained unchanged after pretreatment with pindolol or propranolol. Both PIN 200-110 and verapamil increased heart rate to the same extent as in the placebo group. Both beta blockers blunted the effect of PN 200-110 on heart rate but converted the verapamil-induced tachycardia to bradycardia. Propranolol blunted the PN 200-110-induced increase in cardiac output and total peripheral conductance, whereas the high verapamil dose decreased cardiac output and caused peripheral vasoconstriction in propranolol-pretreated animals. Thus, both agents lowered blood pressure by peripheral vasodilatation in the placebo group, after beta blockade; however, the mechanism of the verapamil-induced blood pressure decrease changed from pure vasodilation to a decrease in cardiac output, i.e., cardiac depression. Verapamil but not PN 200-110 prolonged the PQ interval, especially in animals who had received beta blockade. Most differences in the interaction were attributable to differences between the 2 calcium antagonists; the differences between the beta blockers were small and in favor of pindolol.\r"
