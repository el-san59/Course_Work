Using the patch-clamp technique to record single ion channel activity, we have identified for the first time two kinds of calcium channels through which the divalent ion may enter chicken granulosa cells. The cells were maintained in primary culture whose basal and hormone-stimulated progesterone production was evaluated at different times in culture and at different temperatures. A small channel, with a conductance of 4-5 picosiemens (pS), had short openings and inactivated rapidly. A large channel had a conductance of 20-30 pS, a high activation threshold, and slow inactivation kinetics. The dihydropyridine compound Bay K-8644, a L-calcium channel agonist, significantly increased the activity of the large channel, and nifedipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, inhibited it completely. Both types of channels were seen in functionally competent signal-responsive granulosa cells cultured for up to 48 h. Whether these channels are involved in steroidogenesis, protein production, and/or secretion remains to be established.\r"

  ".W": "High density lipoprotein (HDL)-derived cholesterol is preferentially utilized by rat luteal cells for steroid synthesis. This process is mediated, at least in part, by the HDL receptor. The regulation of the HDL receptor by intracellular cholesterol concentration in the ovary was assessed in the present study. Superovulated rats were treated with 4-aminopyrozolo [3, 4-d] pyrimidine (4-APP), which inhibits lipoprotein synthesis by the liver, to determine the effects of reduced levels of intracellular cholesterol on HDL receptor expression. Pseudopregnant rats were treated with 4-APP or the vehicle on days 3, 4, and 5 of pseudopregnancy. On day 6 rats were killed and ovarian membranes isolated for binding studies. Treatment with 4-APP resulted in almost a 50% decrease in serum cholesterol level 24 h later. A similar effect was observed on the level of ovarian esterified cholesterol. The binding of apolipoprotein E-free HDL to ovarian plasma membranes increased up to 34%. The effects of increased intracellular cholesterol on HDL receptor binding was then determined. Pseudopregnant rats received two injections of aminoglutethimide or vehicle on day 5 of pseudopregnancy at 10 h intervals for a period of 20 h. Rats were decapitated 10 h after the second injection of aminoglutethimide, and [125I] HDL binding studies were performed in ovarian plasma membranes. The treatment increased ovarian free and esterified cholesterol 27% and 70%, respectively. The number of binding sites for HDL in ovarian membranes increased up to 31% in response to the treatment. The evidence suggests that the HDL receptor may play a dual role in HDL metabolism. The receptor may increase to promote influx of cholesterol when intraovarian cholesterol stores are reduced and to promote cholesterol efflux when stores of intraovarian cholesterol are increased. Thus, HDL receptor appears to play a crucial role in the regulation of ovarian cholesterol level.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to determine whether intermittent synthetic human PTH-related protein (PTHrP 1-34) will mimic the anabolic effect of PTH and increase bone mass in rats. Dose response experiments were done on young, male Sprague-Dawley rats given sc vehicle, human (h) PTH (1-34) at 8 micrograms/100 g or PTHrP (1-34) at 1-32 micrograms/100 g daily for 12 days or 26 days. On the last day, 3 h after injections, rats were killed and serum, femurs, and tibias harvested. Trabecular and cortical bone of distal half femurs were analyzed for calcium (Ca) and hydroxyproline content and dry weight. Tibia metaphyseal bone was analyzed using conventional histomorphometry techniques. Our results showed that low doses of PTHrP (1-34) did not increase bone mass or bone forming surfaces. After 12 days, PTH, at 8 micrograms/100 g, increased trabecular Ca, dry weight, and hydroxyproline by approximately 19%, 36%, and 53%, respectively, while the bone mass of PTHrP-treated rats was comparable to vehicle-treated rats. PTHrP at a higher dose of 32 micrograms/100 g, increased trabecular bone mass by 30-37%, compared to the 43-48% increase induced by PTH at 8 micrograms/100 g after 12 days. When treatment was extended to 26 days, PTHrP, at 16 micrograms/100 g, increased trabecular bone mass by 24-36%, respectively, compared to the 43-61% increase induced by PTH at 8 micrograms/100 g. Unlike PTH, which increased cortical bone mass by 15-25%, PTHrP increased cortical bone mass only at the highest dose tested, 32 micrograms/100 g. Bone forming surfaces but not bone apposition rate were increased by PTH and PTHrP while resorption measures remained comparable to control values. Although serum Ca and Pi remained in the physiological range for all rats, the values for PTHrP-treated rats were consistently higher. In conclusion, PTHrP (1-34) was less potent and less effective than PTH (1-34) in inducing an anabolic response in bone in vivo.\r"

In this study we have used in vitro translation assays to ascertain the number of 24 K translation products of normal pituitary messenger RNA (mRNA), and, finding only one, have used both in vitro translation assays and subcellular fractionation to determine the intracellular site of the posttranslational modification of this single translation product. Translation of mRNA from normal pituitary tissue or GH3 cells resulted in the apparent production of a number of pre-PRLs, but in only a single rough microsome-processed form of PRL, 24 K isoform 2. Longer term translation assays utilizing a variety of isotopes failed to show any evidence for rough microsomal posttranslational modification of isoform 2. Subcellular fractionation, using a discontinuous sucrose gradient, however, produced a membrane-bound large secretory granule fraction which, when isolated, contained essentially only isoform 2, and which had the capacity to convert isoform 2 to isoforms 3 and 3' by posttranslational phosphorylation.\r"

We have investigated this phenomenon using primary cultures of osteoblasts and the clonal osteoblast-like cell line ROS 17/2. Conditioned medium from PTH-stimulated populations of either culture increases bone resorption compared to conditioned medium measured in three independent assay systems; the isolated osteoclast assay system, elicited macrophages, and the fetal bone rudiment system. Characterization of the factor(s) of PTH-stimulated osteoblast-like cell (ROS 17/2) suggests that the compound(s) is not prostaglandin (no inhibition by indomethacin; not extractable in diethylacetate). Rather, it is heat and protease sensitive. In addition, secretion of the product is sensitive to cycloheximide. These findings lead us to the conclusion that the factor(s) is protein. Further work demonstrates the necessity for a divalent cation for retention of factor activity. Finally, we have estimated the molecular radius of the factor as about 110,000 daltons and perhaps a second at about 70,000 daltons using a sizing column. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of [35S]methionine-labeled PTH-stimulated ROS culture supernatants reveals relatively increased secretion of proteins with these approximate molecular radii.\r"

The cultures were made up almost exclusively of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, as confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence staining with monoclonal antibodies to galactocerebroside and glial fibrillary acidic protein, respectively. After 3 weeks of culture, the oligodendrocytes were also highly immunoreactive to monospecific polyclonal antibodies against cytochrome P450scc, an enzyme involved in the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone (P). Biosynthesis of [3H]cholesterol, [3H]P, and [3H]Pregn-5-ene-3 beta, 20 alpha-diol was demonstrated in these primary cultures by incubating cells with [3H]mevalonolactone in the presence of mevinolin and trilostane. The activity of the 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase enzyme, a documented indicator of oligodendrocyte differentiation, increased rapidly after day 10 of culture, together with the onset of steroid biosynthetic activity. Both reached a maximum at 3 weeks of culture and remained stable up to 6.5 weeks. In the absence of trilostane, [3H]P was converted by glial cell cultures to [3H]progesterone, [3H]5 alpha-pregnane-3,20-dione, and [3H]3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one. The demonstration of P, pregn-5-ene-3 beta,20 alpha-diol, and progesterone synthesis by normal rat glial cells, once oligodendrocytes have undergone their differentiation process, brings additional support to the concept of \"neurosteroids.\"\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the regulation of chondroblast/chondrocyte differentiation using a unique clonal cell population, designated RCJ 3.1C5 (C5), which differentiates into discrete three-dimensional cartilage nodules when grown in the presence of 15% fetal calf serum. Histologically, the nodules resembled hyaline cartilage; they contained large rounded chondrocytes surrounded by a refractile matrix which stained intensely with Alcian blue, exhibited metachromasia after Toluidine blue staining, and stained with an antibody against type II collagen. The cartilage nodules that formed did not mineralize, despite the presence of organic phosphate in the culture medium. The synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX) increased the number of cartilage nodules formed in a dose-dependent manner (ED50, approximately 10(-9) M), with a maximal stimulatory dose of 10(-8) M. DEX had no effect on the population doubling time and saturation density. The effects of DEX on the number of cartilage nodules were similar whether it was added from the beginning of the culture period (starting during exponential growth) or at confluence. In contrast, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] inhibited cartilage nodule formation in a dose-dependent manner (IC50, approximately 5 x 10(-10) M), with maximum inhibition at 10(-7) M. In addition, 1,25-(OH)2D3 decreased cell proliferation and saturation density. Equimolar doses of the vitamin D3 metabolites 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 had no effect. C5 cells treated with 1,25-(OH)2D3 in the absence of DEX during the exponential growth phase exhibited a reduced capacity to form cartilage nodules upon subsequent exposure to DEX. At confluence, before cartilage nodules had formed, C5 cells responded to PTH and prostaglandin-E2 with increases in intracellular cAMP of about 10- and 95-fold respectively. After cartilage nodules were present, prostaglandin-E2 responsiveness decreased to about 25-fold, whereas there was no significant change in PTH responsiveness. DEX decreased the population alkaline phosphatase levels at all times measured, whereas 1,25-(OH)2D3 had a biphasic effect: an increase at 5 days in culture, followed by a decrease at later times in culture. These data indicate that the clonal cell line RCJ 3.1C5 is a useful model system in which to investigate cartilage differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "Ovarian steroids act on unidentified neurons to trigger preovulatory secretion of GnRH. In the rat, important steroid target cells reside in the anterior medial preoptic nucleus (AMPN), a sexually dimorphic structure essential for stimulatory effects of ovarian steroids on LH secretion. The AMPN contains neurotensin (NT)-immunoreactive neurons, and immunoneutralization of NT in the preoptic region markedly attenuates steroid-induced LH surges. Using probes derived from the rat gene that encodes NT and neuromedin N (NT/N), we investigated the ability of estrogen to influence NT/N mRNA levels in the AMPN. Ovariectomized rats were treated for 14 days with sham capsules or capsules that produce supraphysiological serum levels of 17 beta-estradiol (250 +/- 20 pg/ml). As determined by in situ hybridization, estradiol markedly altered the distribution of NT/N mRNA in the medial preoptic region, causing a striking increase in NT/N mRNA abundance specifically in the AMPN and adjacent medial preoptic nucleus (MPN). In contrast, estradiol caused no obvious changes in labeling in the lateral septum, diagonal band of Broca, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and lateral preoptic area. The distribution of NT/N mRNA in the AMPN of normal male rats closely resembled that in ovariectomized rats, where labeled cells were rarely observed. Microdissection and S1 nuclease protection analysis were used to quantitate the effect of estradiol on NT/N mRNA levels. Supraphysiological estradiol treatment for 14 days caused a 3.4-fold increase (P less than 0.0002) in NT/N mRNA levels in the combined AMPN/MPN, whereas levels in the central amygdaloid nucleus remained constant, providing further evidence of regional specificity. Forty-eight hours of estradiol treatment, at concentrations (60 +/- 1 pg/ml) similar to those observed on the morning of proestrus, caused a 1.8-fold increase (P less than 0.001) in NT/N mRNA levels in the AMPN/MPN, indicating that the time course of NT/N mRNA induction by estrogen is compatible with events of the normal estrous cycle. Together with previous findings, our results strongly suggest that NT neurons mediate, directly or indirectly, stimulatory effects of ovarian steroids on GnRH secretion.\r"

The influence of each agent on DNA and protein synthesis was studied using bone-derived primary cell cultures. Both forms of FGF were relatively more mitogenic for bone cell populations with fewer osteoblastic (Ob) characteristics than for Ob-enriched cultures. However, in the Ob cultures, bFGF was intrinsically 10-fold more stimulatory than aFGF, whereas heparin enhanced the mitotic response only to aFGF. An optimal dose of either aFGF or bFGF (100 ng/ml) decreased alkaline phosphatase activity and increased the rate of noncollagen and collagen protein synthesis in Ob cultures. The stimulatory effect was relatively greater on noncollagen than on collagen synthesis, which resulted in a decrease in percent collagen synthesis. Neither factor altered the rate of collagen degradation. Furthermore, hydroxyurea diminished, but did not prevent, the stimulatory effect of each factor on rates of protein synthesis. In contrast, polyacrylamide gel analysis of newly synthesized protein and Northern blot analysis of steady state alpha 1 type I procollagen mRNA indicated differential effects by each agent on procollagen synthesis and processing. These studies suggest that the FGFs may produce their effects on Ob cells through both shared and disparate mechanisms, with the net result being a decrease in the expression of the osteoblastic phenotype.\r"

  ".W": "Inhibin and activin are gonadal glycoproteins that selectively inhibit and stimulate FSH release, respectively. Previously we have reported that transforming growth factor-beta inhibited hCG-stimulated testosterone formation in mature Leydig cells. In the present study we evaluated the effects of other members of the transforming growth factor-beta family, inhibin and activin, on Leydig cell function. We found that activin (0.1-10 ng/ml) had no effect on basal testosterone formation, but inhibited hCG-stimulated testosterone formation in a dose-dependent manner. Activin (10 ng/ml) inhibited hCG-stimulated testosterone formation by 42%. Activin also inhibited hCG-stimulated cAMP formation. In the presence of activin (5 ng/ml), forskolin (10 microM)- and 8-bromo-cAMP (0.1 mM)-induced testosterone formation were reduced about one third. Conversions of pregnenolone and progesterone to testosterone were also blocked by activin. Interestingly, [125I]hCG binding to Leydig cells and forskolin-induced cAMP formation were not affected by the addition of activin. In contrast to activin, inhibin (0.1-10 ng/ml) had no effect on hCG-induced testosterone formation at any concentration used. However, the inhibitory effects of activin on Leydig cell function were reversed by the concomitant addition of inhibin. Our results suggest that activin inhibits testosterone formation by the Leydig cells derived from normal mature rats. Multiple steps of the steroidogenic pathway are affected by testosterone. Inhibin alone has no effect, but reverses the inhibitory action of activin.\r"

A side-fraction from the purification of bovine follicular fluid inhibin with high levels of inhibin immunoactivity relative to its inhibin bioactivity was fractionated through a sequence of procedures which included triazine dye affinity and phenyl-Sepharose chromatography, gel permeation chromatography on Sephadex G-100, reverse phase HPLC, and preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The first of the two proteins identified had a molecular mass of 25-26K under reducing and nonreducing conditions and a NH2-terminal sequence identical to that of 43K inhibin alpha-subunit and showed minimal activity (less than 2% activity) compared with bovine 31K inhibin in either the inhibin in vitro bioassay or the RIA. These data suggest that this protein is the alpha 1-166 sequence of the bovine inhibin alpha-subunit (designated alpha N-subunit), most likely released after processing of either the inhibin alpha-subunit precursor or the 43K alpha-subunit involved in the conversion of 58K to 31K inhibin. The other protein identified (designated pro-alpha C-subunit) has a molecular mass of 27K under nonreducing conditions and 20K and 6K under reducing conditions. It is inactive in the in vitro bioassay, although highly reactive in the inhibin RIA, and has NH2-termini identical to the pro sequence of the inhibin alpha-subunit precursor and the 20K alpha-subunit sequence. These results suggest that pro-alpha C is a disulfide-linked structure and may represent an intermediate in the dimerisation of alpha- and beta-subunits to form inhibin while the alpha N-subunit is probably a proteolytic product of either the alpha-subunit precursor or 58K inhibin.\r"

  ".W": "Adenosine produces a concentration-dependent increase in pinealocyte cAMP (EC50, approximately 0.3 nM) and cGMP accumulation (EC50, approximately 0.7 nM). Maximal increases in both nucleotides are evident 10 min after treatment; 1 h later values return to pretreatment levels. Concentration-dependent effects on cAMP are also observed with N6-(L-2-phenylisopropyl)adenosine (EC50, approximately 0.75 nM), 5'-N-ethylcarboxy aminoadenosine (EC50, approximately 0.75 nM), and 2-chloroadenosine (EC50, approximately 2.0 nM); the EC50 values for stimulation of cGMP with these agents are higher by a factor of 2-10. In the case of 5'-N-ethylcarboxy amidoadenosine, the concentration-response curve is biphasic, with a significant effect evident within the range of 1-100 pM. The stimulatory nature of this response and the relative potency of the agonists tested are consistent with the involvement of an A2-like adenosine receptor. Comparison of adenosine and the selective beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol indicated that their maximal EC50 values were generally similar. Studies with antagonists revealed that both 8-(p-sulfophenyl)theophylline (1 microM) and the xanthine amine congener (8-[4-[[[(2-aminoethyl)carbonyl]methyl]oxy]phenyl]1,3- dipropylxanthine (1 microM) inhibited the effects of adenosine (1 nM to 1 microM), but xanthine amine congener was more potent; the latter was markedly effective at 0.1 nM, whereas 8-(p-sulfophenyl)theophylline was nearly ineffective at this concentration. It was also determined that pineal cells generate extracellular adenosine from extracellular ATP. ATP is thought to be released along with catecholamines during neurotransmission. Hence, these studies support the view that adenosine could participate in the transsynaptic regulation of pineal function.\r"

  ".W": "It has recently been shown that GH increases the number of available hepatic receptors for epidermal growth factor (EGF). In the present study the effects of the sexually dimorphic plasma GH pattern (higher pulsatility in male rats) on hepatic EGF binding and EGF receptor mRNA concentration were investigated. The specific binding of [125I]EGF to purified liver membranes was about 2-fold higher in male rats than in females on days 35, 50, and 80 of life. EGF receptor mRNA levels, as determined by an RNase protection solution hybridization assay, were higher in males only on days 47-50. Hypophysectomy on day 50 reduced the EGF receptor mRNA concentration to a level that did not differ between male and female rats. In hypophysectomized rats of both sexes, intermittent GH treatment (sc injections every 12 h for 7 days) enhanced hepatic EGF receptor mRNA concentrations to normal male levels, while continuous GH administration was less effective. Northern blot analysis indicated that transcripts with apparent sizes of 9.5 and 6.6 kilobases were dependent on the plasma GH pattern. Intermittent iv GH replacement therapy for 5 days given at 3-h intervals by an automatic iv infusion system increased the hepatic EGF receptor mRNA concentration as well as specific EGF binding, whereas continuous iv GH infusion was ineffective. These results show that a pulsatile plasma GH pattern, similar to that of male rodents, is markedly more effective in enhancing hepatic EGF receptor mRNA levels and EGF binding than a continuous feminine GH pattern. These results are consistent with a pretranslatory stimulation of EGF receptor synthesis by pulsatile GH.\r"

We have examined the excretion of T4G, T4S, T3 and rT3 glucuronide (T3G and rT3G) in bile, collected under pentobarbital anesthesia 0-8 h or 17-18 h after iv [125I]T4 injection to control and 6-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU)-treated rats. Radioactivity in bile, plasma, feces, and urine was analyzed by Sephadex LH-20 chromatography and HPLC. PTU induced a 2-fold increase in the biliary excretion of total radioactivity (26.6% vs. 15.0% dose between 0-8 h; 2.0% vs. 1.0% dose between 17-18 h). Biliary metabolites, 17-18 h after T4 injection, in control vs. PTU rats amounted to (percent dose): T4G, 0.44 vs. 0.75; T3G, 0.19 vs. 0.07; rT3G, 0.02 vs. 0.15; and T4S, 0.06 vs. 0.32. Similar results were obtained for control rats when bile was collected between 7-8 h after iv T4. The excretion rate of T3G was lower and that of rT3G higher when bile was continuously collected for 8 h immediately after T4 administration, probably due to prolonged experimental stress. However, regardless of the period of bile collection, PTU induced a more than 24-fold decrease in the T3G/rT3G ratio and a 5-fold increase in T4S excretion. In the animals killed 18 h after T4 injection, PTU treatment increased plasma T4 retention by 50%, reduced urinary I- excretion by 74%, and increased fecal radioactivity by 47%. No conjugates were detected in feces, and the distribution of fecal T4:T3:rT3 was 70:18:2 in control and 68:7:6 in PTU-treated rats. The results indicate that 1) the glucuronidative clearance of T4 is not affected by PTU; 2) the T3G/rT3G ratio in bile is a sensitive indicator of type I deiodinase inhibition; 3) T4 undergoes significant sulfation in rats in vivo, and 4) biliary excretion of T4S is enhanced if its type I deiodination is inhibited.\r"

  ".W": "The metabolism of T3 by isolated rat hepatocytes was analyzed by Sephadex LH-20 chromatography, HPLC, and RIA for T3 sulfate (T3S) and 3,3'-diiodothyronine (3,3'-T2). Type I iodothyronine deiodinase activity was inhibited with propylthiouracil (PTU), and phenol sulfotransferase activity by SO4(2-) depletion or with competitive substrates or inhibitors. Under normal conditions, labeled T3 glucuronide and I- were the main products of [3'-125I]T3 metabolism. Iodide production was decreased by inhibition (PTU) or saturation (greater than 100 nM T3) of type I deiodinase, which was accompanied by the accumulation of T3S and 3,3'-T2S. Inhibition of phenol sulfotransferase resulted in decreased iodide production, which was associated with an accumulation of 3,3'-T2 and 3,3'-T2 glucuronide, independent of PTU. Formation of 3,3'-T2 and its conjugates was only observed at T3 substrate concentrations below 10 nM. Thus, T3 is metabolized in rat liver cells by three quantitatively important pathways: glucuronidation, sulfation, and direct inner ring deiodination. Whereas T3 glucuronide is not further metabolized in the cultures, T3S is rapidly deiodinated by the type I enzyme. As confirmed by incubations with isolated rat liver microsomes, direct inner ring deiodination of T3 is largely mediated by a low Km, PTU-insensitive, type III-like iodothyronine deiodinase, and production of 3,3'-T2 is only observed if its rapid sulfation is prevented.\r"

In both groups mast cells were present in the capsule of the testes and occasionally in vicinity of intratesticular blood vessels. Histamine stimulated T production in a dose dependent manner in incubations of regressed testes of SD animals, but had no stimulatory effect in the active testes of LD animals. In the incubations of SD testes, the effects of HA were abolished by the H-1 antagonist pyrilamine, but unaffected by the H-2 antagonist cimetidine. In both groups, HA enhanced the stimulatory effects of hCG. These results indicate that HA has steroidogenic activity in the testis and may be a factor involved in the regulation of Leydig cell function.\r"

  ".U": "90005165\r", 
  ".W": "We and others have recently shown that amino terminal sequences of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and parathyroid hormone related peptide (PTHrP), which share a 62% homology within the first 13 residues, bind to the same receptor on ROS 17/2.8 cells. The remaining PTHrP sequence is markedly different from PTH, suggesting that receptor binding may be dependent on the first 13 amino acids of either peptide. However, since the amino acid residues 14-34 have previously been recognized as an important binding domain for PTH, conformational similarity within this portion's secondary structure of both peptides could contribute to their capacity to bind to the same receptor. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized [Tyr36,Cys38]PTHrP-(14-38) and [Tyr34]bPTH(14-34)NH2, and studied binding of both peptides to the common PTH/PTHrP receptor on ROS 17/2.8 cells. Radioiodinated, HPLC-purified [Nle8,18, Tyr34]bPTH(1-34)NH2 (NlePTH) and [Tyr36]PTHrP-(1-36)NH2 were used to functionally define receptor binding requirements. [Tyr36,Cys38]PTHrP(14-38) and [Tyr34]bPTH(14-34)NH2 competed with 125I-NlePTH for binding sites on ROS 17/2.8 cells with apparent Kds of 10 microM and 50 microM respectively. Both peptides also competed with 125I-[Tyr36]PTHrP(1-36)NH2 with apparent Kds of 30 microM and 10 microM respectively. In the same assay system, NlePTH and [Tyr36,Cys38]PTHrP(1-38)inhibited binding of either radioiodinated ligand with apparent Kds of 0.3 and 1.0 nM. These studies indicate that although [Tyr34]bPTH(14-34)NH2 and [Tyr36,Cys38]PTHrP(14-38) share virtually no sequence homology, their secondary structures must be sufficiently similar to permit binding to a common PTH/PTHrP receptor.\r"

Recent studies suggest VIP synthesis within the rat anterior pituitary. We have shown (Endocrinology 124:1077) that the content of rat pituitary VIP increases in hypothyroidism. To confirm in situ pituitary synthesis of VIP and determine whether thyroid hormone effects on pituitary VIP relate to changes in VIP mRNA, Northern and in situ hybridization analyses of VIP mRNA in rat pituitaries were performed. Northern hybridization demonstrated an RNA species from rat pituitary consistent with rat VIP mRNA. Hypothyroidism increased the content of pituitary VIP mRNA, and replacement with 1-thyroxine prevented this increase. In situ hybridization showed multiple, widely-distributed hybridizing cells in pituitaries from hypothyroid animals. A distinct population of VIP-producing pituitary cells exists which may serve to modulate prolactin secretion in a paracrine or autocrine fashion.\r"

Competitive binding assays demonstrated that mPL-Ir, mouse placental lactogen-II (mPL-II), and mouse PRL (mPRL) bind to the same receptors in ovarian membranes. The relative abilities of the three hormones to displace [125I]iodo-mPL-Ir from the ovarian lactogen receptors was mPL-II greater than mPL-Ir much greater than mPRL. Scatchard analysis of mPL-Ir binding to ovarian membranes from day 10 pregnant mice showed a Ka of 2.0 x 10(9) M-1 and a binding capacity of 3.2 x 10(-14) mol/mg membrane protein. The specific binding of [125I]iodo-mPL-Ir to ovarian membrane preparations was significantly higher on day 17 than on day 10 of gestation. Dissociation of endogenous hormones with 4 M MgCl2 increased the binding of [125I]iodo-mPL-Ir to ovarian membranes but not to liver membranes. Affinity cross-linking of [125I]iodo-mPL-Ir to liver and ovarian membranes resulted in the specific labeling of proteins with receptor mol wt (Mr) of 44K and 40K (nonreduced) and 50K and 42K (reduced), as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The lactogen receptors from liver and ovary appeared structurally homologous, producing fragments with similar Mr when treated with proteolytic enzymes and undergoing similar reductions in Mr when treated with glycolytic enzymes. The ability of mPLs to bind specifically and with high affinity to receptors in mouse ovarian membranes suggests that these hormones may regulate ovarian function during gestation.\r"

We previously have purified the beta-core molecule and have deduced portions of its carbohydrate structure based on lectin binding data. In the present study we used recently developed technology to determine the carbohydrate composition of beta-core and hCG beta (CR119). For direct compositional analysis, parallel samples were hydrolyzed in trifluoroacetic acid and analyzed for sialic acid and neutral sugars without prior derivatization. Separation of the monosaccharides was achieved by HPLC on a Dionex CarboPac column eluted at high pH, and the resolved monosaccharides were quantified by pulsed amperometric detection. The amounts of sugar that were found relative to peptide indicated the presence of two N-linked oligosaccharides per molecule on both beta-core and hCG beta. hCG beta contained additional sugars consistent with the presence of four O-linked oligosaccharides. Compared to hCG beta, beta-core contained negligible sialic acid, galactose, or N-acetylgalactosamine. The compositional data suggest that beta-core does not contain N-acetylglucosamine at the nonreducing end of the molecule, whereas the trimannosyl-chitobiose core is apparently intact at both glycosylation sites, consistent with the ability of the molecule to bind to Concanavalin-A. Comparable fucose contents and abilities of beta-core and hCG beta to bind to Lens culinaris indicate a similar extent of fucosylation on the internal N-acetylglucosamine in both molecules. We propose that the N-linked oligosaccharides on beta-core closely resemble the underlying N-linked structures of hCG beta with the antennary sialic acid, galactose, and N-acetylglucosamine removed.\r"

PAM is present in high amounts in heart atrial myocytes and the pituitary gland, where activity is present in both soluble and membrane forms. We used AtT-20 cells, a mouse corticotrope tumor cell line, and primary heart atrial cultures to establish the occurrence of tissue-specific regulation of PAM expression. In the AtT-20 cells, PAM expression is regulated in parallel with the source of its peptide substrate, pro-ACTH/endorphin. PAM mRNA levels are increased to 132 +/- 5% of control values by treatment with (Bu)2-cAMP and decreased to 55 +/- 7% of control values by treatment with dexamethasone. Treatment with (Bu)2cAMP decreases PAM specific activity in the AtT-20 cells to 68 +/- 4% of the control value, presumably due to secretion of enzyme from the cells; dexamethasone treatment decreases PAM specific activity to 57 +/- 1% of the control value. In contrast, in heart atrial cultures, dexamethasone stimulates PAM expression. In atrial cultures exposed to dexamethasone for 48 h, PAM mRNA and PAM specific activity are elevated to 230 +/- 50% and 220 +/- 20% of control values, respectively; secretion of PAM activity is increased to 230% of the control value. As for AtT-20 cells, treatment of atrial cultures with (Bu)2cAMP increases PAM mRNA levels. Thus, PAM expression is regulated in a tissue-specific manner by dexamethasone in the two tissues examined. In AtT-20 cells, time-course studies and studies with cycloheximide indicate that dexamethasone exerts its effects on PAM mRNA levels by an indirect mechanism involving protein synthesis.\r"

They have a half-life of dissociation of steroid-receptor complexes of 96 +/- 11 h and a 5S sedimentation coefficient for the untransformed moiety, with the appearance of a 3.5S species after incubation at 24 C for 30 min. They do not acquire DNA-binding capability after heat- or salt-attempted activation. Cytosol binders precipitate upon 90% saturation with (NH4)SO4 and have higher affinity for DHT than mibolerone. The half-life for dissociation of complexes is 85 +/- 14 h, and the complex sediments as an 8S moiety which is able to transform to a 4.4S form after heat activation correlated with increased DNA-binding ability of these species. Unactivated cytosol steroid-receptor complexes are also able to bind to DNA in the presence of molybdate. Salt-induced activation of cytosol moieties only occurred in the absence of molybdate. Microsomal androgen receptor is more stable than cytosol androgen receptor independently of the presence of hormone or partial purification of the moieties; the inactivation rates of the two forms of complexes differ 3-fold. Results indicate that androgen-binding sites associated with the microsomal and cytosolic fractions of the prostate are distinct entities.\r"

  ".W": "The development of deer antler follows a pattern similar to that described for mammalian endochondral ossification and has been proposed as a suitable model for studies of bone growth. We investigated seasonal changes in the plasma concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)2D] and calcium and the activity of alkaline phosphatase in relation to the antler cycle during 1 yr in 4 captive roe deer and measured these biological parameters in 27 wild roe deer during their antler cycle. A significant elevation of 1,25-(OH)2D in peripheral plasma, with no parallel increase in the concentration of its precursor 25-hydroxyvitamin D, was observed to accompany the rapid growth phase of the antler cycle in captive (P less than 0.001) and wild (P less than 0.025) deer. During the same phase there was a gradient in levels of 1,25-(OH)2D in antler vs. jugular blood (P less than 0.01). In addition, velvet cells in culture proved to have the ability to convert 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 into a more polar derivative, which was indistinguishable from true 1,25-(OH)2D3 with regard to its chromatographic properties, its UV absorbance at 254 nm, and its ability to bind to the 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors present in chick intestinal cytosol. These in vivo and in vitro results strongly suggest that local production of 1,25-(OH)2D by the antler cells does occur in vivo and may contribute to the increase in plasma 1,25-(OH)2D during bone growth.\r"

  ".W": "In whole brain of chick embryos insulin receptors are highest at the end of embryonic development, while insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptors dominate in the early stages. These studies provided evidence for developmental regulation of both types of receptors, but they did not provide information on possible differences between brain regions at each developmental stage or within one region at different embryonic ages. We have now localized the specific binding of [125I]insulin and [125I]IGF-I in sections of head and brain using autoradiography and computer-assisted densitometric analysis. Embryos have been studied from the latter part of organogenesis (days 6 and 12) through late development (day 18, i.e. 3 days before hatching), and the binding patterns have been compared with those in the adult brain. At all ages the binding of both ligands was to discrete anatomical regions. Interestingly, while in late embryos and adult brain the patterns of [125I]insulin and [125I] IGF-I binding were quite distinct, in young embryos both ligands showed very similar localization of binding. In young embryos the retina and lateral wall of the growing encephalic vesicles had the highest binding of both [125I]insulin and [125I]IGF-I. In older embryos, as in the adult brain, insulin binding was high in the paleostriatum augmentatum and molecular layer of the cerebellum, while IGF-I binding was prominent in the hippocampus and neostriatum. The mapping of receptors in a vertebrate embryo model from early prenatal development until adulthood predicts great overlap in any possible function of insulin and IGF-I in brain development, while it anticipates differential localized actions of the peptides in the mature brain.\r"

In this paper we have used in situ hybridization and quantitative autoradiography to determine whether testosterone (T) and/or its metabolites modulate the biosynthetic capacity of VP neurons in the BNST of adult male rats. In Exp 1 the number of labeled cells and the average number of grains per cell were compared in sections sampled through the BNST of intact, castrated, and castrated male rats treated with physiological levels of T (1.6 +/- 0.1 ng/ml plasma). Castration dramatically reduced the number of labeled cells (P less than 0.01) and the intensity of labeling (P less than 0.05) of cells in the BNST. T, treatment of castrated animals reversed the effect of castration on both cell number and grains per cell. In Exp 2 treatment of castrated rats with supraphysiological levels of T (7.6 +/- 0.7 ng/ml plasma) increased the number of labeled BNST cells (P less than 0.05) and the intensity of labeling (P less than 0.05) over those in castrates treated with physiological levels of T or intact rats. These results indicate that T and/or its metabolites modulate expression of the VP gene by neurons in the BNST of adult male rats.\r"

Human (h) GH (2 nM) treatment of 3T3-F442A cells in serum-free medium caused a time-dependent (maximal at 48-72 h) and dose-dependent (EC50, approximately 0.2 nM) decrease (40-60%) in de nova protein synthesis. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I; 17 nM), PRL (2 nM), and glucagon (20 nM) did not decrease de novo protein synthesis, whereas bovine GH was equipotent with hGH. The half-lives of 35S-labeled proteins of 3T3-F442A cells were 21 and 57 h for cells maintained in serum-free medium for 3 days without or with hGH (2 nM), respectively. The total protein content of cells maintained in hGH (2 nM) for 1-4 days was unaffected compared to cells in serum-free medium alone. IGF-I (17 nM) treatment of cells for 4 days doubled the protein content of cells compared to control values in serum-free medium. hGH (2 nM) pretreatment of cells for 1-4 days had no effect on total RNA synthesis. hGH (2 nM) but not IGF-I (17 nM) treatment (3 days) resulted in a 7-fold decrease in cytoplasmic 18S rRNA content (as measured by DNA-RNA hybridization) of cells compared to that of control cells maintained in serum-free medium. When 3T3-F442A cells were transferred to serum-free medium there was a progressive decrease in DNA synthesis. The presence of hGH enhanced the rate at which DNA synthesis decreased for 3T3-F442A cells. IGF-I (17 nM) increased DNA synthesis by 6- and 8-fold after 2 and 3 days of IGF-I exposure. 3T3-F442A cells maintained in serum-free medium for 3 days responded to the addition of platelet-derived growth factor (2 U/ml) and insulin (1.6 microM) with a 56-fold increase in DNA synthesis, assayed 24 h later. 3T3-F442A cells treated with hGH (2 nM) for 3 days before platelet-derived growth factor and insulin addition exhibited a diminished DNA synthetic response, demonstrating that GH-exposed cells were partially refractory to mitogenic stimulation. GH had no effect on any aspect of macromolecular synthesis in 3T3-C2 cells, which have a low frequency of adipogenesis. Based upon these results a cell cycle model for the role of GH in the adipose differentiation of 3T3-F442A cells was proposed.\r"

  ".W": "Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) has been shown to stimulate melatonin synthesis in mammalian pineal; however, a regulatory role for VIP in the avian pineal has not been explored. Immunocytochemical and physiological response experiments were performed to investigate whether 1) immunoreactive VIP fibers innervated the avian pineal gland; 2) VIP had a specific effect on melatonin release that was mediated by cAMP stimulation; and 3) alpha 2-adrenergic signal transduction was associated with a reduction in cAMP levels. Immunocytochemical experiments demonstrated the presence of both tyrosine hydroxylase- and VIP-immunoreactive fibers in the avian pineal gland. Treatment of dispersed chick pineal cell cultures with VIP stimulated melatonin release (maximum 6-fold increase; EC50 = 1.8 nM) when administered during the 12-h light period of a 12-h light, 12-h dark cycle. Of the other four peptides tested [porcine VIP-(10-28), porcine peptide histidine isoleucine, porcine secretin, and human glucagon), only peptide histidine isoleucine stimulated melatonin release (EC50 = 30 nM). The effect of VIP was mediated by a time- and dose-dependent increase in cAMP accumulation (maximum 4-fold increase). The specific alpha 2-agonist UK-14,304 reduced cAMP accumulation (maximum 43% reduction) and inhibited melatonin release (EC50 = 19 nM) in the presence of 3 X 10(-8) M VIP. Norepinephrine-induced inhibition of nocturnal melatonin release was blocked by the elevation of cAMP achieved through the administration of forskolin (EC50 = 0.2 microM), isobutylmethylxanthine (EC50 = 112 microM), or 8-bromo-cAMP (EC50 = 166 microM). Collectively, these results demonstrate the presence and functional significance of VIP in the avian pineal gland, and the interaction of VIP and norepinephrine at the level of cAMP in the regulation of melatonin biosynthesis.\r"

  ".W": "Most of the growth-promoting effects of GH are mediated through insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). Pituitary GH gene expression is, in turn, inhibited by IGF-I. Since rat pituitary tissue and GH3 pituitary tumor cells express both the GH and the IGF-I genes, we have attempted to clarify their potential interactions in the somatotroph by examining hormonal factors involved in the regulation of pituitary IGF-I gene expression. IGF-I mRNA was measured in GH3 cells by a solution hybridization/RNase protection assay, using riboprobes to differentially protect the IGF-I variant mRNAs arising by alternative splicing at both the 5' untranslated (UT) and 3' ends of the primary transcript. GH3 cells contained both class A and class C 5' UT variant mRNAs, with a relative abundance similar to that found in the liver. Sixty-five percent of the total IGF-I mRNA in GH3 cells was processed at the 3' end to IGF-Ia, and 35% to IGF-Ib mRNAs, whereas in the liver the proportions were 85% and 15%, respectively. GH3 cells grown in thyroid hormone-depleted medium for 4 days contained low levels of IGF-I mRNA. T3 and human (h) GH induced total IGF-I mRNA content in thyroid hormone-depleted cells, with both 5' and 3' alternative transcripts regulated coordinately, an effect that was maximal at 48-72 h. T3 stimulation of GH3 IGF-I mRNA over 48 h was dose dependent (0.01-5 nM). Similarly, hGH (0.5-10 micrograms/ml) evoked a dose-dependent induction of IGF-I mRNA in the thyroid hormone-deficient GH3 cells. The effects of T3 (5 nM) and hGH (10 micrograms/ml) on IGF-I mRNA were not additive. Furthermore, the effects of both T3 and hGH were selective for IGF-I mRNA, as neither of these treatments stimulated PRL mRNA, and treatment with hGH decreased GH3 cell GH mRNA content. This model does not discriminate whether T3 has an independent effect on IGF-I gene expression or if its action is mediated solely through induction of GH. In conclusion, IGF-I mRNA transcripts are present in GH3 cells and are modulated by T3 and GH. Local paracrine or autocrine interactions may, therefore, be involved in the feedback control of GH secretion.\r"

The retina is largely uncharacterized with respect to IGF receptors. We, therefore, studied IGF receptors in bovine and murine retinal tissues by immunohistochemistry, autoradiographic localization, and affinity labeling. Notable IGF-II receptor immunoreactivity was found in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), with intermediate levels in choroid, low levels in the inner and outer plexiform layers and outer nuclear layer, and very low levels in other regions. Autoradiographic localization using [125I]IGF-II confirmed the IGF-II receptor immunohistochemistry. Autoradiographic localization using [125I]IGF-I labeled the nuclear layers and the photoreceptor region. Affinity labeling disclosed differences in the apparent mol wt of IGF-I and IGF-II receptors from bovine eye tissues and those from liver and brain. IGF-I receptor alpha-subunits (the IGF-binding subunit) migrated at: liver, 139,000; brain, 125,000; RPE, 125,000 and 135,000 (two sizes); and retina, 125,000 and 135,000. IGF-II receptors migrated at: liver, 245,000; brain, 235,000; RPE, 240,000; and retina, 230,000. We conclude that mammalian retina contains both IGF-I and -II receptors, which differ from those found in other tissues and have a characteristic spatial distribution within the retina.\r"

In the present work we have evaluated the ability of protein kinase-C to modulate receptor-and nonreceptor-mediated cAMP generation in acute suspension cultures of swine luteal cells. Cells were exposed to LH (1 micrograms/ml), forskolin (100 microM), cholera toxin (1 microgram/ml), pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml), and/or phorbol ester [12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)] for 0-90 min. TPA had no effect on basal cAMP accumulation, but increased (P less than 0.05) LH-, forskolin-, and cholera toxin-activated cAMP formation, with maximal facilitation at 30, 45, and 60 min, respectively. This facilitative effect was robust, as it could be demonstrated in both the presence and absence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (0.5 mM). TPA increased dose-dependent LH (0.1-1 microgram/ml)-, forskolin (3-300 microM-, and cholera toxin (0.3-10 microgram/ml)-stimulated cAMP accumulation. TPA induced a dose-dependent (0.3-30 ng/ml) increase in cAMP accumulation when incubated with the half-maximally effective (ED50) and maximally effective doses of LH (0.8 and 1 microgram/ml, respectively), forskolin (10 and 300 microM), and cholera toxin (0.2 and 3 micrograms/ml). TPA had an ED50 for this functional activation of 6.1 (67% confidence interval, 4.4-9.7) nM. The stimulatory effect of TPA could be mimicked by two synthetic diacylglycerols, 1,2-Dioctanoylglycerol and 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol, but not by inactive phorbol esters. In addition, TPA augmented the stimulatory effect of pertussis toxin when combined with maximally effective doses of LH, forskolin, and cholera toxin. The stimulatory action of TPA on cAMP production was limited to endogenous cellular adenylyl cyclase. Bacterially derived adenylyl cyclase toxin isolated from Bordetella pertussis resulted in a dose-dependent increase in cAMP formation over 60 min, which was not facilitated by phorbol ester. We conclude that stimulatory coupling exists between the calcium-dependent protein kinase-C and cAMP-generating systems in swine luteal cells. This stimulatory coupling is enacted in part at the levels of both the guanine binding and the catalytic subunits of adenylyl cyclase.\r"

Hepatocyte calcium sequestration and turnover were increased in both acute and chronic diabetes. Cytosolic free calcium (Cai2+) was significantly increased in the chronic diabetics, but the rise in Cai2+ evoked by epinephrine, angiotensin, vasopressin, and glucagon was depressed. The blunted stimulation of phosphorylase-alpha activity in the diabetics was influenced by a 50-60% decrease in total cell activity of glycogen phosphorylase and the decreased rise in cytosolic free calcium. Insulin replacement corrected both basal and stimulated changes in the acute diabetes model. Depressed [3H]inositol trisphosphate formation in response to epinephrine or vasopressin and increased intracellular organelle calcium buffering were observed in hepatocytes from diabetic animals; both may effect the diminished rise in Cai2+. Several possible causes for the depressed rise in Cai2+ after stimulation in chronic diabetic animals were eliminated: 1) the number and affinity of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors for epinephrine were normal; 2) the initial rise in calcium influx evoked by epinephrine or vasopressin was not depressed; and 3) the ability of inositol trisphosphate to release calcium from intracellular organelles was not changed. The results suggest that the diabetic changes in calcium-mediated endocrine regulation of hepatic carbohydrate metabolism contribute to the general pathology of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "To provide insight into the role of 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in postnatal androgen physiology, we administered the 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor finasteride to male rats from birth through the onset of puberty. In 4-week-old control rats serum testosterone levels averaged 0.21 ng/ml, and DHT levels averaged 0.64 ng/ml. By 7 weeks of age, testosterone levels increased more than 7-fold to 1.57 ng/ml, while the circulating DHT level declined to 0.26 ng/ml. In both the 4- and 7-week-old inhibitor-treated animals, circulating DHT levels were 25-50% of control values, and circulating testosterone levels were higher than control values. In 7-week-old inhibitor-treated rats, the weights of prostate, penis, seminal vesicles, and epididymal tissues were only 30-50% those of the controls. However, DHT formation is apparently not critical for postnatal development of the preputial glands or the androgen-dependent perineal muscles, since the weights of these tissues were not affected by treatment with inhibitor. Treatment with the 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor had no apparent effect on testicular histology or daily sperm production despite the fact that testicular DHT content was lower (70%) and testosterone content was higher (250%) than those in controls. We conclude that DHT formation is important for the normal postnatal growth of the prostate, seminal vesicles, epididymis, and penis and may be important for normal feedback control of testosterone production in rats, but that its formation is not critical for the onset of spermatogenesis or the development of the preputial glands or the androgen-dependent perineal muscles.\r"

Using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analyses we have recently shown that the primary IR-PRL protein in the rat brain has an apparent mol wt (Mr) of 24,000, which was identical to that of pituitary PRL. In these studies, brain and pituitary 24,000 Mr PRL were compared by peptide mapping and lectin chromatography. PRL-enriched fractions were prepared from the pituitary, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and pons-medulla and labeled with 125I. This material was further purified by immunoprecipitation, and immunopurified 24,000 Mr PRL was isolated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. Cleavage of 125I-labeled 24,000 Mr IR-PRL prepared from the pituitary and the three brain regions with chymotrypsin resulted in identical peptide maps with two primary labeled peptide fragments (5,500 and 6,000 Mr), and approximately five less intense fragments. Similarly, trypsin cleavage of brain and pituitary 24,000 Mr IR-PRL resulted in the production of two major fragments (6,200, and 5,200 Mr), and three less intense fragments. Cleavage of the 24,000 Mr IR-PRL with Staphylococcus V8 protease resulted in identical fragment patterns with two primary peptide fragments (14,000 and 6,200 Mr). When the pituitary and brain 24,000 Mr PRL were applied to Concanavalin-A-Sepharose columns no 24,000 Mr PRL was absorbed. The similarity of the peptide fragments obtained from the cleavage of the 24,000 Mr IR-PRL from the brain and pituitary clearly indicate that the IR-PRL found in the brain has an amino acid sequence that shares a high degree of structural homology with pituitary PRL.\r"

  ".W": "Several lines of experimental evidence suggest that acetylcholine and other cholinergic agonists are excitatory to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. To examine the site on the HPA axis that is stimulated by cholinergic agents, we evaluated the in vivo and in vitro effects of the muscarinic cholinergic agonist arecoline in intact and pituitary stalk-transected rats as well as on isolated rat hypothalami, dispersed anterior pituicytes, and adrenocortical cells in culture. Arecoline, injected iv to catheterized, freely moving male Sprague-Dawley rats, stimulated plasma ACTH and corticosterone release in a dose-dependent fashion. The muscarinic cholinergic antagonist atropine significantly blunted the ACTH response to arecoline. Pituitary stalk transection led to diminished plasma ACTH and corticosterone responses to arecoline. Similarly, previous administration of anti-CRH serum significantly blunted these responses. These findings suggest that arecoline stimulates the HPA axis centrally, mainly via secretion of CRH. This hypothesis was confirmed by the dose-dependent ability of arecoline to cause hypothalamic CRH secretion in vitro, an effect antagonized by atropine, and its failure to elicit ACTH and corticosterone secretion by dispersed anterior pituicytes and adrenocortical cells in culture, respectively. These data suggest that the muscarinic cholinergic agonist arecoline stimulates the HPA axis in the rat and that this effect is mediated mainly by the release of endogenous CRH. Arecoline, therefore, appears to be a compound suitable to selectively evaluate the responsiveness of the central component of the HPA axis.\r"

In the present study we looked for evidence that AII and K+ act through a common mechanism of signal transduction to affect secretion. Bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells were loaded with the calcium (Ca2+) probe aequorin to permit detection over prolonged time periods of the changes in cytosolic Ca2+ that occur in response to AII and K+. Perfusion fractions were collected for simultaneous measurement of aldosterone production rates. AII (10(-7) M) produced an immediate and transient increase in Ca2+, followed by a Ca2+ plateau that remained above baseline for as long as AII was present. An increase in K+ concentration (from 5 to 12 mM) produced a slow and eventually sustained increase in cytosolic Ca2+, which resembled the plateau produced by AII. Nitrendipine (10(-5) M) completely inhibited the secretory response to AII and K+ (during 60-min incubations) and inhibited the typical K+-induced increase in Ca2+. The sustained increase in Ca2+ with AII (the plateau) required extracellular Ca2+ and was proportional to the prevailing extracellular K+ concentration. When glomerulosa cells were incubated with AII, the aldosterone secretory response to K+ was substantially enhanced (P less than 0.001). In summary, stimulation by both AII and K+ resulted in a sustained increase in Ca2+ influx. AII-induced Ca2+ influx was dependent on the ambient K+ concentration. These results indicate that AII and K+ act together to determine the optimal rate of Ca2+ entry, which may then lead to the appropriate secretory rate of aldosterone.\r"

In this study, we sought to determine whether the nucleotide requirement of GTP for desensitization is complete and specific. LH-dependent desensitization of the adenylyl cyclase of pig ovarian follicular membranes was examined without adding adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate [AMP-P(NH)P] to prevent the degradation of nucleotide triphosphates. GTP at 0.1 mM or higher [in the absence of AMP-P(NH)P] was able to support the same amount of desensitization (30-35%) that occurs with 1 mM AMP-P(NH)P and micromolar concentrations of GTP. ATP, UTP, and CTP also supported maximal desensitization, but were 5-30 times less potent than GTP. The ED50 value for GTP (14 microM) was about 100 times higher than when the reaction was performed in the presence of 1 mM AMP-P(NH)P; the ED50 values for UTP (70 microM) and CTP and ATP (400 microM) were only 2-5 times higher than when AMP-P(NH)P was included. Incubation of [alpha-32P]GTP with pig follicular membranes demonstrated that 1 mM GTP was stable, whereas 10 microM or less was rapidly degraded unless 1 mM AMP-P(NH)P was included. The specificity of GTP for supporting desensitization was also demonstrated in experiments where guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate, the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, inhibited LH-induced desensitization which otherwise would have occurred in the presence of ATP, CTP, or UTP. These studies establish the complete and specific requirement of GTP for supporting desensitization of ovarian LH-responsive adenylyl cyclase.\r"

In this study differences in the regulation of GH secretion in males and females were analyzed by examining their sensitivity to alpha 2-adrenergic (alpha 2) stimulation and GH autofeedback. The model used in testing this system was the capacity of ovine (o) GH, injected into the third ventricle, to suppress the endogenous GH surge induced by clonidine (CLON), an alpha 2-agonist. In morning experiments, CLON (30 micrograms/kg BW, iv) was injected between 1000-1100 h in males. oGH (20 micrograms in 2 microliters vehicle) injected 3 h earlier inhibited the GH surge, which peaked 15 min after CLON injection in control animals receiving CLON alone. In females there was both no change in plasma GH levels and no difference between treatment groups in animals receiving 30, 50, 100, or 150 micrograms/kg CLON and saline controls. Preinjection of 20 micrograms oGH in proestrous or diestrous animals or 30 micrograms oGH in diestrous animals 3 h before CLON treatment did not depress plasma GH levels below those found in animals receiving CLON alone. Further, neither reducing the preinjection time to 2 h nor injecting 7, 13, or 20 micrograms oGH at this preinjection period suppressed basal or CLON-induced GH release. To facilitate comparisons in subsequent experiments the male protocol was followed. In evening experiments, CLON (injected between 2210-2240 h) stimulated a significant GH surge in diestrous females. However, preinjected oGH lowered basal GH levels but failed to suppress the CLON-induced GH surge. In somatostatin (SRIF) antiserum (anti-SRIF; 0.5 ml, iv)-treated adult diestrous animals, CLON induced a significant GH surge that was suppressed by oGH preinjection. In normal sheep serum-treated animals there was no significant response to either CLON alone or in combination with oGH. To determine the influence of ovarian hormones on GH release females were ovariectomized (OVXed) either pre- or postpubertally. After adult OVX, CLON induced an increase in GH release that was not suppressed by oGH pretreatment. In prepubertally OVXed animals CLON induced a substantial GH surge that was suppressed in animals preinjected with oGH. In prepubertally OVXed animals implanted with testosterone capsules the response to CLON and oGH was not significantly different from that after prepubertal OVX alone. Sham-operated animals responded to treatment in a manner similar to unoperated cycling females.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

On the ovarian sections, labeling was quantified after autoradiography by microphotometry. Competition studies with IGF-I and insulin allowed us to estimate the relative proportions of binding proteins and type I receptors in the different compartments of the ewe ovary. Our results clearly show that saturable, specific, and high affinity IGF-I receptors are present on the ovine granulosa cells. At equilibrium for both granulosa cell suspensions and frozen sections, the Kd value was close to 2 nM. IGF-I binding proteins were also present in follicular fluid and stroma, thecal, and granulosa cells. At equilibrium for follicular fluid, the Kd value was 0.91 +/- 0.27 nM (mean +/- SE). Moreover, on frozen sections, it was shown that atresia of small follicles (less than 2 mm) was accompanied by a decrease in the number of IGF-I receptors and an increase in the number of IGF-I-binding proteins on granulosa cells. By contrast, this phenomenon was not observed in large follicles. These data indicate that granulosa cells of ewe ovary possess type I receptors, and IGF-I-binding proteins may modulate IGF-I action in the process of follicular growth and atresia.\r"

The synthetic peptide was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and injected into rabbits. Three rabbits produced antibodies; all three are specific for progesterone receptors, recognize both native and denatured receptor, and do not interfere with either hormone binding or receptor recognition of its DNA response element in gel retardation assays. However, the antibodies do not interact with cytosolic 8S receptor complexes which contain the heat shock protein hsp90, suggesting that this site is occluded in the 8S complex. In contrast, the antibodies recognize a type of receptor dimer which forms on the DNA response element. Thus, these antibodies are a unique tool for studying receptor protein-protein interactions.\r"

  ".U": "90005203\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that norepinephrine causes a marked increase in the iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase activity in dispersed brown adipocytes. This stimulation required mRNA and protein synthesis and was 3- to 4-fold greater in cells from hypothyroid than in those from euthyroid rats. To investigate the cause of this differential response, we incubated dispersed brown adipocytes with catecholamines, a specific alpha 1-agonist, forskolin, and (Bu)2cAMP alone and in combination. Our results show a synergistic effect of alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic catecholamines to increase the deiodinase, which leads to 2-fold (euthyroid) to 4-fold (hypothyroid) higher enzyme activities in the presence of both agonists than can be accounted for by additive effects of the two agents. Since alpha 1-agonists cause minimal stimulation alone, this response is due to an enhancement of the cAMP effect. The alpha 1 effect is mimicked by the calcium ionophore A23187, but not by phorbol ester alone. After 2-h exposure to beta-adrenergic agents or forskolin, hypothyroid cells had a reduced cAMP response, but alpha 1-agonists did not reverse this. These results demonstrate a complex interrelationship between alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic agonists and thyroid status in the regulation of deiodinase in the brown adipocyte. The increase in intracellular calcium due to an alpha 1-agonist markedly enhances the effects of cAMP on deiodinase activation, permitting a beta-adrenergic effect despite the impaired cAMP generation characteristic of hypothyroid adipocytes. This unexpected enhancement of the beta-adrenergic pathway in the hypothyroid state may be especially relevant for maintaining maximum T3 production, which is required for the normal thermogenic function of this tissue.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to learn whether enriched populations of corticotropes could be grown without the other pituitary cell types. Corticotropes populations were enriched to 80-90% by counterflow centrifugation in an elutriator with the Sanderson chamber. After initial separation into small, medium, and large fractions, the cells were stimulated for 3 h with 0.5 nM corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and then re-eluted to remove the enlarged corticotropes. More ACTH (6- to 10-fold) was released in media with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) than was released in media with no serum. The effects of FBS could not be mimicked by 0.3% BSA. Corticotropes grew in serum-containing media as long as they were plated at a density of at least 2500 cells per well. The corticotropes expanded in size and assumed two major morphological subtypes. Both stored ACTH and beta-endorphin. One subtype was flattened and pleomorphic. The other subtype was stellate with multiple processes. Cell counts showed a 2.5- to 3.8-fold increase in the number of labeled corticotropes during the first 21 days of culture. Then the numbers of cells declined rapidly. Basal secretion of ACTH rose 1.6-fold during the first week, plateaued after 14 days and then declined to less than 30% of first week levels. CRH stimulation produced dose-dependent increases in media ACTH. In 7 day cultures, both basal and stimulated levels of ACTH were similar to those in 7 day cultures of mixed pituitary cells (containing equivalent numbers of corticotropes). Stimulatory effects of CRH were evident for up to 42 days of culture. Arginine vasopressin enhanced CRH-mediated secretion in most cultures in the first week. Pretreatment with glucocorticoids (100 nM corticosterone) for 15 h blocked CRH-mediated secretion in all cultures. The studies showed that corticotropes do not need the other pituitary cell types for basic plating and basal and CRH-mediated secretory responses. Further tests of specific growth factors are needed to learn whether they will maintain function for longer periods.\r"

  ".U": "90005212\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously reported that the adrenal gland is the probable origin of the digitalis-like immunoreactive material (DLI) present in the plasma of rats and other species which have never received cardiac glycoside drugs. The present study demonstrates that adrenal glands removed from rats and then chopped release an immunoreactive digitalis-like material into a serum-free minimal incubation medium. HPLC studies indicated that this immunoreactivity was not homogeneous. Since such material may be a mammalian steroidal ligand for the glycoside receptor on the sodium pump, we investigated whether release of this material could be inhibited by antagonizing the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone through the addition of aminoglutethimide (AG) to the incubation medium. Our observations indicate that this manipulation successfully inhibited pregnenolone production during both of our 2-h serial incubation periods. However, in neither incubation period was AG able to inhibit the release of DLI into the medium; rather, during the first 2-h period, the release of this material was increased in the presence of AG compared to that in controls. We attempted to determine whether DLI was of adrenocortical or medullary origin. Extracts of whole beef adrenal gland, beef cortex, whole rat adrenal gland, and whole dog adrenal gland diluted in parallel in RIA, suggesting that the assay detected the same or similar material in each tissue sample. Medullary and cortical tissue samples were dissected from slices of fresh beef adrenals and extracted for assay. These data indicated that the cortex was the primary source of endogenous digitalis-like material. Efforts to enhance release of this material from the cortex of intact rats was performed by exposing animals to ether stress. After ether stress, the plasma concentration of digitalis-like material was lower than that in controls. Finally, extracts of incubation medium from chopped adrenal glands indicate that this medium possesses the ability to inhibit the binding of radiolabeled ouabain to human erythrocytes, suggesting that adrenal glands release material that has the ability to be recognized by both antidigoxin antibodies and the ouabain-binding site of erythrocyte membrane Na+,K+-ATPase.\r"

  ".W": "The present studies demonstrate that the murine adrenocortical tumor cell line Y-1 releases a digoxin-like immunoreactive material into both serum-supplemented nutrient medium and minimal Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate medium. Release of pregnenolone into minimal medium from these cells was consistently inhibited by addition of the cholesterol side-chain cleavage inhibitor aminoglutethimide. However, release of digoxin-like immunoreactivity (DLI) was not similarly affected. To exclude the possibility that DLI could be accounted for by cross-reaction with another known adrenal steroid, aminoglutethimide inhibition was accompanied by inhibition of 17 alpha-hydroxylase with SU-10603 and inhibition of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase with cyanoketone. Once again, pregnenolone release was effectively inhibited, but no similar pattern of inhibition of DLI release was observed. Increasing the time of the incubation periods from 1 to 2 h did not change the pattern of secretion of pregnenolone or DLI. HPLC analysis of DLI released over prolonged culture periods into serum-supplemented nutrient medium showed high levels of DLI in a single major and several adjacent peaks. Analysis of the ability of extracts of Y-1-conditioned medium to compete with tritiated ouabain for binding to erythrocytes indicates that conditioned medium contained highly enriched levels of ouabain-like activity. On HPLC analysis, the distribution of this activity showed partial correlation with the distribution of DLI. These observations indicate that Y-1 cells produce and release significant quantities of a material with cardiac glycoside-like properties reflected in the cross-reactivity with antidigoxin antibodies and the ability to compete with ouabain for binding to erythrocytes. In substantiation of previous findings in chopped adrenal cultures, the cardiac glycoside-like activity does not appear to result from cholesterol side-chain cleavage or pregnenolone production, since inhibition of side-chain cleavage as well as subsequent 17 alpha-hydroxylation and 3 beta-dehydrogenation did not result in consistent inhibition of DLI release.\r"

On the ninth day of lactation, the accumulation of mRNA(PEPCK) in the liver and small intestine was 82% and 152%, respectively, compared with that in starved control rats. After 18 h of induced weaning, both tissues presented residual levels of mRNA(PEPCK). However, after 60 h of induced weaning, the accumulation of mRNA(PEPCK) increased to 60% in the liver and 76% in the small intestine compared with that in starved control rats. Adrenalectomy and bromocriptine-induced hypoprolactinemia decreased the content of this mRNA in the liver of lactating rats, while diabetes increased it. PEPCK gene transcription, determined in isolated nuclei, was 2.4-fold higher in the liver of lactating rats than in hypoprolactinemic animals, but 3.7-fold lower than that in starved animals. These results suggest that the mRNA(PEPCK) accumulation observed in the liver of lactating rats must be due to an increase in both transcription rate and messenger stabilization. PRL added to primary culture of hepatocytes obtained from lactating rats caused a dose-dependent increase in the level of mRNA(PEPCK) and mRNAc-myc. Therefore, the high PEPCK activity reported during lactation is due to increased amounts of mRNA(PEPCK), which, in turn, is due to a coordinated response at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels, where PRL seems to play an important role.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and -II) are peptide growth factors that may be important for neonatal development. Specific high affinity IGF binding proteins (BPs) have been characterized in serum and extracellular fluids. The major serum binding complex in the adult has an apparent Mr of 150 K, while the predominant BP in the neonate is approximately 30 K. In the rat, the transition from the neonatal BP to the adult form occurs during the third postnatal week, concomitant with an increase in serum IGF-I and a decrease in serum IGF-II concentrations. Using specific RIAs and Western ligand blot analyses we have characterized the changes in serum IGF and IGF BPs, respectively, during the early postnatal period. Seven BPs were identified in serum with apparent Mr values of 42, 41, 40, 38, 28, 26, and 22 K. After deglycosylation, the 42, 41, 40, and 38 K BPs were reduced to two bands with apparent Mr values of 35 and 32 K, while the 28, 26, and 22 K BP were unchanged. In the neonate, the 28, 26, and 22 K BPs were present, with the 28 K BP in highest concentration. With increasing age, the 28 K BP decreased and the 42, 41, 40, and 38 K BPs appeared at approximately 19 days of age. Comparison of Western ligand blots of neonatal serum, BRL-3A conditioned media, rat amniotic fluid, and rat cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) demonstrated that all contained a prominent 28 K BP. A polyclonal antibody (alpha Hec 1) developed against the 31 K human IGF-BP (hBP-31) immunoprecipitated the 28 K BP from neonatal rat serum, BRL-3A media, rat amniotic fluid, and rat CSF, but did not react with adult rat serum. These findings suggest that, in the rat, the predominant neonatal serum BP is structurally and immunologically similar to the major BRL-3A, amniotic fluid, and CSF BPs, but distinct from the predominant adult serum BP.\r"

  ".U": "90005220\r", 
  ".W": "A microassay for the androgen receptor was developed to investigate the cellular distribution of receptor in freshly isolated testicular cell types. The microassay uses an androgen affinity ligand, 17 beta-dihydrotestosterone bromoacetate. Binding of this ligand by the androgen receptor is rapid and irreversible, which permits the development of a highly sensitive assay. The androgen receptor microassay is completed within 4 h and detects receptor in as little as 0.5 micrograms cellular protein. There was no detectable binding of the affinity label by albumin or Sertoli cell-secreted proteins, including androgen-binding protein. Androgen receptor was found in cellular sonicates of human foreskin fibroblast, rat ventral prostate, rat kidney, and rat liver. Although the relative distribution of receptor was similar to that obtained using a traditional equilibrium binding assay, the levels of receptor were significantly higher using the microassay. The androgen receptor microassay was subsequently used to investigate the receptor in isolated testicular cell types. Androgen receptor was detected in freshly isolated peritubular myoid cells (80 fmol/micrograms DNA), Sertoli cells (88 fmol/micrograms DNA), and Leydig cells (35 fmol/micrograms DNA). No androgen receptor was detected in a mixed population of germ cells. Hormones were not found to influence androgen receptor levels in cultured peritubular cells or Sertoli cells. Electrophoretic analysis of androgen receptor radiolabeled with the affinity ligand demonstrates a single 52-kDa form of the receptor in peritubular cells, Sertoli cells, and Leydig cells. The size of the androgen receptor species detected in the rat testicular cell types was slightly smaller than the 56-kDa protein detected in a human fibroblast cell line. The current study demonstrates the utility of the microassay and affinity ligand to investigate androgen receptor biology. Data indicate that androgen receptors are present in several testicular cell types and suggest that the control of testicular function by androgens probably involves actions on multiple cell types.\r"

  ".W": "We previously isolated three forms of peptide histidine isoleucinamide (PHI) from rat small intestine by chromatography on Fractogel. Rat PHI-(1-27)-NH2 and rat PHI-(1-27)-Gly were identified by microsequence analysis. In the present work the third larger form was purified to homogeneity, being detected by RIA in preliminary steps and by RRA in the last steps. This form could be recognized by a PHI antiserum and an antiserum raised against the synthetic rat PHI-(22-27) fragment C-terminally extended by the connecting peptide linking PHI to vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) in their common PHI/VIP precursor, as postulated by the reported cDNA analysis of rat brain mRNA. Sequence analysis and C-terminal hydrolysis by carboxypeptidase-Y identified this large form as peptide histidine valine-(1-42), i.e. rat PHI-(1-27) C-terminally extended by the totality of the connecting peptide except for the terminal dibasic residues. We also documented the coexistence of the three PHI forms in rat brain, rachidian bulb, pituitary, adrenal glands, uterine horns, and stomach. Tissue distribution was highly variable. The classical PHI-(1-27)-NH2 form was best represented in rachidian bulb and somewhat less so in brain and uterine horns. PHI-(1-27)-Gly, while being particularly abundant in the small intestine, was very poorly present in rachidian bulb and uterine horns. Peptide histidine valine-(1-42) was the major form in pituitary and adrenal glands and was also well expressed in uterine horns. The three forms coexisted equally in stomach. This uneven distribution suggests a tissue-specific posttranslational processing of rat prepro-PHI/VIP.\r"

In both cell lines there was a decrease in the binding of 125I-labeled salmon calcitonin ([125I]sCT) which was dependent on the dose and time of exposure to PMA. The effect on binding comprised at least two components: the apparent affinity for binding of [125I]sCT was decreased by PMA, and the rate of internalization of bound [125I]sCT was increased more than 2-fold in the presence of PMA. By using dinitrophenol to inhibit cellular metabolic energy and, therefore, receptor internalization, the PMA effects on receptor affinity were dissociated from those on endocytosis. The effects on binding were reflected in a decreased stimulation by sCT of adenylate cyclase activity. This was specific for the calcitonin receptor system, since PMA had no effect on prostaglandin-E2-stimulated adenylate cyclase in the T47D cell. Protein kinase-C (PKC) was implicated in the inhibitory effects of PMA on both binding and adenylate cyclase activation, since inhibition was reduced by simultaneous incubation with the PKC inhibitors H7 and H8. These results suggest that PKC is capable of mediating down-regulation of the CT receptor, and this is most likely by phosphorylation of the receptor itself or an associated protein.\r"

The 5-HT1A agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), the 5-HT1C agonist, m-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP), and the 5-HT2/5-HT1C agonist, 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)2-amino-propane (DOI), all produced marked dose-dependent increases in plasma epinephrine and ACTH concentrations. Both epinephrine and ACTH responses peaked at 10 min and showed strong positive correlations across all drugs and doses studied. Corticosterone increases showed a saturable response pattern and were close to the maximum level with a relatively small (approximately 2.5-fold) increase in plasma ACTH concentrations. Norepinephrine levels showed small dose-dependent increases after 8-OH-DPAT and m-CPP and decreases after DOI treatment. These results suggest that both the sympathoadrenomedullary system and the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis can be activated via 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptors and that these two systems may have common or similar regulatory mechanisms triggered by these stimuli.\r"

  ".U": "90005229\r", 
  ".W": "16 alpha-Hydroxyestrone (16OHE1), an endogenous metabolite of estradiol (E2), binds to the estrogen receptor (ER) with low affinity, but is estrogenic in various bioassay systems. 16OHE1 binds covalently to the ER in vitro, exhibits prolonged estrogenic bioactivity in vivo, and has been implicated in several estrogen-dependent diseases. This study examined the effects of 13 days of continuous infusion of E2 or 16OHE1 on lordotic behavior, pituitary growth, and ER regulation in the cytosolic and nuclear fractions of the pituitary and preoptic area of both sexes. Finally, simultaneous pituitary nuclear exchange assays and enzyme immunoassays were performed to search for covalent 16OHE1-ER complexes in vivo. E2 induced lordosis and pituitary growth in both sexes, while 16OHE1 was only slightly less effective. While E2 treatment increased nuclear ER concentrations 2-fold vs. control values, it decreased both cytosolic and total (cytosolic plus nuclear) ER concentrations in pituitary and preoptic area by approximately 3-fold vs. control values in both sexes by exchange assay. In contrast, 16OHE1 did not decrease total pituitary ER concentrations and only minimally decreased total preoptic ER concentrations. Simultaneous exchange assay and immunoassay of pituitary nuclear extracts demonstrated proportionate increases in ER levels in female vs. male and in E2-treated vs. 16OHE1-treated rats. The ratios of (ER enzyme immunoassay divided by ER-exchange) for each rat were similar regardless of metabolite administration. The correlation of individual measurements implied that ER localized to the nuclear fraction by either E2 or 16OHE1 retained both exchangeability and immunoassayability to similar extents, but did not support the presence of 16OHE1-ER covalent complexes. The results of this study suggest that 16OHE1 has significant estrogenic bioactivity, as manifest by its effects on lordosis and pituitary growth, but, in contrast to E2, does not decrease pituitary ER concentrations and only minimally decreases preoptic ER concentrations. This property may be important in the proposed pathogenetic action of 16OHE1 in estrogen-dependent disease.\r"

  ".W": "We have established and characterized two cell lines from the ventral prostate gland of normal Nb rats: NbE-1 (prostatic epithelial) and NbF-1 (prostatic fibroblast) cell lines. To identify the direct mitogenic action of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), we incubated these cell lines alone and together (in the presence and absence of cell contact) with various concentrations of DHT (0.1-10,000 ng/ml) for 24-72 h and assayed for the rate of DNA synthesis and the total number of cells in tissue culture at specified time periods. Results demonstrate that the primary target for DHT mitogenic action is the prostatic fibroblasts. DHT inhibited the growth of prostatic epithelial cells by themselves, but stimulated prostatic epithelial cell growth when the epithelial cells were cocultured with prostatic fibroblasts. Furthermore, the cell-conditioned medium obtained from either the fibroblast or the epithelial cells stimulated in an autocrine or a paracrine manner the growth of prostatic cells in culture. These results are consistent with the concept that DHT stimulates the growth of prostatic epithelial cells indirectly via its direct mitogenic action on the prostatic fibroblasts. Because epithelial cells are the cell type principally responsible for converting testosterone to DHT, and the fibroblasts respond to the mitogenic action of DHT, our results support the concept that tight metabolic cooperation exists between prostatic epithelial and fibroblast cells. These data are in agreement with previous in vivo studies in which we have demonstrated that androgen receptors in the mesenchyme are obligatory for androgen-induced prostate growth and development.\r"

  ".U": "90005233\r", 
  ".W": "The inactivation of the phenolic ring deiodinases by natural substrates and iodinated contrast agents such as iopanoic acid (IOP) is a principal mechanism regulating the peripheral metabolism of thyroid hormones. The present studies were designed to investigate the cellular and biochemical mechanisms mediating this effect on type I 5'-deiodinase (5'DI) in rat liver and kidney. We reasoned that if inactivation requires the direct interaction of ligand (e.g. IOP) with 5'DI, then this effect should be blocked by a prior injection of 6n-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU), which binds to an essential sulfhydryl group at the enzyme's active site and inhibits catalytic cycling. Experiments were performed using liver and kidney microsomes prepared from male rats injected 2.5 or 6 h earlier with various combinations of PTU, IOP, and/or vehicle. In initial studies, conditions were defined whereby active 5'DI could be regenerated in vitro from PTU-injected animals. This involved the treatment of microsomes with 50 mM dithiothreitol, pH 7.0, before assay. After this reductive treatment, 5'DI activity in both liver and kidney microsomes from rats previously injected with PTU, or the combination of PTU followed 30 min later by IOP, was equivalent to that in vehicle-injected control animals, whereas activity was decreased 60% in microsomes from animals injected with only IOP. This demonstrates that PTU protects 5'DI against ligand-induced inactivation, suggesting that this process is initiated by substrate binding to the enzyme's active site. In other experiments, liver microsomes from IOP-injected animals were pretreated with 100 mM dithiothreitol, pH 9.0, then washed, and 5'DI activity was determined. Under these stringent reducing conditions, 5'DI activity was completely recovered in microsomes from rats injected with IOP 2.5 h earlier, but only partially recovered 6 h after the IOP injection. Thus, ligand-induced inactivation of 5'DI may involve initially a reversible oxidation of the enzyme, followed by its irreversible inactivation.\r"

  ".W": "Adenosine inhibits TSH-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA in FRTL5 thyroid follicular cells by both inhibiting cAMP generation and acting at a locus beyond adenylate cyclase. On the other hand, adenosine markedly potentiates DNA synthesis in FRTL5 stimulated by insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). The mechanisms of this latter effect are unknown, but require the coincubation of adenosine and IGF-I and not mediated by an increase in intracellular cAMP concentration. Adenosine increases the maximal response of FRTL5 to [3H]thymidine incorporation stimulated by IGF-I and increases the sensitivity of FRTL5 to IGF-I. These effects of adenosine are reflected by an increase in nuclear labeling as well as by an increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. Adenosine also plays a role as an autocrine growth factor in FRTL5, since adenosine deaminase increases the response of these cells to TSH. The effects of adenosine on both TSH- and IGF-I-stimulated DNA synthesis are shared by guanosine and inosine, although with different potencies for the various guanine nucleosides. Inosine potentiates IGF-I-stimulated DNA synthesis, but inhibits TSH-stimulated DNA synthesis only weakly. Adenosine interacts with multiple receptors and with multiple postreceptor pathways in FRTL5 to produce divergent effects on the control of cell replication by two growth factors (TSH and IGF-I) that act through different postreceptor pathways.\r"

Our previous data suggest that this increase was due to the estradiol-stimulated influx of circulating eosinophils. Therefore, we suggested that the uterine nuclear type II estrogen-binding sites were not of uterine origin. In this report we present further evidence to support this hypothesis. Treatment of immature rats with estradiol resulted in the stimulation of several uterine parameters, namely wet weight, protein synthesis, eosinophil number, peroxidase activity, nuclear type II binding sites, and the synthesis and secretion of a 180-kDa protein. The coadministration of pertussigen had no effect on the estradiol-stimulated increase in wet weight, protein synthesis, or the synthesis and secretion of the 180-kDa protein. However, pertussigen did prevent the estradiol-stimulated increase in eosinophils, peroxidase activity, and nuclear type II binding sites, demonstrating a coordinated response. Since peroxidase activity is known to be contained int he eosinophil, these data are consistent with our earlier demonstration that the type II sites are of eosinophil origin. These data also support and extend our previous findings in neonatal animals that estradiol can stimulate a growth response without a corresponding increase in the nuclear type II binding sites. These results further indicate that the estradiol-stimulated increase in eosinophils does not appear to play a key role in the control of uterine growth.\r"

Mean blood calcium levels fell significantly in both groups of animals 3 h after the first IL-1 injections and returned to pretreatment values at 5 h. However, at 24 and 48 h mean values were significantly higher than those in saline-heated controls. Despite this progressive underlying increase in mean blood ionized calcium concentrations, blood calcium concentrations also fell significantly 3 h after the second and third IL-1 injections. The transient decrease in blood calcium was prevented by treatment with indomethacin and, thus, appears to be prostaglandin mediated. Hypocalcemia was not observed after single bolus injections of tumor necrosis factor-alpha or -beta (lymphotoxin). These findings suggest that IL-1 is a potential mediator of the hypocalcemia that occurs in up to 40% of patients with bacteremic sepsis and severe tissue injury and is associated with an increased mortality rate.\r"

Genomic DNA from several progenitor strains of recombinant inbred (RI) strains of mice was tested with various restriction endonucleases for restriction fragment length variations. Variation in Bam HI fragment length was detected between A/J and C57BL/6J. Genomic DNA from 43 RI strains derived from A/J and C57BL/6J was analyzed in a similar manner. Complete concordance of the strain distribution pattern for P450SCC and that of P450arom was observed for 43 RI strains. The lack of recombination indicates that the structural genes encoding P450SCC and P450arom are closely linked. The strain distribution patterns of the P450SCC and P450arom genes were compared with other markers previously mapped in these RI lines. The results demonstrate that both P450SCC and P450arom are found on mouse chromosome 9. Of the other loci on mouse chromosome 9, P450SCC and P450arom are most closely linked to the gene encoding P1450. Among 31 RI strains for which the three loci were analyzed, only one example of discordance was found. Human P450SCC, P450arom and P1450 have been mapped to human chromosome 15. However, the distance between the human P450SCC gene and other loci has not been determined. The information presented in this report, along with other studies, indicate conservation between homologous human and mouse chromosomal regions and suggest that human P450SCC will be found to be closely linked with human P450arom.\r"

The degree of weight loss during 36 hours of starvation was reduced (p less than 0.01) by frequent treatment with subcutaneous IGF-1 but not by bGH therapy. The effect was restricted to the period 28 to 36 hours after commencement of the fast. These results suggest that a fall in circulating IGF-1 may play a role in the metabolic adaptation during malnutrition.\r"

A recent review of pseudoseizure manifestations concluded that alternating limb movements were \"highly characteristic of pseudoseizures.\" We report two adult patients with complex partial seizures of temporal lobe origin, confirmed by ictal video EEG recording, in whom bicycling movements were the prominent ictal manifestation. Bicycling occurred 5-30 s after ictal onset and lasted 15-30 s. Use of video EEG recording continues to increase our understanding of the wide range of behaviors which may occur in the course of an epileptic seizure, particularly complex partial seizures. Few absolute clinical criteria remain to distinguish epileptic seizures from pseudoseizures. These two cases and one other reported case clearly remove bicycling movements from that category.\r"

Six patients had white matter MRI lesions of nonspecific significance. The temporomesial MRI lesions were compatible with sclerosis of Ammonis cornu.

Factors closely related by multivariate analysis to relapse were neurologic abnormalities, mental retardation, seizure type (infantile spasms, absence seizures), and appearance or persistence of EEG abnormalities during the course of the illness and before discontinuation. When multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate outcome of patients with a first relapse (isolated vs. multiple relapses), the variables closely related to a poor prognosis were etiologic factors, first relapse characterized by more than one seizure in a 24-h period, seizure-free period less than 4 years, unchanged seizure type at first relapse, more than one AED for seizure control, and abnormal EEG before the first relapse. In itself, resumption of therapy did not influence outcome. At the study cutoff point, 88% of patients with relapse were again seizure-free. We conclude that AEDs can safely be discontinued if predictive factors are considered to individualize the risk of relapse for each patient.\r"

Serum ferritin levels were found to be elevated with normal serum iron and total iron-binding capacity in 9 of the 18 patients studied. Because excess iron, typified by hemochromatosis, is associated with diabetes, and diabetes has been shown to improve after lowering total-body iron load through repeat venesection, I investigated whether regulating elevated ferritin levels could facilitate diabetes control. Deferoxamine (DFO), a known specific chelator of iron, was used because of its capacity to correct excess iron stores. All 9 patients in the high-ferritin diabetic group and 7 of 9 diabetic control subjects with normal serum ferritin levels were given DFO (10 mg/kg i.v.) twice weekly. Diabetic control, fasting glucose, triglyceride, cholesterol, HbA1c, and serum ferritin levels were monitored. Data show that lowering elevated ferritin levels correlated well with diabetes control and improved fasting glucose, triglyceride, and HbA1c in 8 of 9 patients with high ferritin levels. Lowering normal ferritin levels had no effect on diabetes control or on any of the other parameters in the 7 control subjects. This study shows there is a need to study iron metabolism in poorly controlled diabetes and demonstrates the value of DFO in controlling high-ferritin diabetes.\r"

Because photocoagulation can reduce the incidence of blindness from severe DR by approximately 50%, it is important to identify people at increased risk for DR so that appropriate treatment can be accomplished. Use of populations at increased risk for diabetes may identify groups at increased risk for complications. A recent report from the San Antonio Heart Study showed that Mexican Americans were at greater risk for servere DR than non-Hispanic Whites. To compare the prevalence of DR between non-Hispanics and Hispanics in southern Colorado, 279 people with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) were identified, and retinal photographs identified the presence and severity of retinopathy. The worse eye was used to classify the severity of DR for each patient. Ninety percent of the subjects (166 Hispanics and 85 non-Hispanic Whites) were classified by retinopathy level. The duration-adjusted prevalence of any DR was 41.8% in Hispanics and 54.1% in non-Hispanic Whites. Severe DR (preproliferative and proliferative) occurred in 18.5% of the Hispanics and in 21.3% of the non-Hispanic Whites. The odds ratio for any DR, comparing Hispanics with non-Hispanic Whites adjusted for other risk factors, was 0.40 (95% confidence interval = 0.21, 0.76). Other risk factors for the presence of any retinopathy included use of exogenous insulin, increased duration of diabetes, younger age at diagnosis, increased glycosylated hemoglobin level, and increased systolic blood pressure. These data suggest that, compared with non-Hispanic Whites, Hispanics in Colorado may be at decreased risk for diabetic retinopathy.\r"

  ".W": "Despite the commonly held view that abnormalities in capillary morphology, in particular thickening of the capillary basement membrane, are partly responsible for diabetic ischemia, few studies have correlated anatomic and hemodynamic variables in the same diabetic subjects. In a previous study of 24 type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetic subjects and 24 age-matched control subjects, we showed that a standard finger exercise vasodilated cutaneous forearm vessels nearly equally (51%), but the postarteriolar flow responded differently between groups. Nondiabetic subjects increased flow by recruitment of capillaries, whereas diabetic subjects did so by capillary flow augmentation. Moreover, resting permeability-surface area product (PS) to pentetic acid was 85% higher in diabetic than nondiabetic subjects. In this study, these same subjects had their forearm skin biopsied and examined morphometrically by electron microscopy for capillary radius, basement membrane thickness, endothelial cell density, and a folding index of luminal membrane reduplication. All morphological variables were correlated stepwise in a saturated, analysis of covariance model with the physiological results. The correlations were sparse and specifically excluded basement membrane thickness. The highest r2 value was .432 between resting PS and a ratio of capillary density to endothelial cell number per capillary. These studies show little evidence that diabetic microvascular physiological variables are tightly connected to morphometric changes except for minor permeability changes, which rise with capillary density and decrease with endothelial cell number. Because PS to pentetic acid is increased in diabetic subjects at any level of capillary density, it seems reasonable that permeability may be increased above that of nondiabetic subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Based on the recent demonstration of elevated serum proinsulin levels in cystic fibrosis patients with impaired glucose tolerance, it was hypothesized that proinsulin could be an indicator of altered beta-cell function. We therefore analyzed fasting proinsulin levels in 99 siblings of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients, most of them discordant for diabetes for greater than 6 yr. The results from this group were compared with the results from 41 healthy age- and sex-matched control subjects with no family history of diabetes. Median (range) fasting proinsulin in siblings was 8.9 pM (1.7-58 pM) vs. 3.8 pM (less than 1.2-28 pM) in control subjects (P less than .00001). There was no difference between the groups in fasting blood glucose concentrations. Both groups had fasting insulin concentrations within the normal range with a tendency toward lower values in the siblings: 108 pM (60-237 pM) vs. 118 pM (71-175 pM) (P = .07). The 99 siblings were subdivided into groups according to HLA sharing with their diabetic proband. The concentration of proinsulin, insulin, and blood glucose among the groups of 33 HLA-identical, 40 HLA-haploidentical, and 26 nonidentical siblings did not differ significantly. The fasting proinsulin level did not correlate with fasting levels of insulin, blood glucose, age, or body weight. We conclude that fasting proinsulin is elevated in healthy siblings of IDDM patients, whereas fasting insulin is normal or slightly decreased independent of HLA identity with their diabetic sibling. Elevated proinsulin levels could represent a family trait, perhaps mirroring a beta-cell more vulnerable to destruction, or it could reflect previous beta-cell damage that does not lead to IDDM.\r"

  ".W": "Diabetic rat pregnancies are characterized by altered maternal and fetal Zn metabolism and a higher frequency of fetal malformations. In this study, the effect of varying maternal dietary Zn on pregnancy and fetal outcome and on maternal and fetal trace element status were investigated. Starting on day 0 of gestation, streptozocin-induced diabetic and nondiabetic control rats were fed a low-Zn diet (4.5 micrograms/g diet), an adequate-Zn diet (24.5 micrograms/g diet), or a high-Zn diet (500 micrograms/g diet) throughout gestation. Fetuses were taken by cesarean section on gestation day 20. Fetuses from diabetic dams were smaller, weighed less, and had less calcified skeletons and more malformations than fetuses from control dams. In the controls, maternal dietary Zn had a minor effect on fetal malformation frequency. In contrast, in the diabetic animals, the low-Zn diet had a strong teratogenic effect. In diabetic dams, the adequate- and high-Zn diets improved fetal length and weight more than it did in fetuses from nondiabetic dams. However, supplemental dietary Zn during diabetic pregnancy did not further improve malformation frequencies. Liver and kidney Zn, Cu, and metallothionein concentrations were higher in diabetic dams than in control dams. In contrast, liver Zn, Cu, and metallothionein concentrations in fetuses of diabetic dams were lower than in fetuses from control dams, regardless of maternal dietary Zn intake. These results show that diabetes during pregnancy can amplify the teratogenic effects of a mild maternal Zn deficiency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These mice develop insulinopenia and hyperglycemia secondary to beta-cell destruction, which is associated with insulitis and autoantibody production. We have two strains of NOD mice: a low-incidence strain (NOD/Wehi), in which less than 10% females and less than 1% males develop diabetes by 150 days despite intense insulitis, and a high-incidence strain (NOD/Lt), in which most females and many males develop diabetes by 150 days. This phenotypic difference has been maintained for 24 mo despite identical housing in our specific pathogen-free unit. Reciprocal skin grafting and allozyme electrophoresis have not identified a difference between the strains. Mixed-lymphocyte cultures were performed with splenic T-lymphocytes cultured with equal numbers of irradiated stimulator splenocytes for 3-6 days. NOD/Wehi mice demonstrated a heightened syngeneic mixed-lymphocyte response (SMLR), averaging 19% of the allogeneic response to CBA/CaHWehi cells. The response to NOD/Lt stimulator cells was not significantly different from the syngeneic response. In contrast, NOD/Lt mice had an SMLR similar to that of BALB/cAnBradleyWehi control mice, averaging 5% of the allogeneic response. NOD/Lt cells also responded similarly to NOD/Wehi stimulator cells and briskly to allogeneic cells. The heightened SMLR in NOD/Wehi mice may reflect active generation of suppressor function, and this may account for the low incidence of diabetes.\r"

This paper describes the use of the diagnosis cluster method to study the three-year experience of a class of family practice residents in one university program and three community hospital programs. A group of 10 additional clusters based on the criteria of frequency, clinical homogeneity, and educational importance were identified covering 14.3% of the diagnoses not falling within the established 52-cluster method. These residency-specific clusters require review and validation by further analysis of clinical data and peer review by faculty involved in residency education.\r"

The study found that major concerns of new faculty members appeared to be: 1) acting as a role model; 2) developing teaching skills; and 3) maintaining clinical competency. New faculty were more likely to emphasize issues dealing with resident-faculty relationships if they came directly out of training programs than if they came out of practice settings. The study also demonstrated that the majority of family medicine faculty no longer came from private practice, and that a significant number now come directly from training programs.\r"

Internal medicine was the most frequently chosen specialty when another was preferred. The frequency with which family practice was the career choice was affected little by differences between preferences and choices. Six factors were identified, with the curriculum as the major factor separating those who chose family practice from those who chose other primary care or non-primary care specialties. Based on these results, six suggestions are offered for medical school administrators and faculty desiring to increase the number of students selecting family practice.\r"

To compare the family medicine modified essay question format with the multiple choice question format used in the other five required junior clerkships, examination scores from 2,174 Jefferson graduates (1976-1985) were correlated with scores on the examinations of the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME), ratings of clinical performance in the required third-year clerkships, and ratings on four global areas of postgraduate competence. Grades on the multiple choice examination in internal medicine consistently yielded the highest correlations with NBME scores and with postgraduate ratings of medical knowledge. Performance on the modified essay examination in family medicine had the lowest correlations in these areas. The family medicine scores, however, consistently yielded the highest correlations with overall third-year clinical performance and with postgraduate performance in the areas of data-gathering skills, clinical judgment, and professional attitudes. These results indicate that the modified essay question format may provide a different and important parameter in the evaluation of medical trainees.\r"

A network of physician recruiters oriented to the study was organized for each district. This recruitment method resulted in an 84.5% participation rate. The relationship of these physician recruiters to the candidate and the method of approach were important factors in the enrolment process: the highest participation rate (95%) was obtained when the recruiters were friends of the candidate and when a personal meeting was arranged (91%). Recruiters were given an information package to help them in the recruitment process and rated the most useful items as follows: a policy statement about confidentiality, a description of the study and reprints of a published feasibility study. These results illustrate that cooperation in research in family physicians' offices can become a reality.\r"

Of the 3350 general practitioners surveyed 1116 responded. One third expressed a high degree of interest in general practice research. Previous research experience and barriers to general practice research were also studied. The areas in which the doctors felt most research was required were identified. The results are compared with another study of Canadian family physicians, which is the only study of a similar nature previously published.

This paper describes methodological problems and related issues associated with a deficient outcome audit undertaken on five stillbirths which occurred in a rural family medical practice in Israel between 1985 and 1987. Problems included initial official disinterest towards the audit, and the high levels of suspicion and antagonism which it aroused in hospital staff approached for information. The problematic aspect of such audits needs more attention. The importance of this type of audit for establishing the precise reasons for perinatal deaths, and thus for maintaining antenatal care standards is discussed. In view of the small numbers of such events likely to occur within any one family practice it is not only feasible but also desirable for more family doctors to carry out such audits routinely, despite the difficulties which are involved.\r"

It was hypothesized, also, that an individual's personal coping style (according to the degree of repression or sensitization to illness) would be indirectly related to visits in a similar manner. The hypotheses were supported for persons suffering from long-term illnesses. Among the people who did not have long-term illnesses, personal coping style as measured on the repression-sensitization scale was related to the number of symptoms reported and the pattern of response to common symptoms but neither of these were related to frequency of visits.\r"

A deliberate attempt to maximize the expectation effect was thus shown to influence the clinical course of acute tonsillitis, recorded as the degree of subjective improvement.\r"

This paper reviews the evidence that such beliefs are important and reports a preliminary study examining differences in the beliefs of doctors as a function of their experience and chosen specialty. Thirty four general practitioner teachers responded to a questionnaire measuring beliefs about diabetes and its management. The results were compared with those of a previous study among hospital doctors with an interest in diabetes. In comparison with hospital doctors, general practitioner teachers had a more pessimistic outlook on diabetes, perceiving that the disease carried more risks and having less confidence that achieving goals of treatment would reduce these risks. In accord with these beliefs their approach to treatment was less rigorous than that of hospital-based doctors. These results have implications for shared care; such differences between groups of doctors are likely to be a barrier to the effective sharing of patient care. The results also add further strength to the view that doctors' beliefs about a disease and its management need to be considered alongside those of the patient to explain more of the variance in patient health outcomes.\r"

Although general practitioners appear to be in an excellent position to offer preventive care, there is evidence that they currently do not detect or intervene for common risk behaviours. One reason for this may be the general practitioner's perception that patients do not expect such preventive activities to be a part of the doctor's role. A postal survey of 309 people randomly selected from the community was undertaken to examine perceptions about the general practitioner's role in detection and intervention for smoking, alcohol abuse, emotional problems and hypertension. Responses to the survey from 264 usable questionnaires indicated that people in the community accepted the general practitioner's role in preventive care, with most respondents indicating that they would appreciate being asked about the risks examined, would like the offer of intervention and would try treatments in these areas offered by the doctor. Few respondents indicated that they would change doctors as a result of preventive activity.\r"

  ".W": "Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a candidate as an inhibitory neurotransmitter mediating relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) because VIP antiserum reduces LES relaxation in response to neural stimulation. Vasoactive intestinal peptide antiserum, however, does not completely block LES relaxation. Thus it is possible that other neurotransmitters may be involved. Peptide histidine isoleucine has structural homologies with VIP, is synthesized with VIP from a common precursor protein, coexists in some nerve cells, and is coproduced with VIP in some tumors. In numerous organ systems VIP and peptide histidine isoleucine (PHI) produce similar effects, with PHI being less potent than VIP by approximately one log number. In the LES both VIP and PHI produce tetrodotoxin-resistant dose-dependent relaxation, with PHI being almost equipotent with VIP. We therefore tested the hypothesis that PHI may be a second neurotransmitter, partly responsible for relaxation of the cat LES, by using a highly specific rabbit PHI antiserum that exhibits minimal cross-binding with VIP, secretin, and glucagon. In 3 animals, LES and brain tissue were extracted in 0.1 N HCl and assayed with a PHI radioimmunoassay. The antiserum cross-reacted with cat brain and LES showing PHI concentrations greater than 100 ng/g, with the LES containing equal or greater concentrations of PHI than brain tissue. In other animals consecutive LES circular muscle strips were cut, mounted in 1-ml muscle chambers, and stimulated with 6-s square-wave trains of 0.1-, 0.2-, 0.4-, and 0.8-ms pulses at 1, 2, and 5 Hz. These parameters produced relaxation that was completely blocked by tetrodotoxin, and reduced by VIP antiserum, but not affected by adrenergic or cholinergic receptor antagonists. Some strips were incubated in 5% or 10% PHI antiserum, whereas others were incubated in the same concentration of preimmunization serum from the same animal. Incubation in normal serum did not significantly affect relaxation, whereas in the antiserum-treated strips, LES relaxation was reduced by a significant amount (20%-30%) at all parameters of stimulation tested. Incubation in antiserum however had no effect on relaxation induced by VIP (10(-8)-10(-6) M). These data suggest that PHI may play a role in LES relaxation induced by electrical stimulation.\r"

Short-chain fatty acid concentrations were determined together with production rates in 6- and 24-h incubations of intestinal outputs from 56 patients with various types of intestinal resections. Concentrations and 6- and 24-h production rates in feces from 9 healthy persons (controls; median +/- SD) were 98.9 +/- 21.4 mmol/L and 17.2 +/- 5.1 and 9.3 +/- 1.5 mmol/L.h, respectively. Colectomized patients with short bowel syndrome had extremely low concentrations (0.8 mmol/L) compared with controls (p less than 10-5), patients with ileostomy (p = 0.003), and ileal reservoirs (p less than 10-5), and showed low 6- and 24-h production rates (1.5 and 0.9 mmol/L.h, respectively; p less than 10-5 vs. controls). Short-chain fatty acids in ileostomic digesta (11.1 mmol/L) were decreased (p = 0.011) compared with outputs from ileal reservoirs (51.5 mmol/L), although production rates were in the same order of magnitude--all below control values (p less than 0.001). Patients partially colectomized and patients with small bowel bypass or short bowel syndrome with preserved colon had normal fecal concentrations with decreased production rates of short-chain fatty acids vs. controls (p less than 0.01). Only minor changes in ratios between individual acids were found. Reciprocal values of short-chain fatty acid concentrations correlated to volumes of outputs from both small intestine (r = 0.86, p less than 10-6) and colon (r = 0.79, p less than 10-6) when results were cumulated. It is concluded that partial resections of colon and the small bowel do not influence the fecal concentration level of short-chain fatty acids as long as colon is not totally resected.\r"

Six dogs were equipped with strain-gauge transducers and were exposed from 1-3 h after the meal to prerecorded music (80-90 dB broad frequency noise), which produced a significant (p less than or equal to 0.05) lengthening of the gastric (31.2%) and jejunal (37.0%) postprandial pattern. In 4 other dogs with gastric cannula, a 2-h session of acoustic stress beginning just after eating a radiolabeled standard meal induced a slowing of gastric emptying of both liquid (45.7%) and solid (47.1%) phases of the test meal when measured 0.5 h after feeding. In contrast, when measured 2 h after feeding, similar values of gastric emptying of liquids and solids were observed in stressed and control animals. Compared with controls, the postprandial increases of plasma gastrin and pancreatic polypeptide levels were significantly enhanced in stressed animals and occurred early (15 min after the meal). Although postprandial decrease in plasma motilin was unchanged by acoustic stress, the rise in plasma somatostatin level was significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05) prolonged in stressed dogs. These results indicate that acoustic stress affects gastric and intestinal postprandial motility in dogs, delaying the recovery of the migrating motor complex pattern, inducing a transient slowing of gastric emptying, and enhancing the feeding-induced release of gastrin, pancreatic polypeptide, and somatostatin. Such hormonal changes might be due to a direct effect of stress rather than being the consequence of acoustic stress-induced slowing of gastric emptying.\r"

There was no significant difference in corpus mucosal blood flow between portal vein-ligated and sham-operated animals at 7- and 28-day periods, although the level of perfusion was higher in the 28-day portal vein-ligated group. There was no significant difference in antral mucosal or muscle blood flow between portal hypertensive and control animals at any of the study periods. We conclude that the acute period after portal vein ligation is associated with a reduced corpus mucosal microcirculation but that this effect is not sustained in portal hypertensive animals studied at later intervals after portal vein ligation.\r"

However, there were no cases of necrosis in 33 control sham ligations performed in the same animals (p less than 0.001). In another group, ligation of two or three adjacent mucosal arteries resulted in necrosis in 10 of 11 cases (p less than 0.0001), against 0 necrosis in 11 sham ligations. Killing the animals at varying intervals showed that after 1 day the mucosa was necrotic, after 2 days it was shed, and later it might perforate. We conclude that many mucosal arteries in the guinea pig may behave as functional end-arteries. How these findings may pertain to ulceration is discussed in relation to (a) the existence of atypical mucosal arteries found in the ulcer-bearing areas in humans and (b) the role of the muscularis mucosae on arterioles perforating it in both humans and other species.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of surgical interruption of the myenteric plexus (myectomy), extrinsic denervation of a length of small intestine, or transection and reanastomosis of the intestinal wall on migration of phase III of the migrating myoelectric complex was studied in guinea pigs. In addition, the recovery of phase III migration and the regrowth of intestinal nerves and muscle across the reanastomosis was studied at various times up to 60 days after surgery. At 6-9 days after surgery, phase III did not migrate past the myectomy during 50%-60% of recorded migrating myoelectric complexes and transection and reanastomosis of the intestinal wall blocked aboral progression of phase III in 90% of cases. Extrinsic denervation did not alter phase III migration through the denervated segment. Phase III migration past the reanastomosis recovered with time after surgery; 80% recovery occurred by 60 days after surgery. Immunoreactivities for vasoactive intestinal peptide, gastrin-releasing peptide, and somatostatin were used as markers for intestinal nerves that were cut by transaction. Immunoreactivities for vasoactive intestinal peptide and gastrin-releasing peptide are contained in myenteric neurons that project in an oral to anal direction to other myenteric ganglia and to the circular muscle. Immunoreactivity for somatostatin is contained in nerve fibers projecting aborally to other myenteric ganglia. At 7-15 days after surgery, there were accumulations of immunoreactivities for vasoactive intestinal peptide, gastrin-releasing peptide, and somatostatin in nerve fibers on the oral side of the reanastomosis, but nerve fibers containing these peptides were not observed in myenteric ganglia or circular muscle close to the anal edge. At 23-28 days, immunoreactivities for vasoactive intestinal peptide, gastrin-releasing peptide, and somatostatin nerve fibers were traced across the reanastomosis and nerve terminals were detected in ganglia and muscle close to the lesion on the anal side. Nerve fibers traversed the lesion in all cases at 57-60 days and vasoactive intestinal peptide-, gastrin-releasing peptide-, and somatostatin-immunoreactive nerve terminals were detected in the first two to three rows of myenteric ganglia on the anal side. Regrowth of intestinal muscle followed a similar time-course to that observed for nerves. These data suggest that interruption of the myenteric plexus alone does not completely block phase III migration. In addition, recovery of phase III migration past a reanastomosis is associated with a restoration of both nervous and mechanical connections.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the mechanism by which exposure to cold sensitizes rats to the formation of gastric lesions after a low dose of aspirin (50 mg/kg). Six times more lesions were produced by aspirin plus cold than by aspirin alone. Three hypotheses were studied to explain the synergism of aspirin plus cold on lesion formation: gastric acid hypersecretion, reduced gastric mucosal blood flow, and decreased prostanoid synthesis by the stomach. Cold, and cold plus aspirin, stimulated gastric acid secretion (to a similar extent), whereas aspirin had no effect. Gastric mucosal blood flow, measured by the hydrogen gas clearance method, was decreased by cold, aspirin, and aspirin plus cold, and the extent of decrease was similar. Prostanoid generation [prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), PGF2 alpha, 6-keto PGF1 alpha, and thromboxane B2] by the gastric corpus mucosa was not affected by cold, but was reduced equally (by at least 90%) in animals receiving aspirin alone or aspirin plus cold. After oral administration of aspirin, the plasma contained mostly salicylic acid (98%), whereas the gastric mucosa contained mostly aspirin (80%-85%). We conclude that the synergism of aspirin plus cold on the formation of gastric lesions probably results from the combined effects of three factors: increased secretion of acid (because of exposure to cold) that is in contact with a gastric mucosa in which blood flow is reduced (because of exposure to cold or to aspirin), and in which the synthesis of cytoprotective prostaglandins is inhibited (by aspirin). Such mucosa may be particularly vulnerable to the damaging effect of hyperacidity.\r"

In previous studies we and others have identified and characterized glycine-extended forms of gastrin (Ggly) and CCK (CCK-gly) in the human gastrointestinal tract. To explore the potential biologic importance of these peptides in humans, we examined their release into the circulation. Ingestion of a standard meal induced a biphasic rise in plasma G/CCK-gly concentration, but only the initial increase correlated with gastrin release. Intraduodenal lipid infusion caused a selective rise in CCK-gly immunoreactivity with no increase in gastrin or G-gly. Gel filtration chromatography revealed that the predominant molecular form of G/CCK-gly in basal plasma coeluted with CCK8-gly, but in response to meal stimulation, increases in other molecular forms were noted. Measurement of glycine-extended intermediates of progastrin and procholecystokinin posttranslational processing in plasma may aid in determining their physiologic importance in health and disease.\r"

  ".W": "Abnormal permeability to polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) has been demonstrated in various disorders with defective intestinal barrier functions. To understand the basic mechanisms of PEG 400 permeability, we compared PEG 400 permeation in different segments of the intestine and studied the kinetics and influence of intraluminal factors on PEG 400 absorption in vivo in perfused intestinal segments of the rat. The permeation rate of PEG 400 was dependent on the luminal concentration (y = 12.99x + 3.5; r = 0.97), indicating that passive movement is the mechanism involved in PEG 400 absorption. Changing the perfusate pH from 6 to 7.4 or modifying the unstirred water layer resistance by changing luminal flow rate did not affect PEG 400 absorption. When luminal osmolarity was varied from 0.225 to 0.6 osmol/L, higher osmolarity decreased both water and PEG 400 absorption (p greater than 0.01). The relationship between PEG 400 and water absorption at different osmolarities was linear (y = 0.9x + 5.7; r = 0.98). At a luminal osmolarity of 0.3 osmol/L 43% of PEG 400 permeation was mediated by passive diffusion and 57% was mediated by solvent drag. Increasing water absorption by decreasing luminal osmolarity resulted in proportional increase of PEG 400 permeation through solvent drag or convection. The solvent drag reflection coefficient (sigma f) for PEG 400 permeation of the jejunum was 0.1. Taurocholic acid (10 mM) alone or with oleic acid (2.5 mM) did not affect PEG 400 absorption. Permeabilities of 1 mM PEG 400 and water were similar in jejunum and ileum but were markedly increased in the colon (p greater than 0.01). These studies demonstrate that PEG 400 is absorbed by both passive diffusion and by solvent drag, with the latter accounting for a greater fraction of the absorptive drive under normal conditions. Polyethylene glycol 400 uses aqueous pathways for its permeation across the intestinal epithelium.\r"

Using a manometric catheter with a balloon of reproducible dimension, balloon distention produced a sustained pressure proximal to the distended esophageal balloon in 28 of 30 (93%) patients and 9 of 10 (90%) normal volunteers. Patients with dysphagia had the reproduction of their characteristic symptom during balloon distention in 23 of 30 (76%) cases. Atypical symptoms not characteristic of the patients' usual dysphagia developed in the other 4 patients with dysphagia and in all controls. There were no electrocardiographic changes during balloon distention and symptoms were immediately reversible with balloon deflation. Repeated simultaneous contractions consistent with spasm distal to the distending esophageal balloon occurred in 21 of 30 (70%) patients with dysphagia but in no normal volunteers (p less than 0.05). Dysphagia reproduction was associated with the finding of repeated simultaneous contractions distal to the intraesophageal balloon being found in 20 of 30 (66%) patients (p less than 0.05). Distal activity during balloon distention of the esophagus is associated with dysphagia reproduction in a significant number of patients without any other explanation for their symptom. The development of distal spasm in patients with intermittent dysphagia suggests an abnormality of neural control that may be important in the pathophysiology of dysphagia in these patients.\r"

However, the precise morphologic damage produced by RKB has not been characterized, and it is not known whether microvilli, once damaged, undergo repair. We have examined these issues by challenging rats with suspensions of 300 mg of RKB, boiled beans, or standard laboratory chow by orogastric lavage. Microvillus length was measured in electron micrographs from 6 to 20 h after challenge. Epithelial cell migration was determined by autoradiography after injection of [3H]thymidine. After challenge with RKB, microvilli (a) showed extensive vesiculation along the length of villi 2-4 h after challenge; (b) were reduced significantly in length along the entire villus 6 h after challenge; and (c) were near normal in length by 20 h after challenge. Microvillus length was also reduced significantly 6 h after challenge with boiled beans. The rate of cell migration was not accelerated by treatment with RKB. These data suggest that damage to microvilli caused by 300 mg of RKB is self-limited and reversible; microvilli once damaged by RKB are repaired. Repair of microvilli is due to intrinsic reparative processes rather than accelerated replacement of damaged cells. We speculate that microvilli may be repeatedly damaged and repaired after ingestion of dietary lectins.\r"

To study whether this difference is due to ethanol oxidation in the stomach, in the small intestine, or during first pass through the liver, we compared the AUCs after random administration of the same ethanol dose by the intravenous, oral, and intraduodenal routes to 5 abstaining alcoholics and via the two former routes to 10 subjects with Billroth II subtotal gastrectomy. In the nonoperated subjects, the AUCs after an ethanol dose (0.15 g/kg) given orally were 17% (p less than 0.01) of those achieved intravenously, in spite of the fact that greater than 99% of the dose had disappeared from the stomach at the completion of the AUC. By contrast, the AUCs after intraduodenal administration did not differ from those produced intravenously, indicating that neither the intestine nor the liver make a detectable contribution to this first-pass metabolism. Moreover, gastrectomy completely abolished the first-pass metabolism of ethanol. Gastric metabolism decreases the bioavailability of the ingested alcohol and thus attenuates its systemic toxicity. The abolition of this \"protective barrier\" in gastrectomized patients may increase their vulnerability to ethanol.\r"

The gallstones averaged 2.2 cm in diameter (range 1.3-3 cm) and contained layered or diffuse calcium detectable by computed tomography scan only (7 patients) or plain film (1 patient). After a 5F (1.7 mm) pigtail catheter was placed percutaneously into the gallbladder, ESWL fragmentation was performed using a renal stone lithotriptor. The patients were under general anesthesia and in the prone position on a support gantry designed for gallbladder stone ESWL. Following ESWL, methyl tert-butyl ether was infused and aspirated via the gallbladder catheter until no further stone material was radiologically detectable or could be dissolved. After 8-26 h (mean = 13 h) of methyl tert-butyl ether therapy, no radiologically detectable gallstones remained in 6 of 8 patients. Shell fragments of three peripherally calcified stones in 1 patient and the densely calcified, predominantly pigment stone in a second patient were refractory to combined therapy. Both ESWL and treatment with methyl tert-butyl ether were well tolerated in all patients, although bile leakage after catheter removal occurred in 3 patients, one of whom was treated by cholecystectomy. Additional measures to prevent bile leakage may be advisable if these two modalities are to be used in tandem. We found no evidence, however, that predissolution stone fragmentation with ESWL predisposed the gallbladder to either mucosal damage by methyl tert-butyl ether or increased absorption of it.\r"

  ".W": "To study directly the functions of the cells that line the bile ducts inside the liver, we developed a new technique for isolating intrahepatic bile duct epithelial cells (IBDECs) from normal rat liver. Parenchymal and nonparenchymal cells were separated from whole liver by enzymatic digestion and mechanical disruption; subpopulations of individual nonparenchymal cells then were isolated by serial counter-flow elutriation, isopycnic centrifugation, and immunoaffinity separation with a specific monoclonal antibody against an antigen on the plasma membrane of IBDECs. Using this approach, we isolated 1.2 +/- 0.2 x 10(6) (mean +/- SE) viable (greater than 95% trypan blue exclusion) cells, greater than 95% of which were identified as IBDECs by morphologic appearance and specific cytochemical markers. The IBDECs averaged 7.4 +/- 0.16 microM in diameter and retained their in situ appearance, including morphologic polarity. They appeared as single cells or as cell doublets attached by tight junctions that excluded ruthenium red. Microvilli were abundant and were restricted to the apical (i.e., luminal) domain of the plasma membrane. Coated pits were observed on both apical and basolateral cell surfaces. Internally, IBDECs contained a well-developed system of organelles, including mitochondria, Golgi, and discrete types of vesicles, such as coated vesicles, multivesicular bodies, and lysosomes. These results indicate that a highly purified suspension of viable, morphologically intact, and polar IBDECs can be prepared from normal rat liver using a novel approach that separates liver cells on the basis of size, density, and specific membrane components. The availability of such a model will allow experimental studies to be performed directly on IBDECs, an approach that has not previously been possible.\r"

  ".W": "In the present study we have isolated and purified fractions of nonparenchymal liver cells were isolated by collagenase-pronase digestion of the biliary and connective hepatic tissue, which remained undissociated after collagenase perfusion of the liver. Fractionation of the nonparenchymal fractions was then achieved by centrifugal elutriation. Both normal rats and rats with proliferated bile duct-like structures, which were induced either by a 14-day bile duct ligation or by feeding 0.1% alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate for 28 days, were used in these studies. Using a normal rat liver, the fraction richest in biliary epithelial cells was that obtained at a pump flow rate of 36-40 ml/min. In this fraction 1.8-3.8 x 10(6) cells per liver were recovered and up to 55% of them were positive for gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and cytokeratins 7 and 19, all of which were histochemically or immunohistochemically detected solely in the biliary structures in the intact rat liver. When the nonparenchymal cells were isolated from hyperplastic livers, the number of cells recovered in such a fraction ranged from 12 to 19 x 10(6) per liver, and as many as 60%-85% of the cells expressed phenotypes of biliary epithelial cells. These results indicate that (a) by centrifugal elutriation a fraction of nonparenchymal cells enriched in cells with biliary epithelial phenotypes can be obtained from rat liver and (b) the hepatic hyperplasia induced by biliary obstruction or alpha- naphthylisothiocyanate feeding is a useful and valid strategy for improving both the yield and the purity of the isolated biliary epithelial cells.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the consequences of corticosteroid treatment in postmenopausal patients with severe hepatitis B surface antigen-negative chronic active hepatitis, the findings in 43 such patients (mean age, 59 +/- 2 yr) were compared retrospectively to those in 46 premenopausal counterparts (mean age, 31 +/- 2 yr) after similar durations of initial (19 +/- 2 vs. 18 +/- 2 mo) and subsequent (48 +/- 8 vs. 63 +/- 11 mo) therapy. Postmenopausal patients entered remission as frequently as premenopausal women during initial treatment (81% vs. 83%, p = 0.9), deteriorated as commonly (7% vs. 7%), and developed drug-related complications as frequently (49% vs. 33%, p = 0.14). Postmenopausal women, however, had a higher cumulative frequency of complications (77% vs. 48%, p less than 0.01) and a greater occurrence of multiple complications (44% vs. 13%, p less than 0.01) than premenopausal counterparts during follow-up. Vertebral compression occurred more frequently (23% vs. 7%, p = 0.05), and lumbar spine densities were below the spontaneous fracture threshold more commonly (85% vs. 22%, p less than 0.002). Longer initial and cumulative durations of therapy were associated with the development of complications. We conclude that initial corticosteroid treatment is as safe and effective in postmenopausal women as in premenopausal counterparts. Postmenopausal women, however, have a higher cumulative frequency of complications long-term and a lower net benefit-risk ratio than comparably treated premenopausal women.\r"

  ".W": "Water retention in cirrhosis has classically been considered to be due to a low distal fluid delivery secondary to increased proximal sodium reabsorption. However, recent studies showing high plasma vasopressin levels in patients and rats with cirrhosis, ascites, and dilutional hyponatremia suggest that a nonosmotic vasopressin hypersecretion could be an alternative mechanism. To investigate the role of vasopressin in water retention in cirrhosis, the renal ability to excrete a water load (50 ml/kg body wt), as estimated by the minimum urinary osmolality and the percentage of the water load excreted during 3 h, was assessed in 10 control rats and in 20 cirrhotic rats with ascites and impaired water excretion and high urinary excretion of vasopressin. Twenty-four hours later, the same procedure was repeated in cirrhotic rats 20 min after the subcutaneous injection (30 micrograms/kg body wt) of d(CH2)5Tyr(Et) VAVP, an antagonist of the hydroosmotic effects of vasopressin (10 rats), or the vehicle (10 rats). Treatment with the vasopressin antagonist normalized water excretion in 9 of the 10 rats. No significant changes in renal water metabolism were observed in the group of rats given the vehicle. These results indicate that vasopressin hypersecretion is the predominant mechanism of the impairment in water excretion in rats with experimental cirrhosis and ascites.\r"

Autoradiographs of liver from mice treated with radiolabeled misonidazole demonstrated enhanced binding of adducts within hepatocytes surrounding hepatic veins. Livers from both hypoxic and normal mice had characteristic autoradiographic grain patterns reflecting regional oxygen tension variation in vivo. Differential binding of misonidazole adducts formed in hypoxic cells could have an application in studies of liver physiology and biochemistry.\r"

With the antiserum, intense immunocytochemical staining was detected in the tumors. Sephadex G-50 gel filtration showed that the tumors and plasma contained two molecular forms of pancreastatinlike immunoreactivity--a molecular form coeluted with synthetic human pancreastatin-52 and a larger molecular form (Mr approximately 12,000-15,000).

Ten healthy male volunteers were studied five times on separate days. The following five studies were performed in randomized order: (a) caerulein was intravenously infused at doses increasing from 7.5 to 120 ng/kg.h without the antagonist; (b) in addition to increasing doses of caerulein, loxiglumide was given intravenously at doses of 0.2, 1.0, or 5.0 mg/kg.h; (c) a solid-liquid 800-kcal meal was given without loxiglumide; (d) the 800-kcal meal was given with simultaneous infusion of 1 or 5 mg/kg.h loxiglumide; and (e) loxiglumide (5 mg/kg.h) was given. without caerulein or the test meal. Gallbladder volume was measured by ultrasound. Loxiglumide dose-dependently inhibited gallbladder emptying induced by caerulein or the meal. High doses of the antagonist did not only abolish meal-induced gallbladder emptying but increased gallbladder volume after administration of caerulein or the meal when compared with prior fasting values. The antagonist given alone markedly increased gallbladder volumes compared with prior fasting values. In conclusion, given alone markedly increased gallbladder volumes compared with prior fasting values. In conclusion, cholecystokinin is the hormone primarily and mainly responsible for mediation of gallbladder emptying after a regular meal. Cholecystokinin might also play a physiologic role in the regulation of the fasting tone of the gallbladder.\r"

All patients participated in a standard weight loss program consisting of dietary therapy, behavior modification, and physical exercise. The bubble was removed endoscopically after 3 months from both groups. Patients were followed for an additional 9 months after bubble removal and weight loss was monitored. Weight loss was the same in both groups at 3 months (18.7 lb vs. 17.2 lb). This was true whether determined by change in pounds, percentage of body weight, or body mass index. We concluded that the GEGB was of no added benefit as compared with sham insertion, when combined with a standard weight loss program. Because of the lack of proven efficacy and the relatively high cost, we recommend that such devices be restricted to controlled studies until significant benefits are proven.\r"

A gastric ulcer was found in 10 patients, a duodenal ulcer in 11, and gastric erosions with signs of bleeding in 3 patients. Given the unexpectedly high frequency of ulcer in these patients, an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was routinely performed early in the course of admission in 50 consecutive patients with venous thromboembolism. A gastric ulcer was found in 5 patients (10%), a duodenal ulcer in 7 (14%), and erosions in 2. Five of these patients had an unsuspected ulcer. A case can be made for prophylactic antiulcer therapy for all patients placed on anticoagulants for venous thromboembolism. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is indicated in patients with ulcer symptoms, in those with a previous history of peptic ulcer disease, and perhaps, in patients developing occult blood in the stools while on treatment with anticoagulants.\r"

These data suggest no advantage for the contact method of endoscopic Nd:YAG laser palliation of esophageal carcinoma with respect to number of treatment sessions, relief of dysphagia, or occurrence of complications.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of an endoscopic approach to gastric vagotomy using the neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser in dogs. Based on gross and histologic measurements, target zones for endoscopic vagotomy were defined with reference to mucosal side landmarks. Target zones containing the unbranched segments of the major intramural vagal branches were linear and symmetrically located anterior and posterior to the midline of the lesser curvature extending from the level of the esophagogastric junction to the proximal antral border. Because of minimal variability between dogs, this zone could be accessed endoscopically and reliably injured. Unfortunately, it was necessary to produce a nearly full thickness burn to interrupt the deep intramural vagal branches. Despite efforts to control dosimetry, delayed perforations occurred in three of four dogs. We conclude that endoscopic gastric vagotomy using the Nd:YAG laser is not feasible in the dog model because of difficulty controlling the depth of thermal injury. An endoscopic approach to vagotomy remains conceptually appealing because of the predictable location of and accessibility to a target zone.\r"

A femoral arterial line was established for the measurement of blood pressure and arterial bicarbonate. Laparotomy was performed and additional balloons were placed, via enterotomies, into the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Baseline measurements of intramural pH were obtained, and then the origin of the superior mesenteric artery was occluded. Additional measurements in all areas were made for two 1-hour intervals. Results showed rapid and marked acidosis as demonstrated by significant (p less than 0.001) pH changes in the jejunum, ileum, and right colon. There were no significant changes in the pH in the duodenum, left colon, or rectum. Systemic arterial pH remained normal. These data demonstrate that tonometric balloons endoscopically placed into the right colon will reflect superior mesenteric artery occlusion at an early stage, and that similar information is likely to be gained by endoscopic placement of these balloons into the jejunum.\r"

During endoscopy, using recently sterilized endoscopes that were flushed with 3% hydrogen peroxide after the glutaraldehyde cycle, instantaneous blanching (the \"snow white\" sign) and effervescence were noted on the mucosal surfaces when the water button was depressed. No patient subsequently suffered morbidity or mortality associated with this peroxide enteritis, and the biopsy specimens revealed nonspecific inflammation. The toxicity of hydrogen peroxide when used in enema form is reviewed, as well as the pathogenesis of peroxide enteritis.\r"

This study assessed the efficacy and safety of EVL as definitive therapy for bleeding esophageal varices. During a 16-month period, 68 consecutive patients with bleeding varices had EVL. Fourteen patients died from 3 to 125 (median = 12.5) days after initial EVL. Fifteen (88%) of those actively bleeding at index treatment had bleeding controlled during index hospitalization. Survivors of index hospitalization had a 37% incidence of recurrent bleeding. Thirty-five patients had varices eradicated or reduced to small size with a median of five EVL treatments. No significant treatment-related nonbleeding complications resulted from 265 EVL sessions. EVL appears to control active variceal bleeding and eradicates varices with repeat treatments. EVL results in few nonbleeding complications, and may be employed as a safe alternative to sclerotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate mechanisms of angiotensin II (Ang II)-related hypertension, we infused angiotensin (76 ng/min s.c.) into rats with minipumps for 10-14 days. Control rats received sham pumps. We measured blood pressure by tail-cuff, and the excretion of aldosterone and prostaglandins (PG) (PGE2, prostacyclin derivative 6kPGF1 alpha, and thromboxane [Tx] derivative TxB2). Angiotensin II increased blood pressure by 20 mm Hg by day 2 and by 90 mm Hg by day 10. Aldosterone excretion increased from 10 to 70 ng/day in Ang II rats by day 7. Urine PGE2 did not increase in angiotensin rats; however, both 6kPGF1 alpha and TxB2 excretion increased with angiotensin. Control rats had no changes in any of these parameters. A sympathetic component was tested in a separate group of angiotensin rats that received phenoxybenzamine (300 micrograms/kg/day) during angiotensin infusion; their increase in blood pressure of 40 mm Hg at 10 days was less than in those rats with angiotensin alone but more than in control rats. Phenoxybenzamine did not influence the angiotensin-induced increases in excretion of 6kPGF1 alpha or TxB2. Additional groups of conscious angiotensin and control rats were equipped with splanchnic nerve electrodes on day 14 for recording of sympathetic nerve activity. Angiotensin rats had greater basal sympathetic nerve activity than the control rats. Incremental methoxamine injections demonstrated altered baroreceptor reflex function in rats receiving angiotensin. We conclude that increased blood pressure with chronic angiotensin infusion is accompanied by increased production of aldosterone and increased sympathetic tone. The latter may be modulated by PG.\r"

Circ Res 1988;62:749-756). We have further explored the hypothesis that contractile agonists are important regulators of smooth muscle cell growth by examining the effects of another contractile agonist, arginine vasopressin, on growth of cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells. Autoradiographic analysis as well as cell number determinations showed that arginine vasopressin (1 microM) did not stimulate proliferation in cells made quiescent in a defined serum-free media nor did it augment proliferation in 0.4% fetal bovine serum. However, flow cytometric analysis of cellular protein content demonstrated that arginine vasopressin (1 microM) did induce cellular hypertrophy in quiescent cultures after 4 days of treatment, increasing smooth muscle cell protein content by 35% as compared with vehicle-treated controls. The increase in protein content showed a concentration dependence. Cellular hypertrophy was accompanied by an increase in [35S]methionine incorporation, which was elevated 45% by 24 hours. Both the increase in [35S]methionine incorporation and the increase in protein content could be prevented by the specific arginine vasopressin receptor antagonist. [1-beta-mercapto-beta,beta-cyclopentamethylene propionic acid), 2-(O-methyl)tyrosine] arginine vasopressin. An increase in [35S]methionine incorporation was observed between 12 and 24 hours after treatment of quiescent smooth muscle cells for only 5 minutes with arginine vasopressin (1 microM). Arginine vasopressin-induced increases in [35S]methionine incorporation was increased within 6 hours after treatment. These studies show that arginine vasopressin, like angiotensin II, induces hypertrophy but not hyperplasia of cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells.\r"

  ".W": "Chromogranin A (CgA) is the major soluble protein in catecholamine storage vesicles. To gain insight into its function, we isolated CgA clones from a size-selected lambda gt10 rat pheochromocytoma complementary DNA (cDNA) library. The longest cDNA insert identified was 2.2 kb and encoded the entire 462-amino acid open reading frame of rat CgA including an 18-amino acid hydrophobic signal peptide. Comparison of rat CgA with the recently published sequences of bovine CgA and human CgA revealed regions of strong homology at the N-and COOH-termini as well as variant areas predominantly in the middle portion of the molecule. Regions highly conserved and therefore suggestive of functional importance included 1) multiple paired basic residues, which may serve as proteolytic processing signals; 2) a region homologous to porcine pancreastatin, a putative modulator of peptide hormone release; and 3) a short hydrophobic disulfide loop region near the N-terminus that may have a role in the targeting of CgA to secretory vesicles. On the other hand, lack of conservation of the membrane attachment sequence arginine-glycine-aspartic acid argues against its functional importance in CgA. In addition, the presence of a unique polyglutamine region in rat CgA points to a possible messenger RNA (mRNA) splice junction. Northern blot experiments demonstrated the presence of an approximately 2.2 kb rat CgA mRNA in a neuroendocrine distribution (adrenal, brain, pheochromocytoma cells, but not skeletal muscle, heart, or kidney). Southern blot studies were consistent with the presence of a single CgA gene within the rat pheochromocytoma cell genome. Finally, comparison of the present rat pheochromocytoma cDNA clones with those recently obtained from normal rat adrenal gland reveals minor but apparently real differences that suggest CgA microheterogeneity.\r"

  ".U": "90007663\r", 
  ".W": "In normotensive rats, stimulation of renal mechanoreceptors by an increase in ureteral pressure results in a contralateral inhibitory renorenal reflex response with contralateral natriuresis. Similar effects are produced by stimulation of renal chemoreceptors by renal pelvic perfusion with 0.9 M NaCl. However, in spontaneously hypertensive rats the renorenal reflex responses to renal mechanoreceptor and chemoreceptor stimulation are impaired. The present study was performed to examine whether the renorenal reflexes were altered in two-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats, a model of hypertension in which it has been suggested that the afferent renal nerves contribute to the enhanced peripheral sympathetic nervous activity. A 0.2 mm silver clip was placed around one renal artery 4 weeks before the study. At the time of study, mean arterial pressure was 156 +/- 4 mm Hg. Renal mechanoreceptor and chemoreceptor stimulation of either the nonclipped or clipped kidney failed to affect ipsilateral afferent renal nerve activity, contralateral efferent renal nerve activity, and contralateral urine flow rate and urinary sodium excretion. Renal denervation of the nonclipped kidney increased ipsilateral urinary sodium excretion from 0.65 +/- 0.13 to 1.50 +/- 0.42 mumol/min/g and decreased contralateral urinary sodium excretion from 0.18 +/- 0.03 to 0.13 +/- 0.03 mumol/min/g (p less than 0.05). Thus, denervation of the nonclipped kidney resulted in a similar contralateral excitatory renorenal reflex response as in normotensive rats. However, denervation of the clipped kidney increased both ipsilateral and contralateral urinary sodium excretion, from 0.14 +/- 0.04 to 0.27 +/- 0.5 mumol/min/g and from 1.29 +/- 0.33 to 2.09 +/- 0.59 mumol/min/g (p less than 0.01), respectively. Taken together these data suggest that the lack of inhibitory renorenal reflexes from the clipped kidney may enhance efferent sympathetic nervous activity and thereby contribute to the hypertension in two-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats.\r"

The levels of both metabolites were determined in saliva obtained during the migraine attacks, during the intervals between attacks, and after 2 months of treatment with nicardipine (20 mg every 8 h.) or placebo. The therapeutic response was evaluated on the basis of the number of migraine attacks. The results show a significant increase in the levels of both eicosanoids during the migraine attacks. In contrast to the placebo group, the number of migraine attacks and the levels of both arachidonic acid metabolites are markedly lower in the nicardipine group. Our results suggest calcium entry into the cytosol as an explanation for the increase in PGE2 and TXA2. Nicardipine interferes with calcium mobilization, thereby inhibiting arachidonic acid metabolite synthesis.\r"

The duration of headache history was 21.9 +/- 12.8 years. Each patient took an average of 38.8 +/- 22.8 tablets or suppositories a week and an average of 2.5 distinct drugs. Most patients used drugs containing several components. Caffeine was contained in at least one drug in all cases, ergotamine in 80.0% and pyrazolone in 77.1%. All patients were admitted to the hospital for two weeks. The analgesics were discontinued abruptly and the withdrawal symptoms were alleviated by neuroleptics and neurotropics. During the second week of hospital stay we started a basic therapy with calcium antagonists or beta blockers in patients suffering from migraine initially and with tricyclic antidepressants, physical therapy or biofeedback in patients suffering from tension type headaches initially. At the end of the study (mean follow-up period = 16.8 +/- 13.6 months) 38 patients (70.1%) were evaluated. 76.3% of these patients had significantly reduced their analgesic intake, 60.5% had experienced a significant relief of headache both in intensity and frequency, and 23.7% were therapeutic failures. Analysis of the time course of relapse revealed the first six months after hospital discharge as the critical period determining long-term success. The variables tested for prognostic relevance (age, sex, duration of headache history, number of tablets or suppositories taken a week, organic mental syndrome, and type of initial headaches) were not statistically significant.\r"

The visual symptoms studied were those not specific for headache, i.e., sensitivity to light and blurred vision. Sensitivity to light in the absence of headache was reported by 27.8% of controls and 44.7% of headache sufferers (p less than 0.05). The latter figure increased to 71.3% when headache was actually present (p less than 0.001). Blurred vision occurred in 13.5% of controls and 7.4% of headache sufferers (not significant). In the presence of headache, the latter figure increased to 44.7% (p less than 0.01). Of the eye strain factors studied, bright light was reported to precipitate headache in 29.3% and to aggravate it in 73.4%. For reading, these figures were 16.0% and 55.3%, respectively; for working at the computer screen, 14.5% and 31.3%; and for watching television, 6.4% and 27.7%. We conclude that visual symptoms are more common in chronic headache and eye strain factors more important than is generally recognized.\r"

In numerous research studies on non-drug treatment efficacy, subjects have been routinely required to practice daily self-regulation techniques. This paper examines the relationship between amount of home practice and treatment outcome, and the extent to which subjects adhere to training requirements. A total of 42 subjects completed daily home practice records for 32 weeks. Fourteen subjects had randomly been assigned to an autogenic phases group, 17 to an electromyographic biofeedback group, and 11 to a thermal training group. All subjects charted frequency of practice, change of feeling in the target area, time required to bring about the change, and general body relaxation. Relationships between subject compliance and 11 selected variables including demographics, headache activity components, treatment group, and treatment outcome were evaluated. Results support home practice, but place greater emphasis on its quality rather than its quantity.\r"

Appl. Physiol. 65: 1957-1961, 1988). To evaluate this cardiac response in subacute (8 days) hypoxia and to explore its reversal with restoration of normoxia, six subjects received an IP infusion under normoxia (condition N), after 8 days in altitude (4,350 m, condition H8), on the same day in altitude after inhalation of O2 restoring normoxic arterial O2 saturation (SaO2, condition HO), and 6-11 h (condition RN) and 4-5 mo (condition ND) after the return to sea level. Cardiac chronotropic response to IP, evaluated by the mean increase in heart rate from base value (delta HR, min-1), was lower in condition H8 [mean 30 +/- 13 (SD)] than in condition N (50 +/- 14, P less than 0.03); it was slightly higher in condition HO (38 +/- 14) or condition RN (42 +/- 15) than condition H8 but still significantly different from condition N (P less than 0.03), despite normal values of SaO2. delta HR in condition ND (55 +/- 10) returned to base N value. These findings confirm the hypothesis of a hypoxia-induced decrease in cardiac chronotropic function. Two possible mechanisms are suggested: an O2-dependent one, rapidly reversible with recent restoration of normoxia, and a more slowly reversible mechanism, probably a downregulation of the cardiac beta-receptors.\r"

Rev. Respir. Dis. 134: 752-756, 1986; J. Appl. Physiol. 63: 942-950, 1987). In this experiment we study the effects of alveolar hypoxia on this injury. Anesthetized dogs underwent thoracotomy and occlusion of the left pulmonary artery. Twenty-four hours later the dogs were reanesthetized, and a double-lumen endotracheal tube was placed. The right lung was continuously ventilated with an inspiratory O2 fraction (FIO2) of 0.35. In seven study animals the left lung was ventilated with an FIO2 of 0 for 3 h after the left pulmonary artery occluder was removed. In six control animals the left lung was ventilated with an FIO2 of 0.35 during the same reperfusion period. Postmortem bloodless wet-to-dry weight ratios were 5.87 +/- 0.20 for the left lower lobe and 5.32 +/- 0.12 for the right lower lobe in the dogs with hypoxic ventilation (P less than 0.05 for right vs. left lobes). These values were not significantly different from the control dog lung values of 5.94 +/- 0.22 for the left lower lobe and 5.11 +/- 0.07 for the right lower lobe (P less than 0.05 for right vs. left lobes). All values were significantly higher than our laboratory normal of 4.71 +/- 0.06. We conclude that reperfusion injury is unaffected by alveolar hypoxia during the reperfusion phase.\r"

Five healthy ponies 2.4-4 yr old [mean wt 255 +/- 15 (SE) kg] were used. On the one hand, inertance of the respiratory system (Irs) was computed from the value of the resonant frequency (fr) measured by the forced oscillation technique. On the other hand, respiratory airflow, tidal volume (VT), and transpulmonary pressure (PL) changes were recorded while the ponies were performing a light treadmill exercise, and IL was calculated as the ratio of the associated differences in inertial pressure (delta Pin) to volume acceleration (delta V). Respiratory airflow and VT were measured with a Fleisch pneumotachograph (no. 5) and PL with an intraesophageal balloon catheter. First, the protocol was carried out with the ponies breathing air and He-O2, second, while the ponies breathed through two additional tubes (100 cm long, 3 cm ID), then one, and finally none, fixed on the Fleisch pneumotachograph. Finally, the contribution of the extra- vs. the intrathoracic airways to IL was estimated by measuring the lateral midtracheal pressure recorded simultaneously with the aforementioned parameters. The values of Irs calculated with fr and of IL calculated on the basis of the delta Pin-delta V ratio were 29.8 +/- 0.4 and 19.8 +/- 1.0.10(-4) kPa.l-1.s-2, respectively. During He-O2 breathing IL decreased about three times; this result was similar to the predicted decrease based on gas density only.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The role of adenosine in the ventilatory depression induced by hypoxia was studied in 82 spontaneously breathing urethan-anesthetized 4-day-old rabbit pups. Respiration was monitored with a pneumotachograph. The animals were exposed to hypoxia (6% O2 in N2) for 30 min or until the occurrence of terminal apnea. In all animals hypoxia produced an initial increase in ventilation followed by a decrease. In the control group 52% of the animals became apneic after 7 min of hypoxic exposure. By contrast, pretreatment with dipyridamole (10 or 20 mg/kg), an adenosine uptake blocker, significantly shortened the time needed to reach apnea. Thus at 7 min of hypoxia 93% of the animals that received dipyridamole became apneic. On the other hand, administration of adenosine antagonists 8-p-sulfophenyltheophylline (5 or 8 mg/kg) and aminophylline (10 or 25 mg/kg) significantly prolonged the time required to produce apnea. Only 20% of the animals that received these antagonists became apneic at 7 min of hypoxia. These results suggest that adenosine is potentially involved in the ventilatory depression produced by hypoxia in neonatal rabbit pups.\r"

We sought to determine whether the responses of O2 uptake (VO2), CO2 output (VCO2), and ventilation (VE) in the transition between loadless pedaling and higher work rates are linear in this respect. Four healthy subjects performed a total of 158 cycle ergometer tests in which 10 min of exercise followed unloaded pedaling. Each subject performed three to nine tests at each of seven work rates, spaced evenly below the maximum the subject could sustain. VO2, VCO2, and VE were measured breath by breath, and studies at the same work rate were time aligned and averaged. Computerized nonlinear regression techniques were used to fit a single exponential and two more complex expressions to each response time course. End-exercise blood lactate was determined at each work rate. Both VE and VO2 kinetics were markedly slower at work rates associated with sustained blood lactate elevations. A tendency was also detected for VO2 (but not VE) kinetics to be slower as work rate increased for exercise intensities not associated with lactic acidosis (P less than 0.01). VO2 kinetics at high work rates were well characterized by the addition of a slower exponential component to the faster component, which was seen at lower work rates. In contrast, VCO2 kinetics did not slow at the higher exercise intensities; this may be the result of the coincident influence of several sources of CO2 related to lactic acidosis. These findings provide guidance for interpretation of ventilatory and gas exchange kinetics.\r"

However, there is little information concerning the molecular events important in leukocyte adherence to EC. Intracellular activation of protein kinase C and the calcium-second messenger system leads to the stimulation of a number of important functions in PMN and monocytes. We compared the effects of members of these pathways on human PMN and monocyte adherence to cultured bovine aortic EC. We observed that phorbol myristate acetate, phorbol, 12,13-dibutyrate, L-alpha-1-oleoyl-2-acetoyl-sn-3-glycerol, and ionomycin each induced significant dose-dependent increases in PMN adherence to EC monolayers. In contrast, similar concentrations of each of these agents induced significant decreases in EC adherence of monocytes enriched by countercurrent centrifugal elutriation. Separate experiments determined that the differences in PMN and monocyte adherence to EC were not related to differences in oxidant production because 1) phorbol myristate acetate and L-alpha-1-oleoyl-2-acetoyl-sn-3-glycerol caused similar marked increases in both PMN and monocyte superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide production and 2) ionomycin, which had opposing effects on PMN and monocyte adherence, had no effect on PMN and monocyte superoxide anion or hydrogen peroxide release. We conclude that activators of protein kinase C and the Ca-second messenger pathway have opposite effects on PMN and monocyte adherence to EC and that these effects are mediated by O2 radical-independent mechanisms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We measured blood and CSF acid-base variables in two groups (n = 7 in each) of anesthetized, paralyzed, and mechanically ventilated dogs with bilateral ligation of renal pedicles (to eliminate saluresis). After base-line samples were obtained (-1 h), furosemide (50 mg/kg) was administered intravenously within 15 min (group II); group I received an equal volume of half-normal saline. ARA was induced 1 h later (0 h) and arterial CO2 tension was maintained between 55 and 60 Torr for 5 h. Mean cisternal CSF PCO2 was 42.8 +/- 2.6 and 39.5 +/- 1.7 Torr, respectively in groups I and II and rose approximately 20 Torr during ARA. In group I, CSF [HCO3-] was 22.0 +/- 1.0, 24.8 +/- 0.6, and 25.4 +/- 1.6 meq/l, respectively at 0, 2.5, and 5 h. Respective values for group II were 22.2 +/- 1.3, 24.3 +/- 1.8, and 24.6 +/- 1.0 meq/l. These values were not significantly different from each other. In each group, CSF [Na+-Cl-] increased significantly during ARA, but the changes were not significantly different when the two groups were compared. We conclude that furosemide at the dose used in the present study does not change ionic composition and acid-base balance of cisternal CSF compared with control. Because changes in CSF [Na+-Cl-] during ARA were similar in both groups, any inhibition of Cl- influx into CSF by furosemide should have been proportional to that of Na+.\r"

Muscle biopsies were taken from the gluteus medius and longissimus muscles before training and after 2, 4, 8, and 12 wk of training and from the brachiocephalicus muscle before and after training. Both the percentage and the area of type IIa fibers increased and the percentage of type IIb fibers decreased in the gluteus medius muscle during the first 2 wk of training, and then no further significant difference was noted. The percentage of type I fibers increased in the brachiocephalicus muscle, and the area of type IIb fibers increased in the longissimus muscle. The citrate synthase activity increased in the gluteus muscle only, and the increase was seen during the first 2 wk. No significant differences were seen in 3-hydroxy-acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase activities in the muscles during the entire training period. Less glycogen was utilized in the gluteus muscle and less blood lactate accumulated when the horses performed an unloaded submaximal exercise test after compared with before training. It can be concluded that rapid changes are induced in the gluteus medius muscle when horses are trained pulling a light-draft resistance at a submaximal trotting speed.\r"

Several cats were also studied during severe normocapnic hypoxia. Experiments were repeated while the same animals were chronically carotid body denervated (CBD). The increase in respiratory frequency (f) leading to thermal tachypnea occurred at a lower body temperature (Tb) in severe hypocapnic hypoxia than in ambient air, but this effect was less pronounced when hypocapnia was corrected. No significant changes were observed during mild hypoxia or hyperoxia compared with normoxia in intact animals. After CBD, thermal tachypnea occurred at lower Tb in air than it did with intact animals in three of five cats, and it also occurred at lower Tb in mild hypocapnic hypoxia compared with air. It appears, therefore, that in conscious cats exposed to heat load 1) severe hypoxia enhances thermal tachypnea, 2) this effect persists after CBD, which suggests that it originates from a central action of hypoxia, and 3) the chemoreceptor afferents, to some degree, inhibit the onset of thermal tachypnea, as was previously observed for hypoxic tachypnea, which appears only in CBD cats (J. Appl. Physiol. 49: 769-777, 1980). Therefore, triggering of thermal and hypoxic tachypnea may involve common central mechanisms, probably located in the diencephalic structures under the control of afferents from arterial chemoreceptors.\r"

Here, we examined the potential contribution of an additional mechanism to the 5-HT-mediated increase in impulse activity. Approximately 40% of rabbit visceral C-fiber neurons exhibit a protracted (greater than 3 s) spike afterhyperpolarization (AHPslow) that is a major determinant of repetitive firing properties in these neurons. Intracellular recording methods were applied to rabbit nodose ganglion neurons in vitro to assess whether 5-HT could increase excitability through effects on the AHPslow. Results revealed a concentration-dependent 5-HT-mediated depression of the AHPslow amplitude and duration that was accompanied by decreased accommodation of action potential firing. Experiments with 5-HT receptor antagonists further showed that this autacoid depressed the AHPslow through a different 5-HT receptor subtype than that subserving the 5-HT-induced depolarization. Thus the AHPslow represents a distinct locus where 5-HT can increase the impulse activity of these visceral C-fiber afferents.\r"

Expiratory activation of the transversus abdominis in all conditions was considerably reduced after laparotomy. This reduction was real, as no change in the compound muscle action potential during single pulse stimulation was observed. In contrast, expiratory recruitment of either the triangularis sterni or the abdominal external oblique was maintained or increased. We therefore conclude that laparotomy inhibits not only activation of the diaphragm during inspiration but also activation of the transversus abdominis during expiration. Visceral afferents thus affect in concert the two respiratory muscles lining the peritoneum. The present findings also emphasize the important fact that the pattern of activation of a particular abdominal muscle is not necessarily representative of the entire abdominal musculature.\r"

At a constant driving pressure, the flow of the following solutions was measured sequentially: normal saline and albumin solution (3, 5.5, 8, or 15 g/100 ml saline), hyaluronidase solution (0.02 g/100 ml), and albumin solution (same concentration used before hyaluronidase solution). The albumin-to-saline flow ratios averaged 1.00 +/- 0.23 (SD), 1.01 +/- 0.21, 1.32 +/- 0.63, and 1.54 +/- 0.36 for albumin concentrations of 3, 5.5, 8, and 15 g/100 ml, respectively. These ratios were higher than the corresponding values of 0.88, 0.78, 0.72, and 0.5 expected if the flow of albumin solution were to depend only on fluid viscosity. The flow of dextran and hyaluronan solutions was more viscosity dependent than the flow of albumin solutions. The increased flow of albumin solution could be the result of a reduced excluded volume of albumin caused by collagen and glycosaminoglycans with an increased albumin concentration. The flow of hyaluronidase solution was 24 +/- 22 (SD)-fold (n = 36) larger than the flow of albumin solution. Thus hyaluronan was responsible for most of the hydraulic resistance of the interstitium to bulk flow. After its degradation, the flow of albumin solution became more viscosity dependent. The interaction between plasma proteins and glycosaminoglycans in the pulmonary interstitium could serve to enhance clearance of microvascular filtrate, particularly under conditions of large protein leaks.\r"

In eight anesthetized sheep, artificial mucus (100 P) was infused continuously (1 ml/min) into the left main bronchus via a cannula inserted through the dorsal wall of the left main bronchus after thoracotomy. Outcoming mucus was collected every 10 min from the end of a cuffed orotracheal tube. Animals were ventilated with a Harvard respirator at a low frequency with superimposed HFO at 14 Hz with asymmetrical waveforms generated by a digitally controlled electromagnetic piston pump (expiratory bias: peak expiratory flow 3.8 l/s, peak inspiratory flow 1.3 l/s; inspiratory bias: reverse of expiratory bias). The influence of posture and of HFO airflow bias on mucus clearance was determined. In the horizontal position, mucus clearance with expiratory biased HFO was 3.5 +/- 2 (SD) ml/10 min. Head-down tilt produced a clearance of 3.1 +/- 3 ml/10 min; addition of HFO with expiratory bias increased clearance to 11.0 +/- 2.0 ml/10 min (P less than 0.05). No clearance occurred with inspiratory biased HFO during head-down tilt. These results indicate that expiratory biased HFO at the airway opening can clear excessive airway secretions and augment clearance by postural drainage.\r"

Motor units were classified based on their isometric contractile force responses and fatigue indexes (FI). The muscle fibers belonging to individual units (i.e., the muscle unit) were identified using the glycogen-depletion method. Fibers were classified as type I or II based on histochemical staining for myofibrillar adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) after alkaline preincubation. The rate of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity of each fiber was determined using a microphotometric procedure. The location of capillaries was determined from muscle cross sections stained for ATPase after acid (pH = 4.2) preincubation. The capillarity of muscle unit fibers was determined by counting the number of capillaries surrounding fibers and by calculating the number of capillaries per fiber area. A significant correlation was found between the fatigue resistance of DIA units and the mean SDH activity of muscle unit fibers. A significant correlation was also observed between DIA unit fatigue resistance and both indexes of muscle unit fiber capillarity. The mean SDH activity and mean capillary density of muscle unit fibers were also correlated. We conclude that DIA motor unit fatigue resistance depends, at least in part, on the oxidative capacity and capillary density of muscle unit fibers.\r"

  ".W": "We used the stepwise pressure elevation technique to study the relationship between rate of constant weight gain (Qf) and microvascular pressure (Pc) in eight isolated canine left lower lobes. The slope of this relationship, which is assumed to represent lobar conductance to filtration (Kf) was 0.0022 +/- 0.003 ml.min-1.cmH2O-1.g dry wt-1. The intercept when Qf = 0, Pcrit, commonly interpreted as the Pc at which the balance of forces across the microvasculature is overwhelmed, was 9.53 +/- 1.18 cmH2O, a lower Pc than commonly used in weight transient experiments. Consequently, at Pc greater than 9.53 cmH2O, isogravimetric conditions were never achieved. In 12 additional experiments, the perfusate's colloid osmotic pressure (II) was increased from 12 to 37 mmHg with albumin. On average, Pcrit increased from 12.2 to 23 cmH2O. Using the changes in Pcrit and II, we estimated the microvascular drag reflection coefficient for albumin (sigma d) to be 0.67. After the addition of albumin, Pc less than Pcrit induced constant weight loss along the same Qf-to-Pc relationship. To control for time, five additional lobes were observed at constant Pc for 100-180 min. Slight acceleration of the rate of weight gain occurred after they increased their weight by 30-40%. The low Kf and high sigma d, as well as the stability of the preparation, suggest a well-preserved microvasculature. Qf at Pc between 12 and 24 cmH2O did not influence measurements of Kf using the weight transient method. The low Pcrit may reflect obliteration of lymphatic channels.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was designed to determine the contribution of weight bearing to the adaptations of the plantaris (PL) to synergist removal. PL from female rats were exposed to 28 days of a simultaneous condition of synergist ablation and hindlimb suspension. At 28 days, contractile responses and morphological measures were obtained and compared with muscles that either had synergists intact or were weight bearing or a combination of both. Synergist ablation prolonged PL maximum isometric twitch tension (Pt), time to peak tension (12%), and one-half relaxation time (12%); increased Pt (26%), maximum isometric tetanic tension (Po, 44%), fatigue resistance (FI, 42%), and fast fiber cross-sectional area (FT CSA, 20%); and decreased Pt/Po (13%) over nonablation counterparts. Suspension decreased PL Pt (26%), Po (26%), rest length (16%), FT CSA (31%), and slow-twitch fiber (ST) number (24%) but increased FI (75%) over weight-bearing counterparts. PL from weight-bearing animals were heavier than from suspended animals, and the extent of this response was greatest after synergist removal. Whole muscle and ST CSA and ST area contribution were greater only in weight-bearing synergist ablation muscles. Daily weight bearing (4 h) in synergist ablation hindlimb suspension groups caused PL weights and ST expressions to be halfway between 24-h suspension and 24-h weight-bearing groups. Our results suggest that weight bearing is not essential to the induction of several adaptations associated with synergist ablation but is required to cause the large muscle mass and ST expression characteristic of this model.\r"

Subjects (n = 13) contracted (knee extension) at a target force of 66% of the maximal voluntary contraction force (MVC) to fatigue, and the recovery in MVC and endurance (time to fatigue) were measured. Force recovered rapidly [half-time (t 1/2) less than 15 s] and after 2 min of recovery was not significantly different (P greater than 0.05) from the precontraction value. Endurance recovered more slowly (t 1/2 approximately 1.2 min) and was still significantly depressed after 2 and 4 min of recovery (P less than 0.05). In separate experiments (n = 10) muscle biopsy specimens were taken from the quadriceps femoris muscle before and after two successive contractions to fatigue at 66% of MVC with a recovery period of 2 or 4 min in between. The muscle content of high-energy phosphates and lactate was similar at fatigue after both contractions, whereas glucose 6-phosphate was lower after the second contraction (P less than 0.05). During recovery, muscle lactate decreased and was 74 and 43% of the value at fatigue after an elapsed period of 2 and 4 min, respectively. The decline in H+ due to lactate disappearance is balanced, however, by a release of H+ due to resynthesis of phosphocreatine, and after 2 min of recovery calculated muscle pH was found to remain at a low level similar to that at fatigue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Considerable variability of regional shortening was seen in a given row, which was reproducible on repeat study in individual dogs but which differed between mechanical ventilation and spontaneous breathing. There were no consistent patterns among dogs. Regional shortening obtained from the change in length of rows extending from chest wall to central tendon showed no consistent differences among dogs during spontaneous breathing. At equal tidal volumes, all regions (except the ventral costal diaphragm) shortened more during spontaneous breathing than during mechanical ventilation.\r"

As successively more beads of a given diameter (58, 548, or 3,175 microns) were introduced into a lung lobe, a linear relationship between QL and Qev was obtained as they both decreased. The slope of the graph of QL vs. Qev with progressive embolism was directly proportional to the bead diameter. This suggested an approach for estimating the total vascular volume in vessels smaller than the diameter of the beads before embolization, referred to as Qm. If it is assumed that most of the transvascular diffusional exchange of 3HOH occurs in vessels smaller than the smallest beads (mainly capillaries) and that vessel obstruction does not change the ratio of Qev to the perfused capillary volume, the slope of the plot of QL vs. Qev is an estimate of the fraction, Qm/QL, of the total vascular volume in vessels smaller than the bead diameter. In the dog lung lobes studied, Qm/QL was approximately 0.64 for 58-microns vessels, 0.75 for 548-microns vessels, and 0.82 for 3,175-microns vessels. The results suggest that, with occlusion of vessels greater than or equal to 58 microns, 3HOH does not diffuse significantly into unperfused regions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Two hypotheses were tested: 1) that micromolar concentrations of aminophylline enhanced contractility of isolated skeletal muscle and 2) that the potentiating effect of aminophylline was dependent on the presence of extracellular calcium ions. Muscles were removed, placed in aerated Ringer solution at 20 degrees C, attached to a force transducer, and stimulated directly. Muscles in normal Ringer and aminophylline Ringer were compared throughout the frequency-force relationship from twitches to maximum tetanic force. Aminophylline increased twitch force significantly at concentrations as low as 25 microM. Over a range of stimulation frequencies, but especially at 10 and 20 Hz, aminophylline increased tetanic force. The potentiating effect of aminophylline (100 microM) was reduced or eliminated in calcium-free Ringer containing 10 mM magnesium. We conclude that aminophylline, at therapeutic concentrations, enhances muscle contractility, and the enhancement is dependent on the presence of extracellular calcium. These findings support the concept that aminophylline is effective in improving respiration in humans with airway obstruction by enhancing diaphragmatic contractility.\r"

Immediately after exercise, STPO fell to 85, 75, 55, and 47% of preexercise values for prior exercise equivalent to 60, 80, 100, and 120% of maximal O2 uptake, respectively. STPO had fully recovered by 1 min of postexercise after submaximal work rates (60 and 80%). Recovery was delayed until after 4 min of postexercise after maximal exercise (100%). STPO remained at approximately 90% of preexercise values 8 min postexercise after supramaximal exercise (120%). STPO immediately after exercise and during recovery was inversely proportional to prior exercise intensity. The recovery curve for STPO was similar to that previously reported for creatine phosphate resynthesis after dynamic and isometric exercise. The absolute STPO regained in the initial phase was not inversely proportional to either exercise intensity or 4-min postexercise blood lactate levels, which suggests that factors other than changes in pH alone may mediate initial power recovery.\r"

Electroneurographic studies of pulmonary afferents established that RARs but not lung C-fibers were stimulated by intermittent lung collapse during deflation, collapse being produced by removing positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP, 4 cmH2O) or by applying negative end-expiratory pressure (NEEP, -4 cmH2O). We measured tracheal secretion by the \"hillocks\" method. Removing PEEP or applying NEEP for 1 min increased secretion from a base line of 6.0 +/- 1.1 to 11.8 +/- 1.7 and 22.0 +/- 2.8 hillocks.cm-2.min-1, respectively (P less than 0.005). After PEEP was restored, dynamic lung compliance (Cdyn) was 37% below control, and secretion remained elevated (P less than 0.05). A decrease in Cdyn stimulates RARs but not other pulmonary afferents. Hyperinflation, which restored Cdyn and RAR activity to control, returned secretion rate to base line. Secretory responses to lung collapse were abolished by vagal cooling (6 degrees C), by pulmonary vagal section, or by atropine. We conclude that RAR stimulation reflexly increases airway secretion. We cannot exclude the possibility that reduced input from slowly adapting stretch receptors contributed to the secretory response.\r"

We investigated whether replenishment of depleted alveolar surfactant by the intratracheal instillation of calf lung surfactant extract (CLSE) would mitigate the increase in alveolar permeability to solute. Twenty-eight rabbits were exposed to 100% O2 for 72 h and received intratracheal instillations of 125 mg CLSE (approximately 170 mumol dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine) at 24 and 48 h. The interlobar and intralobar distribution of CLSE was quantified by adding [14C]dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine liposes into the instillate and measuring the levels of activity in lung tissue. CLSE was nonuniformly distributed in the different lung lobes, the right lower lobe receiving more CLSE than the rest. Alveolar epithelial permeability to solute was assessed by instilling 10 ml isotonic saline, which contained a trace amount of [57Co]cyanocobalamin, in the right lower lobe and measuring the disappearance of the tracer from the alveolar saline and its appearance in the arterial blood during a 1-h period. CLSE treatment was associated with significantly increased 72-h survival in hyperoxia compared with saline-treated controls (number of survivors: 16/17 vs. 5/11, P less than 0.01). CLSE treatment significantly reduced the rate constant for the movement of cyanocobalamin out of the alveolar space (24 +/- 5 vs. 42 +/- 6 min-1 x 10(-3), P less than 0.01) and tracer appearance in the blood at the end of the study (7 +/- 1 vs. 34 +/- 13%, P less than 0.01) when compared with values in saline controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We found that, if the fluoroscopic axial displacement of the posterior part of the diaphragm between residual volume (RV) and total lung capacity (TLC) is considered equal to 100%, the movement of the middle part is 90%, whereas that of the anterior part is only approximately 60%; the ratio of the axial displacements to mouth volume, furthermore, decreases at high lung volumes, especially for the anterior part. The RIP signal is nearly linearly related to mouth volume, but the contribution of the RC (delta RC) progressively increases (and is approximately 80% RIP at TLC), whereas the volume contribution of the ABD (delta ABD) levels off (to 20% RIP at TLC). The diaphragmatic volume displacement calculated from the theoretical analysis described by Mead and Loring also levels off at high volumes similarly as the ABD but is approximately 50% RIP at TLC. Finally, the axial movements of the three parts of the diaphragm are linearly related to the RC and ABD cross-sectional-area changes (r 0.91-0.97) and are even significantly better correlated with the \"calculated\" diaphragmatic volume displacement.\r"

  ".W": "The tracheobronchial epithelium produces inhibitory substance(s) that alter the tracheal smooth muscle tension. This study examined the effect of changes in extracellular Ca2+ and temperature in vitro on the tension response of rabbit trachealis muscle to mechanical removal of the epithelium. Tension during acetylcholine- and KCl-induced contractions was examined at 0, 0.75, 1.5, 2.5, and 5 mM bath Ca2+ concentrations and at 37, 30, 23, and 41 degrees C bath temperature. At most extracellular Ca2+ concentrations (i.e., 0.75, 1.5, 2.5, and 5 mM), epithelial removal shifted the acetylcholine concentration response approximately one-half log to the left (P less than 0.001 for each condition) but had no effect on the responses to KCl (P = NS). Reductions in bath Ca2+ to 0 mM eliminated the epithelial inhibitory effect on the acetylcholine response. In contrast to the effects of reductions in Ca2+, cooling the airway to 30 and 23 degrees C progressively diminished the magnitude of the epithelial inhibitory effect. Our results indicate that the influence of the tracheal epithelium on tracheal smooth muscle responses to constrictor agonists is substance specific and can be diminished by reductions in tracheal temperature and extracellular Ca2+ concentration.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of the present study was to examine the respiratory motor response to diaphragm fatigue. Studies were performed using in situ diaphragm muscle strips dissected from the left costal diaphragm in anesthetized dogs. The left inferior phrenic artery was isolated, and diaphragmatic strip fatigue was elicited by occluding this vessel. Strip tension, strip electromyographic activity, parasternal electromyographic activity, and the electromyogram of the right hemidiaphragm were recorded during spontaneous breathing efforts before, during, and after periods of phrenic arterial occlusion. In separate trials, we examined the neuromuscular responses to phrenic arterial occlusion at arterial PCO2 (PaCO2) of 40, 55, and 75 Torr. No fatigue and no alteration in electromyographic activities were observed in trials at PaCO2 of 40 Torr. During trials at PaCO2 of 55 and 75 Torr, however, diaphragm tension fell, the peak height of the diaphragm strip electromyogram decreased, and the peak heights of the parasternal and right hemidiaphragm electromyograms increased. Relief of phrenic arterial occlusion resulted in a return of strip tension and all electromyograms toward base-line values. In additional experiments, the left phrenic nerve was sectioned in the chest after producing fatigue. Phrenic section was followed by an increase in the peak height of the left phrenic neurogram (recorded above the site of section). This latter finding suggests that diaphragm strip motor drive may be reflexly inhibited during the development of fatigue by neural traffic carried along phrenic afferents.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effects of left lower lobe (LLL) alveolar hypoxia on pulmonary gas exchange in anesthetized dogs using the multiple inert gas elimination technique (MIGET). The left upper lobe was removed, and a bronchial divider was placed. The right lung (RL) was continuously ventilated with 100% O2, and the LLL was ventilated with either 100% O2 (hyperoxia) or a hypoxic gas mixture (hypoxia). Whole lung and individual LLL and RL ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) distributions were determined. LLL hypoxia reduced LLL blood flow and increased the perfusion-related indexes of VA/Q heterogeneity, such as the log standard deviation of the perfusion distribution (log SDQ), the retention component of the arterial-alveolar difference area [R(a-A)D], and the retention dispersion index (DISPR*) of the LLL. LLL hypoxia increased blood flow to the RL and reduced the VA/Q heterogeneity of the RL, indicated by significant reductions in log SDQ, R(a-A)D, and DISPR*. In contrast, LLL hypoxia had little effect on gas exchange of the lung when evaluated as a whole. We conclude that flow diversion induced by regional alveolar hypoxia preserves matching of ventilation to perfusion in the whole lung by increasing gas exchange heterogeneity of the hypoxic region and reducing heterogeneity in the normoxic lung.\r"

We studied nine tracheostomized infants because separation of the upper from the lower airway allowed us to channel suction created by an occluded inspiratory effort to both upper and lower airways (upper + lower airway occlusions) or to the lower airway only (lower airway occlusion). The tracheostomy airway was briefly occluded at end expiration during quiet sleep. In upper + lower airway occlusions, peak airway pressure of the first occluded breath was less negative and rate of pressure decrease slower than that of lower airway occlusions, indicating that upper airway suction inhibits thoracic inspiratory muscles. The threshold for this response was less than or equal to 4 cmH2O suction pressure. The effect on inspiratory time was variable. A decrease in slope of the inspiratory pressure waveform occurring at approximately 0.12 s after inspiration onset was more marked in upper + lower airway occlusions. We conclude that infants have an upper airway reflex response to inspiratory pressure that alters not only the peak and slope but also the shape of the inspiratory pressure waveform.\r"

Animals were evaluated under four conditions: untrained and endurance-trained with each group subdivided into anemic (animals with reduced hemoglobin concentrations) and control (animals with unchanged hemoglobin concentrations). Anemia was induced by isovolemic plasma exchange transfusion. Hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit were decreased by 38 and 41%, respectively. Whole body VO2max was decreased by 18% by anemia regardless of training condition. Anemia significantly reduced endurance by 78% in untrained rats but only 39% in trained animals. Endurance training resulted in a 10% increase in VO2max, a 75% increase in the distance run to exhaustion, and 35, 45, and 58% increases in skeletal muscle pyruvate-malate, alpha-ketoglutarate, and palmitylcarnitine oxidase activities, respectively. We conclude that endurance is related to the interactive effects of whole body VO2max and muscle oxidative capacities for the following reasons: 1) anemic untrained and trained animals had similar VO2max but trained rats had higher muscle oxidative capacities and greater endurance; 2) regardless of training status, the effect of acute anemia was to decrease VO2max and endurance; and 3) trained anemic rats had lower VO2max but had greater muscle oxidative capacity and greater endurance than untrained controls.\r"

We attempted to understand the physical explanation for these effects, which open up to a wide range of applications in intubated patients. An in vitro study was performed on standard size endotracheal tubes with diameters of 8, 7, and 3 mm and several capillaries molded into the wall (less than 1 mm diam) allowing gas injection at approximately 1-2 cm from the tracheal end of the endotracheal tube. This produced a jet velocity-dependent gain in tracheal pressure (Ptr) during inspiration. Data have been interpreted with a theory, based on the classic momentum theorem, which indicates that the mechanisms involved resemble those of axisymmetrical confined jets: air entrainment by turbulent friction with a longitudinal increase in lateral pressure. The difference with axisymmetrical systems lies in the nonconservation of the total thrust in our system because, secondary to wall friction and to the nonaxial incidence of the jets, only a fraction of the jet momentum flux is transformed into pressure. This suggests faster mixing in the present lateral jet system, as shown by 1) the independence of Ptr on tracheal geometry and 2) the very rapid increase in lateral pressure. The present study supports the idea that pressure changes in the airways, which are potentially beneficial in intubated patients, can be satisfactorily generated by turbulent jets.\r"

  ".W": "Airway hysteresis can be evaluated by comparing maximal (MEFV) and partial (PEFV) expiratory flow-volume curves. The maneuvers are often obtained from pulmonary function systems that are subject to gas-compression artifacts. Because gas-compression artifacts might differentially affect PEFV vs. MEFV curves, we simultaneously obtained MEFV and PEFV curves by use of a spirometer and a volume-displacement plethysmograph (a method not subject to gas-compression artifacts) in normal and asthmatic subjects. Plethysmographic flow rates exceeded spirometric flow rates on all MEFV and PEFV maneuvers. When maximal flow exceeded partial flow (or vice versa) in the plethysmograph, the same result was virtually always observed for spirometric measurements. Alveolar pressure (PA) was higher on MEFV than on PEFV maneuvers in asthmatic subjects; comparisons between PA (on PEFV and MEFV maneuvers) in normal subjects varied at different lung volumes. Ratios of Vmax on PEFV maneuvers to Vmax on MEFV maneuvers (Vmax-p/Vmax-c) obtained from a volume-displacement plethysmograph differ quantitatively from ratios determined in systems subject to gas-compression artifacts; qualitatively, however, failure to account for thoracic gas compression ordinarily will not influence the ability to identify airway hysteresis (or lack thereof) by use of Vmax-p-to-Vmax-c ratios.\r"

During LBNP before ACE-I, both splanchnic and total peripheral vascular resistances increased. During ACE-I, splanchnic and total peripheral vascular resistances decreased. After enalapril administration, splanchnic vascular resistance did not increase during LBNP. Total peripheral vascular resistance still increased but not to the same extent as during LBNP before ACE-I. The increases in heart rate and plasma norepinephrine during LBNP were attenuated after ACE-I compared with LBNP before ACE-I. The effectiveness of the ACE-I was clearly demonstrated by unchanged and low plasma angiotensin II levels during ACE-I. We conclude that, in normal sodium-depleted humans, acute ACE-I decreases splanchnic vascular resistance at rest and abolishes splanchnic vasoconstriction during LBNP. Furthermore, it may interfere with autonomic nervous system control of the circulation.\r"

Ten atopic asthmatic subjects and six atopic normal subjects were studied on 4 study days. On the 1st day, a methacholine inhalation test was performed, followed within 48 h by an AMP inhalation test. Seven days later the second AMP test was performed, and 24 h later the methacholine inhalation test was repeated. Response was measured using partial flow-volume curves, and the concentration required to cause a 40% fall in the partial flow-volume curve (PC40) was calculated. The geometric mean methacholine PC40 fell from 1.36 mg/ml on day 1 (before AMP inhalation) to 0.71 mg/ml on day 4 (24 h after AMP inhalation, P less than 0.01). There was no change in the mean PC40 for adenosine on the 2 study days (5.82 and 7.06 mg/ml, P greater than 0.1). These findings suggest that adenosine release may contribute to the increase in airway responsiveness after allergen challenge.\r"

The pregnant compared with nonpregnant cats had greater room-air ventilation [1.48 +/- 0.24 vs. 0.45 +/- 0.05 (SE) l/min BTPS, P less than 0.01], O2 consumption (29 +/- 2 vs. 19 +/- 1 ml/min STPD, P less than 0.01), and lower end-tidal PCO2 (30 +/- 1 vs. 35 +/- 1 Torr, P less than 0.01). Lower end-tidal CO2 tensions were also observed in seven awake pregnant compared with seven awake nonpregnant cats (28 +/- 1 vs. 31 +/- 1 Torr, P less than 0.05). The ventilatory response to hypoxia as measured by the shape of parameter A was twofold greater (38 +/- 5 vs. 17 +/- 3, P less than 0.01) in the anesthetized pregnant compared with nonpregnant cats, and the CBNO response to hypoxia was also increased twofold (58 +/- 11 vs. 29 +/- 5, P less than 0.05). The increased CBNO response to hypoxia in the pregnant compared with the nonpregnant cats persisted after cutting the carotid sinus nerve while recording from the distal end, indicating that the increased hypoxic sensitivity was not due to descending central neural influences. We concluded that greater carotid body sensitivity to hypoxia contributed to the increased hypoxic ventilatory responsiveness observed in pregnant cats.\r"

In control rats, oleic acid (0.06 ml/kg iv) increased the pulmonary permeability index (measured by scintigraphy) from -10 +/- 13 x 10(-6) s-1 to 217 +/- 20 x 10(-6) s-1 and 118 +/- 13 x 10(-6) s-1 at 5 and 50 min (P less than 0.05), respectively. It also caused arterial hypoxemia at 30 min (P less than 0.05). Compared with saline controls, oleic acid increased bronchoalveolar lavage fluid levels of immunoreactive (i) LTC4/D4, iLTB4, (P less than 0.01), and 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha) (P less than 0.05). In EFAD rats, oleic acid failed to significantly increase the lung permeability index at 5 and 50 min. In contrast to control rats, oleic acid failed to cause hypoxemia in the EFAD rats. Bronchoalveolar lavage levels of iLTB4 and i6-keto-PGF1 alpha after oleic acid in EFAD rats were lower compared with oleic acid controls, whereas iLTC4/D4 in the oleic acid EFAD group was not decreased. Treatment with intraperitoneal ethyl arachidonate (400 mg over 2 wk) reversed the resistance of EFAD rats such that the pulmonary edema (P less than 0.05) was evident after oleic acid. This latter group also manifested a significant (P less than 0.05) rise in the bronchoalveolar lavage levels of iLTB4 and i6-keto-PGF1 alpha. These results suggest that arachidonic acid metabolites contribute to oleic acid-induced pulmonary permeability.\r"

Secretion of macromolecules (radiolabeled with 35SO4 and [3H]-threonine), unidirectional fluxes of Cl-, Na+, and water (measured with radioactive tracers), and ciliary beat frequency (CBF) were measured in tracheal tissues in vitro. Tracheal mucus transport velocity (TMV) was measured in vivo. Sheep were studied at 0, 2, 4, 8, and greater than 24 (adult) wk after birth. In newborn sheep trachea, secretion of macromolecules was significantly elevated (cf. adults), and there was basal net secretion of Cl- under short-circuit and open-circuit conditions. This induced open-circuit secretion of Na+. Secretion of macromolecules decreased rapidly by 2 wk (by 40-50%) and was not different from adult values by 4 wk. Active Na+ absorption developed rapidly, and from 2 wk onward it predominated under open-circuit conditions, inducing net Cl- absorption. These changes in secretory function were associated with an age-related increase in TMV, whereas inherent tracheal CBF was unchanged. In sheep, therefore, the newborn's trachea has elevated secretion of macromolecules and secretes Cl- and liquid under basal conditions. Normal secretory function (a reduction in secretion of macromolecules coupled with net absorption of ions and presumably of liquid also) approaches adult function by 2-4 wk of age.\r"

To evaluate the pathophysiological importance of this observation, we investigated the effects of surgical peripheral chemoreceptor denervation on pulmonary vascular tone and gas exchange in 17 pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs with oleic acid pulmonary edema. Pulmonary arterial pressure-cardiac index (Ppa/Q) plots, blood gases, and intrapulmonary shunt measured by the SF6 method were obtained at base line, after peripheral chemodenervation (n = 9) or after sham operation (n = 8), and again after 0.09 ml.kg-1 intravenous oleic acid. Over the range of Q studied (2-5 l.min-1.m-2), Ppa/Q plots were best fitted as first-order polynomials in most dogs in all experimental conditions. Chemoreceptor denervation increased Ppa at the lowest Q, while sham operation did not affect the Ppa/Q plots. Oleic acid increased Ppa over the entire range of Q and increased intrapulmonary shunt. This latter was measured at identical Q during the construction of the Ppa/Q plots. Chemoreceptor-denervated dogs, compared with sham-operated dogs, had the same pulmonary hypertension but lower intrapulmonary shunt (36 +/- 4 vs. 48 +/- 5%, means +/- SE, P less than 0.04) and venous admixture (43 +/- 4 vs. 54 +/- 3%, P less than 0.02). We conclude that in intact dogs chemoreceptor denervation attenuates the rise in intrapulmonary shunt after oleic acid lung injury. Whether this improvement in gas exchange is related to an enhanced hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is uncertain.\r"

Then we recorded interstitial pressures by micropuncture at alveolar junctions (Pjct), in perimicrovascular adventitia (Padv), and at the hilum (Phil). After base-line measurements, we ventilated the lobes with dry gas to decrease extravascular lung water content by 14 +/- 5%. In one group (n = 10), at constant inflation pressure of 7 cmH2O, Pjct was 0.2 +/- 0.8 and Padv was -1.5 +/- 0.6 cmH2O. After dehydration the pressures fell to -5.0 +/- 1.0 and -5.3 +/- 1.3 cmH2O, respectively (P less than 0.01), and the junction-to-advential gradient (Pjct-Padv) was abolished. In a second group (n = 6) a combination of dehydration and lung expansion with inflation pressure of 15 cmH2O further decreased Pjct and Padv to -7.3 +/- 0.7 and -7.1 +/- 0.7 cmH2O, respectively. Phil followed changes in Padv. Interstitial compliance was 0.6 at the junctions, 0.8 in adventitia, and 0.9 ml.cmH2O-1.100 g-1 wet lung at the hilum. We conclude, that perialveolar interstitial pressures may provide an important mechanism for prevention of lung dehydration.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated whether stimulation of vagal afferent nerve fibers with inhaled capsaicin could induce a nonadrenergic inhibitory reflex in nine mild asthmatic subjects. Changes in total respiratory resistance (Rrs) were measured with a forced oscillation technique. First we induced a rise of 71 +/- 15% in Rrs (P less than 0.001) after leukotriene D4 aerosol. Subsequent inhalation of capsaicin (2 nmol) caused no significant change in mean Rrs of -1.1 +/- 8.2%. After the muscarinic receptor antagonist ipratropium bromide (120 micrograms) was inhaled, leukotriene D4 increased Rrs by 103 +/- 9% (P less than 0.001). Capsaicin subsequently caused bronchodilation in all subjects (Rrs = -22.3 +/- 2.7%, P less than 0.001). Ethanol-saline (diluent) alone caused a nonsignificant fall in Rrs (-9.9 +/- 4.7%) but a deep breath and coughing resulted in bronchodilation (-16.9 +/- 6.1%, P less than 0.05 and -11.6 +/- 2.9%, P less than 0.01, respectively). As observed in normal subjects, capsaicin may initiate an inhibitory reflex, presumably of nonadrenergic origin. This reflex could not be distinguished from that caused by coughing or by deep inhalation. A defect in nonadrenergic mechanisms, at least in mild asthma, seems unlikely.\r"

  ".W": "This study investigated mechanisms used by horses and steers to increase O2 uptake and delivery (VO2) from resting to maximal rates and identified the mechanisms that enable horses to achieve higher maximal rates of O2 consumption (VO2max) than steers. VO2 and circulatory variables were measured while Standardbred trotting horses and steers (450-kg body mass) stood quietly and ran on a treadmill at speeds up to those eliciting VO2max. As VO2 increased in both species, heart rate and circulating hemoglobin (Hb) concentration increased, thereby increasing O2 delivery by the circulation, while cardiac stroke volume remained unchanged. At VO2max arterial PCO2 increased from its resting value in horses but was unchanged in steers, and arterial PO2 decreased in both species. Although the horses hypoventilated and were hypoxemic at VO2max, no significant decrease in arterial Hb saturation occurred. VO2max of the horses was 2.6 times higher than that of the steers and was associated with a 100% larger cardiac output, 100% larger stroke volume, and 40% higher Hb concentration, whereas heart rates at VO2max were identical in the two species. The higher cardiac output of the horses at VO2max resulted from a 1.2-fold higher mean arterial pressure and 1.6-fold lower peripheral tissue resistance (associated with a larger skeletal muscle capillary bed). Both the magnitude of the difference in VO2max between horses and steers and the mechanisms used to achieve it are the same as observed in smaller pairs of mammalian species with large variation in aerobic capacity.\r"

Three Standardbred racehorses [body mass (Mb) = 447 kg] and three domestic steers (Mb = 474 kg) whose cardiovascular function at VO2max had been thoroughly studied (Jones et al. J. Appl. Physiol. 67: 862-870, 1989) were used to study their lungs by morphometry. The basic morphometric parameters were similar in both species. The nearly 2 times larger lung volumes of the horses caused the gas exchange surfaces and capillary blood volume to be 1.6 to 1.8 times larger. Morphometric pulmonary diffusing capacity was 2 times larger in the horse than in the steer; the 2.6-fold greater rate of O2 uptake thus required the alveolar-capillary PO2 difference to be 1.3 times larger in the horse than in the steer. Combining physiological and morphometric data, we calculated capillary transit time at VO2max to be 0.4-0.5 s. Bohr integration showed capillary blood to be equilibrated with alveolar air after 75 and 58% of transit time in horses and steers, respectively; horses maintain a smaller degree of redundancy in their pulmonary gas exchanger.\r"

Horses and steers weighing 450 kg were run on a treadmill at speeds up to those eliciting maximal rates of O2 consumption (VO2max), and temperatures were measured in various body compartments. In both species Tpa rose faster than Tre during the run, the degree of dissociation being a function of exercise intensity and duration. Tm was measured only in horses, and it rose faster than Tpa during the run and decreased more slowly postrun. Correcting blood gas values measured at an analyzer temperature of 37 degrees C to Tre without accounting for transient increases during the run of Tpa and Tm that were never reflected in Tre significantly biased estimates of blood gases. The biased estimates erroneously indicated that both species experienced more severe hypoxemia than they actually did at VO2max and masked the hypercapnia experienced by the horses at VO2max.\r"

Two opposing views with competing data models recently published in this journal are criticized. One view suggests a segmented model with a discontinuous first derivative at the threshold. The other suggests a continuous model over the whole work load range, implying the anaerobic threshold to be imaginary. However, neither group of authors has devoted proper rigorous attention to the models they use. Had this been done, some of the divergence of opinion may have been avoided. Ideal data from an alternate segmented model that has a continuous first derivative at the threshold are considered for comparative purposes. This suggests that the log-log transformation method may well lead to improved detection of a threshold when one exists, although the estimates of the threshold value obtained are unreliable. Modeling methodology is a useful approach to the resolution of scientific issues, but there exist fundamental implications and alternatives that must be fully recognized.\r"

The fidelity of Pes as a measurement of Ppl is determined by the occlusion test in which, during respiratory efforts against an occlusion at the airway opening, changes in pressure (delta Pao) (Pao is assumed to be equal to alveolar pressure) are shown to be equal to changes in Pes (delta Pes). Eight intubated premature infants (640-3,700 g) with chest wall distortion were studied using a water-filled catheter system to measure Pes. During the occlusion test, all patients had a finite region of the esophagus where delta Pes equaled delta Pao, which corresponded to points in the esophagus above the cardia but below the carina. In conclusion, even in the presence of chest wall distortion, a liquid-filled catheter with the tip between the cardia and carina can provide an accurate measurement of Ppl, even in the very small premature infant with chest wall distortion.\r"

Before and after training the EXP and CON groups participated in LBNP tolerance tests (terminated at presyncope) and neck pressure-suction testing (to describe the carotid sinus-heart rate baroreflex). LBNP tolerance, as defined by three different indexes, and carotid sinus-heart rate baroreflex gain were not altered in either group after training. Furthermore, there were no changes in LBNP heart rate, blood pressure, leg circumference, forearm blood flow, or forearm vascular resistance responses at any level of LBNP challenge after training. In conclusion, 10 wk of aerobic training did not change LBNP tolerance or alter the reflex cardiovascular compensatory mechanisms activated during LBNP.\r"

We have developed a synthetic smoke composed of aerosolized charcoal particles to which one toxin at a time can be added to determine whether it produces pulmonary edema. Acrolein, a common component of smoke, when added to the synthetic smoke, produced a delayed-onset pulmonary edema in dogs in which the extravascular lung water (EVLW) as detected by a double-indicator technique began to rise after 42 +/- 2 (SE) min from 148 +/- 16 to 376 +/- 60 ml at 165 min after smoke exposure. The resulting pulmonary edema was widespread macroscopically but appeared focal microscopically with fibrin deposits in alveoli adjacent to small bronchi and bronchioles. Bronchial vessels were markedly dilated and congested. Monastral blue B when injected intravenously leaked into the walls of the bronchial vessels down to the region of the small bronchioles (less than or equal to 0.5 mm ID) of acrolein-smoke-exposed dogs but not into the pulmonary vessels. Furthermore, ligation of the bronchial arteries delayed the onset of pulmonary edema (87 +/- 3 min, P less than 0.05) and lessened the magnitude (232 +/- 30 ml, P less than 0.05) at 166 +/- 3 min after acrolein-smoke exposure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Pulmonary function testing was performed, and biochemical indicators of lung injury were analyzed from tracheobronchial aspirates at 0, 24, and 48 h. Lung sections were obtained for light and electron microscopy, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was analyzed for surfactant composition and activity. At 24 h significant changes in tracheobronchial aspirate albumin concentrations (up 78%) and percent of polymorphonuclear cells (up 16%) were demonstrated. At 48 h a 35% decrease in dynamic lung compliance (P less than 0.05) and a 36% increase in pulmonary resistance (P less than 0.05) were noted. Further biochemical abnormalities occurred with total cell counts increased by 271% (P less than 0.02), albumin 163% (P less than 0.05), total protein 217% (P less than 0.01), and elastase 108% (P less than 0.02). Pathological analyses revealed mild lung injury at 24 h and marked inflammation, abnormal inflation patterns, flattening of Clara cells, fibrinous exudate and edema, early collagen formation, and cell necrosis observed at 48 h. Bronchoalveolar lavage surfactant had normal biophysical activity. Results demonstrate that exposure of neonatal piglets to O2 and mechanical hyperventilation for 48 h cause severe progressive lung injury.\r"

The expiratory pressure was altered between 3 and -12 cmH2O for single tidal expirations. Isovolume pressure-flow plots for three lung volumes showed that the resistive pressure-flow relationships were curvilinear in all cases, fitting Rohrer's equation: P = K1V + K2V2, where P is the resistive pressure loss, K1 and K2 are Rohrer's coefficients, and V is flow. Values of K1 and K2 declined with lung inflation, consistent with the volume dependence of pulmonary (RL) and respiratory system resistances (Rrs). During lung deflation against atmospheric pressure, RL and Rrs tended to remain constant through most of expiration, resulting in a nearly linear volume-flow relationship. In the presence of a fixed respiratory system elastance, the shape of the volume-flow profile depended on the balance between the volume and the flow dependence of RL and Rrs. However, the flow dependence of RL and Rrs indicates that their measured values will be affected by all factors that modify expiratory flow, e.g., respiratory system elastance, equipment resistance, and the presence of respiratory muscle activity.\r"

Ers comprised approximately 66% of effective elastance (E*rs) in both groups. E'rs, reflecting the role of the force-length properties of the active inspiratory muscles in increasing the internal impedance, comprised 83.8 and 86.1% of E*rs in the kyphoscoliosis patients and controls, respectively (P less than 0.001). This demonstrates the influence of increased intrinsic elastance and resistance and decreased TI on tidal volume defense in kyphoscoliosis patients in the absence of vagal modulation. In some patients the difference between Ers and E*rs was substantial, despite an unchanged or even shortened TI, suggesting that the Hering-Breuer reflex may affect stability through ways other than altering TI (e.g., via graded volume-dependent \"terminal inhibition\"). Characteristics of elastic load compensation in anesthetized kyphoscoliosis patients are similar to those of anesthetized normal subjects.\r"

We measured mean transit time (t), uptake, and metabolism by injecting 3H-labeled substrates with [14C]sucrose into the bronchial artery of sheep lungs stripped clean of parenchymal tissue. After [3H]BPAP the t for 3H was the same as for 14C. Thirty-six percent of the injected BPAP was converted to metabolite ([3H]benzoyl-Phe) in a single pass. An inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, SQ 20,881, depressed BPAP metabolism by 50%, while perfusion of the bronchial circulation with glutaraldehyde reduced metabolism to a basal level. After [3H]ADP the t for 3H was again the same as for 14C. 3H recovery after 40 pmol [3H]ADP was less (58%) than after 400 nmol [3H]ADP (79%). Twenty-two percent of the injected radioactivity emerged in the effluent as metabolites of ADP for either dose. Adenosine and PGE2 uptake was negligible, and most of the recovered radioactivity in each case was unchanged substrate. This study suggests that the bronchial circulation is pharmacokinetically and metabolically active with respect to vasoactive mediators like angiotensin I, bradykinin, and adenine nucleotides, and that the enzymes responsible for this metabolic activity line the vascular lumen.\r"

The alternate diet was given the following week. Ventilation and gas exchange were measured during supine cycle ergometry at 0, 12, and 25 W during the D5W, CB, and FB diet periods. At each exercise intensity, the EMPH group demonstrated a 12-15% greater O2 consumption, a lower respiratory quotient, and an O2 debt larger than that of the MALN group. Resting ventilation was higher during the CB than FB regimen in both groups of patients, but during the CB diet the EMPH group had a more exaggerated ventilatory response than the MALN group. The results demonstrate that EMPH patients have an unusual metabolic pattern during hypercaloric feeding and exercise. Furthermore in EMPH patients a FB regimen does not appear to create the additional stress on the respiratory system during exercise that is generated with a CB regimen.\r"

  ".W": "Whole muscles loaded to failure frequently fail at or near myotendinous junctions. The present investigation was directed toward determining the breaking stress and failure site of intact and injured myotendinous junction preparations consisting of muscle cells dissected free from surrounding parallel structures but still attached to tendon collagen fibers. These tests show that the breaking stress for intact myotendinous units is 2.7 x 10(5) N/m2, expressed relative to cell cross-sectional area. Failure occurs immediately external to the junction membrane between the cell membrane and lamina densa of the basement membrane. Site and stress at failure are independent of strain and strain rate over a biologically relevant range. Breaking stress in the plane of the membrane, corrected for membrane folding, is 1.2 X 10(4) N/m2. This value is not significantly greater than stress at maximum isometric tension for these cells at these sarcomere lengths. After compression injury, cells fail within the compression site at significantly lower stress (1.9 X 10(5) N/m2). These findings suggest that, in muscle strain injuries that occur under conditions simulated here, failure occurs at myotendinous junctions unless the muscle has suffered previous compression injury leading to failure within the muscle.\r"

  ".W": "Anesthetized mechanically ventilated rabbits were subjected to progressive hypoxemia (n = 7) to determine the relationship of venous PO2 (PvO2) to skeletal muscle PO2 (PtiO2). Measures of arterial PO2 (PaO2), right atrial PO2 [(PvO2)RA], and hindlimb PO2 [(PvO2)limb], were obtained from the carotid artery, right atrium, and inferior vena cava, just above the level of the iliac bifurcation. Biceps femoris muscle PtiO2 was measured with a surface O2 microelectrode having eight measuring points. PaO2 was decreased from 90.3 +/- 5.4 to 26.8 +/- 0.8 Torr in five consecutive steps, followed by reoxygenation to 105.6 +/- 10.5 (SE) Torr. Measurements were obtained after each decrement in PaO2. A total of 128 measures of PtiO2 were obtained per experimental stage. The mean and distribution of the muscle PtiO2 histogram were determined. Measurements were compared with analysis of variance and the Newman-Keuls post hoc method. (PvO2)limb had similar values as the average muscle PtiO2 (PtiO2) for PaO2 values greater than 52.1 +/- 4.3 Torr, where (PvO2)limb became greater than PtiO2 (P less than 0.05). The lowest measures of (PvO2)limb and PtiO2 were 15.9 +/- 0.7 and 4.0 +/- 0.1 Torr, respectively (P less than 0.01). The PtiO2 histograms showed no evidence of increased microvascular heterogeneity with hypoxemia. We conclude that in hypoxemia PvO2 is greater than muscle PtiO2. This difference may be related to the establishment of significant physicochemical O2 gradients from erythrocyte to tissue cell.\r"

Twenty were nationally ranked water polo players, 19 were engaged in weight-training programs, and 20 subjects comprised a nonexercising comparison group. All participants had measurements of spinal trabecular and integral bone density by quantitative computed tomography as well as a determination of hip bone density by dual photon absorptiometry. A series of potential predictor variables included maximal O2 uptake, back strength, leg strength, total kilocalories expended per day, body mass index, paraspinous muscle cross-sectional area, percent body fat, daily calcium intake, and age. We found no significant differences for any of the bone density measures between the two groups of athletic subjects, whereas bone density was generally significantly lower among the nonexercisers compared with either exercise group. Correlation analysis found only weak and somewhat inconsistent relationships when each of the subgroups was examined separately; however, when all subjects were assessed collectively, many more correlations reached significance. Paraspinous muscular area was found to be most robust in this regard, being significantly correlated with all three bone density measures (r = 0.33-0.55). By using step-wise regression analysis in each subgroup, we observed a consistent significant contribution (R2 = 0.18-0.44) of paraspinous muscle area to the variability in bone density at the spine and the hip. When the data of all three subgroups were pooled, regression analysis reconfirmed the importance of the muscle parameter (R2 = 0.06-0.27) to bone density variation, but more importantly it showed that differentiation based on exercise status was most significant (R2 = 0.18-0.22).\r"

We have previously shown that lesions in the rostral lateral pons change the depressive response to hypoxia to one of stimulation. We now present evidence that lesions in this area also affect the fetal response to H+/CO2. Lactic acidemia and 5-6% hypercapnia both caused almost continuous breathing throughout both HV and low-voltage (LV) ECOG in seven of eight fetuses with lesions that reversed the depressive response to hypoxia. In five intact control fetuses and seven fetuses with lesions that did not affect the response to hypoxia, neither CO2 nor lactic acidemia induced continuous breathing. We conclude that the lateral pontine area, which is involved in the hypoxic depression of breathing in the fetus, is also involved in the inhibitory mechanisms operating during HV ECOG. Furthermore the inhibition of breathing during HV ECOG appears to be related to a raised threshold for fetal breathing, which is sensitive to H+/CO2.\r"

  ".W": "Arterial desaturation in athletes during intense exercise has been reported by several authors, yet the etiology of this phenomenon remains obscure. Inadequate pulmonary ventilation, due to a blunted respiratory drive, has been implicated as a factor. To investigate the relationship between the ventilatory response to hypoxia, exercise ventilation, and arterial desaturation, 12 healthy male subjects [age, 23.8 +/- 3.6 yr; height, 181.6 +/- 5.6 cm; weight, 73.7 +/- 6.2 kg; and maximal O2 uptake (VO2max), 63.0 +/- 2.2 ml.kg-1 min-1] performed a 5-min treadmill test at 100% of VO2max, during which arterial blood samples and ventilatory data were collected every 15 s. Alveolar PO2 (PAO2) was determined using the ideal gas equation. On a separate occasion the ventilatory response to isocapnic hypoxia was measured. Arterial PO2 decreased by an average of 29 Torr during the test, associated with arterial desaturation [arterial O2 saturation (SaO2) 92.0%]. PAO2 was maintained; however, alveolar-arterial gas pressure difference increased progressively to greater than 40 Torr. Minimal hypocapnia was observed, despite marked metabolic acidosis. There was no significant correlation observed between hypoxic drives and ventilation-to-O2 uptake ratio or SaO2 (r = 0.1 and 0.06, respectively, P = NS). These data support the conclusions that hypoxic drives are not related to maximal exercise ventilation or to the development of arterial desaturation during maximal exercise.\r"

  ".U": "90008571\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously reported that airway hyperresponsiveness to acetylcholine (ACh) is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait in A/J and C3H/HeJ mice and the progeny of crosses between them (FASEB J. 2: 2605-2608, 1988). In the present report, we have extended these studies by evaluating the biological variability in the airway response to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and ACh among multiple genetically standardized inbred strains of mice. The pattern of airway responsiveness to ACh differed significantly from that of 5-HT in nine inbred strains of mice. A/J mice showed nonspecific airway hyperresponsiveness to both 5-HT and ACh. DBA/2J mice were hyperresponsive to 5-HT but not to ACh. An airway phenotype that resembled these inbred strains is termed HYPERREACTIVE. The C3H/HeJ and C57BL/6J inbred strains were minimally reactive to either ACh or 5-HT. Airway phenotypes that resembled these minimally reactive strains are termed HYPOREACTIVE. The frequency of HYPERRACTIVE and HYPOREACTIVE offspring from crosses between A/J and C3H/HeJ mice or DBA/2J and C57BL/6J mice is consistent with a single autosomal recessive gene, primarily determining airway hyperresponsiveness to 5-HT. We report linkage studies which suggest that these genes are not closely linked and that 5-HT and ACh airway hyperresponsiveness is inherited independently. The results of these studies suggest that murine nonspecific airway hyperresponsiveness is determined by multiple genes.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that the development of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) lasting greater than or equal to 3 days after the last antigenic exposure required repeated mediator release, we compared dose-response changes in lung resistance (RL) to acetylcholine (ACh) in animals sensitized with 1% ovalbumin (OA), 4% Bordatella pertussis aerosol and subsequently challenged with 0.5% OA aerosol twice weekly for 4-6 wk vs. animals receiving saline aerosol instead of OA. Despite antihistamine pretreatment, each OA challenge produced cyanosis and inspiratory indrawing. Blood gas analysis in six guinea pigs revealed an immediate fall in arterial PO2 (PaO2) from 104.3 +/- 4.9 to 35.4 +/- 2.2 Torr after a 1-min exposure to aerosolized OA. ACh dose-response measurements of RL 3 days after the last OA challenge demonstrated a leftward shift and an increased magnitude of response. These differences were less marked at 7 days, and by 14 days after the last OA challenge, ACh dose-response curves were not different from those of control guinea pigs. Sensitization without repeated antigen challenge did not cause hyperresponsiveness. Morphometric analysis showed significantly increased numbers of eosinophils in the epithelium of airways in hyperresponsive guinea pigs, without neutrophil infiltration or alterations in epithelium and airway wall areas. We conclude that repeated antigenic challenge, but not sensitization alone, causes prolonged AHR in guinea pigs, which is associated with tissue eosinophilia.\r"

  ".W": "In 10 normal young adults, ventilation was evaluated with and without pretreatment with aminophylline, an adenosine blocker, while they breathed pure O2 1) after breathing room air and 2) after 25 min of isocapnic hypoxia (arterial O2 saturation 80%). With and without aminophylline, 5 min of hyperoxia significantly increased inspiratory minute ventilation (VI) from the normoxic base line. In control experiments, with hypoxia, VI initially increased and then declined to levels that were slightly above the normoxic base line. Pretreatment with aminophylline significantly attenuated the hypoxic ventilatory decline. During transitions to pure O2 (cessation of carotid bodies' output), VI and breathing patterns were analyzed breath by breath with a moving-average technique, searching for nadirs before and after hyperoxia. On placebo days, at the end of hypoxia, hyperoxia produced nadirs that were significantly lower than those observed with room-air breathing and also significantly lower than when hyperoxia followed normoxia, averaging, respectively, 6.41 +/- 0.52, 8.07 +/- 0.32, and 8.04 +/- 0.39 (SE) l/min. This hypoxic depression was due to significant decrease in tidal volume and prolongation of expiratory time. Aminophylline partly prevented these alterations in breathing pattern; significant posthypoxic ventilatory depression was not observed. We conclude that aminophylline attenuated hypoxic central depression of ventilation, although it does not affect hyperoxic steady-state hyperventilation. Adenosine may play a modulatory role in hypoxic but not in hyperoxic ventilation.\r"

To study the effects of selective stimulation of PC on the ventilatory response pattern to hypoxia, the VRSH was evaluated after pretreatment with almitrine (A), a PC stimulant. Eight subjects were pretreated with A (75 mg po) or placebo (P) on 2 days in a single-blind manner. Two hours after drug administration, they breathed, in succession, room air (10 min), O2 (5 min), room air (5 min), hypoxia [25 min, arterial O2 saturation (SaO2) = 80%], O2 (5 min), and room air (5 min). End-tidal CO2 was kept constant at the normoxic base-line values. Inspiratory minute ventilation (VI) and breathing patterns were measured over the last 2 min of each period and during minutes 3-5 of hypoxia, and nadirs in VI were assessed just before and after O2 exposure. Independent of the day, the VRSH was biphasic. With P and A pretreatment, early hypoxia increased VI 4.6 +/- 1 and 14.2 +/- 1 (SE) l/min, respectively, from values obtained during the preceding room-air period. On A day the hypoxic ventilatory decline was significantly larger than that on P day, and on both days the decline was a constant fraction of the acute hypoxic response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At 26 wk of age the postpneumonectomy dogs had total lung vital capacity (VC) and lung weight similar to controls, but maximum expiratory flow was reduced. Pressure capsules were glued to right lower (RLL) and right cardiac (RCL) lobes, and alveolar pressures (PA) were measured during forced expiration. In postpneumonectomy dogs RLL and RCL both emptied more slowly than in control dogs, and emptying was especially delayed in RCL, which underwent the most growth. When both lobes deflated together, PA in RCL and RLL were similar in control dogs, but in postpneumonectomy dogs PA in RCL exceeded that in RLL by approximately 3 cmH2O from 80 to 20% VC. Because the higher driving pressure in RCL compensated for the relatively high resistance of RCL, the pattern of lobar emptying was relatively uniform over these lung volumes. This result was compatible with interdependence of lobar maximum expiratory flows. In addition, at PA of 6-10 cmH2O in postpneumonectomy dogs, maximum emptying rates of RCL were less when RCL deflated alone than when RCL and RLL emptied together, again demonstrating interdependence of lobar maximum expiratory flow.\r"

Activities of the whole RLN and phrenic nerve were also recorded. Nerve activities were assessed at several steady-state end-tidal O2 and CO2 concentrations. The nerve to the thyroarytenoid (TA) muscle, a vocal cord adductor, was only slightly active under base-line (normocapnic, hyperoxic) conditions but in most cats developed strong activity during expiration in hypocapnia or hypoxia. In severe hypocapnia, phasic expiratory TA activity persisted even during phrenic apnea, indicating continuing activity of the respiratory rhythm generator. The nerve to the posterior cricoarytenoid (PCA) muscle, the vocal cord abductor, was always active in inspiration but often showed expiratory activity as well. This expiratory activity was usually enhanced by hypercapnia and often inhibited by hypoxia. The results are consistent with previous electromyographic findings and emphasize the importance of distinguishing abductor from adductor activity in studies of laryngeal control.\r"

Records were made of the activities of the phrenic nerve, the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN), the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN), and the intralaryngeal branches of the RLN serving the thyroarytenoid (TA) and posterior cricoarytenoid (PCA) muscles. Neural activities were assessed in the steady state at different end-tidal O2 and CO2 concentrations. Transient responses to withholding inspiratory lung inflation and to preventing expiratory lung emptying were also studied. Hypercapnia and hypoxia increased the inspiratory activities of the phrenic nerve, SLN, RLN, and its PCA branch. TA inspiratory activity was not changed. Expiratory activities of RLN, PCA, and TA were all increased in hypoxia. When lung inflation was withheld, neural inspiratory duration and the inspiratory activities of all nerves increased. The subsequent period of neural expiration was marked by an exaggerated burst of activity by the TA branch of the RLN. TA expiratory activity was also sharply increased after inspiratory efforts that were reflexly delayed by the prevention of lung emptying. TA activity in expiration was enhanced after vagotomy and was usually more prominent than when lung inflation was withheld before vagal section. The results demonstrate the importance and complexity of the influence of vagal afferents on laryngeal motor activity.\r"

  ".W": "The syndrome of neurogenic pulmonary edema raises the question of whether there are neurological influences on pulmonary vascular permeability. Previous experimental models commonly produced severe hemodynamic alterations, complicating the distinction of increased permeability from increased hydrostatic forces in the formation of the pulmonary edema. Accordingly, we employed a milder central nervous system insult and measured the pulmonary vascular protein extravasation rate, which is a sensitive and specific indicator of altered protein permeability. After elevating intracranial pressure via cisternal saline infusion in anesthetized dogs, we used a dual isotope method to measure the protein leak index. This elevated intracranial pressure resulted in a nearly three-fold rise in the protein leak index (54.1 +/- 7.5 vs. 20.2 +/- 0.9). This central nervous system insult was associated with only mild increases in pulmonary arterial pressures and cardiac output. However, when we reproduced these hemodynamic changes with left atrial balloon inflation or isoproterenol infusion, we observed no effect on the protein leak index compared with control. Although the pulmonary arterial wedge pressure with intracranial pressure remained <10 mmHg, increases in the extravascular lung water were demonstrated. The results suggest the existence of neurological influences on pulmonary vascular protein permeability. We conclude that neurological insults result in increase pulmonary vascular permeability to protein and subsequent edema formation, which could not be accounted for by hemodynamic changes alone.\r"

Flow was measured with a pneumotachograph attached to a face mask and integrated to yield volume. Volume changes were confirmed by respiratory inductance plethysmography. Crs measured by EVC was compared with Crs during tidal breathing determined by the passive flow-volume (PFV) technique. Volume increases of approximately 75% VT were achieved with three to eight inspiratory efforts during expiratory occlusions. Crs above VT was consistently greater than during tidal breathing (P less than 0.0005). This increase in Crs likely reflects recruitment of lung units that are closed or atelectatic in the VT range. Within the VT range, Crs measured by PFV was compared with that obtained by the multiple-occlusion method (MO). PFV yielded greater values of Crs than MO (P less than 0.01). This may be due to braking of expiratory airflow after the release of an occlusion or nonlinearity of Crs. Thus both volume recruitment and airflow retardation may affect the measurement of Crs in unsedated newborn infants.\r"

The 12 delta Tes values were averaged for each individual and were compared using analysis of variance. The average delta Tes for RF (1.15 +/- 0.22 degrees C/h) was faster (P less than 0.001) than either IC (0.37 +/- 0.16 degrees C/h) or HW (0.18 +/- 0.09 degree C/h). The present study shows the superiority of RF energy for rewarming mildly hypothermic men.\r"

  ".W": "After interruption of a constant flow (Vcoll) delivered through a bronchoscope into a wedged segment of lung, the pressure at the tip of the bronchoscope (Pb) often decays in a pattern seemingly indicative of two time constants. We tested the hypothesis that the initial more rapid component of the decay is associated with pressure equilibration across the bronchial resistance (Rb), separating bronchoscope tip from alveolus, and that the slower component is associated with pressure equilibration across the collateral pathways separating the wedged segment from surrounding regions. In eight open-chest mongrel dogs, we affixed an alveolar capsule to the segment subtended by the wedged bronchoscope and measured alveolar pressure (PA) and Pb during delivery of Vcoll into the segment and after its sudden interruption. Under both control conditions and after delivery of aerosolized histamine (1.0 or 10 mg/ml), we were unable to demonstrate a gradient between Pb and PA either during constant flow or after flow interruption. Whenever the decay of Pb was not monoexponential, neither was that of PA. Thus there was no evidence of an appreciable Rb, and the rapid component of the decay must be attributable to other factors. In a second protocol, we examined whether behavior departing from monoexponential decay was attributable to the presence of multicompartment behavior within the wedged segment or rather reflected the behavior of a single homogeneous but nonlinear compartment. In five closed-chest dogs, we systematically varied the initial Pb by changing Vcoll and recorded nonexponential pressure decay after flow interruption.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We compared the histamine responsiveness of canine airways and parenchymal tissues in six anesthetized paralyzed open-chest mongrel dogs, partitioning total lung resistance (RL) into airway resistance (Raw) and tissue viscance (Vti). Pressure was measured during tidal breathing (frequency was 0.3 Hz) at the trachea and in three alveolar regions by use of alveolar capsules. Measurements were taken before and after the delivery of increasing concentrations of aerosolized histamine (0.1-30 mg/ml). We found that Vti accounted for 78 +/- 8% of RL under base-line conditions; this proportion remained relatively constant throughout the histamine concentration-response curve. There was a significant correlation between percent change in Vti and percent change in Raw at all levels of histamine-induced constriction (P less than 0.001). Moreover, the sensitivity of the tissues and airways (defined as the concentration of histamine required to double resistance) was remarkably similar. We conclude that, at this frequency of ventilation, Vti accounts for the major portion of RL both under base-line conditions and after histamine-induced constriction. Although increases in RL cannot be attributed solely to events occurring in the airways, the close correlation between changes in Raw and Vti and the similar sensitivities of the two support the use of indexes reflecting changes in airway caliber as an indicator of overall lung histamine responsiveness.\r"

  ".U": "90008586\r", 
  ".W": "Normally, tissue O2 uptake (VO2) is set by metabolic activity rather than O2 delivery (QO2 = blood flow X arterial O2 content). However, when QO2 is reduced below a critical level, VO2 becomes limited by O2 supply. Experiments have shown that a similar critical QO2 exists, regardless of whether O2 supply is reduced by progressive anemia, hypoxemia, or reduction in blood flow. This appears inconsistent with the hypothesis that O2 supply limitation must occur by diffusion limitation, since very different mixed venous PO2 values have been seen at the critical point with hypoxic vs. anemic hypoxia. The present study sought to begin clarifying this paradox by studying the theoretical relationship between tissue O2 supply and uptake in the Krogh tissue cylinder model. Steady-state O2 uptake was computed as O2 delivery to tissue representative of whole body was gradually lowered by anemic, hypoxic, or stagnant hypoxia. As diffusion began to limit uptake, the fall in VO2 was computed numerically, yielding a relationship between QO2 and VO2 in both supply-independent and O2 supply-dependent regions. This analysis predicted a similar biphasic relationship between QO2 and VO2 and a linear fall in VO2 at O2 deliveries below a critical point for all three forms of hypoxia, as long as intercapillary distances were less than or equal to 80 microns. However, the analysis also predicted that O2 extraction at the critical point should exceed 90%, whereas real tissues typically extract only 65-75% at that point. When intercapillary distances were larger than approximately 80 microns, critical O2 extraction ratios in the range of 65-75% could be predicted, but the critical point became highly sensitive to the type of hypoxia imposed, contrary to experimental findings. Predicted gas exchange in accord with real data could only be simulated when a postulated 30% functional peripheral O2 shunt (arterial admixture) was combined with a tissue composed of Krogh cylinders with intercapillary distances of less than or equal to 80 microns. The unrealistic efficacy of tissue O2 extraction predicted by the Krogh model (in the absence of postulated shunt) may be a consequence of the assumed homogeneity of tissues, because real tissues exhibit many forms of heterogeneity among capillary units. Alternatively, the failure of the original Krogh model to fully predict tissue O2 supply dependency may arise from basic limitations in the assumptions of that model.\r"

The studies were carried out in placebo control and metabolic alkalosis induced by oral administration of NaHCO3. At the onset of exercise, blood pH was 0.08 units higher in alkalosis compared with placebo. Muscle lactate accumulation during exercise was higher in alkalosis (32 +/- 5 mmol/kg wet wt) than in placebo (17 +/- 4 mmol/kg wet wt), but no difference in intramuscular pH was found between the two conditions. The EMG power spectrum was shifted toward lower frequencies during fatigue in the control condition (10.1 +/- 0.9%), and these spectral shifts, evaluated from changes in the mean power frequency (MPF) of the EMG power spectrum, were further accentuated in alkalosis (19 +/- 2%). Although the changes in frequency components of EMG correlated with muscle lactate accumulation (r = 0.68, P less than 0.01), no direct relationship with muscle pH was observed. We conclude that alkalosis results in a greater reduction in MPF associated with a higher muscle lactate accumulation. However, the good correlation observed between the two variables is not likely causative, and a dissociation between intramuscular pH and the increase in the low-frequency content of EMG power spectrum appears during muscle fatigue.\r"

The last two were \"equiconvective\" as judged by equilibration rates with CO2 and O2 but presumably differed in the shear stress they imposed on the cells. Stirring platelets in normal air or 5% CO2-air caused no significant aggregation. Bubbling air through platelet-rich plasma increased its pH and marked aggregation occurred. Bubbling CO2-air caused the platelet-rich plasma pH to attain its physiological level of 7.4 with less aggregation. In both cases, subsequent ADP-induced aggregation was diminished. Rocking (without stirring) in the presence of CO2-air caused negligible aggregation in platelets and an enhanced response to ADP. Because of the marked difference between the two equiconvective treatments, bubbling and rocking, the main factor in activating the human platelets is suggested to be shear stress (potentiated by high pH), with perhaps a lesser contribution from the air-plasma interface.\r"

Cranial tracheal arteries of anesthetized and paralyzed sheep were perfused at constant flow with monitoring of perfusion pressure. Tracheal smooth muscle tone was assessed by measuring changes in the external diameter of the cranial trachea. Close-arterial injection of antigen (1-20 micrograms) in young sheep produced dose-dependent vasodilation (6.1-15.5% fall in perfusion pressure) and smooth muscle contraction (0.06-0.28 mm reduction in tracheal diam). In old sheep, antigen (1-20 micrograms) produced vasoconstriction (4.1-16.8%) but no smooth muscle response. The smooth muscle contraction in young sheep was blocked by mepyramine (2 mg/kg iv) suggesting mediation by release of histamine. The vasodilation in young sheep and the vasoconstriction in old sheep were reduced by indomethacin (5 mg/kg iv), and the residual response was further reduced by FPL 55712 (2 mg/kg iv), suggesting mediation by both cyclooxygenase products and leukotrienes. Thus antigen given in the tracheal vasculature releases a mixture of inflammatory mediators. This mixture of mediators or their actions on the tracheal vasculature and smooth muscle may depend on the age of the sheep.\r"

We have characterized the effects of CGRP in human pulmonary vessels and localized the receptors for this peptide by autoradiography. Fresh human lung tissue was obtained from eight patients undergoing surgery and small (200-400 microns ID) pulmonary arteries and veins were dissected free of surrounding connective and pulmonary tissue. Pairs of vessels were studied and in one of each pair the endothelium was left intact and from the other of each pair the endothelium was removed by gentle abrasion. For functional studies arteries (n = 9) and veins (n = 9) were suspended in an organ bath, precontracted with 1 microM prostaglandin F2 alpha. CGRP (10 pM to 10 microM) was added in a cumulative manner. CGRP caused a dose-dependent relaxation of endothelium intact human pulmonary arteries and veins with log EC50 values of -8.01 +/- 0.35 and -8.70 +/- 0.40, respectively (not significant). Removal of the endothelium did not diminish the vasodilator potency of CGRP in either vessel. For autoradiographic studies, cryostat sections of the small human pulmonary vessels with or without endothelium were used. 125I-CGRP densely labeled CGRP receptors on vascular smooth muscle and endothelial removal did not have any effect on grain density. We concluded that CGRP is a potent vasodilator of human pulmonary arteries and veins that is not dependent on an intact endothelium. These functional studies correlate with the distribution of CGRP receptors as localized by autoradiography.\r"

In addition, we also obtained direct and reliable measurements of pressures in 0.9-mm arteries and veins using a retrograde catheterization technique, as well as a microvascular pressure made with the double-occlusion technique. The following conclusions were made from dog lobes perfused with autologous blood at normal flow rate of 500-600 ml/min and pressure gradient of 12 mmHg. 1) The double-occlusion technique measures pressure in the capillaries, 2) a small pressure gradient (0.5 mmHg) exists between 30- to 50-micron arteries and veins, 3) a large pressure gradient occurs in arteries and veins greater than 0.9 mm, 4) the arterial and venous occlusion techniques measure pressures in vessels that are less than 900 microns diam but greater than 50 microns, very likely close to 100 microns, 5) serotonin constricts arteries (larger and smaller than 0.9 mm) whereas histamine constricts veins (larger and smaller than 0.9 mm). Thus three different techniques (small retrograde catheter, arterial and venous occlusion, and micropuncture) show consistent results, confirming the presence of significant resistance in large arteries and veins with minimal resistance in the microcirculation.\r"

X-ray fluoroscopy commenced before the initiation of respiration, and the images were recorded on video tape. X-ray transmission through the thorax increased as the lung was aerated. The enhanced transmission was compared with the values obtained from a calibration water wedge from which an equivalent path length through water can be estimated. In testing this method, it was demonstrated that X-ray transmission was linearly related to the wet lung weight-to-body weight ratio and to the product of the wet-to-dry weight ratio multiplied by anatomic thickness of frozen lung blocks. Calibrated values were also linearly related to this product and to the actual measured height of the fluid and tissue in the fluid-filled lung.\r"

  ".W": "The possibility that differences in beta-adrenergic sensitivity among canine trachealis muscles contracted with different contractile agonists are related to differences in the receptor-occupancy characteristics of the contractile agonists was investigated. Relaxation to isoproterenol was compared in muscles contracted with the muscarinic agonists McN-A-343 and acetylcholine (ACh). The apparent dissociation constant (pKB) values for the M1-antagonist, pirenzepine, against ACh (6.96 +/- 0.18) and McN-A-343 (6.84 +/- 0.08) were similar. The pKB values for the M3-antagonist 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP) against ACh (8.76 +/- 0.13) and McN-A-343 (8.71 +/- 0.10) were also similar, suggesting that these agonists were activating the same subtype of muscarinic receptor, probably M3. However, the contractile response to ACh was associated with a greater receptor reserve than that for McN-A-343. Isoproterenol relaxed muscles contracted with McN-A-343 much more effectively than those contracted with an equieffective concentration of ACh. The results suggest that the relative resistance of ACh-induced contractions to relaxation by isoproterenol may not be an inherent quality of muscarinic receptor stimulation. The large receptor reserve available to ACh may act to buffer the contractile response from the inhibitory effects of beta-adrenergic stimulation. Alternatively, ACh may be able to initiate subcellular mechanisms that are unavailable to agonists of lower efficacy.\r"

The subjects performed work by depressing a handle attached to an isokinetic ergometer. Relative concentrations of Pi, phosphocreatine (PCr), and ATP were measured along with intracellular pH. Measurements were made at rest, during steady-state and ramp exercise protocols, and during recovery from exercise. At rest the rowers had Pi/PCr that were not different from control. During steady-state exercise rowers (n = 4) had lower Pi/PCr at the same relative power levels, and the slope of the power vs. Pi-PCr curve was significantly greater than for controls. Rowers (n = 4) also had faster rates of PCr recovery after exercise than controls (T1/2 of 24 +/- 2.0 s for rowers and 47 +/- 8.4 s for controls) when power level was adjusted so that all subjects recovered from the same level of Pi/PCr. During a ramp exercise protocol, the initial slope of the power vs. Pi-PCr curve was greater in three of six rowers compared with controls and at the highest power level rowers had lower Pi/PCr values with less drop in pH.

The flow interruption method for measuring respiratory resistance (Rint) is potentially faced with the same problems. We reassessed the merits of the interruption technique by rendering the extrathoracic airways more rigid and by using a rapid shutter. We measured airway resistance (Raw) with whole body plethysmography during panting (at 2 Hz) and Rint during quiet breathing. Rint and Raw were expressed as specific airway (sGaw) and interruptive conductance (sGint), respectively. In nine healthy subjects (cheeks supported), sGint (0.140 +/- 0.050 s-1.cmH2O-1) was lower (P less than 0.02) than sGaw (0.182 +/- 0.043 s-1.cmH2O-1). By contrast, in 12 patients with severe obstructive lung disease (forced expiratory volume in 1 s/vital capacity = 41.0 +/- 19.8%), sGint (0.058 +/- 0.012 s-1.cmH2O-1) was higher (P less than 0.05) than sGaw (0.047 +/- 0.007 s-1.cmH2O-1), when the cheeks were supported. When the mouth floor was also supported, average values of sGaw (0.048 +/- 0.008 s-1.cmH2O-1) and sGint (0.049 +/- 0.014 s-1.cmH2O-1) became similar. In conclusion, we confirm previous findings in healthy subjects of higher values of Rint, with respect to Raw, probably because of differences in glottis opening between quiet breathing and panting. In airflow obstruction, supporting both the cheeks and the mouth floor decreased sGint, which became similar to sGaw.\r"

To test this hypothesis, the effects of 7 days of hindlimb suspension (HS) and HS plus intermittent weight support activity on the size and metabolic properties of individual fibers in the medial gastrocnemius (MG) were studied. HS resulted in a 40% decrease in the mean cross-sectional area of fibers that stain either dark or light for myosin adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase) at an alkaline preincubation and are located in the deep region (i.e., close to the bone) of the MG. Dark ATPase fibers located in the superficial region were 17% smaller than controls (P greater than 0.05). Although the mean succinate and alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase activities (optical density/min) per muscle fiber were not significantly (P greater than 0.05) affected by HS, it appeared that selected fibers of the deep MG region of HS rats had elevated enzyme activities. HS plus walking on a treadmill for 10 min every 6 h at 5 m/min and at a 19 degrees incline (total of 40 min/day) resulted in mean fiber cross-sectional area and enzyme activities nearer to control than the HS values. All adaptations were much less obvious in the fibers in a superficial (i.e., away from the bone) MG region.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), the major product of arachidonic acid metabolism via the cyclooxygenase pathway in most mast cells, is present in the airways of atopic asthmatic patients after antigen challenge. Because eosinophilia is characteristic of asthma, we asked whether PGD2 causes eosinophils to accumulate in the airways in vivo. Using an endotracheal tube with two inflatable balloons we isolated a segment of trachea in four anesthetized mechanically ventilated dogs, and we superfused this segment with either a control solution (Hanks' balanced salt solution and antibiotics) or solution containing PGD2 (10(-6) M). Total and differential cell counts were determined at base line and every hour for 4 h during the study. PGD2 caused eosinophil accumulation in the trachea [7.0 +/- 3.4, 28.7 +/- 17.8, 33.7 +/- 13.6, and 35.4 +/- 10.7 (SD) cells/cm2 trachea after 1, 2, 3, and 4 h, respectively, P less than 0.05 vs. controls] but had no significant effect on neutrophil accumulation. The effect of PGD2 on eosinophil accumulation was significantly inhibited by the prostaglandin receptor antagonist SKF 88046 (5 mg/kg iv). We conclude that PGD2 is a selective stimulus that causes accumulation of eosinophils in the tracheal lumen of dogs in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of fasting on the febrile responses to intravenous injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS; endotoxin) of Escherichia coli were investigated in rats. Ad libitum-fed rats (C) produced a biphasic fever with an increase in the temperature difference between brown adipose tissue and colon and shivering activity (SA). Measurement by a direct calorimeter showed no particular changes in heat loss. Rats starved for 4 days (F4) responded to intravenous LPS with a monophasic fever accompanied by an increase in SA only. However the maximal rise in colonic temperature (Tco) did not differ from C rats. Subsequent 2-day fasting reduced SA and the maximal fever height. Endogenous pyrogen (EP) injected intravenously produced a prompt rise in Tco followed by prolonged hyperthermia in C rats. In the F4 rats, there was no such sustained rise in Tco as a result of intravenous EP. The response in Tco to intravenous prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was the same in fed and starved rats. The administration of LPS, EP, and PGE2 into the lateral ventricle evoked a similar extent of hyperthermia in C and F4 rats. Because the second phase of fever has been shown to occur after pyrogens are translated into a febrile stimulus within the blood-brain barrier, it is assumed that the functional changes of the blood-brain barrier such as in the permeability of pyrogens or in the sensitivity of pyrogen receptors resulted in the absence of the second phase of fever in starved rats.\r"

Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) recorded by a direct method of microneurography and the intensity of fatigue sensation in working muscles [levels of fatigue sensation (LFS) scale 0-10] were analyzed in 11 male subjects during static handgrip (SHG). SHG was exerted at a tension of 25% of maximal voluntary contraction until the given tension could no longer be sustained. MSNA, represented as total activity (burst number x mean burst amplitude), and LFS increased in a time-dependent process till the end of the SHG. At the termination of the static exercise MSNA had increased an average of 480% of the resting value. In the simple exponential curve, Y = A expBX, where X was LFS and Y was MSNA. The constants A and B estimated from the total experiments were 84.5 and 0.161, respectively. The correlation between LFS and MSNA was statistically significant. There was a large difference in the value of constant B (0.089-0.278) among the subjects, and a relatively small difference in the value of constant A (37.5-133.8). The increases in both MSNA and LFS during SHG may be mainly related to the same afferent volley from working skeletal muscles. The results indicate that the response of the muscle sympathetic nerve to SHG relates to the psychological feelings of fatigue in the working muscles.\r"

  ".W": "The major goal of this study was to compare gas exchange, tidal volume (VT), and dynamic lung pressures resulting from high-frequency airway oscillation (HFAO) with the corresponding effects in high-frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO). Eight anesthetized paralyzed dogs were maintained eucapnic with HFAO and HFCWO at frequencies ranging from 1 to 16 Hz in the former and 0.5 to 8 Hz in the latter. Tracheal (delta Ptr) and esophageal (delta Pes) pressure swings, VT, and arterial blood gases were measured in addition to respiratory impedance and static pressure-volume curves. Mean positive pressure (25-30 cmH2O) in the chest cuff associated with HFCWO generation decreased lung volume by approximately 200 ml and increased pulmonary impedance significantly. Aside from this decrease in functional residual capacity (FRC), no change in lung volume occurred as a result of dynamic factors during the course of HFCWO application. With HFAO, a small degree of hyperinflation occurred only at 16 Hz. Arterial PO2 decreased by 5 Torr on average during HFCWO. VT decreased with increasing frequency in both cases, but VT during HFCWO was smaller over the range of frequencies compared with HFAO. delta Pes and delta Ptr between 1 and 8 Hz were lower than the corresponding pressure swings obtained with conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) applied at 0.25 Hz. delta Pes was minimized at 1 Hz during HFCWO; however, delta Ptr decreased continuously with decreasing frequency and, below 2 Hz, became progressively smaller than the corresponding values obtained with HFAO and CMV.\r"

  ".W": "The goal of this theoretical study was to develop a simple computational model for determining the lung pressure excursions that accompany the maintenance of adequate gas transport through high-frequency airway oscillations applied via the trachea (HFAO) and by transthoracic means (HFTO). Respiratory mechanics and gas transport parameters estimated from the preceding companion study (J. Appl. Physiol. 67: 985-992, 1989) were used in the model for computing tracheal, alveolar, pleural, and transpulmonary pressure swings. Comparison of model predictions with corresponding data obtained in dogs showed close agreement. The specification of eucapnia as a constraint led to results that were significantly different from previous findings which had assumed constant airflow. We used the model to identify \"quasi-optimal\" strategies for HFAO and HFTO application in which all pressure excursions were kept below the corresponding levels produced by conventional mechanical ventilation operating at 15 breaths/min. The model suggests the application of both HFAO and HFTO at frequencies substantially lower than the settings commonly employed in high-frequency ventilation. Application of HFAO at frequencies ranging from 1 to 4 Hz is recommended, whereas for HFTO the quasi-optimal range lies between 1 and 1.7 Hz. In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pressure costs during HFAO or HFTO are minimized in the vicinity of 1 Hz.\r"

Six competitive cyclists and six varsity cross-country runners performed a graded exercise test via two different modalities: treadmill running and bicycle ergometry. Although maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) did not differ significantly for the cyclists for treadmill running and cycling (64.6 +/- 1.0 and 63.5 +/- 0.4 ml O2.kg-1-min-1, respectively), both TLa and TVE occurred at a relatively earlier work load during the treadmill run. The opposite was true for the runners as TLa and TVE appeared at an earlier percent of VO2max during cycling compared with treadmill running (60.0 +/- 1.7 vs. 75.0 +/- 4.0%, respectively, TLa). The inflection in plasma epinephrine shifted in an identical manner and occurred simultaneously with that of TLa (r = 0.97) regardless of the testing protocol or training status. Although a high correlation (r = 0.86) existed for the shift in TVE and TLa, this relationship was not as strong as was seen with plasma epinephrine. The results suggest that a causal relationship existed between the inflection in plasma epinephrine and TLa during a graded exercise test. This association was not as strong for TVE and TLa.\r"

Two biopsies (1-3 g) were taken from each lung and the remaining tissue was homogenized for wet-to-dry lung weight and volume calculations. Estimates of distribution volumes from whole lung homogenized samples were statistically smaller than biopsy samples for extravascular water, interstitial 99mTc-DTPA, and interstitial albumin. The mean fraction of the interstitium (Fe), which excludes albumin, was 0.68 +/- 0.04 for whole lung samples compared with 0.62 +/- 0.03 for biopsy samples. Hematocrit may explain the consistent difference. To make the Fe for biopsy samples match that for homogenized samples, a mean hematocrit, which was 82% of large vessel hematocrit, was required. Excluded volume fraction for exogenous sheep albumin was compared with that of exogenous human albumin in two sheep, and no difference was found at 24 h.\r"

The relationship among contractility, airway smooth muscle myosin, and smooth muscle thickness was also examined. The trachea was divided into three segments, each consisting of 12-14 rings. Smooth muscle strips from each of the three regions (top, middle, and bottom of the trachea) and from fourth to fifth generation bronchi were studied. Acetylcholine (ACh) sensitivity (-log EC50) was 8.1, 7.1, 7.9, and 6.1 for the top, middle, and bottom of the trachea and the bronchi, respectively. At P = 0.01, the EC50 ACh value of the top of the trachea differed from the EC50 value of the bronchi. Maximal tension (Tmax) generated in bronchi (3.2 g) was lower (P less than 0.01) than in the top (10.4 g), middle (7.1 g), and bottom of the trachea (5.1 g). Differences between trachea and bronchi disappeared when Tmax was corrected for smooth muscle myosin content. Thickness of smooth muscle in bronchi was less (P less than 0.01) than in the three regions of trachea. Tmax was significantly correlated with airway smooth muscle thickness (r = 0.56; P less than 0.05). These results suggest that in mongrel dogs sensitivity to ACh shows a gradient from the top of the trachea to the bronchi and that Tmax is greater in the trachea than in the bronchi and is significantly correlated with thickness of smooth muscle.\r"

The clotting activity levels of factor XII, factor XI, plasma prekallikrein, and high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK) were measured, and plasma kallikrein-induced proteolytic cleavage of HMWK was assessed by ligand blotting by use of radiolabeled factor XI. After an ascent on foot from 1,170 to 4,559 m in 3 days, three subjects developed high-altitude pulmonary edema, and four subjects presented facial edema. There was no evidence for activation of the contact system in any subject as demonstrated by the lack of proteolytic cleavage of HMWK at high altitude. The absence of contact system activation was further supported by stable plasma levels of the individual factors of contact activation. Therefore, we conclude that bradykinin generated by plasma kallikrein-induced cleavage of HMWK is not involved in the pathogenesis of edema due to acute exposure to high altitude.\r"

This reduction in the upper airway muscle tone may not end at the pharynx but may extend further distally, e.g., into the trachea. Because tracheal tone cannot be measured directly in conscious humans, we inferred the tone from the relative hysteresis of the tracheal area compared with the lung. Relative hysteresis was measured by plotting the cross-sectional area of a tracheal segment obtained by the acoustic reflection technique vs. lung volume. All measurements were performed during wakefulness. We found that in 42 patients with obstructive sleep apnea (apnea/hypopnea index greater than 10), relative hysteresis of the proximal trachea was predominantly clockwise, i.e., smaller than that of the lung parenchyma; in the 33 nonapneic patients (apnea/hypopnea index less than or equal to 10), it was predominantly counter-clockwise, i.e., larger than that of the lung parenchyma. For the distal trachea all patients, apneic and nonapneic, had similar, clockwise, relative hysteresis. We conclude that reduction in the upper airway muscle tone in patients with obstructive sleep apnea extends into the trachea.\r"

Unanesthetized rats (Rattus norvegicus) were subjected to simulated dives in either air, 79% He-21% O2, or 79% Ar-21% O2; depths ranged from 125 to 175 feet of seawater (4.8-6.3 atmospheres absolute). After 1 h at depth, the dive chamber was vented (with depth held constant) over a 5-min period with the same gas as in the chamber (controls) or one of the other two inert gas-O2 mixtures. After the gas switch, a 5- to 35-min period was allowed for gas exchange between the animals and chamber atmosphere before rapid decompression to the surface. Substantial changes in the risk of decompression sickness (DCS) were observed after the gas switch because of differences in potencies (He less than N2 less than Ar) for causing DCS and gas exchange rates (He greater than Ar greater than N2) among the three gases. Based on the predicted gas exchange rates, transient increases or decreases in total inert gas pressure would be expected to occur during these experimental conditions. Because of differences in gas potencies, DCS risk may not directly follow the changes in total inert gas pressure. In fact, a decline in predicted DCS risk may occur even as total inert gas pressure in increasing.\r"

Experiments were conducted in decerebrate cats that were paralyzed, ventilated, thoracotomized, and vagotomized. Microelectrode recordings within the BotC region revealed that some neurons were activated by phrenic nerve stimulation (15 of 69 expiratory units, 9 of 67 inspiratory units, and 19 nonrespiratory-modulated units) at average latencies similar to the onset latency of the phrenic-to-phrenic inhibition. In addition, microstimulation within the BotC caused a short latency transient inhibition of phrenic motor activity. In 17 cats phrenic neurogram responses to threshold and supramaximal (15 mA) stimulation of phrenic nerve afferents were recorded before and after electrolytic BotC lesions. In 15 animals the inhibitory reflex was attenuated by bilateral lesions. Because lesion of either BotC neurons or axons of passage could account for this attenuation, in eight experiments the phrenic-to-phrenic inhibitory responses were recorded before and after bilateral injections of 5 microM kainic acid (30-150 nl) into the BotC. After chemical lesions, the inhibitory response to phrenic nerve stimulation remained; however, neuronal activity typical of the BotC could not be located. These results suggest that axons important in producing the phrenic-to-phrenic reflex pass through the region of the BotC, but that BotC neurons themselves are not necessary for this reflex.\r"
