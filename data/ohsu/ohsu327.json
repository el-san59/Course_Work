A linear increase in search latency with increasing display size has been assumed to reflect serial focused attention to each item in the display. A delay in the detection of a signal in a previously attended location has been assumed to reflect an inhibitory process that may be used to prevent attention from returning to the same stimulus. The following study of human performance supports these assumptions and, by demonstrating that inhibition of return operates in serial search, presumably to improve search efficiency, provides a functional link between these two phenomena.\r"

  ".W": "The circadian clock is considered to be a universal feature of eucaryotic organisms, controlling the occurrence and rates of many different aspects of life, ranging from single enzymatic reactions and metabolism to complex behaviours such as activity and rest. Although the nature of the underlying cellular/biochemical oscillator is still unknown, many substances are known to influence either phase or period of circadian rhythms in different organisms. These include D2O, electrolytes and ion channel inhibitors, small organic molecules such as alcohols and aldehydes, inhibitors of protein synthesis and amino-acid analogues. Certain transmitter and neurochemical drugs also influence the circadian clock in higher animals. We report here that the period of free-running circadian rhythms in the unicellular marine alga Gonyaulax polyedra is shortened by extracts from mammalian cells. The effect is dose-dependent, accelerating the circadian clock by as much as 4 hours per day. The substance responsible for this effect has been isolated from bovine muscle and identified as creatine. Authentic creatine has identical biological effects at micromolar concentrations and is known in animal systems for its involvement in cellular energy metabolism. A period shortening substance with similar chemical properties is also present in extracts of Gonyaulax itself.\r"

  ".W": "Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs), like many other neurotransmitter and hormone receptors, transduce agonist signals by activating G proteins to regulate ion channel activity and the generation of second messengers via the phosphoinositide (PI) and adenylyl cyclase systems. Human mAChRs are a family of at least four gene products which have distinct primary structures, ligand-binding properties and patterns of tissue-specific expression. To examine the question of whether functional differences exist between multiple receptor subtypes, we have investigated the ability of each subtype to regulate PI hydrolysis and adenylyl cyclase when expressed individually in a cell lacking endogenous mAChRs. We show that the HM2 and HM3 mAChRs efficiently inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity but poorly activate PI hydrolysis. In contrast, the HM1 and HM4 mAChRs strongly activate PI hydrolysis, but do not inhibit adenylyl cyclase, and in fact can substantially elevate cAMP levels. Interestingly, the subtypes that we find to be functionally similar are also more similar in sequence. Our results indicate that the different receptor subtypes are functionally specialized.\r"

We examined the genesis of molecular variation in HIV-1 by sequential virus isolations from two chronically infected individuals and analysis of recombinant HIV-1 genomic clones. In three different virus isolates full-length HIV-1 clones were identified and found to consist, respectively, of 17, 9 and 13 distinguishable, but highly-related, viral genotypes. Thirty-five viral clones derived from two HIV-1 isolates obtained from the same individual but 16 months apart showed progressive change, yet were clearly related. Similar changes in the HIV-1 genome did not occur in vitro during virus isolation and amplification. The results indicate that HIV-1 variation in vivo is rapid, that a remarkably large number of related but distinguishable genotypic variants evolve in parallel and coexist during chronic infection, and that 'isolates' of HIV-1, unless molecularly or biologically cloned, generally consist of complex mixtures of genotypically distinguishable viruses.\r"

Recently factors resembling fibroblast growth factor and transforming growth factor-beta were shown to be involved in mesoderm induction in Xenopus laevis, suggesting that membrane receptor-mediated signal transduction is important in induction processes. Here we report direct measurements of protein kinase C (PKC) activity in uninduced ectoderm, and in neuroectoderm shortly after induction by the involuting mesoderm, in Xenopus laevis embryos. Membrane-bound PKC activity increased three to fourfold in the induced neuroectoderm while the cytosolic PKC activity was decreasing, indicating that PKC activity was translocated during neural induction. A similar time- and dose-dependent translocation of activity was seen after incubation with the PKC activator 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate, which also induced neural tissue in competent ectoderm, suggesting that PKC is involved in the response to the endogenous inducing signal during neural induction.\r"

Prominent among these so-called 'immediate early' or 'competence' genes are the nuclear oncogenes fos and myc. Although the precise function of these early response genes in growth control is not understood, it is likely that many of them are involved in the transition from G0 to G1 in the cell cycle. The findings that the products of nuclear proto-oncogenes jun and erbA are transcriptional factors supports the notion of the role of the nuclear oncoproteins in the regulation of gene expression. Recently, it has been reported that the FOS protein is associated in transcriptional complexes with the product of the jun oncogene, the transcription factor AP-1. As the fos gene is induced in response to mitogens during initiation of cell growth, we investigated whether expression of the nuclear transcription factor AP-1 is also inducible. We report that mouse c-jun gene transcription is rapidly induced by serum and phorbol-ester 12-o-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA). Furthermore, induction is transient and the mRNA is superinduced by inhibitors of protein synthesis.\r"

The aim of barrier placement was to reduce, but not overcorrect, the prolapse and to restrict stress-induced mobility of the viscera posterior and superior to the urethra. Each of the women had very high pressure transmission ratios in each quarter of the urethra (means of 257, 187, 170, and 166% from internal to external quarters) that were significantly reduced with barrier placement (means of 78, 84, 85, and 101%). Eight of 11 subjects had pressure transmission ratios less than 90% in the proximal three-quarters of the urethra with the barrier in place, a finding in nearly all subjects with genuine stress urinary incontinence. Maximum urethral closure pressure on passive urethral pressure profilometry also decreased significantly from a mean of 75 to 45 cm H2O with the barrier in place. We conclude that the stress continence mechanism in women with severe prolapse results from posterior-superior visceral descent with stress, causing mechanical obstruction of the less mobile urethra. The evaluation methods described may be useful in predicting which of these patients may require concurrent urethropexy at the time of prolapse reduction surgery to prevent postoperative stress urinary incontinence.\r"

Contraction of the pelvic diaphragm would pull the vagina against the posterior surface of the urethra, causing an increase in posteriorly measured \"pressures.\" Support of the urethra at rest comes from both its attachment to the arcus tendineus fasciae pelvis and the resting tone of the pelvic diaphragm muscles. Two arches of striated muscle (compressor urethrae and urethrovaginal sphincter) run over the distal urethra in the region of the perineal membrane (ie, urogenital diaphragm). Activity of these muscles could compress the urethra distally, causing the urethral pressure rise that precedes and exceeds the rise in abdominal pressure during a cough and explaining asymmetry of pressure measurements in this area. Recognition of these structural relationships can help us understand urethral pressures during a cough and directional \"pressure\" variations seen in patients with stress incontinence. They may also contribute to the understanding of surgical failures that occur despite successful urethral suspension.\r"

In 97.4% of 151 patients cured by a fascia lata sling procedure, the urethralvesical cough-pressure transmission ratio was greater than 100%, and in no case was it less than 100%. In 46.6% of 116 patients cured by anterior colporrhaphy, the cough-pressure transmission ratio was greater than 100%, and in 20.7% of the 116 patients, the transmission ratio was less than 100%. The 24 women in the latter group were cured by a sufficient increase in resting intraurethral pressure (to augment the maximal intraurethral closure pressure with stress) to maintain continence with increased intra-abdominal pressure. We believe that urethral kinking at the instant of increased intra-abdominal pressure with stress produced the greater than 100% cough-pressure transmission ratio seen in 201 (75.3%) of the 267 patients cured of genuine stress incontinence.\r"

The efficacy of the therapy was evaluated prospectively by the patients' symptomatology, monthly pelvic examinations, and by restaging the disease at second-look laparoscopy during the last week of treatment. The effects of therapy on the serum gonadotropin and ovarian steroid levels and on the endometrium and the implants of endometriosis were also evaluated. Improvement of symptoms, pelvic nodularity, and tenderness occurred in 80% of the patients. The mean stage score of disease by the American Fertility Society classification decreased from 18.2 +/- 2 before therapy to 5.9 +/- 1 after therapy (P less than .005). Amenorrhea, breakthrough bleeding, and persistent cyclic bleeding occurred in 75, 20, and 10% of the patients, respectively. Ovulation was inhibited in all patients, but serum hormone changes were statistically significant only for LH, which decreased from 9.5 +/- 4 to 5.2 +/- 2 IU/L (P less than .001), and estradiol (E2), which decreased from 80 +/- 30 to 46 +/- 26 pg/mL (P less than .02). Atrophic changes and pseudodecidualized reaction occurred in both the endometrium and the implants of endometriosis. In summary, oral medroxyprogesterone acetate is effective in relieving symptoms and objectively improving endometriosis. Besides inducing a pseudodecidualized reaction and atrophic changes in the endometrium and ectopic implants, medroxyprogesterone acetate also suppresses ovulation and the serum levels of both LH and E2.\r"

A significant increase in serum free T4 and a decrease in serum TSH were observed in early pregnancy relative to the levels in nonpregnant controls. The increased free T4 and hCG and decreased TSH correlated with the severity of morning sickness, and these changes were especially marked in subjects with nausea and vomiting. The individual serum levels of hCG in the pregnant group correlated significantly, directly with the levels of free T4 and inversely with those of TSH. The increased free T4 and decreased TSH in subjects with emesis returned to the normal ranges of nonpregnant controls after improvement of emesis. These data indicate that the thyroid gland is physiologically activated in early pregnancy, possibly by hCG or a related substance, which may induce gestational emesis. On the other hand, an increased level of free T4 and a reduced level of TSH in early normal pregnancy are not indications of thyrotoxicosis and may not necessitate antithyroid drug treatment.\r"

To assess the effect of diabetes mellitus on fetal pulmonary maturation, we measured cholesteryl palmitate concentration, the lung profile, and total phosphatidylcholine in amniotic fluid obtained from 35 well-controlled diabetic and 39 control pregnancies at term. In women with diabetes, the mean (+/- SD) third-trimester glycosylated hemoglobin level was 6.96 +/- 2.3% (normal 6-8%). Mean cholesteryl palmitate concentration in the diabetic population was 79.12 +/- 13.17 micrograms/mL, versus 153.71 +/- 16.77 micrograms/mL in the control group (P less than .001). The mean cholesteryl palmitate concentration was also significantly different for gestational diabetics and class B-R gravidas (112.75 +/- 26.2 versus 54.45 +/- 7.34 micrograms/mL; P less than .005). Cholesteryl palmitate was decreased despite the presence of a mature lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio and, in most cases, phosphatidylglycerol. These data suggest that even in well-controlled diabetic pregnancies, alterations in maternal metabolism may affect either the biosynthesis or degradation of cholesteryl palmitate.\r"

A prospective survey of pregnant women was made at a hospital in Brussels over the period 1979-1986 to assess the impact of such a prevention program. In the first study period (1979-1982), when no prophylactic measures were taught, 2986 consecutive women demonstrated a seroconversion rate of 1.43% among the nonimmunized subjects; 1.07% of the seropositive patients had high antibody levels in their first serum sample. In the second study period (1983-1986), all 3563 patients were instructed to adopt prophylactic measures. The seroconversion rate in seronegative patients and the percentage of patients with high initial antibody level were 0.95 and 1.26%, respectively. Although the percentage of seroconversion was reduced by 34% in the second study period, this difference did not attain significance. These results indicate that the impact of a primary prevention program aimed at reducing congenital toxoplasmosis is limited.\r"

Excluding menopausal status, all of these variables had a significant relationship to overall survival in a univariate analysis. Using a Cox multivariate regression analysis, stage, age, and an estrogen receptor value of more than 70 fmol/mg protein, combined with a progesterone receptor value of more than 30 fmol/mg protein, were independently associated with survival. The results demonstrate that for maximum prognostic information, both estrogen and progesterone content of tumors should be measured. Maximum prognostic information is obtained by using cutoff levels that are much higher than those traditionally accepted. This has particular relevance for patient stratification in clinical trials investigating receptor information and response to adjuvant or therapeutic treatment.\r"

In 248 patients with clinical stage I disease for whom uterine evaluation was complete, there was an increasing incidence of malignant cytology with increasing grade (P = .002), depth of myometrial invasion (P = .003), and adnexal spread (P less than .001). Twelve of 41 patients (29.3%) with clinical stage I and positive cytology developed recurrent disease, compared with six of 207 (2.9%) with negative cytology (P less than .001). Survival for all stages together was poorer in patients with positive washings than in those with negative washings (P less than .001). This difference in survival was also observed in patients with clinical stage I disease (P less than .001). Among patients with surgical stage I disease, disease-free survival was also superior in the group with negative cytology. In both clinical and surgical stage I, intra-abdominal recurrences were more common among patients with malignant peritoneal cytology.\r"

  ".W": "A series of 117 women with histologically defined, superficially invasive (1-5 mm) squamous cell carcinoma was evaluated to determine important histomorphologic variables, frequency of pelvic lymph node metastases, and outcome. Radical or modified radical hysterectomy with pelvic node dissection was usually performed for women with more than 1 mm invasion, whereas more conservative surgery was used when invasion was 1 mm or less. Depth of stromal invasion was the most important variable in predicting pelvic lymph node metastases. The overall incidence of pelvic node metastases was 5%, and the incidence of metastases in those patients with 3 mm or less and 3.1-5.0 mm of invasion was 2 and 13%, respectively. Although the risk of node metastases was significantly higher with deeper invasion, one patient with 2 mm of invasion had pelvic node involvement. Microscopic lymph-vascular invasion and degree of lateral spread of tumor were also associated with lymph node metastases, whereas tumor grade was not. There were no invasive recurrences in the series. We conclude that histomorphologic variables other than depth of stromal invasion should be considered when evaluating patients with superficially invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. We recommend that any trends toward less radical therapy for this disease be justified by equal cure rates and careful pathologic review.\r"

One hundred one patients have undergone the operation at Yale University over the last decade. Of 67 who had epithelial ovarian cancer, 43% had positive and 57% had negative second-look surgery. Multivariate analysis revealed that stage was a significant prognostic factor with regard to second-look surgery findings, as well as absolute and disease-free survival. We found initial tumor size and results of cytology at second-look surgery to be prognostic factors with regard to survival after a positive second-look surgery. Survival after negative second-look surgery was significantly greater than that after a positive operation. However, no improvement in survival accrued to the group of advanced-stage, platinum-treated patients who underwent second-look surgery, compared with a similar group of patients who were eligible but did not undergo the procedure. We conclude that second-look surgery in epithelial ovarian cancer patients should be limited to experimental protocol situations in which precise measurement of tumor size may be important. In ovarian germ cell malignancies, second-look surgery, in the absence of tumor markers, can be justified.\r"

Preparations for surgical removal of the thyroid gland were being made until pregnancy intervened. Several well-documented mechanisms of hyperthyroidism, including increased intestinal absorption of glucose, decreased insulin responsiveness, and increased glucose production may exacerbate glucose intolerance; the daily insulin requirement of this patient rose 80% from her pregestational dosage. When large doses of propranolol failed to control her thyrotoxic symptoms and led to severe, recurrent hypoglycemic episodes, subtotal thyroidectomy was performed. A 42% decrease in insulin requirements was observed postoperatively, with return to the euthyroid state. A propensity for symptomatic postoperative hypoglycemia should be anticipated in diabetic patients undergoing thyroidectomy.\r"

In these cases, hydrops fetalis was diagnosed with ultrasound at 21 and 22 weeks' gestation after 10 or more days of maternal flu-like symptoms. The outcome was stillbirth in one case and neonatal death in the other. In both cases, intrauterine infection by human parvovirus B-19 was confirmed based on two findings: maternal serum positive for human parvovirus B-19 immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody, and human parvovirus B-19 DNA detected in the fetal organs using Southern blotting and hybridization with a 32P-labeled probe. Laboratory tests on cord blood demonstrated a red blood cell count of 163 x 10(4)/microL, and nucleated red cells numbering 1267 per 50 white cells in the live-birth case. Histologic examinations of fetal tissues demonstrated leukoerythroblastic reaction in the liver and spleen, granular hemosiderin deposition in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells, and bilirubin deposition in the intercellular space in the liver. This evidence indicates that, in some fetuses with intrauterine human parvovirus B-19 infection, hydropic changes may be induced by the sudden decrease in oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood due to severe anemia caused by the infection.\r"

Recognition of the association between this serum enzyme profile and dysgerminoma resulted in proper intraoperative staging and prompt initiation of chemotherapy in two patients. Failure to recognize the significance of the serum enzyme profile resulted in inadequate intraoperative staging and reoperation in one of the remaining patients. Serum LDH levels correlated with tumor size and stage of disease. Maximum tumor diameters in this series varied from 15-20 cm. A normal LDH level was present in an intraoperative serum sample obtained from a stage IA patient whose maximum tumor diameter was 8 cm. Selective elevation of LDH-1 and LDH-2 isoenzymes may provide additional evidence suggesting the presence of a dysgerminoma.\r"

Alterations of the retinal pigment epithelium within the macula were noted in 45% of the eyes. Fluorescein angiography in selected animals revealed window defects consistent with drusen. None of this sample showed the exudative form of AMD or disciform scarring. One typical monkey underwent special studies including measurement of visual resolution by electrophysiological study of the retinal and visual cortex. Application of human criteria to this animal supported the diagnosis of early AMD. Histopathologic study of one eye by transmission electron microscopy confirmed the presence of drusen with nearly identical ultrastructural features to those found in the human pigment epithelium in AMD.\r"

Fifteen to 17 accordion folds are joined apically by a heavily pigmented ridge of tissue which holds the pecten in a fan-like shape, widest at the base. The entire pecten is enclosed by a fine basal lamina. Within each fold are numerous capillaries, larger blood vessels and melanocytes. The capillaries are surrounded by thick fibrillar basal laminae which often contain pericytes. These capillaries display numerous microfolds on both the luminal and abluminal borders. The endothelial cell body is extremely thin with most organelles present in a paranuclear location. The melanocytes which are more plentiful in the bridge region form an incomplete sheath around the capillaries and other blood vessels. The morphology of the pecten in the pigeon is indicative of a heavy involvement in the transport of materials.\r"

Thirty patients were asymptomatic (group 1) and 30 patients had painful neuropathy (group 2), predominantly originating in the distal lower limbs (group 2a; n = 20) or in the distal upper limbs (group 2b; n = 10). There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to age, duration of diabetes or glycemic control. Eleven of the 12 functions tested (6 in lower and upper limbs, respectively) were significantly diminished in both groups of diabetics as compared to age-matched control subjects. Group 2a had significant impairment in 5 of 6 parameters of the lower limbs, while in group 2b only 1 of 6 functions of the upper limbs was diminished. In the whole diabetic group, the most frequent abnormality was an elevated threshold for thermal sensation in the foot. Significant correlations between small and large fiber abnormalities were observed predominantly in the foot. Selective affection of small or large fiber functions showed different patterns in the arms and in the legs. In the upper extremities selective impairment in nerve conduction was predominant, while in the lower extremities it was thermal sensation. These findings suggest that both generalized and selective small or large fiber affection may occur in long-term type 1 diabetic patients. Dysfunction of both modalities is more severe in the lower limbs, when painful symptoms have developed in this region.\r"

  ".W": "Subjective responses of continuous epidural analgesia with bupivacaine were compared in 30 patients with acute (postoperative) or chronic (low back) pain. In the acute pain patients, sensory block was 4 dermatomes at 9 h and 6 dermatomes at 64 h. Corresponding values in the chronic pain patients were 8 and 6 dermatomes respectively. Motor blockade of the lower limbs was more profound in the acute pain group. The acute pain patients had significantly better pain relief (VAS: 85-96% vs. 55-70%) and a significantly higher proportion of these patients reported a global score of 3 (excellent; 80% vs. 7%). The mean dosage of bupivacaine decreased in the acute pain group from 21.0 +/- 5.7 (mean +/- S.D.) mg/h at 9 h to 15.1 +/- 8.5 mg/h at 64 h. Corresponding values for the chronic pain group were 20.7 +/- 5.9 and 12.0 +/- 6.0 mg/h respectively. Mean plasma concentration of bupivacaine increased from 1.2 +/- 0.8 micrograms/ml at 9 h to 2.1 +/- 1.4 micrograms/ml at 64 h in the acute pain patients and was 0.8 +/- 0.3 micrograms/ml at 9 h to 1.0 +/- 1.0 micrograms/ml at 64 h in the chronic pain patients. The incidence of side effects was approximately the same in both groups. No signs of accumulation or toxic reactions to bupivacaine were seen.\r"

  ".W": "We compared cluster headache pain and other vascular (migraine and mixed) headache pain on pain intensity ratings and the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ). Cluster headache sufferers reported not only more intense pain and more affective distress, but also different pain qualities than did migraine and mixed headache sufferers. The pain qualities that best distinguished cluster headaches from other vascular headaches were the presence of punctate pressure and thermal sensations and the absence of dull pain. Although cluster headache sufferers and other vascular headache sufferers endorsed different sensory pain qualities, MPQ subscales proved no better than pain intensity ratings at distinguishing these two groups. This finding may have occurred because MPQ subscale scores include an intensity component and do not provide information about specific pain qualities such as that provided by MPQ sensory items. These findings provide evidence that cluster headaches are characterized by distinct pain qualities and are not simply a more intense version of the same vascular headache pain experienced by migraine and mixed headache sufferers. They further suggest than when the MPQ is used to assess specific pain qualities, sensory items and not the sensory subscale are the preferred units for analysis.\r"

Each child completed an extensive battery of psychological tests, which consisted of (1) the Children's Depression Inventory (for children aged 8-13) or the Beck Depression Inventory (for children 14 and above), (2) the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (ages 8-12) or the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Form X (ages 13 and above), (3) the Children's Depression Rating Scale, (4) the Personality Inventory for Children, (5) the Child Behavior Checklist, (6) the Psychosomatic Symptom Checklist, SUNYA Revision, (7) the Children's Social Readjustment Rating Questionnaire, (8) the Wide Range Achievement Test for Reading, and (9) the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, Form L. Children with migraine revealed higher scores on all scales measuring depression and somatic complaints; adolescent headache sufferers also revealed increased levels of trait anxiety. Older male headache sufferers revealed the poorest overall level of adjustment as reflected by scores on the Adjustment scale of the Personality Inventory for Children. It was argued that the psychological differences were most likely a consequence of the migraineurs having to live with frequent, unpredictable attacks of intense pain. However, the correlational nature of this study does not make it possible to rule out alternative explanations.\r"

In many cases, there is little agreement as to what evaluation procedures should be used or how to weight and integrate these findings. Two studies were conducted to determine the domain of procedures pain specialists believe are most important in evaluation and the clinical utility of each. A survey of 75 physicians specializing in the treatment of chronic pain was conducted. Coefficients of concordance indicated that physicians displayed substantial agreement as to the differential utility of 18 physical examination and diagnostic procedures. The relevance of each of these procedures in the assessment of 100 pain patients was evaluated. Differential weights for each procedure derived from the survey were highly correlated with clinical practice. The results of the present studies provide a basis for development of a standardized assessment procedure that incorporates statistically derived weights to quantify medical findings.\r"

  ".W": "A study on the nociceptive responses of single cells within the nucleus parafascicularis (PF) thalami of the rat was undertaken to clarify the reported observations of a pain suppression pathway to this nucleus from the dorsal raphe (DR) nucleus. Two types of nociceptive neuron were identified in the PF which were classified as 'nociceptive-on' and 'nociceptive-off' neurons, respectively. DR stimulation exhibits a simple monophasic 'dose-dependent' relationship between the degree of the inhibition elicited and the stimulation intensity used on the 'nociceptive-off' cells. In contrast, biphasic effects following DR stimulation on the 'nociceptive-on' cells was obtained, with low intensities eliciting suppression while high intensities excited the cells. These effects of low intensity DR stimulation upon the responses of the 'nociceptive-on' cells were diminished but not prevented by transection of the well-known bulbospinal inhibitory fibers descending in the dorsal half of the spinal cord, while the effects of DR stimulation upon the 'nociceptive-off' cells remain unchanged following spinal transection. Thus, our results show that DR stimulation modulates the nociceptive responsiveness of the PF by way of supraspinal pathways in addition to the previously described descending paths.\r"

  ".W": "In cats anaesthetized with nitrous oxide and sodium pentobarbital, multireceptive lumbar dorsal horn neurones excited by controlled noxious radiant heating of glabrous hind paw skin were recorded by extracellular microelectrodes. These noxious heat responses were inhibited by concomitant noxious stimulation of the ipsilateral forepaw or pinna, or repetitive electrical stimulation of the ipsilateral forelimb deep radial nerve. Similar extents of inhibition were produced by noxious peripheral stimulation and by deep radial nerve stimulation in repetitive trains at intensities sufficient to excite small myelinated fibres or unmyelinated fibres. A greater inhibitory effect was produced by continuous repetitive high-intensity stimulation of the deep radial nerve. With a constant frequency (5 Hz) of continuous deep radial nerve stimulation, graded increases in stimulation intensity revealed the threshold for inhibition in the small myelinated fibre range, and an additional increment of the inhibitory effect when unmyelinated fibres were also activated. When suprathreshold for unmyelinated fibres, the efficacy of continuous deep radial nerve stimulation increased with graded increases in stimulation frequency, with a threshold frequency for inhibition between 0.5 and 1 Hz and maximal effect at 5 Hz. Two nociceptive-specific neurones studied were also inhibited by deep radial nerve stimulation. The results indicate that 'diffuse noxious inhibitory controls' (DNIC) occur in the cat and can be activated by remote electrical or natural noxious stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "Anatomical and electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that enkephalinergic, noradrenergic, and serotonergic pathways projecting from the brain-stem to the dorsal horn inhibit nociceptive transmission at the spinal level. Previous attempts to delineate interactions between opioids, norepinephrine (NE), and serotonin (5-HT) in the production of spinal analgesia have produced conflicting results. The present study determined the effect of intrathecal (i.t.) pretreatment with opioid, NE, and 5-HT antagonists upon i.t. monoamine- and morphine-induced antinociception as assessed with the rat tail-flick model. Naloxone, at a dose which antagonized i.t. morphine analgesia, had no effect upon i.t. NE but inhibited i.t. 5-HT antinociception. Corynanthine or yohimbine (NE antagonists) reduced analgesia elicited by i.t. NE but not morphine, while pretreatment with methysergide or ketanserin (5-HT antagonists) attenuated both i.t. 5-HT- and morphine-induced antinociception. These results suggest that (1) an opioid link mediates spinal 5-HT but not NE antinociception, and (2) 5-HT but not NE participates in spinal morphine analgesia.\r"

Arthritic rats also had a marked increase in the fragmentation of their sleep manifested by an increased number of sleep bouts and episodes of wakefulness and a decrease in the duration of episodes of deep sleep recorded both during the time of maximal sleep (08.00-11.00 h) and of maximal wakefulness (20.00-23.00 h).

Of these children 23% developed chronic OME (i.e. effusion lasting 8 continuous weeks or more), and 26% developed chronic OME complicated by acute, symptomatic otitis media. Predictors for chronic OME were (1) bilateral OME, (2) duration of effusion for greater than 2 weeks at enrollment and (3) day care attendance.

The adherence of 33 middle ear fluid isolates from 19 infants with AOM was compared with 143 strains recovered from NP cultures taken from each child both at the time of their acute infections and on other occasions. We studied 171 NP isolates from 29 \"carrier\" infants, who had no pneumococcal infections, for comparison. Adherence properties were not associated with any particular pneumococcal capsular types, nor were adherent strains more frequent among infants with AOM. There was no evidence to support the hypothesis that pneumococci associated with AOM have a special propensity for adherence. Adherence was a frequent characteristic of pneumococci recovered from the NP, especially in connection with upper respiratory tract infection, and may be required for the establishment of colonization but was not a property that discriminated between carriage strains and those causing AOM.\r"

Six patients had encephalitis and one had a poliomyelitis-like paralytic illness. Various skin manifestations other than hand, foot and mouth disease occurred, especially in young children, and 25 patients had significant respiratory disease including at least 7 with pneumonia. Enterovirus 71 is one of very few viruses that cause hand, foot and mouth disease as well as a variety of other clinical manifestations.

  ".W": "To identify risk factors associated with hospitalization for acute lower respiratory tract illness, 102 children less than 2 years of age admitted to four Atlanta metropolitan area hospitals between December 1984 and June 1985 with the diagnosis of lower respiratory tract illness were studied. The most common causative agent associated with illness was respiratory syncytial virus, followed by other respiratory viruses, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The 102 case-patients were compared with 199 age- and sex-matched controls. A parent or guardian for each patient and control was interviewed by telephone regarding demographic data, care outside the home, breast-feeding, previous medical history, allergies, and smoking and illness in household members. Five factors were associated with lower respiratory tract illness in both a univariate analysis and a multiple logistic regression model (P less than .05). These factors were the number of people sleeping in the same room with the child, a lack of immunization the month before the patient was hospitalized, prematurity, a history of allergy, and regular attendance in a day-care center (more than six children in attendance). Care received outside of the home in a day-care home (less than or equal to six children in attendance) was not associated with lower respiratory tract illness. The suggestion made by our study and other studies was that for children less than 2 years of age, care outside of the home is an important risk factor for acquiring lower respiratory tract illness, as well as other infectious diseases, and that this risk can be reduced by using a day-care home instead of a day-care center.\r"

In this study, all children who were admitted to the emergency department with chest pain were evaluated prospectively. Patients with ill-defined chest pain had ECGs and echocardiograms performed. A total of 407 children were evaluated. The most common causes of the pain were idiopathic (21%) and musculoskeletal (15%). Cardiac problems were found in 4%. Chest pain was acute (of less than 48 hours' duration) in 43% and chronic (of greater than 6 months' duration) in 7%. Pain caused 30% of children to stay out of school and 31% to awaken from sleep. Chest wall tenderness was the most common abnormality. ECGs were obtained in 47%; results of 31/191 were abnormal but only 4/191 ECG abnormalities were related to the diagnosis. Echocardiograms were obtained in 34%; results of 17/139 were abnormal (12/139 showed mitral valve prolapse). Young children are more likely to have cardiorespiratory problems; children older than 12 years of age are more likely to have psychogenic pain. The description and location of the pain and the patient's sex are not related to the diagnosis. Nonorganic disease is related to a family history of heart disease or chest pain or having chronic pain. Organic disease is related to pain of acute onset, abnormal physical examination results, pain that awakens the child from sleep, and the presence of fever. Laboratory tests are rarely helpful in evaluating children with chest pain. Chest pain in children is usually benign. Psychogenic pain and idiopathic pain are less common than previously believed.\r"

In a nonconcurrent prospective study, the physical activity levels of 453 young men, 23 to 25 years of age, were compared with their physical fitness test scores as children (10 to 11 years of age and 15 to 18 years of age). The physically active adults had significantly better childhood physical fitness test scores than did the inactive adults. In 224 children, 2 years of fitness test results were available. The risk of physical inactivity in young adulthood was linearly related to the number of low scores on the 548.6-m (600-yd) run and sit-ups tests as children (P less than .001). In stepwise multivariate discriminant analysis, the childhood 548.6-m run score was the best discriminator between currently physically active and inactive adults. Reported parental encouragement of exercise, level of education, participation in organized sports after high school, and reported spousal encouragement of exercise also contributed significantly to the discriminant function. These results demonstrate that physical fitness testing in boys facilitates the identification of those at increased risk of becoming physically inactive young adults.\r"

Five babies with bilateral grade 3 to 4 intraventricular hemorrhage were compared with 15 preterm infants without intraventricular hemorrhage. Cerebral high-energy phosphorus metabolites and intracellular pH were measured with in vivo 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Spectra were collected initially within the first 2 weeks of life, and then every other week until discharged from the hospital. The phosphocreatine to inorganic phosphate ratio and the phosphocreatine to adenosine triphosphate ratio were significantly lower in the group with intraventricular hemorrhage, but differences in intracellular pH were not significant. Differences between babies with and without intraventricular hemorrhage varied with postconceptional age: in those with intraventricular hemorrhage, the phosphocreatine to adenosine triphosphate ratio was decreased at all postconceptional ages, and the phosphocreatine to inorganic phosphate ratio was lower in babies with intraventricular hemorrhage and younger than 30 weeks. Results of this study confirm the presence of chronic metabolic changes following intraventricular hemorrhage which may exacerbate neurologic damage after intraventricular hemorrhage in the newborn.\r"

The purpose of the study was to investigate changes in the perinatal characteristics and to evaluate the associated handicaps. All patients were assessed at least once in the Visually Impaired Program, British Columbia Children's Hospital. In the majority, the visual loss was profound. Since 1951, blinding retinopathy of prematurity has become a disease of progressively smaller and less mature infants. Since 1981, it has been almost entirely confined to infants of birth weight less than 1,000 g in British Columbia. The diagnosis of mild spastic diplegia was made more commonly in patients born after 1980 but, despite the progressive reduction in birth weight and gestational age during the study period, the number of patients without other associated handicaps remained constant (approximately 30%) during each successive decade.\r"

The ratio of serum bilirubin concentration to birth weight (the bilirubin divided by birth weight index [BBI]) was used to examine the impact of 25 variables on a clinical guideline for therapy of hyperbilirubinemia in newborn infants. A linear regression model was used; the most powerful covariate was a birth weight less than 1.0 kg. The only other variable that reduced the BBI was phenobarbital receipt. The presence of intraventricular hemorrhage and ecchymoses had a significant influence increasing the BBI.\r"

This occurs in experimental animals in which seizures and coma followed by death can be produced rapidly if sufficiently large doses are given. Finally, with smaller systemic doses as may occur with absorption during heavy topical use, there is also the possibility of a perturbation of ammonia metabolism. Diethyltoluamide may then pose a substantial hazard to individuals with defects in ammonia metabolism.\r"

Practice-based pediatric research promises to broaden the range and severity of conditions commonly studied, to enhance the study of the natural history of disease and of normal development, to provide normal controls and standards, and to facilitate recruitment of adequate sample sizes. Cohort, incidence, and health services research will be promoted by the development of patients registries. The Chicago area Pediatric Practice Research Group is a research consortium of 81 practitioners in 27 office practices. Formed in 1984, it receives logistic and financial support from Children's Memorial Hospital, with which it is affiliated. The Pediatric Practice Research Group has undertaken six studies, most with outside funding. During these studies, some unifying characteristics of practice-based research have emerged. These include the need to tailor study protocols to individual practice characteristics and routines and the critical role of office staff in the conduct of research. Features can be identified that make specific studies more or less intrusive into office functioning. It has proved feasible to obtain data of high quality and reproducibility despite geographically scattered data collection sites. This review of Pediatric Practice Research Group activities and experience is intended to open an exchange of ideas with others interested in practice-based research.\r"

The presence of clinically significant behavior problems could interfere with pediatric regimens for encopresis, however. To study the extent to which encopretic children exhibit behavior problems, we compared the scores on a standardized behavioral checklist for three randomly selected samples: a sample group of children with encopresis, a sample group of children with behavior problems, and a sample group of children without encopresis or behavior problems. All three samples were matched for age and gender. An analysis of variance showed that the scores of children with encopresis did not differ from the normative sample but were significantly lower than the scores from the behavior problem sample (P less than .00001). The results support the appropriateness of the trend toward expanding the primary pediatrician's role in the treatment of encopresis.\r"

Duodenal ulcers were more common than gastric ulcers (2.8:1). Ages ranged from 3 months to 17 years, with a mean age of 10 years. Patients were reviewed with respect to etiology of peptic ulcer disease, age when first examined, initial symptoms, and clinical course. Patients were divided into two groups, those with primary (n = 19) and those with secondary (n = 17) peptic ulcer disease. All peptic ulcers in patients younger than 10 years of age were secondary in nature. Secondary ulcers occurred generally in association with a severe underlying illness (11/17), and many ulcers necessitated emergency surgery because of perforation and/or severe hemorrhage (8/17). None of these patients had chronic or recurrent symptoms. In contrast, in children with primary peptic ulcer disease, initial symptoms were more benign. Most patients had abdominal pain and only one required emergency surgery. Children with primary duodenal ulcer disease had a high incidence of recurrent symptoms (67%), however, with surgery for intractable disease necessitated in 40%. Single-contrast barium meals were found to be unreliable in establishing a diagnosis of peptic ulcer disease, particularly cases of gastric ulcer disease.\r"

Of the 195 (24.7%) children identified by the checklist as disturbed, 126 were given a detailed psychiatric assessment using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, a structured psychiatric interview of known validity and reliability. A randomly selected group of 174 nondisturbed children was also assessed. The pediatricians' judgment about the presence of emotional and behavioral problems, made at the index clinic visit, was compared with diagnoses made from the computer-scored interviews. Pediatricians diagnosed one or more such problems in 5.6% of the children (weighted estimate: 95% confidence limits 3.8% to 7.6%), compared with 11.8% (95% confidence interval 9.3% to 13.5%) based on the interview with the parent. Pediatricians were highly specific, ie, 84% of children assessed as nondisturbed had no psychiatric disorder, but they showed low sensitivity, ie, they only identified 17% of the children with behavioral or emotional problems, giving a \"hidden morbidity rate\" of 83% (ie, 83% of cases were not identified). The role of primary care pediatricians in the identification, prevention and treatment of what has been called \"the new morbidity\" is discussed. We suggest that, on the basis of these findings, emotional and behavioral problems in children have to be seen as \"the new hidden morbidity.\"\r"

  ".W": "Data from a large epidemiologic survey of Ontario children 4 to 16 years of age are presented concerning the frequency and correlates the use of ambulatory medical care services during a 6-month period in which a universal, first-dollar health insurance plan was used. Patterns of use of ambulatory medical care are described for three settings: doctor's offices, emergency rooms, and hospital outpatient departments. A group of children who are frequent users of ambulatory medical care (defined as using three or more services in 6 months) consumed nearly two thirds of all services. Two regression equations are presented--one predicting use/nonuse of ambulatory medical care and the other predicting the total number of visits for medical care. Although only a small proportion of the variance in use/nonuse and amount of use was explained, the major determinant of both ambulatory medical care use and frequency of use was the child's physical health status as perceived by the parent. Younger child, urban area of residence, the number of chronic medical problems of the child, and higher level of maternal education also contributed to the explanation of use v nonuse. Among ambulatory medical care users, high users were more likely to be described as having mental health problems and have parents who had been treated for \"nerves.\" Family size and socioeconomic variables were not important factors in use, suggesting that universal health insurance reduces some barriers to ambulatory medical care for children.\r"

  ".W": "Levels of morbidity in 789 children 7 to 11 years of age attending two primary care pediatric clinics in a health maintenance organization were examined in relation to psychiatric disturbance. Physical morbidity was measured as mean number of illness episodes per year enrolled, based on the child's medical record. Two measures of psychiatric disturbance were compared: the pediatricians' judgment and a detailed assessment using standard psychiatric interviews with parent and child. Children identified by pediatricians as disturbed had more than twice as many physical illness episodes as nonidentified children. Children identified by the standard psychiatric assessment had the same number of physical illness episodes as nondisturbed children. Pediatricians showed high specificity but low sensitivity to mental illness. Their sensitivity in the high user group was double that in the low user group. These results suggest that (1) the association between mental illness and high use may be, in part, the result of the confounding factor of physicians' judgment; (2) in settings where primary care practitioners serve as \"gatekeepers\" to mental health services, the offset effect of lower medical service use following psychiatric treatment may be partially explained by this; (3) the source of referral must be taken into account when assessing the offset effect in other settings.\r"

A sample of 558 pediatricians selected at random and 385 members of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Section on Adolescent Health (SAH) completed a 41-item questionnaire. The physicians' perceived levels of skill in ten areas were analyzed while simultaneously assessing the impact of SAH membership, year of graduation from medical school, gender, and percentage of practice time devoted to adolescents on each issue. SAH members, as expected, ranked their levels of skill significantly higher than did the other pediatricians in all areas surveyed. A significant percentage of the SAH pediatricians, however, indicated that their skills were acquired through postresidency fellowship training. There was an increasing trend among all pediatricians in their perceived levels of skill to deliver health care to adolescents during the past several decades, but there has been no appreciable increase in such perceived skill levels since the task force issued its recommendations. In fact, pediatricians graduating from medical school in the decade prior to 1976 who are not SAH members ranked their skills higher than did non-SAH pediatricians who graduated in the past 10 years. These data lead to the conclusion that the recommendations of the Task Force on Pediatric Education have not been adequately implemented.\r"

The median amount of training was eight hours during the first and third years of training and seven hours during the second year; approximately half of this was clinical supervision in the care of maltreated children. Eighty-one percent of programs had an interdisciplinary team for suspected cases of child maltreatment. Only 17 of 167 programs reported a separate budget for their team. Although two thirds of programs were rated as adequate or better, 79% of respondents wanted to strengthen their teaching efforts. There appears to be a limited commitment by residency programs to enhance the competency of pediatricians in the area of child maltreatment. There is a need for improved training and resources.\r"

Internists provided more counseling than pediatricians and family/general practitioners about smoking and alcohol use, more than pediatricians about drug use and heart disease prevention, and more than family/general practitioners about weight control and nutrition. Pediatricians exceeded family/general practitioners in counseling about weight control and nutrition but did not exceed internists in any areas. For 11 of 15 topics, more than 75% of students reported receiving no counseling. Women were counseled for stress and contraception more frequently than men. Overall, topics most often discussed by physicians were exercise, nutrition, and breast self-examination. The topics most frequently requested by students were exercise, stress (women), depression, weight control (women) and sexually transmitted diseases (men). These data suggest that adolescents receive little health counseling from personal physicians, especially regarding topics leading to great morbidity and mortality for this age group. Pediatricians, especially, must increase the extent of counseling if they are to meet the American Academy of Pediatrics' goal of providing care to adolescents and young adults.\r"

The cause in the remaining two patients could not be determined with certainty, despite extensive laboratory investigations. Improvement began within four to 15 days after the initiation of therapy. No side effects were noticed in four patients throughout treatment (3 months to 36 months). In one patient, the medication had to be discontinued after 17 days, because of an allergic cutaneous rash. In view of our results, we propose that carbamazepine be considered as an alternative drug for the treatment of nonhereditary chorea.\r"

Seventy percent of all infants were breast-fed, with the mean duration of breast-feeding being almost 7 months. Factors positively associated with breast-feeding included education and marriage, whereas maternal employment outside the home and ethnicity (being Hispanic rather than Anglo-American) were related to bottle feeding. Solid foods were introduced earlier by Hispanics and, also, among less well educated and single women; maternal employment was unrelated to the introduction of solid foods. Multiple regression analysis indicated different patterns for the two ethnic groups: education and employment were related to almost all feeding practices for Anglo-Americans, whereas education and employment predicted few feeding practices for the Hispanics. These findings suggest that the effects of ethnicity are independent of those of education.\r"

Projections were based on the prescribing trends in the practice, the extent of patients' insurance reimbursement for prescriptions, the laws regarding dispensing, and the costs incurred when physicians purchase selected medications from a repackager or when patients procure them at a community pharmacy. Patients without insurance for prescriptions can potentially save money by purchasing medication at the physician's office but, in general, only if the physician's dispensing fee is minimal. Potential profits to physicians would be cut by an estimated 50% because of third-party enrollees choosing to have prescriptions filled at a pharmacy because of cost savings. Net profits are further reduced and may even be eliminated when the cost of physician and staff time to prepare, label, reorder, and maintain necessary records regarding dispensed medication are considered. Although it may be convenient for the patient to obtain initial supplies of medication at the time of an office visit, obtaining refills may be less convenient. The time and paperwork involved in dispensing by a physician cannot be considered as minimal interruptions in normal office procedure. The broad, attractive claims made in support of physician dispensing by physicians clearly overstate the benefits both to patients and to physicians.\r"

With advancing age, balance is lost among the bone, muscle, fat, and skin as progressive changes occur in their volume, shape, position, and consistency. Study of clinical cases and fresh cadaver dissections has led to better understanding of the superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) and its relationship with the facial muscles and their bony insertions. From these anatomic studies we have developed an improved concept of rhytidectomy with the subperiosteal detachment of all soft tissues from the orbit, upper maxilla, malar bone, and nose. Following this detachment, the soft tissues of the cheek, forehead, jowls, nasolabial folds, lateral canthus, and eyebrows can be lifted to reestablish their youthful relationship with the underlying skeleton. Our 4-year experience includes 105 patients. Sixty percent of these patients were admitted to the hospital and had their procedure under general anesthesia; forty percent, however, had their procedure in an outpatient setting requiring only local anesthesia (lidocaine hydrochloride 1% plus epinephrine) and intravenous sedation (midazolam, ketamine). Complications have been minimal except for temporary paralysis of the frontal nerve in seven patients; guidelines for prevention have subsequently been developed. The subperiosteal rhytidectomy is excellent and appears more natural for rejuvenation of the upper and central face, eyebrows, periorbita, external canthus, cheeks, and nasolabial fold.\r"

We propose a new technique of malar augmentation through the use of composite autogenous conchal cartilage grafts and temporalis fascia grafts. A case report and illustrations are presented, including a description of this technique. It is postulated that the use of autogenous materials in malar augmentation can give acceptable results and obviate the inherent risks associated with the use of alloplastic materials.\r"

Preoperative and postoperative videotaped samples of spoken words and connected speech were randomized and rated by two groups of listeners, only one of which knew of the surgery. Aesthetic appearance of speech or visual acceptability of the patient while speaking was judged from visual information only. Judgments of speech intelligibility were made from the auditory portion of the videotapes. Acceptability and intelligibility also were judged together during audiovisual presentation. Statistical analysis revealed that speech was significantly more acceptable aesthetically after surgery. No significant difference was found in speech intelligibility preoperatively and postoperatively. Ratings did not differ significantly depending on whether the rater knew of the surgery. Analysis of results obtained in various presentation modes revealed that the aesthetics of speech did not significantly affect judgment of intelligibility. Conversely, speech acceptability was greater in the presence of higher levels of intelligibility.\r"

  ".W": "The present experiment investigated whether observers' emotional and behavioral reactions to facially deformed patients could be substantially improved by surgical procedures conducted by well-trained specialists in an experienced multidisciplinary team. Also investigated was the hypothesis that emotional states mediate the effects of physical attractiveness and facial deformity on social interaction. Twenty patients between the ages of 3 months and 17 years were randomly selected from over 2000 patients' files of Kenneth E. Salyer of Dallas, Texas. Patient diagnoses included facial clefts, hypertelorism, Treacher Collins syndrome, and craniofacial dysostoses (Crouzon's and Apert's syndromes). Rigorously standardized photographs of patients taken before and after surgery were shown to 22 \"naive\" raters ranging in age from 18 to 54 years. Raters were asked to predict their emotional and behavioral responses to the patients. These ratings indicated that observers' behavioral reactions to facially deformed children and adolescents would be more positive following craniofacial surgery. Similarly, the ratings indicated that observers' emotional reactions to these patients would be more positive following surgery. The results are discussed in terms of current sociopsychologic theoretical models for the effects of attractiveness on social interaction. A new model is presented that implicates induced emotional states as a mediating process in explaining the effects of attractiveness and facial deformity on the quality of social interactions. Limitations of the current investigation and directions for future research are also discussed.\r"

Optimal repair requires adequate exposure, best obtained with transcolumellar flying-bird incisions. The major anatomic defect, the misplaced lateral crus, needs to be advanced to a normal position. The vestibular lining of the lateral crus should remain attached to add circulation and support, especially when scoring of the cartilage is needed. The lateral defect left after advancement of the lateral crus should be closed with sutures. Accessory procedures, including septoplasty, augmentation or reshifting of the alar base attachment, and occasionally, cartilage grafts, are critical to achieving an aesthetic result. Fifty-three patients operated on using the technique described are reviewed.\r"

Our experience with 35 consecutive cases of civilian gunshot wounds involving primarily the lower face is presented. Initial management included securing of the airway, control of bleeding, and treatment of coexisting injuries. After clinical and radiologic evaluation and conservative debridement of all devitalized tissues, the mandibular fractures were reduced and stabilized appropriately. Large bony defects were treated by stabilization of the mandibular segments followed by secondary bone grafting. Intraoral soft tissues were then repaired with local mucosal flaps or tongue flaps when necessary. Finally, the soft tissues were repaired by primary closure or local flaps. Distant flaps were used only as a secondary procedure. Our results are presented, the differences between civilian and military injuries are discussed, and the principles of gunshot ballistics are described. We conclude that most of these wounds can be treated in a relatively conservative manner immediately after the injury with good functional and cosmetic results.\r"

These experiments were carried out in 20 Sprague-Dawley male rats. In half the animals, a sensate myocutaneous flap was constructed by sandwiching the superficial inferior epigastric vessels between a laterally based external abdominal oblique muscle flap and a laterally based skin flap served by an identified cutaneous nerve. A similar preparation included a piece of iliac crest bone. Two to three weeks later, now neovascularized by the sandwiched vessels, the flaps were harvested and transferred as free flaps with high reliability. An increased number of potential donor sites, the versatility of design, and the ability to customize flaps to the specific recipient-site needs are proffered.\r"

  ".W": "In an attempt to decrease a 10 to 15 percent vascular thrombosis rate leading to graft occlusion, low-dose human-grade heparin was studied to determine if carefully monitored intravenous therapy would increase 7-day patency in a known potent thrombosis model. In New Zealand white rabbits, the type of infusate administered intravenously, either saline (30 animals) or heparin (35 animals), was selected at random after completing a 2-mm arterial inversion graft in the femoral artery. A 72-hour infusion was used in all animals; the control group received sterile saline and the experimental group received a heparin infusion at 45 microliters per hour after a 500-unit bolus. All grafts in both groups were patent at the time of groin closure. Patency in the heparin-perfused group was 67 percent (24 of 35) as compared to 19 percent (6 of 30) in the control group (p less than 0.05) 1 week postoperatively. Scanning electron microscopy showed significantly less dense fibrin deposition and a decrease in the number of aggregated platelets in the heparin-perfused grafts. Partial tissue thromboplastin time values in the experimental group ranged between 55 and 75 seconds (control 20 to 25 seconds). We have shown that heparin, an inexpensive and readily available agent, maintains 1-week microarterial patency and results in few complications in a reliable, reproducible, and versatile thrombosis model. The clinical ramifications of using an antiplatelet agent that diminishes fibrin deposition in microsurgery are apparent.\r"

The overall patency for intraarterial grafts at exploration was 98 percent and for intravenous grafts 100 percent. In comparison with the initial graft length resected, all four groups were significantly shorter at the completion of anastomosis, and three of the four groups also were significantly shorter at exploration. The overall loss in length of grafts varied between 26 and 30 percent of original length. External diameter was significantly increased (from between 133 and 201 percent) in all four groups at exploration compared to the normal femoral vein. Intravenous grafts maintained normal vein morphology to 12 months. Intraarterial grafts were modified by the ingrowth of smooth-muscle cells from the recipient artery, thereby creating a neointima that significantly thickened their walls at both 6 and 12 months.\r"

During the surgical procedure, the wounds were inoculated with a Staphylococcus aureus suspension containing either 1 x 10(4) or 1 x 10(5) organisms per milliliter. In half the animals, the grafts were wrapped with a distally based sartorius muscle flap before a standard two-layer closure was completed. One month after the surgery, all the animals were sacrificed and quantitative cultures were performed of the grafts and wounds. The muscle flaps were capable of protecting the vascular prosthesis with inoculums up to 1 x 10(4) organisms (p less than 0.05), but at greater bacterial contamination their efficacy was no longer significant.\r"

One or more branches of the middle division are constantly present and distribute over the upper two-thirds of the postauricular surface. These anatomic findings were compatible with the results of the Doppler probing. We have done four auricular reconstructions with postauricular arterial flaps with excellent postoperative results. It is worthwhile to use the postauricular arterial flap in restoring the middle third of the auricle.\r"

Follow-up of the initial 20 patients from 1983 to 1986 demonstrates good stability, grip strength, and pinch strength. Although compared with total great-toe transfer a modest reduction in joint motion of trimmed toes has been observed, the overall appearance and usefulness of the reconstructed thumbs have been excellent.\r"

MR imaging with T2 measurement was very useful for differentiating between hepatoma and hemangioma (including small lesions) at 1.5 T as well as at 0.35 T.\r"

  ".W": "To compare the advantages of one-view versus two-view second-screening (follow-up) mammography, oblique and craniocaudal projection mammograms from 1,000 consecutive asymptomatic women who had prior normal baseline studies were reviewed retrospectively, first with only the oblique images, then with the oblique and craniocaudal views. In women with dense breasts, one-view (oblique only) readings resulted in abnormal interpretations four times more frequently (53 cases, 5.3%) than two-view readings (13 cases, 1.3%). The induced cost from these abnormal interpretations would have more than offset the small savings in operating expense associated with one-view screening. In contrast, four times fewer abnormal one-view interpretations (13 cases, 1.3%) were made in women with primarily fatty breasts, in whom superimposition of dense tissue on images is not as frequently a problem. In these women, considering only cost, it may be reasonable to obtain a single mediolateral oblique projection for follow-up screening mammography. However, the issue of whether to implement such an approach remains unresolved, because the sensitivity of one-view versus two-view second screening in the detection of breast cancer has not yet been determined.\r"

One or more episodes of subluxation or dislocation may result in a tear, detachment, or attenuation of the glenoid labrum, stripping of the joint capsule from the scapula, or trauma to the tendons or muscles of the rotator cuff. A series of 27 shoulders examined with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showed changes of glenohumeral instability, which were confirmed with open or arthroscopic surgery. MR imaging was capable of displaying common types of pathologic conditions resulting from instability, including labral trauma, capsular detachment, and retraction of the subscapularis muscle. MR imaging is a valuable diagnostic tool for the evaluation of glenohumeral instability.\r"

Two osteoradiologists blindly graded the appearance of the peribursal fat plane with the shoulder in external versus internal rotation in 21 patients with arthrographically intact rotator cuffs and 21 patients with disrupted rotator cuffs. The peribursal fat plane was seen better with disrupted rotator cuffs. The peribursal fat plane was seen better with the shoulder in internal rotation and was seen in 60% of control subjects but only 21% of patients with rotator cuff tears. Partial or complete obliteration of this fat plane is a sensitive (79%) but less specific (60%) indicator of rotator cuff tears. Obliteration of the peribursal fat plane by inflammatory processes in adjacent tissues, including calcific tendinitis and rheumatoid arthritis, occurred with a high frequency.\r"

The authors initiated a prospective evaluation of digital arthrography of the glenohumeral joint in 28 patients with clinical manifestations suggesting rotator cuff tear because they believed that examination with this technique would allow more accurate definition of the precise status of the cuff. Fifteen patients had normal studies. Ten complete and three partial rotator cuff tears were demonstrated with digital technique, and the precise site of the tear was demonstrated in all of these cases. The results indicate that digital arthrography of the glenohumeral joint may have some advantages over standard arthrography in the delineation of complete and partial tears of the rotator cuff, particularly in defining the exact site of tears.\r"

SE imaging allowed detection of thrombi as small as 5 X 5 mm trapped within the percutaneous Greenfield, Simon nitinol, and TMA-wire facsimile filters; with the MP32-N Amplatz filter, a larger volume of thrombus (10 X 20-mm clots) was necessary for clot detection. GRE imaging allowed detection of intraluminal tilting of the percutaneous Greenfield and facsimile Amplatz (TMA-wire) filters. GRE imaging was useful for demonstrating postfilter turbulence due to clots, which was greatest for the Amplatz filter. Imaging of facsimile vascular devices made of tantalum or TMA wire did not cause the severe \"black-hole\" MR artifacts typical of the stainless-steel devices. SE and GRE imaging were very useful for determining caval patency in two patients with previously placed Mobin-Uddin filters. Noninvasive MR evaluation of blood vessels in the presence of a variety of low-artifact intravascular devices appears feasible.\r"

Because of heat accumulation in subsurface tissue layers the metal probe caused a three to four times larger zone of thermal necrosis surrounding the tissue defect. Clinically both contact probes revealed similar results. The initial rate of recanalization of femoropopliteal artery occlusions with a mean length of 8 cm was 78% (metal probe) to 82% (sapphire probe), and the perforation rate was 14% (metal probe) to 8% (sapphire probe). Doppler ultrasound examinations after 6 months revealed a patency rate of 84%.

  ".W": "Forceful local pulsatile infusion of fibrinolytic enzyme disrupts thrombi, increases clot surface area, and thereby hastens enzyme action compared with conventional constant infusion methods, which are time consuming and therefore expensive. Prolonged thrombolytic therapy is associated with increased patient morbidity. A prototype for a clinically applicable pulsatile jet infusion system for accelerating thrombolysis was designed. The system is adaptable to standard angiographic catheters and techniques. The core of the system is a reciprocating syringe pump that delivers small volumes of thrombolytic enzyme in short, rapid, frequent pulses at high exit-jet velocity through any side-hole catheter (the smallest used was a 3-F catheter). Comparison of this system with a constant infusion system was made in vivo in a 48-hour-old thrombus model in rabbit inferior vena cava (IVC). One hour of lysis by streptokinase was conducted with each of the methods. In the first experiment, the IVC thrombi were left intact before chemical lysis. Pulsatile infusion lysed 61% of the thrombus by weight in an hour, whereas constant infusion lysed only 15% (P less than .001). In the second experiment, IVC thrombi were subjected initially to standardized mechanical perturbation by a guide wire before chemical lysis. In the latter experiment, pulsatile infusion lysed 54% of the thrombus by weight, and constant infusion lysed only 26% (P less than .005). The difference in percentage of lysis by weight between pulsatile infusion groups in the two experiments (61% vs 54%) was not significant (P greater than .1). The same was true of the difference between the two constant infusion groups (26% vs 15%, P greater than .05). The effect of initial perturbation of the thrombus by a guide wire appears to be less important than the thrombus disruption and accelerated thrombolysis caused by the pulsatile delivery system. No angiographic or macroscopically visible damage was seen in any IVC. Accelerated thrombolysis may reduce the expense, duration, and morbidity associated with conventional constant infusion methods.\r"

Findings from surgery (n = 23), needle biopsy (n = 1), or clinical follow-up (n = 8) were used for verification. Of 24 patients with primary thyroid carcinoma, 15 had recurrence and nine had a normal postsurgical thyroid bed. Diagnosis from MR images was correct in 20 cases, but false positive in three and false negative in one. Local recurrence was characterized by low to medium intensity on short repetition time (TR)/short echo time (TE) images and medium to high intensity on long TR/long TE images. Scar in the normal postsurgical thyroid bed showed low intensity on both short and long TR/TE images. Local recurrence of thyroid carcinoma and lymph node metastasis produced positive contrast compared with muscle on short TR/short TE (31 + 19%) and long TR/long TE (85 + 30%) images; fibrosis produced negative contrast, particularly on long TR/long TE (-56, -80%) images. These results indicate the capability of MR imaging in the evaluation of recurrence of thyroid tumors and in the differentiation of abnormal tissue due to tumor recurrence from postoperative fibrosis by means of signal contrast relative to a reference tissue.\r"

Specimens were cut and correlated directly with MR images. The appearance of the pseudocapsule was classified into four types: A, intact and even thickness around the tumor; B, only partially present or even absent; C, intact but with uneven thickness; D, partially destroyed by tumor. MR imaging findings corresponded precisely with those of gross pathologic examination in all cases but four of adenoma. Type A pseudocapsules were found only in adenoma and type D only in papillary carcinoma. Although the number of cases in the series was limited, the authors conclude that MR images reflect gross pathologic findings well and that some characteristic findings are suggestive of benign or malignant disease.\r"

The PCA test overcomes three major problems with the ICA technique. First, with the PCA technique, memory testing is begun immediately after injection, when the drug has its peak effect. Second, when the speech-dominant hemisphere is being tested with the PCA test, patients do not become aphasic. Third, injection into the PCA delivers the drug more effectively to the target, the ipsilateral hippocampal formation.\r"

In all but one patient, MR imaging eventually revealed an abnormality within the pons; in two patients the initial study was normal. The lesions varied in shape, with peripheral involvement in two patients and extrapontine involvement in four. The abnormality was smaller at 6-month follow-up in one patient and unchanged at 1 year in another. One patient never had a demonstrable pontine lesion but did have symmetric basal ganglia abnormalities, which were consistent with extrapontine myelinolysis. MR imaging disclosed similar central pontine alterations resulting from infarct, metastasis, glioma, multiple sclerosis, encephalitis, and radiation or chemotherapy; thus, such changes are not unique.\r"

All GEA images were obtained with a long echo time and short flip angle to emphasize T2*-based contrast. In 30 of 61 cases, GEA images demonstrated more hemorrhagic lesions than SE images. In 14 of 61 cases, GEA images failed to depict the lesion or obscured the specific diagnosis (as depicted by SE MR imaging). The authors believe that GEA imaging in its current form has a limited but definite adjunctive role in the evaluation of intracranial hemorrhage at high field strength.\r"

Eight children of similar age (four premature infants and four full-term infants) with normal neurologic development served as controls. A characteristic triad of PVL abnormalities was seen on MR images: (a) abnormally increased periventricular white-matter signal intensity on the first and second echo images of a T2-weighted sequence (repetition time = 2,000-2,400 msec, echo times = 20 or 30 and 80 msec), most commonly observed in the trigone regions of the lateral ventricles bilaterally; (b) marked loss of periventricular white matter in these regions of abnormal signal intensity, predominantly in the periatrial regions; and (c) compensatory focal ventricular enlargement adjacent to regions of abnormal signal intensity. In patients with the classic periatrial distribution of PVL lesions, general correlation between the degree of neurologic impairment and the severity of MR abnormalities was demonstrated. MR imaging was useful in detecting subtle forms of PVL in cases in which neurologic damage was subclinical.\r"

Shortening of the inversion time (TI) and creation of a short-TI inversion-recovery (STIR) pulse sequence increases sensitivity to malignancy and other abnormalities by making the effects of prolonged T1 and T2 on signal intensity additive and by nulling the signal from fat. The authors examined over 300 patients with various malignancies and compared STIR images with T1- and T2-weighted images obtained at 0.5 T. In 43 cases, signal-difference-to-noise ratios (SD/Ns) were calculated between tumor, fat, and muscle. In general, STIR images demonstrated tumor as a conspicuously high-intensity area in a background of muted, discernible anatomic detail. The good contrast achieved with STIR sequences between tumor and fat (SD/N = 18.1) and tumor and muscle (SD/N = 12.9) consolidated into a single image the information contained separately on T1- and T2-weighted images, which facilitates efficient detection and localization of malignancy.\r"

The resulting nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion profiles allowed the prediction of tissue contrast and efficacy of contrast agents at any field strength. Pure T1 contrast of normal brain tissue and pathologic lesions (multiple sclerosis, astrocytoma) increased from low field strengths to a maximum between 10 and 20 MHz and decreased afterward. Quadripolar dips reflecting the interaction between water and nitrogen atoms of the protein backbone appeared at 2.15 and 2.8 MHz, reducing T1 and opening the possibility of shorter imaging times and better tissue discrimination at these field strengths. Furthermore, it was shown that zero T1 contrast between normal and pathologic tissue samples may exist at certain field strengths. Gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid and gadolinium tetraazacyclododecanetetraacetic acid provided different contrast enhancement depending on the field strength.\r"

Out of 43 patients, two did not complete therapy. Forty-one patients completed the eradicative phase of treatment. Complete tumor clearance at the end of the eradicative treatment phase was 88% (36 of 41 patients), 95% (18 of 19) in group 1 and 82% (18 of 22) in group 2. Actuarial recurrence-free survival was 61% at 3 years.

Limb ischemia arose in 20%, with incidence uninfluenced by catheter insertion technique (percutaneous v. 'open'). Surgical treatment was required for half of the ischemic limbs. Groin hematoma commonly followed percutaneous extraction of IABP catheter, whereas 'open' removal was always hemostatic, with potential for embolectomy. Percutaneous insertion of IABP catheter via the femoral artery is the method of choice in an emergency situation. 'Open' Seldinger technique is preferable in the operating room. For elective IABP catheter removal, the 'open', hemostatic technique is recommended. If limb-threatening ischemia develops, the catheter must be removed. If the patient is IABP-dependent, the contralateral femoral artery or the ascending aorta should be considered as an alternative catheter route.\r"

Following valve replacement, however, preoperative values were not regained during this period, which was attributed to continuous mechanical trauma by the artificial valves. A 50% reduction of red cell filterability from the end of CPB to 12 and 24 hours from the start of CPB was associated with heavy blood loss (greater than 1,000 ml) from drains.

The currently preferred procedure is to operate as early as possible in infancy, using perfusion at 30 degrees C with ventricular fibrillation and without cross-clamping of the aorta. Wide mobilization of the pulmonary artery probably prevents stenosis at the end-to-side anastomosis.\r"

At follow-up after a mean of 12.3 years there was no recurrence of benign growth, but in two cases with initial diagnosis of chondroma a regrowth at the same site proved to be chondrosarcoma. Among the cases of malignant tumour there was one operative death from pulmonary embolism, after radical resection of sarcoma. None of the four patients with chondrosarcoma had recurrence 6-13 years after surgery. There was no long-term survival among the patients with other forms of sarcoma or malignant tumour of the reticuloendothelial system.\r"

This method makes use of crystallographic phases determined from measurements made at several wavelengths and has recently been made technically feasible through the use of intense, polychromatic synchrotron radiation together with accurate data collection from multiwire electronic area detectors. In contrast with all of the conventional methods of solving protein structures, which require either multiple isomorphous derivatives or coordinates of a similar structure for molecular replacement, this technique allows direct solution of the classical \"phase problem\" in x-ray crystallography. MAD phase assignment should be particularly useful for determining structures of small to medium-sized metalloproteins for which isomorphous derivatives are difficult or impossible to make. The structure of this particular protein provides new insights into the spectroscopic and redox properties of blue copper proteins, an important class of metalloproteins widely distributed in nature.\r"

Cells clamped from -80 to 0 millivolts displayed initial phasic and subsequent tonic contractions; caffeine reduced or abolished the phasic and enlarged the tonic contraction. The rate of relaxation from tonic contractions was steeply voltage-dependent and was significantly slowed in the absence of a sarcolemmal Na+ gradient. Tonic contractions elicited in the absence of a Na+ gradient promptly relaxed when external Na+ was applied, reflecting activation of Na+-Ca2+ exchange. It appears that a voltage-dependent Na+-Ca2+ exchange can rapidly mechanically relax mammalian heart muscle.\r"

The brains had many defects, particularly in the anterior structures of the cerebrum, including the olfactory lobes. Craniofacial malformations in the form of facial clefts also commonly occurred. Furthermore, heterozygotes of this line, with only one copy of the DNA insertion, and other transgenic lines carrying the same DNA construct appeared normal, suggesting that in the PHT1-1 line a gene significant in mammalian development has been disrupted.\r"

To study the kinetics and the mechanism of calcium-induced inactivation of calcium channels, a \"caged\" calcium compound, dimethoxy-nitrophen was used to photo-release about 50 microM calcium ion within 0.2 millisecond in dorsal root ganglion neurons. When divalent cations were the charge carriers, intracellular photo-release of calcium inactivated the calcium channel with an invariant rate [time constant (tau) approximately equal to 7 milliseconds]. When the monovalent cation sodium was the charge carrier, photorelease of calcium inside or outside of the cell blocked the channel rapidly (tau approximately equal to 0.4 millisecond), but the block was greater from the external side. Thus the kinetics of calcium-induced calcium channel inactivation depends on the valency of the permeant cation. The data imply that calcium channels exist in either of two conformational states, the calcium- and sodium-permeant forms, or, alternatively, calcium-induced inactivation occurs at a site closely associated with the internal permeating site.\r"

Since allelic loss can be erroneously scored in nonhomogeneous samples, tumor cell populations were first microdissected from 24 colorectal carcinomas, an additional nine cancers were engrafted in nude mice, and nuclei were flow-sorted from an additional two. Of 31 cancers informative for chromosome 5 markers, only 6 (19%) showed loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 5 alleles, compared to 19 of 34 (56%) on chromosome 17, and 17 of 33 (52%) on chromosome 18. Therefore, it appears that (i) FPC is a true dominant for adenomatosis but not a common recessive gene for colon cancer; and (ii) simple Mendelian models involving loss of alleles at a single locus may be inappropriate for understanding common human solid tumors.\r"

Tryptic cleavage of the enzyme generates an inactive 64-kilodalton (kD) fragment that can be further cleaved to form a constitutively active, calmodulin-independent, 61-kD fragment. Microsequencing and amino acid analysis of purified peptides after proteolysis of the 61- and 64-kD fragments were used to determine the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal sequences of the 64-kD fragment. Cleavage within the calmodulin-binding region at Arg505 generates the catalytically inactive 64-kD fragment, which is incapable of binding calmodulin. Further digestion removes a carboxyl-terminal fragment, including the pseudosubstrate sequence Ser484-Lys-Asp-Arg-Met-Lys-Lys-Tyr-Met- Ala-Arg-Arg-Lys-Trp-Gln-Lys-Thr-Gly-His-Ala-Val-Arg505 and results in a calmodulin-independent 61-kD fragment. Both the 61- and 64-kD fragments have the same primary amino-terminal sequences. These results provide direct support for the concept that the pseudosubstrate structure binds the active site and that the role of calmodulin is to modulate this interaction. Pseudosubstrates may be utilized in analogous ways by other allosterically regulated enzymes.\r"

This effect was entirely ipsilateral to the lesion and most prominent in the rostral paraventricular nucleus and related nuclei. Moreover, AVP and AVP mRNA were found to be colocalized with oxytocin in a few neurons. These results indicate that mRNA expression is modulated by synaptic influences and raise the possibility that synaptically mediated selection of neuronal phenotypes is a dynamic feature of the mature central nervous system.\r"

  ".U": "88305459\r", 
  ".W": "We present an analysis of 42 cases of acute rupture of the diaphragm by blunt trauma. There were 31 men (74%) and 11 women (26%); the mean age was 32.8 years +/- 2.4 SEM. At admission, hypovolemic shock was present in 45% of the cases, pelvic fracture in 36%, and severe respiratory distress in 21%. Diaphragmatic rupture was suggested before operation by unilateral elevation of the diaphragm, supradiaphragmatic densities, and displacement of abdominal organs into the thorax, as shown by chest films and GI series in 18 cases (43%). The left hemidiaphragm was injured in 24 cases (57%), the right in 15 (36%), and both sides in three (7%). Of the 17 patients (40%) found to have an abdominal organ in the thorax, 12 had had a left-sided rupture. Only four patients (10%) had solitary diaphragmatic injuries. Associated injuries (usually two or more) occurred in 38 cases (90%); they were abdominal in 34, musculoskeletal in 26, neurologic in 16, and thoracic in nine. The injuries were repaired through a celiotomy in 33 cases, by thoracotomy in six, and by separate celiotomy and thoracotomy in three. Postoperative complications occurred in 29 cases, the most common being pulmonary (18), systemic sepsis (six), and recurrent bleeding (three). There were 14 deaths, for a mortality of 33%. Seven were operative and due to massive hemorrhage; the late deaths were caused by systemic sepsis in five and neurologic trauma in two. We conclude that (1) diaphragmatic rupture after blunt trauma must be suspected when specific radiologic findings are present; (2) solitary diaphragmatic injuries seldom occur; (3) in most cases, morbidity or mortality is caused by the severity of the associated injuries; and (4) most diaphragmatic injuries can be repaired through a celiotomy, and all of them should be repaired to avoid the sequela of entrapment of abdominal organs in the thorax.\r"

Of these 93 patients, 42 had pulmonary angiograms, ten of which were positive. Of the 51 patients with necessary but inconclusive scans, five were poor candidates for angiography, 15 had other indications for anticoagulation, seven refused the study, and 24 had physicians who considered further studies unwarranted. Patients with and without pulmonary angiography were demographically and clinically similar. Although confirmatory testing such as pulmonary angiography was used frequently (45%) after an inconclusive lung scan, the question of pulmonary embolism was often left unanswered (55%). Methods for linking clinical judgment to lung scan results are necessary to select proper patients for invasive confirmatory testing.\r"

Both AIS girls and controls in pubertal stages 3 and 4 showed an increase of measured GH compared with girls in pubertal stage 2. Among the girls in pubertal stage 2, more GH was secreted in the AIS group than in the controls. It is concluded that it is only in early puberty (stage 2) that girls with AIS have a higher endogenous secretion of GH than normal girls, which implies an earlier growth spurt in scoliotic girls.\r"

ISIS and the Scoliometer were used to record angle of trunk inclinations (ATIs) in 13 patients with idiopathic scoliosis. Two standard positions were used: standing erect (for ISIS) and sitting forward bending (for the Scoliometer). In the lumbar region, a positional change in ATI between standing erect and sitting forward is revealed; it is related to the type and side of mainly compensatory spinal curves. It does not correlate with Cobb angle but it does correlate with each of spinous process rotation (Bunnell) and pedicular rotation (Perdriolle). In the thoracic region, the change from a standing-erect to a sitting-forward-bending position, in contrast, shows a statistically significant reduction of the hump on the convexity of the spinal curve. The findings have relevance to screening tests for scoliosis.\r"

It was observed that the deposition of bone followed lines of force, according to Wolff's Law. The greatest amounts of bone at the apex of the curve on the concave side indicate that flexion-compression forces are greater at this point. Further, it was observed that usually the fusion mass, seen in section, has a hollow \"box-section\" shape, which means that a resorption of unstressed central bone occurs. The hypothesis that the torsional forces are the predominant forces acting on the scoliotic spine can explain the characteristic \"box-section\" of the CT scans obtained.\r"

Motion was measured in lateral radiograms taken with the patient in different positions and while performing various exercises. The extreme angle in extension and flexion in each motion segment, in any of the exercises, was measured and the sum of this maximal motion in each segment, between occiput and C6, was noted (maximal cervical motion). Distraction-compression forces across the neck were studied simultaneously with the motion study in the last 20 patients of the series. Strain gauges were mounted on the two vertical rods of the halo-vest and the forces were correlated to the motion of the spine. We found a mean maximal cervical motion of 51 degrees (about 70% of the normal motion). The halo-vest restricted the motion the most below C2 and the least above C2. In the supine position, all patients had a distraction force across the neck (mean: 51 N) that decreased in some exercises (eg, sitting, standing) and increased in others (eg, arm lifting, shoulder shrugging). Both the motion and the force varied widely between different types of exercises. There was a maximal variation of 175 N between the exercises. A positive correlation was found (r = 0.8) between the distraction force in the supine position and the maximal cervical motion. No significant differences of motion in the cervical spine were found between the rehabilitation exercises and common activities of daily living.\r"

On average, L4-L5 and L3-L4 level discs showed more degeneration than discs at other lumbar levels. These macroscopic findings corroborate radiographic data from epidemiologic studies. The calculations suggest that higher mechanical stress, perhaps combined with longer nutritional pathways, may be responsible for the earlier degeneration of male discs.\r"

  ".U": "88305540\r", 
  ".W": "The fluid content of the intervertebral disc is important in determining its mechanical response and also its transport and biologic properties. Fluid content depends on the proteoglycan content of the tissue and on the relationship of the external load to the disc's swelling pressure. The influence of proteoglycan content and external load on the hydration of nuclei from 32 human lumbar discs was measured. Swelling pressure of the same specimens was measured by equilibrium dialysis. The influence of age (14-91 years) and spinal level was noted. Proteoglycan content of the discs fell with age, and for all spines tested, proteoglycan content was lowest in the L5-S1 disc; no systematic change in collagen content was found. The hydration of the discs, as received, also fell with increase in age; in each complete lumbar spine tested, the L1-L2 and the L5-S1 discs had the lowest hydration at postmortem examination. As the stress applied to the discs was increased, hydration decreased. Although a stress of 0.10-0.23 MPa maintained the disc slices at their postmortem hydration, under a stress of about 0.6-0.8 MPa, most discs lost 40-60% of their initial fluid. The relationship between change in hydration and swelling pressure was found to depend on the composition of the disc rather than on age or degree of degeneration; the relationship between equilibrium hydration and swelling pressure could be predicted satisfactorily for a disc of known collagen and proteoglycan content.\r"

The posture in an upright and in a forward position was described by means of seven variables, measured by an inclinometer. Posture changes between these positions were then compared for the three types of chairs. No significant influence from the chairs on posture changes was observed. Thus, no variation in spinal stress can be anticipated during forward-reaching movements in any of the three types of chair.

The first sign of a pressure increase--the critical size--occurred at a cross-sectional area of the cauda equina of 77 +/- 13 mm2. To achieve a pressure increase of 50 mm Hg, the cross-sectional area of the cauda equina had to be further constricted at an average of 19 +/- 8%. The corresponding constriction needed to achieve a pressure of 100 mm Hg was 26 +/- 8%. The results indicated that constriction of the cauda equina to a size less than 75 mm2 probably will affect the normal function of the nerve roots of the cauda.\r"

In a prospective study of 55 patients suffering from unilateral sciatica this sign was evaluated. Two aspects were investigated: 1) the interobserver variation, and 2) the correlation between the result of the test and the surgical finding. There was considerable interobserver variation among three observers concerning the measured angle at which pain was elicited. However, in 2/3 to 3/4 of the cases the variation amounted to 10 degrees or less. There was also some discordance in the classification of the type of pain that was elicited. Fifty-two patients underwent surgery; 45 had a prolapsed disc. SLR was \"positive\" in 49 cases, 43 of whom harbored a prolapsed disc. Crossed SLR was noted in 20, 19 of whom had a prolapsed disc at surgery. Absence of SLR limitation does not preclude the presence of a herniated lumbar disc.\r"

In addition, unilateral median nerve stimulation at the wrist was carried out to act as a control. Six cases with significant intraoperative alterations in wave-form and their postoperative neurologic status are described in detail. EP monitoring permits continuous monitoring of the patient for the total duration of operation and is therefore superior to the wake-up test. This method is particularly advisable for operations carried out in hypotensive anaesthesia as well as for postoperative control.\r"

When scoliosis radiography (PA-projection) was performed on 25 adolescent patients, the photofluorographs were found to be of comparable diagnostic quality with full-size films. A close correspondence between the imaging techniques was found in the Cobb angle measurements as well as in the grading of rotation with the pedicle method. The use of photofluorography results in a radiation dose reduction of about one-half and considerable savings in direct imaging costs and archive space. In our opinion the method is particularly well-suited for follow-up and screening evaluation of scoliosis, but in tall patients the image field size of 40 x 40 cm restricts its usefulness as initial examination.\r"

In patients with thoracic curves the degrees of thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis were significantly less than those of the controls. Neither the kyphosis nor the lordosis were correlated to the Cobb angles. Even patients with small curves have straight spines in the sagittal plane; there is no tendency for the kyphosis and lordosis to decrease when the scoliotic deformity increases. This indicates that it is especially individuals with straight spines in the sagittal plane who are prone to develop scoliosis. It is also suggested that the limitation in spinal function for curves with Cobb angles below 50 degrees may be neglected.\r"

One patient died during the surgery and the remaining nine patients were followed for a mean of 7 years 4 months to skeletal maturity. The most successful methods of internal fixation were either by two Harrington distraction rods combined with compression across the osteotomy site (Group 3) or by a posteriorly applied AO plate (Group 2). A long posterior fusion extending from the mid-thoracic region to the sacrum was necessary to provide long-term stability and prevent the development of a thoracic lordosis. At skeletal maturity, all seven patients in Groups 2 and 3 had a flat back without pressure sores and all were able to sit upright without using their arms for support.\r"

Sixty-seven of the remaining 69 patients (97%) were subjected to the follow-up performed with validated protocols. All patients but three were reexamined clinically and radiographically. Flexion-extension motion and sidebending of the neck was measured radiographically. Rotation was measured with the aid of a compass placed on top of the head of the patient. Forty-four patients (53%) had initial neurological deficit, 26 with tetraparesis. The age range was 13-89 years and the male/female ratio was 2/1. The halo-vest treatment period was 10-12 weeks. The 1 year healing rate was 90%. Seven nonunions occurred, all in fracture types known to be prone to nonunion. Complications during the treatment were usually minor, with pin problems being the most frequent (pin loosening 60%). At the follow-up, approximately 80% of all patients had complaints of local neck symptoms. Pain at the extremes of neck motion and stiffness was the most frequent. The symptoms were mild and did not usually have any major impact on return to work or leisure activities. Seventy-five percent of patients with incomplete cord lesions and useless muscle function improved to useful function. The patients had a statistically significant decrease of rotation (18%) and sidebending (18%) of the neck but normal flexion-extension motion when compared to the normal.\r"

Exponential analysis of static pressure-volume data obtained during deflation of the lungs gave the exponent K, an index of distensibility. Total lung capacity (TLC) was measured in a body plethysmograph. At entry into the longitudinal study means values for K and static recoil pressure in the 39 smokers available for follow up were similar to those obtained in the original group of 101 smokers (73 men), mean age 42 (SD 11) years, in the cross sectional study. Over the interval of the study, ln K and TLC increased and FEV1 decreased at rates greater than those found in a previous longitudinal study of 34 non-smokers (24 men), mean age 42 (SD 15) years. In the longitudinal study of smokers the observed changes in K and in recoil pressure over the interval of study were greater than the values obtained from the regression slopes found in the cross sectional study of smokers. On the basis of the regression model used previously in the longitudinal study of non-smokers, the age coefficient for ln K was greater than that found in the non-smokers (p less than 0.01). The regression model also showed that the slope of ln K on age increased in older subjects. Because K is related to peripheral airspace size, a rapid rate of increase in K identifies smokers in whom airspace size is increasing abnormally rapidly. In this study the rate of increase in K and the variation between subjects was sufficient to explain the magnitude of the increased pulmonary distensibility found in cigarette smokers who present with emphysema.\r"

We obtained lung sections from necropsy material from the group with severe disease, and from surgical specimens in the group with mild to moderate disease, and compared the structure of the vasculature in these groups with that obtained from surgical specimens in a non-smoking control group of seven patients. Oxygen administration either at rest or during exercise did not greatly affect the pulmonary arterial pressures. When cardiac index was plotted against pulmonary artery pressure at rest and during exercise and extrapolated to the axis there was no evidence for a critical closing pressure in either group. The vessels in the groups with mild to moderate and severe chronic obstructive lung disease showed intimal thickening (each 19% (SD 0.5%)) by comparison with the non-smoking group (16% (0.5%]. The group with severe disease, in addition, had medial hypertrophy (27% (0.5%) versus 24% (SD 1%) in the non-smoking group). These data are consistent with the idea that the diseased vessels are distorted and rigid. The lack of effect of breathing oxygen on the vascular response at rest and during exercise suggests that hypoxic vasoconstriction has a minimal role in the pulmonary hypertension of chronic obstructive lung disease. The data suggest that the intimal changes could narrow the vessel calibre in those patients with mild to moderate disease, and that the thickened media present in the vessels from patients with severe disease may act in concert with the enlarged intima to produce more severe vascular obstruction.\r"

Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D was subnormal in eight patients, of whom five were receiving vitamin D supplements in standard doses. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and parathyroid hormone concentrations showed no consistent abnormalities. The bone mineral index was lower in patients with cystic fibrosis (p less than 0.02) than in controls. Five patients with unequivocally reduced bone mineral index had a subnormal mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and significantly worse lung function than the other patients. There was a positive correlation between age and bone mineral index (r = 0.68, p less than 0.001). Thus a significant proportion of patients with cystic fibrosis living in a temperate climate are at risk of vitamin D deficiency. Osteopenia is common and is probably related to a combination of hypovitaminosis D, delay in puberty, hypo-oestrogenism in women, and reduced physical activity, rather than to secondary hyperparathyroidism. Since most patients with deficiency of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were receiving oral supplements, parenteral vitamin D supplementation may be appropriate for selected patients who are unable to maintain adequate 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations despite oral vitamin D supplements.\r"

Twenty eight were typical carcinoid tumours and 25 well differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas. Twenty seven were DNA diploid and 26 DNA aneuploid. DNA aneuploidy was significantly associated with histological features of increased malignant potential. Survival data were available for 43 patients. Of the 19 with DNA diploid tumours, 16 survived five years, compared with 14 of 24 with DNA aneuploid tumours--the difference being at the borderline of statistical significance. In a Cox multivariate regression analysis with other histological variables, DNA ploidy did not confer independent prognostic information. It is concluded that, although DNA aneuploidy as determined by flow cytometry is an indicator of increased malignant potential in bronchopulmonary carcinoid tumours, it does not provide clinically useful information additional to the results of routine histological examination.\r"

The patients were maintained under superficial ether narcosis and they were given morphine (0.5 mg/kg) and tubocurarine (0.5-1.0 mg/kg). The duration of circulatory arrest was 30 minutes in 190 and longer in 153 patients--60-77 minutes in 10 patients. It took an average of 7.6 minutes for resumption of normal cardiac activity after circulatory arrest prolonged beyond 60 minutes. Of the 343 patients operated on 32 (9.3%) died. Analysis of the mortality pattern showed that patients with acute cardiac insufficiency contributed most to the total number of deaths (19 patients, 5.5%); those with pulmonary oedema ranked second (4 patients, 1.2%) and those with brain oedema third (3 patients, 0.9%). Neurological complications were observed in 13 patients (3.8%). Their frequency was significantly related to the duration of circulatory arrest. Circulatory inadequacy in patients with poor myocardial function who had undergone extensive repair appeared to be a contributory factor. The results obtained without perfusion under deep (26-25 degrees C) hypothermic protection suggest that 75 minutes is a safe time, in terms of brain damage, for circulatory arrest. Under these conditions complex cardiac defects can be repaired.\r"

  ".W": "This paper describes a rebreathing method for the simultaneous measurement of oxygen consumption (VO2) and effective pulmonary blood flow (QP. eff) at rest and during exercise. Subjects rebreathed a test gas consisting of 35% oxygen, 3.5% chlorodifluoromethane (freon-22), and 10% argon in nitrogen for 30 seconds or until the respired oxygen tension fell to below 13.3 kPa. Sixty normal subjects were studied on a motorized treadmill, the Bruce protocol being used. The rebreathing manoeuvre was performed at three minute intervals, and was initially practised sitting down. Measurements were then made with the subjects standing at rest, and subsequently during the last minute of each stage of the Bruce exercise protocol until the subjects were exhausted. Heart rate was recorded from the electrocardiogram. Oxygen uptake plotted against calculated power (watts) showed a discontinuity between resting and exercise values, probably because power output during treadmill exercise is underestimated. The arbitrary addition of 30 watts to the exercise power output abolished this discontinuity. There was good agreement between rebreathing estimates of oxygen consumption and values measured during a second exercise test by the conventional open circuit argon dilution method. Coefficients of variation of oxygen consumption and effective pulmonary blood flow measured by rebreathing were usually less than 10% even during maximal exertion. At rest mean (SD) effective pulmonary blood flow corrected for body surface area was 2.2 (0.46) l/min/m2. Effective pulmonary blood flow rose linearly with oxygen consumption. At rest the arteriovenous oxygen content difference for pulmonary blood (VO2/QP eff) was 9.1 (1.6) ml/dl, rising to a maximum of 16.4 (1.8) ml/dl. The stroke volume index was 27.5 (6.8) ml/m2, rising to a maximum of 46.5 (7.1) ml/m2 during exertion.\r"

  ".W": "Cardiovascular complications are common in fibrosing alveolitis, but there have been few physiological studies of the pulmonary circulation in this condition, and those that have been carried out have usually depended on right heart catheterisation. This paper reports non-invasive measurements of effective pulmonary blood flow, oxygen uptake, pulmonary arteriovenous oxygen content differences, and estimates of mixed venous oxygen saturation in 20 patients with histologically proved cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis at rest and while exercising on a motorized treadmill. Results were compared with those of 20 age and sex matched normal subjects, at rest and at an arbitrarily chosen oxygen uptake of 0.75 l/min. The latter results were obtained by linear interpolation. Effective pulmonary blood flow was normal at rest, but oxygen dispatch to the tissues (blood flow x blood oxygen content) was significantly reduced at rest (mean reduction 190 (SD 68) ml/l/min; p less than 0.01) and at an oxygen uptake of 0.75 l/min (mean reduction 128 (50) ml/l/min; p less than 0.02), reflecting the presence of systemic arterial hypoxaemia. Pulmonary arteriovenous oxygen content differences were similar in patients and normal subjects, but mixed venous saturation was lower in the patients at rest (mean % reduction 6.8 (2.6); p less than 0.02) and at an oxygen uptake of 0.75 l/min (mean % reduction 9.6 (2.9); p less than 0.002). It is concluded that the supply of oxygen potentially available to the tissues is reduced at rest and during exercise in patients with fibrosing alveolitis and hence, by analogy with normal people exercising under hypoxic conditions, that pulmonary blood flow is inappropriately low in this condition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Two years later they were evaluated by chest radiography and lung function tests and classified in terms of recovery or progression over the previous two years. The recovery of lymphocytes and granulocytes in lavage fluid was of limited prognostic value for persistent lung disease. In contrast, patients with increased numbers of mast cells recovered by lavage were more likely to deteriorate. Significantly increased mast cell counts (greater than or equal to 0.5% of total cells recovered) were seen in at least one lavage investigation in 15 of the 16 patients with more active and progressive disease, but in only eight of 23 patients with inactive disease (p less than 0.001). A persistent increase of mast cells on serial measurement occurred in nine of the 16 patients with active disease and in four of the 23 patients in whom the disease was inactive (p less than 0.02). The finding in the two subsequent lavages of lymphocytosis (lymphocytes greater than 30% of recovered cells) or neutrophilia (neutrophils greater than 15%) combined with mastocytosis (mast cells greater than or equal to 0.5%) occurred in nine of the 16 patients with active disease but in no patients with inactive disease.\r"

We have measured changes in FEV1 after isocapnic cold air hyperventilation (CAH) (-23.4 degrees (SD 0.43 degrees) C) and dry ambient air hyperventilation (AAH) (18.7 degrees (0.52 degrees)C) in seven asthmatic patients (mean age 31 (SD 9) years and baseline FEV1 3.2(0.9)1) and in seven normal subjects (age 28(6) years and FEV1 3.6(0.7)1). The inspired water content in both cases was 0.3 mg/l air. The rate of respiratory heat exchange per breath was calculated in watts (W) with microcomputer based equipment. Cold air hyperventilation caused a fall in FEV1 almost twice that of ambient air hyperventilation at each level of ventilation: CAH v AAH (% fall) 8.0 (5.1) v 3.9 (4.0) at 15 l/min, 11.6 (7.8) v 7.0 (4.4) at 30 l/min, and 20.7 (10.9) v 12.4 (6.3) at 60 l/min. Identical latent heat loss (evaporative drying) was imposed on the airway during the two challenges. Sensible heat loss (convective cooling) in cold air hyperventilation was 41 W at 15 l/min, 63 W at 30 l/min, and 114 W at 60 l/min; whereas in ambient air hyperventilation the loss was 6, 13, and 23 W respectively. It is concluded that the rate of cooling of the upper airway is the predominant stimulus in hyperventilation induced asthma.\r"

Six normal subjects and six asthmatic patients underwent a standard graded maximal exercise test. Measurements of oxygen consumption, minute ventilation, exercise time, blood lactate concentration, and heart rate indicated that the two groups achieved similarly high work loads during exercise. Mean FEV1 fell by 20% in asthmatic patients after exercise. Basal plasma adrenaline concentrations (nmol/l) increased in normal subjects from 0.05 to 2.7 and in asthmatic patients from 0.12 to 1.6 at peak exercise. Noradrenaline concentrations (nmol/l) increased in normal subjects from 2.0 to 14.3 and in asthmatic patients from 1.9 to 13.7 at peak exercise. The increases in adrenaline and noradrenaline in the asthmatic patients did not differ significantly from the increases in normal subjects. Thus a reduced sympathoadrenal response to exercise seems unlikely to be an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of exercise induced asthma.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between change in airway calibre and change in airway reactivity after administration of bronchodilator drugs has been investigated by comparing the effect of increasing doses of inhaled salbutamol and ipratropium bromide on the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), specific airways conductance (sGaw), and the dose of histamine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PD20) in six subjects with mild asthma. On each of 10 occasions measurements were made of baseline FEV1, sGaw, and PD20 after 15 minutes' rest, and followed one hour later, when the FEV1 had returned to baseline, by a single nebulised dose of salbutamol (placebo, 5, 30, 200 and 1000 micrograms) or ipratropium (placebo, 5, 30, 200 and 1000 micrograms) given in random order. Measurements of FEV1, sGaw, and PD20 were repeated 15 minutes after salbutamol and 40 minutes after ipratropium. Salbutamol and ipratropium caused a similar dose related increase in FEV1 and sGaw, with a mean increase after the highest doses of 0.76 and 0.69 litres for FEV1 and 1.15 and 0.96 s-1 kPa-1 for sGaw. Salbutamol also caused a dose related increase in PD20 to a maximum of 2.87 (95% confidence interval 2.18-3.55) doubling doses of histamine after the 1000 micrograms dose, but ipratropium bromide caused no significant change in PD20 (maximum increase 0.24 doubling doses, 95% confidence interval -0.73 to 1.22). Thus bronchodilatation after salbutamol was associated with a significantly greater change in airway reactivity than a similar amount of bronchodilatation after ipratropium bromide. This study shows that the relation between change in airway reactivity and bronchodilatation is different for two drugs with different mechanisms of action, suggesting that change in airway calibre is not a major determinant of change in airway reactivity with bronchodilator drugs.\r"

There was reasonable agreement between predicted and measured values (mean difference [predicted-measured] = -2.5%) but the prediction was not precise as the 95% confidence interval for the difference was +8% to -13%. The duration of arterial oxygen desaturation, defined as the percentage of total sleep time spent below a given SaO2, was not predicted accurately. It is concluded that nocturnal arterial oxygen desaturation in individual patients with chronic obstructive lung disease cannot be predicted from \"awake\" measurements with sufficient accuracy to be clinically useful.\r"

  ".W": "Antibiotic aerosol treatment is successful in treating Pseudomonas infection in some patients with cystic fibrosis, but the amount of drug reaching the lungs is unknown. The deposition patterns of carbenicillin aerosols delivered from two commercially available nebuliser systems (the Turret nebuliser plus Maxi compressor and the Inspiron nebuliser plus Traveller compressor) have been compared in six patients with cystic fibrosis during tidal breathing. The aerosol mass median diameters were 3.2 and 7.3 microns. In addition, the aerosol from the Turret-Maxi nebuliser system was inhaled by a combination of tidal and deep breathing. After two minutes' breathing via a mouthpiece the mean (SEM) deposition in the lungs was 15.60 (1.5) mg carbenicillin with the Turret nebuliser plus Maxi compressor, but only 6.54 (1.09) mg with the Inspiron nebuliser plus Traveller compressor; the distribution pattern within the lung was significantly more peripheral with the former nebuliser system. These differences may be ascribed partly to the smaller droplet size from the Turret system and partly to the higher nebulisation rate from the more powerful Maxi compressor. Tidal plus deep breathing produced a further small but non-significant increase in lung aerosol deposition. A seventh patient, who failed to complete the trial, had little aerosol deposited in his lungs because he inhaled through his nose. These results emphasise the importance of correct selection of nebuliser equipment for antibiotic aerosol treatment.\r"

It occurred more commonly in patients requiring a second thoracotomy because of blood loss (in three out of seven patients). There were no significant differences preoperatively in pulmonary function, lung perfusion scans, or cardiovascular condition between patients who subsequently developed pulmonary oedema and those who did not. Postoperative fluid balance was significantly more positive in patients developing pulmonary oedema than in those not developing oedema.
