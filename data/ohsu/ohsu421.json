  ".W": "The pregnancy outcomes of 56 women with a twin gestation and a prior cesarean birth were analyzed to determine whether a trial of labor was a reasonable consideration. Of these patients, 31 (55%) underwent an elective repeat cesarean delivery and 25 (45%) attempted vaginal delivery. Of those who attempted vaginal delivery, 18 (72%) were vaginally delivered of both infants. The dehiscence rate among women with twin pregnancies who attempted a trial of labor was 4% compared with 2% in women with singleton pregnancies. There were no significant differences in maternal or neonatal morbidity or mortality rates in trial of labor versus no trial of labor groups. We conclude in this limited population that a trial of labor in a twin gestation after a previous cesarean delivery appears to be a reasonable consideration. The usual safeguards for attempted vaginal delivery in the twin gestation should be followed.\r"

Questions concerned personal characteristics and habits, gynecologic and obstetric data, general indicators of sexual habits, and selected dietary habits. The risk of vulvar lichen sclerosus was greater in parous women than nulliparous women, but there was little tendency for the risk to increase with number of births; the finding was not significant when only married women were considered. There was no material difference between cases and control subjects in relation to major indicators of sexual habits (age at first intercourse and number of sexual partners). A smaller proportion of cases was married, but no difference was observed in the distribution of cases and controls with reference to education, smoking habits, body mass index, and previous history of diabetes. There was no association between retinoids and risk of vulvar lichen sclerosus, but intake of carotenoids was inversely and strongly associated with vulvar lichen sclerosus. This apparent protection did not materially change after adjustment for socioeconomic status and other potential confounding factors.\r"

This article summarizes potential sources of error and encourages the valid interpretation of the results and conclusions of experimental studies by making four suggestions: (1) the errors and limitations that may be present in the methodology should be described and explanations given how the errors might have affected the results and why the limitations are acceptable; (2) the methods selected should allow an answer to the question proposed; (3) the investigator should verify that the appropriate statistical test is used; and (4) when unexpected or hard to explain results are found, verification before publication should be undertaken.\r"

  ".W": "Exfoliated cells of the uterine cervix obtained from women during pregnancy and at the time of their first postpartum examination were used to monitor the prevalence of human papillomavirus infections in this population and to study the natural fluctuations in viral expression. When deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization analysis alone was used to monitor the presence of human papillomavirus infection, 20.9% of our study population had results that were positive for human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid during their first-trimester examinations. A dramatic increase in the percentage of women with positive results for human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid was observed at the time of the patients' third-trimester examinations (46%). The overall increase in human papillomavirus-positive patients was a combination of a small number of patients who had positive results on their first examination and negative results on their second examination, and a larger number of patients who had negative results on their first-trimester examination and positive results for human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid in the exfoliated cervical cells at the time of their third-trimester examination. The total percentage of patients with positive results for human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid in their cervical cells at one or both assay points during pregnancy was 52.5%. Samples obtained at the postpartum examination demonstrated a dramatic decrease in the number of samples positive for human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid (17.5%). This result was a combination of a large decrease in human papillomavirus-positive patients coupled with a small increase in detectable levels of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid in cervical samples from patients who had negative results on their previous examination. This study demonstrates a very high level of detectable human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid in exfoliated cervical cells obtained during pregnancy and shows that the detectable levels of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid fluctuate during pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "We attempted to investigate mechanisms, in addition to sexual contact, by which human papillomaviruses associated with anogenital tract lesions could be transmitted. Samples of exfoliated cervical cells were obtained from 45 pregnant women and were assayed by Southern blot hybridization analysis for the presence of human papillomavirus nucleic acids. Twenty-five of the 45 women had cells positive for human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid. A neonatal nasopharyngeal aspirate was obtained at term and analyzed for the presence of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid. We documented the presence of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid in the oral pharyngeal cavity of the neonates in 15 of 45 nasopharyngeal samples analyzed. Amniotic fluid was obtained from 13 patients when their membranes were artificially ruptured. These samples were assayed for the presence of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid; two of the 13 amniotic fluid samples contained human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid. The detection of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid in the oral cavity of neonates is indicative of a perinatal mechanism of viral transmission. The detection of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid in the amniotic fluid may suggest an in utero mechanism of transmission. However, problems encountered in collecting the amniotic fluid samples preclude us from definitive interpretation of these data.\r"

  ".W": "Seven patients with advanced cancer of the uterine cervix were treated by anal submucosal injection of methotrexate. Each course consists of five injections, one every 5 days; each injection contains 100 mg of methotrexate. The course was repeated at 3-week intervals and was given on an outpatient basis. Investigations were performed before, during, and after treatment. Methotrexate blood level was measured 4 and 24 hours after administration. Complete response occurred in all seven patients. Relapse occurred in four but could be controlled by further methotrexate administration. Average duration of survival is 46 1/2 months. No side effects were encountered as a result of a low methotrexate serum level that was recorded 4 hours after administration, 0.82 mumol after anal injection compared with 2.8 mumol for the intravenous route. The beneficial effect seems to be the result of the high methotrexate concentration in uterine and tumor tissue. The route adopted by the drug to reach the uterus from the anal submucosa is through the hemorrhoidogenital communicating veins. This preliminary study demonstrates that anal injection of methotrexate is effective in the treatment of advanced cancer. It is safe, well tolerated, and can be used as an outpatient treatment.\r"

Using linked birth-death records from Georgia for 1979 to 1982, we examined the effect that the level of care available at the hospital of delivery had on neonatal mortality in infants weighing 2500 gm and above. We used a risk scoring system designed for use with vital records to determine prepartum risk and the presence or absence of a complication of labor as indicated on the birth certificate to determine intrapartum risk. We found that women with a high prepartum risk score had increased neonatal mortality at level 1 hospitals. Women who developed a complication of labor, regardless of their prepartum risk status, had the highest neonatal mortality rates when they delivered at level 1 hospitals. We suggest prenatal risk assessment for all women and referral of high risk women to level 2 or 3 hospitals for delivery even at term.\r"

The abnormal fetal testing and adverse perinatal outcome associated with pregnancies over 42 weeks were also found in pregnancies between 41 and 42 weeks' gestation. These data support the concept that postdate fetal testing should begin at 41 weeks of gestation.\r"

Decisions with regard to the type of bladder neck suspension and the surgeon were made randomly with a randomization table. Each patient had a complete clinical and urodynamic evaluation before surgery and at 3 and 12 months after surgery. Cure rate as defined by strict clinical and urodynamic criteria was not significantly different among the three groups at the 3-month postsurgical evaluations; however, at the 12-month postsurgical evaluations, the cure rate among women who underwent Burch urethropexy (n = 101) was significantly higher than that of either Pereyra or anterior colporrhaphy (cure rates were 87%, 70%, and 69%, respectively; p less than 0.01). The Burch urethropexy was more effective than the Pereyra procedure or anterior colporrhaphy in the stabilization of the bladder base and resulted in a significantly better cure rate in women with primary stress urinary incontinence and pelvic relaxation.\r"

Biopsy specimens of conjunctiva were taken from nine patients with vernal keratoconjunctivitis, seven patients with giant papillary conjunctivitis, and five control subjects. We performed a masked semiquantitative assessment of immunofluorescence on sections from each specimen. The vernal keratoconjunctivitis and giant papillary conjunctivitis groups had significantly (P less than .05) more major basic protein deposition than controls. No significant correlation between severity of disease and degree of major basic protein deposition was found. We found extracellular eosinophil granules in one of three vernal keratoconjunctivitis specimens examined by transmission electron microscopy. Thus, eosinophil degranulation commonly occurs in vernal keratoconjunctivitis and giant papillary conjunctivitis with release of eosinophil granule major basic protein and presumably other toxic granule proteins onto affected tissues. These cationic proteins are potent cytotoxins and are able to stimulate mast cell degranulation.\r"

Four patients underwent surgery with pars plana vitrectomy and intravitreal gas, with or without scleral buckling. One patient refused treatment. All operated on eyes had attached retinas at a mean follow-up of seven months. Because posterior traction plays an important role in these unusual detachments, consideration should be given to pars plana vitrectomy and air-fluid exchange rather than scleral buckling alone.\r"

No cases of fungal keratitis were found in the contact lens group as compared to 40 cases (17%) in the noncontact lens group. Compared to results of a similar study covering January 1977 through September 1982, current results showed a larger number of patients using extended-wear lenses for cosmetic reasons (59 vs one) and overall younger age.\r"

The pupils did not consistently respond to 600 foot-candles of light before 32 weeks' postconceptual age, but responded increasingly thereafter. This progressive light response correlated significantly with postconceptual age, weight, Apgar scores, and corneal diameter (P less than .01). In the perinatal period, neurologic or radiologic examination may be warranted if the pupil diameter in a dark environment is less than 1.8 mm or greater than 5.4 mm or if the pupils do not respond to light challenge after 31 weeks' postconceptual age.\r"

This loss of intraocular pressure homeostasis, which results from reduced aqueous humor production or increased uveoscleral outflow with reduced local adrenergic control in the ciliary body-iris-trabecular meshwork region, suggests that early autonomic neuropathy of the eye may occur in Hansen's disease. The only predictive value for significant postural change in intraocular pressure was the presence of immunologically unstable disease.\r"

The preliminary results indicate that the melatonin response of the pineal gland to 5-methoxypsoralen is reduced in demented patients compared to that in healthy elderly subjects.

All diagnoses from inpatient psychiatric care in the sample during a 15-year period and the causes of death after the sampling point were combined with the interview responses. Among those admitted for inpatient psychiatric care, substance abuse was an infrequent diagnosis; the majority of schizophrenics and of those with an affective disorder appeared not to medicate regularly; survey non-responders had higher rates of mental disorders than responders. Drug use correlated with both subjective and objective measures of mental ill health. The rate of prescription drug abuse was low. Automated record-linkage is a feasible method to generate hypotheses about mental health in the general population.\r"

After simultaneous adjustment for age, region of the US, urbanization, ethnicity, marital status, education, and income, a greater proportion of White male veterans than White male nonveterans were heavy drinkers and a smaller proportion were abstainers. This association appeared in all three survey years; further, veterans consistently reported a high daily consumption level (the equivalent of approximately six bottles of beer, five glasses of wine, or four mixed drinks) compared to nonveterans. Among White male veterans, 6.9 percent reported family or marital problems and 13.9 percent reported motor vehicle crashes or violations compared to 4.4 percent and 8.9 percent, respectively, among nonveterans. The same pattern was observed for lifetime prevalences of alcoholism (veterans have nearly two and a half times the lifetime prevalence of nonveterans), cirrhosis of the liver, and unspecified alcohol-related problems.\r"

Self-reported consumption was calculated by using data from the National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS) for adults and from the National Household Surveys on Drug Abuse for adolescents. For this period, the average ratio of self-reported cigarette consumption to the USDA estimate of consumption was 0.72 (range = 0.69 to 0.78). There was no statistical difference in this consumption ratio from year to year, indicating no apparent increase in the underreporting of cigarette smoking in these surveys. We conclude that cross-sectional surveys of self-reported smoking status remain a reliable surveillance tool for monitoring changes in population smoking behavior.\r"

Workers in the assembly room were exposed to trichloroethylene levels later estimated to have exceeded 220 ppm (OSHA PEL 100 ppm). The plant was evacuated and the degreaser taken out of operation. Blood testing for carbon monoxide (CO) on five employees found carboxyhemoglobin levels in excess of normal. The plant reopened the following morning. Over the next two weeks, 15 employees were seen by the plant nurses for similar complaints; although all returned to work, their carboxyhemoglobin levels, later found to be inaccurate, were reported by a local medical clinic to range from 13.7 to 20.0 percent. At the end of the second week, another outbreak of illness occurred, but carboxyhemoglobin, trichloroethylene, fluorocarbons, and methylene chloride were not elevated in all 17 persons tested; plant-wide monitoring for CO found no elevated levels. During the first outbreak of illness, cases were 2.26 times as likely to have entered the assembly room as noncases. During the second outbreak, cases were no more likely than noncases to have entered the assembly room. We believe the explosion, earlier toxic exposures and illness, and the misleading blood test results led to plant-wide anxiety which culminated in a collective stress reaction and the second outbreak. An open meeting with all employees, informing them of our findings, provided reassurance and no further episodes of illness occurred in this workforce.\r"

Blood lead levels rose from a pre-training mean of 0.31 mumol/L to 2.47 mumol/L. Mean air lead levels were above 2,000 micrograms/m3, more than 40 times the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's standard of 50 micrograms/m3.

Although hospital and medication charges are eliminated, primary care for the homeless lacks central government directive, suffers from overlap of statutory agencies and mechanistic biases, is disproportionately delivered in emergency rooms, and has relied on advocacy by the non-profit sector. Disadvantages of this void in NHS provision are marginalization of the homeless and continuation of a two-class care system. Removal of financial barriers to care by enactment of a national health program in the US would not solve all issues related to delivery of quality care for the homeless unless its structure addressed the special needs of disenfranchised groups.\r"

Model Standards specific to California were developed by state and local public health officials for seven programs. Nine counties participated in state-local negotiations to set performance standards in these seven programs. During the two-year effort, greater use of Model Standards and more improvement in local program performance occurred in local health departments that participated in the state-local negotiation process. The use of Model Standards appeared to contribute to establishing program priorities, emphasizing the measurement of outcomes, improving data management systems, and evaluating the current performance of programs. While this state-local negotiation process is suggested as the preferred approach to encouraging the use of Model Standards in local health departments, it must be recognized that this process requires time and commitment of resources from both the state and local levels.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of body weight and blood pressure on the risk of total mortality and mortality from cardiovascular diseases (CVD) were examined in a prospective sample of 5,866 adult residents of American Samoa, a Polynesian population noted for exhibiting high levels of obesity. Data collected during 1975-76 were linked to mortality records from 1976 through 1981. In logistic regression models which did not include blood pressure, percent of desirable weight was an important risk factor for mortality from CVD, but it was not an important risk factor when diastolic blood pressure was included in the model. Percent of desirable weight was not related to mortality from all causes combined in either Samoan men or women. Age and diastolic blood pressure were predictors of total and CVD mortality in men and women. These results, in an obese population, suggest that body weight and obesity are not independently related to excess mortality in the very obese, although they may associate with high blood pressure. These results also suggest that relations between physiological characteristics and mortality may vary with cultural, genetic, or other factors not examined in this study.\r"

Two hundred children with injuries who received a score of 2 or more on the Maximum Abbreviated Injury Severity scale were considered as cases and compared with 400 uninjured children seen in the same hospitals for non-traumatic reasons. Systematic, blinded interviews and tests were conducted with parents to determine the role of a series of social, familial, personal, and behavioral characteristics. After adjustment for age, gender and socioeconomic area of residence, logistic regression analyses showed higher risks of injury to be related to fewer years of parents' education, a history of accident to a family member, an environment judged as unsafe, and poor parental supervision. Absence of physical health problems, fewer family preventive behaviors and reported lack of cautiousness were also related to a higher risk, whereas neither aggressivity nor behavioral disturbance, whether internalizing or externalizing, showed any such relation. These data suggest that the child's personality and behavior are weaker risk factors for pedestrian and bicyclist injuries than are family and neighborhood characteristics.\r"

The majority of the 2,788 adolescent patients sampled in these clinics were female (78 percent) and Black (71 percent). Each patient was initially interviewed at the time of a clinic visit and reinterviewed 12 months later; their medical records were systematically reviewed. As expected, the funded clinics detected and treated a wider range of medical and behavioral problems than the comparison clinics, a finding that was based on the self-reports of patients and confirmed by documentation in the medical records. However, improvements in life-style and in specific medical outcomes were not observed. To build on the limited success of this program, efforts are needed to encourage more males to receive care and to develop more specific interventions for patients in this age group.\r"

The sarcolemma of right ventricular myocardium was disrupted (skinned) by homogenization. Fiber bundles were dissected from the homogenate, mounted on tension transducers, and immersed sequentially in five solutions that loaded Ca2+ into the SR, then in solutions containing either 2 or 25 mM caffeine to release SR-stored Ca2+, resulting in transient tension development. Experimental solutions were saturated with halothane in N2 gas during Ca2+ uptake by SR, Ca2+ release by SR, or during both SR Ca2+ uptake and release. Halothane (0.5-1.7%) resulted in dose-dependent depression of SR Ca2+ uptake in both newborn and adult skinned fibers. Less tension transient depression resulted in newborn (35%) than adult skinned fibers (49.5%, P less than 0.05) with 0.5% halothane exposure during SR Ca2+ uptake. Similar depression resulted in newborn (53.7% and 73.4%) and adult fibers (65.2% and 77.9%) with 1.0% and 1.7% halothane. Halothane had little effect on SR Ca2+ release by 25 mM caffeine but enhanced submaximal SR Ca2+ release by 2 mM caffeine more in newborn than adult myocardium. Increased Ca2+ efflux from newborn SR may contribute to the greater sensitivity of intact newborn cardiac muscle to exposure to halothane.\r"

In five similar preparations saline instead of lidocaine was infused into the mother for 180 min. Maternal and fetal arterial blood pressure, heart rate, pHa, PaCO2, and PaO2 were monitored, and fetal cardiac output and the distribution of blood flow to fetal organs were measured, using labeled microspheres, before and after asphyxia and again after maternal infusion of lidocaine or saline. Maternal and fetal arterial blood and maternal urine were obtained at intervals for determination of lidocaine concentrations and urinary drug clearance. At the end of infusion, these animals were killed and tissues dissected for determination of lidocaine concentrations and organ blood flow. Maternal and fetal lidocaine plasma concentrations at steady state were 2.32 +/- 0.12 and 1.23 +/- 0.17 microgram/ml, respectively, similar to those seen during human epidural anesthesia. Asphyxia resulted in a significant drop in fetal heart rate and increased blood flow to the brain, heart, and adrenals. Asphyxia and saline did not produce additional deterioration of the fetus, but asphyxia and lidocaine led to a significant increase in PaCO2 and decreases in pHa, mean arterial pressure, and blood flows to the brain, heart, and adrenals. It is concluded that the immature fetus loses its cardiovascular adaptation to asphyxia when exposed to clinically acceptable plasma concentrations of lidocaine obtained transplacentally from the mother.\r"

  ".W": "The direct effect of ketamine on cardiac muscle was studied using rat left ventricular papillary muscle. At an extracellular calcium concentration [( Ca++]0) of 2.5 mM, rat myocardial contractility is nearly maximum, and a positive inotropic effect was demonstrated by an increase in maximum shortening velocity (Vmax) with ketamine at 10(-5) M but not 10(-4) M. At a [Ca++]0 of 0.5 mM, ketamine 10(-5) and 10(-4) M had a positive inotropic effect as shown by an increase in Vmax (135% +/- 22% and 147% +/- 33%, respectively) and in isometric active force (AF/s) (120% +/- 10% and 152% +/- 44%, respectively). The positive inotropic effect of ketamine was not related to catecholamine uptake inhibition and/or alpha/beta receptor stimulation because it persisted after phentolamine and propranolol and because ketamine had no relaxing effect. Ketamine 10(-5) and 10(-4) M impaired isotonic relaxation, contraction-relaxation coupling under low loading conditions, and the load sensitivity of relaxation, which suggests impairment of the calcium sequestering systems, especially the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Ketamine modified postrest recovery: the first beat (B1) after a 1-min rest period was decreased by ketamine 10(-4) M but not ketamine 10(-5) M. Moreover, the beat-to-beat postrest recovery has been demonstrated to be exponential, and tau, the time constant of the decay was increased by ketamine 10(-4) M (5.4 +/- 0.3 vs. 3.9 +/- 0.2 beats) but not by ketamine 10(-5) M (3.4 +/- 0.4 vs. 3.7 +/- 0.2 beats). These effects on postrest recovery suggest that ketamine impairs SR function. The authors suggest that ketamine had a dual action on rat myocardium: a positive inotropic effect without any relaxing effect, probably related to an increase in calcium influx, and an impairment of SR function. Nevertheless, impairment of SR is only significant at high concentration (10(-4) M) and might overcome the positive inotropic effect only at supratherapeutic concentration.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the endothelium-dependent vascular effects of halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane, isometric tension was recorded in isolated ring preparations of rat thoracic aorta suspended in Kreb's buffer and aerated with 95% O2/5% CO2. One set of the rings had intact endothelium and the other set of the rings had the endothelium mechanically denuded. The rings were precontracted with phenylephrine (1 x 10(-6) M). Halothane, enflurane, or isoflurane gas was bubbled through the baths at increasing concentrations (0.5-5.0%) in preparations with and without indomethacin (28 microM). Endothelium-intact rings demonstrated significant (P less than 0.05) vasoconstriction at low concentrations of both isoflurane and enflurane followed by vasodilation at higher concentrations. Halothane also induced vasoconstriction in some rings, but its mean effect was not significantly different from control. After discontinuation of the anesthetic gas, endothelium-intact rings demonstrated a rebound vasoconstriction above previous maximal levels for all three anesthetics. When indomethacin was added to the baths, the vasoconstriction was potentiated and was statistically significant for all three anesthetics. These results suggest that at low concentrations, enflurane and isoflurane cause vasoconstriction through inhibition of basal EDRF production and/or stimulation of the release of an endothelium-derived constricting factor. At higher anesthetic concentrations, a direct vasodilating effect of the anesthetic predominates. The potentiation of vasoconstriction in the presence of indomethacin suggests that these volatile anesthetics stimulate the release of a vasodilating prostanoid from endothelium.\r"

Eight dogs were kept anesthetized with enflurane for 2 h using this device. Vital signs and arterial blood gases were within normal limits during anesthesia. The concentration of vaporized enflurane, measured by mass spectrometry, could be reliably and accurately controlled within the clinical range at any minute volume by adjusting the infusion rate. Measurements of blood enflurane indicated that enflurane uptake could be adequately achieved.\r"

All patients were scheduled to undergo lower abdominal or peripheral surgery. Group 1 included five healthy ASA PS 1 subjects and group 2 included 10 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). In all patients 12.5 ml of 2% lidocaine HCl was injected into the lumbar epidural space, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and heart rate were continuously monitored. 2DE evaluation was performed before and at 10, 20, 30, and 60 min (T10-T60) after epidural lidocaine injection. The left ventricular wall was divided into 16 segments for parasternal long-axis, short-axis and apical four-chamber views. The wall motion of each segment was graded on a scale from 1 (dyskinesia) to 6 (hyperkinesia), with 5 representing normal motion. A decrease in segmental wall motion greater than or equal to 2 grades was considered indicative of ischemia. Plasma lidocaine and catecholamine levels were measured before and 10, 20, and 60 min after epidural lidocaine injection. Peak plasma lidocaine levels in groups 1 and 2 were 2.79 +/- 1.06 micrograms/ml (mean +/- SD) and 2.58 +/- 1.48 micrograms/ml at 10 min, respectively (NS). Plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine levels were unchanged from baseline. Systolic pressures decreased significantly in group 2 from T10 to T60. Diastolic pressure decreased significantly in the same group from T20 to T60, and in group 1 only at T10. Mean arterial pressure decreased significantly in both groups at T30, without change in heart rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Anesthesia was considered successful if the patient had no pain at the operative site. The success rate of low-dose tetracaine (6 mg) with epinephrine was 95% compared with 65% in patients receiving low-dose tetracaine alone (P = 0.04). All patients receiving 10 mg had successful anesthesia. Compared with patients receiving 6 mg tetracaine, those given 10 mg had higher dermatomal levels of anesthesia (P = 0.0001) and a higher incidence of nausea (P = 0.04). Thus, epinephrine can increase the effectiveness of low-dose tetracaine.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the potencies of edrophonium and neostigmine as antagonists of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium and vecuronium, dose-response curves were constructed for both antagonists when given at 10% spontaneous recovery of first twitch height. Ninety ASA physical status 1 and 2 adults were given either 0.4 mg/kg atracurium or 0.08 mg/kg vecuronium during thiopental-nitrous oxide-enflurane anesthesia. Train-of-four stimulation was applied to the ulnar nerve every 12 s, and the force of contraction of the adductor pollicis muscle was recorded. When spontaneous recovery of first twitch height reached 10% of its initial control value, edrophonium (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, or 1 mg/kg) or neostigmine (0.005, 0.01, 0.02, or 0.05 mg/kg) was administered by random allocation. Neuromuscular function in another ten subjects was allowed to recover spontaneously. Assisted recovery was defined as actual recovery minus mean spontaneous recovery observed in patients who were not given antagonists. First twitch recovery was initially more rapid when vecuronium was antagonized compared with atracurium, but no difference was detected after 10 min. At 10 min the neostigmine ED80 was 0.022 +/- 0.003 (SEM) mg/kg after atracurium and 0.024 +/- 0.003 mg/kg after vecuronium. The edrophonium ED80 was 0.44 +/- 0.11 mg/kg with atracurium and 0.46 +/- 0.12 mg/kg with vecuronium, giving a neostigmine:edrophonium potency ratio of 20. Atracurium train-of-four fade could be antagonized more easily with edrophonium, whereas that of vecuronium was more easily antagonized by neostigmine. It is concluded that edrophonium and neostigmine are not equally effective against atracurium and vecuronium.\r"

Caudal catheters were inserted in 32 children, randomly assigned to receive 0.033 mg.kg-1, 0.067 mg.kg-1, or 0.10 mg.kg-1 of preservative-free morphine for analgesia after major surgical procedures below the diaphragm. The first dose of caudal morphine was mixed with 0.25 ml.kg-1 of 1% lidocaine to confirm correct caudal catheter placement. By assessment of periodic pain scores and the time intervals between administration of caudal morphine and the recurrence of pain, the authors found that the mean (+/- SD) duration of analgesia was significantly longer after 0.10 mg.kg-1 (13.3 +/- 4.7 h) than after either 0.033 mg.kg-1 or 0.067 mg.kg-1 (10.0 +/- 3.3 and 10.4 +/- 4.2 h, respectively) (P less than 0.02). The frequency of vomiting, pruritus, and urinary retention was similar in each group. Vomiting was less common in patients who had nasogastric drainage than in patients who were fed soon after surgery (P less than 0.05). Delayed respiratory depression occurred in one child after 0.10 mg.kg-1 of caudal morphine. Caudal morphine, 0.033-0.10 mg.kg-1, provided prolonged analgesia in children. The authors recommend 0.033 mg.kg-1 of caudal morphine as an initial dose for children.\r"

Anesthesia was induced using halothane/nitrous oxide/oxygen via a mask without the administration of other drugs. Nitrous oxide was discontinued, the trachea was intubated without prior administration of neuromuscular blocking drugs, and anesthesia was maintained with halothane in oxygen. Participating patients were assigned to one of five groups: 1) no neuromuscular blocking drug (control group, n = 9); 2) atracurium 0.5 mg/kg (n = 10); 3) atracurium 1.0 mg/kg (n = 15); 4) vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg (n = 20); or, 5) pancuronium 0.1 mg/kg (n = 10). Tourniquets, inflated to 300 mmHg immediately before iv administration of neuromuscular blocking drug and 15-30 min prior to skin incision, were used to isolate extremities from circulating neuromuscular blocking drug in all patients. A positive response to stimulation was defined as movement of at least one extremity occurring distal to the tourniquet within 1 min following skin incision. The first patients in the control and atracurium groups were studied at an end-tidal halothane concentration of 0.95%. The first patient in the pancuronium group was studied at a halothane concentration of 0.75%, and the first patient in the vecuronium group at 0.70%. Subsequent patients were studied at end-tidal halothane concentrations 0.10% above or below that of the preceding patient, depending on the presence or absence of movement with skin incision. Control MAC for halothane was 0.74% +/- 0.09% (mean +/- SEM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The sensitivity of the masseter, one of the muscles of the upper airway, to pancuronium was measured in ten adults undergoing elective surgery and compared with that of the adductor pollicis. During thiopental-nitrous oxide-enflurane (end-tidal concentration less than 0.25%) anesthesia, supramaximal nerve stimulation was applied to the ulnar nerve at the elbow and to the nerve to the masseter, at a point inferior to the zygomatic arch, anterior to the mandibular condyle. Jaw closure was measured by a force transducer system attached to both an oral airway and a metal frame fixed to the operating table 10 cm caudad to the chin. Cumulative dose-response curves for pancuronium (initial dose = 0.02 mg/kg, incremental doses = 0.01 mg/kg) were determined. Control twitch tensions were (mean +/- SEM) 473 +/- 75 g at the masseter and 660 +/- 118 g at the adductor pollicis. The masseter was slightly more sensitive to pancuronium, the ED50 being 0.024 +/- 0.001 mg/kg compared with 0.028 +/- 0.001 mg/kg for the adductor pollicis (P less than 0.05). Corresponding values for the ED90 were 0.038 +/- 0.004 and 0.043 +/- 0.002 mg/kg, respectively (P less than 0.05). The time from injection of the first dose of pancuronium to maximum blockade was 3.2 +/- 0.2 min at the masseter and 3.8 +/- 0.2 min at the adductor pollicis (P less than 0.01). Following incremental doses, this time was 1.8 +/- 0.1 and 2.6 +/- 0.1 min, respectively (P less than 0.01). It is concluded that after injection of pancuronium, neuromuscular blockade is greater at the masseter and occurs sooner than at the adductor pollicis. Jaw relaxation can be achieved with relatively small doses of pancuronium. This suggests that return of adductor pollicis function may not imply complete masseter muscle recovery.\r"

A bolus containing fentanyl and indocyanine green dye (ICG) was rapidly injected into the central venous catheter of patients prior to anesthesia. Sequential arterial blood samples were collected at 1-s intervals for 45 s after injection. The total amount of fentanyl taken up by the lung during the first pass and the instantaneous extraction of fentanyl at each time point during the first pass were calculated from the differences in the arterial blood concentration versus time curves of the nondiffusible indicator (ICG) and the drug. In patients who had been receiving no other drugs prior to the experiment, the total first pass uptake (mean +/- SE) of fentanyl was 82.6% +/- 1.4% of the injected dose. In patients who had been receiving 30-120 mg/day of propranolol the total first pass uptake (mean +/- SE) of fentanyl decreased to 52.8% +/- 6.3% of the injected dose. In one patient on 120 mg of propranolol per day, first pass uptake of fentanyl was only 20.3% of the injected dose. Additional studies in a rat isolated perfused lung preparation coperfused with fentanyl and propranolol also demonstrated that one basic lipophilic amine (propranolol) could inhibit the pulmonary uptake of a second basic lipophilic amine (fentanyl). The high first pass uptake of fentanyl in the human lung limits the rate of entry of this drug into the systemic circulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Skin blood flow was measured by laser Doppler at all sites before and 5, 10, 15, and 30 min after injection. Subcutaneous injection of ropivacaine 0.25% or 0.75% decreased cutaneous blood flow by a maximum of 52% +/- 11% and 54% +/- 14% (mean +/- SE), respectively. In contrast, bupivacaine 0.25% or 0.75% increased flow by 90% +/- 32% and 82% +/- 48%, and injection of saline increased blood flow by 32% +/- 17%. Cutaneous blood flow after the injection of ropivacaine was significantly lower than after injection of bupivacaine or saline, and was also lower than at the uninjected control site (P = 0.0009). All of the solutions with epinephrine decreased blood flow to a similar extent (48-73%, P = 0.3). The ability of ropivacaine to produce cutaneous vasoconstriction offers several advantages over the other local anesthetics presently available for infiltration anesthesia.\r"

  ".W": "Dexmedetomidine, a highly selective and potent alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist, reduces halothane anesthetic requirements by over 90% in rats. The present study examined whether dexmedetomidine produces a hypnotic-anesthetic action in rats. Dexmedetomidine induced a hypnotic-anesthetic state in rats characterized by loss of righting reflex at doses greater than or equal to 0.1 mg/kg. This response was dose-dependent between 0.1 and 3 mg/kg. Alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonists that cross the blood-brain barrier (antipamezole and idazoxan) decreased the hypnotic-anesthetic action of dexmedetomidine in a dose-dependent fashion. In contrast, the alpha-2 antagonist, L-659,066, which does not penetrate into the CNS did not affect dexmedetomidine-induced hypnosis. Antagonists for the other adrenoceptors not only failed to reduce the hypnotic-anesthetic action of dexmedetomidine but in some cases even potentiated this effect. Thus, prazosin, an alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, significantly enhanced the hypnotic-anesthetic property of dexmedetomidine. Antagonists with beta-2 receptor blocking properties also enhanced dexmedetomidine-induced hypnosis. Selective beta-1 receptor antagonists did not affect the hypnotic action of dexmedetomidine. These results suggest that dexmedetomidine produces a hypnotic-anesthetic action in rats via activation of central alpha-2 adrenoceptors.\r"

The authors describe the results of a prospective, randomized, double-blind study comparing the pharmacologic effects of oral versus injectable preanesthetic medication in 67 healthy pediatric inpatients older than 1 yr. Children given the oral medication (meperidine 3.0 mg/kg, pentobarbital 4.0 mg/kg) were significantly more drowsy in the holding area (P less than 0.001) and more cooperative at the time of induction of anesthesia (P less than 0.01) than the children given intramuscular medication (morphine 0.1 mg/kg, pentobarbital 4.0 mg/kg). There were no other differences between the two groups. These data demonstrate that oral preanesthetic medication can be as or more effective compared with intramuscular medication in producing the desired effects without adverse side effects. As a result of this study, the benefits of preanesthetic medication can now be achieved in nearly all surgical patients without injections.\r"

Secobarbital caused a slight contraction only in the cerebral artery. In contrast, pentobarbital did not produce a contraction in any artery studied. The thiamylal-induced contraction was not affected by treatment with phentolamine, diphenhydramine, or cinanserin but was attenuated by treatment with Ca entry blockers, such as nifedipine or diltiazem. In the cerebral artery soaked in Ca++-free media for 60 min, the addition of Ca++ produced triphasic responses; a transient contraction followed by a relaxation and a slowly developing, persistent contraction. The persistent contraction was potentiated by 10(-4) M thiamylal but abolished at 10(-3) M. In the mesenteric artery soaked in Ca++-free media, the addition of Ca++ produced only a slight contraction, which was potentiated by thiamylal (10(-4) and 10(-3) M). It is concluded that thiobarbiturates are more potent vasoconstrictors than oxybarbiturates and that the barbiturates produce greater contraction in cerebral arteries than in extracerebral arteries. The thiamylal-induced contraction appears to be associated mainly with influx of Ca++ from extracellular fluids.\r"

Six dogs (group I) received treatments of both SCh 1.0 mg/kg iv and saline placebo 3.0 ml iv. Fasciculations and substantial increases in EMG activity were observed in all six dogs given SCh.

None of these six dogs had visible fasciculations following SCh, and only in one was slight EMG activity detected. Following iv SCh, there were parallel increases in both MAA and CBF. The peak MAA value of 255% +/- 56% of control occurred at the 1-min measurement point and was followed by a gradual decline in MAA. CBF increases were greatest during the periods of greatest MAA (i.e., the 1- to 3-min measurement points). The largest increase in CBF (128% +/- 9% of control) occurred at the 3-min measurement point.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cyclical coronary flow reductions are exacerbated by IV epinephrine 0.4 microgram.kg-1.min-1 for 15 min. These flow reductions can be abolished by known inhibitors of platelet function. This study assesses the effect of halothane, isoflurane, and enflurane on spontaneous- and epinephrine-exacerbated cyclical coronary flow reductions. Twenty-three open-chest dogs [1% halothane (n = 5), 0.5% halothane (n = 5), 0.25% halothane (n = 3), 1.5% isoflurane (n = 5), and 2.0% enflurane (n = 5)] with a mechanically stenosed coronary artery showed cyclical blood flow reductions. With 1.0% halothane administration, spontaneous cyclical blood flow reductions were abolished (n = 5), whereas during administration of isoflurane 1.5% (n = 5) and enflurane 2.0% (n = 5) cyclical flow reductions and myocardial ischemia continued. Subsequent administration of halothane in the isoflurane and enflurane groups showed abolition of coronary flow reductions in all animals (n = 10).

Previous bedside determinations of respiratory system mechanics in patients with acute respiratory failure have been based on assumptions derived from in vitro measurements without direct measurement of in vivo ET tube resistance (RET). We hypothesized that the RET measured in vivo would be greater than those values obtained in vitro when peak flow rates and ET tube size were held constant. We measured airflow, volume (pneumotachograph), esophageal pressure (nasogastric-esophageal balloon), and airway pressure (airway catheter) in 10 patients intubated with no. 8.0 orotracheal tubes. We also studied the static and dynamic flow-pressure relationships for five different sizes of ET tubes in vitro (artificial lung) (6.0, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, and 8.5). The static and dynamic values of RET and the Rohrer coefficients of linear and nonlinear resistance (K1 and K2) were similar to values previously reported in the literature. Although there was considerable individual variation, values of RET measured in vivo were generally higher than those derived from in vitro measurements at both peak flow rates tested, perhaps because of secretions, head or neck position, tube deformation, or increased turbulence. We conclude that ET tubes contribute significantly to total airflow resistance and that RET is often significantly greater than indicated by in vitro studies. Estimates of work of breathing in critically ill patients must take into consideration the contribution of in vivo RET on total pulmonary system resistance.\r"

We examined the possibility that neurogenic stimulation may also induce movement of plasma proteins into the airway lumen. Neurogenic plasma protein extravasation (PPE) was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by electrical stimulation of both vagal nerves (EVS) at 10 V, 5 ms, 20 Hz. After 90 s of EVS, histologic examination showed Monastral blue B, a macromolecular tracer, extravasated within the endothelium of vessels in the subepithelial layer of the tracheobronchial mucosa. In animals given 125I-labeled albumin intravenously, PPE was quantitated as microliters of plasma deposited into the airways, lung, and tracheobronchial (TB) and bronchoalveolar (BA) lavages. One minute of EVS induced an immediate increase in PPE in the tracheal (+117%) and bronchial wall (+125%) but not in the peripheral lung. There was a concomitant increase in the 125I-labeled albumin recovered from both TB fluid (net increase, 1.29 microliter of plasma = +259%) and BA fluid (net increase, 2.79 microliters of plasma = +107%). In addition, both total protein and endogenous albumin concentrations in TB fluid also increased after EVS. The albumin/total protein ratio (the albumin percentage) in TB lavages was also significantly increased (1.4 x, 1.7 x, and 2.5 x in three separate experiments, respectively), indicating the vascular origin of the increased luminal proteins. Neither cholinergic (atropine) nor adrenergic blockade (phentolamine + propranolol) influenced EVS-induced PPE into the airway walls or movement of radiolabeled albumin into the airway lumen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Athymic nude (nu/nu) mice are uniformly more susceptible than euthymic nu/+ mice to lethal infection with intranasally inoculated Blastomyces dermatitidis, whether infection is initiated by yeasts or conidia. Conidial infection requires a high inoculum size; the disease produced is prolonged and disseminated. Yeasts are infective at a low inoculum size and produce a rapidly fatal pneumonia. Thymus transplantation is more protective for conidia-infected than yeast-infected nude mice, presumably because the disease course is long enough for an effect to become demonstrable. Yeast inocula multiply more rapidly in the lungs than do conidial inocula. This may relate to the greater susceptibility of conidia to heterophils evoked in the airways, and the fact that yeasts derived from conidial inocula must survive in the face of an established inflammatory reaction. When yeasts and conidia are inoculated simultaneously, the disease produced is less severe than when yeasts are inoculated alone, presumably because of a more intense and diffuse inflammatory response engendered by the conidia. Suppression of conidia-derived yeast replication is demonstrable for at least 1 wk in nu/nu mice and for 2 to 3 wk in nu/+ mice. The latter delay appears attributable to the intact immune system in nu/+ mice, and the probability that cellular immunity limits the subsequent replication of yeasts. Eventually, the immune response fails to control yeast replication, and the mice succumb. These studies provide further insights into the role of the thymus in host defense against B. dermatitidis and the basis for the differential pace of infection when mice are infected with yeasts or conidia.\r"

  ".W": "Tissue injury is observed in allergic and nonallergic eosinophilic rhinitis, but the mechanism of this injury is unclear. Because eosinophils are prominent in biopsy specimens in these conditions, we hypothesized that they may participate in the injury process. Initially, we developed techniques to isolate and purify human nasal epithelial cells from turbinate biopsies to use as target cells for eosinophil granule products. Primary cultures from explants were characterized by electron microscopy and indirect immunofluorescence with a panel of primary monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. These studies revealed the homogeneity of the cells and confirmed their epithelial nature. Cultured nasal epithelial cells were then exposed to either purified human eosinophil peroxidase, bromide, and glucose plus glucose oxidase, as a continuous source of hydrogen peroxide, or eosinophil major basic protein. Neither eosinophil peroxidase alone nor glucose plus glucose oxidase in the absence of eosinophil peroxidase were injurious, but the combined addition of eosinophil peroxidase, glucose/glucose oxidase, and bromide produced marked target cell lysis. This effect was time- and eosinophil peroxidase dose-dependent. Catalase and azide significantly inhibited the lysis of these cells, suggesting the eosinophil peroxidase-catalyzed products of halide oxidation mediated this form of injury. The addition of purified human eosinophil major basic protein also caused dose- and time-dependent lysis of the nasal epithelial cells but required longer incubation periods to effect injury. We hypothesize that the eosinophil peroxidase-hydrogen peroxide-halide system and major basic protein may injure the nasal epithelium in inflammatory conditions such as allergic and nonallergic eosinophilic rhinitis.\r"

The aim of this study was to evaluate the respective role of the nasal mucus quality and ciliary activity in determining nasal mucociliary clearance and to study changes in these variables across time and with environmental conditions. In 20 healthy nonsmoking volunteers, the in vivo nasal mucociliary clearance was measured with the saccharin test. Then, nasal mucus and ciliated cells were collected. The in vitro ciliary beat frequency of the nasal cells was evaluated by a photometric analysis. The in vitro nasal mucus transport rate was evaluated by use of the frog depleted-palate model. The nasal mucociliary transport time (NMTT) of saccharin was greater than 30 min in seven subjects and was 13.6 +/- 6.1 min (mean +/- SD) in the remaining 13 subjects. NMTT was correlated to the in vitro transport rate of the nasal mucus (r = -0.75, p less than 0.001), but not to the ciliary beating frequency or to ambient temperature, relative humidity, or air pollution indices measured. Moreover, large intraindividual variations of NMTT, measured on two occasions 4 to 8 wk apart, were found to be significantly correlated with changes in mucus transport rate (r = -0.60, p less than 0.05).\r"

Increased airway concentration of both prostaglandins and bradykinin has been suggested as the possible cause of the increased cough sensitivity sometimes found in patients with cough associated with taking drugs that inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme. We have therefore investigated the effect of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), bradykinin (BK), histamine (H), and citric acid (C) on capsaicin-induced cough and increase in respiratory resistance (Rrs). Capsaicin-induced changes in Rrs and dose-cough response were measured before and after inhaling 0.76 mumol of PGE2, BK, H, and C. All the test substances caused cough, which was subject to tachyphylaxis, but no significant change in Rrs. Neither BK, H, nor C altered the capsaicin cough or Rrs response. However, PGE2 significantly increased both responses to capsaicin, the geometric mean (95% Cl) for the dose of capsaicin causing 5 or more coughs being 16.2 (14.3 to 18.3) nmol before and 4.4 (2.4 to 7.9) nmol after PGE2 (p less than 0.05). The percent increase (95% Cl) in Rrs after capsaicin was 20 (16.5 to 23.5)% before and 37.2 (32.2 to 43.2)% after PGE2 (p less than 0.05). The results suggest that the cough reflex will be increased in the presence of PGE2 in the airway.\r"

Lyso-PAF release was observed in 12 of 13 patients, with a maximum (p less than 0.001) 5 min after stimulation and a progressive decrease during the first hour. PAF was detected in the 5-min postchallenge nasal washings from two of 13 subjects. After HPLC, this mediator was found in four of seven postchallenge nasal washings submitted to this procedure, with a peak 5 min and 10 min after provocation. Histamine analysis revealed a significant (p less than 0.001) but time-limited (5 min) release in nasal secretion. The pattern of immunoreactive leukotriene C4 showed a maximal peak (p less than 0.01) 5 min after allergen provocation, with raised levels for 20 min. Nasal stimulation with nebulized saline solution or grass pollens in healthy subjects and in patients suffering from allergic rhinitis caused by Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus was followed by no local mediator release. These data indicate that, in addition to histamine and peptide-leukotrienes, lyso-PAF and PAF are released in nasal secretions after local antigen stimulation in patients with hay fever, with a preponderance of lyso-PAF response. On the basis of these results, it is conceivable that these ether-phospholipids may be involved in allergic inflammation of human nasal airways.\r"

In the AIA group, the geometric mean doses of histamine and LTE4 causing a 35% fall in specific airway conductance (PD35) were 0.31 mumol and 0.17 nmol, respectively, and LTE4 was 1,870 times more potent than histamine. In the non-AIA group, the histamine and LTE4 PD35 doses were 0.40 mumol (non-AIA versus AIA, NS) and 2.8 nmol (non-AIA versus AIA, p = 0.002), respectively, and LTE4 was 145 times more potent than histamine in eliciting bronchoconstriction (non-AIA versus AIA, p = 0.001). After desensitization to aspirin the geometric mean histamine and LTE4 PD 35 in the AIA group changed to 0.19 mumol (NS) and 3.3 nmol (p = 0.007), respectively, and there was an average 33-fold reduction in the responsiveness of the airways to LTE4 relative to histamine (p less than 0.001). In five non-AIA subjects. Ingestion of 600 mg of aspirin daily did not lead to any significant change in airway responsiveness to histamine or to LTE4. These results demonstrate a selective and marked increase in airway responsiveness to LTE4 in subjects with AIA. The efficacy of desensitization may relate in part to a selective down-regulation of LTE4 receptors within the airways.\r"

Exposures lasted 1 h each, and included three 10-min periods of exercise (ventilation rate typically 40 to 45 L/min). Exposures occurred in randomized order 7 days apart. Temperature was 10 degrees C, relative humidity was approximately 100% in 20- and 10-microns (fog) exposures, and approximately 75 to 80% in 1-micron aerosol exposures. Healthy subjects showed no statistically significant changes in lung function or in bronchial reactivity to methacholine attributable to acid exposures. They showed significant increases in lower and upper respiratory irritant symptoms when exposed to 20- or 10-microns acid fog, but not when exposed to 1-micron acid aerosol. Asthmatics showed significant excess decreases in forced expiratory performance, increases in airway resistance, and increases in irritant symptoms during acid exposures, relative to control conditions. Lung function changes in asthmatics tended to increase with time during exposure; they did not vary significantly with acid droplet size. Symptoms in asthmatics were slightly worse with 10- or 20-microns fog as compared with 1-micron aerosol. In a few instances, symptoms and lung function decrements necessitated stopping exercise or terminating the exposure early. Thus, asthma is a risk factor for unfavorable physiologic response to sulfuric acid at occupational exposure concentrations. Large droplet size (i.e., fog) tends to exacerbate short-term symptomatic response, but we have not been able to demonstrate a consistent effect of droplet size on physiologic response.\r"

  ".W": "An alternative method of evaluating pulmonary mechanical function that uses short duration flow pulses was applied in five adult rabbits with high frequency flow interruption (HFFI) at 4 cycles per second. Variations in the total pressure across the respiratory system were partitioned into separate lungs and chest wall components, and the mechanical impedance of each component was evaluated in the range of 4 to 40 Hz using cross and power spectral analysis and spectral averaging. The resistances, R, of the respiratory system, lungs, and chest wall were 23.5 (2.3 SD), 18.6 (2.8), and 4.9 (1.5) cm H2O.L-1.s, respectively. These values were similar to R obtained by the conventional method at ordinary rates of ventilation, with the exception of chest wall resistance, which was approximately 50% smaller than R obtained by the conventional method. The compliances of the respiratory system, lungs and chest wall were 1.40 (0.19), 2.88 (0.94), and 2.85 (0.86) ml.cm H2O-1, respectively. In all cases, compliance values obtained by pulse analysis were roughly 70% of the values obtained by the conventional method. The smaller compliance values obtained with the pulse method may reflect the multicompartment behavior of the lungs and chest wall at the high frequencies found in the pulse spectra. We conclude that the response of the respiratory system to short duration flow pulses may be used to evaluate pulmonary mechanical function. The brief duration of the flow pulse suggests that this method may be well suited to evaluate lung function in uncooperative subjects, particularly newborns and premature infants.\r"

Survey-to-survey variability in airway responsiveness was assessed with computation of adjusted within-subject correlation coefficients for continuous measures of response (percent decrease in FEV1 after challenge) and with adjusted odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes (\"positive\" if percent decrease FEV1 greater than or equal to 0.13). The relationships between variability in responsiveness and the following variables were examined: age, baseline level of pulmonary function, presence of respiratory symptoms and illnesses, smoking exposures, season, level of ventilation achieved during testing, and temperature of the expired air. Airway hyperresponsiveness was demonstrated consistently over all surveys in only six of 49 (12%) subjects who had ever demonstrated a \"positive\" airway response. The odds relating positive responses between surveys was 12.1 for airway hyperresponsiveness, 21.5 for \"persistent\" wheeze, and 6.7 for \"any\" wheeze. Significant predictors of airway hyperresponsiveness were wheeze symptoms (OR = 2.3), hay fever (OR = 1.6), and a chest illness requiring bed rest (OR = 2.5). Adjustment for survey-to-survey differences in respiratory symptoms, or for differences in testing conditions between surveys, did not alter the observed variability in airway responsiveness. Adjustment for \"random error\" (assessed with replicate measures of airway responsiveness in a subsample of 21 subjects) improved the observed survey-to-survey variability by 30%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between airway hyperresponsiveness and longitudinal change in lung function was assessed in a population-based sample of 184 children and young adults observed over a maximum span of 12 yr. Pulmonary function was assessed annually with spirometry, and health and household information was obtained with standardized questionnaires. Nonspecific airway responsiveness to eucapneic hyperventilation with subfreezing air was measured on at least two occasions between the sixth and twelfth annual surveys. At any given survey, a significant bronchoconstrictor response was defined as [( prechallenge FEV1-postchallenge FEV1]/pre-FEV1) greater than or equal to 0.13, a value that identified 10% of the population. Subjects were classified as \"never\", \"always\", or \"inconsistent\" responders according to the consistency of responsiveness determined in different surveys. Subjects were classified further as \"labile\" if their maximal survey-to-survey difference in delta FEV1/FEV1 was greater than or equal to 0.18, and as \"nonlabile\" otherwise. A Markov-type autoregressive model that adjusts for previous pulmonary function level, sex, growth variables, and smoking exposures was used to model growth of FEV1, FEF25-75, and FVC. Overall, 135 (73%) of subjects never responded to the cold air challenge, six (3%) always responded, and 43 (24%) responded on one but not all occasions. Levels and rates of increase in level of FEF25-75 were significantly lower in the inconsistent and always responders. In contrast, levels of FVC were greatest and increased most in the always responders. In labile subjects, both FEF25-75 and FEV1 growth rates were reduced. These effects persisted when asthmatics were excluded from the analyses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We examined the extent of correlation between home air nicotine levels and urine cotinine/creatinine ratios (CCR) in 27 children who attended a research day care program where they were not exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) during the daytime hours. Average concentrations of nicotine in home air were determined by active air sampling during the evening and night hours on 2 consecutive days. Urine samples for cotinine and creatinine determinations were collected before, during, and after the two sampling periods. In addition, four sequential weekly urine samples for CCR were obtained from study children to determine the extent to which single determinations of CCR were representative for individual children. Fifteen children resided in homes with smokers, and 12 did not. Urine CCR consistently distinguished most exposed and unexposed children. However, three exposed children had urine CCRs that clustered routinely around the criterion CCR (30 ng/mg cotinine-creatinine) that best distinguished exposed and unexposed children. In children exposed to ETS in the home, there was a significant correlation between average home air nicotine levels and the average logarithm of urine CCR the two mornings after the home air monitoring periods (r = 0.68; p = 0.006). In study children, urine CCRs were remarkably stable over the 1-month observation period. Rank correlation coefficients for sequential weekly determinations of CCR were consistently greater than r = 0.88; p less than 0.0001.\r"

  ".W": "Accurate measurement of cigarette smoke particle size distribution is important for estimation of lung deposition. Most prior investigators have reported a mass median diameter (MMD) in the size range of 0.3 to 0.5 micron, with a small geometric standard deviation (GSD), indicating few ultrafine (less than 0.1 micron) particles. A few studies, however, have suggested the presence of ultrafine particles by reporting a smaller count median diameter (CMD). Part of this disparity may be due tot he inefficiency to previous sizing methods in measuring ultrafine size range, to evaluate size distribution of smoke from standard research cigarettes, commercial filter cigarettes, and from marijuana cigarettes with different delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol contents. Four 35-cm3, 2-s puffs were generated at 60-s intervals, rapidly diluted, and passed through a charge neutralizer and into a 240-L chamber. Size distribution for six cigarettes of each type was measured, CMD and GSD were determined from a computer-generated log probability plot, and MMD was calculated. The size distribution parameters obtained were similar for all cigarettes tested, with an average CMD of 0.1 micron, a MMD of 0.38 micron, and a GSD of 2.0. The MMD found using the EAA is similar to that previously reported, but the CMD is distinctly smaller and the GSD larger, indicating the presence of many more ultrafine particles. These results may explain the disparity of CMD values found in existing data. Ultrafine particles are of toxicologic importance because their respiratory tract deposition is significantly higher than for particles 0.3 to 0.5 micron and because their large surface area facilitates adsorption and delivery of potentially toxic gases to the lung.\r"

Subjects were selected from a pool of 75 normal healthy college-aged males who had been previously exposed to 0.35 ppm O3 for 1 h at an exercising VE of 60 L/min. The selection criterion used was the observed decrement in FEV1 after the O3 exposure: O3-sensitive, FEV1 decrement greater than 24%; O3-nonsensitive, FEV1 decrement less than 11%. Each subject was exposed to filtered air and to 0.20 and 0.35 ppm O3 for 80 min while exercising at a VE of 50 L/min. These experimental protocols were divided into two 40-min sessions separated by a period of 4 to 10 min. PGF2 alpha, FVC, FEV1, and FEF25-75 were evaluated before, during, and after each protocol. SGaw and Vtg were measured before and after each protocol. Plasma PGF2 alpha was significantly increased in the O3-sensitive group during and after the 0.35-ppm O3 exposure.\r"

  ".W": "We describe a technique for the estimation of pulmonary capillary pressure from arterial pressure profiles recorded during occlusion of blood flow in a quasi-intact dog lung preparation. In this preparation, the lower lobe of the left lung was perfused directly by the right ventricle while its venous outflow was collected in a reservoir before being recirculated into the animal. Arterial occlusion maneuvers were accomplished by inflating the balloon of a Swan-Ganz catheter positioned in the left lower lobe artery. The instant of occlusion was precisely determined as the time during the balloon inflation when the pressure inside the balloon reached a maximal value. The arterial pressure profile recorded after inflation of the Swan-Ganz balloon was analyzed in the following manner to estimate the capillary pressure: first, a single exponential approximation of the pressure decay was computed over a short segment of the postocclusion pressure data. The extrapolation of the exponential fit toward the instant of occlusion (Pa0) yielded a first estimate of the capillary pressure. A second estimate was selected as point at which the pressure tracing merged with the exponential fit (Pa0+). These estimates were compared to the double occlusion pressure, which was used as a reference value of the capillary pressure (Pcap). Our results show that the extrapolation of the exponential fit toward the instant of occlusion gave an accurate estimation of the pulmonary capillary pressure over a wide range of pressures: Pa0 = 0.95 (+/- 0.04).Pcap, and the slope of this relationship was not statistically different from 1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Current methods for measurement of chest wall properties assume that resistance (R) and elastance (E) are independent of the volume breathed. In six healthy subjects relaxed at functional residual capacity, we measured total and regional R and E of the chest wall within the range of normal breathing frequencies (0.2 to 0.6 Hz) and tidal volumes (250 to 750 ml), using volume forcing at the mouth as previously described. With these methods, esophageal and gastric pressures are compared with surface displacements measured with inductance plethysmographic belts to calculate R and E of rib cage and diaphragm-abdomen \"pathways.\" Rib cage R and E were 25 to 30% higher than that of the total chest wall at each frequency and volume, whereas diaphragm-abdomen R and E were at least five times higher. R of the chest wall and each of the pathways decreased by about 70% with increasing frequency and by about 30% with increasing tidal volume. E of the chest wall and each of the pathways also decreased by about 30% with increasing tidal volume but was independent of frequency in this range. These results are consistent with nonlinear, viscoplastic models presented elsewhere. We conclude that: (1) despite the great structural differences between the rib cage and diaphragm-abdomen, each exhibits nonlinear behavior similar to that of the total chest wall; (2) chest wall R and E depend importantly on frequency and tidal volume.\r"

SP35 was extracted from the precipitate of the 5% Triton X-100 extraction with pH 10 borate buffer and purified by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. Lipid-SP15 complex was formed by a detergent dialysis method using octylglucopyranoside, and to this complex were added various concentrations of SP35 at 37 degrees C. Structures similar to TM were formed when lipid-SP15 complex containing dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine:phosphatidylglycerol from egg lecithin (2:1) and SP15 (lipid/protein, 5:1) was incubated with SP35 at concentrations of 0.15 to 0.22 mg/ml in CaCl2-containing buffer. At higher concentrations of SP35, many six-sided lattices were formed; the addition of EDTA abolished the formation of these lattice structures. The results suggest that SP15 and SP35 have an important function in the structural organization of lipid membranes to form lattices.\r"

We have studied the synthesis of collagens in fibroblasts cultured from normal and fibrotic human lung specimens and evaluated how it is affected by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). Fibroblasts were obtained from normal and fibrotic adult human lungs (n = 11; normal = 6, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis = 5). They were exposed to TGF-beta and pulse-labeled with [3H]proline and [3H]glycine. Collagen production was measured as bacterial collagenase-susceptible radioactivity, and collagen mRNA levels were determined by a solution hybridization assay using labeled procollagen alpha 1[I] cDNA clone HF677 as probe. Synthesis of collagen types I, III, and V were assessed after separating them by DEAE-cellulose chromatography and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The results showed that both normal and fibrotic lung fibroblasts synthesized similar amounts of collagen. Type I was the major collagen species synthesized by both normal and fibrotic cell types, and the relative proportion of type I, III, and V collagens was similar in both cell types. TGF-beta caused a two to fourfold increase in stimulation of collagen production and collagen mRNA levels, and no differences were detected in the response of normal and fibrotic lung fibroblasts. All collagen types were stimulated by the TGF-beta. TGF-beta did not increase fibroblast proliferation and the majority of normal and fibrotic lung cells exposed to TGF-beta remained in G1 phase of the cell cycle. We conclude that fibroblasts of normal and fibrotic human synthesize similar amounts of collagens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

PATIENTS: Five hundred and three consecutive patients aged 70 and over who received cardiopulmonary resuscitation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 503 patients, 112 (22%) survived initially but only 19 (3.8%) survived to hospital discharge. The poorest outcomes were for patients with unwitnessed arrests (1 of 116 survived), terminal arrhythmias such as asystole and electromechanical dissociation (1 of 237 survived), and patients with cardiopulmonary resuscitation lasting more than 15 minutes (1 of 360 survived). Only 2 (0.8%; CI, 0.0% to 2.0%) of 244 patients with out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary arrests left the hospital alive. Of 259 patients with in-hospital arrests, 17 (6.5%; CI, 3.4% to 9.6%) survived to discharge. Most survivors had ventricular arrhythmias and were resuscitated within minutes. Initial survivors with either impaired consciousness or functional impairment after the arrest had significantly worse chances of survival than patients without these impairments. CONCLUSION: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is rarely effective for elderly patients with cardiopulmonary arrests that are either out-of-hospital, unwitnessed, or associated with asystole or electromechanical dissociation.\r"

DESIGN: Case series of all occupationally related exposures referred for poison control center consultation over 6 months. Follow-up structured interviews were done of exposed persons and health care providers. Cases were traced under established occupational illness reporting programs. SETTING: A regional poison control center. PATIENTS: Consecutive sample of 461 symptomatic occupational exposure cases. After exclusions and losses to follow-up, interview of 301 patients and the treating physician, physician's assistant, or nurse practitioner for the 223 of the patients under direct medical care. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-five persons (61%; CI, 55% to 67%) had systemic or respiratory illness; 109 (36%; CI, 31% to 41%) had eye or skin conditions. Work practices were associated with exposures more often than technical failure; 118 persons (39%; CI, 33% to 45%) reported lack of respirators or other appropriate personal protective equipment. For 223 persons who received direct medical care, only five treating health care providers (2%; CI, 0.2% to 4%) reported occupational specialization, although occupational care was a regular practice activity for 128 of the health care providers (57%; CI, 51% to 63%). Sixty-seven cases (22%; CI, 17% to 27%) were detected by the Doctor's First Report surveillance program; 97 cases (32%; CI, 27% to 37%) comprised the maximal detection estimated for Occupational Safety and Health Administration surveillance. CONCLUSIONS: Poison control center detection provides a useful surveillance measure for occupational illness. The proportion of case detection failures by established surveillance programs suggests that the incidence of occupational illness in the United States, which is calculated from these incomplete programs, may be three to five times greater than previously estimated.\r"

  ".U": "89321244\r", 
  ".W": "The electrophysiologic response of the guinea pig cochlea was monitored after sequential lesions to Reissner's membrane and the round window (RW). Action potential (AP) responses to click stimuli were recorded from the RW before and after discrete puncture-type lesions were created in the cochlear partition of the second turn. Observed decrements were typically minor, comparable to no greater than 10 dB attenuation of stimulus intensity. The RW membranes then were perforated to create perilymphatic fistulas. Further monitoring demonstrated a rapid (within 5 to 10 minutes), severe decrement in AP amplitude and latency, with complete loss of the AP within 1 hour. Control animals with RW perforations alone did not show these decrements. Correct placement of the second turn lesions was documented by histology. We conclude that discrete lesions in the cochlear duct are not reflected in the AP input-output functions unless there is a fluid leak from the RW, and thus present a possible model for idiopathic sudden hearing loss.\r"

Part of the difficulty in evaluating the objective results of postoperative sleep studies has been the variations in reporting data. In addition, no standard of postoperative care, including analgesia, and immediate postoperative monitoring has been described. Our experience with 42 UPPP patients (34 studied with preoperative and postoperative polysomnography) indicates a 76% response (56% successes, and an additional 20% with limited success) with use of the more stringent criteria described recently. We discuss our management of these cases, including postoperative oxygen saturation monitoring and avoidance of narcotic analgesia as necessary factors for success with this operation.\r"

Conventional filters were found to decrease the height of the evoked response in the majority of waveforms compared to zero phase shift filters. A 36-dB/octave zero phase shift high pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 100 Hz produced a 16% reduction in wave amplitude compared to the unfiltered control. A 36-dB/octave, 100-Hz standard phase shift high pass filter produced a 41% reduction, and a 12-dB/octave, 150-Hz standard phase shift high pass filter produced a 38% reduction in wave amplitude compared to the unfiltered control. A decrease in the mean along with an increase in the variability of wave IV/V latency was also noted with conventional compared to zero phase shift filters. The increase in the variability of the latency measurement was due to the difficulty in waveform identification caused by the phase shift distortion of the conventional filter along with the variable decrease in wave latency caused by phase shifting responses with different spectral content. Our results indicated that a zero phase shift high pass filter of 100 Hz was the most desirable filter studied for the mitigation of spontaneous brain activity and random muscle artifact.\r"

Using those images, we have been able to measure these structures in three dimensions. This means that quantitative 3-D measurements can be performed regardless of the angle at which the specimen was cut. This report describes this method for 3-D reconstruction and measurement and discusses its implications. For instance, in addition to showing the 3-D shape of the cochlea from different angles, we have been able to measure the length of the cochlea and have shown that measurements made by use of the conventional 2-D graphic reconstruction method can be distorted considerably by variations in cutting angle of the specimen.\r"

The control animals (group D) received only systemic priming. Immunoglobulin A antibody titers in nasal secretions and saliva from groups A and B significantly exceeded those of groups C and D (p less than .01). Many antigen-specific IgA-forming cells were detected in the respiratory and gastrointestinal mucosae of groups A and B. Following duodenal immunization, the appearance of antigen-specific IgA-forming cells in Peyer's patches preceded those in mesenteric and hilar lymph nodes, while they simultaneously appeared in the lymphoid tissues after tracheal immunization. These findings suggest that intratracheal immunization mainly stimulates bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue as a source of IgA precursors, as intraduodenal immunization stimulates gut-associated lymphoid tissue.\r"

Results could be analyzed in seven dogs: mobility of the vocal cord was checked, and electromyography, stimulation of the nerves, and histologic studies were performed. Functional reinnervation of both the adductor and abductor muscles was obtained in only one case, with good abduction. Adduction was recorded in five cases. False-positive results emphasize the necessity of collecting several types of data before concluding that functional reinnervation has been accomplished. The reliability of the procedure can and must be improved.\r"

One such anomaly, which has not been thoroughly investigated to date, is that accompanying Down syndrome. This report describes histopathologic findings in a temporal bone obtained from a 26-weeks' gestation male fetus with Down syndrome. As compared to a control specimen, its ET was extremely small, mostly collapsed in the midcartilaginous, isthmus, and tympanic portions, and had poorly developed lateral cartilage in the midcartilaginous portion. This is the first case report of such ET anomalies, which appear to be due to an insult to the ET that occurs earlier in fetal life than the 16th gestational week. This insult is possibly a causative factor in postnatal ET dysfunction.\r"

We tested the effect of vocalization, such as counting aloud, on the VOR in ten healthy normal subjects. Velocity-step and sinusoidal stimuli were applied in complete darkness under three test conditions: 1) eyes open, performing mental arithmetic; 2) eyes closed, performing mental arithmetic; and 3) eyes closed and vocalizing. With velocity-step stimuli, eyelid closure significantly reduced VOR gain (peak eye velocity/head velocity) and nystagmus duration, but vocalization reversed these effects and resulted in the highest gain values. Similar results were obtained for VOR gain during sinusoidal stimulation. This study demonstrates that when eyelid closure is necessary or unavoidable during VOR testing, continuous vocalization ensures responses that are comparable to or better than those with eyes open in darkness.\r"

Endolymphatic hydrops could be induced in four of 11 guinea pigs. The striking feature of the electrocochleographic waveform in guinea pigs with endolymphatic hydrops was the negative SP recording in response to high frequency tone bursts. Furthermore, abnormal changes in AP were observed in three of four hydropic guinea pigs. Morphologic study of the cochleas in these three guinea pigs with light microscopy revealed spiral ganglion cell degeneration in addition to endolymphatic hydrops and almost normal sensory hair cells. These results suggest that guinea pigs with hydrops as produced by our procedure can serve as a useful model of Meniere's disease, that autoimmune response may play an important role in the etiopathogenesis of Meniere's disease, and that spiral ganglion cell degeneration together with endolymphatic hydrops seems to contribute to abnormal changes in AP.\r"

Enoxacin bioavailability was not significantly altered when the antacid was given 8 h before or 2 h after enoxacin administration. Ranitidine, administered intravenously 2 h before enoxacin, also significantly decreased enoxacin bioavailability, by 40%. The correlation between the proximity of antacid administration and the magnitude of the decrease in enoxacin bioavailability supports complexation as the mechanism of the antacid-enoxacin interaction. However, reduction of enoxacin bioavailability by ranitidine suggests that elevated gastric pH may also play a role in the antacid-enoxacin drug-drug interaction.\r"

Concentrations in serum and urine were analyzed by a specific gas chromatography assay. Maximum and minimum clindamycin concentrations in serum and the area under the serum concentration-time curve following the first dose were similar to those observed at the steady state. The mean and standard deviation of the maximum, 1-h postdose, and minimum concentrations in serum at steady state for the 600-mg dose given every 6 h were 16.8 +/- 6.0, 7.6 +/- 0.7, and 2.3 +/- 0.9 microgram/ml, whereas for the 1,200-mg dose given every 12 h they were 17.2 +/- 3.5, 9.8 +/- 1.5, and 0.6 +/- 0.3 microgram/ml, respectively. For the 12-h regimen, clindamycin concentrations in serum remained above 2 micrograms/ml for 7 h. The decay of clindamycin phosphate levels in serum was rapid, with virtually 100% of the phosphate eliminated within the first 1.5 h following the dose. Approximately 0.35 and 4.5% of the administered dose were recovered in the urine as clindamycin phosphate and clindamycin, respectively. Further pharmacokinetic evaluation of the 12-hourly dosage regimen should be done before clinical evaluation in infected patients is undertaken.\r"

  ".W": "A fluorometric assay, based on the natural fluorescence of the quinolone nucleus, was used to determine the uptake of ofloxacin by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The ratio of cellular concentration to extracellular concentration (C/E) at 20 min and 37 degrees C was 7.2, using an extracellular concentration of 5 micrograms/ml. Uptake was rapid and was not affected by pH (5 to 9), but required elevated environmental temperature and cell viability. The metabolic inhibitors sodium fluoride and sodium cyanide significantly decreased the uptake of ofloxacin. The penetration of ofloxacin was not affected by the presence of glucose or adenosine, but was decreased by L-amino acids (lysine, leucine, and glycine). These results suggest that ofloxacin could be transported via an amino acid transport system and that the fluorometric assay is a useful method for determining the intracellular penetration of fluoroquinolones, avoiding the use of radiolabeled antimicrobial agents.\r"

  ".W": "Combinations of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine and phosphonoformate produced a moderate synergistic inhibitory effect against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in vitro at concentrations that are easily achieved in humans. The synergistic effect was more pronounced with increasing concentrations and was not secondary to toxic effects of the drugs. 3'-Azido-3'-deoxythymidine neither inhibited the replication of human cytomegalovirus in human embryonic lung fibroblasts nor interfered with the anticytomegalovirus effect of phosphonoformate. By using partially purified reverse transcriptase of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and human cytomegalovirus DNA polymerase, various combinations of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine-5'-triphosphate and phosphonoformate produced strong indications of additive interactions. The synergistic interactions in infected cells and the additive effects observed at the reverse transcriptase level indicate that mechanisms other than the reverse transcriptase may be of importance for the inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus replication by these two compounds. A concomitant treatment of cytomegalovirus infections, such as cytomegalovirus retinitis, with phosphonoformate in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome receiving 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine may be appropriate, and this combination may also be useful in controlling human immunodeficiency virus infection.\r"

Of the 153 isolates, 6 were shown to be resistant to one or more antimicrobial agents. Of the six resistant isolates, five contained R plasmids. All but one of the R plasmids were small (6 to 7 megadaltons) and nonconjugative, encoding resistance to tetracycline or kanamycin, streptomycin, and sulfonamides; the other was large (70 megadaltons) and conjugative, transferring resistance to kanamycin, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and tetracycline to P. multocida and Escherichia coli. The three plasmids encoding resistance to tetracycline alone appeared identical.\r"

This substance, termed reuterin, inhibits the growth of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria as well as yeasts, fungi, and protozoa. Semipreparative chromatography was used to purify reuterin, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were used to establish the molecular weight as well as the molecular functionality of the reuterin molecule. Nuclear magnetic resonance studies of purified reuterin carried out with deuterium oxide confirmed the presence of two three-carbon compounds, beta-hydroxypropionaldehyde and the corresponding hydrated acetal, and a six-carbon cyclic dimer of the aldehyde. Further nuclear magnetic resonance studies with deuterated methanol revealed that in this solvent the compound existed as a three-carbon compound in a methoxy form. Trimethylsilyl derivatives of reuterin were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and a molecule was identified which had a molecular weight corresponding to a disilylated dimeric structure. On the basis of the above information, reuterin was determined to be an equilibrium mixture of monomeric, hydrated monomeric, and cyclic dimeric forms of beta-hydroxypropionaldehyde. This was subsequently confirmed by chemical synthesis.\r"

Drug concentrations were measured in serum, uninfected bone, and infected bone 1 h after daptomycin or vancomycin was injected in a group of rabbits that had been infected for 3 to 4 weeks. Vancomycin was present at the highest concentrations in infected and uninfected bone. The results of this study suggest that daptomycin was similar to vancomycin in the eradication of MRSA from infected bone in an experimental model of osteomyelitis.\r"

  ".W": "The dose and timing of antimicrobial agents given for surgical wound prophylaxis should be based on the concentration-time profile of the drug in tissue at the site of contamination. However, concentrations of antimicrobial agents in surgical wounds are difficult to determine accurately. Since a surgical wound is a unique extravascular compartment with increased vascular permeability and a high surface area/volume ratio, antibiotic concentrations in sera and surgical wounds should be similar. To test this hypothesis, the pharmacokinetics of single intravenous doses of cefazolin (40 mg/kg) and gentamicin (4 mg/kg) in sera and surgical wounds in a clinically relevant surgical model using dogs were compared. Drug concentrations were determined in interstitial fluid in muscle biopsies taken randomly from wound surfaces and serial wound fluid samples collected after the incisions were closed. Protein binding of cefazolin and gentamicin in sera and wound fluids was low (less than or equal to 29 +/- 9%) in this canine model. Cefazolin and gentamicin equilibrated rapidly (less than or equal to 30 min) between serum and the surgical wound, and concentrations in the two sites declined in parallel. Values for the area under the concentration-time curve, mean residence time, and terminal half-life in serum and the surgical site for each drug were similar. Cefazolin concentrations in serum underestimated the time during which concentrations in surgical wounds exceeded the susceptibility breakpoint MIC for important pathogens by an average of 58 min (range, 26 to 109 min; P = 0.036); for gentamicin, the underestimation averaged 30 min (range, 10 to 60 min; P = 0.036).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Statistically significant differences (P less than 0.05) were observed in the following parameters (mean +/- standard deviation) for the 4- and 5-g regimens, respectively: area under the serum concentration-time curve during the dosing interval, 592 +/- 140 versus 772 +/- 151 micrograms.h/ml; terminal elimination rate constant, 0.5364 +/- 0.0912 versus 0.4758 +/- 0.0486 h-1; renal clearance, 87.6 +/- 16.1 versus 76.1 +/- 13.5 ml/min; maximum drug concentration in serum, 381 +/- 89 versus 473 +/- 90 micrograms/ml; and minimum drug concentration in serum, 19 +/- 10 versus 8 +/- 4 micrograms/ml. No significant differences were seen in the following parameters: V1, V beta, k10, k12, k21, total systemic clearance, and nonrenal clearance. These data support the presence of saturable renal elimination of azlocillin, as well as the feasibility of an 8-h dosing interval.\r"

As the pH decreased from 7.4 to 3.0, 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC1/2) increased up to 64-fold. This effect was unrelated to yeast growth rate, solvent concentration, or choice of buffer. Broth microdilution results for 42 Candida albicans isolates at pH 7.4 in synthetic amino acid medium, fungal (SAAMF), showed IC1/2 results from 0.08 to 2.5 micrograms/ml, whereas at pH 3.0 the results were 5.0 or 10.0 micrograms/ml. Fungicidal concentrations were closer to MIC results at the lower pH, i.e., an average of 16-fold above the MIC at pH 3.0, compared with an average 256-fold difference at pH 7.4. Two strains that had very different IC1/2 results at pH 7.4 and identical IC1/2 results at pH 3.0 were found to be equally susceptible to cilofungin therapy in rats. In additional studies, other medium effects were demonstrable, with yeast nitrogen broth and minimal essential medium generally yielding higher results than two other synthetic media (SAAMF and RPMI 1640 medium). However, susceptibility results did not change with inoculum between 10(2) and 10(5) yeast cells per ml or temperature between 30 and 37 degrees C. These studies indicate that pH is an important influence on in vitro rank order susceptibility of pathogenic yeasts to cilofungin.\r"

At the end of induction, 9 of 10 patients had stabilized (no new retinal lesions and stable old lesions [7 patients]) or improved (decreased retinal opacification [2 patients]). All eight patients with CMV in urine or blood upon entry into the study had negative urine and blood cultures at the end of induction. After induction therapy, seven patients continued maintenance foscarnet therapy, 60 mg/kg as a single daily infusion, 5 days/week. In six patients, retinal lesions increased in size after 2 to 32 weeks of maintenance therapy. One was invaluable because a retinal detachment developed. Only 9 of 42 blood and urine cultures obtained during maintenance foscarnet therapy yielded CMV, compared with 7 of 14 obtained prior to the initiation of foscarnet induction therapy (P = 0.04). Foscarnet toxicity was mild and infrequent: elevation in serum creatinine by 0.5 to 1.3 mg/dl over the base line (two patients), muscle twitching (three patients), hemoglobin decrease by 1 mg/dl (two patients), nausea (two patients), absolute neutrophil count decrease by 50% (one patient), rise in serum phosphorus to greater than 5.5 mg/dl (four patients), and proteinuria (two patients). Intermittently administered intravenous foscarnet appears to be an effective, relatively nontoxic therapy for CMV retinitis. Additional studies to determine the optimal dosage for maintenance therapy are needed, as are comparative trials with ganciclovir.\r"

Both radioactivity and bioactivity of [14C]clarithromycin in plasma and tissues were found to be significantly higher than those of [14C]erythromycin at the same oral dose of 20 mg/kg (body weight). Among the tissues, the peak level of [14C]clarithromycin in the lung was especially high. Levels of radioactivity and bioactivity amounted to 15 and 73 times the corresponding levels of [14C]erythromycin. In the urine, bioactivity recovered after administration of [14C]clarithromycin was sevenfold higher than that for [14C]erythromycin. This accounted for about 60 and 20% of the total radioactivity in the urine for [14C]clarithromycin and [14C]erythromycin, respectively. An examination of metabolites in the urine for [14C]clarithromycin revealed appreciable amounts of bioactive unchanged clarithromycin. These results indicate that clarithromycin has pharmacokinetic properties superior to those of erythromycin. The desirable properties of clarithromycin include high levels in plasma resulting from its high stability in gastric acid; a high tissue affinity, especially to the lung; and favorable urinary excretion.\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective study of Chlamydia trachomatis infection in pregnancy, 198 mothers positive for chlamydial antigen were identified; the infants of 174 were followed for up to six months and C trachomatis was recovered in cell culture from 43 infants (25%). Conjunctivitis occurred in significantly more infants who were positive for C trachomatis (20 of 43, 47%) than in those who were negative (18 of 131, 14%). There were also significantly more lower respiratory tract infections among infants with positive cultures (six of 43, 14%, compared with three of 131, 2%). The chlamydial antigen enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was positive in 61 of 131 infants from whom C trachomatis was not recovered in cell culture. False positive results were usually associated with the isolation of Staphylococcus aureus from samples of pharyngeal aspirate. Our results confirm that C trachomatis infection is a common cause of neonatal conjunctivitis, and respiratory infection in the first few months of life, with an incidence of 8.2/1000 live births. Because the infection is easily treated by oral erythromycin, however, screening during pregnancy is not warranted.\r"

There was increased ingestion of S aureus by normal human granulocytes in the presence of fresh serum prepared after infusion of immunoglobulin and significantly increased opsonic activity of heat inactivated serum after treatment with immunoglobulin. The haemolytic activity of complement and concentrations of complement C3 were not influenced, and serum concentrations of IgG increased as the result of receiving a total of 800-900 mg/kg immunoglobulin over a period of three days. This study shows that administration of acid treated IgG to septic infants leads to functionally increased opsonisation.\r"

There was no significant difference in the rates of seroconversion, seroconversion had occurred in all patients by seven months. There were no significant differences in antibody titres between the intramuscular and intradermal groups at 1, 2, and 6 months. Although the titres were significantly higher in the intramuscular group at seven months and at 12-18 months, the antibody titre in the intradermal group did not fall below 10 IU/l. The results of this study suggest that low dose intradermal hepatitis B vaccination is an effective and economical way of stimulating an immune response in patients with beta thalassaemia and sickle cell disease.\r"

Nasal mucociliary clearance times were analysed according to clinical history (asthma, rhinitis, asthma with rhinitis, and acute upper respiratory tract infections), laboratory findings (positive skin test responses and bronchial hyper-reactivity assessed by methacholine challenge), and parental smoking. Nasal mucociliary clearance times showed a narrow coefficient of repeatability (six minutes) in 50 subjects and there was substantial agreement between the two tests. Nasal mucociliary clearance times were less than 40 minutes in all the children. Normal children had nasal mucociliary clearance times of less than 24 minutes while significantly impaired nasal mucociliary clearance was detected in those with positive skin reactions and a positive response to methacholine challenge. We were unable to show that passive smoking had any consistent effect on nasal mucociliary clearance. We suggest that a time response between 30-60 minutes should be checked again at least two weeks later, and that children in whom repeated saccharin tests show a nasal mucociliary clearance of greater than 30 minutes should have ciliary beat frequency estimated.\r"

If oesophageal strictures were present, endoscopy and bouginage with corticosteroid prophylaxis during the quiescent phase of the disease was a safe and useful procedure. We have also given corticosteroids, which reduced the oedema caused by bullae formation and oral phenytoin, which reduced epithelial detachment by inhibiting collagenase activity. Verapamil counteracted oesophageal spasm and pureed food during periods of dysphagia reduced blistering of the upper oesophagus.\r"

The distribution of anomalies differed considerably, with 60% of the index cases having seven or more, and 94% of the controls having three or less. The number occurring in the patients was significantly more than in their relatives. Of the 25 patients with more than four anomalies, 16 (64%) had undergone potentially adverse perinatal or early postnatal events. Thus minor congenital anomalies were considerably more frequent in those with ataxic cerebral palsy than in related or unrelated control subjects. These anomalies may be markers of early prenatal factors that contributed to the adverse outcome either directly or by predisposing to perinatal difficulties.\r"

Neuro-developmental evaluation was carried out at 2.2-2.5 years. Eight infants died with, and eight without, hypoxic-ischaemic lesions of the brain, 14 had cerebral palsy, 16 had mild motor impairment, six had developmental delay without motor impairment, and 96 were normal at follow up. Infants who died with brain injury had significantly higher CK-BB activity than infants with normal outcomes (geometric mean 12 U/l); the mean difference was 82 U/l with a 95% confidence interval from 31 to 219 U/l. CK-BB in infants with cerebral palsy and mild motor impairment (geometric means 12 and 15 U/l, respectively) were similar to controls. CK-BB activity after birth is predictive of neonatal death but not of neurological damage in survivors.\r"

Growth hormone profiles were analysed by the PULSAR programme and results expressed as the sum of growth hormone pulse amplitudes. Six patients had abnormal growth hormone pulse frequencies. In the remaining 28, growth hormone pulse amplitudes declined significantly with increasing age, but there was no correlation between growth hormone pulse amplitudes and growth rates. Concentrations of insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) rose with age but did not correlate with either growth rates or growth hormone secretion. Fifteen patients were given oxandrolone and 11 low dose ethinyl oestradiol. Both agents increased height velocity without increasing growth hormone secretion. We conclude that the relation between growth hormone secretion and growth in Turner's syndrome is less certain than in normal children. End organ resistance is probably due to a skeletal dysplasia. Both oxandrolone and low dose ethinyl oestradiol improve the growth of girls with Turner's syndrome, but their mechanism of action remains uncertain.\r"

Chemotherapy further increased the incidence of thyroid dysfunction: two of four patients who had cranial irradiation and chemotherapy and 20 of 29 patients (69%) who had spinal irradiation and chemotherapy had increased thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations. Only six patients with raised thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations had low serum thyroxine concentrations. Four children had secondary hypothyroidism. Thyroid function should be monitored in children who have received chemotherapy or radiotherapy. A rise in thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations is the most sensitive indicator of thyroid dysfunction. Children with raised thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations should be treated with thyroxine.\r"

This pattern was tied more closely to the time of putting down than time of day. The extent and rate of temperature fall did not correlate with any feature of the thermal environment. We also found that skin temperature changed much less than rectal temperature over the night, and for the first two hours in the cot there was no relation between skin and rectal temperature. There is therefore a well organised, endogenous rhythm of temperature in 4 month old infants.\r"

Minimum room temperature correlated with outside temperature, but most rooms were heated to some degree; smaller babies were kept in warmer rooms. The tog value of clothing before putting the baby down averaged 5.1, supplemented by 9.6 tog units of wrapping in the cot--a 188% increase for a 4.4 degrees C drop in temperature. Total tog of clothing and wrapping correlated negatively with minimum room temperature; smaller born babies tended to be more heavily wrapped.

Significant linear correlation existed between yellow colour of the skin and serum bilirubin concentration, reciprocal of the reserve albumin concentration, and the squared hydrogen ion concentration. Furthermore, the basic yellowness of the skin at birth correlated linearily with the yellow colour of the skin measured when the child became jaundiced. The results support the proposed hypothesis that bilirubin is transferred from plasma to skin through two different mechanisms: (a) leakage of bilirubin-albumin complexes into extravascular spaces and (b) precipitation of bilirubin acid in phospholipid membranes. The latter mechanism suggests that measurement of the yellow colour of the skin may be a better predictor of brain damage than the serum bilirubin concentration and thus be of clinical utility. Measurement of the yellow colour of the skin as a method of obtaining serum bilirubin concentration is unreliable.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted a 6-y follow-up study that included workers in an aluminum smelter in British Columbia. Of the original cohort, 951 workers left the industry and 985 workers participated in both studies. Comparison of those who left and those who remained showed that those who left were (1) older, (2) had a slightly higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms, and (3) had lower lung function; this was especially true for workers who were 50 + y of age at the time the initial study was conducted. Analyses were conducted only on 586 male workers who did not change their job location or smoking habits between the initial and the follow-up study. Potroom workers in the \"high-exposure\" group had a significant reduction in the prevalence of cough, but experienced an increase in the prevalence of wheeze. There was no significant difference in the annual decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 sec and forced vital capacity between the potroom workers and controls. In general, older workers and smokers had a greater decline in lung function compared to younger workers and nonsmokers. Leukocyte count done during the initial study was found to be an independent predictor of longitudinal decline in lung function. The lack of exposure effect on longitudinal decline in lung function could be due to \"healthy worker\" effect and improvement in the working condition of the smelter.\r"

We describe a series of 14 cases of lead poisoning in ironworkers cutting a lead-painted bridge in New York City. Peak blood lead levels ranged from 2.32 to 5.80 mumol/l (48-120 micrograms/dl). Median duration of employment was 4 wk. Two workers required chelation therapy. Personal (breathing zone) exposures to airborne lead ranged from 600 to 4,000 micrograms/m3. Construction workers are specifically exempted from the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) lead standard. The data from this study indicate that such exemption is not warranted. A need exists for improved protection of construction workers against occupational exposure to lead.\r"

  ".W": "Work history records and fitness reports were obtained for 1,767 marine inspectors of the U.S. Coast Guard between 1942 and 1970 and for a comparison group of 1,914 officers who had never been marine inspectors. Potential exposure to chemicals was assessed by one of the authors (RP), who is knowledgeable about marine inspection duties. Marine inspectors and noninspectors had a deficit in overall mortality compared to that expected from the general U.S. population (standardized mortality ratios [SMRs = 79 and 63, respectively]). Deficits occurred for most major causes of death, including infectious and parasitic diseases, digestive and urinary systems, and accidents. Marine inspectors had excesses of cirrhosis of the liver (SMR = 136) and motor vehicle accidents (SMR = 107), and cancers of the lymphatic and hematopoietic system (SMR = 157), whereas noninspectors had deficits for these causes of death. Comparison of mortality rates directly adjusted to the age distribution of the inspectors and noninspectors combined also demonstrated that mortality for these causes of death was greater among inspectors than noninspectors (directly adjusted ratio ratios of 190, 145, and 198) for cirrhosis of the liver, motor vehicle accidents, and lymphatic and hematopoietic system cancer, respectively. The SMRs rose with increasing probability of exposure to chemicals for motor vehicle accidents, cirrhosis of the liver, liver cancer, and leukemia, which suggests that contact with chemicals during inspection of merchant vessels may be involved in the development of these diseases among marine inspectors.\r"

Samples were obtained during removal of an old coal-tar pitch roof and application of a new asphalt roof. Skin wipes were obtained immediately before and after the workshift. Anthracene was present in air but not skin samples. In air samples, the relative concentrations of seven PAHs were fluoranthene greater than pyrene greater than benzanthracene greater than benzo[a]pyrene greater than benzo[b]fluoranthene greater than benzo[ghi]perylene greater than benzo[k]fluoranthene. A similar pattern, or rank concentration, was observed in matching skin wipe samples. The amount (ng) of PAH (either total or individual compounds) found in skin wipes taken after the workday was significantly correlated with that in air samples (micrograms/m3, time-weighted average) for 8 of the 9 cases with air and skin samples taken the same day (r = 0.99 for total PAH). Skin wipe PAH residues were not significantly correlated with air samples taken 4 d earlier. These findings suggest that skin wipes can provide a useful measure of exposure to PAH.\r"

Questionnaire responses revealed higher prevalences of cough and shortness of breath on exercise among the tobacco workers than controls. Cigarette smoking was the same in the two groups, but tobacco workers also smoked cheroots. Significantly decreased values (p less than .01) of forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1.0) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were found among tobacco workers compared to referents. After adjusting for number of cigarettes and cheroots smoked, there remained no significant differences. There was a suggestion (p less than .10) of decreased FEV1.0 among light or nonsmoking tobacco workers. When cigarette consumption only was considered, this difference was significant (p less than .01). Lung function values were not associated with the very low measured dust exposures. Bronchial reactivity to inhaled histamine, diurnal and weekly changes in FEV1.0, skin-prick tests with tobacco extracts, and precipitating serum antibodies to tobacco extracts and extracts of microorganisms were similar to that expected in a nonexposed population. Differences in lung function between the two groups may result from excess cheroot consumption and higher previous exposure to tobacco dust among the tobacco workers.\r"

The total concentration of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) in cigarette smoke was approximately 5.0 micrograms/m3 at the maximum level, whereas various congeners from tetra-octa-chlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (-CDD) were detected. Particullary, the total concentration of hepta-CDD congeners was the highest among these congeners. Mass fragmentograms of various PCDD congeners were similar to those in flue gas samples collected from a municipal waste incinerator. The PCDD congeners that were not present in the cigarettes were found in the smoke samples. The 2,3,7,8-TCDD toxic equivalent value--an index for effects on humans--for total PCDDs in smoke was 1.81 ng/m3 using the toxic factor of the United States Environment Protection Agency. Daily intake of PCDDs by smoking 20 cigarettes was estimated to be approximately 4.3 pg.kg body weight/day. This value was close to that of the ADIs: 1-5 pg.kg body weight/day reported in several countries. A heretofore unrecognized health risk was represented by the presence of PCDDs in cigarette smoke.\r"

The Mn concentrations in areas A, B, and C were 3.6-14.6 micrograms/l, 81.6-252.6 micrograms/l, and 1 800-2 300 micrograms/l, respectively. A random sample (62 in area A, 49 in area B, and 77 in area C) of males and females who were at least 50 y of age were submitted to a thorough neurological examination and their whole-blood Mn and hair Mn concentrations were determined. Although all areas were similar with respect to social and dietary characteristics, significant differences were observed for prevalence of chronic manganese poisoning (CMnP) symptoms and hair Mn concentration. The means (both sexes) of neurological scores were 2.7, 3.9, and 5.2, respectively, for areas A, B, and C (Kruskal-Wallis, chi 2 = 6.44, 2 df, p less than .05 for males; chi 2 = 7.8, 2 df, p less than .05 for females). Hair Mn concentrations were also significantly different, the means for which were 3.51, 4.49, and 10.99 micrograms/g dry weight, respectively (both sexes [p less than .001 for each sex separately]). These results indicate that progressive increases of Mn concentration in drinking water are associated with progressively higher prevalences of neurological signs of CMnP and Mn concentration in hair of older persons.\r"

  ".W": "A sample of 50 DSM-III-diagnosed schizophrenics (mean age, 34 years) intentionally biased to contain a relatively high proportion of persistently unemployed persons was compared with a sample of 87 normal volunteers on three computed tomographic measures. These were lateral ventricle-brain ratio, regional brain computed tomographic density values, and brain slice area. Images were made with the same computed tomographic scanner and identical scan parameters. Computed tomographic data were assessed blindly using a computer-linked image array processor and electronic planimeter. Ventricle-brain ratios were significantly higher in schizophrenics, with 28% of the patient sample exceeding 2 SDs of the control mean. Brain area measures were not associated with an enlarged ventricle-brain ratio. Contrary to our prediction, ventricular enlargement was unassociated with most negative symptom ratings, but was correlated with the absence of positive symptoms. A history of abnormal delivery and the presence of left-handedness were significant predictors of an enlarged ventricle-brain ratio on multiple regression analysis. Schizophrenics had a significantly smaller brain slice area compared with normal controls, a finding not attributable to height differences between groups. Brain slice area was inversely correlated with computed tomographic brain density across all subjects. After correction of computed tomographic density values for area using a linear regression model, no significant regional density differences were detectable between normal controls and schizophrenics. Within normal controls there was a significant relationship between social class and brain slice area, but not ventricle-brain ratio.\r"

Overall, ten of the 18 computed tomography (CT) features measured were significantly enlarged in the schizophrenic group. These abnormal CT features were then correlated with electrophysiological and clinical measurements performed on the schizophrenic patients. Left sylvian fissure enlargement, thought to reflect temporal lobe tissue loss, was highly correlated with a left temporal scalp region feature of the auditory P300 measure (T3 electrode) that differentiated schizophrenics and normals, and both the left sylvian fissure enlargement and the P300 measure were highly correlated with positive symptoms (total score on the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms). Frontal superficial (cortical) sulcal enlargement was prominent in the schizophrenic group and was highly correlated with another electrophysiological measure, auditory P200, at left central scalp locations. There was no significant correlation between left sylvian fissure and frontal sulcal enlargement within the schizophrenic group, and intercorrelations between CT variables in the schizophrenic group were, in general, less significant than in the control group. Although we should be cautious about generalizability because of the small number of patients, these data are compatible with the hypothesis that different subgroups of schizophrenic pathological features are characterized by different CT, electrophysiological, and clinical presentations.\r"

These data supported the validity of the positive-negative distinction in schizophrenia but challenged basic assumptions about its import.\r"

The measurements performed in monkeys indicated that the retinal thickness can be visualized in a region extending from the optic disc to the fovea and that quantitative results can be obtained. The retinal thickness reproducibility was 6% for the same location on the same day, 15% for the same location on different days, and 12% for the same location in different eyes. The average retinal thickness in these areas was 335 microns, indicating that the reproducibility was between 20 and 50 microns. Measurements across the foveola illustrated that retinal thicknesses as low as 80 microns could be obtained.\r"

Cell damage after traumatic lens insertion was significantly greater in the groups treated with BSS Plus (76.2%) and Healon (41.4%) than in either paired Viscoat-treated group (21.1% and 17.4%, respectively). Viscoat (but not Healon) was noted to be adherent to the cornea at the end of the procedure in one third of the cases, indicating that Viscoat remains in the anterior chamber during surgery.

The effects of reinjecting each combination a second or third time, separated by 48-hour intervals, were also examined by ophthalmoscopy and light and transmission electron microscopy.

After two injections, five of six eyes with vancomycin-gentamicin therapy and three of six eyes with vancomycin-amikacin therapy displayed focal areas of retinal toxic reaction on histologic study. After three injections, all eyes treated with either regimen showed histologic evidence of more advanced retinal toxic reaction primarily involving the outer retina and retinal pigment epithelium. The present study demonstrates the safety of an initial intravitreal injection of vancomycin and aminoglycoside but shows increasing retinal toxic reaction with repetitive combination therapy.\r"

The LOCS II can be used to grade patients' cataracts at the slit lamp or to grade slit-lamp and retroillumination photographs; it is easy to learn and can be applied consistently by different observers. We obtained very good interobserver reproducibility of the clinical gradings at the slit lamp, excellent intraobserver reproducibility, very good to excellent interobserver reproducibility of photographic gradings, and good agreement between clinical and photographic gradings. The LOCS II is potentially useful for both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of cataract.\r"

In 26 (100%) of 26 eyes, the artery lay anterior to the vein, toward the vitreous cavity. A control group was obtained by evaluating the relative anatomic position between the branch retinal artery and vein at an equivalent crossing site along the opposite vascular arcade within the same eye. In the control crossing sites, the artery lay anterior to the vein 65% (15/23) of the time. We conclude that the likelihood that the artery will lie anterior to the obstructed vein at the site of blockage in a branch retinal vein obstruction is substantially greater than what would be expected by chance alone. This anatomic relationship between artery and vein probably plays a role in the cause of a branch retinal vein obstruction and may have therapeutic significance in light of a recent report concerning surgical treatment of such obstructions.\r"

Findings in these patients were compared with the findings, retrieved from the databank of the American Rheumatism Association Medical Information System, on 153 similarly treated RA patients. All 546 patients were surveyed prospectively, using the Health Assessment Questionnaire and information abstracted from hospital records. The 2 groups were closely similar in clinical characteristics. The most frequently reported side effects of AZA treatment were nausea, vomiting, and leukopenia. Gastrointestinal intolerance accounted for nearly 60% of therapy interruptions in 95 patients. Of 81 hospitalizations for all causes, only 8 may have been related in part to AZA, and no deaths were attributed to AZA therapy. No lymphomas or leukemias were encountered and the overall frequency of neoplasms was not significantly different from that seen in RA patients receiving conventional therapy. As used in the treatment of RA, AZA has a surprisingly benign profile with relatively few serious therapeutic mishaps.\r"

The severity of disease demonstrated no significant relationship to measures of outcome. Multiple regression analyses revealed that psychological variables explained a substantial proportion of the variance in outcome scores, even after disease activity was taken into account. Our study highlights the discrepancies between biomedical measures of disease severity and activity and patient outcome in a rheumatoid arthritis population, and our observations suggest that some of these discrepancies may be explained by psychological variables.\r"

  ".W": "Inhibition of chondrocyte proteoglycan (PG) synthesis is one of the mechanisms leading to cartilage destruction in joint inflammation. Using murine cartilage from normal and arthritic knee joints, we examined this process. We found that for normal, anatomically intact murine articular cartilage, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is a potent anabolic factor. Recombinant IGF-1 at physiologic concentrations in a completely synthetic medium sustained PG synthesis, at the in vivo rate, of patellar cartilage in organ culture. Using an experimental arthritis model, we found that cartilage from an arthritic joint could not be stimulated in vitro with IGF-1. This nonresponsiveness was not caused by a generalized metabolic inhibition of the chondrocytes, because PG synthesis in arthritic cartilage could still be stimulated by forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase. Our data suggest that during joint inflammation, inhibition of chondrocyte PG synthesis is, at least partially, caused by a defect in the IGF-1 responsiveness of the chondrocyte. We propose this finding as a possible pathogenetic mechanism for cartilage destruction in joint diseases.\r"

For 6-8 weeks after each plasma infusion, there was a full clinical remission of the SLE, and a brief restoration of hemolytic complement activity. However, there were more prolonged increases in the activities of the complement components that are believed to be more directly involved in the clearance of immune complexes. Because of the theoretical risk that the infused complement might enhance inflammatory tissue damage, there has been some reluctance to try plasma replacement therapy in SLE patients with complement deficiency. We have not observed any adverse effects with the long-term use of this treatment, and our experience indicates that this therapeutic approach can be beneficial.\r"

Fifty-one patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were screened for the presence of the MX homolog in mononuclear cells and for IFN and anti-IFN antibodies in serum. In 47 of 51 patients, significant levels of the MX homolog were found, while only 15 of 51 patients had measurable alpha-IFN in their serum. The IFN activity found in these sera was characterized as a partially acid-labile alpha-IFN, by means of acid-stability cross-reactivity on heterologous cells, trypsin sensitivity, and neutralization by homologous or heterologous antisera. Four of the patients had no detectable MX homolog in their leukocytes; 3 of these 4 possessed an anti-alpha-IFN antibody that was able to neutralize both a natural alpha-IFN preparation and the acid-labile IFN in SLE sera. Also, acid-labile alpha-IFN-containing SLE sera induced the MX homolog in vitro in mononuclear cells from healthy donors. These observations suggest that endogenously produced alpha-IFN is responsible for the observed induction of the MX homolog in SLE and that the IFN system is activated in more than 90% of SLE patients.\r"

The evidence and experience to date support the assertion that satisfactory--and in some ways special--physicians can be prepared using the \"McMaster approach\" to medical education, but that continuous review and periodic major revisions of the educational program are both necessary and possible; they must occur in concert with developments in other sectors of Faculty of Health Sciences activities.\r"

The test was constructed after identifying those clinical skills considered to be suitable for testing in a large-scale examination conducted at multiple locations. The test was given to 635 foreign medical graduates (including 53 U.S. citizens) who had been certified by the ECFMG and to a reference sample of 123 graduates of U.S. medical schools. All of the graduates took the test prior to their first postgraduate year of training. The results did not differ significantly from those of a previous test. The clinical skills of 28% of the graduates of foreign medical schools who took the examination were found to be inadequate when compared with those of graduates of U.S. schools. The conclusion reached was that a clinical skills examination is feasible for inclusion in the ECFMG certification process.\r"

  ".W": "In October 1988, seven foreign medical graduates participated in the first administration of the examination devised by the Medical Education Evaluation Program (MEEP) mandated by the State Medical Board of Ohio. The MEEP was established to provide an objective evaluation of an applicant's clinical competencies; passing the MEEP examination was intended to certify that the applicant's clinical skills were comparable to those of a medical student graduating from a school accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. An applicant who successfully passed the MEEP examination and fulfilled the other Ohio licensure requirements would be eligible to take the Federation Licensing Examination (FLEX) and apply for an unrestricted license to practice medicine in Ohio. The paper describes the origin and development of the MEEP examination and the testing modalities selected (multiple-choice examinations and the use of standardized patients). Four fundamental areas were tested; these are named and described, along with the method for calculating scores for each area and the criteria for passing the different components of the examination. Although the small sample size prohibited meaningful data analysis for the performance of the first group of MEEP candidates, the MEEP examination appears to meet psychometric standards of certifying and licensing examinations, based on data from comparable tests taken by beginning fourth-year medical students in New England and NBME Part III examination examinees. Some potential pitfalls of the MEEP examination are mentioned, as well as the fact that it presents a challenge to boards of medical examiners of other states to implement performance-based assessments of physicians who graduate from non-accredited medical schools.\r"

The author attempted both to estimate the probability of an accepted applicant's matriculating at the institution and to demonstrate the relative effects of selected variables on the applicant's final decision. Through the use of the maximum-likelihood estimation technique, the resulting model indicated that probability ranges for matriculation may be derived using data available from computerized student records.

The two types of materials--questionnaires and the Problem-Case Analysis--were developed by the staff of the AAMC program and used by the LSU Department of Medicine and the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology to identify problems in the process of evaluating clerks. Furthermore, the two methods proved complementary: both methods identified some of the same problems and each identified problems not identified by the other. Handling difficult students was the single problem identified by both methods in both departments. The questionnaires permit a simple method of collecting data about a broad range of problems. The Problem-Case Analysis, on the other hand, requires more time but evokes possible causes and alternative solutions, as well as identifying the problems. Improvement plans were developed by each department to address the problems that surfaced.\r"

The students were in the classes of 1986 and 1987 at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine. The correlations of the admissions measures with clinical performances were quite weak, and none of the admissions measures consistently showed a clear advantage as a predictor of clinical performance. Correlations of the admissions measures with scores on National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Part I and Part II examinations were small to moderate, although somewhat larger than the correlations with clinical performances. Correlations were corrected for attenuation due to differential unreliabilities of the clinical examination results and the scores on NBME examinations, and for restriction of range due to the stringent medical school selection process. Corrected correlations were small to moderate and showed the same pattern as the uncorrected ones. The study documents that traditional admissions measures are useful for selecting students who will perform effectively in clinical as well as basic science settings.\r"

In this preliminary communication, we report our experience with long-term blood pressure control in severe hypertensives who were treated with up to 150 mg of nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS)--a once daily nifedipine formulation. In 23 subjects with diastolic blood pressures greater than 120 mm Hg, treatment was begun with nifedipine capsules for immediate reduction of diastolic blood pressure to less than 110 mm Hg. Doppler echocardiography was used to measure LV mass, percent LV fractional shortening (%FS), and cardiac output (CO). To achieve a goal diastolic blood pressure of less than 95 mm Hg, the 22 subjects who responded to nifedipine capsules were titrated up to 150 mg of nifedipine GITS. To date, 12 subjects completed two months of goal blood pressure with nifedipine GITS. CO, heart rate (HR), and %FS were elevated following nifedipine capsules. During long-term therapy with nifedipine GITS, CO and HR returned to baseline, while %FS remained elevated. These preliminary data suggest that in patients with severe hypertension, effective long-term control of BP with a once-a-day dosage of nifedipine in the GITS formulation may be achieved without adverse hemodynamic effects.\r"

  ".W": "A new argon beam coagulator system promises a radically different form of electrocoagulation. Rarely does a tool make such an important contribution to the surgical armamentarium. This instrument reduces blood loss by up to half via rapid superficial coagulation, even when severe bleeding occurs. It causes minimal tissue damage, coagulates large vessels (2 to 3 mm in diameter), reduces the risk of postoperative hemorrhage, and markedly reduces operative time. Since the coagulation is superficial, healing appears to be unimpaired. We describe our experience with this new instrument (video tape recordings demonstrating its use in surgical procedures are available).\r"

Complications were few and minor in nature. Effectiveness was judged from the audiometric data obtained from the 96 patients in the hearing part of this study, all of whom had improved hearing with the device. The mean preoperative pure-tone air-conduction three-frequency average threshold +/- SD in the implanted ear was 55.8 +/- 10.7-dB hearing level; postoperative average aided warble-tone threshold was 19.9 +/- 8.5-dB hearing level. The average improvement in threshold was 36.0 +/- 13.3 dB. Ninety-three percent of patients achieved socially adequate hearing, ie, mean aided sound-field thresholds of at least 30-dB hearing level, and 81% had thresholds of at least 25-dB hearing level. We conclude that the XOMED Audiant Bone Conductor is a safe and effective device for the surgical correction of conductive hearing loss.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of the present study was to determine the degree of hearing impairment caused by tympanosclerosis of the eardrum as a result of grommet insertion. During the period 1977 to 1978 we treated 146 children who had bilateral secretory otitis with adenoidectomy, insertion of a ventilation tube on the right side, and myringotomy on the left. The children were reexamined 2 to 3 years and again 6 to 7 years postoperatively, and hearing was evaluated at 250, 1000, and 4000 Hz. Tympanosclerosis was demonstrated in 59% of the children on the side with grommet insertion compared with 13% in the contralateral ear. Hearing was slightly inferior in ears with tympanosclerosis compared with ears without tympanosclerosis, but the difference was small and nonsignificant. The hearing impairment caused by tympanosclerosis was less than 0.5 dB, which is inconsequential and cannot serve as an argument against the use of ventilation tubes. However, further studies with longer observation periods are warranted.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty years of treating secretory otitis media by what is presently considered an alternate approach is discussed. Early experience with using a polyethylene tube in one ear only led to a formal study of the efficacy of polyethylene tube use when combined with adenoidectomy or adenotonsillectomy. This study included 31 children with chronic bilateral secretory otitis media treated by tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. At the time of surgery, one ear was intubated and the other served as a control with no treatment. Using audiometric criteria, it was found that there was no significant difference between the intubated and control ears after a 6- to 8-week follow-up. Also documented is a series of 425 children suffering from chronic secretory otitis media, all of whom were resistant to prior ear, nose, and throat or pediatric treatment. Fifty-three children had tonsillectomies and adenoidectomies without tube insertion and were followed up for at least 1 year. Audiometry was used to measure the result of therapy that was successful in more than 90% of the patients.\r"

Ranitidine induces an improvement in scores of subjective and objective symptoms, a decrease in total serum IgE levels, and no significant variations in Parietaria IgE antibody levels. Since H2 antagonists seem to induce these improvements by acting on suppressor T cells bearing H2 receptor, as shown in our previous studies, it is hypothesized that the lymphocytic subset that regulates the total IgE synthesis is not the same as that governing specific IgE synthesis.\r"

The use of a sublabial incision for direct visualization and alignment of the fracture lines at the infraorbital rim and lateral maxillary buttress is described. When coupled with single miniplate fixation of the zygoma across the frontozygomatic suture, the sublabial approach results in improved reduction of the fractures with rigid stabilization. Our experience with this approach, as well as with two-point wire fixation and with miniplate fixation without sublabial exposure, is reviewed.\r"

Detailed preoperative analysis of surgical candidates has not been reported. Twenty models studied by photogrammetry of frontal, lateral, and oblique views were analyzed to synthesize ideal measurements of an aesthetic face with particular attention to points describing the malar mound. Photographs of patients operated on were analyzed using computer graphics to compare the synthesized ideal and surgical results. Ideal candidates are defined as those patients with ptotic malar mounds with adequate soft tissue to create a balanced and harmonious result. Examples of candidates and potential pitfalls are presented.\r"
