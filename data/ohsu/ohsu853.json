The problems of restenosis, diffuse disease, and total occlusions persist despite the demonstrated efficacy of balloon angioplasty. During the past 5 years, a variety of laser devices and catheter designs have demonstrated usefulness in the treatment of peripheral vascular disease. Initial success rates of 70-90% have been reported in occluded femoropopliteal arteries. Further clinical trials are warranted to compare the relative efficacy of these devices with each other and conventional therapies. Thermal ablative devices have not yet shown great promise for treatment of coronary disease. Modified versions of these devices as well as nonthermally acting excimer lasers are promising as clinical tools for enhancing our ability to nonsurgically revascularize patients, and trials with these devices are now underway.\r"

  ".W": "Restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) probably results from pathophysiological mechanisms that are initiated during PTCA. Platelet deposition or exposed subendothelial connective tissue initiates complex blood element and vessel wall interactions that are not completely understood and leads to a proliferative response at the site of injury. The incidence of restenosis is also related to clinical, anatomic, and procedural variables. An increased frequency of restenosis is seen in patients who have recent onset of angina, unstable angina, or vasospastic angina, and in those who have diabetes. Stenoses in the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery, the ostium of the right coronary artery, and the proximal portion of a bypass vein graft have higher rates of restenosis than lesions at other sites. Restenosis can be predicted by an incomplete PTCA, which is identified by a high residual pressure gradient across the stenosis. Mechanical and pharmacological methods of preventing restenosis are under investigation. Intravascular stenting with expandable metal sleeves and laser angioplasty have shown encouraging results. Longer balloon inflation time can help prevent early elastic recoil. Platelet inhibitors (e.g., aspirin, dipyridamole, and sulfinpyrazone) do not appear to have an effect on restenosis. Agents, however, that interfere with platelet deposition at the PTCA site and that modify the effect of platelet-derived growth factor and medial cell proliferation show promise for control of restenosis.\r"

High-resolution, quantitative ST segment monitoring during PTCA procedures allows characterization of the first moments of coronary occlusion, as well as the effect of interventions intended to reduce ischemia during occlusion. Data from more than 1,000 coronary occlusions are reviewed in this presentation. Intracoronary interventions during acute myocardial infarction (MI) and elective PTCA create a potentially unstable coronary nidus through their therapeutic effect. Angiographic evidence of the anatomic appearance remains the \"gold standard\" for real-time assessment of success although angiography has limited ability to identify the 2-4% of patients who suffer morbidity or mortality in the coronary care unit (CCU) after an apparently successful intervention. Standard CCU monitoring of patient symptoms and rhythms underestimates transient ischemic activity in 87% of patients who experience ischemia after interventions. The capabilities of real-time multilead ST segment monitoring are reviewed from 8,331 hours of monitoring in 338 patients after intracoronary interventions. The documentation of persistent ischemia after angiographically successful PTCA and the clinical potential of qualitative patient-specific, coronary site-specific, precordial \"fingerprinting\" for identification of high-risk patients before or in the absence of anginal symptoms are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Results of multiple studies have amply verified the benefit of urgent coronary revascularization for patients who have acute myocardial infarction (MI). Currently, intravenous thrombolytic therapy is the treatment of choice for many patients, especially those 75 years old or younger who present within 6 hours of symptom onset and who are without contraindications to thrombolytic therapy. Some patients treated within 6-24 hours of symptom onset may also benefit, but this remains unproven. The thrombolytic agents currently in use or being extensively evaluated include streptokinase, urokinase, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex (APSAC or anistreplase), and single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (scu-PA). The agent t-PA has the potential advantage of being clot selective and, thereby, relatively fibrinogen sparing, and its efficacy in terms of restoration of vessel patency is less dependent on the time of administration as compared with that of streptokinase and urokinase. It is not yet known whether this will translate into improved patient survival as compared with that achieved by the less-expensive agents streptokinase and APSAC. Treatment regimens of combination thrombolytic agents have been developed, but the optimal combinations have not yet been determined. Patients who are in cardiogenic shock and those in whom thrombolytic therapy is contraindicated can probably benefit from angioplasty or bypass surgery. Results of several studies have suggested that immediate angioplasty after successful thrombolysis is not beneficial; however, the potential benefit of angioplasty or bypass surgery for failed thrombolytic therapy is yet to be evaluated. Although many advances have been made, further research is clearly needed in the area of reperfusion.\r"

Myocyte damage can be reversible or irreversible and is dependent on the duration of ischemia. Endothelial cell injury lags behind myocyte injury. Reperfusion of ischemic myocardium can result in the acceleration of endothelial injury with resultant conversion of surrounding reversibly injured myocytes to irreversible damage; this has been termed the \"no-reflow\" phenomenon. This process can be accelerated by the presence of neutrophils. Agents such as perfluorochemicals and adenosine, which attenuate endothelial injury and inhibit neutrophil infiltration, also reduce infarct size in animal models. Infarct size reduction with perfluorochemical was observed with both intracoronary and intravenous infusion. Infarct healing was not adversely affected except for the persistence of perfluorochemical-laden macrophages. These studies suggest that perfluorochemicals and adenosine might be beneficial adjuvants to thrombolytic therapy in the reduction of reperfusion injury.\r"

  ".W": "Recent advances in thrombolytic therapy and balloon angioplasty have resulted in reperfusion therapy as a logical maneuver in the treatment of evolving myocardial infarction. The introduction of electrolytes, oxygen, and cellular elements, especially neutrophils, however, into the previously ischemic bed may initiate cellular and biochemical changes that limit the amount of potentially salvageable myocardium (reperfusion injury). Experimental studies have demonstrated that microvascular damage may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this phenomenon. Reperfusion enhances the infiltration of activated neutrophils into the ischemic bed, and neutrophil plugging of capillary lumens in association with extensive disruption of endothelial cells results in a progressive decrease in blood flow (the \"no-reflow\" phenomenon). Activated neutrophils may potentiate the inflammatory response, produce cellular damage, and reduce capillary blood flow by producing chemoattractants, proteolytic enzymes and reactive oxygen species, and arachidonate products, respectively. Therapeutic strategies that modify the interaction between neutrophils and endothelium have shown promising results in experimental preparations for reperfusion. The administration of both perfluorochemical (Fluosol, Alpha Therapeutic Corp., Los Angeles, California) and adenosine after reperfusion has resulted in enhanced myocardial salvage after 90 minutes of ischemia in the canine model. Histological studies have shown reduced neutrophil infiltration and relative preservation of endothelial cells without neutrophil plugging with both agents. Both adenosine and perfluorochemical have been shown to reduce neutrophil adherence and cytotoxicity to endothelial cell cultures. These findings suggest that suppression of neutrophil activation, especially chemotaxis, might be an ideal step to reduce this component from the inflammatory response in the ischemic myocardium after reperfusion. Clinical trials seem warranted to determine the role of reperfusion injury in limiting myocardial salvage in patients undergoing reperfusion within the first few hours of a thrombotic event.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in relieving symptoms of coronary artery disease is well established, and the technique has become widely used in patients with multivessel as well as single-vessel disease. The technique has only recently been widely applied, and long-term outcome is, therefore, not well defined. Studies of patients who underwent the procedure early in its development were primarily of patients with single-vessel disease. These studies demonstrated low mortality (1%/yr) and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) rates (1-3%/yr), with a majority of patients (85-90%) clinically improved after 5 years. More recent studies of patients with multivessel disease demonstrate higher mortality (2-4%/yr) and a similar incidence of nonfatal MI (2-3%/yr), with improvement in symptoms in the majority (70-80%). The degree of revascularization can be an important factor in symptomatic improvement as well as in the need for subsequent revascularization. A favorable outcome is most likely when all lesions attempted with PTCA are reduced by at least 20% and no significant residual lesions remain in any proximal vessels. The efficacy of PTCA as compared with bypass surgery in patients with multivessel disease is uncertain. The results of several large ongoing and planned clinical trials should provide the information necessary to more fully understand the use of angioplasty in this setting. Although no study has directly compared PTCA with coronary artery bypass surgery, nonrandomized comparisons indicate similar long-term outcomes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Based on Bayes' theorem, the nomogram makes use of the sensitivity and specificity of methacholine challenge to calculate the post-test probability of asthma once the physician makes a determination of the pretest probability, that is, the likelihood of asthma before the test results are considered. A family of curves is presented to cover several levels of cumulative breath units at which the test could become positive, and a single curve is presented for a negative test after 224 cumulative breath units. Separate curves are presented for smokers and nonsmokers. The estimate of pretest probability is most crucial in negative tests where likelihood of asthma is considered high, and in positive tests in patients in whom asthma is considered unlikely. Although these curves will not apply precisely to a different data base, the concept of the relationship between pretest and post-test probability helps in the interpretation of the test results and stresses the importance of using all available information in making a diagnosis.\r"

We observed no significant increase in the sIgA obtained from eight BALs obtained from cancerous lungs as compared with BALs taken from these same patients' contralateral cancer-free lungs. We also saw no significant difference in BAL (sIgA) obtained from patients eventually found to have cancer (N = 8) as compared with those found to have noncancer diagnoses (N = 6). In light of these findings, we think it unlikely that measurement of sIgA will be clinically useful in the diagnosis of pulmonary malignant neoplasms.\r"

These issues are reviewed and emphasis is placed on the need for further research into the apparent biologic areas of overlap between psychiatric disorders and asthma. It is hypothesized that a \"lactate challenge test\" may be used in asthmatics to see if they are predisposed to panic and suggested that a therapeutic trial of tricyclic antidepressants in anxious asthmatics is indicated. Research into the psychobiologic aspects of asthma is likely to clarify the role of \"emotional\" factors in asthma and may well have significant implications for the management of this disorder.\r"

Serum concentration of these markers was determined in 68 patients with lung cancer (50 with NSCLC and 18 with SCLC, in 68 patients with benign lung disease and 75 normal control subjects. Ferritin proved to be the most useful in diagnosing both NSCLC and SCLC, while NSE was found to be of some help in diagnosing SCLC only. The multiple marker panel proved to be more sensitive and specific than any single marker in discriminating lung cancer from normal control tissue, but it was of limited value in discriminating malignant from benign lung disease. The results of the present study would suggest that the panel of investigated tumor markers is not of great help for the early diagnosis of lung cancer.\r"

Previously reported cases of patients who had symptomatic or roentgenographic acute leukemic lung diseases invariably presented with diffuse pulmonary infiltrates. We describe three patients with leukemic involvement of the lung who presented with cough, fever, and localized roentgenographic infiltrates suggestive of bacterial pneumonia. In each case, the diagnosis was made by transbronchial biopsy specimen and confirmed by complete response to chemotherapy. In common with the other reported cases, all of our patients had peripheral blast counts above 40 percent (greater than 6,000 blasts per ml3) at the time the pulmonary diagnosis was made. Leukemic invasion of the lung should be considered in patients with acute leukemia who develop lung infiltrates--whether diffuse or focal--in association with a high peripheral blast count.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of long-term tracheostomy intermittent positive pressure ventilation (TIPPV) with deflated cuffs or cuffless tracheostomy tubes for patients with neuromuscular ventilatory failure. One hundred four unweanable ventilator-dependent patients with neuromuscular ventilatory insufficiency were referred for pulmonary rehabilitation. Ninety-one of the 104 patients converted from TIPPV with an inflated cuff to either a deflated cuff (28 patients) or no cuff (63 patients). Arterial blood gas (ABG) and routine daytime monitoring of end-tidal PCo2 were performed on all patients during this transition. In addition, periodic daytime and continuous overnight oximetry were performed on 21 of these patients receiving TIPPV with deflated cuffs or cuffless tubes. Thirteen of the 21 patients also had continuous overnight end-tidal PCo2 monitoring. Despite a mean vital capacity of 17 +/- 12.3 percent and the fact that 16 of the 21 patients could tolerate only 60 minutes or less of autonomous respiration (free time), ABG, daytime SaO2 and end-tidal PCo2 were within normal limits for all 21 patients and mean overnight SaO2 was 94 percent or greater for all except one patient who used a cuffless tracheostomy tube. Six patients experienced very transient desaturations below 90 percent but no one had a maximum end-tidal PCo2 greater than 47 mm Hg. Patients with adequate pulmonary compliance and sufficient oropharyngeal muscle strength for functional swallowing and articulation are candidates for conversion to TIPPV with deflated cuffs or cuffless tracheostomy tubes despite little or no autonomous respiration.\r"

Familiarity with both basic and more technical medical management techniques may lessen morbidity and improve survival. Prompt recognition of BPFs and appropriate placement of a chest tube with an adequate suction device are crucial to prevent potential tension pneumothorax and to drain an infected pleural space. The chest tube may be used therapeutically to decrease BPF air leak and to promote fistula repair. Appropriate conventional ventilator manipulations aimed at decreasing fistula air leak and maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation may fail and necessitate a trial of HFV. Definitive therapy by the bronchoscopic application of a sealing agent to occlude the fistula site can be used, particularly in the poor surgical candidate.\r"

The hematocrit decreased in all patients, from a mean of 45.6 +/- 1.2 percent to 43.0 +/- 1.4 percent, with a parallel decrease in the red blood cell count from 4.777 +/- 0.168 millions/cu mm to 4.577 +/- 0.174 millions/cu mm (p less than 0.0005, one-tailed, in both cases). These results suggest that nasal CPAP treatment causes a hemodilution in patients with OSA, and are compatible with the hypothesis of an atrial natriuretic peptide-induced fluid shift from the intravascular to the extravascular volume in untreated patients with OSA. The reversal of these changes with CPAP treatment could explain the simultaneous decrease in sodium and urine excretion and the reduction of peripheral edema.\r"

This unusual case is remarkable in several respects: surgical precautions, originally taken to secure the pulse generator against migration, proved ineffective; the displaced lead featured an active fixation \"screw-in\" electrode; and the reported dislodgement occurred not in the early postimplant stage, but fully three months later. It can be concluded that even with advanced lead technology and operative precaution, electrode dislodgement cannot be absolutely prevented. Awareness of this phenomenon, especially by pacemaker follow-up care personnel, could lessen its occurrence.\r"

In addition, loss of the descending wakefulness influence leads to loss of motor compensation that results in a rise in upper airway resistance, obstructive sleep apnea or hypoventilation in patients with kyphoskoliosis or thoracic neuromuscular disorders. REM sleep poses different problems for the respiratory control system owing to muscular atomia and suppression of chemical feedback. These changes are associated with respiratory deterioration in patients with compromised diaphragmatic function, eg, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\r"

  ".W": "In most circumstances in health, efficient alveolar ventilation and alveolar-to-arterial exchange of O2 and CO2 are among the strongest of links in the gas-transport chain during maximal exercise. Indeed, in most instances, the metabolic cost of ventilation represents the only significant contribution of the pulmonary system to the limitation of O2 transport of locomotor muscles and thus to the limitation of maximum performance. Of the \"weaknesses\" inherent in the healthy pulmonary system response to exercise, the most serious one may well be its absence of structural adaptability to physical training or to the trained state. Thus, the lung's diffusion capacity and pulmonary capillary blood volume remain unaltered in the highly trained human or horse, while maximum pulmonary blood flow rises linearly with the enhanced max VO2. Similarly, ventilatory requirement rises markedly, with no alteration in the capability of the airways to produce higher flow rates or of the lung parenchyma to stretch to higher tidal volumes, and little or no change in the pressure-generating capability of inspiratory muscles. The case of the elderly athlete who remains capable of achieving high maximum pulmonary blood flows and ventilatory requirements and whose lung undergoes a normal aging process underscores the importance of deficits (from \"normal\") on the capacity end of this continuum of cost versus capacity in the pulmonary system. The asthmatic athlete may represent another such example of limited flow-generating capacity; and the healthy, young, highly fit athlete who shows marked reductions in SaO2 and in max VO2 at even moderately high altitudes demonstrates that, in many situations, precious little room can be added to the demand side or removed from the capacity side before signs of failure can be seen.\r"

Transepithelial fluxes of both proteins were measured at four stages after infection: early, peak, late, and recovery, on segments of ileum and Peyer's patches mounted in Ussing chambers. During this period of observation, absorption of antigenic beta-lactoglobulin and intact horseradish peroxidase decreased significantly in the ileum and Peyer's patches of age-matched controls. No significant age-related decrease was observed in the controls for the transport of these proteins in degraded form. RDEC-1 infection caused, first, a rise in degraded protein fluxes across Peyer's patches only, during the early phase of the disease. Second, during the peak phase of infection, absorption of antigenic beta-lactoglobulin by the ileum rose to 74.0 ng/hr/cm2 (90% confidence interval: 63.1, 86.8) vs 15.8 (5.8, 42.8) in the controls (P = 0.07), and absorption of intact horseradish peroxidase rose to 21.8 (16.5, 26.7) ng/hr/cm2 vs 4.4 (0.7, 26.6) in control ileum, (P = 0.09). These rises, which were similar in Peyer's patches, delayed the physiologic decrease in protein absorption that occurs with age. These results indicate that increased antigen absorption is observed during bacterial diarrhea and that it might interfere with the immune responses of the host.\r"

  ".W": "The oxidation of glucose represents a major source of metabolic energy for mammalian cells. However, because the plasma membrane is impermeable to polar molecules such as glucose, the cellular uptake of this important nutrient is accomplished by membrane-associated carrier proteins that bind and transfer it across the lipid bilayer. Two classes of glucose carriers have been described in mammalian cells: the Na(+)-glucose cotransporter and the facilitative glucose transporter. The Na(+)-glucose cotransporter transports glucose against its concentration gradient by coupling its uptake with the uptake of Na+ that is being transported down its concentration gradient. Facilitative glucose carriers accelerate the transport of glucose down its concentration gradient by facilitative diffusion, a form of passive transport. cDNAs have been isolated from human tissues encoding a Na(+)-glucose-cotransporter protein and five functional facilitative glucose-transporter isoforms. The Na(+)-glucose cotransporter is expressed by absorptive epithelial cells of the small intestine and is involved in the dietary uptake of glucose. The same or a related protein may be responsible for the reabsorption of glucose by the kidney. Facilitative glucose carriers are expressed by most if not all cells. The facilitative glucose-transporter isoforms have distinct tissue distributions and biochemical properties and contribute to the precise disposal of glucose under varying physiological conditions. The GLUT1 (erythrocyte) and GLUT3 (brain) facilitative glucose-transporter isoforms may be responsible for basal or constitutive glucose uptake. The GLUT2 (liver) isoform mediates the bidirectional transport of glucose by the hepatocyte and is responsible, at least in part, for the movement of glucose out of absorptive epithelial cells into the circulation in the small intestine and kidney. This isoform may also comprise part of the glucose-sensing mechanism of the insulin-producing beta-cell. The subcellular localization of the GLUT4 (muscle/fat) isoform changes in response to insulin, and this isoform is responsible for most of the insulin-stimulated uptake of glucose that occurs in muscle and adipose tissue. The GLUT5 (small intestine) facilitative glucose-transporter isoform is expressed at highest levels in the small intestine and may be involved in the transcellular transport of glucose by absorptive epithelial cells. The exon-intron organizations of the human GLUT1, GLUT2, and GLUT4 genes have been determined. In addition, the chromosomal locations of the genes encoding the Na(+)-dependent and facilitative glucose carriers have been determined. Restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms have also been identified at several of these loci.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

An important outcome of these studies was the discovery that additional isoforms of this transporter were expressed in a tissue-specific manner; these comprise a family of structurally and functionally related molecules. Their tissue distribution, differences in kinetic properties, and differential regulation by ambient glucose and insulin levels suggest that they play specific roles in the control of glucose homeostasis. Herein, we will discuss the structure of three members of the GT family: erythroid/brain GT, liver GT, and adipose cell/muscle GT. In the light of their tissue-specific expression, kinetic parameters, and susceptibility to insulin action, we discuss their possible specific functions.\r"

  ".W": "Glucose transport in mammals is mediated by a multigene family whose expression can be highly tissue specific. All cells express at least one transporter isoform in a constitutive fashion, because a certain level of glucose uptake is an absolute necessity, regardless of influences by various regulatory factors. The level of the constitutive transporter, usually the erythroid glucose-transporter isoform, can be regulated by environmental factors, e.g., nutrition and transformation. Certain cells express unique transporter isoforms, the quantitatively most important of which is the muscle-adipocyte glucose-transporter isoform that functions in response to insulin to clear most of the blood glucose after a meal. The available data suggest that the major insulin target tissues are uniquely able to produce this transporter isoform, sequester it in a unique organelle, and bring it to the cell surface in response to insulin. This insulin response is dramatically different from that seen in various fibroblastic cells, quantitatively and qualitatively, and suggests the expression in adipose tissue and muscle of a multigene program that defines the insulin-stimulated glucose transport of relevance to organismal glucose homeostasis.\r"

  ".W": "Skeletal muscle is the primary tissue responsible for insulin-dependent glucose uptake in vivo; therefore, glucose uptake by this tissue plays an important role in determining glycemia. Glucose uptake in muscle occurs by a system of facilitated diffusion involving at least two distinct glucose transporters, GLUT-1 and GLUT-4. Both bind the fungal metabolite and inhibitor of glucose transport cytochalasin B. In human skeletal muscle, both types of transporters are detected immunologically, and corresponding mRNA transcripts of both transporter forms are detected. In human skeletal muscle cells in culture, in which contamination by other tissues is ruled out, a 50,000-Mr polypeptide is photolabeled with cytochalasin B. In rat skeletal muscle, acute treatment with insulin in vivo increases glucose-transport activity and the number of specific cytochalasin B-binding sites at the plasma membrane. In mildly diabetic (streptozocin-induced) rats, the number of cytochalasin B-binding sites is decreased in total membranes, and preferentially in the plasma membrane. In response to acute insulin treatment, however, there is still recruitment of glucose transporters to the plasma membrane from an intracellular membrane store. Hence, migration of transporters does occur in this form of diabetes. In L6 muscle cells in culture, acute treatment (1 h) with insulin causes recruitment of glucose transporters to the plasma membrane, and prolonged exposure to insulin or to glucose-deprived medium causes increased expression of GLUT-1 mRNA and GLUT-1 protein. Prolonged exposure (24 h) to high glucose in the medium causes a decrease in the number of glucose transporters in the plasma membrane. Hence, in those cells the expression of the GLUT-1 glucose transporter is modulated by insulin.\r"

  ".W": "Despite significant advances in past years on the chemistry and biology of insulin and its receptor, the molecular events that couple the insulin-receptor interaction to the regulation of cellular metabolism remain uncertain. Progress in this area has been complicated by the pleiotropic nature of the actions of insulin. These most likely involve a complex network of pathways resulting in the coordination of mechanistically distinct cellular effects. Because the well-recognized mechanisms of signal transduction (i.e., cyclic nucleotides, ion channels) appear not to be central to insulin action, investigators have searched for a novel second-messenger system. A low-molecular-weight substance has been identified that mimics certain actions of insulin on metabolic enzymes. This substance has an inositol glycan structure, and is produced by the insulin-sensitive hydrolysis of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol in the plasma membrane. This hydrolysis reaction, which is catalyzed by a specific phospholipase C, also results in the production of a structurally distinct diacylglycerol that may selectively regulate one or more of the protein kinases C. The glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol precursor for the inositol glycan enzyme modulator is structurally analogous to the recently described glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol membrane protein anchor. Preliminary studies suggest that a subset of proteins anchored in this fashion may be released from cells by a similar insulin-sensitive phospholipase-catalyzed reaction. Future efforts will focus on the precise role of the metabolism of glycosyl phosphatidylinositols in insulin action.\r"

  ".W": "Defects in insulin-receptor function have been associated with insulin-resistant states such as obesity and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Several types of mutations in the insulin-receptor gene have been identified in patients with genetic syndromes of extreme insulin resistance. In some patients, insulin resistance results from a decrease in the number of insulin receptors on the cell surface. In one patient with leprechaunism (leprechaun/Minn-1), there is greater than 90% decrease in the levels of insulin-receptor mRNA. This patient is a compound heterozygote for two mutations in the insulin-receptor gene, both of which act in a cis-dominant fashion to decrease levels of mRNA transcribed from that allele. In one allele, there is a nonsense mutation at codon 897. All 22 exons of the other allele have a normal sequence, so that the mutation in this allele appears to map outside the coding sequence of the gene. Impaired insertion in the plasma membrane also causes insulin resistance. In two sisters (patients A-5 and A-8) with type A extreme insulin resistance, there is an 80-90% decrease in the number of insulin receptors expressed on the surface of their cells. Both sisters, whose parents are first cousins, are homozygous for a point mutation in which valine is substituted for phenylalanine at position 382 in the alpha-subunit of the insulin receptor. This mutation retards the posttranslational processing of the receptor and impairs the transport of receptors to the cell surface. Another patient with leprechaunism (leprechaun/Ark-1) is a compound heterozygote with two different mutant alleles of the insulin-receptor gene. In the allele derived from the father, there is a nonsense mutation at codon 672 that truncates the insulin receptor by deleting the COOH-terminal of the alpha-subunit and the entire beta-subunit. This truncated receptor, lacking a transmembrane domain, appears not to be expressed at the plasma membrane. In leprechaun/Ark-1, there is a missense mutation in the allele of the insulin-receptor gene derived from the mother. This point mutation results in substitution of glutamic acid for lysine at position 460 in the COOH-terminal half of the alpha-subunit. This mutation increases receptor affinity and impairs the ability of acid pH to dissociate insulin from the receptor within the endosome. There is a defect in recycling the receptor back to the plasma membrane associated with this defect. This results in an accelerated rate of receptor degradation and a consequent decrease in the number of receptors on the cell surface in vivo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Protein tyrosine kinase activity found in the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor provides a mechanism by which insulin binding on the outside of the cell transmits its signal across the plasma membrane into the cytosol. The autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor on tyrosyl residues activates the intrinsic tyrosine kinase of the receptor, rendering its ligand independent. Evidence suggests that phosphorylation of tyrosyl residues 1146, 1150, and 1151 in the kinase domain of the beta-subunit play a role in activation. Point mutations in the cytoplasmic portion of the beta-subunit confirm the above suggestions and indicate that additional sites are important for receptor function. We present methodology for overproducing the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor in the Baculovirus expression system. The protein, produced in insect cells and larvae, is soluble and fully active on autophosphorylation. Like the intact receptor, its autophosphorylation is intramolecular. Because greater than or equal to 10 mg of pure protein can be isolated from 10(10) insect cells infected with the recombinant Baculovirus encoding the human insulin-receptor kinase domain, sufficient enzyme is available for various studies, including physicochemical analysis. Isolation of beta-subunit defects found in the receptors of patients with various forms of diabetes mellitus also implicates the insulin-receptor kinase in insulin action. Finally, a potential model system for the genetic analysis of the insulin-insulin-receptor system with Drosophila melanogaster is noted. Conservation of the deduced amino acid sequence for both alpha- and beta-subunit sequences between humans and insects highlights the significance of this manner of signal transduction throughout nearly 1 billion years of evolution.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin regulates cell function by first binding to the insulin receptor (IR) localized on the cell surface. With the cloning of IR cDNA and the IR-gene promoter, the regulation of the IR gene during differentiation and by various hormones can be studied. Muscle is a major target tissue for insulin action. BC3H1 cells, a mouse muscle cell line in culture, are a model cell type for studying insulin action. Differentiation in these cells results in a 5- to 10-fold increase in IR binding and a 5- to 10-fold increase in IR content. Studies of IR mRNA by Northern and slot-blot analyses reveal a 10-fold increase in IR mRNA after differentiation. These studies indicate that there is a selective increase in IR-gene expression during muscle differentiation. A similar increase in IR-gene expression is observed for the IR during pancreatic acinar cell differentiation. Glucocorticoids increase IR content in several target tissues. Studies in cultured IM-9 lymphocytes indicate that glucocorticoids induce a 5-fold increase in IR mRNA levels. Studies of IR mRNA half-life indicate that glucocorticoids do not alter IR mRNA stability. When the transcription of the IR is measured by elongation assays, glucocorticoids directly stimulate IR transcription 5- to 10-fold. The effect is detectable within 30 min of glucocorticoid treatment and is maximal within 2 h. Therefore, these studies demonstrate that the IR gene is under the direct regulation of glucocorticoids. Insulin downregulates the IR in various target tissues. Prior studies indicate that this downregulation was partly because of accelerated IR degradation. Studying AR42J pancreatic acinar cells, we also found that insulin accelerates IR degradation. Moreover, in these cells, insulin decreases IR biosynthesis by approximately 50%. Studies of IR mRNA indicate there is a concomitant decrease in IR mRNA levels after insulin treatment. Thus, insulin decreases IR-gene expression. The genomic structure of the IR promoter has been elucidated. Primer extension and nuclease S1 analysis indicate that IR mRNA has multiple start sites. The promoter fragment was ligated to a promoterless \"reporter\" plasmid containing the bacterial gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). When this plasmid is transfected into cultured cells, CAT activity is detected, indicating promoter activity. Various portions of a genomic fragment were ligated to a promoter to study glucocorticoid regulation of the IR promoter. These studies indicate that IR-gene expression is regulated by differentiation and hormonal agents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Studies of two mutants are reviewed: a COOH-truncated receptor and a mutant of the ATP-binding site that is tyrosine kinase defective. The COOH-truncated receptor has normal insulin binding and normal endocytosis and undergoes autophosphorylation and activation as a kinase in vitro and in vivo. Loss of the COOH-terminal 43 amino acids has, however, impaired the ability of the receptor to signal metabolic events while augmenting its ability to signal mitogenesis. Thus, domains have been partially identified that are separately involved in metabolic and mitogenic signaling, facilitating future studies of these pathways. The kinase-defective receptor is not only biologically inactive, but has a dominant inhibitory effect on the endogenous insulin receptors in the cell. That is, transfected Rat-1 cells carrying defective human receptors still have normally active rat insulin receptors but are incapable of signaling insulin action. The fact that metabolic signaling by insulinlike growth factor I (IGF-I) is intact in these cells allows definition of separate insulin and IGF-I pathways, leading to stimulation of glucose transport. Analysis of dose responsiveness for mitogenesis implies that mitogenic signaling pathways are shared by insulin and IGF-I, however. The utility of these cell lines in defining these pathways is discussed.\r"

This conclusion leads to the hypothesis that the effect of insulin is mediated through the tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular substrates by the insulin-receptor tyrosine kinase. In this review, the experimental evidence regarding insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of proteins both in vitro and in vivo is evaluated. In a cell-free system, tubulin, microtubule-associated protein 2, tau, fodrin, calmodulin-dependent kinase, calmodulin, and lipocortins 1 and 2 were reported to be good substrates for insulin-receptor kinase. However, none were found to be tyrosine phosphorylated in an intact-cell system. In intact-cell systems, proteins of Mr 185,000 (pp185), 120,000 (pp120), 240,000 (pp240), 15,000 (pp15), 60,000 (pp60), and 62,000 (pp62) as well as several others were reported to be tyrosine phosphorylated in an insulin-dependent fashion. However, the function or functional alteration of these proteins induced by insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation is not clear. Therefore, physiologically relevant substrates for the insulin-receptor kinase have not been established, and more work is necessary to verify the phosphorylation cascade hypothesis of insulin action.\r"

  ".W": "We review the role of ion channels in regulating insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells. By controlling ion permeability, ion channels at the membrane play a major role in regulating both electrical activity and signal transduction in the beta-cell. A proximal step in the cascade of events required for stimulus-secretion coupling is the closure of ATP-sensitive K+ channels, resulting in cell depolarization. Of particular relevance is the finding that this channel is directly regulated by a metabolite of glucose, which is the primary insulin secretagogue. In addition, this channel, or a closely associated protein, contains the sulfonylurea-binding site. Another K+ channel, the Ca2(+)-activated K+ channel, may be involved in cell repolarization to create homeostasis. Voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels are activated by cell depolarization and regulate Ca2+ influx into the cell. By controlling cytosolic free-Ca2+ levels ([Ca2+]i), these channels play an important role in transducing the initial stimulus to the effector systems that modulate insulin secretion. The link between a rise in [Ca2+]i and the terminal event of exocytosis is the least-understood aspect of stimulus-secretion coupling. However, phosphorylation studies have identified substrate proteins that may correspond to those involved in smooth muscle contraction, suggesting an analogy in the processes of stimulus secretion and excitation contraction. The advent of new methodology, particularly the patch-clamp technique, has fostered a more detailed characterization of the beta-cell ion channels. Furthermore, biochemical and molecular approaches developed for the structural analysis of ion channels in other tissues can now be applied to the isolation and characterization of the beta-cell ion channels. This is of particular significance because there appear to be tissue-specific variations in the different types of ion channels. Given the importance of ion channels in cell physiology, a knowledge of the structure and properties of these channels in the beta-cell is required for understanding the abnormalities of insulin secretion that occur in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Ultimately, these studies should also provide new therapeutic approaches to the treatment of this disease.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin deficiency is a prominent feature of non-insulin-dependent (NIDDM) and insulin-dependent (IDDM) diabetes mellitus that could result from defects in the insulin gene. Cloning of this gene has permitted molecular-genetic studies including the definition of multiple-DNA-sequence polymorphisms detected with restriction endonucleases, or restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms (RFLPs), and the mapping of the insulin gene to the short arm of chromosome 11 adjacent to the insulinlike growth factor II (IGF-II) and tyrosine hydroxylase genes. The combined RFLPs for the insulin, IGF-II, and tyrosine hydroxylase genes make this a highly informative locus for genetic studies of the insulin gene in diabetes. Early studies of an RFLP consisting of variable-number tandem repeats (VNTR) of DNA near the insulin gene suggested an association of certain alleles with approximately 170 copies of the repeat unit with NIDDM. Although subsequent studies in NIDDM did not confirm this association, an association of different alleles defined by approximately 40 copies of the repeat unit in this VNTR region with IDDM has been demonstrated in multiple studies. This VNTR region and the multiple other RFLPs for this region have been used in linkage analysis to study the segregation of insulin genes in families. These studies have failed to demonstrate a major significant role for insulin-gene defects in NIDDM, maturity-onset diabetes of the young, or IDDM in American Blacks and Whites and under various models of inheritance. Several pedigrees with diabetes and defects of the insulin gene have been described, however, and a minor role for this gene in NIDDM cannot be eliminated from available studies. Similarly, the association studies of the insulin gene and IDDM suggest a minor modifying role undetectable in pedigree studies. The role of defects in or near the insulin gene in a small subset of NIDDM or in IDDM must await direct investigation of the insulin gene in diabetic individuals with the most recent methods for gene amplification and sequence analysis.\r"

When the immune IgG was incubated with purified, radioiodinated FSH receptor, the resulting complex could be immunoprecipitated by goat anti-rabbit gamma globulin. The immunoprecipitate, after dissociation of receptor from antibody, separation by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and autoradiography, showed the presence of a approximately 60 kDa protein previously identified as a component of the FSH receptor. Binding of 125I-hFSH to membrane-bound receptors was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by immune IgG (Ed50 = 90 micrograms/ml). Nonimmune serum or IgM/IgA fractions from immune serum had no effect. 125I-labeled immune IgG bound specifically to testis membranes and the binding could be inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by ovine FSH. These results suggest that the FSH-binding site and the antibody-binding site on the receptor are proximate or identical. Immune IgG mimicked the ability of FSH to stimulate basal adenylate cyclase activity and conversion of androstenedione to estradiol in cultured immature rat Sertoli cells. Stimulatory but submaximal effects of FSH were augmented by immune IgG. Rat Sertoli cells treated with IgG fractions from immune serum showed an intense fluorescent staining of plasma membrane receptor. No fluorescent staining of receptor was seen when preimmune IgG was used or in the presence of excess ovine FSH. These observations suggest that the polyclonal receptor antibody capable of recognizing FSH receptor behaved as an FSH binding competitor, but was also active as an agonist producing the biological effect of FSH in vitro. The effectiveness of antibodies against FSH receptor in stimulating estradiol synthesis suggests that the information needed for FSH signal transduction resides in the membrane receptor rather than in the hormone molecule. Such antibodies may offer a useful probe for further study of FSH receptor structure and mechanism of hormone action.\r"

In this study we show that IL1 modulates PRL secretion, assessed by reverse hemolytic plaque assay, and describe the effect of the monokine on adenylate cyclase activity and calcium fluxes in rat normal pituitary cells. In basal and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-stimulated conditions, low doses of IL1 reduced the mean plaque area, a direct index of PRL secretion without affecting the percentage of PRL-secreting cells. Similarly, low concentrations of IL1 inhibited adenylate cyclase activity in both basal and VIP-stimulated conditions, while higher concentrations restored the enzymatic activity to the control value. IL1 also caused a biphasic effect on the free intracellular calcium increase induced by maitotoxin, a calcium channel activator, being inhibitory at low and stimulatory at high concentrations. The effects of IL1 on adenylate cyclase activity and calcium fluxes were reversed by preincubation of the monokine with its polyclonal antibody, thus confirming the specificity of the effects. In conclusion, our data show that IL1 modulates PRL secretion by acting directly on pituitary cells through interaction with the adenylate cyclase-cAMP system and calcium flux.\r"

  ".W": "Naloxone-resistant binding sites for beta-endorphin have previously been observed on transformed peripheral blood mononuclear cells and on the EL4-thymoma cell line. These sites may be related to the naloxone-insensitive immunomodulatory effects of beta-endorphin. The present study was performed 1) to determine whether these sites are present on normal splenocytes and 2) to characterize them. Ficoll-hypaque-purified murine splenocytes were used in a RRA with [125I]beta-endorphin. Neither fresh intact cells obtained from viral antibody-free mice nor membrane preparations showed evidence of binding. However, splenocytes cultured in 5% fetal bovine serum for 24-96 h showed sites on intact cells or membranes (after 3 h in culture no sites were present). Intact cultured splenocytes demonstrated a saturable binding isotherm, and Scatchard analysis showed a single site (Kd = 4.1 X 10(-9) M). Competition studies showed that N-acetyl-beta-endorphin (N-Ac-beta-endorphin)-(1-31) was equipotent to beta-endorphin-(1-31). beta-Endorphin-(6-31) and beta-endorphin-(28-31) were approximately 10- and 1000-fold less potent, respectively, whereas beta-endorphin-(1-27) and naloxone were completely ineffective. Covalent cross-linking of [125I]beta-endorphin to splenocytes and resolution by gel electrophoresis showed bands at 66K and 57K which were displaced equipotently by increasing amounts of beta-endorphin and N-Ac-beta-endorphin. beta-Endorphin-(18-31) or (28-31) were less potent, and naloxone or other opioid ligands selective for receptor subtypes were ineffective. Thus, high affinity, naloxone-insensitive binding sites for beta-endorphin, which show competition characteristics distinctively different from brain opiate receptors, are inducible on normal mouse splenocytes. N-Ac-beta-endorphin, presumed to be an inactivation product of beta-endorphin because it fails to bind brain opiate receptors, may be functional at this naloxone-insensitive binding site.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have demonstrated that abolition of the naloxone-stimulated increase in plasma LH levels is characteristic of hypothalamic dysfunction in experimental uremia. This study aimed to further characterize the nature of the defect in hypothalamic opiatergic mechanisms in experimental uremia. Specifically, we have tested the hypothesis that naloxone resistance was due to either opioid receptor dysfunction or diminished opioid peptide levels. Administration of naloxone (2 mg/kg, iv) to cannulated freely mobile rats confirmed previous observations that despite marked increases in plasma LH in control rats, plasma LH levels were unaffected in uremic male rats (P = 0.001 for group x time interaction). In a second experiment, morphine (2 mg/kg) or saline diluent was given quasi-continuously as small aliquots before each blood sample during the pulse studies of castrate mature male rats that had undergone either subtotal nephrectomy or sham operation. After the administration of morphine, uremic rats exhibited a 60% reduction in mean LH levels (14.9 +/- 1.4 vs. 6.0 +/- 0.7 ng/ml) attributable to a 42% reduction in LH pulse frequency (3.6 +/- 0.4 vs. 2.1 +/- 0.5 peaks/3 h) and a 60% reduction in LH pulse amplitude (4.7 +/- 0.5 vs. 1.9 +/- 0.3 ng/ml). The preservation of sensitivity to morphine despite complete naloxone resistance raised the alternate hypothesis of depletion of endogenous opiate peptide levels in the uremic hypothalamus. This hypothesis was tested by measuring the beta-endorphin content of the medial basal hypothalamus (MBH) in a rat beta-endorphin RIA. Rat MBH beta-endorphin content was not significantly altered specifically by either uremia or castration. We conclude, therefore, that naloxone resistance of plasma LH in experimental uremia is not due to either defects in opioid receptor function or reduced hypothalamic beta-endorphin content. Instead, we suggest that uremia may diminish the release of endogenous opioid peptides that interact with GnRH neurons from the MBH.\r"

Melatonin inhibited cAMP and 3',5'-cyclic GMP accumulation in neonatal rat anterior pituitary stimulated with LHRH. Maximal inhibitory effect was reached within 25 min and persisted for at least 20 min. Inhibition of cAMP accumulation is specific for melatonin because its analogs N-acetylserotonin and 5-methoxytryptamine are 1000 times less potent. Melatonin effect is age- and time-dependent. Marked inhibition was observed in 5-, 10-, and 14-day-old rats but not in 29-day-old ones. Melatonin was significantly more potent when applied at the end of the light period as compared with the first half of the day. Melatonin's effects on cAMP correlate with its effect on reproductive functions and on LH release. Cyclic nucleotides may thus serve as second messengers transducing the effect of melatonin on cellular level.\r"

  ".W": "Cultured human fetal hepatic explants were used to study the role of hexose uptake in regulating production of the GH-independent insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP-1). Cytochalasin B (100 microM), but not cytochalasin E, inhibited 2-deoxyglucose uptake by fetal liver explants and increased production of IGFBP-1 2-fold. Two agents which stimulate cyclic nucleotide-dependent pathways, cholera toxin and theophylline, also inhibited 2-deoxyglucose uptake in this system and both stimulated IGFBP-1 production. When added to a maximally inhibiting concentration of cytochalasin B (250 microM), hexose uptake was not further inhibited by theophylline (5 mM) or cholera toxin (10 micrograms/ml), suggesting that the three substances interact with the same hexose transport mechanism. However, the stimulatory effect of theophylline (5 mM) or cholera toxin (10 micrograms/ml) on IGFBP-1 production was additive to the effect of 250 microM cytochalasin B, suggesting that another pathway, possibly involving cyclic nucleotide accumulation, could further stimulate IGFBP-1 above the effect of blocking glucose transport. Insulin (300 nM) had no effect on hexose uptake by human fetal liver explants but inhibited IGFBP-1 production, both basally and when stimulated by cytochalasin B (100 microM) or cholera toxin (1 microgram/ml). These results are consistent with the conclusion that a cyclic nucleotide-dependent pathway, activated by blocking hexose transport and inhibited by insulin, is involved in the regulation of IGFBP-1 synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "Biochemical and morphological studies compared the ATP requirements for and the internalization routes of alpha 2-macroglobulin and insulin in H35 hepatoma cells. Cellular ATP concentrations were decreased more than 94% by 1 mM 2,4-dinitrophenol or 10 mM sodium azide, potassium cyanide, or oligomycin. ATP depletion decreased total cell-associated alpha 2-macroglobulin 70-90% by inhibiting binding 67-77% and receptor-mediated internalization 90-96%. Under the same conditions, insulin binding was decreased less than 10%, and endocytosis and intracellular accumulation were not affected. Quantitative electron microscopic analysis of the distribution of occupied receptors on the surface of control and treated cells was performed using colloidal gold-labeled alpha 2-macroglobulin or insulin. alpha 2-Macroglobulin concentrated in and was internalized almost exclusively by coated pits. Insulin was rarely associated with coated pits, but was found in and internalized by noncoated invaginations. ATP depletion did not affect receptor mobility or ligand-induced aggregation of either receptor. There was an increase in the amount of alpha 2-macroglobulin found in coated pit-like structures. The coat underlying pits in ATP-depleted cells was poorly defined and may account for the inability of coated pits to form and/or internalize. These results showed that receptor-mediated internalization via coated pits was ATP dependent, whereas internalization via pinocytotic invaginations was energy independent, which explained the difference in the ATP dependency of uptake for the two ligands. These observations suggested that autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor may not be involved in either the aggregation or internalization of the insulin-receptor complex, since ATP depletion did not affect either process. This study provided evidence that specialized mechanisms exist for the internalization of insulin which may be related to some of its intracellular effects.\r"

This occurred in the presence or absence of extracellular matrix or peritubular cells in the system. In the complete two-chambered assembly, addition of androgens simultaneously resulted in a small but significant increase in the integrity of the Sertoli cell barrier separating the two chambers, as indicated by slower rates of equilibration of [3H]methoxyinulin between inner and outer chambers. These responses to steroids appeared to be androgen specific, since other steroids examined (17 beta-estradiol, progesterone, and dexamethasone) had no detectable effects on levels of plasminogen activator activities or on barrier function. We confirmed that when FSH or (Bu)2cAMP is added to stimulate plasminogen activator secretion by Sertoli cells, the integrity of the barrier is decreased, provided no antiproteases are present in the serum-free medium. Simultaneous addition of androgens inhibited these effects of (Bu)2cAMP on Sertoli cells, but did not influence the responses of Sertoli cells to FSH. We compare actions of androgens on Sertoli cells in culture under various conditions and discuss the possible physiological significance of the inhibition of plasminogen activator activity.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin-like growth factors I and II (IGF-I and IGF-II) are thought to primarily regulate the growth and development of a number of tissues. However, it has recently been observed that when IGF-I is infused into man and animals, plasma insulin levels fall, raising the possibility that IGF-I may also be an inhibitor of insulin secretion. This study used the in vitro perfused rat pancreas and recombinant human IGF-I and IGF-II to determine if either of these peptides affected insulin and/or glucagon secretion from normal rats. IGF-I given with 7.8 mM glucose suppressed insulin secretion by as much as 65%, with the half-maximal effect occurring at less than 10 ng/ml. Glucose-induced insulin secretion (7.8 mM glucose) and arginine-induced insulin secretion (10 mM arginine plus 7.8 mM glucose) were inhibited equally (40%) by 2 ng/ml IGF-I. Insulin secretion returned to normal within minutes of stopping IGF-I. IGF-II (200 ng/ml) also suppressed insulin release, but the effect was less pronounced than for IGF-I and was present at 16.7 mM glucose, but not at 7.8 mM glucose. In contrast to the effects on insulin release, neither peptide altered glucagon secretion. We conclude from these results that 1) IGF-I at physiological concentrations is a potent inhibitor of both glucose- and arginine-induced insulin secretion; 2) the magnitude of the inhibition depends on the background glucose concentration; and 3) the inhibition fully reverses when IGF-I is stopped. These results support an in vivo effect of IGF-I to modulate insulin output.\r"

  ".W": "Angiotensin-II, the most important biologically active product of the renin-angiotensin system, has been reported to play a role in neovascularization, and prorenin has been found in the vitreous of human eyes, particularly in those affected by proliferative diabetic retinopathy, a disease characterized by neovascularization. The prorenin level in these eyes was, relative to that of plasma albumin, higher than in eyes without neovascularization. These findings suggested that an intraocular renin-angiotensin system exists, which might be involved in the development of retinal neovascularization in diabetes mellitus. In this study angiotensin-I-generating activity was measured in bovine aqueous humor and vitreous and in extracts of bovine retina, pigment epithelium-choroid, and anterior uveal tract before and after subjecting these extracts to procedures known to convert prorenin to renin. The measurements were made by incubation at 37 C with plasma from nephrectomized rats at pH ranging from 5.0-8.5. True renin in the ocular samples could be separated from nonrenin acid protease by alpha-casein-Sepharose affinity column chromatography at pH 3.5; true renin did not bind to the column, whereas acid protease did. True renin was further identified by its relatively high pH optimum (6.5-7.0) for angiotensin-I generation, its complete inhibition with specific renin antiserum, and its high affinity for specific renin inhibitors. More than 75% of angiotensin-I-generating activity of the ocular samples consisted of true renin. Approximately 90% or more of total renin (renin plus prorenin) in aqueous humor, vitreous, and ocular tissue could not be explained by trapped plasma. Total renin in aqueous humor and renin in vitreous were near the detection limit of the assay of angiotensin-I-generating activity. In vitreous prorenin comprised 99% of the total renin, in retina 81%, and in pigment epithelium-choroid and anterior uveal tract less than 50%. Prorenin in ocular fluids showed a concentration gradient, posterior vitreous greater than anterior vitreous greater than aqueous humor, suggesting that the main source of extracellular prorenin was in the posterior eye. These data support the contention of local renin and/or prorenin synthesis in the eye and are in accordance with the observations in other tissues that extrarenal synthesis of renin is often associated with the release of mainly, or exclusively, prorenin into extracellular fluid.\r"

We now report a technique for examining quantitative changes in hormone secretion in individual parathyroid cells. We have used a reverse hemolytic plaque assay to measure cumulative PTH release in single isolated cells. Bovine parathyroid cells were dispersed with trypsin and mixed with staphylococcal protein-A-linked ovine erythrocytes. Cells were plated in a monolayer in the presence of PTH antiserum. After stimulation by an agonist, complement was added to the cells. Lysis of ovine erythrocytes formed a plaque around each individual cell that releases PTH. Results indicate that inhibition of PTH release by calcium was not affected by trypsinization. Plaque formation was dependent on all reagents; serial dilution of antiserum reduces plaque formation. Cells had a markedly uniform secretory response to calcium. We compared PTH release in individual cells measured by the reverse hemolytic plaque assay with hormone release in a parathyroid cell population measured by RIA. There was an inverse relationship between extracellular calcium concentrations and plaque area. Individual cells were more sensitive to calcium (ED50 = 0.4 mM Ca2+) than cell populations (ED50 = 0.8 mM Ca2+). We demonstrate that PTH release can be quantitated in single viable parathyroid cells.\r"

The effects of several hemopoietic regulatory proteins on the generation of these cells were examined in this study. Interleukin-3, granulocyte-macrophage-stimulating factor (GMCSF), and macrophage-stimulating factor strongly inhibited generation of the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-containing multinucleated cells with approximate EC50 values of 3, 6, and 3 colony-forming units/ml, respectively. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor, interleukin-6, and leukemia inhibitory factor had no effect on the generation of these cells. In addition, we observed that the number of these cells was reduced when the bone marrow was plated at high cell density, and that this inhibitory effect was reversed by the addition of neutralizing antibodies directed against GMCSF. These findings suggest that GMCSF and other hemopoietic factors secreted by cells in the bone marrow regulate development of the osteoclast-like cells, possibly by diverting common precursor cells to alternate pathways.\r"

  ".W": "In this study we have examined the role of glucagon and somatostatin in regulating glucose-induced desensitization of insulin secretion from rat islets. Measured in batch incubations with medium routinely used to induce three phases of insulin secretion, secreted glucagon levels fell off over 24 h to 20% of peak secretion levels. Although more responsive to various secretagogues, somatostatin secretion also declined to the same degree. Thus, the A- and D-cells desensitize to chronic stimulation as does the B cell. In other experiments, added glucagon (10(-6) M) enhanced glucose (11 X 10(-3) M)-stimulated insulin secretion 34% in the first 3 h; however, islets became insensitive to continuous glucagon by 4 h. The exogenous glucagon did not prevent or delay glucose-induced desensitization of insulin secretion. When glucagon was administered as acute 1-h tests over continuous glucose administration, the degree of B-cell response did not differ in the 1st, 3rd, or 6th hours and appeared to increase in the 21st hour. When islets were perifused continuously with glucose (22 X 10(-3) M) plus 3 X 10(-7) M somatostatin, glucose-induced insulin secretion was suppressed 50% in the first 3 h, but this inhibitory effect disappeared after 6 h. Desensitization was slightly delayed, but not prevented. When somatostatin was administered as acute 1-h tests over continuous glucose perifusion, the B-cell response was relatively constant in the 3rd, 6th, and 21st hours. Results show that 1) islet release of glucagon and somatostatin desensitizes during constant stimulation; and 2) islet release of insulin desensitizes to chronic potentiation or inhibition, respectively, by these hormones. Furthermore, 3) changing B-cell sensitivity to either glucagon or somatostatin cannot account for observed desensitization of insulin secretion with chronic glucose exposure.\r"

Single daily sc injections of MK-801 (0.1-0.2 mg/kg BW), a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, given to prepubertal rats significantly delayed but did not prevent the timing of puberty, as determined by the age at vaginal opening and first ovulation. Infusion of MK-801 (5 micrograms/h) via osmotic minipumps for 4 days inhibited the postovariectomy rise of LH secretion in prepubertal rats. Both MK-801 (0.2 mg/kg BW, sc) and AP-5 (4 x 30 mg, iv), a competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, blocked the estradiol-induced LH surge in prepubertal ovariectomized rats. These results demonstrate that blockade of NMDA receptors can prevent the development of enhanced LH secretion in female rats undergoing sexual maturation. Moreover, they support the view that activation of NMDA receptors significantly contributes to the physiological initiation of the pubertal process.\r"

Two selective agonists of oxytocin (OT) or V1 vasopressin (VP) receptors produced, respectively, a 6- and 2-fold increase of IR-ET-1 release from endometrial cells. These effects were completely reversed by the addition of two specific antagonists of OT and V1 VP receptors.

It is by no means all-inclusive (the number of cases precludes an exhaustive compendium) but does include those cases that, in the authors' opinion, are most representative of the contemporary attitude of the courts. The discussion has been confined primarily to the legal aspects of involuntary sterilization. We have omitted any substantial discussion of the moral and ethical aspects of this complex topic but acknowledge the intimate role these issues may play in any decision to undertake involuntary sterilization. As outlined, the presence or absence of statutory guidelines mandates in part the legal channels to be pursued. In the presence of statutes for involuntary sterilization, strict adherence to the specified requirements provides the optimal means of protecting the legal interests of all involved parties. In the absence of statutory guidelines, extreme caution must be exercised. In these circumstances, a validly executed court order observing procedural due process should provide optimal protection of patient and physician interests. The decisions of New Jersey and Alaska courts represent one potential method of securing a consent by use of the parens patriae doctrine. Recent notable efforts at a state level to dispense with lengthy hearings and implement committee review have been encouraging and await further trials to determine their ultimate role in authorizing sterilization of mental incompetents. Given the current legal climate and available avenues, parental substituted consent without adequate hearing and due process should not be considered a fulfillment of legal responsibilities.\r"

To explore further this notion, we compared the behavioral and endocrine responses to a mental stressor between women with hyperandrogenism (n = 13) and normals (n = 11). The standardized psychological stimulus produced higher levels of anxiety in the hyperandrogenic group than in controls. The endocrine (cortisol, prolactin, growth hormone, beta-endorphin) responses poststressor were definitely dissociated. Both groups showed a comparable anticipatory stress cortisol-secretion response. The cortisol release was greater following the mental stressor in the hyperandrogenic group than in the normals. Thus, hyperandrogenic women appear to have an abnormally affected pituitary-adrenal activation, which may play a role in the pituitary-ovarian disruption characteristic of the ovarian androgenic syndrome.\r"

We therefore tested the respective advantages of luteal support using human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG, 1,500 IU three times) and progesterone (P, micronized, oral administration, 400 mg/d) after 171 embryo transfers (ET) in which the cycle was stimulated with the LH-RH-a triptoreline. The type of luteal phase support was randomly selected except when the estradiol level exceeded 2,700 pg/mL. The clinical pregnancy rate and the ongoing pregnancy rate were significantly higher using hCG (after the transfer of 3 embryos, 45% and 43% with hCG versus 23% and 17% with P). The same results were noted for the embryo implantation rate per ET (19% of embryos are viable after 6 months of pregnancy after hCG versus 7.5% after P). Adequate luteal support, therefore, significantly improves the results of IVF when LH-RH-a are used. The poor results obtained with P in this study might be related to its poor bioavailability after oral administration.\r"

Forty-one (23%) had more than 10(6) WBC/mL semen (leukocytospermia). Semen parameters in patients with less than 10(6) WBC/mL were similar to those of 15 fertile donors. In contrast, the leukocytospermic group had significant reductions in total sperm number, percent sperm motility, sperm velocity, motility index, and total number of motile sperm. Patients with high concentrations of monocytes/macrophages (greater than 5 X 10(5)/mL; n = 27) had significantly reduced ejaculate volume; patients with high numbers of T lymphocytes (greater than 10(5)/mL; n = 19) had a significant reduction in sperm velocity; and patients with high levels of granulocyte elastase in semen (greater than 1,000 ng/mL; n = 26) had significant reductions in ejaculate volume, total sperm number, and total motile sperm number. There was no correlation between the presence of antisperm antibodies and leukocytospermia. Our data suggest that leukocytospermia may occur frequently in male infertility patients and show that elevated levels of WBC in semen are associated with poor semen quality. This provides further rationale for white blood cell testing in semen of male infertility patients, since antibiotic or anti-inflammatory therapy may be helpful in appropriately selected cases.\r"

In 78 women between 40 and 45 years, an intrauterine pregnancy rate of 45% and an ectopic pregnancy rate of 4% was reported. Whereas 26% of first pregnancies ended in a spontaneous abortion, the live birth rate (all healthy children) still amounted to 44%.

Whether ascribable to diabetes mellitus, to the administration of glucocorticoids, or to the infusion of hyperalimentation fluids, hyperglycemia may impair several mechanisms of humoral host defense, including such varied neutrophil functions as adhesion, chemotaxis, and phagocytosis. In addition, binding of glucose to the biochemically active site of the third component of complement C3 inhibits the attachment of this protein to the microbial surface and thereby impairs opsonization. Last, several pathogens frequently encountered in hyperglycemic patients possess unique mechanisms of virulence that flourish in the hyperglycemic environment. Most notable in this regard is the yeast Candida albicans, which expresses a glucose-inducible protein that is structurally and functionally homologous to a complement receptor on mammalian phagocytes. This protein promotes adhesion in the yeast and subverts phagocytosis by the host. Thus, hyperglycemia serves as a central mechanism in the predisposition of hyperglycemic patients to infection.\r"

We examined body mass index (BMI), ratio of subscapular-to-triceps skin fold (centrality index), and fasting glucose and insulin concentrations as predictors of decompensation to type II diabetes in Mexican Americans, a population at high risk for this disorder. Twenty-eight of 474 initially nondiabetic Mexican Americans developed type II diabetes after 8 yr of follow-up. Converters to diabetes were older and had higher BMIs, centrality indices, and fasting glucose and insulin concentrations than nonconverters. Subjects in the highest quartile of the insulin distribution had 6.6 times the risk of developing type II diabetes as subjects in the remaining three quartiles combined (95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.14-13.7). In multivariate analysis, fasting glucose (odds ratio [OR] = 5.80, 95% CI = 2.57-13.1) and insulin (OR = 3.12, 95% CI = 1.36-7.14) remained significantly related to conversion to diabetes. However, BMI and centrality index, which were significantly related to conversion in the univariate analysis, were no longer significant in the multivariate analysis once glucose and insulin concentrations were taken into consideration, suggesting that the effect of these variables may be mediated by insulin resistance. Nearly half of the incident cases developed in a subset of the population who were simultaneously in the highest quartile of both fasting insulin and glucose concentrations (population-attributable risk 44.2%). Our results support the insulin resistance/pancreatic exhaustion theory of type II diabetes.\r"

In IDDM patients, insulin-stimulated glucose disposal was decreased at low insulinemia (steps 1-3), whereas at maximal insulinemia (step 4), insulin action was normal. In the healthy subjects, strong positive correlations were found for PCR versus steady-state glucose infusion rate (SSGIR): r = 0.71 (P less than 0.005), 0.72 (P less than 0.005), 0.72 (P less than 0.005), and 0.78 (P less than 0.001) for steps 1-4, respectively. In contrast, in the IDDM patients, no relationship was observed: r = 0.01, -0.03, 0.06, and 0.01 (NS) for steps 1-4, respectively. In univariate analyses of PCR, no differences were found between patient subgroups with values for percentage of tracer binding below or above 5% or insulin-antibody-binding capacities and equilibrium constants below or above the median. In multiple regression models, adjusting for insulin antibodies, preceding glycemic control (HbA1 or fructosamine), and duration of IDDM, correlations for PCR versus SSGIR remained nonsignificant. In conclusion, insulin action is correlated to insulin clearance in healthy subjects, suggesting a functional relationship from an in vivo perspective. No such relationship was present in patients with IDDM, even after adjusting for insulin antibodies, preceding glycemic control, and duration of IDDM.\r"

This model prevented variations in insulin secretion induced by IGF-I and permitted evaluation of the effects of IGF-I on extrapancreatic glucagon. Steady-state moderate hyperglycemia (9.9 +/- 0.2 mM) was maintained by a subbasal intraportal infusion of insulin (1.29 +/- 0.17 pmol.kg-1.min-1). This was continued throughout the experiment, allowing evaluation of IGF-I effects on insulin clearance. Human recombinant IGF-I or insulin was given intravenously as a primed infusion for 90 min, followed by a 50-min recovery period. The dose of IGF-I was a 2.6-nmol/kg bolus plus 57.4 pmol.kg-1.min-1. The insulin dose required to induce the same plasma glucose decline as IGF-I (44 +/- 6 vs. 43 +/- 5%, NS) was 9-12 times lower (0.06-nmol/kg bolus + 6.4 +/- 0.6 pmol.kg-1.min-1). However, the mechanism of this decline differed with IGF-I and insulin; glucose production was much less suppressed (25 +/- 9 vs. 42 +/- 11%, P less than 0.001) and glucose utilization was more stimulated (68 +/- 18 vs. 38 +/- 19%, P less than 0.05) with IGF-I.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These groups of subjects consisted of six PCO-AN patients with normal glucose tolerance, six PCO-AN patients with mild non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and six weight-matched control subjects. We found that insulin binding to both erythrocytes and activated T lymphocytes was significantly lower in PCO and PCO-NIDDM patients than control subjects but did not differ between the PCO groups. Insulin binding to erythrocytes and T lymphocytes varied inversely with basal insulin. In activated T lymphocytes of PCO-NIDDM patients, PDH responsiveness to both submaximal and maximal insulin concentrations was impaired, the extent of which varied in proportion to their degree of carbohydrate intolerance. In contrast, PDH responsiveness to maximal amounts of insulin in T lymphocytes of PCO patients without NIDDM was similar to the weight-matched control subjects. These data may suggest that lesions at the level of the receptor are primarily responsible for insulin resistance in patients with PCO but that both receptor and postreceptor defects (i.e., PDH responsiveness to insulin) contribute to the insulin-resistant state of PCO patients with NIDDM.\r"

Because insulin reduces plasma amino acid concentrations, and amino acids are known to stimulate glucagon secretion, we investigated the effect of amino acid replacement during insulin infusion on the glucagon response to hypoglycemia in six healthy nondiabetic subjects. In two separate studies, blood glucose was clamped at the postabsorptive level during a constant infusion of insulin (0.05 U.kg-1.h-1) for 3 h. Blood glucose was then reduced to 45 mg/dl over 20 min. Hormone and substrate concentrations during recovery from hypoglycemia were monitored for 2 h. In the control study, normal saline was infused, and in the other study, an amino acid mixture was infused to prevent the insulin-induced fall in plasma amino acids. Amino acid replacement did not change the basal glucagon levels but resulted in a more robust glucagon response to hypoglycemia (from 184 +/- 24 to 292 +/- 36 pg/ml) than in the control study (from 176 +/- 30 to an average 229 +/- 32 pg/ml, P less than 0.01).

Because the signs and symptoms of pneumonia in this population are frequently atypical, the clinician must maintain a low threshold for instituting therapy. In most cases the pathogenetic organism cannot be identified early in the course of the illness, necessitating the use of empiric, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. With the proper use of antibiotics and the resources available at most nursing homes, many patients with pneumonia probably can be successfully treated without the need for hospitalization.\r"

Also of pertinence to the elderly, renal disease, liver disease, congestive heart failure, hypothyroidism, hypoadrenalism, medications, and inadequate monitoring may also contribute to hypoglycemia.

Intracellular hepatitis B virus antigens were detected by immunofluorescence. The production of these antigens was evaluated in the culture media by enzyme-linked immunoassay. Hepatitis B virus DNA was detected using dot-blot hybridization. Three types of HBcAg staining were observed in transfected HepG2 cells: (a) cells with nuclear HBcAg, (b) cells with cytoplasmic HBcAg and (c) cells with both nuclear and cytoplasmic HBcAg. Cell types b and c also expressed hepatitis B virus DNA in their culture media. Our results suggest that cytoplasmic HBcAg may be more involved than nuclear HBcAg in hepatitis B virus replication. The site of hepatitis B virus formation in hepatocytes was studied by electron microscopic examination of a specific hepatitis B virus producer clone, thereby allowing detection of intracellular Dane particles more easily than liver biopsy samples from infected patients. Dane particles and HBsAg filaments were found in large, dilated structures probably related to the endoplasmic reticulum. Budding of core particles into cisternae of endoplasmic reticulum-related structures appears to be a possible mechanism for hepatitis B virus formation; our results suggest that the exocytosis of cisternae to extracellular spaces may be a mechanism for release of hepatitis B virus particles.\r"

Participating were 46 women, 19 to 54 yr old, with carcinoma, and 92 matched controls. South African blacks have a high incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, and urban black women have used contraceptive steroids fairly widely for a number of years. Use of contraceptive steroids for longer than 6 mo (mean duration 46.7 mo) was not found to pose a risk for development of hepatocellular carcinoma in this population--relative risk 0.8 (95% confidence interval [C.I.] 0.4 to 1.7). This was also true of use for longer than 8 yr--relative risk 0.6 (95% C.I. 0.2 to 2.5), and if a combination of an estrogen and a progestogen or a progestogen alone was used (relative risk 1.7 [95% C.I. 0.7 to 4.2] and 0.4 [95% C.I. 0.1 to 1.2], respectively). Chronic hepatitis B virus infection was confirmed to have an etiological association with hepatocellular carcinoma, but there was no evidence that contraceptive steroids acted as a co-carcinogen with the virus or, conversely, that they played a causal role in patients negative for hepatitis B surface antigenemia. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that contraceptive steroids may play a causal role in hepatocellular carcinoma in black women who have never been infected with the hepatitis B virus. Nor was there evidence that contraceptive steroids acted in concert with either cigarette smoking or chronic alcohol abuse in hepatocarcinogenesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Alterations in the circadian time structure of the secretion of several hormones were investigated in 13 male patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Seven were asymptomatic (classified CDC II, according to the criteria of the Atlanta Centers for Disease Control), and 6 had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (CDC IV). Ten healthy males volunteered as controls. Plasma levels of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate (DHEA-S), cortisol, testosterone, ACTH, and beta-endorphin were determined by RIA in blood samples obtained every 4 h from 0830-0830 h the next morning. Data were analyzed both by two-way analysis of variance and the cosinor method. Circadian rhythms were statistically validated for each of the six hormones in each of the three groups of subjects. Compared with the control subjects, mesors (24-h adjusted means) were significantly higher for cortisol and lower for DHEA, DHEA-S, and ACTH (P less than 0.001 for all four hormones) in all HIV-infected patients. Plasma testosterone mesors were similar in controls and CDC II patients, but decreased significantly in the CDC IV patient group (P less than 0.05). Analysis of the circadian rhythms of plasma hormone levels clearly indicated an altered adrenal hormonal state in HIV-infected male patients, even during the asymptomatic period of the infection. For instance, plasma cortisol at 0430 h was more than twice as high in HIV-infected patients as it was in time-qualified controls. Although patients already had elevated plasma cortisol and lowered adrenal androgen levels at this stage, hypogonadism was not observed, as gauged by plasma testosterone concentrations. We speculate that the primary hormonal defect in HIV-infected patients is increased cortisol secretion resulting from circadian-varying stimulation of the adrenal cortex by a factor other than pituitary ACTH. This factor might be a stimulating substance secreted primarily by infected immune cells. Excess cortisol would lower adrenal androgen secretion by shifting adrenal steroid biosynthesis toward glucocorticoids and decreasing pituitary ACTH secretion via a negative feedback mechanism.\r"

Exposure of cells to 3 x 10(-10) mol/L GnRH for 1-48 h significantly increased cumulative LH secretion compared to that in respective controls (P less than 0.01). The rate of GnRH-stimulated LH release was accelerated during the first 6 h, after which it declined to a level similar to that of basal release. This phenomenon was associated with a decrease in the GnRH concentration of the medium. Exposure of cells to GnRH (3 x 10(-10) to 10(-6) mol/L) for 48 h induced a dose-dependent elevation of total LH which correlated with an increase in releasable, but not cellular, LH. Desensitization to GnRH (10(-7) mol/L) occurred when cells were cultured with pharmacological amounts of GnRH for 48 h. These results indicate that GnRH induces the increase in total and releasable LH in human fetal pituitary cells. These cells also appear to inactivate GnRH. Thus, GnRH may increase LH production in the human fetal pituitary and the pituitary receptor mechanism may be involved in GnRH action on LH release during intrauterine life.\r"

Blood was withdrawn at 10- to 20-min intervals from 2000-0800 h. Pulse analysis was accomplished by a computerized peak detection algorithm. Pituitary and gonadal responsiveness was assessed by a standard exogenous LHRH challenge and testosterone. Subsequent clinical progress was monitored for a mean duration of 2.08 +/- 0.16 yr and used as the basis for classifying patients retrospectively into three groups: 1) prepubertal (n = 14), 2) peripubertal (n = 11), and 3) pubertal (n = 5). LH pulses were undetectable in 9 and present in 5 prepubertal subjects, the youngest of whom was aged 7.3 yr. In peripubertal and pubertal individuals, 2-7 LH pulses/12 h were detectable. LH pulses were detectable before sleep by midpuberty (Tanner stage 3). There was a highly significant (P less than 0.0001) increase in LH/LHRH pulse frequency from 0.93 +/- 0.38 to 4.55 +/- 0.43/12 h (mean +/- SEM) between the prepubertal and peripubertal groups and a further increase to 6.20 +/- 0.37/12 h in the pubertal group. LH pulse amplitude remained under 1.0 U/L in both the prepubertal and peripubertal groups and only increased significantly to 2.02 +/- 0.17 U/L in pubertal boys. Response to LHRH increased significantly between the prepubertal (2.47 +/- 0.49 U/L) and peripubertal (6.53 +/- 2.02 U/L) patients.

The patients are insensitive to mineralocorticoids; however, sodium supplementation is able to correct electrolyte abnormalities. Absent or greatly diminished type I aldosterone receptors in peripheral mononuclear leucocytes have been recently demonstrated and explain the lack of response to mineralocorticoids. We have studied the mode of inheritance in eight families with a total of nine patients. There was evidence for an autosomal recessive form of inheritance in four families, while the other four families appeared to have an autosomal dominant mode of transmission. In three families the autosomal recessive form was characterized by normal receptor as well as hormone data in both parents, while in one family receptor levels in both parents were greatly reduced, but hormone levels were normal. In the four families with an autosomal dominant mode of transmission there was always one parent with reduced receptor binding in peripheral mononuclear leucocytes and elevated serum hormone levels. These parents were entirely asymptomatic. In an extended family we were able to study an aunt and her newborn daughter, who were both also biochemically affected but clinically asymptomatic. It, therefore, appears that this dual pattern of genetic transmission may indicate differing genetic defects which cause the same clinical picture of pseudohypoaldosteronism.\r"

We describe a glucose reduction challenge test which may be useful as an out-patient screening procedure. Insulin is infused for 3 h at 40 mU/kg.h. Plasma glucose was monitored at the bedside during the test, and blood samples were collected for measurement of C-peptide. Responses were examined in 17 normal controls, and 6 patients with insulinomas. In normal subjects, mean plasma glucose fell to a plateau value of 3.2 +/- 0.2 mmol/L (57 +/- 2.6 mg/dL) and remained at that level with few symptoms. In contrast, five of six patients with insulinomas developed severe hypoglycemia, with plasma glucose levels between 1.9 (34 mg/dL) and 2.2 mmol/L (39 mg/dL). Plasma C-peptide concentrations were suppressed to 0.08 pmol/mL or less in normal subjects, but in insulinoma patients remained at 0.32-1.6 pmol/mL i.e. outside the normal range, and diagnostic of nonsuppressible insulin secretion. These data demonstrate that moderate reduction of serum glucose maintained for a prolonged period results in marked suppression of plasma C-peptide, permitting improved discrimination between normal subjects and patients with insulinomas. This glucose reduction challenge can, therefore, be used as a test of glucose-regulating ability, where failure (hypoglycemia) per se represents a measurable abnormality. C-Peptide measurements will determine whether the cause of hypoglycemia is due to hyperinsulinemia.\r"

  ".W": "One patient is reported who has the manifestations of Cushing's syndrome in spite of persistent hypocortisolemia. His serum levels of cortisol and free cortisol were below normal, and 24-h urinary excretion of 17-hydroxycorticosteroids and cortisol were decreased. There was a rapid and substantial increase in serum cortisol in response to synthetic ACTH-(1-24). Plasma levels of ACTH were marginally increased by successive administration of CRH and vasopressin, which were followed by substantial increases in serum cortisol. Glucocorticoid activity of the patient's serum, as measured by a RRA was low. There were no responses of urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids after metyrapone treatment. These laboratory examinations ruled out any known clinical conditions resulting in hypocortisolemia. The clinical condition could also be explained by cortisol hyperreactivity of the patient's cells. In vitro hyperreactivity to glucocorticoids was demonstrated in cultured skin fibroblasts whose aromatase activity was increased 1.5- to 1.8-fold above that of normal cells, and [3H]thymidine incorporation was inhibited more effectively by the addition of cortisol or dexamethasone. The mechanism by which the patient is hyperreactive to glucocorticoids remains unexplained.\r"

  ".W": "Male subjects administered the 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor finasteride were studied to determine its effect on C19 and C21 5 alpha-metabolism. Plasma testosterone (T) and 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) were measured and T/DHT ratios determined at doses of 0.2-80 mg. Urinary etiocholanolone (5 beta)/androsterone (5 alpha) ratios and 5 beta/5 alpha metabolite ratios of cortisol, 11 beta-hydroxyandrostenedione, and corticosterone were also measured. The steroid profile was compared to male pseudohermaphrodites with inherited 5 alpha-reductase deficiency who have a global defect in C19 and C21 5 alpha-metabolism. The mean plasma DHT levels were decreased at all doses, resulting in elevated T/DHT ratios. The mean urinary etiocholanolone/androsterone, 11 beta-hydroxyetiocholanolone/11 beta-hydroxyandrosterone, tetrahydrocortisol/allotetrahydrocortisol, and tetrahydrocorticosterone/allotetrahydrocorticosterone ratios were elevated compared to pretreatment levels and placebo control values. The mean ratios appeared to be dose dependent for plasma T/DHT, urinary etiocholanolone/androsterone tetrahydrocorticosterone/allotetrahydrocorticosterone ratios. The mean 11 beta-hydroxyetiocholanolone-hydroxyandrosterone ratio was maximally elevated at the lowest doses. The results indicate that finasteride has a broad steroid spectrum inhibiting C19 and C21 5 alpha-steroid metabolism and affecting hepatic and peripheral 5 alpha-metabolism. These results suggest that a single gene codes for a single 5 alpha-reductase enzyme with affinity for multiple steroid substrates. The steroid profile is strikingly similar to that of male pseudohermaphrodites with inherited 5 alpha-reductase deficiency.\r"

  ".W": "Ultrafast computed tomography was used to detect and quantify coronary artery calcium levels in 584 subjects (mean age 48 +/- 10 years) with (n = 109) and without (n = 475) clinical coronary artery disease. Fifty patients who underwent fluoroscopy and ultrafast computed tomography were also evaluated. Twenty contiguous 3 mm slices were obtained of the proximal coronary arteries. Total calcium scores were calculated based on the number, areas and peak Hounsfield computed tomographic numbers of the calcific lesions detected. In 88 subjects scored by two readers independently, interobserver agreement was excellent with identical total scores obtained in 70. Ultrafast computed tomography was more sensitive than fluoroscopy, detecting coronary calcium in 90% versus 52% of patients. There were significant differences (p less than 0.0001) in mean total calcium scores for those with versus those without clinical coronary artery disease by decade: 5 versus 132, age 30 to 39 years; 27 versus 291, age 40 to 49 years; 83 versus 462, age 50 to 59 years; and 187 versus 786, age 60 to 69 years. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values for clinical coronary artery disease were calculated for several total calcium scores in each decade. For age groups 40 to 49 and 50 to 59 years, a total score of 50 resulted in a sensitivity of 71% and 74% and a specificity of 91% and 70%, respectively. For age group 60 to 69 years, a total score of 300 gave a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 81%. The negative predictive value of a 0 score was 98%, 94% and 100% for age groups 40 to 49, 50 to 59 and 60 to 69 years, respectively. Ultrafast computed tomography is an excellent tool for detecting and quantifying coronary artery calcium.\r"

  ".W": "With the advent of multisensor micromanometric/velocimetric catheterization, digital angiography and Doppler and color echocardiography, extensive fluid dynamic quantitation is now possible in cardiology. Such high fidelity instantaneous measurements offer the clinician the prospect of identifying phasic changes in ventricular ejection dynamics that may disclose contraction abnormalities before overt muscle or pump failure is manifested. Accordingly, this review provides a basis for interpreting these measurements and a conceptual framework for understanding ventricular ejection dynamics with and without outflow obstruction. Necessary terminology and fluid dynamic background, including properties of flows generated by large transient forces, Euler and unsteady Bernoulli equations and local and convective acceleration gradients, are reviewed first. Physiologic aspects of ejection dynamics and transvalvular and intraventricular gradients without obstruction are discussed. Maximal outflow acceleration, rather than ejection velocity, coincides with the attainment of the early peak of the nonobstructive pressure gradients. These gradients are characteristically even more asymmetric than are the associated ejection velocity signals. Clinical correlations are introduced, beginning with obstructive transvalvular and subvalvular gradients in aortic stenosis and the phenomenon of recovery of pressure loss in the poststenotic dilation. The large obstructive gradients tend to be distinctively symmetric, as are the ejection waveforms, whose configuration they track more or less closely, depending on the degree of stenosis and relative preponderance of convective effects throughout ejection. Pitfalls in some unwarranted applications of the \"simplified Bernoulli equation\" are pointed out. Polymorphic gradients of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, reflecting dynamically dissimilar intraventricular flow regimes in early, mid and late systole, are examined. Enormous late systolic gradients can be associated with progressive shrinkage of flow passage area and sharp increases in linear velocity while volumetric outflow is diminutive. The concept of ventriculoannular disproportion in dilated ventricles is defined and discussed. The implications of ejection fluid dynamics for systolic ventricular and myocardial loading are examined, and the concept of complementarity and competitiveness between intrinsic and extrinsic load components is introduced. Finally, critical research issues are identified and addressed. The primary emphasis is on using the basic principles of fluid dynamics to better understand ejection in the normal or abnormal human left ventricle and aortic root.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The intravascular ultrasound images dramatically revealed dissection of the aortic wall and an intimal flap that was not appreciated on cineaortography or digital subtraction angiography. Intravascular ultrasound imaging may yield important morphologic information unavailable by other imaging techniques. Such information may allow more precise definition of the results of intravascular procedures and improve understanding of lesion characteristics predictive of a successful outcome.\r"

We present the second reported case of IHSDH due to traumatic arterial laceration. This lesion demonstrates a benign and delayed initial presentation. Conservative observation has been employed in the past with mixed results. Patients receiving early definitive surgical treatment have a lower mortality rate then those treated similarly having convexity SDHs. This review of 31 cases discusses the salient aspects of this clinical entity, emphasizing the need for prompt diagnosis and treatment, despite the patient's seemingly stable neurological status.\r"

Antibodies to the HA and NA surface antigens of influenza viruses, both naturally and vaccine induced, are protective. The earliest influenza vaccines were crude, toxic, and ineffective. With modern purification techniques, the egg-grown viruses have been turned into safe, immunogenic, and effective killed-virus vaccines--whole virus and split virus. Surveillance permits the correct virus strains to be incorporated into each new vaccine. Those who have been experiencing the worst effects of influenza have been identified. These individuals need to be immunized each year. In the future, live influenza virus vaccines may offer the benefits of ease of administration and longer-lasting protection. Synthetic peptides, genetically engineered antigens, and even nonantigen (anti-idiotype) vaccines are possible, but such vaccines will require adjuvant enhancement. For the present, greater efforts must be made to use existing influenza vaccines.\r"

  ".W": "Five to 10% of people reach adulthood still susceptible to VZV, which generally causes more severe primary disease in adults than seen in children. A live attenuated varicella vaccine was developed in Japan in the early 1970s and has now been tested in several trials in healthy children, immunocompromised children, and healthy adults. The vaccine is highly immunogenic in healthy children, conferring immunity for at least 7 to 10 years with a high degree of protective efficacy. In several trial in adults, the vaccine has been shown to be highly immunogenic. Humoral and cell-mediated immunity wanes in vaccinated adults, however, with antibodies to VZV detectable in approximately only 80% of vaccinated individuals after 1 year, and in approximately 70% from 2 to 6 years after vaccination. In leukemic children who have been vaccinated, however, this loss of detectable antibody has not been correlated with a reduction in protection during this time. Similar analyses have not been made in vaccinated adults because the numbers intimately exposed to VZV have been small. Protective efficacy after household exposure is approximately 65% in adults; however, when breakthrough (i.e., in those who have seroconverted) illness has occurred, it has invariably been mild, so that efficacy in preventing severe disease has been 100%. \"Vaccine failures,\" however, may develop full-blown varicella. Side effects of immunization in adults are mild: a transient local reaction occurs in 10 to 21% and a mild rash in 6 to 8%. There is a theoretical risk of transmission of the attenuated virus if a vaccine-induced rash occurs, which has been documented only in contacts of vaccinated leukemics (any secondary disease has also been mild). To date, there has been no evidence that vaccination increases the risk of developing zoster; on the contrary, studies in leukemic children, who may be considered a \"sentinel population\" in this regard, suggest that the risk of zoster after vaccination may be reduced compared with the risk after natural infection. Susceptible adults who would most benefit from vaccination against VZV include health care workers, those who care for small children, women of child-bearing age prior to pregnancy, military recruits, and college students.\r"

Plasma-derived and recombinant vaccines produced in yeast are highly immunogenic, safe, and effective for all age groups. Decreased response and protection by vaccine occur in older persons and in persons with immunosuppressive illnesses. The main issues concerning current vaccination programs include the possible use of lower doses to reduce the cost of the vaccine, the duration of protection and need for vaccine booster doses, and the need for postvaccination testing in hospitals. The failure of current vaccination programs to decrease disease incidence, a matter of great concern nationally, can be ascribed to failure to deliver vaccine to the groups at highest risk. More effective strategies for control, including the universal vaccination of infants or adolescents, must now be examined. Newer vaccines that incorporate other viral antigens and that may offer increased efficacy are being developed. Vaccines to prevent hepatitis A--both killed and live attenuated vaccines--are undergoing clinical trials and may become available in the next 5 years.\r"

  ".W": "Although only few cases of diphtheria are reported annually in the United States, substantial numbers of adults have declining levels of protective serum antitoxin. A recent outbreak of diphtheria in Sweden emphasizes the importance of reimmunizing adults in diphtheria toxoid, included as part of routine use of tetanus/diphtheria toxoid. Tetanus is a completely preventable disease. Yet, most of the 60 to 100 annual cases of tetanus occur in older adults with no prior history of immunization. Tetanus immunization should be a routine part of medical care of all adults. Research currently is aimed at improving the efficacy and safety of pertussis vaccine. Future vaccines may be useful in protecting health care workers and other adults who have extensive contact with children against pertussis.\r"

  ".W": "We report here the successful selective cultivation of murine thymic mesenchymal reticular cells (MTMC) and murine thymic epithelial cells (MTEC) grown on extracellular matrix in the presence of defined medium. The selective growth of these two cell types was based on 1) conditions of tissue disruption and 2) differential growth requirements. Both cell types were dependent on transferrin, high density lipoproteins, insulin, hydrocortisone, and epidermal growth factor, whereas MTMC was dependent also on selenium and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine. The elimination of single factors or extracellular matrix resulted in specific and different changes in the growth pattern of each cell subpopulation. Cells of both types exhibited the ultrastructural features of high metabolic activity. The epithelial nature of MTEC cultures was defined by bundles of tonofilaments and desmosomes and by positive staining to keratins and negative to vimentin. In addition MTEC were positively stained with mAb to thymic medullary epithelial cells and by Ulex europeus agglutinin, and were able to form Hassall's corpuscles, suggesting their medullary origin. MTEC were also H-2 and Ia positive. In contrast MTMC were positive for vimentin and periodic acid-Schiff, low positive for H-2, and negative for keratin and Ia. Both cells did not contain nonspecific esterase, nor did they phagocytize latex beads. With the use of all these criteria we classified MTEC as epithelial cells from the medullary compartment of the thymus and MTMC as reticular cells of mesenchymal origin.\r"

  ".W": "Two morphologically distinct primary cultures of murine thymic stroma were established and found to be of epithelial (MTEC) and mesenchymal (MTMC) origin. These cultures were generated by selective conditions of tissue disruption and were maintained on extracellular matrix in defined medium. Culture supernatants (CS) from these cultures (EC-CS and MC-CS respectively), were tested for cytokine production and for effects on thymocyte maturation. Both supernatants displayed the activities of IL-3 and of granulocyte/macrophage-CSF and not of IL-1, -2, -4, or IFN. In addition they were found to be mitogenic to murine thymocytes in a \"spontaneous\" [3H]TdR incorporation assay. The two supernatants differed, however, in their effect on Con A stimulation. EC-CS had a strong enhancing effect, both when used for preincubation (18 h) before Con A stimulation or when present simultaneously with it. MC-CS had a small inconsistent effect under these conditions. Also EC-CS enhanced IL-2 and IL-3 production by thymocytes. The responsive thymocyte subpopulation was the one that does not bind peanut agglutinin. CS of an established thymic epithelial cell line displayed only part of these activities at a considerably lower level. CS from primary kidney cell culture was completely devoid of activity. The results suggest that primary thymic stromal cell cultures, cultivated under the defined conditions described here, may better preserve physiologic secretory activities, and probably also other cell functions, compared with established cell lines. Furthermore, the results are compatible with the hypothesis that the soluble factors, secreted by thymic stromal cells, are active on either very early or late stages of thymic differentiation, whereas the main intrathymic stages of differentiation are conceivable dependent primarily on direct contact with stromal cells.\r"

  ".W": "The present study shows that a mAb (H4C4) developed against human peripheral blood adherent cells has the unusual property of inducing in vitro homotypic aggregation of several types of hemopoietic cells and cell lines. The Ag recognized by mAb H4C4 is a 85-kDa glycoprotein that corresponds to the human Ag CD44 (equivalent to murine Pgp-1), as determined by protein purification, immunologic cross-reactivity studies, and tryptic fragment sequencing. In addition to H4C4, other mAb directed against some, but not all, epitopes of CD44(Pgp-1) were capable of inducing cell aggregation. This process was temperature sensitive and was almost totally abrogated by cytochalasin B but was unaffected by sodium azide, colchicine, EGTA, trifluoperazine, or staurosporin. A role for CD44 (Pgp-1) in cell-to-cell adhesion was further indicated by an inverse relationship observed between spontaneous aggregation of some hemopoietic cell lines and cell-surface expression of CD44(Pgp-1). These observations provide evidence for a fundamental role of CD44(Pgp-1) in cellular aggregation phenomena with an involvement of the cytoskeleton.\r"

Ten out of 31 MS patients (32.2%), 19 of 66 patients (28.8%) with other neurologic diseases, and 2 of 64 healthy blood donors (3.1%) had antibodies reactive with Ag corresponding to the group-specific Ag (gag) proteins (p15, p19, p24) on their sera. There were no significant differences between MS and other neurologic diseases concerning the patterns and the frequency. Second, we tried to establish T cell lines from PBMC of 22 MS patients with crude IL-2 without accessory cells, because HTLV-I-infected T cells can be immortalized in a high ratio under those conditions. Only one T cell line (MS-14C), however, could be maintained in long term culture. MS-14C and cultured T cells for 3 to 5 wk derived from MS patients were examined by Southern blot analysis under both stringent and low stringent conditions with HTLV-I as a probe. No HTLV-I related bands could be detected. By polymerase chain reaction examination, we also could not detect HTLV-I provirus genome in the fresh PBMC from 20 MS patients, although some of them had gag-reactive antibodies. Our data do not favor the hypothesis of HTLV-I or an HTLV-I-related human retrovirus in the etiology of MS.\r"

MAIDS has been characterized by rapid and profound lymphoproliferation accompanied by hypergammaglobulinemia and immunosuppression. As early as 2 wk postinfection, there is a selective depletion of CD8+ cells whereas the total number of CD4+ cells increases throughout the first 8 wk of infection although the frequency is relatively stable. These population changes were partially delayed by oral AZT therapy for 6 wk postinfection. Ly-6C (AL-21) is expressed on roughly 50% of CD4+ and CD8+ cells in C57BL/6 mice. In MAIDS, the residual population of CD8+ cells is primarily Ly-6C+. The CD4+ cells have a transient increase in ratio of Ly-6C+/Ly-6C- cells at 2 wk postinfection but by 6 wk are primarily Ly-6C-. There was an increase in both the total number and percentage of Mac 1+ cells and a selective depletion of certain splenic B cell subpopulations. Azido dideoxythymidine delays these early population changes.\r"

  ".U": "90171569\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies suggested that the potent immunosuppressive activities of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) were mediated in part through the inhibition of IL-2-dependent S-phase progression and mitosis of activated T cells. To further investigate the mechanism of T cell growth inhibition by TGF-beta, two constitutively activated murine T cell clones were employed as defined model systems for the growth factor-dependent phase of T cell proliferation. The Th cell line, HT-2, proliferated in response to either IL-2 or IL-4, whereas the cytotoxic T cell line, CT6, exhibited strict dependence on IL-2 for growth stimulation. In both cell lines, picomolar concentrations of TGF-beta inhibited S-phase progression stimulated by IL-2 or IL-4. TGF-beta pretreatment decreased the expression of high affinity IL-2R on HT-2 cells, but not on CT6 cells. In contrast, IL-2-stimulated transferrin receptor expression was markedly inhibited by TGF-beta in both T cell lines. Analyses of growth factor-dependent specific mRNA accumulation revealed that TGF-beta exerted selective inhibitory effects on gene expression in HT-2 and CT6 cells. TGF-beta significantly reduced early (1 to 2 h) increases in c-myc mRNA levels stimulated by IL-2 or IL-4 in both cell lines. In HT-2 cells, TGF-beta pretreatment also inhibited the early increase in granulocyte-macrophage CSF mRNA stimulated by IL-2 or IL-4. The inhibition of c-myc and granulocyte-macrophage cyte-macrophage CSF gene expression by TGF-beta was explained, at least in part, by suppression of the growth factor-dependent transcriptional activation of these genes. These studies suggest that inhibition of c-myc gene transcription may play a fundamental role in the antiproliferative effect of TGF-beta on IL-2- or IL-4-stimulated T cells.\r"

  ".U": "90171572\r", 
  ".W": "We have studied the properties of several developmentally defined subpopulations of CD4+ T cells from normal animals which can be stimulated to secrete lymphokines. We find that the Th cells responsible for direct secretion of lymphokines after stimulation are from a resting, very long lived subpopulation of CD4+ T cells which persists for over 25 wk after adult thymectomy. These T cells are depleted by in vivo administration of antithymocyte serum and they are enriched among T cells which express high levels of Pgp-1. This phenotype suggests that the T cells responsible are most likely memory T cells which have resulted from antigen exposure in vivo. T cells in this subset secrete predominantly IL-2 with small quantities of IL-3, granulocyte/macrophage CSF, and IFN-gamma. In contrast, the CD4+ T cells which require in vitro culture and restimulation before they develop into an effector population with the ability to secrete lymphokines after restimulation, differ dramatically by most of these criteria. The precursors we study are resting Th cells which are considerably shorter lived after adult thymectomy (5 to 10 wk) and resistant to the same doses of antithymocyte serum which deplete the putative memory population. We hypothesize that this precursor population represents naive helper cells which have not yet encountered Ag. The effectors derived from such precursors can be stimulated to secrete high levels of both Th cell types 1 and 2 lymphokines (IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-5, granulocyte/macrophage CSF, and IL-3). Generation of effectors requires proliferation and differentiation events which occur during a mandatory culture with lymphokines and antigen presenting cells for 3 to 4 days. We discuss the striking phenotypic and functional differences among these subpopulations of helper cells--the precursor population and the two types--memory and cultured effector Th which secrete lymphokines. We also discuss the relationship of these populations to CD4+ T cell subsets defined by other studies of patterns of lymphokine secretion and by cell surface phenotype.\r"

  ".W": "A modification of the in vitro immobilization assay together with freeze-fracture analysis was used to determine the factors responsible for the prolonged time required in vitro to achieve killing of Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum. The modified immobilization assay permitted separate determination of the time required for binding of antibody to the surface of T. pallidum and for C activation. Treponemes were preincubated in heat-inactivated immune rabbit serum (IRS) followed by washing the organisms in 2.5% BSA/PBS to remove unbound IRS antibody before the addition of C. The results showed that a comparable degree of C-dependent killing occurred when treponemes were preincubated in heat-inactivated IRS for either 30 min or 16 h, indicating that treponemicidal antibody rapidly binds to the surface of T. pallidum. Preincubation of treponemes for 17 h in heat-inactivated IRS followed by a 1-h incubation in C resulted in the loss of 80% treponemal motility, indicating that C activation results in rapid killing of T. pallidum. Treponemes preincubated in IRS for 1 h, then incubated for 8 h and 16 h in heat-inactivated normal serum also lost a significant level of motility after the addition of C; in contrast, motility was unaffected after 30 min and 4 h of incubation in heat-inactivated normal serum under similar conditions. These results demonstrate that, whereas antibody binding to and C-mediated killing of treponemes can proceed rapidly, the prolonged time to C activation limits the rate at which treponemicidal activity occurs in vitro. In addition, treponemicidal activity using the modified immobilization assay could not be demonstrated with antiserum against T. pallidum endoflagella, antiserum against proteins solubilized from T. pallidum using the detergent Triton X-114, and a mAb to the T. pallidum r190-kDa \"4D\" protein, suggesting that these molecules are not accessible to surface binding antibody. Freeze-fracture analysis, recently used in our laboratory to demonstrate that the outer membrane of T. pallidum has rare constituent protein, was utilized to demonstrate outer membrane target Ag of IRS antibody. T. pallidum rare outer membrane protein (TROMP) molecules were shown in freeze-fracture electron micrographs to be consistently aggregated following a 16-h incubation of treponemes in IRS. In contrast, no aggregation of TROMP was present in treponemes incubated in normal rabbit serum for 16 h or in treponemes incubated in IRS for 2 h. These findings suggest that the rate of C activation leading to in vitro treponemicidal activity is limited by the time required for aggregation of antibody-bound TROMP molecules.\r"

  ".W": "The presence of Langerhans cells (LC) within the epidermis has been shown to be critical for inducing T-cell-mediated immune responses in the skin. The purpose of this study was to assess whether cells in the dermis can initiate T-cell-mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity responses in vivo. Initially, back skins from C3H mice were trypsinized to remove the epidermis. The dermis was enzymatically dispersed and filtered to obtain a cell suspension. However, dermal cells exposed to trypsin were contaminated with numerous disaggregated hair follicles. These hair follicles contained Ia+ cells (presumably LC), and upon haptenation in vitro with trinitrophenyl, initiated contact hypersensitivity reactions in vivo. We therefore used dispase in place of trypsin to prevent follicular disaggregation and to allow preparation of dermal cell suspensions free of hair follicles. These hair follicle-free dermal cells were haptenated with trinitrophenyl and injected intradermally. Elicitation of contact hypersensitivity by epicutaneous painting 6 d later revealed the mean +/- SEM incremental ear-swelling response to be 53 +/- 8 mm X 10(-3). In contrast, mice sensitized by injection with dermal cells depleted of Ia+ cells demonstrated only 10 +/- 1 mm X 10(-3) of ear swelling. Thus, like dendritic LC of the epidermis, perivascular dendritic Ia+ cells of the dermis are capable of initiating T-cell-mediated contact hypersensitivity in vivo and may be highly relevant for presentation of antigen to T cells trafficking through the dermis.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) were obtained by mechanical release from a solitary rapidly grown tumor of a patient with mycosis fungoides. The preparations separated by density gradient centrifugation contained a major portion of CD3+ CD8+ WT31+ CD5- large T-cell blasts and a minor portion of non-blastic TIL predominantly of the CD3+ CD4+ phenotype. Using cDNA-probes for the constant region of the T-cell receptor beta-genes, the large cell fraction was identified as tumor by its distinct monoclonal rearrangement. TIL were expanded by culture in recombinant interleukin 2 and cloned by limiting dilution. Phenotypic analysis of expanded TIL and two clones further analyzed in more detail showed CD3+, CD4+, CD8-, and 2H4+ (CD45R+) expression. Cloned and uncloned TIL showed no NK and LAK activity, no proliferative response, and no cytotoxic activity against autologous tumor cells. These cells were unable to suppress the proliferative response of alloreactive T-cell clones stimulated by B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (i.e., they had no suppressor-effector activity), but strongly suppressed proliferation responses in allogeneic mixed lymphocyte culture (i.e., they most likely had suppressor-inducer activity). This was not the case when irradiated tumor cells were added. The present results demonstrate continuous in vitro growth of CD4+ and 2H4+ T-cell clones with suppressor-inducer activity obtained from TIL, and indicate that a subpopulation of TIL may down-regulate immune responses which may lead to suppression of antitumor immunity.\r"

Here it is shown that human freshly isolated Langerhans cells (LC) constitutively express ICAM-1, as expected. It seems likely that the amounts of ICAM-1 moieties expressed on the plasma membrane of resting LC are only limited, since they virtually escaped detection by conventional immunofluorescence procedures on epidermal sheets. However, all the observed Birbeck granule-bearing LC showed their clear, although relatively weak, ICAM-1 positivity when more sensitive techniques were employed, such as colloidal gold-immunoelectronmicroscopy using gold particles 15nm in size and, to an even higher extent, using gold particles 5 nm in size. Because ICAM-1 is a ligand for the adhesive molecule LFA-1, which is expressed on the surface of leukocytes and, especially, lymphocytes, the ICAM-1 (LC)/LFA-1 (T-lymphocytes) interactions might, enabling these cells to adhere together, deliver activation signals to T cells, thus constituting the initial event in the generation of a cutaneous immune response.\r"

  ".U": "90171617\r", 
  ".W": "Recent papers have reported that there are at least two distinct binding sites of bullous pemphigoid (BP) antibodies; one is the extracellular (lamina lucida) BP antigen (E-BPA) and the other is the intracellular (basal cell cytomembrane-hemidesmosome-cytoskeleton) BP antigen (I-BPA). In attempting to characterize the properties of these two BP antigens (BPA), we have investigated the expression of E-BPA and I-BPA as well as other basement membrane zone (BMZ) components such as type IV collagen, laminin, and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) antigen at the dermal-epibolic junction as a model system for BMZ neogenesis. I-BPA was found along the dermal-epidermal junction and throughout the whole length of the dermal-epibolic junction. However, E-BPA and other BMZ components were found along the dermal-epidermal junction and along only the most proximal portion of the dermal-epibolic junction. These results suggest 1) that emergence of E-BPA varies from that of I-BPA in such a model system of BMZ neogenesis, and 2) that the emerged E-BPA may attach to the newly formed basement membrane complex.\r"

  ".W": "An experimental transplantation model using human fetal skin was applied to approach the question of the embryologic origin of human Merkel cells. Palmar and plantar skin from five fetuses, between 8 and 11 weeks of estimated gestational age (EGA), was xenografted to subcutaneous beds of nude mice. After 4 or 8 weeks of growth, biopsies were taken from these xenografts and examined for the presence of Merkel cells, using immunocytochemistry with antibodies specific for simple epithelial-type cytokeratins and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) as well as using electron microscopy. Skin from the same fetuses at the time of transplantation was screened in the same way. In all fetuses, no (or very scarce) epidermal Merkel cells were detected at the transplantation time, but in all cases abundant epidermal Merkel cells of apparent human origin were found after 4 or 8 weeks in xenograft culture. Dermal nerve fibers, as recognized by neurofilament antibodies, were scarce or essentially absent in the xenografts. These results indicate that Merkel cells regularly develop in epidermis dissected and xenografted in an early fetal stage, although the dissection implies the interruption of the dermal nerves. The results strongly support the notion of the origin of Merkel cells from epidermal precursor cells. The apparent absence of dermal Merkel cells and dermal nerve fibers in the xenografts suggests that the presence of dermal sensory nerve fibers may be required for the dropping off of epidermal Merkel cells into the upper dermis, which occurs in normal fetal development.\r"

  ".U": "90171623\r", 
  ".W": "Monocytes stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) release mediators that induce increased responses of human granulocytes. Recently we showed that psoriatic monocytes can stimulate neutrophil chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and O2- production without addition of LPS and this effect is inhibited by cyclosporin A. We have now investigated the presence of cytokines in supernatants from cultures of psoriatic monocytes (resting monocytes). These cells were cultured for 24 h in endotoxin-free medium. Normal human neutrophils were then incubated for 1 h with the resulting supernatants (sMS, or conditioned media). The sMS from unstimulated psoriatic monocytes significantly enhanced neutrophil chemotaxis and superoxide anion production. The enhancing factors are protein in nature and require ongoing protein synthesis, demonstrated by the facts that the activity in conditioned medium is labile to heat denaturation at 100 degrees C for 10 min, is not produced by monocytes cultured in the presence of puromycin, and is proteinase sensitive. Additional evidence suggested that extremes of pH inhibit activity. None of the conditioned media treated in these ways activated neutrophils. The neutrophil function-enhancing factors derived from psoriatic monocytes are in part cytokines, including TNF and GM-CSF. The support for this conclusion is the higher level of TNF and GM-CSF in media conditioned by psoriatic monocytes than in media conditioned by normal human monocytes, the inhibition of TNF production and neutrophil stimulating activity by cyclosporin A, and the inhibition of neutrophil stimulating activity in conditioned media preincubated with anti-TNF and anti-GM-CSF antibodies. It is concluded that psoriatic monocytes spontaneously produce higher than normal levels of TNF alpha, GM-CSF, and, perhaps, other cytokines that might be responsible for the enhanced activity of psoriatic neutrophils.\r"

As trying as it may be to have a borderline patient in a practice, and as slow as progress with the patient may be, successful management of such patients will add poise, confidence, and maturity to the exercise of these invaluable primary care skills. More clinical and empirical discussion of borderline personality disorder is needed in the family practice literature. Probably no other professional is more likely to see such patients. The informed, motivated family physician, with the help of a supportive multidisciplinary team, can make invaluable contributions to reducing morbidity in borderline patients and can help avoid misunderstanding, frustration, and exhaustion in the health care team of the patient with this challenging disorder.\r"

Antibodies specific for GM1, however, which do not bind to GaL(beta 1-3)GalNAc, did not bind to the motoneurons. This suggests that Gal(beta 1-3)GalNAc bearing glycoproteins or glycolipids other than GM1 are expressed on the surface of motoneurons, while GM1 may be absent or shielded, and that antibody binding to the cell surface might contribute to the development of the motor neuron disease.\r"

In quadriceps muscle fibers there was a marked gradual diminution of the dystrophin-negative fiber segments between age 10 and 60 days. We suggest that this was partly due to a spontaneous fusion of dystrophin-competent satellite cells into the dystrophin-negative fiber segments and partly to an expansion of the cytoplasmic domain of dystrophin expression related to the original myonuclei. In cardiac muscle that lacks satellite cells, there was persistence of a large number of dystrophin-negative fiber segments even at age 60 days and probably beyond. The findings of this study have implications for the detection of heterozygote female carriers of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and for the possible therapy of DMD muscles by myoblast transfer.\r"

The estimated survival at 5 years from the start of treatment was 56% in IRS-I and 62% in IRS-II (P = .006). The largest survival difference between studies was in patients with group III tumors (52% v 65%). The clinical group was the most important patient characteristic related to survival in both studies. Survival progressively decreased for patients from clinical group I (localized disease, completely resected) to group IV (metastatic disease at the onset). In clinical group I, the only patient characteristic consistently related to survival was histology. Patients with alveolar tumors had the poorest survival, while those with botryoid/embryonal lesions had the best survival. In clinical group II, no characteristic was consistently related to survival. In clinical group III, an orbital primary site was associated with a favorable survival. In clinical group IV, patients with genitourinary tumors had a significant survival advantage. Use of disease-free survival as an end point gave very similar results. This information, from the largest available data base on prognostic indicators in childhood RMS in the context of aggressive multimodal therapies, is being used to plan therapy in the forthcoming study (IRS-IV).\r"

Patients whose disease progressed on treatment with FUra alone were, if eligible, crossed over to receive leucovorin and FUra. Three patients on the FUra plus leucovorin arm of the study were excluded from the analysis because they did not meet eligibility requirements. The treatment arms were well balanced for prognostic criteria including performance status, age, prior radiotherapy, distribution of metastatic sites, and on-study carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), lactic dehydrogenase, and serum albumin. FUra plus leucovorin was superior to FUra alone for response (P = .0019) and for time to progression or death (log-rank, P = .045). Response rates were 16 of 36 (44%) versus five of 40 (13%), and median time to progression or death was 164 versus 120 days in the two arms of the trial, respectively. Overall survival, however, while longer in the FUra and leucovorin arm was not significantly so. An analysis of the toxicities experienced by the patients in the two treatment groups showed that, except for significantly more stomatitis in the leucovorin arm of the study, the side effects experienced by patients treated with either regimen were comparable. These results suggest that the efficacy of FUra in patients with advanced, measurable, metastatic colorectal cancer can be enhanced significantly by administration of a continuous high-dose infusion of leucovorin calcium.\r"

All patients had either stage IIIC or stage IV disease. Two intensive induction courses of chemotherapy were administered at 28-day intervals, which consisted of cisplatin 40 mg/m2 daily for 5 days, cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 day 1, and doxorubicin 40 mg/m2 day 1. Four courses of chemotherapy using cisplatin 60 mg/m2, doxorubicin 40 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 followed the high-dose induction therapy. Two of the first six patients died during high-dose induction therapy (one died of neutropenia and sepsis, one of intercurrent intracerebral hemorrhage). Doxorubicin was subsequently omitted from the induction therapy due to unacceptable myelosuppression; no deaths occurred in the remaining 19 patients, and myelosuppression was manageable. Peripheral neuropathy was the most severe side effect with this regimen. This complication was unpredictable, developed during the third or fourth month of treatment, and was disabling in five patients. Other toxicity included prolonged nausea and vomiting (eight patients), ototoxicity (five patients), and nephrotoxicity (two patients), but these did not compromise therapy. All 23 assessable patients had objective response to therapy. Four of 12 patients who underwent second-look laparotomy had pathologic complete response, while four additional patients had only microscopic residual disease. The median survival for the entire group was 25 months. Four patients remain continuously disease-free 23 to 48 months following completion of therapy. Although this regimen was tolerated by most patients, the unpredictable occurrence of disabling neuropathy may limit its usefulness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Between 1981 and 1986, 279 consecutive patients with clinical stage I (CS1) nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCT) of the testis underwent pathological staging (PS) with retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy (RPLND). Patients with retroperitoneal metastases (PS2) received adjuvant chemotherapy. The median follow-up time after RPLND was 50 months (range, 30 to 90). Clinical and histopathologic features were registered prospectively and analyzed for association with risk of having PS2, relapse despite pathological stage 1 (PS1) or the combined risk of either event, metastatic disease (MET). Seventy-five (26.9%) of the patients had PS2 disease, and 30 (14.7%) of the 204 PS1 patients relapsed, indicating that at least 105 (37.6%) of this CS1 population had subclinical MET at the time of orchiectomy. Four (1.4%) of the 279 CS1 patients died of testicular cancer. Multivariate analyses showed several variables to be significantly associated with outcome for the CS1 patients; vascular invasion in primary tumor and normal preorchiectomy serum alpha-fetoprotein (Pre-AFP) level indicated PS2 disease. If Pre-AFP was excluded from the model, the absence of teratoma or yolk sac elements in the primary tumor became significant predictors of PS2. Vascular invasion, absence of teratoma, and a short interval between orchiectomy and RPLND indicated increased risk of relapse in PS1 patients. Vascular invasion, normal Pre-AFP, absence of teratoma elements, and a short orchiectomy to RPLND interval were predictive of MET. Our results indicate that prognostic factors useful for stratification of CS1 patients with NSGCT to different treatment options may be established.\r"

All patients had axillary lymph node metastases after at least a total mastectomy and axillary clearance. At 96 months median follow-up, 9.1% of the patients died without apparent relapse from cancer. An additional 1.9% had a second malignant neoplastic disease (not breast cancer). The 8-year disease-free survival (DFS) percentages (+/- SE) for the p + T and the observation groups were 36% (+/- 4%), and 22% (+/- 3%), (P = .004). The 8-year overall survival percentages were 49% (+/- 4%) and 42% (+/- 4%), respectively (P = .43). We conclude that despite a large proportion of deaths without relapse of breast cancer, a significant advantage for the p + T group in terms of DFS was demonstrated. We hypothesize that an endocrine therapy of longer duration might have an overall survival benefit in a population of elderly patients.\r"

The patients were part of a prospective randomized clinical trial on the efficacy of adjuvant single-agent chemotherapy with doxorubicin. Chemotherapy did not improve the metastasis-free survival (MFS). After a median follow-up time of 48 months (range, 2 to 97), a multivariate analysis of prognostic factors for developing metastatic disease was performed. DNA aneuploidy was found to be an independent prognostic risk factor in addition to histologic malignancy grade IV, intratumoral vascular invasion, tumor size over 10 cm, and male sex. Patients with none or one risk factor had a 5-year MFS of 79%, with two risk factors 65%, with three risk factors 43%, and with four and five risk factors 0%. About one half (78 of 148) of the patients with three factors or less belonged to a group with a MFS over 60%. The combination of different risk factors, including DNA aneuploidy, seems to be a useful prognostic model for soft tissue sarcomas, which could be of value to select high-risk patients for further trials with adjunctive therapy.\r"

Electroencephalograms did not correlate with clinical or other neurophysiologic measures of interhemispheric asymmetry. By ultrasound imaging, the right internal carotid artery velocity was approximately 62% of that on the left, and right internal carotid flow was reduced by 74% (p less than or equal to 0.01), whereas an age-matched control group showed no differences. A decrease in the amplitude of the long-latency auditory and somatosensory evoked potentials was noted over the right hemisphere after left-sided stimulation compared with the left hemispheric potentials after right-sided stimulation (p less than or equal to 0.005). No significant differences in hemispheric symmetry were noted in the amplitudes for wave V of the auditory brain-stem response or in the P30 component of the middle-latency auditory evoked potentials. Likewise, latency measures of the evoked potentials were symmetric. We conclude that (1) neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is associated with long-lasting decreased right internal carotid blood flow with compensatory increased flow through the left carotid system and (2) there is a consistent reduction in the amplitude of right hemispheric long-latency evoked potentials. These latter findings may reflect redirected cerebral blood flow patterns after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.\r"

For 5 months a 5-year-old boy with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in remission had anemia without reticulocytes or bone marrow erythrocyte precursors. His serum lacked IgG and IgM to B19 but contained B19 DNA. He received gamma globulin intravenously (0.4 gm/kg/day for 5 days); his viremia promptly cleared and reticulocytosis developed. A 14-year-old boy with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in remission had fever, rash, neutropenia (less than 300 leukocytes/mm3), and a hemophagocytic syndrome lasting 3 weeks. His serum contained IgM to B19 and B19 DNA. Without therapy, IgG to B19 developed; although low levels of B19 DNA persisted, the leukocyte count returned to normal. In a 19-year-old patient with systemic lupus erythematosus and hemolytic anemia, an aplastic crisis lasted 2 weeks. Her serum lacked IgG and IgM to B19 but contained B19 DNA. Without therapy, IgG and IgM to B19 appeared, viremia diminished, and reticulocytosis occurred. These patients illustrate the varied manifestations of chronic B19 infections, the importance of DNA detection for diagnosis, and the possible efficacy of gamma globulin therapy.\r"

All infants born at less than 33 weeks of gestation who were admitted to the intensive care nursery of Thomas Jefferson University Hospital from 1982 to 1986 were serially studied with cranial ultrasound methods that reliably detect neonatal periventricular echodensities (PVE) and cysts that are 2 mm in diameter or larger. PVE were graded as mild or as moderate to severe, and cyst size was classified by widest diameter as either large (greater than or equal to 3 mm) or small (less than 3 mm). All 127 surviving infants with PVE or cyst formation or both were followed until spastic forms of CP could be diagnosed or excluded during late infancy. All 26 of the infants in whom spastic CP developed had moderate or severe PVE in the area superior and lateral to the caudothalamic notch as noted on the parasagittal images of the neonatal neurosonograms. All these infants also developed cysts in the periventricular region within the area of the previously noted PVE. Mild or moderate to severe PVE were not associated with the development of spastic CP in 101 infants. Cysts developed in the area of PVE in the neurosonographic studies of 42 of these 101 infants. Mild PVE without cysts and moderate to severe PVE without cysts had negative predictive values for CP of 69% and 76%, respectively. By contrast, the presence of moderate to severe PVEs with large cyst formation had positive and negative predictive values of 90% and 93%, respectively, and was the most sensitive and specific neurosonographic finding for predicting CP, with an efficiency of 92%. The presence or absence of intracranial hemorrhage did not increase the efficiency of the ultrasound test results.\r"

We projected AIDS mortality by applying Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival time following diagnosis to the projected number of cases. The median incubation period for AIDS among homosexual and bisexual men infected with the human immunodeficiency virus was estimated to be 11.0 years (mean, 11.8 years; 95% confidence interval, 10.6 to 13.0 years).

After a 4- to 6-week placebo run-in period, 297 qualifying patients were randomized to receive placebo, 1 of 4 doses of diltiazem SR monotherapy, 1 of 3 doses of hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy, or 1 of 12 possible combinations of diltiazem SR and hydrochlorothiazide for 6 weeks. A dose-related reduction in blood pressure was demonstrated for each drug as monotherapy and for the two drugs in combination. Absolute blood pressures of patients who received combination therapy were lower by an overall mean of 3.0 mm Hg diastolic and 8.0 mm Hg systolic vs diltiazem SR used alone and 3.5 mm Hg diastolic and 4.0 mm Hg systolic vs hydrochlorothiazide used alone. At the largest doses used, 50% of patients achieved goal blood pressure while taking hydrochlorothiazide, 57% while taking diltiazem SR, and 75% while taking combination therapy. Combination therapy was well tolerated. This trial clearly demonstrates that diltiazem SR and hydrochlorothiazide have additive antihypertensive effects.\r"

Age and baseline plus on-trial lipid levels, blood pressure levels, and diet variables were included. Significant dietary energy sources were protein, carbohydrate, alcohol, total fat, and polyunsaturated fat. Each quartile of increased consumption of total fat and polyunsaturated fat was associated with a significant increase in risk of new lesions. Increased intake of lauric, oleic, and linoleic acids significantly increased risk. Subjects in the Cholesterol Lowering Atherosclerosis Study in whom new lesions did not develop increased dietary protein to compensate for reduced intake of fat by substituting low-fat meats and dairy products for high-fat meats and dairy products. These results indicate that when total and saturated fat intakes are reduced to levels recommended by the National Cholesterol Education Program, protein and carbohydrate are preferred substitutes for fat calories, rather than monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fat.\r"

Since some growth factors may play a role in extracellular matrix production, we examined the effects of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), interleukin 1, platelet derived growth factor, and tumor necrosis factor on the production of extracellular matrix components by cultured rat mesangial cells. In control experiments we found that mesangial cells produced two distinct proteoglycans identified as the small chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycans biglycan (PG I) and decorin (PG II) by showing that their mobility on SDS-PAGE changed upon digestion by chondroitinase ABC, and that they reacted with antibodies raised against synthetic peptides from the core protein sequence of human biglycan and decorin. Exposure to TGF-beta for 48 hours stimulated an 8- to 10-fold increase in the biglycan and decorin bands, and induced a structural change detected as a shift in electrophoretic mobility. TGF-beta did not demonstrably affect the production of other matrix proteins by the mesangial cells. The other growth factors tested had no comparable effect on the production of proteoglycans or other extracellular matrix components by these cells. Our results show that TGF-beta is unique among growth factors in its regulatory effects on mesangial cell proteoglycan production. The release or activation of TGF-beta during glomerular injury could mediate the accumulation of proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix and predispose the kidney to development of glomerulosclerosis.\r"

As indicators of C-activation the anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a) are problematical because of methodological difficulties and their kinetic properties. We developed a sensitive and specific micro-ELISA using a monoclonal antibody against neoantigens on the terminal complement complex (TCC); highly purified human TCC served as standard. Concentrations of TCC were measured in single-path perfusion systems (in vitro) and in the blood lines (arterial inlet; venous outlet) of patients on hemodialysis using steam-sterilized or ETO-sterilized dialyzers with the following membranes: cuprophan (CU), hemophan (HE) and polysulfone F6 (PS), respectively. All dialyzers with identical geometry were run under identical conditions. All membranes tested caused continuously ongoing net generation of TCC. In vitro, contact of serum with CU minidialyzers resulted in fivefold higher net release of TCC compared with HE and PS. In vivo TCC concentration-time profiles differed significantly between membranes in the rank order CU much much greater than HE greater than PS (mean basal concentration 58 x 10(-11) M; peak increase over baseline with CU 40-fold, HE fourfold, PS threefold). In addition, more TCC was generated from the same dialyzers with ETO than steam sterilization. TCC differed from C3a and C5a in the following respects: (i) lower detection limit (4 x 10(-11) vs. less than 5 x 10(-9) M for both C-anaphylatoxins); (ii) higher relative increment (inlet) during CU dialysis (25-fold vs. eightfold and twofold, respectively); (iii) C-anaphylatoxins yielded the same ranking (CU much greater than HE greater than PS), but TCC concentrations were not a linear function of C3a or C5a concentrations, respectively. Kinetic analysis (Bateman function) showed significant differences of invasion constants between membranes, that is, CU 0.088 min-1, HE 0.09, PS 0.168. The net amount of TCC released from the dialyzer was calculated under certain assumptions. It was 75.5 mg/4 hr for CU, 7.3 for HE and 5.0 for PS. The elimination constant was also dependent on the type of membrane. Using flow cytofluorometry and immunohistochemical methods (APAAP), TCC was demonstrated on membranes of granulocytes obtained during dialysis; this is compatible with potential in vivo cell activation. Generation of PGE2 and TNF alpha by adherent monocytes induced by cuprophan was C8 dependent: levels were significantly increased by addition of C8 to C8 deficient human serum concomitantly with generation of TCC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In renal cortical brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) isolated from cadmium treated rats, Na(+)-dependent D-glucose uptake was markedly attenuated, and this was due to reduction in Vmax and not Km. Likewise, Na(+)-driven L-glutamate transport and H(+)-driven tetraethylammonium transport were significantly reduced. In renal cortical basolateral membrane vesicles (BLMV) of cadmium intoxicated rats, Na(+)-dependent succinate transport was drastically reduced.

Blood was withdrawn continuously from healthy, non-uremic donors, heparinized, and pumped, single pass, through membrane modules under conditions which simulated normal dialysis conditions. The membrane modules contained membranes of cellulose, DEAE-substituted cellulose, or polysulfone. Blood was obtained from the module outlets for determination of complement activation, phagocyte elastase release, zymosan-induced phagocyte chemiluminescence, and monocyte interleukin-1 production. Significantly less complement activation occurred with the polysulfone and DEAE-substituted cellulose membranes than with cellulose membranes. Normal monocyte interleukin-1 production was not stimulated by any of the membranes used. In contrast, the cellulosic, but not the polysulfone, membranes primed the oxidative burst of the phagocytes and caused them to release elastase. DEAE-substituted cellulose had a lesser effect on elastase release than did cellulose and elastase release correlated significantly with the degree of complement activation. However, the correlation between complement activation and priming of phagocyte oxidative burst was weak, suggesting that membranes affect phagocyte oxidative metabolism through more than one mechanism. We conclude that some dialysis membranes stimulate the bacteriacidal functions of normal phagocytic cells, in part through complement-dependent mechanisms.\r"

To study the role of PT as accessory cells, we generated several murine PT-like epithelial cell lines by transformation with origin-defective SV40 DNA. These transformed cell lines display typical alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase enzyme activity, proliferation to epidermal growth factor (EGF) and sodium-dependent glucose uptake. Clonal lines of transformed tubular cells from both normal C3H/FeJ and autoimmune MRL-lpr mice do not constitutively express Ia antigens or mRNA for class II. However, stimulation with recombinant interferon-gamma(rIFN-gamma) induces Ia mRNA and surface product in the cell lines. These Ia-positive cells can process and present hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL) to antigen-specific Iak-restricted T cell hybrids. Unstimulated tubular cells do not express detectable IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, TNA-alpha, or IL-6 mRNA. However, stimulation with IL-1 alpha or LPS induces TNF-alpha transcripts. We conclude that these cell lines have characteristics most consistent with a proximal tubular origin. They also bear characteristics of accessory cells such as processing and presentation of antigen and TNF-alpha gene expression. We speculate that PT have the capacity to participate in the pathogenesis of immune renal injury.\r"

Sera from the remaining patients with clinically suspected WG (N = 5) or idiopathic CGN (N = 6) were negative for 29 kD-ANCA, but invariably positive for MPO-ANCA. Neither of these antibodies could be detected in sera from patients with CGN of infectious origin (N = 3), different forms of CGN (N = 7), other renal lesions (N = 34), or normal controls (N = 52). None of the sera tested were positive for elastase-ANCA. Our results indicate that both vasculitis-associated CGN and idiopathic CGN are associated with autoantibodies against myeloid lysosomal enzymes. This finding places these disorders within one spectrum of diseases.\r"

Urinary calcium excretion was examined in 215 patients with unexplained isolated hematuria (no proteinuria, urolithiasis, infection or systemic disorder). Hypercalciuria (urinary calcium excretion greater than 4 mg/kg/day) was identified in 76 patients (35%). Compared to patients with normal urinary calcium excretion, children with hematuria and hypercalciuria were characterized by male preponderance, white race, family history of urolithiasis, gross hematuria and calcium oxalate crystals. Renal biopsies were performed in 10 patients with urinary calcium excretion 0.4 to 2.5 mg/kg/day; three had IgA glomerulonephritis, three had glomerular basement membrane thinning, one had proliferative glomerulonephritis and three were normal. Renal biopsies in three patients with hypercalciuria showed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, hereditary nephritis or no abnormalities. Oral calcium loading tests showed renal hypercalciuria in 26 patients, absorptive hypercalciuria in 15 patients and were not diagnostic in 35 patients. Serum parathyroid hormone, bicarbonate and phosphorus and urinary cyclic adenosine monophosphate concentrations were similar in the three groups of hypercalciuric patients. Urinary calcium excretion after one week of dietary calcium restriction was higher (5.8 mg/kg/day) in renal hypercalciuria than in other hypercalciuric patients (3.4 mg/kg/day), P less than 0.01. One to four years follow-up was available for 184 patients. Eight of 60 hypercalciuric patients developed urolithiasis or renal colic compared to 2 of 124 patients with normal urinary calcium excretion (P less than 0.001). Hypercalciuria is commonly associated with isolated hematuria and represents a risk factor for future urolithiasis in children with hematuria.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The criterion of choice for computed tomographic scan identification of metastatic mediastinal nodes is not clearly fixed. This prospective study was designed to define the most suitable computed tomographic criterion for detection of nodal metastasis, enabling improvement of the test's clinical efficacy. One hundred twenty-three patients with potentially operable non-small cell lung cancer underwent mediastinal evaluation by computed tomographic scan and cervical mediastinoscopy followed by thoracotomy with mediastinal node dissection. There were 116 men and seven women; the mean age was 59.3 +/- 9.1 years. Forty-six tumors were classified after operation as stage I, 20 as stage II, 27 as stage IIIa, and 30 as stage IIIb. Mediastinal nodes were classified as metastatic according to the following computed tomographic scan criteria: (1) shorter axis 1 cm or larger; (2) shorter axis 1.5 cm or larger (nodes less than 1 cm were classified as negative and those 1 to 1.5 cm as indeterminate); and (3a) shorter axis 1 cm or larger, plus evidence of central necrosis or discontinued capsule, or (3b) shorter axis 2 cm or more, regardless of the nodal morphologic condition. The highest sensitivity rate was achieved by using criterion 1 (90%) and the poorest by criterion 3 (75%). The greatest specificity rate was obtained by applying criterion 3 (90%) and the lowest by criterion 1 (54%). The prediction by using computed tomographic criterion 3 correlated better with pathologic findings than that derived by adopting the criterion 1 or 2. When mediastinal nodes were identified as negative according to criterion 1, 2, or 3, the complete resection rate was 92%, 92%, or 95%, respectively, rendering cervical mediastinoscopy unnecessary. When mediastinal nodes were classified as positive, the resectability rate was 55%, 27%, or 13%, respectively. In these instances cervical mediastinoscopy allowed identification of different degrees of mediastinal involvement; it proved to be the most useful procedure for preoperative selection of those patients with N2 tumors who are amenable to a complete resection. In conclusion, the use of computed tomographic criterion 3 does improve the clinical efficacy of the test, by sparing a large number of unnecessary mediastinal explorations, without increasing the rate of useless thoracotomies.\r"

Expression of the antigen and sensitivity to the induction of cell death by anti-APO-1 were studied in human T-cell lines transformed by human leukaemia virus type 1 (HTLV-I) and in cultured cells from patients with adult T-cell leukaemia (ATL). APO-1 was strongly expressed on both types of cells and incubation of the cells with anti-APO-1 resulted in inhibition of proliferation and apoptosis.

The babies excreted 300-500 mg/day oligosaccharides and the mothers 500-800 mg/day. The effect of oligosaccharide fractions from a 500 ml pool of colostrum on bacterial adhesion to uroepithelial cells was tested on a strain of Escherichia coli isolated from an infant with urinary tract infection. The high-molecular-weight sialylated oligosaccharides had no effect but neutral oligosaccharides caused inhibition of bacterial adhesion which rose as the size of the oligosaccharides decreased. These findings suggest that breastfeeding may have a preventive effect on urinary tract infection in both mother and infant.\r"

Theoretically, an oxygen-carrying perfluorocarbon emulsion combined with oxygen inhalation might be able to increase tumor response by decreasing the relative proportion of hypoxic tumor cells. Twenty-one patients with advanced head and neck malignancies receiving primary radiation therapy were evaluated for treatment-related toxicity. Mucosal reactions and weight loss during treatment in the group of patients who received the perfluorocarbon emulsion and the group who did not were comparable. Late sequelae appeared comparable. No patient in either group who completed radiation therapy required an interruption of the treatment course. We conclude that Fluosol-DA 20% is a tolerated adjunct to primary radiation therapy. Further study is needed to determine whether the agent will improve local/regional tumor control.\r"

Of 47 personnel with laryngitis, 46 were smokers (P less than .01). In regard to asbestos exposure, 20% of the high-risk group had laryngitis, compared to 11% in the low-risk group (P less than .05). The data were compared to a previously prepared longitudinal study of plant personnel (2057 individuals and 37,361.5 person years), where three cases of laryngeal cancer had been observed (0.77 expected). As these cases involved smokers with limited asbestos exposure, neither the longitudinal or cross-sectional data could support asbestos as an etiologic factor for laryngeal cancer, but it may act as an irritant.\r"

  ".W": "An awareness of the health-related benefits of regular physical activity, prudent diet, and cessation of cigarette smoking are some of the mechanisms by which risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) and the incidence of complications of atherosclerosis have declined in the American population. Exercise training is associated with improvements in lipid and glucose metabolism that are manifested by enhanced insulin sensitivity, improved glucose tolerance, increased high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, reduced triglyceride and low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and reductions in blood pressure. In addition to reduced risk factors for atherosclerosis, physically conditioned individuals have better cardiovascular function at rest and during exercise than their inactive peers. Thus, exercising training reduces morbidity and mortality from atherosclerotic complications through both direct (cardiovascular) and indirect (risk factor modification) mechanisms. Many studies demonstrate a strong association between regular physical activity and reduced risk for CHD. This article provides a review of risk factors for CHD and the potential health benefits of aerobic and resistive exercise. The time seems apt for the institution of multifactorial cardiovascular risk prevention programs in which aerobic and resistive exercise are combined with prudent diet therapy and smoking cessation to reduce risk factors for CHD.\r"

  ".U": "90173775\r", 
  ".W": "A recent surge of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies dealing with resistive training and lipid profiles have produced conflicting results. The majority of cross-sectional studies demonstrate a reduced HDL cholesterol level or elevated total cholesterol to HDL ratio in strength trained athletes as compared with endurance trained athletes. Because of selection biases from many of these studies, there is a lack of control for factors that may influence lipids and lipoproteins, such as age, body composition, diet, and anabolic-androgenic steroid use. Most investigators have reported improved lipoprotein-lipid profiles from resistive training programs. However, many of these studies have design flaws or limitations that make their conclusions questionable. The most serious design flaws include the combination of no control group and only one blood sample taken before and after training, the use of subjects who have low risk profiles, and the lack of control for dietary effects. In a recent study in which we attempted to control for these factors, no changes in lipid profiles were observed after 20 wk of resistive training among individuals at risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). A group serving as reference controls who participated in aerobic-type exercise training during the same time period reduced their plasma triglyceride levels but did not alter their cholesterol or lipoprotein levels. No changes in any lipids or lipoproteins were observed in a group of inactive controls. Thus, resistive training does not appear to alter lipoprotein-lipid profiles among individuals at risk for CHD.\r"

  ".U": "90173776\r", 
  ".W": "Although several studies have evaluated the effects of endurance training on left ventricular (LV) function, few studies have looked at resistive training effects. Acute isometric exercise increases blood pressure and has little effect on LV function, causing only mild increases in ejection fraction and stroke volume index. However, acute isometric exercise does increase LV diastolic diameter to a lesser extent than dynamic exercise. Most studies of resistive training on LV function have been cross-sectional or short term (10 to 12 wk) training studies on athletes and suggest that increases in LV wall thickness and mass are dependent upon the intensity and duration of training. Most resistive training studies show no increase in left ventricular volume, as can be seen in endurance trained athletes. Despite the increase in LV mass with resistive training, indices of LV systolic and diastolic function do not change. In hypertensive and cardiac patients with normal LV function at rest, resistive training increases LV mass index without deleterious effects on LV systolic and diastolic function. However, in patients with abnormal resting LV function, resistive training can have adverse effects on LV systolic function. Overall, moderate levels of resistive training can be a useful adjunct to cardiac rehabilitation programs, with the caveat that it be used with caution in patients with abnormal LV function at rest.\r"

  ".W": "Although fluoride increases bone mass, the newly formed bone may have reduced strength. To assess the effect of fluoride treatment on the fracture rate in osteoporosis, we conducted a four-year prospective clinical trial in 202 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and vertebral fractures who were randomly assigned to receive sodium fluoride (75 mg per day) or placebo. All received a calcium supplement (1500 mg per day). Sixty-six women in the fluoride group and 69 women in the placebo group completed the trial. As compared with the placebo group, the treatment group had increases in median bone mineral density of 35 percent (P less than 0.0001) in the lumbar spine (predominantly cancellous bone), 12 percent (P less than 0.0001) in the femoral neck, and 10 percent (P less than 0.0001) in the femoral trochanter (sites of mixed cortical and cancellous bone), but the bone mineral density decreased by 4 percent (P less than 0.02) in the shaft of the radius (predominantly cortical bone). The number of new vertebral fractures was similar in the treatment and placebo groups (163 and 136, respectively; P not significant), but the number of nonvertebral fractures was higher in the treatment group (72 vs. 24; P less than 0.01). Fifty-four women in the fluoride group and 24 in the placebo group had side effects sufficiently severe to warrant dose reduction; the major side effects were gastrointestinal symptoms and lower-extremity pain. We conclude that fluoride therapy increases cancellous but decreases cortical bone mineral density and increases skeletal fragility. Thus, under the conditions of this study, the fluoride-calcium regimen was not effective treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis.\r"

The median time to the first episode of emesis was 2.8 hours in the placebo group and 11.6 hours in the ondansetron group (P less than 0.001); the median number of episodes in 24 hours was 5.5 in the placebo group and 1.5 in the ondansetron group (P less than 0.001); the mean (+/- SEM) number of regurgitations or dry heaves per episode was 3.2 +/- 0.5 in the placebo group and 1.17 +/- 0.1 in the ondansetron group (P less than 0.001). None of the 14 patients given ondansetron, but 12 of 14 given placebo, required treatment with antiemetic-rescue agents for the control of nausea and vomiting. There were no adverse effects attributable to ondansetron. The urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, the main metabolite of serotonin, was increased in all patients two to six hours after they received cisplatin chemotherapy, and the increases paralleled the episodes of emesis. We conclude that ondansetron is an effective and safe agent for controlling the nausea and vomiting induced by cisplatin treatment. We suggest that cisplatin treatment increases the release of serotonin from enterochromaffin cells, and that ondansetron acts by blocking S3 receptors for serotonin.\r"

  ".W": "Atrial fibrillation, even in the absence of rheumatic valvular disease, predisposes patients to embolic complications, but the role of antithrombotic therapy in the prevention of such complications has not been fully clarified. We therefore performed a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate warfarin and aspirin individually as prophylaxis against ischemic stroke and systemic embolism (the primary events) in such patients. Patients eligible to receive warfarin (group 1) were assigned to warfarin (open label), aspirin (325 mg per day), or placebo (aspirin and placebo were given in a doubleblind fashion). Those who were not eligible for warfarin (group 2) received either aspirin or placebo in a double-blind fashion. The placebo arm of group 1 was recently terminated, when evidence emerged that each active agent was superior to placebo. In this paper we report preliminary data on active therapy (with either warfarin or aspirin) as compared with placebo in group 1, and on aspirin as compared with placebo in groups 1 and 2 combined. By November 1989, 1244 patients had been followed for a mean of 1.13 years. The event rates were 1.6 percent per year in the 393 patients who made up the two active treatment arms (warfarin and aspirin) of group 1, and 8.3 percent per year in the 195 patients who made up the placebo arm (P less than 0.00005) (risk reduction, 81 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 56 to 91). In all 517 patients given aspirin, the rate of primary events (3.2 percent per year) was lower than that in the 528 patients given placebo (6.3 percent per year; P = 0.014) (risk reduction, 49 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 15 to 69). However, we were unable to show a benefit of aspirin in patients over 75 years of age. These preliminary data indicate that antithrombotic therapy with warfarin or aspirin is effective in the short term in reducing the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation due to causes other than rheumatic valvular disease. The relative benefits of aspirin and warfarin remain unclear, and the trial is continuing in order to address this issue.\r"

This hypothesis therefore challenges the fundamental tenet that mutations occur spontaneously, irrespective of effects on the organism's fitness. One purported case of directed mutation is the excision of a Mu sequence from Escherichia coli strain MCS2 in minimal lactose-arabinose medium. Here, we show that this case can be more simply explained by an accelerated rate of excision mutation in response to non-specific physiological stresses of starvation and by slight growth of MCS2 on minimal lactose-arabinose medium.\r"

The technique of transcranial Doppler ultrasound, however, allows continuous measurement of blood velocity in the middle cerebral artery as the carotid artery is narrowed, so that hemodynamic effects and development of collateral flow can be immediately assessed at the bedside at each adjustment of the carotid artery diameter. This case report describes the use of transcranial Doppler to guide the rate of carotid occlusion in a patient with an unclippable giant aneurysm of the carotid artery. Sudden carotid occlusion and gradual occlusion at the usual rate were not tolerated by the patient, but repeatedly tightening the clamp until the first signs of attenuation of the Doppler signal allowed an expedient occlusion without complication. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound can provide a useful dynamic guide to gradual therapeutic carotid occlusion.\r"

Thirty-nine of 50 of the first American neurosurgeons were the first authors of 411 research papers, which were studied by analysis of citations between 1965 and 1979. Of all papers written by these authors between 1896 and 1976, 11% concerned research; this category received 22% of the aggregate of citations. The five research areas that received the largest number of citations were brain tumors (745), central nervous system physiology (279), experimental hydrocephalus (232), increased intracranial pressure (222), and head injury (107). Solutions to these problems were resolved with varying degrees of success. Interest in brain tumor research was reflected by the use of special staining techniques in 30% of these papers. Seventy percent of neurosurgical research papers appeared in clinical journals. The Archives of Neurology and Psychiatry had the largest number of papers and of total citations for journals. The paper cited most often was Dandy's, \"Internal Hydrocephalus: An Experimental, Clinical, and Pathological Study.\" Cushing and Penfield each wrote 3 of the 10 most cited research papers. The most productive research authors were also most often cited. They included Bailey (441), Cushing (431), Penfield (423), Dandy (246), and Davis (158). Among the 50 authors, the percentage of published research papers did not separate the neurosurgeon with laboratory experience from his clinically oriented counterpart with regard to productivity and creativity. The data suggest that neurosurgeons are generally not basic scientists but clinical investigators.\r"

These options on occasion will become complementary in the management of individual patients. Those children surviving Fontan operations are frequently able to lead NYHA Class I or II lives without drugs, while transplant recipients will require one or more immunoregulative medications indefinitely. Exercise tolerance and work capacity following the Fontan procedure are reported to be 40 to 60 per cent of expected normals. Full functional capacity of successfully palliated children may never be normal. In contrast, exercise capability after heart transplantation is generally better than that following a Fontan operation, with cardiac ejection fractions approaching normal for age. Durability of these new management technologies will make inappropriate the traditional \"do nothing\" approach to HLHS in all but a few cases.\r"

Cyanosis may vary from mild to severe, and patients may present as newborns or, more commonly, young infants. Infants with classic tetralogy of Fallot and stable anatomy should undergo primary complete intracardiac repair. The overall hospital mortality is approximately 3 to 5 per cent, with most patients who survive having an excellent clinical and hemodynamic result.\r"

  ".W": "Catheter therapy has gained an important role in the treatment of congenital heart disease. The cumulative experience with vascular and valvular balloon dilations has demonstrated low mortality and morbidity with short-term results similar to surgery. Currently, balloon dilation is an accepted treatment for valvular pulmonary stenosis, distal pulmonary artery stenosis, recurrent coarctation, rheumatic mitral stenosis, congenital valvular aortic stenosis, and intra-atrial baffle obstruction. Except for patients at high surgical risk, balloon dilation of native coarctation is considered investigational at most institutions but accepted at others. No conclusive evaluation is yet possible for dilation of bioprosthetic valves and membranous subaortic stenosis. Individual pulmonary veins appear undilatable. Various devices are available for closure of extra- and intracardiac communications. Transcatheter closure of aortopulmonary collaterals and arteriovenous malformations is now well established at some centers. In selected patients, therapeutic embolization of surgical shunts can replace surgery. Transcatheter closure of the patent ductus arteriosus has become routine at some centers. Nonsurgical closure of atrial and ventricular septal defects has entered clinical trials, and preliminary results appear very promising. Blade atrioseptostomy and foreign body retrieval are well established. Improvement of existing procedures and implementation of new concepts will consolidate the role of catheter therapy in congenital and acquired heart disease.\r"

  ".W": "Congenital heart disease occurs in approximately 1 per cent of liveborn children, but in a much higher percentage of those aborted spontaneously or stillborn. To detect as many as possible with CHD, including those with mild lesions, very intensive studies are needed. Studies that are not so intensive, especially those done before modern diagnostic techniques were in general use, considerably underestimated the incidence of CHD in liveborn children. It appears that the incidence of CHD and of the various individual lesions does not differ in different countries or at different times, providing the ascertainment of CHD is complete and accurate. The commonest form of CHD is the ventricular septal defect, which occurs in 30 to 40 per cent of all children with CHD. The risks of recurrence in siblings and of transmission to future generations depends on the exact mode of inheritance involved. Approximately 5 to 8 per cent of CHD is due to gross chromosomal abnormalities, and the recurrence risk is that of the chromosomal derangement itself. Because many children with these chromosomal lesions die in infancy or have reduced fertility, the risk to future generations is relatively low. About 3 per cent of CHD is due to classical Mendelian gene effects, with correspondingly high recurrence risks in first-degree relatives. Most CHD has lower risks of recurrence and transmission than those predicted by Mendelian single-gene action. The popular explanation for their inheritance has been the interaction of polygenic effects and the environment, but recent studies of the recurrence and transmission risks of various forms of CHD do not fit this model well. The alternative model is a single gene defect modulated by random events. The recurrence risks for future siblings are 2 to 6 per cent, and for offspring are 1 to 10 per cent, but in a few families the recurrence and transmission risks may be much higher.\r"

Its practitioners are from disciplines such as genetics, obstetrics, and pediatrics, the common interests of which in the well-being of the unborn child have converged as technologic advances in ultrasound have enabled detailed evaluation and sometimes treatment of fetal hemodynamic abnormalities. Each discipline forms an entry point for the identification and referral of the high-risk patient or fetus with a suspected abnormality. As has been shown obstetric cardiac screening of the general population with ultrasound provides the highest yield of cardiac malformations when suspicious findings are referred to a subspecialist in fetal cardiac sonography. As we study the pathogenesis of congenital defects, it is likely that hitherto unidentified high risk populations will be found. The future holds the possibility of meaningful surgical interventions that may change the dismal outcome of fetuses with certain, now lethal cardiac malformations. Patients with hydrops fetalis due to congenital complete heart block are almost certain to die. Intrauterine cardiac pacing has been attempted and is a potentially life-saving procedure. Patients in whom pulmonary underdevelopment occurs because of the cardiac enlargement associated with some types of pulmonary atresia could potentially benefit from intrauterine surgery such as valvotomy. Serial fetal echocardiographic examination of the developing heart with higher resolution equipment during the first trimester may one day pinpoint the exact moment of teratogenesis and lead to more specific treatments designed to restore normal embryogenesis. Such examinations will, when known to be safe themselves, at the very least significantly advance our knowledge of normal cardiac embryogenesis and pathogenesis.\r"

There was a very high mortality in children with a prolonged illness, severe roentgenogram changes, cyanosis, leukocytosis, hepatomegaly or inability to feed, and there was a trend toward a higher mortality in children with grunting or severe chest indrawing. Afebrile malnourished children had a particularly high mortality, but afebrile children had an increased mortality only if they were malnourished, and malnourished children had an increased mortality only if they were afebrile. Mortality was not increased in very young children or in children with tachypnea or tachycardia. The World Health Organization has suggested that most children with pneumonia in developing countries can be treated with penicillin but has recommended that children who are cyanotic or too sick to feed be treated with chloramphenicol because of their high risk of dying; our findings confirm that children who are cyanotic or too sick to feed have a very high risk of dying from pneumonia.\r"

Compared with culture the sensitivity of the EIA was 95% and specificity was 92%; the specificity increased to 97% with a blocking assay. Compared with immunofluorescence the sensitivity of EIA was 92% and specificity was 93%. In order to assess the performance of TESTPACK RSV as a bedside test, nasopharyngeal swabs from 49 children were tested by EIA at the bedside by housestaff and by immunofluorescence in the laboratory; the sensitivity of the EIA was lower (78%) while specificity remained high (95%). Inclusion of older children may have resulted in diminished sensitivity. The TESTPACK RSV is a simple, rapid test that performs well and is easily adaptable to an office setting. Further evaluation of the test in older children may be required.\r"

We report a case of fulminant PMC in an otherwise normal 2 1/2-year-old child after antibiotic therapy given for a routine childhood illness. The patient had debilitating colitis marked by severe diarrhea, a generalized electrolyte derangement, an extreme protein-losing enteropathy state, rectal prolapse, ascites, pleural effusion, varicella and multiple relapses. The child required specific antimicrobial therapy as well as aggressive supportive care to achieve recovery. A review of the literature for pediatric cases of PMC revealed reported cases in all age groups; the youngest was 5 days old. There were 9 deaths in 43 cases for a mortality rate of about 20%. All but 2 of the cases were associated with antibiotic therapy. The antibiotics most frequently implicated were ampicillin (15), penicillin (11), cephalosporins (7), amoxicillin (6) and clindamycin (5). The onset of symptoms of PMC can begin at any time while the child is taking an antibiotic or up to 21 days after it is discontinued. Children with underlying gastrointestinal motility disorders such as Hirschsprung's disease are predisposed to PMC. Fulminant PMC is a serious but uncommon infectious disease of infancy and childhood, occurring as a complication of routine antibiotic therapy for common childhood illnesses.\r"

The method removes from wild-type DNA the sequences that are present in both the wild-type and the deletion mutant genomes. The DNA that corresponds to the deleted region remains. Enrichment for the deleted sequences is achieved by allowing a mixture of denatured wild-type and biotinylated mutant DNA to reassociate. After reassociation, the biotinylated sequences are removed by binding to avidin-coated beads. This subtraction process is then repeated several times. In each cycle we hybridize the unbound wild-type DNA from the previous round with fresh biotinylated deletion mutant DNA. The unbound DNA from the final cycle is ligated to adaptors and amplified by using one strand of the adaptor as a primer in the polymerase chain reaction. The amplified sequences can then be used to probe a genomic library. We applied genomic subtraction to a yeast strain that has a 5-kilobase deletion, corresponding to 1/4000th of the genome. In the experiment reported here, three rounds of subtraction were sufficient to accurately identify genomic clones containing sequences that are missing in the deletion mutant. We discuss the limitations and some potential applications of the method.\r"

None of the tryptophan residues is critical for activity, as evidenced by the finding that the mutant permease molecules catalyze lactose/H+ symport almost as well as wild-type permease. Subsequently, a permease molecule was designed in which all of the tryptophan residues were replaced with phenylalanine. Remarkably, the lac permease harboring all six mutations catalyzes active lactose transport about 75% as well as wild-type permease. The fluorescence emission spectrum of purified wild-type permease solubilized in octyl beta-D-glucopyranoside and phospholipid exhibits a broad maximum centered at 350 nm, and the peak is almost completely absent from the spectrum of permease devoid of tryptophan. Furthermore, a new maximum centered at about 306 nm is apparent in the spectrum of the modified permease, suggesting that tyrosine fluorescence in the native protein is quenched by internal energy transfer to tryptophan residues. By using site-directed mutagenesis to replace specified residues in the molecule without tryptophan, it should now be possible to utilize tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy to study static and dynamic aspects of permease structure and function.\r"

Four such hammerheads that contained identical catalytic core sequences but differed in the base composition of the helices that are involved in substrate binding had been reported to vary in cleavage rates by more than 70-fold under similar reaction conditions. Steady-state kinetic analyses reveal that kcat values are nearly the same for these hammerheads but Km values vary nearly 60-fold. The substrates for reactions having high Km values form aggregates that are virtually nonreactive. These observations demonstrate that the secondary structure of substrate RNA can be a major determinant of hammerhead catalytic efficiency.\r"

A 32-base-pair (bp) DNA fragment of the lac promoter containing the primary binding site for Escherichia coli cAMP receptor protein (CRP) was chemically synthesized and labeled specifically at the 5' end with fluorescent probe. Binding of cAMP receptor protein to this fragment can be conveniently followed by measuring changes in polarization of fluorescence of the labeled DNA or by measuring fluorescence energy transfer from protein tryptophan residues to the DNA label. Formation of protein-DNA complex was monitored as a function of cAMP concentration. Various equilibrium constants can be resolved to characterize the binding of cAMP to CRP and the subsequent binding of CRP-cAMP and CRP-(cAMP)2 to DNA. These binding studies showed that the two ligated forms of CRP have significantly different affinities for specific-site DNA. These results show that, in principle, the fluorescence technique can yield thermodynamically valid equilibrium constants under essentially any solution conditions. This technique also has the potential of providing information regarding the structure of protein-DNA complexes.\r"

  ".W": "Heymann nephritis is an experimental autoimmune disease in rats that is characterized by accumulation of immune deposits (IDs) in kidney glomeruli. The disease is initiated by the binding of circulating antibodies to a membrane glycoprotein, gp330, which is a resident protein of clathrin-coated pits on glomerular epithelial cells (podocytes). We have defined a domain representing about 10% of gp330 that appears to be responsible for the formation of stable glomerular IDs. A cDNA clone (clone 14) was isolated from a rat kidney cDNA expression library by screening with IgG eluted from glomeruli of rats in early stages (3 days) of passive Heymann nephritis. The clone 14 cDNA contains an open reading frame encoding the C-terminal 319 amino acids of gp330. The predicted amino acid sequence contains four internal repeats of 11 amino acids, which are also found in the putative ligand-binding region of carbohydrate-binding lectin-like receptors. An antibody raised against the clone 14 fusion protein recognized gp330 by immunoblotting and induced formation of subepithelial IDs typical of passive Heymann nephritis when injected into normal rats. When the clone 14 fusion protein was used to immunize rats, subepithelial IDs of active Heymann nephritis were found after 12 weeks. No IDs were formed by active or passive immunization of rats with fusion proteins derived from other regions of gp330. These results demonstrate that clone 14 encodes a region of gp330 responsible for antibody binding and ID formation in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "90175393\r", 
  ".W": "Polymerization of the deoxy form of sickle cell hemoglobin (Hb S; beta 6 Glu----Val) involves both hydrophobic and electrostatic intermolecular contacts. These interactions drive the mutated molecules into long fibrous rods composed of seven pairs of strands. X-ray crystallography of Hb S and electron microscopy image reconstruction of the fibers have revealed the remarkable complementarity between one of the beta 6 valines of each molecule (the donor site) and an acceptor site at the EF corner of a neighboring tetramer. This interaction constitutes the major lateral contact between the two strands in a pair. To estimate the relative importance of this key hydrophobic contact in polymer formation we have generated a polymerizing Hb with isoleucine at the beta 6 position (beta E6I) by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutated beta chains were produced in Escherichia coli and reassembled into functional tetramers with native alpha chains. Compared to native Hb S, the beta E6I mutant polymerizes faster and with a shortened delay time in 1.8 M phosphate buffer, indicating an increased stability of the nuclei preceding fiber growth. The solubility of the beta E6I mutant Hb is half that of native Hb S. Computer modeling of the donor-acceptor interaction shows that the presence of an isoleucine side chain at the donor site induces increased contacts with the receptor site and an increased buried surface area, in agreement with the higher hydrophobicity of the isoleucine residue. The agreement between the predicted and experimental differences in solubility suggests that the transfer of the beta 6 valine or isoleucine side chain from water to a hydrophobic environment is sufficient to explain the observations.\r"

  ".U": "90175400\r", 
  ".W": "Human placental ribonuclease inhibitor (PRI) is a potent protein inhibitor of pancreatic ribonucleases and the homologous blood vessel-inducing protein angiogenin. Although inhibition by PRI occurs with a 1:1 stoichiometry, its primary structure is composed predominantly of seven internal leucine-rich repeats. These internal repeats were systematically deleted either singly or in combination by \"modular\" mutagenesis. Deletion of repeat units 3 plus 4 or repeat unit 6 results in mutants that both bind to and inhibit ribonuclease A. Therefore, the angiogenin/ribonuclease binding site in PRI must reside primarily or entirely in repeats 1, 2, 5, or 7, the short N- or C-terminal segments, or a combination of these. Deletion of repeat units 3-5, 5-6, or 5 alone results in mutants that exhibit only binding activity. Hence, the binding site cannot reside exclusively in repeat 5. Other internal deletions or N- or C-terminal deletions of 6-86% of the protein all abolish activity. These results suggest that PRI has a modular structure, with one primary structural repeat constituting one module. The approach taken may be applicable to other proteins with repeat structures.\r"

  ".W": "The early stages of hematopoiesis have been difficult to study due to problems in obtaining homogeneous populations of progenitor cells that retain both self-renewal and differentiative capacities. We have developed an in vitro system in which transformation of murine bone-marrow cells with the BCR/ABL oncogene, a gene associated with stem-cell leukemias, leads to the outgrowth of clonal lines that have an early lymphoid progenitor cell phenotype. The progenitor cells retain immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes in a germ-line configuration. These cells give rise in vitro to pre-B cells that have diverse diversity-joining (D-J) region rearrangements, and on transfer to mice with severe combined immune deficiency, differentiate to surface IgM+, immunoglobulin-secreting B cells that respond to T-cell help and function in an antigen-specific fashion. Although their growth is stimulated by BCR/ABL, the progenitor cells depend for continued growth on a stromal cell-derived soluble factor distinct from the pre-B-cell growth factor, interleukin 7. These findings show that BCR/ABL can promote proliferation of an early hematopoietic progenitor cell without preventing its differentiation. This system provides a means of studying the complete B-cell developmental process from clonal progenitor cell to end-stage plasma cell.\r"

In the crude homogenate, the predominant activity of this potential renin-processing enzyme (RPE) converted the Mr 47,000 inactive prorenin to Mr 44,000 active renin and had a pH optimum of approximately 6. The activity was blocked by cysteine protease inhibitors, but not by pepstatin, EDTA, or serine protease inhibitors. This RPE activity was not detected in a similarly prepared homogenate of human chorion decidua tissue, which produces primarily prorenin, or in human plasma. The activity was purified 100-fold by ammonium sulfate precipitation, p-chloromercuribenzoate affinity chromatography, and chromatofocusing. The partially purified enzyme has a Mr of approximately 27,000 and an isoelectric point in the pH 4.8-5.6 range. The activity in the purified RPE preparation had the same pH optimum as that in crude homogenate, cleaved the prosegment at the same site used by the kidney in vivo based on amino-terminal sequencing of the processed renin, and did not degrade prorenin or renin. These data suggest that the cysteine protease we have isolated is a candidate for authentic renal RPE.\r"

The method, expression-cassette polymerase chain reaction (ECPCR), allows the insertion of virtually any contiguous coding sequence between sequences that direct high-level protein biosynthesis in E. coli. The gene expression cassettes obtained by ECPCR are inserted into a regulated overexpression plasmid, and the resulting construct is used to transform E. coli. By effecting simultaneous 5' and 3' modification of a coding sequence, ECPCR permits the facile generation of mutant proteins having N- and/or C-terminal truncations. The method is a highly efficient way to dissect a multidomain protein into its component domains. The efficiency of the ECPCR approach is demonstrated in this study by construction of permuted overexpression vectors for the first two extracellular domains of the human CD4 protein.\r"

The RNA chain is modeled using pseudoatoms at different levels of detail--from a single pseudoatom per helix to a single pseudoatom for each nucleotide. A stepwise procedure is used, starting with a simple representation of the macromolecule that is refined and then extrapolated into higher resolution for further refinement. The procedure is capable of folding different random-walk chains by using energy minimization, allowing generation of a range of conformations consistent with given experimental data. We use this procedure to generate several possible conformations of the 16S RNA in the 30S ribosomal subunit of Escherichia coli by using secondary structure and the neutron-scattering map of the 21 proteins in the small subunit. The RNA chain is modeled using a single pseudoatom per helix. RNA-RNA and RNA-protein crosslinks, reported in current literature, are included in our model. Footprinting data for different ribosomal proteins in the 16S RNA are also used. Several conformations of the 16S RNA are generated and compared to predict gross structural features of the 30S subunit as well as to identify regions of the 16S RNA that cannot be well-defined with current experimental data.\r"

  ".W": "There is little information regarding the molecular mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis. We studied the p53 gene at the DNA, RNA, and protein level in seven human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-derived cell lines; six of seven showed p53 abnormalities. By Southern blotting, the p53 gene was found to be partially deleted in Hep 3B and rearranged in SK-HEP-1 cells. Transcripts of the p53 gene were undetectable in Hep 3B as well as in FOCUS cells that had no apparent deletion or rearrangement of the p53 gene. Immunoprecipitation after [35S]methionine labeling of HCC cells demonstrated that p53 protein was absent in Hep 3B and FOCUS and reduced in concentration in PLC/PRF/5 cells. p53 synthesized by Mahlavu cells showed a slower migration on SDS/polyacrylamide gels suggesting it was an abnormal protein. In Huh7 cells, p53 protein had a prolonged half-life leading to its accumulation in the nuclei; increased levels of p53 protein were also found by immunoblotting. The p53 gene and its expression appeared to be unaltered in the hepatoblastoma-derived Hep G2 cell line. We found that the loss of p53 expression did not occur as a late in vitro event in the FOCUS cell line because p53 protein was also nondetectable at an early passage. We conclude that the loss of p53 expression or the presence of abnormal forms of the protein are frequently associated with HCC cell lines. These observations suggest that alterations in p53 may be important events in the transformation of hepatocytes to the malignant phenotype.\r"

The widespread availability of high signal-to-noise knee coils has made routine imaging with T2-weighted sequences in both coronal and sagittal planes possible in 30 minutes. The spin-echo sequence remains the most important imaging technique, although many newer sequences have also been applied to the knee, with varying degrees of success. Important pitfalls in diagnosis, such as high signal intensity in the posterior horn of the medial meniscus and the transverse meniscal ligament, displaced buckethandle meniscal tears, and discoid menisci, can be recognized with experience. Common clinical problems that are encountered include meniscal cysts, osteonecrosis, and bone bruises. Detection of subtle injuries of the medial collateral ligament, patellar tendon, and anterior cruciate ligament requires careful observation. Intra-articular loose bodies can be reliably detected with MR imaging, and it should be recognized that localized pigmented villonodular synovitis can sometimes simulate the appearance of a loose body. MR imaging is a valuable noninvasive procedure that is complementary to arthroscopy in the evaluation of diseases of the knee.\r"

  ".W": "Fractures and dislocations about the ankle joint are common injuries. The radiographic findings produced by these injuries are type-specific--that is, directly related to the mechanism that produced the injury. It is important for radiologists to recognize all of the aspects of a particular injury and to communicate this information to the orthopedic surgeon because treatment is predicated upon recognition of all the components of the injury. Treatment also depends upon restoration of anatomic contour to the articular surface of the ankle joint as well as to reestablishment of stability. Plain films, polydirectional tomography, CT, and MR imaging are useful for evaluating these abnormalities.\r"

  ".W": "Minor trauma to the foot may cause stress fracture, avulsion fracture or ligamentous and tendon injury. Plain radiographs are frequently normal. Radionuclide bone scan is a sensitive detector of early bone injury. A stress fracture may develop focal uptake or diffuse uptake throughout the bone involved. MR imaging is the most sensitive means of evaluating injury to the soft tissues. Acute edema, partial tear, complete tear, and chronic tendinitis have distinct features on T1- and T2-weighted images. Major trauma occurs most commonly as a result of falls from heights and from motor-vehicle accidents. Plain films are useful in the initial evaluation of the extent of trauma. CT is particularly useful in evaluating calcaneal fractures that involve the subtalar joint. Both MR imaging and CT scans are useful in detecting injured or entrapped tendons associated with fracture-dislocations.\r"

The specific location and severity of an athletic injury depend on the activity or exercise, the age of the patient, and the enthusiasm and determination of the athlete. The denial of pain can result in chronic disability, extensive surgical repair, and eventual degenerative arthritis.\r"
