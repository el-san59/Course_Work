  ".W": "Since more and more women in developed countries are delaying childbearing to an older age, it is important to find out whether birth defects, other than those resulting from chromosomal anomalies, are related to maternal age. We have studied all 26,859 children with birth defects of unknown aetiology identified among 576,815 consecutive livebirths in British Columbia. All these cases' records were linked with provincial birth records to allow determination of maternal age at birth. We excluded children with chromosomal anomalies and those with other birth defects of known aetiology. Only 3 of the 43 birth defect categories studied showed significant maternal-age-specific trends: there were decreasing linear trends with maternal age for patent ductus arteriosus (chi 2 = 36.65, 1 df, p less than 0.01) and hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (chi 2 = 4.90, 1 df, p less than 0.05) and a bell-shaped curve (risk increasing to maternal age 30 then falling) for congenital dislocatable hip/hip click. The findings from this population-based analysis of no association between the incidence of birth defects of unknown aetiology and advancing maternal age should be reassuring to healthy women who opt to delay childbearing.\r"

  ".U": "91155524\r", 
  ".W": "Previous ecological studies have suggested that early life factors are important causes of adult cardiovascular and respiratory disease, by showing geographic correlations between past infant mortality rates and present adult mortality rates. However, these studies inadequately take account of the fact that areas which were severely deprived earlier this century remain the most deprived today. Thus the ecological relation between infant and adult mortality rates could simply reflect persistence in the geographic distribution of poor socioeconomic circumstances. To explore this hypothesis further infant mortality rates for 1895-1908 for 43 counties in England and Wales were correlated with cause-specific adult mortality for 1969-73 in people aged 65-74 years, with and without adjustment for present-day social deprivation and social class. The strong simple correlations found between infant mortality in 1895-1908 and adult mortality from various causes in 1969-73 were generally much attenuated or abolished by controlling for indices of present-day socioeconomic circumstances. Our results suggest that previous studies give no strong support for any direct influence of factors acting in early life on adult coronary heart disease mortality risk. Studies which gather data about infancy, childhood, and the full course of adult life are required to clarify this issue.\r"

The frequency, duration, and titre of virus isolation from the vaccination site and occurrence of local side-effects were similar between the two groups of vaccinees. Vaccinia-naive (vac-n) subjects shed virus from the vaccination site for longer and at a higher titre than did vaccinia-primed (vac-p) individuals (19 vs 7 days and 10(7) vs 10(5) pfu/ml, respectively). In-vitro T-cell proliferative responses to one or more HIV antigen preparations developed in 13 of 16 vaccinia-primed subjects inoculated with HIVAC-1e. T-cell responses were, however, transient and in no subject did antibodies to HIV become detectable. The 2 vaccinia-naive subjects vaccinated with HIVAC-1e showed strong T-cell responses to homologous and heterologous strains of whole virus and to recombinant gp160 protein that remained detectable for over a year; antibodies to HIV envelope also developed in both. Recombinant vaccinia virus vaccines induce T-cell priming to the foreign gene products in most individuals. If used as the sole immunising agent they will be most efficacious in vaccinia-naive individuals.\r"

In all cases pressure was above normal (mean [SD]22.6 [7.4] cm CSF, range 10.5-36). Clinical features of our patients suggest that intracranial hypertension is important in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria in children, especially as a cause of death. We suggest that raised intracranial pressure is secondary to increased cerebral blood volume. Lowering intracranial pressure may significantly reduce the mortality and morbidity of cerebral malaria. The potential risks and benefits of lumbar puncture should be considered carefully in patients with suspected cerebral malaria.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of the study was to find out whether asthma patients whose airways obstruction is sensitive (CS) or resistant (CR) to corticosteroid treatment also differ in their cutaneous vasoconstrictor response to a potent topical glucocorticoid. Corticosteroid resistance was defined by failure of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow rate to improve by at least 15% after a 2-week trial of corticosteroids (prednisolone 20 mg daily for 1 week, then 40 mg daily for 1 week) despite more than 15% improvement with inhaled beta agonists. Beclomethasone dipropionate in concentrations of 3 micrograms/ml, 10 micrograms/ml, 30 micrograms/ml, and 100 micrograms/ml was applied to forearm skin; the site was occluded under plastic and the degree of blanching assessed after 18 h. CS asthmatic subjects (n = 31), asthma patients with mild airways obstruction (n = 26), asthma patients taking long-term prednisolone (n = 13), and healthy volunteers showed similar vasoconstrictor responses. In CR asthmatic subjects (n = 15), the response (expressed in terms of either blanching intensity or the proportion of patients showing a positive response) was significantly lower than that in the CS group at concentrations of 3 micrograms/ml (p less than 0.01), 10 micrograms/ml (p less than 0.01), and 30 micrograms/ml (p less than 0.05), but not at 100 micrograms/ml. This resistance to glucocorticoids in the skin, together with reported evidence of glucocorticoid resistance in peripheral blood leucocytes, suggests a general defect in the ability of tissues to respond to glucocorticoids in CR asthma.\r"

We have measured apoprotein A (SP-A) concentrations in sputum to see if this is useful for the diagnosis of PAP. Sputum samples from three patients with PAP and twenty patients with other pulmonary disease were assayed using monoclonal antibodies to SP-A. SP-A concentrations were 400 times higher in patients with PAP than in the controls, suggestions that this measurement is useful for the diagnosis of PAP especially where lung biopsy is contraindicated.\r"

However, there were only 6 deaths among the 19 patients with adequate responses (p less than 0.001). These results suggest that some patients with septic shock may have relative adrenocortical insufficiency.\r"

  ".U": "91155577\r", 
  ".W": "To examine whether antipyretic therapy in young children is associated with potential risks (interference with enhanced host defences at febrile temperatures) or benefits (improved comfort and behaviour), a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of paracetamol was conducted among 225 children 6 months to 6 years of age who presented with acute (less than or equal to 4 days) fever (greater than or equal to 38 degrees C per rectum) without evident bacterial focus of infection. Parents were asked to give paracetamol liquid 10-15 mg/kg or placebo every 4 h as needed for fever and to avoid bathing, sponging, or other pharmacological agents. Parents kept temperature and symptom diaries and recorded changes in child comfort and behaviour according to a pretested, 5-category Likert-type questionnaire 1-2 h after every dose. There were no significant differences between treated and placebo groups in mean duration of subsequent fever (34.7 vs 36.1 h) or other symptoms (72.9 vs 71.7 h). Paracetamol-treated children were more likely to be rated by their parents as having at least a 1-category improvement in activity (38 vs 11%; p = 0.005) and alertness (33 vs 12%; p = 0.036) but no significant differences were noted in mood, comfort, appetite, or fluid intake. That overall improvement in behaviour and comfort with paracetamol was not impressive is underscored by the inaccuracy of parents' \"guess\" at the end of the trial as to which agent their child had received-45% correct guesses for paracetamol and 52% for placebo. The data suggest that the clinically relevant hazards and benefits of paracetamol antipyresis have been exaggerated.\r"

Initial airways hyperreactivity improved over this period, but FEV1 and airways specific conductance did not change significantly. There was a strong correlation between exposure carboxyhaemoglobin concentration (an indicator of smoke exposure) and initial airways specific conductance (r + 0.79; p = 0.006). Airways obstruction after smoke inhalation in house fires may be more common and more persistent than is generally recognised. Early lung function tests would allow the incidence of pulmonary complications after smoke inhalation and the potential benefits of early use of inhaled antiinflammatory drugs to be assessed.\r"

  ".W": "Although anatomical abnormalities of the upper airway have been recorded in some patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), a muscle tone dysregulation also seems to have an important role in this disorder. Since habitual snoring is the initial stage of OSA, the structural characteristics of upper airway muscles (medium pharyngeal constrictor muscle [MPCM]) from 13 men (9 non-snorers and 4 habitual snorers) were studied. MPCM fibre structure in non-snorers was broadly similar to that in normal limb muscles, with the exception that fibre diameters were smaller for all fibre types. Compared with limb muscles, MPCM had a smaller proportion of type IIb fibres and a higher proportion of types I and IIa fibres. MPCM in habitual snorers had an abnormal distribution of fibre types (low percentage of type I and type IIb fibres and high percentage of type IIa fibres) compared with non-snorers (p less than 0.001) and the type IIa fibres were hypertrophic. No myopathic or neurogenic changes were seen. Two possible hypotheses explain the abnormal distribution of fibre types in snorers. First, a constitutionally determined reduction of slow alpha-motor neurons induces an adaptive transformation of type IIb to type IIa fibres and a hypertrophy of type IIa fibres; or, second, motor neurons change their patterns of discharge and, hence, of activation, and modify fibre-type distribution of MPCM as an adaptation to the anatomical characteristic of upper airway and habitual snoring.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on tuberculosis management was investigated in 227 patients initially treated with a regimen containing streptomycin, isoniazid, and thiacetazone (STH). 93 of these 227 were HIV-seropositive. 60 patients, of whom 18 were HIV-seropositive, received a regimen consisting of streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin, and pyrazinamide (SHRZ) in the initial phase, and thiacetazone and isoniazid (TH) in the continuation phase. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 22 of 111 (20%) HIV-seropositive patients, and in 2 of 176 (1%) HIV-seronegative patients (RR = 18, 95% CI 4.4-76, p less than 10(-7]. During the first 8 weeks of treatment 18 reactions occurred among the 93 HIV-seropositive patients on STH, whereas no reaction occurred in 17 HIV-seropositive patients during the initial phase of SHRZ/TH (p = 0.04). None of the 18 HIV-seropositive patients with cutaneous reactions who were subsequently challenged with isoniazid reacted, nor did any of the 10 tested with streptomycin, but 6 of the 7 challenged with thiacetazone reacted. 3 patients (all HIV-positive and with toxic epidermal necrolysis) died as a result of the cutaneous reaction. These results have major implications for tuberculosis control programmes in Africa.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the relation between genotype and severity of disease in cystic fibrosis (CF) the frequencies and extent of several features of its phenotypic expression were investigated in the 235 patients who attend the Danish CF Centre. 14 patients who attend irregularly and 3 who do not carry the delta F508 mutation at all were excluded. The case-reports of the remaining 218 patients (aged 4 months to 41 years) were carefully evaluated, and they were all analysed for the delta F508 mutation. 172 (79%) were homozygous for delta F508 and 46 (20%) were heterozygous. The mutation therefore occurs on 89% of the chromosomes analysed. There were no significant differences between the homozygous and heterozygous groups in the proportions with meconium ileus at birth, liver involvement, or chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. However, significantly more of the homozygous patients had onset of symptoms before the age of 6 months (p less than 0.025); they were significantly younger at diagnosis (p = 0.013) and centre referral (p = 0.006); they required greater pancreatic enzyme substitution (p = 0.0002) and had poorer lung function; and the calculated yearly incidence of chronic Ps aeruginosa infection and yearly mortality rates were greater than in heterozygous patients (p = 0.0001).\r"

This subtype differs from the common Caucasian HLA-B27 subtypes in its recognition by cytotoxic T cells. We propose that HLA*B-2703, unlike other HLA-B27 subtypes, may not be associated with ankylosing spondylitis, thus accounting in part for the rarity of this condition in black populations.\r"

These findings have potentially important implications for the modulation of natural cytotoxicity in a wide range of disease states.\r"

Women who had received treatment while pregnant had primary tumours of significantly greater thickness than did those in the other three groups (p = 0.002). Other possible confounding factors (site, age, parity) did not differ between the groups. Once tumour thickness was controlled for, survival rate of women in whom melanoma was diagnosed and treated while they were pregnant did not differ from that in the other three groups. Cox regression analysis showed no differences between the three groups of women who were not pregnant at diagnosis. Women with melanoma should be advised about pregnancy on the basis of thickness and site of tumour and evidence of vascular spread, and not hormonal status.\r"

Insulin treatment and education about diabetes were similar in the two groups. Duration of initial stay in hospital had no effect on metabolic control during the 2 years but time since diagnosis was significant with respect to effect on haemoglobin A1 (p = 0.001), haemoglobin A1c (p = 0.004), and insulin dose (p less than 0.001). At 2 years, 45% of the children in the short-term group and 29% in the long-term group were C-peptide positive (p = NS); C-peptide positivity correlated with age. A change in the pattern of care of children with IDDM, led to a pronounced decrease in hospital use by this patient group. Irrespective of the length of initial stay in hospital, equally good metabolic control was obtained in both groups for 2 years.\r"

Guidelines for ethical management were based on the Declaration of Tokyo, which included the understanding that such detentions constituted mental torture. Conditions of detention in hospital were complicated by police interference in medical and nursing care, and by the chaining of some prisoners to their beds. Doctors are in a unique position to protest against inhuman treatment of prisoners, and should use this authority.\r"

The diagnosis of autoimmune Meniere's syndrome is largely based on history, response to steroids, or results of nonspecific laboratory tests such as serological studies. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) assay was used to determine levels of circulating immune complexes (CIC) in 30 patients with Meniere's disease and 20 control subjects. Patients with Meniere's disease had a statistically significant elevation of serum circulating immune complexes when compared to the control group. This suggests that CICs may be involved in the pathogenesis of Meniere's disease, either as a direct cause of damage, or as a by-product of an underlying autoimmune abnormality. Therapeutic implications include use of plasmapheresis to remove the complexes or CIC monitoring to serve as a marker for treatment efficacy.\r"

One ear (1.5%) had no postoperative hearing secondary to a granulomatous reaction. Complications were otherwise uncommon and mild. Most patients were treated on an outpatient basis. Our results compare favorably with other reports of laser surgery for otosclerosis. We conclude that excellent hearing results can be obtained using the argon laser for stapedotomy procedures.\r"

All patients presented at the Medical College of Virginia Hospitals or Clinics of Virginia Commonwealth University; they were followed for periods ranging from 1 to 16 years. When available, the fine-needle aspiration diagnoses were correlated with histologic diagnoses and long-term patient outcomes. The sensitivity for a neoplasm was 93.3%; the specificity for the absence of a neoplasm was 99%. Diagnostic efficiency was 96.4%, and predictive value of a positive aspiration for a neoplasm was 98.3%. With fine-needle aspiration, surgical excision of salivary gland masses is often unnecessary. In patients with primary and metastatic neoplasms involving the salivary glands, fine-needle aspiration aids the surgeon in mapping the extent of the surgical procedure and in preoperatively preparing the patient. The procedure is cost-effective.\r"

Effusion volume and cellular content were determined after sacrifice and rapid dissection of the ear. By 24 hours, rIL-2 (100 U) had produced a cellular effusion (77% to 92% polymorphonuclear neutrophil leukocytes), which cleared by 72 hours. rTNF (10 U) yielded a cellular effusion (12% to 67% lymphocytes) at 24 hours, which cleared by 48 hours. rIL-1 (100 U) did not produce significant effusion when compared to control. rIL-2 and rTNF cause an inflammatory effusion in the middle ear. To the extent they are generated in the middle ear during otitis media, these cytokines have the potential to contribute to the pathogenesis of otitis media with effusion.\r"

Caucasian noses were leptorrhine, Negro noses were platyrrhine, and Oriental noses were of intermediate dimension. Mean nasal resistances of untreated noses were 0.129 Pa/cm3/sec in Negroes (N = 17), 0.146 in Orientals (N = 20), and 0.184 in Caucasians (N = 24), and differences were more marked when noses were decongested (P less than 0.05 in all cases). Ratios between resistances of untreated and decongested noses showed no statistical differences between racial groups, suggesting a similarity in the mucovascular component of resistances.\r"

Thirty-one cases of nasopharyngeal carcinoma and 8 cases of lymph node metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma were studied. Detection rates of Epstein-Barr virus in various types of nasopharyngeal carcinoma according to the World Health Organization classification were as follows: 10 of 10 undifferentiated carcinomas, 8 of 13 nonkeratinizing carcinomas, and 5 of 7 keratinizing carcinomas. Eight lymph node metastases, for which the primary was positive for Epstein-Barr virus, also contained Epstein-Barr virus DNA. By in situ hybridization using a biotinylated Epstein-Barr virus probe, it was clearly demonstrated that Epstein-Barr virus DNA was localized in the nuclei of the neoplastic cells. The clinical features of nasopharyngeal carcinoma with or without Epstein-Barr virus were not different. These results demonstrate that nasopharyngeal carcinoma in Japanese patients is closely associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection, similar to nasopharyngeal carcinoma of other endemic and nonendemic areas.\r"

  ".W": "The gas contents of the physiological middle ear periodically cycle through two phases in steady state. During phase I, the eustachian tube is shut and the middle ear gas space is effectively closed. Gas is absorbed or produced at the mucosal surface, and the total pressure changes correspondingly. During phase II, which is of very short duration, the eustachian tube opens, a bolus of gas passes between the middle ear and the nasopharynx, and the total pressure in the middle ear rapidly adjusts to that in the nasopharynx. Since nasopharyngeal pressure fluctuates in time, so does the pressure in the middle ear. The effect of these pressure changes is to produce a level of ventilation in the middle ear, which depends on a combination of three parameters: the volume of the middle ear, multiplied by the mean amplitude of pressure variations in the nasopharynx, divided by the mean elapsed time between successive eustachian tube openings. Assuming steady-state conditions, the composition of middle ear gas can be computed and is predicted to range from PN2 = 621, PO2 = 46, PCO2 = 46, PH2O = 47 mm Hg in the case when nasopharynx fluctuations are small, to a match with nasopharyngeal gas composition, when the fluctuations are large.\r"

  ".W": "Motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) and the electromyographic (EMG) interference pattern (IP) were recorded from the biceps muscle of 5 normal subjects using both a concentric needle (CN) and a disposable monopolar needle (MN) electrode. The MUAPs recorded by the MN electrode had higher amplitude and area and were more frequently complex than those recorded with the CN electrode. The MUAP duration and area: amplitude ratio were similar for both electrodes. Although the MN electrode had a larger recording surface, its dimensions (maximum diameter and length of the cone shaped tip) were similar to those of the CN electrode (minor and major axes of the elliptical recording tip). Based on these observations, we infer that the MN electrode may be more selective than the CN electrode, ie, the AP amplitude recorded by the MN electrode decreases faster than the AP amplitude recorded by a CN electrode when the distance of the muscle fiber from the recording electrode increases. Photomicrographs of the MN electrode after use demonstrated no evidence that the insulating material had peeled off. There was also no evidence that MUAP measurement values changed during the recordings as would be expected if the recording surface changed due to peeling of the insulating material.\r"

We observed a dystrophin reaction in synaptic regions such as neuromuscular junctions, the equatorial region of intrafusal muscle fibers, the outer plexiform layer of the retina, the myoepithelial cell layer of salivary and sweat glands, tactile nerve endings, and neurons in the brain. These dystrophin-positive regions reportedly contain actin filaments as a common characteristic, which is compatible with the dystrophin cDNA sequence. Dystrophin was absent in these regions in mdx mice. These results suggest that dystrophin plays an important physiological and/or structural role in cell motility as a trigger for propagating contractile force in, for example, the conduction system, with some relationship between actin filaments.\r"

These data were compared to responses obtained after preceding supramaximal stimulation of digital fibers of the second (II) finger or the median nerve at the wrist. The time between conditioning and test stimuli were 50 msec. Following conditioning stimuli, F wave latencies were significantly increased while F amplitudes, durations, and persistences were all decreased. Chronodispersion was not significantly affected. These changes were associated with increased repetition of individual F responses. The most prominent changes were found after stimulation of fibers of digit II but only at levels of stimulation supramaximal for the sensory nerve action potential. Some, but relatively limited, changes were present after stimulation of digital fibers of the fifth finger. The results are consistent with afferent fiber, probably A delta, inhibition of antidromic motoneuron activation with associated decrease in central motor neuron pool excitability. The study also demonstrates that, except for chronodispersion, changes in F waves found with peripheral nerve injury may also occur due to physiological changes in the central nervous system.\r"

Electromyography (EMG) revealed positive myoclonus of the branchial musculature with synchronous negative myoclonus in a generalized distribution.

  ".W": "Nerve conduction studies are of great clinical value in diagnosing nerve pathology and injury. In most neurophysiological laboratories nerve conduction recordings are routinely made with surface bipolar electrodes. More rarely, needle electrodes are used. A bipolarly recorded nerve action potential (NAP) is the difference between 2 unipolar NAPs recorded from each pole of a bipolar electrode and a remote reference. The delay between the 2 separated unipolar NAPs depends on the distance between the poles and the conduction velocity (CV). When the delay between the unipolar NAPs was increased (partly through simulation), the following changes of the bipolar NAP occurred: (1) total amplitude was maximal at a certain delay but decreased if the delay was shorter or longer, (2) latencies of the first positive and the first negative peaks increased slightly until their amplitudes reached maximal values, (3) a second negative peak of increasing latency appeared with longer delays, (4) latencies of later peaks increased linearly, and (5) total area increased nonlinearly. All parameters of the bipolarly recorded NAP (except the onset of the first positive phase) changed with increasing delay. The significance of this is that if NAPs are recorded with a bipolar electrode, standard values obtained for each nerve cannot be transferred between laboratories if different interelectrode (interpolar) distances are used. Furthermore, the assumption that a fixed interelectrode distance allows comparisons between reference values and patient data is incorrect.\r"

One subtype is found in the transverse tubular (T) system of slow twitch fibers as well as the plasma membrane of fast and slow twitch fibers in the anterior tibial and soleus muscles. The second is present in the plasma membrane in all fibers of both muscles. The transverse tubular subtype exhibits 2 immunocytochemical staining patterns within muscle fibers, reticular and homogeneous, which may represent labeling of the developing T tubular system and of a cytoplasmic pool of alpha subunits of the sodium channel respectively. The reticular pattern eventually disappears in fast twitch fibers but persists into the adult stage in slow twitch fibers. The homogeneous pattern is also seen with antibodies to the plasma membrane subtype and disappears in early development as immunoreactivity to both subtypes gradually appears in the surface membrane. A reticular pattern is never seen with the plasma membrane subtype. The factors that modulate the expression of these subtypes is unknown.\r"

In addition, evidence was obtained which suggested that the contents of different Schwann cells vary. Some Schwann cell systems envelop afferent C fibers whereas others hold efferent sympathetic C axons. The results imply a modality segregation amongst both A and C fibers in human peripheral sensory nerve fascicles.\r"

  ".W": "Disruption of the development program of myosin gene expression has been reported in chicken muscular dystrophy. In the present report, the relationship between muscular dystrophy and the ability of muscle to respond to an increased work load with a transition in the myosin phenotype has been investigated. Hypertrophy of slow tonic anterior latissimus dorsi (ALD) and fast twitch patagialis (PAT) muscles was induced by overloading for 35 days and myosin expression was analyzed by electrophoresis and immunocytochemistry. Normal and dystrophic chicken ALD muscles have nearly identical proportions of SM-1 and SM-2 isomyosins and both exhibit an age-related repression of the SM-1 isomyosin which is enhanced and accelerated by overloading. Immunocytochemistry with anti-myosin heavy chain (MHC) antibodies demonstrates the appearance of nascent myofibers in overloaded ALD muscles from both normal and dystrophic chickens. A minor fast twitch fiber population is also identified which doubles in number with overloading in normal ALD muscles. There are only half as many fast twitch fibers in control dystrophic ALD muscles and this number does not increase with overloading. In contrast to ALD muscles, the isomyosin profile of normal and dystrophic PAT muscles is quite different. There is significantly more FM-3 and significantly less FM-1 isomyosin in the dystrophic PAT muscle. However, both normal and dystrophic PAT muscles exhibit an overload-induced accumulation of the FM-3 isomyosin. Immunocytochemistry reveals that, unlike the normal PAT muscle, the dystrophic PAT muscle contains a population of myofibers which express slow MHCs. As in the ALD muscle, overload-induced hypertrophy is associated with a repression of the SM-1 MHC in these fibers. Nascent myofiber formation does not occur in either normal or dystrophic overloaded PAT muscles.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Exogenous pulmonary surfactants are administered into the trachea either to prevent respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants or to treat it. In a randomized, multicenter trial, we compared the results of surfactant therapy initiated as prophylaxis with the results of rescue therapy with surfactant. METHODS. Before birth, 479 infants with an estimated gestational age of less than 30 weeks were randomly assigned to receive surfactant as prophylaxis (n = 235) or rescue therapy (n = 244). The infants in the prophylaxis group received a 90-mg intratracheal dose of an exogenous calf-lung surfactant extract at the time of delivery, whereas the infants in the rescue-therapy group received 90 mg of the surfactant several hours after delivery if the fractional inspiratory oxygen concentration was at least 0.40 or if the mean airway pressure was at least 0.686 kPa (7 cm of water), or both. Infants in both groups received additional doses of surfactant at intervals of 12 to 24 hours if these criteria were met. RESULTS. The proportion of infants surviving until discharge to their homes was significantly higher in the prophylaxis group than in the rescue-therapy group (88 vs. 80 percent, P = 0.028). This difference was due primarily to the longer survival of very premature infants (less than or equal to 26 weeks' gestation) in the prophylaxis group than in the rescue-therapy group (75 vs. 54 percent, P = 0.006). According to proportional-hazards regression analysis, the distribution of survival times was better for all infants in the prophylaxis group (P = 0.007) and for the subgroup of infants in the prophylaxis group who were delivered at 26 weeks' gestation or earlier (P = 0.0048). Infants in the prophylaxis group who were delivered at 26 weeks' gestation or earlier had a lower incidence of pneumothorax than similar infants in the rescue-therapy group (7 vs. 18 percent, P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS. We found a significant advantage to the administration of the initial dose of surfactant as prophylaxis rather than as rescue therapy in very premature infants.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Over the past 20 years, the parental origin of the extra chromosome in children with trisomy 21 has been investigated with cytogenetic methods of identifying morphologic variations in chromosome 21. These studies have concluded that the origin of the extra chromosome 21 was maternal in approximately 80 percent of cases and paternal in about 20 percent. METHODS. We studied 200 families, each with a single child with trisomy 21, using DNA polymorphisms as markers to determine the parental origin of the nondisjunction causing the extra chromosome 21. These polymorphisms spanned a region of about 120 centimorgans on the long arm of chromosome 21, from the D21S13 locus (the most centromeric) to the COL6A1 gene (the most telomeric). RESULTS. The parental origin of nondisjunction could be determined for all but 7 of the 200 children. It was maternal in 184 children (proportion [+/- SE], 95.3 +/- 1.5 percent) and paternal in 9 (4.7 +/- 1.5 percent). In a subgroup of 31 families, we compared the results of DNA analysis with those of traditional cytogenetic analysis. According to the cytogenetic analyses, nondisjunction originated in the mother in 26 cases (84 percent) and in the father in 5 (16 percent). DNA analysis demonstrated the origin as maternal in 29 (94 percent) and paternal in 2 (6 percent). With the cytogenetic analyses, there were three false determinations of paternal origin. CONCLUSIONS. In trisomy 21 the extra chromosome 21 is maternal in origin in about 95 percent of the cases, and paternal in only about 5 percent--considerably less than has been reported with cytogenetic methods. DNA polymorphic analysis is now the method of choice for establishing the parental origin of nondisjunction.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND: The use of advance directives is recommended so that people can determine the medical care they will receive when they are no longer competent, but the effectiveness of such directives is not clear. METHODS: In a prospective study conducted over a two-year period, 126 competent residents of a nursing home and 49 family members of incompetent patients were interviewed to determine their preferences with respect to hospitalization, intensive care, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, artificial ventilation, surgery, and tube feeding in the event of critical illness, terminal illness, or permanent unconsciousness. Advance directives, consisting of signed statements of treatment preferences, were placed in the medical record to assist in care in the nursing home and to be forwarded to the hospital if necessary. RESULTS: In an analysis of 96 outcome events (hospitalization or death in the nursing home), care was consistent with previously expressed wishes 75 percent of the time; however, the presence of the written advance directive in the medical record did not facilitate consistency. Among the 24 events in which inconsistencies occurred, care was provided more aggressively than had been requested in 6 cases, largely because of unanticipated surgery or artificial ventilation, and less aggressively than requested in 18, largely because hospitalization or cardiopulmonary resuscitation was withheld. Inconsistencies were more likely in the nursing home than in the hospital. CONCLUSIONS. The effectiveness of written advance directives is limited by inattention to them and by decisions to place priority on considerations other than the patient's autonomy. Since our study was performed in only one nursing home and one hospital, other studies are necessary to determine the generalizability of our findings.\r"

METHODS: We surveyed 405 outpatients of 30 primary care physicians at Massachusetts General Hospital and 102 members of the general public in Boston and asked them as part of the survey to complete the Medical Directive. RESULTS: Advance directives were desired by 93 percent of the outpatients and 89 percent of the members of the general public (P greater than 0.2). Both the young and the healthy subgroups expressed at least as much interest in planning as those older than 65 and those in fair-to-poor health. Of the perceived barriers to issuing advance directives, the lack of physician initiative was among the most frequently mentioned, and the disturbing nature of the topic was among the least. The outpatients refused life-sustaining treatments in 71 percent of their responses to options in the four scenarios (coma with chance of recovery, 57 percent; persistent vegetative state, 85 percent; dementia, 79 percent; and dementia with a terminal illness, 87 percent), with small differences between widely differing types of treatments. Specific treatment preferences could not be usefully predicted according to age, self-rated state of health, or other demographic features. Completing the Medical Directive took a median of 14 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: When people are asked to imagine themselves incompetent with a poor prognosis, they decide against life-sustaining treatments about 70 percent of the time. Health, age, or other demographic features cannot be used, however, to predict specific preferences. Advance directives as part of a comprehensive approach such as that provided by the Medical Directive are desired by most people, require physician initiative, and can be achieved during a regular office visit.\r"

Cross-hybridizing sequences are detectable in other species, raising the possibility that degenerative conditions in other organisms may be caused by mutations in similar genes. All three dominant mec-4 mutations affect the same amino acid. Effects of amino-acid substitutions at this position suggest that steric hindrance may induce the degenerative state.\r"

  ".W": "Understanding the mechanisms involved in long-term potentiation (LTP) should provide insights into the cellular and molecular basis of learning and memory in vertebrates. It has been established that in the CA1 region of the hippocampus the induction of LTP requires the transient activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor system. During low-frequency transmission, significant activation of this system is prevented by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) mediated synaptic inhibition which hyperpolarizes neurons into a region where NMDA receptor-operated channels are substantially blocked by Mg2+ (refs. 5, 6). But during high-frequency transmission, mechanisms are evoked that provide sufficient depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane to reduce this block and thereby permit the induction of LTP. We now report that this critical depolarization is enabled because during high-frequency transmission GABA depresses its own release by an action on GABAB autoreceptors, which permits sufficient NMDA receptor activation for the induction of LTP. These findings demonstrate a role for GABAB receptors in synaptic plasticity.\r"

  ".W": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a human herpesvirus, establishes a persistent asymptomatic infection of the circulating B-lymphocyte pool. The mechanism of virus persistence is not understood but, given the limited lifespan of most B cells in vivo, it seems most likely that EBV-infected cells must gain access to the long-lived memory B-cell pool. Here we show in an in vitro system that EBV, through expression of the full set of eight virus-coded 'latent' proteins, can protect human B cells from programmed cell death (apoptosis), the deletion mechanism which normally restricts entry into memory. We have found that EBV-positive Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell clones retaining the original tumour cell phenotype and expressing only one of the virus latent proteins, the nuclear antigen EBNA 1, are extremely sensitive to apoptosis; in this respect they resemble the tumour's normal cell of origin found in the germinal centres of lymphoid tissue. By contrast, isogenic BL cell clones which have activated expression of all eight EBV latent proteins are resistant to the induction of apoptosis. The EBV latent proteins should therefore be seen not just as activators of B-cell proliferation but, perhaps more importantly, as mediators of enhanced B-cell survival.\r"

It has been implicated as a mediator in diseases such as myocardial infarction, stroke and bronchial asthma. Using a stable analogue of this compound we recently purified the human platelet thromboxane A2 receptor to apparent homogeneity. Using an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to its partial amino-acid sequence, we have obtained a complementary DNA clone encoding this receptor from human placenta and a partial clone from cultured human megakaryocytic leukaemia cells. The placenta cDNA encodes a protein of 343 amino acids with seven putative transmembrane domains. The protein expressed in COS-7 cells binds drugs with affinities identical to those of the platelet receptor, and that in Xenopus oocytes opens Ca2(+)-activated Cl- channel on agonist stimulation. Northern blot analysis and nucleotide sequences of the two clones suggest that an identical species of the thromboxane A2 receptor is present in platelets and vascular tissues. This first report on the molecular structure of an eicosanoid receptor will promote the molecular pharmacology and pathophysiology of these bioactive compounds.\r"

  ".W": "The sodium-calcium exchanger is critical in the normal functioning of many cells. In heart muscle, it is the principal way by which the cells keep the concentration of intracellular calcium low, pumping out the Ca2+ that enters the cytosol through L-type Ca2+ channels. The exchanger may also contribute to the triggering of Ca2+ release during voltage-activated excitation-contraction coupling in heart. Time resolved examination of the conformational changes of macromolecules in living cells has so far been largely restricted to ion-channel proteins whose gating is voltage-dependent. We have now directly measured electrical currents arising from the molecular rearrangements of the sarcolemmal Na-Ca exchanger. Changes in the conformation of the exchanger protein were activated by a rapid increase in the intracellular calcium concentration produced by flash photolysis of caged calcium in voltage-clamped heart cells. Two components of membrane current were produced, reflecting a calcium-dependent conformational change of the transporter proteins and net transport of ions by the exchanger. The properties of these components provide evidence that the Na-Ca exchanger protein undergoes two consecutive membrane-crossing molecular transitions that each move charge, and that there are at least 250 exchangers per micron 2 turning over up to 2,500 times per second.\r"

  ".W": "The fragile-X syndrome is the most frequent inherited form of mental retardation, with an incidence of 1 in 1,500 males. It is characterized by the presence of a fragile site at Xq27.3 induced in vitro by folate deprivation or by inhibitors of deoxynucleotide synthesis. Its mode of inheritance is unusual for an X-linked trait, with incomplete penetrance in both males and females. Some phenotypically normal males transmit the mutation to all their daughters who rarely express any symptoms, but penetrance is high in sons and daughters of these carrier women. Genetic and physical mapping of the Xq27-q28 region has confirmed that the disease locus is located at or very near the fragile site. Hypotheses proposed to account for the abnormalities in the inheritance of the disease include sequence rearrangements by meiotic recombination or a mutation that affects reactivation of an inactive X chromosome during differentiation of female germ cells. To detect such rearrangements, or methylation changes that may reflect a locally inactive X chromosome, we used pulsed-field gel analysis of DNA from fragile-X patients with probes close to the fragile-X locus. The probe Do33 (DXS465) detected abnormal patterns in fragile-X patients, but not in normal controls or in non-expressing male transmitters.\r"

We report the identification of SCJ1, a gene in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that encodes a homologue of the bacterial DnaJ protein. SCJ1 was identified by a genetic screen in which increased expression of candidate genes results in missorting of a nuclear-targeted test protein. The predicted amino-acid sequence of SCJ1 is 37% identical to the entire E. coli DnaJ protein. Hybridization experiments indicate that there is a family of yeast genes related to SCJ1. These findings suggest that the Hsp70 DnaK-DnaJ interaction is general to eukaryotes.\r"

Cells also drift up gradients generated artificially, for example by diffusion from the tip of a capillary tube or by mixing. Here we describe conditions under which cells aggregate in response to gradients of attractant which they excrete themselves. When cells are grown in semi-solid agar on intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, they form symmetrical arrays of spots or stripes that arise sequentially. When cells in a thin layer of liquid culture are exposed to these compounds, spots appear synchronously, more randomly arrayed. In either case, the patterns are stationary. The attractant is a chemical sensed by the aspartate receptor. Its excretion can be triggered by oxidative stress. As oxygen is limiting at high cell densities, aggregation might serve as a mechanism for collective defence.\r"

  ".W": "Although there has been much speculation on the pathways of protein folding, only recently have experimental data on the topic been available. The study of proteins under conditions where species intermediate between the fully folded and unfolded states are stable has provided important information, for example about the disulphide intermediates in BPTI, cis/trans proline isomers of RNase A3 and the molten globule state of alpha-lactalbumin. An alternative approach to investigating folding pathways has involved detection and characterization of transient conformers in refolding studies using stopped-flow methods coupled with NMR measurements of hydrogen exchange. The formation of intermediate structures has been detected in the early stages of folding of cytochrome c, RNaseA and barnase. For alpha-lactalbumin, hydrogen exchange kinetics monitored by NMR proved to be crucial for identifying native-like structural features in the stable molten globule state. An analogous partially folded protein stable under equilibrium conditions has not been observed for the structurally homologous protein hen egg-white lysozyme, although there is evidence that a similar but transient state is formed during refolding. Here we describe NMR experiments based on competition between hydrogen exchange and the refolding process which not only support the existence of such a transient species for lysozyme, but enable its structural characteristics to be defined. The results indicate that the two structural domains of lysozyme are distinct folding domains, in that they differ significantly in the extent to which compact, probably native-like, structure is present in the early stages of folding.\r"

Most studies, however, have focused on mitochondrial or chloroplast genes, present at hundreds to thousands of copies per cell compared with one or two for each nuclear gene. With a probe containing Alu repeat sequences, Paabo isolated a 3.4-kilobase DNA fragment from a 2,400-year-old Egyptian mummy which was subsequently shown to contain an intron of the nuclear gene HLA-DQA (ref. 11). Here we report a more targeted approach to the characterization of nuclear genes from archaeological specimens. The Windover pond of central Florida has provided skeletal and soft tissue remains from 165 humans, radiocarbon-dated to be 6,990-8,130 years old. Using DNA obtained from one individual we have characterized segments from six nuclear genes: that for beta 2-microglobulin and five members of the class I HLA heavy chain gene family. Distinctive patterns of nucleotide substitution in the cloned heavy chain gene segments permit tentative assignment of the HLA-A,B type of the ancient individual.\r"

Reports of patients with selective dysfunction of specific semantic categories such as abstract versus concrete words, living things versus inanimate objects, animals, fruits and vegetables, proper names and so forth, support the hypothesis that the neural organization of the semantic processing component is organized in these categories. There are reports of selective dysfunction of the grammatical categories noun and verb, suggesting that a dimension of lexical organization is the grammatical class of words. But the results reported in these studies have not provided unambiguous evidence concerning two fundamental questions about the nature and the locus of this organization within the lexical system. Is the noun-verb distinction represented in the semantic or in the phonological and orthographic lexicons? Is grammatical-class knowledge represented independently of lexical forms or is it represented separately and redundantly within each modality-specific lexicon? Here we report the performance of two brain-damaged subjects with modality-specific deficits restricted principally (H.W.) or virtually only (S.J.D) to verbs in oral and written production, respectively. The contrasting performance suggests that grammatical-class distinctions are redundantly represented in the phonological and orthographic output lexical components.\r"

These channels in normal cells are activated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C. In cystic fibrosis these kinases fail to activate otherwise normal Cl- channels. But Cl- flux in cystic fibrosis cells, as in normal cells, can be activated by raising intracellular Ca2+ (refs 5-10). We report here whole-cell patch clamp studies of normal and cystic fibrosis-derived airway epithelial cells showing that Cl- channel activation by Ca2+ is mediated by multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. We find that intracellular application of activated kinase and ATP activates a Cl- current similar to that activated by a Ca2+ ionophore, that peptide inhibitors of either the kinase or calmodulin block Ca2(+)-dependent activation of Cl- channels, and that a peptide inhibitor of protein kinase C does not block Ca2(+)-dependent activation. Ca2+/calmodulin activation of Cl- channels presents a pathway with therapeutic potential for circumventing defective regulation of Cl- channels in cystic fibrosis.\r"

Here we report that ELAM-1-transfected COS cells also bind a unique skin-associated subset of circulating memory T cells defined by the expression of the cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen. T cells expressing this antigen bind at least as well as neutrophils to expressed ELAM-1, whereas other lymphocytes in the peripheral blood bind poorly, or not at all. Immunohistological survey of chronically inflamed tissue specimens revealed that vascular expression of ELAM-1 occurs at cutaneous sites in preference to noncutaneous sites. We conclude that at sites of chronic inflammation, ELAM-1 may function as a skin vascular addressin, a tissue-selective endothelial cell-adhesion molecule for skin-homing memory T lymphocytes.\r"

Two molecular pathways involving the VLA-4 and LFA-1 integrins are known to mediate T-cell adhesion to activated endothelium. Here we show that a third pathway involving the rapidly inducible endothelial cell-surface adhesion molecule ELAM-1 contributes to the binding of resting CD4+ T cells to IL-1-induced human endothelial cells. All three pathways contribute to the greater adhesion to endothelium of memory T cells than naive T cells. There are two unique features of T-cell adhesion to purified ELAM-1: first, ELAM-1 exclusively mediates adhesion of memory T cells; second, memory T-cell binding to ELAM-1 is independent of acute activation events that regulate integrin-mediated adhesion. Thus, ELAM-1 may be of primary importance in the initial attachment of memory T cells to inflamed endothelium in vivo and to the preferential migration of memory T cells into tissue and inflammatory sites.\r"

Rat cells transformed by this mutant p53 and an activated ras oncogene grow well at 37 degrees C but cease DNA synthesis and cell division when shifted to 32 degrees C. Immunostaining demonstrates that the mutant p53 protein is in the nucleus of the arrested cells at 32 degrees C but in the cytoplasm of the growing cells at 37 degrees C. This is the first example of a protein which is temperature-sensitive for nuclear transport. The translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus and vice versa occurs 6 h after temperature shift and is coincident with the inhibition of DNA synthesis; transport from cytoplasm to nucleus does not require protein synthesis. Remarkably, inhibition of protein synthesis at 37 degrees C also results in the rapid appearance of mutant p53 in the cell nucleus. These results suggest the presence of a short-lived protein responsible for holding p53 in the cytoplasm at 37 degrees C but not at 32 degrees C. Analysis of a non-temperature-sensitive mutant p53 protein shows that its cytoplasmic location is sensitive to protein synthesis inhibitors but not to temperature.\r"

The DNA sequences of SEC62 and SEC63 predict multispanning membrane proteins, and biochemical characterization of the SEC62 protein (Sec62) confirms that it is an integral ER membrane protein. Here we show that Sec61, Sec62 and Sec63 are assembled with two additional proteins into a multisubunit membrane-associated complex.

Here we report that p107wee1 immune complexes phosphorylate p107wee1 equally on serine and tyrosine residues, and also phosphorylate an exogenous substrate, angiotensin II, on tyrosine. Both kinase activities are attributable to p107wee1 because they are also observed when wee1+ is expressed in heterologous systems; both are abolished by a point mutation in the ATP-binding domain, and both behave like an asymmetric monomer of Mr114K on gel filtration and density-gradient centrifugation. Thus the wee1+ gene product is representative of a novel class of protein kinase that phosphorylates both serine and tyrosine residues.\r"

  ".U": "91156315\r", 
  ".W": "In recent years, the observation that the response of patients to opioid drugs may be influenced by properties inherent in the pain or pain syndrome, such as its pathophysiology, has evolved into the belief that certain types of pain, e.g., neuropathic pains, may be unresponsive to these drugs. This concept has important implications for both clinical practice and basic understanding of opioid mechanisms. We critically evaluate opioid responsiveness, particularly as it relates to neuropathic pain, and propose a clinically relevant definition and a paradigm for its investigation. The paradigm is illustrated by analgesic responses to opioid infusion in 28 patients with neuropathic pains and by a detailed presentation of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationships in one of these patients, whose central pain responded promptly to an infusion of hydromorphone. From this analysis, we hypothesize that (1) opioid responsiveness in man can be defined by the degree of analgesia achieved during dose escalation to either intolerable side effects or the occurrence of 'complete' or 'adequate' analgesia; (2) opioid responsiveness is a continuum, rather than a quantal phenomenon; (3) opioid responsiveness is determined by a diverse group of patient characteristics and pain-related factors, as well as drug-selective effects; and (4) a neuropathic mechanism may reduce opioid responsiveness, but does not result in an inherent resistance to these drugs. Given the complexity of factors contributing to opioid responsiveness and the observation that outcome cannot be reliably predicted, opioids should not be withheld on the assumption that pain mechanism, or any other factor, precludes a favorable response. Both the clinical use of opioids and paradigms to investigate opioid responsiveness should include dose escalation to maximally tolerated levels and repeated monitoring of analgesia and other effects.\r"

Another 7.4% have some pain of uncertain duration. Eighty-three percent of the definite pain group received treatment. Chronic pain subjects scored significantly higher than normals on the CES-D (10.68 +/- S.E.M. 0.76 vs. 8.05 +/- 0.23, P less than 0.01) with subjects with pain of uncertain duration scoring similar to the definite chronic pain population (11.13 +/- 0.76).

Nausea, dizziness, vomiting and constipation were predominant adverse reactions in the codeine plus paracetamol group. During the first week of treatment, 30 patients (36%) in the codeine plus paracetamol group and 9 (12%) in the paracetamol group dropped out. As evaluated from patients completing the first week of treatment, the pain intensity during that week compared to their baseline pain was significantly lower in the codeine plus paracetamol group than in the paracetamol group. Moreover, during the first week the paracetamol group received rescue medicine significantly more frequently. In conclusion, when evaluated after 7 days of treatment, the daily addition of codeine 180 mg to paracetamol 3 g significantly reduced the intensity of chronic pain due to osteoarthritis of the hip joint. However, several adverse drug reactions, mainly of the gastrointestinal tract, and the larger number of patients withdrawing from treatment means that the addition of such doses of codeine cannot be recommended for longer-term treatment of chronic pain in elderly patients.\r"

  ".W": "This paper reviews reports of phantom limb sensations which resemble somatosensory events experienced in the limb before amputation. It also presents descriptions of this phenomenon in 68 amputees who took part in a series of clinical studies. These somatosensory memories are predominantly replicas of distressing pre-amputation lesions and pains which were experienced at or near the time of amputation, and are described as having the same qualities of sensation as the pre-amputation pain. The patients who experience these pains emphasize that they are suffering real pain which they can describe in vivid detail, and insist that the experience is not merely a cognitive recollection of an earlier pain. Reports of somatosensory memories are less common when there has been a discontinuity, or a pain-free interval, between the experience of pain and amputation. Among the somatosensory memories reported are cutaneous lesions, deep tissue injuries, bone and joint pain and painful pre-amputation postures. The experience of somatosensory memories does not appear to be related to the duration of pre-amputation pain, time since amputation, age, gender, prosthetic use, level of amputation, number of limbs amputated, or whether the amputation followed an accident or illness. The results suggest that somatosensory inputs of sufficient intensity and duration can produce lasting changes in central neural structures which combine with cognitive-evaluative memories of the pre-amputation pain to give rise to the unified experience of a past pain referred to the phantom limb. Implications for pre- and post-operative pain control are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "This article describes the development of the Checklist for Interpersonal Pain Behavior (CHIP), an observation scale which assesses overt pain behavior. The study is an extension of an earlier study in which the dimensions and components of observed chronic pain behavior were examined. A broad definition of pain behavior is chosen (interpersonal pain behavior), namely the interaction between the pain patient and his/her direct environment. The list of pain behaviors, taken from the earlier study, has been transformed into a 78-item global rating scale to be used by nurses to quantify observed pain behavior in a clinical setting. Six studies examine the factor structure and the psychometric properties of this behavioral observation method. In the first study, 6 internally reliable factors are derived using factor analytic techniques from a sample of 152 chronic pain patients. They are labeled as: 'distorted mobility,' 'verbal complaints,' 'non-verbal complaints,' 'nervousness,' 'depression' and 'day sleeping.' Internal consistency of all factors, except 'day sleeping' was excellent. The following studies show that the CHIP is sufficiently reliable and valid. After a discussion on the advantages of this observation scale, the conclusion seems justified that the CHIP is a useful tool in pain assessment that can easily be used by nurses.\r"

  ".W": "We have studied the effect of NE 19550 (olvanil, N-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl) methyl-9Z-octadecenamide), a capsaicin analogue with approximately equipotent antinociceptive activity in vivo compared with capsaicin, on nociceptive responses recorded from spinal dorsal horn neurones in vivo and from a spinal ventral root in vitro. In adult rats anaesthetized with halothane, antinociceptive doses of olvanil (20-40 mumol/kg, s.c.) reduced C-fibre responses evoked in wide dynamic range, lumbar dorsal horn neurones, by peripheral transcutaneous electrical stimulation. Intradermal injection of olvanil, localized to a discrete region of the peripheral receptive field, did not activate C-fibres nor change C-fibre evoked activation of dorsal horn neurones. Spinal intrathecal administration of olvanil attenuated C-fibre evoked responses and, at the highest concentration, significantly reduced A beta-fibre evoked activity. In the neonatal rat spinal cord/tail preparation maintained in vitro, superfusion of the cord with olvanil (500 nM-5 microM) did not evoke a depolarization but responses to peripheral noxious stimulation were attenuated. In a similar in vitro preparation of the neonatal rat spinal cord, the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide-like immunoreactivity (CGRP-LI) was measured in spinal cord superfusates. Capsaicin (2-10 microM) evoked a large release of CGRP-LI but olvanil (2-10 microM) produced only a small or undetectable release. Following the administration of each substance, however, the release of CGRP-LI evoked by a depolarizing potassium stimulus was significantly attenuated. These data indicate that C-fibre input to the dorsal horn was attenuated by acute systemic doses of olvanil that were antinociceptive in behavioural tests. This effect was unlikely to be due to impairment of C-fibre function by a peripheral locus of action but was more consistent with an action in the spinal cord in which the reduced release of a neurotransmitter substance from afferent nerve terminals may play a prominent role.\r"

It appears that if the intrathecal doses of SST are kept below 15 micrograms and the epidural doses below 250 micrograms, the prolonged tail-flick latency can be separated from the transient motor blockade. The antinociception appears not to be attributable to neurotoxicity by the histological evidence available.\r"

Pentobarbital almost completely reversed intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) morphine analgesia, but did not affect intrathecal (i.t.) morphine analgesia. Phenobarbital had a similar effect but was much weaker. Picrotoxin blocked the reversal effect of pentobarbital. Diazepam, when given together with pentobarbital, enhanced the effect of pentobarbital. Furthermore, muscimol reversed i.c.v. morphine analgesia without affecting i.t. morphine analgesia. Our results strongly suggest that the GABAA receptor is involved in supraspinal morphine analgesia.\r"

Reliable cardiovascular (pressor), respiratory and visceromotor responses in addition to reports of pressure/pain sensations were evoked by colonic distension in 8 of the 9 subjects. The pressure/pain sensations were referred to the lower abdomen, lower back and perineum and their intensity quantified using a visual analogue scale. Responses to colonic distension were graded and increased with repeated distensions at the same intensity (60 mm Hg). The area of referral as indicated by subject drawings increased with repeated distensions as did the intensity of the subjects' sensory and affective descriptors of the sensation. Five of the subjects differentiated between 'pressure' and 'pain' sensations evoked by colonic distension; the intensity of the 'pain' sensation accelerated during the distending stimulus whereas the 'pressure' sensation was typically stable or adapting during the distending stimulus.\r"

Phase-modulated rotating frame imaging was used to study regional cerebral energy metabolism in the brains of 9 normal newborns and 25 newborns after birth asphyxia. Relative concentrations of phosphorus-containing metabolites and intracellular pH were determined for brain tissue at three specified depths below the brain surface for all neonates. Wide variations in metabolite ratios were seen among normal neonates, and considerable metabolic heterogeneity was demonstrated in individual neonates by depth-resolved spectroscopy. Asphyxiated neonates with severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and a poor neurodevelopmental outcome showed the expected rise in inorganic orthophosphate and fall in phosphocreatine concentrations in both global and spatially localized spectra. Phase-modulated rotating frame imaging showed that metabolic derangement was less in superficial than in deeper brain tissue. The inorganic orthophosphate-adenosine triphosphate ratio from 1 to 2 cm below the brain surface was more accurate than any global metabolite ratio for the identification of neonates with a poor short-term outcome. These data are consistent with the known vulnerability of subcortical brain tissue to hypoxic-ischemic injury in the full-term neonate.\r"

Those receiving the balanced review significantly increased their agreement with 5 of 10 targeted adverse effects, while no change occurred for any risks among those taught by the negative intervention. A teaching model that only emphasizes the untoward consequences of anabolic steroids is ineffective, even in the short-term. A balanced education approach can improve understanding of the potential adverse effects of these drugs. Additional strategies may be required to change young athletes' attitudes toward anabolic androgenic steroid use.\r"

A noncausal relationship--coincidence--could explain the temporal relation between DTP vaccine and neurologic illness, inasmuch as DTP vaccine is given at the age of emergence of idiopathic neurologic disease. The relationship between DTP vaccine and neurologic illness lacks specificity. Case series have had an impact on both physicians' and the lay public's impression of the safety of pertussis vaccine greatly out of proportion to their scientific importance. Case series can be useful for generating hypotheses but cannot provide evidence that pertussis vaccine is causally related to acute neurologic illness or brain damage. Observational studies using cohort and ecologic designs did not find an association between DTP vaccine and serious neurologic illness, but they were not powerful enough to detect an association as rare as that observed by the NCES investigators. The case-control design offers the best chance of providing causal evidence regarding DTP vaccine and serious neurologic illness. The NCES is the only published case-control study of this issue. This study found a rare association between DTP vaccine and some types of acute neurologic illness. Bias and chance are unlikely to account entirely for the association demonstrated by the NCES. However, the association has not yet been replicated by other case-control studies. The NCES does not demonstrate that DTP vaccine causes permanent brain damage.\r"

Less than one half of mothers who were employed were still breast-feeding at the second postpartum interview, whereas two thirds of those who were not employed were still breast-feeding. Among employed mothers, working no more than 20 hours per week appeared to be protective for continued breast-feeding.\r"

Keeping the bodies at +6 degrees C, the increase of the hypoxanthine levels was estimated to 3.5 mumol/L per hour when sampling was started more than 12 hours after death (range 2.8 to 5.6 mumol/L per hour). Results of hypoxanthine measurements from vitreous humor in 73 infants with sudden infant death syndrome, 17 infants and children who died sudden violent deaths, and 6 neonates who died suddenly without hypoxemia prior to death were corrected according to the expected postmortem hypoxanthine increase. The time between death and autopsy was similar in the three groups studied. The corrected median hypoxanthine level in the group with sudden infant death syndrome was 227 mumol/L, which is significantly higher than in the other groups; 22 mumol/L in the group who had violent deaths (P less than .01), and 0 mumol/L in the neonate group (P less than .01).

In addition to chronic sinus disease, recurrent otitis media and asthma exacerbation were common problems in this group. Five patients had an elevated age-adjusted IgE level and 22 patients had positive prick tests to one or more environmental inhalants; these findings suggest an allergic component in this subgroup. Twelve additional patients had highly reactive intradermal tests to common environmental allergens, which also may be clinically significant for underlying atopy. Eleven patients had low immunoglobulin levels, 6 had low immunoglobulin levels and vaccine hyporesponsiveness, and 17 had poor vaccine response only. Thus, 34 of 61 patients with refractory sinusitis had abnormal results on immune studies, with depressed IgG3 levels and poor response to pneumococcal antigen 7 being most common. In addition to allergy, immunologic incompetence may be an important etiologic factor in patients with chronic, refractory sinusitis.\r"

The less popular but recommended alternative is to repeatedly administer standardized screening tests. Such tests are time consuming but, unlike clinical judgment, have known detection rates. Preliminary research concerning clinical judgment showed that clusters of parental concerns related to their childrens' performances on screening tests. In the present study, previous research was refined by assessment of the meaning of parents' concerns about their childrens' speech-language development. In this study of 157 families seeking pediatric care, 72% of children whose speech-language screening yielded positive results had parents who were concerned about their speech-language development. Of children with negative screening results, 83% had parents with no concerns about their speech-language development. Although standardized screening tests should be used occasionally in the developmental surveillance process, the findings show that the problems of most children with developmental problems were detected through clinical judgment based on parental concern.\r"

Patients who did not have port-wine stains on the areas served by branches V1 and V2 of the trigeminal nerve had no signs or symptoms of eye and/or CNS involvement. Port-wine stains of the eyelids, bilateral distribution of the birthmark, and unilateral port-wine stains involving all three branches of the trigeminal nerve were associated with a significantly higher likelihood of having eye and/or CNS complications. Twenty-four percent of those with bilateral trigeminal nerve port-wine stains had eye and/or CNS involvement compared with 6% of those with unilateral lesions. All those who had eye and/or CNS complications had port-wine stain involvement of the eyelids; in 91% both upper and lower eyelids were involved, whereas in 9% only the lower eyelid was involved. None of those with upper eyelid port-wine stains alone had eye and/or CNS complications. In addition, 3 (75%) of the 4 subjects with seizures alone had bilateral port-wine stain involvement. A third group, these with unilateral V1, V2, and V3 port-wine stains, had eye and/or CNS complications in 3 (19%) of 16 subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

An infant with documented long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is described with a detailed metabolic profile, long-term clinical follow-up, and response to treatment. This patient is compared with the seven previously published cases of this disorder in order to stress the unique features of the initial presentation, more subtle late manifestations of the disease, and clinical and biochemical differentiation from the more common medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. This report stresses the enlarging spectrum of the clinical presentation and natural history of this defect in fatty acid oxidation.\r"

If tilting alone did not induce syncope, isoproterenol infusion was given to increase heart rate to 150 to 160 beats per minute. In 80% of patients with a history of syncope, identical symptoms could be reproduced during tilting: an abrupt fall in blood pressure combined with profound nodal bradycardia, ranging from 32 to 86 beats per minute. These symptoms were quickly reversed by returning the patient to the supine position. For patients with frequent occurrences of syncope, especially when there was a history of trauma sustained during these episodes, a therapeutic regimen of either beta blockers or 9 alpha-fluorocortisol was begun. The mechanisms of this common cause of syncope in childhood is neurocardiogenic in response to venous pooling and catecholamine-induced tachycardia. The tilt test is an excellent and cost-effective test for the workup of unexplained syncope in childhood.\r"

  ".W": "Se is an essential nutrient that provides antioxidant protection in concert with vitamin E. Several selenoproteins have been identified, but only one, SeGSHpx, has a known function, that of neutralizing toxic hydroperoxides. Plasma Se concentration, being responsive to changes in Se intake, is the most practical and widely used measure of nutritional Se status. The plasma Se concentrations of the majority of healthy infants and children fall within the range of 50 to 150 micrograms/L. Although SeGSHpx activity measures the metabolically functional form of Se, the lack of a standardized analytical method has limited its usefulness as an index of nutritional Se status. Se deficiency was first observed in animals, but it is now recognized to occur in humans. Two human diseases associated with severe nutritional Se deficiency have been reported from China: a juvenile cardiomyopathy named Keshan disease and a chondrodystrophy named Kaschin-Beck disease. Long-term TPN, which provides negligible amounts of intrinsic Se, has been demonstrated in some cases to result in biochemical and clinical impairment. Although there are no consistent signs and symptoms characteristic of TPN-associated Se deficiency in addition to the low blood selenium levels, some patients will experience leg muscle pain and altered serum transaminase and creatine kinase activities. These manifestation of Se deficiency usually take years to develop. Recent information about the amount of dietary Se needed to maximize plasma SeGSHpx activity in adult men has allowed for better estimates of the Se requirement for humans. Recommended daily dietary allowances published recently by the National Academy of Sciences have been revised for infants and children in this paper by making appropriate adjustments for the protein requirements of these age-groups. These recommended intakes for Se can generally be met by consuming adequate amounts of cereals, meat, eggs, dairy products, human milk, and infant formula, which are good sources of highly available Se and are of low risk of providing excess amounts of Se. Suboptimal Se intakes by pregnant women may predispose their infants to low Se status at birth, which in turn may affect the infants ability to maintain adequate Se status during the first few months of life. In those situations where protein intake is restricted, such as in phenylketonuria and maple syrup urine disease, Se-supplemented formulas should be used. The most critical situation for Se supplementation is in pediatric patients receiving long-term TPN therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

A major goal of the Georgia Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) is to increase the practice of breast-feeding among the women it serves. Breast-feeding practices were determined among a random sample of 404 women from a cohort of 2010 who attended WIC prenatal clinics in Georgia in 1986 and were expected to deliver in February 1987. Respondents were interviewed 6 months postpartum. Of these women, 24% initially breast-fed, but only 6% continued for 6 months or longer. The initiation of breast-feeding was associated with greater maternal education and with being married. The adjusted odds of breast-feeding for mothers who were married or living as married were 3.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.7 to 5.3) times greater than for mothers who were not married or living as married. Mothers with more than 12 years, 12 years, or 10 to 11 years of education were 5.2 (1.8 to 15.3), 2.7 (1.0 to 6.9), and 2.5 (0.9 to 6.9) times more likely, respectively, to breast-feed than mothers with 9 or fewer years of education. After adjustment was made for marital status and education, the remaining variables (ethnicity, parity, age, and employment status) did not influence the initiation of breast-feeding in this low-income population. The need for vigorous promotion of breast-feeding by the Georgia WIC program is emphasized by the low rate of initiation and short duration of breast-feeding in this low-income population.\r"

Liver transplant patients had significantly lower scores on nonverbal intelligence tests (mean +/- SD for liver transplant vs cystic fibrosis patients: 89.1 +/- 19.1 vs 105.8 +/- 17.6), lower academic achievement, and lower zeta scores for age in the areas of learning and memory (-0.68 +/- 1.09 vs 0.19 +/- 1.24), abstraction and concept formation (-1.73 +/- 1.58 vs -0.79 +/- 1.37), visual-spatial function (-0.66 +/- 1.09 vs 0.10 +/- 0.69), and motor function (-0.13 +/- 0.85 vs 0.36 +/- 0.57). No differences were found on tests of verbal intelligence, or in alertness and concentration, perceptual-motor, and sensory-perceptual areas. Cyclosporine levels were found to correlate positively with motor speed (r = .41, P less than .05). Thorough psycho-educational and neuropsychological evaluations should be considered for pediatric patients who receive liver transplantation to allow these children to maximize their potential.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of the timing of surfactant replacement therapy for the treatment of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome was evaluated in a study of 182 neonates of less than 30 weeks' gestation who were randomly assigned prior to delivery to one of three study groups: control (dummy instillation of air given at birth), early surfactant (surfactant given at birth), or late surfactant (surfactant given at less than 6 hours of age). Subjects in the late surfactant group could avoid treatment if they had a clear chest roentgenogram and required no supplemental oxygen at a mean airway pressure of less than 7 cm of water. All treated neonates were eligible to receive up to three additional doses during the first 5 days of life. The three groups were comparable with respect to birth weight, gestational age, and other perinatal parameters with the exception of a lower cord arterial pH and 1-minute Apgar score in the early surfactant group. Of the 60 neonates randomly assigned to late treatment, 29 (48%) were deemed surfactant sufficient and thereby avoided treatment; the other 31 received their first dose at a mean age of 2.9 hours. There was a significant improvement in gas exchange during the first week of life in both surfactant groups compared with the control group, reflected by differences in fraction of inspired oxygen, arterial/alveolar PO2, and ventilation index (peak pressure x rate on the ventilator) (P less than .001). Surfactant therapy also resulted in a lower incidence of pulmonary air leak and severe chronic lung disease (defined as requirement for respiratory support beyond 36 weeks post-conceptional age). There were no differences between early and late surfactant groups in any of these parameters. The only statistically significant difference between the surfactant groups was that the early group had a higher incidence of mild chronic lung disease (respiratory support beyond 28 days of age) than the late treatment group (P less than .005). Neonates in the late treatment group were extubated earlier and had a shorter neonatal intensive care unit stay than control neonates (P less than .05), whereas those in the early group were not significantly different from control neonates in these parameters. It is concluded that replacement therapy with bovine lung surfactant extract in neonates of less than 30 weeks' gestation results in decreased oxygen and ventilatory requirements during the first week of life and a lower incidence of pulmonary air leak and severe chronic lung disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Lack of information about treatment options can exacerbate the crisis for the family. The treatment modalities available to the family generally depend on the child's specific limb deficiency or deficiencies. Surgery to reconstruct the deficiency is not a workable option for many patients because of abnormal joints and soft tissues. Amputation may be recommended for patients whose deficiency is difficult or impossible to manage prosthetically. Limb lengthening is an option only for patients whose bones are smaller than normal. Prosthetics are the most widely used treatment modality because they immediately equalize limb lengths and improve function. When a baby is born with a congenital limb deficiency, the initial response of the parents is shock and denial. In adjusting to their newborn, they must first mourn the loss of the baby they expected. Once the adjustment process begins, specific information about the limb deficiency and the treatment options should be available. Family adjustment to the child is a continual process. As the child grows, management strategies need to change to adjust to the child's changing needs. With appropriate and timely health care and family intervention, a child with a congenital limb deficiency can be a happy, successful person.\r"

Patients requiring hospitalization for orthopedic procedures now have shorter lengths of stay. The brevity of stay means that a great deal of coordination, education, and referral efforts are necessary before the patient's discharge. Prepared discharge programs, with the nurse assuming the coordinator role, are one way of ensuring that patients are ready to make the transition from the hospital to their postdischarge environment.\r"

Clusters of symptoms have also been discussed representing the expected normal patterns. With this knowledge as a foundation, clinical application is essential to incorporate other salient aspects of individual situations. Nurses diagnose and treat human responses to health problems. The end result of human responses to injury or orthopedic conditions can be the development of complications. Stringent adherence to patient monitoring protocols can promote timely nursing interventions to prevent, minimize, or detect complications or treatment side effects. Although definitive treatment is often physician directed, nurses are in a key role to impact final patient outcomes.\r"

Metabolic adaptations include an increase in oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle (greater number and size of mitochondria); an increase in skeletal muscle myoglobin concentration; a greater ability to oxidize fatty acids for energy; and an increase in stored glycogen. Cardiovascular effects of training include a decrease in resting heart rate and heart rate response to submaximal exercise; an increase in resting and exercise stroke volume; an increase in maximal cardiac output; an increase in VO2max; and an increase in arteriovenous oxygen difference. Aerobic exercise training contributes to cardiovascular fitness, because it beneficially alters the coronary artery disease risk profile. An inverse relationship exists between physical fitness and resting heart rate, body weight, percent body fat, serum cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, and systolic blood pressure. In addition, exercise training increases the high-density lipoprotein fraction of total cholesterol. Endurance exercise is any activity that uses large muscle groups, can be performed continuously, and is rhythmic and aerobic in nature. To develop and maintain cardiovascular fitness, this exercise should be performed at a frequency of 3 to 5 days per week, an intensity of 60% to 90% HRmax or 50% to 85% HRmax reserve, and a duration of 20 to 60 minutes.\r"

  ".W": "The advantages of arthroscopic reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament tear over arthrotomy are quite obvious: reduced pain and morbidity. Some arthroscopists are performing these procedures on an outpatient basis. The physician can choose from several graft substitutes for anterior cruciate ligament replacement. Autografts consisting of the iliotibial band, semitendinosus, gracilis, and meniscus have been used as grafts. The most common autograft is the bone-patellar tendon-bone, which has been used since 1930 and has been shown to have a tensile strength near that of the anterior cruciate ligament. The state of the art in surgical alternatives for anterior cruciate ligament tears is arthroscopic reconstruction using the midthird of the patellar tendon. Treatment of anterior cruciate ligament injuries requires prompt and adequate evaluation of the laxity of the ligament as well as other structures in the knee, appropriate treatment options offered to the patient with complete descriptions of knee function after each treatment option, and comprehensive rehabilitation program. Patient compliance is an integral part of the success of this procedure. The nurse must include a description of the injury, preoperative testing, surgical intervention, and rehabilitation program when educating the patient. The successful postoperative anterior cruciate ligament rehabilitation program is multifaceted. In general, there must be specific guidelines applied by a physical therapist who has knowledge of the surgical procedure, understands principles of ligament healing, and has the ability to individualize the program as needed. For any level of athlete or active person, there must be achievement of all goals per phase to a high performance level. In addition, there must always be objective measurements to document progress to the physical therapist and physician but, perhaps most importantly, to reassure the patient that normalcy is being restored.\r"

Adequate warm-up and cool-down is important to prevent muscle injuries that may contribute to stress fractures later on. The athlete should be aware of not \"over-doing it\" because fatigue is a contributing factor to the stress injury rate. Proper dress and equipment are necessary. Using the basic methods of prevention, along with good sportsmanship, safe participation in any sport may be anticipated. Because the demands and expectations of our high-performance athletes are more prevalent, education and rehabilitation of the sports-injured patient have become ever important. With the emergence of sports medicine as a discipline, injured athletes are returned to the playing arenas much more rapidly with newer protocols and techniques. We must be ready rapidly to assess, diagnose, and treat all sports injuries; however, we must be aware and alert to the possibility that it is an injury of \"wear and tear\" when making any diagnosis and prescribing any treatment regime.\r"

Whether the patient is braced or surgery is recommended, there is a lot of teaching, assessing, and compassion when dealing with adolescents whose biggest concern is being like their peers. It is important to allow as much independence in decision making as possible, whether it be about bracing or surgical intervention, as long as they clearly understand the consequences. Newer, better surgical instruments, anesthesia, nursing care, and postoperative mobility all have changed the management of the operative scoliosis patient significantly. Nursing assessment of neurologic, respiratory, function, emotional, and developmental needs of the adolescent patient, however, have not changed. If we, as nurses, understand the rationale for assessments, treatments, and restrictions, we can teach our patients and their families.\r"

In addition, many health care recommendations are aimed at maximizing peak bone mass and preventing bone loss to decrease the chance of hip fracture. New studies are evaluating the efficacy of experimental medications to rebuild bone mass once osteoporosis has developed. Current prevention guidelines include adequate calcium and vitamin D intake and moderate exercise. At menopause, estrogen replacement therapy is recommended for those younger than 50 years or considered at high risk for developing osteoporosis. All people are encouraged to decrease the risk of fracture by evaluating their home environment for hazards that might contribute to falls. Nursing needs to develop new strategies and interventions to educate the public about osteoporosis, improve the quality of life for persons with osteoporosis, and decrease the osteoporotic hip fracture mortality rate.

Symptoms of back and leg pain appear gradually usually over a period of years and slowly worsen. Patients are usually in their 50s or older. Most patients are treated initially with nonoperative measures concentrating on pain relief and maintenance of activity. If the symptoms worsen, surgical intervention to relieve pain by decompressing the affected nerve roots is appropriate. Some patients with instability require a fusion. Most patients are satisfied with the results of surgery in relieving preoperative leg pain. Pain relief is often dramatic, allowing most patients to return to normal activity. Elderly patients tolerate this procedure surprisingly well. Old age alone should not be a contra-indication for this surgery. Therefore, the elderly should not be denied the benefits of surgical decompression. Nursing interventions can help these patients learn about spinal stenosis and assist them in pursuing appropriate treatment resulting in improved quality of living.\r"

Interest in the disease has been catapulted forward by the dramatic increase in the number of elderly persons, the most rapidly expanding segment of the population. As the proportion of the aged population grows, so too will the medical and social consequences of the disease. Thus far, the most substantial leads in the search for a cause of Alzheimer's disease have been in the areas of genetic, biochemical, and epidemiologic research. While certain environmental factors such as aluminum have provoked interest, their role remains controversial.\r"

Treatment should begin with attempts to reduce weight through diet and exercise. In fact, diet and exercise should be stressed as vital components of a diabetic patient's life-style no matter what treatment method is used. Drug treatment may consist of a sulfonylurea to increase insulin secretion and improve insulin resistance or of exogenous insulin to achieve glucose control and avoid the dangers of chronic hyperglycemia. A combination of the two appears attractive but is still under investigation. Control of hypertension is mandatory and may require use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or calcium channel blocker. Normalization of serum lipid levels is also important in these patients, and agents that adversely affect glucose levels must be avoided.\r"

That the corresponding gene is located in the eliminated portion of the genome indicates a difference in germ-line and somatic ribosomes of A. lumbricoides and P. equorum. Elimination of the ALEP-1 gene from all somatic cells in its fully active state may represent an alternative way to gene regulation.\r"

In the tree relating those types, most of the branching events occur about two-thirds of the way from the root of the tree to the tips of the branches. Moreover, the distribution of sequence differences between all possible pairs of individuals is approximately Poisson. Other non-African populations show a similar pattern. Assuming a neutral model, these findings imply that the probability of survival of new lineages has undergone dramatic changes, probably due to population expansion. Conversely, African populations show multimodal distributions fitting with a model of constant population size.\r"

  ".U": "91156659\r", 
  ".W": "The macrophage mannose receptor, a 172-kDa lineage-specific glycoprotein, partakes in nonopsonin-mediated phagocytosis by recognition of terminal mannose residues on targeted particles. Because appearance of the receptor progresses with monocyte/macrophage differentiation, its expression is indicative of the maturational state of the cell. Monomeric IgG2a and IgG2b up-regulate mannose-receptor surface expression and biosynthesis by murine bone-marrow macrophage precursors as much as 7- to 12-fold in a dose-dependent manner. IgG2a accelerates macrophage mannose-receptor expression by several days during in vitro bone-marrow differentiation; however, treated and control cells ultimately express equivalent levels of receptor. Moreover, the effect is independent of cell cycle or ambient levels of colony-stimulating factor 1. The coinduction of another maturation-dependent lineage-specific antigen, F4/80, and the fact that macrophage precursors respond to IgG2a only within the first day of culture, indicate that the targeted cell is an early myelomonocytic precursor, responsive only during a short, early developmental window. The effect is specific for immunoglobulin molecules of the IgG2a and IgG2b subclasses and probably involves an Fc gamma-receptor signal-transduction pathway but not macrophage priming or activation. Most importantly, a paracrine mechanism of immunoglobulin-mediated bone-marrow macrophage differentiation is suggested by experiments in which basal levels of mannose-receptor expression are reduced by continual removal of B-cell-generated IgG from marrow cultures. Thus, IgG2a and IgG2b prompt mannose-receptor synthesis and bone-marrow macrophage differentiation and may, therefore, play a role in the regulation of macrophage differentiation in host defense.\r"

  ".W": "The existence and neuroanatomical locations of separate extrastriate visual pathways for object recognition and spatial localization were investigated in healthy young men. Regional cerebral blood flow was measured by positron emission tomography and bolus injections of H2(15)O, while subjects performed face matching, dot-location matching, or sensorimotor control tasks. Both visual matching tasks activated lateral occipital cortex. Face discrimination alone activated a region of occipitotemporal cortex that was anterior and inferior to the occipital area activated by both tasks. The spatial location task alone activated a region of lateral superior parietal cortex. Perisylvian and anterior temporal cortices were not activated by either task. These results demonstrate the existence of three functionally dissociable regions of human visual extrastriate cortex. The ventral and dorsal locations of the regions specialized for object recognition and spatial localization, respectively, suggest some homology between human and nonhuman primate extrastriate cortex, with displacement in human brain, possibly related to the evolution of phylogenetically newer cortical areas.\r"
