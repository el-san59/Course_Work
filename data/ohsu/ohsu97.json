Considering a greater than or equal to 5 mm Hg fall in PAP after breathing 28 percent oxygen for 24 hours to be a significant response to oxygen administration, 25 and 18 patients were identified as responders (R) and nonresponders (NR), respectively. Oxygen consumption at the end of a symptom-limited maximum exercise (Vo2 peak) and right (RVEF) and left ventricular (LVEF) ejection fractions by nuclide ventriculography (NVG) were also obtained, and the changes (delta) in RVEF and LVEF after 48 hours of oxygen breathing recorded. All patients were prescribed continuous long-term domiciliary oxygen therapy (CLTO) and followed up as outpatients. Thirty-three patients have completed the follow-up for three years or until their deaths. The R showed a markedly higher survival compared to the NR at 1, 2, and 3 years. A high Vo2 peak (greater than 6.5 ml min-1 kg-1) was significantly associated with R status and also predicted two- and three-year survival. A baseline EF or delta EF of right or left ventricles could not be used to predict either the response of PAP to O2 or the long-term survival, although delta LVEF was significantly higher in the R. Response of PAP to breathing O2 for 24 hours is a reliable indicator of at least three-year survival with CLTO, which can be predicted noninvasively by baseline Vo2 peak.\r"

Nifedipine decreased resting mean pulmonary artery (PA) pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in patients with Raynaud's phenomenon (delta PA - 6.8 +/- 10.5 mm Hg; delta PAD - PCW gradient - 9.3 +/- 4.7 mm Hg; delta PVR - 255 +/- 201 dynes.s.cm-5, all p less than .05) versus (delta PA 0.3 +/- 4.0 mm Hg; delta PAD - PCW gradient 0.4 +/- 5.0 mm Hg; delta PVR - 58 +/- 132 dynes.sec.cm-5, all NS), in the patients without Raynaud syndrome. These data suggest that patients with both primary and secondary PAH may benefit from nifedipine therapy, but that patients with Raynaud's phenomenon may respond particularly well, perhaps because of vasodilator-reversible pulmonary vasoconstriction. An alternative hypothesis is that prior chronic vasodilator therapy in the majority of our patients with Raynaud's phenomenon preserved pulmonary vasoreactivity.\r"

Nocturnal oxygen therapy might be beneficial to such individuals by improving oxygenation and relieving tissue hypoxia. Twenty-eight asymptomatic heavy snoring men were recruited for polysomnographic monitoring during sleep. During the first half-night, air was breathed through a nasal cannula, and during the latter half-night, 2 L/min oxygen was administered. Breathing air, 20 subjects demonstrated sleep apneas, hypopneas and nocturnal oxygen desaturation. Eighteen subjects had more than ten apneas plus hypopneas per hour. Thirteen subjects reached low oxygen saturation below 80 percent and eight below 70 percent. Only 13 of the 20 subjects showed improvement with oxygen therapy. Apneas alone were not decreased in frequency and were lengthened with oxygen therapy. Episodes of oxygen desaturation were improved by oxygen therapy and consequently, rates of hypopnea were decreased. Severe sleep apnea, hypopnea and oxygen desaturation are common in asymptomatic male snorers, and oxygen therapy is not always beneficial.\r"

All ten analyzers had high precision; this magnified small differences between observed results and target values. Grand mean results from all ten analyzers were within 0.8 mm Hg of the target for PO2 of 40.0 and 100.0 and for PCO2 of 20.0 and 70.0 mm Hg. Eight automated blood gas analyzers gave clinically indistinguishable results for PO2 and PCO2 that were sufficiently accurate for clinical purposes. Also reported is the practicality of using tonometry of fresh heparinized blood in a per shift quality control program for PO2 and PCO2.\r"

We made the assumption that, when an asthmatic patient calls an emergency care unit, the attack is severe and might be fatal. A prospective study was performed during a six-month period to prevent these asthma deaths: 259 calls from asthmatic patients were received. For each emergency call from asthmatic patients, paramedical help (delay: 5.1 +/- 0.3 minutes) and an emergency care ambulance (delay: 9.7 +/- 0.6 minutes) were immediately sent. Only four patients died during this period. Emergency calls from asthmatic patients must be considered as related to a severe attack that might be fatal. Fatal asthma is often related to a severe attack that evolves rapidly. Some asthmatic patients are able to assess the severity of asthma attacks, and prehospital emergency care schemes for asthmatic patients are actually able to prevent some asthma deaths.\r"

Two hundred three patients over a two-year period were identified who satisfied the following criteria. All had symptom-limited upright treadmill exercise tests with stress and redistribution thallium imaging, as well as coronary angiography within two months of the Th-TMT. Of 58 patients with CAD not on BB, 52 had an abnormal Th-TMT scan (sensitivity 90 percent). In comparison, the sensitivity of the Th-TMT scan in the 88 patients with CAD receiving BB was 76 percent (p less than 0.05). We conclude that BB may significantly decrease the sensitivity of the Th-TMT. Physicians should fully appreciate the higher false negative rate (24 vs 10 percent) for patients on BB and consider cautious withdrawal prior to diagnostic studies.\r"

A population of 658 asbestos-exposed workers was divided into six groups (restrictive, mixed restrictive-obstructive, obstructive, abnormal diffusing capacity, small airway disease, and normal) based upon pulmonary function test results. Use of two commonly employed prediction equations for diffusing capacity produced divergent results. Adjustment of the forced vital capacity for airtrapping based upon measurement of residual volume or of total lung capacity can improve the accuracy of categorization, particularly in smokers. Hence, the process of interpretation of pulmonary function testing should be chosen carefully.\r"

The NK cell activity in tuberculous pleural effusions was the same as that in peripheral blood, while in carcinomatous pleural effusions, NK cell activity was lower than in peripheral blood; however, NK cell activity was much higher in tuberculous than in carcinomatous pleural effusions.

Cartilaginous CAM should be distinguished from another lesion with abundant cartilage, the so-called pulmonary hamartoma.\r"

With subsequent lowering of PWP to 10 mm Hg, intravenously administered furosemide (1 mg/kg) was given to these 11 dogs. One half hour after furosemide, shunt decreased slightly without decreasing EVLW in all 11 dogs, but by two hours, seven dogs (group 1) decreased EVLW (from 23.2 +/- 1.8 to 11.1 +/- 1.4 ml/kg) and shunt (37.4 +/- 2.0 to 12.9 +/- 2.9 percent), while four dogs (group 2) did not (EVLW: 22.3 +/- 1.4 to 22.5 +/- 0.6 ml/kg: shunt, 36.8 +/- 1.7 to 36.5 +/- 1.9 percent).

After decreasing PWP in massive pulmonary edema (triple baseline EVLW), furosemide appeared to enhance edema clearance by changes in COP with diuresis.\r"

  ".W": "Over the past decade, the management of patients with acute myocardial infarction has undergone remarkable change due in part to the availability of new diagnostic and therapeutic modalities. Many of these techniques have gained widespread acceptance and use without the benefit of studies demonstrating efficacy. A survey of 391 members of the Section on Clinical Cardiology of the American College of Chest Physicians was conducted to assess current practice patterns in the management of acute myocardial infarction. Significant differences in the routine (greater than or equal to 50 percent of the time) use of various management approaches were found, with exercise tolerance testing, echocardiography, Holter monitoring, and cardiac rehabilitation frequently employed, whereas electrophysiologic studies, pyrophosphate scans, pulmonary artery catheterization, and cardiac pacing were infrequently used. Significant differences in the use of these procedures were noted with regard to the age of the physician and his or her geographic location of practice. These differences in practice patterns indicate that physicians have not reached consensus with regard to the value of these new diagnostic procedures and therapeutic approaches in the treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction. Given the incremental costs of these procedures, clinical trials to assess their efficacy are clearly indicated.\r"

Long-term steroid treatment and previous pelvic radiotherapy were associated with increased risk of leakage. Severe stenosis following anastomotic leakage was seen in one patient. Intraoperative diverting colostomy was done in 16 patients, but no benefit could be demonstrated. It was concluded that use of the upper sigmoid colon for anastomosis probably is not associated with a higher mortality and morbidity than that after more extensive resections reported in the literature. Future randomized trials should exclude very old patients, in whom no leak was seen, when the upper sigmoid colon was used for stapling after low anterior resection.\r"

In 43 percent, a decrease of CEA could be observed after polypectomy, while it increased in 22 percent or remained unchanged in 35 percent. No correlation was found between adenoma volume and serum CEA. There was a tendency toward a higher serum CEA level in patients with villous adenoma as compared with those with tubular structure. CEA concentrations were independent from the degree of cellular atypia, but polypectomy was followed by a decrease of serum CEA in villous adenoma or of moderate cellular atypia, reflecting a possible influence on production or shedding of CEA by these subtypes of adenoma. The results indicate, therefore, that serum CEA is not able to recognize the malignant potential of colorectal adenoma.\r"

No statistically significant associations were found between those with a family history of colorectal cancer and age at detection, sex, country of birth, religion, number of cancers (single, synchronous, or metachronous), previously removed benign colorectal polyps, and adenomatous polyps found in the resection specimen. The family history rate of colorectal cancer for colon cancer cases was statistically significantly higher than for rectal cancer cases (chi 2(1) = 3.8, P = .05) and there was a gradient of decreasing risk from colon to rectum. The family history rate of colorectal cancer in parents of those who were less than 50 years old was twice that of those 50 or older (P = .07), consistent with the view that earlier age of onset is a characteristic of those with a family history of colorectal cancer. There was a statistically significantly higher family history rate of colorectal cancer in respondents who knew of the disease compared with those who did not (chi 2(1) = 5.5, P less than .05). It is unclear if this effect represents recall bias or self-selection bias. In contrast, the rates for a family history of heart disease and stroke were similar, irrespective of the respondent's knowledge of their colorectal cancer status. Thus in the Melbourne study, the family history rate of colorectal cancer was higher in colon cancer than in rectal cancer, there was a decreasing gradient of risk from colon to rectum, and a tendency for earlier age of onset of colorectal cancer in those with a history of this cancer in a parent.\r"

Five of the 16 fecal CEA-positive patients showed no elevation of plasma CEA levels. Measurements using a commercial CEA kit (Abbott Laboratories) could not detect the differences between fecal CEA values of patients with colorectal carcinoma and benign diseases, or those of normal volunteers.

Electromyogram evidence of paradoxical puborectalis contraction was observed in 38 (76 percent), ten (48 percent), and four (50 percent) of these patients, respectively. All patients with solitary rectal ulcer syndrome had difficulty defecating; defecation was normal in all patients with perineal pain.

The actual significance of these symptoms is difficult to determine at present. Further assessment of the quality of life in individuals with restorative proctocolectomy in comparison with subjects undergoing alternative surgical treatments is recommended.\r"

In five of 22 patients, the sputum samples were reported to be unsatisfactory for cytodiagnosis. Of the remaining 17, nine patients had at least one positive result for metastatic adenocarcinoma and in two additional cases the sample showed atypical cells. The result was therefore positive or atypical in 11 of 17 patients (65 percent). The positive cytology rate reported (79 percent for multiple pulmonary metastases) represents an improvement compared with previously published work. In this study 14 patients had either one or two samples collected for cytology and it is likely that the positivity rate would have been higher if three samples had been collected.\r"

One set of seven dogs was fed a meat meal (35 g/kg body weight) before and after truncal vagotomy and after truncal vagotomy plus celiac and superior mesenteric ganglionectomy, ie, extrinsic denervation of the pancreas and the upper gastrointestinal tract. In another set of six dogs, only ganglionectomy was performed. Experiments were repeated in the presence of atropine (50 micrograms/kg body weight, given as an intravenous bolus 60 min prior to the meal). Truncal vagotomy significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced the postprandial 120-min integrated plasma PP response (IPPPR) by 84% as compared to the prevagotomy response. Before truncal vagotomy, atropine significantly reduced the IPPPR by 57%. After truncal vagotomy, atropine completely abolished the residual PP response. Additional celiac and superior mesenteric ganglionectomy did not alter the IPPPR already reduced by truncal vagotomy. With the vagus nerves intact, ganglionectomy alone had no effect on the IPPPR whether or not atropine was given. These findings indicate that (1) the splanchnic nerves do not play a significant role in postprandial PP release and (2) that the vagus nerves are important mediators of the response to a meal. The effect of atropine on postprandial PP release after truncal vagotomy may be due to interruption of short enteropancreatic reflexes, suppression of the intrinsic cholinergic activity of the pancreas, or inhibition of hormonally induced PP release.\r"

We report a case of milk of calcium bile in which preexisting gallbladder stasis was retrospectively evaluated by reviewing plain abdominal films and by using iodide as a marker for retained contrast. This latter approach was validated by demonstrating that obstructed gallbladders do not physiologically sequester iodide and that following oral cholecystography functioning gallbladders do not retain significant iodide for prolonged periods. In the case described, we propose that gallbladder stasis was present as long as 2 1/2 years prior to the diagnosis of milk of calcium bile.\r"

It smoothes digitized data with a moving average filter, computes difference scores between successive groups of three data points, and uses the signs of these difference scores to detect the beginning and end of waves. Adjacent waves are merged if their means are closer than 1.67 times the sum of their standard deviations, and amplitude and duration criteria are used to exclude nonsignificant waves. When compared to four experienced human scorers on randomly selected records, the program agreed as well with the human scorers as they agreed with each other, and it approached the level of agreement of these observers with themselves when they were asked to rescore the same records blindly four to six weeks later. Human scorers agreed with themselves on 36-71% of myoelectric slow waves and on 42-88% of pressure waves, compared to 100% test-retest reliability for the pattern-recognition program. Frequency histograms of the duration of waves detected by the pattern-recognition program differed from the spectra generated by the fast Fourier transform (FFT) method. This pattern-recognition program provides an alternative to spectral analysis for the reliable and objective quantification of colonic myoelectric slow waves and pressure waves.\r"

Immediately after the procedure, all patients were examined radiographically by injection of contrast material into the lower esophagus through a nasoesophageal tube. Two immediate and two delayed perforations occurred. Six intramural hematomas were noted, five of which resolved spontaneously. The luminal diameter at the esophagogastric junction increased from a mean of 4.2 mm before dilatation to 7.5 mm following treatment. Four patients with previous Heller myotomy were dilated without complications. Perforation was more common in patients with a minimal change in the esophagogastric diameter. Thirty-five patients (85%) improved symptomatically within several days following pneumatic dilatation. Excluding patients with perforation, the postdilatation appearance of the lower esophagus poorly correlated with clinical response.\r"

Because the test is noninvasive, it should be more acceptable to children and their parents than the intubation test and thus could be used to conduct studies which are currently impractical.\r"

However, limited information is available about the long-term follow-up of these patients. In this study we performed esophageal and pulmonary function studies on 12 adults who had required surgical repair of these defects in the first week of life. Most patients had symptoms of dysphagia and heartburn at time of evaluation. Pathologic gastroesophageal reflux was documented in 67% of patients and esophagitis was noted in 34%. All patients had esophageal motility abnormalities characterized by low-amplitude nonperistaltic waves throughout most of the esophagus. In addition, although most patients had no respiratory symptoms, mild restrictive lung volumes were noted in many patients. However, airflow obstruction and airway hyperreactivity were not present. These data demonstrate that clinical symptoms and abnormal esophageal manometry and pulmonary function persist well into the third and beginning of the fourth decade after repair of esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula in infancy.\r"

Currently, the bile acids chenodeoxycholic (CDCA) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) are being used for dissolution of cholesterol gallstones in surgical high-risk patients. The effect of prolonged exogenous bile acid intake on rectal epithelial cell proliferation, as a marker for preneoplasia, was evaluated in 19 patients selected for treatment. They were divided into two groups: nine patients received CDCA, 15 mg/kg/day for a mean duration of 11.0 months, while 11 patients received UDCA, 10 mg/kg/day for a mean duration of 9.2 months. Rectal biopsies taken before treatment and at one, three, six, and 12 months of treatment were analyzed and evaluated by three proliferative parameters including labeling index (LI), distribution of labeled cells, and total cells per crypt column. No significant alterations in epithelial cell proliferation were observed among patients treated with UDCA or CDCA with the exception of the number of cells per crypt column which, in the latter instance, deviated only slightly from the predicted values. The lack of major persistent alterations in the proliferative behavior of rectal epithelial cells does not justify any change in the selection of patients for gallstone therapy, but cannot exclude the potentially deleterious long-term effects of bile acid treatment.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of these studies was to determine the role played by endogenous prostaglandins in the development of gastric ulcers produced by indomethacin, and of duodenal ulcers produced by mepirizole in rats. Indomethacin (10 mg/kg subcutaneously) produced gastric ulcers, whereas mepirizole (100 mg/kg subcutaneously) produced exclusively duodenal ulcers. Both drugs, given at ulcerogenic doses, reduced the gastric and duodenal generation of PGE2, PGF2 alpha, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, and thromboxane B2. In this regard, the extent of reduction was more pronounced after indomethacin than after mepirizole. Despite this greater inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by indomethacin, this drug did not produce duodenal ulcers, whereas mepirizole was duodenoulcerogenic. In addition, mepirizole increased gastric acid secretion by 74%, whereas indomethacin had no effect on acid secretion. Oral administration of 16,16-dimethyl PGE2, given at nonantisecretory doses (0.5-5 micrograms/kg), prevented formation of indomethacin-induced gastric ulcers, whereas antisecretory doses were required to prevent formation of mepirizole-induced duodenal ulcers. We conclude that a reduction of prostaglandin formation in the duodenal mucosa is not by itself sufficient to induce duodenal ulcers. We hypothesize that three changes, produced by mepirizole, must be present for duodenal ulcers to develop: increased gastric acid secretion, decreased duodenal bicarbonate secretion (as demonstrated earlier), and decreased duodenal content of prostaglandins. The decreased prostaglandin formation, although not causing duodenal ulcers, may lower the resistance of duodenal mucosa to the hyperacidity induced by mepirizole. On the other hand, in the case of gastric ulcers following administration of indomethacin, a decrease in gastric mucosal levels of prostaglandins may play a more important role than changes in gastric acidity.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, we demonstrated that spaghetti caused a significantly lower glycemic response in isoinsulinemic insulin-dependent diabetic (IDDM) subjects than an exchangeable amount of potato. The question is, however, whether the difference of the glucose response in IDDM patients is preserved if these carbohydrate-rich foods are taken as part of a mixed meal. To answer this question, we evaluated blood glucose, free-insulin, and glucagon responses to exchangeable amounts of spaghetti and potato when ingested together with bolognese sauce in seven IDDM patients who had attained euglycemia with the artificial pancreas before meal intake. The potato (200 g raw wt) with bolognese sauce (167 g) and spaghetti (50 g raw wt) with bolognese sauce (167 g) had approximately identical caloric content (435 and 447 kcal, respectively), fat (18 g each), protein (23 and 26 g, respectively), and carbohydrate (47 and 48 g, respectively). Blood glucose increment after white spaghetti and bolognese sauce was only approximately 50% of that seen in response to potato and bolognese sauce. Similar constant insulin levels and increments in glucagon were seen. A major determinant of the postmeal glucose rise in IDDM patients seems to be dependent on the kind of carbohydrate in the meal. The approach by which the insulinemia was kept constant by the artificial pancreas seems to be a valuable tool for studying glycemic responses to different meals in IDDM patients who otherwise show great variations in circulating insulin and glucose levels when treated by subcutaneously administered insulin.\r"

In this study the effects of a restricted-protein diet on kidney function in type I diabetic patients with clinical nephropathy were evaluated. Sixteen patients (9 men, 7 women) with mean age 37.1 +/- 9.8 yr, mean duration of diabetes 17.7 +/- 6.6 yr, proteinuria greater than 0.5 g/24 h, and serum creatinine concentration of 0.7-1.9 mg/dl were studied. Patients were randomly divided into two groups. The low-protein diet (LPD) group comprised seven patients who were kept for 4.5 +/- 1 mo on a diet containing 0.71 +/- 0.12 g X kg-1 X day-1 protein. The normal-protein diet (NPD) group comprised nine patients as controls maintained for 11.7 +/- 7 mo on their usual diabetic diet containing 1.44 +/- 0.12 g X kg-1 X day-1 protein. All patients were studied every 1-2 mo. Metabolic control was assessed by evaluation of 5-8 blood glucose determinations/day and by glycosylated hemoglobin, whereas renal function was evaluated by albumin, IgG and beta 2-microglobulin urinary excretion rates, serum creatinine concentration, and creatinine clearance. At each visit, serum concentrations of total protein, albumin, phosphate, calcium, and electrolytes and weight and blood pressure were also measured. A significant reduction (434 +/- 244 to 205 +/- 212 micrograms/min, mean +/- SD) in albumin excretion rate was found in all LPD patients after dietary protein restriction, with a significant reincrease (689 +/- 201 micrograms/min) in the same patients several months after interruption of diet.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The overall correlation of single-void sample results expressed as microgram albumin per milligram creatinine with 24-h excretion (mg/24 h) was excellent (r = .82, P less than .001). More important, in the diabetic patients the sensitivity and specificity of detecting 24-h microalbuminuria in the abnormal range were at least 94 and 96%, respectively. Single-void urine specimens adjusted for creatinine discriminate between normal and abnormal levels of microalbuminuria, as determined in 24-h urine collection, with high specificity and sensitivity.\r"

Measurements of renal protein clearance were performed serially, and the time course of proteinuria was classified in each subject based on a threshold albumin clearance of 11 nl/s, equivalent to a urinary albumin excretion rate of 30 micrograms/min. The classification based on this threshold yielded four distinct patterns of albuminuria: minimal, intermittent, progressing, and established. These patterns occurred in both type I and type II diabetics independently of the duration of follow-up. This study has identified a pattern of intermittent microalbuminuria that is also associated with transient elevations of transferrin and IgG clearances. The relationship of clinical and biochemical parameters to proteinuria patterns was evaluated. No relationship was detected between proteinuria patterns and glycemic control in either type I or type II diabetics. In type I but not type II diabetics, established proteinuria was associated with higher systolic blood pressure and decreased creatinine clearance. The phase of intermittent proteinuria detected in this study may represent a reversible stage in the development of diabetic nephropathy, but the factors that trigger the transition to progressing proteinuria remain obscure.\r"

The percentage of patients that were abnormal varied considerably depending on criteria for abnormality and the tests used. Abnormality (greater than or equal to 3 SD of 1 or more parameters) of NC of one or more of four nerves occurred in 80%, of two or more in 69%, of three or more in 46%, and of four in 21%.

Thermal sensitivity at the dorsolateral aspect of the foot (Pfizer thermal tester) correlated significantly with vibration thresholds (Somedic vibrameter) at three sites in the foot and two in the hand. Forty patients had normal sensory thresholds, but 18 of these lacked an MPSAP. Smaller groups had a single abnormal sensory threshold: 12 (18%) had an abnormal vibration threshold, and 24 (35%) had abnormal thermal sensitivity; 8 of the former group and 17 of the latter group lacked an MPSAP response. Only 8 (12%) had both abnormal vibration and thermal sensation (6 without an MPSAP). Fifteen of the 17 symptomatic patients had lost the MPSAP, but there was no consistent pattern of sensory loss. In this relatively young group of diabetics, more patients showed absent MPSAP responses than an abnormality in either sensory test on its own. The MPSAP is frequently absent in patients with no abnormalities in psychophysical tests of peripheral large-fiber function (vibration sensation) and small-fiber function (thermal sensitivity).\r"

After an initial 7- to 14-day period of in-hospital insulin-dose adjustment, all subjects were similarly followed as outpatients during both infusion periods, with a minimum of four daily preprandial self-measurements of blood glucose.

Among the diabetic patients, staphylococcal colonization was not significantly correlated (P greater than .05) with recent antibiotic treatment, age, race, or clinical duration of diabetes but was inversely correlated (P less than .03) with glycemic control, as measured by fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels. Hospitalization in the previous year was also associated with staphylococcal colonization, and it was significantly more common among the diabetic patients than the controls; however, this did not account for the increased colonization rates observed. Our results in a well-characterized population confirm an increased rate of staphylococcal colonization among diabetic as compared with nondiabetic outpatients but demonstrate that neither injections of insulin nor various pertinent demographic factors explain this finding.\r"

After adjustment for age and body mass index, only the waist/thighs ratio was found to have an independent discriminating value between insulin-dependent (IDDM) and non-insulin-dependent (NIDDM) diabetic patients. The correlation of type of diabetes with the waist/thighs ratio was especially strong in women, exceeding even the role of age and body mass index.

After pupil dilation lenses were examined for the presence and severity of nuclear sclerotic and posterior subcapsular cataracts and for surgical aphakia. A history of aspirin usage was obtained. Seven hundred eighty-four individuals had used aspirin in the month before the exam. There was no relationship between such usage and cataracts. For 338 people who reported using aspirin daily for at least 3 mo while having diabetes, there was also no association. These data suggest that aspirin usage as measured here has little effect on the prevalence of cataract in older-onset diabetic patients.\r"

Both convulsions and age of onset were associated with poorer performance on spatial tasks. Girls with EOD had lower spatial test scores regardless of convulsion history, whereas boys with EOD scored lower only if they had had a convulsion.\r"

They may present with either genital or nongenital signs and symptoms. Most individuals are treated as outpatients, but more than a quarter of a million hospital admissions for STDs are necessary each year. These numbers will rise precipitously as the number of AIDS cases increases. More than 10,000 deaths per year are caused by STDs, primarily because of AIDS, cervical carcinoma, and hepatitis B induced cirrhosis and hepatoma. Physicians must become highly skilled in the diagnosis and treatment of the common STDs caused by herpes simplex virus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Chlamydia trachomatis. Simple office microscopic skills are needed for the diagnosis of vaginitis, cervicitis, and urethritis, and all physicians should be encouraged to develop these skills. Physicians will need to keep abreast of the rapidly evolving changes in the diagnosis and treatment of STDs.\r"

Current interest in AIDS should not obscure the facts that genital herpes continues to increase in prevalence, and that syphilis no longer is declining.

Twenty-four hours later, rats have retained the response, being immobile for about 70% of a 5-min retest period. We previously reported that in this test adrenalectomized rats are indistinguishable from intact rats over the 15-min test period, but are immobile for only approximately 30% of a 5-min retest period 24 h later. The finding that this behavioral effect of adrenalectomy can be reversed by glucocorticoids or kappa-selective opioids led us to hypothesize that retention of the immobile behavior can be effected by glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex or kappa-selective opioids from the adrenal medulla. To test this hypothesis, we have given intact rats the antiglucocorticoid RU38486 and the anticholinergics atropine and mecamylamine to block adrenal medullary discharge, either alone or simultaneously. Administered alone, neither class of antagonist affected the response; administered together, they profoundly reduced immobility to levels seen in adrenalectomized rats. Additional evidence for medullary kappa-selective opioids mediating the behavioral effect was that the administration to hypophysectomized rats of atropine plus mecamylamine or the kappa-selective antagonist MR2266 reduced immobility to the levels seen in adrenalectomized animals. We conclude that secretion from either the adrenal cortex or medulla is sufficient for the incorporation of this learned response after stress, and that in intact animals input from both zones may contribute to the terms of this behavioral response.\r"

  ".W": "A selective inhibitor of aromatase (estrogen synthetase) would be a useful pharmacological tool with potential therapeutic application. We have found that 6 alpha-bromoandrostenedione (6 alpha-BrA) is a competitive inhibitor of human placental aromatase with respect to androstenedione, with an apparent Ki of 3.4 nM, while 6 beta-BrA is a mechanism-based irreversible inhibitor with an apparent Ki of 0.8 microM and a kinact of 0.025 min-1. Aromatase activity was measured by tritium release into water from the 1 beta position of [1(-3)H,4(-14)C]androstenedione in reaction mixtures containing NADPH and the aromatase. Time-dependent inhibition was assessed by preincubation of inhibitors with either the 900 X g placental pellet or placental microsomes in the presence of NADPH. Aliquots were taken at intervals, diluted, and assayed for aromatase activity with androstenedione and additional NADPH. The time-dependent inhibition by 6 beta-BrA was dependent on the concentration of this compound and the presence of NADPH, while the addition of excess substrate in the preincubation mixture hindered the inactivation. Both epimers were ineffective in inhibiting rabbit liver microsomal drug-metabolizing activities in a competitive or time-dependent manner. This indicates a high selectivity of 6-BrA inhibition among P-450 cytochromes. These and other 6-substituted androgens may be useful probes into the nature of the active site and mechanism of action of aromatase.\r"

  ".W": "The distribution of progesterone receptor (PR) in the chick ovary was studied using light- and electron-microscopic immunocytochemical methods. With the light microscopic technique, PR was observed in the germinal epithelium cells of estrogen-treated and estrogen-untreated immature chicks. With the preembedding immunocytochemical technique, which proved to be more sensitive than immunohistochemistry using paraffin sections, the germinal epithelium and also part of the thecal and stromal cells were stained when immature chicks were not treated with estrogen. After estrogen treatment, the number of PR-positive stromal and thecal cells increased, as did the immunostaining intensity in their nuclei. The granulosa cells were PR-positive only after estrogen treatment. In the ovary of laying hens, the most intense staining for PR was localized in the germinal epithelium. PR was also present in the thecal, stromal, and granulosa cells. At the subcellular level, PR was detected only in the cell nuclei, indicating that ovarian PR is intranuclear independent of the presence of progesterone. In conclusion, immunocytochemical methods proved to be suitable for studying steroid hormone receptors in steroid-producing tissues (e.g. the ovary), because excess endogenous hormones do not affect detection of the receptor with the antibody as they do detection with labeled ligands. Immunocytochemically, the germinal epithelium, stromal, thecal, and granulosa cells of the laying hen ovary were shown to be target cells for progesterone. The inducibility of PR by estrogen in the thecal, stromal, and granulosa cells suggests that these cell types are also sensitive to estrogen.\r"

Cells cultured for 2 days in the presence of 1 microM dexamethasone released more cAMP in response to ACTH1-24 than did untreated cells, both in the absence and presence of 0.5 mM 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine. Such an enhancing effect required greater than or equal to 21 h of treatment and was both concentration-dependent and steroid specific. The ED50 of dexamethasone was about 10 nM, while that of cortisol and corticosterone was about 1 microM; testosterone at concentrations less than or equal to 10(-5) M had no enhancing effect. Glucocorticoids enhanced the cAMP response to ACTH1-24 without altering its ED50. Treatment of cultures with aminoglutethimide or the antiglucocorticoid RU 38486 for 48 h resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in ACTH1-24-induced cAMP output. Moreover, RU 38486 antagonized the enhancing effect of dexamethasone. Glucocorticoids did not increase the cAMP response to forskolin. These results suggest that chronic exposure to glucocorticoids is necessary for the full expression of the cAMP response to ACTH1-24 of adrenocortical cells from adult sheep.\r"

Because of its role as a diabetogenic hormone and its ability to elicit lipolysis, GH was studied in isolated fat cells (IFC) from control and streptozotocin-diabetic (STZ-DM) rats. IFCs from the epididymal fat of 150 to 200-g normal and STZ-DM Holtzman rats were prepared by collagenase digestion. Lipolysis was measured by glycerol release after either incubation or perifusion with the following concentrations: epinephrine (EPI), 0.01-0.1 microM; theophylline, 0.01-1.0 mg/ml; adenosine deaminase (ADA), and bovine GH (bGH), 0.01-1.0 microgram/ml. Rats, rendered diabetic by STZ (65 mg/kg), were used on day 3. In a dose-response study comparing glycerol release from control and STZ-DM IFC, IFC were preincubated with 1.0 microgram/ml bGH and then incubated with varying concentrations of EPI or bGH. In STZ-DM, we noted increased lipolytic sensitivity to low concentrations of EPI or bGH. Furthermore, in perifusion, STZ-DM IFC did not require obligatory preincubation with bGH for optimal glycerol release. The addition of ADA increased glycerol release from incubated IFC (STZ-DM and controls). In both systems an enhanced lipolytic response to theophylline was seen in the presence of bGH in control and STZ-DM. It was thus concluded that IFC from normal animals do not respond to GH without preincubation. IFC from STZ-DM rats show a lipolytic response to GH without preincubation. Preincubation with GH increases the lipolytic response of IFC from STZ-DM to all lipolytic agents compared to control responses. In addition, ADA greatly enhanced lipolysis in IFC from STZ-DM compared to that in controls. Together these data demonstrate enhanced sensitivity to both lipolytic stimuli and adenosine suppression of lipolysis in IFC from STZ-DM.\r"

Chondrocytes from epiphyseal growth plates of the proximal tibia of 7-, 20-, and 28-day-old normal male rats were enzymatically isolated and cultured in the presence of 10% newborn calf serum in suspension stabilized with 0.5% agarose. The cloning efficiency (number of formed colonies per 1000 seeded cells) was 13.7 +/- 1.9, 3.2 +/- 0.6, and 3.5 +/- 0.4 for chondrocytes isolated from 7-, 20- and 28-day-old rats and cultured for 14 days, respectively. The colonies were classified according to size (colony diameter), and the number of colonies was estimated as a function of colony size (distribution of cloning efficiency). IGF-I (25-200 ng/ml) increased the total colony number among chondrocytes isolated from the three different age groups and particularly increased the number of small colonies. However, IGF-I did not significantly change the distribution of cloning efficiency as compared to the control group. hGH potentiated colony formation at concentrations of 10-80 ng/ml, but no stimulatory effect of hGH was apparent at a concentration of 160 ng/ml. GH caused an assymetric distribution of cloning efficiency that was significantly different from the control group due to an increased number of large colonies (diameter exceeding 80 microns). The differential effects of GH and IGF-I were apparent after an extended period of culture (28 days) at various concentrations of the peptides. These results show that GH as well as IGF-I induced colony formation among epiphyseal chondrocytes in suspension culture, although the effects of GH and IGF-I are different in terms of distribution of cloning efficiency. The observation that GH particularly potentiated the formation of large size colonies suggests that GH promotes the differentiation of prechondrocytes, or young chondrocytes as suggested earlier. The finding that IGF-I stimulation resulted in a higher proportion of small size chondrocyte colonies, compared to the control group, suggests that IGF-I stimulates epiphyseal chondrocytes at a later stage of differentiation.\r"

Addition of IGF-I to the chondrocyte cultures from control rats caused a slight increase in cloning efficiency (control, 1.5 +/- 0.1; IGF-I, 2.2 +/- 0.3) but caused a marked increase in chondrocyte cultures from GH-pretreated rats (control, 4.4 +/- 0.4; IGF-I, 8.2 +/- 0.9). The cloning efficiency was increased 12 and 24 h, but not 4 h, after start of GH-treatment in vivo. The increased responsiveness to IGF-I in vivo showed a similar time course after GH pretreatment. The distribution of cloning efficiency was altered in cultures of chondrocytes isolated from the GH-pretreated rats; large colonies were overrepresented in the GH-treated group. Colonies with a diameter exceeding 180 microns were only seen in cultures of chondrocytes isolated from the GH-pretreated animals. Addition of IGF-I in vitro did not alter the distribution of cloning efficiency, but increased the mean colony size of all colonies. Pretreatment of the rats with two different doses of IGF-I in vivo for 24 h (5 micrograms X 3 or 50 micrograms X 3) had a slight stimulatory effect on subsequent colony formation, but no potentiation of IGF-I in vitro was demonstrated. The results of the present study show that pretreatment of hypophysectomized rats with GH, but not with IGF-I, promotes the formation of chondrocyte colonies and make the chondrocytes susceptible to IGF-I in vitro. The results suggest that GH induces colony formation by IGF-I-independent mechanisms and that IGF-I is a second effector in GH action as previously shown for cultured 3T3-preadipose cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The concentration of GLP-1 immunoreactivity (GLP-1-IR), measured by a specific and sensitive RIA established in this study with anti GLP-1 serum (LMT-01), was found to be highest in the thalamus-hypothalamus, followed by the medulla oblongata. The distribution of glucagon-like immunoreactivity was similar to that of GLP-1-IR. However, appreciable glucagon immunoreactivity was detected only in the thalamus-hypothalamus. Gel filtration analysis showed the presence of GLP-1-IR of various molecular weights in the extract of thalamus-hypothalamus including that eluted at the same position as synthetic GLP-1 (1-37); moreover, HPLC analysis also confirmed the presence of GLP-1-IR, eluted at the exact position as synthetic GLP-1 (1-37). The distribution of receptors for GLP-1 corresponded with that of GLP-1-IR in the rat brain, except in the pituitary gland. The distribution of these receptors was also similar to that of glucagon receptors. The thalamus-hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and medulla oblongata were rich in GLP-1 and glucagon-binding sites. The binding affinities of GLP-1 and glucagon were in the nanomolar range [disocciation constant Kd approximately equal to 4 nM]. The presence of specific, high affinity receptors for GLP-1 was confirmed by demonstrating that GLP-1 stimulated cAMP formation in the thalamus-hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. The concentration of GLP-1 required for half-maximal stimulation of cAMP formation in these regions was about 1 nM. These results suggest that GLP-1 may be synthesized in certain parts of the brain and play a role as a neurosignal transmitter.\r"

The results indicate that diethylstilbestrol (DES) a potent mitogen, stimulated incorporation of myo-[3H]inositol into uterine PI in 1-3 h, with maximal incorporation occurring at 6 h. This activity followed a dose-dependent increase, with a maximal effect at 5 micrograms/kg. Incorporation of radiolabeled phosphorous into the polyphosphoinositides was also increased in estrogen-stimulated uterine tissue. Studies using a weak uterotropic DES derivative, Z,Z-dienestrol, produced an early stimulation of the PI response comparable to DES. This activity was increased by Z,Z-dienestrol, with minimal estrogen receptor occupancy, and did not result in stimulation of DNA synthesis. These findings would suggest that uterine PI stimulation may not occur via an estrogen receptor-mediated mechanism related to tissue proliferation induced by estrogens.\r"

  ".W": "After adrenalectomy, ACTH, corticosterone-binding globulin (CBG), and thymus wet weight increase in rats as a consequence of the removal of corticosterone (B) and decrease again in response to replacement with glucocorticoids. We have studied the effect of replacing adrenalectomized male rats with a variety of different concentrations of B. Plasma concentrations of ACTH and CBG and thymus wet weights were related to the measured concentration of free ultrafilterable B in plasma. In other experiments, the clearance of [125I]CBG was determined in adrenalectomized rats with and without B replacement, and the time required for the changes in plasma CBG concentrations after removal and/or replacement of B in adrenalectomized rats was determined. Five to 7 days after adrenalectomy and institution of a relatively constant B replacement signal, plasma CBG concentrations were highly correlated with circulating B concentrations (r2 = 0.745; P less than 0.001). The effect of B was on the CBG production rate, since clearance did not change. Because CBG concentrations decrease as total B concentrations increase, there is an amplification of free B concentrations with increasing total B. The relationships of plasma ACTH and CBG and thymus wet weight to circulating free B levels showed that 50% inhibition of ACTH was achieved at a free B concentration of 0.8 +/- 0.05 nM, whereas 50% inhibition of CBG and thymus wet weight were achieved at free B concentrations of 4.6 +/- 0.9 and 4.4 +/- 0.6 nM, respectively. These inhibition values correlate well with the known Kd values for the high affinity type I B receptor (0.5 nM) and for the lower affinity type II glucocorticoid receptor (2.5-5 nM), respectively, suggesting that ACTH secretion, CBG production, and thymus wet weight are regulated by the association of B with these receptor types.\r"

Pseudopregnancy was induced in 7 gilts by daily injection of estradiol valerate (5 mg/day) between days 11 and 15 of the estrous cycle. Between days 60 and 90 of pseudopregnancy, uterine secretions were collected by flushing the uterus with 0.9% saline. Uterine flushings were extracted with a Sep-Pak C-18 column and assayed for beta END-LI by a specific RIA. The RIA cross-reacted only with beta-lipotropin (15%). Significant amounts of total immunoreactive beta END-LI were detected in the uterine flushings. The inhibition curve for extracts was parallel to the standard END inhibition curve. Extracted uterine flushings were applied to a Sephadex G-50 column. Three peaks of immunoreactive beta END-LI were detected. One peak eluted at the void volume. The second peak eluted at a Kav of 0.21, which was near the Kav of a lipotropin standard (0.23). The highest peak (Kav = 0.53) eluted similar to standard END (Kav = 0.51). In the second experiment, 12 gilts were ovariectomized on day 4 of the estrous cycle and randomly assigned to 4 groups of 3 gilts each. Each group received 1 of the following daily injections: vehicle (corn oil), 0.1 mg 17 beta-estradiol (E2), 200 mg progesterone (Prog), or a combination of E2 and Prog (E2 + Prog). After treatment for 30 days, beginning on the day of ovariectomy, the uterine flushings were assayed for beta END-LI and total protein. Treatment with Prog increased (P less than 0.05) total beta END-LI 532% (12.4 ng) compared to corn oil treatment (2.3 ng), and levels were significantly higher than with E2 (2.9 ng) or E2 + Prog treatment (5.1 ng). Opiate receptor assay showed that extracts of uterine flushing had a displacement curve parallel to that of standard porcine beta END. Results suggest that significant amounts of immunoreactive beta END-LI are present in uterine secretions of gilts and that the accumulation of beta END-LI is influenced by ovarian steroids.\r"

  ".W": "The use of beta-adrenergic agonists in the treatment of preterm labor has been found to be associated with a decreased incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in premature newborns. beta-Sympathomimetic agents, which activate adenylate cyclase and increase tissue cAMP levels, as well as cAMP analogs stimulate surfactant glycerophospholipid synthesis and secretion by fetal lung tissue. In the present study, we used antibodies directed against the major human pulmonary surfactant apoprotein, a 35,000-dalton glycoprotein, to evaluate the effects of the cAMP analog dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP) and the beta-adrenergic agonist terbutaline on surfactant apoprotein synthesis in human fetal lung explants in organ culture. By use of immunoblot analysis, we found that Bt2cAMP (1 mM) markedly stimulated accumulation of the major surfactant apoprotein in human fetal lung explants, as did terbutaline. Bt2cAMP treatment also increased the relative rate of incorporation of [35S]methionine into the major surfactant apoprotein. The Bt2cAMP-induced increase in surfactant apoprotein synthesis and accumulation was associated with an increase in the levels of translatable surfactant apoprotein mRNA. Morphometric analysis at both the light and electron microscopic levels was used to evaluate the effects of Bt2cAMP on the morphology of the human fetal lung in vitro. After 48-h incubation with Bt2cAMP, the prealveolar ducts of the fetal lung explants were enlarged greatly, and the relative amount of interalveolar connective tissue was reduced compared to those in control tissues. The volume density of type II cells in the Bt2cAMP-treated explants was significantly greater than that in control explants at this time point; however, after 4 and 6 days of incubation, the volume density of type II cells in control and Bt2cAMP-treated tissues was similar, and the lumina of the prealveolar ducts of control tissues had a volume density similar to that of Bt2cAMP-treated explants. Bt2cAMP also had pronounced effects on the ultrastructural morphology of the human fetal lung explants. Large quantities of secreted lamellar bodies and tubular myelin were observed in the lumina of the prealveolar ducts of the Bt2cAMP-treated tissue. Few lamellar bodies and no tubular myelin were observed in the lumina of the prealveolar ducts of control tissues. These findings suggest that cAMP may serve an important regulatory role in the synthesis and secretion of the major surfactant apoprotein by human fetal lung.\r"

  ".W": "The stereospecificity of T3 transport through the walls of the brain capillary, i.e. the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and the salivary gland capillary and through the hepatocyte plasma membrane was studied with a tissue-sampling single injection technique in rats. In the absence of plasma proteins, the ED50 of inhibition of the saturable transport of [125I]L-T3 through the BBB was 1 microM for unlabeled L-T3 and 9 microM for unlabeled D-T3. The brain extraction of [125I]D-T3, 5.9 +/- 0.1% (+/- SE), was about one third that of [125I]L-T3. Conversely, no saturable and no stereospecific T3 transport was observed for the salivary gland capillary, which, unlike the brain capillary, is porous. The hepatic extraction of T3 was minimally stereospecific in the absence of plasma proteins. In the presence of 5 g/dl bovine albumin, the fraction of circulating D- or L-T3 that was available for transport into liver (50-100%) was many-fold greater than the fraction that was free in vitro (approximately 2%); therefore, both D-T3 and L-T3 were available for uptake by liver from the circulating albumin-bound pool. This plasma protein-mediated transport of T3 is believed to represent a process of enhanced dissociation of T3 from the albumin-binding site, since the plasma protein per se is not significantly taken up by liver on a single pass. However, in the presence of 5 g/dl bovine albumin, the extravascular hepatic extraction of [125I]D-T3 (50 +/- 2%) was nearly half that for [125I]T3 (93 +/- 12%), although no significant difference in the in vitro binding of [125I]D-T3 and [125I]L-T3 to 5 g/dl bovine albumin was found with equilibrium dialysis. In addition, the isoelectric point of bovine albumin bound to [125I] L-T3 (5.1) was higher than that of bovine albumin bound to [125I] D-T3 (5.0), as determined by isoelectric focusing, which indicates that the surface of the bovine albumin molecule is slightly more positive when the protein binds L-T3 as opposed to D-T3. The isoelectric focusing and in vivo transport data together suggest that the interaction between the surfaces of the plasma protein and the hepatic microcirculation that is presumed to cause enhanced hormone dissociation from the protein-binding site is electrostatic in nature. These studies (1) show that the BBB thyroid hormone transport system is sharply stereospecific, and this property is probably a major factor underlying the low biological potency of D-T3 in brain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

E had no direct effect on the proliferation, surface adherence, or luminol-enhanced luminescence (LEL) of the U937 cells. Exposure of U937 cells to lymphocyte-conditioned medium (LCM) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 allowed a maximal LEL response by cells stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate. In contrast, LCM from lymphocytes exposed to E (LCM-E) did not stimulate LEL to the same extent as did an equal volume of LCM. Increasing the E concentration in the lymphocyte medium was associated with a dose-dependent reduction in the LEL response of the U937 cells. Mixing equal quantities of LCM and LCM-E significantly decreased LEL levels. LEL stimulated by LCM, gamma-interferon, or differentiation-inducing factor was reduced by the presence of LCM-E. The inhibitory action of LCM-E was reversible and metabolite specific. 17 alpha-E produced an effect that was only one tenth the magnitude of the E effect. These findings indicate that E can modulate the differentiation of phagocytes indirectly by altering the synthesis and/or secretion of lymphokines.\r"

The glands from the rachitic animals were morphologically indistinguishable from those of age-matched controls. When placed in explant culture, glands from vitamin D-deficient mice and rats underwent DNA synthesis at a rate comparable to that of glands from the vitamin D-replete controls. However, the hormonally induced synthesis of casein and alpha-lactalbumin was significantly reduced in explants of glands from rachitic vs. control animals. The reduction in casein-synthesizing ability by mouse mammary gland explants was not reversed by the addition of 10(-8) or 10(-6) M 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol to the culture medium, but could be reversed by pretreating the vitamin D-deficient mice with the D metabolite in vivo for 10 days before the onset of culture. The decrease in milk protein synthesis in culture is paralleled in vivo by a decrease in milk protein content in the milk and lactating mammary glands of vitamin D-deficient mice and rats. Both in vivo and in vitro, it is the two highest mol wt caseins that are most affected by the lack of vitamin D in the diet. These data suggest that vitamin D does not play a fundamental role in growth and morphological development of the normal mammary gland, but, rather, it is important in maintenance of full hormonally induced functional differentiation of the mature gland.\r"

The transient outward current activated rapidly and then inactivated slowly on maintained depolarization. Activation was initiated at -30 mV, and zero current was seen at -60 to -50 mV. The slow outward current did not inactivate with time and was initiated around 0 mV; its zero current voltage was difficult to evaluate. The two outward currents were present in different proportions, which explains the different time course of the total outward current from one cell to another. A slow inward current was also found which activated near -30 mV and reached its reversal potential between 80 and 100 mV. This current was blocked by Co2+, increased with [Ca2+]o, and was insensitive to Na+-free external medium. ACTH, a potent stimulant of steroid output, was found to block the transient outward current, but was ineffective on the slow outward current and the slow inward current. Tetraethylammonium and 4-aminopyridine, K+ channel inhibitors, also blocked the transient outward current.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of histones on receptor-DNA interaction were examined using an in vitro DNA-cellulose-binding assay of [125I]T3 receptor. H1 histones bound to DNA-cellulose strongly inhibited binding of receptor to DNA-cellulose. DNA-cellulose column chromatography showed that 80% of T3-binding activity attached to DNA-cellulose could be eluted using 1 mg H1 histone/ml at low ionic strength. The potent inhibitory activity of H1 histones on receptor-DNA binding was reversed by removal of H1 histones from DNA-cellulose or by removal of H1 histones from receptor. The interaction was specific for the DNA-binding activity of receptor, since H1 histones inhibit neither T3-binding activity nor core histone-binding activity of receptor. In contrast, low concentrations of core histones enhanced binding of T3 receptor to DNA-cellulose. This effect was also seen when DNA-cellulose was treated with core histones and then deprived of free core histones. The enhancement was reversed by removal of core histones bound to DNA-cellulose. A tryptic fragment of the receptor, which lost DNA-binding activity but retained hormone and core histone-binding activities, was capable of binding to DNA-cellulose in the presence of core histones. These data suggest that enhanced binding of receptor to DNA-cellulose by core histones is mediated through the core histone-binding activity of receptor. A heat-labile protein factor in nuclear extracts (possibly receptor itself) also enhanced receptor binding to DNA-cellulose. Our data suggest important roles of histones in the organization of nuclear thyroid hormone receptors in chromatin. Since H1 histone participates in condensation of chromatin and is enriched in transcriptionally inactive chromatin, inhibition of DNA-binding activity of receptor by H1 histone bound to DNA could explain the preferential binding of nuclear thyroid hormone receptor to transcriptionally active chromatin.\r"

In this study the lactogenic factors in maternal serum during the second half of pregnancy were measured using RIAs for haPL-II and haPRL and a RRA for total lactogenic activity. haPL-II was first detectable on day 10 of pregnancy and reached a maximal concentration [12.3 +/- 0.8 microgram/ml (mean +/- SEM); n = 6] on day 16 (term). PRL concentrations were relatively low during the second half of gestation. Significant amounts of lactogenic activity that could not be ascribed to haPL-II or haPRL were detected throughout this period, with maximal concentrations on days 10-12. Gel filtration chromatography of day 10 serum gave an apparent mol wt of 35,000 for this lactogenic factor. A lactogenic factor with a similar mol wt (37,000) was detected in an extract of day 10 placenta. This lactogenic factor was designated haPL-I. The most prominent forms of haPL-II in day 16 serum were several disulfide-bonded forms with mol wt greater than 200,000. Smaller quantities of lower mol wt forms, including monomeric haPL-II, were present, but circulated as noncovalently bound complexes with mol wt greater than 100,000. Complete conversion to monomeric haPL-II was found only after treatment with both sodium dodecyl sulfate and 2-mercaptoethanol. The high mol wt forms of haPL-II in maternal serum were composed of two different monomeric species of haPL-II.\r"

  ".W": "Highly purified plasma membranes from Y-1 mouse adrenal tumor cells and those from bovine fasciculata cells were shown by [125I]iodocalmodulin overlay to contain five calmodulin-binding proteins of 240,000, 150,000, 66,000, 60,000, and 51,000 mol wt (Mr). Three of these proteins were also detected by affinity chromatography on calmodulin-Sepharose. Calmodulin binding was inhibited by competition with unlabeled calmodulin and by an inhibitor of calmodulin (trifluoperazine). Binding to each of the proteins was Ca2+ dependent. The relative proportion of binding to each of the five proteins was very different for Y-1 and bovine membranes. In Y-1 membranes as much as 50% of total binding was to the 51,000 Mr protein, whereas in bovine membranes more than 50% of binding occurred with the 150,000 Mr protein. Three of the five proteins were tentatively identified as follows: the 240,000 Mr protein is alpha-spectrin, the 60,000 Mr protein is the A subunit of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase called calcineurin and the 51,000 Mr protein is the major subunit of a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. The kinase was shown to act on specific substrates. It is concluded that calmodulin, by binding to the kinase and phosphatase, is capable of influencing the degree of phosphorylation of specific substrates in the plasma membranes of adrenal cells, and by binding to alpha-spectrin it may influence the cytoskeletons of these cells. These effects of calmodulin are likely to be important in the regulation of steroid synthesis in the adrenal cortex.\r"

After cell incubations with [3H] dihydrotestosterone at 0 or 23 C, receptor was recovered predominantly in cytosol as 406,000 mol wt (10.1 +/- 0.4S; 89 +/- 1 A) and 237,000 mol wt (7.1 +/- 0.4S; 74 +/- 1 A). At 37 C, increasing amounts of receptor were retained with time by nuclei as receptor size decreased to 127,000 mol wt (5.5 +/- 0.3S; 51 +/- 2 A). The half-time of nuclear association was approximately 3 min at 37 C. DNA-binding activity was acquired upon conversion of the 10S receptor to 7S and 5.5S forms. The use of serum-free culture conditions ruled out the possible involvement of serum proteins in the formation of multiple receptor forms. In cell-free preparations, dihydrotestosterone binding was required for receptor dissociation from 10S to 7S, which at short time intervals was enhanced by mercaptoethanol. It is concluded that the 7S receptor is a transformation intermediate that displays DNA-binding activity but is not well retained in nuclei. Complete androgen receptor transformation is a steroid- and temperature-dependent reaction involving a decrease in receptor size from 10S to 5.5S.\r"

  ".U": "87304000\r", 
  ".W": "We have examined possible mechanisms by which osmolality might modulate PTH secretion in dispersed bovine parathyroid cells. Increasing medium osmolality by adding sodium chloride causes a marked, dose-dependent increase in PTH release. The maximum effect (4-fold increase) is observed when osmolality is around 650 mosM, with half-maximal stimulation at about 400 mosM. When osmolality is increased to a similar extent with either sucrose or sodium chloride, PTH secretion is enhanced to a comparable degree, suggesting that osmolality itself, rather than ionic strength, is responsible for the increase in PTH secretion. Time course experiments show that the increased secretion of PTH with high osmolality occurs very rapidly (in less than 5 min). In contrast to the suppressive effects of high Ca2+ on PTH release, increasing calcium concentration in the incubation media does not inhibit the stimulation of PTH secretion by high osmolality. Moreover, the effects of dopamine (10(-5) M) and high osmolality on PTH release are additive, further suggesting that high osmolality and cAMP modulate PTH release by different mechanisms. In fact, direct measurement of cellular cAMP in cells exposed to high osmolality shows no change relative to control cells incubated with normal osmolality, 127 +/- 20 vs. 146 +/- 21 fmol/10(5) cells, respectively. Cytosolic Ca2+ increases from 257 +/- 29 nM to 703 +/- 50 nM after 200 mM NaCl is added to the incubation medium at low Ca2+ (0.5mM). Prior removal of extracellular calcium abolished this effect. Increasing the osmolality to a similar level by adding sucrose to the medium does not demonstrate any increase in cytosolic calcium. We conclude that high osmolality is a potent secretogogue in dispersed bovine parathyroid cells. Unlike dopamine and isoproterenol, high osmolality does not act through changes in intracellular cAMP. It also prevents the normal inhibitory effect of high Ca2+ on PTH release. Change of cytosolic Ca2+ is variable and suggests that the effect of high osmolality on PTH release cannot be explained by cytosolic Ca2+ alone. Further understanding of the mechanisms by which osmolality affects PTH release, therefore, may provide clues to the unusual inverse relationship between extracellular and cytosolic calcium and PTH release.\r"

Rat and human GH (hGH) showed the highest activity while ovine GH was inactive. PRL (0.6 IU/h X kg) administered together with hGH (0.02 IU/h X kg) did not antagonize the feminizing action of GH. Infusion of hGH into male rats decreased the affinity of estradiol 2-hydroxylase for its steroid substrate and altered the linear Lineweaver-Burk plot towards a nonlinear hyperbolic plot characteristic of the female. The apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) for the reaction was 1.69 microM for males and 2.75 microM for testosterone-treated ovariectomized females. An equal mixture of liver microsomes from male and female rats gave kinetic values similar to those observed with males alone. Neonatal imprinting with androgen did not alter the magnitude of the response of female rats to treatment with testosterone and/or GH at maturity and the androgen effect could only be shown in ovariectomized animals. The results with rats of different endocrine status were corroborated by the kinetic data and by the pattern of metabolites obtained with [4-14C]E2 when examined by TLC and autoradiography. The hormonal control of estradiol 2-hydroxylase, the key enzyme in catechol estrogen formation, and the contribution of sex-specific multiple forms of the enzyme to this reaction are discussed.\r"

Twelve years later, a follow-up study was carried out. Eleven of the 194 children had died, 8 of whom had had signs of neurodeficit, i.e., abnormal neurology and/or mental retardation. A long-standing remission of seizures occurred in 124 of the 194 children. Signs of neurodeficit, frequent seizures, and many types of seizures were negative prognostic factors. The presence of all these factors carried a bad prognosis, seizures persisting during 12 years in greater than 80%. For those who were mentally and neurologically normal and had low seizure frequency, prognosis was excellent, only 11% still having active epilepsy after 12 years. A study of the annual remission rate showed that each year approximately 13% of the children without neurodeficit had remission from epilepsy the next year. This rate appeared to be stable over the 12 years studied. Among those children with neurodeficit, the annual remission rate was high only during the first years after onset, later falling to 3% a year.\r"

To determine the probability of finding IIEA with serial EEGs (the operational curve), we reviewed data from 1,201 EEGs on 429 adult patients, most with definite epilepsy presenting in adulthood. The diagnosis was made either clinically or with the support of the EEG. In 50% of our patients with IIEA, the abnormality is present on the first record, in 84% by the third EEG, and in 92% by the fourth. There is relatively little yield to serial EEGs beyond this point.\r"

We show that the anticonvulsant drug carbamazepine (CBZ) and several of its structural analogs behave in a manner identical to that of a series of adenosine antagonists; i.e., they are more potent inhibitors of [3H]cyclohexyladenosine (CHA) binding at 8 degrees C as compared to 37 degrees C and are equipotent as inhibitors of [3H]diethylphenylxanthine (DPX) binding at 0 and 30 degrees. We also show that the potency of CBZ and derivatives as inhibitors of [3H]CHA binding is markedly increased in the presence of 10 microM GppNHp, whereas their potency as inhibitors of [3H]DPX binding is unaffected by this guanine nucleotide. These data in conjunction with past studies support the hypothesis that CBZ and its derivatives act as adenosine antagonists at the level of binding interactions at the adenosine receptor.\r"

There was no other morphological anomaly except for slightly enlarged lateral ventricles. No behavioral or physical peculiarities were noted. The unusual profile of kindling in this animal was characterized by (a) very rapid kindling at the primary site, (b) the lateralized nature of the kindled primary site convulsion preceded by repetitive and violent contralateral axial rotation, and (c) the complete absence of positive transfer effect expected at the contralateral homotopic secondary site. These features are strikingly reminiscent of the pattern of amygdaloid kindling in forebrain-bisected cats. These observations add strength to our hypothesis that the CC (and possibly the hippocampal commissure) is the major anatomic substratum for convulsive generalization and the transhemispheric positive transfer effect in feline limbic kindling.\r"

Twenty rabbits were randomly assigned into 10 controls and 10 treated with nimodipine 5 mg/kg/day orally for 5 days. All animals received increasing doses of the convulsant PTZ intravenously (i.v). The epileptogenecity of this agent was assessed in all animals (mg/kg) by four electrocorticographic criteria: first seizure greater than 5 s, two seizures within 5 min, epileptiform activity for 1 h, and status epilepticus. In all four categories, nimodipine increased the seizure threshold by 50-60%. The dose of PTZ required to produce the first seizure was 27.0 +/- 5.4 mg/kg in controls and 49.6 +/- 9.9 mg/kg in treated animals (p less than 0.001). Similar values were obtained for the other three electrocorticographic categories. There were no observable adverse side effects.

Continuous EEG records were obtained from implanted hippocampal electrodes for periods of 4-7 weeks in 14 rats. In a pilot study of two of these rats, three more recording electrodes were placed in other brain areas. Six of the rats (including the latter two) were simultaneously filmed using time-lapse videorecording, and the relationships between EEG events and overt motor fits were assessed using a split-screen video monitoring system. Characteristic peaks and troughs in the numbers of overt fits occurring each day were noted in all the rats that were filmed, and less marked peaks occurred in the numbers of hippocampal seizure discharges. At the start of the syndrome, seizure discharges occurred without accompanying fits; then overt fits occurred with some of the discharges; later the animals stopped having fits but seizure discharges continued to occur alone for several weeks. Fits only occurred with longer seizure discharges (more than approximately 30 s), but not all longer seizures were associated with fits. Whether or not a hippocampal seizure discharge leads to a motor fit appears to depend not on the nature of the electrical activity in the hippocampus but probably on the properties of areas, such as the cingulate gyrus, to which the seizure activity may spread. Large epileptiform spikes occurred throughout the syndrome, and their frequency was often increased for some minutes after a seizure discharge. While there was an overall correlation between the number of fits and the number of seizure discharges occurring during the entire syndrome, within relatively brief periods this relation was not consistent. The occurrence of motor fits was often associated with a decrease in seizure discharge frequency. In the four rats with bilateral electrodes, some independent EEG activity was observed in the uninjected hippocampus.\r"

The effects of medication may also be of greater importance during childhood. In making decisions about whether or not to treat a child who has had only one or a few seizures, the physician must consider the chance of further seizures and the possible consequences of further seizures. Since the major consequence of seizure recurrence is psychosocial, and since the psychosocial consequences of infrequent seizure recurrence vary with age during childhood and differ from those in adults, decisions about therapy should take these differences into account. The potential effects of anticonvulsants on learning and behavior should also be considered. Seizures should not be treated just \"because they are there,\" but rather only when the risks and consequences outweight the benefits of being free of medication and its effects.\r"

We depend especially, but not exclusively, on the recently completed analyses from the Collaborative Perinatal Project of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke, the NCPP. About 4% of children in the NCPP who had at least one nonfebrile nonsymptomatic seizure by the age of 7 years had a previous seizure during acute neurologic illness, such as meningitis or during the acute illness after trauma. Many such seizures should potentially be preventable. Of children with seizures, 10% had had a neonatal seizure and 13% had had a febrile seizure. Among the hundreds of prenatal and perinatal factors explored as predictors of childhood seizure disorders, the principal predictors identified were congenital malformations of the fetus, cerebral and noncerebral; family history of certain neurologic disorders; and neonatal seizures. In agreement with the British National Child Development Study, labor and delivery factors in the NCPP appeared to contribute very little to childhood seizure disorders. Maldevelopment, rather than damage at birth to an initially intact nervous system, appeared to be the more common mechanism. Most seizure disorders of early childhood remained unexplained by the large set of prenatal and perinatal characteristics examined.\r"

The diagnosis also was based on no gross evidence of trophoblastic tissue on sharp curettage and alteration in uterotubal anatomy at laparoscopy. In these 13 patients, titers continued to drop and were below assay detectability (1.5 miu/ml) by 1 to 5 weeks. Only one patient required a laparotomy. Hysterosalpingograms in ten of the patients showed normal, patent tubes in seven. One patient had cornual occlusion and two showed a hydrosalpinx with spillage. A second laparoscopy in seven patients demonstrated normal tubes in all but one. At present, three patients have delivered term infants and two have had first trimester spontaneous abortions. These observations suggest that expectant management of tubal pregnancies is appropriate under rigidly controlled conditions.\r"

The endometrial dating reached its highest significance from days LH -3/-2 to days LH +7/+8, when the changes occurred with a high degree of regularity regardless of the length of the preovulatory and postovulatory phases. It is proposed therefore that the dating of the endometrium should be related to the LH surge rather than to the \"ideal\" 28-day cycle. The results also seem to suggest the existence of a regulatory mechanism for the synchronization of follicular maturation and midcycle endometrial development. Further study of the factors involved in this mechanism may result in a better understanding of certain forms of unexplained infertility.\r"

Comparable immunosuppressive effects were achieved in these assay systems with dexamethasone at a concentration of 10(-8) M, and with cortisol and progesterone at a concentration of 10(-6) M. Physiologic concentrations of estradiol and testosterone did not significantly affect these immunologic test systems. These studies provide evidence that danazol is immunosuppressive. It is possible that immunosuppressive effects contribute to the efficacy of this drug in the treatment of endometriosis and autoimmune disorders.\r"

The relative contributions of androstenedione (delta 4A) and testosterone (T) to DHT production in skin have not been compared. To clarify this, the authors studied the in vitro conversion of delta 4A to DHT, delta 4A to T, and T to DHT in genital and/or pubic skin minces from 20 normal women, 4 hirsute women, and 3 normal men. In normal women, the mean conversion ratios (CRs) of delta 4A to DHT in genital skin (7.06% +/- 1.72%, standard error of the mean) and in pubic skin (2.30% +/- 0.26%) were both significantly higher (P less than 0.05) than the respective mean CRs for T to DHT in genital and pubic skin (3.53% +/- 0.68% and 0.74% +/- 0.14%). In hirsute patients, the data suggested a higher CR of delta 4A to DHT (10.6% +/- 4.59%) compared with T to DHT (4.17 +/- 1.07). Conversely, the CR of delta 4A to DHT (12.8% +/- 9.8%) was significantly lower than the CR of T to DHT (59.7% +/- 12.0%) in male genital skin (P less than 0.01). Since daily blood production rates and serum concentrations of delta 4A are higher than T in women, it is concluded that delta 4A may be a more important precursor for DHT in female skin.\r"

Resected tubal segments were studied histologically, and in 11 of the 18 cases no tubal occlusion could be demonstrated. A variety of histologic abnormalities were noted, however, including six cases in which the tubal lumen contained an amorphous material of unknown etiology, often appearing to form a cast of the tube. Such \"plugs,\" which the authors believe to be previously unreported, have no clearly established clinical significance at present. However, if they cause tubal occlusion, this would explain several previously published findings, and would also have implications for therapy.\r"

All ovaries were accessible for oocyte retrieval, even in those patients in whom laparoscopic retrieval had failed previously or was deemed impossible. No major complications due to TUDOR occurred and the incidence of all complications was 1.5%. The clinical pregnancy rate was 19.0% per embryo transfer, but increased throughout the 2 years to 30.0% per embryo transfer.

Hospital based direct patient care under the supervision of a non-family practice specialist was the most frequent type of educational experience in each of the three years. In contrast, family practice faculty influence throughout each of the three years is minimal. Learning in the outpatient setting with another specialist matched, or in some cases, exceeded that with a family physician. This study raises several important issues regarding the type and appropriate nature of educational influences on family practice physicians. Of greatest concern is the adequacy of role modeling and direct teaching by family practice specialists of family practice residents.\r"

Eighty percent felt the initial year of residency was a time of \"high stress.\" Menstrual dysfunction and other gynecologic problems were not a cause of absenteeism, but during menses, 30% of the respondents felt \"less compassionate,\" 42% \"less efficient,\" and 16% \"less accurate.\" Family medicine educators must understand women residents and their unique problems, stresses, and needs.\r"

The intent of the survey was to measure the degree to which residency programs include education on school health issues in their curriculum. The items on this survey measured four general areas: identification of family practice residency programs with school health components, curricular development, resident and faculty involvement, and the rationale for the lack of involvement of residency programs. The results of the survey indicate that approximately one-third of the residency programs presently have a school health component in their curriculum. Preschool physicals and sports medicine are the most popular activities within family practice residency programs. It was further determined that there is little question of the perceived importance of school health, but the question still remains as to what is the most efficient and effective manner of teaching residents these valuable skills.\r"

However, the decreasing price of microcomputers and available software has provided teaching programs with inexpensive and effective tools to perform this task. The Department of Family Medicine at the Medical College of Georgia recently developed and implemented a microcomputer based information management system for use in assessing program and student clinical experiences in a required family medicine clerkship. This system, which uses logbooks as an information source, is able to monitor and provide information which is used to insure that the student's actual clinical experiences are consistent with the goals and objectives of the clerkship.\r"

Examining room waiting time tended to be markedly underestimated, while physician contact time was markedly overestimated. The overestimation of physician contact time was positively related to the number of interruptions requiring the physician to leave the examining room. Minimal touch in greeting had no effect on estimates of waiting room time but did significantly magnify the underestimation of examining room waiting time. Patients who were touched did, on an average, overestimate physician contact time to a greater extent than those who were not touched; however, this difference did not reach statistical significance.\r"

  ".W": "Of 228 consecutive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive patients who had simultaneous hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) determinations, HBsAg and anti-HBs were found concurrently in 73 (32%). Concurrence was found with greater frequency in patients with chronic active hepatitis than in those with acute hepatitis (36/57 vs 13/38, p less than 0.02). Patients with chronic active hepatitis had concurrent markers more commonly than those with chronic persistent hepatitis or asymptomatic carrier state (36/57 vs. 24/133, p less than 0.001). No major risk factors were identified. Hepatitis B e antigen was detected more frequently in patients with concurrence (68% vs. 42%, p less than 0.01). Subtyping was possible in 30 patients with chronic infection, including 18 with chronic active hepatitis, 7 with chronic persistent hepatitis, and 5 with a carrier state. In 25 patients, HBsAg subtype ad was found with antibody to subdeterminant y and in four instances, HBsAg subtype ay was found with antibody to subdeterminant d. Only 1 patient had homotypic HBsAg and anti-HBs. Of 38 patients who had successive determinations, concurrence was constant in 29. In 9 others, anti-HBs was detected intermittently and the heterotypia of the recurrent antibody remained constant. Antibody to hepatitis delta-virus was not detected. We conclude that concurrent HBsAg and anti-HBs are found frequently in acute and chronic hepatitis B. The markers are commonly heterotypic in chronic disease. The presence of heterotypic markers is not associated with specific risk factors or delta-infection. Concurrence is associated with evidence of viral replication and features of active inflammation.\r"

  ".U": "87305367\r", 
  ".W": "Spironolactone and potassium canrenoate are diuretics that are used widely for management of cirrhotic ascites. The administration of spironolactone frequently leads to feminization, which has been noted less frequently with the use of potassium canrenoate, a salt of the active metabolite of spironolactone. The use of these two drugs has been associated with decreases in serum testosterone levels and spironolactone with a reduction in androgen receptor (AR) activity. This decrease in AR has been cited as the cause of the antiandrogen effect of these drugs. We therefore assessed the effect of both drugs on levels of androgen and estrogen receptors (ER) in the liver, a tissue that is responsive to sex steroids. Three groups of male rats (n = 12 rats each) were studied. Group 1 (control) received vehicle only; group 2 received spironolactone (5 mg/day); group 3 received potassium canrenoate (5 mg/day). After 21 days of treatment, the animals of all groups were killed and liver tissue was assayed for nuclear and cytosolic AR and ER, and for male specific estrogen binder (MEB), an androgen-responsive protein. Both drugs drastically decreased the nuclear AR content, as compared with the control group, but only spironolactone decreased cytosolic AR. When the total hepatic content of AR is considered, a highly significant decrease is observed only in rats treated with spironolactone. This reduction in hepatic AR content suggested loss of androgen responsiveness of liver. We confirmed this by assessing levels of MEB, and found that livers from group 2 animals had no detectable MEB activity, whereas livers from both group 1 and 3 had normal MEB activity. No changes were observed in nuclear ER and cytosolic ER of group 3 as compared with group 1. Nuclear estrogen receptor decreased and cytosolic ER increased in group 2, but with no change in total ER content. These results indicate that (a) only spironolactone appears to act as an antiandrogen in liver, resulting in a decrease in both AR and male specific estrogen binder content, and (b) neither drug results in elevated hepatic ER content, although spironolactone-treated animals show an altered subcellular localization.\r"

  ".U": "87305369\r", 
  ".W": "The metabolism and enterohepatic circulation of deoxycholic acid (DCA), a major secondary bile acid in humans, was simulated using a linear multicompartmental physiologic pharmacokinetic model. The model was similar to that previously reported and used to simulate the metabolism of cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, but differed in two respects: (a) the input of newly formed DCA molecules originated from colonic absorption rather than from de novo hepatic biosynthesis and (b) a new type of transfer coefficient was proposed to describe the movement of DCA molecules from an insoluble, bound compartment to a soluble compartment. Simulations were performed to define the effect of varying fractional colonic absorption (from 0.1 to 0.6) as well as varying fractional formation of DCA from cholic acid (from 0.3 to 1). The simulations indicated that the exchangeable total DCA pool expanded up to 12-fold as fractional colonic absorption was increased from 0.1 to 0.6. The fractional turnover rate of the DCA pool showed a corresponding decrease. Increased conversion of cholic acid to DCA had an effect on DCA pool size that was similar to that resulting from increased colonic fractional absorption. So long as ileal absorption was efficient, the \"soluble\" colonic pool of DCA remained small relative to other organ pools, and the absorption of unconjugated DCA from the colon was less than 10% of the total DCA absorption from the ileum. It is proposed that the relatively large proportion of DCA in the biliary bile acids of white adults in the Western world as compared with that of most other mammals is attributable to (a) a high fractional absorption of DCA because of a diet relatively low in fiber, (b) the absence of hepatic 7-hydroxylation of DCA, and (c) effective competition by DCA conjugates for active transport by the terminal ileum.\r"

  ".W": "The intact cell hypothesis states that a reduced number of intrinsically normal hepatocytes, together with hemodynamic alterations, explains decreased drug metabolism in cirrhosis. We explored this hypothesis by comparing results of the aminopyrine breath test with in vitro measurements of aminopyrine N-demethylation and morphometrically determined liver cell volume in a rat model of cirrhosis. Aminopyrine N-demethylation in vivo (ABT-k) was 0.98 +/- 0.10/h (mean +/- SD) in controls. The cirrhotic rats were separated into those with normal (NCR) and those with abnormal ABT-k (PCR). Microsomal aminopyrine N-demethylase averaged 2.08 +/- 0.77 and 2.09 +/- 0.54 mumol/min in controls and NCRs, respectively; it was reduced to 1.00 +/- 0.81 mumol/min (p less than 0.02) in PCRs. Morphometrically determined hepatocellular volume was 18.8 +/- 2.8, 17.1 +/- 1.9, and 11.6 +/- 6.1 ml in controls, NCRs, and PCRs, respectively, PCRs being lower than controls (p less than 0.01) and NCRs (p less than 0.05). When N-demethylase and cytochrome P450 were related to hepatocellular volume (in milliliters), no significant difference between the three groups was apparent. We conclude that reduced aminopyrine N-demethylation in progressed cirrhosis is mainly due to a loss of liver cell volume. The function per liver cell volume remains constant, however, thus favoring the intact cell hypothesis for the handling of slowly metabolized compounds such as aminopyrine.\r"

This has been based on previous work demonstrating reduced intestinal thresholds for rectal pain induced by balloon distention in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. As the disease may alter the rectal response to distention, inferences regarding pain perception and reporting behavior cannot be drawn from these data. In this study, using electrocutaneous stimulation, we found that patients with irritable bowel syndrome had pain reporting behavior comparable to patients with Crohn's disease. Both patient groups were less likely than normals to report a noxious stimulus as painful. This suggests that pain perception and reporting is attenuated in patients with chronic abdominal pain and, accordingly, a generalized reduction in the threshold for reporting pain is not a factor in the expression of symptoms in the irritable bowel syndrome.\r"

Neither pentagastrin nor cimetidine showed any protective effect against mucosal damage produced by 2 M NaCl. Ninety minutes after mucosal exposure to 2 M NaCl there was an almost complete restitution of the gastric surface epithelium in pentagastrin-stimulated and cimetidine-treated animals, whereas about 15% of the gastric surface still showed damage in animals in which acid secretion was not interfered with. These findings show that restitution of the surface epithelium, in vivo, is a rapid and resistant process even at a very low luminal pH. The secretory state of mucosa may have some influence on this process.\r"

Isolated intestinal segments from uninfected hosts produced propulsive complexes of approximately 30-s duration at 125-s intervals. The maximum intraluminal pressure produced at the oral and aboral ends of the segments was approximately 25 cmH2O and the maximum rate of fluid ejection in both the oral and aboral directions was approximately 0.28 ml/s. Segments removed from guinea pigs 10 and 15 days after being inoculated with infective parasite larvae ejected significantly more fluid in the aboral as compared with the oral direction. The maximum aboral pressure developed 10 days postinoculation was 45.7 cmH2O and the maximum aboral fluid ejection rate was 0.60 ml/s. Analogous oral values were 29.0 cmH2O and 0.40 ml/s. This net aboral propulsion was not observed on days 7, 20, 30, or 60 postinoculation. We conclude that precise and highly predictable alterations in intrinsic propulsive behavior of the small intestine are induced by primary infection. These changes are expressed by day 10 postinoculation and are reversed upon spontaneous termination of the intestinal phase of parasitism.\r"

Proliferation of serum-stimulated cells was inhibited in a concentration-related fashion by continuous exposure to heparin. The inhibition of proliferation was reversible when heparin was removed from the culture medium. Collagen synthesis was inhibited by 24-h exposure to heparin, but only during that phase of culture (8-12 days) when collagen synthesis was maximal. Noncollagen protein synthesis was down-regulated by 24-h exposure to heparin at all phases of culture tested (5-21 days). Heparin also abolished the contraction of collagen lattices populated by human intestinal smooth muscle cells. These studies demonstrate that heparin plays a significant role in the modulation of human intestinal smooth muscle cell behavior in vitro and suggest that a similar role is played by heparinlike components of the extracellular matrix in vivo.\r"

Ten minutes after the topical application of 20 mM aspirin in 50 mM HCl, red blood cell flow ceased and red blood cells were no longer present in the superficial mucosal microvessels in 76.8% +/- 7.7% of the microscopic field. Hydrochloric acid (50 mM) alone caused this effect in only 12.8% +/- 12.8% of the field, whereas 20 mM aspirin alone had no effect. During this microcirculatory change, white thrombi were observed flowing through mucosal microvessels. Later, mucosal hemorrhages developed in areas where flow had ceased. Study of the submucosal microcirculation suggested that high concentrations of HCl are responsible for thrombus formation and low concentrations of HCl for submucosal arteriolar constriction. These results suggest that aspirin-induced acid back-diffusion causes thrombus formation in mucosal microvessels and submucosal arteriolar constriction. These microcirculatory changes might play a causative role in the cessation of mucosal blood flow, mucosal injury, and focal hemorrhage.\r"

  ".W": "We report a 25-yr-old woman who suffered incapacitating chest pain caused by upper esophageal sphincter (UES) dysfunction. She presented with a long history of severe episodic chest pain associated with gurgling noises in her chest and was unable to belch despite feeling a need to do so during pain episodes. Fluoroscopic and manometric studies confirmed that the patient's chest pain and gurgling noise were associated with dysfunction of the belch reflex. Although reflux of gas from the stomach into the esophageal body occurred normally, the extreme esophageal distention resulting from the gas reflux failed to trigger UES relaxation. Consequently, there was no venting of gas across the UES. The gurgling noise was caused by the gastroesophageal reflux of gas and the pain was associated with profound esophageal distention. A manometric study of the UES revealed absent or incomplete UES relaxation in response to abrupt esophageal distention by gastroesophageal gas reflux, so that the nadir of UES pressure always exceeded esophageal body pressure. The distended esophagus was repeatedly cleared by secondary peristalsis. To our knowledge this is the first description of chest pain caused by dysfunction of the belch reflex. We speculate that the mechanism described in this patient may account for a subgroup of patients with \"chest pain of esophageal origin.\"\r"

  ".W": "The effect of neurotensin on smooth muscle contraction was compared in strips from rabbit proximal and distal circular colonic muscle. The effective dose for neurotensin stimulation that caused a 50% response in both tissues was similar (1.3 X 10(-10) M). The maximal isometric stress, however, was greater in the distal colon than in the proximal colon (p less than 0.01). Neurotensin stimulation of both proximal and distal colon was unaffected by tetrodotoxin, phentolamine, propranolol, naloxone, or atropine. Neurotensin-stimulated contraction was inhibited by \"Ca2+-free\" (pCa = 5.1) or La3+ buffer. Verapamil (10(-6) M) or nitroprusside (10(-4) M) decreased neurotensin stimulation of proximal and distal colon by approximately 40% (p less than 0.05). Removal of Ca2+ from the buffer inhibited stimulation of muscle contraction by high extracellular potassium [( K+]o) more than bethanechol stimulation (p less than 0.01). La3+ (1 mM) inhibited the contraction stimulated by bethanechol or increased [K+]o. Although verapamil inhibited contraction by bethanechol and increased [K+]o by approximately 50%, nitroprusside had no effect on the contraction mediated by these stimulants. 8-Bromo-guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) inhibited neurotensin, but not [K+]o or bethanechol-stimulated contraction. These data suggest (a) neurotensin stimulated colonic contractions at a concentration that is potentially physiologic, (b) neurotensin stimulated colonic smooth muscle directly without neural mediation, (c) neurotensin stimulation of colonic muscle is controlled by [Ca2+]o and [cGMP]i.\r"

The results were compared with other parameters of disease activity including Crohn's disease activity index, barium studies, and endoscopy. There was a correlation between early images and Crohn's disease activity index (r = 0.78) and between delayed images and index (r = 0.82). Based upon the corresponding Crohn's disease activity index, the sensitivity of early and delayed imaging was 81.0% and 95.2%, respectively. Specificity of early and delayed imaging was 75.0% and 87.0%, respectively. Presence of activity on the early and delayed imaging agreed with activity on barium studies and colonoscopy in approximately 80% of cases. Correlation of location of disease by leukocyte imaging and x-ray was observed in 58.9% of early scans and 55.0% of delayed scans. Correlation of the location of disease by imaging and endoscopy was observed in 71.4% of early and 75.0% of delayed studies. Because of the possibility of occurrence of false-negative results in early images, delayed imaging should always be included in evaluation of disease activity in patients with Crohn's disease who are suspected of having mild activity. Delayed imaging is not required if the early imaging study clearly shows activity.\r"

Aspirin or SA produced similar extensive gross mucosal hemorrhagic lesions and similar microscopic damage in the presence of luminal acid (luminal pH 1.3 +/- 0.05). Neither ASA nor SA produced gastric mucosal injury with intragastric instillation of saline (luminal pH 3.7 +/- 0.5). Pretreatment for 1 h with luminal or subcutaneous 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 completely prevented the formation of red streaks in ASA-treated rats but not in SA-treated rats, although prostaglandin E2 pretreatment significantly reduced the gross lesion area in SA-treated rats (p less than 0.05). We conclude the following: (a) Intravenous SA is as damaging as intravenous ASA as long as luminal acid is present. (b) 16,16-Dimethyl prostaglandin E2 completely protected the gastric mucosa from injury by intravenous ASA, and to a lesser extent by intravenous SA. (c) In view of the damaging effects of SA on the gastric mucosa and the rapid conversion of ASA to SA, the mechanism of the gastric mucosal injury by intravenous ASA is much more complex than simple inhibition of endogenous prostaglandin synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "A study into the normal anatomy of the venous circulation of the gastroesophageal junction was undertaken using three complementary techniques (radiology, corrosion casting, and morphometry). Four distinct zones of venous drainage were defined as follows: (a) gastric zone, characterized by a longitudinal venous distribution; (b) palisade zone, composed of parallel vessels arranged in groups, lying mainly within the lamina propria; (c) perforating zone, characterized by \"treble clef\" shaped veins, which collect and channel blood into extrinsic veins; and (d) truncal zone, composed of four or five deep lying descending veins. This venous system appeared to be mainly distributed within the esophageal mucosal folds. The anatomic pattern suggests that venous flow is bidirectional at the palisade zone, which acts as a high-resistance watershed region between the portal and azygos systems. In patients with portal hypertension this normal vascular system has to accommodate greatly increased venous flow, and the anatomy as demonstrated here offers insight into variceal development.\r"

Before cyclosporine therapy, serum aminotransferase levels were 20 times normal and immunoglobulin G was 4 g/dl. Within 2 wk of starting cyclosporine therapy, aminotransferase levels decreased; by 2 mo they were almost normal, and at 1 yr into therapy they were normal. A decrease in cyclosporine dosage was associated with an increase in aminotransferase levels, which then again decreased as the dose was increased. Severe growth failure observed during previous corticosteroid therapy reversed during cyclosporine treatment and the patient displayed \"catch-up\" growth. No significant side effects were noted after 1 yr of cyclosporine therapy. Further evaluation of cyclosporine in the treatment of corticosteroid-unresponsive autoimmune chronic active hepatitis appears warranted.\r"

With progression in the severity of histological cirrhosis there was a steady fall in effective liver blood flow as measured with radioisotope labelled colloid. This corresponded to a rise in portal pressure and shunting with a close correlation between the two (r = 0.7, p less than 0.01). In control animals and when portal hypertension was caused by extrahepatic obstruction, beta-blockade with propranolol, but not selective beta 2 blockade, significantly decreased liver blood flow. With cirrhosis there was a variable response to propranolol depending on the histological severity of disease, the height of portal pressure and degree of shunting. There is a possibility therefore that a potential may exist for lowering portal pressure by manipulating intrahepatic shunting.\r"

Use of the contraceptive pill (four of 11 women) was identified as a possible risk factor; one patient had previously been exposed to vinyl chloride monomer. Detailed investigation showed that the primary tumour was extrahepatic in nine of the 25 patients. Distinguishing features of the 15 patients with confirmed primary hepatic sarcoma included a lower incidence of multiple hepatic lesions and a shorter time from first symptoms to diagnosis, but the most valuable discriminator was histology. Angiosarcomas and undifferentiated tumours were all of hepatic origin, epithelioid haemangioendotheliomas (EHAE) occurred as primary and secondary lesions and all other differentiated tumours arose outside the liver. The retroperitoneum was the most common site of an occult primary tumour and its careful examination therefore crucial: computed tomography scanning was found least fallible in this respect in the present series. Where resection (or transplantation), the best treatment, was not possible, results of therapy were disappointing, prognosis being considerably worse for patients with primary hepatic tumours. Patients with EHAE had a better overall prognosis regardless of primary site.\r"

Bile acid metabolism was studied using bile sampling and 14C-deoxycholate kinetics in patients with colonic adenomatous polyps before and after four and 12 weeks of lactulose, 60 g/day. The results indicate that lactulose decreased the deoxycholate pool size from a mean of 22.0 (SD: +/- 13.8) to 14.3 (+/- 7.6) mumol/kg (p less than 0.025). Deoxycholate absorption fell from 3.8 (+/- 2.3) to 2.9 (+/- 1.4 mumol/kg/d (ns). The biliary bile acid composition decreased significantly in deoxycholate after four and 12 weeks with a rise in primary bile acids. There was a highly significant correlation between the %-change in DCA input and the %-change in DCA pool size (r = 0.89). Intestinal transit measured by the pellet method (4.1 +/- 1.9 to 2.4 +/- 0.6 day; p less than 0.01) and faecal pH decreased, while stool frequency and weight rose significantly. Significant correlations between the %-change in gut transit time and the %-change in DCA pool size or %-change in DCA input were absent. The results show that it is possible to lower colonic secondary bile acid absorption by long term lactulose feeding. This effect can be mediated by accelerated transit and the acidification of the colonic contents.\r"

To determine the cellular basis of these effects, the Na+ and K+ transport properties of epithelial cell membranes in rat distal colon were studied in vitro five hours after in vivo treatment with dexamethasone 600 micrograms/100 g body weight. Compared with control tissues, dexamethasone increased transepithelial voltage 3.5-fold (p less than 0.001) and short circuit current 4.5-fold (p less than 0.001), and decreased total resistance by 20% (p less than 0.005). Measurements of cell membrane voltages obtained with intracellular microelectrodes indicated that the dexamethasone-induced rise in transepithelial voltage reflected a significant decrease (p less than 0.05) in apical membrane voltage, consistent with the induction of apical Na+ channels and the stimulation of electrogenic Na+ absorption. Apical addition of 10(-4) mol/l amiloride (a Na+ channel blocker) and then 30 mmol/l tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA; a K+ channel blocker) to control tissues had little or no effect on transepithelial electrical parameters, indicating the absence of significant apical Na+ and K+ conductances. In contrast, in dexamethasone treated tissues, amiloride and TEA produced electrical changes that were consistent with the inhibition of glucocorticoid-induced apical Na+ and K+ conductances. Kinetic studies of the basolateral membrane Na+-K+ pump revealed that five hours after administration, dexamethasone had no effect on the maximum capacity of the pump for Na+ transport, but significantly increased the affinity of the pump for Na+, and the number of Na+ ions binding to each pump site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In buffer with pH 7.56 the mean rat colonic surface pH was 6.72. Lowering the buffer pH in steps resulted in a small fall in surface pH, the values being buffer pH 7.06 surface pH 6.64, buffer pH 6.58 surface pH 6.61 and finally buffer pH 6.09 surface pH 6.39. Similar results were obtained with a buffer where butyrate, 30 mmol/l replaced chloride and when a CO2/bicarbonate buffer was used. During the time taken for the study transmural potential difference only changed by 1-2 mV. Serosal surface pH changed with buffer pH, suggesting that the maintained surface pH is a property of the mucosal surface only. The surface pH of human rectal mucosa was similar to that of rat distal colonic mucosa. As buffer pH fell from pH 7.51 to 5.96 mucosal surface pH only fell from pH 6.80 to 6.26. The values obtained in ulcerative proctitis did not differ from normal mucosa. Secondly pH microelectrodes were used to measure the juxta mucosal pH and the pH-microclimate thickness when luminal pH was controlled. The microclimate had a pH 6.63 adjacent to the mucosa with a thickness of 840 micron. The importance of mucus in maintaining the microclimate was shown by n-acetyl cysteine thinning and prostaglandin E2 thickening the layer. These results describe a surface microclimate in the large intestine of appreciable thickness and a constant juxta mucosal pH. Luminal pH changes produce only a small change in microclimate pH.\r"

  ".W": "The motor responses of the small intestine to intraluminal distension were studied proximal and distal to an inflatable balloon in 13 normal volunteers. During fasting, distension rapidly induced a persistent localised inhibition of distal contractile activity with a small proximal increase. Proximally, phase III activity was unaffected during distension but its propagation across and appearance below the balloon was inhibited. Upon deflating the balloon a normal motor pattern rapidly returned. Similar changes were observed during distension in the fed state. The changes in the motor pattern resemble those of the intrinsically mediated 'peristaltic reflex', studied in animals, and suggest that in man the response to balloon distension may also be mediated through an intrinsic mechanism. A patient with a visceral neuropathy, studied in a similar manner, had no inhibition of distal motor activity during distension, suggesting a functional defect of the enteric nerves. Further observations of the motor responses to distension in similar patients seem indicated to determine the usefulness of this technique for evaluating enteric nervous system function when an abnormality is suspected.\r"

The late rise has been used as a marker of mouth to caecum transit time, but the source of the early rise has not been satisfactorily explained. We studied in 60 healthy volunteers the source and frequency of the early rise in breath hydrogen after ingestion of a non-absorbable carbohydrate. After ingestion of either lactulose solution (10 g in 150 ml water), lentil soup (46 g carbohydrate) or solid meal containing baked beans (15 g carbohydrate), breath hydrogen was significantly raised above basal concentrations within 10 minutes (81 +/- 27, 395 +/- 138 and 110 +/- 52% above basal respectively). A significant rise in breath hydrogen (75 +/- 21%) occurred 10 minutes after sham lactulose feeding (lactulose applied to oral cavity but not swallowed), but no early peak occurred after sham saccharin feeding (non-fermentable carbohydrate), intragastric or intraduodenal administration of lactulose. Ten of the 12 subjects given lactulose sham feeding were restudied after oral hygiene with chlorhexidine mouthwash. In these the early hydrogen peak was abolished. Oral hygiene also reduced the occurrence and magnitude of the early hydrogen rise after lactulose ingestion. These findings indicate that the early rise in breath hydrogen observed after ingestion of lactulose is produced by interaction with oral bacteria.\r"

For comparison, 11 patients underwent identical 24 hour studies three to 38 months after truncal vagotomy for duodenal ulcer. During treatment with ranitidine median 24 hour intragastric pH, nitrate concentration, and counts of total and nitrate reducing bacteria increased significantly regardless of dietary nitrate content; there was no significant increase in the median day time concentration of N-nitroso compounds. Despite these changes, an acid tide at some point in each 24 hour study period prevented persistent bacterial colonisation of the stomach. There were no significant differences between the biochemical and microbiological changes recorded during one year of treatment with ranitidine, and the observations on patients after truncal vagotomy. One month after stopping one year's treatment with ranitidine all variables examined returned to pretreatment levels. Treatment with ranitidine or vagotomy was associated with significant positive correlations among pH, nitrate concentration and bacterial counts. Correlations between pH and N-nitroso compound concentration and between concentrations of nitrite and N-nitroso compounds were not significant.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of dietary manipulation of fat and fibre on the structural and cell kinetic characteristics of colonic mucosa was studied before and during experimental carcinogenesis in 232 male Albino Swiss rats. Carcinogen treated animals were given 12 weekly injections of azoxymethane (10 mg/kg/week). The animals were divided between four dietary groups (1) high fat, high fibre, (2) low fat, high fibre, (3) high fat, low fibre and (4) low fat, low fibre. Pathological and cell kinetic information together with details of certain faecal characteristics was collected when the animals were killed 4, 20, and 28 weeks after starting their experimental diet. Tumour induction was significantly influenced by diet. The highest risk of colorectal tumour development was found in groups fed diet 3: high fat, low fibre (p less than 0.03). In contrast, diet 2: low fat, high fibre was associated with the lowest risk. The proportion of histologically proven colonic tumours occurring in each dietary group was: diet 1-10.9%, diet 2-3.6%, diet 3-63.7%, diet 4-21.8%. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) studies done on selected samples indicated both dietary and azoxymethane related alterations in crypt unit integrity. The most marked surface architectural changes were seen in carcinogen treated animals maintained on diet 3 (high fat, low fibre). Stathmokinetic analysis revealed considerable intergroup variability. Both fat and fibre produced significant effects, principally during the preneoplastic phase of carcinogenesis. Faster proliferative activity tended to be found in animals at low risk of tumour induction (diet 2), slower proliferation being more characteristic of animals at high risk (p less than 0.05). The findings suggest that both topographical and cell kinetic parameters have an important relationship with promoting and protecting dietary factors during the development of colorectal cancer.\r"

Fifty three patients with acute pancreatitis were studied; 17 with haemorrhagic pancreatitis and 36 with a mild form of the disease. S-phospholipase A2 activity increased significantly (p less than 0.05) in patients with fatal pancreatitis but not in those with mild disease. Phospholipase A2 concentrations were below 10 nmol FFA/ml min in mild, while they rose to 20-40 nmol FFA/ml min in haemorrhagic pancreatitis. In fatal cases very high (up to 50-60 nmol FFA/ml min) serum phospholipase A2 concentrations were recorded. The increase in CRP was greater in the patients with severe pancreatitis. One day after admission mean CRP was 280 mg/l in patients with haemorrhagic and 45 mg/l in those with the mild pancreatitis (p less than 0.001). High CRP values also correlated with the prognostic signs indicative of severe pancreatitis. CRP and S-phospholipase A2 determinations are valuable in the early assessment of the severity of acute pancreatitis, but the CRP assay is much easier to include in hospital routine.\r"

  ".W": "To study the role of calcium movements in mediating the effects of sodium chloride on the response of blood pressure to angiotensin II (ANG II), we infused ANG II before and after giving calcium channel blocking drugs (nifedipine and diltiazem) and calcium infusions to normal subjects during high and low sodium intakes. ANG II was also in nine patients with essential hypertension eating a low sodium diet. In preliminary studies, the effects of nifedipine, 20 mg p.o., on blood pressure and plasma renin activity were determined. Sensitivity to infused ANG II was calculated as the slope of the linear regression of the increase in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) expressed as a function of the ANG II infusion rate (mm Hg/ng ANG II/kg/min). During intake of a high sodium diet (Na, 200 mEq/day) both drugs significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced ANG II sensitivity, while on a low sodium diet (10 mEq Na), neither drug reduced ANG II sensitivity. There was a significant (p less than 0.001) inverse correlation between the initial ANG II-DBP sensitivity and the change in sensitivity induced by the calcium channel blocking drugs in normal subjects (r = -0.78) and in hypertensive patients (r = -0.70). Five hypertensive patients had greater than normal ANG II-DBP sensitivity that was significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced by nifedipine. Calcium infusion did not affect the ANG II-DBP sensitivity on either diet. The results suggest that in normal subjects increased DBP responses to ANG II, induced by an increase in sodium intake, are partially mediated by increased extracellular to intracellular calcium movements, since they are blocked by the structurally different calcium channel blocking drugs nifedipine and diltiazem. In hypertensive patients on a low sodium diet, increased DBP responses to ANG II infusion were blocked by nifedipine, indicating they are at least partly mediated by increased extracellular to intracellular calcium flux.\r"

  ".W": "Ionic, hormonal, and blood pressure responses to a single oral dose of the calcium channel blocker nifedipine were assessed in 25 essential hypertensive subjects. When grouped according to their renin-sodium profile, low renin subjects had a greater hypotensive response to nifedipine (change in diastolic blood pressure -20.0 +/- 1.4 vs -6.4 +/- 1.0%; p less than 0.005) than did high renin hypertensive subjects. The initial level of serum ionized calcium predicted the blood pressure response to nifedipine (r = 0.70, p less than 0.001), as did the initial plasma renin activity (r = 0.65, p less than 0.005). Nifedipine induced a transient rise in serum ionized calcium (from 2.22 +/- 0.02 to 2.28 +/- 0.02 mEq/L; p less than 0.01), while plasma renin activity was consistently elevated compared with initial values at 30 (p less than 0.01), 60 (p less than 0.01), and 120 (p less than 0.05) minutes after drug administration. By comparison, plasma aldosterone levels did not rise and even declined at 30 (p less than 0.01), 60 (p less than 0.05), and 120 (p less than 0.05) minutes after nifedipine. These results suggest that low renin hypertension is more critically dependent on extracellular calcium than are higher renin forms and demonstrate that levels of serum ionized calcium, plasma renin activity, or both may predict the sensitivity of blood pressure to calcium channel blockade. Lastly, calcium may play a pivotal role in vivo in coupling renin stimulation to adrenal aldosterone responses.\r"

Baseline forearm vascular resistance was greater in the elderly group compared with the younger hypertensive men. However, forearm vascular resistance responses to selective unloading of low pressure cardiopulmonary baroreceptors were similar in the two groups. This finding suggests that normal vascular responses to the unloading of cardiopulmonary baroreceptors are preserved in subjects with advancing age and mild to moderate hypertension. Baseline plasma norepinephrine levels, as well as norepinephrine responses to lower body negative pressure, were comparable in the two groups. This finding suggests that, unlike normotensive subjects, essential hypertensive subjects do not have an age-related increase in sympathetic nervous system activity.\r"
