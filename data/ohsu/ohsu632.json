All patients treated with observation had a rib vertebral angle difference (RVAD) of less than 10 degrees; whereas patients progressing despite orthosis and all but one patient requiring operation had an RVAD greater than 10 degrees. Thoracic hypokyphosis (less than 20 degrees) was present in 20% of observed patients, 64% of those treated with an orthosis, and 78% of those requiring operation.\r"

Fifty males with idiopathic scoliosis satisfied entry requirements for this study: standing posteroanterior (PA) spine radiograph measuring a curve greater than 20 degrees, preoperative observation for greater than 1 year (mean, 4.4 years), and nonoperative patients with greater than 5 years of radiographic follow-up beyond skeletal maturity (mean, 10.7 years). Mean rate of curve progression from presentation to Risser 4 maturation was 3.0 degrees/year. Forty-four percent of the curves progressed 5 degrees or more between Risser 4 and 5. The rate of curve progression following Risser 5 was 0.18 degrees/year. Thoracic curves were associated with a higher degree of curve progression than other curve types (P less than 0.05). There was no statistically significant association between curve progression and family history, vertebral rotation, Risser sign, or curve magnitude. Curve progression secondary to growth usually terminates at Risser 4 in females with idiopathic scoliosis. This study indicated that scoliotic male curves demonstrated clinically significant progression until Risser 5 rather than Risser 4. Thus, the authors conclude that males with idiopathic scoliosis curves greater than 20 degrees should be followed radiographically until Risser 5. In females, scoliosis beyond Risser 4 can be considered as an adult curve; however, in males, scoliosis can be evaluated as an adult curve only after Risser 5. Beyond Risser 5, male curves demonstrate minimal progression.\r"

Seven age-, sex-, height-, and weight-matched subjects were used as controls. The mean bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine was 0.975, compared with 1.130 for the control group, significant at P less than 0.025. For patients with a kyphosis greater than 45 degrees, the BMD was 0.913, significant at P less than 0.005. The mean BMD of the femoral neck was 1.00, compared with 1.22, significant at P less than 0.005. For patients with a kyphosis greater than 45 degrees, the femoral neck BMD is 0.983, significant at P less than 0.005. The BMD of the radius by single photon absorptiometry was 0.689, compared with 0.748 in the controls, which was not significant. In patients with a kyphosis greater than 45 degrees, the BMD was 0.655, which is significant at P less than 0.01. A highly significant association exists between osteoporosis and Scheuermann's disease. Further investigation is indicated to determine the role of medical management in the treatment of these patients.\r"

In three of 30 patients tested, the derotation maneuver altered CMAP but not SSEP. In ten dogs, we observed similar dissociation with decrease or disappearance of CMAP amplitude and unchanged SSEP after ligation of the thoracoabdominal aorta or intercostal arteries at each level. In contrast, both CMAP and SSEP were unchanged by clamping the artery at the lumbar level. This is likely due to the lack of collateral vascular flow at the thoracic cord level, the anterior cord in particular, which is mainly supplied by a single large radicular artery (Adamkiewicz artery). These findings support that the CMAP and SSEP are mediated through two independent pathways located in the anterior and posterior spinal cord, respectively. We postulate that the dissociate alteration of CMAP and SSEP by derotation maneuver is due to greater vulnerability of the anterior cord or motor tract to ischemia caused by the displacement of anterior spinal or radiculomedullary artery. Therefore, the patients requiring major derotation procedure would benefit from CMAP monitoring, which provides more sensitive measure of anterior cord function that the conventional SSEP monitoring.\r"

Often, the biomechanical evaluation is done in a nonstandardized manner, which makes it difficult to compare the results of one researcher with those of another, for the same device or for different devices. There is a need for a conceptual framework under which guidelines may be suggested for the evaluation of these devices in some uniform and comprehensive manner. There are three basic biomechanical tests: strength, fatigue, and stability. The strength test evaluates the failure load of the device, determines its weak points, and is helpful in the initial development of the device. The fatigue test provides a measure of longevity of the device, either alone or as part of the spinal construct, by testing the device to failure using cyclically varying loads. In contrast, the stability test measures the capability of the device to provide multi-directional stability to the injured spine. There is no failure of the device, and the results of this test are clinically important, as they characterize the potential for early fracture healing and early fusion. A conceptual framework for the evaluation of multi-direction stability of spinal fixation devices and guidelines for designing the necessary experiments are described.\r"

The angle of rotation relative to the sagittal plane (RAsag) improved from 15.2 degrees preoperatively to 13.4 degrees postoperatively (14.3%). The kyphotic angle increased an average of 10.6 degrees in the 14 patients whose preoperative angle was less than 25 degrees.

Mechanical testing in six stiffness modes confirmed the advantage of vascularized grafts. The experimental results indicate that vascularized grafts retain greater viability and better mechanical properties during graft incorporation. Providing a vascularized construct may be helpful in reconstructing large vertebral osseous gaps.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the unfused segments of the lumbar spine in patients who had Harrington instrumentation and fusion for idiopathic scoliosis. Forty-eight patients, with an average follow-up of 11 years, were evaluated. The translational motion in the unfused segments below the instrumented levels was measured, using lateral flexion and extension radiographs of the lumbar spine. This motion was compared with values obtained from an earlier study of asymptomatic nonscoliotic individuals. The amount of disc space narrowing, retrolisthesis, length and level of the fusion, and the presence of traction spurs also were recorded. The incidence of low-back pain was highest in those patients fused to L4 (62%). Individuals instrumented and fused to L3 or L4 had significantly more translational motion in the adjacent lower interspace when compared with the control group (P = 0.05 and P = 0.001, respectively). Increased translational motion correlated with the presence of low-back pain in patients fused to L4. Retrolisthesis occurred in 81% of patients instrumented to L4, in 40% of those fused to L3, and was not found in patients fused to high levels. Its presence was strongly associated with low-back pain. There was no relationship between low-back pain and traction spurs, length of the fusion mass, lumbar lordosis, or width of the disc space in the unfused lower levels. The authors conclude that retrolisthesis and increased translational motion are important factors in determining low-back pain following surgery for idiopathic scoliosis. Instrumentation to L4 should be avoided if possible.\r"

  ".W": "In an experimental rat model of neoplastic spinal cord compression, the in vivo effect of steroidal and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents on the water content, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production, and specific gravity of the compressed cord segments were assessed, as well as the effect on the course of the disease. Paraplegic animals presented a consistent increase in the water content, PGE2 synthesis, and specific gravity in the compressed cord segments. The effect of treatment given on onset of paraplegia with either dexamethasone sodium phosphate (Dex-p; 10 mg/kg twice daily), or free dexamethasone (F-dex; 8.25 mg/kg twice daily) or indomethacin (10 mg/kg twice daily), was evaluated after 30 hours of therapy. Both F-dex and indomethacin eliminated spinal cord edema but varied in the rate of inhibitory effect on PGE2 production (dexamethasone less than indomethacin). Dexamethasone sodium phosphate failed to reduce spinal cord edema and PGE2 synthesis, but specific gravity changes were corrected by each of the administered agents. Evaluation of the effect of treatment on the course of the disease required dose reduction by 50% for Dex-p and F-dex, and to 25% for indomethacin, to avoid lethal toxicity. Treatment was started on appearance of the first sign of neurologic dysfunction (Grade 1) and continued to paraplegia (Grade 5). In the saline-treated rats, the mean time interval between Grades 1 and 5 was 2.7 +/- 0.3 days. Free dexamethasone, Dex-p, and indomethacin significantly prolonged this interval by 57%, 54%, and 48% respectively (P less than 0.005). The three agents differed in their ability to control the increases in water content and in PGE2 production, but proved almost equally effective in the prompt control of the specific gravity changes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The nucleus pulposus of this type is replaced by a different type of nucleus pulposus, composed of fibrocartilage and dense fibrous tissue at the first half of the second decade. In the adult, the nucleus pulposus shows morphologically high cell activities near the cartilaginous end-plate, including a process suggestive of regeneration. The surface layer of the cartilaginous end-plate and adjacent layer of the nucleus pulposus seems to play an important role in the maintenance of the nucleus pulposus. Both the calcification within the cartilaginous end-plate, accompanied by bone formation, and its superficial detachment, seems to destroy this layer and lead up to the obliteration of the disc.\r"

Spinal cord transverse area and compression ratio (sagittal diameter divided by transverse diameter) were measured as indicators of spinal cord morphology. As a basis for this study, we first performed CTM of cadaveric cervical columns and compared the actual dimensions of the spinal cord of the cadaveric specimens with the CTM image. Second, the correlations between these dimensions and pathology of the affected spinal cord were investigated. The results showed that CTM provided a precise image of the actual cross-section of the spinal cord. In 12 cadaveric specimens of cervical myelopathy examined, the transverse area and compression ratio were in good correlation with the severity of observed pathological changes.\r"

The spinal level recording the highest grade of ESCP, which was mostly positive wave, generally corresponded to the level that was clearly diagnosed as the main lesion by neurologic and radiologic examinations, such as a case of single level disc hernia. With these techniques, the level diagnostic rates of primary lesions were 94.7% in posterior recordings and 74.1% in anterior recordings.\r"

The number of children screened through this Chiba University Medical School (CUMS) screening program to 1986 amounted to 1,246,798. The incidence of scoliosis of more than 15 degrees increased linearly according to age from the fifth grade primary school children (0.07% in boys, 0.44% in girls) to the second grade junior high school students (0.25% in boys, 1.77% in girls). The female predominance of scoliosis cases with curvatures of more than 20 degrees detected during the total period was 10:1 and this female predominance was the same for primary school children and junior high school students. According to a study of the incidence of scoliosis by districts, (areas were divided according to population density and urbanization) there were no significant differences in the fifth grade primary school children between the sparsely and densely populated areas. In the cases of children beyond the fifth grade primary school level, however, the incidence in the densely populated areas were significantly higher than those in the sparsely populated districts. The incidence of scoliosis of more than 20 degrees decreased significantly every year among junior high school students, because they were screened periodically in school and the scoliotic students who had already been detected were left out of the next screening. This study establishes that screening for scoliosis by the CUMS screening program is cost-effective with a low risk of radiation hazards.\r"

Through a multiple regression analysis, an equation was obtained to correlate the predictive and the real progression within 10 degrees deviation.\r"

The authors prefer the extrapleural approach to the thoracic vertebrae because of simplified postoperative care with minimum surgical interference with respiratory function. During the past 16 years, 23 patients with symptomatic thoracic disc herniation have been treated by this procedure. Preoperatively all 23 patients presented with some measure of paraplegia, with difficulty in walking. Their clinical presentation was analyzed and diagnostic aids to the thoracic disc herniation by radiographic examinations were assessed. The radiographic abnormality of ossification of the yellow ligament (OYL) coinciding with the involved thoracic disc level was noted. The results in all 23 patients with this procedure were favorable. Based on the results of this series, this procedure is recommended for the treatment of symptomatic thoracic disc herniation.\r"

Bony union at both fibular ends occurred mostly at 12 weeks postoperative. Vascular patency was evaluated by scintigram using 99m TcMDP. All patients showed positive uptake in the shape of the grafted fibula at 1, 3, and 8 weeks postoperative. Without exception, serial roentgenograms demonstrated rapid incorporation of the graft into the vertebral bodies, without any phase of creeping substitution. This method provides stable and long-standing anterior struts, essential in the management of high grades of kyphosis.\r"

Strong stimulation at a high frequency of 50 to 100 Hz was effective for increasing the blood flow. In the spinal cord, an increase of the local metabolic rate appeared to be important for the blood flow increase. In the nerve root, the sympathetic nerves may have an important effect in the blood flow increase.\r"

Water content and fixed charge density in the intervertebral disc fractions also were measured (Experiment 2). The cations and uncharged small solutes transported into the disc tissue ranged in descending order from nucleus pulposus, lateral annulus, posterior annulus, to anterior annulus. The authors also calculated theoretically the swelling pressure of the proteoglycan in the intervertebral disc fractions from the results of Experiment 2. It was concluded that swelling pressure was highest in the nucleus pulposus, and lowest in the anterior annulus. The water in the posterior annulus is less exchangeable than in the other disc tissue fractions.\r"

Repeated vibratory load for 18 and 42 hours duration showed the recovery of 3H2O concentration of the intervertebral disc without anesthesia. Computer simulation suggested a reduction of blood flow surrounding the intervertebral disc following the vibration stress. However, no reduction of the 3H2O concentration in the intervertebral disc was noted under anesthesia. Emotional stress cannot be excluded as a factor in water metabolism in the intervertebral disc.\r"

  ".W": "The increased popularity of pedicle fixation prompted research to address two issues: the reliability and validity of roentgenograms as a technique for evaluating the success of pedicle fixation, and the effects of surgical factors on successful fixation. Thus, does approach--the point and angle of screw insertion, surgeon experience, practice, level of the spine involved, and screw size--effect success of pedicle fixation? Eight fresh thoracolumbar spines were harvested and cleaned of all soft tissues. Two surgeons, one more experienced in pedicle fixation than the other, used two pedicle fixation approaches (Weinstein and Roy-Camille) on both the left and right sides at levels T11-S1 of each specimen. All screws were placed under anteroposterior (AP) and lateral c-arm control. For specimens 1 to 3, 5.5 mm screws were used at T11-L1, and 7.0 mm screws at L2-S1. Unacceptable failure rates at L2 and L3 for the first three specimens resulted in a change of instrumentation for the remaining specimens, with 5.5 mm screws used at T11-L3 and 7.0 mm screws at L4-S1. When surgeons completed the fixations for a specimen, AP and lateral roentgenograms were taken and both surgeons independently evaluated the films to assess the success of each fixation. Failure was defined as evidence of any cortical perforation on any side of the pedicle in or outside of the spinal canal. After completing the roentgenogram evaluation, the specimen was transected in the midline, and the success of each pedicle fixation was evaluated by visual/tactile inspection. There were no disagreements between surgeons on the visual/tactile evaluations of the specimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Cadaveric lumbar motion segments were loaded to simulate backward bending (extension) movements of the lumbar spine. The motion segments' resistance was measured initially, and after the spinous processes and apophyseal joints had been cut through in turn. Compression tests were then performed on the discs while they were wedged in full extension. The results showed that extension is resisted mainly by the disc and spinous processes, and that, in hyperextension, damage usually occurs first in the spinous processes (or the soft tissue squashed between them). However, if the spinous processes are particularly widely spaced, then the apophyseal joints can become damaged first. The protection offered the disc by the neural arch is greater in young people, and after the disc height has been reduced by creep loading. The disc can be damaged in hyperextension if the spine is subjected to high compressive forces at the same time. A sudden application of compressive force can cause an anterior disc prolapse, while a cyclic (fatigue) compressive force can increase the posterior bulging of the lamellas in the posterior annulus.\r"

The distribution of the IARs was found to fall within a small range from the mean location at each level, particularly for the movement of flexion from the extended position. Within-observer and between-observer errors occurred in tracing and superimposing radiographs and marking x and y coordinates. Unacceptably large errors occur when the movement of the joint is less than 5 degrees, and only the IAR for flexion from extension can be plotted with acceptable confidence. This result invalidates the notion that plotting centrodes may be of diagnostic value in recognizing mechanical disorders. The determination of a single extension to flexion IAR may be of more value clinically, to which end this study provides essential normative data.\r"

  ".W": "In a controlled prospective study, 33 rabbits were used to compare the efficacy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to scintigraphy in diagnosing pyogenic infection of the intervertebral disc. A suitable inoculum of Staphylococcus aureus (10(8) organisms) was injected into a test level while a similar volume of sterile culture medium was injected into a control disc in each animal. Plain radiographs, MRI, and scintigraphic bone images then were performed at regular intervals after operation. The imaging studies were interpreted blind, as was the final histologic assessment. Five animals died of respiratory complications following sedation. In the remaining 28 animals, 23 developed infection at the test level, and four developed infection at the control disc. Magnetic resonance imaging was found to be more sensitive than scintigraphy in diagnosing discitis, particularly in the early stages of the disease. The overall results showed MRI had a sensitivity of 93%, specificity of 97%, and accuracy of 95%. There were two false-negative results and one false-positive. In contrast, scintigraphy had a sensitivity of 41%, specificity of 93%, and accuracy of 68%. There were two false-positive and 16 false-negative results. Plain radiographs had a sensitivity of 82%, specificity of 93%, and accuracy of 88%. There were two false-positive and five false-negative results. The MRI appearance of discitis was characteristic from an early stage in the disease, and preceded the changes on scintigraphy and plain radiographs by several days in the majority of cases.\r"

Twenty-five patients underwent surgery on 31 discs, allowing anatomic confirmation of the diagnosis. Surgical findings supported the MRI diagnosis at 28 of 31 levels (90.3% accuracy), whereas the CT diagnosis correctly reflected only 24 of 31 levels (77.4% accuracy). Discrepancy between MRI and CT interpretation occurred at ten levels that were surgically explored. Computed tomography (CT) was incorrect at seven levels, and MRI was in error at three levels. The sensitivity of MRI was 91.7%, compared with 83.3% for CT, and the MRI specificity of 100% was superior to 71.4% for CT. This study demonstrates the clinical superiority of surface coil MRI over contrast CT in the evaluation of lumbar disc herniation. Surface coil MRI can be used as the initial diagnostic procedure for a suspected herniated lumbar disc, using invasive contrast studies and CT, if required, to clarify an equivocal MRI finding.\r"

Histology revealed evidence for proliferative fronts of fibroblastic cells in herniated discs with hypocellular interiors.

Analysis of structural changes by computed tomography showed rotation of the apical vertebra about the longitudinal axis. Rib cage deformity was diagnosed in 82% of the rabbits. The experimental model developed for induction of scoliosis is simple. The surgical procedure involves just one selected and easily recognized anatomic structure, leaving the vertebral structures and their vicinity intact. Reliable analysis of the underlying mechanism of the developing scoliosis is thereby assured.\r"

The authors' hypothesis was that a factor that is involved in the development of the scoliotic curvature, would be present also in nonscoliotic siblings to scoliosis patients, as AIS is a hereditary transmitted disease. Postural function in 100 siblings to scoliotic children was investigated by means of stabilometry, and compared with a matched control group of healthy children, as well as a group of scoliotic children. The siblings showed a postural control function that was significantly different from both of the other groups. The siblings had a postural sway that was less than the sway measured in both controls and scoliosis patients. The sway was also more asymmetrical than in the two other groups. In the authors' opinion, the presence of this postural aberration in siblings indicates that it is a factor in the etiology of AIS.\r"

Three hundred and ninety completed the protocol, which included a lumbar motion pain assessment before and after facet injection. A total of 127 variables were studied. There were 229 males and 161 females with a median age of 38. Facet joint arthrograms were performed prior to intra-articular injection of local anesthetic and cortisone. Initial mean pain relief was only 29%. Variables correlating significantly (P less than 0.05) with more postinjection pain relief were older age, prior history of low-back pain, normal gait, maximum pain on extension following forward flexion in the standing position, and the absence of leg pain, muscle spasm and aggravation of pain on Valsalva. Greatest pain relief immediately after injection was seen with lumbar extension and rotation, motions reported to stress the facet joints or aggravate pain of facet joint origin. Patients with more pain on lumbar extension and rotation as a group, however, did not get more pain relief. From this study we were not able to identify clinical facet joint syndromes or predict patients responding better to this procedure. The facet joints were not commonly the single or primary source for low-back pain in the great majority (greater than 90%) of patients studied.\r"

Both the absolute rate of synthesis and the topographical variation in chondrocyte activity changed with age; the most active cells in the adult were found in the mid-annulus region, whereas in the fetal disc the cells in the inner annulus were the most active. The conditions under which the tissue was stored, and changes in hydration during culture, had considerable effects on synthesis. Pathological discs had a wide range of biological activity that reflected the heterogeneous properties of these specimens. It is suggested that this culture method provides a means of investigating the way in which the synthesis of the macromolecular components of the intervertebral disc are coordinated and subsequently incorporated into the extracellular matrix.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that reduction of precise motor control accompanies local muscular fatigue. The effects of isodynamic fatiguing of flexion and extension trunk movements on the movement patterns and the motor output of the trunk were investigated. Twenty male subjects with no history of low-back pain for the past 6 months volunteered for the study. A triaxial dynamometer was used that simultaneously provided measurement of torque, angular position and velocity of each axis. Resistances were set independently for each axis by an interfaced computer. The subjects performed trunk flexion and extension movement against a sagittal plane resistance equal to 70% of their maximum isometric extension strength in the upright position. The minimum resistances in the coronal and transverse planes were set up at 7 Newton meters. The subjects were asked to perform trunk movement as quickly and as accurately as possible while exerting the maximum efforts until exhaustion. Analysis of variance, the MANOVA procedure with a repeated measure design, was performed among the selected parameters of the first, middle and last three repetition cycles. The selected parameters are the trunk motor output and movement patterns; the total angular excursion, range of motion, maximum and average torque and angular velocity of the trunk. All the selected parameters were significantly reduced in the sagittal plane. Subjects displayed significantly less motor control and greater range of motion in the coronal and transverse planes in performing the primary task of flexion and extension. The reduction in the functional capacity of the primary muscles performing the required task is compensated by secondary muscle groups and the spinal structure is loaded in a more injury prone pattern, as identified by finite element models. In addition it is suggested that the fatigued muscles would be less able to compensate any perturbation in the load or position of the trunk. The repetitive loading results in a weakening of the viscoelastic passive elements of the spineless structure. The loss of ability to protect these weakened passive elements makes the spine susceptible to industrial and recreational injuries.\r"

However, equipment for performing such tests is expensive to buy, complex to run, and requires technical expertise and clinical volume unavailable in most physician offices. In this study, a new dynamic test known as Progressive Isoinertial Lifting Evaluation (PILE) is described, which draws upon prior psychophysical and isoinertial methods. An industrial sample of 61 male and 31 female incumbent workers were tested using the PILE, and a variety of anthropometric normalizing factors were evaluated. The isolation of an \"Adjusted Weight\" (AW) normalizing factor is documented, after which normative data are presented for male and female workers utilizing lumbar (0-30 inches) and cervical (30-54 inches) dynamic protocols.\r"

In the second part of this study, 100 chronically disabled low-back pain patients (57 men and 43 women) were studied at two points: 1) at initial evaluation, when referred for possible entry into a comprehensive Functional Restoration treatment program; and 2) at the conclusion of the treatment (an average 7 weeks later). Results of simultaneous lumbar PILE and Cybex Liftask (Lumex, Ronkonkoma, NY) tests are presented, showing that patients may frequently double or triple initial lifting capacity after undergoing the functional restoration training program, achieving lifting levels at or above normal for incumbent industrial workers. Overall, results demonstrate that the PILE test can be an effective baseline screening test for lifting capacity under certain circumstances. Although several drawbacks affecting the PILE as an isolated test are discussed, its usefulness as part of a battery of physical capacity tests making up a quantitative functional evaluation is clearly demonstrated. Finally, the potential use of PILE as a safe, inexpensive, simple, and relevant screening test for frequent lifting capacity in worker selection is discussed.\r"

The two groups achieved similar maximum heart rates (mean (SD) 176(12) and 175(10) beats/min). After allowance for confounding factors the asthmatic subjects had a lower maximum oxygen consumption (VO2 max) (by 199 ml min-1) than control subjects. Having asthma also accounted for a significant reduction in anaerobic threshold (125 ml min-1) and oxygen pulse (0.805 ml/beat). There was no correlation of FEV1 with VO2 max, anaerobic threshold, or oxygen pulse either before or after bronchodilator. The dyspnoea index (VE/MVV%) was increased in the asthmatic subjects at peak exercise, but was less than 60% in all subjects at a workload that produced 75% of the predicted maximum heart rate. Thus the asthmatic subjects had a maximum heart rate similar to that of normal subjects but the low VO2 max, anaerobic threshold, and oxygen pulse suggest suboptimal fitness, which was not directly due to airflow obstruction. All had sufficient ventilatory reserve to allow toleration of training at a work intensity adequate to permit improvements in cardiovascular fitness.\r"

  ".W": "Non-adrenergic inhibitory nerves may have an important role in regulating airway calibre. A recently discovered peptide, peptide histidine valine, is a potent relaxer of airway smooth muscle in vitro and has been proposed as a possible neurotransmitter in this tissue. The cardiovascular and respiratory effects of graded infusions of this peptide (2.5-10 pmol kg-1 min-1) have been examined in six normal subjects in a placebo controlled, randomised double blind study. The mean (SEM) peak plasma concentration of peptide histidine valine during the highest infusion rate was 2392 (170) pmol/l, representing a 29 fold increase above the basal concentration. This was accompanied by flushing, a significant increase in heart rate of 28 (3.7) beats/min and skin temperature of 1.8 degrees (0.16 degrees) C, but no effect on systolic or diastolic blood pressure. Despite these high plasma concentrations of the peptide and the substantial tachycardia and increase in skin blood flow, there was no change in partial expiratory flow at 40% of vital capacity (Vp40) or in the airway response to inhaled histamine (geometric PD40 9.37 and 9.73 mumol during saline and peptide histidine valine infusion respectively). Although these findings provide no support for a physiological role of peptide histidine valine in controlling airway function in healthy subjects, important effects of locally released peptides in the vasoactive intestinal peptide family cannot be excluded.\r"

The response of TGV and Raw to salbutamol was analysed by circular statistics, enabling analysis of coupled, directional data. Thirty minutes after administration of the first dose of salbutamol there was a reduction in TGV or Raw in 21 of the 24 infants, 11 showing a decrease in TGV (\"volume responder\") and 10 a fall in Raw (\"flow responder\").

After allowance had been made for age, stature, and smoking habit the quantitative score for area of diffuse pleural thickening seen in profile on both lateral chest walls contributed to reductions in inspiratory capacity, expiratory reserve volume, and forced expiratory flow rates. Occlusion of one or both costophrenic angles in the presence of diffuse thickening was associated with further reduction in inspiratory capacity. Profusion of small opacities was associated with a reduction in transfer factor. Diffuse pleural thickening and occlusion of costophrenic angles were associated with relatively low values for the forced expiratory flow rates (MEF50FVC) and FEV1/FVC, whereas small opacities were associated with relatively high values. Thus overall increased, normal, or reduced values of MEF50FVC and FEV1/FVC might occur, depending on the distribution of the radiographic abnormalities. The findings contribute to the validation of the ILO pleural scores; those for diffuse pleural thickening and occlusion of costophrenic angles should be used jointly with the scores for profusion of parenchymal small opacities in interpreting the lung function of persons exposed to asbestos.\r"

  ".W": "Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in eight patients with biopsy proved sarcoidosis and eight control subjects matched for age and smoking habit, three sequential 60 ml aliquots of sterile saline being used. Each aliquot was aspirated and analysed separately to determine total and differential cell counts. Cellular metabolic activity was stimulated with latex and measured by means of luminol enhanced chemiluminescence to assess neutrophil activity and lucigenin enhanced chemiluminescence to assess macrophage activity. In control subjects mean total cell counts were significantly greater in the second aspirate than in the first, but fell slightly in the third. Similarly, in the patients with sarcoidosis mean total cell counts increased from aspirate 1 to a maximum in aspirate 2, before falling again marginally in aspirate 3. The only significant difference in cell counts between patients with sarcoidosis and controls was an approximately threefold increase in total lymphocyte counts in the former in each of the three aspirates. Luminol chemiluminescence was similar in patients with sarcoidosis to that in controls in the first aspirate, but was significantly greater in the second and third aspirates. Lucigenin chemiluminescence was also significantly greater in the second and third aspirates only. Thus in patients with sarcoidosis lymphocyte numbers are increased in all three aspirates whereas cellular metabolic activity is increased to a greater extent in later aspirates, which may reflect events occurring in the periphery of the lung segment.\r"

We found a significant decrease in hospital mortality from 26.6% to 12.9% despite the admission of older patients to our CCU. Mean age for men was 63.8 vs. 65.6 years and for women, 69.8 vs. 72.3. The incidence of previous hypertension and diabetes was higher and the incidence of heart failure and angina lower in 1984-85. No differences were noted as regards the incidence of ventricular fibrillation, atrial fibrillation and AV-block III in the acute phase despite a much more frequent use of antiarrhythmics in 1969 (33% vs. 4%). A decreased use of cardiac glucosides was also noted (34% vs. 16%). Asystole, however, was noted in 10% of the patients in 1969 compared with 3% in our patients. beta-Adrenergic blockers were not used in 1969 but commonly given in 1984-85 (67%), also in those with heart failure (54%). Delay between onset of symptoms and admission was longer in 1969, 47% being admitted within 6 hours compared with 75% in 1984-85. In conclusion, our study shows a marked change in the use of various cardiac drugs in the treatment of MI. Differences between the populations as regards mortality and different clinical findings are more difficult to evaluate and may also be explained by change in the selection of patients treated in the CCU.\r"

Triglycerides were 0.27 mmol/l and 0.22 mmol/l higher in treated than in untreated men and women (p less than 0.01). Normotensive men and women had 0.33 mmol/l and 0.10 mmol/l lower triglycerides than untreated (p less than 0.01). The results suggest that the increased cholesterol in hypertensives was present originally, while the decreased HDL cholesterol and elevated triglycerides probably were evoked by drugs. The importance of consideration of the whole constellation of risk factors in order to reduce the mortality from coronary heart disease by antihypertensive drug treatment is emphasized.\r"

Ongoing treatment with diuretics at the time of admission did not appear to be of any significance for the development of ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. Out of 100 hypokalemic patients, only 33 were treated with diuretics. The main reason for hypokalemia in the early phase of an acute myocardial infarction is most likely an activation of the sympathetic nervous system leading to an influx of potassium from the extracellular to the intracellular body fluid compartment.\r"

Significant age differences were not observed for relative mortality. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model showed long-term mortality to be independently related to higher age, a reduced working activity before the MI, previous cardiovascular disease, and a higher inhospital complication score, which was computed by summing eight defined clinical events weighted for severity. The results indicate that a reasonable prediction of long-term survival after a MI can be made from routine hospital data.\r"

The mean displacement during systole was 16 mm towards the apex. There was no significant difference in the recordings from the four sites. The study population was divided into three groups with mean ages 28, 42 and 60 years (group I, II and III). The displacement was significantly smaller in group III compared with groups I and II. Fractional shortening, however, could not demonstrate such a difference. The determination of displacement of the AV plane may imply the introduction of a new and simple method in assessment of left ventricular function.\r"

If the X-ray had revealed a deformity of the duodenal bulb, 30% of the gastroenterologists would offer the patient specific medical treatment (H2-blocking agent etc.), but a significantly higher number of gastroenterologists, 45%, (p less than 0.05) would offer specific medical treatment if a deformity was revealed at endoscopy. There was also a significant difference (p less than 0.01) between those who would offer specific treatment if X-ray (84%) or if endoscopy (100%) had revealed an ulcer. Considerable variation was found among experts in their decisions on the basis of X-ray and endoscopy in patients with suspected duodenal ulcer disease.

In ELISA, anti-SS-B/La antibodies were detected in sera from 14 (67%) of the patients with primary SS, but only from 12 (38%) of those with PBC. With the Ouchterlony test, anti-SS-A/Ro antibodies were found in sera from 15 (71%) of the primary SS patients, but in no PBC patient. Of those PBC patients investigated prospectively with objective tests, four of 11 (36%) had keratoconjunctivitis sicca, and five of 15 (33%) had pathological sialometry results. In contrast, all PBC patients but one (i.e., 14 of 15 or 93%) showed evidence of focal sialadenitis. In immunochemical study of PBC patients, IgM immunoreactivity was found in the stroma, particularly adjacent to excretory ducts and acini in salivary glands (5 of 5), whereas no such IgM deposits were observed in patients with primary SS (3 of 3), nor in healthy controls (n = 20). We conclude that the frequency of anti-SS-A/Ro and anti-SS-B/La antibodies in serum is lower in PBC patients than in patients with primary SS. The incidence of focal sialadenitis is high in PBC, though only one third of the PBC patients studied here showed clinical evidence of glandular dysfunction. With immunochemical techniques, sialadenitis associated with PBC is distinguishable by its significant IgM reaction from sialadenitis in primary SS.\r"

Total deficiency of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase was confirmed by direct measurements of the enzyme activity in lysed red blood cells. Close family members were also examined for the enzyme defect, revealing no additional homozygotes, but 13 heterozygotes among 14 relatives. We suggest that round, brownish urine crystals, even without radiolucent kidney stones, should alert the physician to search for the existence of 2,8-dihydroxyadenine. Proper treatment could then be instituted without delay, preventing eventual kidney damage.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the role of parturition on lung maturation in sheep, we studied parameters of lung development in singleton fetuses treated with pulsatile adrenocorticotropic hormone or saline solution from day 127 or twin pregnancies in which one fetus only received pulsatile adrenocorticotropic hormone from day 127 until labor occurred. These parameters were compared with those of term fetuses (145 days). Pulsatile adrenocorticotropic hormone provoked labor in a mean (+/- SEM) of 102.6 +/- 6.6 and 181.0 +/- 18.0 hours in single and twin pregnancies, respectively. Adrenal/body weight ratios increased similarly in adrenocorticotropic hormone-treated single and twin fetuses at delivery, and basal cortisol levels were two- to threefold higher prepartum in adrenocorticotropic hormone-treated fetuses. Little change in plasma cortisol levels occurred in singletons treated with saline solution or in twins not infused with adrenocorticotropic hormone. The lung weight/body weight was not altered in any group. Lung distensibility and stability were doubled to term values in fetuses treated with pulsatile adrenocorticotropic hormone compared with controls and untreated twins. Mean lavage phosphatidylcholine levels rose from 0.07 to 0.11 mg/gm in saline solution-treated or untreated fetuses to 0.20 to 0.23 mg/gm in pulsatile adrenocorticotropic hormone-treated singletons or twins, compared with 0.63 mg/gm at term. Phosphatidylcholine production increased from 0.51 dpm/gm/hr in saline solution-treated fetuses to 0.73 and 0.89 dpm/gm/hr in the single and twin pulsatile adrenocorticotropic hormone-infused fetuses, respectively; phosphatidylcholine production was 0.62 dpm/gm/hr in the noninfused twin. Lungs of twins treated with pulsatile adrenocorticotropic hormone were morphologically more mature than those of untreated twins. We conclude that fetal endocrine responses to exogenous adrenocorticotropic hormone, rather than the stimuli associated with labor per se, are responsible for lung maturation in the fetal sheep.\r"

In the current study we sought to evaluate the fetoplacental unit in pregnancies complicated by maternal syphilis (n = 37), with and without fetal infection. Maternal 17 beta-estradiol and estriol levels were reduced during the third trimester in women with syphilis when compared with those in women with uncomplicated pregnancies. Serum progesterone levels were within normal limits or else were increased in women with syphilis. When compared with data in age- and weight-matched control infants of women having no pregnancy complications, umbilical cord serum levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, the major fetal adrenal precursor of placental estrogens, were subnormal (897 +/- 597 ng/ml, mean +/- SD) in 12 newborn infants with congenital syphilis (33.9 +/- 4.2 weeks' gestation, birth weight 2020 +/- 719 gm); such infants also had excessive serum levels of cholesterol (103 +/- 37 mg/dl). Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (1883 +/- 907 ng/ml) and cholesterol (58.1 +/- 13.9 mg/dl) levels were within normal limits in 19 uninfected infants of women with syphilis (38.6 +/- 2.4 weeks' gestation, birth weight 2861 +/- 660 gm). Cortisol levels were increased and estriol levels were decreased in both groups of neonates of women with syphilis compared with those in control neonates. These findings are suggestive that estrogen production often is reduced in pregnancies complicated by syphilis; the reduction in estriol appears to be largely due to reduced fetal adrenal dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate production. The reduction in 17 beta-estradiol levels may be due to alterations in maternal precursor synthesis. Although placental progesterone formation appears to be normal in women with syphilis, a deficiency in placental aromatase activity also is possible.\r"

Tissue viability was demonstrated by oxygen consumption and by carbon dioxide and lactate production. Vasoconstrictive effects of leukotrienes B4, C4, and D4 were compared with those of a known potent vasoconstrictor, thromboxane mimic (U 46619). The leukotrienes and thromboxane mimic were administered as bolus injections into a chorionic plate artery in doses ranging from 10(-6) to 25 micrograms. In each placenta only one leukotriene was compared with thromboxane mimic. Vasoconstrictive effects were determined by maximum increases in resistance occurring after each injection. Thromboxane mimic caused significantly greater increases in resistance than any of the leukotrienes (p less than 0.001). Thromboxane mimic and leukotriene D4 had significantly lower threshold doses than leukotriene B4 or C4 (p less than 0.001). We concluded: (1) Thromboxane mimic is a potent vasoconstrictor in the human placental vasculature; (2) leukotrienes also cause vasoconstriction but are much less potent than thromboxane; (3) thromboxane mimic and leukotriene D4 have vasoconstrictor effects at significantly lower (p less than 0.001) concentrations than leukotriene B4 or C4.\r"

Epidermal growth factor, tumor growth factor-alpha, tumor growth factor-beta, human interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13 didecanoate, and dexamethasone were tested for their ability to modulate prostaglandin production in WISH cells. Quantitatively, the major prostaglandin produced in WISH cells was prostaglandin E2. Treatment with epidermal growth factor, tumor growth factor-alpha, tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate resulted in a concentration-dependent stimulation of WISH cell prostaglandin E2 production; tumor growth factor-beta and the inactive phorbol ester analog 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13 didecanoate had no effect. Dexamethasone treatment resulted in concentration-dependent inhibition of prostaglandin E2 production by WISH cells. WISH cells responded in a qualitatively similar manner to that previously observed in primary cultures of human amnion with the exception of the response to dexamethasone. On the basis of the findings of this investigation, we suggest that WISH cells may be a useful model for studying some but not all aspects of the regulation of arachidonic acid release and prostaglandin E2 formation in amnion. WISH cells may also be used to evaluate the mechanisms that link regulation of immune function and arachidonic acid metabolism.\r"

We investigated the effect of one reactive oxygen product, hydrogen peroxide, on in vitro activity of uterine segments from the 18-day-pregnant rat. H2O2 (0.3 mmol/L) was found to elicit rhythmic contractions and increase prostaglandins F2 alpha and E2 release by uterine tissue. Indomethacin blocked both of these effects. We conclude that H2O2 stimulates uterine contractions through a prostaglandin release mechanism. A speculative hypothesis of peripartum regulation of prostaglandin production by reactive oxygen is discussed.\r"

Because both relaxin and progesterone have been demonstrated to affect myometrial cyclic adenosine monophosphate activity, we questioned whether the previously observed synergism of these two hormones in inhibiting uterine contractility is mediated via cyclic adenosine monophosphate. Immature rats were treated with estradiol benzoate (n = 7) or a combination of estradiol benzoate and progesterone (n = 7). Uterine horns were isolated, each horn was divided into two segments, and these horn segments were incubated in Ringer-Locke solution, either alone (control) or with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (MIX) 0.5 mM, MIX 0.5 mM + relaxin 10 ng/ml, or MIX 0.5 mM + relaxin 50 ng/ml. When compared with uterine segments incubated in MIX alone, treatment with MIX + relaxin 50 ng/ml significantly increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels in animals treated with estradiol benzoate alone or in combination with progesterone. Relaxin 10 ng/ml was sufficient to significantly elevate mean (+/- SEM) uterine cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels above that of control MIX-treated uteri in animals receiving both estradiol benzoate and progesterone (2.49 +/- 0.39 pm/micrograms deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] versus 1.08 +/- 0.16 pm/microgram DNA, p less than 0.05) but not in animals receiving estradiol benzoate alone (2.08 +/- 0.32 pm/micrograms DNA versus 1.28 +/- 0.16 pm/micrograms DNA, NS). Compared with treatment with MIX only, MIX + relaxin 10 ng/ml and MIX + relaxin 50 ng/ml produced greater increases in uterine cyclic adenosine monophosphate in the steroid combination group than in the estradiol benzoate controls (144.8% and 233.7% versus 71.7% and 156.6%, respectively). These results suggest that the synergism of relaxin and progesterone in inhibiting uterine contractility may be mediated by intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate.\r"

The fetal gastrointestinal tract is believed to resorb 500 to 1000 ml of amniotic fluid per day during 7 to 10 bouts of swallowing activity. However, the impact of ruminal fluid on fetal plasma composition and fluid homeostasis is largely unknown. Seven ovine fetuses (120 +/- 1 day) received intraruminal infusions of 0.9% or 3% saline solution on alternate days. In response to successive 40-minute intraruminal infusions of 0.9% saline solution (0.5 and 1.0 ml/kg/min), there was no change from basal levels of fetal plasma osmolality (295.7 +/- 2.9 mosm), plasma arginine vasopressin (1.45 +/- 0.29 pg/ml), urine osmolality (150 +/- 8 mosm), or urine volume (0.49 +/- 0.10 ml/min). In response to the 3% saline solution infusion, significant increases were noted in fetal plasma osmolality (295.4 +/- 3.1 to 302.6 +/- 2.6 mosm), plasma arginine vasopressin (1.77 +/- 0.31 to 4.84 +/- 0.79 pg/ml), and urine osmolality (157 +/- 13 to 342 +/- 25 mosm), whereas fetal urine volume significantly decreased (0.35 +/- 0.05 to 0.15 +/- 0.06 ml/min). These results indicate that hypertonic, but not isotonic, saline solution infusion into the fetal gastrointestinal tract may affect fetal plasma composition and urine production. Under conditions of significant plasma to luminal osmotic gradients, fetal gastrointestinal water and electrolyte transfer may be more rapid than can be compensated by either fetal renal function or placental equilibration.\r"

This amniotic volume expansion persisted during a 36-hour recovery period. During the infusion, fetal urine flow increased by 600 ml/day and was accompanied by a significant rise in renal electrolyte excretion. Fetal swallowing of amniotic fluid rose in parallel by 600 ml/day and fetal blood volume significantly increased by 5%. Maternal parameters were not changed during the experimental or recovery periods. Thus the present data suggest that direct intraamniotic infusion on a long-term basis in pregnant sheep appears to be an effective method for increasing fetal hydration and amniotic fluid volume.\r"

Uterine blood flow was mechanically restricted with a polytetrafluoroethylene vascular clamp placed around the maternal common internal iliac artery such that mean (+/- SEM) fetal arterial oxygen tension decreased from 23.4 +/- 1.9 to 17.3 +/- 0.8 mm Hg at 1 hour of hypoxemia and remained low for 48 hours. There was an initial increase in fetal arterial carbon dioxide pressure from 48.5 +/- 0.9 mm Hg during the control period to 56.2 +/- 2.3 mm Hg at 1 hour; this parameter subsequently returned to control values, whereas base excess showed a transient decrease. Fetal cerebral, myocardial, and adrenal blood flows were significantly increased at 1, 24, and 48 hours of hypoxemia. In contrast, there was no change in nuchal muscle or renal blood flows with hypoxemia of this magnitude. Cotyledonary blood flow increased transiently by 38% at 1 hour of hypoxemia, but was not changed from control at 24 and 48 hours.

Suppression of normal fetal electrocortical activity occurred at a low ethanol concentration and returned to control values at a time of very high arterial ethanol concentrations. This experimental model of a binge drinking episode further supports the hypothesis that ethanol suppresses fetal breathing movements by a direct central mechanism rather than indirectly by alteration of electrocortical activity.\r"

Placental hemodynamics were assessed in nine chronically prepared ewes 1 hour after exposure to smoke from either a marijuana (n = 5) or a placebo (n = 4) cigarette. When compared with placebo smoke, maternal marijuana smoke exposure resulted in a fall in both uterine and umbilical placental vascular resistance and a 30% improvement in placental perfusion balance at a cotyledonary level. We conclude that maternal marijuana smoking in late ovine pregnancy has a direct relaxant effect on both maternal and fetal placental vascular smooth muscles that decreases the normal heterogeneity of flow and improves macroscopic placental perfusion balance. However, the observed concurrent 6 torr decrease in fetal oxygen tension suggests that perfusion balance is actually disrupted at a microcirculatory level.\r"

With the maternal and fetal perfusates not recirculated, the transfer index (ratio of clearance of thiamine to that of L-glucose) toward the fetus was 2.09 +/- 0.36, suggesting a mediated transport system. In the reverse direction, the transfer rate approximates that expected from simple diffusion (transfer index 0.78 +/- 0.25). Stepwise increases in thiamine concentration in the maternal perfusate were associated with parallel increases in transfer rates up to 500 nmol/L. Above that concentration, the rate of increase declined and the transfer index fell. When the maternal perfusate was recirculated and the fetal circulation was kept open, the thiamine concentration rapidly decreased, reaching a plateau in 30 to 40 minutes at a level about 0.1 to 0.2 of the fetal perfusate. In contrast, the concentration within the placenta greatly exceeded those in the perfusates. The observations indicate an effective transport system directed toward the fetus, saturable at low concentrations and capable of establishing a transplacental gradient. Measurement of thiamine concentrations in 20 paired samples of plasma obtained at term demonstrated a mean (+/- SD) cord:maternal ratio of 2.5 +/- 1.4. Differential protein binding was excluded as a cause of the gradient. The in vivo gradient is probably attributable to placental transport.\r"

The normal fall in blood pressure during pregnancy was prevented by reducing litter size to two conceptuses on day 7 of gestation. Nifedipine (200 micrograms/kg) effectively lowered mean arterial pressure 25% by decreasing total peripheral resistance 38%. Cardiac output was increased 15%. Blood flows to the splanchnic region and the reproductive organs were increased after nifedipine administration. The increase in blood flow to the reproductive organs was the result of increased ovarian and uterine wall perfusion caused by large reductions in vascular resistances. Placental blood flow was not significantly altered, but resistance was decreased. Thus, the use of nifedipine to lower maternal blood pressure in pregnancy complicated by extreme hypertension does not necessarily decrease uteroplacental perfusion.\r"

Endothelial cell injury can lead to the secretion of potent mitogens by activating platelets and directly through the increased production of peptide growth factors by endothelial cells themselves. This study was undertaken to test the hypotheses that increased secretion of mitogenic factors is a feature of preeclampsia and that this activity could be detected in the serum of preeclamptic women. Paired serum samples were collected in early labor and again at 24 to 48 hours post partum from term patients with preeclampsia (n = 15) and normal pregnant controls (n = 14). A bioassay was used to quantify mitogenic activity in these paired samples by assessing their ability to stimulate the incorporation of tritiated thymidine into deoxyribonucleic acid of confluent, quiescent (GO stage) human fibroblasts in monolayer culture. Mitogenic activity was significantly increased in prepartum, preeclamptic sera compared with normal controls and diminished rapidly postpartum to levels equivalent to normal pre- and postpartum serum. These findings are consistent with endothelial cell injury, a process that we believe plays a central role in the pathophysiology of the preeclamptic syndrome.\r"

The postprandial respiratory exchange ratio also increased, from 0.78 to 0.83; the whole blood glucose level was unchanged at rest, although there was a 15% decrease in whole blood lactate levels.

In the present study, we evaluated whether these ritodrine-induced effects could be altered by dexamethasone. Ten pregnant sheep at gestational ages of 92 to 130 days received ritodrine 2 micrograms/kg/min for 24 hours. Five animals also received dexamethasone 10 mg intravascularly twice during the ritodrine infusion. Before and at 4 and 24 hours of ritodrine infusion, the animals were given an identical dose of oxytocin as a bolus, and the area under the uterine pressure-time curve was quantified. Myometrial biopsy specimens were obtained before and after ritodrine infusion. Dexamethasone treatment prevented ritodrine-induced reductions in beta-adrenergic receptor density and isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. Despite these receptor-associated effects, dexamethasone did not prevent the loss of tocolytic efficacy associated with prolonged ritodrine infusion.\r"

Each animal was subjected to hemorrhage (20 ml/kg over 60 minutes) during infusion of ritodrine (0.004 mg/kg/min), magnesium sulfate (4 gm/hour), or saline solution control. Infusion of magnesium sulfate increased the mean (+/- SEM) maternal serum magnesium concentration to 4.8 +/- 0.2 mg/dl before hemorrhage and 5.3 +/- 0.3 mg/dl after hemorrhage. At the end of hemorrhage maternal mean arterial pressures were 63% +/- 4%, 82% +/- 2%, and 79% +/- 6% of baseline in the magnesium sulfate, ritodrine, and control groups, respectively. The maternal mean arterial pressure response in the magnesium sulfate group differed significantly from the maternal mean arterial pressure responses in the ritodrine and control groups (p less than 0.01). Fetal pH was decreased significantly only in the magnesium sulfate group (p = 0.0001). Fetal PO2 was decreased significantly in the magnesium sulfate and ritodrine groups (p less than 0.001) but not in the control group. We conclude that magnesium sulfate but not ritodrine, worsened the maternal hypotensive response to hemorrhage in gravid ewes.\r"

  ".W": "In this prospective study 246 women with gestational diabetes were followed up to determine the characteristics of metabolic control associated with large-for-gestational-age infants. Memory-based reflectance meters were used for self-monitoring blood glucose. Ambulatory glucose profiles were produced to characterize glycemic control levels throughout pregnancy. With these novel approaches to the collection and representation of glucose data, the severity of glucose intolerance (hyperglycemia) was found to be associated with both maternal and neonatal morbidity in terms of infant size and cesarean section rate. By use of hierarchical cluster analysis to identify three groups on the basis of control levels (low less than 87 mg/dl, mid 87 to 105 mg/dl, high greater than 105 mg/dl) we were able to show a positive outcome in the low group with reduced rates of large-for-gestational-age (2%) and macrosomatic (0%) infants. Furthermore, we showed that as mean blood glucose levels and instability in glycemic control increased from group to group, incidence of large-for-gestational-age and macrosomatic infants increased. Whereas obesity increased the relative risk of adverse neonatal outcome, type of treatment (insulin versus diet) did not appear to be significant. Appropriately monitored toward stability within a narrow range to achieve tight metabolic control, ambulatory glycemia in pregnancy is associated with a decreased risk of maternal and fetal complications.\r"

This report reviews our experience with maternal phenobarbital therapy and fetal bilirubin conjugation in the very premature fetus. Mothers with arrested premature labor between 26 and 33 weeks' gestation were randomly assigned to receive oral phenobarbital (90 mg daily) or not. Infants in the two groups were similar in race, birth weight, and gestational age. Conjugated bilirubin levels at birth were significantly higher for infants receiving several days of phenobarbital in utero than no therapy (0.31 +/- 0.03 vs 0.16 +/- 0.01 mg dl, p less than 0.01). A smaller portion of infants exposed to phenobarbital in utero required phototherapy (10/23, 43% vs 24/29, 83%, p less than 0.01), which was also more likely to be delayed beyond 48 hours after delivery. Antenatal phenobarbital enhances bilirubin conjugation before delivery of a very low birth weight infant.\r"

In addition, the change in hematocrit after transfusion may be used to estimate the circulatory fetoplacental blood volume. In this study we present the estimates of fetoplacental blood volume calculated at the time of intravascular fetal transfusions. Between March 1986 and March 1988, 60 intravascular fetal transfusions were performed in 20 patients. The 56 procedures in which fetal hematocrits were obtained both before and after transfusion were analyzed. The mean fetoplacental blood volume before transfusion was 94.0 ml/kg. Furthermore, the fetoplacental blood volume per kilogram fetal weight decreased with advancing gestation. These estimates of fetoplacental blood volume and changes relative to gestational age may be useful in the treatment of the severely isoimmunized fetus. Reliance on the more recently generated fetoplacental blood volumes may allow more accurate predictions of transfusion volumes and estimation of the hematocrit after transfusion.\r"

The activity of this enzyme has been noted to be decreased in affective disorder, alcoholism, and psychiatric vulnerability. Platelet monoamine oxidase B activity, estradiol, and progesterone were assessed throughout one menstrual cycle in 13 women with premenstrual syndrome and 19 control subjects. No significant differences were noted between groups using these parameters.

An estradiol preparation was chosen to allow comparison with physiologic events. Estradiol benzoate, 1 mg intramuscularly, was administered for 7 days to achieve estradiol concentrations just above preovulatory levels (424 +/- 54 pg/ml); 24-hour mean prolactin concentrations increased threefold (14.0 +/- 2.1 to 40.6 +/- 7.1 ng/ml). Prolactin pulse frequency increased significantly (p less than 0.001) during waking hours after estradiol benzoate administration. The diurnal pattern of prolactin secretion was maintained with estradiol benzoate, although the sleep acrophase often reached high concentrations (86 +/- 11 ng/ml). These results suggest in women with regular menstrual cycles: (1) that estrogen administration that achieves slightly greater than preovulatory estradiol concentrations can stimulate prolactin release, (2) that estradiol may elevate prolactin by increasing its pulsatile secretion, (3) that estradiol does not alter the diurnal pattern of prolactin secretion, (4) that estradiol concentrations just above preovulatory levels can be associated with markedly elevated prolactin concentrations.\r"

To test the hypothesis that Leydig and granulosa cells may contain a distinct 17-ketosteroid reductase enzyme, the subcellular localization and the substrate specificity of the enzyme was examined in each cell type. In Leydig cells, the 17-ketosteroid reductase activity was concentrated in the microsomal fraction of the cell. In granulosa cells, the 17-ketosteroid reductase activity was concentrated in the cytosolic fraction of the cell. In Leydig cell microsomes, the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant for the conversion of androstenedione to testosterone was 0.41 mumol/L and for the conversion of estrone to estradiol it was 12 mumol/L. In granulosa cell cytosol, the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant for the conversion of estrone to estradiol was 1.1 mumol/L and for the conversion of androstenedione to testosterone it was 15 mumol/L. These results demonstrate that rat Leydig and granulosa cells each contain a 17-ketosteroid reductase enzyme with unique subcellular localization and substrate specificity.\r"

Medium containing serum was removed after 24 hours, defined medium was added, and the gel was floated. Medium was changed daily for 3 days, after which the granulosa cells were prepared for light and electron microscopy. Cells grown on collagen secreted significantly more estradiol and progesterone than those grown on plastic during the 3 days of culture. The round multilayered granulosa cells on collagen had abundant mitochondria and lipid droplets and they formed numerous intercellular junctions. On plastic surfaces, flat granulosa cells grew as a monolayer with few junctions and less abundant mitochondria or lipid droplets. We conclude that growth on floating collagen promotes structural changes of human granulosa cells that enhances cell interaction and secretion of steroid hormones.\r"

The aim of this study was to determine if the administration of platelet activating factor to rabbits would stimulate the production of early pregnancy factor and, if so, to ascertain the organs responsible. Early pregnancy factor was assayed after the administration of synthetic platelet activating factor to intact rabbits, rabbits that had undergone bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and isolated in vitro perfused rabbit ovary and/or oviduct. Although serum early pregnancy factor activity was detectable 30 minutes after platelet activating factor injection in intact rabbits, no activity was found in rabbits whose ovaries and oviducts had been removed. Perfusate early pregnancy factor activity was detectable only in the presence of both ovary and oviduct, and was first evident 120 minutes after platelet activating factor exposure. However, combined samples of perfusates from the ovary alone and oviduct alone expressed positive early pregnancy factor activity. Furthermore, the addition of platelet activating factor to either single or combined perfusates did not increase early pregnancy factor activity. Our data imply that platelet activating factor induces the production of ovary and oviduct early pregnancy factor components independently.\r"

After gonadotropin treatment, CD-1 mice received the following experimental agents: group 1, an oil vehicle; group 2, 1 mg progesterone; group 3, 1 mg antiprogesterone (RU 486); group 4, 1 mg RU 486 and 1 mg dexamethasone. Each group of animals was injected simultaneously for 2 days (concomitant with human chorionic gonadotropin and the day after coitus). Ova or embryos were obtained on day 1, 2, 3, or 4 after human chorionic gonadotropin by flushing uteri and tubes. No differences were apparent in number of oocytes ovulated, ovum maturation, or number of oocytes progressing to two-cell embryos. However, on day 3 a marked reduction in embryos retrieved from the oviduct and uterus was apparent in the RU 486-treated groups (group 1, 84; group 3.0; group 4, 17) (p less than 0.001). In addition, few cleavage stage embryos were recovered on day 4 in the RU 486-treated groups (group 1, 74; group 2, 70; group 3, 2; group 4, 0) (p less than 0.0001). Freshly ovulated cumulus masses were recovered from the oviducts on day 4 in groups 3 and 4 (coincident with resumption of the estrous cycle). In conclusion, periovulatory RU 486 injections had no effect on nuclear maturation, ovulation, fertilization, or first cleavage division. Progesterone may not have an obligatory role in these processes. However, RU 486 administration did result in a reduced number of embryos retrieved on days 3 and 4 because of either early expulsion or destruction of the embryos.\r"

Ham's F-10 medium (280 mosm/kg, pH 7.4) alone, by means of reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, demonstrated one major hydrophilic peak, which eluted at 4 to 8 minutes in a 10% to 48% acetonitrile gradient. This peak showed a single peptide of 50 kilodaltons in one-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and size exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography. After the growth of two-cell murine embryos to eight-cell embryos or blastocysts, the major hydrophilic peak was greatly reduced or absent in the culture medium, and in turn a major hydrophobic peak appeared that eluted at 29 minutes. The major hydrophobic peak could not be focused in one-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, but a high content of polar and nonpolar amino acids was revealed in N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometric analysis. This shift in the peaks was not detected when embryos were cultured in the presence of 0.02% sodium azide. In vitro culture of human zygotes from the pronuclear stage to two to eight cells caused a similar disappearance of the major hydrophilic peak concomitant with the appearance of one to three major hydrophobic peaks in the culture medium. We conclude that the change in profile of culture medium from hydrophilic to hydrophobic peaks on high-performance liquid chromatography is indicative of the metabolic pattern of murine and human embryos. These data also indicate that murine and human embryos do not secrete any major peptide during their development in vitro.\r"

All samples of the 3 species were polymorphic for the major chromosomal inversions previously recorded in field specimens from eastern and southern Africa, indicating that the collections reflected natural levels of intraspecific variation in the field populations sampled. Approximately 97% of the cytologically identified mosquitoes were also identified to species by the DNA probe method, and in every case the DNA probe and cytogenetic methods of species identification produced concordant results.\r"

A characterization of toxoplasma strains by biochemical techniques has not been reported. In this study, extracts of tachyzoites of 7 toxoplasma strains were compared on the basis of their isoenzyme patterns for 39 enzymes by means of isoelectrofocusing in polyacrylamide gels. Eighteen enzymes gave clear and reproducible bands. Of these, 14 had identical electrophoretic patterns for all strains. Two different isoenzyme types were found for the enzymes aspartate aminotransferase, glutathione reductase, glucose phosphate isomerase, and amylase. This allowed the description of 3 isoenzyme pattern groups among the 7 toxoplasma strains. The possible relationship between biological behavior and isoenzyme pattern groups is discussed.\r"

Filariae encountered in S. metallicum were primarily of a Dipetalonema-like species, but third-stage larvae indistinguishable from O. volvulus were found in 4 flies of this species. Our findings suggest that O. volvulus may occasionally be transmitted by S. metallicum, but such transmission is likely limited to areas having both a high parasite prevalence maintained by S. ochraceum and a relatively high host-seeking density of S. metallicum. Two third-stage larvae that could not be differentiated from O. volvulus were found once in S. gonzalezi; however, transmission by this species appears to be inconsequential.\r"

The percentages of residents with skin biopsies positive for microfilariae of O. volvulus at these locations were 13.8%, 33.3%, 65.4%, and 89.6%. The following variables associated with transmission were calculated from our observations (the values are presented in an order that corresponds with the above prevalence rates): frequency of third-stage larvae (calculated on an annual basis) in parous Simulium ochraceum, 0, 0.004, 0.005, and 0.004; estimated daily biting density of S. ochraceum, 23, 24, 254, and 1,509 flies per day; and estimated annual infective biting density (based on S. ochraceum), 0, 18, 185, and 1,101 potentially infective bites per year. The frequencies of third-stage larvae are very small compared with those observed in Africa, and suggest that transmission of O. volvulus in Guatemala depends on high vector density. Locations with low, and perhaps tolerable, levels of onchocerciasis (less than 15% of female residents with skin biopsies positive for microfilariae) have mean daily biting densities for S. ochraceum of less than or equal to 24 flies, and infected residents normally have mean microfilarial densities of less than or equal to 3 microfilariae per mg of skin. Stratification of prevalence rates by age group proved useful for assessing current transmission within a village.\r"

Their prevalences were compared to those of a control group of 124 age and sex matched black HBV carriers without tumor. IgM anti-HBc was present in 68.6%, HBeAg in 32.3%, and HBV-DNA in 26.7% of the patients. In the control population, IgM anti-HBc was present in 45%, HBeAg was detected in 3.2%, and HBV-DNA in 25.8%. We conclude that IgM anti-HBc is present appreciably more often than either HBeAg or HBV-DNA in patients with PHC. HBeAg or IgM anti-HBc in serum of HBsAg positive carriers may predict an added risk of PHC development in South African blacks.\r"

The method used to prevent normal clot formation for the pledget feedings (i.e., defibrination by shaking with glass beads or addition of heparin) did not affect subsequent infection rates. Both inhibition of normal clot formation and freezing of virus after it had last been propagated were associated with significantly reduced infection rates with the pledget feedings. Laboratory studies using artificial feeding techniques may not give reliable estimates of the vector competence of mosquitoes for arboviruses.\r"

Specific gene regions, responsible for antigenic determinants presumed to play a role in protection against disease, were emphasized in these investigations. Comparative sequence data revealed that most isolates were very similar to ZH501 at both the nucleic acid and deduced amino acid sequence levels. Nucleic acid sequence variation range was 0-4.5%. Amino acid sequence variation range was 0-2.4%. We identified specific amino acid coding changes which may be involved in virus neutralization and may contribute to the virulence characteristics of RVFV.\r"

Because of inadequate laboratory facilities and financial resources the etiological agents responsible for most cases in developing countries remain unknown, thus obviating appropriate management. Therefore, an ARI program was commenced at the Kenyatta National Hospital, Nairobi, Kenya in 1981 with the objectives of establishing the microbial causes, clinical presentations, and diagnoses of ARI in children under 5 years of age and of developing simple, rapid, and inexpensive diagnostic techniques. Viruses were demonstrated in 54% of the 822 children studied, but over half of the viruses identified were types not commonly associated elsewhere with the causation of severe ARI. Respiratory syncytial, parainfluenza, and adenoviruses occurred in the same age groups and during similar weather conditions as elsewhere. Measles virus occurred most frequently in those 7 to 9 months old. Herpes simplex, rhino-, and enteroviruses play causative roles in some cases of severe ARI in Kenyan children. A combination of immunofluorescent and cell culture techniques were shown to be essential for the detection of viruses.\r"

  ".W": "We have been most fortunate to witness advances in techniques related to the field of allergy. The development and implementation of RAST, RAST inhibition, crossed immunoelectrophoresis, and CRIE have allowed us to determine what food moieties have the potential to be allergenic. Furthermore, using the above techniques, it has become possible to delineate whether allergenic moieties in particular food stuffs share their allergenic determinants with other food materials. Despite these advances, it is difficult to make definite statements concerning clinically significant cross-reactivity among nuts, legumes, and crustacea. There is still, obviously, a role for the use of open and double-blind food challenges, as demonstrated by the peanut oil, soybean oil, and sunflower oil studies. Although food challenges, in situations where anaphylaxis is a possibility, should only be done under controlled circumstances and under the guidance of a well-defined protocol, this technique should remain available to further study cross-reactivity among foods. At the present time, the following conclusions concerning cross-reactivity among foods may be entertained. (1) Cross-reactivity among foods from different food groups is extremely rare. (2) Individuals having IgE-mediated reactions to legume proteins, for example peanut and soybean, do not respond to the corresponding oil derived from those substances. (3) Cross-reactivity among legumes may occur, but in vitro studies defining common allergenic determinants among these food substances cannot be automatically interpreted as reflecting in vivo cross-reactivity. Furthermore, very limited attempts at open and double-blind challenges in specific patients have not confirmed cross-reactivity in peanut-sensitive individuals to other legumes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It is recommended that a culture for anaerobes be obtained from any patient who uses contact lenses and develops conjunctivitis.\r"

A common clinical dictum suggests that third nerve palsies are associated with pupillary sparing in this systemic arteritis. We present a biopsy-proven case of TA with parasympathetic pupillary involvement and ophthalmoparesis. Relative light-near dissociation and differential clinical response to adrenocorticosteroids occurred. Previous pathologic studies have suggested that clinically apparent parasympathetic pupillary dysfunction could follow arteritic lesions at several neuroanatomic sites and may, therefore, reflect different pathogenetic mechanisms and display distinctive clinical features. Our case effectively broadens the clinicopathologic locus of neuro-ophthalmologic expression in TA.\r"

A manyfold increase in omega 3 site density was observed in all these disease states; this increase reflects macrophage invasion or glial proliferation or both as demonstrated by neuropathological studies carried out in parallel. There was an excellent spatial correlation between increased omega 3 site densities and extent of the lesion histologically. Specifically, an elevated density of omega 3 sites was observed in the plaques of demyelination in multiple sclerosis patients, in the periphery of infarcted zones in stroke patients, and throughout tumor in patients with grade IV astrocytomas. As our approach is applicable to both tomographic (in vivo) and autoradiographic investigations, imaging of omega 3 sites may be considered for the detection and monitoring of the natural evolution of many disorders of the human central nervous system.\r"

Sural nerve specimens were taken from 25 patients (mean age 44 years) and evaluated by routine procedures used in our laboratory. In 13 cases no detectable abnormality was seen. Twelve patients (48%) showed loss of myelinated fibers with disproportionately greater loss of large myelinated fibers. Three of these patients showed severe myelinated fiber loss; 2 had no documented symptoms and no other known predisposing factors for a peripheral neuropathy. Changes suggestive of wallerian degeneration were occasionally seen, as were epineurial and endoneurial inflammatory infiltrates. Segmental demyelination was not identified in any nerve examined. Electron microscopy revealed thickened basement membranes around small blood vessels, Schwann cells, and fibroblasts. Peripheral nerve abnormalities in patients with AIDS or ARC are frequent and their pathogenesis remains unclear.\r"

During the phase of dense hemiplegia, local cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (1CMRG1c) is decreased significantly in most of the thalamic nuclei ipsilateral to the ablation, and there are slight contralateral decreases. The lCMRGlc is reduced bilaterally in most of the brainstem nuclei and bilaterally in the deep cerebellar nuclei, but only in the contralateral cerebellar cortex. During the phase of partial motor recovery, lCMRGlc is incompletely restored in many of the thalamic nuclei ipsilateral to the ablation and completely restored in the contralateral nuclei. In the brainstem and deep cerebellar nuclei, poor to moderate recovery occurs bilaterally. Moderate recovery occurs in the contralateral cerebellar cortex. The findings demonstrate that a unilateral cerebral cortical lesion strongly affects lCMRGlc in the thalamus ipsilaterally and in the cerebellar cortex contralaterally, but in the brainstem bilaterally. Partial recovery of lCMRGlc accompanies the progressive motor recovery. The structures affected include those with direct, and also those with indirect, connections to the areas ablated.\r"

An HTLV-I-like virus has recently been implicated in multiple sclerosis as well. We studied paired cerebrospinal fluid and serum specimens from HAM and multiple sclerosis patients by isoelectric focusing and an isoelectric focusing HTLV-I p24 overlay technique to clarify the role of HTLV-I in these diseases. We detected oligoclonal bands by isoelectric focusing with silver-staining in cerebrospinal fluid, but not serum, from all 5 HAM and all 9 multiple sclerosis patients. An isoelectric focusing HTLV-I p24 overlay technique demonstrated anti-p24 antibody in HAM cerebrospinal fluid at a different pI distribution than that seen in paired serum, indicating local synthesis of anti-p24 antibody within the central nervous system. Oligoclonal bands in HAM cerebrospinal fluid corresponded in pI distribution to anti-p24 antibody activity, suggesting the presence of an ongoing HTLV-I infection in the central nervous system. Multiple sclerosis patients had no evidence of anti-HTLV-I activity by p24 radioimmunoprecipitation assay, Western immunoblots, or isoelectric focusing HTLV-I p24 overlay analysis. Our data support a role for HTLV-I as an etiological agent in HAM, but not in multiple sclerosis.\r"

  ".W": "Although the ergot alkaloids (ergots) are useful drugs for the acute treatment of migraine headaches, their mechanism of action remains obscure. When administered to rats in clinically relevant doses, ergots blocked the development of neurogenic plasma extravasation in dura mater. Plasma extravasation was induced by depolarization of perivascular axons following capsaicin injection or unilateral electrical stimulation of the trigeminal nerve. The ergot action could not be accounted for by vasoconstriction alone because neurogenic plasma leakage was not blocked by angiotensin or phenylephrine. Furthermore, ergots did not block plasma extravasation induced by administering sensory neuropeptides that mediate enhanced permeability. We propose that the therapeutic effects of ergots in vascular headaches may result from peripheral blockade of small fiber (C or A-delta)-dependent neurogenic inflammation within the dura mater.\r"

The binding was saturable, with a dissociation constant less than 1 microM. Maximal binding capacity was approximately 7 pmol/mg protein in the cerebral cortex, approximately 42 pmol/mg protein in brain microvessels, and approximately 27 pmol/mg protein in the choroid plexus. Several hexoses displaced specific [3H]cytochalasin B binding to microvessels in a rank-order that correlated well with their known ability to cross the blood-brain barrier; the only exception was 2-deoxy-D-glucose, which had much higher affinity for the glucose transporter than the natural substrate, D-glucose. Irreversible photoaffinity labeling of the glucose transporter of microvessels with [3H]cytochalasin B, followed by solubilization and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, labeled a protein band with an average molecular weight of approximately 55,000. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies specific to the human erythrocyte glucose transporter immunocytochemically stained brain blood vessels and the few trapped erythrocytes in situ, with minimal staining of the neuropil. In the choroid plexus, blood vessels did not stain, but the epithelium reacted positively. We conclude that human brain microvessels are richly endowed with a glucose transport moiety similar in molecular weight and antigenic characteristics to that of human erythrocytes and brain microvessels of other mammalian species.\r"

Data were gathered from first-degree relatives who had lived with the subjects for the previous 5 years or more. Forty-seven percent of the DAT patients incurred at least one crash while they were driving, whereas only 10% of the control subjects had had a crash in the previous 5 years. The odds ratio for crashes in the DAT group was 7.9 (p less than 0.01). Moreover, in 77% of DAT patients, a deterioration in driving performance was noted, and 63% of the patients had stopped driving. However, only 42% of the DAT patients who stopped driving did so before a crash occurred. Mean illness duration was 4.0 (+/- 1.8) years, and the mean Mini-Mental Status Examination score was 19.9 (+/- 6.3) at the time of the first crash in the DAT group. The occurrence of crashes was not significantly correlated with dementia severity or with disease duration. These data suggest that the occurrence of driving crashes in patients with DAT is an important public health problem.\r"

Seven of the patients had normal renal function and seven were in acute renal failure. In both groups plasma concentrations of atracurium reached a plateau of approximately 1300 ng ml-1 within 30 min of the bolus dose. The drug disappeared from the plasma within 120 min after discontinuation of the infusion. There was no difference between the two groups with respect to the pharmacokinetic parameters derived for atracurium. In the patients with normal renal function, plasma laudanosine concentration reached a plateau of approximately 1200 ng ml-1 within 10 h. In patients with renal failure there was a greater variation in the plasma laudanosine concentration: the highest value recorded was 4300 ng ml-1. Patients with renal failure had a significantly longer mean elimination half-life for laudanosine (1418 min v. 375 min; P less than 0.05) and Vd (4.52 litre kg-1 v. 2.40 litre kg-1; P less than 0.01) than the patients with normal renal function.\r"

  ".W": "Mivacurium chloride (BW B1090U) is a new, short-acting non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent. It is a synthetic bis-benzylisoquinolinium diester, which is hydrolysed rapidly by plasma cholinesterase. This study compares mivacurium, atracurium and vecuronium by continuous i.v. infusion. The duration of mivacurium infusion ranged from 29.5 to 286 min. The steady state infusion rates necessary to maintain 95 (SEM 4)% twitch suppression were: mivacurium 8.3 (0.7) micrograms kg-1 min-1; atracurium 7.9 (0.4) micrograms kg-1 min-1; vecuronium 1.2 (0.3) micrograms kg-1 min-1. Following infusions of mivacurium, various recovery times (for example: 25-75%, 6.9 (0.3) min; 25-95%, 11.0 (0.4) min; 5-95% 14.5 (0.4) min) did not differ significantly from those following single bolus doses. Recovery times following cessation of mivacarium infusions were approximately 50% of those for equivalent durations of infusion of atracurium (10.9 (0.3) min for 25-75% recovery and 26.6 (0.4) min for 5-95% recovery). For vecuronium, corresponding recovery times were 13.8 (0.9) and 32.0 (1.2) min, respectively. Comparative recovery times for mivacurium were 40-50% of those for vecuronium. There was a significant correlation between the infusion rate of mivacurium required to maintain 95% twitch depression and the plasma cholinesterase activity of individual subjects.\r"

During recovery, the first post-tetanic response always preceded the first train-of-four response. The interval between the appearance of the first post-tetanic response and the first train-of-four response was typically 5-10 min for the intermediate-acting agents vecuronium and atracurium, and 20-30 min for the long-acting agents pancuronium, alcuronium and tubocurarine. A post-tetanic count of 6 with alcuronium and tubocurarine, or 7 with vecuronium, atracurium and pancuronium indicated that recovery of the first train-of-four response was imminent.\r"

Each child received a loading dose of vecuronium 80 micrograms kg-1 followed immediately by an infusion set initially at 1.4 micrograms kg-1 min-1. The subsequent intense neuromuscular blockade was assessed using the post-tetanic count (PTC). Maintaining the PTC between 5 and 15 ensured adequate paralysis which was antagonized easily 6-18 min after stopping the infusion. However, the duration of the initial intense block was unpredictable and the use of a peripheral nerve stimulator is advisable, particularly in smaller infants (less than 5 kg). The results suggest that vecuronium accumulated after 3 h infusion and that has less presynaptic effect than atracurium.\r"

The time for A'/A and the train-of-four ratio (D'/A') to reach 70% was recorded. It was found that, after both atracurium and vecuronium, neostigmine 1.25 mg considerably accelerated recovery and, when compared with previous results, differed little from neostigmine 5.0 mg or 2.5 mg. Neostigmine 0.625 mg also significantly accelerated recovery after atracurium and was comparable to neostigmine 1.25 mg. However, with neostigmine 0.625 mg after vecuronium, recovery of D'/A' (but not A'/A) was little faster than spontaneous. Neostigmine 1.25 mg appears to be almost as effective as neostigmine 5.0 mg or 2.5 mg in antagonizing considerable block (90% depression of twitch height) produced by either atracurium or vecuronium, but neostigmine 0.625 mg is not sufficient, especially after vecuronium.\r"

The relative bioavailability of morphine with MST was significantly less than that with MSS (mean 80%, range 50-110%) although there was no difference between the formulations in the relative availability of M3G and M6G. There was no significant difference between the formulations in the serum concentration of morphine at 12 h. The mean ratios morphine: M6G:M3G (comparing areas under the serum concentration-time curves) were 1:9:56. There was a highly significant linear relationship between the dose administered and AUC for morphine, M3G and M6G after MSS; and for morphine after MST. Median tmax for morphine was 0.5 h with MSS and 2.5 h with MST; for M3G 1.5 h with MSS and 3.0 h with MST; and for M6G 1.5 h with MSS and 3.25 h with MST. A secondary peak of unconjugated morphine, which may represent enterohepatic circulation, was seen in several patients 2-4 h after administration of elixir and 4-6 h after administration of MST.\r"

After induction of anaesthesia, blood concentrations of most of these substances decreased. After the start of surgery the concentrations of cortisol, glucose, HGH, FFA and beta-hydroxy-butyrate increased significantly in the group anaesthetized with the lower dose of fentanyl. In the group that received high-dose fentanyl anaesthesia the plasma concentrations of almost all the hormones and substances measured remained relatively low. The differences between the two groups during surgery were significant for adrenaline (P less than 0.001) and cortisol (P less than 0.001).

Increasing the concentration did not reduce the onset time further, although there was some increase in the duration of anaesthesia. Formulations A and B were hydrophilic, whereas C was an oil-in-water cream. Effective anaesthesia with formulation C required a higher drug concentration (12%), perhaps because of partitioning of the lipophilic anaesthetic into the lipid phase of the vehicle. The rate-limiting step was considered to be diffusion by the lipophilic anaesthetic through the stratum corneum, shown by onset of anaesthesia after removal of the formulation from the test site.\r"

Heart rate, arterial pressure, and the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias were not affected significantly by oxygen supplementation. Inspired oxygen concentration has a significant effect on seizure activity and should be of a consistent value if a reproducible seizure is to be produced during ECT. Breathing 100% oxygen does not appear to affect adversely the cardiovascular response to ECT. However, arterial hypoxaemia may develop rapidly during or after the seizure, regardless of oxygen supplementation, if adequate control of airway and ventilation is not maintained.\r"

In the cold environment, skin temperature increased in the distal (+2.13 degrees C, P less than 0.001) and proximal (+1.1 degrees C, P less than 0.02) front limbs and distal (+3.25 degrees C, P less than 0.001) and proximal (+1.72 degrees C, P less than 0.001) hind limbs, but decreased on the chest (-0.83 degrees C, P less than 0.01) and abdomen (-0.67 degrees C, P less than 0.002). Similar changes (all significant) were seen in the warm environment, although the effects were smaller. Rectal temperature did not change during the experiments. Arterial pressure decreased in both groups after denervation, but was the same in the denervated state regardless of ambient temperature. Our results are incompatible with increased sympathetic discharge from unblocked regions being a dominant factor in the decrease in trunk skin temperature above and within the analgesic areas, and demonstrate a substantial contribution of the sympathetic nervous system to the maintenance of the normal skin temperature gradient along the long axis of the body.\r"

The mean recovery times to spontaneous ventilation after the end of surgery ranged from 6 to 12 h. This is longer than would be expected from other studies using a similar dose of sufentanil.

  ".W": "Hypertensive patients were monitored for myocardial ischaemia during anaesthesia and surgery with the V5 lead of a standard electrocardiograph. Myocardial ischaemia was detected in 11 of 39 untreated hypertensive patients and in four of seven receiving therapy with a diuretic, but in none of 44 receiving atenolol. Fourteen of the atenolol-treated patients were receiving the drug on a long-term basis and the remaining 30 were treated acutely only on the morning of surgery. When myocardial ischaemia was observed, it was always associated with noxious stimulation and tachycardia, but a conspicuous increase in arterial pressure was not usually present. We conclude that myocardial ischaemia is prevalent during anaesthesia in untreated hypertensive patients, and that pretreatment with atenolol, but not diuretics, provides prophylaxis.\r"

The controller is based on a unique algorithm which utilizes a bi-exponential model wherein two of the variables are estimated on-line. This enables the system to optimize the sizes of subsequent bolus doses according to patient sensitivity. In this study an initial bolus of 0.3 mg kg-1 was given in a trade-off aimed at achieving earlier intubating conditions rather than taking control of relaxation ab initio and obtaining the pre-programmed setpoint of 15% single twitch response (STR) without overshoot. This was successful in all of the 11 patients studied, the mean time from injecting the bolus to intubation being 2.47 (SD 0.95) min and the drug maintenance requirement being 0.34 (0.07) mg kg-1 h-1. This provided a mean value of 10.26% STR with minimal oscillation about the setpoint (average standard deviation = 4.31 (2.53)) for up to 147 min.\r"

Plasma concentrations of these agents were measured for 6 h following administration, using a sensitive and specific capillary gas chromatographic assay. Concentration v. time data were analysed by non-linear regression and fitted to a two- or three-compartment model as appropriate. Neuromuscular blockade was assessed by measuring the mechanical evoked response of the adductor pollicis muscle to train-of-four stimulation of the ulnar nerve. Pipecuronium had a larger steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) (309 (SD 103) ml kg-1) and greater plasma clearance (Cl) (2.4 (0.6) ml kg-1 min-1) than pancuronium (199 (54) ml kg-1 and 1.5 (0.4) ml kg-1 min-1, respectively). The volumes of the central compartment, distribution and elimination half-lives and mean residence times were similar for both agents and within the range expected for drugs of this type. The durations of action (injection to 25% recovery of twitch tension) of pipecuronium and pancuronium were similar: 98.0 (36.1) min and 117.2 (35.8) min, respectively. We conclude that the time courses of neuromuscular blockade following pipecuronium and pancuronium are similar, despite the differences in Vss and Cl.\r"

There were four groups of 15 subjects: piroxicam-halothane, piroxicam-isoflurane, placebo-halothane or placebo-isoflurane. Pain increased at 2 and 4 h and had reduced by 18 h after surgery; there were no significant differences between the groups in pain scores. After operation, fewer patients in the piroxicam-isoflurane group required papaveretum compared with the piroxicam-halothane and placebo-halothane groups. Mouth opening was reduced between 2 and 4 h after surgery, but was less restricted after piroxicam-isoflurane than placebo-halothane. There was no difference between the groups in the incidence of emesis within 18 h of surgery.

Diazepam was given on the second study day at the beginning of the first phase I and paracetamol was given one IDMC later. The rate of absorption correlated with motility (P less than 0.03). Some volunteers were fast absorbers on the first study day and slow on the second, indicating that absorption rate is not constant, but dependent on gastroduodenal motility. Diazepam tended to increase the gastric emptying rate and enhanced the amplitude of contractions and the motility index during phase II (P less than 0.02). Gastric pH increased after ingestion of diazepam (P less than 0.05).\r"

After baseline studies under pentobarbitone and halothane (1.3 MAC) anaesthesia, the dogs were allocated randomly to two groups: group 1 received verapamil followed by propranolol; group 2 received propranolol followed by verapamil; the drugs were given in a continuous infusion over 10 min. The atrial-His (AH) interval, the atrioventricular node effective (AVERP), and functional (AVFRP) refractory periods, were prolonged by verapamil in both groups, but not the His-ventricle (HV) interval or the ventricular effective refractory period (VERP). AVFRP and VERP were prolonged by propranolol in both groups. Corrected sinus node recovery times were normal after each drug. Heart rate and the rate required to produce Wenckebach were decreased by each drug.

The baseline (values before infusion of local anaesthetic) mean amplitude and conduction velocity (CV) of the compound action potential (APc) were recorded and the nerve was exposed to a range of concentrations (0.5-4.0 mmol litre-1) of lignocaine for periods sufficient to attain equilibrium block. There was an increase in the amplitude of the A fibre elevation from the 1-month to the 9- and 36-month-old rabbits. The CV of the A and B fibres increased significantly with age, while the CV of the C fibres did not change. The ED50 values of lignocaine for reduction of the A fibre elevation in the 1-, 9- and 36-month-old rabbits were 0.66, 0.94 and 0.85 mmol litre-1, respectively. The respective values for the B fibres were 0.74, 1.21 and 0.82 mmol litre-1, while those of the C fibres were 1.50, 2.44 and 2.07 mmol litre-1. In general, nerves from young and old rabbits were more sensitive to local anaesthetic-induced conduction blockade, suggesting that smaller doses of local anaesthetic are required clinically for anaesthesia in paediatric and older age groups.\r"

Subsequent investigation did not support this observation. We re-examined the hypothesis in 156 consecutive patients with clinical stage I melanomas in this thickness range, who were seen at the Massachusetts General Hospital from 1977 to 1985. Patients with BANS lesions suffered recurrences at twice the rate of those with non-BANS lesions (28% compared with 13% at 5 years after excision of the primary melanoma), but this difference was not statistically significant. A meta-analysis of the effect of BANS subsite on death risk was performed using data from our investigation and five comparable published studies. The original data set which led to the BANS hypothesis was excluded from the meta-analysis in order to avoid bias. BANS location was associated with a 60% increased risk of death (P = 0.002). The difference remained statistically significant after elimination of any two of the six studies from the analysis. This confirms the influence of anatomical subsite on the prognosis of intermediate thickness melanoma.\r"

The total serum IgE level showed a significant positive correlation with the number of anti-IgE stained cells in the mucosa (P less than 0.05). No significant differences were found in the total number of toluidine blue stained cells or cells immunoreactive for histamine between patients and controls. However, AD patients who had high numbers of anti-IgE positive cells often had decreased numbers of histamine immunoreactive cells in the mucosa suggesting mast cell degranulation.

Radiographs of 120 patients were examined. Twelve per cent showed minor changes (four patients had spinal hyperostoses and 10 had calcaneal hyperostoses). None of the musculoskeletal changes we observed was clinically significant. Comparison with matched control X-rays showed 8% of the controls to have similar non-significant changes. Follow-up of 11 of the patients with abnormal X-rays showed minor deterioration in one patient, no change in four and improvement in six. Thus, doses of 0.5 mg/kg/day isotretinoin in such patients did not produce any significant long-term musculoskeletal changes.

  ".W": "The effects of zinc sulphate and azelaic acid on 5 alpha-reductase activity in human skin were studied using an in vitro assay with 1,2[3H]-testosterone as substrate. When added at concentrations of 3 or 9 mmol/l, zinc was a potent inhibitor of 5 alpha-reductase activity. At high concentrations, zinc could completely inhibit the enzyme activity. Azelaic acid was also a potent inhibitor of 5 alpha-reductase; inhibition was detectable at concentrations as low as 0.2 mmol/l and was complete at 3 mmol/l. An additive effect of the two inhibitors was observed. Vitamin B6 potentiated the inhibitory effect of zinc, but not of azelaic acid, suggesting that two different mechanisms are involved. When the three substances were added together at very low concentrations which had been shown to be ineffective alone, 90% inhibition of 5 alpha-reductase activity was obtained. If this inhibition is confirmed in vivo, zinc sulphate combined with azelaic acid could be an effective agent in the treatment of androgen related pathology of human skin.\r"

Furthermore, black skin had a significantly higher mean TEWL than white skin, corrected log TEWL 2.79 and 2.61 micrograms/cm2/h, respectively. The difference in TEWL between the groups could because measurements were made in the absence of eccrine sweating and other vital functions. The higher TEWL in black skin could be explained on the basis of a thermoregulatory mechanism. The anatomical and physiological differences in the stratum corneum between different races are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the localization of DNA replicating cells and EGF receptor-expressing cells in the epidermis of psoriasis vulgaris, a benign hyperproliferative skin disease, and Bowen's disease, a pre-malignant hyperproliferative skin disease, and normal skin. DNA replicating cells were detected by anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody after incubating tissue sections with BrdU, and EGF receptors were detected by the anti-EGF receptor monoclonal antibody B4G7. In normal skin, DNA replicating cells were localized exclusively in the basal and suprabasal layers. EGF receptor expression was observed most strongly in the basal and parabasal layers, but diminished gradually towards the upper squamous layer. In psoriatic skin, DNA replicating cells were also localized in the basal and parabasal layers, but the number of these mitotic cells was about 10 times higher than in normal skin. In this case, more EGF receptors were detected in all viable layers of the epidermis. Apparently normal skin adjacent to psoriasis lesions showed persistent expression of EGF receptors in the upper squamous layer without an increased number of DNA replicating cells in the basal and parabasal layers. In Bowen's disease, DNA replicating cells and EGF receptor expressing cells were distributed in all layers of the epidermis. These findings indicate that the increased production of EGF receptors may be, in part, responsible for the hyperproliferative state of the epidermis and that cells in the upper squamous layer of psoriasis may have lost a mechanism by which EGF receptor expression is diminished thus allowing differentiation. This altered process of EGF receptor production may be involved in the onset of psoriasis vulgaris.\r"

These results suggest a reduced incidence of acne or its more severe forms in patients who have developed lymphomas and leukemias, and provide some support for the hypothesis that increased exposure or response to P. acnes, as appears to occur with acne, could confer protection against malignant disease.\r"

Nickel uptake was found to occur according to the Freundlich adsorption isotherm, giving a slope of 0.55, indicating that nickel is associatively bound to constituents of the epidermis. The binding characteristics of cobalt were very similar to those of nickel, but the two metals were not found to compete significantly for binding sites in the epidermis. The metal-chelating agents, ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid disodium, (Na-EDTA) L-histidine and D-penicillamine were tested for ability to remove nickel from its binding sites. Na-EDTA was found to be the most efficient, removing 70-90% of the nickel bound to the tissue. The possible clinical significance of these in vitro observations are discussed in relation to percutaneous absorption and allergic contact dermatitis.\r"

The lesions were investigated with light microscopy and with in-situ DNA hybridization using 35S-labelled probes for HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31 and 33. After radical cone treatment, 11 of the 66 women (16.7%) have presented with a recurrent HPV infection. The recurrence rate increased with the duration of the follow-up period from less than 10% at the mean follow-up of 25 months to 16.7% at the most recent follow-up at 35 months. Most of these 66 HPV lesions (89%) presented with concomitant CIN in the first punch biopsy, but it is noteworthy that the other 11% presented without concomitant CIN. HPV DNA of at least one of the six types examined was found in 73% of the first biopsies and it is noteworthy that the so-called 'low-risk' types, HPV 6 and 11, were found as frequently as the 'high-risk' types, HPV 16 and 18 (18% and 17%, respectively). This would suggest a similarity in the biological behaviour of these two HPV groups. Although the concept of the 'high-risk' and 'low-risk' HPV types may remain at least partially valid, it is imperative to realize that infection by HPV 6 and 11 by no means excludes the possibility for clinical progression into CIS and eventually to an invasive carcinoma.\r"

These differences were not due to maternal age which was similar in all groups (means between 29.7 and 32.7 years). Excluding the AID group, there was a high rate of ectopic pregnancy which was significantly higher after GIFT (gamete intrafallopian transfer) and was only partly related to underlying tubal disease. Blighted ova was the main category of early pregnancy loss and was highest after AIH (artificial insemination by husband's semen). There was a higher rate of biochemical pregnancies after GIFT, PROST (pronuclear stage tubal transfer) and IVF-ET. Our findings confirm a high pregnancy wastage rate in subfertile women and highlight deficiencies in the sperm separation, gamete handling and IVF/embryo culture techniques.\r"

Decelerative records with normal FHR variation occurred in eight (1.4%) and were not associated with acidaemia or depression at birth. Forty women (6.8%) had fetuses with a reduced FHR variation. They were more likely to be in spontaneous labour, to be at an earlier gestational age, and to be delivered operatively for fetal distress of babies that were more hypoxaemic and acidaemic. However, none of the fetuses with the least variable FHR patterns required resuscitation at birth or special care. The results of the screening procedure were not fully concealed and could have influenced clinical management. This is unlikely to have caused the associations that were observed, but could have reduced an association between low FHR variation and poor outcome. We conclude that there is a basis for a randomized controlled trial of FHR screening in early labour, but that this would need to be large (more than 10,000 patients) to test the benefit of detecting the most sinister pattern (decelerations with reduced variation) of which only one example was found in this study.\r"

Meconium staining occurred in 45%, spontaneous preterm labour in 44%, and intrapartum fetal distress in 22%. Of 86 infants two were stillborn and one died soon after birth. Perinatal mortality fell from 107 in a previous series from this hospital (1965-1974) to 35/1000 in this series. Cardiotocography, estimations of oestriol, liver function tests and ultrasonic assessment of amniotic fluid volume failed to predict fetal compromise, whereas amniocentesis revealed meconium in 8 of 26 pregnancies. Early intervention was indicated in 49 pregnancies, 12 because of fetal compromise. This study suggests that intensive fetal surveillance, including amniocentesis for meconium, and induction of labour at term or with a mature lecithin/sphyngomyelin ratio, may reduce the stillbirth rate in this 'high-risk' condition.\r"

There was significantly more hydroxyproline (collagen) in the premenopausal woman than the postmenopausal woman. Similarly, there was higher percentage of water in the biopsies in the premenopausal woman than the postmenopausal woman. Further samples obtained deeper in the cervical stroma did not confirm these differences. It appears likely that differences in cervical water and cervical collagen near the surface of the cervix account, at least in part, for the lack of visibility of the squamocolumnar junction in the older woman.\r"

Practices varied considerably, some aspects of management apparently relating to the age or experience of the surgeon, some to their level of interest or surgical commitment in gynaecological urology, and some showing regional variation. Of the 960 respondents in active gynaecological practice, 84-93% (depending on the operation) drained the bladder before routine abdominal procedures, 52-54% (depending on the route) drained the bladder before incontinence surgery, and 62-70% routinely used continuous bladder drainage for periods between 1 and 12 days following these procedures. Overall, 51% of respondents preferred urethral, and 39% suprapubic catheters for postoperative bladder drainage; this showed a marked regional- and experience-related variation. Prophylactic antibiotics were used by 32% of gynaecologists overall, and a wide variety of other measures were employed in the management of catheter-associated infection, and other problems of catheter management.\r"

Fetal serum CA 125 activity was consistently less than 20 U/ml. The highest tissue levels of CA 125 were detected in first trimester decidual homogenate (median 4547 U/100 mg, range 340.4-20 851 U/100 mg) and were greater than in non-pregnant endometrium (median 388 U/100 mg, range 100.9-3341 U/100 mg) (P less than 0.01) and term decidua (median 116 U/100 mg, range 32.7-449.9 U/100 mg) (P less than 0.01). These observations suggest that CA 125 is synthesized by normal endometrium and decidua and that increased CA 125 activity during pregnancy is of decidual origin.\r"

The grading method is based on simple measurement of the area of lens opacity that obscures the red reflex relative to the area of clear red reflex, as visualised through the undilated normal pupil. Good to almost perfect agreements were attained between two ophthalmologists and two trained ophthalmic assistants for overall grades of central lens opacity. Most disagreements were trivial in nature and were concerned with difficulties in distinguishing grade 0 from grade 1, and with hazy appearance of the red reflex in high myopes and in cases of early nuclear sclerosis. Teaching materials including video tape and slides for training survey teams and other workers are in preparation.\r"

The cautious study began with small extramarginal skin excisions and progressed gradually via moderate sized juxtamarginal excisions of skin and orbicularis lamella to full-thickness margin-inclusive excisions. The wounds healed satisfactorily in all the 29 patients without ocular or palpebral complications. The functional results were normal. Cosmetic results were excellent in 27 patients and acceptable in 2, one of whom subsequently underwent a secondary oculoplastic repair. This study demonstrates that, for upper eyelids, full-thickness margin-inclusive excisions of up to 10 mm in horizontal extent and 5-6 mm in height, and moderate sized 13 X 10 mm juxtamarginal excisions of the skin and orbicularis lamella, yield near normal results with solely spontaneous repair. Immediate surgical reconstruction of such wounds is assumed to be mandatory by current tenets of oculoplastic surgery.\r"

Three ocular melanoma biopsy specimens had S-100 protein at levels between 25 and 1300 ng/ml, comparable to that found in a cutaneous melanoma biopsy specimen (1000 ng/ml). (SI conversion: ng/ml = microgram/l.) Six melanoma culture lines had 1000 to 125,000 ng/ml. Four lymphoblastoid cultures had less than 2 ng/ml, and three colon carcinoma cultures had 180 ng/ml. Subretinal fluid from 23 melanoma-containing eyes had 10 to 76,800 ng/ml. Lesser amounts were found in eyes with small, anteriorly located, lightly pigmented tumours. Vitreous from 3 melanoma-containing eyes had 10,000 to 11,000 ng/ml.

Results of the FLASH imaging sequence at different values of repetition time, different values of \"flip angle\" and different numbers of acquisitions are described both qualitatively and quantitatively. At low flip angles, both tumour and oedema appear brighter than surrounding white matter. Increasing the flip angle tends to make oedema brighter than both tumour and white matter and increasing the flip angle still further makes tumour and oedema darker than white matter. A major limitation of this technique is that the low flip angle images, in particular, suffer from low signal-to-noise ratios. High flip angle FLASH images have higher signal-to-noise ratios but show similar contrast behaviour to T1-weighted spin-echo images and are likely to be no better as a screening sequence for intracerebral metastases. All the FLASH sequences showed a sensitivity to changes in magnetic susceptibility. This made small intratumoral haemorrhages and basal ganglia \"calcification\" easier to detect than on spin-echo images but also caused susceptibility artefacts in images around the base of the skull.\r"

The method of testing and of measuring the inflated balloons is described. It was found that there were considerable variations in the behaviour of different balloons, and the relevance of this to arterial rupture is discussed. There were significant associations between the manufacturer and premature rupture of the balloon (p less than 0.01), and between co-axial construction of the catheter and overdistension of the balloon by more than 20% (p less than 0.01). The balloon length and the stated maximum diameter were not associated with either premature failure or overdistension.\r"

This suggests the last illness factor is about 5% and is thus very small compared with the other factors to be taken into account in assessing the harm from diagnostic radiation.\r"

  ".W": "Radiation-induced changes in duodenal mucosal morphology as seen by scanning electron microscopy have been widely reported in the literature. However, no comment has previously been made on any post-irradiation alteration in the duodenal papilla. This paper describes the preliminary results of an investigation into the effects of X rays on the papilla. The duodenal papilla was difficult to find in untreated and sham irradiated mice. It was identified in only two of six mice examined and was located 5.37 and 4.43 mm from the gastroduodenal junction. Eighteen hours after irradiation with 15 Gy X rays, there was little change in position or prominence of the papilla. However, 3 days after treatment, the papilla was only 2.19-3.83 mm from the pylorus. It was also more prominent, being found in all three animals studied and having a widely dilated orifice in contrast to the closed structure seen in the unirradiated specimens. It is concluded that treatment with X rays alters the structure of the duodenal papilla. There may be implications for duodenal function in this marked change in the papilla, which controls the flow of pancreatic and biliary secretions.\r"

  ".W": "Following the local irradiation of the rat brain with single doses of 17.5-25 Gy of X rays, necrosis of the white matter was seen after a latent interval of greater than 26 weeks. At 39 weeks and 52 weeks after irradiation the incidence of necrosis was dose-related. The doses associated with a 50% incidence of necrosis in the white matter (ED50) at these times were 23.45 +/- 0.49 and 20.98 +/- 0.91 Gy, respectively. At both these times the incidence of necrosis was higher in the fimbria than in the capsula interna and the corpus callosum. This reflects a variation in the latency time for the appearance of necrosis. Necrosis occurs earlier in the fimbria. In the corpus callosum and the capsula interna the latency times for the appearance of necrosis were also dose-dependent. In the latent period prior to the onset of necrosis of the fimbria, a number of dose-related changes were seen in the vasculature and the associated astroglial cells. These changes, which included blood vessel dilation, blood vessel wall thickening, endothelial cell nuclear enlargement and the hypertrophy of perivascular astrocytes, were highly correlated and when combined appeared to represent a \"unit of tissue injury\". The incidence and severity of this \"unit of tissue injury\" apparently increased with time after irradiation until necrosis ensued. These dose-related vascular/glial changes were preceded by a reduction in the endothelial cell and vascular density. No early changes were seen in the number of glial parenchymal cells.\r"

In Newcastle, the Manchester technique was used until 1971, when a manually afterloaded system (MAS) using caesium 137 and two source trains was introduced. In 1985, the MAS was replaced by the Selectron remote afterloading system (RAS), which also uses caesium-137 sources. The dosimetry of this remote system has been designed to produce the same shape of isodose distributions as the MAS, but shorter treatment times. The applicator design and the dosimetry of the system used in Newcastle are discussed. Dose rates achieved by the RAS are more than double those currently produced by the MAS, and a reduction in prescribed dose of 10-20% is being made. The percentage of ward staff receiving monthly doses of more than 0.2 mSv has fallen from 78% to 18% since the introduction of the remote afterloading system. The almost-cylindrical isodose distributions facilitate matching of external beam treatments using a central lead wedge to the intracavitary treatments, and work is in progress to develop this technique.\r"

  ".W": "Two patients with osteoporosis circumscripta of the skull are presented who have each been treated with a 3-month course of intravenous infusions of (3-amino-1-hydroxypropylidene)-1,1-bisphosphonate (APD) (total dose of 185 and 375 mg), which in both cases was associated with rapid and dramatic remineralization of the porotic bone and marked clinical and biochemical remission. However, osteolytic disease reappeared (after 9 and 18 months, respectively) in both cases as an osteolytic ring showing high uptake of radiolabelled bisphosphonate on bone scan, in formerly unaffected bone just distal to the original leading edge of osteolysis. Further treatment was associated with healing of these new lesions. These cases suggest that the diseased osteoclasts entering previously normal bone are protected against the drug probably because normal bone matrix takes up relatively little APD, and that APD taken up by diseased bone behind this front confers long-term resistance to further resorption. In assessing treatment strategies with bisphosphonates for Paget's disease, the response at the leading edge of osteoporosis circumscripta may be particularly informative.\r"

We treated 55 bladder tumours in 12 patients by laser coagulation, with total destruction of 54 tumours and no serious complications; 6 patients developed recurrent tumours. Twenty-one patients underwent surgery with the contact laser scalpel. The instrument proved slow but effective, with excellent haemostasis and almost painless wounds. Healing was delayed in 2 cases but there were no wound infections. All wounds healed with good cosmetic scars. The neodymium-YAG laser is an effective means of destroying superficial non-invasive bladder tumours endoscopically and can also be used in conjunction with a laser scalpel for open surgery.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the possibility that variations of the metabolism of xenobiotic compounds might be involved in the process of bladder carcinogenesis, by studying activation reactions (phase I) and detoxification reactions (phase II) of xenobiotic compounds in a group of patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder and in a group of controls hospitalised with other diseases. As an indirect estimate of activating reactions (phase I) we measured cortisol hydroxylation, expressed as the ratio between urinary 6-beta-OH-cortisol and 17-OH-corticosteroids. Cortisol hydroxylation was not increased in the group of patients when compared with controls. The variations of phase II conjugating enzymes were followed indirectly by administering paracetamol and measuring the urinary excretion of its main metabolites over a period of 12 h. The variations in the metabolic conjugation of paracetamol were expressed as a percentage of each metabolite, or of unmodified paracetamol excreted in the urine, or as the ratio between a given metabolite and unmodified paracetamol. The data were analyzed with a logistic regression model, analysing the effects of possible confounding variables such as age, smoking, alcohol, blood nitrogen, blood creatinine, glutamic-pyruvic (SGPT), glutamic-oxalacetic transaminases (SGOT) and percent recovery of paracetamol in the urine. Statistical analysis showed that the excretion of mercapturate derivatives of paracetamol was significantly increased in the group of patients. The levels of glucuronic, sulphate and cysteine metabolites were not varied significantly. Since mercapturate derivatives are formed as a consequence of the formation of short-lived metabolites of paracetamol which react with protein, nucleic acids or glutathione, the increased excretion of mercapturic acid derivatives in cancer patients might be an indication of a higher capability of forming reactive molecular species from xenobiotic compounds. We suggest that this factor might play a role in the induction of bladder cancer.\r"

No significant correlation between peak flow rate and age was found within this group. Symptoms of poor stream, nocturia, post-micturition dribble and nocturnal or full-bladder hesitancy were present in over two-thirds of the whole series. Poor stream, hesitancy and nocturnal or full-bladder hesitancy were found to have significant associations with abnormal flowmetry recordings but also to have a high incidence within the normal flowmetry group. Discriminant analysis was unable to define a symptom complex which would accurately predict those within our group with abnormal peak flows. It was concluded that symptomatology and flowmetry evidence of lower urinary tract obstruction are not associated and subjective and objective evidence must be considered independently in selecting candidates for prostatectomy.\r"

The laparoscope was also introduced into the retropubic space through a second puncture. The prostatic commissure was identified, coagulated and divided, sparing the mucosa of the prostatic urethra. Commissurotomy causes urethral decompression, which is the aim of any treatment for benign prostatic hypertrophy. The result was satisfactory in 85% of patients. Failures were due to incomplete commissurotomy; laparoscopic revision led to good results. Urethral stricture, incontinence or epididymitis did not occur. Ejaculation was normal.

All patients underwent total prostatectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy. In cases of intracapsular prostatic cancer the level of prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) measured by radioimmunoassay was 1.4 +/- 0.8 micrograms/l. In patients with either local extraprostatic disease or pelvic lymph node metastases the mean level of PAP was 3.5 +/- 2.8 micrograms/l. The difference was statistically significant. The specificity, sensitivity and accuracy of an elevated PAP (greater than 3.0 micrograms/l) in revealing extraprostatic extension of clinically localised prostatic cancer were 100, 37 and 66% respectively. When the enzymatic method was used, the level of acid phosphatase was elevated (greater than 13 u/l) in only 1 case. The specificity, sensitivity and accuracy of the enzymatic method were 100, 6 and 47% respectively. Elevation of PAP predicts, with a high degree of probability, either local extension outside the prostate or lymph node metastases.

About half of the patients experienced pain after treatment. Two patients developed infection. Ultrasonography showed no change in the testicular tissue during the follow-up period. Sclerotherapy with ethanolamine oleate is a rapid and cost-effective modality which can be recommended as primary treatment for hydroceles and for unilocular epididymal cysts, especially in elderly males.\r"

All of the latter and 5 of the teratoma patients had relapsed following radiotherapy, chemotherapy or both. The previously untreated teratoma patients included 13 whose tumours were extragonadal. The primary testicular tumour patients comprised 16 with large and 21 with very large volume metastases according to the Medical Research Council criteria. POMB/ACE is effective therapy for poor risk patients with germ cell tumours (including those with the most advanced disease, i.e. hepatic and cerebral metastases) and prolonged treatment after marker normality seems unnecessary. It is a complex regime with significant toxicity and cannot be recommended for the treatment of patients with germ cell tumours who have an excellent prognosis with simpler, shorter and less toxic treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Although femorofemoral bypass grafting was originally used only as a method of limb salvage, it is now used increasingly in patients with claudication. If this trend is to be supported, the haemodynamic consequences of the operation must be carefully assessed. Fifteen patients undergoing femorofemoral grafting were studied prospectively by intra-operative measurement of the inflow resistance (IR) of the donor iliac segment. Three groups were identified by this technique. Patients with an IR less than 0.05 (n = 8) were uncomplicated; those with an IR greater than or equal to 0.05 but less than 0.10 (n = 5) developed a subclinical steal syndrome; and those with an IR greater than 0.10 (n = 2) developed a clinical steal syndrome. High initial IR values were corrected at the time of surgery in two cases. This study demonstrates that steal syndromes can occur after femorofemoral grafting and that the cause is an unmasking of previously unrecognized disease in the donor arterial segment. The measurement of IR allows the prediction of steal syndromes and their correction at the time of surgery. Direct haemodynamic studies are recommended, especially as the availability of balloon angioplasty has made inflow disease amenable to treatment.\r"

Four patients thought clinically to have benign disease were proven by cytology to have a carcinoma, but no patient with a cytopathological diagnosis of benign disease has developed cancer during or subsequent to this study. We recommend that patients under 35 years of age with clinically and cytologically benign breast lumps can be offered the option of non-excision in the reasonable expectation of resolution of their lesion.\r"

The temperature gradient between the rectum and the anal canal was measured in 47 normal subjects (mean age 51.6 years +/- 16.8 s.d., 24 men). The maximum mean difference in temperature between the rectum and the anal canal was 0.13 degrees C (0.06-0.19, 95 per cent confidence intervals) and occurred 4 cm from the anal verge. This difference is too small to be detected by the anal canal mucosa. Under normal physiological circumstances the conscious appreciation of temperature of faeces passing from the rectum to the anal canal is impossible during the anorectal sampling reflex.\r"

The degree of rectal distension required to initiate the recto-anal reflex was no different in the incontinent patients (19 ml, range 15-25 ml, compared with 22 ml, range 15-30 ml, in the controls). There was also no difference in the maximal tolerated volume of rectal distension between the groups (291 +/- 87 ml and 279 +/- 91 ml respectively). These observations may have defined a small group of patients with incontinence in whom an abnormality of rectal sensation rather than sphincter incompetence could be a part of the pathophysiological disorder.\r"

Seven (32 per cent) patients had malignancy (invasive Paget's disease (n = 5) and coexisting visceral carcinoma (n = 2] and six (27 per cent) developed malignancy (invasive Paget's disease (n = 4) and coexisting visceral carcinoma (n = 2] during follow-up, giving an overall occurrence of malignancies of 59 per cent (95 per cent confidence limits: 36-79). The median follow-up period was 9 (range 0.5-25) years. No difference in length of history could be found between patients with or without malignancy. The estimated cure rate by actuarial analysis among radically treated patients was 64 per cent (95 per cent confidence limits: 43-91) at 1 year and 45 per cent (95 per cent confidence limits: 18-72) at 8 years after primary treatment.

The difference between the mean PNTML before and after straining (delta PNTML) was correlated with the amount of descent (r = 0.40, P less than 0.005), and with the perineal position during straining (r = -0.46, P less than 0.001). Four minutes after the straining effort the PNTML again approached the resting value in each subject. These findings support the concept that perineal descent causes pudendal nerve damage.\r"

A standard procedure (truncal vagotomy, antrectomy and gastrojejunal anatomosis using a 70 cm Roux-en-Y loop) was performed in 41 patients, and some technical adjustments were required in 18 patients previously operated on. One patient died from postoperative pulmonary embolism. Bowel movements were resumed before the fifth postoperative day in 93 per cent of patients (54/59). Early postoperative complications (gastroparesis, 5; fistula, 1; subsequent operation, 1) occurred in 12 per cent of patients. Stabilization of the oesophagitis was achieved in less than 3 months in 95 per cent of cases (55/58). There were two cases of regression of columnar lined oesophagus. A 3-h postprandial pH assessment showed that the reflux had been controlled in 92 per cent of cases (47/51). One patient who still had an acid reflux died subsequently of a perforated oesophageal ulcer. Three anastomotic ulcers occurred in eight patients who did not have vagotomy. Digestive side-effects have been observed in nine patients, but only in one case were they crippling. Our results suggest that TDD is a suitable form of treatment for complicated forms of peptic oesophagitis.\r"

In the multivariate analysis, three of fifteen variables were associated with the prognosis of patients who underwent oesophagectomy. The variables are: resectability of the malignant lesion, DNA distribution pattern of the cancer cells and postoperative complications. The DNA distribution pattern proved to be one of the most reliable prognostic factors. These three variables were assigned one of two values, 'favourable' or 'unfavourable', indicative of the effect on survival. The 123 patients were classified into four groups, characterized by eight possible combinations of these three variables. The survival rate of those with two or more 'favourable' variables was the highest, that is about 50 per cent at 5 years after surgery. On the other hand, patients with two or more 'unfavourable' variables had a very poor prognosis. Therefore, early detection and postoperative care play key roles in determining the survival of patients with oesophageal carcinoma.\r"

Four patients had been transferred from other hospitals; the remaining 17 patients had been treated from the outset at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, representing 3.7 per cent of the 456 patients treated for acute pancreatitis during this time. Necrosectomy was performed on 14 patients and 7 patients were treated by pancreatic resection, with 4 deaths in each group; thus 8 patients (38 per cent) died at a median time of 22 days from onset of their attack. Three of the four patients transferred to our care died, giving a mortality in our own patients of 29 per cent. Of the survivors, all but three had a prolonged and complicated hospital course. Our data confirm that acute necrotizing pancreatitis is still associated with a considerable mortality and morbidity. Early multi-organ failure, advanced age, underlying medical illness and the presence of infected necrosis were associated with a poor outcome. Necrosectomy delayed until the second or subsequent week appeared to be a suitable procedure for the majority of our patients, but shortcomings were apparent with the traditional methods of closed drainage of the pancreatic bed postoperatively. The many demands imposed by this small group of patients suggests that their management is best undertaken in centres in which there is special expertise and this should contribute to a further reduction in the mortality from this condition.\r"

  ".W": "During a recent 6-year period we have encountered 10 patients with 'hepatocellular pseudotumour in the cirrhotic liver' (regenerating hyperplastic nodule). The patients were all male, aged 40-82 years. Seven were chronic alcohol consumers. None was positive for HBs-Ag but seven had either anti-HBs or anti-HBc. Serum AFP level ranged from 4 to 28 ng/ml in six patients who did not have hepatocellular carcinoma at the time of the diagnosis of the pseudotumour. The lesions were depicted by ultrasonography in seven, by computed tomography in two, and by angiography in one case. Liver scan was negative in all five cases investigated. The pre-operative diagnosis was definitely or highly suspicious of hepatocellular carcinoma in three, of pseudotumour in the cirrhotic liver in three, and of recurrent carcinoma in one. In another three patients, pseudotumour was coincidentally discovered in resected specimens with hepatocellular carcinoma. The histopathological and follow-up studies demonstrated synchronous or metachronous development of carcinoma in seven patients. Whether or not these lesions in the cirrhotic liver are premalignant remains to be elucidated.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-eight consecutive surgical pancreatic resections for chronic pancreatitis were examined. Eight cases were identified with obstructive pancreatopathy; all underwent pancreato-duodenectomy. Histological examination revealed that obstruction in three cases was due to duodenal wall cysts, and in two patients it was associated with pancreas divisum (the accessory papilla was obstructed by a neuroendocrine tumour in one case and by ectopic pancreatic tissue in the other). One case each was due to obstruction of an anomalous duct by vegetable matter, to segmental pancreatitis, and to an intraductal carcinoma. Obstructive pancreatitis has many causes and diligent pre-operative assessment is required as surgical resection may be beneficial. Special efforts should be made to identify ductal anomalies, duodenal cysts, ectopic pancreatic tissue, and small ampullary tumours of exocrine and endocrine origin in order to define the aetiology of pancreatitis.\r"

Splenectomy is no longer the treatment of choice for splenic injury and splenic salvage is recommended whenever feasible. Since 1982, in the Isle of Wight hospitals, 13 cases of splenic injury following trauma have been treated applying various salvage procedures and are reported here.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective study has been performed to measure the incidence of postoperative urinary retention in 280 general surgical patients. Eighteen patients (6 per cent) were catheterized after a range of operations under general anaesthesia. There was no statistical difference in the retention rate between men and women. Increasing age did not predispose to retention of urine. Of 72 patients who had either herniorrhaphy, haemorrhoidectomy or testicular operations, only 1 was catheterized, whereas 16 (23 per cent) of 70 patients undergoing laparotomy were catheterized. Most of these laparotomy patients had upper abdominal procedures carried out. Those having lower abdominal operations were usually catheterized pre-operatively and were excluded from the study. There was a significantly higher incidence of retention among patients who had long anaesthetics (greater than 60 min). There was also a significantly higher incidence of retention among those who were ventilated, relaxed and reversed by atropine and neostigmine. Of those 193 patients who had opiate analgesia, 15 (8 per cent) developed retention of urine, compared with 3 (3 per cent) of the 87 patients who had non-opiate analgesia. There was a significantly higher retention rate among the patients who had opiate analgesia by intravenous infusion compared with those who had opiates by intramuscular bolus injection; 7 patients had painful and 11 had painless retention. This study suggests that postoperative retention of urine is a result more commonly of diminished awareness of bladder sensation, than of factors such as anxiety or local pain.\r"

  ".W": "A review of inpatients treated for parotid tumours during the 5-year period 1978 to 1982 in the Northern Regional Health Authority of the United Kingdom revealed 376 new parotid tumours and 28 recurrent tumours. The incidence of new parotid tumours was 2.4 per 100,000 and of pleomorphic adenomas 1.5 per 100,000 per annum. Local excision was the most common operation and was employed to remove 156 (67.2 per cent) of the 232 pleomorphic adenomas but there was evidence of incomplete excision in 60 (38.5 per cent) of these tumours. Incomplete excision also occurred in 12 (15.8 per cent) of the 76 pleomorphic adenomas removed by conservative parotidectomy. Global temporary facial nerve palsy was more common after conservative parotidectomy for benign tumours (21.8 per cent) than after local excision (3.7 per cent) but global permanent nerve palsy only occurred after local excision (0.9 per cent). The widespread use of local excision resulted in its use in 12 (27.3 per cent) of the 44 malignant tumours. The low incidence of parotid tumours and their treatment by a relatively large number of surgeons resulted in limited experience for surgeons and few opportunities for training in parotid surgery.\r"
