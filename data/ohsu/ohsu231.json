In all 12 subjects receiving r-IFN, HBV DNAp and HBV DNA levels fell during the course of r-IFN injections. Within 4 weeks of cessation of r-IFN injection, the HBV DNAp and HBV DNA returned to pre-trial levels except in 2 subjects, in whom loss of HBV DNAp and HBV DNA was sustained for up to 18 months from onset of the trial. 1 child lost HBeAg at 18 months. 2 of the 12 children in the placebo group also had a sustained loss of HBV DNAp and HBV DNA during the 18 months, with 1 child losing HBeAg at 18 months. All 24 subjects remained positive for HBsAg. r-IFN produced very slight side-effects except for pyrexia and the \"flu\" syndrome, both of which showed rapid tachyphylaxis. In the dose given r-IFN was safe but had no long-term beneficial effects on HBsAg carriage in Chinese children.\r"

Clinical pathological correlates including recent clinical experience are discussed for perilymphatic fistulas (sudden deafness, chronic progressive fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, and association with Meniere's disease), sensorineural hearing loss in acute and chronic otitis media, and findings in round window membrane including absent round window reflex in cases of exploratory tympanotomy and otosclerosis.

When the fibroblasts alone were implanted in the subcutaneous tissues of nude mice, growth of a visible lesion was again produced. The fibroblasts had proliferated and deposited collagen in an abnormal fashion with the histology resembling the parent keloid. Further research could develop this into a reliable animal model to allow in vivo experimentation.\r"

We have examined the relationships between these two diagnostic indices and several lipoprotein atherogenic risk factors, e.g., serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipo-protein-cholesterol (LDL-C) among 74 healthy male volunteers, aged 20 to 56 yr. The Doppler signal from the radial artery was digitized and processed with the Hamming window and 512-point fast Fourier transform to obtain frequency power spectra and PI index by a desktop computer. PWV was determined on the computer by dividing the distance between two pressure transducers placed over the radial and carotid arteries by the transit time difference between the maximal first derivatives (dP/dt) of the recorded arterial pulse waves. The results indicated that PI was inversely related to TC, LDL-C, and TG (r = -0.50, -0.41, -0.54, respectively, P less than 0.001), but evidenced a positive relationship with the HDL-C/TC ratio (r = 0.69, P less than 0.001). PWV was also significantly correlated to TC (r = 0.40) and TG (r = 0.42), but was inversely associated with the HDL-C/TC ratio (r = -0.45, P less than 0.001). These findings are consistent with the current theory relating lipids to the pathology of atherosclerosis.\r"

  ".W": "Phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance (31P NMR) spectroscopy is a non-destructive analytical laboratory technique that, due to recent technical advances, has become applicable to the study of high-energy phosphate metabolism in both animal and human extremity muscles (in vivo). 31P NMR can assay cellular phosphocreatine, ATP, inorganic phosphate, the phosphorylated glycolytic intermediates, and intra-cellular pH in either resting or exercising muscle, in a non-invasive manner. NMR uses non-perturbing levels of radio-frequency energy as its biophysical probe and can therefore safely study intact muscle in a repeated fashion while exerting no artifactual influence on ongoing metabolic processes. Compared with standard tissue biopsy and biochemical assay techniques, NMR possesses the advantages of being non-invasive, allowing serial in situ studies of the same tissue sample, and providing measurements of only active (unbound) metabolites. NMR studies of exercising muscle have yielded information regarding fatigue mechanisms at the cellular level and are helping resolve long-standing questions regarding the metabolic control of glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and post-exercise phosphocreatine re-synthesis. NMR is also being utilized to measure enzymatic reaction rates in vivo. In the near future, other forms of NMR spectroscopy may also permit the non-invasive measurement of tissue glycogen and lactate content.\r"

At the cellular level the primary anabolic hormones for cultured myoblasts are the somatomedins (insulin-like growth factors) and fibroblast growth factor. In these cells physiological concentrations of growth hormone, thyroid hormones, and insulin have no growth-promoting effect; some of the reported actions of insulin probably result from cross-reaction with the somatomedin receptor. Results with purified proteins do not support the view that mitogens block myoblast differentiation; transforming growth factor-beta and interferon are nonmitogenic proteins that inhibit differentiation, insulin-like growth factors are mitogens that stimulate differentiation, and fibroblast growth factor is the only purified mitogen that inhibits differentiation. At least six serum-free media have now been devised for the growth of various kinds of muscle cells under closely defined conditions.\r"

In five men with essential hypertension in whom blood pressure was normal with restriction of dietary sodium chloride to 10 mmol per day (0.23 g of sodium per day), oral administration of sodium chloride for seven days, 240 mmol per day (5.52 g of sodium per day), induced significant increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures, of 16 +/- 2 and 8 +/- 2 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM), respectively (P less than 0.05). An equimolar amount of sodium given as sodium citrate induced no change in blood pressure. Replacing supplemental sodium chloride with an equimolar amount of sodium as sodium citrate abolished the increase in blood pressure induced by sodium chloride. Both salts induced substantial and comparable sodium retention, weight gain, and suppression of plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone, but supplemental sodium chloride increased plasma volume and urinary excretion of calcium, whereas sodium citrate did not. These preliminary findings demonstrate that the anionic component of an orally administered sodium salt can influence the ability of that salt to increase blood pressure, possibly by determining whether the salt induces an increase in plasma volume. Our observations in a small group of men with salt-sensitive hypertension will require confirmation in larger numbers of patients of both sexes.\r"

Fifty-nine CMV-seronegative patients who received kidneys from donors who had antibodies against CMV were assigned to receive either intravenous CMV immune globulin or no treatment. The immune globulin was administered in multiple doses over the first four months after transplantation. The incidence of virologically confirmed CMV-associated syndromes was reduced from 60 percent in controls to 21 percent in recipients of CMV immune globulin (P less than 0.01). Fungal or parasitic superinfections were not seen in globulin recipients but occurred in 20 percent of controls (P = 0.05). Only 4 percent of globulin recipients had marked leukopenia (reflecting serious CMV disease), as compared with 37 percent of the controls (P less than 0.01). There was a concomitant but not statistically significant reduction in the incidence of CMV pneumonia (17 percent of controls as compared with 4 percent of globulin recipients). A significant reduction in serious CMV-associated disease was observed even when patients were stratified according to therapy for transplant rejection (P = 0.04). We observed no effect of immune globulin on rates of viral isolation or seroconversion, suggesting that treated patients often harbored the virus but that clinically evident disease was much less likely to develop in them. We conclude that CMV immune globulin provides effective prophylaxis in renal-transplant recipients at risk for primary CMV disease.\r"

  ".W": "We performed a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial of antibiotic administration to treat possible occult bacteremia in febrile children. A total of 955 children aged 3 to 36 months with temperatures greater than or equal to 39.0 degrees C and no focal bacterial infection were enrolled at the emergency departments of two children's hospitals from January 1982 until July 1984. Blood samples for culture were obtained, and the children were randomly assigned to receive either oral amoxicillin or placebo and were restudied approximately 48 hours after enrollment. Data were also collected on 228 children who could not be randomly assigned. Twenty-seven of the randomly assigned children (2.8 percent) had bacteremic infections with pathogenic organisms (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and salmonella). There were no differences in the incidence of major infectious morbidity associated with bacteremia between the antibiotic and placebo groups--2 of 19 patients (10.5 percent) in the antibiotic group and 1 of 8 (12.5 percent) in the placebo group--although the power for this comparison was low. Antibiotics reduced fever (P less than 0.005) and improved the clinical appearance (P = 0.07) in the children with bacteremia but not in those without bacteremia. Although there were no statistically significant differences in the incidence of side effects, diarrhea tended to occur more often in the patients treated with amoxicillin (15 vs. 11 percent, P less than 0.10). We conclude that our data do not support the routine use of standard oral doses of amoxicillin in febrile children who do not have evidence of focal bacterial disease.\r"

Their hyponatremia (mean serum sodium concentration [+/- SE], 108 +/- 1 mmol per liter) was increased to 126 +/- 1 mmol per liter with hypertonic saline (856 mM) delivered at a rate of 1.3 +/- 0.2 mmol per liter per hour. The serum sodium concentration did not rise to normal or hypernatremic levels in the first 48 hours of therapy, and none of these patients had a respiratory arrest or other hypoxic episode. Twelve patients, evaluated retrospectively, had evidence of cerebral demyelinating lesions at autopsy or on computerized axial tomography. The rate of correction of hyponatremia (1 +/- 0.2 mmol per liter per hour) was similar to the rate in the patients in Group I. However, at least one of four characteristics was present: an increase in serum sodium to normal or hypernatremic levels in the first 48 hours, a change in the serum sodium concentration of more than 25 mmol per liter in the first 48 hours, a hypoxic-anoxic episode, and an elevation of serum sodium to hypernatremic levels in patients with hepatic encephalopathy. Although these four features were associated with demyelination, our observations suggest that this complication does not depend on the rate of correction of hyponatremia.\r"

  ".W": "The Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, although uncommon, is not rare, and most patients with the disorder present with clinical manifestations similar to those of patients with common peptic ulcer. Early studies emphasized death due to complications of massive gastric acid hypersecretion. However, with the availability of potent antisecretory agents to control acid secretion, death is now more frequently associated with the metastatic potential of slowly growing but malignant gastrinomas. Therefore, physicians should maintain a high degree of suspicion of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome in assessing patients with either chronic peptic ulcer or unexplained secretory diarrhea. An evaluation aimed at early diagnosis of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome should be instituted in such patients and should begin with a determination of the fasting serum gastrin level. At least 50 percent of patients with gastrinoma will have nondiagnostic serum gastrin concentrations and will therefore require provocative testing to establish the correct diagnosis. After the presence of the syndrome is established, patients should be treated with a potent antisecretory agent in doses sufficient to reduce basal acid output to less than 10 mmol in the hour preceding administration of the next dose. Although some patients may be maintained satisfactorily in this manner for extended periods, an approach aimed at tumor localization and extirpation is recommended in most patients. Preoperative evaluation should begin with CT scanning with intravenous contrast material. Selective angiography, and occasionally, portal venous sampling for gastrin, should be performed if the location and extent of tumor remain in question. If metastatic disease is demonstrated, or if MEN-I is present, surgery aimed at tumor resection, although it is occasionally effective, will probably be unsuccessful. Because of the considerable morbidity and mortality associated with pancreatoduodenectomy, it should not be performed for unresectable tumor in the head of the pancreas. In other patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, exploratory surgery should be performed; this should include a careful search for, and resection of, all pancreatic and extrapancreatic gastrinomas. With this approach, it is likely that at least 20 percent of all patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome can be cured.\r"

Since then we have examined the function of interleukin B in a number of immune reactions, both in vitro and in vivo, and found that it inhibits the activation of suppressor T lymphocytes. We report here the production of two monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that specifically inhibit interleukin B activity. The use of these mAb in the purification and characterization of IL-B is described. IL-B from both normal and transformed B cells consists of two subunits of similar size and amino-acid composition. The structure of interleukin B and its specific behaviour in biological assay distinguish it from many other known lymphokines.\r"

  ".W": "Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) recognize antigen in the context of the class-I products of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The extensive polymorphism of class-I molecules is thought to be linked to their capacity to present a large variety of foreign antigens. Whether a single T-cell receptor (TCR) recognizes two separate epitopes (the foreign antigen and an epitope on MHC molecules), or a single epitope resulting from the combination of a foreign antigen and an MHC molecule, has not yet been resolved. In view of the differences between species in primary structure of histocompatibility antigens, it might be predicted that the TCR repertoire would evolve in concert with the diversity of MHC antigens. The mouse and human TCR repertoire would be optimally adapted to engage in productive interactions only with mouse (H-2) and human (HLA) MHC antigens respectively, especially if the more conserved features of histocompatibility antigens, in addition to foreign antigen, were seen by the TCR. Alternatively, only the most variable segments of MHC antigens might be engaged in antigen presentation and thus in interaction with the TCR. In that case, interaction between MHC plus antigen and the TCR might not necessarily be limited by species-specific features. By analysis of the T-cell response against virus-infected cells in HLA-B27/human beta 2-microglobulin double transgenic mice, we report here that the mouse T-cell repertoire is perfectly capable of using the human HLA-B27 antigen as a restriction element.\r"

  ".W": "The large T antigen (T) of simian virus 40 is a multifunctional protein required for both viral DNA replication and cellular transformation. T antigen forms specific protein complexes with the host protein p53 in both virus-infected and transformed cells. p53 has recently been shown to be an oncogene, but its normal function is not clear. We previously established a radioimmunoassay to study the newly described complex between T antigen and DNA polymerase alpha, and have noted a similarity between the antigenic changes induced in T by the binding of both p53 and polymerase. We now extend this analysis to a larger collection of anti-T antibodies and formally establish that p53 and DNA polymerase alpha can compete for binding to the SV40 T antigen. At a critical concentration of the three components it is possible to detect a trimeric complex of T, p53 and DNA polymerase alpha. Our observations have important implications for the control by these nuclear oncogenes of viral and cellular DNA synthesis and viral host range in both normal and transformed cells. We present a model for the action of p53 in growth control.\r"

Several reports have implicated p53 in mammalian cell cycle control and specifically with events occurring at the G0-G1 boundary. p53 forms specific complexes with simian virus 40 (SV40) large-T antigen, and such complexes are found associated with both replicating and mature SV40 DNA in lytically infected cells. In an accompanying paper Gannon and Lane report that in in vitro plate-binding assays, mouse p53 can displace polymerase alpha from complex with T-antigen. We have examined the in vivo consequences of expressing wild-type and mutant p53 proteins from other species in SV40-transformed monkey cells. We report here that expression of mouse p53 results in a substantial and selective inhibition of SV40 origin-dependent DNA replication. In addition to any function in the G0-G1 transition, the data presented suggest that p53 may affect directly the initiation or maintenance of replicative DNA synthesis.\r"

A site-specific DNA inversion regulates the expression of flagellin genes in Salmonella by switching the orientation of a promoter. Analysis of the reaction has shown that, in addition to DNA sequences at the two boundaries of the 1-kilobase invertible segment where strand exchange occurs, another cis acting sequence is required for efficient inversion. This 60-base-pair enhancer-like sequence can function at many different locations and in either orientation in a plasmid substrate. It includes two binding sites for a host protein called Factor II or Fis (refs 4 and 5). Here we have investigated the importance of the spatial relationship between the two Fis binding sites for enhancer activity and have found that the correct helical positioning of the binding sites on the DNA is critical. However, this result could not be accounted for by effects on Fis binding. We propose a model for enhancer function in which the enhancer region acts to align the recombination sites into a specific conformation required for productive synapsis.\r"

The correct processing of precursor polyproteins is necessary for the infectivity of virus particles: in vitro mutagenesis which introduces deletions into the murine leukaemia virus genome produces a protease-defective virus of immature core form and lacking infectivity. A therapeutic drug effective against disease caused by retrovirus proliferation could likewise interfere with virus maturation. The primary structure has so far been determined for the protease of avian myeloblastosis virus, and of murine, feline and bovine leukaemia viruses. Amino acid sequencing of the retrovirus proteases, either after their purification or from prediction from the nucleotide sequence, shows that they possess the Asp-Thr-Gly sequence characteristic of the aspartyl proteinases. In this report we show that retrovirus proteases belong to the aspartyl proteinase group and demonstrate an inhibition by the aspartyl proteinase-specific inhibitor, pepstatin A, on the activity of bovine leukaemia, Moloney murine leukaemia and human T-cell leukaemia virus proteases.\r"

The D-2 dopamine agonist, LY 171555, but not the D-1 agonist, SKF 38393, reduced parkinsonian signs and induced rotation away from the side of the nigral lesion. When administered together, SKF 38393 diminished the LY 171555-induced turning in a dose-dependent manner. A selective D-1 antagonist, SCH 23390, induced mild and brief rotation when administered alone. These results suggest that D-2 receptor stimulation is necessary to ameliorate parkinsonism, but that pharmacologic manipulation of both D-1 and D-2 receptors may be required for an optimal therapeutic response.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective ultrasound study was conducted in 289 uncomplicated pregnancies with gestational ages ranging from 16-40 weeks. Biometric measurements obtained included biparietal diameter (BPD), head and abdominal circumferences, measurements of long bones, and maximal transverse colon diameter. The pattern of small intestinal peristalsis, presence of colonic haustra, and progressive changes in the colon's intraluminal echogenicity were also evaluated. A high degree of correlation was found between gestational age and transverse colon diameter (in millimeters) (R2 = 0.859; P less than .0001), increasing colonic intraluminal echogenicity (R2 = 0.741; P less than .0001), and the appearance and progressive increase in small intestinal peristalsis (R2 = 0.726; P less than .0001). Colonic haustra were visualized in 87.5% after 30 weeks (specificity 100%, sensitivity 77.4%). A high degree of correlation with gestational age was also found if echogenicity and peristalsis were combined (R2 = 0.873; P less than .0001), and proved superior to that found with measurement of BPD (R2 = 0.655; P less than .0001) or femur length (R2 = 0.805; P less than .0001) after 28 weeks. Observations of progressive changes in small intestinal peristalsis and colonic intraluminal echogenicity, together with the development of colonic haustra and progressive increase in transverse colon diameter, allow one to estimate gestational age independent of standard biometry. This approach has particular utility in the third trimester, when sonographic estimation of gestational age is least accurate.\r"

These established methods of analyzing the pharmacodynamics frequently fail to determine the more critical tissue concentrations necessary for ultimate drug action. The use of intrauterine pressures to objectively measure uterine response to drug therapy may be used to demonstrate the onset and magnitude of drug action in nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy for patients with primary dysmenorrhea. When continuous intrauterine pressure data is combined with plasma drug level sampling, a reflection of the dynamics of these drugs may be possible. Data were studied from 18 patients who participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose crossover study of subjective and objective responses to meclofenamate. The responses in these patients indicated a clear parallel in time response curves between plasma drug level and alterations in uterine contractile activity. The slight time delay between the changes in blood drug level and the onset of changes in uterine activity is hypothesized to represent the time necessary to establish effective tissue levels. Examples of time response curves are illustrated.\r"

No significant differences in diastolic pressure with and without arterial damping were noted between noninvasive techniques and direct intra-arterial values. The systolic readings obtained with the standard cuff were significantly lower than the intra-arterial values with or without the arterial damping device (P less than .001 in both cases). However, mean systolic BP by automated cuff did not differ significantly from intra-arterial readings in the presence of the damping device (P = .10, not significant). We recommend indirect BP monitoring by automated cuff manometry in nonobese critically ill patients requiring frequent BP readings, and arterial catheter in situations requiring frequent arterial blood samples or oxygenation assessment.\r"

The Hoffer-Colenbrander and Binkhorst theoretical formulas, Donzis-Kastl-Gordon percentage change formula, and a linear regression formula derived from the present data (LIN), were significantly more accurate. The differences between these formulas were not significant.

The DRS also enlightened two generations of ophthalmologists about the value of the randomized controlled clinical trial as a way of assessing new and existing treatments for unsolved therapeutic problems. After the example of the DRS, laser treatment was shown to be effective in reducing vision loss in selected patients with branch retinal vein occlusion, age-related macular degeneration, ocular histoplasmosis, and diabetic macular edema. Existing trials, supported by the National Eye Institute, are seeking to determine the appropriate treatment for selected patients with newly diagnosed glaucoma, vascularized corneas, retinopathy of prematurity, proliferative vitreoretinopathy and complicated retinal detachment, and choroidal melanoma. Clinical practice has benefited enormously from these studies all of which owe their existence, at least in part, to the prototypical clinical trial, the DRS. This symposium discusses the DRS and places it in today's perspective, with a look to the past as well.\r"

Panretinal photocoagulation was in its infancy, the ruby laser was newly introduced, there were no data on the use of the argon laser, and automated vitrectomy had not been introduced. Participants in the symposium set the stage for the acquisition of valid clinical data from which important therapeutic conclusions have subsequently been drawn by (1) summarizing the areas of consensus and disagreement, (2) devising a standard classification of diabetic retinopathy, and (3) proposing controlled clinical trials for unanswered questions.\r"

The median for the cell density of all preparations was 4382 epithelial cells/mm2. Lens epithelium of patients exceeding 50 years of age showed a lower cell density than epithelium of younger patients (P less than 0.05), and, surprisingly, epithelium of females showed a significantly higher density than that of male patients (P less than 0.01).

  ".W": "The authors placed a ceramic keratoprosthesis through the eyelids of 11 consecutive patients: six with alkali injury, four with cicatricial pemphigoid, and one with Stevens-Johnson syndrome. The surgery was technically successful in ten patients. One patient experienced an intraoperative, expulsive choroidal hemorrhage, and the keratoprosthesis was not implanted. Six patients were followed for 21 to 56 months; three, who had no postoperative potential for visual improvement were followed for 2 to 6 months; and one patient died 14 months after surgery. Six patients achieved 20/20 to 20/100 corrected visual acuity at some point after surgery. At last examination, only three eyes (27%) saw 20/200 or better. Complications included eyelid cellulitis, extrusions, aqueous leaks, retroprosthetic membranes, endophthalmitis, and progressive glaucoma. The authors think mechanical torque by movement of eyelid and globe destabilizes the keratoprosthesis, producing many of the complications.\r"

The lenticule remained totally clear in 85% of eyes. Two lenticules were removed due to infection and scarring; four lenticules had minimal scarring and did not require removal. Spectacle-corrected acuity was worse than one line from the preoperative spectacle-corrected acuity in 58% of the adult aphakic eyes; however, 75% were 20/50 or better postoperatively. Fifty percent were within 2 diopters (D) of emmetropia and 92% within 3 D. All pediatric aphakic patients showed an improvement in best-corrected acuity, and 83% of eyes at 6 months were within 2 D of emmetropia; by 1 year a 3.4-D average myopic shift had occurred. Two of the six eyes (33%) using the original myopia technique were within 2 D of emmetropia, whereas five of the six eyes (83%) with the current technique are within this range. Spectacle-corrected acuity in the entire current myopia group has either improved by one or more lines or has remained unchanged. Five of the six keratoconic eyes had 20/40 or better spectacle-corrected and 20/25 contact lens-corrected acuity postoperatively; average corneal flattening was 6 D. Persistent epithelial defect and irregular astigmatism were the principal factors in delay in visual recovery.\r"

For first grafts for herpes, the probability of survival was significantly less than it was for keratoconus (P less than 0.0001). For second grafts, this difference was less pronounced, and for three or more grafts, the difference in survival was not significant. The incidence of rejection episodes was similar in first grafts for herpes (16.6%) and keratoconus (18.5%) (P greater than 0.05). However, the incidence of rejection episodes in regrafts for herpes was significantly greater than in keratoconus (23.7 versus 17%, P less than 0.01). The incidence of failure after rejection episodes (first grafts and regrafts combined) was significantly greater in grafts for herpes (52.4 versus 16.2%, P less than 0.001). Because survival after multiple regrafts in both groups is poor, additional measures, such as tissue matching, may be necessary to improve the likelihood of success in these high-risk cases.\r"

All neoplasms were nonreactive for muramidase and leukocyte common antigen. alpha-1 Antichymotrypsin and HLA-DR immunoreactivity was found focally. Positive S-100 staining was found predominantly in chondrocytes. All tumors were positive for vimentin. Cells in focal zones of cartilage were positive for keratin. No distinctive pattern emerged relative to clinical recurrence and histologic subtype or immunotype. Leukocyte common antigen determinations were useful because they distinguished between neoplastic and inflammatory cells. S-100 protein stains helped in the subclassification of chondroblastic osteosarcoma, and vimentin stains confirmed mesenchymal origin. Cross-reactive staining of cartilage with keratin antibodies was regarded as a possible diagnostic pitfall.\r"

The sampling consisted of specimens diagnosed as normal oral mucosa, reactive epithelial hyperplasia, lichen planus (LP), nonspecific lichenoid stomatitis (NLS), lichenoid dysplasia (LD), carcinoma in situ, and squamous cell carcinoma (SCCa) on routine hematoxylin and eosin examination. Findings were consistent with prior observations of involucrin reactivity in skin and cervical-vaginal mucosa. Specifically, conditions characterized by predominance of mature squamous epithelial cells (superficial layers of normal and hyperplastic oral epithelium, NLS, and LP) exhibited strong involucrin reactivity in such areas. In contrast, atypical or dysplastic lichenoid lesions (LD), as well as carcinoma in situ, despite squamoid differentiation, demonstrated irregular distribution of involucrin, suggesting disturbances in terminal differentiation. Invasive components of SCCa revealed markedly diminished involucrin expression. These findings support prior evidence that LP and LD are biologically distinct lesions. Clinically and microscopically, both may be morphologically similar. However, involucrin reactivity should be helpful in distinguishing difficult cases. Accordingly, we suggest that the use of involucrin immunoreactivity may prove to be a valuable adjunct in the separation of similar lichenoid oral conditions.\r"

The histology, which varies according to the stage of the disease, is characterized by an exuberant intrasinusoidal histiocytic proliferation. The present case involves a 4-year-old girl who had several episodes of upper respiratory infection and otitis media; subsequently, a walnut-sized enlargement developed in the left anterior portion of the neck. Results of a physical examination were essentially normal. A laboratory work-up was noncontributory. Serologic tests for toxoplasmosis, infectious mononucleosis, and cat-scratch disease were negative. Immunoelectrophoresis disclosed normal values for IgG, IgM, IgA, and IgE. The histopathology was characteristic of SHML. The lymph node demonstrated pericapsular and capsular fibrosis and widely dilated subcapsular, trabecular, and medullary sinuses packed with histiocytes and plasma cells. \"Lymphophagocytosis\" and large atypical histiocytes resembling Reed-Sternberg cells were noted. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated a polyclonal population of plasma cells mostly stained with rabbit anti-human igG. The cytoplasm of the histiocytes, having ingested lymphocytes, was positively stained for IgG. Other groups of lymph nodes were affected during the next several months. The patient's condition has now been followed for 2 years, and the lymphadenopathy has almost completely regressed. The site distribution of the head and neck extranodal manifestations of SHML was analyzed in 54 cases.\r"

Butorphanol was significantly superior to meperidine with respect to the diazepam dose required to achieve the target level of sedation, the total diazepam dose administered, the clinical level of sedation, the surgeon's overall evaluations of effectiveness and of sedation level, and several patient evaluation parameters measured at discharge from the recovery room and at follow-up interview.

Diuresis-enhanced renography is diagnostic in nonobstructed systems (spontaneous excretion of the radioisotope before the injection of furosemide) or unequivocally obstructed systems (no excretion of the radioisotope after injection of furosemide). 3. If the results of diuresis-enhanced renography are equivocal, a patient should be evaluated by pressure flow studies before surgical correction is undertaken or a diagnosis of no obstruction. 4. Diuresis-enhanced renography is extremely useful in followup and in evaluating surgical results.\r"

  ".U": "88015290\r", 
  ".W": "Although much remains to be learned, most pediatric nephrologists and urologists are now in comfortable agreement with the following assumptions: (1) Most reflux (primary reflux) is due to a congenital anatomic abnormality of the bladder trigone. (2) In many instances this anomaly improves with growth and development of the child so that the reflux may cease spontaneously. In low-grade (I-II) reflux with undilated ureters, approximately 75 to 85 per cent will stop refluxing. In higher grades (III-V) with dilated ureters, the cessation rate is in the range of only 25-30 per cent. (3) Although radiologic grading is helpful in predicting the likelihood of spontaneous cessation, it is possible to improve that predictability by cystoscopic evaluation of the size, configuration, and position of the ureteral orifice plus the length of the submucosal tunnel. (4) Reflux in combination with bacteriuria can and does lead to renal scarring. (5) Renal scarring probably does not occur in patients with primary reflux and normal voiding pressures in the absence of bacteriuria. (6) Renal growth may proceed normally despite sterile reflux. (7) A few refluxing patients, perhaps 10 per cent, will have bacteriuria despite continuous antimicrobials, and these \"breakthrough\" infections may cause renal scars. (8) Other patients prove either unwilling or unable to comply with continuous medications and are also vulnerable to scars. (9) A successful antireflux operation may not change the recurrence rate of urinary tract infections per se, but it almost eliminates the likelihood of pyelonephritic episodes and the necessity for further continuous antibiotics. Unfortunately, in patients with intermediate grades of reflux, it is not presently known whether an early surgical correction might be more effective in allowing normal renal growth, in avoiding renal scars, and in preventing eventual hypertension, which is present as a late complication in almost 20 per cent of the patients. The data to answer this important question should ultimately be forthcoming from the current International Collaborative Reflux Study.\r"

  ".W": "Although much time, effort, and money have been expended in the area of fetal surgery and even though considerable unfortunate media publicity has resulted, the actual clinical problem is not one of great magnitude. Currently all those interested in this area agree that consideration of any intrauterine manipulation or surgery should be reserved for a fetus who has bilateral involvement that is progressive, destructive, and associated with oligohydramnios. Except for rare instances, this eliminates all fetuses except those with some type of urethral obstruction. Significant urethral obstruction accounts for approximately 10 per cent of all patients who have a prenatal diagnosis of a urologic abnormality. Of this 10 per cent, some will not be progressive, some will not be destructive, some will not involve both kidneys, and some will not develop oligohydramnios. Some of these patients will be diagnosed early enough in pregnancy to allow termination of the pregnancy if the involvement is significant and if termination is acceptable to the family. Some will be diagnosed late enough in pregnancy so that if the lungs are mature or can be stimulated to mature, early delivery and postnatal management can be elected. Some will have other associated lethal anomalies that can be diagnosed and would preclude any consideration of intrauterine manipulation or therapy. Some will have irreversible renal failure. Occasionally, the mother may refuse any proposed intrauterine therapy. Thus we are probably considering, on a theoretic basis, well under 1 per cent of all fetuses who have a prenatal diagnosis of urologic abnormalities. There may be some unusual situations that justify intrauterine manipulation. One that we encountered involved a fetus with an abdominal mass so large that a cesarean section was deemed necessary (Figs. 12 and 13). Aspiration of the mass just before delivery was performed to allow a vaginal delivery. Another case involved a pregnant woman who developed severe toxemia. The fetus was found to have a solitary renal cyst. Repeated aspirations of the cyst resulted in resolution of the toxemia, which promptly recurred when fluid reaccumulated in the fetal renal cyst. Insertion of a double-universe catheter from the cyst into the amniotic cavity allowed completion of the pregnancy, with the delivery of an otherwise normal fetus without recurrence of the toxemia. A recent report on fetal surgery from the International Fetal Surgery Registry, coauthored by the strongest advocate of intrauterine intervention, reached these conclusions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Patients with this anomaly have a high incidence of prematurity (70%), malrotation (54%), short gut syndrome (74%), multiple atresias (15%), complications (63%), and mortality (54%). Mortality has decreased from 63% to 47% since 1970. We report three new cases of apple peel jejunal atresia, including two from one family. Radiographic evidence of high small bowel obstruction and a malrotated microcolon on preoperative roentgenogram with barium enema should suggest this diagnosis. Five families, including ours, have been reported in which more than one child was affected, and it has been suggested that this disorder is transmitted by an autosomal recessive gene. However, the occurrence of conventional intestinal atresia in other siblings, the association with multiple atresias, and discordance in a set of apparently monozygotic twins indicate that there may be a more complex spectrum of genetic transmission. Subsequent siblings are at increased risk for apple peel atresia or related malformations. Prenatal ultrasound can facilitate early diagnosis and treatment.\r"

On the 48th day after the transplantation, he died of an intraventricular and intracerebral hemorrhage caused by an Aspergillus brain abscess. We conclude that certain patients with cystic fibrosis may be appropriate candidates for liver transplantation, but their pre- and post-operative management may need to differ from other liver transplant recipients.\r"

These procedures are driven by the dual interests of pursuing the truth and protecting the constitutional rights of the accused to a fair trial with a presumption of innocence. Proposals for judicial reforms designed to balance both interests while shielding children from potential adverse effects of the process are discussed.\r"

  ".U": "88016178\r", 
  ".W": "Ultraviolet light (UV) inhibits DNA replication in Eschericia coli and induces the SOS response, a set of survival-enhancing phenotypes due to derepression of DNA damage-inducible genes, including recA and umuDC. Recovery of DNA synthesis after UV irradiation (\"induced replisome reactivation,\" or IRR) is an SOS function requiring RecA protein and postirradiation synthesis of additional protein(s), but this recovery does not require UmuDC protein [Khidhir, M. A., Casaregola, S. & Holland, I. B. (1985) Mol. Gen. Genet. 199, 133-140]. IRR occurs in strains carrying either recA718 (which does not reduce recombination, SOS inducibility, or UV mutagenesis) or umuC36 (which eliminates UV mutability), but not in recA718 umuC36 double mutants. In recA430 mutant strains, IRR does not occur whether or not functional UmuDC protein is present. IRR occurs in lexA-(Ind-) (SOS noninducible) strains if they carry an operator-constitutive recA allele and are allowed to synthesize proteins after irradiation. We conclude the following: (i) that UmuDC protein corrects or complements a defect in the ability of RecA718 protein (but not of RecA430 protein) to promote IRR and (ii) that in lexA(Ind-) mutant strains, IRR requires amplification of RecA+ protein (but not of any other LexA-repressed protein) plus post-UV synthesis of at least one other protein not controlled by LexA protein. We discuss the results in relation to the essential, but unidentified, roles of RecA and UmuDC proteins in UV mutagenesis.\r"

The breakage and rejoining of partners during this recombination process must be highly concerted because it has not been possible to detect intermediates of the reaction with wild-type Cre. Several mutant Cre proteins have been isolated that produce significant amounts of a possible intermediate product of the recombination reaction. The product has been identified as a Holliday structure in which one set of the DNA strands of the recombining partners has been exchanged. Wild-type Cre protein is capable of acting on this structure to form recombinant products, which is consistent with this being an intermediate in the recombination reaction. Characterization of the Holliday structure indicated that one set of strands in the recombining partners was always exchanged preferentially before the other set. In addition, it has been found that certain Cre mutants that are unable to carry out recombination in vitro are able to resolve the intermediate. This suggests that these mutants are defective in a step in the reaction that precedes the formation of the Holliday intermediate.\r"

  ".W": "The recognition of foreign antigen by T lymphocytes requires direct contact with cells expressing the antigen. It has recently become clear that T lymphocytes can form conjugates with other cells in the absence of foreign antigen expression. Studies using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to inhibit conjugate formation have suggested that a portion of the antigen-dependent adhesion is mediated by T lymphocytes interacting with cells expressing lymphocyte-function-associated antigen 3 (LFA-3), a widely distributed cell surface protein. We have investigated antigen-independent adhesion by incorporating affinity-purified LFA-3 into the lipid membrane of an artificial target cell (ATC; a nylon-matrix vesicle with a lipid membrane). These vesicles are similar in size and density to intact cells, so that conjugates between cells and ATCs may be seen by light microscopy. ATCs expressing a density of LFA-3 similar to that on intact cells were found to form conjugates with T cells, but only if the T cells expressed the sheep erythrocyte receptor, CD2 (T11; LFA-2). Previous studies using mAbs have implicated the CD2 molecule in both adhesion and T-cell activation. ATCs prepared without surface protein or with purified HLA class I protein failed to interact with the CD2-positive T cells, indicating that the adhesion found was mediated by the LFA-3 molecule. Furthermore, mAb against LFA-3 or CD2 was able to block the LFA-3-mediated vesicle-cell interaction, whereas mAb against LFA-1 or HLA failed to inhibit the interaction. These results provide direct evidence that LFA-3 functions as an adhesion molecule by serving as a ligand for the CD2 molecule on T cells.\r"

Despite the expression of structurally normal CD3/Ti complexes, one such mutant (J.CaM1) fails to exhibit inositolphospholipid metabolism or Ca2+ mobilization in response to anti-CD3 or anti-Ti monoclonal antibodies and fails to produce lymphokines in response to these antibodies. Surprisingly, anti-Ti antibody retains its effectiveness as a stimulus for the down-regulation of CD3/Ti surface expression. These cells remain responsive to AIF-4, at least one anti-CD3 antibody, and some combinations of nonagonist anti-Ti and anti-CD3 antibodies. The mutation in J.CaM1 appears to lie in a proximal component of the signal-transduction apparatus.\r"

The antibody reacts with a stage- and species-specific determinant located on the surface of the infective-stage larva, as determined by indirect immunofluorescence. To use this reagent in epidemiological field studies, we developed an enzyme-linked immunoassay with which B. malayi larvae can be differentiated from other filarial parasites in mosquito vectors, including the morphologically indistinguishable parasite of animals Brugia pahangi. The immunoenzyme assay was 91-94% specific and 90-97% sensitive when performed on infected mosquitoes. In the absence of mosquito tissue, the levels of specificity and sensitivity increased to 100% and 97.5-100%, respectively. Binding of antibody to the surface of living larvae was abrogated by treatment of the worms with the enzymes pronase and proteinase K and with the detergents Triton X-100, octyl beta-D-glucopyranoside, and 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulphonate (CHAPS). In contrast, treatment with trypsin, endoglycosidase-F, O-Glycanase, N-Glycanase, lipase, various phospholipases, boiling, 2-mercaptoethanol at 37 degrees C, or periodate did not reduce the antigenicity of the larval surface to antibody NEB-D1E5. These results suggest that the species-specific epitope is a peptide domain attached to a hydrophobic anchoring residue.\r"

Results on 28 patients indicate that 50% had pain or symptom relief, or both, after an average of eight treatments. Those patients who were unresponsive to treatment had a primary diagnosis of irritable colon or were postsurgical. We are continuing to examine this treatment and will conduct follow-up examinations on those patients who obtained pain relief. Based on these preliminary results, we believe that HVPGS is an effective treatment for selected patients in this population.\r"

We report the development and clinical application of a composite grafting technique in which allogeneic skin is the source of dermis, and cultured autologous keratinocytes generate epidermis. Excised burn wounds are resurfaced with unmatched allograft. Immunosuppression from the burn and reduced immunoreactivity of the allograft permit successful allograft engraftment. Keratinocyte cultures are initiated from the patient. Allogeneic epidermis is removed, and the dermal bed is resurfaced with keratinocyte cultures. The allogeneic dermis promotes rapid (less than 7 days) stratification, maturation, and integration of the cultures and the synthesis of anchoring fibrils. One case followed 11 months has shown no evidence of rejection. We reason that removal of the epidermis from allograft eliminates the majority of cells constitutively expressing alloclass II antigens, leaving behind a viable allogeneic dermal bed that serves as an ideal substrate for engraftment and integration of keratinocyte cultures but does not initiate rejection.\r"

Gradual withdrawal of steroids in these patients returning to maintenance dialysis therapy was achieved with few symptoms of hypoadrenalism. Adrenal recovery occurred in 52 per cent of patients after three months and 71 per cent after six months. However, the plasma cortisol response to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia, studied in patients in whom adrenal recovery had been demonstrated, was impaired in 46 per cent of cases. These results indicate that corticosteroids in renal transplant recipients induce profound hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal suppression which is slow to recover. Such patients returning to maintenance dialysis are at risk of acute adrenocortical insufficiency for several months. Although withdrawal of steroids can be achieved safely, cover during periods of stress should be given until the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis has been shown to respond normally.\r"

However, recent evidence suggests that this is not the case and that biliary cholesterol has other functions. The functions consist of a mucosal protective effect against the toxic action of bile-salts and also a role in regulating dietary cholesterol absorption. Biliary cholesterol is clearly more than just an excretory substance and serves other important physiological roles.\r"

  ".W": "We have looked at the outcome of pregnancy in women with type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus who were confined at Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital between 1971 and 1984. Of 134 pregnancies, 123 proceeded beyond 28 weeks' gestation and yielded 125 live infants. The perinatal mortality rate was 16/1000, due solely to congenital foetal malformation. Malformations were not related either to the severity of maternal diabetes (as graded by the White classification) or the glycaemic control in the first trimester (as judged by maternal glycosylated haemoglobin concentration). Over the period of study, there has been a marked reduction in the frequency of ketoacidosis during pregnancy and in the delivery of small-for-dates babies; more mature lecithin:sphingomyelin ratios have been obtained by amniocentesis; and better Apgar scores have been demonstrated in the infants at delivery. The Caesarean section rate has fallen from 83 to 30 per cent, and babies now spend less time separated from their mothers in paediatric units. These improvements largely reflect better diabetic treatment (improved insulin regimens and glycaemic control) and closer obstetric assessment. Foetal malformation occurred overall in 11.4 per cent of pregnancies and did not become less frequent over the period of study. Further major improvement in the outcome of diabetic pregnancy will only come from a reduction in the congenital malformation rate, which implies better diabetic control at and around the time of conception.\r"

Of these hypotheses two seem more impressive: (i) the neurological manifestations may be explained by a deficiency of haem in neural tissues; (ii) the porphyrin precursor 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) may have in addition specific pharmacological activity.\r"

In 814 episodes (93 per cent) a single organism was isolated, most commonly Escherichia coli (27.4 per cent), other enterobacteria (14.4 per cent), Staphylococcus aureus (11.2 per cent), Streptococcus pneumoniae (9.0 per cent), or Haemophilus influenzae (6.4 per cent). In 61 cases (7.0 per cent) bacteraemia was due to two or more species. In almost 60 per cent of cases, bacteraemia was considered to be community-acquired. The most common sources were the urinary (26.9 per cent), respiratory (14.6 per cent), gastrointestinal (11.6 per cent) and biliary (9.5 per cent) tracts, but in almost 10 per cent of cases the focus of infection was unknown. Polymicrobial bacteraemia was common when the biliary tract was the focus of infection. Shock was recorded in 19.5 per cent of cases, and was commoner in polymicrobial (42.9 per cent) than in monomicrobial (17.4 per cent) episodes. In monomicrobial episodes haemolytic streptococci were associated with the highest incidence of shock (30.0 per cent). Mortality directly related to bacteraemia (19.5 per cent) was higher with Gram-positive (23.5 per cent) than with Gram-negative (15.8 per cent) organisms; in polymicrobial (31.1 per cent) than in monomicrobial episodes (18.7 per cent); and in those who had multiple episodes (34.7 per cent) than in those who had a single episode of bacteraemia (20.3 per cent). Other factors influencing mortality included shock, failure to mount an adequate febrile response, leucopenia or granulocytopenia, and underlying disease. Mortality was markedly reduced by appropriate treatment; a single antimicrobial agent was as effective as combination therapy in bacteraemia caused by Gram-negative bacilli.\r"

  ".W": "The great success of recombinant DNA technology in unravelling the pathology of the thalassaemias at a molecular level has encouraged the application of these methods to other single gene disorders of man in the hope of gaining a deeper insight into the biochemical defects underlying them. An example of this approach is provided by the sex-linked recessive disorders of blood clotting: haemophilia and Christmas disease. These clinically indistinguishable, life-long disorders result from the deficiency or abnormality of the clotting proteins factor VIII and factor IX, respectively, which both participate in the activation of factor X in the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation. This paper looks at the information concerning the molecular biology and pathology of the haemophilias which has recently been forthcoming. The genes for factor VIII and factor IX have both been successfully cloned within the past five years, with that of factor VIII, achieved in 1984, being a particular tour de force. It encompasses 0.1 per cent of the human X chromosome and is the largest gene yet characterised. Gene cloning is the starting point from which gene probes can be designed to elucidate the molecular pathology of the haemophilias. The implications of these discoveries for the practice of clinical medicine are reviewed, with special emphasis on prenatal diagnosis and carrier detection by means of restriction fragment length polymorphisms, and replacement therapy with recombinant factor VIII.\r"

In most of the other patients, portal hypertension was the predominant and often the presenting symptom of hepatic sarcoidosis; in these patients portal hypertension was due to a presinusoidal block probably determined by portal granulomas, with or without superimposed sinusoidal block determined by fibrosis. Corticosteroids did not prevent the development of portal hypertension.\r"

The new combination reduced exposure by 50%, but it failed to equal the other combination in the depiction of simulated microcalcifications, even when a different brand of film-processing chemicals was used. Compared with the standard screen-film combination exposed without a grid, the new combination exposed with a grid resulted in a superior image of dense parenchyma without an increase in dose. Furthermore, when the exposure time was decreased by 25% (rather than 50%), dense breasts were imaged with greater penetration by the new combination. A clinical trial of the new combination in 200 patients showed prominent quantum mottle and reduced contrast in regions of dense parenchyma. In addition, the skin and subcutaneous tissue were often poorly depicted with both standard and high-intensity illumination.\r"

The sensitivity of MR imaging for detecting individual metastatic deposits was 64%, significantly greater than 51% for CT (P less than .001); the difference in sensitivity for identifying patients with one or more hepatic metastases was less (82% for MR imaging vs. 80% for CT). In patients without hepatic metastases, the specificity of MR imaging was 99% versus 94% for CT. Significant differences were found between individual MR pulse sequences in detection of individual lesions. The sensitivity of both T1-weighted spin-echo (SE) (64%) and inversion-recovery (IR) (65%) pulse sequences was significantly (P less than .001) greater than either the TE (echo time) 60 msec (43%) or TE 120 msec (43%) T2-weighted pulse sequences.

Nine calculi in five kidneys could not be fragmented with lithotripsy. Of 895 patients with calculi less than 2.5 cm in diameter, only 13 (1.5%) required interventional procedures to clear the calculi, whereas of 161 patients with calculi greater than or equal to 2.5 cm, 36 (22.4%) required nephrostomies. A column of calculous debris in the mid and distal portions of the ureter (steinstrasse) was seen in 171 instances (13.6%) after lithotripsy; 62% required interventions. The most common intervention required for successful lithotripsy was retrograde ureteral catheterization. Evaluation and treatment of patients with urolithiasis were largely dependent on radiography and excretory urography.\r"

Correlation with the serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level may be helpful since levels exceeding 100,000 IU/L are strongly suggestive of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. However, low hCG levels may also be found in the presence of this disease. The authors studied six patients who were suspected of having gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. Three of the six proved to have incomplete abortions or molar degeneration. Doppler ultrasound (US) was used to record the signal in the uterine arteries of these patients. The signals were compared with those of three nongravid volunteers and three patients in the first trimester of pregnancy. Analysis of the signals in the uterine artery showed higher systolic and diastolic Doppler shifts in gestational trophoblastic neoplasia when compared with postabortal, gravid, and nongravid signals. These preliminary results indicate that Doppler US has the potential to be clinically useful in the diagnosis of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia.\r"

  ".W": "To differentiate pregnancies complicated by oligohydramnios due to intrauterine growth retardation from those due to renal agenesis, the authors administered furosemide intravenously to eight pregnant women (19-25 weeks gestation) with oligohydramnios. The fetal abdomen was scanned with ultrasound to demonstrate the fetal urinary bladder. In six fetuses, sonography failed to demonstrate the bladder: two fetuses had growth retardation with normal kidneys and bladder, and four had renal anomalies. It is concluded that administration of furosemide to the mother fails to induce diuresis in growth-retarded fetuses of 19-23 weeks gestation and that failure to see the fetal bladder after furosemide administration does not necessarily indicate absent fetal kidneys.\r"

Second-trimester polyhydramnios often (62%) persisted into the third trimester. The frequencies of maternal (25%) and fetal (12%) conditions were similar to those previously reported for third-trimester polyhydramnios. Fetal anomalies were always identified on the sonogram that initially demonstrated polyhydramnios. Fetal outcome was excellent in the nondiabetic patient with polyhydramnios in whom no fetal abnormalities were detected on sonograms. In polyhydramnios associated with maternal diabetes mellitus, however, the pregnancy was often (71%) complicated by premature labor or macrosomia. In such patients serial sonographic follow-up is indicated.\r"

Between 7 and 25 days after the initial hemorrhagic episode, however, diffuse, low-level echogenicity appeared in the ventricles of 34 patients. The low-level echogenicity was transient and persisted for 7-59 days (average, 18 days). In 32 patients, low-level echogenicity was a benign finding associated with prior intraventricular hemorrhage. In two patients, the low-level echogenicity was associated with ventriculitis. Low-level echogenicity appeared, increased, then cleared, but reappeared with the onset of ventriculitis in these two patients. Thickening of the ependyma and abnormal periventricular echogenicity, signs of inflammation, were also present. Although low-level echogenicity may commonly be a benign finding, the possibility of ventriculitis should not be ignored.\r"

This region is determined by the mode of separation and the amino acid distribution within the polypeptide. The contact area may be as small as a few hundred square angstroms in bioaffinity chromatography. In contrast, the contact region in ion exchange, reversed phase, hydrophobic interaction and the other nonbioaffinity separation modes is much broader, ranging from one side to the whole external surface of a polypeptide. Furthermore, structural changes that alter the chromatographic contact region will alter chromatographic properties. Thus, although immunosorbents can be very useful in purifying proteins of similar primary structure, they will be ineffective in discriminating between small, random variations within a structure. Nonbioaffinity columns complement affinity columns in probing a much larger portion of solute surface and being able to discriminate between protein variants.\r"

  ".W": "Rapid progress has been made in the understanding of the molecular interactions that result in cell adhesion. Many adhesive proteins present in extracellular matrices and in the blood contain the tripeptide arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) as their cell recognition site. These proteins include fibronectin, vitronectin, osteopontin, collagens, thrombospondin, fibrinogen, and von Willebrand factor. The RGD sequences of each of the adhesive proteins are recognized by at least one member of a family of structurally related receptors, integrins, which are heterodimeric proteins with two membrane-spanning subunits. Some of these receptors bind to the RGD sequence of a single adhesion protein only, whereas others recognize groups of them. The conformation of the RGD sequence in the individual proteins may be critical to this recognition specificity. On the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, the receptors connect the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton. More than ten proved or suspected RGD-containing adhesion-promoting proteins have already been identified, and the integrin family includes at least as many receptors recognizing these proteins. Together, the adhesion proteins and their receptors constitute a versatile recognition system providing cells with anchorage, traction for migration, and signals for polarity, position, differentiation, and possibly growth.\r"

  ".W": "The DNA double helix is not a regular, featureless barberpole molecule. Different base sequences have their own special signature, in the way that they influence groove width, helical twist, bending, and mechanical rigidity or resistance to bending. These special features probably help other molecules such as repressors to read and recognize one base sequence in preference to another. Single crystal x-ray structure analysis is beginning to show us the various structures possible in the B-DNA family. The DNA decamer C-C-A-A-G-A-T-T-G-G appears to be a better model for mixed-sequence B-DNA than was the earlier C-G-C-G-A-A-T-T-C-G-C-G, which is more akin to regions of poly(dA).poly(dT). The G.A mismatch base pairs at the center of the decamer are in the anti-anti conformation about their bonds from base to sugar, in agreement with nuclear magnetic resonance evidence on this and other sequences, and in contrast to the anti-syn geometry reported for G.A pairs in C-G-C-G-A-A-T-T-A-G-C-G. The ordered spine of hydration seen earlier in the narrow-grooved dodecamer has its counterpart, in this wide-grooved decamer, in two strings of water molecules lining the walls of the minor groove, bridging from purine N3 or pyrimidine O2, to the following sugar O4'. The same strings of hydration are present in the phosphorothioate analog of G-C-G-C-G-C. Unlike the spine, which is broken up by the intrusion of amine groups at guanines, these water strings are found in general, mixed-sequence DNA because they can pass by unimpeded to either side of a guanine N2 amine. The spine and strings are perceived as two extremes of a general pattern of hydration of the minor groove, which probably is the dominant factor in making B-DNA the preferred form at high hydration.\r"

  ".U": "88018034\r", 
  ".W": "There is now evidence that the immune system, during times of infectious challenge, can stimulate the secretion of glucocorticoids, the adrenal steroids that mediate important aspects of the response to stress. Specifically, secretion of interleukin-1 (IL-1), a monocyte lymphokine secreted after infection, appears at least in part responsible for this effect. Glucocorticoids are secreted in response to a neuroendocrine cascade involving, first, the brain, then the pituitary, and finally the adrenal gland. In this report, human IL-1 is shown to activate the adrenocortical axis at the level of the brain, stimulating the release of the controlling hormone corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) from the hypothalamus. Infusion of IL-1 induced a significant secretion of CRF into the circulation exiting the hypothalamus, whereas immunoneutralization of CRF blocked the stimulatory effect of IL-1 on glucocorticoid secretion. IL-1 appeared to have no acute direct stimulatory effects on the pituitary or adrenal components of this system. Furthermore, IL-1 did not cause a nonspecific release of other hypothalamic hormones. Thus, the lymphokine acts in a specific manner to activate the adrenocortical axis at the level of the brain; this effect appears to be unrelated to the known pyrogenic effects of IL-1 within the hypothalamus.\r"

The route by which IL-1 affects pituitary-adrenal activity is unknown. That the IL-1-induced pituitary-adrenal activation involves an increased secretion of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is indicated by three lines of evidence. First, immunoneutralization of CRF markedly attenuated the IL-1-induced increase of ACTH blood levels. Second, after blockade of fast axonal transport in hypothalamic neurons by colchicine, IL-1 administration decreased the CRF immunostaining in the median eminence, indicating an enhanced release of CRF in response to IL-1. Third, IL-1 did not stimulate ACTH release from primary cultures of anterior pituitary cells. These data further support the notion of the existence of an immunoregulatory feedback circuit between the immune system and the brain.\r"

Transient expression of the active peptide product specifically inhibited the cAMP-stimulated expression of a cotransfected reporter gene by more than 90 percent, whereas the expression of the inactive peptide did not alter cAMP-stimulated gene expression.

These proteins acquire transforming properties as a result of activating lesions that convert ras genes to oncogenes in a wide array of malignancies. In Xenopus laevis oocytes, microinjection of transforming ras p21 is a potent inducer of maturation, whereas microinjection of a monoclonal antibody to ras p21 inhibits normal maturation induced by hormones. The phosphoinositide pathway is a ubiquitous system that appears to play a key role in diverse cellular functions. By use of the Xenopus oocyte system, it was possible to quantitate the effects of ras p21 microinjection on individual components of the phosphoinositide pathway. Within 20 minutes of microinjection, levels of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, inositol 1-phosphate, and inositol bisphosphate increased 1.5- to 2-fold. The most striking effects were on diacylglycerol, which increased 5-fold under the same conditions. In contrast, the normal ras p21 protein induced no detectable alteration in any of the metabolites analyzed. The earliest effects of the transforming p21 on phosphoinositol turnover were observable within 2 minutes, implying a very rapid effect of ras p21 on the enzymes involved in phospholipid metabolism.\r"

Both mutant proteins were found to be associated with guanosine triphosphate (GTP) in vivo.

A cytoplasmic protein was shown to be responsible for this increase in activity. This protein stimulated GTP hydrolysis by purified Gly12 p21 more than 200-fold in vitro, but had no effect on Asp12 or Val12 mutants. A similar factor could be detected in extracts from mammalian cells. It thus appears that, in Xenopus oocytes, this protein maintains normal p21 in a biologically inactive, GDP-bound state through its effect on GTPase activity. Furthermore, it appears that the major effect of position 12 mutations is to prevent this protein from stimulating p21 GTPase activity, thereby allowing these mutants to remain in the active GTP-bound state.\r"

Various biochemical and endocrinologic parameters were studied, with special emphasis on plasma aldosterone and urinary aldosterone. At the same time, a control group of 30 normal subjects (nonhypertensive) were studied under the same conditions. Both groups were carefully selected. Results indicated that the hypertensive group demonstrated a marked increase in plasma aldosterone levels (P less than .01) and an increase in the coefficient of plasma aldosterone/plasma renin activity (P less than .01). This indicates inadequate secretion of plasma aldosterone. There were no significant changes in the urinary aldosterone. Statistically significant changes were found in plasma renin activity (P less than .001) and plasma aldosterone (P less than .001) when the hypertensive patients were divided into two age groups, those under 45 and those over 45. These changes were not found in the normal subjects in the same age groups, indicating that age is an important influence on the renin-aldosterone system in hypertensive patients, and leads to variations in this hormonal axis similar to those observed in normal elderly subjects.\r"

We studied 168 consecutive patients retrospectively; 33 were men and 135 women, with an average age of 34 (range 27 to 41) years. All patients had a gastric bypass because of obesity, with a minimum of 100 lb over normal weight. The mean weight was 279.2 lb (range 191 to 500). Only three patients had a history of deep vein thrombophlebitis, with no thromboembolism. Eighty-four of the patients were studied preoperatively by noninvasive means (Doppler, impedance plethysmography [IPG], phleborheography [PRG]); 12 had evidence of old disease, and two had a history of treated deep vein thrombophlebitis. No patient had prophylactic therapy. The incidence of clinical deep vein thrombophlebitis was zero; noninvasive evaluation in 64 patients demonstrated no abnormality. Postoperative thromboembolism, which occurred in three of 168 (1.8%) patients, was confirmed by ventilation-perfusion scan and pulmonary angiogram. The mortality from thromboembolism was less than 1% (1/168 patients). Extreme obesity may not necessarily constitute a major risk factor in the occurrence of postoperative deep vein thrombophlebitis and thromboembolism. Prophylactic medications and therapy may add inappropriate risk, undue cost, and unnecessary discomfort, and must be weighed against a mortality of less than 1%.\r"

  ".W": "The association of hypercoagulation and cancer, a well established pattern of disease, often leads to pulmonary emboli in an already compromised patient. Anticoagulation therapy in these patients is occasionally complicated by several factors including thrombocytopenia, which may result in a life-threatening situation of hemorrhage versus pulmonary emboli. Mechanical intervention may prevent pulmonary emboli from reaching the lungs, thereby negating the use of anticoagulants in the patient with thrombocytopenia. In this clinical trial, ten patients with cancer and thrombocytopenia complicated by recurrent pulmonary emboli received the Kim-Ray Greenfield filter. There were four men (two with colon carcinoma and two with chronic lymphocytic leukemia) and six women (four with breast carcinoma, one with colon carcinoma, and one with chronic lymphocytic leukemia). Pulmonary emboli were documented in all patients by comparative ventilation/perfusion lung scans, arterial blood gas determinations, and chest x-ray films. In each case anticoagulation was begun, but in six of the ten patients hemorrhage developed and anticoagulation had to be discontinued. The Kim-Ray Greenfield filter was subsequently placed in all ten patients in the infrarenal inferior vena cava (eight via a jugular approach and two via the femoral vein) without complication, and anticoagulation was discontinued. All patients had follow-up to time of death, ranging from six to 26 months (mean 11 months). In no patient was recurrent pulmonary emboli detectable based on clinical evidence, nor in autopsy reports in three of the ten patients. There should be increased usage of the Kim-Ray Greenfield filter in patients with malignancy, thrombocytopenia, and pulmonary emboli.\r"

However, elderly, septic, patients with jaundice have a high incidence of renal problems. For this reason, amingolycoside treatment of these patients must be reevaluated as newer less nephrotoxic agents become available. We, therefore, performed a prospective, randomized trial of ampicillin plus tobramycin, cefoperazone and piperacillin in patients with biliary tract infections. During a 20 month period, 106 patients with acute cholecystitis (53) or cholangitis (53), or both, received one of these antibiotic regimens for a minimum of five days. In patients with acute cholecystitis, ampicillin plus tobramycin, cefoperazone and piperacillin had clinical cure rates of 85, 95 and 95 per cent, respectively. In patients with cholangitis, however, cure rates for the three regimens were 85, 56 (p less than 0.05 versus ampicillin plus tobramycin) and 60 per cent (not significant versus ampicillin plus tobramycin), respectively. Moreover, 13 per cent of the patients receiving cefoperazone had an increased prothrombin time and three of 39 patients receiving this antibiotic had clinical problems with bleeding. Nephrotoxicity was greatest in patients with cholangitis receiving ampicillin plus tobramycin, 10 per cent, as compared with 3 per cent in those who did not receive an aminoglycoside. This difference, however, was not statistically significant. It was concluded that piperacillin should be considered for antibiotic management of patients with acute cholecystitis and that further studies are necessary in patients with cholangitis to determine whether or not newer agents should replace penicillin and aminoglycoside combinations.\r"

Most patients presented in a state of shock. Twenty-nine were bleeding too rapidly to resuscitate adequately and required emergency operation while in a moribund state. Twenty-five had arteriovenous fistulas and were hemodynamically stable. Direct venous repair was attempted if simple lateral suture or end to end anastomosis could be rapidly done. If complex repairs were required, ligation was performed. Fifty-five veins were ligated on this basis, including 14 brachiocephalic trunks, nine proximal subclavian veins and one superior vena cava cephalad to the azygos. Nineteen were repaired. Two patients died after ligation and one patient after repair, all as a result of the effects of massive hypovolemia. Edema of the upper limb developed in two patients in each treatment group in whom the distal part of the subclavian vein had been involved. The edema resolved within five to seven days. Chronic venous stasis problems did not develop in any patient during the two to 26 month follow-up period.\r"

A scalpel was used in 96 patients in group 1 and CO2 laser beam was used in 123 patients in group 2. The average length of hospitalization for group 2 was longer (16.3 versus 12.8 days for group 1). This was due to failure of the skin graft; 32.5 per cent in group 2 versus 15.6 per cent in group 1 (p = 0.005). The accumulative rate of recurrence for both groups was almost the same although there were significant differences according to the various parameters. Male patients in group 2 had a significantly higher rate of recurrence as compared with female patients in the same group (p less than 0.001) and male patients in group 1 (p = 0.002). In both groups, there was a significantly higher rate of recurrence for ulcerated primary lesions and those lesions more than 1.6 millimeters thick (p = 0.05). Patients in group 2, with lesions more than 3 millimeters in thickness, had a higher rate of recurrence than those in group 1 (54.6 versus 40.6 per cent). In both groups, patients who underwent elective regional dissection of lymph nodes had a lower rate of recurrence (19.4 per cent) than those patients who did not undergo dissection (53.6 per cent) (p = 0.001). It is suggested that thermal damage to the blood and lymph vessels incurred during laser excision may be more extensive than has been reported. These damaged walls may cause the higher rate of distal metastases of malignant melanoma from a primary lesion more than 1.6 millimeters in thickness; primarily in male patients.\r"

It is frequently a self-limiting disorder of intestinal function associated with reversible mucosal changes of the intestine. The prevalence of chronic radiation enteritis has been underestimated in most surgical series and the majority of patients with symptoms probably do not seek medical advice until a serious complication occurs. Although associated with specific histologic features, the mechanism of chronic radiation injury is poorly understood. The prevalence, pathogenesis, diagnosis and approaches to the treatment and prevention of acute and chronic radiation enteritis are discussed herein. Recent investigative techniques should lead to a better understanding of the physiopathologic characteristics of radiation enteritis and, thereby, provide a more rational basis for treatment which, at the present time, is unsatisfactory. Attempts to reduce the prevalence of radiation enteritis should be directed toward careful patient selection for radiation treatment of the pelvis and to minimize injury to the small intestine, by reducing the volume of small intestine in the radiation area and providing more individualized dosimetry.\r"

Theories to explain the patterns of color vision impairment found in acquired diseases (for example, preferential hue discrimination defects) have stressed the likelihood of selective damage to specific components of the afferent visual system (photoreceptors, ganglion cells, synaptic elements, axons etc.). More recent evidence suggests, however, that impairment of color vision by diseases of the retina and optic nerve is commonly nonspecific, and not the result of selective impairment of individual neural mechanisms responsible for mediating color vision. Rather, the patterns of acquired dyschromatopsias often appear to be related to a physiologically heterogeneous distribution of color vision in the foveal and perifoveal visual field, coupled with a tendency for the visual field defects caused by acquired diseases to be unevenly distributed in these same areas.\r"

Interestingly, it has been observed that, although the entire nerve cross-section may be involved by the nerve damage, in many instances, the superior and inferior axon bundles are preferentially affected by the pressure insult. Thus, recent studies by many investigators have stressed a re-examination of the optic nerve head anatomy, including the nerve head microcirculation, the glial and connective tissue elements within the nerve head, and the morphology of the axons themselves. Any correlation between regional differences in this anatomy and the preferential involvement by specific axon bundles within the nerve head by the pressure insult may suggest some further insight into the mechanisms underlying the pressure-induced axon loss in glaucomatous eyes.\r"

After mastectomy patients were randomized to receive either cytoxan, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) (1 year) or CMF with tamoxifen (1 year) with or without bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG). With a median follow-up of 92.1 months, 55.3% of the patients had recurrences. The first site of recurrence was local-regional for 31.4% of patients and distant for 68.6%. This pattern of first recurrence was not associated with treatment groups, menopausal status, race, estrogen receptor value, number of positive lymph nodes, or tumour diameter. Although patients with a first local-regional recurrence had a better overall prognosis compared with those with a first distant recurrence, 52.2% of those patients with an initial local-regional recurrence developed a distant recurrence within 12 months. Among patients who had a recurrence, 48.3% had a local-regional recurrence at some time during their follow-up. Conclusions from this study are (1) patterns of recurrence were not affected by the addition of antiestrogen therapy to chemotherapy; (2) for the variables tested, including number of positive nodes and tumor diameter, no association with recurrence patterns was found; and (3) most patients (52.2%) with a first local-regional recurrence will develop a distant recurrence within 1 year.\r"

Biochemical techniques (estrogen receptor analysis [ERA]) are conventionally used to determine ER; however, they have limitations and disadvantages. In this study a monoclonal antibody to ER (estrogen receptor-immunochemical assay [ERICA]) was used to detect the presence of ER on cytologic and frozen tissue specimens of breast cancers and was compared with the dextran-coated charcoal assay. One hundred two breast cancers were studied. Ninety-four specimens were studied by ERA and ERICA; in eight patients in whom tissue was insufficient for ERA, ERICA alone was performed. ERICA correlated remarkably well with ERA: 94% sensitivity, 89% specificity, and 93% accuracy. In the eight patients in whom ERA could not be performed, ERICA was successfully applied to obtain information regarding receptor status. There was uniform agreement between frozen-sectioned tissues and cytologic smears. The results suggest that immunocytochemical determination of ER is a valuable adjunct and/or alternative to the biochemical method for determination of the ER status of breast cancers.\r"

In the pancreas after cadaver kidney group, pancreas and kidney survival rates were 100% at 1 year, and in the simultaneous pancreas and kidney group, pancreas 1-year graft survival was 87.5% and kidney transplant survival was 93.8%. Overall patient survival at 1-year is 95.6%. Technical complications occurred in 21 patients. These included wound infections, intra-abdominal abscess formation, bleeding, and disruption of the pancreaticocystostomy.

  ".U": "88018513\r", 
  ".W": "Between July 1978 and February 1987, 177 pancreas transplants were performed. The 1-year patient and graft survival rates for the first 100 transplants up to October 1984 were 88% and 27%, respectively. Since November 1984, duct drainage has been used for 74 of 77 transplants, bladder (BD) in 36 and enteric (ED) in 38, with 1-year patient survival rates of 89% and 92%, respectively, and graft survival rates of 58% and 42%. The technical failure rate was similar in both groups (31%). Immunosuppression was with antilymphocyte globulin, cyclosporine, azathioprine, and prednisone. Most recipients were nonuremic, without kidney transplants, and 1-year graft survival rates were 69% for BD (n = 21) and 42% for ED (n = 29). The diagnosis of rejection was based on a decline in urine amylase activity in the BD and on an increase in plasma glucose alone in the ED group. For technically successful (TS) grafts, the number of rejection episodes reversed per number diagnosed was 23 of 26 (18 patients) in BD (88%) and six of 15 (14 patients) (40%) in ED (p less than 0.05). The advantage of BD with monitoring of urine amylase activity is seen in TS cases; 1-year cadaveric graft survival rates were 90% for BD (n = 23) versus 47% for ED (n = 15) (p = 0.05). In recipients of segmental transplants with ED from living-related donors, 1-year graft survival rates were 57% overall (n = 18) and 88% for TS cases (n = 12), which is identical to cadaveric BD cases. A disadvantage of BD was metabolic acidosis induced by chronic bicarbonate loss in the urine from the pancreas graft. Nevertheless, we conclude that BD is the preferred technique for pancreas transplants from cadaver donors because of the ability to monitor exocrine and endocrine function continuously, thus leading to early diagnosis and treatment of rejection episodes.\r"

One-year patient survival rate was 98%, and overall one-year graft survival rate was 68%. One-year graft survival rate was 73% for cyclosporine-treated patients and 78% for recipients of related donor kidneys. A subpopulation of patients affected with renal insufficiency since infancy was analyzed separately to evaluate the prognosis of these patients, who have previously been reported to be a high risk for permanent neurologic, developmental, and growth retardation. All 16 such patients underwent transplantation. Gross motor delay that was noted in 31% of patients before surgery resolved in all patients after transplantation. No evidence of severe developmental delay was noted after transplant and seven of 11 patients with successful transplants had evidence of catch-up growth. Overall renal transplantation is a safe and effective procedure for children with renal failure, and even the patients at highest risk for growth and developmental failure caused by renal insufficiency show potential for rehabilitation after transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "The major complication of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for the treatment of neonatal respiratory failure is bleeding related to heparinization. Systolic hypertension has emerged as another serious side effect in our experience. Thirty-eight of the first 41 newborns we treated with ECMO developed a systolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg. The mean hypertension index (HI blood = hours greater than 90/hr on ECMO) was 0.17 +/- 0.16. Possible biochemical mediators were assayed in 17 patients. Plasma renin activity (PRA), aldosterone, epinephrine, norepinephrine, prostaglandin E2, thromboxane, and antidiuretic hormone were elevated. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and prostacyclin were not elevated. Eighteen patients (44%) had intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), and 11 patients (27%) had clinically significant ICH. The HI was significantly (p less than 0.005) lower in those patients without ICH (0.11 +/- 0.01) than in those patients with ICH (0.25 +/- 0.04). PRA at hour 12, day 2, and day 3 was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) in patients experiencing ICH (62 +/- 42; 93 +/- 15; 73 +/- 30 ng/ml/hr) than in those without ICH (27 +/- 25; 14 +/- 8; 12 +/- 4 ng/ml/hr). An aggressive approach to medical management evolved that included hydralazine, nitroglycerine, and captopril, which protected against ICH. Two of 23 patients (9%) treated with the protocol sufferred clinically significant ICH, whereas nine of 18 patients (50%) treated before implementation of the protocol experienced ICH. The ACE inhibitor captopril was most effective in the control of hypertension. We conclude that systolic hypertension is common during neonatal ECMO, is associated with ICH, and is related to a high PRA. Aggressive management of hypertension during ECMO can reduce the incidence of ICH, and captopril is an important component of this aggressive medical management.\r"

To compare conventional carotid artery angiography and Duplex scanning, 32 consecutive patients underwent both evaluations, the results of which were compared, in a blinded manner, to the plaque characteristics noted on direct examination by the attending surgeon and pathologist. The following observations were made: angiographic and Duplex scanning evaluations concurred with direct-specimen examination for luminal narrowing in 31 of 32 patients (97%) and 30 of 32 patients (94%), respectively, whereas Duplex scanning was more accurate for diagnosing ulcerative lesions, 13 of 14 patients (93%), than angiography, five of 14 patients (36%) (p less than 0.0001). Luminal surface irregularity was accurately described by Duplex scanning in 20 of 23 patients (87%) and by angiography in 11 of 23 patients (48%) (p less than 0.005), whereas plaque morphology or consistency was not commented on with angiography but was accurately described with Duplex scanning in 12 of 12 patients (100%). This series clearly demonstrates that both angiography and Duplex scanning are extremely accurate for determining the reduction in the diameter of the carotid artery, whereas Duplex scanning is more accurate for detecting important plaque characteristics such as irregularity, ulceration, and composition.\r"

Graft material for culture was obtained from aortofemoral or femoropopliteal vascular prostheses without signs of infection but requiring revision for femoral anastomotic aneurysm (n = 21) or thrombosis (n = 26). Explanted graft material was placed in tryptic soy broth and ultrasonically oscillated to disrupt the adherent graft surface biofilm, which is a technique that increases the recovery of microorganisms compared with standard microbiologic culture methods. Microorganisms were isolated from 90% (19/21) of grafts associated with anastomotic aneurysms and 69% (18/26) of thrombosed grafts. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the prevalent organism recovered and accounted for 69% of the isolates. Slime production, a growth characteristic of S. epidermidis associated with prosthetic device infection in humans, was demonstrated by 87% (13/15) of strains isolated from grafts with pseudoaneurysms compared with 33% (4/12) of strains isolated from occluded grafts (p less than 0.01). Despite the high incidence (79%) of colonization of vascular prostheses, no patient developed wound or graft infection after graft replacement and perioperative antibiotic administration. Low-virulent microorganisms, such as S. epidermidis, can colonize vascular prostheses and not provoke signs of graft infection. The high recovery rate of slime-producing S. epidermidis strains from grafts with anastomotic aneurysms and the adherence-mediated growth of these bacteria on biomaterials suggest this late graft complication is the sequelae of a bacteria-laden biofilm infection.\r"

Subjects measured peak expiratory flow rate approximately eight hourly, before and after inhaled salbutamol, for four week periods. Paired t tests and cosinor analysis were used to assess the diurnal variation in airway calibre from the peak expiratory flow rate recorded before salbutamol and to assess the diurnal variation in bronchodilator responsiveness from the increase in peak expiratory flow rate after salbutamol. Maintenance treatment with ipratropium bromide 40 micrograms three times daily reduced the provocative dose of histamine which caused a 20% fall in FEV1 (geometric mean PD20 = 0.78 v 0.49 mg/ml, p less than 0.05), despite an eight to 12 hour gap between the last dose of ipratropium and histamine challenge. It did not, however, diminish the diurnal variation in airway calibre (mean amplitude = 12.7 v 10.1) or in bronchodilator responsiveness (mean amplitude = 62.4 v 63.5). There was no improvement in the clinical state of subjects while they were taking ipratropium bromide.\r"

The ability of human and mouse cells to phagocytose the opportunistic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus has been examined, spores of the non-pathogenic fungus Penicillium ochrochloron being used for comparison. Most spores became associated with cells. Those of A fumigatus appeared to remain bound to the surface of the phagocyte rather than being ingested; in contrast, P ochrochloron spores appeared to be phagocytosed more readily, although they also were seen, in small numbers, o n the cell surface. In view of the subjective nature of these observations, the effects of spore diffusates on phagocytosis were examined. Diffusates from spores of A fumigatus were shown to inhibit phagocytosis of antibody coated radiolabelled sheep red blood cells by primed mouse phagocytic cells. Diffusates of spores of P ochrochloron had no such effect. These results suggest that when spores of A fumigatus become bound to the surface of phagocytes they are able to release a substance that inhibits their ingestion while having little or no effect on surface binding.\r"

  ".W": "In the last three months of 1985 there was an outbreak of legionnaires' disease at Glasgow Royal Infirmary affecting 15 patients and one surgeon; five patients died. Legionnaires' disease was first suspected when a second case of severe nosocomial pneumonia occurred in a high dependency unit. The application of the direct fluorescent antibody test to specimens obtained at bronchoscopy was responsible for the rapid diagnosis of legionnaires' disease, which led to the prescription of appropriate antibiotic treatment and the shutting down of the contaminated cooling tower, thereby containing the outbreak. It also led to a search for further cases. It is suggested that these diagnostic techniques should be included in the investigation of affected patients in an outbreak of pneumonia.\r"

It was possible to estimate the relative movement of fluid within the segment during the sequential aspiration of each of these aliquots. The first 60 ml aliquot introduced stayed close to the bronchoscope and probably sampled only the proximal airways. With the introduction of cumulative volumes of 120 ml or more, the fluid filled the segment more evenly. Aspiration then moved fluid back from the periphery, implying that the aspirate had also lavaged both distal airways and alveoli.\r"

There were 49 cadaver and 7 living-related transplants. Overall patient and graft survival was 88 per cent and 66 per cent at one year, 59 per cent and 49 per cent at five years, respectively. There was no significant difference in patient or graft outcome with cadaver versus living-related donor kidneys. One-year graft success with and without pretransplant bilateral nephrectomy (BN) was 78 per cent versus 58 per cent, respectively (n.s.). Patient survival after return to dialysis after graft loss was not compromised by the earlier performance of BN. In patients who did not undergo pretransplant BN, there were no complications from the retained native kidneys after transplantation. In cadaver recipients, the two-year graft success rate with and without preliminary blood transfusions was 54 per cent versus 61 per cent, respectively (n.s.). Cadaver graft survival with and without adjunctive antilymphocyte globulin (ALG), excluding 3 recipients managed with cyclosporine, was 88 per cent versus 50 per cent at one year, and 70 per cent versus 32 per cent at five years, respectively (p less than 0.05). This beneficial effect of ALG was still evident when only transfused cadaver recipients were analyzed and was achieved with no resulting compromise in patient survival. Follow-up computerized tomography (CT) scanning of the transplant kidney in 10 recipients with a long-term (1-9 years) functioning allograft showed no evidence of recurrent ADKPKD.\r"

Two years later a mature Wilms tumor, consisting predominantly of rhabdomyomatous elements, was discovered in the right kidney. Although a second course of chemotherapy was given and 2,000 rad were delivered to the right flank, the mass continued to enlarge with progressive deterioration of renal function. A nephron-sparing procedure was performed, in which a 3,400-g tumor measuring 19 cm X 16 cm X 9 cm was enucleated from the right kidney without compromise to the remaining normal tissue. Pathologic examination of the surgical specimen revealed a mature Wilms tumor with a malignant anaplastic sarcoma arising in the central portion. Currently, he is disease-free with normal renal function more than twenty years after diagnosis of the metachronous bilateral Wilms tumor. We believe he is the longest known surviving metachronous Wilms tumor patient and emphasizes the importance of conservative, meticulous surgery in the management of both unilateral and bilateral Wilms tumors. The role of multimodal therapy (chemotherapy, irradiation, and surgery) as well as the current guidelines for the management of bilateral Wilms tumors as proposed by the National Wilms Tumor Study are reviewed.\r"

Fourteen women preferred PPA, 4 preferred placebo, and 6 considered PPA and placebo to be ineffective. The scored improvements obtained by PPA were highly significant when tested against the scored placebo effect.

  ".W": "In 727 patients with acute myocardial infarction, different enzyme variables reflecting infarct size were related to the 5-year mortality rate. The maximum activity of serum heat-stable lactate dehydrogenase (LD), analyzed every 12 hours for 48 to 108 hours, was significantly associated with the 5-year mortality rate when patients with a first myocardial infarction were evaluated (p less than 0.001), and similarly (p less than 0.001) when patients with a previous myocardial infarction were included in the analyses. Very similar results were found when the maximum activity of aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) analyzed once daily for 3 days was related to the mortality rate over 5 years, whereas the maximum activity of creatine kinase (CK) and CK subunit B analyzed every 6 hours for 48 hours in a subset of patients did not predict the outcome to the same extent. The results from LD and ASAT analyses clearly indicated that the association between infarct size and 5-year mortality rate was caused by the much higher mortality rate in patients with larger infarcts during the first year after onset of infarction, whereas after the first year, incidence of death appeared to be independent of the original infarct size. Thus we conclude that although a highly significant relationship between infarct size and overall 5-year survival was found, the mortality rate seemed to be higher in patients with larger infarcts, particularly during the first year after infarction.\r"

One infant had echocardiographic and angiographic evidence of diffuse cardiomyopathy and died suddenly at home. The other infant was seen initially at 13 months of age with refractory ventricular tachycardia and died following surgical resection of arrhythmogenic foci on the left and right ventricles. Autopsy showed diffuse patchy oncocytic cardiomyopathy in both instances. Serial histologic sections of the cardiac conduction system showed oncocytic involvement of the atrioventricular (AV) node, His bundle, and bundle branches. Both infants had interruption of the anulus fibrosus by oncocytic cells at several sites, resulting in multiple accessory AV and nodoventricular connections. Additionally, patient No. 1 had an accessory AV connection by oncocytic cells in the fatty fibrous tissue of the left AV sulcus. To our knowledge, this is the first report of multiple accessory AV connections of oncocytic cells seen during histologic study. In addition, both infants had oncocytic involvement of the exocrine and endocrine glands. This report discusses the clinicopathologic correlations in these two patients, the literature on oncocytic cardiomyopathy, and the types of dysrhythmias found in these patients and their management.\r"

Acute intravenous administration of nicardipine resulted in a significant decrease in arterial blood pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. There was a significant increase in cardiac index, stroke volume index, and the left ventricular stroke work index. Cardiac index measured at peak exercise increased significantly when compared with the cardiac index obtained at peak exercise before the infusion. After 9 days of continuous therapy with nicardipine, 30 mg three times a day, a significant decrease in arterial blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance and a significant increase in the cardiac index, stroke volume index, and left ventricular stroke work index at rest were observed in response to a single oral dose of 30 mg nicardipine. Data at peak exercise were also obtained before and 2 hours after the oral administration of nicardipine. With this comparison there was a significant increase in cardiac index, stroke work index, and exercise duration. It is concluded that in this group of patients with severe chronic heart failure, nicardipine enhanced myocardial performance during rest and exercise and this enhancement is sustained after 9 days of oral therapy.\r"

Intravenous (0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg) and oral (0.7 to 4.9 mg/kg) piroximone significantly (p less than 0.05) improved right and left ventricular pump function in both groups while causing an insignificant rise in heart rate and reduction in arterial pressure. Myocardial O2 uptake was not altered acutely or subacutely after piroximone, and myocardial lactate production was not observed. The salutary hemodynamic response to oral piroximone was sustained for 5 hours and there was no evidence of tolerance to the third and fourth doses. In group II, VO2 max was increased (p less than 0.05) at 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 weeks of oral piroximone therapy. Adverse gastrointestinal effects were observed in two patients and a supraventricular tachycardia in another. Thus, piroximone may prove useful in the long-term management of chronic cardiac failure. Controlled clinical trials should be undertaken to determine the ultimate efficacy and safety of piroximone in these patients.\r"

These advantages are related to better contrast of the images, lack of superimposition of normal and abnormal areas, and a three-dimensional representation of the site and extent of perfusion abnormalities (ischemia, scar, or both). For this reason, rotational tomography is superior to planar imaging in assessing the extent of coronary artery disease, in the detection of small infarcts, and for quantitative measurements. Several techniques have provided accurate quantitative data for infarct sizing both in animals and men. The ability to quantitate infarct size (or ischemia) will be extremely important in studies of myocardial salvage, risk stratification, and longitudinal studies to evaluate the effects of medical and surgical interventions.\r"

  ".U": "88020692\r", 
  ".W": "Esmolol (Brevibloc) is an intravenous, short-acting, titratable, cardioselective beta blocker with a very rapid onset and offset of action (t1/2 = 9.2 minutes). Esmolol-induced beta blockade can be maintained as long as infusion is continued. It exhibits neither intrinsic sympathomimetic activity nor significant membrane-stabilizing activity. It is rapidly metabolized by an esterase in the erythrocyte cytosol to an inactive acid metabolite. Its hemodynamic and electrophysiologic effects are similar to those of other beta blockers. Unlike the effects of other beta blockers, however, the effects of esmolol dissipate rapidly to baseline within 30 minutes after its discontinuation. Evidence obtained from clinical studies indicates that esmolol is effective and safe in reducing the ventricular rate in patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, and in reducing the heart rate in patients with acute myocardial infarction and/or unstable angina. Esmolol has also been shown to be effective and safe in attenuating the tachycardia and hypertension seen during the intraoperative period. Data from postoperative patients indicate that esmolol is ideal as sole-agent therapy for the treatment of moderate postoperative hypertension associated with a hyperdynamic state. The short duration of action and titratability of esmolol make it an ideal drug for use in patients in whom the clinical need for beta blockade is limited in duration, and it offers additional safety in patients in whom beta blockade is beneficial; however, it might be precluded because of coexisting contraindications. To date, experience with esmolol in over 1200 patients has been gathered, and the adverse effect profile is basically similar to that reported here.\r"

Fifteen patients with stable angina pectoris, aged 32 to 79 years (mean = 53), were randomized to propranolol (80 to 160 mg/day) or acebutolol (400 mg/day) treatment groups, and followed for approximately 1 year (mean = 371 days). Blood was collected on the day treatment was begun, after approximately 5 months (mean = 158 days), and on completion of the trial. Very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) (alpha less than 1.006), low-density lipoproteins (LDL) (1.006 to 1.063), and high-density lipoproteins (HDL) (1.063 to 1.125 [HDL2] and 1.125 to 1.21 [HDL3]) were isolated by sequential preparative ultracentrifugation, and their cholesterol and triglyceride quantified by enzymic procedures. After 1 year propranolol had raised the mean VLDL triglyceride concentration by 79% (p less than 0.005) and had lowered total HDL cholesterol by 24% (p less than 0.005). As LDL cholesterol was unchanged, the LDL cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio was increased by 26% (p less than 0.005). Mean values at 5 months were intermediate between those at baseline and those at 1 year. In contrast to these changes, acebutolol had no significant effect on any measured lipoprotein lipid.\r"

Recent trials comparing a beta blocker with other antihypertensive drugs have not shown the \"cardioprotection\" expected from their pharmacologic actions and from their effectiveness after myocardial infarction; but two large trials have suggested some reduction in CHD among male nonsmokers. Relaxation with biofeedback possibly lowers CHD risk. Although the trials indicate that drugs generally do little to reduce CHD in hypertensive patients, control of smoking and serum cholesterol may be more effective.\r"

  ".U": "88020717\r", 
  ".W": "Two methods are available for exploring arrhythmias in cardiac patients who are at risk of sudden death: Holter monitoring and invasive electrophysiology. Despite numerous studies, the predictive value of these techniques, in terms of prognosis, remains poor for many reasons. Neither technique considered individually can give reliable prognostic indications simply because each technique addresses different issues which are only partially involved in the mechanism of sudden death. Invasive electrophysiology, by artificially provoking an arrhythmia, detects the potential substrate which may ultimately lead to lethal arrhythmias. Although this is an important technique it is insufficient because merely identifying the substrate for an arrhythmia does not necessarily mean that arrhythmia will occur. On the other hand, ambulatory ECG allows monitoring of spontaneous arrhythmias which may be considered as potential initiating factors in arrhythmias. However, even if initiating factors and potential substrates are present, they are not sufficient conditions to cause lethal arrhythmias to occur. When there is an opportunity to scrutinize the mechanism of arrhythmias which are indeed lethal, as in sudden death, it appears that the lethal event results from the intervention of a new factor which was either absent or not considered during preceding investigations. In coronary patients, curiously, ischemia more often provokes cardiac arrest or an electromechanical dissociation rather than a ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. Sudden death is not infrequently of iatrogenic origin, because of the arrhythmogenic effect of powerful antiarrhythmic drugs. More important, ventricular fibrillation often occurs in the setting of a progressively increased sympathetic tone, which explains either the particular seriousness of a previously known arrhythmia or the occurrence of an arrhythmia which was never before observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In fact, this has been shown for strokes, congestive heart failure, and renal insufficiency. But in large trials of hypertension treatment, patients receiving active medications experienced an incidence of coronary events that averaged only 7% lower than that in placebo-treated patients. This report examines some of the reasons for this disappointing outcome. During therapeutic trials patients receiving placebo tended to have fewer cardiovascular events than predicted. However, patients on active therapy in large-scale studies may have suboptimal blood pressure control. They may also be exposed to the adverse effects of inappropriate therapy. Careful selection of modern drugs should allow blood pressure to be controlled in a safe manner, and possibly contribute directly to protection from coronary events and other cardiovascular complications.\r"

  ".W": "It is now generally accepted that hypertension-induced left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) represents a phenomenon of multifactorial origin. Antihypertensive therapy with beta-blocking drugs influences most of the factors involved in the control of left ventricular mass. Therefore, although initial animal experiments yielded conflicting results, it is not surprising that a great deal of evidence has been accumulated in clinical studies showing that successful long-term antihypertensive treatment with beta blockers induces regression of LVH in hypertensive subjects. Differences in molecular structure among various beta-blocking agents do not seem to influence this property. On the contrary, the question of whether reversal of LVH represents a beneficial or harmful byproduct of antihypertensive treatment with beta blockers is still unanswered. Animal and clinical studies suggest that left ventricular systolic function is unchanged or even improved after regression of LVH, whereas the ability of the heart to withstand recurrence of hypertension is slightly reduced. Furthermore, development of LVH in hypertensive subjects is associated with abnormalities in diastolic function which are not reduced by reversal of LVH induced by antihypertensive treatment with beta blockers.\r"

  ".W": "Diuretic drugs, when used in the treatment of hypertension, raise the blood concentrations of total cholesterol and low-density or very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Triglycerides often increase as well. Thiazide, phthalimidine, loop, potassium-sparing, and methylindoline drugs produce a similar effect. Only indapamide, a methylindoline agent with vasodilator activity, has been free of adverse lipid effects. It remains unclear whether it is the low dose of indapamide or some other quality that frees it of this effect. In long-term diuretic therapy, total cholesterol returns to, or below, baseline values, suggesting that the lipid elevations are transitory. However, in studies with adequate control groups, total cholesterol declines below baseline valves in control subjects such that an adverse differential in lipid values persists in long-term treatment. Selective alpha-1-adrenoceptor-blocking drugs cause no change or favorable alterations in lipid concentrations in short-term and long-term (1 year) treatment. Among all antihypertensive drugs, this class of agents, and especially prazosin, has produced the most consistently salutary lipid and metabolic effects. Although less well examined, guanabenz, clonidine, guanfacine, and diltiazem have been associated with favorable lipid changes. Captopril and nifedipine have caused no change in lipid-lipoprotein values in limited investigations. These agents are preferable to diuretics and certain beta blockers with respect to short-term effects on lipids and lipoproteins. Their ultimate superiority as monotherapy depends on whether they lower blood pressure equally well. Lowering of the probability of coronary heart disease in hypertensive patients depends as much on blood pressure control as on lipid effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During exercise there were no differences among patients taking placebo, diltiazem and atenolol in peak workload and rating of perceived exertion. Atenolol significantly attenuated the increase in heart rate, BP and heart rate-BP product at each workload. Diastolic BP during exercise was significantly lower (6 to 10 mm Hg) during diltiazem therapy than during placebo at each workload. Thus, both diltiazem and atenolol decrease rest BP significantly without impairing exercise capacity.\r"

New knowledge about arrhythmias and new antiarrhythmic drugs provide greater opportunities for treatment choice and evaluations. A prognostic classification of ventricular arrhythmias helps to focus management. For benign ventricular arrhythmias, the objective of drug treatment is alleviation. The best management approach to potentially malignant ventricular arrhythmias, however, is not yet known, and data from ongoing clinical studies continue to accrue, developing the knowledge base needed to devise better regimens. Symptomatic patients can be managed either by symptom alleviation, as in benign arrhythmia, or more aggressively, as in malignant ventricular arrhythmia. Treatment is not mandatory for asymptomatic patients with potentially malignant ventricular arrhythmias, because there is no evidence that reducing arrhythmia prolongs life or effectively prevents symptomatic disease. Also, antiarrhythmic drugs have the potential for causing adverse effects, even lethal ones. For malignant ventricular arrhythmia, the objective of treatment is prevention of symptomatic ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. Effective new methods predictive of successful drug treatment in individual patients are available; these methods remove much of the empiricism from management of patients with malignant ventricular arrhythmia. Treatment deemed effective by rigorous noninvasive evaluation or by electrophysiologic studies has a high probability of success in the long term. Drug management of malignant ventricular arrhythmia should become more effective in the future as a result of newly developing approaches to drug evaluation.\r"

  ".W": "Initiation and maintenance of reentrant arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation in the acute phase of myocardial ischemia, may be due to different mechanisms. The characteristics of circus movement reentry, both with and without involvement of an anatomic obstacle, are discussed. The concept of wavelength of a reentrant circuit as calculated by the product of refractory period and conduction velocity is emphasized. To maintain circus movement tachycardia in an acutely ischemic myocardium, the ischemic tissue mass must be larger than the wavelength. For maintenance of fibrillation, several independent reentrant wavelets must be simultaneously present. Agents that prolong wavelength (by lengthening refractory period, increasing conduction velocity or both) may prevent reentry. Experiments are described that show the effectiveness of lidocaine, which depresses action potentials of ischemic myocardial cells, in preventing ventricular fibrillation when administered before coronary artery occlusion in isolated pig hearts. Ventricular premature depolarizations or beats are usually necessary to initiate reentrant rhythms. They may be caused by reflection, a type of reentrant excitation involving slow conduction, or by electronic transmission over short segments of depressed or unexcitable tissue. An example of microreentry in a 4 mm segment of papillary muscle exposed to elevated extracellular K+ concentrations, resulting in a ventricular premature beat, is shown. Focal mechanisms, such as abnormal automaticity or triggered activity, may also be responsible for premature impulses. Agents that suppress premature depolarizations may be effective against reentrant arrhythmias, even when they do not affect the reentrant mechanism itself. Experiments are described, showing that moricizine HCl suppresses abnormal automaticity in isolated papillary muscle, partially depolarized by application of electric current.\r"

  ".W": "Moricizine HCl, a phenothiazine derivative, is a new antiarrhythmic drug that has quinidine-like effects on the myocardium. Moricizine HCl, 1 X 10(-7) g/ml, significantly decreases Vmax of the transmembrane action potential of canine Purkinje fibers and reduces the duration of the action potential at 50% and 90% of repolarization, whereas resting potential is unchanged. The drug decreases the fast inward sodium current (lNa), as measured by the double sucrose gap technique in frog atrium trabeculae; the processes of activation, inactivation and reactivation of current did not change even when a high concentration of drug (5 X 10(-6) g/ml) was used. At the same dose, the slow inward calcium current (lCa) increased, but the total outward current did not change. Using the patch-clamp technique, it was shown that moricizine HCl, 1 X 10(-4) g/ml, did not alter single-channel conductance, but essentially decreased the mean open tonic and open-state probability of potassium channels either at positive or negative holding potentials. lNa measured in a single myocyte preparation decreased faster when drug was administered in the external bath compared with intracellular injection. Moricizine HCl action on lNa of the single cell and on Vmax of the action potential is frequency dependent. When lNa was recorded directly, there was a cumulative effect of drug. Similar to other quinidine-like agents, moricizine HCl enhanced arrhythmogenicity within the first few minutes after coronary artery occlusion, but prevented arrhythmias 24 hours after acute myocardial infarction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although preliminary work has shown moricizine HCl to be effective in treating both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, little is known of its pharmacokinetics. There is a 4-fold variability in range for its elimination half-life and in volumes of distribution and clearance. There is a linear relation for peak plasma levels and area under the plasma concentration/time curve with regard to single-dose administration of moricizine HCl. The bioavailability of moricizine HCl connotes extensive first-pass effect, or presystemic metabolism. Very little of moricizine is excreted unchanged; it is extensively metabolized to certain compounds that are present in plasma for extended periods. Moricizine is extensively (92% to 95%) bound to plasma protein. Its coadministration with cimetidine leads to additive systemic effects; however, there is no evidence of alterations in steady-state levels when moricizine HCl is coadministered with digoxin. Because moricizine is a drug with active metabolites, its concentration/effect profile is complex; this poses a challenge for accurate dose titration. This may, however, be a helpful challenge in that the metabolites may one day prove useful in therapy. This surmise warrants further study.\r"

Moricizine HCl had no significant effects on the sinus node in patients with normal nodal function and did not depress sinoatrial conduction time even in patients with serious node dysfunction. Moricizine HCl significantly lengthened the following intervals: PA (32 +/- 5 to 40 +/- 5 ms), AH (82 +/- 13 to 92 +/- 12 ms), HV (45 +/- 12 to 50 +/- 12 ms), paced cycle length 1:1 atrioventricular node conduction (340 +/- 14 to 352 +/- 14 ms) and paced cycle length 1:1 ventriculoatrial conduction (300 +/- 14 to 400 +/- 13 ms). The refractory periods of atrium, atrioventricular node and ventricular myocardium did not change significantly, and there was no alteration of the QRS or QT intervals. The drug abolished anterograde and retrograde conduction over the accessory pathway and increased the refractory period of accessory pathway in all patients. Intravenous moricizine HCl terminated and prevented tachycardia in 72% and 68% of the patients, respectively. Oral moricizine HCl (600 to 800 mg/24 hours) prevented tachycardia in 40% of patients with a preexcitation syndrome. Intravenous moricizine HCl terminated atrioventricular nodal reentrant paroxysmal tachycardia in 66% of patients, whereas 40% responded to the oral drug.

A dose-response relation between moricizine HCl and the percentage of reduction in frequency of benign or potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias was documented. Eighty-five percent of patients achieved a reduction in VPCs greater than 75% with daily dosages ranging from 10.1 to 15 mg/kg. This corresponded to a 95% decrease in mean frequency of VPCs. Long-term studies demonstrated no evidence of compromise in left ventricular function, and the proarrhythmic rate was only 2%. Symptomatic side effects were mild and usually well tolerated. Nausea, the most common, occurred in 11% of patients and dizziness in 9%. These results indicate that moricizine HCl is an effective and well-tolerated antiarrhythmic agent.\r"

Two clinical investigations of moricizine HCl, each using a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover design, are summarized. In the first study, 18 patients with greater than or equal to 30 ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) per hour (mean 369 +/- 95) were given propranolol (120 mg daily) compared with moricizine HCl (816 +/- 103 mg daily). Propranolol suppressed 38% of VPCs in the study group, moricizine HCl, 81% of VPCs, and the combination of both drugs, 87%. Moricizine HCl was more effective than propranolol in suppressing VPCs at all individual levels greater than 70% (p less than 0.05, McNemar's test). The combination of moricizine HCl and propranolol was well tolerated. The second investigation used a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover design to compare the efficacy of disopyramide (600 mg daily) and moricizine HCl (800 mg daily) in 27 patients. Patients had greater than or equal to 40 VPCs/hr on a 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram. During moricizine HCl administration, the mean VPC frequency decreased from 524 to 151 VPCs/hr (71.2% reduction). In contrast, disopyramide reduced VPC frequency from 535 to 253 VPCs/hr (52.8% reduction) and demonstrated significantly greater side effects (p less than 0.05). Moricizine HCl was more effective than disopyramide in suppressing VPCs at all individual percent reduction levels greater than 70% (p less than 0.05, McNemar's test). Moricizine HCl was more effective in suppressing VPCs than either disopyramide or propranolol, with significantly fewer side effects.\r"

A noninvasive approach utilizing monitoring and exercise testing was used in 82 patients who had a high density of reproducible spontaneous arrhythmia, whereas 20 patients without such arrhythmia required invasive electrophysiologic testing. The dosage of moricizine HCl was 200 mg 3 times daily, and during 5 to 6 days was titrated up to a maximum of 400 mg 3 times daily or 15 mg/kg daily, based on arrhythmia suppression and occurrence of side effects. Criteria for efficacy were a greater than 90% reduction in repetitive ventricular premature beats (couplets and runs of VT) and a greater than 50% reduction in ventricular premature beats when noninvasive methods were used. When electrophysiologic testing was used, the drug was judged effective if it prevented the induction of greater than 2 repetitive responses. Of 75 patients completing noninvasive study, 30 (40%) responded to moricizine HCl therapy, whereas only 1 of 20 patients undergoing electrophysiologic testing responded. There was no difference in moricizine HCl blood levels between responders and nonresponders (0.41 microgram/ml vs 0.43 microgram/ml, difference not significant). Side effects occurred in 28 patients (27%). Most frequent were aggravation of arrhythmia (n = 12), nausea and vomiting (n = 5), central nervous system toxicity (n = 3) and anticholinergic side effects (n = 3). The response rate to moricizine HCl therapy was higher in patients with nonsustained VT (62%) compared with those with sustained VT (19%) or ventricular fibrillation (33%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Moricizine HCl significantly prolonged PR, QRS, AH and HV intervals and cycle length for atrioventricular nodal block, but had minimal or no effect on repolarization or cardiac refractory periods. Induction of sustained VT (in 33 patients) and nonsustained VT (in 14 patients) occurred at baseline. During moricizine HCl therapy, sustained VT was induced in 31 patients and nonsustained VT in 7 patients. In individual patients, suppression of VT induction was obtained in 18% of patients with sustained VT and in 27% of patients with nonsustained VT. Cycle length of induced VT was significantly prolonged by moricizine HCl therapy. During prospective follow-up of 37 patients, electrophysiologic study predicted recurrence of nonrecurrence of VT with a sensitivity value of 82% and specificity of 65%.\r"

Most antiarrhythmic agents have not been sufficiently investigated to adequately describe detrimental effects on LV function; we report the effects of moricizine HCl on ventricular function in 4 trials highlighting patients with LV dysfunction. Quantitative 2-dimensional echocardiography was used to evaluate 81 patients pre- and posttreatment. There was no change in mean global LV ejection fraction (EF) during placebo compared with moricizine HCl therapy (47 +/- 15% vs 46 +/- 14%, p greater than 0.05). In a separate trial, radionuclide LVEF at rest and exercise tolerance testing were performed in 24 patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias who had a mean control LVEF of 40 +/- 19%. No significant change during moricizine HCl therapy (38 +/- 19%, p greater than 0.05) was detected and exercise parameters were unchanged. Rest and exercise LV function was measured during right-sided heart catheterization in a placebo-controlled study of 20 patients with ventricular tachycardia. Moricizine HCl was well tolerated without hemodynamic deterioration in all but 3 patients, who could be identified by their inability to increase stroke volume index during exercise. Finally, the relation between initial LV function and resultant antiarrhythmic efficacy indicates that moricizine HCl controls arrhythmias best in patients with LVEF greater than 30%.\r"

Moricizine HCl has demonstrated a low incidence of generally mild and transient side effects. Studies of possible drug interaction between it and other drugs most likely to be administered to cardiovascular patients are currently being conducted in US drug trials. Possible interactions between moricizine HCl and cimetidine, and between moricizine HCl and digoxin, are reviewed. The coadministration of moricizine HCl had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of cimetidine; in contrast, cimetidine administration slowed the elimination of moricizine HCl. The implications of greater therapeutic and/or toxic effects of moricizine HCl must be considered for patients receiving cimetidine and moricizine HCl concomitantly. No significant interactions were observed when monitoring serum levels of moricizine HCl and digoxin in patients with normal renal function receiving digoxin therapy for congestive heart failure or atrial fibrillation. Moricizine HCl in therapeutic dosages (10 mg/kg daily) demonstrated antiarrhythmic efficacy without significant alterations in serum digoxin levels.\r"

Whereas the cellular mechanism of atrial ectopic tachycardia is unknown, atrial ectopic tachycardia may be due to a form of automaticity. Moricizine HCl has been used primarily for ventricular rhythm disturbances; the drug depresses abnormal automaticity and delayed after-depolarizations but has little effect on normal automaticity. Because of this property, we have used moricizine HCl in 4 patients with atrial ectopic tachycardia. As evidenced by continuous 24-hour Holter monitoring, moricizine HCl was successful in suppressing atrial ectopic tachycardia in each patient. During a limited follow-up (6 months) no side effects have occurred. Moricizine HCl is a promising primary drug for atrial ectopic tachycardia.\r"

However, studies also show that Doppler echocardiography may be too sensitive for diagnosing pathologic MR. To determine whether the false-positive or clinically insignificant diagnosis of MR can be eliminated by defining more specific diagnostic criteria, pulsed Doppler findings were compared with left ventricular angiographic findings in 81 patients. Using the conventional Doppler criterion of any systolic increased spectral dispersion detected in the left atrium, sensitivity was 100% and specificity was 76%. Using holosystolic increased spectral dispersion as the criterion, sensitivity was 100% and specificity was 92%. Using the combined criteria of holosystolic increased spectral dispersion plus peak regurgitant blood flow velocity of greater than 150 cm/s, sensitivity was 100% and specificity was 97%. Doppler studies in 20 clinically normal persons showed that the combined Doppler criteria were 100% specific. In conclusion, the presence of holosystolic increased spectral dispersion within the left atrium with a peak regurgitant flow velocity greater than 150 cm/s appears to be as sensitive as and more specific than the presence of any systolic Doppler increased spectral dispersion in identifying patients with MR.\r"

Furthermore, antihypertensive drug studies in mild hypertensive subjects (diastolic blood pressure 90 to 104 mm Hg) have shown protection against stroke, left ventricular hypertrophy, congestive heart failure and progression of renal damage, as well as improved patient longevity. The Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program trial, recently carried out in the U.S., documented reduced coronary artery disease events (fatal and nonfatal) in special drug-treated patients with mild hypertension. From the standpoint of practical management and considering the ubiquity of essential hypertension, a modified stepped-care regimen advocating initial drug therapy with a beta blocker and addition of low-dose thiazide diuretic when necessary constitutes a judicious approach for widespread application. Although there are 8 orally active beta blockers currently approved in the U.S. for clinical use in systemic hypertension, only acebutolol possesses all of the salutary pharmacologic properties of cardioselectivity, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and hydrophilicity, thereby making this compound an effective and safe beta-blocking agent for first-order management of a broad segment of the hypertensive population.\r"

The GI correlated positively with the percentage of starch digested in vitro (p less than 0.05). The degree of starch gelatinization ranged from 0.4 to 60% and correlated positively with the percentage starch digested in vitro (p less than 0.05).

  ".W": "A coagglutination (COA) test to detect Candida antigenemia was developed using locally produced Candida antiserum and COA reagent. All 68 controls had normal results. Two patient groups were included in this study. In Group 1, consisting of eight patients, with definite systemic or deep candidiasis proved by repeat Candida isolation, COA detected antigenemia in 100% as against 50% by counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE). In Group 2, 9 of 19 patients had respiratory infection; 4 patients revealed antigenemia by COA, 2 of whom had no Candida isolation. In these 2 patients therapy was initiated based on COA results. Of another nine patients with hematologic and malignant diseases, five (56%) revealed antigenemia by COA, three of whom had no Candida isolation; two died and one was discharged against advice. Transient antigenemia was detected by COA in a single patient with ulcerative colitis with Candida isolation. Thus, the COA test was found to be rapid, sensitive, and specific for the detection of Candida antigenemia. Furthermore, it had early diagnostic (seven days) as well as prognostic value, as revealed by response to therapy and decrease in COA titer. Being highly cost effective, this test is recommended as a simple test within the reach of any routine diagnostic laboratory.\r"

Tumor heterogeneity of antigen expression has been recognized as a potential limiting factor in such studies. The authors report a study designed to evaluate the degree of heterogeneity of 17-1A antigen expression among primary and metastatic human colon carcinomas. All 141 specimens, including 74 primary or metastatic colonic adenocarcinomas, were evaluated with the use of an avidin-biotin complex immunoperoxidase technic on briefly fixed frozen tissue sections. All of these showed at least focal staining with MAb 17-1A. However, well- or moderately differentiated tumors generally showed diffuse cytoplasmic immunostaining, whereas poorly differentiated tumors showed minimal immunostaining with no detectable antigen in most areas. In 16 cases that had both primary and metastatic adenocarcinomas or multiple metastatic tumors, 17-1A antigen expression was similar among the tumor sites except for one case. This case showed variation in tumor differentiation and corresponding variation in 17-1A antigen expression. Of 36 additional malignant tumors that were not of colonic epithelial origin, adenocarcinomas of the stomach, duodenum, endometrium, ovary, and breast showed 17-1A antigen expression.\r"

The latter may be particularly observed in skin. Samples of both normal skin and melanotic malignant melanoma were treated for the removal of melanin by standard technics both before and after a peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) immunohistologic sequence. Many methods for the removal of melanin pigment resulted in diminished DAB staining intensity. Some also caused cellular disruption. However, the method of choice was found to be treatment with 0.25 g/dL potassium permanganate and 1 g/dL oxalic acid before the immunoperoxidase sequence.\r"

With the use of a frozen-section immunoperoxidase technic, 152 B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas were examined for Leu-8 expression. Of these lymphomas, 53% expressed Leu-8. Subclassification of the lymphomas with the use of the International Working Formulation showed that most small lymphocytic, intermediate lymphocytic, and diffuse large cell lymphomas and about half of diffuse small cleaved, diffuse mixed, and follicular lymphomas expressed Leu-8. In contrast, all 17 cases of small noncleaved cell (Burkitt's) lymphoma and 9 of 10 cases of multiple myeloma/plasmacytoma were Leu-8 negative. These results indicate that Leu-8 is expressed on a wide variety of B-cell lymphomas and that differences in Leu-8 expression may be useful in the diagnostic separation of small lymphocytic lymphoma with plasmacytoid features from multiple myeloma/plasmacytoma, and diffuse large cell lymphoma from Burkitt's lymphoma.\r"

  ".W": "Although one member of the H2 blocker family (oxmetidine) proved to be intrinsically hepatotoxic, overt hepatic injury attributable to cimetidine and ranitidine is decidedly rare, given the tens of millions of patients who have received these medications. Even considering the fact that serious adverse reactions may be underreported by as much as a factor of 100, the number of reports submitted to the FDA-DDE of possible hepatic toxicity associated with these agents supports this low incidence. Whether or not a similarly low incidence will be seen with famotidine and the newer H2 receptor antagonists still under investigation must await additional clinical experience. The major effect of cimetidine on the liver is inhibition of the mixed function oxidase system responsible for the metabolism of many drugs and other compounds. Ranitidine and famotidine at usual doses do not appear to share the same drug interaction potential. Although cimetidine may potentiate the action of several medications with a narrow therapeutic range, possibly leading to clinical toxicity, its inhibitory effect on oxidative metabolism also appears to be the basis for its unique, potentially hepatoprotective role against injury due to acetaminophen and certain other hepatotoxins. Whether or not cimetidine will become clinically useful in the setting of acute acetaminophen overdose remains speculative at this time. The investigational drug, omeprazole, a substituted benzimidazole, is also capable of inhibiting the cytochrome P-450 system. Antacids, sucralfate, and other coating agents are devoid of any hepatotoxic potential, as they are essentially nonsystemic compounds. E-type prostaglandins currently under investigation for treatment of peptic ulcer disease do not appear to be intrinsically hepatotoxic, and, in fact, may have important hepatoregulatory and hepatoprotective properties.\r"

Detection of congenital obstructive uropathy in the human fetus may occur as early as 16 weeks gestation. In the fetal lamb model, experimental occlusion of the outflow tract results in progressive hydronephrosis, pulmonary hypoplasia, and oligohydramnios. The renal parenchymal changes vary with the fetal age at obstruction ranging from simple hydronephrosis with later obstruction to dysgenesis with earlier obstruction. The pulmonary damage, and to some extent the renal damage, may be halted or even reversed with release of obstruction. These advances in diagnosis and an understanding of the pathophysiology have prompted attempts at chronic in utero diversion therapy in the human fetus with obstructive uropathy yielding encouraging, but as of yet, unproven success. In this report, the methods for such therapy, the rationale for the therapy, and the results of the therapy is reviewed.\r"

The older recipients had fewer rejection episodes during the first four months following cardiac transplantation (0.24 +/- 0.05 episodes per month versus 0.72 +/- 0.09 episodes per month; p less than 0.001) and during the total duration of follow-up (0.20 +/- 0.03 episodes per month versus 0.40 +/- 0.07 episodes per month; p = 0.045), and experienced their first rejection episode later (50.4 +/- 4.0 days versus 27.7 +/- 8.5 days; p = 0.008). Younger age was found to add significantly as a predictor of rejection in a multivariate analysis that controlled for sex, immunosuppressive agents, cause of heart failure, and pretransplantation lymphocyte cross-match status (r = 0.64, p less than 0.05). Decreased rejection frequency occurred without a concomitant increase in the serious infection rate (67 percent in both groups). The 12-month actuarial survival was 100 percent in the older group and 94 percent in the younger group (p = NS). Decreased rejection in the older recipients is likely a manifestation of an age-associated decline in immune function and might represent an advantage in transplantation for carefully selected older patients.\r"

Approximately 7 percent of the attempts required conversion to a low-dose heparin regimen because of clotting in the extracorporeal dialysis circuit. Fewer than 2 percent of the dialysis treatments resulted in clotting in the extracorporeal circuit sufficient to interrupt hemodialysis. Partial thromboplastin times and activated clotting times did not change during these hemodialysis treatments. Solute clearance, ultrafiltration rate, and decrements in arterial oxygen concentration and platelet count were not different from those in patients who underwent hemodialysis with anticoagulation. There were no episodes of accelerated bleeding associated with this dialysis method. This study indicates that hemodialysis without anticoagulation can be reliable and effective in closely monitored situations.\r"

Ten patients had carpal tunnel syndrome, 13 had juxta-articular radiolucent cysts (complicated by spontaneous fractures of the femoral neck in three), and six had destructive arthropathies of the large joints of the limbs. Massive amyloid deposits were found in the synovium, capsule, ligaments, articular cartilage, and/or bone. They were characterized by Congo red-induced green birefringence that was sensitive to potassium permanganate treatment. They reacted with anti-beta-2 microglobulin antiserum, whereas they did not react with antibodies directed against AA protein, prealbumin, or immunoglobulins. These data suggest that the potentially disabling arthropathy of hemodialysis is due to amyloid lesions. The persistently elevated plasma beta-2 microglobulin levels may play a role in the pathogenesis of this recently recognized complication, and if so, this complication should be preventable.\r"

In this short- and long-term efficacy trial, the responses of testosterone and its metabolites to the application of transscrotal testosterone systems of varying testosterone content were compared with the response to 200 mg of testosterone enanthate. Daily transscrotal testosterone system administration resulted in a rapid increase of testosterone and bioavailable, non-sex hormone binding globulin-bound testosterone levels to normal, peaking at two hours, followed by a slow decline over 23 hours, resembling the diurnal variation of endogenous testosterone. One year of daily transscrotal testosterone system therapy demonstrated continued reliable absorption of testosterone and suppression to normal of the luteinizing hormone in two of three patients. There was a greatly disproportionate increase of serum dihydrotestosterone over testosterone, suggesting 5-alpha reduction at the scrotal site. The subjects reported marked subjective improvement. Thus, the transscrotal testosterone system is a novel, effective, and well-tolerated method of delivering testosterone to hypogonadal patients.\r"

The presence of intranuclear inclusions on postmortem light microscopic examination of liver, lung, and small bowel tissue was considered diagnostic of cytomegalovirus infection. However, electron microscopic examination of liver tissue demonstrated adenovirus infection. This was confirmed by isolation of an adenovirus type 2 with unusual laboratory features from liver, lung, colon contents, serum, esophageal swab, and oral ulcerations. Results of a complement fixation test for antibodies to adenovirus performed on postmortem serum samples were negative, and a titer of 1:4 was noted for antibody against cytomegalovirus. This case illustrates the diagnostic pitfalls that may be encountered in establishing a specific viral diagnosis in severely ill patients.\r"

A total of 258 patients were followed for 12 months; of these, 143 had been previously treated with cimetidine and 115 had been treated with sucralfate. The relapse rates and the median time to relapse did not differ between the two groups. After 12 months, 71 percent of the previously cimetidine-treated patients and 68 percent of the sucralfate-treated patients had experienced a relapse.

The mean duration of the treatment was about six days in both of the groups. Gastric pH was determined every eight hours. Bleeding was defined as macroscopically visible bleeding. The intragastric pH was less than 4 significantly more often in patients treated with sucralfate. In each group, one case of macroscopically visible bleeding occurred. Both of the patients had a very high risk of bleeding. None of the bleedings influenced the outcome of the patients. When patients with primary thoracic trauma or pneumonia were excluded, nosocomial pneumonia developed in significantly fewer (p less than 0.05) patients in the sucralfate group (three of 29) than in the antacid group (11 of 32). In four of the latter patients, pneumonia influenced the outcome of the patients. Sucralfate provides adequate protection against stress bleeding while also minimizing the danger of pneumonia caused by infection via the gastropulmonary route.\r"

The evaluation of effect was based on data from 41 patients; 22 of these had received sucralfate, and 19 had received ranitidine. Reflux esophagitis was healed after eight weeks of treatment in 14 sucralfate-treated patients and in 13 ranitidine-treated patients. Alterations in the esophageal mucosa were established by endoscopic examination; the severity of these alterations was expressed in degrees using the Savary-Miller method of classification. The greater the degree of severity as assessed before treatment, the lower were the chances of the condition being completely healed. The endoscopic findings after treatment did not show any difference in the effect of the sucralfate and ranitidine treatments (p greater than 0.05). Both forms of treatment were also found to have a similar positive effect on the subjective symptoms recorded. Overall tolerance of the two forms of treatment was good. One patient treated with ranitidine had to discontinue treatment because of an allergic rash. Based on these results, sucralfate seems to be an effective alternative for the treatment of reflux esophagitis.\r"

Sixty-eight patients with symptomatic and endoscopic esophagitis received either sucralfate suspension (n = 31) or liquid placebo (n = 37) for eight weeks. The two groups were comparable at entry with the exception that despite randomization, a disproportionately high number of patients with esophageal ulcers were assigned to receive sucralfate. After four and eight weeks of treatment, both groups had reduced heartburn frequency and severity, but there was no difference in improvement between sucralfate and placebo (p greater than 0.05). Endoscopic results after eight weeks of sucralfate treatment revealed complete healing in 36 percent (placebo, 35 percent) and improvement in an additional 45 percent (placebo, 24 percent). Although neither of these differences was significant, the percent of patients in whom healing or improvement occurred with sucralfate (81 percent) was greater than with placebo (59 percent) (p = 0.07). These data fail to establish that eight weeks of treatment with sucralfate suspension improves symptoms or heals lesions in reflux esophagitis at a rate significantly greater than placebo. However, the unequal distribution of patients with ulcers and the trend toward endoscopic improvement indicate that a potential beneficial effect of sucralfate suspension for the treatment of reflux esophagitis cannot be excluded.\r"

All patients followed a fixed regimen of NSAIDs, were assigned to one of two groups based on the presence or absence of gastric erosions at baseline endoscopy, and were then assigned randomly to receive sucralfate or placebo for four weeks. Patients were then followed for up to six months while receiving open-label sucralfate 1 g twice daily to up to 1 g four times daily. After four weeks of double-blind therapy, patients taking either nonsalicylate NSAIDs or long half-life NSAIDs and who were treated with sucralfate experienced a significant reduction in both peptic symptom frequency and intensity (p less than 0.03) as compared with patients receiving placebo. Sucralfate-treated patients with baseline endoscopic lesions showed a significant reduction in lesion scores (p less than 0.005) at four weeks as compared with baseline, whereas no improvement was observed in gastric mucosal lesions of patients given placebo. Long-term sucralfate therapy resulted in continued improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms and gastric lesion scores in patients receiving all types of NSAIDs.

After four weeks, in group A (n = 114: eight patients were lost and nine were withdrawn), the ulcers had healed in 90 patients (79 percent), and in group B (n = 108: six patients were lost and 14 were withdrawn), the ulcers had healed in 80 patients (74 percent). The cumulative healing rates after eight weeks were 94 percent in group A and 95 percent in group B. No serious adverse effect was observed in either group.

In particular, recent developments in our understanding of the pathophysiology of luteinizing hormone secretion in men and women is examined, and illustrate how specific disturbances in neuroendocrine physiology can result in altered reproductive states are illustrated. New models of pituitary-secretary dynamics that are likely to help clarify more subtle defects in fertility regulation in man and experimental animals are suggested.\r"

These patients are always exposed to the risk of peritonitis, which may increase if patients are peritoneally dialyzed while immunosuppressed. The postoperative course of patients transplanted from our CAPD program from 1979 through August 1985 was evaluated. The transplant survival of patients dialyzed by CAPD, home hemodialysis, and at a free-standing dialysis facility were compared. Pretransplant dialysis modality did not influence long-term transplant success. Three of seven patients who required dialysis postoperatively developed peritonitis. The dialysis catheter was removed in two patients and one was treated by lavaging the peritoneal cavity with antibiotics. There was one instance of dialysate leaking through a drain in the transplant bed. This patient was converted to hemodialysis for subsequent dialysis. The dialysis catheters were removed at the time of discharge from hospital. Literature review confirmed this experience. Peritoneal dialysis post-transplant exposes the patient to a 10-33% risk of peritonitis and a 10% risk of a wound complication. Peritoneal dialysis patients are subject to risks unique to peritoneal dialysis. These complications do not translate into excessive morbidity or graft loss.\r"

  ".U": "88021137\r", 
  ".W": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a primary myocardial disease of unknown cause that is characterized by a hypertrophied, nondilated, hypercontractile left ventricle. Its etiology and pathogenesis remain undefined but the three principal factors implicated are a genetic predisposition, a hypersensitivity to catecholamines, and an abnormal calcium metabolism. The hypertrophy typically involves the intraventricular septum to varying degrees, but may also involve the apex or free wall and even be concentric. The disease occurs in either an obstructive or a nonobstructive form depending on whether an intraventricular pressure gradient can be demonstrated at rest or on provocation. The gradient and obstruction to outflow is usually seen in patients with asymmetric septal hypertrophy (ASH) and anterior motion of the mitral valve during systole (SAM). Abnormal left ventricular diastolic function characterized by inadequate filling and impaired relaxation has been shown to be very important in both the obstructive and nonobstructive forms of the disease. In addition, inadequate coronary vasodilator reserve as a result of small vessel disease, microvascular spasm, and/or low capillary density per unit myocardial mass has been implicated as an important cause of ischemia in patients without coronary artery disease. HCM is a disease of young adulthood with relatively slow progression; young patients are often asymptomatic, whereas older patients are more limited by dyspnea, angina, dizziness, or syncope. Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias occur in 30% of patients, and high-grade ventricular arrhythmias occur in over 75%. The annual mortality is 3-5%. The common mode of demise is sudden cardiac death. Therefore, the primary objectives of treatment are the amelioration of symptoms, the control of arrhythmias, and the prevention of sudden death. Beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agents decrease myocardial contractility and oxygen demands and increase ventricular volume; therefore, they are most useful in patients with the obstructive form of HCM. Calcium channel antagonists enhance left ventricular relaxation, relieve microvascular spasm, and improve coronary filling and therefore are the agents of choice in patients with diastolic dysfunction. The ability of the calcium channel antagonists to decrease contractility makes them valuable in patients with obstructive HCM. Arterial vasodilators, diuretics, nitrates, and inotropic agents should be avoided because they can increase the intraventricular gradient. Myomyectomy is reserved for those patients with the obstructive form of HCM whose symptoms are refractory to medical therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The clinical presentation of this patient resembled that of the HTLV-III-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. The tumors totally regressed seven weeks after cessation of immunotherapy. This case, along with other recently reported cases of Kaposi's sarcoma in postrenal transplant patients receiving cyclosporine, illustrates a rare complication of current immunosuppressive therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of 800 mg of elemental calcium per day (calcium carbonate or calcium citrate) on blood pressure were compared with a placebo in a controlled randomized, crossover, double-blinded trial involving 26 patients with uncomplicated primary hypertension. Each patient took two of the three forms of therapy orally for 8-week intervals with a 2-week washout period in between. Standing mean blood pressure rose an average of 5.7 mm Hg on placebo, rose an average of 0.5 mm Hg on calcium carbonate, and fell an average of 2.2 mm Hg on calcium citrate. Changes in sitting mean pressures averaged +1.9 mm Hg on placebo, -0.4 mm Hg on calcium carbonate, and -0.4 mm Hg on calcium citrate. Some patients had a fall, others had a rise in blood pressure on each form of calcium. Similarly, inconsistent responses were noted among the nine patients who took both forms of calcium. Neither initial nor post-treatment biochemical measures nor patient characteristics were predictive of the blood pressure response. Combinations of various measures and characteristics analyzed by the multiple regression technique explained only 30% of the overall variability in blood pressure. Therefore, until ways can be found to predict the response, calcium supplements should not be routinely prescribed for the treatment of hypertension and, if given for any indication, blood pressure should be monitored.\r"

  ".U": "88021144\r", 
  ".W": "Dobutamine is a sympathomimetic amine that was designed as an inotropic agent for use in congestive heart failure. Clinically, dobutamine increases cardiac output by selectively augmenting stroke volume, and this is associated with a decrease in total peripheral vascular resistance that is mediated, in part, by reflex withdrawal of sympathetic tone to the vasculature. This hemodynamic profile of dobutamine makes the drug of value in the management of low output cardiac failure. The inotropic activity of dobutamine has previously been attributed to selective stimulation of myocardial beta 1-adrenoceptors. However, recent studies from a number of laboratories indicate that the mechanism of action of dobutamine is substantially more complex. Dobutamine has the capacity to stimulate beta 1-, beta 2-, and alpha 1-adrenoceptors in the cardiovascular system at doses that approximate those used clinically. It has recently been suggested that the inotropic activity of dobutamine results from combined beta 1- and alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation in the myocardium, and that this activity could explain, at least in part, the inotropic selectivity of the compound. Furthermore, in the vasculature, the beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilatory effect of dobutamine is exactly offset by the alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstrictor activity, such that net changes in blood pressure are minimal following the administration of dobutamine. It is concluded, therefore, that the hemodynamic profile of dobutamine in patients with congestive heart failure is derived from a unique and complex series of interactions with alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors in the cardiovascular system.\r"

The composition of drusen with respect to these specific molecules varied greatly, even within the same region of an eye. Hard or nodular drusen were more likely to show a discrete organized layer of specific basement membrane molecules over their apical surfaces than were diffuse type drusen. Diffuse but not nodular drusen generally contained fibronectin. Immunohistochemical reactivity of Bruch's membrane showed age-related accumulation of type I collagen and localized changes associated with some drusen.\r"

Responses were compared in the same animals among airway Generations 2-5. Concentration-response curves were generated in the same strips with methacholine (MCh) and potassium chloride (KCl) in vitro. Force of contraction was assessed as grams force (g) divided by tissue wet weight (g/g) and was normalized further for the proportion of smooth muscle in each airway by means of computerized morphometry (g/g smooth muscle mass; g/gM). Both techniques revealed substantial heterogeneity of response that was not dependent upon the mechanism of contraction. Maximal isometric contraction to MCh increased from 1911 +/- 245 (Generation 2) to 6693 +/- 850 g/gM (Generation 5) (P less than 0.005). Similarly, maximal contraction to KCl, an agonist causing contraction by a non-receptor-mediated mechanism, was nearly three times greater in Generation 5 than in Generation 2 bronchi (P less than 0.005). It is concluded that the force of isometric contraction of bronchial smooth muscle increases through the first five generations of bronchi, even after normalization for smooth muscle mass. These differences are not agonist-dependent and do not depend upon the topographical distribution of receptors in the airways.\r"

In normal lymph nodes, myoid cells (MCs) were present in the superficial and deep paracortex as well as in the medulla, and absent in lymphoid follicles. In the spleen, they were numerous in the red pulp, less abundant in periarteriolar lymphocyte sheaths of the white pulp, and absent in lymphoid follicles. On double immunostaining, alpha-smooth muscle actin and smooth muscle myosin were coexpressed with desmin only in the deep paracortex and parafollicular areas of the lymph nodes, as well as in the MCs of the periarteriolar lymphocyte sheaths and marginal zone of the spleen; the remaining MCs expressed only desmin. When examined by means of electron microscopy, MCs showed a dendritic shape and cytoplasmic bundles of microfilaments with dense bodies scattered between them. When compared with normal conditions, MCs showed changes of distribution and number in several pathologic situations. Additional findings were 1) staining of pericytes surrounding high endothelium venules of lymph nodes with alpha-smooth muscle actin antibodies in man and rat and with desmin antibodies in rats; 2) staining of endothelial cells in these venules with desmin antibodies in rats. It is concluded that a subset of reticular cells in lymph nodes and spleen, as well as pericytes and endothelial cells in high endothelium venules display cytoskeletal features suggesting a myoid differentiation and function.\r"

  ".W": "A distinctive glomerular lesion of renal allografts, acute allograft glomerulopathy (AAG), is characterized by hypercellularity and endothelial cell hypertrophy and injury. For elucidating the pathogenesis of this lesion, the infiltrating cells were analyzed by light- and electron-microscopic immunoperoxidase techniques with monoclonal antibodies and compared with those in cellular rejection without AAG (non-AAG). Substantial numbers of T lymphocytes (CD3+,Leu-4+) were detected in the glomeruli in AAG (11.4 +/- 2.4 cells per glomerular cross-section), whereas very few were found in non-AAG (1.4 +/- 1.8, P less than 0.001). In AAG the CD8+ (Leu-2a) subset accounted for essentially all of the intraglomerular T cells, which had a lower CD4/CD8 ratio than the corresponding peripheral blood lymphocytes (P less than 0.03). AAG also differed from non-AAG by the accumulation of intraglomerular mononuclear cells that expressed HNK-1 antigen (Leu-7) and mononuclear phagocytes, which were identified by the presence of the monocyte fibronectin receptor (A6F10). Intraglomerular mononuclear cells were positive for the interleukin-2 receptor (IL2R) and HLA Class II antigens (HLA-DR). The glomeruli in AAG stained more intensely for HLA Class I antigens than the tubules, in contrast to non-AAG cases (P less than 0.03). The interstitial infiltrates in AAG grafts were less intense than in non-AAG of similar duration (P less than 0.01) and had a lower CD4/CD8 ratio, whereas arterial intimal infiltrates were more severe in AAG (P less than 0.03) and consisted of CD8+, but not CD4+, cells. Pathologic features that correlated with poor graft survival were increased numbers of intraglomerular CD8+ cells (both AAG and non-AAG), fewer interstitial T cells (AAG), and more interstitial CD8+ cells (non-AAG) (all P less than 0.05). Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection was detected in all (8/8) patients with AAG who were studied for infection before or within 3 weeks after the biopsy, compared with 3 of 9 patients with non-AAG. It is proposed that acute allograft glomerulopathy is a distinct form of T-cell-mediated allograft rejection, sometimes associated with CMV infection, in which the glomerular endothelium, often with the arterial endothelium, becomes the principal target of CD8+ T cells.\r"
