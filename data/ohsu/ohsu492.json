The overall maternal mortality was 17% and the fetal loss 26%; antenatal diagnosis of phaeochromocytoma reduced the maternal mortality to zero and the fetal loss to 15%, but was made in only 53% of the patients. Although phaeochromocytoma is rare, a high index of clinical suspicion must be maintained and all those at risk investigated if earlier diagnosis and improved outcome are to be achieved. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, alpha-blockade is essential and beta-blockade may be required. CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging may be used to localize the tumour during the antenatal period. In the first and second trimesters, tumour resection has a good fetal outcome; in later pregnancy, delivery by elective caesarean section followed by tumour resection is recommended.\r"

Of the 23 women in the trial, 14 reported subjective improvement during treatment with oxybutinin hydrochloride compared with 11 during treatment with propantheline bromide. Apart from a greater increase in the maximum cystometric capacity with oxybutinin, there were no other objective differences between the two drugs. Oxybutinin significantly delayed the first desire to void, increased the maximum cystometric capacity and reduced the maximum detrusor pressure rise on filling. Propantheline significantly increased the maximum cystometric capacity and reduced the maximum detrusor pressure rise on filling. Three patients stopped treatment due to side-effects.\r"

  ".U": "89335672\r", 
  ".W": "Two hundred and forty mildly myopic schoolchildren aged 9-11 years were randomly allocated to three treatment groups and the progression of myopia was followed-up for three years. The treatment groups were: (1) minus lenses with full correction for continuous use (the reference group), (2) minus lenses with full correction to be used for distant vision only, and (3) bifocal lenses with +1.75 D addition. Three-year refraction values were received from 237 children. The differences in the increases of the spherical equivalents were not statistically significant in the right eye, but in the left eye the change in the distant use group was significantly higher (-1.87 D) than in the continuous use group (-1.46 D) (p = 0.02, Student's t test). There were no differences between the groups in regard to school achievement, accidents, or satisfaction with glasses. In all three groups the more the daily close work done by the children the faster was the rate of myopic progression (right eye: r = 0.253, p = 0.0001, left eye: r = 0.267, p = 0.0001). Myopic progression did not correlate positively with accommodation, but the shorter the average reading distance of the follow-up time the faster was the myopic progression (right eye: r = 0.222, p = 0.0001, left eye: r = 0.255, p = 0.001). It seems that myopic progression is connected with much use of the eyes in reading and close work and with short reading distance but that progression cannot be reduced by diminishing accommodation with bifocals or by reading without spectacles.\r"

Evidence of increased pulmonary capillary permeability to transferrin was sought in all patients using a double-isotope method to derive a protein accumulation index (PAI). Using the clinical diagnosis of each type of pulmonary oedema as the \"gold standard\", sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for the chest radiographic scoring system in pulmonary oedema of cardiac origin were 46, 84 and 75%, respectively. For renal patients these values were 63, 86 and 78% and for ARDS, 89, 33 and 77%. For the PAI in ARDS, sensitivity was 85%, specificity 67% and accuracy 86%. The radiographic scoring system failed to distinguish between pulmonary oedema of renal and cardiac origin and cannot be considered of diagnostic value, but it was more successful in assessment of ARDS. Radiographic appearances suggestive of capillary injury and increased capillary permeability to transferrin occurred in all groups and such findings are not specific to ARDS as currently defined.\r"

  ".W": "Scant attention has been paid to the technical aspects of central venous catheter placement in intravenous digital subtraction angiography (IV-DSA). In a prospective study of 200 unselected patients referred for IV-DSA, technical problems and success rates were recorded. Central venous access via an arm vein was achieved in 95% of patients. In 83% of cases, only one venous puncture was required. The commonest single cause for failure was being unable to find, puncture or introduce a guidewire into a suitable calibre vein at the cubital fossa in the first instance. Once entered with a guidewire, the median cubital/basilic route led to successful catheter passage to the superior vena cava (SVC) on 93% of occasions. The equivalent figure for the cephalic route was 80%. Only two out of 129 attempts at which the cephalic vein was entered failed as a result of being unable to negotiate the cephalic/axillary junction. Venous spasm and branch points in the arm were the main problems when using the cephalic vein and these together were responsible for the differences in success rate between the cephalic and basilic routes. The results indicate that in the clear majority of patients referred for IV-DSA, central venous catheter placement is straightforward. The median cubital/basilic route is preferred but even if the cephalic route has to be used, it should still provide access to the SVC in more than three-quarters of cases. Manoeuvres used to overcome access difficulties are discussed and illustrated.\r"

Of 630 patients endoscoped for suspected upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage over a 16-month period, 166 (26 per cent) were found to have a peptic ulcer. Either minor or no stigmata of recent haemorrhage were found in 115 patients at the time of endoscopy. A single peptic ulcer with either active haemorrhage or a visible vessel was found in 51 patients, 43 of whom were entered into the trial. There were eight exclusions: four were inaccessible, one was a torrential haemorrhage and three were excluded for non-technical reasons. Patients were randomized to receive either heater probe (n = 20) or sham (n = 23) therapy. In actively bleeding ulcers, immediate haemostasis was achieved following probe therapy in 14 of 18 patients (78 per cent) compared with none of 21 having sham treatment (P less than 0.002). No rebleeding occurred in the probe therapy group (n = 20) compared with rebleeding in five of 23 sham treated patients (P = 0.05). Urgent surgery for haemostasis was required in three of the five sham treated patients who rebled. It is concluded that heater probe therapy may be effective in reducing rebleeding rates in peptic ulcers accessible to the endoscope.\r"

Nine patients were managed conservatively with resolution of the pseudocyst occurring in eight patients. These patients had significantly smaller (median 4 cm) cysts compared with those in both percutaneously and surgically treated patients (P less than 0.01). In 22 patients the pseudocysts (median 9 cm) were punctured percutaneously under ultrasound guidance and the cyst fluid was aspirated or drained through a catheter. Complete resolution occurred in 13 patients after 1-4 (mean 1.8) punctures per patient, regression occurred in six patients after 1-4 (mean 2.0) puncture procedures per patient and three were unchanged. No complications were noted, except that two patients treated percutaneously required additional surgery. Thirty-seven patients were managed surgically (median cyst size 11 cm) with external drainage (12 patients), cystgastrostomy (17 patients), cystduodenostomy (three patients) cystjejunostomy (three patients) and pancreatic resection (two patients). Resolution of the cyst was noted in 29 patients, regression in five and three were unchanged. Five patients required additional surgery. Twelve complications were seen in ten patients (27 per cent), most frequently after external drainage. One patient died after surgical treatment. Mean hospital stay was 13 days among patients treated conservatively and 30 days in both percutaneously and surgically treated patients. Aspiration or catheter drainage of pseudocyst fluid guided by ultrasonography seems a safe and effective treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts and should be considered as initial therapy. If surgery is required cystgastrostomy is preferred.\r"

  ".W": "Treatment choice in primary breast cancer is wide and still controversial; it seems likely that the optimum treatment for individual patients could be dictated by biological indicators of tumour behaviour. If biopsy could provide prognostic information as well as detailed tissue diagnosis then definitive treatment, with or without adjuvant systemic therapy, could be planned from the outset. We studied 140 patients with a clinical diagnosis of primary breast cancer to determine how much information could be obtained from Tru-Cut needle biopsies performed at the first clinic visit. Ten patients were found to have benign disease. Of 130 carcinomas, 123 (95 per cent sensitivity) were diagnosed correctly from the needle biopsies, with seven false negative and no false positive results (100 per cent specificity). Precise histopathology was predicted in 121 (93 per cent). Grade was correctly assessed in 77 of 112 (69 per cent), but needle biopsy was not accurate for assessment of lymphatic invasion nor elastosis. Steroid hormone receptors were assayed in 59 needle biopsies, and the incidence of oestrogen receptor positivity (34, 58 per cent) was similar to the resected tumours (35, 59 per cent), but the incidence of progesterone receptor positivity (26, 44 per cent) was lower (33, 56 per cent, P less than 0.04). Immunostaining with monoclonal antibody human milk fat globule membrane was accurate in the needle biopsies. DNA analysis by flow cytometry was performed in 37 tumours and the concordance between needle biopsies and resected samples was high. Tru-Cut needle biopsy obviates open biopsy and gives reliable detailed information.\r"

Their median age was 63 years (range 39-82 years). Aortic dilatation was diagnosed in ten of the brothers (29 per cent) and three of the sisters (6 per cent). In ten cases (eight men and two women) there was a localized dilatation caudal to the coeliac axis, and in three a general dilatation of the abdominal aorta with the diameter at the coeliac axis greater than 29 mm. None of the aortic dilatations had been known before this study was performed. The conclusion is that the prevalence of asymptomatic aortic dilatations among brothers of patients with AAAs seems to be high and that this group should be selected for further screening studies.\r"

After surgery, 1148 patients were randomly assigned to adjuvant treatment with progesterone or were given no additional therapy. The duration of follow-up ranged from 42 to 132 months (median follow-up, 72 months). Crude survival and relapse rates were similar for both groups. Death due to intercurrent disease was higher in the progesterone group (P = 0.04). The median survival of the group of patients with cancer-related death was higher in the progestagen group than in the control group (30 and 22 months, respectively; P = 0.03). In 461 high-risk patients, a tendency towards fewer cancer-related deaths and a better disease-free survival in the treatment group was observed, but crude survival was unchanged. We conclude that there is little to gain from adjuvant progestagen therapy in patients with low-risk endometrial cancer, and that further studies are needed in high-risk patients.\r"

Although the pathogenesis of chemotherapy-related thrombotic microangiopathy remains unclear, an elevated von Willebrand factor antigen and pathologic evidence of endothelial hyperplasia in this patient suggest that an abnormality of the endothelium is related to the development of the clinical syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty patients with Stage III non-small cell lung cancer were entered on a trial to evaluate the feasibility of combined radiation and concomitant 5-fluorouracil infusion. Patients had received prior debulking surgery (nine), induction chemotherapy (16), or no therapy (five). Radiation employed standard fractionation (180-200 rad/day) administered to a median cumulative dose of 5500 rad (range, 4500-6200 rad). 5-Fluorouracil was infused 24 hours per day throughout the period of radiation at a dose of 300 mg/m2/day for a median of 42 days (range, 28-56 days). Radiation complications included pneumonitis three of 30 (10%) and esophagitis (27%). Chemotherapy complications included stomatitis, two of 27 (7%), and hand-foot syndrome, three of 30 (10%). Treatment interruptions were necessary in six of 30 (20%) and four of 30 required parenteral nutrition. At a median follow-up of 12 months 26/30 (87%) maintained local control and eight had distant metastases (three of whom presented with Stage IV disease). 5-Fluorouracil delivered continuously throughout standard fractionation radiation to high cumulative doses is feasible and practical. Comparative clinical trials of the various combined radiation and chemotherapy schedules employed are in order. One additional clinical observation was the identification of six of 30 (20%) with brain metastases at presentation or after 12 months, all of whom had adenocarcinoma histologic subtype.\r"

The tumor was 15 x 9 x 8 cm and was confined to the left lateral segment of the liver. Occasional mitotic figures (MF) (2 to 3 per 50 high-power fields [HPF]) were present. Strong, diffuse vimentin positivity was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. Immunoreactivity for cytokeratins (AE1-3), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), desmin, and desmosomal proteins (desmoplakin I + II) was absent. Electron microscopic examination showed a mesenchymal appearance of the majority of neoplastic cells, with a few ultrastructural features suggestive of mesothelial differentiation. These findings supported a submesothelial origin of the tumor. After a partial hepatectomy with total gross and microscopic removal of the tumor, the patient was alive without recurrence at 2 years, 5 months later. A review of the English literature showed six additional cases that are probably similar. Currently, all tumors have been clinically benign, although follow-up information has been limited.\r"

The original test used by Halliday and Miller was modified by substituting tissue extracts with purified tumor antigens (gastrointestinal cancer antigen [GICA]) with the aim of reducing false-positive results in the diagnosis of patients with early pancreatic cancer. By our modified technique, the LAI assay identified four of five pancreatic cancers at an early stage and gave only one false-positive result in 16, showing a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 94%. Later stages of the disease responded poorly on the test. These results were significantly better than those by the CA 19-9 and tissue polypeptide antigen (TPA) tests. Should our findings be confirmed in larger material over a longer follow-up period, the LAI test could be proposed as a useful tool in the early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.\r"

The antiemetic regimens evaluated included the following: metoclopramide (M) at 1, 2, and 4 mg/kg total dose and a combination of M (4 mg/kg) with dexamethasone (D) (40 mg). Vomiting lasting more than 1 hour (no protection [NP]) was the endpoint selected for the analysis. A logistic model carried out, first on the 110 subjects receiving the M + D regimen and then on the whole sample, selected sex (P = 0.0001), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (PS) (P = 0.006), and age (P = 0.01) among the six factors considered. Since the prognostic value of these variables is mostly related to their interaction, three major risk classes were identified. The corresponding NP rates were 26.3%, 42.4%, and 70.8% for the low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups, respectively (P = 0.000002). Except for the lowest M level, the observed NP rates were significantly associated to the risk classes, whereas the antiemetic regimen influenced the antiemetic outcome only in the low-risk class. Regardless of the regimen employed, certain patient characteristics, such as sex, PS, and age, significantly affect cisplatin-related emesis and should be carefully considered in planning further studies.\r"

In three cases, complete remission was obtained with radical radiotherapy; the fourth patient died suddenly of acute laryngeal obstruction. The cases are compared with other reports of laryngeal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in the literature. The biologic behavior of these tumors has many features in common with other extranodal lymphomas arising from mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (e.g., a tendency to remain localized for long periods of time and to disseminate to other extranodal and unusual sites, with good response to radiotherapy for both the primary tumor and extranodal recurrences).\r"

Among the 1042 patients with carcinoma in situ, four neurologic complications occurred (0.4%), including three strokes and one seizure. None of the neurologic complications were related to cervical cancer. Among the 1219 patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) Stage I or greater disease, 99 neurologic complications occurred (8%). Metastatic neurologic complications were twice as common as nonmetastatic neurologic complications and included lumbosacral plexopathy (50 patients), peripheral nerve compressions (eight patients), spinal cord compressions (two patients), and brain metastases (six patients). Nonmetastatic neurologic complications were less frequent and included stroke (11 patients), encephalopathies (three patients), infectious complications (two patients), effects of therapy (six patients), and seizures (11 patients). In conclusion, neurologic complications are rare in cervical cancer and virtually nonexistent in Stage 0 disease. Metastatic neurologic complications were more common than nonmetastatic complications and lumbosacral plexopathy caused by retroperitoneal lymph node metastases was the most common neurologic complication.\r"

Case mothers were more likely to report occupational exposure to metals (odds ratio [OR] = 8.0, P = 0.01), petroleum products (OR = 3.7, P = 0.03), and paints or pigments (OR = 3.7, P = 0.05). Metal exposures were commonly to welding or soldering fumes, and most occurred daily, before and during the index pregnancy. Petroleum product exposures were predominantly to lubricating oils or protective greases. The only significant paternal exposure was to metals (OR = 3.0, P = 0.01) and the risk with exposure to petroleum products was marginally significant (OR = 1.9, P = 0.06). These findings provide further evidence that occupational exposures may increase the risk of cancer in offspring.\r"

Group III received nalbuphine 0.1 mg.kg-1 IV as premedication and isoflurance by inhalation. Mean time to loss of consciousness (71 sec) did not differ among groups. The dosage of thiopentone required to induce loss of consciousness was decreased by 15 per cent (from 3.9 to 3.3 mg.kg-1) by nalbuphine premedication (P less than 0.05), and time to induction of surgical anaesthesia using isoflurane was decreased by 15 per cent (P less than 0.05). The incidence of reflex actions (coughing, laryngospasm, breath holding, hiccoughs and movement) during induction was no different in the saline-premedicated halothane or isoflurane groups. Acute intravenous nalbuphine premedication decreased significantly the incidence of reflex actions during induction of isoflurane anaesthesia from 77 per cent to 37 per cent (P less than 0.02). Desaturation episodes (SaO2 less than 90 per cent) were more frequent with isoflurane inductions compared with halothane (55 per cent vs 17 per cent, P less than 0.01). Apnoeic episodes accounted for the majority of desaturations associated with nalbuphine premedication, while excitatory reflexes (coughing and laryngospasm) accounted for more desaturations with isoflurane alone.\r"

Captopril 1 mg.kg-1 orally was given one hour before induction of anaesthesia. The sodium nitroprusside doses ranged between 0.16 and 3.23 micrograms.kg-1.min-1. Mean arterial pressure was reduced 26 per cent to 46 mmHg during hypotension. It is concluded that for the group as a whole there were no changes in CBF and CMRO2 during hypotension. In one patient, however, critical low CBF measurements were recorded during and after hypotension. This indicates the need for further studies concerning the cerebral haemodynamic consequences of captopril and SNP-induced hypotension.\r"

We followed intrarenal pressure (IRP) in 31 patients who received 32 renal transplants, 12 from living related donors and 20 from cadaveric donors. There were 19 rejection episodes and 10 episodes of transient cyclosporin A (CyA) nephrotoxicity. Nine patients had posttransplant acute renal failure. Levels of IRP (mmHg) in acute rejection were (mean +/- SD) 48.6 +/- 11.1, significantly higher (p less than 0.001) than the levels in CyA nephrotoxicity (28.2 +/- 5.21), acute tubular necrosis (24.5 +/- 5.5) and normal functioning grafts (26.4 +/- 6.63). Antirejection treatment was associated with return to normal of IRP after 10 days. Intrarenal manometry was performed routinely ever 2-3 days in patients who had postoperative acute renal failure. Increments in IRP were detected on the 7-10th postoperative day in 7 patients who had 10-25 days of post-transplant oliguria. Renal biopsy findings were compatible with acute rejection, and the patients responded to intravenous bolus of steroids. We suggest that fine-needle intrarenal manometry is a reliable test for the detection of acute rejection in circumstances when traditional parameters of altered renal function cannot be evaluated.\r"

Prescribed regimens consisted of pinacidil or hydralazine administered four times a day and of secondary drugs administered up to twice daily. Surreptitious pill counts occurred every 1 to 12 weeks. Among a middle-aged subject group that had been selected for high rates of compliance, we observed mean compliance rates that approximated 100%. We noted marked intrasubject and intersubject variability for any one medication, between medications, and over time. From baseline blood pressures (+/- SE) of 155.5 +/- 1.9/97.3 +/- 1.0 mm Hg, subsequent mean blood pressures varied by compliance subgroup: \"hypocompliers\" (less than 80%), 151.3/91.0 mm Hg; \"hypercompliers\" (greater than or equal to 120%), 147.6/91.4 mm Hg; and \"eucompliers\" (80% to 119%), 143.3/88.5 mm Hg (systolic blood pressure: F1,52 = -220.9, NS; diastolic blood pressure: F1,52 = -121.4, NS). We concluded that weekly pill counts indicated marked intersubject and intrasubject variability, obscured by long-term averages; that compliance lapses appeared to be random; and that excessive medication-taking was the most consistent with \"pill dumping.\"\r"

All subjects had a circadian rhythm for GFR with a maximum of 122 ml/min (SD 22) in the daytime, a minimum of 86 ml/min (SD 12) at night and with a relative amplitude of 33% (SD 15). 3. ERPF had a circadian rhythm with a similar relative amplitude as the GFR rhythm, but with a different phase. Because of this difference in phase, the calculated filtration fraction (GFR/ERPF) followed a circadian rhythm as well. 4. The circadian rhythms of urine volume and sodium excretion were in phase with the GFR rhythm, but the potassium rhythm had a different phase, probably because urinary potassium is largely derived from tubular secretion. 5. Urinary albumin and beta 2-microglobulin excretion had a circadian rhythm in phase with the GFR rhythm. 6. The highest quantity of sodium, water and beta 2-microglobulin was reabsorbed in the daytime; tubular reabsorption, expressed as percentage of the filtered load (fractional reabsorption), had a rhythm with a reversed phase.\r"

The response consists of an early, vasodilatory, increase in flow and is followed by a decrease in flow relative to control, thought to be mediated by myogenic contraction of resistance vessels. 3. Methodological constraints with the technique of forearm plethysmography have to date precluded an individual beat-by-beat examination of this response, in particular for resolving the question of the immediate flow pattern after release of venous occlusion. It has been suggested by Caro, Foley & Sudlow [Journal of Physiology (London) (1970), 207, 257-269] that there is a delay of up to five systolic beats before vasodilatation takes place, leading to their suggestion that the vasodilatation is passive and secondary to an increased flow through emptied capacitance vessels. 4. The introduction of peripheral Doppler techniques has led us to re-examine this response in an attempt to define short-term resistance vessel behaviour on a beat-by-beat basis. 5. Our data confirmed the hypothesis of Caro, Foley & Sudlow [Journal of Physiology (London) (1970), 207, 257-269] that there is a constant and definite latency preceding the onset of vasodilatory flow, as reflected by changes in Doppler velocities.\r"

The insulin-stimulated rates of lactate formation and glycogen synthesis were similar in muscles isolated from control and bacteraemic rats. 3. Endotoxaemia increased the rates of lactate formation, at all levels of insulin, both at 24 h (approximately 32%) and 48 h (approximately 26%). Endotoxaemia did not alter the sensitivity of glycolysis to insulin. 4. Endotoxaemia decreased the rates of glycogen synthesis at all concentrations of insulin both at 24 h (approximately 39%) and 48 h (approximately 23%). 5. The increase in the rate of glycolysis was related in a dose-dependent manner to the amount of endotoxin given to the animals. 6. Endotoxaemia decreased plasma tri-iodothyronine levels (41%). However, the effects of endotoxaemia (48 h) on glucose metabolism in muscle are similar to those caused by hyperthyroidism. In hypothyroid rats, endotoxin administration increased the rates of glycolysis in muscle in vitro. 7. It is concluded that there are enhanced basal and insulin-stimulated rates of glycolysis in soleus muscle from endotoxaemic rats. This may be due to both increased glucose transport and decreased glycogen synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "1. Canine obstructive lymphoedema was created in one hind leg of 30 dogs by irradiation of the groin and surgical removal of surviving lymph glands and lymphatics. The opposite leg served as a control. Once the oedema had stabilized, groups of 10 dogs were treated orally with 12.5 mg day-1 kg-1 for 8 months with either one of the benzopyrones coumarin (2H-1-benzopyran-2-one) and 7-hydroxycoumarin (7-hydroxy-2H-1-benzopyran-2-one), or placebo. 2. The two benzopyrones significantly (P less than 0.01) but gradually reduced the oedema by 20-30% over 8 months, as judged by circumferential measurements of the oedematous and control limbs. There was no change with the placebo. 3. In the oedematous fluids (lymph and interstitial fluid), benzopyrone treatment reduced the protein content and increased acid and neutral proteinase activity compared with the control limbs, while the levels of the proteinase inhibitor alpha 2-macroglobulin remained unchanged. Furthermore, these active drugs reduced the excess water content, thickness and hydroxyproline content of skin biopsies from oedematous limbs compared with those from control limbs. No changes were observed for the placebo group. 4. These biochemical changes suggest that benzopyrones can reduce the excess proteinaceous fluid in lymphoedema by increasing the levels of proteinase activity relative to the number of proteinase inhibitors. As a secondary event the amount of fibrosis in the skin is also reduced, presumably by an increase in collagenase activity from the mononuclear phagocytes. 5. These results support the hypothesis that benzopyrones activate the production of proteinases by mononuclear phagocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "1. To investigate whether carbohydrate contributes to postprandial hypotension in autonomic failure, the cardiovascular, biochemical and hormonal effects of oral glucose and an iso-osmotic solution of oral xylose were studied on separate occasions in six patients with chronic autonomic failure. The effects of oral glucose were also studied in eight normal subjects. 2. In the patients oral glucose lowered blood pressure substantially (-34 +/- 7% at 60 min, area under curve -24.9 +/- 3.5%, P less than 0.001) and for a prolonged period (-25 +/- 4% at 120 min). Plasma noradrenaline levels did not change. In the normal subjects blood pressure was unchanged and plasma noradrenaline rose, suggesting a compensatory increase in sympathetic nervous activity. 3. In the patients xylose caused a smaller and more transient fall in blood pressure (-15 +/- 6% at 90 min, area under curve -8.9 +/- 4%, P less than 0.05) with a non-significant elevation in packed cell volume (36.7 +/- 1.8 to 38.2 +/- 1.8). It was therefore unclear if xylose was exerting osmotic effects within the bowel which contributed to the small blood pressure fall. Packed cell volume did not change in either the patients or normal subjects after glucose. 4. In the patients and normal subjects plasma insulin rose after glucose. Insulin levels were unchanged after xylose. Levels of pancreatic polypeptide and neurotensin, a potential vasodilator, rose in the patients only. The latter rose to a similar extent after both glucose and xylose, making it unlikely that neurotensin alone accounted for the hypotension. 5. These studies indicate that the carbohydrate components of a meal, and in particular those causing insulin release, contribute to postprandial hypotension in patients with autonomic failure.\r"

In order to better define this problem, a questionnaire was sent to members of the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons regarding patients with gastrointestinal anastomotic stenosis. A total of 123 patients with intestinal anastomotic stenosis were analyzed. Eighty-two anastomoses were stapled and 41 were handsewn. Nearly all stenoses occurred in the distal bowel (70 rectal, 23 sigmoid colon). Preoperative risk factors identified were obesity (28 patients) and abscess (12 patients). Incomplete \"doughnuts\" were noted in 12 patients. Postoperative anastomotic leaks (15 patients), pelvic infection (13 patients), and postoperative radiation (7 patients) were believed to be contributing factors. Dilatation, using a variety of techniques, was the sole treatment for 65 patients, however, intra-abdominal surgery was necessary in 34 patients. Large intestinal anastomotic stenosis probably occurs most commonly following coloproctostomy (both with handsewn and stapled anastomoses). Dilatation alone resulted in adequate treatment in most patients in the study. Major surgery was required to correct this problem in a significant number of patients (28 percent) in this series. The true incidence of anastomotic stenosis in colorectal surgery is unknown and warrants further study.\r"

Vascular invasion has two distinct components: blood vessel invasion and lymphatic vessel invasion. The use of elastic tissue stains enhance both the detection of blood vessel invasion and its differentiation from lymphatic vessel invasion. Almost all series report an increased incidence of blood vessel invasion with increasing stage and grade. Although the influence of blood vessel invasion and lymphatic vessel invasion on patterns of failure is variable, both are associated with a decrease in survival; however, treatment recommendations based solely on the presence of blood vessel invasion or lymphatic vessel invasion should be made with caution.\r"

  ".W": "Growth hormone (GH) hypersecretion in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) subjects has been shown to be causally related to early-morning hyperglycemia. We studied the effect of nocturnal GH suppression on acute glycemic control in six IDDM patients during a constant overnight insulin infusion (0.075 mU.kg-1.min-1). In control experiments (infusion of insulin alone), plasma glucose increased from 5.6 +/- 0.6 mM at 2400 to 11.1 +/- 1.3 mM at 0900 (P = .0024). When in addition the cholinergic muscarinic antagonist pirenzepine was given (100 mg at 2200 and again at 2400), plasma glucose increased from 5.6 +/- 0.3 mM at 2400 to 8.4 +/- 1.4 mM at 0900 (P greater than .05). The nocturnal surges of GH that were demonstrated in all patients during the control nights were suppressed during the treatment nights. There were no significant changes in insulin, cortisol, or epinephrine concentrations. Mean glucagon and norepinephrine concentrations. Mean glucagon and norepinephrine concentrations were reduced from 127 +/- 2.7 ng/L and 8.7 +/- 0.5 nM to 101 +/- 1.9 ng/L (P less than .001) and 3.5 +/- 0.2 nM (P less than .001) on control and treatment nights, respectively. Neither glucagon nor norepinephrine concentrations changed significantly between 2400 and 0900 on either control or treatment nights. We conclude that nocturnal GH suppression by pirenzepine during a constant low-rate insulin infusion is associated with an attenuation of the early-morning plasma glucose rise.\r"

Ten patients entered the study, and 5 completed all three 8-mo study periods. When results from the infusion study period were compared with results from the period involving single daily injections of ultralente insulin, significant improvements were noted in the pump arm in glycosylated hemoglobin concentrations (which were nearly normal), M-component values, mean daily outpatient fasting blood glucose concentrations, mean fasting and 24-h blood glucose concentrations during an inpatient 24-h glycemic profile, and urinary glucose concentrations. When the pump arm was compared to a period of single daily injections of lente insulin, three of six monthly mean fasting blood glucose concentrations and overall means for the entire study period were significantly lower during the pump arm than during the lente arm; in addition, significantly fewer hypoglycemic reactions were noted during infusion therapy than during lente therapy. Finally, mealtime free-insulin and C-peptide excursions appeared to be greater during infusion treatment when compared with lente or ultralente treatment. In the 50% of patients who completed the study, it appeared that significant improvements in glycemic control could be achieved by simple basal-rate intravenous insulin infusion compared with conventional treatment with single daily injections of ultralente or lente insulin without an increased incidence of symptomatic hypoglycemia.\r"

Male and female rat pituitaries were fixed by brief transcardial perfusion of Bouin Hollande Sublimate solution. Immunoperoxidase staining of cryosections obtained from female pituitaries with an antiserum to rat skeletal muscle peptidylarginine deiminase yielded specific staining of numerous cells in the pars distalis. In contrast, few immunopositive cells were noted in the pars distalis of male pituitaries. At least some of the immunopositive cells in female pars distalis were also stained with an antiserum to rat PRL. No such coincidence of immunoreactivities was noted when antisera to other anterior pituitary hormones were used. Biochemical and immunocytochemical examination of peptidylarginine deiminase during the pregnant period revealed its marked depletion on day 7 and its substantial restoration on day 14, showing apparently negative correlation with the known changes in the secretory activities of lactotrophs. This and the female-dominant occurrence of peptidylarginine deiminase in lactotrophs suggest significant involvement of the enzyme in the function of lactotrophs.\r"

Cartilage progenitor cells were cultured in the form of a tissue culture on top of collagen sponges in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and were treated with 50 ng/ml GH for 6 days. Three-day incubation with GH caused a marked increase in DNA synthesis and in the size of the culture, which developed into a nodule of differentiated chondrocytes and a well developed perichondrial layer around it. The effect of GH was even more pronounced after 6 days in culture; at which time a distinct network of trabeculae was noted throughout the extracellular matrix. The trabeculae contained osteocyte-like cells and were in close contact with both osteoblast-like and osteoclast-like cells. Using antibodies against bone-specific antigens, i.e. osteocalcin and osteopontin, provided further support for the notion that the newly formed trabecular formation was comprised of bone matrical components. Untreated control cultures lacked such structures, but contained hyaline-like cartilage. It, therefore, seems reasonable to suggest that GH induces a strong stimulatory effect on progenitor cell proliferation, cartilage differentiation, and extracellular mineralization, which supports de novo bone formation in vitro.\r"

Variables included the concentration of calf serum (CS) from 0% (0.2% BSA) to 5% and the addition of insulin or insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I); stimulation was by TSH, with some experiments using thyroid-stimulating antibody-immunoglobulin G. The basal rate of incorporation of [3H]thymidine and the content of DNA per well were enhanced progressively by the increasing concentration of CS, whether in a pretreatment period of 3 days or over a subsequent 2 days of incubation. Concomitantly, I- uptake was progressively inhibited. Stimulation of growth by TSH required serum and was greatest with 5% CS; TSH effect on I- uptake was progressively decreased by increments of CS. Insulin and IGF-I had effects comparable to each other, but much smaller concentrations of IGF-I were required; they both augmented growth and enhanced growth stimulation by TSH. These actions were progressively annulled by increasing concentrations of CS. I- uptake (basal and stimulated) was inhibited by insulin and IGF-I, but this inhibitory effect was abolished by CS, particularly at 5% concentrations. Overall, the influences of varying the concentrations of CS and the effects of insulin or IGF-I were consistent; if there was enhancement of growth stimulation, there was inhibition of the TSH effect on I- uptake. Underlying mechanisms for these observations have yet to be elucidated.\r"

The basic form of FGF (bFGF) had an ED50 of 110 pg/ml, while the acidic form had an ED50 of 3.5 ng/ml. The mitogenic effect of FGF was blocked by transforming growth factor-beta. OGE cells express the gene encoding bFGF. The bFGF gene is transcribed into 7.0- and 3.7-kilobase mRNA transcripts, which are translated into 18,600 mol wt bFGF-like growth factor. OGE-derived bFGF is bioactive and stimulates the proliferation of capillary endothelial cells or OGE cells. This mitogenic effect is prevented by specific neutralizing anti-bFGF antibodies. Our results indicate that bFGF derived from OGE cells can act as both autocrine and paracrine growth factor for that cell type, and they further suggest that the factor may be involved in the development of early follicles.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of testosterone to quantitatively restore spermatogenesis in rats made azoospermic by active immunization against LH or GnRH was examined. Sexually mature adult male rats (n = 15/group) were actively immunized against ovine LH or GnRH-human serum globulin conjugate, while control rats (n = 10) were injected with saline. After 10 weeks of immunization, five rats per group were euthanized. For each rat, trunk blood was collected for determination of LH, FSH, and testosterone by RIA; seminiferous tubule fluid (STF) was collected from one testis per rat, and testosterone concentration was measured by RIA; the number of advanced spermatids per testis was determined from the contralateral testis. The results obtained after 10 weeks of treatment were as follows. 1) Serum LH and FSH were undetectable by RIA in GnRH-immunized rats. 2) Serum testosterone was undetectable in both the LH- and GnRH-immunized groups. 3) The testosterone concentration in STF (STF-T) was reduced from the control value of about 64 ng/ml to about 2 ng/ml in the LH- and GnRH-immunized rats. 4) LH- and GnRH-immunized rats were azoospermic. After the initial 10-week treatment period, five rats in each of the LH- and GnRH-immunized groups received 24-cm testosterone-filled polydimethylsiloxane (PDS-T) capsules (3 x 8 cm long) sc. The remaining immunized rats (n = 5/group) received empty capsules. Two months later, all rats were euthanized. Testis weights, serum testosterone, and STF-T concentrations remained significantly reduced in LH- and GnRH-immunized rats that did not receive testosterone supplementation, and the rats remained azoospermic. STF-T concentrations rose significantly (P less than 0.05) in the LH- and GnRH-immunized rats that received PDS-T, but were still significantly less (by approximately 80%) than the concentration in intact controls. Nonetheless, implantation of PDS-T caused restoration of advanced spermatogenic cells in the testes of both LH- and GnRH-immunized rats to numbers that were not significantly different from the number in controls. These data indicate that 1) testosterone is capable of quantitatively restoring spermatogenesis in rats actively immunized against LH or GnRH, suggesting that FSH may not be required for the restoration of spermatogenesis in adult rats; and 2) quantitatively complete restoration of spermatogenesis can occur at STF-T concentrations that are significantly reduced compared to those in intact controls.\r"

To determine whether a change and/or abnormality in the circulating or adrenal renin-angiotensin systems are responsible for these observations, three groups of animals were studied on a low sodium diet with and without the administration of a converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril). Sprague-Dawley and Wistar-Kyoto (normotensive rat strains) and SHR were placed on low sodium (0.1%) for 9 days, the last 4 days of which enalapril was administered to half of the animals. In all groups enalapril treatment resulted in a significant (P less than 0.001) reduction in blood pressure, an increase in renin activity, and a reduction in plasma aldosterone when all of the animals were considered together, although the change in blood pressure achieved statistical significance only in the Wistar-Kyoto rats. Additionally, basal aldosterone output from isolated glomerulosa cells was lower in the normotensive animals pretreated with enalapril. However, despite the evidence for inhibition of converting enzyme, there was no change in the hypertensive animals. Thus, neither locally nor systemically generated AII appear to participate in the maintenance of the increased aldosterone responsiveness to AII with sodium restriction. Furthermore, they do not appear to contribute to the altered adrenal responsiveness to AII with sodium restriction in SHR. These data provide further support for the hypothesis that as yet undefined glomerulosa intracellular mechanisms are altered by dietary sodium restriction in normotensive, but not hypertensive, rats.\r"

We presented evidence that cAMP is the proximal mediator of these actions of TSH. To further define the mechanism of this interaction, we investigated the effects of IGF-I on TSH stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. Long and short term effects of IGF-I or high doses of insulin were studied in FRTL-5 cells that were maintained in serum-, hormone-, and growth factor-free medium for 4-7 days (basal cells). When cells were incubated with high doses of insulin for 7 days and acutely stimulated, a 10-fold increase in sensitivity and a 2-fold increase in maximal responsiveness of cAMP accumulation to TSH were observed. To study shorter term effects, cells were preincubated with insulin for 3 h and then exposed to TSH, cholera toxin, or forskolin. Incubation with high doses of insulin for 3 h caused 30-300% increases in cAMP accumulation at high doses of TSH (greater than or equal to 1 mU/ml), cholera toxin (greater than 0.1 microM), and forskolin, but did not affect the EC50 for TSH. Dose-response studies were consistent with insulin acting via receptors for IGF-I, and IGF-I caused a similar effect. There was a 45% increase in adenylyl cyclase activity stimulated by TSH in membranes isolated from cells incubated with high doses of insulin for 3 h. Pretreatment of FRTL-5 cells with pertussis toxin, which ADP-ribosylates the inhibitory G-protein Gi, or adenosine, which we show inhibits cAMP accumulation by interacting with Gi, did not affect insulin/IGF-I enhancement of cAMP accumulation. We suggest that synergism of actions of TSH and IGF-I may in part be due to IGF-I enhancement of TSH stimulation of adenylyl cyclase.\r"

  ".W": "Bilateral adrenalectomy (ADRX) in rats removes the source of two major stress-responsive hormones, corticosterone and epinephrine. To test how ADRX rats withstand stress, we performed the following experiments in adult male rats provided with indwelling femoral arterial and venous cannulae and either ADRX or sham-adrenalectomized (Sham) 3 days later and given 0.5% NaCl to drink. Five to 6 days after adrenal surgery the rats were studied after either a 15 ml/kg.5 min hemorrhage or after an overnight fast followed by insulin-induced hypoglycemia. In fed unstressed ADRX rats, basal mean arterial blood pressure was slightly decreased; heart rate was increased; blood volume, vasopressin, and oxytocin concentrations were not different from sham values; and renin and norepinephrine were significantly elevated. The recovery of arterial pressure after hemorrhage in the ADRX rats was similar to that in the sham group over a 5-h period; however, the responses of vasopressin and oxytocin were significantly greater, and those of renin and norepinephrine were markedly potentiated in the ADRX group. Heart rate recovered faster in the ADRX group and was elevated, compared to the sham value, for most of the 5-h period. Restitution of blood volume was attenuated in the ADRX group, although the restitution of plasma protein was not different between the groups. A significant difference in the change in plasma osmolality between groups after hemorrhage may account for the attenuated restitution of blood volume. After an overnight fast, which reduced blood volume in both groups of rats, the plasma renin concentration rose still further in ADRX rats; the differences in other measured variables observed between fed ADRX and sham groups remained the same. The insulin-induced 50% decrease in glucose caused minor effects on arterial blood pressure and heart rate and occasioned responses in renin and norepinephrine of similar magnitudes in the two groups. We conclude that in the absence of the adrenals, rats restore arterial pressure after hemorrhage remarkably well through potentiation of the responses of other vasoactive neural and hormonal systems. In these studies the marked potentiation of the renin response suggests that the renin-angiotensin system may be important in the maintenance of arterial blood pressure after reductions in blood volume.\r"

The removal of insulin from calvaria incubated for 24 h with 3 nM insulin caused collagen synthesis and the level of alpha-1(I) procollagen mRNA to return to control values within 5 h. Adding insulin back to calvaria withdrawn from insulin treatment for 3 h did not rescue the decay in collagen synthesis or the level of alpha-1(I) procollagen mRNA. Insulin increased the steady state levels of alpha-1(I) procollagen mRNA in the presence of the RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin-D. Our data suggest that in fetal rat bone, one mechanism by which insulin increases the steady state level of alpha-1(I) procollagen mRNA may be by altering its stability.\r"

We observed the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of a 195K protein (pp195) in extracts prepared from rat skeletal muscle and liver. pp195 copurifies with the insulin receptor on wheat germ agglutinin affinity chromatography. pp195 is not related to the insulin receptor, as assessed by lack of recognition by antinsulin receptor antibodies and by phosphopeptide mapping. Reduction of sulfhydryl bonds does not affect its apparent mol wt. Phosphorylation of pp195 has an absolute requirement in vitro for Mn2+ or Mg2+ and for certain basic poly-amino acids, i.e. poly-L-lysine or poly-L-ornithine. In the presence of 1 microM poly-L-lysine insulin stimulates pp195 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (k0.5, approximately 5 x 10(-10) M; maximum approximately 10(-8) M insulin); pp195 phosphorylation by insulin-like growth factor-I requires about 100-fold higher doses. By phosphoamino acid analysis, pp195 is predominantly phosphorylated on tyrosine, and it is recognized by antiphosphotyrosine antibodies. Insulin receptors isolated from rat muscles 5 min after insulin injection induce about 2-fold greater phosphorylation of pp195 in vitro than receptors isolated from saline-injected controls. Streptozotocin-induced diabetes results in marked diminution of insulin-stimulated pp195 phosphorylation in extracts of muscle and liver (approximately 50% when normalized to protein content of wheat germ agglutinin eluates or approximately 80% reduction when normalized to equal receptor number). The defect is reversible by insulin therapy in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "In this study we have examined the effects of insulin on protein synthesis in cultured fetal chick neurons. Protein synthesis was monitored by measuring the incorporation of [3H]leucine (3H-leu) into trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-precipitable protein. Upon addition of 3H-leu, there was a 5-min lag before radioactivity occurred in protein. During this period cell-associated radioactivity reached equilibrium and was totally recovered in the TCA-soluble fraction. After 5 min, the incorporation of 3H-leu into protein was linear for 2 h and was inhibited (98%) by the inclusion of 10 micrograms/ml cycloheximide. After 24 h of serum deprivation, insulin increased 3H-leu incorporation into protein by approximately 2-fold. The stimulation of protein synthesis by insulin was dose dependent (ED50 = 70 pM) and seen within 30 min. Proinsulin was approximately 10-fold less potent than insulin on a molar basis in stimulating neuronal protein synthesis. Insulin had no effect on the TCA-soluble fraction of 3H-leu at any time and did not influence the uptake of [3H]aminoisobutyric acid into neurons. The isotope ratio of 3H-leu/14C-leu in the leucyl tRNA pool was the same in control and insulin-treated neurons. Analysis of newly synthesized proteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that insulin uniformly increased the incorporation of 14C-leu into all of the resolved neuronal proteins. We conclude from these data that 1) insulin rapidly stimulates overall protein synthesis in fetal neurons independent of amino acid uptake and aminoacyl tRNA precursor pools; 2) stimulation of protein synthesis is mediated by the brain subtype of insulin receptor; and 3) insulin is potentially an important in vivo growth factor for fetal central nervous system neurons.\r"

  ".W": "As an initial attempt to identify early steps in insulin action that may be involved in the growth responses of neurons to insulin, we investigated whether insulin receptor activation increases the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 in cultured fetal neurons and whether activation of a protein kinase is involved in this process. When neurons were incubated for 2 h with 32Pi, the addition of insulin (100 ng/ml) for the final 30 min increased the incorporation of 32Pi into a 32K microsomal protein. The incorporation of 32Pi into the majority of other neuronal proteins was unaltered by the 30-min exposure to insulin. Cytosolic extracts from insulin-treated neurons incubated in the presence of exogenous rat liver 40S ribosomes and [gamma-32P]ATP displayed a 3- to 8-fold increase in the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 compared to extracts from untreated cells. Inclusion of cycloheximide during exposure of the neurons to insulin did not inhibit the increased cytosolic kinase activity. Activation of S6 kinase activity by insulin was dose dependent (seen at insulin concentration as low as 0.1 ng/ml) and reached a maximum after 20 min of incubation. Addition of phosphatidylserine, diolein, and Ca2+ to the in vitro kinase reaction had no effect on the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6. Likewise, treatment of neurons with (Bu)2cAMP did not alter the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 by neuronal cytosolic extracts. We conclude that insulin activates a cytosolic protein kinase that phosphorylates ribosomal S6 in neurons and is distinct from protein kinase-C and cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Stimulation of this kinase may play a role in insulin signal transduction in neurons.\r"

Ampullar and isthmic tissue from ovariectomized animals primed with 17 beta-estradiol or vehicle alone was examined. As expected, in the absence of estradiol, PR-IR was rarely observed in the ampulla. Estradiol treatment increased PR-IR in cell nuclei of the stroma and muscularis of the ampulla, but not of the epithelium. In contrast, PR-IR was seen in epithelial cell nuclei of the isthmus in the absence of estradiol. Surprisingly, while estradiol treatment increased PR-IR in cell nuclei of the stroma and muscularis of the isthmus, it decreased PR-IR in the epithelium. These results suggest for the first time a differential regulation of progestin receptors in the ampulla and isthmus of the oviduct. In particular, while estradiol treatment increased PR-IR in the stroma and muscularis and was without effect on PR-IR in the epithelium of the ampulla, it decreased PR-IR in the epithelium of the isthmus.\r"

Sodium depletion and beta-adrenergic blockade can increase plasma prorenin in cats, but the effects of sedatives and glucocorticoids are unknown. We examined the effect of ketamine, a centrally acting nonbarbiturate anesthetic, and of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone on plasma prorenin and renin. Intramuscular injection of ketamine (20 mg/kg, three times a day) for 4 days increased plasma prorenin slowly and consistently, from 7.4 +/- 1.4 (+/- SEM) to 11.4 +/- 2.2, 17.1 +/- 2.5, 20.2 +/- 3.0, and 29.2 +/- 3.4 ng/ml.h (P less than 0.001) on days 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, without any effect on plasma active renin. Plasma renin substrate and cortisol were also unchanged. Bilateral nephrectomy reduced both baseline and stimulated plasma prorenin to undetectable levels. Treatment with alpha 1-blocker, beta 1-blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or Ca2+ antagonist did not affect the rise in prorenin induced by ketamine, but dexamethasone completely blocked the response. In contrast, dexamethasone alone had little effect on plasma prorenin. These results demonstrate that repetitive ketamine administration selectively increases plasma prorenin, suggesting that renal prorenin secretion may be regulated independently of active renin. Blockade of stimulated, but not baseline, plasma prorenin by dexamethasone is consistent with a negative effect of glucocorticoids on the regulatory elements of the renin gene.\r"

  ".W": "The rat chorioallantoic placenta is comprised of two morphologically distinct regions: the junctional zone and the labyrinth zone. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the relative contributions of trophoblast cells in each of these regions to the expression of placental lactogen-II (PL-II) and PRL-like protein-A (PLP-A) during development, mRNA expression was estimated by Northern blot analysis, whereas, protein expression was estimated by electrophoresis, immunoblotting, and immunocytochemical analyses. The immunochemical analyses used antipeptide antisera directed to amino acids 56-70 of PL-II and amino acids 152-164 of PLP-A. Northern and immunoblotting analyses indicated that both PL-II mRNA and protein expression were maximal in the junctional zone on day 13 of gestation and declined as gestation proceeded. In contrast, PL-II mRNA and protein expression in the labyrinth zone were low on day 13 and increased as gestation advanced. PL-II was specifically localized to giant cells. At midgestation, PL-II-positive giant cells were identified bordering the uterine decidua in the junctional zone and choriovitelline placenta. As gestation advanced. PL-II-positive cells were also localized to the labyrinth zone. Immunoreactivity was restricted to the cytoplasm of PL-II-positive cells. PLP-A mRNA and protein were predominantly expressed in the junctional zone of the chorioallantoic placenta. Expression of PLP-A increased as gestation advanced. PLP-A was specifically localized to giant and spongiotrophoblast cells of the junctional zone. Immunoreactivity was found in both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments of PLP-A-positive cells. In summary, PL-II expression shifts from the junctional to the labyrinth zone during pregnancy, whereas PLP-A is predominantly expressed in the junctional zone during the latter third of pregnancy. Both hormones are produced by giant cells of the junctional zone, but only PL-II is expressed by choriovitelline and labyrinthine trophoblast cells. PLP-A is also expressed by spongiotrophoblast cells of the junctional zone. These findings provide insights into the process of placental morphogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "We have used the method of electropermeabilization to measure the dependence of PTH secretion on internal calcium concentration in adult bovine parathyroid cells. The dose-response curve is biphasic, with a peak at 10(-7) M calcium. This result differs significantly from the dose-response curves that have been determined by this method for many other secretory systems, where secretion requires much more calcium and the dependence of secretion on calcium is monotonic. Guanine nucleotide analogs did not modify the calcium dose-response curve of PTH secretion in the electropermeabilized parathyroid cells. The unique properties of adult parathyroid cell secretion are analogous to the unique properties of parathyroid calcium-activated potassium channels, which differ from calcium-activated potassium channels of other cells in that they open at unusually low calcium concentrations and have a peak open probability at about 10(-7) M calcium. We suggest that the opening of these channels in secretory vesicles is required for secretion.\r"

  ".U": "89338278\r", 
  ".W": "Insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) effects on protein phosphorylation were investigated in intact skeletal muscle cells at different stages of differentiation. In undifferentiated L6 myoblasts, stimulation by either insulin or IGF-I, but not IGF-II, led to a 3- to 5-fold increase in phosphorylation of insulin and IGF receptor beta-subunits and the appearance of a 175,000 mol wt (Mr) phosphoprotein (pp175). These effects reached a maximum within 3 min, were maintained for 12 min, and then declined. Dose-response curves for pp175 phosphorylation in response to insulin (ED50 = 2 nM) and IGF-I (ED50 = 0.2 nM) were consistent with occupancy and stimulation of each receptor kinase by its specific hormone. The 175,000 Mr phosphoprotein was not precipitated by antireceptor antibodies, and the phosphoamino acid composition differed markedly from that of insulin and IGF-I receptors, with a 10-fold lower phosphotyrosine/phosphoserine ratio after insulin stimulation. In contrast to insulin and IGF-I receptors, pp175 was not extracted by the nonionic detergent Triton X-100, but required sodium dodecyl sulfate for solubilization. When experiments were carried out with L6 cells after differentiation into skeletal muscle myotubes, hormone-induced phosphorylation of pp175 was almost undetectable. We conclude that pp175 is a phosphoprotein distinct from insulin and IGF-I receptors that is involved in the early phosphorylation events that follow the activation of the insulin and IGF-I receptor kinases. Its disappearance after terminal differentiation of the L6 cells is consistent with a role in hormonal stimulation of cell proliferation.\r"

  ".U": "89338289\r", 
  ".W": "Estrogen has been shown to induce a rapid transient increase in c-myc mRNA in the rat uterus. However, no studies of the cell specificity of c-myc expression in the uterus have been reported, and nothing is known about the expression of c-myc in response to other steroids or during normal uterine preparation for implantation. To this end, the cell type-specific localization of c-myc protein was determined in the ovariectomized mouse uterus after progesterone (P4) and/or 17 beta-estradiol (E2) injection as well as during the periimplantation period. After E2 injection, a rapid accumulation of c-myc protein was detected exclusively in the uterine luminal and glandular epithelial nuclei in the ovariectomized mouse. Essentially all of these cells contained immunoreactive c-myc by 12 h postinjection. In contrast, after P4 injection, rapid accumulation of c-myc was noted exclusively in some of the stromal cell nuclei. Pretreatment of the ovariectomized mouse for 4 days with P4 (P4 priming) followed by E2 injection resulted in an increase in the number of c-myc-positive stromal cells, but few, if any, c-myc-positive cells were detected in the luminal and glandular epithelia. These uterine cell type-specific localizations of c-myc protein, induced by E2 or P4 injection, were followed within 18-24 h by DNA synthesis ([ 3H]thymidine incorporation) restricted to the epithelia or stroma, respectively. c-Myc was detected in the nuclei of luminal and glandular epithelia during proestrus and on days 1 and 2 of pregnancy, a period when the uterus is under the influence of estrogen. c-Myc-positive cells were detected in the stroma on day 3, and by day 4 a large number of stromal cell nuclei were c-myc positive. These changes are coincident with increasing P4 levels during early pregnancy. At the implantation chamber on day 5, many cells in the primary decidual zone as well as some of the deeper stromal cells were c-myc protein positive, whereas on day 6, c-myc protein was detected only in the secondary decidual zone. During this period of uterine preparation for embryo implantation and subsequent decidualization, there was a positive correlation between c-myc protein localized in specific populations of uterine cells and subsequent DNA synthesis in those cell types. Thus, both E2 and P4 induce cell type-specific accumulation of c-myc protein in the uterus of the ovariectomized mouse, with E2 induction of c-myc being restricted to epithelia, and P4 induction restricted to stroma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Three-hundred fifty-two biopsy specimens were obtained prospectively from 26 patients (8 sprue, 2 nonspecific changes, 16 normal) with \"jumbo\" and standard forceps from jejunum, ligament of Treitz, fourth, third, and second portions of the duodenum. There was no difference in biopsy specimen quality from different locations. All celiac sprue patients had at least one good or excellent specimen from each location, thereby allowing the diagnosis to be made equally well from second, third, and fourth portions of the duodenum, as well as at the ligament of Treitz and jejunum. No false-positive diagnoses of celiac sprue were made. Finally, the standard biopsy forceps provided good or excellent specimens in all patients.\r"

Over a 6-month period, 40 consecutive patients were treated for esophageal and rectal cancers or for benign tumors too large to be removed with a diathermy snare. All of the patients who were offered this treatment had been assessed as unsuitable for surgery and radiotherapy. Twenty patients were randomly assigned to the coaxial fiber group and 20 patients to the naked fiber group. Before treatment, patients in the two groups were not different with respect to age, sex, kind of tumor, contraindication for surgery and radiotherapy, luminal patency, and tumor circumferential extent. At the end of the treatment, the endoscopic score, the transit score, and the evolution of rectal hemorrhage and mucous secretions were not different between the two groups. The number of treatments required to achieve the maximal endoscopic benefit was 6.7 +/- 4.9 (range, 2 to 20) (median = 5) in the coaxial fiber group and 3.4 +/- 1 (range, 2 to 5) (median = 3) in the naked fiber group (p = 0.01). Treatment tolerance and complications were not different between the two groups, but the financial cost related to the fiber was lower in the naked fiber group than in the coaxial fiber group. Therefore, we recommend the contact method using the naked fiber inserted into the tumor in endoscopic Nd:YAG laser therapy for gastrointestinal tumors.\r"

In five patients with achalasia, a periesophageal tumor was reliably excluded by EUS. In one of four patients with Barrett's esophagus, EUS demonstrated a small (less than 1 cm) carcinoma that could not be visualized with any conventional technique. For differentiation of cancer recurrence after operation from periesophageal scar tissue EUS-guided transmural biopsies are needed. Our experience shows that at the present time EUS is the most reliable method to demonstrate small (less than or equal to 1 cm) intra- and extramural esophageal lesions and that it should therefore be applied early in the work-up of patients with dysphagia.\r"

Six patients, five with Crohn's disease and one with radiation enteropathy were studied. Five patients had a jejunostomy and one an ileostomy. The patients had a normal food intake, but because of severe malabsorption had received home parenteral nutrition for several years. Faecal mass was reduced (p less than 0.005) and intestinal net sodium absorption was increased (p less than 0.005) by intravenous infusion of SMS 25 micrograms/h. Net absorption of potassium, calcium, magnesium phosphate, zinc, nitrogen and fat was not influenced. Subcutaneous injections of 50 micrograms SMS every 12 hours had a similar effect on net intestinal absorption of sodium and water. Four patients continued with a five to six months open follow up study when subcutaneous SMS in the same dose was administered by the patients at home. The effect on faecal sodium loss persisted, but in one patient faecal mass gradually increased and finally exceeded pretreatment values. SMS may decrease net absorption of water and sodium following reduced secretion of digestive juices rather than by increasing absorptive capacity. SMS may be useful as an antidiarrhoeal drug in patients with high output jejuno- or ileostomies, but in patients who need permanent parenteral nutrition the effect is too small to significantly alter management.\r"

Endoscopic findings were prospectively collected by a multicentre group in 75 patients with Crohn's colitis according to a previously validated procedure. The presence of nine preselected lesions was recorded in the following segments (1) rectum, (2) sigmoid and left colon, (3) transverse colon, (4) right colon, and (5) ileum. In addition the extent of the diseased and ulcerated areas were estimated in each segment. These segmental data were recorded on a standard form, together with the endoscopist's global estimate of lesion severity. A stepwise multiple regression was used to derive an index which was correlated with the endoscopist's global evaluation of lesion severity. Four mucosal lesions: deep and superficial ulcerations, ulcerated and non-ulcerated stenosis, and both estimates of extent involved were selected and weighted to obtain a Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity which correlated with the endoscopist's global appraisal of lesion severity (r = 0.83). This index was then prospectively shown to be valid in a further series of 113 colonoscopies (r = 0.81). The index was calculated in 54 patients with active Crohn's disease, before and at the end of a course of corticosteroids: index variations correctly reflected changes in colitis severity as evaluated by the endoscopists (r = 0.72). For endoscopists familiar with the data collection procedure, this Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity should be of value in the follow up of patients, especially in clinical trials.\r"

  ".W": "This study measured the liver blood flow-dependent index of galactose clearance in patients after liver transplantation, to test the hypothesis that liver blood flow is increased in the denervated liver. Eight normal subjects and 16 patients 1 to 8 months after liver transplant were studied. All patients were stable with no evidence of severe rejection at the time of study. Galactose clearance was measured at steady state during continuous infusion of 75 mg per min of 5% galactose. The results show a statistically significant (p less than 0.01) higher average galactose clearance in the transplant patients (1,187 +/- 316 ml per min per m2) compared to the control group (709 +/- 121 ml per min per m2). The major limiting factor in galactose clearance at low concentrations is liver blood flow, and we interpret these data as evidence for increased blood flow in the transplanted liver. Possible mechanisms for the increased galactose clearance are (i) loss of normal vasomotor tone in the denervated liver, or (ii) persistence of abnormal systemic hemodynamics after transplantation. Elucidation of these mechanisms awaits further study.\r"

  ".W": "Storage of donor livers in Euro-Collins solution for human transplantation surgery is limited to about 8 hr. Here, tissue damage to isolated rat livers stored under the same conditions as human livers was characterized following reperfusion. The purpose of this work was to determine the importance of nutritional status on injury due to cold storage and reperfusion, to establish whether lethal injury occurs during cold storage or only after reperfusion, and to identify the cell types most vulnerable to damage. Rat livers were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit-bicarbonate buffer, stored 8 to 48 hr in Euro-Collins solution and reperfused with warm, oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit buffer for 15 min. Nuclear trypan blue uptake and lactate dehydrogenase release were used as indices of cell death. After 8 hr of cold storage and reperfusion, little loss of parenchymal or nonparenchymal viability occurred. After 24 or 48 hr, virtually all parenchymal cells remained viable. However, severe damage to nonparenchymal cells was observed, and about 40% of nonparenchymal cells were trypan blue positive. Nutritional status (fed vs. fasted) did not affect the extent of cell damage. Nonparenchymal cell killing was accompanied by cellular rounding, nuclear pyknosis and protrusion of cells into sinusoidal lumens. Scanning electron micrographs demonstrated denudation of the sinusoidal lining. Rounding and pyknosis were not observed in 24-hr-stored livers which were not reperfused, and trypan blue uptake did not occur in stored livers infused with cold, anoxic Euro-Collins solution. Based on cytochemistry and electron microscopy, lethal cell injury occurred predominantly to endothelial cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Treated patients cleared hepatitis B virus markers after a mean interval of 4 months, compared with 8 months in the controls. All responders to interferon cleared intrahepatic HBcAg, and 50% showed histological improvement. The baseline hepatitis B virus DNA levels and the original histology were not predictive of a response to therapy; women appeared to respond better than men. Lymphoblastoid interferon provides an effective therapy in the heterosexual Italian patient with chronic hepatitis B.\r"

Six of the 42 male homosexuals (14.3%) had at least one serological marker of hepatitis delta virus infection (hepatitis delta antigen, total and/or IgM anti-hepatitis delta antibodies). Serological follow-up was obtained for five of these patients over several months and confirmed the chronicity of the delta infection in at least four of the five subjects. Hepatitis delta antigen and hepatitis delta virus RNA were found in the liver and in the serum, respectively, of four of the five tested patients. Hepatitis B virus DNA was negative in the serum of five of the six hepatitis delta virus-positive homosexuals vs. only eight of 35 hepatitis delta virus-negative homosexuals (p less than 0.02). Human immunodeficiency virus was negative in all of the nonhomosexuals; its prevalence did not differ between the hepatitis delta virus-positive and -negative homosexuals: three were human immunodeficiency virus-positive among the six former vs. 15 among the 36 latter. Human immunodeficiency virus positivity was without obvious influence on hepatitis B virus replication, since among 35 hepatitis delta virus-negative homosexuals hepatitis B virus DNA was found in 80% of the human immunodeficiency virus-positive individuals and 70% of those who were human immunodeficiency virus-negative.\r"

  ".W": "Certain evidence suggests androgen dependence of hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotic patients. Consequently, it was postulated that antiandrogen therapy might be effective in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. D-Tryptophan-6-luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone is a potent agonist analog of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone which, when chronically administered, inhibits the pituitary gonadal axis and testicular androgen secretion in man. We studied the effects of D-tryptophan-6-luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone on tumoral growth in 17 male cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. After 3 to 6 months of therapy, no tumoral response was observed. Furthermore, measurements of plasma levels of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, androstenedione, estradiol, estrone and sex hormone-binding globulin were performed before and 3 months after initiation of the antiandrogenic treatment. Before treatment, hypoandrogenism and hyperestrogenism were present; D-tryptophan-6-luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone induced a fall in plasma testosterone and dihydrotestosterone levels. Only a moderate decrease in estradiol and no modification of plasma estrone and sex hormone-binding globulin were found, indicating that the hyperestrogenemia of cirrhotic patients could be attributed to an increase in peripheral aromatization of androgens of adrenal origin. The inability of D-tryptophan-6-luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone to reduce the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma is not totally in disagreement with the concept of androgen dependence of hepatocellular carcinoma since D-tryptophan-6-luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone does not inhibit the production of androgens of adrenal origin.\r"

  ".U": "89339405\r", 
  ".W": "Ten patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, three of whom had pulmonary metastasis, were treated with adoptive immunotherapy using autologous lymphokine-activated killer cells plus recombinant interleukin 2. Patients received 15 micrograms per day of recombinant interleukin 2 consecutively (for 14 to 64 days), from Day 7 prior to the first leukapheresis, and received 10(9) to 10(10) lymphokine-activated killer cells once or twice per week intravenously; the lymphokine-activated killer cells had been generated from mononuclear cells obtained through leukapheresis. Preadministration of recombinant interleukin 2 prior to the first leukapheresis resulted in a remarkable increase of lymphokine-activated killer activity in seven of nine cases in whom lymphokine-activated killer activity had been poorly inducible even at high concentrations of recombinant interleukin 2. At the end of the treatment, liver tumor regression (34 and 63%, respectively, of two-dimensional size) was observed in two of two patients with a solitary tumor; no increase of liver tumor size was observed in seven patients with massive or multiple tumors, and no changes in the size or number of pulmonary metastatic tumors in any patients were observed. More than a 35% decrease in serum alpha-fetoprotein level was noted in four of nine alpha-fetoprotein-positive patients. However, Child's grades, performance status and lymphokine-activated killer activity on entry into the study could not be used as parameters to predict therapy responsiveness. Neither serious side effects nor significant changes of serum bilirubin, ALT and creatinine were noted. Thus, this treatment seems to be well tolerated even in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with poor liver function reserve, and tumor regression could be expected in small-burden hepatocellular carcinoma. The assessment of the therapeutic effects and application in hepatocellular carcinoma awaits the development of this trial.\r"

At the end of this period, rats receiving the somatostatin analogue had a lower plasma insulin concentration (52 +/- 4 vs. 70 +/- 6 microunits/ml, p less than 0.01) and a lower blood pressure (133 +/- 2 vs. 150 +/- 2 mm Hg) than did the rats infused with the control solution. In addition, the increase in plasma triglyceride concentration in response to the fructose-enriched diet was significantly attenuated (p less than 0.001) in the rats infused with somatostatin. These data provide further support that the increase in blood pressure that occurs when normal rats are fed a high fructose diet is dependent on the ability of this intervention to cause insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia.\r"

DHE is a potent agent (i.e. affinity value less than 100 nM) at 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A), 5-HT1C, 5-HT1D, 5-HT2, dopamine2, alpha1- and alpha2-adrenergic binding sites. DHE displays moderate affinity (i.e. affinity values = 100 - 1000 nM) for beta-adrenergic and dopamine1 sites and is completely inactive at 5-HT3, muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors. These results were then compared to similar data on sumatriptan (formerly called GR 43175), a novel acute anti-migraine agent. The only pharmacological property shared by both agents is high affinity for 5-HT1D and 5-HT1A receptors. Therefore, these data suggest that 5-HT1D and/or 5-HT1A receptors may play an important role in the pathophysiology of migraine.\r"

Ten of 12 patients, eight of 14 patients, and 20 of 23 patients showed improvement, with all studies finding verapamil significantly more effective than placebo in migraine prophylaxis. Research comparing 240 mg/day with 320 mg/day dosing found 320 mg/day significantly more effective in reducing migraine frequency. Review of 133 refractory headache-clinic patients, treated with verapamil and additional drugs reported excellent (100% improvement) or good results (greater than 50% reduction in migraine frequency) in 5% and 40% of patients, respectively. Fair response (less than 50% improvement) was observed in 50% of patients, and poor response was seen in 5% of patients. Analysis of this information reveals that verapamil is a safe, well-tolerated and effective agent for migraine prophylaxis.\r"

Behavioral therapies for the management of chronic headache have emerged as a significant option over the last decade. Initial studies summarized in two previous reviews of behavioral therapy for pediatric headache were favorable, but few controlled studies had been done. In the last five years, more studies, the majority with controlled comparisons, have been published. The present review summarizes and interprets the evidence from these studies. Behavioral treatment appears to be a potent alternative for the management of chronic headache in children.\r"

Pain scores before and after 20 minute treatments of individual headaches as well as patient and physician global evaluations were the primary efficacy variables. Following use of the active unit, patients reported an average reduction in pain intensity of approximately 35%. Placebo patients reported a reduction of approximately 18%. The difference was statistically significant (p = 0.01). The active unit was rated as moderately or highly effective in 40% by physicians, and in 36% by patients. Both physicians and patients scored the placebo unit moderately or highly effective for only 16%. The difference in ordered outcomes was statistically significant (p = 0.004). Approximately 10% of patients in each group reported at least one minor adverse experience. Cranial electrotherapy stimulation is distinct from TENS, and is safe and often effective in ameliorating the pain intensity of tension headaches. It should be considered as an alternative to the chronic usage of analgesics.\r"

The development of neurotransmitter and modulator systems is a plastic process with individual temporal characteristics for each system. These characteristics include the synthesis, degradation, or uptake of neurochemicals and, largely independently, the appearance of their receptors. Message transmission during ontogeny is compounded by the variable development of these systems and by the coexistence and cofunction among these chemicals. Nine neurochemical systems are discussed: adenosine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, opioids, prostaglandins, serotonin, progesterone, substance P, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, and the catecholamines. The possible role of each of these in natural perinatal respiratory control is evaluated according to predetermined criteria. These include the presence of a substance system in respiratory-related regions, physiologically appropriate changes in its concentration in these regions, elicitation of respiratory effects by agonists and antagonists, and abolition with an antagonist of the effect of a substance during its presumed activation by a physiological process. It is suggested that excessive levels of suppressant neuromodulators or an imbalance among neurochemicals can partly explain the special features of respiratory control in the perinatal period.\r"

Muscle biopsy samples from the deltoid muscle of the nondominant arm in untrained (n = 12) and strength-trained (n = 12) subjects were compared. The strength-trained muscles were characterized by a tendency to a higher percentage of type I fibers (67 vs. 59%), a lower percentage of type IIb fibers (12 vs. 18%), 34% larger mean fiber areas, and 19% more capillaries per fiber (P less than 0.1). No difference was noted in levels of enzymes representing the citric acid cycle, fatty acid oxidation, and glycolysis, nor in the number of capillaries per square millimeter. Neither did the levels of malate-aspartate and alpha-glycerophosphate shuttle enzymes nor cytochrome b5 reductase differ. Levels of cytochrome b5 reductase correlated (r = 0.59, P less than 0.01) with levels of the mitochondrial marker enzyme citrate synthase. It is concluded that strength training does not appear to result in increased levels of NADH shuttle enzymes and cytochrome b5 reductase.\r"

Immobilization decreased the activity of citrate synthase and 3-OH-acyl-CoA-dehydrogenase in the vastus lateralis muscle by 9 and 14%, respectively, and thigh volume by 5%. After 7 days of immobilization, a two-step euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp procedure combined with arterial and bilateral femoral venous catheterization was performed. Insulin action on glucose uptake and tyrosine release of the thighs at mean plasma insulin concentrations of 67 (clamp step I) and 447 microU/ml (clamp step II) was decreased by immobilization, whereas immobilization did not affect insulin action on thigh exchange of free fatty acids, glycerol, O2, or potassium. Before and during the clamp step I, lactate release was significantly higher in the immobilized than in the control thigh. Seven days of one-legged immobilization causes local decreased insulin action on thigh glucose uptake and net protein degradation.\r"

To evaluate the possibility that airway epithelium represents a barrier to movement of prostacyclin (PGI2), an important bronchodilator synthesized by isolated airway, we measured the concentrations of 6-oxoprostaglandin F1 alpha (6-oxo-PGF1 alpha), the stable degradation product of PGI2, on the mucosal and serosal sides of isolated canine tracheal segments (CTS) mounted in Ussing chambers. 6-oxo-PGF1 alpha was measured by radioimmunoassay after purification by high-performance liquid chromatography. The concentration of 6-oxo-PGF1 alpha was significantly higher on the serosal than the mucosal side of CTS (1,262 +/- 252 vs. 390 +/- 168 pg.min-1.g-1, n = 8, P less than 0.05). A significant correlation was present between 6-oxo-PGF1 alpha measured on both sides of each CTS (r = 0.778, n = 26, P less than 0.01). 6-oxo-PGF1 alpha production from CTS stripped of mucosa was significantly greater than from isolated mucosa. Radiochromatograms obtained after incubation with [3H]arachidonic acid and calcium ionophore A23187 confirmed PGI2 as the predominant cyclooxygenase product of the submucosa, whereas the mucosa produced only small amounts of PGI2 in proportion to other cyclooxygenase products. PGI2 (10(-8) to 10(-6) M) applied to the mucosal surface of closed tracheal segments precontracted with histamine resulted in no significant relaxation, whereas serosal application showed a concentration-dependent effect. Radiolabeled 6-oxo-PGF1 alpha did not cross the isolated epithelium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because of recent reports that NE caused prostacyclin (PGI2) release from systemic arteries, we wondered whether NE caused pulmonary vascular PGI2 release and whether a feedback mechanism existed whereby PGI2 modulated NE-induced vasoconstriction. NE-induced PGI2 synthesis in rat main pulmonary artery rings was larger than that induced by KCl, passive stretch, or a thromboxane analogue, was alpha-adrenergic receptor dependent, and was enhanced by endothelium removal. The NE-induced PGI2 synthesis was not tightly coupled to the magnitude of the pulmonary artery ring contractile response, and inhibition of NE-induced PGI2 production by cyclooxygenase blockade in either the pulmonary artery ring preparation or in isolated rat lungs perfused with a physiological solution did not augment the magnitude of the contractile response. We concluded that NE is a potent stimulus for PGI2 synthesis in the rat main pulmonary artery ring and in the rat lung, yet PGI2 is not important as a modulator of NE-induced vasoconstriction in the rat lung.\r"

The device is designed to subject living cells to reproducible and quantifiable biaxial strains from 0 to 10% at rates from quasi-static to 1 s-1 and frequencies from 0 to 5 Hz. Equations for determining the strain in the substrate upon which the cells are grown, based on easily measured parameters, are derived and validated experimentally. The mechanical properties of the substrate are determined, and it is demonstrated that cells can easily be cultured in the apparatus. By use of the system, cloned bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cell clones are subjected to 5% biaxial strains applied at a peak strain rate of 0.5 s-1 and a frequency of 1 Hz for 7 h with cell viability greater than 84% and cell detachment less than 8%. We demonstrate that cells must be attached to the substrate for them to be stretched and that cell strain and substrate strain are not equal. With the use of fluorescently labeled beads as cell surface markers to measure the actual strain produced in the cells as a result of the deformation of the substrate, cell elongation was found to be approximately 60% of the strain in the substrate. This constant appeared to be affected by both in vitro cell age and morphology.\r"

Naturally labeled [13C]glucose was used to follow the conversion of the ingested glucose to expired-air CO2. Total carbohydrate oxidation (indirect calorimetry) was similar in the three protocols (A, 237 +/- 20; B, 258 +/- 17; C, 276 +/- 20 g/4 h), as was lipid oxidation (A, 128 +/- 4; B, 132 +/- 15; C, 124 +/- 12 g/4 h). Exogenous glucose oxidation rates were similar under the three experimental conditions, and the total amount of exogenous glucose utilized was slightly, but not significantly, increased with the more diluted solution (A, 42.6 +/- 4.4; B, 43.4 +/- 4.1; C, 48.7 +/- 7.2 g/4 h). The blood glucose response was similar in the three protocols. Thus, within the range investigated, the osmolality of the glucose solution ingested had no significant influence either on its oxidation (which was 86-98% of the load ingested) or on the utilization of endogenous carbohydrate, lipid, or protein stores.\r"

Enzyme activities of citrate synthase (CS), lactate dehydrogenase (LD), 3-OH-acyl-CoA-dehydrogenase (HAD), and myokinase (MK) were assayed on freeze-dried dissected pools of slow-twitch (ST) and fast-twitch (FT) fiber fragments by fluorometric means.

CS and HAD activities were lower (P less than 0.05), and LD and MK were higher (P less than 0.05) in FT than ST fibers in the entire subject pool (n = 20). CS of FT fibers and HAD of ST fibers were lower in athletes (P less than 0.05-0.01) compared with nonathletes, whereas LD of both fiber types was higher (P less than 0.05-0.001) in athletes. CS activity of ST fibers and MK activity of FT fibers were higher (P less than 0.05) in BB compared with OL/PL. FT and ST fiber area was greater (P less than 0.05) in athletes than in nonathletes. BB displayed greater (P less than 0.05) fiber size than OL/PL. FT/ST area was greater (P less than 0.05) in OL/PL than BB. It is suggested that long-term heavy-resistance training results in specific metabolic adaptations of FT and ST fiber types. These changes appear to be influenced by the type of resistance training.\r"

These complications were caused by migration of the caudad hook into the spinal canal. The migration was probably caused by a combination of lumbosacral lordosis and mobility of the fifth lumbar vertebra (the most caudad mobile segment) on the segment below, resulting in weakening of the lamina of the fifth lumbar vertebra. After removal of the hardware, all patients had improvement of the lumbosacral and radicular pain as well as resolution of the neurological abnormalities.\r"

A free tissue flap was the preferred form of soft-tissue coverage. The osseous reconstruction was accomplished by using a massive amount of autogenous cancellous bone graft. Beads that were made from polymethylmethacrylate and impregnated with two antibiotics at the time of operation were used as soft-tissue spacers to preserve the volume of the diaphyseal defect for later receipt of the cancellous bone graft. The beads prevented the soft-tissue flap from collapsing into and adhering to the site of the tibial defect. The beads also served as vehicles for local delivery of the antibiotics that they contained. When the soft-tissue flap had healed, the beads were replaced with cancellous graft. All of the tibiae healed. The time to healing averaged nine months. The average duration of external fixation was 5.5 months. One deep infection developed, but resolved after debridement and antibiotic therapy. This conservative technique is safe and reliable for patients who have sustained a high-energy tibial fracture and a large segmental diaphyseal defect.\r"

Thirteen of the subjects received the orally active opioid antagonist naltrexone immediately before the race. The mean plasma melatonin, cortisol, and beta-endorphin levels were higher after the race than before it; the melatonin results were confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry assay of 12 subjects. Naltrexone had no effect on the increase in any of the three hormones. The run-induced increases in plasma melatonin, beta-endorphin, and cortisol were negatively correlated with finishing time, but only the plasma beta-endorphin and cortisol rises correlated with each other. We conclude that prolonged exercise in trained athletes can increase plasma melatonin and that this rise is not due to the concomitant opioid release.\r"

The stressor consisted of intraoral injections of a local anesthetic solution (with or without EPI) just before the surgical extraction of impacted third molars in 26 awake unsedated patients. The EPI group experienced a 30-fold increase in plasma EPI levels by 2 min after injection; these concentrations were physiologically active, as evidenced by increased pulse rate and systolic blood pressure. However, compared to a no EPI control group the EPI group had a significantly reduced i beta END response to the stressor, as evaluated by comparison of plasma levels at individual time points, maximal increases in plasma i beta END levels, and areas under the time-response curve. Whereas there was no association between plasma levels of EPI and i beta END in the EPI group (r = 0.119; P = NS), EPI and i beta END levels were strongly related in the no EPI group (r = 0.82; P less than 0.001). These results do not support the hypothesis of a stimulatory effect for EPI on i beta END release and, instead, suggest that an inhibitory relationship may exist in humans experiencing stress. The association between EPI and i beta END responses observed in the control group during this form of stress appears to be due to activation of a common central neural element.\r"

To further explore HPA system integrity in major depressive disorders, 13 drug-free patients and normal subjects matched for age, sex, ovarian status, and body weight received 100 micrograms synthetic human CRH as an iv bolus dose. Compared to that in the normal subjects, in the depressed patients a significant attenuation of the net ACTH release after CRH administration (772 +/- 597 vs. 263 +/- 286 pmol/min.L; P less than 0.02) was observed, while beta-endorphin and cortisol responses did not differ significantly between the groups. The magnitudes of ACTH and cortisol release were negatively correlated in the patient group only (r = -0.67; P less than 0.01). Thus, the blunted ACTH response to CRH in depression might be related to hypercortisolemia, while the implications of the apparent dissociation of ACTH and beta-endorphin after CRH administration still remain unclear. Our data support the hypothesis that the hyperactivity of the HPA system in depression most likely is a consequence of CRH hypersecretion, the origin of which may be explained by abnormal central glucocorticoid receptor or neurotransmitter regulation.\r"

The timing of initiation of the infusion was varied to differentiate effects of time of day from effects of duration of the infusion. A nocturnal elevation of glucose levels, culminating around midsleep and corresponding to an increase of about 15% above daytime levels, was observed in all subjects. The timing of this nocturnal maximum was not dependent on the rate of the infusion or on the time elapsed since the beginning of the infusion. Insulin levels did not show a consistent diurnal pattern. Both insulin and glucose exhibited large ultradian oscillations recurring at 100- to 150-min intervals. The amplitude of these oscillations increased with the rate of glucose infusion. These ultradian oscillations of glucose and insulin levels were temporally correlated, with a tendency for glucose pulses to lead insulin pulses by 15-30 min. These results demonstrate in normal subjects the existence of a diurnal variation in glucose tolerance distinct from the dawn phenomenon observed in diabetic subjects and indicate that spontaneous 100- to 150-min oscillations in peripheral glucose and insulin levels characterize stimulated pancreatic function, with the amplitude of the oscillations being dependent on the size of the stimulus.\r"

The human pituitary SP receptor bound SP and two of its analogs, [D-Tyr0]SP and [D-Tyr0,Nor,Leu11]SP, with similar affinities (Kd, 1.76 X 10(-8), 3.53 X 10(-8), and 1.93 X 10(-8) mol/L, respectively). The fragments SP-(3-11) and SP-(7-10) had lower affinities for the receptor than SP (Kd, 9.24 X 10(-8) and 2.86 X 10(-7) mol/L, respectively). SP-(5-8) and SP-(1-4) were poorly bound by the receptor (Kd, greater than 10(-6) mol/L). The progressive decrease in binding with the removal of amino acid residues from the N- or C-termini of the molecule is similar to that observed in the rat. GnRH and TRH did not compete for the SP-binding sites. SP was able to inhibit GnRH-stimulated LH secretion from cultured human pituitary cells in a dose-dependent manner, while having no effect on GnRH-stimulated FSH secretion. Basal release of TSH, PRL, GH, and ACTH was unaffected by SP. These findings suggest that SP may have a physiological role in the regulation of LH secretion in man.\r"

  ".W": "Antiinsulin receptor antibodies were detected in the serum of a patient with insulin-resistant diabetes. Fasting hypoglycemia and postprandial hyperglycemia recurred every day. The plasma insulin level was 553 +/- 359 pmol/L [77 +/- 50 microU/mL (mean +/- SD)] in the fasting state and rose above 7500 pmol/L postprandially. The glycemic clamp at 2.8 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) without insulin infusion revealed that the half-life of plasma endogenous insulin was 173 min, indicating severely impaired plasma insulin clearance. During the clamp the glucose infusion rate was almost constant (0.9-1.2 mg/kg.min) despite an exponential decline in the plasma insulin level from 460 pmol/L (65 microU/mL) to 129 pmol/L (18 microU/mL). Intravenous insulin administration did not appreciably accelerate the basal constant decrease in the plasma glucose level during the postabsorptive period. These results indicate the coexistence of marked insulin resistance and constant ability to decrease plasma glucose level. In in vitro experiments, antireceptor immunoglobulin G from this patient increased the fructose 2,6-bisphosphate concentration in the presence of glucagon (less than 0.1 nmol/L) in primary cultured rat hepatocytes. The antireceptor immunoglobulin G stimulated autophosphorylation of rat liver insulin receptor. We conclude that antiinsulin receptor antibodies could impair plasma insulin clearance, resulting in persistent hyperinsulinemia, and that continuous receptor stimulation by the antibodies was responsible for the development of hypoglycemia.\r"

  ".W": "The quantitative contribution of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide [gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP)] to the incretin effect after oral glucose (augmentation of insulin secretion over the degree that is explained by the glycemic rise) is not known. Therefore, hyperglycemic clamp experiments (8 mmol/L, corresponding to postprandial glucose concentrations) were performed in healthy volunteers, and synthetic human GIP was infused for 60 min at a rate (approximately 1.3 pmol/kg.min) that results in plasma GIP concentrations similar to those occurring after oral glucose loads of 75 g. The MCR for exogenous GIP was approximately 6 mL/kg.min; the decay after ceasing infusion was exponential with a t1/2 of about 18 min, and the resulting volume of distribution was about 140 mL/kg. At euglycemic (basal) plasma glucose concentrations (5.0 mmol/L) similar values were found. Insulin secretion was stimulated by hyperglycemia alone, but was greatly (2.3-fold based on C-peptide) potentiated by GIP infusions (P less than or equal to 0.001 for integrated incremental values). When integrated incremental responses over 120 min of GIP, immunoreactive insulin, and immunoreactive C-peptide were compared after oral glucose and during GIP infusions, no significant differences were found. Peak glucose concentrations after oral glucose (7.6 +/- 0.6 mmol/L) were similar to mean plasma glucose values during clamp experiments (8.2 +/- 0.1 mmol/L; P = 0.124). However, mean glucose concentrations after oral glucose were lower (6.0 +/- 0.3 mmol/L; P = 0.0004). Additional infusion of sulfated cholecystokinin-8 (25 pmol/kg.h) or the amino acid phenylalanine (1.7 mumol/kg.min) did not further stimulate insulin secretion and had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of exogenous GIP. It is concluded that human synthetic GIP is insulinotropic in man and that this activity may well explain a substantial part of the incretin effect after oral glucose. There is no interaction with cholecystokinin or phenylalanine in concentrations found after mixed meals.\r"

The dose of SMS 201-995 was increased from 300 micrograms/day to a maximum of 600 micrograms/day when the mean serum GH (hourly samples for 12 h) failed to be suppressed to undetectable levels in over 75% of the samples. Five patients received a 200-micrograms sc injection q8h (600 micrograms/day), and the other 5 received sc injections q2h [418 +/- 46 micrograms/day (mean +/- SE); range, 288-504 micrograms/day]. In the group receiving q2h sc SMS 201-995 there was a marked suppression of mean GH from a basal level of 77.3 +/- 24.7 mU/L to less than 5 mU/L in all five subjects. In the group receiving q8h sc SMS 201-995, mean GH was suppressed from a basal level of 82.2 +/- 21.7 to 15.4 +/- 3.3 mU/L after 6 months of therapy, and none of the patients had a mean GH level consistently less than 5 mU/L. Despite the difference in the level of GH suppression, mean serum somatomedin-C levels were decreased promptly in both groups of subjects. Associated with the decrease in somatomedin-C levels there was a marked clinical response in both groups, but improvement in clinical features and decreases in hand volumes and ring size occurred earlier in the group receiving SMS 201-995 q2h. Significant tumor shrinkage (25% to greater than 50% reduction) was observed in two patients receiving q2h injections, while a 25-50% reduction in tumor size was noted in another patient receiving q8h injections. Because of the small doses of SMS 201-995 used side-effects of abdominal discomfort and flatulence were mild and rapidly disappeared. Our results show that increasing the frequency of sc administration of the somatostatin analog from q8h to q2h leads to more marked and consistent suppression of GH levels and more rapid improvement of clinical signs. Increasing the frequency of delivery of SMS 201-995 may be an alternative to increasing the dose in some patients with acromegaly.\r"

Epinephrine (50 ng/kg per min) was infused either alone or combined with propranolol (beta-blockade) into groups of six subjects fasted overnight; leucine flux, oxidation, and net plasma leucine forearm balance were determined during 180 min. Constant plasma insulin and glucagon concentrations were maintained in all studies by infusing somatostatin combined with insulin and glucagon replacements. Plasma leucine concentrations decreased from baseline during epinephrine infusion by 27 +/- 5 mumol/liter (P less than 0.02) due to a 22 +/- 6% decrease in leucine flux (P less than 0.05 vs. controls receiving saline) and to an increase in the metabolic clearance rate of leucine (P less than 0.02). Leucine oxidation decreased by 36 +/- 8% (P less than 0.01 vs. controls). beta-Blockade abolished the effect of epinephrine on leucine flux and oxidation. Net forearm release of leucine increased during epinephrine (P less than 0.01), suggesting increased muscle proteolysis; the fall of total body leucine flux was therefore due to diminished proteolysis in nonmuscle tissues, such as splanchnic organs. Nonoxidative leucine disappearance as a parameter of protein synthesis was not significantly influenced by epinephrine. Plasma glucose and FFA concentrations increased via beta-adrenergic mechanisms (P less than 0.001). The results suggest that elevation of plasma epinephrine concentrations similar to those observed in severe stress results in redistribution of body proteins and exerts a whole body protein-sparing effect; this may counteract catabolic effects of other hormones during severe stress.\r"

  ".W": "At least two genetically distinct glucose transporters (GTs) coexist in adipose cells, one cloned from human hepatoma cells and rat brain (HepG2/brain) and another from rat skeletal muscle, heart, and adipose cells (adipose cell/muscle). Here we demonstrate differential regulation of these two GTs in adipose cells of diabetic and insulin-treated diabetic rats and compare changes in the expression of each GT with marked alterations in insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity. Adipose cell/muscle GTs detected by immunoblotting with the monoclonal antiserum 1F8 (James, D. E., R. Brown, J. Navarro, and P. F. Pilch. 1988. Nature (Lond.). 333:183-185), which reacts with the protein product of the newly cloned adipose cell/muscle GT cDNA, decrease 87% with diabetes and increase to 8.5-fold diabetic levels with insulin treatment. These changes concur qualitatively with previous detection of GTs by cytochalasin B binding and with insulin-stimulated 3-O-methylglucose transport. Northern blotting reveals that the adipose/muscle GT mRNA decreases 50% with diabetes and increases to 6.8-fold control (13-fold diabetic) levels with insulin treatment. In contrast, GTs detected with antisera to the carboxyl terminus of the HepG2 GT or to the human erythrocyte GT show no significant change with diabetes or insulin treatment. The HepG2/brain GT mRNA is unchanged with diabetes and increases threefold with insulin treatment. These results suggest that (a) altered expression of the adipose cell/muscle GT forms the molecular basis for the dysregulated glucose transport response to insulin characteristic of diabetes, (b) the expression of two types of GTs in rat adipose cells is regulated independently, and (c) alterations in mRNA levels are only part of the mechanism for in vivo regulation of the expression of either GT species.\r"

[125I-Tyr]Somatostatin-14 (S-14), 125I-insulin, and 125I-glucagon were incubated with monolayer cultures of neonatal rat islet cells. Tissues were processed for quantitative electron microscopic autoradiography by the probability circle method coupled to morphometry. For all three radioligands and all three cell types surface labeling was rapidly followed by internalization of the radioligands into endocytotic vesicles. The further intracellular movement of the ligand occurred in a time- and temperature-related manner and depended on whether it was homologous or heterologous for the cell in question. Thus [125I-Tyr]S-14 in B and A cells, 125I-insulin in A and D cells, and 125I-glucagon in B and D cells were rapidly transferred from endocytotic vesicles to lysosomal structures. By contrast, [125I-Tyr]S-14 in D cells, 125I-insulin in B cells, and 125I-glucagon in A cells showed poor progression from endocytotic vesicles to downstream vesicular structures. We conclude that (a) each of the three radioligands is internalized by islet cells in a time- and temperature-dependent manner; (b) after initial internalization the further intracellular progression of the endocytosed radioligand occurs freely in cells heterologous for the radioligand but poorly in cells homologous for the radioligand; and (c) binding and endocytosis can be uncoupled from lysosomal degradation of ligand.\r"

Because C1 inhibitor (C1-Inh) regulates the activation of both cascade systems, we studied the characteristics of plasma C1-Inh in 48 patients with severe sepsis on admission to the Intensive Care Unit at the Free University of Amsterdam. The ratio between the level of functional and antigenic C1-Inh (functional index) was significantly reduced in the patients with sepsis compared with healthy volunteers (P = 0.004). The assessment of modified (cleaved), inactive C1-Inh (iC1-Inh), and complexed forms of C1-Inh (nonfunctional C1-Inh species) revealed that the reduced functional index was mainly due to the presence of iC1-Inh. On SDS-PAGE, iC1-Inh species migrated with a lower apparent molecular weight (Mr 98,000, 91,000, and 86,000) than native C1-Inh (Mr 110,000). Elevated iC1-Inh levels (greater than or equal to 0.13 microM) were found in 81% of all patients, sometimes up to 1.6 microM. Levels of iC1-Inh on admission appeared to be of prognostic value: iC1-Inh was higher in 27 patients who died than in 21 patients who survived (P = 0.003). The mortality in 15 patients with iC1-Inh levels up to 0.2 microM was 27%, but in 12 patients with plasma iC1-Inh exceeding 0.44 microM, the mortality was 83%. The overall mortality in the patients with sepsis was 56%. We propose that the cleavage of C1-Inh in patients with sepsis reflects processes that play a major role in the development of fatal complications during sepsis.\r"

Three defensins (human neutrophil peptide defensin [HNP]-1, HNP-2, and HNP-3) constitute between 30 and 50% of the total protein in azurophil granules of human PMN. We examined the mechanism of HNP-mediated bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli ML-35 (i-, y-, z+) and its pBR322-transformed derivative, E. coli ML-35p. Under conditions that supported bactericidal activity, HNP-1 sequentially permeabilized the outer membrane (OM) and inner membrane (IM) of E. coli. Coincident with these events, bacterial synthesis of DNA, RNA, and protein ceased and the colony count fell. Although these events were closely coupled under standard assay conditions, OM permeabilization was partially dissociated from IM permeabilization when experiments were performed with E. coli that had been plasmolyzed by mannitol. Under such conditions, the rate and extent of bacterial death more closely paralled loss of IM integrity than OM permeabilization. Electron microscopy of E. coli that had been killed by defensins revealed the presence of striking electron-dense deposits in the periplasmic space and affixed to the OM. Overall, these studies show that HNP-mediated bactericidal activity against E. coli ML-35 is associated with sequential permeabilization of the OM and IM, and that inner membrane permeabilization appears to be the lethal event.\r"

Antibodies to the native Ku antigen (p70/p80 complex) varied over a range of up to 577-fold. Large fluctuations were also observed in the levels of autoantibodies to several distinct epitopes of the Ku (p70/p80) antigen. Levels of these individual autoantibody populations generally paralleled one another, suggesting that they are coordinately regulated. A similar pattern of anti-DNA antibody fluctuation was seen in some sera. To examine the possibility that these autoantibodies were generated by polyclonal B cell activation, the levels of anti-Ku (p70/p80) and anti-DNA antibodies were compared to the levels of antibodies to Escherichia coli proteins, tetanus toxoid, and bovine insulin, transferrin, cytochrome c, serum albumin, and thyroglobulin. In sera from the same individual, anti-Ku (p70/p80) antibodies were sometimes produced in the complete absence of polyclonal activation, and at other times were accompanied by increased polyclonal activation. Anti-DNA antibody levels more closely paralleled the level of polyclonal activation than did the anti-Ku (p70/p80) levels. These studies suggest that anti-Ku (p70/p80) antibodies are generated by an antigen-selective mechanism, but that polyclonal activation frequently, although not invariably, accompanies autoantibody production. This observation is consistent with the possibility that polyclonal activation might be secondary to autoantibody production.\r"

  ".W": "Alveolar macrophages (AMs) recovered from the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of 44 patients with sarcoidosis were evaluated for their ability to release type IV collagenolytic metalloproteinase (IV-Case). This enzyme, which is produced by peripheral blood monocytes (PBMs) but not by tissue macrophages, degrades type IV collagen, the major structural component of vessel wall basement membranes, and helps to promote the migration of PBMs from the blood compartment to peripheral tissues. Our results demonstrated that AMs from patients with active sarcoidosis released significantly increased levels of IV-Case with respect to patients with inactive disease and control subjects. After in vitro culture, sarcoid AMs secreted IV-Case during the first 24 h of collection; after that time, AMs progressively lost their ability to release IV-Case. Exposition of both sarcoid and normal AMs to recombinant IL 2 or gamma IFN did not influence their property to release IV-Case. The immunoblot analysis of IV-Case demonstrated complete identity between IV-Case released by AMs and the degradative enzyme obtained from PBMs. The increased property to release IV-Case was significantly related to the increase of the absolute number of AMs and, in particular, of AMs bearing two determinants that are usually expressed by most PBMs (CD11b and CD14). Selective depletion of CD11b+/CD14+ AMs from the entire macrophagic population was associated with the recovery of the IV-Case activity to normal values. A positive correlation was also found between the increase in the absolute number of lung T cells and the enhanced CD4/CD8 pulmonary ratio. A 6-mo follow-up study indicated a significant association between the positivity for the 67Gallium scan and the increased property of AMs to release IV-Case. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that a IV-Case mediated influx of peripheral monocytes takes place in the lung of sarcoid patients. Furthermore, the correlation found between the IV-Case release and disease activity suggests that this assay could represent a useful tool in sarcoidosis disease staging.\r"

  ".W": "The treatment of choice for certain immunodeficiency syndromes and hematological disorders is bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The success of BMT is influenced by the degree of HLA compatibility between recipient and donor. However, aberrant expression of HLA sometimes makes it difficult, if not impossible, to determine the patient's HLA type by standard serological and cellular techniques. We describe here the application of new molecular biological techniques to perform high resolution HLA typing independent of HLA expression. A patient with HLA-deficient severe combined deficiency was HLA typed using in vitro amplification of the HLA genes and sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe hybridization (SSOPH). Two major advances provided by this technology are:detection of HLA polymorphism at the level of single amino acid differences; and elimination of a requirement for HLA expression. Although the patient's lymphocytes lacked class II HLA proteins, polymorphism associated with DR7,w53;DQw2;DRw11a (a split of DR5), w52b (a split of DRw52);DQw7 were identified. The patient's class I expression was partially defective, and typing was accomplished by a combination of serological (HLA-A and -C) and SSOPH analysis (HLA-B). Complete patient haplotypes were predicted after typing of family members [A2;B35(w6); Cw4; DRw11a(w52b);DQw7 and A2;B13(w4); Cw6;DR7(w53); DQw2]. Potential unrelated donors were typed and a donor was selected for BMT.\r"

  ".U": "89340885\r", 
  ".W": "Endothelin is a potent mammalian vasoconstrictive peptide with structural homology to cation channel-binding insect toxins. We tested the proposal that this peptide directly activates dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels in cultured vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells. First, we found that cell Ca2+ can be altered in VSM by activation of voltage-operated Ca2+ channels. KCl-induced depolarization and the dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel agonist (-) Bay K 8644 (10 microM) both raised cell Ca2+ more than twofold; the effect of KCl was blocked by the inhibitory enantiomer, (+) Bay K 8644 (40 microM). Similar responses were observed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Synthetic endothelin (4 x 10(-8) M) raised Ca2+ in VSM but not CHO cells from 100 +/- 17 to 561 +/- 34 nM within 12 s. Ca2+ subsequently fell to basal levels after 30 min. Half maximal Ca2+ response was at 4 x 10(-9) M endothelin. Unlike endothelin, thrombin raised Ca2+ in both VSM and CHO cells. The Ca2+ responses to endothelin and thrombin were not affected by nicardipine (1 microM), (+) Bay K 8644, or Ca2+-free solutions. Lastly, both hormones caused release of inositol phosphates in VSM cells. However, the response to thrombin was more than 10-fold larger and was more rapid than the response to endothelin; the thrombin response was sensitive to pertussis toxin, while the response to endothelin was not. Thus endothelin, like thrombin, raises cell Ca2+ in VSM by mobilization of intracellular stores and not by activation of dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels. However, their receptors are distinct and they exhibit important differences in signal transduction.\r"

  ".W": "Complex interrelationships exist between the four pancreatic islet cell types and their respective secretory products, insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide. These hormones are known to interact with the different islet cells and modulate their functions. Insulin inhibits glucagon secretion from the A cell both in vivo and in vitro and, in states of insulin deficiency, high glucagon levels are observed that are normalized by insulin replacement. To determine if insulin also regulates glucagon biosynthesis, we studied its effects on glucagon gene expression. Our studies indicate that insulin, in a dose-dependent fashion decreases steady-state glucagon mRNA levels in a clonal hamster islet cell line, In-R1-G9; this decrease is secondary to an inhibition of glucagon gene transcription as assessed by transcriptional run-on assays and does not involve detectable changes in mRNA stability. Inhibition of glucagon gene transcription is accompanied by corresponding decreases in glucagon immunoreactivity in both cell extracts and medium. We conclude that insulin may not only regulate glucagon secretion but also glucagon gene expression.\r"

We postulated that increased pressure within central pulmonary arteries is a stimulus for connective tissue synthesis and the response is dependent on an intact endothelium. Mechanical tension equivalent to 50 mmHg pressure was applied for 4 h to isolated rat main pulmonary arteries (endothelium intact or removed), and incorporation of [14C]proline into collagen, [14C]valine into elastin, [3H]thymidine into DNA and pro alpha 1 (I) collagen mRNA levels were measured. In intact vessels, tension induced synthesis of collagen (3.1 +/- 0.4 vs. 2.3 +/- 0.5 [SEM] dpm X 10(2) [14C]-hydroxyproline/[mg protein.h]) (n = 10) and elastin (6.1 +/- 2.4 vs. 2.9 +/- 0.4 dpm X 10(3) [14C]valine/[mg protein.h]) (n = 5) (both P less than 0.05). Steady state mRNA levels of pro alpha 1 (I) collagen were also increased by tension (46 vs. 30 X 10(2) dpm hybridized/100 ng total RNA). However, the stimulus did not increase [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. In denuded vessels, tension had no effect on connective tissue synthesis or mRNA level of pro alpha 1 (I) collagen. Messenger RNA levels for v-sis were induced by tension in intact but not denuded vessels. Our findings establish that induction of vascular connective tissue synthesis by mechanical tension is dependent on an intact endothelium.\r"

ET-1 was first isolated from culture supernatants from porcine endothelial cells and ET-3 was identified from a rat DNA library. We report on the binding of 125I-ET-1 to zona glomerulosa cells in culture and on its ability to stimulate aldosterone secretion. Cultured calf adrenal zona glomerulosa cells have saturable, high affinity [Kd = 1.00 +/- 0.17 X 10(-10) M (SEM)] receptors which bind ET-1 in a temperature and time dependent manner. Binding was specific and angiotensin II, vasopressin, ANP, BNP, apamin, calcium channel agonists or antagonists did not interact with the receptor. ET-3 displaced 125I-ET-1 from the receptor with a relative potency of 0.39 +/- 0.1% (SEM) that of ET-1. ET-1 incubated with cultured glomerulosa cells stimulated aldosterone secretion in a dose dependent manner but it was less potent than angiotensin II. ET-3 had less than 1% the relative potency of ET-1 stimulating aldosterone secretion. This data suggest that ET-1 is an independent stimulator of aldosterone secretion and we are speculating that it might be important in those situations, like in malignant hypertension, where endothelial damage might result in increased ET-1 production.\r"

  ".U": "89340910\r", 
  ".W": "Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (IE) specifically adhere to vascular endothelium in vivo and to human endothelial cells, some human melanoma cell lines, and human monocytes in vitro. The tissue cell receptor for a ligand on the surface of the infected erythrocytes is an Mr 88,000 glycoprotein (GP88) recognized by the MAb OKM5, which also blocks cytoadherence of IE. Isolated, affinity-purified GP88 (CD36) competitively blocks cytoadherence and when absorbed to plastic surfaces, specifically binds P. falciparum IE. Additionally, monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to GP88 block cytoadherence to both target cells and immobilized GP88. Binding to GP88 by IE is unaffected by the absence of calcium or the absence of thrombospondin, a putative mediator for cytoadherence of P. falciparum IE. Thus, GP88 (CD36), which has been demonstrated to be the same as platelet glycoprotein IV, interacts directly with P. falciparum IE, presumably via a parasite-induced ligand exposed on the surface of the infected erythrocytes. CD36 is shown to be present on brain endothelium in both individuals without malaria and individuals with cerebral malaria. This would suggest that factors other than just cerebral sequestration of IE play an initiating role in the genesis of cerebral malaria.\r"

In three patients with successful engraftment (by DNA genotyping, red cell phenotyping, and cytogenetic studies) platelet and monocyte FXIIIA changed to donor phenotypes with hematologic recovery. Thus, FXIIIA in platelets and monocytes is synthesized de novo and/or from their progenitor cells. Plasma FXIIIA phenotype change after transplantation was more complex. Patient I changed from phenotype 1-1 (one electrophoretically fast band) to 1-2 (three bands) in 115 d; patients 2 and 3 did not change completely from phenotype 1-2 to 1-1 in up to 458 d, but did show enrichment of the fastest band. Thus, while there is a definite contribution of donor hemopoiesis to plasma FXIIIA, another source of recipient FXIIIA appears to be present to delay or prevent the phenotype change.\r"

We tested the hypothesis that S-28 regulates B-cell function by (a) studying the effects on insulin secretion of \"physiologic\" infusions of S-28 and (b) measuring insulin responses during elevated nutrient-stimulated endogenous S-28 levels. (a) Synthetic S-28 was infused on separate days into six healthy men at rates of 25 and 50 ng/kg per h which mimicked postprandial levels. Subjects were given a bolus of glucose (0.1 g/kg) after 120 min. Insulin responses during S-28 infusions were compared to a control study using a saline infusion in the same individuals. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was inhibited during the infusion of 50 ng/kg per h S-28 when compared to control (P less than 0.05). (b) Insulin secretion during elevations of endogenous S-28 was studied in healthy men who received a bolus of 2.5 g arginine (n = 14) or 25 U of secretin (n = 8) 120 min after swallowing 50 g fat, or, on a separate day, an equivalent volume of water. S-28 levels rose significantly after fat ingestion but did not change after water. Arginine and secretin-stimulated insulin secretion was inhibited following ingestion of fat compared with intake of water (P less than 0.05). Arginine-enhanced glucagon secretion was not changed by fat ingestion. We conclude that elevations in plasma S-28 levels, occurring during the postprandial state, attenuate B-cell secretion and this peptide may be a physiologic modulator of nutrient-stimulated insulin release.\r"

A patient was deemed to be infected when C pylori was cultured or seen in either the histological sections or the Gram stain of the biopsy smear. One hundred and seventy four (46%) patients were infected. Culture, Gram stain, histological examination and the CLO-test showed sensitivities of 92%, 87%, 93% and 90%, respectively. In 27 (15%) infected patients an uneven distribution of C pylori was seen between samples in the biopsy pair sent for histology. Examination of multiple sections stained with Warthin-Starry silver was more sensitive at detecting infection (93%) than examination of multiple sections from only one biopsy specimen (84%). Fifty seven of 80 patients, biopsied a median seven days (range 5 to 55) after completing colloidal bismuth subcitrate treatment, were still infected with C pylori. There was no decrease in the sensitivities of the above tests to detect infection after treatment. It is concluded that at least two antral biopsy specimens should be examined when attempting to diagnose C pylori infection by histological methods.\r"

The positive predictive value and the negative predictive value of the immunoassay were 91% and 87%, respectively. Collection of samples for IDEIA in transport medium in plastic phials, as opposed to glass phials recommended by the manufacturer, had no effect on these values. Tests of the sensitivity of IDEIA using laboratory strains of C trachomatis showed that the assay detected chlamydial elementary bodies only at dilutions at least 10-fold lower than those at which they could be detected by Micro Trak. Tests of the specificity of the assay with microorganisms found in the genital tract, other than chlamydiae, showed that reactions occurred with a number of these. Testing three cervical swabs from the same patient, with the material taken into a single phial of transport medium, increased the sensitivity of IDEIA from 74% to 96%, without reducing the specificity which remained at 97%. It is concluded that this approach enchances the value of the test in a sexually transmitted disease clinic population and may do so in a population with a low prevalence of chlamydiae.\r"

This cycle is repeated until the remaining candidates do not increase the discriminatory power of the typing set. Options are provided for the investigator to pre-select certain tests for inclusion or exclusion from the typing set.

The results obtained with this new approach were superior to standard techniques used for both enzyme histochemical and morphological studies. Moreover, blocks of the embedded tissue were stored for at least one year at room temperature without loss of enzyme activity. This method should find a wide range of applications in histopathology.\r"

Eleven adult patients started immunotherapy after a season of symptom diaries and graded pretreatment challenges with 0.03, 0.3, 3.3, and 16.5 mg of ragweed pollen. Repeat challenges were performed when the treatment dosage reached 0.6, 12.4, and 24.8 micrograms of Amb a I (antigen E) equivalents per injection. After the 0.6 micrograms dose, there was little change, but after the larger doses, there was a significant reduction in histamine and tosylarginine methyl ester-esterase (TAME-esterase) release in two respects. More pollen was required before any mediator appeared, and the amount of mediator released at each stage of the challenge was reduced. There was no significant difference between the responses at the 12.4 and 24.8 micrograms treatment doses. Sneezing after challenge was not apparently changed after immunotherapy; however, patients' seasonal symptom-medication scores were reduced after treatment. These data set the optimal individual treatment dose of ragweed extract for immunotherapy at greater than 0.6 micrograms, but probably not more than 12.4 micrograms in terms of Amb a I equivalents.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to determine the effects of varying the proportions of carbohydrate, fiber, and fat on metabolic control in Type II diabetes. Ten men, aged 50 to 69 years, with Type II diabetes participated. Four isocaloric diets were consumed for 2 weeks each, with a break of 6 to 14 weeks between diets to ensure no carryover effects. Two of the diets were high in carbohydrate (63% to 65% energy) and low in fat (10% to 12% energy) but differed in their fiber contents (20 vs. 45 gm/day). The other two diets were low in carbohydrate (23% to 27% energy) with either a low or a high fat content (15% vs. 55% energy) and a high or normal protein content (62% vs. 18% energy). The composition of the subjects' usual diets in the week before each of the experimental diets did not vary significantly: carbohydrate 47% to 50% energy, protein 22% to 25% energy, fat 27% to 31% energy, and fiber 24 to 25 gm/day. A 75-gm oral glucose tolerance test and a 12-hour metabolic profile in response to 3 meals typical of the particular diet were conducted before and at the conclusion of each 2-week dietary period. The most significant improvements in metabolic control (as assessed by the effects of the diets on fasting glucose and on lipids, and on the glucose and insulin responses to oral glucose and the mixed meals) were obtained with the high-fiber, high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet and with the low-carbohydrate, high-protein, low-fat diet. Metabolic control was not significantly affected by the low-fiber, high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet, but it deteriorated significantly on the low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet. The results of this study confirmed the importance of high fiber and low fat in improving metabolic control in Type II diabetes. In conclusion, if high-carbohydrate, low-fat diets are to be recommended to patients with diabetes, it is essential that the type of carbohydrate recommended be unrefined and high in fiber.\r"

In diabetes, many factors may affect blood lipid levels and complicate formulating an effective dietary prescription. Both Type I and Type II diabetes may have an independent effect on lipids. This article discusses metabolic derivations in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism that contribute to lipid abnormalities. The National Cholesterol Education Program Guidelines, which include dietary recommendations for lowering blood lipid levels by modifying fat intake, are discussed in regard to their effect on blood lipids in diabetes and their effect on other variables, such as blood glucose control. Other treatment approaches common in diabetes and lipid management include low-calorie diets and weight reduction, a change in the fatty acid composition of the diet, and high-carbohydrate diets. An evaluation of the etiologies of lipid abnormalities and interventions directed toward lipid levels and other indexes of diabetes management may lead to improved lipid levels, improved blood glucose control, and avoidance of unnecessary, ineffective, or deleterious dietary prescriptions for individuals with diabetes.\r"

BBTD is a nutritional disorder whose outcome is carious teeth. Treatment involves extensive and expensive restoration of teeth or extraction of teeth associated with physical restraint, sedation, or general anesthesia in a hospital. This review of several issues regarding BBTD includes description, etiology and pathogenesis, prevalence, background factors, treatment, timing for intervention, existing strategies, and research opportunities. The disease is of significance to the nutritionist because it is totally preventable and occurs at an age when many children have seen a nutritionist (e.g., in a WIC program) but may not have seen a dentist. The dietetic practitioner can identify children at risk, determine awareness by the parent, and establish a behavioral contract with the parent. The practitioner needs to succeed for only a brief time to prevent BBTD.\r"

  ".W": "Studies have shown that dietitians perceive a need for further education about ethnic food habits. Knowledge about the dietary habits of immigrants and ethnic groups is important for dietitians because those habits are frequently assimilated into the culinary traditions of America. The authors used Cajun cuisine as a model for studying a rapidly expanding form of ethnic food. The foods in Cajun cuisine are currently best-selling menu items, they challenge adaptation for modified diets, and they have been influenced by agricultural and social customs. Historically, Cajun food evolved from an area in south Louisiana called Acadiana. The Acadians were impoverished exiles from Nova Scotia who settled along the bayous of Louisiana and learned to use available foods in the area. Cajun cuisine was also influenced by the Creoles from the area of New Orleans located approximately 100 miles from the Cajun settlers. As part of the education process about ethnic food habits, one needs to consider the history, indigenous foods, symbolism and meaning of foods, food preparation methods, and adaptations that can be made for modified diets. When Cajun cuisine is used as a framework, nutrition education, counseling, and food preparation for ethnic groups may be more effective.\r"

Because the literature pertinent to geriatrics has continued to grow ever more rapidly, it has been necessary to omit many informative articles from the bibliography. Preference is given to recent publications; almost all of the reference data from the past four years. Some articles were selected to highlight current controversies or changes in viewpoint. Most of the references deal specifically with an elderly patient population, though few use a multidisciplinary approach. Studies of the elderly are confounded by concomitants of aging frequent but not universal in our society: inactivity, obesity, malnutrition, and psychosocial trauma. The articles cited are primarily concerned with medical ailments of the elderly; legal, ethical, and sociological topics receive more limited coverage. The references are divided into categories. The first set (I) deals with some possible causes of aging; the second (II) with physiologic decline accompanying aging; the third (III) with the atypical and nonspecific characteristics of illness among geriatric patients; the fourth (IV) with the elderly and society; and the fifth (V) with care options. The remainder of the references are cited by pertinent medical specialty. Within each category, references are divided by disease process. Articles are further subgrouped by aspects of those diseases such as evaluation or therapy.\r"

Pancreatic function tests may aid in the detection of disease at an earlier stage in some patients and can assess the degree of functional damage which is helpful in assessing patients for supplemental therapy. While direct intubation methods are invasive and time consuming, they remain the gold standard against which the other investigations have to be assessed. An indirect test, such as the pancreolaural test, has been shown to be a useful addition to ultrasound for the screening of pancreatic disease. Pancreatic markers and radioisotope methods have failed to live up to early promise, but fecal tests can be used effectively to monitor enzyme replacement. A judicious combination of pancreatic function tests and imaging techniques may be able to rationalize investigation and treatment of pancreatic disease.\r"

Metronidazole was found to be slightly more effective than sulfasalazine, a difference statistically significant only at 12 months. Six patients also completed a crossover trial. Remission was maintained for 12 months in 3 patients by metronidazole and in none of the 6 by sulfasalazine. No significant side effects were noted, and in particular, no paresthesias were reported. This trial, as well as our previous one, suggests that metronidazole may be useful in the maintenance of remission in patients with ulcerative colitis, but that it is ineffective in the therapy of the acute attack.\r"

  ".U": "89341305\r", 
  ".W": "The idea that putrefaction of the stools causes disease, i.e., intestinal autointoxication, originated with physicians in ancient Egypt. They believed that a putrefactive principle associated with feces was absorbed in to the general circulation, where it acted to produce fever and pus. This description of the materia peccans represented the earliest forerunner of our present notion of endotoxin and its effect. The ancient Greeks extended the concept of putrefaction to involve not only the residues of food, but also those of bile, phlegm, and blood, incorporating it into their humoral theory of disease. During the 19th century, the early biochemical and bacteriologic studies lent credence to the idea of ptomaine poisoning--that degradation of protein in the colon by anerobic bacteria generated toxic amines. Among the leading proponents of autointoxication was Metchnikoff, who hypothesized that intestinal toxins shortened lifespan. The toxic process, however, was reversed by the consumption of lactic acid-producing bacteria that changed the colonic microflora and prevented proteolysis. The next logical step in treatment followed in the early 20th century when surgeons, chief among them Sir W. Arbuthnot Lane, performed colectomy to cure intestinal autointoxication. By the 1920s, the medical doctrine fell into disrepute as scientific advanced failed to give support. However, the idea persists in the public mind, probably as an extension of the childhood habit of toilet training.\r"

The addition of recombinant IL-1 to the MLR restored anti-bm12 MLR responses, indicating that APC-depleted (B6 x bm12)F1 cells bear bm12 alloantigens but are unable to stimulate B6 anti-bm12 L3T4+ T cells. A single i.v. administration of APC-depleted (B6 x bm12)F1 cells into B6 mice resulted in almost complete abrogation of the capacity of recipient B6 lymphoid cells to give anti-bm12 MLR and IL2 production. This suppression was bm12 alloantigen-specific and attributed to the elimination or functional impairment of anti-bm12 T cell clones rather than the induction of suppressor cells. The tolerance was also observed in graft-rejection responses. The strikingly prolonged survival of bm12 skin grafts was produced when grafts were implanted into B6 mice which had been presensitized with APC-depleted, but not with untreated (B6 x bm12)F1 spleen cells. These results indicate that allo-class II H-2 antigen-reactive L3T4+ T cells are rendered tolerant by i.v. presensitization with APC-depleted fraction of the corresponding allogeneic cells.\r"

  ".W": "Cytotoxic T lymphocytes were found to mediate rapid lysis of target cells not normally recognized in the presence of small polystyrene beads coated with a combination of anti-T3 and antitarget cell antibodies. Lysis was not seen with beads bearing one of these antibodies alone, nor with a mixture of two types of beads each coated with a single antibody. The effector cells mediating this lysis include long term allospecific human CTL, and both human and mouse CTL clones recognizing mouse class I MHC Kb Ag. TNP-modified mouse tumor cells, a human lymphoblastoid line, and human red cells were found to be good targets for this cytotoxicity. Polystyrene beads with diameters of 3 to 15 mu caused target lysis, with a dose-response curve which typically went through a maximum and declined at high bead numbers. Maximal bead-redirected lysis by CTL was less efficient than that mediated by soluble antibody heteroconjugates of the same two antibodies. Bead-redirected target lysis was calcium dependent. These results are interpreted as a form of bystander lysis induced by the beads, since the target cell membrane is not directly crosslinked to the region of CTL activation. These observations thus favor a mechanism of lysis involving the polarized secretion of a locally acting lytic agent by CTL.\r"

  ".W": "The interaction between the clonally selected TCR, the processed Ag peptide and the Ia molecule is not fully understood in molecular terms. Our study intended to delineate the residues of Ab alpha molecules that function as contact sites for Ag and for the TCR of a panel of T cells specific for the A chain of insulin in combination with mixed haplotype Ab alpha:Ak beta molecules. Multiple L cell transfectants expressing alpha,beta-heterodimers composed of wild-type A beta- and chimeric or mutant A alpha-chains served as antigen presenting cells. The recombinant A alpha-chains had been generated by an exchange of allelically hypervariable regions (ahv) or amino acids. The results point out a broad spectrum of b sequence requirements for the bovine insulin-specific activation of the various T cell populations. Activation of some T cells seemed quite permissive, requiring b-haplotype amino acids in any one of the three ahv, while others had strict requirements, demanding b-haplotype sequence in all three ahv. Our data stress the role of ahvII and especially ahvIII in T cell activation. Interestingly, single amino-acid substitutions in ahvII or ahvIII of Ak alpha were sufficient to bring up full stimulation potential for two T cell hybridomas. We also found that some ahv permutations influenced the Ag preference (beef insulin versus pig insulin) of some T cells. These data suggest a critical role for the three-dimensional structure of the complex formed by Ia and the processed Ag peptide. The stability of the trimolecular complex essential for T cell activation is envisioned as being the sum of the interactions between Ag/I-A, TCR/Ag, and TCR/I-A, each variable in strength and compensated for by the others.\r"

  ".W": "LFA-1 and LFA-3 expression is absent or low on Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines and low on the EBV-transformed B cell line UD61. Incubation of cells of BL2 and of UD61 with various concentrations of IL-4 resulted in induction of LFA-1 and LFA-3 expression in a dose dependent fashion. This effect was already observed after 16 h of incubation whereas maximal expression was obtained after 72 h. Induction of LFA-1 and LFA-3 expression seemed to be specific for IL-4, because IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma and a low m.w. B cell growth factor were ineffective. LFA-1 and LFA-3 induction by IL-4 was blocked specifically by an anti-IL-4 antiserum. Induction of LFA-1 expression by IL-4 was furthermore confirmed at the specific LFA-1 beta-chain mRNA level. IL-4 was unable to induce LFA-1 expression on EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines of two LFA-1-deficient patients. BL2 grows as single cells, but induction of LFA-1 and LFA-3 expression by IL-4 was insufficient to induce homotypic cell adhesions and required PMA as a second signal. PMA alone did not induce LFA-1 antigen expression and was unable to induce adhesions between BL2 cells in the absence of IL-4 in 22 h assays. Addition of PMA to BL2 cells that expressed LFA-1 Ag upon incubation with IL-4 resulted in aggregate formation within 30 min. Adhesions between BL2 cells induced by IL-4 in combination with PMA were blocked by anti-LFA-1 beta or anti-LFA-1 alpha-chains mAb. In addition, these mAbs dispersed preformed aggregates of BL2 cells. Our results indicate that IL-4 can induce the adhesion molecules LFA-1 and LFA-3 on B cell lines, but that an additional activation signal provided by PMA was required for the induction of homotypic cell adhesions.\r"

  ".W": "Prompted by our recent finding that lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells mediate both veto and natural suppression, we tested the ability of adoptively transferred LAK cells to block two in vivo alloreactions which complicate bone marrow transplantation: resistance to transplanted allogeneic bone marrow cells, and lethal graft-vs-host disease. Adoptive transfer of either donor type B6D2 or recipient-type B6 lymphokine-activated bone marrow cells, cells found to have strong LAK activity, abrogated or inhibited the resistance of irradiated B6 mice to both B6D2 marrow and third party-unrelated C3H marrow as measured by CFU in spleen on day 7. The ability of lymphokine-activated bone marrow cells to abrogate allogeneic resistance was eliminated by C lysis depletion of cells expressing asialo-GM1, NK1.1, and, to a variable degree, Thy-1, but not by depletion of cells expressing Lyt-2, indicating that the responsible cells had a LAK cell phenotype. Similar findings were obtained by using splenic LAK cells generated by 3 to 7 days of culture with rIL-2. Demonstration that allogeneic resistance could be blocked by a cloned LAK cell line provided direct evidence that LAK cells inhibit allogeneic resistance. In addition to inhibiting allogeneic resistance, adoptively transferred recipient-type LAK cells prevented lethal graft-vs-host disease, and permitted long term engraftment of allogeneic marrow. Irradiation prevented LAK cell inhibition of both allogeneic resistance and lethal graft-vs-host disease. These findings suggest that adoptive immunotherapy with LAK cells may prove useful in preventing graft rejection and graft-versus-host disease in human bone marrow transplant recipients.\r"

  ".W": "The number of Ia+ Langerhans cells (LC) in skin from aged (16- to 18-mo old) BALB/c mice is approximately 40% lower than in skin from young (2- to 3-mo old) mice. Overnight incubation at 37 degrees C with a variety of cytokines, including IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and granulocyte/macrophage-CSF, causes a significant increase in the Ia expression on LC and raises the number of Ia+ cells by at least 300/mm2 in skin from both young and old mice. At 1 to 5 x 10(-5) M, 2-ME has a similar effect. The percentage increment in Ia+ cells is much higher for skin from aged mice than from young mice, particularly with IL-3, which appears to reconstitute the number of Ia+ LC in skin from aged mice to that of IL-3 exposed skin from young mice. Under the incubation conditions of our experiments, neither keratinocytes nor Thy-1+ dendritic cells acquire Ia Ag. Addition of 10 micrograms/ml cyclosporine A to the medium abolishes the effect of 2-ME and of all of the cytokines except IL-2 and IL-6. These results demonstrate the presence of a significant population of Ia- LC in the epidermis of both young and aged mice. It is suggested that epidermal production of cytokines may be of importance in the maintenance of constitutive Ia expression on LC. The possible interaction between keratinocytes and LC and the effect of aging on this process are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Over 80% of nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice develop lymphocytic infiltrates of their pancreatic islets (insulitis) by 6 wk of age and 50% of the females are diabetic by 6 mo of age. The incidence of insulitis in NOD mice injected once as neonates with 250 micrograms of the CD3 antibody, 145.2C11, was 8% at 10 wk of age, increasing to 25% at 32 wk of age. Fewer than 10% of these animals developed diabetes by 8 mo of age. Neonatal administration of 145.2C11 reduced the proliferative responses of spleen cells to mitogen stimulation 2 and 4 wk postinjection and expression of TCR was reduced 1 to 5 wk postinjection. The percentage of CD4 and CD8 cells in the spleen was transiently reduced after injection and the frequency of Pgp-1+-high cells (putative memory cells) was increased 2 to 4 wk postinjection, suggesting that in vivo administration of the antibody caused some T cells to divide as well as transiently reducing T cell numbers. IL-2R expression was not detected on spleen cells in the 4 wk after antibody injection. The phenotypic and functional changes after neonatal CD3 antibody injection resolved by 8 wk of age. The control and injected mice grew normally and made equivalent IgG antibody responses to injected human IgG. Neonatally injected 145.2C11 antibody was cleared from the circulation with a terminal half-life approximating to 21 days but greater than 90% of antigen binding activity was lost 6 days after injection. Protection from diabetes did not follow neonatal elimination of T cells with CD4 and CD8 antibodies, nor the injection of a TCR subset antibody, F23.1. Our data suggest that the neonatal T cell repertoire is open to modulation by a single injection of a CD3 antibody and they offer a new experimental approach to immunotherapy in an animal model of type 1 diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "The choice of class II MHC determinants that serve as self-recognition elements for murine CD4+ T cells is thought to be determined by the environment in which T cells mature rather than their genotype. Patients with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) reconstituted with T cell depleted haploidentical parental stem cells provide an excellent model for studying this phenomenon in humans. After engraftment, the T cells that develop in these infants are all of donor origin. We sought to determine whether the successful immune reconstitution observed in two such SCID chimeras involved modification of the MHC restriction of Ag recognition by the genetically donor T cells as they matured to become competent T cells in the infants' microenvironment. A tetanus toxoid (TT)-specific T cell line and TT-specific T cell clones were established from the blood of two reconstituted SCID patients and from their maternal donors. T cell responsiveness was determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation after TT presentation by EBV-transformed B cell lines (EBV-B) from various donors. The TT-specific T cell line from patient 1 proliferated when presented Ag by patient, maternal donor, and paternal APC. A CD4+ donor origin clone that proliferated when presented TT by patient and paternal EBV-B, but not by maternal donor EBV-B, was isolated from each patient. TT recognition by these clones was shown to be restricted by the HLA DR determinant shared by patient and father, but not present in the donor. Four TT-specific clones isolated from maternal donors failed to proliferate when presented TT by the appropriate paternal EBV-B. These studies demonstrate that, in these human SCID bone marrow chimeras, engrafted donor-origin stem cells maturing to competent T cells in the recipient microenvironment are capable of utilizing recipient HLA determinants as restriction elements for Ag recognition. This suggests that human, as well as murine, MHC restriction patterns for Ag recognition by CD4+ T cells are environmentally determined.\r"

All four mAb are different in respect to isotype and IEF pattern. The cross-reactivity with partially homologous peptides like beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4 showed defined differences. With the use of these antibodies we were able to detect solid phase as well as soluble NAP/IL-8 as tested in a sandwich-ELISA. Also dose-dependent neutralization of NAP/IL-8 chemotactic activity in the Boyden chamber chemotaxis assay was observed. Immunoaffinity columns prepared with these four mAb bound NAP/IL-8 from supernatants of LPS-stimulated mononuclear cells. Furthermore, Western immunoblots showed a single protein band in the expected region of Mr of 10 kDa with all four mAb presented.\r"

  ".W": "Although some of the membrane glycoproteins that serve as activators or regulators of C activation have been identified, the influence of membrane lipids has not been studied extensively. A model of alternative C pathway activation was established using liposomes composed of cholesterol and synthetic phospholipids. Liposomes containing phosphatidylcholine (PC) as the sole phospholipid did not activate C as measured by C3 binding after incubation in normal human serum containing 2.5 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM EGTA. When phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) was included as 20% or more of the phospholipid, C3 binding was observed. C3 binding to liposomes was inhibited by salicylhydroxamic acid indicating binding through the C3 thioester bond. The phospholipid composition did not influence C3 binding to liposomes in an unregulated system of C3, B, D, and P indicating equivalent C3b binding sites on activating and nonactivating liposomes. When the regulatory proteins H and I were added to the other components, liposomes containing PE bound three times more C3 than PC liposomes suggesting that the phospholipid affects C3 regulation. This was tested directly in a radiolabeled H binding assay. In the presence of equal amounts of C3b, PC liposomes showed a greater number of high affinity H binding sites than PE liposomes. Using different PE derivatives, C activation could be directly related to the phospholipid polar head group. Liposomes containing PE, trinitrophenyl-PE or monomethyl-PE did activate the alternative C pathway, whereas those containing dimethyl-PE, PC, or phosphatidylserine did not. These studies provide evidence that primary and secondary amino groups on lipid membranes can decrease the interaction between H and C3b and provide sites for alternative pathway activation.\r"

  ".W": "Radiation chimeras in the early phase after bone marrow transplantation are a good model to study the efficiency of the body's nonspecific defense system represented by macrophages (M phi), polymorphonuclear cells (PMN), and NK cells. These cell types are present in large numbers in spleen and liver at that time, whereas the specific immune system represented by T and B cells is functionally deficient. We previously reported enhanced activities in vitro of M phi (and PMN) from recipient animals in an early phase after allogeneic bone marrow transfer. We here demonstrate that these activities result in enhanced spontaneous resistance against Listeria monocytogenes in vivo: CFU of L. monocytogenes in spleen and liver 48 h after infection were about 1 or 2 to 4 log steps less than in untreated control mice of donor or host haplotype. This enhanced resistance decreased over the 4-mo period after marrow transfer. Preactivated M phi were identified as the most important effector cells. Isolated from spleen and peritoneal cavity, they performed enhanced killing of phagocytosed Listeria. Such preactivated M phi occurred in recipient animals after transfer of allogeneic but not of syngeneic bone marrow. The precise mechanism of M phi activation in the allogeneic radiation chimera in the complete absence of any detectable T cell function is not clear at present. However, these preactivated M phi display an important protective effect against L. monocytogenes: chimeras could eliminate Listeria without acquisition of positive delayed-type sensitivity when infected with 10(3) bacteria. An inoculum of 5 . 10(3) L. monocytogenes resulted either in prolonged survival compared with normal mice of the recipient haplotype or in definitive survival accompanied by a positive delayed-type sensitivity. We concluded that enhanced nonspecific immune functions can in part compensate for the defective specific immune system after bone marrow transfer.\r"

To determine whether Kupffer cells (KC) derived from this layer interact with sporozoites, murine KC were isolated from perfused livers of BALB/cJ mice and incubated in vitro with Plasmodium berghei sporozoites. Isolated KC had characteristic macrophage surface Ag and were phagocytic, ingesting both latex particles and Leishmania major amastigotes. In the absence of immune serum, sporozoites associated with fewer than 10% of these KC. By 30 min, 10% of the cell-associated sporozoites were completely ingested, 30% were in the process of being ingested, and 60% were attached to the surface of the cells. Opsonization of sporozoites with monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies directed against P. berghei circumsporozoite protein markedly enhanced sporozoite association with KC. Up to 40% of cells exposed to opsonized sporozoites had parasites inside or attached to their surfaces. Sporozoites attached to or ingested by KC were uniformly destroyed within 240 min in all cultures; there was no evidence of conversion of sporozoites to the exoerythrocytic stage within KC by light microscopy, and there was no evidence of residual sporozoites, either inside or outside of cells, by either light or electron microscopy. These data suggest that under nonimmune conditions, KC play a minor role in resistance to infection by malaria sporozoites. However, when sporozoites are opsonized by circumsporozoite antibodies, phagocytosis by KC may be an important immune mechanism that prevents parasitization of hepatocytes.\r"

The severity of the disease, sorbitol nonfermentation, and presence of enteroadherence are unusual features of this organism.\r"

  ".W": "The role of the macrophage in destruction of virulent treponemes is disputed. A major obstacle has been the inability to demonstrate quantitative phagocytosis of treponemes by macrophages. Treponema pallidum pertenue was attached to polycarbonate filters for assessment of treponemal phagocytosis by macrophages. The disappearance of treponemes due to phagocytosis was measured by enumeration with immunofluorescence. Resident and lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages were found to phagocytize treponemes equally well. The phagocytosis of killed treponemes by macrophages was enhanced by opsonization with immune serum. Macrophages successfully phagocytized Staphylococcus aureus organisms when they were incubated on filters under identical conditions. Treatment of macrophages with cytochalasin B, a known inhibitor of phagocytosis, prevented the disappearance of treponemes and phagocytosis of S. aureus. In addition, fluorescent treponemal debris was observed only inside macrophages cultured with treponemes. These results demonstrate that macrophages can phagocytize pathogenic treponemes on polycarbonate filters.\r"

  ".W": "A large cross-sectional serologic survey for human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) antibody was conducted in 3,177 Ivory Coast residents to evaluate the prevalence of HTLV-1 and to determine possible risk factors and correlates of HTLV-1 infection. Of the 3,177 serum samples, 110 (3.5%) were positive for antibody to HTLV-1 by indirect immunofluorescence assay and Western blot. The prevalence of HTLV-1 antibody in the general adult population was 1.8% and increased significantly with age. No difference between males (1.5%) and females (2%) was found. The highest prevalences were observed in female prostitutes (7.4%), patients with neurologic syndromes (5.8%), and lepers (13.7%). The high prevalence of HTLV-1 infection in prostitutes suggests that heterosexual contact is involved in the transmission of HTLV-1 and that prostitutes could play an important role in the spread of the virus in Africa. The high prevalence of HTLV-1 in patients with neurologic syndromes confirms the association between HTLV-1 and some type of neuropathies, as has been observed in the West Indies and Japan. The high prevalence observed in lepers deserves further investigation to find the cause of the association. Twenty-five individuals, including prostitutes, were coinfected with HTLV-1 and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Prospective studies are necessary to evaluate the exact role of HTLV-1 alone or in combination with HIV in inducing specific diseases.\r"

Isolations were successfully made from peripheral blood lymphocytes and cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytes stimulated with interleukin-2 or cocultivated with umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells. Established cell lines contained HTLV-I antigen by immunfluorescence and cell-associated virus by electron microscopy; cells became transformed in vitro as determined by their continuous growth in the absence of exogenous interleukin-2.

Thus, five of the rhesus monkey were coinoculated with M. leprae and SIV. Three of the five became SIV-positive and developed signs of leprosy and an AIDS-like illness. Two animals remained healthy. The coinoculated leprosy-positive rhesus monkeys developed leprosy despite serologic response patterns to M. leprae antigens that usually indicate leprosy resistance. Three (60%) of the five SIV-positive rhesus monkeys developed leprosy compared with 21% of the animals who received SIV-free M. leprae inocula. Diminished lepromin skin test responses and decreasing T-helper cell percentages were observed in SIV-coinoculated rhesus monkeys with leprosy. These observations suggest that SIV increases the susceptibility of rhesus monkeys to leprosy, possibly related to loss of T-helper cell function.\r"

  ".W": "Ethanol intoxication has been shown to suppress selected functions of the immune system, thereby compromising host defenses against bacterial infections. Because the macrophage secretory protein, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), plays a central role in the inflammatory cascade, the effect of acute and chronic alcoholism on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TNF activity was studied. Saline or ethanol was given intraperitoneally to normal or chronic alcoholic rats followed 30 min later by either intravenous or intratracheal LPS. Intravenous LPS caused a substantial increase in serum TNF at 90 min in both normal and chronic alcoholic rats. In marked contrast, peak serum TNF levels were significantly suppressed in normal and chronic alcoholic rats given an acute injection of ethanol. When LPS was instilled intratracheally into normal rats, high levels of TNF appeared in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Similar levels of TNF were found in chronic alcoholic rats after intratracheal LPS. However, acute ethanol intoxication significantly inhibited LPS-induced TNF in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In a similar manner, acute ethanol intoxication, but not chronic alcohol consumption, markedly inhibited both systemic and intrapulmonary polymorphonuclear leukocyte aggregation in response to either intravenous or intratracheal LPS. Alcohol-induced inhibition of TNF is a potential mechanism of the antiinflammatory effects of ethanol.\r"

Of the 325 patients who were evaluable for toxicity, 241 (74.2%) were evaluable for efficacy. Infection sites included lung (106), urinary tract (42), skin and soft tissue (43), bone and joint (23), bacteremia (21), and hepatobiliary (5). Definite infections were present in 173 cases (71.8%) and possible infections in 68 (28.2%). Analysis of clinical and bacteriologic responses and adverse drug reactions showed no significant differences between the regimens. Values for 95% confidence limits on the differences between regimens for positive clinical and bacteriological outcomes in definite infections were -0.8% to 3.0% and -1.9% to 9.1%, respectively. Thus, daily single-dose therapy with ceftriaxone was comparable to daily multiple-dose therapy with cefotaxime in treating these bacterial infections.\r"

Explicit criteria were used to define infections, clinical response, and adverse effects. Ceftriaxone was given to 88 patients and cefotaxime to 83. The two treatment groups did not differ in types of infection, infecting organisms, and severity of underlying disease. The response rate was 81% (71/88) for ceftriaxone and 80% (66/83) for cefotaxime. The power of the study to detect a 15% difference in response rate at P less than .1 was 90%.

Invasive ability was expressed as the percentage of the inoculum surviving gentamicin after incubation of bacteria with HEp-2 cells. Geometric mean survival of EPEC strains possessing the EPEC adherence factor (EAF+ EPEC) was 5.177%, which was significantly greater than survival of enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) strains (1.871%). EPEC strains lacking EAF (EAF-EPEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) were significantly less invasive (geometric mean survival, 0.032%, 0.013%, and 0.009%, respectively). The variation in bacterial recovery was not due to differences in the number of HEp-2 cells remaining attached to the plates, as measured by the retention of crystal violet stain in parallel assays. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed the presence of many intracellular EAF+ EPEC and EIEC, whereas EAF- EPEC, EHEC, and ETEC were found primarily outside the cells. Epithelial cell invasion is an overlooked property of EAF+ EPEC of potential relevance in disease pathogenesis.\r"

Because Argentina has the highest reported frequency of HUS in the world, Argentine children were prospectively studied during the HUS seasons for evidence of Shiga-like toxin-related diseases. On the basis of serology, fecal cytotoxin neutralization, stool cultures, and DNA hybridization of colony lysates, most children with HUS had evidence of infection with Shiga-like toxin-producing organisms. Children with spring-summer diarrhea also commonly (32%, confidence interval 18%-46%) had clear-cut evidence of such infection. No controls (children without gastrointestinal, renal, or hemolytic disease) had free fecal cytotoxin, positive cultures for E. coli O157:H7, or DNA probe-positive organisms; 20% of them had low serum titers of antibodies to Shiga-like toxins. E. coli O157:H7 was not common in either HUS or diarrhea patients. The high frequency of Shiga-like toxin-induced diarrhea in young children in Argentina probably explains the high incidence of HUS in this country and suggests that HUS is a relatively uncommon complication of Shiga-like toxin-related disease.\r"

  ".W": "Coronary heart disease rates have been reported in several parts of the world to be unusually high in people originating from the Indian subcontinent. High coronary disease rates appear to be common to South Asian groups of different geographical origin, religion, and language. This presents a challenge to the understanding of coronary heart disease: the high rates in South Asians are not explained on the basis of elevated serum cholesterol, smoking or hypertension. Low plasma HDL cholesterol, high plasma triglyceride levels and high prevalence of non-insulin-dependent diabetes have been consistently found in South Asians overseas: this probably reflects an underlying state of insulin resistance. Further studies are needed to determine whether this metabolic disturbance can account for the high rates of coronary heart disease in South Asians, and to identify possibilities for prevention.\r"

Even many of the clinical trials in which a posteriori analyses have been performed confirm a greater effect of systolic rather than diastolic blood pressure as a predictor of coronary heart disease mortality.

Further research should be conducted on the reliability and validity of preference values produced by different scaling methods, including careful examination of the content validity of health-state descriptions. Construct validation studies using the multitrait-multimethod matrix would be useful as well as comparisons of stated preferences with revealed preferences. Despite the many unanswered measurement questions, preference values are currently being used in decision making at both the individual and societal levels. Several global health status measures incorporate preference values, and preferences are increasingly being used in cost-effectiveness studies. If preferences are to be used effectively, research on their measurement must accelerate to keep pace with the urgency for application.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective clinical determination of test-operating characteristics. SETTING: Tertiary care university medical center. PATIENTS/participants: 415 patients referred for evaluation of suspected pheochromocytoma. INTERVENTIONS: All subjects had measurements of the three above-mentioned biochemical tests with the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma established by tissue confirmation. RESULTS: All three biochemical tests were similar in sensitivity (0.70-0.75), specificity (0.90-0.95), and receiver operating characteristics. With an estimated disease prevalence of 5.9% in symptomatic hypertensive patients, the predictive value of any single negative test would be 98% in ruling out disease. CONCLUSIONS: All three biochemical tests have similar performance characteristics and only a single test need be performed to exclude pheochromocytoma in most symptomatic hypertensive patients in a primary care population.\r"

In a case of sialolithiasis of the parotid gland that was difficult to detect by simple radiographic examination, a salivary stone was detected by both sialographic and ultrasonographic examination. Clearly separated salivary stones were also easily detected in each case by the ultrasonographic method, but multiple, gathered calculi were not precisely detected. The smallest sialolith that could be detected was approximately 2 x 3 mm in size. The rate of detection of salivary stones by using the ultrasonographic method was as high as that from using sialography. Because the examination is simple and noninvasive, its use to evaluate sialolithiasis is probably indicated more frequently, especially when there is acute infection in the gland.\r"

Intramedullary injection of Staphylococcus aureus was used to create osteomyelitis in the tibia of New Zealand white rabbits. Twenty-one days postinoculation, the animals were randomly assigned to one of the following six treatment groups: 1. debridement of the infected tibia; 2. debridement + bone graft; 3. debridement + bone graft + gelatin powder; 4. debridement + bone graft + gelatin powder supplemented with antibiotics; 5. debridement + gelatin powder supplemented with antibiotics; and 6. no surgical intervention. The debrided material was cultured for identification of microorganisms. All groups received cephalothin sodium, 100 micrograms/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours for 21-days. At time of death the tibia were assessed to determine the degree of healing. Radiographs, bacterial cultures and specimens for histologic study were obtained. Qualitative grading demonstrated a significant difference between groups (P less than .001). Groups (4 and 5) receiving local antibiotic supplementation demonstrated improved healing compared with the remaining groups. However, there was no difference between groups 4 and 5. Bacteriologic culturing indicated the greatest reduction in colony-forming units of S aureus in the postsacrifice graft sites to be in groups 4 and 5. Histologic findings paralleled qualitative assessment of healing of the gross specimens. The results of this study suggest that local antibiotic supplementation of graft preparations may be useful for treatment of chronic osseous infection.\r"

Clinical and radiographic evaluations at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively disclosed some displacement of granules initially, but this stabilized by 2 months. Three of 12 sites repaired with NPHA and four of 12 sites repaired with bone dehisced; however, all of these healed by 2 months. No untoward inflammatory or resorptive changes were observed beyond 3 months. The repaired alveolar processes were similar in bulk and contour in sites grafted with NPHA and with bone. Histologically, giant cells were noted at 3 months, but the number decreased at 6 months and remained at that level up to 12 months. The NPHA granules were embedded in mature fibrous connective tissue with osseous ingrowth evident in eight of the 12 defects. It was concluded that NPHA granules are an acceptable implant material for repair of residual alveolar clefts in which erupting teeth and orthodontic movements are not factors.\r"

Among the reasons for this difficulty are (1) shifts in conceptualizations of these two classes of disorders, (2) markedly different findings related to age, sex, other demographic variables, and stage of illness, (3) overlapping of diagnostic criteria, and (4) instability of Axis II diagnoses over time in these populations. Personality disorder may be preexisting, but not necessarily predisposing. Nevertheless, Axis II diagnoses can be made in alcohol and other drug dependent patients, and are present in these populations at higher prevalence rates than in the general public. Although amelioration of personality disorder will not in itself necessarily correct substance dependence, Axis II diagnoses are of considerable importance in treatment planning and prognosis. Recent and future research on the genetic typology of alcoholism may shed further light on the complex relationship between genetics, physiology, personality, and addiction.\r"

The commonly observed association between substance abuse and violent interactions has traditionally been explained as a cause-effect sequence. It is assumed that intoxication causes violence, and this viewpoint has traditionally dominated research on the subject as well as treatment methodology. This interpretation may lead treatment providers to assume that once abstinence from alcohol and other drugs is achieved, violence will also disappear. Researchers in the field of domestic violence argue that violence occurs both when substance abuse is present and absent. This article addresses the need to assess and treat both problem areas concurrently. In addition to providing assessment and treatment guidelines, the article describes the scope of the problem, etiological issues, and factors that may serve as barriers to treatment providers in identifying violence as a problem in chemically dependent relationship systems.\r"

  ".W": "In an article in the October-December 1988 issue of the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs, Stanton Peele expressed a number of opinions against alcoholism treatment and in favor of controlled drinking as a treatment goal for alcoholics. These opinions are examined critically and found to be contradicted by recent studies, empirical observations, and reinterpretations of earlier studies. It is concluded that marginal scholarship, partial and/or inaccurate representations of research, and inappropriate generalizations do not constitute the basis for drawing reliable and valid conclusions about alcoholism treatment or about controlled drinking as a feasible treatment goal for alcoholics.\r"

  ".W": "CGS 19755 (cis-4-phosphonomethyl-2-piperidine-carboxylic acid), a competitive antagonist at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-preferring receptors, blocked both NMDA-induced convulsions in normal CF1 mice and sound-induced wild running in seizure-prone DBA/2 mice. The ED50 values for CGS 19755 to produce these effects (in the range of 2 mg/kg i.p.) were at least 3-fold lower than those which impaired the traction reflex, an index of motor coordination. When administered p.o. by gavage, CGS 19755 had little or no effect in these test procedures. In an experimental model of anxiety in rats, CGS 19755 significantly increased conflict responding within a relatively narrow dose range (minimum effective dose, 1.73 mg/kg i.p.). At higher doses of CGS 19755, this effect appeared to be obscured by drug-induced reductions in overall responding. Potential muscle relaxant effects were also suggested by the generalization of CGS 19755 to diazepam discriminative stimuli (ED50 = 9.0 mg/kg i.p.) and by impaired rotorod performance (ED50 = 6.2 mg/kg i.p.) in rats. Although some resemblances were apparent between the behavioral effects of CGS 19755 and those of phencyclidine-type drugs, the phencyclidine-like behaviors appeared only at considerably higher doses of CGS 19755 than those associated with anticonflict activity, and only partial generalization of CGS 19755 to dexoxadrol was observed at high doses. CGS 19755 promises to be an important new research tool for investigating the function of brain NMDA receptors.\r"

  ".W": "The antinociceptive action of U-50,488H [( trans-(+/-)-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)- cyclohexyl]benzeneacetamide]), a selective kappa-opioid receptor agonist, was antagonized by serotonergic (5-HT) but not by noradrenergic receptor antagonists. U-50,488H (i.c.v.) was antagonized by more than 2-fold by i.c.v. administered pindolol, methysergide, mianserin, ketanserin or pirenperone. A similar degree of antagonism of U-50,488H (i.c.v.) was found after intrathecal (i.t.) treatments with pindolol or methysergide but not with mianserin, ketanserin or pirenperone. When U-50,488H was given i.t., its antinociceptive action was antagonized by pindolol or methysergide administered i.t. but potentiated by mianserin, ketanserin or pirenperone administered i.t. Tolerance to the antinociceptive action of U-50,488H was induced in mice using slow release preparations of U-50,488H. A smaller degree of cross-tolerance to the antinociceptive action of 5-HT also developed. 5-HT receptor antagonists (pindolol or ketanserin) were coadministered with U-50,488H to test for their effect on the development of tolerance to U-50,488H. A greater degree of tolerance was observed after ketanserin administration whereas the development of tolerance was partially blocked by the coadministration of pindolol. Changes in the properties of the kappa-opioid, 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptor binding sites in the cortical, striatal and spinal tissues of control and U-50,488H-tolerant mice were investigated. There were no significant changes in the maximum binding values of [3H]ethylketazocine, [3H]-5-HT or [3H]ketanserin. The Kd values of all ligands increased approximately 2-fold in most of the regions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The validity of using EXP6803, a nonpeptide angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonist, and KAA8, an AII monoclonal antibody, as specific tools for studying the physiology of AII has been established previously. In this study, we used these specific probes to examine the role of blocking AII formation in the antihypertensive effect of captopril in conscious renal artery-ligated rats (RALRs), a high renin, renal hypertensive model. Mean arterial pressure and plasma renin activity in a typical group of RALRs averaged 175 +/- 5 mm Hg and 28.2 +/- 6.2 ng of angiotensin 1 per ml/hr (n = 6), respectively. The antihypertensive effect of captopril (3 mg/kg i.v.) was determined in RALRs given either EXP6803 (30 mg/kg + 2 mg/kg/min i.v.) or KAA8 (10 mg + 1 mg/min i.v. per rat) with the corresponding vehicle-treated RALRs. These doses of EXP6803 and KAA8 were very effective in blocking the pressor response to AII but not to norepinephrine or vasopressin in RALRs. Captopril decreased mean arterial pressure by 44 +/- 2 and 53 +/- 8 mm Hg in the groups treated with the vehicles of EXP6803 (n = 5) and KAA8 (n = 5), respectively. In the presence of EXP6803 (n = 5) or KAA8 (n = 5), the antihypertensive effect of captopril was almost or totally abolished. Indomethacin did not alter the antihypertensive effect of captopril. These results suggest that the antihypertensive effect of captopril in conscious RALRs is due mainly to the blockade of AII formation. Furthermore, circulating AII rather than locally formed AII appears to play a major role in maintaining hypertension in hypertension in RALRs.\r"

  ".W": "Although neuropeptide Y (NPY) is not a potent vasoconstrictor in many vascular beds, nanomolar concentrations of this peptide can potentiate the response of isolated blood vessels to sympathetic stimulation or exogenous vasoconstrictors. In the isolated perfused rabbit ear artery, NPY produces a concentration-related potentiation of the response to field stimulation. The potency of NPY in inducing potentiation of nerve-mediated vasoconstriction was not dependent on whether the NPY was administered intra- or extraluminally. In these perfused vessels the endothelium was intact. Similar potentiation of the response to field stimulation is also observed in superfused ring segments of rabbit ear artery, provided that the endothelium was not damaged mechanically. The response to field stimulation in the rabbit ear artery is mediated by the alpha-1 adrenoceptor; in contrast, stimulation induced contraction in the canine saphenous vein results from the activation of vascular alpha-2-adrenoceptors. Despite this difference, the effect of NPY in ring segments of canine saphenous vein was similar to that observed in the ear artery. NPY also produced an endothelium-dependent potentiation of the constrictor response to exogenous norepinephrine in superfused segments of both ear artery and saphenous vein. Although the NPY-induced potentiation of stimulation-induced vasoconstriction was not inhibited by indomethacin, suggesting that an arachidonic acid metabolite is not involved, the release of another endothelial-derived vasoconstrictor substance, as yet unidentified, by NPY may explain its ability to potentiate the responses to both nerve stimulation and a variety of exogenous vasoconstrictors.\r"

  ".W": "Phencyclidine (PCP) is a widely used drug of abuse; however, little is known of its effects on neuroendocrine function. The present study characterized the effects of the acute and chronic administration of PCP on the release of adrenocorticotropin, corticosterone and prolactin in the rat. For the acute studies, PCP hydrochloride (0.5-10.0 mg/kg s.c.) was administered and the subjects were sacrificed 15 to 300 min later. The acute administration of PCP produced rapid and long-lasting increases in plasma levels of adrenocorticotropin and corticosterone but decreased plasma levels of prolactin. For the chronic studies, PCP (1.0-20.0 mg/kg/day s.c.) was injected daily and the subjects sacrificed 60 min after injection on day 15. PCP continued to stimulate the pituitary-adrenal axis after chronic administration; however, there was a decrease in the magnitude of response, indicating the development of some degree of tolerance. In contrast, none of the doses of PCP tested decreased plasma prolactin levels in chronically treated subjects. There were no differences in plasma or brain levels of PCP in the chronically PCP-treated rats, indicating that tolerance was not due to changes in the biodisposition of PCP. These results indicate that PCP disrupts neuroendocrine function markedly in the rat. The differential development of tolerance to the effects of PCP on the pituitary-adrenal axis and prolactin release may indicate that different neurochemical substrates underlie the effects of PCP on different endocrine systems.\r"

  ".W": "Glucocorticoids exert their actions through a time-dependent, receptor-mediated, protein synthesis- and RNA synthesis-dependent mechanism. We have assessed the effects of 24-h culture of human neutrophils with dexamethasone on degranulation, chemotaxis, binding to vascular endothelium and formation of leukotriene B4. Purified neutrophils contained an average of 2896 [3H]dexamethasone binding sites per cell with a Kd of 4.1 X 10(-9) M for [3H]dexamethasone binding. Cells exposed to dexamethasone (10(-6) M) released equal or greater quantities of the lysosomal enzymes, lysozyme and beta-glucuronidase in response to formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, serum activated zymosan, and the tumor promoting phorbol diester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate compared to controls. Culture with dexamethasone also did not inhibit neutrophil chemotaxis in response to a range of concentrations of formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, or did it inhibit binding of neutrophils to cultured endothelial cells stimulated by either leukocyte activators (formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine and platelet-activating factor) or endothelial activators (interleukin-1, lipopolysaccharide or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate). Spontaneous adherence of neutrophils to endothelial cells was inhibited (82.9 +/- 6.8% of control, P less than .025, n = 18). Neither in vitro or in vivo glucocorticoids inhibited neutrophil leukotriene B4 formation induced by either the calcium ionophore A23187 or serum activated zymosan. We conclude that human neutrophils are not functionally inactivated by glucocorticoids and suggest that the mechanism by which glucocorticoids inhibit neutrophil accumulation at inflammatory sites may be by inhibition of the production of chemoattractants and endothelial activators rather than inhibition of their actions.\r"

In the absence of thiorphan, the rank order of potency of mammalian tachykinins was NKA greater than NKB much greater than SP. The maximal response to SP did not exceed 40% of that to NKA or NKB. Thiorphan (10 microM) had no effect on twitches per se, but increased the potency and maximum effect of mammalian tachykinins. [Pro9]-SP sulfone, a selective NK-1 receptor agonist had no effect, either in the absence or presence of thiorphan. [MePhe7]-NKB had some potentiating effect, but only at micromolar concentrations. [Nle10]-NKA (4-10) and [beta-Ala8]-NKA (4-10), two selective NK-2 agonists displayed good activity. [Nle10]-NKA (4-10) was potentiated by thiorphan. On the other hand, the action of [beta Ala8]-NKA (4-10) was completely thiorphan-resistant. These findings indicate that estimate of activity of tachykinins and tachykinin related peptides in this bioassay is influenced markedly by peptide degradation via a thiorphan-sensitive mechanism. NK-2 receptors are the main if not the sole mediators of the response to tachykinins in this bioassay organ.\r"

  ".W": "Characterization of dopamine (DA) receptor subtypes was examined on the canine exocrine pancreas using selective DA receptor agonists and antagonists in the isolated and blood-perfused pancreas of anesthetized dogs. Each drug was injected i.a. in a single bolus fashion. Graded doses of DA (0.01-3 mumol) produced dose-dependent increases in the secretory rate of pancreatic juice, with a maximum effect at approximately 1 mumol. SCH23390 (3-30 nmol), a selective D-1 DA receptor antagonist, caused a progressive parallel shift to the right in the dose-response curve for DA-induced pancreatic secretion without changes in the maximal response. High doses of RS-sulpiride (0.3-3 mumol) or haloperidol (1-3 mumol), a mixed D-1/D-2 DA receptor antagonist, also caused a rightward shift in the DA dose-response curve. However, domperidone (3 mumol), a selective D-2 DA receptor antagonist, did not antagonize the DA-induced pancreatic exocrine secretion. A modified Schild analysis of the data indicates that SCH23390 is approximately 2 and 3 orders of magnitude more potent than RS-sulpiride and haloperidol, respectively. In addition, the stimulatory effects of DA (0.01-3 mumol), SKF38393 (0.1-10 mumol, a selective D-1 DA receptor agonist) and LY171555 (1-10 mumol, a selective D-2 DA receptor agonist) on pancreatic secretion were demonstrated. The rank order of agonist potency was DA greater than SKF38393 greater than LY171555. The secretory response to LY171555 was inhibited completely by pretreatment with SCH23390 (30 nmol).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Many cultured murine cortical neurons that would otherwise die after exposure to 500 microM N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) or glutamate could be rescued by the late addition of NMDA antagonists to the bathing medium. D-2-Amino-5-phosphonovalerate (D-APV), MK-801 (5-methyl-10, 11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5, 10-imine maleate) and dextrorphan all produced concentration-dependent neuroprotection, with EC50 about 10, 0.3 and 3 microM, respectively, and similar efficacy. The fraction of the doomed neuronal population that could be rescued depended on the time interval between washout of NMDA and antagonist addition, starting at a maximum of 40 to 80% with immediate addition, and decaying to zero after 30 min. D-APV only needed to be present for 30 min for near maximal protection. The ability of NMDA antagonists to rescue doomed neurons was not mimicked by several other drugs: 1 mM gamma-D-glutamyl-aminomethyl sulfonate, 1 mM L-glutamate diethyl ester, 10 microM 6-nitro-7-cyano-quinoxaline-2,3-dione, 1 mM secobarbital, 100 microM diphenylhydantoin, 10 microM nifedipine or 3 microM tetrodotoxin. The broad spectrum glutamate antagonist kynurenate had a protective action similar to that of D-APV, but when added to D-APV did not improve neuroprotection. Neurons could also be rescued by the delayed removal of extracellular calcium for 30 min after exposure to NMDA. In contrast, replacement of sodium with choline actually enhanced resultant neuronal damage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Two groups (n = 7) of pentobarbital-anesthetized pigs (12-15 kg) were infused over 40 min with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 200 micrograms/kg) and continuously resuscitated with normal saline (1 ml/kg min): LPS-Control (no pretreatment) and LPS-Decomplemented (pretreatment 18 hr before study with 500-1,500 units of Naje haje cobra venom factor, CVF). Prior treatment with CVF: i) decreased the mean titer of total hemolytic C' to 15.9% of pretreatment levels; ii) significantly decreased post-LPS plasma concentrations of immunoreactive TxB2 (TxA2 metabolite) and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (PGI2 metabolite); iii) abrogated the early transient decrease in cardiac index observed in the LPS-Control group; iv) tended to improve post-LPS visceral perfusion assessed using radioactive microspheres; and v) had no discernible effect on the late sustained decrease in SVRI observed following infusion of LPS. We conclude that C' activation is a major determinant of LPS-induced prostanoid release in vivo, although our results do not support the view that C'-dependent release of PGI2 is an important factor contributing to low SVRI in resuscitated endotoxic shock.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective review of 304 consecutive microvascular free flaps to the lower extremity was done to identify the patterns of usage, results, and problems. The most common indication (91%) was for the replacement of extensive tissue loss caused by motor-vehicle injuries. Most of the defects were below the mid-tibia (73%). The associated compound fractures were predominantly gradable as Gustilo type IIIb&c. The latissimus dorsi, the rectus abdominus, and the scapular skin were the flaps used most commonly for coverage (77%). The overall flap failure rate was 8%, compared with 3% for our series of non-lower extremity cases, and 0% for the non-traumatic lower extremity cases. The magnitude of the traumatic insult was the most significant factor associated with anastomotic failure. The rate of anastomotic thrombosis doubled in the presence of vascular trauma, increased threefold in the presence of larger bony defects, and increased fivefold when vein grafts were needed. Experience was important in reducing the complications and improving the results. Fourteen patients (6%) underwent an amputation within the first 3 months, ten of them because of flap failure. Of 85 patients followed up for over one year, 91% had recovered good to excellent leg function. The ability to add healthy and well vascularized tissue to the traumatized limb is critical for the achievement of: 1) early definitive wound healing and restoration of function; 2) salvage of many impending amputations; 3) better prosthetic stump reconstructions; 4) better esthetic results.\r"

Soft-tissue coverage was the most frequent (56.3%) indication, followed by unstable wound, extensive bone loss, chronic osteomyelitis, insensate scar, loss of specialized tissue, and contour deformity. Most of the reconstructed defects (72.4%) were located in the lower extremity and the great majority (42.3%) involved the lower third of the leg. Motor vehicle accidents were the main (45.6%) cause of the defects followed by motorcycle injuries (28.6%), industrial accidents (15.1%), farming accidents (3.6%), and gunshot wounds (3.3%). Seventeen types of free vascularized cutaneous, myocutaneous, muscular, osseous, osteocutaneous, fascial, fasciocutaneous, sensate, and specialized tissue transfers were used. The latissimus dorsi free flap was the most frequently performed tissue transfer. Only 2.3% of the flaps were done within the first 48 hours post-trauma, although 76.5% of the transfers were completed within the first 2 weeks after injury. The overall success rate was 96.4% and the incidence of re-exploration was 14.7%. Free tissue transfers provide a very reliable method for dealing with difficult reconstructive problems in trauma patients.\r"

Quantitative Doppler spectrum analysis of 64 arteriovenous fistulas was correlated with the outcome of digital subtraction angiography. The best Doppler parameter for the detection of a stenosis was the peak systolic frequency. In graft arteriovenous fistulas the use of this parameter resulted in a diagnostic accuracy of 86%, a sensitivity of 92%, and a specificity of 84% in the detection of stenoses. In Brescia-Cimino arteriovenous fistulas the diagnosis of anastomotic stenoses was possible with a diagnostic accuracy of 81%, a sensitivity of 79%, and a specificity of 84%. Measurement of peak systolic frequency ratios or end-diastolic frequencies had no additional diagnostic value for the detection of stenoses. The diagnosis of efferent vein stenoses was very accurate with duplex investigation (accuracy 96%, sensitivity 95%, and a specificity of 97%. We conclude that duplex scanning is a promising noninvasive method for the diagnosis of stenoses in arteriovenous fistulas created for hemodialysis access.\r"

  ".W": "Between January 1978 and December 1986, 69 polytetrafluoroethylene bypass grafts on the ascending aorta were placed in 53 patients with atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the innominate and left common carotid arteries. Thirty-six patients had symptoms predominantly of amaurosis fugax, verebrobasilar ischemia, and upper limb ischemia. The remaining 17 patients had no symptoms but had severe hemodynamically significant occlusive disease. All operations were accomplished via median sternotomy. One patient died after surgery (operative mortality rate 1.9%), and one patient had minor postoperative neurologic deficit that partially improved on long-term follow-up. Patency of the reconstruction was routinely assessed by a Doppler device combining (1) a continuous wave Doppler and (2) real-time mechanical sector B-mode imaging with frequencies of 3.5 MHz and 7.5 MHz. There were two early asymptomatic occlusions; one was related to a technical error that was successfully revised and the other to low systemic perfusion. The mean follow-up time was 50.5 months. Two patients were lost to follow-up and a further six patients died, for a cumulative 5-year survival rate of 84.9%. One patient had only partial improvement in symptoms and one patient sustained a late postoperative neurologic deficit after internal carotid occlusion distal to a patent aortocarotid bypass. The remaining patients were free of symptoms. There were no infective complications. All the patients underwent late assessment by Doppler ultrasonography and B-mode scanning. One asymptomatic occlusion was thereby identified to be a result of diminished runoff. The overall secondary patency rate at 5 years was 96.1%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Prosthetic bypass grafts placed to the distal lower extremity often fail because of an occlusive tissue response in the perianastomotic region. The origin of the cells that comprise this occlusive lesion and the causes of the cellular proliferation are not known. To increase our understanding of this process we cultured cells from hyperplastic lesions obtained from patients at the time of reexploration for lower extremity graft failure, and we studied their identity and growth factor production in tissue culture. These cultures contain cells that express muscle-specific actin isoforms, shown by immunohistochemical staining, consistent with vascular smooth muscle origin. These cultures also released material that stimulated smooth muscle cell growth. A portion of this activity was similar to platelet-derived growth factor, since preincubation with antibody-to-human platelet-derived growth factor partially blocked the mitogenic effect of medium conditioned by human anastomotic hyperplastic cells. These conditioned media also contained material that competed with platelet-derived growth factor for its receptor, as measured in a radioreceptor assay. Northern blot analysis showed that these cells contain messenger RNA that encodes the A chain but not the B chain of platelet-derived growth factor. In addition, these cells contain messenger RNA that encodes a platelet-derived growth factor receptor. We conclude that cultured smooth muscle cells from human anastomotic hyperplastic lesions express genes for platelet-derived growth factor A chain and a platelet-derived growth factor receptor and secrete biologically active molecules similar to platelet-derived growth factor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

According to a survey of the English-language medical literature this was the fourth such patient successfully treated. C. fetus sepsis associated with an abdominal aortic aneurysm was first reported in 1971. The first patient to survive reconstruction of an aortic tube graft aneurysm infected with C. fetus was reported in 1983. Because the natural history of an aneurysm infected by C. fetus appears to be rapid progression to rupture, patients should be operated on promptly. All patients reported in the literature who were operated on before rupture survived. Survival was independent of the type of reconstruction. When the aneurysm ruptured all patients died. Whereas extraanatomic bypass is generally considered the procedure of choice for an infected abdominal aneurysm, the aneurysms of our patient and three other patients cited in the literature were reconstructed with anatomically placed prosthetic grafts. In the absence of other contraindications such as a grossly evident purulent infection, an abdominal aortic aneurysm infected by C. fetus may represent a subset of infected aneurysms that can be treated successfully with an anatomically placed prosthetic graft and antibiotics.\r"

The technology of the device, which is now capable of sensing and terminating both ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, has evolved rapidly. Although still not an ideal antiarrhythmic device, it has already had a major impact on arrhythmic mortality with a marked reduction in the sudden death rates in a high-risk patient population.\r"

This review introduces the mast cell into this picture, emphasizing recent knowledge gained from a study of experimental chronic graft-vs-host disease and scleroderma itself. In both of these situations, increased mast cell activity occurs. A link between the activation of both endothelial cells and fibroblasts may be provided by the family of heparin-binding growth factors. These cytokines are produced by many cells and are bound, protected, and enhanced by heparin, which may be provided by the activated mast cells. These and other growth factors may be responsible for endothelial proliferation and excess collagen production by fibroblasts. This enlarged schema should provide additional points for therapeutic intervention in scleroderma.\r"

For older populations, evidence is contradictory and no recommendation can presently be made for or against hematuria screening. A population-based randomized, controlled trial of hematuria screening in the elderly is urgently needed. Proteinuria screening is not recommended in any healthy, asymptomatic adult population, since four population-based studies have found that fewer than 1.5% of those with positive dipsticks have serious and treatable urinary tract disorders.\r"

Conventional antimicrobial regimens for asymptomatic bacteriuria have proved efficacious only for pregnant women. We conclude that pregnant women should be screened for bacteriuria, but with the more sensitive urine culture, because treatment prevents serious fetal and maternal sequelae. Dipstick screening may be justified in women who are over 60 years of age or diabetic. The prevalence of bacteriuria in other groups is too low to justify screening.\r"

Antepartum death rates for normally formed singletons were similar in the two groups, regardless of cause of prior risk status. Despite the counting policy, most of these fetuses were dead by the time the mothers received medical attention. The study does not rule out a beneficial effect, but at best, the policy would have to be used by about 1250 women to prevent 1 unexplained antepartum late fetal death, and an adverse effect is just as likely. In addition, formal routine counting would use considerable extra resources.\r"

In contrast, the frequency of c-Ki-ras mutations did not differ between proximal and distal cancers.

At the 1 month follow-up 66% of A0 and 68% of A1 patients had recovered. In patients with initial impairment of consciousness the effect of one session of HBO (group B1, n = 145) was compared with that of two sessions (group B2, n = 141); all group B patients also received 4 h of NBO. At 1 month of follow-up 54% group B1 and 52% group B2 patients had recovered. The 7 patients left with neuropsychiatric sequelae (3 B1, 4 B2) and the 4 who died (2 B1, 2 B2) had all presented with coma. HBO was not useful in patients who did not lose consciousness during carbon monoxide intoxication, irrespective of their carboxyhaemoglobin level, nor were two sessions of HBO in patients who sustained only a brief loss of consciousness. The prognosis is poorest for those presenting with coma; the trial needs to be pursued in this group of patients until the power of the study is sufficient to demonstrate the value or otherwise of HBO.\r"

Viable counts of the organism in fluids from 6 of the most severely affected hearts ranged from 10(4) to 10(7) colony-forming units/ml. S enteridis PT4 was also isolated from 8 of 20 fresh chilled chickens on retail sale.

  ".U": "89344156\r", 
  ".W": "Islet-amyloid deposits, which are a common feature of Type II diabetes mellitus, are derived from the polymerization of a putative hormone identified as IAPP. IAPP is synthesized by normal islet beta cells and probably is cosecreted with insulin. Although the physiologic function of IAPP and its role in the pathogenesis of Type II diabetes mellitus are just beginning to be unraveled, IAPP may play an important part in the development of this most common form of diabetes mellitus by opposing the action of insulin in peripheral tissues. The polymerization of IAPP to form extracellular islet-amyloid deposits may further contribute to the development of Type II diabetes mellitus by destroying islet cells and by disrupting the passage of glucose and hormones to and from them. Substantial evidence indicates that the propensity of IAPP to polymerize and form extracellular amyloid deposits in only certain species (e.g., humans, cats, and raccoons) is directly associated with an intrinsically amyloidogenic part of the molecule--i.e., positions 20 through 29 of IAPP. The inherent amyloidogenicity of IAPP in these species may be further facilitated by increased beta-cell production of IAPP, leading to a high local concentration that predisposes to polymerization. The latter possibility is supported by studies demonstrating that IAPP production by islet beta cells is increased in normoglycemic cats with impaired glucose tolerance. Although increased production of IAPP may initially cause insulin resistance, prolonged overproduction of IAPP may ultimately impair insulin secretion by leading to the progressive deposition of insoluble islet amyloid, a finding apparent in most subjects with overt diabetes. If, as these studies suggest, increased IAPP production is linked to the development of Type II diabetes mellitus, further studies must address the genetic and nongenetic factors that influence this important biologic change in humans and some animal species.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify the role of sodium intake in the regulation of blood pressure in obese subjects, we measured blood pressure in 60 obese and 18 nonobese adolescents after successive two-week periods of a high-salt diet (greater than 250 mmol of sodium per day) and a low-salt diet (less than 30 mmol per day). When they were changed from a high-salt to a low-salt diet, the obese group had a significantly larger mean change (+/- SE) in mean arterial pressure (-12 +/- 1 mm Hg) than did the nonobese group (+1 +/- 2 mm Hg; P less than 0.001). The variables that best predicted the degree of sodium sensitivity were the fasting plasma insulin level, the plasma aldosterone level while the low-salt diet was being given, the plasma norepinephrine level while the high-salt diet was being given, and the percentage of body weight made up by fat. Fifty-one of the obese adolescents were also studied before and after a 20-week weight-loss program. After the weight-loss program, the 36 subjects who lost more than 1 kg of body weight had a reduced sensitivity of blood pressure to sodium (difference from value during high-salt diet to that during low-salt diet, -1 +/- 1 mm Hg). The blood pressure of the remaining 15 adolescents was still sensitive to sodium intake (-11 +/- 3 mm Hg). These results support the hypothesis that the blood pressure of obese adolescents is sensitive to dietary sodium intake and that this sensitivity may be due to the combined effects of the hyperinsulinemia, hyperaldosteronism, and increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system that are characteristic of obesity.\r"

  ".W": "Within the last decade, Lyme borreliosis has emerged as a complex new infection whose distribution is worldwide. The disorder is caused by a recently recognized spirochete, B. burgdorferi, transmitted by ticks of the I. ricinus complex. Certain species of mice are critical in the life cycle of the spirochete, and deer appear to be crucial to the tick. Although the disorder's basic outlines are similar everywhere, there are regional variations in the causative spirochete, animal hosts, and clinical manifestations of the illness. In the United States, Lyme disease commonly begins in summer with a characteristic skin lesion, erythema migrans, accompanied by flu-like or meningitis-like symptoms. Weeks or months later, the patients may have neurologic or cardiac abnormalities, migratory musculoskeletal pain, or arthritis, and more than a year after onset, some patients have chronic joint, skin, or neurologic abnormalities. After the first several weeks of infection, almost all patients have a positive antibody response to the spirochete, and serologic determinations are currently the most practical laboratory aid in diagnosis. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics is usually curative, but longer courses of therapy are often needed later in the illness, and some patients may not respond.\r"

  ".W": "We assessed the quantity (relative cellular abundance) and quality (approximate molecular weight) of dystrophin in muscle biopsies from 97 patients with a diagnosis of possible Becker muscular dystrophy. Fifty-four (all male) had dystrophin abnormalities and were deemed to have true Becker muscular dystrophy. The other 43 patients (14 female, 29 male) had no detectable dystrophin abnormalities. Of the dystrophin-verified Becker dystrophy patients, 35% (19/54) had a family history consistent with X-linked recessive inheritance. On the other hand, none of the 43 patients with apparently normal dystrophin had a clear X-linked family history, suggesting that few of these 43 actually had a form of Becker dystrophy. The data suggest that of all patients with a clinical picture consistent with Becker dystrophy but no family history, about 60% will be true Becker patients. The correlation of both the biochemical and clinical data suggests that Duchenne/Becker dystrophy can be divided into 4 clinically useful categories: Duchenne dystrophy (wheelchair at about age 11 years; dystrophin quantity less than 3% of normal); severe Becker dystrophy (wheelchair age 13 to 20 years; dystrophin 3% to 10%); and moderate/mild Becker dystrophy (wheelchair greater than 20 years; dystrophin quantity greater than or equal to 20%). Given the observed clinical variability of Becker dystrophy, it appears that dystrophin analysis is required for accurately distinguishing between Becker dystrophy and clinically similar autosomal recessive myopathies.\r"

  ".W": "Ninety-eight patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) in the chronic progression phase entered a 3-year clinical trial to determine if azathioprine (AZ) alone or with adrenal cortical steroids stabilizes the course of MS. In group AM, the patients took AZ throughout and methylprednisolone (MP) for the first 36 weeks. Group AP received AZ and placebo instead of MP. Group PP took placebos for both drugs. We adjusted the AZ to maintain the total white blood cell count within 3,000 to 4,000/mm3; we gave the MP in a fixed dose \"pulse\" and alternate-day regimen. The \"intent-to-treat\" groups had no statistically significant differences in the rates of progression among the 3 treatments. Subgroup analysis suggests that patients in the AM group who completed treatment exactly according to protocol did statistically significantly better than the placebo recipients using the sum of Standard Neurological Examination scores, slightly better using the quantitative neuro-performance tests, but no better using Mickey's Illness Severity Scores or Kurtzke's Disability Status Scale. Also, the AZ-treated groups had half the relapse rate of the placebo-treated group. Adverse reactions to AZ accounted for most withdrawals. Hematologic and hepatic abnormalities were significantly associated with AZ, but serious non-MS abnormalities were uncommon and were equally distributed among the 3 groups. Addition of MP to the AZ slightly improved the efficacy of the treatment, but also increased the adverse effects. The benefits of AZ with or without steroids did not outweigh the risks, and therefore we do not recommend this treatment for patients with chronic progressive MS.\r"
