  ".W": "We have previously reported that IgM monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that recognize surface carbohydrate determinants shared between schistosomula, cercariae, and miracidia block antibody/complement dependent killing of schistosomula in vitro. Binding assays that make use of one of the IgM mAb labeled with 125I demonstrated that serum from chronically infected mice (CMS) contained high levels of competing antibody, whereas serum from mice vaccinated with irradiated cercariae (VMS) contained little antibody of this specificity. Absorption of CMS with cercariae that removed antibodies to schistosomulum surface carbohydrate determinants increased its ability to kill schistosomula in vitro; absorption of VMS with cercariae failed to alter the lethal activity of the serum. Furthermore, fractionation of CMS by protein A Sepharose chromatography demonstrated that the IgG fraction had an increased lethal activity compared with unfractionated serum; this result was not seen with VMS. Finally, the IgM fraction of CMS was shown to block in vitro killing of the IgG fractions of both CMS and VMS. These data suggest that the blocking activities observed with the IgM mAb are contained within the serum of chronically infected mice but not in the serum of mice vaccinated with irradiated cercariae.\r"

  ".W": "In contrast to many other strains, inbred P strain mice fail to develop significant levels of resistance to challenge Schistosoma mansoni infection as a result of prior vaccination with radiation-attenuated cercariae. In this study, the relationship between defects in resistance and development of cell-mediated immune reactivity was examined. Although splenocytes from immunized P mice demonstrated deficiencies in production of macrophage-activating lymphokine(s) in response to either antigenic or mitogenic stimulation, other aspects of T lymphocyte responsiveness including blastogenesis, production of interleukin 2, interleukin 3 and macrophage chemotactic factor, as well as helper cell function for secondary plaque-forming cell response to a T-dependent antigen and allospecific cytolytic T cell reactivity, appeared to be comparable with those of C57BL/6 mice, a strain that is protected by vaccination against S. mansoni. FACS comparison revealed no significant deficits in percentages of Thy-1+, Lyt-1+, or L3T4+ splenocytes in vaccinated P mice. The P-associated defect in production of macrophage-activating factor appeared to be at the level of the T cell rather than the antigen-presenting cell, because macrophages from P mice could reconstitute the lymphokine-producing capacity of T-enriched splenocytes from immunized, resistant (C57BL/6 X P) F1 or B10.P mice, whereas the converse was not true. These results indicate that vaccinated P mice have a selective defect in T cell function for production of macrophage-activating lymphokine, which is manifested as a failure to produce activated larvicidal macrophages at the site of specific antigen challenge in vivo and may be associated with the failure of this strain to become resistant to S. mansoni.\r"

The genes encoding the variable (V) regions of these antibodies have been studied by using the DNA hybridization technique of Southern, as well as by gene cloning and sequencing. Hybridization of DNA from 14 different cell lines with a kappa-chain probe revealed that the different cell lines used one of two different gene rearrangements to encode the recombined V region gene. There was a perfect correlation between light chain rearrangement, idiotype expression, and fine specificity. Hybridization analyses of the heavy chain revealed a more complex pattern. Seven hybridomas had the rearranged heavy chain V region genes on a 4.4 kb EcoRI restriction fragment. Others were found on restriction fragments that differed in length by several hundred base pairs. The recombined heavy chain V region genes were cloned from three different hybridoma cell lines secreting anti-(T,G)-A--L antibodies, all of which express the same idiotype and fine specificity pattern. Restriction mapping and sequencing indicate that all three utilize the same V gene, identified as the 186-2 germline gene. However, different D and J genes are used to encode each of the antibodies. In contrast to the results seen in other antigen systems, heavy chain D and J genes do not have a major influence on idiotype expression and fine specificity of antibodies to the synthetic polypeptide (T,G)-A--L.\r"

  ".W": "The goal of the present study was to evaluate the relationship among function, Lyt phenotype, and MHC recognition specificity in primary allospecific T cell populations. By using Lyt-2+ and L3T4+ T cells obtained from the same responder populations, we assessed the ability of T cells of each phenotype to generate cytotoxic effector cells (CTL) and IL 2-secreting helper T cells in response to either class I or class II MHC allodeterminants. It was found that a discordance between Lyt phenotype and MHC recognition specificity does exist in primary allospecific T cells, but only in one T cell subpopulation with limited functional potential: namely, Lyt-2+ T cells with cytotoxic, but not helper, function that recognize class II MHC alloantigens. Target cell lysis by these Lyt-2+ class II-allospecific CTL was inhibited by anti-Ia monoclonal antibodies (mAb), but not anti-Lyt-2 mAb, indicating that they recognized class II MHC determinants as their \"restriction\" specificity and not as their \"nominal\" specificity even though they were Lyt-2+. A second allospecific T cell subset with limited functional potential was also identified but whose Lyt phenotype and MHC restriction specificity were not discordant: namely, an L3T4+ T cell subset with helper, but not cytotoxic, function specific for class I MHC allodeterminants presented in the context of self-Ia. Thus, the present study demonstrates that primary allospecific T cell populations contain phenotypically identical subpopulations of helper and effector cells that express fundamentally different MHC recognition specificities. Because the recognition specificities expressed by mature T cells reflect the selection pressures they encountered during their differentiation into functional competence, these findings suggest that functionally distinct but phenotypically identical T cell subsets may be selected independently of one another during ontogeny. Thus, the existence of Lyt-2+ CTL specific for class II allodeterminants can be explained by the hypothesis that the association of Lyt phenotype with MHC recognition specificity results from the process of thymic selection that these Lyt-2+ effector cells avoid.\r"

Within the CD8+ population, JRAI preferentially spares OKM1+ and Leu-11+ cells. These CD8+ cells retain suppressor-effector potential and show enriched natural killer cell activity. Within the CD4+ population, JRAI preferentially kills cells within the Leu-8+ subset, which contains suppressor-inducer cells, and spares the Leu-8- subset, which contains the helpers for immunoglobulin synthesis.

  ".W": "Congenital deficiency of the enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA) leads to severe combined immunodeficiency. 2'Deoxycoformycin (dCF), a tightly binding inhibitor of ADA, can induce the metabolic state of ADA deficiency. In vivo, the drug causes specific impairment of lymphocyte function and shows strong immunosuppressive properties. However, to decide whether inhibition of the enzyme ADA offers an attractive approach for immunosuppressive therapy, more information is needed about the immunologic mechanisms affected. In human T cells, we investigated the effect of dCF and deoxyadenosine (AdR) on cell activation, interleukin 2 (IL 2) production, and IL 2 receptor induction after allogeneic and lectin-induced stimulation. After allogeneic stimulation, dCF and AdR affected several events in T cellular immune response. Early events in T cell activation showed to be most sensitive to the drugs. Primary MLC was completely inhibited by concentrations as low as 1 microM dCF and 1 microM AdR. The addition of human recombinant IL 2 (rIL 2) could not abrogate the inhibitory effect of the drugs. Apart from activation of T cells, the drugs interfered with proliferation of activated T cells. Two events in activated T cells were affected: IL 2 production and IL 2 receptor expression. In secondary MLC, IL 2 production was markedly reduced in the presence of 9 microM dCF and 60 microM AdR. These concentrations appeared also to affect IL 2 receptor expression in 12-day primary MLC cells stimulated with rIL 2. Lectin stimulation was also affected by the drugs. In phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated cultures, 9 microM dCF and 60 microM AdR resulted in inhibition of proliferation and IL 2 receptor expression, whereas IL 2 production was normal. It is concluded that dCF and AdR interfere with several events in T cellular immune response such as cell activation, IL 2 production, and IL 2 receptor expression. According to these results, inhibition of the enzyme ADA seems an attractive approach to immunosuppressive therapy.\r"

They are a heterogeneous group of antibodies thought to differ in pathogenicity. The degree of heterogeneity and the structural correlates of pathogenicity, however, remain poorly defined. To address these questions we have been generating anti-idiotypic antibodies to the anti-DNA antibodies found in the serum of SLE patients. In this paper we report the generation and characterization of a new murine monoclonal anti-idiotype, 8.12, that recognizes a subset of anti-DNA antibodies that is present in serum of approximately 50% of patients with SLE. The 8.12 anti-idiotype recognizes uniquely cationic anti-DNA antibodies, all of which express lambda light chains. In murine models of SLE, it has been suggested that cationic anti-DNA antibodies are preferentially deposited in the kidney. It may be, therefore, that 8.12 recognizes a subset of anti-DNA antibodies of particular pathogenic significance.\r"

Although the lpr T cells were capable of responding to these stimulants, the nature of the response and of the concentrations of ligand required differed sharply from the responses of normal adult T cells, and of adult L3T4-Lyt-2- thymocytes. There was a strong similarity but not identity when responses of 16 day fetal thymocytes were compared with those of lpr L3T4-Lyt-2- cells. The unusual functional properties of the lpr cells, such as high A23187 dose requirement for maximal proliferation, low percentage of IL 2 receptor-expressing cells, and low levels of IL 2 secretion, suggested that these cells are arrested at a stage of development similar to that of 16-day fetal thymocytes and before adult L3T4-/Lyt-2- thymocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Monoclonal antibodies to lymphokine-induced activation antigens of lymphocytes and macrophages were used to analyze the intragraft events occurring during acute rejection of rat heterotopic cardiac allografts. The cells present during untreated rejection were then compared with those present in situ after immunosuppression with the mouse anti-rat IL 2 receptor (anti-IL 2R) monoclonal antibody ART-18 or cyclosporin (CsA). Untreated rats rejected their grafts within 7 days, whereas rats receiving 10 days of i.v. ART-18 antibody therapy showed graft prolongation to more than 21 days, and rats receiving CsA for 7 days maintained their grafts indefinitely. Untreated rejection was associated with an influx of T (W3/13+) cells and macrophages (ED-1+, ED-2+). Activated mononuclear cells (IL 2R+) were identified within rejecting grafts from day 2, and their numbers peaked on days 4 to 6 when 15 to 20% of infiltrating leukocytes were IL 2R+. Double labeling studies of IL 2R+ cells present at day 6 showed surprisingly that both T cells and macrophages expressed IL 2R. In particular, although 55.8 +/- 6.9% (mean +/- SD) of IL 2R+ cells expressed the pan-T cell antigen 3/13, a similar proportion of IL 2R+ cells (49.8 +/- 8.2%) expressed the macrophage antigen ED-2. Conversely, both T cells and macrophage populations showed heterogeneity in their expression of IL 2R, because 39.2 +/- 12.2% of T cells and 31.0 +/- 13.4% of macrophages were IL 2R+. In addition, inflammatory macrophages at day 6 expressed the A1-3 antigen. Expression of this antigen by macrophages has previously been linked with development of macrophage procoagulant activity, and in this model intragraft inflammatory macrophages were closely associated with widespread deposits of fibrin. By comparison with untreated animals, rats treated with either ART-18 or CsA both lacked detectable IL 2R+ cells during the first 14 days post-transplantation (post-Tx), and showed significantly less cellular infiltration. However, although grafts of CsA-treated animals continued to remain IL 2R- and failed to stain with the macrophage activation marker A1-3, ART-18-treated rats showed increasing infiltration by both IL 2R+ mononuclear cells and A1-3+ macrophages, as well as increasing perivascular and interstitial fibrin deposition, prior to rejection by day 22. These studies document the presence of small number of activated intragraft T cells and macrophages during rat cardiac rejection, and show how CsA, and to a lesser extent anti-IL 2R therapy, inhibit this in situ activation and prolong graft survival.

  ".W": "Expression of receptors for IL 2 was believed initially to be restricted to T cells after their activation by IL 1 and antigen. However, recently IL 2 receptors (IL 2R) were demonstrated on activated B cells by using an anti-IL 2R monoclonal antibody (anti-Tac). In this study, we examined the capacity of cultured human alveolar macrophages, blood monocytes, and myelomonocytic (HL-60) or monoblast (U937) cell lines to bind three different anti-IL 2R monoclonal antibodies before or after stimulation with the monocyte-activating agents IFN-gamma, LPS, phorbol ester, or lymphokine-containing conditioned medium. For each of the four cell populations examined, resting unstimulated cells bound little or no anti-IL 2R antibody, as shown independently by quantitative cell binding assay and by immunoperoxidase labeling. By contrast, incubation with recombinant IFN-gamma, conditioned medium, or to a lesser extent, native or recombinant IL 2 itself, resulted in a significant enhancement of anti-IL 2 receptor monoclonal antibody binding by all four populations, whereas LPS, PMA, or IL 1 had no effect. In addition, membrane binding of anti-Tac antibody, similar to that seen after stimulation of normal lung macrophages with IFN-gamma, was detected by using macrophages obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage of five patients with active pulmonary sarcoidosis. These findings are consistent with the expression of a functional IL 2R on activated cells of the monocyte lineage, since anti-Tac binding to IFN-gamma-treated HL-60 cells was inhibited by addition of excess IL-2; specific binding of anti-IL 2 monoclonal antibodies was detected in the presence of exogenous IL 2; and a 50 to 55 kD molecule was immunoprecipitated from both activated lung macrophages and T lymphoblasts by using anti-Tac antibody. We conclude that human mononuclear phagocytes can be induced by lymphokines to express IL 2R, and that such IL 2R+ macrophages can be detected in vivo during inflammation.\r"

The release of IL 2R was transient, reaching optimal levels within 72 hr after antigen challenge and gradually declining to background levels thereafter, when the cells were subcultured in IL 2-enriched medium. The decrease in the amount of IL 2R released during culture in IL 2-containing medium paralleled the decrement in cellular IL 2R detected in cell lysates, in cell surface-expressed IL 2R as determined by cytofluorometry, as well as in high-affinity IL 2R. In contrast, IL 2R were constitutively released by an IL 2-dependent T cell clone. Soluble IL 2R might exert an immunoregulatory function by competing with cellular IL 2R for IL 2 binding.\r"

The U937 factor also inhibited the production of IL 2 by a human leukemic cell line, JURKAT, stimulated with PHA. The U937 suppressor factor interfered with the expression of Tac antigen (IL 2 receptor) on PPD- or PHA-stimulated blood T lymphocytes. The inhibitory activity of the U937 factor on Tac expression was not affected by the addition of IL 2 or a crude lymphokine-containing T cell supernatant. Tac expression was more sensitive than IL 2 production to inhibition by U937-conditioned medium. The U937 suppressor factor was precipitable by 33 to 67% saturated ammonium sulfate and was inactivated at pH 2 or pH 11. Sephacryl S-200 Gel filtration analysis of U937 culture supernatants revealed that the inhibitory activities for blastogenesis, IL 2 production, and Tac expression co-purified in fractions with an apparent m.w. between 67,000 and 130,000. These data indicate that U937 spontaneously produces a macromolecular suppressive factor with major locus of action on the production of IL 2 and the expression of the IL 2 receptor.\r"

Cross-linking studies indicate that the VLA-2 structure exists on the cell surface as a 165,000 Mr heavy chain (alpha 2) in noncovalent 1:1 association with a 130,000 Mr light chain (beta). The monoclonal antibody A-1A5, which reacts with the beta subunit common to all VLA structures, was able to completely preclear VLA-2, indicating that all of the alpha 2 subunit was associated with VLA beta-chain. The specificity of 12F1 for VLA-2 allowed independent immunoprecipitation and flow cytometry analysis of this alpha 2 beta structure separate from any other VLA structures that may have been present such as VLA-1 or free beta-subunit. Subunit dissociation studies were used to demonstrate that 12F1 recognizes an epitope on the alpha 2 chain on VLA-2, which is consistent with the 12F1 specificity for VLA-2 alone among the VLA proteins. Analysis of activated T cells indicated that VLA-2, like VLA-1, is another \"very late\" appearing T cell activation antigen that arises concurrently with VLA-1 starting at day 7 and increasing through 2 wk. VLA-2 was found on many of the same cells as VLA-1 (inactivated T cells, T cell leukemia cells, fibroblasts, SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells), but VLA-1 and VLA-2 can be expressed independently, because VLA-2 was also present on VLA-1-negative cells such as HSB and platelets, and VLA-1 was present on VLA-2-negative C8215 cells.\r"

The effect of age on the T cell-mediated competency of cells from two different lymphoid compartments, Peyer's patch (PP) and spleen, was studied. PP cells of aged C57BL/6 mice retained a greater capacity to proliferate in response to concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin, and alloantigen and to generate alloimmune cytotoxic cells than did splenocytes of aged mice when compared with their young counterparts. These results could not be explained by significant shifts in the response kinetics or in the proportions of T cells in individual tissues. These results support the concept that lymphoid compartments are not equally sensitive to the deleterious effects of the aging process.\r"

  ".W": "Prolactin (PRL)-stimulated ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity and subsequent proliferation are inhibited by the cyclopeptides cyclosporine (CsA) and didemnin B (DB) in Nb 2 node lymphoma cells. Similar concentrations of these agents also inhibit 125I-PRL binding, suggesting that their inhibitory effects on these PRL-dependent physiologic responses are mediated at least in part at the level of PRL receptor interactions. The phorbol ester TPA stimulated ODC activity and [3H]thymidine incorporation to 54% and 31% that of a near-optimal mitogenic concentration of PRL (10 ng/ml), suggesting that mitogenesis in these cells is coupled to some degree to the activation of protein kinase C (PKC). The calcium ionophore A23187 increased ODC activity only slightly and actually decreased [3H]thymidine incorporation to a value below the \"cells only\" controls. The addition of TPA plus A23187 did not further enhance the effects of TPA to elevate ODC activity and [3H]thymidine incorporation. However, A23187 significantly elevated PRL-stimulated ODC activity with a subsequent inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation, suggesting a block of entry into S phase. Both cyclopeptides decreased the elevation of ODC activity in G1 phase of cell cycle in response to PRL, suggestive of a site of action for these agents in early G1, a conclusion compatible with their ability to inhibit PRL binding to these cells. Addition of CsA or DB 2 hr after PRL had no effect on PRL-stimulated ODC activity detectable at 6 hr, but addition of either as late as 6 hr still affected the extent of mitogenesis. This is in line with the requirement for PRL to be present in the culture medium for a minimum of 3 to 6 hr to invoke a maximal effect on mitogenesis. Addition of either cyclopeptide after the cells were in S phase had no effect on the extent of [3H]thymidine incorporation. An inhibitor of the cyclooxygenase pathway (indomethacin) enhanced both PRL-stimulated ODC activity and proliferation, whereas inhibition of the lipoxygenase pathway by NDGA attenuated only proliferation, suggesting that in Nb 2 cells, products of the lipoxygenase pathway may contribute to the mechanism of PRL-stimulated mitogenesis. Because Nb 2 lymphoma cells were derived from estrogenized rats, estrogen was tested as a mitogen. By itself it was not mitogenic, but in conjunction with PRL, estradiol-17 beta elevated the ODC response and inhibited proliferation. Inhibitors of PKC known to have minimal effects on RNA synthesis, quercetin and gossypol, totally inhibited both the elevations of ODC activity and [3H]thymidine incorporation in response to PRL in Nb 2 lymphoma cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

These consisted of a primary phase, characterized by the progressive growth of the organism; a secondary phase, in which the viable organism was progressively eliminated; and a tertiary phase, characterized by a chronic or slowly recrudescing disease state. Passive transfer experiments, in which T cell-enriched spleen cells from immune donors were infused into T cell-deficient recipients and were measured for their capacity to adoptively protect these mice from challenge with M. tuberculosis, provided evidence that at least three separate populations of protective T cells were acquired in response to the infection within the time frame of the experiments. These populations of T cells could be distinguished in that they differed in their expression of the L3T4 and Lyt-2 cell surface molecules, in terms of their kinetic profiles of emergence and loss, and (c) in terms of their susceptibility to cyclophosphamide. The results may suggest that different populations of protective T cells can be generated at different times during the infection as various classes of antigens (for example, metabolic or structural antigens) become available for presentation by host macrophages. It is hypothesized, furthermore, that the kinetics of emergence and loss of these various populations may reflect switching in the mode of immunity being expressed, particularly during the chronic phase of the infection, from that of a state of active immunity to one of immunologic memory.\r"

Gametes and gametocytes contain the target antigens of transmission-blocking immunity. Here, we show that the peripheral blood of nonexposed donors contains Plasmodium falciparum gamete-reactive T cells at frequencies ranging from 1/300 to 1/4000. Studies on long-term clones demonstrated that these cells often recognized antigens shared between gametes and asexual stage parasites or even between heterologous gametes, although it has been possible to derive a P. falciparum gamete-specific T clone. The T clones examined were T3+, T4+, T8-, and either HLA-DR- or HLA-DQ-restricted. They responded to gametes by both proliferation and the secretion of gamma-interferon. The gamete-specific clone and other asexual cross-reactive clones examined could be stimulated in vitro by a preparation of mature gametocytes within RBC, but not by RBC alone, suggesting that gametocytes are immunogenic or can become immunogenic for T cells in vivo. The significance of these observations to mosquito transmission of malaria and development and application of a gamete vaccine are discussed.\r"

The V regions of the light chains (VL) are almost identical with one another, as are the V regions of the heavy chains (VH), which, however, differ by six linked-base substitutions, depending on the strain of mice producing the autoantibodies. Such variations may reflect allelic differences. The VH segments determined have no obvious correspondence to any VH genes identified so far. They may belong to the small VH group 4, where 73% homology, at the most, can be calculated at the protein level for codons 1 to 94. Alternatively, the VH regions may be members of a new group of VH sequences not previously found. The V kappa regions appear closely homologous to members of the V kappa-9 subgroup of myeloma proteins of unknown antigen-binding specificity. The joining segments, J kappa and JH, used by the autoantibodies investigated, originate from the J kappa 2 and JH1 germ-line gene segments, respectively. The nine base-long diversity segments, D, derive from one member of the germ-line D gene SP2 family.\r"

However, the secreted IgE does not bind to PC conjugated to bovine serum albumin (PC-BSA). The MOPC167 kappa chain gene was cloned into the shuttle vector pSV2neo and was transfected into the epsilon heavy-chain transformant. Stable transformants were cloned that expressed both the epsilon heavy chain and the kappa light chain. IgE secreted from such a transformant was shown to bind to PC-BSA. Both types of secreted recombinant IgE bound to rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells, but only the IgE produced by the cell line transformed with the MOPC167 kappa gene could be cross-linked with PC-BSA to cause serotonin release.\r"

  ".W": "The role of IgD in the immune response has remained elusive, although the predominance of IgD on the B cell surface and the paucity of IgD in serum have suggested a receptor function. In support of this hypothesis, it has recently been shown that receptors for IgD on helper T cells can be induced by exposure to IgD in vivo and in vitro. Such IgD receptor-positive T cells (i.e., T delta cells), detectable as RFC using IgD-coated SRBC, augment antibody responses. In this report, we demonstrate that cloned, antigen-specific T cells of helper phenotype show only very low percentages of IgD-RFC, if allowed to rest in vitro after antigen exposure in the absence of IL 2. Exposure to IgD or to IL 2 for 24 hr causes the IgD-specific RFC to increase as much as 25-fold to nearly 80%. Clones that have recently been stimulated with antigen, or T cell hybridomas prepared from such clones, exhibit 40 to 50% IgD-RFC before exposure and twofold higher levels after exposure to IgD. IL 2 also causes a dose-dependent induction of OgD-RFC in normal splenic T cells. Thus, antigen stimulation, IL 2 and IgD can all induce these receptors for IgD which presumably enable helper T cells to interact more effectively with IgD+ B cells.\r"

This potent stimulator activity was found in CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphoblasts activated by mitogen, anti-T3 monoclonal antibody, or mixed leukocyte reactions. Cytotoxic T cells generated in this system were highly specific for HLA class I antigens. Furthermore, T lymphoblasts infected with mumps virus efficiently induced development of autologous CLP into CTL clones that were virus specific and self-HLA restricted, as shown by split-well analysis.

The present studies explored the effects of Leu-Leu-OMe on murine spleen cell function. Leu-Leu-OMe exposure removed NK function from murine spleen cells but spared their capacity to proliferate in response to lipopolysaccharide and Con A. The capacity to generate CTL from both L3T4 (+) and Lyt-2 (+) precursors was lost after Leu-Leu-OMe treatment, whereas alloantigen-induced proliferation and interleukin 2 (IL 2) production by L3T4 (+) T helper cells remained intact. Lethal graft vs host disease (GVHD), which developed in irradiated (C57BL/6 X DBA/2)F1 recipients of C57BL/6 bone marrow and spleen cells was completely prevented by Leu-Leu-OMe treatment of donor cells. In contrast depletion of Lyt-2 positive cells from the donor inoculum did not prevent acute GVHD in this fully major histo-compatibility complex (MHC) incompatible strain combination. However, Leu-Leu-OMe treatment of the Lyt-2 depleted inoculum completely prevented lethal GVHD, although the treated cells retained the capacity to proliferate and secrete IL 2 normally after in vitro stimulation with (C57BL/6 X DFA/2)F1 spleen cells. These findings indicate that L3T4 (+) T helper cells alone are unable to initiate lethal GVHD in this H-2 incompatible strain combination. Rather, lethal GVHD requires the transfer of a Leu-Leu-OMe sensitive T cell subset, likely to be thymus educated pre-CTL. Leu-Leu-OMe treatment should provide a useful way to delineate subpopulations of cells involved in the production of lethal GVHD and an approach to preventing this complication of bone marrow transplantation.\r"

  ".U": "87059064\r", 
  ".W": "T-cell activating protein, TAP, is a Ly-6 encoded 12,000 dalton glycoprotein involved in the activation of murine T cells. TAP is distinct from other known surface activating structures, such as the T cell receptor/T3 complex and Thy-1. This study investigates the mechanism of activation via the TAP molecule. Soluble alpha TAP monoclonal antibody (MAb) is sufficient for T cell activation. This, however, requires cross-linking because F(ab) monovalent antibody is not stimulatory unless cross-linked by a second antibody. Immediately after cross-linking, there is a rapid influx of calcium, which is comparable with concanavalin A or T cell receptor triggered responses. Subsequently, interleukin 2 (IL 2) is produced, and IL 2 receptors (IL 2R) are expressed. TAP-stimulated T cell proliferation is driven by this autocrine pathway because it is inhibited by alpha IL 2R MAb. Thus TAP-mediated activation appears to share a common final pathway with other mitogenic stimuli. A nonactivating alpha TAP MAb was observed to stimulate T cells upon additional cross-linking. Given this observation, we asked whether other Ly-6 linked proteins might share similar activating potential. We show that at least three distinct Ly-6 linked molecules are capable of stimulating T hybrid clones and/or heterogeneous T lymphocytes. Thus it appears that the Ly-6 locus encodes a family of activating cell surface molecules.\r"

Here the function of the CD22 antigen was evaluated by using the mAb HD6, directed against one of the epitopes on the molecule. The HD6 antibody was constimulatory with anti-Ig in inducing small, dense tonsillar cells to proliferate; however, the antibody by itself was devoid of stimulatory activity. Anti-CD22 antibody also induced more anti-Ig-treated B cells to leave G0 and enter the G1 phase of the cell cycle. It also was constimulatory with low-m.w. BCGF and with an antibody to a 50-Kd polypeptide, Bp50, which mediates a BCGF-like activity. Results of kinetic experiments and analysis of different B cell fractions suggested that anti-CD22 acts during an early phase of B cell activation, probably by amplifying the anti-Ig signal. F(ab')2 fragments of anti-CD22 HD6 were as effective as the whole antibody in inducing augmentation of B cell proliferation, showing that the Fc portion of the molecule was not required for the activity. The results of these experiments, together with the intriguing distribution of the Bp 130/140 antigen in B cell ontogeny, suggest that this molecule plays an important role in the process that leads to B cell activation and proliferation.\r"

In order to determine whether Leu-3+8+ and/or Leu-3+8- T cells are present in cell-mediated immune reactions in vivo, we studied the immunohistology of allergic contact dermatitis in 8 biopsies from 8 patients with positive patch tests and 3 biopsies from 2 patients with Rhus dermatitis. Both Leu-3+8+ and Leu-3+8- T cells were present in each biopsy. Only 1 case had a definite minority of the Leu-3+8+ subset. These results suggest that, analogous to in vitro systems, both Leu-8+ and Leu-8- subsets of Leu-3+ T cells are involved in cell-mediated immunity in vivo. HLA-DR+ keratinocytes were present in only 3 of 11 biopsies at days 3-7. No HLA-DQ+ keratinocytes were identified. We also confirmed prior findings that Leu-3+ cells are the predominant T-cell population, Langerhans cells are increased, and B cells and NK cells are rare. Furthermore, Tac and Ki-67 expression by T cells and Leu-3 expression by Langerhans cells tended to increase over time.\r"

  ".W": "An essential prerequisite for the in situ enumeration of epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs) is the unequivocal identification of the desired cell type. We have examined over 250 cryostat sections of normal human skin to analyze morphologic and methodologic problems underlying the quantification of epidermal LCs, defined by anti-T6 (OKT6) and anti-HLA-DR (OKIal) immunoperoxidase staining. Our findings show that OKT6 reactivity of dendritic processes in cross-sectioned epidermis yields microscopic images which are not easy to analyze objectively. The morphology that we find leads us to categorize dendritic cells into 3 arbitrary types of T6+ LC profiles. In addition we describe criteria for the assessment of OKT6 staining patterns relating to the dendritic state of epidermal LCs. Preliminary quantitative data on this issue are discussed in relation to: epidermal thickness; the thickness of skin tissue sections; and the discrepancy between the number of T6+ and HLA-DR+ LCs. We hope that the principles outlined in this report may serve to overcome potential methodologic problems with quantitation of T6+ epidermal LCs in skin sections.\r"

Preventing phagosomal acidification may be a mechanism by which this organism survives the microbicidal activity of macrophages. Fluorescein isothiocyanate was conjugated to the surface of Nocardia and Saccharomyces to form pH-sensitive fluorescent probes. The fluorescent emission, and thus the pH, of this probe was quantitated within individual phagosomes by using a computerized cytospectrophotometer. When either live or dead cells of virulent N. asteroides strain GUH-2 were ingested, the phagosomal pH remained above pH 7 for 2 hr. A nonpathogenic soil isolate, N. asteroides strain 19247, only partially blocked acidification. In contrast, when Saccharomyces was used as a control for normal response, the pH decreased to approximately pH 5. Therefore, virulent N. asteroides blocks phagosomal acidification. Because killed Nocardia act in the same manner, this inhibition of acidification appears to be associated with cellular components. This capacity to prevent phagosomal acidification may be prerequisite to the survival of intracellular pathogens.\r"

Mouse embryos fertilized in vivo were collected and cultured in Hepes medium with and without bicarbonate (HCO3-) and a phosphate medium with and without HCO3-. In these experiments no CO2 gas phase was used. Further embryos were cultured in Whittingham's modified Tyrode's (T6) medium with a CO2 gas phase and served as controls. The degree of embryonic development was noted. Surviving blastocysts were transferred to the uteri of pseudopregnant mice and delivery at term was allowed to occur. There was no significant difference in the degree of embryonic development in those embryos cultured in T6 or Hepes medium (+ HCO3-) or in the number of live offspring obtained when these blastocysts were placed within the mouse uterus. Although embryonic development apparently proceeded successfully in the phosphate (+ HCO3-) medium, none of these blastocysts survived when transferred to mouse uteri. No embryonic growth occurred in either the Hepes or phosphate media which were devoid of HCO3-. It appears that a Hepes medium containing HCO3-, which uses no CO2 gas phase, is as effective as T6 medium, which uses a gas phase, in supporting in vitro mouse embryonic growth.\r"

Furthermore, the effect of oocyte aging in vivo on the subsequent rate of fertilization in vitro was also investigated. The oocytes were collected at 12, 18, and 24 hr after hCG injection and in vitro fertilization (IVF) was carried out in T6 medium. A higher proportion of animals responded to hMG stimulation (32/70) compared to pure FSH (15/66). Furthermore, hMG gave a higher oocyte recovery (454/32) than pure FSH (77/15). Fertilization rates of 57.8, 51.5, and 53.5% were obtained for the 12-, 18-, and 24-hr groups, respectively, after correction for parthenogenetic division of oocytes in the controls. No significant differences in fertilization rates were observed among the three time intervals used in recovering oocytes. However, as the degeneration and parthenogenetic division increased with the delay in collection of oocytes, 12 hr post-hCG injection was the best time to collect oocytes to obtain optimum results in in vitro fertilization.\r"

Phagocytic leukocytes from either humans or guinea pigs produced activator hydroperoxides in quantities sufficient to enhance prostaglandin synthesis in cells. Compounds that stimulated the oxidative burst (e.g., phorbol myristate acetate, opsonized zymosan, and N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine) enhanced the overall production of the activators. Accumulation of activator(s) was promoted by exogenous Fe+3 (2 mumol/L), adenosine diphosphate (10 mumol/L), and unsaturated fatty acids (1 to 30 mumol/L) and was completely inhibited by glutathione peroxidase (0.5 U/ml). Catalase (500 U/ml) decreased the amount of activator by 70% when added during the incubation but by only 40% when added after the incubation. Thus, the activator appeared to be partly H2O2 and partly a lipid hydroperoxide. The addition of H2O2 in quantities similar to those produced by phagocytes increased prostaglandin formation by twofold in incubations with U937 cells and carbon 14-labeled arachidonic acid (2 mumol/L). These results indicate a new role for the oxygen metabolites from leukocytes in providing an intercellular signal that can stimulate prostaglandin synthesis.\r"

Vesicles were prepared from 14-day-old control, 14-day-old methylprednisolone-treated, and untreated 21-day-old rats. Methylprednisolone treatment resulted in a significant stimulation of taurocholate uptake by an inwardly directed Na+ gradient when compared with a choline gradient incubation. These differences occurred at 20 seconds and 1, 2, and 5 minutes of incubation (P less than 0.05). In 14-day-old controls, uptake was similar for Na+ and choline gradients. A plot of active uptake velocity vs. taurocholate concentration (0.1 to 1.0 mmol/L) in 14-day-old controls was linear and approached the abscissa, indicating the absence of active transport. Plots for methylprednisolone-treated rats showed saturability. An inwardly directed Na+ gradient stimulated initial taurocholate uptake rates by twofold at 37 degrees C (P less than 0.01), but not at 4 degrees C. Glycocholate and glycodeoxycholate inhibited Na+-stimulated taurocholate uptake by 50% (P less than 0.01) and 20% (P less than 0.05), respectively. These data indicate that pharmacologic doses of methylprednisolone accelerate the postnatal acquisition of Na+-dependent taurocholate cotransport in rat ileal brush border membranes.\r"

  ".W": "Using a granular enteric-coated aspirin (ECA) preparation, we achieved continuous release of low-dose aspirin and associated inhibition of platelet reactivity. The lowest once-daily dose that produced greater than 90% inhibition of serum thromboxane (TX) A2 after 7 days was 80 mg. The time course of inhibition after the first dose indicated a gradual release of aspirin over a period of 8 hours. We subsequently fractionated this 80 mg dose into three times daily doses of 27 mg that were administered to nine healthy men for 7 days. This regimen resulted in 96% inhibition of serum TXA2 generation (P less than 0.001), inhibition of in vitro platelet aggregation (P less than 0.05), prolongation of the bleeding time by 75% (P less than 0.01), and a threefold increase in inhibition of platelet aggregation by prostacyclin (P less than 0.01) compared with pre-ECA values. In contrast to our previous study using daily 80 mg doses of ECA, after the 27 mg three times daily regimen we found a significant increase in circulating platelet cyclooxygenase activity 24 hours after the final dose (P less than 0.05). This immediate recovery indicates active megakaryocyte cyclooxygenase and suggests that acetylation of platelet cyclooxygenase was restricted to the presystemic circulation. We conclude that long-term dosing with 27 mg ECA three times daily results in profound inhibition of platelet TXA2 production, and diminished in vitro and in vivo platelet reactivity. This regimen provides a practical approach to achieving continuous release of low-dose aspirin and possible presystemic acetylation of platelet cyclooxygenase.\r"

Correlation coefficients were all greater than 0.999, and probable errors were less than 0.43 vol% for the gases and less than 0.03 vol% for the volatile anesthetics. Response time was 67 ms with a sample flow rate of 150 ml/min. There was some signal overlap between nitrogen and nitrous oxide and between the volatile anesthetic agents. Such overlap can be compensated for by linear matrix analysis. The Raman instrument promises a monitoring capability equivalent to the mass spectrometer and should prove attractive for the monitoring of respiratory and anesthetic gases in the operating room.\r"

Mixed venous oxygen saturation less than 65% was clinically unacceptable in patients with sepsis and was associated with a poor prognosis. In this study, measurement of mixed venous oxygen saturation was a valuable predictor of survival in patients with septic shock and provided a means of continuously monitoring the status of tissue oxygenation.\r"

Not all monitoring is bad, however. Oxygen, temperature, blood pressure, and the electrocardiogram should be monitored, but we must avoid a lavish concept that monitoring will solve all our problems and eliminate the need for proper personal attention.

Pooling the data from all 20 animals, preocclusion CBF was 46.4 +/- 3.6 ml/100 gm/min and intracellular brain pH was 7.01 +/- 0.04 (means +/- standard error of the means). Although mannitol administration mildly improved CBF in regions of severe ischemia, this increase was not sufficient to prevent metabolic deterioration as assessed by brain pH. However, in regions of moderate ischemia, CBF improved significantly with mannitol and the gradual decline in brain pH observed in control animals was prevented. For example, in the treated moderate ischemia sites 4-hour postocclusion CBF and pH values were 31.8 ml/100 gm/min and 6.89 +/- 0.09, respectively, as compared to control values of 14.3 ml/100 gm/min and 6.75 +/- 0.06. These results suggest that mannitol may be of benefit in stabilizing regions of moderate, but not severe, ischemia after vessel occlusion.\r"

  ".W": "Eleven cases of supratentorial neuroepithelial tumor presenting in infancy are reported. The tumors were characterized by their voluminous size, their intense desmoplasia, and the frequent presence of divergent astrocytic and ganglionic differentiation as demonstrated by special neurohistological and immunohisto- and immunocytochemical techniques. All the tumors presented in subjects below the age of 18 months, usually within the first 4 months of life. They most often involved the frontal and parietal regions and were composed predominantly of a dense desmoplastic tissue superficially resembling a moderately cellular fibroma. The fibroblastic elements were admixed with variable numbers of pleomorphic neuroepithelial cells. Divergent astrocytic and neuronal differentiation was demonstrable in nine of the 11 tumors. All showed astrocytic differentiation. The study of one example by electron microscopy, immunocytochemistry, and tissue culture disclosed that the astrocytic tumor cells were partly invested by a pericytoplasmic basal lamina. Successful total or near-total surgical resection has been followed by a favorable postoperative course extending in some cases over many years of tumor-free survival. The name \"desmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma\" is proposed for this apparently distinct clinicopathological entity, whose massive size is indicative of a pre- or perinatal origin. Its identification can be achieved by careful histological analysis and is of obvious prognostic significance.\r"

Sodium balance and plasma concentration of ANP were measured at weekly intervals for 5 weeks. At 1 week of age the study was started by dividing infants into two groups, group 1 with low and group 2 with increased sodium intake. Mean plasma concentrations of ANP were 47.7 +/- 7.6 and 51.4 +/- 9.5 fmol/ml, respectively. A steady decrease in plasma ANP concentration to 18.8 +/- 2.9 fmol/ml was observed in infants with sodium intake 1.5 mmol/kg/d (group 1), which was related to the decrease in serum sodium concentration in this group. In contrast, supplementation with NaCl 4.6 mmol/kg/d (group 2) was associated with a 30% increase in plasma ANP concentration, significantly different (P less than 0.025) from that in infants not given supplement, and was also higher than the values in full-term neonates. Our data suggest that altered sodium homeostasis induces regulatory changes in plasma ANP levels. ANP may provide a sensitive and important hormonal system for the control of sodium balance, even in premature neonates.\r"

Under standardized, steady-state conditions, 0.5 g/kg fat emulsion (intralipid) was administered intravenously over 2 hours both before and after infants received 7 days of continuous nasogastric or gastric tube L-carnitine (50 mumol/kg/day) or placebo. Plasma triglyceride, free fatty acid, acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and carnitine concentrations were observed at 0 (start of lipid infusion), 2, and 4 hours for pre- and post-treatment periods, and in addition at 6 and 8 hours after carnitine supplementation. Infants receiving carnitine had significantly greater beta-hydroxybutyrate plasma concentrations (P less than 0.05) and carnitine (P less than 0.001) at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours, and greater plasma acetoacetate concentrations (P less than 0.05) at 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours, compared with controls. Twenty-four-hour urinary carnitine excretion was very low for both groups before supplementation; after supplementation, excretion was higher (P less than 0.05) in the carnitine group. No significant differences were found between groups for plasma triglyceride or free fatty acid concentrations at any observation period. This study demonstrated enhanced fatty acid oxidation, as evidenced by increased ketogenesis, with L-carnitine supplementation in infants receiving long-term total parenteral nutrition.\r"

We investigated the pathophysiology underlying defective bone mineralization in two individuals and examined the effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D, calcitriol) therapy on the clinical and biochemical abnormalities. Both patients had fasting hypophosphatemia, markedly diminished TmP/GFR, and elevated alkaline phosphase activity in the presence of normocalcemia. Before treatment with calcitriol, serum 1,25(OH)2D concentrations were reduced but serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations were normal. Administration of calcitriol increased serum 1,25(OH)2D concentrations and led to an increase in TmP/GFR and serum phosphorus levels and to a decrease in alkaline phosphatase activity. However, the renal tubular maximum for reabsorption of inorganic phosphate, normalized according to glomerular filtration rate, and serum phosphorus levels remained abnormally low even in the patient who also received phosphate supplementation. Bone histomorphologic studies in the adult patient showed extreme osteomalacia, which partially improved with calcitriol. These data demonstrate that the putative skin lesion-derived factor results in both a renal tubular defect in phosphate reabsorption and in 1,25-(OH)2 D deficiency. The vitamin D-resistant rickets of linear sebaceous nevus syndrome is a variant of tumor-induced osteomalacia.\r"

  ".W": "Reliable enzymatic endothelial cell (EC) harvest methods are required for clinical EC seeding of vascular prostheses by methods analogous to those demonstrated in dogs. But crude collagenases used for EC harvest vary in efficacy and cytotoxicity, and purified collagenases reportedly give low EC yields. To compare different harvest methods, we studied growth curves of primary adult human saphenous vein EC (HSVEC) harvests plated in replicate microwell cultures. The EC yield, defined as attachment-capable ECs obtained per square centimeter of vein lumen, was estimated from the lowest number of ECs counted in lag phase before exponential growth began. With the use of morphometric studies of HSVs that were perfusion-fixed at their original dimensions, the baseline in situ density of ECs available for harvest from HSV was estimated at 1.3 X 10(5) EC/cm2. Crude (CBC) and partially purified bacterial collagenase (PBC) solutions at concentrations with equal levels of basement membrane lysis activity (BMLA) were compared by the replicate microwell method in a series of 21 harvests (six CBC, eight PBC, and seven enzyme-free control harvests). All 14 enzymatic harvests produced confluent EC cultures with no significant difference in mean harvest efficiency between CBC (12% of in situ EC number) and PBC (15%). However, PBC caused less degradation of human fibronectin (p less than 0.0001) as measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay employing a fibronectin-specific monoclonal antibody. These data suggest that chemically defined mixtures of pure enzymes with BMLA equal to the BMLA of crude collagenase might allow reliable EC harvesting without sacrifice in EC yield but with improved preservation of structures at the EC periphery. EC losses during initial vein dissection may have contributed to the low 12% to 15% efficiency we observed.\r"

Psychological testing and psychiatric evaluation revealed a variety of psychiatric conditions; depression was common. In two patients surreptitious insulin administration was believed to represent suicidal behavior. In others, it appeared to represent symptom substitution when use of other health-threatening behaviors such as recurrent ketoacidosis was made increasingly difficult through appropriate intervention.

We postulated that prostaglandin release in response to 5HT acted as a confusing variable, and tested the hypothesis by comparing infusions of serotonin and angiotensin into one renal artery of 14 anesthetized dogs before and after indomethacin administration. Renal blood flow (Q, by EM flow-meter) responses to 5HT were routinely biphasic, an initial sharp decrease followed by a gradual increase which stabilized well above baseline at three to six minutes. Indomethacin, 1 to 2 mg/kg, did not alter the acute Q decrement induced by 5HT but abolished the increase in Q at three to six minutes (P less than 0.001). Instead, sustained vasoconstriction became apparent. Ketanserin reversed the sustained vasoconstrictor effect of 5HT in indomethacin-treated dogs, leading to striking, serotonin-induced vasodilatation. The latter vasodilatation in turn was inhibited by methysergide. Four independent elements, two promoting vasoconstriction and two vasodilatation, are suggested. One vasodilator response is abolished by prostaglandin synthetase inhibition and the other by methysergide, a complex 5HT receptor blocker. The sustained vasoconstrictor response is blocked by ketanserin, suggesting an action on the 5HT-2 receptor. The initial, transient vasoconstrictor response is resistant to the blockers employed. These complex interactions may account for the variability in reported responses of the renal blood supply to serotonin.\r"

Recently, a derivative, the methylester aspartate salt of Amphotericin B (AME) has been synthesized, which is highly water soluble in the absence of organic solvents. We have tested the action of AM, DOC, and AME on the sodium permeability of brush border (BBM) vesicles isolated from rat kidney cortex. It was found that both AM and AME increased the 22Na uptake as measured by a rapid filtration technique. However, a large fraction of the AM action was due to the effect of DOC on the BBM sodium permeability. We also investigated the time- and dose-dependent action of AME on 22Na and 3H-D-mannitol efflux from BBM vesicles. After 15 sec of exposure, efflux from 22Na-preloaded vesicles was unchanged in the presence of 1 microgram AME/mg protein compared to control vesicles. With 10, 50, and 100 micrograms AME/mg protein, the efflux increased 16, 25, and 35% respectively; 260 micrograms AME/mg protein did not elicit a further increment in the 22Na efflux. In the same membrane vesicles 3H-D-mannitol efflux did not change. After preincubation of the membranes for 60 min with different concentrations of AME, the 15 sec 22Na efflux increased 26% in the presence of 1 microgram/mg protein AME with no change in the 3H-D-mannitol efflux.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "These experiments in isolated mouse cortical thick ascending limbs (cTALH) provide information about: the relative contributions of cellular and paracellular pathways to the transepithelial electrical conductance Ge (mS cm-2); the effects of (CO2 + HCO3-) on Ge; the ratio of net K+ secretion (JKnet) to net Cl- absorption (JClnet); and the K+ requirement for apical membrane furosemide-sensitive NaCl entry. The combination of luminal Ba++, zero K+ reduced Ge; at 5 mM luminal Ba++, the residual conductance was about 75% of the control Ge. The Ba++-insensitive Ge of 73.1 +/- 6.4 mS cm-2 was only slightly greater than the shunt conductance of 57 mS cm-2 computed from the sum of the dissipative bath to lumen fluxes of 22Na+ and 36Cl-. Moreover, luminal 5 mM Ba++, zero K+ had no effect on the Na+/Cl- permselectivity ratio of the paracellular pathway. Thus, Ba++ blockaded transcellular conductance by blocking apical membrane K+ channels. The combination of (CO2 + HCO3-) in external solutions increased Ge solely by augmenting the Ba++-sensitive, that is, transcellular, component of Ge. Finally, in paired experiments, the ratio JKnet/JClnet was 0.27 +/- 0.05; and both Ve, the spontaneous transepithelial voltage (mV), and the equivalent short circuit current Je (pEq sec-1 cm-2) were reduced dramatically by luminal K+ omission. Thus, apical membranes of the cTALH appear to contain a pathway for net K+ secretion, and apical membrane NaCl entry may involve co-transport with K+. Transcellular conductance contributes at least 25% to the total Ge, and the combination (CO2 + HCO3-) augments transcellular conductance.\r"

The study group consisted mainly of children. Before therapy a total of 113 lesions were detected in the lower urinary tract. These consisted of bladder wall enlargements (N = 53), enlargements of the bladder wall in combination with singular (N = 16) or multiple polyps (N = 30), vesical calcifications (N = 10), and cases with cystitis cystica (N = 4). One year after therapy, a drastic reduction of ova output was observed, and only eight pathological abnormalities of the lower urinary tract were still detectable. Vesical calcifications persisted in four out of ten cases. Urinary tract obstructions of different degrees (N = 42) showed a comparably marked reversibility. It was concluded that, in children, the resolution of bladder lesions induced by urinary schistosomiasis resulted in reversibility of urinary tract obstructions one year after treatment with Praziquantel.\r"

The glomerular fibrinolytic activity (GFA) was detectable after 15 minutes of incubation. Then it increased with time, the glomerular protein concentration, and with the plasminogen concentration (P less than 0.001 for all). CaCl2 (1 mM) increased the GFA (9.7 +/- 0.9 versus 4.9 +/- 0.4 micrograms fibrin/mg/30 min, P less than 0.05). The GFA was also enhanced when pH increased. Arachidonic acid (AA, 1 to 20 micrograms/ml) increased the GFA in a saturable manner. Inhibitors of cyclooxygenase (aspirin) or of lipoxygenase (nordihydroguaiaretic acid) did not modify the basal and AA-stimulated GFA. Other polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), eicosatrienoic acid (ETA), eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA), or dihomo-gamma-linoleic acid (DHL), also stimulated the GFA whereas linoleic acid and oleic acid did not. Polyunsaturated fatty acids also stimulated the fibrinolytic activity of glomerular supernatants. Specific antibodies to t-PA, and to a lesser extent to u-PA, decreased this fibrinolytic activity whether or not AA was added. Furthermore, AA and EPA were found to increase the activity of purified u-PA and t-PA. We conclude that human glomeruli release both t-PA and u-PA, and that this release is increased by calcium and alkaline pH. The polyunsaturated fatty acids enhanced the GFA, mainly by a stimulatory effect of PA activity rather than an increased release of PA from glomerular cells.\r"

  ".W": "Endogenous digitalis-like factors have been implicated in the adaptations that accompany renal insufficiency and in the pathogenesis of hypertension. We recently described several fractions of normal human plasma that inhibit NaK-ATPase and exhibit apparent digoxin-like immunoreactivity. To determine if hypertension and/or renal insufficiency affect plasma levels of these factors, we examined four patient groups: normotensive controls; hypertensive subjects with normal renal function; hypertensives with moderate renal insufficiency; and chronic dialysis patients. Plasma levels of digoxin-like immunoreactivity and NaK-ATPase inhibitory activity were significantly increased in hypertensive patients with mild renal failure (7.6 +/- 1.1 ouabain equivalents, mean +/- SEM, N = 21 vs 4.1 +/- 1.1 in normotensive controls, N = 20, P less than 0.05). NaK-ATPase inhibitory activity tended to be higher in patients with primary hypertension and normal renal function (5.5 +/- 0.7 ouabain equivalents, P less than 0.07); in dialysis patients, it was not different from controls. There was no correlation between NaK-ATPase inhibitory activity and blood pressure in any group. There was a significant rise in plasma NaK-ATPase inhibitory activity during dialysis (+ 1.8 +/- 0.7 ouabain equivalents, N = 22, P less than 0.03). As we have found that NaK-ATPase inhibitory activity in the plasma of normal humans can be separated into three distinct fractions, EI1, EI2, and EI3, we analyzed the plasma of 10 dialysis patients further. The increase in NaK-ATPase inhibitory activity could be attributed to fractions EI1 and EI3. These results suggest that plasma NaK-ATPase inhibitors increase with chronic renal insufficiency, but not hypertension alone. Although hemodialysis may acutely raise plasma levels, long-term dialysis returns them to the normal range.\r"

Either underlying lung disease or immunologic risk factors were present in 49 patients (92%). Twenty-one patients (31%) had simple aspergilloma and 32 (47%) had complex aspergilloma. The most common indication for operation was an indeterminate mass, hemoptysis, or severe cough. Lobectomy, wedge excision, and pneumonectomy were the most frequent operations. Complications occurred in 78% of patients with complex aspergilloma and in 33% of patients with simple aspergilloma (p = 0.002). Operative mortality was 5% (one death) in patients with simple aspergilloma and 34% (11 deaths) in patients with complex aspergilloma (p = 0.01). Cause of death was respiratory failure in four patients, underlying pulmonary disease in three, aspergillosis in two, and other conditions in three. At follow-up, 84% of operative survivors with simple aspergilloma were alive and well compared with 43% of those with complex aspergilloma. Although operative mortality in patients with complex aspergilloma was high, 67% of the survivors had a good long-term result in terms of absence of symptoms, but they frequently died of underlying disease. In contrast, operation in patients with simple aspergilloma was done with low risk, and approximately 90% of survivors had a good late result. Late appearance of contralateral disease did occur and argues for rigorous postoperative surveillance.\r"

Patients received in random order placebo or Ileu-ANP infusions (5 micrograms/min) for 4 h on 2 separate occasions, at least 1 week apart. Compared with placebo, Ileu-ANP caused significant reductions in mean systemic arterial pressure, mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary diastolic pressure, and right atrial pressure. These changes were sustained for at least 2 h after infusion. Cardiac output increased from 6.2 to 7.4 l/min at 60 min, then returned to pre-infusion levels. Despite considerable falls in systemic pressure there was no significant increase in heart rate or plasma noradrenaline. With Ileu-ANP infusion, plasma renin activity, angiotensin, arginine vasopressin, aldosterone, and cortisol values were not significantly different from placebo values. Plasma cortisol and aldosterone increased after stopping Ileu-ANP. Neither urine volume nor sodium excretion rate was significantly increased by Ileu-ANP.\r"

This technique was well-accepted by surgeons during the clinical trials. Because the 3.0 mm outside diameter was significantly smaller than the smallest flexible, uncuffed metal endotracheal tube currently available (6.9 mm), the rigid structure facilitated atraumatic insertion past the surgical lesion. Both the use of this device and the required anesthetic technique are described in three CO2 laser ablative procedures.

  ".W": "Because fatigable, white (FF) muscle fibers have been reported to have a greater glycolytic capacity and a lower oxidative capacity than fatigue-resistant, red (FR and SR) muscle fibers, it is generally supposed that FF muscle fibers produce and therefore release more lactic acid into the blood during contractions than FR and SR muscle fibers. To test this supposition, the net lactic acid output, L, and O2 uptake, VO2, were measured for the cat gastrocnemius-plantaris muscle during repetitive isometric contractions. The results obtained from this low metabolic capacity (FF, FR and SR muscles) were compared to results obtained previously in the high metabolic capacity (FR and SR muscles) of the same muscle group in the dog during similar contractions. Preliminary studies established that 1 twitch X 2 s-1 provided a similar VO2 pattern during the contractions of cat muscle as 4 twitches X s-1 produced in the dog muscle. The decline in VO2 over a 30-min period of contractions was 12 to 18%, as developed tension declined with fatigue. Thus, the contractions of the cat muscles were matched with the dog muscles in terms of the relative aerobic capacity and development of fatigue. During the 1 twitch X 2 s-1 twitches, the VO2 reached 24.4 +/- 1.41 (SE) microliter X g-1 X min-1 at 10 min of contractions. The VO2 declined to 21.3 +/- 2.3 microliter X g-1 X min-1 by 30 min. The VO2 and tension developed changed parallel to each other. The net L reached 0.21 +/- 0.06 mumol X g-1 X min-1 at 10 min and fell to 0.13 +/- 0.05 mumol X g-1 X min by 30 min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Heart rate, arterial blood pressure, minute ventilation (VE), breathing rate (fb), oxygen uptake (VO2), and carbon dioxide output (VCO2) were measured before, during, and for 4 min after the exercise. Tidal volume was calculated from VE X fb-1. The exercise duration was also measured. Forced expiratory volume (FEV1) was measured: before smoking (rest); before exercise (10 min after smoking); and after exercise. Carboxyhemoglobin levels were measured before and 10 min after smoking in four subjects. Marihuana smoking reduced exercise duration (16.1 +/- 4.0 to 15.1 +/- 3.3 min, P less than 0.05). At peak exercise performance, there were no differences in VO2, VCO2, heart rate, and VE between the two experimental conditions. Marihuana induced tachycardia at preexercise (94.3 +/- 13.3 beats X min-1 to 119.0 +/- 18.0, P less than 0.01) that was sustained up to 80% of maximum effort and during the recovery period. After marihuana, VE, VO2 and VCO2 were increased above control from 50% of maximum effort to the end of the test. Marihuana induced a bronchodilation (FEV1 from 4.28 +/- 1.00 to 4.43 +/- 1.031, P less than 0.0) that was still present after exercise. Exercise induced a bronchodilation in the control condition but not in the marihuana smoking condition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Cutaneous biopsy specimens from 22 patients showed the distinctive histopathologic pattern of necrobiotic xanthogranuloma within the dermis or subcutaneous tissue (or both). Twenty of the 22 patients had 1 or more serum protein abnormalities, consisting of an IgG monoclonal protein in 16, multiple myeloma in 3, cryoglobulinemia in 3, and an abnormal serum protein electrophoresis in 1. Cutaneous lesions were seen as discrete, slowly developing red nodules and plaques with a xanthomatized hue and a predilection for the face (periorbital region in particular), trunk, and extremities. Ulceration was a notable finding in 10 patients. Histologically, the dermis and lobules of subcutaneous tissue were involved with a granulomatous infiltrate containing bands of hyaline necrobiosis and bizarre foreign body, as well as Touton giant cells. Cholesterol clefts, lymphoid nodules with or without germinal centers, and foci of plasma cells were variable but significant features. Leukocyte monoclonal antibody studies in 6 patients demonstrated helper T cells within the granulomas. Electron microscopy in 3 cases showed lipid vacuoles in macrophages in the dermis and dendritic cells in the epidermis, and study confirmed this entity as a non-X histiocytosis. Pertinent laboratory findings, in addition to the serum protein abnormalities, included elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, leukopenia with absolute neutropenia, and decreased serum complement levels, as well as decreased levels of C1-esterase inhibitor in some patients. Thirteen of the 22 patients have survived, the mean duration being 9.5 years after the onset of cutaneous disease. While given to only a few patients in the current series, low-dose chemotherapy seems to induce a favorable response in both the cutaneous and the hematologic disease.\r"

Although maximum blood glucoses ranged from 322 to 1160 mg/dl with a median of 579 mg/dl, only 1 of 24 diabetic patients developed ketoacidosis. This patient developed diabetes 12 years prior to the diagnosis of CF and may have had type 1 diabetes. In contrast, hypoglycemia was frequent and 4 patients were hospitalized with serious neurologic manifestations. Two patients were found to have diabetic retinopathy, 1 with macular edema required laser photocoagulation to improve vision, and the other had multiple microaneurysms. CF-associated diabetes did not influence the deterioration of clinical scores, chest x-ray scores, pulmonary function tests, the number of hospital admissions, the type of organisms found in the sputum, or mortality rates. The development of diabetes in our CF patients was not related to the severity of pulmonary dysfunction, clinical, or chest x-ray scores. Thus, although the development of diabetes is an additional encumbrance upon the already therapeutically burdened existence of a CF patient, it does not appear to affect the course of the disease. Despite the demonstration of diabetic retinopathy in this study, most patients with CF-associated diabetes still do not live long enough to develop microvascular complications from the diabetes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Exogenous reinfection is considered relatively unimportant in the United States and other developed countries. Of 49 shelter-related cases, 22 had cultures resistant to both isoniazid and streptomycin and of the same phage type, indicating recent transmission originating with a single index patient. The probable index patient had a 10-year history of isoniazid and streptomycin resistance--an uncommon pattern at the shelter during the three years preceding the outbreak. In 4 of the 22 cases, the patient had previously had documented tuberculosis infection or disease. These reinfected patients had extensive lung cavitation and numerous acid-fast bacilli on sputum smears--features associated with contagiousness. In contrast, patients with tuberculosis for the first time (primary tuberculosis) are usually less contagious. We conclude that exogenous reinfection may have been an important factor leading to highly contagious secondary cases and an acceleration of the usual pattern of tuberculosis transmission in this highly susceptible population.\r"

In 8 of the 10 patients, elevated serum aminotransferase levels decreased rapidly during therapy and eventually fell into the normal or nearly normal range. In two of these patients, the interferon therapy was stopped after four months, and in both cases, a prompt return of aminotransferase activities to pretreatment values occurred. Prolonged treatment was associated with a sustained improvement in aminotransferase levels; in three cases, biopsy specimens obtained after one year of therapy showed marked improvement in hepatic histology, even though low doses of alpha interferon had been used. These preliminary findings, although not adequately controlled, suggest that long-term, low-dose alpha interferon therapy may be effective in controlling the disease activity in some patients with chronic non-A,non-B hepatitis. A prospective controlled trial is now needed to assess the role of interferon therapy in this disease.\r"

We have cloned and sequenced the t(8; 14) breakpoints of an African Burkitt's lymphoma cell line, P3HR-1, and a pre-B cell ALL cell line, 380. In each case the region of chromosome 8 involved has recombined with a JH region on chromosome 14. The two sites of breakage on chromosome 8 lie within 70 base pairs (bp) of one another. At each joining site, sequences homologous to the signal sequences thought to be recognized by the V-D-J recombinase were identified, as were N regions. In B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemias (B-CLL) carrying the t(11; 14) chromosome translocation and in follicular lymphomas carrying the t(14; 18) translocation, the V-D-J recombinase is implicated in the mechanism of chromosomal translocations. We speculate that the same enzymatic mechanism is responsible for the t(8; 14) translocations in African Burkitt's lymphoma and pre-B cell ALL.\r"

  ".W": "T lymphocytes require a foreign antigen to be presented on a cell surface in association with a self-transplantation antigen before they can recognize it effectively. This phenomenon is known as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restriction. It is not clear how an incalculably large number of foreign proteins form unique complexes with a very limited number of MHC molecules. We studied the recognition properties of T cells specific for a peptide derived from bacteriophage lambda cI protein. Analogues of this peptide, as well as peptides derived from other unrelated antigens which can be presented in the context of the same MHC molecule, can competitively inhibit activation of these T cells by the cI peptide. Furthermore, these unrelated antigens can stimulate cI-specific T cells if certain specific amino-acid residues are replaced. Here we suggest a model in which all antigens give rise to peptides that can bind to the same site on the MHC molecule. T-cell recognition of this site (which is presumed to be polymorphic) with or without antigen bound can explain self-selection in the thymus and MHC restriction.\r"

Both Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space contribute to the rise in [Ca2+]i. In an attempt to assess the relative importance of these pools and the sequences leading to the rise in [Ca2+]i, we have studied the time course of changes in [Ca2+]i after stimulation with N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) or platelet-activating factor (PAF) using the Ca2+ indicators quin-2 and fura-2. We observed a time lag of 1-3 s between stimulation and rise in [Ca2+]i. This lag depends on the agonist concentration but is independent of extracellular Ca2+. Thus Ca2+ release from intracellular stores is rate limiting for the rise in [Ca2+]i. After this, cation channels in the plasma membrane (measured with the patch clamp method) are opened. These non-selective channels, which also pass Ca2+, are activated by the initial rise in [Ca2+]i, but by neither fMLP nor inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) directly.\r"

It is inherited as an X-linked recessive trait, and one-third of all cases are thought to result from de novo mutations. The clinical severity of haemophilia A varies markedly among different families and a subset of the patients with severe disease develop antibodies against factor VIII, called inhibitors. Because of this heterogeneity, it is likely that many different molecular lesions result in haemophilia A. Indeed, of the nine mutations described to date, all appear to be unique changes. However in this study of 83 patients with haemophilia A we have identified two different point mutations, one in exon 18 and one in exon 22, that have recurred independently in unrelated families. Each mutation produces a nonsense codon by a change of CG to TG, and each occurred de novo on the X-chromosome donated by the maternal grandfather. These observations strongly support the view that CpG dinucleotides are mutation hotspots.\r"

  ".W": "Several observations suggest that iron is essential for the development of malaria parasites but there is evidence that the parasites in erythrocytes do not obtain iron from haemoglobin. The total haemin level in parasitized erythrocytes does not vary during parasite development, indicating that the iron-containing moiety of haemoglobin is not detectably metabolized. Although parasite proteases can degrade the protein part of haemoglobin in red cells, no parasite enzymes that degrade haemin have been identified. In mammalian cells, haemin is degraded to carbon monoxide and bilirubin by the enzyme haeme oxygenase. This enzyme has not been found in malaria parasites. In fact haemin has been found to be toxic to parasite carbohydrate metabolism. Thus, iron apparently cannot be liberated from haemin and instead is sequestered in infected red cells as haemozoin, the characteristic pigment associated with malarial infection. If iron bound to transferrin is the source of ferric ions for malaria parasites within mature erythrocytes, then the parasite must synthesize its own transferrin receptor and localize it on the surface of the infected cell, because the receptors for transferrin are lost during erythrocyte maturation. Our results here suggest that Plasmodium falciparum synthesizes its own transferrin receptors enabling it to take up iron from transferrin by receptor-mediated endocytosis.\r"

  ".W": "The geographical position of the island of New Guinea suggests that it may have been an early staging post in the Pleistocene settlement of Australia from the Indonesia-Indochina region. Previous data have not supported this, as archaeological sites 35,000 to 40,000 years old occur in southern Australia, whereas the earliest previously known in Papua New Guinea is 26,000 years old. We now report evidence that the north coast of Papua New Guinea was occupied at least 40,000 years ago. Sahuland, which is the greater land area of Australia and New Guinea plus their connecting continental shelf exposed as land when Pleistocene sea levels were lower than now, was occupied by humans in several widely separated areas at that time. A distinctive 'waisted axe' culture appears to have existed in New Guinea and probably in Australia in the Late Pleistocene, but antecedents are not yet known from east and southeast Asia. There is evidence for hafting of these tools at a date which is earlier than known elsewhere in the world.\r"

  ".W": "The hyperpolarizing receptor potential in vertebrate rod photoreceptors appears to be mediated by the second messenger, cyclic GMP. Injection of cGMP into rods or application of cGMP to inside-out membrane patches activates a conductance resembling that produced by light. Light produces a rapid reduction of cGMP in living rods, leading to closure of sodium channels and membrane hyperpolarization. In most invertebrate photoreceptors the response to light is depolarizing. We have investigated whether cGMP is involved in controlling the increase in sodium conductance that underlies this depolarization. We show here that injection of cGMP into Limulus photoreceptors produces a depolarization that mimics the receptor potential. We also show that the cGMP concentration of the squid retina increases rapidly during exposure to light. These results support the hypothesis that cGMP mediates the light-induced depolarization in invertebrate photoreceptors and suggests that vertebrate and invertebrate phototransduction may be more similar than previously thought.\r"

The mechanism of ANP action is still unclear. ANP may reduce sodium reabsorption in the renal tubules, but it is also known that it increases the rate of glomerular filtration in the kidney, and relaxes preparations of smooth muscle, including one made from arteries that supply the kidney. To clarify its mode of action, we have studied directly the effects of semi-purified and synthetic ANP on blood vessels in the kidney of anaesthetized rats. We found that ANP causes a vasodilatation of the blood vessels which supply the glomeruli and a vasoconstriction of the arterioles which drain them. This substantiates the finding that increased filtration pressure participates in the natriuretic response.\r"

They have also been identified by surface marker analysis and susceptibility to various stimuli regulating growth and differentiation. We have searched for genes that are expressed at given stages in the B-lymphocyte development pathway and which might function to control this development at various stages. A complementary DNA sequence called pZ183 was found in a library constructed from messenger RNA of the murine pre-B lymphoma cell line 70Z/3 which is selectively expressed in pre-B cells. Here we report the nucleotide sequence of a cDNA clone (pZ183-1) containing 0.7 kilobases (kb) of the pZ183 gene. Part of this sequence shows strong homology to constant (C) and joining (J) region sequences of lambda 1 L chains. Our findings define a new immunoglobulin L-chain-related locus, which we call lambda 5, that is selectively transcribed in pre-B lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "The cerebrospinal fluid pulse pressure (CSFPP) has found application as a measure of intracranial elastance. However, CSFPP is also dependent on the magnitude of the pulsatile variation in cerebral blood volume (delta Vb). The purpose of the present study was to assess the effect on delta Vb of changes in systemic arterial pressure (SAP) and arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) as well as elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP). Therefore, delta Vb was computed from the electromagnetically measured flow profile in the vertebral artery of the dog on the assumption of a nonpulsatile cerebral venous outflow. During arterial hypotension, delta Vb was increased due to a shift of flow from diastole to systole, whereas mean flow was not affected. The reverse phenomenon was observed when SAP was raised. Changes in PaCO2 had little effect on pulsatile blood flow. The changes in total blood flow that occurred were evenly distributed over the cardiac cycle. Consequently, delta Vb was not significantly affected, although CSFPP was considerably changed. When ICP was raised, a breakpoint pressure was observed above which cerebral blood flow (CBF) decreased and CSFPP and delta Vb increased. This contradiction was explained by the finding of a decrease in diastolic flow, causing the fall in CBF, whereas systolic flow relative to mean flow was increased, resulting in an increased delta Vb. The underlying mechanisms of the pulsatile flow changes are extensively discussed. It is argued that the arterial inflow profile is largely determined by the compliance of the inflow section of the cerebral vascular bed. Vascular compliance is significantly altered by changes in SAP and ICP because they affect the transmural pressure of the vessels, whereas this is not the case during changes in PaCO2.\r"

  ".U": "87065518\r", 
  ".W": "Reversible osmotic blood-brain barrier (BBB) modification was used in 38 patients with glioblastoma to enhance the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents. The patients ranged in age from 14 to 70 years (mean, 43), and all had prior surgery and radiation; 5 had also received systemic chemotherapy. Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) scores ranged from 60 to 100% (mean, 79) on admission to the treatment program. Barrier modification was achieved by intracarotid or intravertebral artery infusion of mannitol, and a chemotherapy regimen of methotrexate, cytoxan, and procarbazine was given in conjunction with barrier modification. The 38 glioblastoma patients were compared to two control groups of patients with glioblastoma; these encompassed 14 patients treated with surgery and radiation and 8 treated with surgery, radiation, and systemic chemotherapy. Survival analysis using the Cox Proportional Hazards Regression Model (corrected for age, sex, presence or absence of necrosis, and functional status) showed that patients receiving chemotherapy with BBB modification had a statistically significant (P = 0.0006) longer expected survival (17.5 months) than the control groups (12.8 and 11.4 months, respectively). Presently 16 patients of the barrier-enhanced treatment group are alive at 5 to 42 months from diagnosis (median, 20) with KPS scores ranging from 40 to 90% (median, 65). The neurological complications seen included a stroke-like syndrome in 3 patients (1 with decreased motor movement in the hand, 1 with marked hemiparesis, and 1 with hemiplegia), transient exacerbation of preexisting neurological deficits lasting 2 to 3 days, and a 15% incidence of seizures during or within 24 hours of the BBB modification. In 2 of the 38 patients, radiographic documentation of central nervous system tumor regression concurrent with the development of new tumor nodule(s) in portions of the brain distant from the region of osmotic BBB opening was seen. These studies indicate that chemotherapeutic drug delivery to tumors (as well as surrounding brain) can be augmented by osmotic BBB modification and that such therapy can result in a prolongation of survival.\r"

The frequency of contractions, the number of contractions per burst, and the intraluminal peak pressure during contractions all increased during a narrow postconceptual period, 29 to 32 weeks, regardless of length of gestation before birth. Antenatal beta-methasone administration to the mothers of 11 additional infants of 26 to 32 weeks gestational age was associated with increased duodenal contraction rate, number of contractions per burst, and intraluminal peak pressure compared with infants of similar gestational age whose mothers did not receive beta-methasone. The maturational effect of beta-methasone on duodenal motility was most pronounced in infants whose gestational age at birth was 26 to 29 weeks. Seven infants of 31 weeks' or longer gestational duration who had a CNS abnormality or insult had fasting duodenal contraction rates that were less than one half of the rate for normal infants of similar gestational age. These observations suggest that neonatal duodenal motility undergoes marked maturational changes between 29 and 32 weeks after conception and that these changes may be inducible before 29 weeks by corticosteroid administration. An intact CNS appears to be required for full expression of the maturational changes.\r"

  ".W": "The diagnosis of partial peripheral and pituitary resistance to thyroid hormone was ultimately made in two boys, 7 and 9 years of age, and a 10-year-old girl who had goiters and hyperthyroxinemia. The boys were treated with propythiouracil and/or thyroidectomy or iodine 131 for suspected thyrotoxicosis but had poorly suppressible serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) post treatment in spite of the usual L-thyroxine replacement. The girl had increasing goiter size while receiving propylthiouracil, 100 mg every eight hours. These findings led to reevaluation of thyroid hormone dynamics in these children and their families. Twelve additional family members, 3 to 38 years of age, compatible with an autosomal dominant inheritance, were also found to have peripheral and pituitary resistance to thyroid hormone. All affected individuals had elevated serum thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels, normal to slightly elevated triiodothyronine resin uptakes, and a nonsuppressed serum TSH. The five individuals who were given thyrotropin-releasing hormone showed exaggerated TSH responses, which normalized on L-thyroxine therapy. Misdiagnosis in six of 15 family members led to significant morbidity (hypothyroidism, delayed growth, and therapy risk). A nonsuppressed serum TSH in a patient with suspected thyrotoxicosis should lead to suspicion of this disorder. Appropriate management for this condition includes L-thyroxine therapy to decrease goiter size and normalize TSH responses to thyrotropin-releasing hormone.\r"

  ".W": "We suggest that the following therapeutic regimen be followed in cases of isoniazid poisoning in children. In cases of intractable seizure activity in a child which remains unexplained, consider isoniazid poisoning. Give pyridoxine as an intravenous bolus to all children in whom isoniazid toxicity is suspected, who exhibit seizure activity and are known to have been exposed to isoniazid, or who have a history of ingesting one gram or more of isoniazid. It should be given on a gram-for-gram basis, and the clinician need not await serum isoniazid levels before administering pyridoxine. It can be safely given at a rate of five grams per three minutes in a 50 ml volume. In fact, serum isoniazid determinations are not available in many emergency departments and have not been shown to correlate closely with symptomatology. When available, serum isoniazid levels at best are subject to variability owing to sampling procedures (serum protein must be removed within two hours of sampling). The result is that serum isoniazid levels play only a minor role in the emergency department management of isoniazid poisoning. To potentiate the antidotal effects of pyridoxine, diazepam (0.1 mg/kg) may be given intravenously, preferably at a second intravenous site. Because the lactic acidosis seen after seizures resolves spontaneously, and because metabolic alkalosis may result following excess lactate loading, administration of bicarbonate is usually not necessary, and may be harmful in some cases. After pyridoxine treatment, syrup of ipecac may be given to empty the stomach.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Previous attempts at cloning gene 32 have failed due to a presumably deleterious effect on host cell viability. In addition, overexpression of gene 32 would be expected to be limited by the autoregulatory ability of the gene 32 product g32P. A repetitive A + T-rich sequence flanking the ribosome binding site of gene 32 has been implicated in this translational regulation. To circumvent these problems, the wild-type gene for g32P has been reconstructed in M13 using restriction fragments from T4 g32am453 and synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides so that it no longer includes its native promoter and putative autoregulatory region. The g32am453 codon TAG was changed back to TGG as in wild-type gene 32 using site-directed oligodeoxynucleotide mutagenesis. In vectors containing the lambda leftward promoter PL, gene 32 is overexpressed with the resulting transcripts being depressed at g32P concentrations that repress the wild-type gene 32 transcripts.\r"

To help elucidate the mechanism that regulates the production of these two mu mRNAs during the course of B-lymphoid maturation, we produced a series of specifically modified mu-chain genes and studied their expression when transfected into cells representing either early or late developmental stages. We have established that proper regulation depends on linkage of the mu s and mu m poly(A) addition sites and the length of the mu s-mu m intron. Deletion of an 800 to 900-nucleotide segment from the central region of this intron abolishes regulation; replacement of this segment with miscellaneous DNA sequences restores it. From these results we propose a model in which regulation is principally achieved by competition between cleavage/polyadenylylation of the mu s site and splicing of the C mu 4 and mu m exons.\r"

The N-terminal helix was monitored using antiserum to residues 9-19, calmodulin-(9-19); the C-terminal helix using antiserum to residues 141-148, calmodulin-(141-148); and the long central helix with antisera to residues 68-79 and 80-92, calmodulin-(68-79) and -(80-92). Crossreactivities of peptide antisera with calmodulin (either in the presence or absence of calcium) were determined using solution-phase and solid-phase immunoassays. When examined by the fluid-phase assay, all four peptides elicited antibody that precipitated radiolabeled apocalmodulin but not the calcium-saturated form of the protein. Similarly, when calmodulin was immobilized on a solid-support, only the calcium-free form readily bound the antibodies to calmodulin-(80-92) and -(141-148). In addition, the crossreactivity of antiserum to calmodulin-(68-79) with calcium-saturated calmodulin in solid phase was reduced by approximately equal to 40% relative to reactivity with apocalmodulin. According to the x-ray crystal structure of Ca2+-saturated calmodulin and the antigenic reactivity of calmodulin for the peptide antisera in the absence of calcium, the regions of the protein monitored by these antisera are exposed to the surface in both conformational states and probably accessible to specific antibodies. The apparent preference of peptide antibodies for one conformation of the molecule suggests that changes in the conformation of calmodulin occur in cognate sequences that are transformed by calcium from antigenic, flexible structures to less antigenic, relatively helical structures. Peptide antibodies may be employed as sequence-specific reporter molecules to monitor local conformational changes providing the cognate sequence is sterically accessible to antibody in both states but antigenic in only one.\r"

Optimal proton pumping, as assessed by ATP-generated acridine orange quenching and 32Pi-ATP exchange, is achieved with liposomes prepared from phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and cholesterol at a weight ratio of 40:26.5:7.5:26, and a lipid-to-protein weight ratio of 200:1. Under such conditions, the extent of decrease of ATP-generated acridine orange quenching is 150-fold greater than that of native clathrin-coated vesicles. Cholesterol is required to stabilize the proteoliposome.

Under conditions of chronic treatment with the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol, rat parotid glands show an approximately 10-fold increase in 4-beta-galactosyltransferase activity. The increased enzyme activity was reflected in dot-blot analysis of control and isoproterenol-treated rat parotid RNA by using the human cDNA as probe. Hybrid-selection and in vitro translation identified a protein product with a molecular mass of 47 kDa that was immunoprecipitated with the bovine antiserum. The full-length human cDNA clone was then isolated and the DNA sequence for the NH2-terminal portion of the protein was deduced. Comparison of the NH2-terminal protein sequence from the bovine protein with that of the human cDNA clone confirmed its identity.

The mannose-specific complex of the PTS, designated IIMan, comprises lipid and two membrane proteins, II-AMan and II-BMan. The proteins are encoded by ptsM, located at approximately equal to 40 minutes on the E. coli chromosome. A different genetic marker, pel, maps with ptsM, and is required for lambda DNA penetration of the cytoplasmic membrane. Earlier studies suggested that both pel function and II-BMan are encoded by the same gene, while a different gene (also in ptsM) encodes II-AMan. In the present studies, a ptsM clone, pCS13, was isolated from an E. coli HindIII gene bank in pBR322 and restored both mannose termentation and pel+ function to ptsM mutants defective in II-BMan. Subclones of pCS13 show that two distinct genes, manY and manZ, encode the pel+ function and the II-BMan protein, respectively; each gene may have its own promoter; whereas the protein encoded by manY (Pel) alone seems sufficient for lambda sensitivity, all three gene products are required for mannose fermentation, transport of the mannose analogue 2-deoxyglucose, and phosphorylation of the latter by cytoplasmic membranes. Thus, Pel is required for function of the IIMan complex. The efficiency of the complex may depend on the ratio of Pel to IIMan.\r"

When these sequences were fused to the N terminus of yeast cytochrome oxidase subunit IV lacking its own presequence, they directed the attached subunit IV to its correct intramitochondrial location in vivo. They also mediated import of subunit IV into isolated yeast mitochondria. In contrast, artificial sequences containing glutamine, arginine, and serine residues following the initiator methionine were inactive. Thus, the targeting function of mitochondrial presequences does not depend on specific amino acid sequences but may instead depend on the overall balance between basic, hydrophobic, and hydroxylated amino acids.\r"

  ".W": "Two affinity species of the interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor are different states of a single receptor molecule. We assumed that a binary complex between the IL-2 receptor and another lymphocyte-specific protein would constitute the high-affinity receptor. To test this assumption, we counted the numbers of IL-2 receptors with high and low affinity in a murine T-cell line CT/hR-1 that expresses not only murine but also human receptors by cDNA transfection. We found that human high-affinity receptors disappeared when the murine high-affinity receptors were already occupied by the ligand. The results were incompatible with a fixed number of human and murine receptors with high affinity in CT/hR-1 cells. We suggest that the high-affinity state of the IL-2 receptor is a ternary complex of IL-2, the IL-2 receptor, and a postulated \"converter\" protein, which is fewer in number than the receptors. The converter would be unable to form a complex with the IL-2 receptor unless IL-2 was already bound to it. The ligand binding to the receptor would cause a conformational change in the receptor, increasing its affinity to the converter. Ternary complex formation would, in turn, change the apparent affinity of the receptor to the ligand from low to high by reduction of the dissociation constant.\r"

We tested whether guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G or N proteins) are involved in the signal transduction mechanism between the somatostatin receptor and voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. Treatment of the cells with pertussis toxin, which selectively ADP ribosylates the GTP binding proteins Gi and Go and suppresses the ability of Gi to couple inhibitory receptors to adenylate cyclase, abolished the action of somatostatin on both ICa and intracellular free Ca2+. Intracellular application of the nonhydrolyzable guanine nucleotide analog guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP[gamma S]), which irreversibly activates G proteins, changed the somatostatin effect on ICa from a reversible to an irreversible inhibition. Intracellular GTP[gamma S] alone caused a very slowly developing inhibition of ICa. When ICa was inhibited by GTP[gamma S] (alone or with somatostatin), it failed to respond to subsequent applications of somatostatin. The effect of GTP[gamma S] on the inhibition of ICa by somatostatin was not altered by the intracellular application of cAMP and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. The results suggest that a GTP-binding protein is directly involved in the cAMP-independent receptor-mediated inhibition of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels.\r"

A chicken genomic clone that contains at least part of the coding region for the GS enzyme was used to investigate developmental changes in the level of GS mRNA in embryonic chicken retina. A major GS transcript (approximately equal to 3 kilobases) detected by the probe begins to accumulate sharply on day 15 of embryonic development. When cortisol is prematurely supplied to early embryonic retina, it induces precocious accumulation of GS mRNA and of the GS enzyme. At later ages, these effects of cortisol are significantly greater, which suggests that competence to transcribe or stabilize GS mRNA in response to stimulation with cortisol increases with development. Carbonic anhydrase II (CA-II) is expressed in early retina in all the cells, but it becomes later restricted to Muller glia. Using cloned CA-II cDNA, we detected a high level of CA-II mRNA in early retina, followed by a decline due to arrest of CA-II mRNA accumulation in differentiated neurons. As glia cells mature, CA-II mRNA and the enzyme increase to a new high level. Therefore, changes in CA-II gene expression during retina development reflect differentiation-dependent cell-type-specific control of CA-II mRNA accumulation.\r"

No similar studies have been done with invertebrates. Using the technique of DNA X DNA hybridization, we have measured the degree of nucleotide substitution between Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila yakuba for both single-copy nuclear DNA (scnDNA) and mtDNA. The change in melting temperature is the same in both types of DNA hybrids. Thus we conclude that mtDNA and scnDNA are evolving at similar rates in these Drosophila. Considerable DNA sequence data are available for the mtDNAs studied, allowing us to estimate that a 1 degree C change in melting temperature corresponds to a 1.5-2% base-pair mismatch.\r"

We describe here a monoclonal antibody, MECA-325, that defines an endothelial cell differentiation antigen selectively expressed on high endothelium in the mouse. Thus an antigen defining a specific functional subset of endothelial cells has been found. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the MECA-325 antigen can be induced in mouse lung or bone marrow-derived endothelial cell lines in vitro by interferon-gamma but not by interferon-beta, interleukin-1, or endothelial cell mitogens. The results define a unique marker associated with differentiated endothelial cells mediating lymphocyte traffic from the blood, and they provide evidence that the specialized phenotype of these high endothelial cells may be induced and controlled by local factors associated with immune activity.\r"

  ".U": "87067464\r", 
  ".W": "Two phenotypic markers of mouse immunoglobulin kappa light chains, the IB-peptide marker and the Ef1a isoelectric focusing marker, are expressed by the C58/J, AKR/J, RF/J, and PL/J strains (called expressor strains) but not by BALB/c and most inbred strains. Expression is linked to the kappa light-chain locus and the Lyt-2/Lyt-3 genes on chromosome 6. Light chains bearing these markers belong to a group of variable region kappa chain (V kappa) regions called V kappa Ser, which has a serine amino terminus and a framework 1 region not observed to date among BALB/c light chains. Southern hybridization of genomic DNA with a V kappa Ser-specific cDNA probe has demonstrated a single strongly hybridizing DNA fragment in all strains of mice tested. Characteristic restriction enzyme polymorphisms define the V kappa Ser alleles of expressor (Igk-VSera) and nonexpressor (Igk-VSerb) strains. In the present study, the unrearranged V kappa Ser gene and its flanking regions from an expressor (C.C58) and nonexpressor (BALB/c) strain have been cloned and their nucleotide sequences determined. The C.C58 V kappa Ser gene isolated (the Igk-VSera allele) was shown to code for the two phenotypic markers described. While the nucleotide sequence of the BALB/c coding region (the Igk-VSerb allele) shows 97% identity with the C.C58 gene, single nucleotide substitutions lead to structural changes in the encoded protein which render it IB-negative and Ef1a-negative. These differences alone can explain the failure of strains containing the BALB/c allele to express these kappa-chain phenotypic markers. Also, the BALB/c gene contains a single substitution in a conserved octamer sequence approximately equal to 100 nucleotides upstream of the coding region, which could affect its expression. Finally, the C.C58 allele contains a BAM5/R repetitive DNA element approximately equal to 1200 nucleotides upstream of the coding regions that is not present in BALB/c. This element gives rise to the EcoRI and BamHI restriction enzyme polymorphisms, which distinguish the Igk-VSera and Igk-VSerb alleles.\r"

At least four elements 5' to the gene were found to be involved in DQ beta regulation. Deletion of sequences from -2500 to -159 base pairs (bp) resulted in increased transcription, suggesting that negative regulatory elements resided in the deleted region. These clones were all capable of responding to gamma-IFN. Further deletion of sequences from -159 to -128 bp resulted in constitutive high level transcription and the inability of these constructions to respond to gamma-IFN. A deletion to -107 bp resulted in a decrease in the basal level of expression that was restored by removal of the 5' DNA sequence to -82 bp, suggesting the presence of a second negative element. Finally, deletion to -64 bp caused a marked decrease in expression, suggesting the loss of an element necessary for high levels of transcription. The gamma-IFN control and the transcription control elements contain the conserved upstream sequences found in all class II genes, suggesting a role for these sequences.\r"

A cloned cDNA has been used to identify CD1 genes in a human genomic library. Five CD1 genes have been isolated, and Southern blot analysis suggests that these represent all the cross-hybridizing human CD1 genes. They share a highly conserved exon, which is homologous to the beta 2-microglobulin-binding domain (alpha 3) of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens. In this domain, amino acid sequences are 71-88% homologous. However, the homology between CD1 and MHC class I alpha 3 domains is only 21%. This is the same degree of homology as between either of them and the class II beta 2 domain, which does not bind beta 2-microglobulin. The evolutionary implications of these results are discussed.\r"

EDRF was released from porcine aortic endothelial cells in culture and bioassayed on a cascade of superfused rabbit aortic strips. These compounds inhibited EDRF-induced relaxation of vascular strips, without affecting the relaxation induced by glyceryl trinitrate, and their inhibitory potency was markedly attenuated (by more than 1 order of magnitude) by the addition of superoxide dismutase (5-15 units/ml) or oxidized cytochrome c (20-40 microM) but not by catalase (30 units/ml) or heat-inactivated superoxide dismutase. These data indicate that the above five inhibitors inactivate EDRF through the formation of superoxide ions, which have recently been shown to destroy EDRF. The inhibition of EDRF by these compounds is therefore attributable to their redox properties rather than to any specific biological action.\r"

Although RS virus-specific human lymphocytes have been demonstrated, neither the phenotype nor the function of the lymphocytes was characterized. We describe here the induction of anti-RS virus cytotoxic T lymphocytes, in both bulk culture and restimulated cell lines, from human peripheral blood. Infection of Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human B-cell lines with RS virus in vitro readily caused a persistent infection; these cells continued to synthesize RS viral proteins and secrete infectious RS virus 4 months after infection. The persistently infected cells were used both to restimulate cytotoxic-T-cell precursors and as targets for RS virus-specific cytotoxic T cells.\r"

  ".W": "Human platelets stimulated by epinephrine undergo enhanced turnover of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, accumulate inositol trisphosphate, diacylglycerol, and phosphatidic acid, and phosphorylate a 47-kDa protein. All of these phenomena indicate stimulation of phospholipase C. These responses are blocked completely by inhibitors of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors (yohimbine), cyclooxygenase (aspirin or indomethacin), phospholipase A [2-(p-amylcinnamoyl)amino-4-chlorobenzoic acid (ONO-RS-082)], Na+/H+ exchange [ethylisopropylamiloride (EIPA)], fibrinogen binding to glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (antibody A2A9), Ca2+/Mg+ binding (EDTA), or removal of fibrinogen. Epinephrine evokes (i) an increased turnover of ester-linked arachidonic acid in aspirin treated platelets that is inhibited by ONO-RS-082, EDTA, yohimbine, or the absence of fibrinogen and (ii) a rapid cytoplasmic alkalinization that is inhibited partially by blockage of cyclooxygenase activity and completely by A2A9 or EIPA. In contrast, when incubated with subaggregatory concentrations of the prostaglandin H2/thromboxane A2 analogue [(15S)-hydroxy-11 alpha,9 alpha-(epoxymethano)prosta-5,13-dienoic acid (U46619) and epinephrine, aspirin-treated platelets show a potentiation of phospholipase C activation that is unaffected by the above inhibitors. We propose that epinephrine, in promoting exposure of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa sites for fibrinogen binding, leads to a cytoplasmic alkalinization, which, in conjunction with local shifts in Ca2+, promotes low-level activation of phospholipase A. The resulting free arachidonic acid is converted to cyclooxygenase products, which, potentiated by epinephrine, activate phospholipase C. This further amplifies the initial stimulatory response.\r"

No effect of either dexamethasone or fetal calf serum was seen on arachidonic acid release from cystic fibrosis lymphocytes, in contrast to control lymphocytes. In the latter cells, arachidonic acid release was inhibited by dexamethasone, fetal calf serum, or both. There were no differences in glucocorticoid receptor in lymphocytes from the two groups with regard to Kd and number of binding sites per cell. Furthermore, dexamethasone inhibited the incorporation of thymidine into lymphocytes from either group, indicating a normal functional glucocorticoid receptor. The defective regulation of arachidonic acid, resulting in an increased turnover, can explain many of the findings in cystic fibrosis, and we hypothesize that it is the basic defect causing the disease. The defect occurs at a level after the glucocorticoid receptor, which is functionally normal, and involves either the glucocorticoid-dependent phospholipase-inhibitory protein lipomodulin (lipocortin) or phospholipase A2.\r"

Thus we were able to detect the expression of the gene(s) encoding the intracellular chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan produced by a variety of rat and mouse mucosal-like mast cells and the intracellular heparin proteoglycan synthesized by rat serosal mast cells. The cDNA from the proteoglycan cDNA clone pPG-1 was fractionated into two discrete fragments, one of which contained the nucleotides encoding the serine-glycine repeat sequence (pPG-B) and the other of which contained sequences on the 3' side of the repeat (pPG-M). As assessed by Southern blot analysis, pPG-B identified a large gene family, whereas pPG-M identified a single DNA fragment in the rat genome. When the pPG-1 insert and the two subcloned probes pPG-B and pPG-M were used to analyze RNA extracted from the rat and mouse mucosal-like mast cells and the rat serosal mast cells, the same major RNA species was detected at 1.3 kilobases with both probes. These data suggest that the gene responsible for the peptide core of the extracellular chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan synthesized by the rat yolk sac cell line is also the gene that encodes the core peptides of the secretory granule-localized chondroitin sulfate and heparin proteoglycans.\r"

In this study we show that IL-2 can specifically inhibit the proliferation of neonatal rat oligodendrocyte progenitor cells cultured in a serumless, chemically defined medium (oligodendrocyte-defined medium; ODM). IL-2 inhibited both [3H]thymidine incorporation and increase in cell number. Specificity was shown by precipitating IL-2 activity with anti-IL-2 antiserum. Furthermore, growth inhibition depended on the expression of Tac (an anti-IL-2 receptor monoclonal antibody)-positive receptors (IL-2 receptor). When cells were cultured in the presence of IL-2, both Tac-positive staining and growth inhibition were no longer expressed. The addition of interleukin 1 had no effect on [3H]thymidine incorporation or changes in cell number. However, when IL-1 was subsequently added together with IL-2, Tac expression and IL-2-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation was induced. This inhibitory effect was not due to a sensitive subpopulation because greater than 90% of the culture was Tac positive. Taken together, these data show that IL-2 can specifically inhibit oligodendrocyte proliferation and acts via Tac-positive receptors.\r"

The purified substance was characterized as the benzodiazepine N-desmethyldiazepam (nordiazepam). The techniques used for the identification were mass spectrometry, HPLC, spectrophotometry, benzodiazepine receptor binding, and immunological techniques. Benzodiazepine-like immunoreactivity was also found in all the human brains tested, including six brains that had been stored in paraffin since 1940, fifteen years before the first synthesis of benzodiazepines. These results show that benzodiazepine-like molecules of natural origin--and possibly benzodiazepines themselves--are present in human and other mammalian brains.\r"

  ".U": "87067489\r", 
  ".W": "The differentiation antigen T4, present on the helper/inducer subset of T lymphocytes, is thought to serve as the receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We find that a 60-kDa protein, immunoprecipitable by monoclonal antibody (mAb) OKT4, is present on membranes from human brain as well as human T cells. Furthermore, the radioiodinated HIV envelope glycoprotein [125I-labeled gp120 (125I-gp120)] can be specifically covalently affixed to a molecule present on rat, monkey, and human brain membranes to yield a complex that is indistinguishable from that formed on human T cells. T4 antigen has been studied on unfixed squirrel monkey, rat, and human brain sections by autoradiography using the mAb OKT4. A highly conserved neuroanatomical pattern has been demonstrated, suggesting an analogous organization in these three mammalian brains. Furthermore, the localization of 125I-gp120 receptor binding appears similar to that of T4 and is highly reminiscent of patterns for many previously characterized neuropeptide receptors. A computer-assisted analysis of gp120 suggested that a previously unremarkable octapeptide sequence within the gp120 protein, which we have synthesized and termed \"peptide T,\" may play an important role in HIV attachment. Thus, peptide T and three rationally designed peptide analogs, each with a systematic amino acid substitution, potently inhibit specific 125I-gp120 binding to brain membranes. Additionally, when tested in a viral infectivity assay, these peptides show the same rank order and similar absolute potency to block HIV infection of human T cells. Thus, peptide T may provide a useful pharmacological or immunological basis for the control and treatment of AIDS.\r"

Immunocytochemical staining of the cultures showed the presence of a large number of glutamic acid decarboxylase-containing neurons, and electrical stimulation of randomly selected neurons produced in many cases chloride-mediated and bicuculline-sensitive inhibitory synaptic currents in postsynaptic cells. The amplitude and decay time of the inhibitory synaptic currents were increased by flunitrazepam and decreased by the beta-carboline derivative methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, two high-affinity ligands for the allosteric regulatory sites of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors. The imidazobenzodiazepine Ro 15-1788, another high-affinity ligand of the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor regulatory sites that has negligible intrinsic activity, blocked the action of flunitrazepam and beta-carboline. However, Ro 15-1788 also increased the decay rate of the inhibitory synaptic currents. This might suggest that an endogenous ligand for the benzodiazepine-beta-carboline binding site is operative in gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated synaptic transmission.\r"

Since macroglossia is primarily a condition that requires treatment on a symptomatic basis, definition of the problem in clinical terms is the most useful form for the practitioner. Based on published reports and our clinical experience, a classification scheme for macroglossia has been formulated. The concept of true macroglossia and relative macroglossia form a framework that categorizes acquired and congenital forms of tongue enlargement. True macroglossia exists when histologic abnormalities correlate with the clinical findings of tongue enlargement. Vascular malformations, muscular enlargement, and tumors are the most common forms of true macroglossia. Relative macroglossia includes those cases of apparent tongue enlargement in which the histology does not provide a pathologic explanation. Down's syndrome is a commonly quoted cause for tongue enlargement and is a form of relative macroglossia. The development of this classification system establishes an approach and common terminology on which therapy, research, and communication can be based.\r"

These habits are having never smoked, drinking less than five drinks at one sitting, sleeping 7-8 hours a night, exercising, maintaining desirable weight for height, avoiding snacks, and eating breakfast regularly. The Alameda study focused attention on the importance of everyday practices for the maintenance of good health and, ultimately, for longer life. This report presents selected findings on the prevalence of the seven Alameda practices (defined slightly differently in some cases) among the general U.S. population aged 18 years and older, by sex, according to age, education, income, and race. In general, men are more likely than women to smoke, drink, and exercise. Younger people are more likely than older people to skip breakfast, snack, and drink, and younger women are more likely than older women to smoke. Education, income, and racial differences were found for most health practices. Of all subgroups discussed, blacks, particularly black women, are the most likely to have lifestyles that would be considered unhealthy using the Alameda criteria. Overall, the data reported suggest that although large numbers of U.S. adults have healthy habits, many do not, particularly persons in socially and economically disadvantaged groups.\r"

Those three objectives concerned the proportions of households with a properly placed and functioning smoke detector (63.2 percent, as shown by the survey), parents who can identify appropriate measures to address the risks to their children of motor vehicle injuries, burns, and poisonings (39.1 percent), and primary health providers who advise their patients about the importance of using safety belts and child restraint devices in cars (47.0 percent). Further, information was gathered on the proportion of adults using seatbelts all or most of the time (35.5 percent) and the proportion of those who knew the range of hot water temperatures (120 degrees to 130 degrees F.) above which scald injuries can occur (21.3 percent). In general, the data demonstrated a direct relationship of injury prevention awareness to education and income. In the future it will be important to demonstrate that increasing injury awareness has a measurable, beneficial impact on injury mortality and morbidity rates.\r"

A specially developed scoring algorithm was used to determine the percentage of persons participating in appropriate physical activity (that is, \"exercise which involves large muscle groups in dynamic movement for periods of 20 minutes or longer, 3 or more days per week, and which is performed at an intensity of 60 percent or greater of an individual's cardiorespiratory capacity\" and three other categories: regular activity, but not appropriate physical activity; irregular activity; and those who were sedentary. Results revealed that the young and persons of relatively high socioeconomic status are more likely to perform appropriate physical activity in their leisure time. When rigid criteria were used, only 5.1 percent of those surveyed knew the appropriate duration, frequency, and intensity of physical activity needed to strengthen the heart and lungs. It was not possible to determine if exercise prevalence has increased in recent years; however, it will be possible to detect trends in the future when this survey is repeated in 1990.\r"

  ".W": "Several questions in the 1985 Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Questionnaire, which was part of the 1985 National Health Interview Survey, addressed respondents' consumption of alcohol. Sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge of health risks related to heavy drinking, health practices, and the prevalence of certain health conditions were examined in relation to drinking levels. Although cause-effect relationships should not be inferred from the associations, the findings suggest some provocative areas for prevention and research. Heavier drinkers were more commonly found among men than women. Level of drinking was associated positively with years of education and family income, but was inversely related to age. Compared with light drinkers, heavier drinkers were much more likely to drive after they had had too much to drink. While more than 90 percent of the population knew that heavier drinking increases the risk of 'liver cirrhosis, less than half knew about the increased risk of throat cancer and cancer of the mouth. Most respondents aged 18-44 years (80 percent or more) knew that heavy drinking increases the chance of adverse pregnancy outcomes, and more women than men (62 versus 49 percent) had heard of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). However, 70 percent or more of those who had heard of FAS described the syndrome as a newborn addicted to alcohol rather than a child born with certain birth defects. Heavier drinkers of both sexes were less likely than others to be nonsmokers, and moderate drinkers were more likely than others to exercise or play sports regularly. Moderate drinkers also tended to have lower lifetime prevalence rates than others for hypertension and heart trouble.\r"

Survey results showed remarkably high levels of knowledge concerning the increased risks associated with uncontrolled high blood pressure. Nine of 10 adults in the United States knew that high blood pressure increases the risk of heart disease, and 3 of 4 knew that high blood pressure is the most significant risk factor for stroke. The majority of both the general public and the subgroup of the population identified as hypertensives reported knowing the results of their last blood pressure measurement; and, most importantly, almost two-thirds of the identified hypertensives reported that their pressures were under control at last measurement. Data examining professional advice, given and acted upon to achieve blood pressure goals, show that almost two-thirds of the hypertensives currently report taking antihypertensive medication. Results also suggest a degree of willingness by both professionals and hypertensives to attempt nondrug approaches to controlling pressures. The large majority of hypertensives who were advised by a health professional to cut down on sodium, lose weight, and exercise reported they were following this advice. These findings will be used to further refine high blood pressure education strategies and advance the progress toward meeting the 1990 hypertension objectives.\r"

This file was divided into a WIC group containing 3,261 records and a non-WIC group of 5,825 records. The 1982 results generally confirm the 1980 results, with the 1982 findings showing slightly improved pregnancy outcomes for WIC participants and slightly reduced benefit-to-cost ratios compared with the 1980 findings. In 1982, WIC participation was found to be associated with an increase in mean birth weight of 31 grams and reductions in low birth weight rates (statistically significant) and in neonatal death rates (not statistically significant). The reduction in each rate was 23 percent. WIC participation was also associated with a reduction in Medicaid costs for newborns reported within 45 days of birth amounting to $76 per participant. For every dollar spent on WIC, about 49 cents in Medicaid costs were apparently saved. However, wide 95 percent confidence intervals ($.07, $.90) make it difficult to determine precisely what impact WIC has on Federal and State budget outlays.\r"

The project's goal was to enable NIPSOM to become self-sufficient in the analysis by microcomputer of health, population, and family planning data; program evaluation; and policy activities. Lack of a local microcomputer infrastructure demanded that a local team of experts be developed to run the system described in a previous report. Five NIPSOM faculty members--three of whom had taken the workshop held when the system was first installed--were assigned to a computer committee, which was responsible for the computer's well-being. Six months after the microcomputer system was installed, a second 2-week workshop was given. The consortium's consultant facilitated the development of a basic microcomputer course, which was taught by four members of the computer committee to an additional eight NIPSOM faculty members. Emphasis was placed on developing local self-reliance and the need to overcome obstacles imposed by the lack of local hardware and software support systems. A strategy is proposed for the successful introduction of microcomputers in developing countries.\r"

These acts have been amended several times, and other laws dealing with safety of foods and drinks have been enacted. Food- and beverage-transmitted infectious diseases that were so devastating after the Civil War have been controlled. Nutritional deficiencies such as pellagra are almost nonexistent. Mass episodes of poisoning of food by chemical contaminants that have plagued some other countries have not occurred in the United States. Other factors such as refrigeration and improved transportation have helped, but it is probable that food safety regulatory activities have contributed to the saving of the 1.8 million Americans who would die each year if the public health advances since 1900 had not been made. Effective use of information was a key factor in the improvement in public health. Now, as then, effective information systems are needed.\r"

Regression analyses of changes in hospitalization rates for particular types of injury in relation to rates of persons served in 54 service units suggests some favorable effect of certain activities and possible adverse effect of a few. Increased targeting of effort based on detailed surveillance of serious injuries is planned.\r"

  ".W": "The first generation of projects in the Federal Area Health Education Center (AHEC) Program was funded in 1972. Those AHEC projects, located in predominantly rural areas, focused on problems that resulted from the geographic maldistribution of health professionals, especially primary care physicians. Education programs for health professionals, students, and practitioners were used to influence the geographic distribution of health professionals and to improve access to and quality of health care for underserved populations. In 1976, the Congress redrafted the law authorizing the expenditure of funds for AHECs and emphasized that improving access to health care in urban underserved areas also was to be addressed by the program. During the early years of urban AHEC development, it was not clear which lessons learned from rural AHEC experiences could be applied to urban communities and what would be the best focus for AHEC activities in the complex urban environment. Some said that urban areas were so different from rural areas--in economic, racial, and cultural terms and in the subtlety of barriers to health care--as to make the rural AHEC experience largely irrelevant. Others maintained that basic AHEC principles could be applied, regardless of setting, with changes only in tactics to address the problems of the urban inner city. Now that 18 of the total 53 AHECs nationally are urban, and a decade of experience in developing them has been accumulated, it is appropriate to compare the types of educational interventions supported by AHECs in urban and rural environments and the relative priorities of such programs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Rates of use for this population--a stratified random sample of 672 Medicaid-eligible children under age 17 years who lived in a 24-county area of northern Florida--were similar to those in a national study of chronically ill children. Further, the rates were shown to increase significantly as limitations to activity increased. Younger children and white children were also shown to have significantly higher use rates than older children and black children. Despite these associations, and those related to primary diagnoses, none of the analyses were able to explain much of the variation in the use of health care resources. The findings were similar to those of other studies; thus, the identification of the relatively small numbers of children who consume relatively large amounts of health care remains elusive.\r"

More than half of the smokers (57 percent) expressed the desire to quit, and 81 percent had tried to do so in the past. Major reasons for trying to quit were to protect future health, save money, self-discipline, and pressure from significant others. Most (90 percent) of the students who had tried to quit had attempted to do so on their own and all at once. Knowledge of the health consequences of smoking was not significantly related to smoking behavior. These data suggest the need for health educators to promote personal health practices among their students that are congruent with the goals of the nursing profession of health promotion and disease prevention.\r"

Eighty-eight percent of hepatocellular carcinomas showed hyperechoic change, 70% of metastatic tumors exhibited hypoechoic change with the rim sign. The marginal spotty hyperechoic change and the internal spotty hyperechoic change were specific for cavernous hemangioma and fibrous granuloma, respectively. This method of enhancement is useful in assessing the nature of liver tumors and in the detection of small nodules in the liver.\r"

The small, nonconjugative, beta-lactamase-specifying plasmids of N. gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus species are highly related. Phenotypically cryptic plasmids found in several epidemiologically distinct isolates of Haemophilus parainfluenzae are highly related to the beta-lactamase plasmids but carry no transposon A (TnA) sequences. This evidence strongly favors the hypothesis that the beta-lactamase plasmids evolved by the insertion of TnA (possibly introduced from enteric bacteria) into cryptic plasmids resident in H. parainfluenzae.\r"

A review of the literature, which yielded 23 other reports of endocarditis due to this organism, suggests that Lactobacillus is a rare cause of endocarditis. Typically, it occurs in a patient with preexisting structural heart disease (20 of 24 [83%]) and often with some form of recent dental infection or manipulation (18 of 24 [75%]). Six (25%) of 24 patients died of this infection; however, only one (5%) of 19 who were treated with adequate antimicrobial therapy died. The response to antimicrobial therapy was better in the more recent cases. Of those 18 patients who completed a full course of therapy, seven (39%) experienced a relapse; five of these were cured of their infection with a second course of antimicrobial therapy, which usually included higher doses of intravenous penicillin. Our case represents the second reported case that required surgical intervention for cure. Embolic phenomena occurred in 10 (42%) of 24 cases. Various combinations of antibiotics have been successful in achieving cure; however, at present, high-dose penicillin (greater than 25 million units/day) in combination with an aminoglycoside for a period of six weeks appears to be the optimum therapy.\r"

In addition, when agents that activate protein kinase C (second messenger diacylglycerol or a tumor-promoting phorbol ester) were added to nonattached oligodendrocytes, they mimicked the influence of the substratum by inducing phosphorylation of myelin basic protein; and reagents that increase cellular adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) inhibited phosphorylation of myelin basic protein. Thus, at least in vitro, the interaction between oligodendrocytes and the substratum may mediate myelinogenic events, and phosphorylation of myelin basic protein may be an early requirement in the sequence of steps that ultimately results in myelin formation.\r"

The effect of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) on c-myc expression was investigated in HeLa cells, which respond to these cytokines by a specific arrest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Northern blot and nuclear transcription analyses indicated that each cytokine reduced within 1 to 3 hours the c-myc messenger RNA levels as a result of transcriptional inhibition. Adding the two cytokines together at saturating levels resulted in enhanced inhibition of c-myc transcription and of the c-myc messenger RNA steady-state levels. While the reduction of c-myc messenger RNA by IFN-gamma was dependent on new protein synthesis, the inhibitory effect of TNF on c-myc messenger RNA was direct and was not abrogated by cycloheximide. The differential effect of the protein synthesis inhibitor and the cooperative inhibitory effects of the two cytokines when added together suggest that IFN-gamma and TNF reduce c-myc transcription through different molecular mechanisms.\r"

The possibility that thyroid hormones increase cell growth by stimulating secretion of a growth factor was investigated. Thyroid hormones are nearly an absolute requirement for the division of GH4C1 rat pituitary tumor cells plated at low density. Conditioned media from cells grown with or without L-triiodothyronine (T3) were treated with an ion exchange resin to remove T3 and were tested for ability to stimulate the division of GH4C1 cells. Conditioned medium from T3-treated cells was as active as thyroid hormone at promoting GH4C1 cell growth but did not elicit other thyroid hormone responses, induction of growth hormone, and down-regulation of thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptors, as effectively as T3 did. A substance or substances associated with T3-induced growth stimulatory activity migrated at high molecular weight at neutral pH and was different from known growth-promoting hormones induced by T3. The results demonstrate that thyroid hormones stimulate the division of GH4C1 pituitary cells by stimulating the secretion of an autocrine growth factor.\r"

Furthermore, these changes may be mutually exclusive. How then do we define malnutrition? Strictly, malnutrition starts, as we have shown, when the patient fails to eat enough to meet needs and progresses through a series of functional changes that precede any changes in body composition. These functional changes are related to the duration of reduced intake and its severity. Finally, body wasting occurs, and biochemical indices become abnormal. To base the definition of malnutrition on any one of these changes is inappropriate. Thus, a patient's nutritional status should be defined by the following criteria: nutrient intake in relation to needs; associated changes in organ function; associated changes in body composition; and associated changes in biochemistry. Only by recognizing the different facets of malnutrition can we define its various manifestations in relation to our clinical objectives. In attempting to achieve this goal, we have found muscle function tests a most useful and objective investigational tool.\r"

In a second cluster of psychologic consequences are the emotional responses of anxiety and depression. A third type of psychologic consequence is perceptual in nature and is most commonly represented by changes in palatability of foods. A fourth psychologic aspect of food intake and cancer includes attitudinal responses, wherein social, religious, cultural, and other values related to food may change as a consequence of the disease. Studies are needed in this area. Approaches to nutritional care that address the psychologic impact of cancer are described. As a means of maintaining adequate nutritional status, artificial feeding routes may create psychologic problems. In general, cancer and its treatment can exert a negative impact on quality of life. Finally, the ethics of feeding are discussed in terms of care giving versus alimentation.\r"

  ".W": "Cancer patients in whom elective surgical intervention is planned are frequently malnourished. Moreover, the tumor itself may be responsible for additionally altering metabolism in the host, although the mechanisms by which this occurs are not clear. All preoperative cancer patients should be carefully surveyed for indices of malnutrition. Patients with a history of inadequate oral protein and calorie intake, an unintentional weight loss of greater than 10 pounds, or a serum albumin level of less than 3.5 gm per dl should undergo a thorough nutritional assessment, including anthropometric measurements, 24-hour urinary urea nitrogen and creatinine measurements, and recall skin antigen testing. Surgical risk may be predicted by using indices that are sensitive and specific in assessing preoperative parameters of malnutrition. Adequate nutritional support for 7 to 10 days prior to surgery should be provided to all patients falling into the high-risk category and has been shown to significantly reduce the rate of postoperative complications and death in this group. Generally, a serum albumin of less than 3 gm per dl, a recent unintentional weight loss of greater than 10 to 15 per cent of normal body weight, and/or skin test anergy should be considered to designate high risk. In the formulation of a nutritional plan, estimates of daily energy requirements are essential and can be made by use of the Harris-Benedict equation, metabolic cart measurements, and perhaps 24-hour urinary creatinine values. Generally, 30 to 45 kcal per kg of body weight with 1.2 to 1.5 gm of protein per kg of body weight daily, regardless of the route of delivery, will provide adequate nutritional support. Patients should be fed by the enteral route if possible. Although oral intake is preferable, many malnourished cancer patients will be unable to achieve necessary protein and calorie requirements in this manner.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The influence of nutritional status on the resumption of adequate food intake in 101 patients recovering from colorectal cancer operation was examined. Two thirds of these patients were well-nourished; the others were malnourished. Malnutrition criteria were serum albumin of less than 3.5 gm per dl plus any two of the following four factors: recent weight loss greater than 10 per cent or weight for height, mid-arm circumference, and triceps skinfold thickness lower than the tenth percentile. Over half of the well-nourished patients were eating 60 per cent or greater of their caloric requirements by the tenth postoperative day, whereas only one quarter of the malnourished patients had attained this intake. the morbidity and mortality in 33 malnourished patients was 52 and 12 per cent, respectively, compared with 31 and 6 per cent (p less than 0.01) in 68 nourished patients. The duration of postoperative functional starvation in malnourished patients without complications increased to an average of 22 days following a complication and was further prolonged after a complication. Age or operative procedure (curative or palliative) did not influence complication rate. Our data suggest that postoperative nutritional support as either TPN or enteral feeding using an elemental diet is indicated in malnourished patients and in well-nourished patients immediately following a complication requiring therapeutic intervention.\r"

Some of these factors are related to the tumor, many to the treatment itself, and some to failure of recognition of PEM. Not all children with cancer are at great risk for the development of PEM. These patients must be monitored and supported with comprehensive enteral programs. Children who have developed or are at risk for PEM must be identified and supported with CPN or PPN plus CEN during early intensive periods of treatment and during the later phases of abdominal radiotherapy, operative resection of tumor, or relapse. The decision to institute CPN must be based not only on the child's current nutritional status but also on the nature of the therapy he or she is soon to receive and the likelihood that he or she will be able to maintain an adequate intake during that therapy. Realistic goals must be set for nutritional support. The value of nutritional intervention lies in its ability to correct or prevent the development of adverse effects related to PEM. This support is hoped to contribute to improved tolerance of therapy, increased energy to complete normal day-to-day activities, and an improved sense of well-being for the child. If these goals have been accomplished, then the nutritional therapy has been successful.\r"

The paradox of the strong response to transplantation antigen on lymphoreticular cells and the weak response to the same antigen on graft parenchymal cells can be explained by the signaling requirements for T lymphocyte activation.\r"

There were 37 male and 22 female patients with a mean age of 38.3 years. The mechanism of injury was blunt trauma in 42 and penetrating injury in 17 patients. The mean injury severity score (ISS) was 30.7 +/- 13.8 (mean plus or minus standard deviation). The duration of SICU care was 5.4 +/- 6.1 days. Over-all, 18 patients died. For the entire group, payment based upon a DRG system would have resulted in an over-all loss of $1,468,094.00 or $24,883.00 dollars per patient. Calculated DRG payments would have accounted for only 32.3 per cent of the total hospital charges. Calculated losses for 41 survivors would have been $1,098,431.00 dollars. Length of stay had a significant relationship to the calculated DRG payment (r = 0.69, p less than 0.001) but account for only 48 per cent of the variance. DRG only accounted for 26 per cent of the variance in charges despite a statistically significant relationship (r = 0.51, p less than 0.001). No statistically significant relationship was found between ISS and hospital charge by linear regression (r = 0.20, p greater than 0.01) or between ISS and DRG payment (r = 0.14, p less than 0.4). DRG as presently formulated would only pay one-third of total hospital charges for patients with trauma requiring SICU care. Present DRG payment schedules reflect neither the elements of care currently expended nor the modifiers necessary to adjust for acuity and severity. The ISS score would not be a useful modifier to correct DRG payment in this high cost group.\r"

Because of this association, the duodenum was explored during a recent laparotomy for resection of bilateral pheochromocytoma in a patient with von Recklinghausen's disease. A clinically unsuspected ampullary tumor was discovered; this proved to be in part a ganglioneuroma and in part a somatostatin-rich carcinoid. This paper presents full details of this carefully investigated and documented case and reviews the recent advances in this field. These studies lead us to conclude that: the clinical association of neurofibromatosis, pheochromocytoma, and D cell carcinoids (\"somatostatinomas\") of the ampullary region is confirmed; this association may be more common than has been previously thought, and the duodenum should be carefully examined in any patient with neurofibromatosis who undergoes laparotomy for pheochromocytoma.\r"

Grafted islets responded appropriately to an exogenous cholinergic agent given intravenously. However, no insulin secretory response could be observed in grafted dogs after vagal stimulation, which markedly increased portal insulin levels in control dogs. Therefore, intrasplenic islets are not under direct vagal control. At the basal state, normal oscillatory release of insulin was observed in the animals with grafts, suggesting that the mechanism of rhythmic basal insulin release is intrinsic to the islet of Langerhans with no regulatory input from the vagus nerve or any element of pancreatic structure.\r"

  ".W": "Leukotriene D4 (LTD4) may be an important mediator in asthma. The effect of verapamil and sodium cromoglycate on LTD4 induced bronchoconstriction has been examined in seven patients with asthma. The bronchoconstrictor response to increasing concentrations of inhaled LTD4 (0.0032-50 micrograms/ml) was assessed by measuring changes in FEV1, specific airways conductance, and flow rate at 30% of vital capacity (V30(p)). Results were expressed as the provocation concentration (PC) producing a 10% fall in FEV1 (PC10FEV1), a 35% fall in specific airways conductance (PC35SGaw), and a 30% fall in flow at 30% of vital capacity (PC30 V30(p)). Neither verapamil nor cromoglycate inhibited LTD4 induced bronchoconstriction in asthmatic subjects. These results suggest that in asthmatic patients LTD4 induced bronchoconstriction is not mediated via verapamil or cromoglycate sensitive mechanisms.\r"

Bacterial growth and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of 33 culture pairs from sputum and contamination free endobronchial swabs from 14 patients with cystic fibrosis were compared. As expected, Pseudomonas aeruginosa of the mucoid and non-mucoid type, Staphylococcus aureus, and Haemophilus influenzae were the organisms most frequently found. Absolute or good agreement was found in 73% of the culture pairs. The accuracy of the sputum cultures improved with the duration of antimicrobial treatment. The extra information gained from the endobronchial culture did not change the antimicrobial strategy from that based on the sputum culture alone. It is concluded that sputum cultures provide accurate information about the bacterial colonisation of the lower respiratory tract in patients with cystic fibrosis and therefore can be trusted both at onset of treatment and during the entire treatment period.\r"

We report 41 patients with miliary tuberculosis who had negative sputum smears and who underwent bronchoscopy, bronchial brushing, and transbronchial biopsy. In two patients the procedure was repeated. A definitive diagnosis was obtained from bronchoscopy in 34 patients (83%). Bronchial brushings yielded Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 24 of 42 bronchoscopies (57%), 13 from direct smear and a further 11 from culture only. Transbronchial biopsies were diagnostic in 30 of 41 procedures (73%), 28 from histological appearances, one from direct smear of the biopsy specimen, and another exclusively from culture. A rapid diagnosis was established in most patients (27/34), either by direct smear of brushings or biopsy specimens only (5), by histological examination only (14), or by both direct smear of brushings and biopsy specimens only (5), by histological examination only (14), or by both direct smear of brushings and histological examination (8). The diagnosis was confirmed later in a further seven patients by culture of brushings or specimens; in five of these non-caseating granulomas were initially found by histological examination. Fibreoptic bronchoscopy is a valuable technique for rapidly establishing the diagnosis of miliary tuberculosis.\r"

The correlation between areas under the plasma concentration time curves (AUC) and dose levels is linear in most species up to a dose of 50 mg/kg/d. CsA steady state plasma levels are generally 2 to 3 times higher than after single administration. Measures to reduce CsA nephrotoxicity must consider possible changes of oral bioavailability and immunosuppressive activity as shown for dmPGE2.

Toxic reaction to combined DFMO and MGBG was dose-related and included nausea, fatigue, and diarrhea especially with the higher doses of MGBG. No therapeutic responses of significance were seen, but toxicity precluded adequate evaluation. Future Phase II studies of combined DFMO and MGBG should employ low, nontoxic doses of MGBG combined with evaluation of polyamine levels and inhibition of polyamine enzymatic activity to minimize toxicity.\r"

The duration of exercise before the onset of angina and time to the onset of ischemic ST depression 30 minutes after 20 mg of oral nicorandil were compared with events 30 minutes after oral placebo and 5 minutes after 0.3 mg of sublingual nitroglycerin. Nicorandil and placebo were given according to the randomized double-blind method. Nicorandil prolonged the duration of exercise in all 11 patients by 2.3 +/- 2.2 minutes (mean +/- SD, p less than 0.01) and delayed the onset of ischemic ST depression by 2.3 +/- 1.7 minutes compared to placebo (p less than 0.01). The increment of the duration of exercise and the time to the onset of ischemic ST depression following 20 mg of oral nicorandil were almost equivalent to findings after sublingual nitroglycerin (by 2.0 +/- 1.8 and 2.5 +/- 1.7 minutes, respectively). Nicorandil also increased the pressure-rate product at the time of angina compared with placebo (20,420 +/- 480 vs 17,480 +/- 370, p less than 0.05). These results indicate that oral administration of nicorandil should be considered for the clinical treatment of effort angina.\r"

After a 4-week, single-blind, placebo washout period, 12 men and 8 women were randomized to receive 150 mg of bevantolol twice daily and 12 men and 8 women to treatment with 100 mg of atenolol once daily in a parallel, double-blind, 12-week treatment phase. Patients were assessed at weeks 2, 6 and 12 after bicycle exercise until angina or ST-segment depression greater than or equal to 0.15 mV appeared. Concentrations of cholesterol lipoproteins and 3 prostaglandin metabolites were determined. One patient receiving bevantolol was withdrawn from the study because of insufficient efficacy and 2 receiving atenolol were withdrawn because of side effects. After 2 weeks of therapy, significant decreases were seen in both groups in the number of angina attacks, mean sitting heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, mean maximum heart rate during exercise and mean double-product of systolic blood pressure and heart rate at the end of exercise. There was a trend toward significance in the increase of mean duration of exercise and total work performed with both agents, although these values were not statistically significant. Both high density lipoproteins and the ratio of high density lipoproteins to low density lipoproteins increased in the bevantolol group and decreased in the atenolol group. These changes were statistically significant at week 6.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A daily supplement of 5 mg vitamin B-6, beginning at initial interview, did not reduce prevalence of vitamin B-6 deficiency at final interview (third trimester). No association was found between EGPT indices greater than 1.25 and the outcome of pregnancy. The activity of diamine oxidase (DAO), a vitamin B-6-dependent enzyme produced by the placental decidua, was measured in maternal plasma. At initial and final interviews, plasma-DAO activity was increased by in vitro addition of pyridoxal-5'-phosphate. The activity in early pregnancy was positively associated with dietary vitamin B-6 intake and was lower in teenagers with EGPT indices greater than 1.25 at the final interview. Findings suggest that plasma-DAO activity is influenced by vitamin B-6 status.\r"

In normal liver carbohydrate antigen 19-9 was located in the biliary ductular epithelium, whereas factor VIII-related antigen was observed in the endothelium of portal veins, hepatic arteries, and central veins. This antigen was not detected in the sinusoidal endothelium. In contrasts, monoclonal antibody OKM5 was reactive with the sinusoidal endothelium but was unreactive with the endothelium of the portal blood vessels or central veins. In chronic active hepatitis and liver cirrhosis, both carbohydrate antigen 19-9 positive biliary ductular cells and factor VIII-related antigen positive endothelial cells were not only observed in the enlarged portal area but also extended into the parenchyma. They were occasionally accompanied by fibers. These findings suggest that fibrosis, ductular epithelial, and blood vascular proliferation in the portal space and their invasion into the parenchyma might gradually cause structural changes of the hepatic lobules in chronic liver disease.\r"

The EDTA test is presently the most reliable method for detecting excessive lead stores. We used the EDTA lead-mobilization test to demonstrate excessive past lead absorption as a cause of renal disease in lead workers and in both gouty and hypertensive patients with renal failure. These studies show that lead nephropathy occurs in the absence of acute intoxication and that occult poisoning often goes unrecognized because of inappropriate diagnostic criteria.\r"

  ".W": "Family studies of autoimmune diseases are consistent with multifactorial etiology. However, familial occurrence of the autoimmune trait as defined by the presence of autoimmune disease and/or high titer autoantibody supports the hypothesis that autoimmunity is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Based on genetic analysis of 18 autoimmune kindreds, the population frequency of this primary autoimmune gene is approximately .10 with penetrance estimates of 92% in females and 49% in males. The estimated high penetrance of the autoimmune gene in females suggests that the interacting genetic and/or environmental factors must be numerous or ubiquitous. Sex, age, and specific major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens are among the genetic and physiological factors known to influence autoimmunity. A genetic model is proposed that takes these factors into account. Inherent in the hypothesis of a primary autoimmune gene is that it is epistatic to other, secondary, genes that influence the autoimmune phenotype. The genetic model further postulates that the secondary genes, including those of the MHC, confer specificity to the phenotype. The effects of the secondary genes can be modulated by gonadal steroids and, over time, may be abrogated by environmental challenges, such as viral infections.\r"

Hemodynamic effects such as heart rate, blood pressure, and blood gas changes have also been studied. These evaluations have been performed in animals and in healthy and sick human subjects, following administration of ipratropium parenterally and by inhalation in a variety of dosage ranges. Ipratropium, a muscarinic inhibitor, would be expected to have effects similar to those of atropine. The most conspicuous result of these studies has been the low incidence of significant changes, even at high dose levels, when ipratropium bromide is administered by inhalation.\r"

Management of airways disease is based upon several principles: near-normal airways function should be aimed for; long-term, systemic, moderate-to-high-dose corticosteroids should be avoided if at all possible; the judicious use of polypharmacy should be undertaken whenever necessary to provide effective treatment while minimizing drug side effects; and the therapeutic program for a given individual should be tailored to that patient's specific responses to various treatments. Available pharmacologic agents have varying efficacies and adverse effects. The various agents may be used in a number of combinations.\r"

  ".U": "87073565\r", 
  ".W": "In guinea pig myometrium, beta-adrenergic receptors are functionally coupled to adenylate cyclase. beta-Adrenergic receptor agonists in the presence of guanosine triphosphate stimulate adenylate cyclase activity, thus increasing 3'5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate synthesis and promoting myometrial relaxation. In pregnant animals close to term (65 days), beta-adrenergic receptor density as well as basal and (-)isoproterenol-dependent (in the presence of guanosine triphosphate) adenylate cyclase activity is significantly higher than that in nonpregnant animals or those in early pregnancy. Since this system appears to be made up of at least three components (beta-adrenergic receptor, guanosine triphosphate-binding protein, and a catalytic component), these observations on total adenylate cyclase activity may reflect alterations in one or more of these components. To answer the question whether the catalytic unit of this system can be directly assayed and whether its activity is influenced by pregnancy, we have performed in vitro experiments to measure the enzymatic activity of the catalytic component of the beta-adrenergic receptor-adenylate cyclase complex in guinea pig myometrial membranes. We have used two compounds that stimulate the catalytic component: forskolin and manganese chloride. Forskolin, regardless of the presence or absence of guanosine triphosphate, is the most potent stimulator of adenylate cyclase activity in myometrial membranes from nonpregnant and pregnant animals; manganese chloride is a less potent activator. The degree of adenylate cyclase stimulation by forskolin tends to be higher in uteri from pregnant (greater than or equal to 0.5 gestation) than from nonpregnant or postpartum animals. It was concluded: that adenylate cyclase stimulation by forskolin does not depend on the presence of beta-adrenergic receptor agonists or guanosine triphosphate and that with advancing gestation there might be a qualitative or quantitative change with regard to the interaction between forskolin and the presumed catalytic component of the beta-adrenergic receptor-adenylate cyclase complex.\r"

Peripheral levels of testosterone and androstenedione did not change during this periovulatory time. Progesterone and 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, as anticipated, significantly increased with an early rise noted within the first 8 hours of human chorionic gonadotropin administration (p less than 0.001). A significant reduction of the ratios of the steroidal pairs 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone-progesterone (17 alpha-hydroxylase) and androstenedione-17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (17,20-desmolase) was observed after human chorionic gonadotropin injection (p less than 0.001). Aromatase activity appeared to be inhibited because of a significant reduction in the estradiol/testosterone ratio 34 to 36 hours after human chorionic gonadotropin administration. Thus human chorionic gonadotropin, which triggers ovulation in women treated by clomiphene citrate-human menopausal gonadotropin, appears to partially reduce aromatizable substrate as well as inhibit aromatase activity.\r"

Fetal intravenous administration of thyrotropin-releasing hormone resulted in behavioral arousal with electrocortical desynchronization, increased body and eye movements, rapid and deep breathing movements, and a transient bradycardia followed by prolonged tachycardia, associated with an increase in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The effects were similar following intracisternal administration of thyrotropin-releasing hormone. The effects of thyrotropin-releasing hormone on behavior, but not breathing, was abolished in the presence of muscarinic blockade.

We found a stepwise decrease in estrogen production with an increasing concentration of follicle regulatory protein (9 to 300 micrograms/ml) when the cells were stimulated by 6.25 ng/ml of ovine follicle-stimulating hormone, but the addition of a saturating dose of ovine follicle-stimulating hormone (50 ng/ml) prevented the inhibitory effect of follicle regulatory protein on estrogen production. Follicle regulatory protein inhibited progesterone production at both low and saturating levels of ovine follicle-stimulating hormone. We examined whether cholesterol substrate in the form of high-density lipoprotein or low-density lipoprotein could overcome the follicle regulatory protein inhibition of progesterone and 20 alpha-dihydroprogesterone production stimulated by follicle-stimulating hormone. At all concentrations of high-density and low-density lipoprotein, 75 micrograms/ml of follicle regulatory protein inhibited progesterone production by 80% to 90%. In the case of 20 alpha-dihydroprogesterone, the presence of high-density and low-density lipoprotein accentuated the inhibitory effect of follicle regulatory protein. These results demonstrate that the effects of follicle regulatory protein on ovarian steroidogenesis depend on: the concentration of gonadotropin, the concentration of follicle regulatory protein, and the availability of cholesterol substrate.\r"

Serum testosterone increased from 0.24 +/- 0.08 to steady-state levels of 1.63 +/- 0.18 ng/ml in the lowest-dose group (1) and to 42.1 +/- 3.3 ng/ml in the highest-dose group (4). In another group (5), patients were pretreated with testolactone, which prevented the estradiol rise associated with testosterone infusion. All groups except group 1 exhibited significant reductions in the delta maximum responses of luteinizing hormone to gonadotropin-releasing hormone during testosterone infusion compared with pretreatment levels (p less than 0.01). This was also evident for the testolactone group (5). There were no observed changes in serum follicle-stimulating hormone. Luteinizing hormone pulse frequency was decreased (p less than 0.05) with testosterone concentrations of 27.2 +/- 0.77 and 42.1 +/- 3.3 ng/ml (groups 3 and 4), but only in the highest group (4) was there a decrease in pulse amplitude (p less than 0.05). No luteinizing hormone pulse changes were observed with lower concentrations of testosterone. Plasma immunoreactive gonadotropin-releasing hormone levels remained undetectable or low in some of the groups sampled. These data suggest that short-term infusions of testosterone inhibit hypothalamic-pituitary function of normal women when high doses are used, and this effect may be independent of aromatization to estrogen.\r"

Amnion cells were incubated with carbon 14-labeled arachidonic acid, and after various times the distribution of radiolabeled arachidonic acid in the lipids of these cells were determined. After incubation for 72 hours, 91% of the total radiolabeled arachidonic acid incorporated into cellular lipids was present in glycerophospholipids, and 9% was present in neutral lipids. The formation of [14C]prostaglandin E2 from [14C]arachidonic acid was maximal after 8 hours. In these studies the effect of human fetal urine on arachidonic acid metabolism in these cells was investigated (the production of prostaglandin E2 by amnion cells is increased by treatment with fetal urine). In cells incubated with [14C]arachidonic acid in the incubation medium, treatment with fetal urine for 4 hours caused a threefold to fourfold increase in [14C]prostaglandin E2 production, yet there were no detectable differences in the content of [14C]arachidonic acid in specific glycerophospholipids or neutral lipids of the cells after such treatment. In other studies, amnion cells were preincubated for 72 hours with [14C]arachidonic acid, and thereafter the cells were treated with fetal urine for 24 hours. With fetal urine treatment the amount of [14C]arachidonic acid in triacylglycerols decreased significantly compared with that in nontreated cells, but the formation of [14C]prostaglandin E2 was not increased. Thus we suggest that in response to fetal urine, prostaglandin E2 is formed from arachidonic acid that is released from a highly specific, stimulus-sensitive lipid pool or else from arachidonic acid that is derived from extracellular sources.\r"

The ensuing osmotic change, caused by sorbitol accumulation, adversely affects the lens permeability barrier so that the distribution within the lens of electrolytes, amino acids, and myo-inositol becomes grossly altered. These changes affect lens viability resulting in opacification. That aldose reductase triggers the process is shown by the fact that several structurally unrelated aldose reductase inhibitors prevent cataracts from occurring. Aldose reductase is also implicated in diabetic retinopathy and keratopathy. Aldose reductase functions in the retinal capillary pericytes, the cells first affected in microvascular abnormalities in diabetes. Additionally, retinal capillary basement membrane thickening can be prevented by aldose reductase inhibitors. Clinical trials are underway to determine the efficacy and safety of aldose reductase inhibitors in treatment of diabetic retinopathy.\r"

A recent study reported from the authors' laboratory demonstrated that significant numbers of MT rings could be isolated from resting platelets by simultaneous exposure to detergent and a small amount of fixative. This method has been used in the present investigation to determine the number of MT coils obtained from platelets after activation by ADP, thrombin, and the calcium ionophore, A23187. Concentrations of the agonists that caused shape change and internal transformation in parallel samples did not influence the frequency of MT rings present in activated samples after treatment with fixative and detergent. As many or more MT coils were present 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 seconds after addition of an agonist as from the control. Statistical analysis revealed no significant difference between the number of isolated coils from controls and activated platelets at any time during early activation. Immunofluorescence microscopic examination of platelets stained with a monoclonal antibody to tubulin at intervals of 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 seconds after activation on glass surfaces confirmed the suggestion that platelet MTs are resistant to disassembly during the early response to stimulation.\r"

Sixty schoolchildren of the second endemic village with urinary egg counts greater than or equal to 100 eggs/10 ml of urine were examined by ultrasonography. The overall prevalence and the severity of bladder lesions in the 2 endemic villages were significantly related to the urinary egg count.\r"

  ".W": "Normal and passively immunized Fischer rats were infected with 75Se-selenomethionine-labeled cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni. Migration of the parasites from skin to lungs to liver was monitored by autoradiographic analyses of these sites. Labeled parasites migrated from skin to lungs with high efficiency in normal and immune rats; disappearance of labeled parasites from the lungs was slower in immune rats. Labeled parasites accumulated in the liver, reaching maximal values by 11 days post-infection in both groups and remaining constant through day 21. Half the number of labeled parasites were detected in the liver of immune rats. The total number of labeled parasites detected in the skin, lungs, and liver was constant through day 5, then declined to about 60% of this value by day 11 in both groups. Over the next 10 days, the rate of decline decreased significantly in normal rats but did not change in immune rats. By day 21 post-infection, nearly 50% fewer labeled parasites were detectable in immune rats. We conclude that a subpopulation of parasites in the lungs is the target of protective antibody in the serum used for passive immunization. Target parasites, retained longer in the lungs, were probably prevented from migrating successfully to the liver. Another parasite subpopulation migrated to the liver with normal kinetics. Lung schistosomula isolated from normal and passively immunized rats were transferred by intravenous injection into recipient rats and their continued migration from lungs to liver compared. No differences in portal perfusion worm yields were detected in normal recipients; equally reduced yields were detected in passively immunized recipients. We conclude that the effects of antibodies during week 1 post-infection were insignificant or reversible.\r"

Proliferation of these cells was examined in coculture experiments with syngeneic inflammatory cells. T cell-enriched mononuclear cells from spleens of S. mansoni-infected or normal mice, and Kupffer cell/macrophages from fibrotic liver all stimulated the proliferation of liver fibroblasts, as measured by 3H-thymidine uptake. Primary cultures of mouse skin fibroblasts showed similar responses to coculture, but an established fibroblast line, 3T3, was unresponsive. Cell-free supernatant medium from coculture experiments did not affect fibroblast proliferation, perhaps because of the requirement for serum in the culture medium. Liver fibroblasts derived from this disease model may be especially suitable for study of the interaction between tissue inflammation and fibrosis.\r"

Eosinophilotactic activity in the serum was dependent on the dose and time of infection. Eosinophilotactic activity in sera from S. japonicum-infected mice was higher than that from S. mansoni-infected mice when they were compared at the comparable dose and time of infection. After gel chromatography on Sephadex G-200, eosinophilotactic activity in sera from mice infected with 30 cercariae of S. japonicum for 5 weeks was detected in the high molecular weight component. On the other hand, when sera from mice infected with 30 cercariae of S. japonicum for 8 weeks was chromatographed through Sephadex G-200 columns, eosinophilotactic activity was segregated into high (greater than 455,000) and low (less than 13,000) molecular weight components. High molecular weight ECF in sera from mice infected with 30 cercariae of S. japonicum for 8 weeks had high affinity to Con A, and was stable to heating or pronase digestion, but was sensitive to periodate oxidation, indicating its polysaccharide or glycoprotein nature. This high molecular weight ECF could be adsorbed by, and eluted from immunoaffinity beads coated with rabbit IgG anti-S. japonicum adult worm antibody. Thus, at least some part of circulating high molecular weight ECF would be derived from adult parasites.\r"

The sera from 15 infected patients before and 2 years after treatment with oxamniquine (n = 30) recognized bands ranging in molecular weight from 9 to 200 Kd. A 31 Kd component of SmSEA was recognized by all infection sera, but not by normal human serum. The sera from 2 humans infected with S. haematobium and 2 with S. japonicum also recognized the 31 Kd band present in SmSEA, whereas those from 2 humans infected with Fasciola hepatica did not. The 31 Kd antigen was isolated by electrophoresing SmSEA through a 15% SDS-acrylamide gel, followed by excision and electroelution of the 31 Kd band. The purified 31 Kd was used in conjunction with ELISA at a concentration of 1 microgram/ml to confirm the apparent genus specificity of this protein. Thus, the sera of patients infected with S. mansoni, S. haematobium, or S. japonicum were clearly reactive in ELISA, whereas normal human serum or sera from patients with F. hepatica were negative. In conclusion, the 31 Kd protein appears to be a good candidate for developing a screening assay for the immunodiagnosis of schistosomiasis.\r"

  ".W": "Six isolates of a new phlebotomus fever serogroup virus, designated Arboledas virus, were obtained from sand flies (Lutzomyia spp.) collected in northeastern Colombia. One of the isolates was made from a pool of male sand flies. By immunofluorescence, Arboledas virus is related to Caimito and Pacui viruses; by neutralization test, it is distinct. Arboledas virus neutralizing antibodies were found in the sera of opossums (Didelphis marsupialis) and humans living in the study area. D. marsupialis inoculated with the virus developed a viremia of four days' duration, and sand flies (Lutzomyia gomezi) feeding on a viremic opossum were readily infected. Transovarial transmission of Arboledas virus was also demonstrated in experimentally infected Lu. gomezi. Results of the above laboratory studies suggest that Arboledas virus is maintained in nature by two mechanisms: vertical (transovarial) transmission in the insect vector, and an alternating marsupial-sand fly cycle. The implications of this complex maintenance cycle for other phleboviruses are discussed.\r"

This brief study describes a method to control pain in 10 patients with unresectable rectal cancer confined to the pelvis after standard therapy failed. All of the patients had percutaneous placement of infusion catheters in both internal iliac arteries. A continuous intraarterial infusion of 800 mg/m2 of 5-fluorouracil per day was given for 7 days and 10 mg/m2 of mitomycin C was administered as a bolus injection on the seventh day only. Four patients also received whole body hyperthermia by way of a Erbotherm 434 mHz microwave generator on the second and fifth days of infusion. Relief of pain occurred in three of the six patients who received intraarterial chemotherapy only. All four patients who also received hyperthermia achieved prolonged pain relief when it was added. We have concluded that intraarterial chemotherapy may be beneficial in patients with uncontrolled pelvic pain due to recurrent rectal cancer. The addition of hyperthermia may augment the benefit.\r"

A slight positive correlation between total dose of Ro 15-1788 and total amount of midazolam was found. Nausea and/or vomiting were found to be more frequent in the Ro 15-1788 group, but otherwise we found no differences between groups with regard to either side effects or cardiorespiratory function. Ro 15-1788 is evidently an effective antagonist to the sedation induced by midazolam.\r"

The rise in arterial pressure persisted for up to 4 minutes in the control group, but lasted for only one minute in the nitroglycerine group. The pulse rate, however, increased in both groups to an equal extent.

After tracheal intubation, the expiratory breath sounds were heard to be intermittent. The expiratory flow pattern showed irregularities synchronous with the electrocardiogram. With constant flow inflation, the inspiratory pressure profile was suggestive of mechanical obstruction with a resistance which decreased during inspiration. The airway deadspace was greatly reduced, suggesting that the obstruction was near the tracheal tube opening and that there was pooling of carbon dioxide behind this obstruction. The alveolar deadspace fraction was increased and the shape of the carbon dioxide single breath test suggested severe airway obstruction. These findings can be explained on the basis of large airway obstruction, partly intermittent because of the heart's movement, and also reduced lung volume and uneven gas distribution caused by the tumour and pleural fluid.\r"

Transient hypotension and bradycardia occurred in some patients who received the highest dose of alfentanil. The incidence of postoperative sequelae was small in all groups. Thus, the optimal dose of alfentanil in an anaesthetic technique for penetrating eye injuries appears to be 20 micrograms/kg.\r"

The onset and the duration of analgesia were 30 +/- 12 min and 19.5 +/- 8 h, respectively (mean +/- SD). Side effects were pruritus (4/20), nausea and vomiting (8/20), and urinary retention (4/14). No apnea was observed. Ventilation control was studied in seven children. No significant change in resting respiratory variables occurred after both surgery and epidural morphine injection. However, the slope of the ventilatory response to CO2 was significantly (P less than 0.05) decreased after surgery but before morphine, as compared with its preoperative control value (0.84 +/- 0.44 versus 1.51 +/- 0.72 l X min-1 X mmHg-1), and remained low for 22 h after epidural morphine (0.90 +/- 0.57 l X min-1 X mmHg-1). Sixty minutes after morphine injection, the plasma morphine concentration was always less than 12 ng X ml-1 in the seven children studied. Pharmacokinetic parameters were similar to those observed after epidural injection of morphine in adults, except for a shorter terminal half-life (73.8 +/- 41.6 min) attributed to a greater total body clearance of morphine in the children (28.3 +/- 3.4 ml X min-1 X kg-1). It is concluded that epidural morphine provides effective and prolonged analgesia in children after abdominal and urologic surgery and that it is associated with prolonged respiratory depression that requires close monitoring for at least 24 h.\r"

While hypocapnia during ISF-induced hypotension causes a further reduction of CBF, the effects on cerebral energy stores and metabolites produced by combining hypocapnia with ISF-induced hypotension are not known. This study examined the effect of hypocapnia (PaCO2 = 20 mmHg) on CMRO2, the electroencephalogram (EEG), and levels of adenine nucleotides, phosphocreatine, lactate, pyruvate, and glucose in brain tissue in 12 dogs during ISF-induced hypotension. All dogs were examined at: normocapnia with normotension; hypocapnia with normotension; hypocapnia combined with ISF-induced hypotension to cerebral perfusion pressures of 60, 50, and 40 mmHg; and restoration of normocapnia with normotension. In six dogs CMRO2 was determined, and the EEG was evaluated using compressed spectral analysis. In the other six dogs brain tissue metabolites were determined. Hypocapnia combined with ISF-induced hypotension (all levels) caused a decrease of the power of the beta-2 spectra, an increase of the power of the alpha and beta-1 spectra, but no change in total power of the EEG. There was no change in cerebral energy stores or brain tissue metabolites. CMRO2 was reduced by approximately 27%. Thirty minutes after restoration of normocapnia with normotension, cerebral metabolites remained unchanged and CMRO2, and the power of the alpha, beta-1, and beta-2 spectra of the EEG returned to control values. These results suggest no adverse effect on cerebral metabolism or function during hypocapnia combined with ISF-induced hypotension.\r"

The maximum depression occurred less than 3 h after IT injection of either agent and lasted as long as 12 h. The depression was totally reversed by naloxone (0.4 mg/kg, iv). Naloxone alone had no effect on ventilatory function. After 10 mg DADL, there was no significant change in heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP), cardiac output (CO), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), or PaO2 during the 3 h postinjection. In contrast, PaCO2 was significantly elevated and pH significantly decreased (P less than 0.05). Naloxone administration after high-dose IT DADL resulted in a doubling of MABP, MPBP, CO, and SVR that lasted approximately 20 min. In concurrently measured cisternal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels, both morphine and DADL displayed peak levels by 30-60 min. The lumbar CSF clearance curves for both agents were fitted with a two-compartment intravenous bolus model. The t 1/2 alpha was 13.8 +/- 3.6 min for DADL and 9.4 +/- 1.6 min for morphine (mean +/- SE).

NTG produced dilatation of all digital vessels, reflected especially by increases in total digital volume. NTG produced marked changes in the dicrotic notch of the pulse wave, noted also in inflow volume curves but not in outflow volume curves. The dicrotic notch was displaced later on the descending limb of the digital pulse wave and became deeper and more prominent after NTG. It is suggested that NTG produces disproportionate dilatation of the arterial system, having its greatest effect on arteries near the heart, including the coronaries and great vessels branching off the aorta, and on left intraventricular cavity pressure. This greater regional vasodilatation of vessels near the heart could delay closure of the aortic valve, producing a delayed and prominent dicrotic notch of the pulse wave.\r"

The severity of the eczema and the changes in severity as a result of diet or challenge were measured both by the clinician (using body diagrams) and by parents (using a daily diary card). Analysis of the clinician's scoring and the patient's diary card scores demonstrated a statistically significant difference in favour of SCG, especially in the group where the placebo preceded the active treatment. Sodium cromoglycate does seem to reduce the exacerbations of atopic dermatitis caused by food allergens.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was designed to assess differences in compartmental contributions to ventilation between cycle pedaling and treadmill walking. Eight subjects performed submaximal cycle (CE) and treadmill (TM) exercise. The mean maximal work loads were not significantly different between the 2 modes of exercise. Ventilation (VE), oxygen uptake (VO2), and respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP) were measured continuously during both modes of exercise. During both TM and CE, VE measured by RIP was found to correlate significantly with VE measured by pneumotachometer. Although the ventilation/work load relationship for CE exceeded that for TM in all subjects, when changes in rib cage (RC) and abdominal (ABD) tidal volume responses were expressed relative to changes in VE, no significant differences were found between TM and CE (RC, p greater than 0.05; ABD, p greater than 0.05). When these changes in tidal volume were expressed relative to changes in work load and independent of ventilation, there were no significant differences between separate compartmental responses during TM or CE (RC, p greater than 0.05; ABD, p greater than 0.05). We conclude that while absolute degrees of ventilation at a given work load differ between cycling and walking, the postural and ventilatory differences between these forms of exercise do not appear to induce differences in the relative contributions of the rib cage or the abdomen to tidal breathing.\r"

Exercise led to a significant fall in the arterial PO2 from 76 +/- 10 to 63 +/- 8 mm Hg, a rise in the arterial PCO2 from 56 +/- 6 to 62 +/- 8 mm Hg, and a fall in the mixed venous PO2 from 38 +/- 2 to 32 +/- 2 mm Hg. There was, however, no significant change in the degree of ventilation-perfusion inequality as quantified by the multiple inert gas technique and no evidence that impaired O2 diffusion was playing a role in the increased hypoxemia. We conclude that the worsening hypoxemia with exercise in patients with severe COPD is due to an inadequate ventilatory response (leading to a rise in arterial PCO2) and the impact of a decreased mixed venous PO2 on the end-capillary PO2 of low VA/Q lung units and shunt.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the role of leukotrienes and cyclooxygenase products in endotoxin-induced pulmonary vascular and airway changes. In 11 conscious sheep, measurements of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), lung resistance (RL), arterial PO2, leukocyte count (WBC), and plasma thromboxane B2 (TxB2), 6-keto-PgF1 alpha and PgF2 alpha were obtained, before and at predetermined intervals after a 10-min infusion of E. coli endotoxin (0.3 microgram/kg). On a separate occasion, 5 sheep received an infusion of the leukotriene end-organ receptor antagonist FPL-57231 (0.7 to 1 mg/kg/min), before and for as long as 4 h after endotoxin infusion; and 6 sheep received a single injection of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (2 mg/kg) 1 h before endotoxin infusion. Endotoxin caused a biphasic response with an increase in mean PVR and RL to 441 and 353% of baseline, respectively, during the early phase (0 to 1 hr), and lesser increases to 168 and 195% of baseline during the late phase (1.5 to 4 h). These changes were associated with mild hypoxemia, marked leukopenia, and marked increases in plasma TxB2, 6-keto-PgF1 alpha and PgF2 alpha. The FPL-57231 completely blocked the endotoxin-induced changes in PVR, RL, and PaO2 during both phases without preventing the increases in TxB2; however, it partly attenuated the increases in 6-keto-PgF1 alpha and enhanced the generation of PgF2 alpha. Indomethacin, which blocked the endotoxin-induced increases in TxB2, 6-keto-PgF1 alpha, PgF2 alpha, and RL, only partly blocked the increase in PVR during the early phase, followed by an exaggerated increase of PVR during the late phase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of increasing concentrations of tannin isolated from cotton bracts and endotoxin prepared from Enterobacter agglomerans on the electrophysiologic and ion transport properties of the canine tracheal epithelium mounted in Ussing chambers were examined. Results were compared with those obtained using cotton bracts extract (CBE). Tannin concentrations in the isolated tannin and in the cotton bracts were analyzed spectrophotometrically. When added to the mucosal bathing solution, tannin produced a significant decrease in transepithelial potential difference and short-circuit current (lsc) with a maximal response at 25 microliter. The decrease in lsc was accounted for entirely by a decrease in net chloride secretion. The effects were reversible and specific for the mucosal bathing solution. In contrast to CBE, tannin had no effect on mannitol flux, suggesting no effect on the paracellular pathway. Endotoxin at a concentration of 10 micrograms/ml had no effect on the electrophysiologic properties of the canine trachea. We conclude that tannin in CBE is responsible for the decrease in lsc observed with aqueous extracts of CBE but is not responsible for the changes in the paracellular pathway. We also conclude that endotoxin alone has no effect on the airway epithelium.\r"

A new packaging system dispenses assayed aliquots of stimulated cryoprecipitate in plastic vials. The direct cost of production for this material is $.065 per unit.

All 51 patients were followed for at least 3 years unless they died, and 27 were followed for 5 years. The tumors treated were superficial, accessible lesions without bone involvement or clinically apparent metastases. Eighteen patients had had irradiation or surgery at the same site, so were having salvage CO2 laser surgery. Indications and technique are discussed. Local recurrence and disease control rates were comparable to those of conventional local surgical excision at 3 and 5 years. Complication rate was low. Carbon dioxide laser resection with microscopic control is, we propose, an excellent modality for transoral excision of carefully selected lesions, and it offers increased precision, better visualization, minimal bleeding, and decreased postoperative morbidity compared to other surgical techniques.\r"

The essential feature of this combination is the synchronous administration of pulses of VBM and fractionated doses of external radiotherapy in order to achieve potentiation of radiotherapy. On average, four to five pulses of VBM were given. Severe mucositis is the main problem during treatment. Two patients needed nasogastric tube feeding, and treatment was carried out as an inpatient procedure. Five patients are alive with complete local remission at 7 years, 3 years, 2 1/2 years, 14 months, and 8 months after treatment. These results appear to be spectacular, even though the number of patients is small. Of the three patients who died, only one had recurrent disease around the tracheostoma. The two other patients were free of disease in the neck when they died 6 and 16 months after treatment of, respectively, lung metastases and a second primary tumor in the lung. Patients with stomal recurrence after total laryngectomy are now routinely treated with synchronous VBM and radiotherapy.\r"

The new drug inhibited all staphylococcal isolates, including methicillin-resistant strains, at concentrations of less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml. The activity of LY 146032 was comparable to that of vancomycin against most streptococci, but the latter demonstrated greater potency against Streptococcus faecium and penicillin-resistant strains of pneumococci and viridans group streptococci. LY 146032 was markedly less active than vancomycin against Listeria monocytogenes (MICs for 90% of strains tested, 16 and 1.0 microgram/ml, respectively). The activity of LY 146032 was enhanced as the concentration of calcium in the test medium was increased. MBCs were within eightfold of the MIC for each of 12 strains tested. In a rat model of enterococcal endocarditis, the administration of LY 146032 resulted in increased survival and a reduction in the bacterial titer within cardiac vegetations compared with untreated control animals.\r"

All antimicrobial compounds except imipenem demonstrated truncation in the vicinity of CA. We also evaluated the extent to which chromosomal beta-lactamase is induced by CA and found this to occur to some degree in most isolates and to be dependent on the concentration of CA. Finally, we performed time kill curves on these isolates to compare bacterial growth in ticarcillin alone with growth in ticarcillin-CA (the CA at 2 or 4 micrograms/ml). We found that CA at this concentration has neither an antagonistic nor a synergistic antibacterial effect in combination with ticarcillin.\r"

Two quinolones, difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620, and an oral cephalosporin, cefixime (CL 284,635; FK 027), were evaluated in vitro. All three were highly active against 400 isolates of N. gonorrhoeae, including penicillinase-producing N. gonorrhoeae, N. gonorrhoeae with chromosomally mediated resistance, and isolates with penicillin MICs of less than 1 microgram/ml. Susceptibilities to one antimicrobial agent were usually strongly correlated with susceptibilities to the other antimicrobial agents evaluated, but isolates with increasing resistance to beta-lactams were least likely to show increasing resistance to quinolones. Difloxacin and, to a lesser extent, A-56620 were active against all 10 strains of C. trachomatis, and both had moderate activity against over 200 strains of Gardnerella vaginalis. Based on in vitro activity, difloxacin and A-56620 merit in vivo assessment for management of both C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae infections, and cefixime shows considerable promise for treatment of N. gonorrhoeae infections.\r"

There was no evidence of growth retardation on entry into the study. Growth developed along normal lines in all 66 children until about 10 years, and in 35 of these children growth continued along normal lines throughout the whole period of follow up. Thirty children showed the physiological decelerating growth velocity pattern seen in children with delay in the onset of puberty, and one child had an early menarche. The tendency for delay in the onset of puberty was significant for both boys and girls and was noted to be independent of severity of asthma. Once puberty finally began in these children, complete catch up growth resulted in the attainment of the predicted adult height. Long term prophylactic inhalation of beclomethasone dipropionate in 26 children in a dosage up to 600 mcg/day before puberty and 400 mcg/day during puberty was shown not to affect growth. It is concluded that asthma had no direct influence on growth in height but was associated with delay in the onset of puberty. The pre-adolescent physiological deceleration of growth velocity that occurs in these children gives the impression of growth retardation.\r"

Longitudinal studies showed that raised titres were observed at a very early stage of infection. High titres were associated with a poor clinical state, while low titres were associated with a better clinical state in both chronic and intermittently infected patients with cystic fibrosis.

  ".W": "This study examined oxidative metabolism and thermogenesis in the acute response to controlled intravenous nutrition in seven cancer patients who lost weight. Six weight-losing and malnourished patients without cancer served as controls. Indirect calorimetry was used and measurements of arterial concentrations of various substrates, metabolic end products, and insulin were performed. Resting energy expenditure (REE) was measured after an overnight fast. The resting energy need was calculated for each patient according to REE. The nutrition program consisted of glucose and lipids (Intralipid KabiVitrum AB, Stockholm, Sweden) each as 50% of nonprotein calories and amino acids (6.9 mg N/kcal). These substrates were infused simultaneously at rates equivalent to one, two, and three times REE, over periods of 6.5 hours on 3 consecutive days after a 12-hour fast. Arterial substrate levels and energy expenditure were measured between 6 and 6.5 hours after the start of the infusion. The cancer patients had well-recognized metabolic changes in the fasted state, such as elevated plasma levels of glycerol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, and lactate, and higher energy expenditure than predicted. The cancer patients responded to strictly defined substrate challenge in a similar way as the malnourished patients without cancer. Whole body oxidative capacity and the proportion of infused glucose and lipids that were oxidized at different levels of infusion rates were not decreased in cancer patients compared with control patients. Similar arterial substrate concentrations among the groups during infusions argues for a maintained plasma clearance of the substrate in the cancer patients. This study supports the suggestion that cachectic cancer patients can generate and conserve energy normally in response to intravenous nutrition. This refers to cancer patients with a history of weight loss up to 15% of their normal body weight. Therefore, weight loss due to altered tumor-host metabolism in cancer patients is of quantitative importance in the fasted state rather than in the fed state.\r"

  ".W": "Rates of glucose turnover and oxidation in normal volunteers (N = 16) and in severely ill patients with pancreatitis (N = 9) were isotopically determined. Glucose turnover was determined using primed constant infusions of either 6-3H-glucose or 6-d2-glucose, and glucose oxidation with either U-14C-glucose or U-13C-glucose after appropriate priming of the bicarbonate pool. Urea kinetics were determined using primed constant infusions of either (15N2)-urea or U-14C-urea, whereas free fatty acid (FFA) kinetics were determined by the constant infusion of 1,2-13C palmitate. Basal rates of glucose production and plasma glucose clearance were significantly higher in the patients than in the volunteers. During glucose infusion (4 mg/kg/min) endogenous glucose production was virtually totally suppressed in the volunteers (94 +/- 4%). There was significantly less suppression in the patients, however (44 +/- 1%). In addition, the percentage of available glucose oxidized (i.e., percentage of uptake oxidized) was significantly less in the patients than in the volunteers. The basal rate of urea production was significantly higher in the patients; however, in both patients and volunteers, glucose infusion resulted in a significant decrease. The rate of FFA turnover was similar in the patients and volunteers, and the patients and volunteers were equally sensitive to the suppressive effects of glucose infusion. When the patients were studied during total parenteral nutrition (TPN), there was no further suppression of endogenous glucose turnover than that seen during 2 hours of glucose infusion, and the mean rate of urea turnover measured during TPN (7.0 +/- 1.9 mumol/kg/min) was also not significantly different than the value determined during glucose infusion (8.9 +/- 1.8 mumol/kg/min). It was concluded from these studies that patients with pancreatitis are metabolically similar to septic patients, have an impairment in their ability to oxidize infused glucose when compared with normal volunteers, have an elevated rate of net protein catabolism, and have FFA kinetics similar to those seen in normal humans.\r"

  ".W": "Timing of coronary artery bypass grafting after acute myocardial infarction (MI) is controversial, especially if myocardial function is depressed. Early coronary artery bypass grafting may result in reperfusion injury causing cardiac failure. Delay, however, may risk a second ischemic event. This study was performed to determine if four preoperative factors--time after MI, ejection fraction, ischemia (need for intravenous administration of nitroglycerin), and failure (need for inotropic support)--independently predict postoperative cardiac failure. Postoperative failure was defined as the need for inotropic support or intraaortic balloon pumping. The study group consisted of 145 patients who underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting between January, 1980, and July, 1985, within 4 weeks of an acute MI. Postoperatively 38 patients (26%) had cardiac failure. Five patients, all of whom had postoperative cardiac failure, died. Univariate and stepwise logistic regression analyses showed preoperative failure (p = .0001), ejection fraction less than 45% (p = .002), and preoperative ischemia (p = .02) were predictors of postoperative cardiac failure. Time after MI was not found to be an independent predictor (p = .96). We conclude that if ischemia or threatening coronary anatomy is present early after MI and clinical improvement is not occurring, operative intervention should be strongly considered at that time, as it does not appear that delay itself reduces the risk of cardiac failure and may risk a second ischemic event.\r"

We used 5% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), 1% and 4% methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), 0.3% N-methylformamide (NMF), and retinol acetate (RA) in the chemoprevention of rat mammary breast cancer. One hundred fifty 42-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into six groups (control, RA, DMSO, 1% MSM, NMF, and 4% MSM) and received chemopreventive agents along with standard rat chow ad libitum. Eight days later, 15 mg of 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene was given by oral gastric intubation. The animals were examined weekly for tumor incidence and size (biplanar analysis). Animals were followed up for 240 to 300 days. Tumor incidence was not statistically affected. Time to appearance (latency period) of both tumors and cancers were prolonged by NMF, DMSO, and 4% MSM. Doubling times of all cancers produced were prolonged by DMSO and RA. No group exhibited toxic reactions or significant weight loss. Polar solvents and differentiating agents, specifically NMF, DMSO, and 4% MSM, were effective in the chemoprevention of dimethylbenzanthracene-induced mammary cancers.\r"

In the absence of valproate the unbound fraction of thiopentone was 15.2 +/- 0.64%, but with concentrations of valproic acid in excess of the therapeutic range, it increased to 22.42 +/- 1.65%. Scatchard plots for thiopentone in the absence and presence of valproate were investigated also. The barbiturate was bound by one group of binding sites with the association constant, Ka = 2.81 X 10(3) litre mol-1 and the number of binding sites (n) = 2.3. There was a marked decrease in this association constant in the presence of valproic acid (Ka = 1.82 X 10(3) litre mol-1), but without significant change in the number of binding sites (n = 2.13). Additionally, the effect of administration of sodium valproate i.v. on thiopentone anaesthesia was examined in rabbits. The recovery time from thiopentone was markedly longer in the presence of the anticonvulsant drug (17.0 min v. 37.1 min).\r"
