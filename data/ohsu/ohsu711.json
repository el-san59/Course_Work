  ".W": "We report missense mutations associated with haplotype 1 and haplotype 4 alleles of the human phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. Individual exon-containing regions were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from genomic DNA of a PKU patient who was a haplotype 1/4 compound heterozygote. The amplified DNA fragments were subcloned into M13 for sequence analysis. Missense mutations were observed in exons 5 and 7, resulting in the substitution of Arg by Gln at residues 158 and 261 of the enzyme, respectively. Expression analysis in heterozygous mammalian cells after site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the Arg158-to-Gln158 mutation is a PKU mutation, whereas the Arg261-to-Gln261 mutation is apparently silent in the assay system. Hybridization analysis using allele-specific oligonucleotide probes demonstrated that the Arg158-to-Gln158 mutation is present in two of six mutant haplotype 4 alleles among the Swiss and constitutes about 40% of all mutant haplotype 4 alleles in the European population. The mutation is not present in normal alleles or in any mutant alleles of other haplotypes. The results provide conclusive evidence that there is linkage disequilibrium between mutation and haplotype in the PAH gene and that multiple mutations have occurred in the PAH gene of a prevalent haplotype among Caucasians.\r"

In 1987, two surveys obtained data on each state's legal requirements for obtaining genetic information and on what each public adoption agency collected as genetic history. These results were presented in a poster at the 1987 ASHG annual meeting in San Diego. In 1988, a questionnaire was sent to the same agencies to elicit opinions as to whether adoption agencies should systematically collect genetic information to share with the adoptive family and adoptee, whether legislation should be mandated to collect such information, and whether genetic education programs should be developed and implemented for adoption-agency staff. On the basis of responses to the 1988 questionnaire, it was concluded that there is an interest in developing a uniform set of genetic information which should be part of a child's adoption record and that there is a need for genetic education programs for adoption workers. Responses to the desirability of mandating legislation for this purpose were less consistent.\r"

The order established is 5pter----MLVI-2----cen----HEXB----DHFR----Pi227- --- cp12.6----(IL5,IL4)----IL3----GMCSF---- FGFA---- (CSF1R,PDGFR)----(treC,ADRBR)----(ARH-H9,CSF1 )----qter. The suggested order and orientation for the closely linked IL3/GMCSF gene pair is cen----5' IL3 3'----5' GMCSF 3'----qter, on the basis of analysis of the GMCSF rearrangement in HL60 DNA. The map position of the GRL locus, which was consistent with both somatic cell hybrid and 5q- analyses, was telomeric to GMCSF and centromeric to CSF1R/PDGFR, near FGFA. Long-range restriction-enzyme analysis of 5q- DNAs did not detect rearrangements of 5q-linked probes except in HL60 DNA, but it did reveal putative long-range RFLPs of several loci. RFLPs for GRL, Pi227, cp12.6, IL3, and CSF1R can detect deletions in bone marrow and in leukemia cells from patients with acquired 5q deletions.\r"

After correction for skewness, evidence in favor of two commingled distributions was found for SBP in the combined data (parents and offspring) and in parents, but not in offspring. Segregation analysis (using the computer program POINTER) suggested that a multifactorial contribution to all three phenotypes was greater in offspring than in parents, which could be the result of either polygenic or shared environmental components relevant to sibships, or both. Statistical evidence was found for a major effect on SBP. However, Mendelian transmission of the major effect was rejected, and no transmission of the major effect (equal tau's) was not. This is just the opposite to what would be expected if the major effect was due to a major gene, and it would ordinarily be considered as sufficient evidence to refute a major gene effect on SBP. However, the commingling in parents but not in offspring (who are all below 26 years of age), and the finding of equal transmission probabilities (nearly equal to 1), are compatible with an alternative interpretation. It is possible that there is a real major gene effect on SBP but that the genotype for elevated SBP has not yet expressed itself in the offspring as they have not yet gone through the risk period. Accordingly, this possibility needs to be evaluated further in additional studies involving older offspring.\r"

In genetically isolated populations such as Finland, it is further possible to use this approach to test the hypothesis of a single mutation enriched in this population demonstrating an exceptionally low prevalence of HD. In this study covering 70% of all diagnosed HD cases in Finland, linkage disequilibrium of RFLP haplotypes of D4S10 and D4S43 loci polymorphisms was found. This phenomenon, not so far reported in any other population, could support the hypothesis of one ancestor HD mutation in the Finnish population. Despite the lower heterozygosity obtained with some RFLP markers, the proportion of individuals receiving informative DNA test results did not significantly differ from that reported in more mixed populations. In one HD family we established a recombination event between HD and the D4S43 locus, an event which can be highly useful in the more precise mapping of the HD gene.\r"

  ".W": "There is evidence that Amerindians have continuously occupied the lower Central American Isthmus for as long as 10,000 years. There remains some doubt about the relationships of these original colonizers to the resident peoples of this zone at the time of European contact (approximately A.D. 1500). We present new genetic data for up to 48 genetic loci for 570 members of six Chibcha-speaking tribes of lower Central America--the Boruca, Bribri, Cabecar, and Guatuso of Costa Rica and the Kuna and Teribe of Panama--and delineate the genetic affinities among the various groups (these six tribes and the Guaymi and Bokota) of lower Central America. We convert standard genetic distance metrics into a form that is linear with the effective time since divergence, and we compare the genetic distances with linguistic distances for the same groups (r = .74, P less than .001). Geographic affinity accounts for some of the genetic divergence among groups (r = .49, P less than .084) and for some of the linguistic divergence (r = .53, P less than .037), but the correspondence between geographic position and taxonomic affinity is not high. We combine all of the genetic and linguistic data to construct a synthetic overview taxonomy of the lower Central American Chibcha. Both the genetic and linguistic data exhibit hierarchical organization of tribal groups, showing a general east-to-west pattern of grouping, with greater affinities between close neighbors. The presence of private genetic variants of some antiquity within the region and their absence outside the zone, coupled with the essential absence of the DI*A polymorphism of mongoloid origin that is widespread outside the zone, argue for a relatively isolated development of the Central American Chibcha. Our results do not support the old view of lower Central America as a frontier between more advanced cultures to the north and south. Any such explanation would require recent waves of migration from outside the region, migration that is not compatible with either the genetic or linguistic data or with the archaeological history of the region.\r"

To characterize all ADH genes, we have isolated 63 ADH clones from human genomic libraries made from one individual. Fifty-nine clones have been classified into five previously known loci: ADH1 (18 clones), ADH2 (20 clones), and ADH3 class I (16 clones), ADH4 class II (4 clones), and ADH5 class III (1 clone). Sequencing of one of the remaining four unclassified clones, SY lambda ADHE38, about 1.1 kb in length, shows no introns and three frameshift mutations in the coding region, with a total of 10 internal termination codons. When its deduced amino acid sequence was compared with those of the class I, class II, and class III ADHs, the proportions of identical amino acids were 56.7%, 55.5%, and 88.7%, respectively, suggesting that the processed pseudogene was derived from an ADH5 gene. The duplication event seems to have occurred about 3.5 million years ago, and the pseudogene has undergone a rapid change since then.\r"

The clones were characterized with respect to their insert size, stability, and representation of a set of Xq24-Xqter DNA probes. The inserts of the clones add up to 19.3 megabase (Mb) content, or about 0.4 genomic equivalents of that portion of the X chromosome, with a range of 40-650 kb in individual YACs. Eleven clones contained more than one YAC, the additional ones usually having hamster DNA inserts; the individual YACs could be separated by extracting the total DNA from such strains and using it to retransform yeast cells. One of the YACs, containing the probe for the DXS49 locus, was grossly unstable, throwing off smaller versions of an initial 300-kb YAC during subculture; the other YACs appeared to breed true on subculture. Of 52 probes tested, 12 found cognate YACs; the YACs included one with the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogense gene and another containing four anonymous probe sequences (DX13, St14, cpx67, and cpx6). Xq location of YACs is being verified by in situ hybridization to metaphase chromosomes, and fingerprinting and hybridization methods are being used to detect YACs that overlap.\r"

Cilazapril was studied in multiple-dose trials that included more than 4,500 hypertensive patients worldwide. Approximately 450 patients received cilazapril as monotherapy for more than one year, and another 430 patients were treated with cilazapril in combination with hydrochlorothiazide for more than six months. Cilazapril at doses of 2.5 to 5 mg once daily is clinically and statistically significantly more effective than placebo and as effective after eight weeks of therapy as hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, propranolol sustained release, captopril, and enalapril at the doses recommended by the manufacturers. The overall incidence of adverse events observed during cilazapril therapy is comparable with that seen with placebo in double-blind studies. Cilazapril 2.5 to 5 mg once daily seems to be better tolerated than hydrochlorothiazide and atenolol. Only five adverse events were reported at an incidence of 1 percent or more in controlled trials; these were headache, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, and chest pain, which all occurred at a frequency similar to that with placebo. Overall, cilazapril is effective and well-tolerated in the treatment of patients with hypertension.\r"

Fifteen patients had left ventricular hypertrophy documented by two-dimensional echo-cardiography. Sitting systolic blood pressure was reduced from 175.8 +/- 2.0 to 143.3 +/- 3.0 mmHg within 25 days of therapy (p less than 0.0001); sitting diastolic blood pressure decreased in the same period from 117.0 +/- 1.0 to 87.8 +/- 2.0 mmHg (p less than 0.0001), whereas heart rate remained unchanged. In 19 patients treated for an average of 48 weeks the therapeutic response was maintained during the long-term period. The mean effective dose was cilazapril 10 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 25 mg in 90 percent of the patients. Left ventricular mass decreased from 357 +/- 17 to 314 +/- 22 g (nine patients; p less than 0.005) and a correlation (Spearman r = 0.57, p less than 0.01) was found between left ventricular mass and sitting systolic blood pressure before and during treatment. Deceleration half time of peak early diastolic inflow velocity decreased significantly from 128 +/- 9 to 108 +/- 7 msec (p less than 0.05). Glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow remained within normal limits, whereas renal vascular resistance decreased from 0.16 +/- 0.0 to 0.10 +/- 0.0 resistance units (10 patients; p less than 0.01). Cilazapril in combination with hydrochlorothiazide was effective in the treatment of severe hypertension. Left ventricular hypertrophy regression influenced favorably left ventricular diastolic function in some patients, whereas renal hemodynamics were generally not affected by the therapy.\r"

Fifteen healthy male volunteers were given 2.5 mg oral cilazapril daily for two weeks. Blood rheology was quantified by measuring blood and plasma viscosity, hematocrit count, red blood cell aggregation and deformability, and white blood cell clogging at baseline, four hours after first dose and four and 24 hours after the last dose. No acute or chronic changes were observed except for a significant increase in red blood cell deformability and a decrease in white blood cell clogging. It is concluded that hemodilution secondary to vasodilation may occur but be offset by hemoconcentration induced by aldosterone inhibition and decrease of anti-diuretic hormone levels. The changes in deformability and clogging may benefit microcirculatory function, a hypothesis that would need further investigation in controlled trials.\r"

In these patients, increased morbidity and mortality rates have been proved. More than 50 percent of apnea patients exhibit arterial hypertension, and up to 50 percent of hypertensive patients experience sleep apnea. Patients with sleep apnea and essential hypertension need special attention paid to their antihypertensive therapy because the following side effects of drugs have to be avoided: increases of cardiac insufficiency, hyperviscosity of the blood, intensification of the hypersomnia by central sedation, intensification of a pre-existing tendency towards arrhythmias, and deprivation of deep and rapid eye movement sleep. In this study, the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with sleep apnea and hypertension are examined. An interim evaluation of six patients (aged 50 to 57) yielded the following results: Average Broca index, 124; average blood pressure before therapy, 159/102 mm Hg; average blood pressure after therapy, 132/78; a decrease of the apnea and hypopnea index from x = 31 (range, 12 to 77) to x = 20 (range, two to 54). Therapy did not influence sleep structure: before therapy, an average of 19 percent of sleep episodes were of the rapid eye movement type (range, 11 to 32 percent); after therapy, 23 percent were of this type on average (range, 21 to 25 percent). A final evaluation will be carried out after the second study phase for 12 patients who have been treated in a double-blind scheme with metropolol versus cilazapril.\r"

Twenty-five patients with a diastolic blood pressure from 95 to 115 mm Hg completed the trial. Blood pressure was measured pre-dose sitting and standing every week during placebo and every second week during active therapy, as well as two hours post-dose after placebo and at the end of active therapy. The dose of cilazapril was from 0.5 to 5.0 mg daily. After eight weeks of active therapy, a reduction in both pre-dose systolic and diastolic blood pressure was seen. No orthostatic effect on blood pressure was observed. The systolic blood pressure was better controlled as measured two hours post-dose compared with pre-dose, whereas no difference was found in diastolic blood pressure. No deterioration in kidney function occurred. Some cases of moderately increased serum-potassium were observed, especially in acidotic patients. No serious adverse reactions were observed.\r"

For this purpose, a group of spontaneously hypertensive rats treated for four months with cilazapril (10 mg/kg orally) was compared with a group of spontaneously hypertensive rats treated with placebo. Another group of Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats treated with placebo was used as a reference. At the end of the treatment period, the rats were perfused-fixed and morphometry of the carotid, renal, mesenteric and coronary arteries was performed. Vascular hypertrophy (increase of the thickness of the medial layer) was present in the four different types of arteries in a similar extent. Cilazapril normalized completely the arterial wall thickness:diameter ratio in the four different types of arteries. Further studies are required to determine whether this effect of cilazapril was due to the decrease of arterial blood pressure or to an effect of cilazapril on growth factors such as angiotensin II.\r"

After oral administration of single 100- to 600-mg doses to healthy younger volunteers, renal recovery indicates that the amount absorbed increases linearly from 100 to 600 mg. More than 70 percent of an oral dose is recovered in the urine as unchanged ofloxacin, and only minimal amounts, less than 5 percent of the dose, are recovered as the metabolites, desmethyl ofloxacin and ofloxacin N-oxide. After multiple (twice daily) oral administration of 400-mg doses to younger and older (65 to 81 years) healthy volunteers, a modest accumulation (i.e., maximal concentration increased about 50 percent), as predicted by single-dose data, is observed, and steady-state is achieved within 48 hours of the initiation of twice-daily dosing. In the young and elderly, ofloxacin is eliminated with a half-life of five to seven hours, independent of dose. In the renally impaired, however, there is a linear correlation between the half-life of ofloxacin and creatinine clearance, and this requires dose adjustment when the creatinine clearance rate is less than 50 ml/minute. The pharmacokinetics of ofloxacin also were investigated after intravenous administration of single 200- and 400-mg doses and multiple twice-daily 400-mg doses. After intravenous dosing, ofloxacin exhibits a pharmacokinetic profile similar to that seen after oral dosing, which supports the almost total oral absorption and the interchangeability of both forms of therapy. The pharmacokinetics of the compound indicate that, except for cases of renal impairment, little or no dosage adjustment is necessary.\r"

Metabolic studies were performed following intravenous infusion of a single 6 mg/kg dose of aminophylline. During Week 1, theophylline was given alone (blank period), and during Weeks 2 and 3 it was given during oral coadministration of ofloxacin and enoxacin, respectively. Dosage of each quinolone was 200 mg twice daily for four days, starting three days prior to the theophylline infusion. During enoxacin coadministration, elimination half-lives of theophylline increased from 8.7 to 17.4 hours and from 6.1 to 12.3 hours, respectively. Total body clearance of theophylline decreased in both volunteers, whereas renal clearance did not alter. From this it was concluded that the decreased elimination results from a reduced metabolic clearance. During enoxacin coadministration, the formation of the metabolites 1-methyluric acid and 3-methylxanthine clearly was decreased, whereas the formation of 1,3-dimethyluric acid was less affected compared with the blank period. Interference with theophylline disposition by enoxacin is based predominantly on inhibition of microsomal N-demethylation. Ofloxacin comedication did not cause a change in the plasma parameters or renal excretion of theophylline and its metabolites compared with the blank period.\r"

Informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Eighteen men with nongonococcal urethritis and 12 with previously positive chlamydial cultures were randomly treated with doxycycline or ofloxacin. Eleven women with mucopurulent cervicitis, 14 with a previous positive untreated chlamydial culture, and nine having sexual contacts with men known to have chlamydial urethritis also were randomly treated. Culture specimens for chlamydia were obtained before treatment, five to nine days after therapy (return visit 1), and 21 to 28 days after therapy (return visit 2). Cultures for Ureaplasma urealyticum were obtained only in men. There were no significant differences in results in patients treated with doxycycline or ofloxacin. All but three of 20 men with symptoms were symptom-free on return visit 1 and all were symptom-free on return visit 2. Thirteen women with mucopurulent cervicitis had all resolved at visit 1, although signs of cervicitis reappeared at the second visit in two patients treated with doxycycline and one treated with ofloxacin. All patients with positive chlamydial cultures had negative cultures at the first return visit. One patient treated with doxycycline was positive at the second return visit. Laboratory and clinical abnormalities were mild and did not prevent completion of therapy. These data, together with previous published and unpublished data, indicate that ofloxacin is as effective as doxycycline in the treatment of chlamydial infections. The study also demonstrated that ofloxacin and doxycycline were equally effective in the treatment of nongonococcal urethritis in men and mucopurulent cervicitis in women.\r"

The aims of this study were (1) to test, in an independent population, the prognostic reproducibility of these staging systems; and (2) to develop a synthesis staging system that could be easily applied in clinical practice. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 406 patients with newly diagnosed Ph-positive CML were evaluated by the four published staging systems of Tura, Cervantes, Sokal, and our group. The proposed synthesis staging system was developed based on the most consistent prognostic characteristics, and the presence or absence of accelerated disease features at diagnosis. The staging systems were compared according to survival outcome, as well as by looking for differences of survival outcomes within a specific stage of a defined system, when patients in this stage were subclassified by a second staging system. RESULTS: Whereas the staging system of Cervantes et al identified only two prognostic groups (median survivals of 49 versus 40 months; p = 0.01), the remaining three staging systems were able to segregate patients into stage 1, 2, and 3 risk groups with respective median survivals of 56 to 57, 41 to 42, and 28 to 36 months, respectively (p less than 0.001 to p less than 0.002). The new proposed staging system, based on the existence of zero to one (stage 1), two (stage 2), or three or more unfavorable (stage 3) characteristics, or the presence of accelerated disease features (stage 4), categorized patients into four prognostic groups with median survivals of 56, 45, 30, and 30 months, respectively (p less than 0.001), the latter stage (stage 4) being associated with a higher one-year mortality rate (29%). The synthesis staging system was also able to subclassify patients within most of Tura's and Sokal's stages into significantly different prognostic groups by survival outcome. CONCLUSION: The predictive prognostic capacity of three of the four published staging systems was confirmed in this independent or test population. The new proposed staging system was superior to the staging systems of Tura and Sokal in identifying different prognostic subgroups.\r"

PATIENTS, METHODS, AND RESULTS: Arm claudication or Raynaud's phenomenon was the initial manifestation of the disease in four cases, appeared with classical symptoms in one case, or occurred during decreasing corticosteroid therapy in five cases. Temporal artery biopsy was performed in nine patients and showed typical giant-cell granulomatous arteritis in seven cases. Angiograms in all cases showed multiple bilateral smooth stenoses, or obliterations of postvertebral subclavian and/or axillary arteries, or both. Symptoms always improved with corticosteroid treatment and none of the patients required reconstructive surgery, although angiography performed after stabilization did not show revascularization of occluded vessels. CONCLUSION: We conclude that large-artery involvement in TA and PMR affects most commonly the subclavian and axillary arteries, with a female predominance comparable to that in Takayasu's arteritis. Both these disorders should be considered in elderly women with occlusive disease of the upper extremities. Although response to steroid therapy was sufficient in our series to avoid surgery, we believe it is preferable to recognize large-artery involvement as early as possible and recommend performance of ultrasonic Doppler examination when any sign of oncoming ischemia or stenosis is observed.\r"

We report on seven patients from Westchester County, New York, with B. burgdorferi bacteremia diagnosed between April 1987 and August 1987. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred thirty-two attempts to isolate spirochetes were made on blood specimens obtained from 104 patients. Twenty-two of these specimens were obtained from nine patients who had recently been bitten by Ixodes ticks but who were asymptomatic. Heparinized blood or serum specimens (0.2 to 0.4 mL) were inoculated onto 6 mL of modified Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly medium. Lyme serology was performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent polyvalent, IgM, and IgG assays, fluorescent immunoassay, and microhemagglutination. RESULTS: Four of the seven patients had erythema migrans, two had facial nerve palsy, and one had a flu-like syndrome without rash. These patients represented 21% (four of 19) of all patients with the characteristic skin lesion who had blood cultures for B. burgdorferi, and 40% (two of five) of all those with facial nerve palsy. Serologic testing was frequently nonreactive; two patients had no detectable antibody on multiple sera by five different assays. All patients improved with antibiotic treatment, and had negative subsequent blood cultures, but five of seven had persistent complaints after completion of therapy. CONCLUSION: Culturing blood for B. burgdorferi may be useful in confirming the diagnosis of Lyme disease in selected patients. Use of spirochete blood cultures may facilitate a better understanding of the pathogenesis and natural history of Lyme disease.\r"

Our aim was to determine the frequency of adverse reactions to influenza vaccine in older, chronically ill persons, many of whom are at high risk for influenza-related morbidity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a telephone survey of 40% of the patients who were vaccinated at a walk-in flu shot clinic. The subjects were randomly assigned to two groups. To determine postvaccine symptom rates, Group I was interviewed seven days after vaccination. Group II was interviewed 21 days after vaccination in order to control for baseline symptom rates. Both groups were queried about fever, disability, and flu-like illness in the week preceding the interview. RESULTS: Of 816 patients selected, 650 (79.6%) completed the interview. The mean age of the subjects was 63, and more than two thirds were at risk for influenza-related morbidity. The frequencies of self-reported fever (5.3% versus 5.1%, p = 0.91) and disability (10.4% versus 9.3%, p = 0.65) were similar in the two groups. However, a significantly higher proportion of Group I subjects reported a flu-like illness compared to the Group II subjects (14.2% versus 8.7%, p = 0.03). Although Group I subjects were more likely to report flu-like illness within two days of vaccination compared to a similar time interval for Group II subjects, there was no corresponding clustering of disability after vaccination. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the overall frequency of symptoms in both groups was low; however, the absolute risk of a flu-like illness was 5.5% higher during the first week following influenza vaccination when compared with the third week after the injection. These symptoms did not result in a decreased ability to perform usual daily activities.\r"

This study was designed to determine the incidence and format of antipyretic orders in a university-based tertiary-care center, and to ascertain whether orders are correlated with patient characteristics or hospital services. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The records of 300 randomly selected patients on the medicine, general surgery, neurosurgery, and obstetrics and gynecology services, and of 75 patients admitted with pneumonia and fever were retrospectively reviewed using a standardized data form. RESULTS: Orders for acetaminophen prn (as needed), without further explanation, were interpreted by the nursing staff as antipyretic orders; 78% of patients with such an order and fever received acetaminophen during the febrile episode. If orders of this type were included, 153 (51%) of the randomly selected patients received an antipyretic order. Gender, age, duration of hospitalization, intensive care unit residence, fever, and presence of a condition worsened by fever were not significant independent predictors of antipyretic prescription, but documented infection and hospitalization on the medicine and neurosurgery services were, with adjusted odds ratios of 2.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3 to 5.0), 9.4 (95% CI 3.6 to 25), and 14 (95% CI 5.0 to 41), respectively. Of patients who received an antipyretic order, 70% had an admission order for antipyretics; 26%, an order prompted by fever; and 79%, an order while afebrile. In 86%, the order was written prn without further explanation. Around-the-clock dosing, automatic stop orders, and acknowledgement and justification of orders were rare. CONCLUSION: Antipyretic orders are routine and correlate more strongly with hospital service than with individual patient characteristics. They are umprecisely written and generally leave decisions about antipyretic administration to the complete discretion of the nursing staff.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Antimicrobial prophylaxis was begun at the time of initiation of chemotherapy. Thirty patients received ofloxacin tablets (300 mg orally every 12 hours) plus a nystatin suspension. Thirty-two patients received vancomycin capsules (500 mg orally every eight hours) and polymyxin capsules (100 mg orally every eight hours) plus a nystatin suspension. RESULTS: In the group of patients receiving ofloxacin, there were a lower number of acquired gram-negative bacillary organisms per patient (0.13 versus 1.37, p less than 0.00005), fewer patients with documented infection (11 of 30 versus 21 of 32, p = 0.04), and fewer cases of gram-negative septicemia (zero of 30 versus five of 32, p = 0.05). Ofloxacin was also better tolerated (24 of 30 versus 10 of 32 patients highly compliant, p = 0.01) and associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects (one of 30 versus nine of 32 patients with gastrointestinal side effects, p = 0.01) than vancomycin/polymyxin. However, except for a reduction of Staphylococcus aureus colonization and infection by ofloxacin, neither ofloxacin nor vancomycin/polymyxin was effective in eliminating colonization or infection with viridans group streptococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, or other gram-positive organisms. Only three isolates of ofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, and Enterobacter aerogenes) were isolated from surveillance cultures, but none caused infection. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that oral ofloxacin is a more tolerable and efficacious alternative to vancomycin/polymyxin for prevention of serious gram-negative bacillary infections in granulocytopenic patients. More effective prophylaxis of gram-positive infections, however, is still needed.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate a computerized system to monitor therapeutic antibiotics in a hospital setting. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From November 1986 through October 1987, we prospectively monitored 1,632 hospitalized patients who had 2,157 microbiology specimens sent for culture and sensitivity testing. During the study period, computer algorithms were used to identify patients whose antibiotic therapy was inappropriate in relation to microbiology culture and sensitivity data. When inconsistencies occurred between antibiotic therapy and in vitro sensitivity data, computer algorithms generated therapeutic antibiotic monitor (TAM) alerts. A clinical pharmacist then notified the attending physician of the alert. RESULTS: Antibiotic therapy was identified by the computer as inappropriate in 696 instances (32%). After we eliminated false-positive alerts, 420 evaluable TAM alerts remained. Physicians responded to the TAM alerts by either changing or starting antimicrobial therapy in 125 cases (30%). Moreover, physicians were previously unaware of the relevant susceptibility test results in 49% of the alerts. CONCLUSION: Computer-assisted monitoring is an efficient and promising method to identify and correct errors in antimicrobial prescribing and to assure the appropriate use of therapeutic antibiotics.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: We undertook this study to determine the occurrence of rhabdomyolysis in the hyperosmolal state. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed 130 hospital admissions due to diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolal coma, or both. Thirty-one patients (12 men and 19 women) were found to be in the hyperosmolal state. Sixteen of 31 patients showed biochemical evidence of rhabdomyolysis. The clinical and biochemical features of the patients with rhabdomyolysis (Group I) and the patients without rhabdomyolysis (Group II) were compared. RESULTS: Patients in Group I showed a 100-fold increase (7,156 +/- 2,820 IU/L) in serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) when compared to the patients in Group II (61 +/- 11 IU/L). The mean serum osmolality was much higher (p less than 0.001) in patients with rhabdomyolysis (381 +/- 12 mOsm/kg) than in those without rhabdomyolysis (324 +/- 4 mOsm/kg). The serum sodium level was elevated (p less than 0.001) in Group I patients (151 +/- 4 mEq/L) but not in Group II patients (133 +/- 2 mEq/L). There was a linear association between serum CPK versus serum sodium (r = 0.62, p less than 0.05) and serum CPK versus serum osmolality (r = 0.05, p less than 0.05). The mean serum potassium level was lower (p less than 0.01) in Group I than in Group II. Only two patients (12%) in Group I and almost half the patients (seven of 15) in Group II were hyperkalemic. The mean serum phosphorus level was lower in Group II than in Group I. Four patients in Group I and one patient in Group II developed acute renal failure. CONCLUSION: Subclinical rhabdomyolysis is a common finding in the hyperosmolal state. Absence of hyperkalemia in the presence of muscle injury, hyperosmolality, hyperglycemia, and acidosis suggested pre-existing total-body potassium deficiency in many of these patients. In addition to hypokalemia, the hyperosmolal state predisposes to the development of rhabdomyolysis.\r"

Compared with the nonpregnant state, there was a significant fall in systemic vascular resistance, pulmonary vascular resistance, colloid oncotic pressure, and colloid oncotic pressure-pulmonary capillary wedge pressure gradient by the late phase of the third trimester (p less than 0.05). Pregnancy was associated with a significant rise in cardiac output and pulse in all patients (p less than 0.05). There was no significant change in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, central venous pressure, left ventricular stroke work index, or mean arterial pressure.

The majority of patients had normal left ventricular filling pressure (8.4 +/- 0.2 mm Hg), normal to high cardiac index (4.4 +/- 0.1 L.min-1.m2), and upper normal to moderately elevated systemic vascular resistance (1226 +/- 37 dynes.sec.cm-5). Eight patients had pulmonary edema and their findings included high wedge pressure (18 +/- 1 mm Hg), upper normal to high cardiac index (4.9 +/- 0.5 L.min-1.m2), and normal systemic vascular resistance (964 +/- 50 dynes.sec.cm-5). Left ventricular function was hyperdynamic in 73% of the 49 patients. Patients with chronic hypertension and superimposed preeclampsia were hemodynamically indistinguishable from patients with preeclampsia alone. We conclude that, in general, preeclampsia is a high cardiac output state associated with an inappropriately high peripheral resistance. The normal wedge and central venous pressures suggest central redistribution of intravascular volume if the generally accepted reports of decreased plasma volume in preeclampsia are correct.\r"

With the use of M-mode echocardiography, cardiac output, ejection fraction, stroke volume, and end-diastolic volume were calculated from left ventricular dimensions with subjects in the left lateral position. Systemic vascular resistance was calculated with the use of cardiac output and simultaneously obtained measurements of arterial pressure. Cardiac output increased 1 L/min at 8 weeks' gestation, which represented greater than 50% of the total change seen. Cardiac output increased primarily because of stroke volume rather than heart rate. By 8 weeks' gestation, systemic vascular resistance had fallen to 70% of its preconceptional value. Thus when subjects are studied before conception and during the early phase of pregnancy, the majority of the pregnancy-induced changes in these parameters occur during the embryonic period.\r"

Exercise performance was prospectively monitored before and during pregnancy in 47 recreational runners, 40 aerobic dancers, and 28 physically active, fit controls. Pregnancy was diagnosed by an early test for beta-subunit human chorionic gonadotropin and viability was confirmed by ultrasonography at 40 days' conceptional age. Spontaneous abortion occurred in 19% of the pregnancies. The incidence was 17% in the runners, 18% in the aerobic dancers, and 25% in the controls. At term, one congenital abnormality was detected in each of the three groups. Late pregnancy events, potentially related to abnormalities of placentation, were limited to two cases of mild pregnancy-induced hypertension. We conclude that, in physically fit women, continuation of these types of aerobic activity at intensities between 50% and 85% of maximum during the periconceptional period and early pregnancy does not appreciably alter early pregnancy outcome.\r"

The amount of oxygen required to complete a three-step, graded workload treadmill protocol was monitored before, every 6 to 8 weeks during, and after a clinically normal, accurately dated, singleton pregnancy in 18 fit, recreational athletes. Nine subjects continued a moderate- to high-intensity exercise regimen and nine did not. The amount of oxygen required to complete each stage of the protocol decreased significantly (6% to 15%) in both groups in early pregnancy. In the women who continued exercise, the amount of oxygen required remained at or significantly below that required before conception for the remainder of the pregnancy and the initial postpartum period. Conversely, in the women who discontinued regular exercise, the amount of oxygen required for each stage rose progressively throughout the remainder of pregnancy at an average rate of 2% per lunar month. It peaked in the thirty-seventh week and remained significantly elevated 7 weeks post partum. However, when the data were corrected for the additional requirement imposed by pregnancy weight gain, net efficiency was increased in both groups throughout pregnancy. These data support three conclusions. First, the efficacy of low- to moderate-intensity treadmill exercise in physically active women is improved in early pregnancy. Second, this increased efficiency is masked later in pregnancy by the effects of weight gain. Third, the degree of efficiency is enhanced throughout pregnancy in women who continue a regular exercise regimen at or above a basic conditioning level.\r"

Fetal behavioral state observations were made with simultaneous recordings of fetal heart rate, gross fetal body movements, and fetal eye movement between 8:30 AM and 4:00 PM. During the first episode of behavioral state 1F (quiet sleep state) greater than or equal to 10 minutes duration on two consecutive half days, the vibratory stimulus was placed on the surface of the maternal abdomen over the fetal head. Each fetus received one 5-second vibratory stimulus during either the first or second half day of observation. The time at which the instrument was applied but no vibratory stimulus was administered was considered as the control period. All women were then observed for 2 hours after the control period and after stimulation. A transition period from a quiet sleep state to a stable active sleep state (state 2F, rapid eye movement sleep) averaged less than or equal to 3 minutes after stimulation, as compared with 23 minutes after the control period. These changes in fetal behavioral states persisted for 20 minutes after vibratory stimulation. There also was an immediate and sustained increase in long-term fetal heart rate variability, the number of fetal heart rate accelerations and gross fetal body movement during the first 20 minutes after stimulus, without changes in basal fetal heart rate. We hypothesize that changes in fetal behavior seen after application of low frequency vibratory stimulus are more physiologic than the profound changes in fetal heart rate and gross fetal body movement previously described after vibratory acoustic stimulation with an electronic artificial larynx.\r"

The peak concentration of nifedipine during sublingual therapy ranged from 23.4 to 197.9 ng/ml and reflected substantial interpatient variability. The mean (+/- SD) measurable trough value in patients who received 20 mg of nifedipine orally every 6 hours was 7.2 +/- 5.5 ng/ml. The maternal mean half-life of nifedipine was 81 minutes (range 49 to 137 minutes). At delivery, neonatal nifedipine levels were nondetectable in 6 of the 11 neonates available for study; in 5, values ranged from 29.5 to 1.8 ng/ml. From these results we conclude that both sublingual and oral nifedipine treatment results in variable but usually measurable maternal plasma concentrations and that placental transfer of nifedipine occurs.\r"

The mean (+/- 1 SEM) gestational age at the time of transfusion was 29.3 +/- 1 weeks and the mean beginning hematocrit was 27% +/- 2%. The mean volume of infused packed red blood cells (70% hematocrit) was 90.3 +/- 7 ml. The mean hematocrit at completion of the procedure was 48% +/- 1%. In nonhydropic fetuses umbilical venous pressure rose progressively from 6.7 +/- 1 mm Hg at the start of transfusion to 10.9 +/- 1 mm Hg at the completion of transfusion (p less than 0.002). However, most fetuses who began the infusion with a normal umbilical venous pressure ended the transfusion with a normal umbilical venous pressure (less than 10 mm Hg). Fetuses with immune hydrops (n = 2) had elevated umbilical venous pressure values before the initiation of transfusion therapy when compared with the first transfusion of nonhydropic fetuses (12.5 +/- 0.5 vs. 5.7 +/- 1 mm Hg, p = 0.01). However, the umbilical venous pressure measurements declined into the normal range within 24 hours of the first transfusion; this normalization was too rapid to be explained by the reversal of liver hypertrophy or portal hypertension. There was no demonstrable relationship between the rise in umbilical venous pressure and either the gestational age, the volume transfused, or the rise in hematocrit. This study demonstrated: (1) In terms of the umbilical venous pressure, direct intravenous infusion of the human anemic fetus is well tolerated; (2) the elevated umbilical venous pressure associated with immune hydrops can correct rapidly with red blood cell replacement.\r"

In addition, 26 fetuses with growth retardation and the absence of end-diastolic Doppler velocities in the umbilical artery were examined. Measurements were obtained from strip chart recordings; between three and five beats were used to obtain an average heart rate, ratio of peak velocity at atrial contraction to peak velocity in early diastole, and deceleration time in early diastole. Deceleration times increased during gestation from 86 +/- 27 to 116 +/- 18 msec in the tricuspid valve and from 98 +/- 25 to 132 +/- 21 msec in the mitral valve. Fetuses with growth retardation and the absence of end-diastolic Doppler velocities in the umbilical artery had longer deceleration times than those of normal fetuses (p less than 0.01). The increase in deceleration time across both atrioventricular valves in normal fetuses may be related to heart rate, an increased rate of ventricular relaxation, or an increase in ventricular compliance. The fetuses with intrauterine growth retardation and the absence of end-diastolic velocities in the umbilical artery have abnormally increased deceleration times; in the abnormal fetus this may be a result of impaired ventricular relaxation or decreased ventricular compliance.\r"

The placental location was determined by real-time ultrasonography, and the uterine artery resistance was determined by continuous-wave Doppler flow velocity waveform analysis. In the presence of preeclampsia or intrauterine growth retardation, up to 75% of the patients had unilaterally located placentas and 25% central placentas, whereas in the absence of these two conditions only 51% of the patients had unilateral and 49% central placentas (p less than 0.02). In patients with unilateral placentas, the incidence of preeclampsia and intrauterine growth retardation was 2.8-fold and 2.7-fold greater than in patients with central placentas (p less than 0.03 and p less than 0.01). Among all patients unilateral placental location was more likely to be associated with abnormal artery flow velocity waveforms than central placental location (p less than 0.001). We conclude that unilateral placental location may predispose to the development of preeclampsia and intrauterine growth retardation by its effect on uterine artery resistance.\r"

We define baseline levels of esterase activity in uninfected amniotic fluid and demonstrate a quantitative increase when infection is present. Fifty-seven amniotic fluid samples obtained at second- and third-trimester amniocenteses were divided into three parts, one for culture and two for a comparison of esterase activities by the dipstick and spectrophotometric methods. In this study, the spectrophotometric assay, because of its higher specificity and sensitivity in the determination of elevated esterase activity, was shown to be more reliable for predicting chorioamnionitis than either the dipstick or culture method.\r"

Cells were subcultured in a modified minimum essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum containing either 5.5 mmol/L (100 mg/dl) D-glucose (control), 11 mmol/L (200 mg/dl) D-glucose, or 22 mmol/L (400 mg/dl) D-glucose. Cells grown in mannitol-containing media were used as controls for osmolality. After 3 and 7 days' growth in different media, the labeling index was determined by autoradiographic analysis, and cell numbers were determined with a Coulter counter. The labeling indices for cells grown 3 days in 11 or 22 mmol/L D-glucose were 89% (p less than 0.002) and 84% (p less than 0.001), respectively, of control cells grown in 5.5 mmol/L D-glucose. After 7 days' growth, the labeling indices of cells grown in 11 or 22 mmol/L D-glucose were 84% (p less than 0.002) and 70% (p less than 0.001), respectively, of cells grown in 5.5 mmol/L D-glucose media. There was a significant decrease in the number of cells present at both 3 and 7 days in cultures grown in 22 mmol/L D-glucose compared with control. We conclude that a few day's exposure to high glucose levels can have an effect on proliferation of human placental cells in vitro. We suggest that a glucose effect on proliferation of other cells derived from the products of conception might be one mechanism contributing to abnormal development in some pregnancies of diabetic women.\r"

  ".W": "Although the fetal gastrointestinal tract is believed to be a major site of amniotic fluid absorption, there is little information with regard to the acute regulation of fetal swallowing. A model for the study of ovine fetal swallowing was developed to incorporate electromyograms, an esophageal flow probe, and a computer data acquisition and analysis program. The fetal swallowing responses to two primary thirst stimuli, plasma hyperosmolality and angiotensin II, were studied. On alternate days, chronically prepared fetal lambs (131 +/- 2 days) received an intravenous infusion of angiotensin II (100 ng/kg per minute) or bolus injections (3 ml) of 0.15 and 3.97 mol/L saline solution. In response to the angiotensin II infusion, fetal systolic (49.3 to 64.7 mm Hg; p less than 0.05) and diastolic (31.1 to 40.5 mm Hg; p less than 0.05) blood pressures significantly increased. However, fetal swallowing did not change from basal rates of 0.85 swallows per minute and a net esophageal flow of 0.98 ml/min. In response to the injection of 3.97 mol/L saline solution, fetal plasma osmolality increased (292 to 306 mOsm; p less than 0.05) and subsequently decreased to 300 mOsm at 15 minutes after the injection. Within 1 minute after injection of the hypertonic saline solution, fetal swallowing activity (6.0 swallows per minute; p less than 0.05) and net esophageal flow (2.4 ml/min; p less than 0.05) significantly increased. Swallowing returned to basal values within 5 minutes after the injection. The data indicate that ovine fetal responses to osmolar thirst challenges are intact at 130 days' gestation. Fetal swallowing and thus amniotic fluid volume may be affected by fetal responses to in utero stimuli.\r"

Therefore we postulated that by changing an animal's pH we could produce alterations in fluid distribution and affect the whole-body lymph flow rate. To test this hypothesis, we infused seven acutely nephrectomized anesthetized sheep with 2% body weight/volume isosmotic lactated Ringer's solution and bicarbonate (200 mEq) after a 30-minute control period. The fluid was infused over a 10-minute period with 20-minute recovery intervals. To another group of seven ewes, we infused the same volume of lactated Ringer's solution and hydrochloric acid (40 mEq). Throughout the experiment, we continuously measured arterial and venous pressures and lymph flow rate. Every 10 minutes we obtained samples for arterial pH, for hematocrit, and for plasma and lymph protein and osmolality. The infusion of bicarbonate was associated with a comparatively lower peak lymph flow rate (383% over baseline compared with 757% for acid infusion). Also the lymph flow rate after acid infusion started to increase approximately 5 minutes after the beginning of the infusion, as compared with approximately 10 minutes after the base infusion. Acid infusion did not increase arterial pressure, in contrast to the other infusions. The changes in pH obtained with the infusions were insignificant for the Ringer's infusion, +0.17 for the base, and -0.16 for the acid. The plasma/lymph protein concentration ratios at the end of the infusion were no different for acid or base: 112.4% +/- 4.4% and 101.9% +/- 5% (difference from control, mean +/- SEM) respectively (p greater than 0.1). In conclusion, minimal alterations of pH produced alterations in the cardiovascular and lymph flow rate responses to fluid challenge in anesthetized animals.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to define the hemodynamic response to rapid intravascular transfusion of the anemic fetal lamb and to determine whether furosemide alters that response. Sixteen experiments were performed in nine chronically instrumented gravid ewes between 0.8 and 0.9 of timed gestation. On day 1 of each experiment, each fetus was subjected to hemorrhage (40 ml/kg of estimated fetal weight) over 1 hour. On day 2, plasma was withdrawn from the stored fetal blood until the hematocrit was approximately 70%, and the packed red blood cells were returned to the fetus intravenously over 10 minutes. Each fetus received either furosemide (2 mg/kg) or control saline solution intravenously at time zero and again at 5 minutes. The order of experiments was randomly determined for each animal. Hemorrhage resulted in a similar decrease in fetal hematocrit in the two groups. The mean +/- SEM fetal hematocrit before hemorrhage was 38 +/- 3% in the furosemide group (n = 8) and 36 +/- 2% in the control group (n = 8). On day 2, the mean +/- SEM fetal hematocrit before transfusion was 28 +/- 2% in the furosemide group and 25 +/- 1% in the control group. There was no significant difference between groups in the fetal hemodynamic response to transfusion. At the end of the transfusion, the fetal central venous pressure had increased from 4.9 +/- 0.5 to 6.2 +/- 0.5 mm Hg in the furosemide group (p = 0.01) and from 3.9 +/- 0.2 to 5.8 +/- 0.3 mm Hg in the control group (p = 0.0001). Fetal mean arterial pressure increased from 42 +/- 1 to 50 +/- 1 mm Hg in the furosemide group (p = 0.0001) and from 40 +/- 1 to 46 +/- 1 mm Hg in the control group (p = 0.0007). Fetal heart rate decreased from 187 +/- 2 to 169 +/- 5 beats/min in the furosemide group (p = 0.004) and from 188 +/- 4 to 170 +/- 5 beats/min in the control group (p = 0.0008). Transfusion did not significantly change fetal pH in either group. At 120 minutes, the fetal PO2 had increased from 17 +/- 1 to 19 +/- 1 mm Hg in the furosemide group (p = 0.03) and from 19 +/- 1 to 21 +/- 2 mm Hg in the control group (p = 0.05). We conclude that rapid transfusion of the anemic fetal lamb resulted in modest increases in fetal central venous pressure and mean arterial pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

However, the regional blood flow distribution was not significantly different at rest between the embolized and normally grown fetuses despite the 39% decrease in fetal arterial oxygen content. The purpose of this study was to determine the circulatory responses to acute hypoxemic stress in the early development of intrauterine growth retardation. We found that the regional blood flow distribution was not significantly different during imposed acute hypoxemia between the seven fetuses with early intrauterine growth retardation and seven nonembolized normally grown fetuses. We conclude that growth-retarded fetuses are able to meet basal metabolic oxygen requirements and to respond normally to imposed acute hypoxemia until the placental circulatory reserve capacity is depleted.\r"

In decidua, prostaglandin F2 alpha may be formed de novo or from prostaglandin E2 through 9-ketoreductase activity, although it has been suggested that metabolism to 13,14-dihydro-15-ketoprostaglandin E2 through 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase is dominant. To examine this possibility, and to determine changes with labor, we examined interconversions of prostaglandin E2 to prostaglandin F2 alpha, 13,14-dihydro-15-ketoprostaglandin E2 and 13,14-dihydro-15-ketoprostaglandin F2 alpha by dispersed cells of decidua, chorion, and amnion obtained from patients at term elective cesarean section or after spontaneous labor. Incubations were performed with increasing concentrations (1 to 100 ng/ml) of prostaglandin E2 for 2 and 4 hours, and products were measured by radioimmunoassay. The 13,14-dihydro-15-ketoprostaglandin E2 was measured as 11-deoxy-13,14-dihydro-15-keto-11 beta, 16 psi-cycloprostaglandin E2. Basal output of prostaglandin E2 increased between cesarean section and spontaneous labor from 190.6 +/- 109 pg/10(5) cells (+/- SE) to 605.2 +/- 346.8 in amnion, nondetectable to 24.5 +/- 11.2 in chorion, and 18 +/- 16 to 69 +/- 25.8 in decidua. For both cesarean section and spontaneous labor patients there was very little conversion of prostaglandin E2 by the amnion, substantial conversion to 13,14-dihydro-15-ketoprostaglandin E2 by the chorion, and some conversion to 13,14-dihydro-15-ketoprostaglandin E2 by the decidua. Percentage conversions did not change with labor. Prostaglandin F2 alpha was formed by all tissues but only in trace amounts. All tissues from one cesarean section patient showed substantial conversion of prostaglandin E2 to prostaglandin F2 alpha, but very little 13,14-dihydro-15-ketoprostaglandin E2 or 13,14-dihydro-15-ketoprostaglandin F2 alpha formation, indicating either a decrease or deficiency in the 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase activity. We conclude that conversion of exogenous prostaglandin E2 to prostaglandin F2 alpha can occur in intrauterine tissues, but this does not normally contribute significantly to the prostaglandin F2 alpha output by the human decidua and fetal membranes.\r"

Because many of these agents stimulate the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor, we investigated in vitro the effect of pregnancy on acetylcholine-mediated relaxation of guinea pig uterine and carotid artery rings. The presence of intact and functional endothelium was confirmed both by examination under the scanning electron microscope and by vessel relaxation after the addition of acetylcholine. The addition of acetylcholine to the vessel bath produced dose-dependent relaxation of both carotid and uterine artery segments obtained from pregnant and nonpregnant animals after they had been submaximally preconstricted with phenylephrine. There was a significant increase in both response and efficacy to acetylcholine during pregnancy for both uterine and carotid arteries (p less than 0.0001 for each). The concentrations of endothelial cells (cells per square micrometer) were similar in uterine arteries from pregnant and nonpregnant animals. We conclude that the most likely explanation for these findings is a pregnancy-mediated enhancement of endothelium-derived relaxing factor activity.\r"

Stroke volume was manipulated acutely either by the removal of blood, the addition of fluid by injection, or by pharmacologic means. During each procedure, descending aortic blood flow was estimated by the Doppler ultrasonography method and compared to the flowmeter recording. The size of the lumen of the aorta determined by echocardiography was correlated with direct measurement during surgery and at autopsy. A total of 359 flow measurements were obtained in 15 fetuses. Doppler ultrasonographic flow studies and electromagnetic flowmeter measurements were found to be highly correlated (r = 0.93).

In nonpregnant sheep angiotensin II increases the lymph flow rate by what appears to be a direct effect on the lymphatic vessels. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that during pregnancy the lymph flow rate response to angiotensin II infusion is decreased in relation to that of the nonpregnant state. We speculate that a decrease in lymph flow may explain the interstitial fluid retention observed during human pregnancy. In nine nonpregnant and five pregnant chronically catheterized ewes, we infused angiotensin II at rates of 0.1, 10, and 1000 ng/kg/min during a 5-minute period, with intervals of at least 15 minutes between doses. At the highest angiotensin II dose, peak lymph flow rate increased 286% in pregnant ewes compared with an increase of 344% in the nonpregnant sheep (p less than 0.05). No changes occurred in the intravascular volume, plasma or lymph protein concentration, or venous pressure. The arterial pressure responses to angiotensin II were decreased in pregnant sheep (p less than 0.05). These results are compatible with a model for fluid retention in pregnancy in which a decreased lymph flow rate plays a significant role in interstitial fluid retention.\r"

  ".W": "The balance of fluid across capillaries is given by the Starling equation. Because the plasma protein concentration (one of its components) is decreased in pregnancy, we decided to explore the question as to whether hypoproteinemia with intact protein mass (produced by blood volume expansion) or hypoproteinemia with decreased total protein mass (produced by removal of circulating proteins) alters the oncotic pressure differences across capillaries. We calculated the oncotic pressure difference obtained in seven nonpregnant ewes during periods of normoproteinemia and hypoproteinemia; the influence of fluid infusion under both conditions was also observed. There was an increase in the oncotic pressure difference across the capillary wall during hypoproteinemia produced by a decrease in the total protein mass (p less than 0.01); however, the response to hypoproteinemia produced by fluid infusion was similar (p greater than 0.1). The venous pressure (used as an index of interstitial fluid pressure changes) did not differ in either hypoproteinemia or fluid infusion. Capillary permeability was decreased during hypoproteinemia, as evidenced by a higher lymph/protein ratio of labeled albumin during the control period (p less than 0.05). In conclusion, during a state of decreased plasma protein concentration similar to that of pregnancy, the difference in the oncotic pressure and hydrostatic pressure forces acting to prevent transfer of fluid to the interstitium is increased. Therefore other factors that influence fluid transfer across the capillaries must be investigated to explain the edema of pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "Intrauterine 17 beta-estradiol pellets can induce an up-regulation of guinea pig myometrial beta-adrenergic receptor density and l-isoproterenol-dependent adenylate cyclase activity. Does 17 beta-estradiol influence the ability of beta-adrenergic receptors to form a \"high affinity\" state with l-isoproterenol, which is a necessary step for adenylate cyclase activation? Nonpregnant, oophorectomized guinea pigs received intrauterine pellets of either placebo, 17 beta-estradiol, progesterone, or 17 beta-estradiol plus progesterone for 1 week. 17 beta-Estradiol resulted in pharmacologic, whereas progesterone resulted in physiologic plasma 17 beta-estradiol and progesterone concentrations, respectively. The affinity of myometrial beta-adrenergic receptors for l-isoproterenol was measured by percentage of inhibition of -[125I]cyanopindolol binding. In all groups, the competition curves in the presence of magnesium chloride could be resolved into two affinity states of the beta-adrenergic receptor, \"high\" and \"low,\" respectively. The ratio of their dissociation constants was not influenced by hormonal treatment. However, the relative concentration of beta-adrenergic receptors in the high affinity state was significantly higher in the 17 beta-estradiol-treated group than that in the control group. This correlates with the up-regulation in myometrial adenylate cyclase activity and suggests that myometrial beta-adrenergic receptor-adenylate cyclase function may be modulated by 17 beta-estradiol.\r"

To determine whether this difference is due to pregnancy in general or is associated only with late pregnancy and to determine whether it persists in the postpartum period, we studied the interaction of l-isoproterenol with beta-adrenergic receptors in myometrial membranes obtained from nonpregnant (nulligravid) animals, pregnant (primigravid) animals at 0.3, 0.7, and 0.9 to 1.0 of gestation (term 65 days), and postpartum guinea pigs (2 to 3 days). The affinity of myometrial beta-adrenergic receptors for l-isoproterenol was measured by percent inhibition of -[125I]cyanopindolol binding. In the presence of magnesium chloride, the competition curves could be resolved into two affinity state of the beta-adrenergic receptor, \"high\" and \"low,\" respectively, in all groups. The ratio of the dissociation constant of the \"low\"-affinity state to that of the \"high\"-affinity state was significantly higher in pregnant guinea pigs at greater than or equal to 0.9 of gestation than in nonpregnant or postpartum animals and in pregnant animals of earlier gestations. In the presence of guanosine triphosphate only one (low-affinity) state of the receptor was detectable. Thus it is only in pregnant guinea pigs at greater than or equal to 0.9 of gestation that the ability of myometrial beta-adrenergic receptors to form a high-affinity state is enhanced.\r"

[3H]Arginine vasopressin bound with affinity similar to that of [3H]oxytocin to both tissues (dissociation constant 1 to 2 nmol/L). The concentration of [3H]arginine vasopressin binding sites was high, particularly in decidua, but in all instances was about 50% to 60% of [3H]oxytocin binding. Analogs with selective oxytocic potency (4-threonine oxytocin, isotocin) had high affinity to both [3H]arginine vasopressin and [3H]oxytocin binding sites, as did analogs with both oxytocic and vasopressor activity (vasotocin). Analogs with selective antidiuretic activity (1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin) showed drastically reduced affinity to [3H]oxytocin binding sites and relatively low but significantly higher affinity to [3H]arginine vasopressin binding sites. A new oxytocin antagonist (RW22164 or [1-deamino-2D-tyrosine-(O-ethyl)-4-threonine-8-ornithine]oxytocin) competitively bound to both binding sites. Its affinity to [3H]oxytocin binding sites was greater than to [3H]arginine vasopressin binding sites whereas the relative affinities of a predominantly vasopressor antagonist [Manning compound) were reversed, suggesting the presence of distinct receptors for oxytocin and arginine vasopressin in pregnant human myometrium and decidua.\r"

  ".W": "To test the interaction of various hormones on the myometrium, the following experiments were done studying in vitro contractile activity of uterine segments from immature rats. The rats were divided into two groups: group 1 animals were treated with estrogen (n = 9) and group 2 animals were treated with both estrogen and progesterone (n = 11). Uteri from animals in each group were removed and segments were maintained in a temperature- and pH-controlled organ bath. After baseline contractions were established, uterine segments were treated with either oxytocin and then relaxin, or relaxin and then oxytocin. The dose of relaxin used, 20 ng/ml, was previously shown to be effective in inhibiting uterine contractions of animals treated with either estrogen or estrogen plus progesterone. The dose of oxytocin, 2.5 mlU/ml, was the maximal effective dose shown not to produce prolonged tetany. Estrogen plus progesterone treatment increased the frequency of contractions and resulted in contractions of greater duration of the maximal contractile force, as compared with treatment with estrogen alone. Oxytocin caused a stimulation of contractions in relaxin-inhibited uterine strips. Relaxin decreased the hypertonic contractions produced by oxytocin treatment, resulting in contractions similar to baseline. These data demonstrate that oxytocin and relaxin are directly antagonistic in their effects on uterine contractility. This suggests that labor may occur as a result of increased sensitivity to oxytocin or a decreased sensitivity to relaxin.\r"

Previously, total carotene content was estimated in a limited number of human tissues by means of spectrophotometric methods. In this study the levels of beta-carotene were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography in tissue samples of uterine leiomyomas and adjacent normal myometrium obtained at hysterectomy from uteri of 18 patients. beta-Carotene concentration was significantly (p = 0.0013) lower in fibroid tissue than in normal myometrium. In addition, levels of beta-carotene were assayed in tissue samples of cancers of the cervix, endometrium, ovary, breast, colon, lung, liver, and rectum and were compared with levels of respective adjacent normal sites. The concentrations of beta-carotene were found to be lower in all cancer tissues. The decreased levels of beta-carotene suggest that beta-carotene deficiency may have a role in the cause and/or pathogenesis of leiomyomas and cancers of the organs that were investigated. The mechanism of action, however, remains unknown.\r"

However, the usefulness of topical applications of epidermal growth factor in accelerating wound healing in full-thickness skin wounds with a large panniculus adiposus has not been clear. Four full-thickness skin incisions were made in the back of 10 female pigs that treated twice a day for 14 days with 2 ml of epidermal growth factor (300 ng/ml) or 2 ml of Ringer's lactate solution in a single-blind, randomized fashion. Two pigs received only epidermal growth factor, two pigs received only Ringer's lactate solution, and six pigs were treated with both solutions. The original skin plug was weighed to ensure similarity of groups. Photographs and measurements of each incision were taken every 7 days. The mean surface areas of the incisions treated with epidermal growth factor were 8.45, 7.50, and 2.30 cm2; in the incisions treated with Ringer's lactate solution the measurements were 8.42, 8.16, and 2.37 cm2 on observation days 1, 7, and 14, respectively. Although a trend toward a faster healing rate was noted in the incisions treated with epidermal growth factor, this difference was not statistically significant. With the doses and the time interval used between treatments, minimal benefit was obtained with epidermal growth factor when compared with Ringer's lactate solution.\r"

  ".W": "The development of an accurate method for the detection and typing of genital human papillomavirus is of substantial clinical importance. This virus has been implicated as an etiologic agent in the development of cervical neoplasia. To detect human papillomavirus infection with maximum sensitivity, cells must be collected and assayed for human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid. We compared two noninvasive methods of sampling exfoliated cervical cells--cervicovaginal lavage and scrape-Cytobrush. Seventy-four patients newly referred to the colposcopy clinic were divided randomly for cell sampling by either cervicovaginal lavage followed by scrape-Cytobrush or, conversely, scrape-Cytobrush followed by cervicovaginal lavage. Restriction analysis and Southern blot hybridization were used to test all the samples thus obtained for human papillomavirus. Overall, test results from 42 patients (56.8%) were positive for human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid. Twenty-six (31.1%) tested positive for human papillomavirus by both sampling methods, and 32 (43.2%) tested negative for human papillomavirus by both methods. One (1.4%) tested positive with scrape-Cytobrush sampling but negative with cervicovaginal lavage, while 15 (20.3%) tested negative with scrape-Cytobrush but positive with cervicovaginal lavage (p less than 0.001, McNemar's test). These data, combined with previous work from our group, suggest that, of the available methods, cervicovaginal lavage, coupled with human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization, is the most sensitive noninvasive method for harvesting cells for molecular identification of human papillomavirus in the female lower genital tract.\r"

Hormone profiles were evaluated at 5 to 8 weeks' gestational age. Ectopic pregnancies were diagnosed by laparoscopy; intrauterine gestations were confirmed by ultrasonography. Immunoreactive beta-human chorionic gonadotropin, progesterone, estradiol, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone were measured by radioimmunoassay. Bioactive human chorionic gonadotropin was measured by a modified mouse Leydig cell bioassay. Diminished steroid production was noted in ectopic pregnancies; levels in serum of patients with resorbing ectopic pregnancies were lower than values expressed in viable ectopic pregnancies (p less than 0.01). Serum levels of human chorionic gonadotropin bioactivity correlated closely with immunoreactive human chorionic gonadotropin in all three groups (r = 0.81, p less than 0.01). Ratios of bioactive human chorionic gonadotropin to immunoreactive beta-human chorionic gonadotropin were similar (0.93 +/- 0.26 in resorbing ectopic pregnancies, 1.11 +/- 0.16 in viable ectopic pregnancies, and 0.90 +/- 0.10 in intrauterine pregnancies). We conclude that although reduced serum levels of steroids noted in ectopic pregnancy suggest an impairment in corpus luteum activity, diminished steroid production was not attributable to lower human chorionic gonadotropin bioactivity.\r"

Estrogen replacement has been shown to impart protection against ischemic heart disease. We hypothesized that estrogen may influence vascular production of vasodilators such as prostacyclin. To investigate this relationship we have measured the production of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, and thromboxane B2 by superfused uterine arteries from pre- and postmenopausal women. Arterial specimens from healthy normotensive premenopausal (n = 5) and postmenopausal women (n = 5) were superfused for 5 hours. Production of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha reached steady state levels by 120 minutes and remained linear for the length of the experiment. Indomethacin (4 x 10(-5) mol/L) added at 120 minutes significantly decreased prostanoid production. In subsequent experiments, 17 beta-estradiol in concentrations of 10, 100, 1000 ng/ml was added to the superfusion media at 120 minutes. Total production of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha by premenopausal arteries superfused with neat media during the steady state interval (3 hours) was significantly greater than that of postmenopausal specimens (1.25 versus 0.27 ng/mg dry tissue, p less than 0.05). Thromboxane B2 levels were undetectable in spent media. However, the addition of 17 beta-estradiol did not alter production of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha. These data suggest that arterial production of prostacyclin is significantly decreased in uterine arteries from postmenopausal women, but in this in vitro model system estrogens did not affect vascular prostanoid production.\r"

Results of 16 patients with premenstrual syndrome were compared with six age-matched women with endogenous depression and 16 control women. On both the Profile of Mood States and Beck Depression Inventory, women with premenstrual syndrome showed a marked worsening of scores (p less than 0.01) during the luteal phase compared with either their own follicular phase scores or the scores of controls in either cycle phase. However, Beck Depression Inventory scores were threefold higher (p less than 0.005) in women with depression than in those with luteal phase premenstrual syndrome (3.37 +/- 3.6 vs. 11.9 +/- 2.5). The Profile of Mood States depression scale was also higher (p less than 0.05) in women with depression than in those with premenstrual syndrome, while scores on other Profile of Mood States scales were similar. The numbers of cortisol secretory pulses identified by the cluster algorithm were similar (5 to 6 per 24 hours) in all groups, and the time of circadian nadirs as determined by cosinor rhythmometry were comparable. While the mean amplitude and duration of the cortisol pulses were also similar in women with premenstrual syndrome and controls, both were significantly higher (p less than 0.05) in women with depression. This resulted in markedly enhanced (p less than 0.005) cortisol secretion during a given secretory episode in women with depression and in higher 24-hour transverse mean cortisol values in women with depression (87.8 +/- 5.8 ng/ml) than in either those with premenstrual syndrome (66.7 +/- 3.3 ng/ml) or controls (58.9 +/- 3.3 ng/ml). These data affirm the clinical impression that depressive episodes occurring selectively in the luteal phase of the cycle in women with premenstrual syndrome are not present in controls and demonstrate, for the first time, that these episodes are distinct from endogenous depression as measured by both cortisol secretory parameters and psychological indices.\r"

Concentrations and binding constants of the receptors were determined in endometrium obtained 8 to 12 days after midcycle luteinizing hormone surge. Scatchard plots for both estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors were linear, indicating only one type of high-affinity binding sites. In control cycles, estrogen receptor levels (mean +/- SEM) were 199.6 +/- 23.1 fmol/mg deoxyribonucleic acid, (n = 8) and were not significantly different from either 50 mg clomiphene citrate (180.5 +/- 19.1 fmol/mg deoxyribonucleic acid, n = 6) or 150 mg clomiphene citrate (194.3 +/- 35.2 fmol/mg deoxyribonucleic acid, n = 4).

Clomiphene citrate also did not affect dissociation constants for progesterone receptors. Therefore, ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate apparently did not affect peri-implantation phase endometrial estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors or their respective binding constants.\r"

This investigation was undertaken to compare the content and activity of aromatase in the placenta and various other human fetal tissues. Tissues were obtained from first- and second-trimester human abortuses. The amount of aromatase P-450 (aromatase cytochrome P-450) in tissue homogenates was determined after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting by use of a polyclonal antibody directed against aromatase cytochrome P-450. The activity of aromatase in microsomal preparations was assayed by determining the rate of incorporation of tritium from 1-[3H]androstenedione into [3H]water. The greatest amount of aromatase cytochrome P-450 (55 kd) was detected in placenta and lesser amounts were detected in other tissues. Aromatase activity also was highest in placental microsome fractions (368 +/- 62.4 pmol/mg/hr [mean +/- SE], n = 9). A significant amount of aromatase activity was also detected in fetal liver (19 +/- 4.8 pmol/mg/hr, n = 7). Much less activity was found in brain (2.8 +/- 1.0 pmol/mg/hr, n = 6) and intestine (2.7 +/- 1.3 pmol/mg/hr, n = 7). Minimal activity was noted in adrenal (n = 5), spleen (n = 4), stomach (n = 4), and muscle (n = 5) (1.2 to 1.5 pmol/mg/hr). Activity in kidney (n = 7), heart (n = 4), and lung (n = 4) was extremely low (less than 0.8 pmol/mg/hr). In conclusion, the placenta is a major site of conversion of C19 steroid precursors to estrogens because of the amount of enzyme and the high rate of activity of aromatase compared with those of other fetal tissues. However, considering the size and rate of aromatase activity in other fetal tissues such as liver, brain, and intestine, these tissues also may contribute to the total estrogen production in the fetal-placental unit.\r"

  ".W": "The in vivo bioavailabilities of three clinically available progestational agents were evaluated with a previously described rat model. With this model a single-injection, double-isotope technique was performed to calculate and compare the unidirectional extractions of progesterone, 19-nortestosterone, and medroxyprogesterone acetate into the rat uterus and liver. To assess the role of plasma protein binding in the extraction of these agents, steroids were presented in four different vehicles: (1) Ringer's solution, 0.1% bovine serum albumin; (2) Ringer's solution, 4% bovine serum albumin; (3) Ringer's solution, 0.8 mg/ml, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein; (4) human pregnancy serum. The results revealed that liver extraction always exceeded uterine extraction for each progestin, regardless of the vehicle, and that liver extraction was approximately 100% for all steroids. With regard to the uterus, when binding proteins were not present in the injectate, the extraction of the three steroids was similar; the uterine vasculature was relatively permeable to these progestins, and bovine serum albumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein had no major effect on the uptake into the uterus. However, when human pregnancy serum was in the injectate, the extractions of progesterone and 19-nortestosterone into the rat uterus were significantly diminished. In contrast, pregnancy serum had no effect on the uptake of medroxyprogesterone acetate into the uterus, with the extraction equal to that of Ringer's solution alone. This suggests that, regardless of potential binding proteins, medroxyprogesterone acetate displays greater bioavailability than that of the other progestogens studied.\r"

Although serum 5 alpha-androstane-3 alpha, 17 beta-diol (3 alpha-diol) glucuronide signifies skin 5 alpha-reductase activity and has been used as a marker of hirsutism and peripheral androgen metabolism, other C19 androgen conjugates have recently been measured and may also be useful markers of hirsutism in women. In addition to normal controls we studied both hirsute and nonhirsute patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome who had similar levels of circulating androgen precursors. In these three groups we measured various C19 sulfates and glucuronides including serum 3 alpha-diol glucuronide. Serum androgen precursors were elevated, but were equal in the hirsute and nonhirsute patients. Serum androsterone sulfate and glucuronide, and 3 alpha-diol sulfate and glucuronide clearly differentiated the hirsute from the nonhirsute group. Among the conjugates, androsterone glucuronide was most reflective of the difference between the two groups (100.3 +/- 28.0 versus 42.9 +/- 4.0 ng/ml, p less than 0.05). In hirsute compared with nonhirsute patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome, serum 3 alpha-diol glucuronide was increased by the smallest amount (32%), followed by androsterone sulfate (38%), 3 alpha-diol sulfate (59%), and androsterone glucuronide with the largest increase (134%). Serum androsterone glucuronide and 3 alpha-diol glucuronide both correlated with androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in hirsute women but not in nonhirsute women. These data suggest that besides serum 3 alpha-diol glucuronide, other C19 sulfate and glucuronide conjugates may reflect peripheral androgen action.\r"

Allopurinol (50 mg/kg) or vehicle was injected, followed by human chorionic gonadotropin (100 IU). Administration of inhibitor or vehicle was repeated 3 hours later. Ovaries and ovulated ova were inspected 12 or 24 hours after human chorionic gonadotropin administration for follicle rupture, cumulus dispersal, and nuclear maturation. Ova were inseminated in vitro and assessed for development to the blastocyst stage, up to 96 hours after insemination. Allopurinol significantly reduced ovulatory efficiency, defined as the percent of large follicles that ovulate, and decreased the percent of ova with cumulus dispersal. Allopurinol significantly inhibited morula and blastocyst formation. These data suggest that the xanthine oxidase system may play a role in ovulation and early embryonic development.\r"

  ".U": "90102620\r", 
  ".W": "Tumor necrosis factor is a product of activated monocytes, macrophages, and lymphocytes that exerts a variety of effects in the host. Its cytotoxicity toward gametes has been suggested as a mechanism of how activated macrophages may cause subfertility, inasmuch as detectable levels of tumor necrosis factor have been reported in the peritoneal fluid of infertile patients. To further examine this issue we measured tumor necrosis factor activity in peritoneal fluid and its release in vitro from monocytes or peritoneal macrophages of patients undergoing laparoscopy because of either tubal ligation or infertility. Cytolytic activity was determined with a bioassay with sensitized mouse fibrosarcoma cells as target. Significant tumor necrosis factor activity (greater than 5 U/ml) was detected in 38% of the peritoneal fluid samples. A total of 43% of the peritoneal macrophage samples released significant tumor necrosis factor activity in vitro and all samples tested including peripheral monocytes released high levels of activity in the presence of bacterial endotoxin. The activity was released in vitro in a time-dependent manner. Thermal stability characteristics and neutralization with a specific antibody indicated that most of the activity in peritoneal fluid or released in vitro was that of tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Statistical analysis of tumor necrosis factor activity in peritoneal fluid in various diagnostic categories revealed a significantly elevated level in patients with endometriosis, as compared with fertile women. Endometriosis and pelvic adhesions were also significantly more likely to be associated with measurable levels of tumor necrosis factor activity released by peritoneal macrophages in vitro. Overall, because tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels were frequently detectable, it suggests that activation of peritoneal macrophages either by bacterial products or inflammatory conditions can occur in vivo. Moreover, these cells remain competent to release tumor necrosis factor in vitro.\r"

In this work the 17 beta-estradiol dehydrogenase antibody was used to isolate and sequence a complementary deoxyribonucleic acid clone encoding about 98% of the amino acid sequence of the 17 beta-estradiol dehydrogenase molecule. This sequence verifies previous sequence data on the molecule's steroid binding site and also localizes a putative nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide binding region similar to that of many other pyridine nucleotide-dependent dehydrogenases. Isolation of the complementary deoxyribonucleic acid for 17 beta-estradiol dehydrogenase expands our knowledge of the structure-function relationships of the enzyme and is a major step in our understanding of its biologic function in pregnancy.\r"

Of two patients with benign polyps, one had polyps and one, carcinoma and of five patients with inflammatory bowel disease, four had proctitis and one, carcinoma. The treatment of polyps and carcinoma is the same as for other patients with these conditions. Proctitis should be treated with reanastomosis.

The mean vector symmetry index in asymptomatic women was 0.76, compared with 0.33 in incontinent women with a known sphincter injury (p = 0.0001). Among women who were incontinent without having a recognized sphincter injury, nearly half of those who had a previous episiotomy had subnormal (less than 0.60) vector symmetry indices (p = 0.0003). The values were in the same range as those from known injuries, suggesting the presence of an occult sphincter injury. In contrast, normal symmetry indices were found in all those who had never had an episiotomy or who presented with outlet constipation. We conclude that the vector symmetry index can expose occult anal sphincter injuries and may have a role in the selection of patients for sphincter repair.\r"

Many patients had multiple complications of the jejunoileal bypass operation. Twenty-nine patients underwent gastroplasty at the time of reversal and 14 did not. Seventy three +/- 5 months after reversal, patients with a gastroplasty weighed significantly less than patients without a gastroplasty. Patients with electrolyte imbalance, malnutrition, and diarrhea were all improved after reconstruction. Two patients with cirrhosis died of liver failure after reconstruction; the distinguishing preoperative characteristic was ascites. Postoperative interval liver biopsies indicated improvement in histologic appearance in four patients and no change in three. Nephrolithiasis improved or disappeared in all patients after reconstruction, whereas arthritis improved in 5 of 7 patients. Gastroplasty produced no benefit in alleviation of metabolic complications of jejunoileal bypass operations. Although the survival rate in these patients at last follow-up was 95 percent, 28 percent were incapacitated. Simultaneous gastroplasty performed at the time of reversal significantly decreases body weight when compared with patients undergoing reversal without a gastroplasty.\r"

  ".W": "Ambulatory 24-hour esophageal manometry was applied to analyze motility in 12 normal subjects and 9 patients with chest pain and dysphagia caused by diffuse esophageal spasm (DES). Pain episodes characterized by nonperistaltic activity occurred in 7 of 9 patients. A score based on 10 variables of the motility pattern differentiated patients from normal subjects and quantitated the severity of the disorder. Ambulatory motility monitoring was prospectively performed in 8 normal subjects and 37 patients: 8 with DES, 13 with hypertensive contractions, and 16 with a nonspecific disorder on standard manometry. The score was positive in 6 of 8 patients with DES and negative in all normal subjects (accuracy 87 percent). Nine of the 13 patients with hypertensive contractions (70 percent) and 6 of 16 with nonspecific disorders (38 percent) had a pathologic score reflecting a dysmotility as severe as DES. Ambulatory esophageal manometry is a more physiologic way to identify a motor disorder than standard manometry and has the potential to improve selection of patients for a surgical myotomy.\r"

  ".W": "The indications for highly selective vagotomy have expanded in recent years, with the technique being applied to selected cases of perforation and bleeding. Its use in obstruction is controversial, but two options are available for managing the stenotic pylorus or duodenum: dilatation or duodenoplasty. The latter choice requires that the stenosis be located in the postbulbar area. Since 1981, we have managed 15 patients with postbulbar stenosis by means of highly selective vagotomy and duodenoplasty. All patients had a previous history of ulcer disease, and vomiting was a consistent symptom. All patients were referred for surgery, 10 by a gastroenterologist. There was no operative mortality or procedure-related morbidity. Two patients have been lost to follow-up. Both were classified as Visick I and had normal endoscopic results at their last visit. The remaining 13 patients have all been followed very recently. Twelve patients (92%) are currently classified as Visick I or II. One patient (Visick IV), who was essentially asymptomatic, was found to have a recurrent ulcer on endoscopy. Endoscopic (11 patients) or radiographic (1 patient) patency of the duodenoplasty has been demonstrated in 12 patients. Highly selective vagotomy and duodenoplasty should be a surgical consideration when the pathologic anatomy of the duodenum lends itself to that choice.\r"

We studied the effects of cimetidine on bile acid concentration and composition by high-performance liquid chromatography. The gastric aspirates collected for this study came from 27 prospectively randomized patients receiving intravenous cimetidine (200 mg every 6 hours) and 25 patients given a placebo. Total bile acid concentration of aspirates was determined spectrophotometrically. Marked differences were noted in conjugated bile acids. Glycochenodeoxycholic acid, a toxic dihydroxy bile acid, was decreased after cimetidine compared with results from the placebo. The ratio of less toxic trihydroxylated to more toxic dihydroxylated bile acids was significantly increased. Enterogastric reflux itself seemed unaltered by cimetidine; likewise, the concentration of total bile acids in the cimetidine group was similar to that among patients receiving placebo. These changes in bile salt composition with cimetidine may help explain its salutary effects in gastritis, over and above its ability to reduce gastric hydrogen ion secretion.\r"

An early increase in PCA in the graft mesenteric nodes marks the onset of the host-graft immune interaction prior to any PCA or histologic changes in the other tissue compartments. This was followed by increases in PCA in the peripheral blood and graft intraepithelial compartments coinciding with maximal clinical and histologic signs of rejection. Cyclosporin A fully suppressed alloantigen-induced activation of PCA in the intraepithelial compartment and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, but only partially suppressed PCA in graft mesenteric nodes of the allogeneic transplants. The sequence of PCA changes accurately reflected the clinical and histologic changes during allograft rejection. Thus, PCA measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells appears to be a sensitive and accurate marker of allograft rejection.\r"

In the present study, we applied quantitative fluorescence image analysis (QFIA) cytology to the detection of experimental colorectal cancer in a rodent model. QFIA cytology combines visual cytologic examination with quantitation of DNA content in single exfoliated cells. Cancer was induced by treating 110 rats with subcutaneous 1,2-dimethylhydrazine. Sequential colon washes were obtained weekly from each animal for 20 weeks. Control animals were treated identically except for the administration of carcinogen. Cells that were cytologically abnormal or had increased DNA content were found starting in the second week. By the eighth week, roughly 50 percent of animals had positive results, and this level remained approximately constant for the duration of the study. Tissue pathologic results were normal during weeks 1 to 7. Dysplasias became common during weeks 8 to 15 whereas most cancers appeared during weeks 16 to 21. These results indicate that QFIA cytology is a highly sensitive method for detecting even preneoplastic changes resulting from carcinogen administration and may prove useful in detecting human colorectal cancer.\r"

There was a 13 percent incidence of miscellaneous postoperative complications. Pouch perianal fistulas developed in 5 percent of patients, and pouch vaginal and other pouch fistulas developed in an additional 4 percent. During long-term follow-up, small bowel obstruction developed in 27 percent of patients, and enterolysis or enterectomy was required in 15 percent of patients. One hundred fourteen patients who were followed for a mean length of 5 years after ileostomy closure (range 16 to 88 months) were evaluated for functional outcome. Function improved with time in 63 percent of patients and remained stable in another 33 percent; only 4 percent had long-term deterioration. Ninety-five percent of patients would again choose an ileoanal reservoir over a permanent ileostomy. This long-term assessment shows that although the ileoanal reservoir is a viable option in the management of mucosal ulcerative colitis, it should not be recommended to every patient.\r"

Treatments were continued after initial hospitalization to achieve variceal eradication. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 26 (mean: 15) months. Bleeding was controlled until discharge from hospital or death in 18 of 21 patients who were actively bleeding at index endoscopy. Overall, 26 patients died during the study, 12 during the index hospitalization. Cause of death was organ failure in 21, exsanguination in 3, and cancer in 2. Forty-one of 88 initial survivors experienced 72 episodes of recurrent bleeding (1 to 4 per patient). All but five rebleeds occurred before eradication. Sixty of 88 patients (68%) who survived index hospitalization had their varices eradicated. A median of 5 (1 to 12) treatments was required. Nine patients eventually had other forms of treatment for recurrent bleeding. Only 3 non-bleeding complications resulted from 462 endoscopic treatment sessions. We conclude that endoscopic ligation controls active variceal bleeding and eradicates varices with efficacy similar to that of sclerotherapy and with minimal risk of complications.\r"

Extraction increased to 31% 1 week later (p less than 0.05) and then returned to normal by week 2. Gut ammonia release decreased after massive small bowel resection, whereas intestinal alanine release increased. The increase in gut glutamine extraction at 1 week occurred at a time when jejunal and ileal DNA and protein content were markedly increased (p less than 0.01). Intestinal glutaminase content declined initially and then increased by the third week after bowel resection (p less than 0.01). With time, increases in gut cellularity and glutaminase content are associated with gut glutamine utilization in the shortened small bowel that is equal to that of the intact unresected intestine.\r"

We analyzed and compared compliance characteristics of triple-limb S and quadruple-limb W reservoir designs and correlated changes in capacity with overall function. Fifty patients underwent colectomy and reservoir construction for ulcerative colitis or familial adenomatous polyposis; 12 received S reservoirs and 38 received W reservoirs. Reservoir compliance was assessed by means of a specially designed condom catheter that continuously recorded intrareservoir pressure and changes in perfused volume. During reservoir infusion, volumes and pressures at initial fullness, normal sensation of evacuation, and maximum tolerated volume were noted. Studies were performed at 2 and 12 months after ileostomy takedown. An increase in normal evacuation volume from 218 +/- 9 mL to 310 +/- 12 mL between 2 and 12 months (p less than or equal to 0.05) was observed in patients with W reservoirs. Similar changes were recorded in S reservoir reconstructions (201 +/- 14 mL to 291 +/- 22 mL, p less than or equal to 0.05). No significant differences were observed in the mean pressure at normal evacuation volume between the S and W groups at 2 and 12 months. The 24-hour stool frequency decreased an average of 3 per day for both reservoir designs between the 2- and 12-month study period (p less than or equal to 0.05). This frequency was most directly predicted by normal evacuation volume (r = 0.90 for W and 0.88 for S). The decrease in stool frequency correlated with increased reservoir compliance, as shown by larger tolerated volumes at similar pressures. Restorative proctocolectomies with S or modified W reservoirs are both acceptable alternatives and demonstrate similar compliance characteristics and functional results.\r"

Therapy in acute Budd-Chiari syndrome is dictated by the liver biopsy, with hepatocyte necrosis indicating the need for placement of a decompressive shunt. The type of shunt was determined by intrahepatic vena cava obstruction; a higher morbidity rate was associated with the mesoatrial shunt in 11 patients than with a portacaval shunt in 10 patients. Successful shunt placement allowed stabilization of the liver biopsy and maintenance of good hepatocyte function [galactose elimination capacity (preoperative: 349 +/- 40 mg/minute; 20 months: 344 +/- 60 mg/minute)]. Severe fibrosis and reduced galactose elimination capacity (264 +/- 43 mg/minute) indicated advanced disease--chronic Budd-Chiari syndrome--and were indications for liver transplant. Hematologic evaluation documented a myeloproliferative disorder in 8 of the last 13 patients evaluated; perioperative and late anticoagulation and/or chemotherapy reduced recurrent thrombosis. We conclude that the Budd-Chiari syndrome requires different therapies depending on the stage of disease. If no hepatocyte injury is present on biopsy, therapy may not be needed. Acute, reversible injury can be managed by placement of a decompressive shunt. Irreversible damage requires transplantation. Selection of the right therapy requires a complete evaluation.\r"

Direct choledochal-enteric anastomosis proved superior to cholecystojejunostomy because of the high incidence of postoperative biliary sepsis and obstruction with the latter. The lowest incidence of these complications was achieved with choledochoduodenostomy. Loop gastrojejunostomy and Roux-Y gastrojejunostomy resulted in similar complication rates and postoperative stays, but, because loop reconstruction was simpler, it was deemed superior. Blood loss, operative time, and hospital stay were similar in patients with loop gastrojejunostomy and patients with no gastric bypass. This finding, coupled with a 10% incidence of subsequent gastric outlet obstruction in those without gastric bypass, indicates that gastric bypass should be liberally applied in the palliation of pancreatic carcinoma.\r"

Three groups of mice were studied: control (n = 20), sham ligated (n = 28), and bile duct ligated (n = 33). The sham-ligated group underwent laparotomy and manipulation of the portal region, whereas the ligated group had their common bile ducts ligated. Seven days later, the mice were killed, their organs cultured, and the gastrointestinal tract examined histologically. The bilirubin levels of the ligated group (18.7 mg/dL) were elevated compared with the other groups (0.5 mg/dL) (p less than 0.05). The incidence of bacterial translocation was higher in the ligated (33%) than in the control (5%) or sham-ligated (7%) groups (p less than 0.05). Since bile is important in binding endotoxin and maintaining a normal intestinal microflora, cecal bacterial populations were quantitated. The cecal levels of gram-negative, enteric bacilli were 100-fold higher in the bile duct-ligated mice in which bacterial translocation occurred (p less than 0.05), indicating that intestinal bacterial overgrowth was a major factor responsible for bacterial translocation. The mucosal appearance of the intestines from the control and sham-ligated groups was normal. In contrast, subepithelial edema involving the ileal villi was present in the ligated group. In conclusion, the absence of bile within the gastrointestinal tract allows intestinal overgrowth with enteric bacilli and the combination of bacterial overgrowth and mucosal injury appears to promote bacterial translocation.\r"

One, 3, 5, and 10-year survivals for the entire group were 49 percent, 12 percent, 5 percent, and 2 percent, respectively. One, 3, 5, and 10-year survivals in the resected group (66 percent, 21 percent, 8 percent, and 4 percent, respectively) were superior to those in the stented group (27 percent, 6 percent, 0 percent, and 0 percent, respectively). Radiotherapy appeared to significantly extend survival in those patients undergoing palliative stenting, but not in those undergoing resection. We conclude that surgical resection of proximal cholangiocarcinomas can be performed safely and that it significantly prolongs survival. Further improvement in long-term survival will depend on advances in adjuvant therapy.\r"

  ".W": "To define the role of percutaneous catheter drainage in the initial management of diverticular abscess, we reviewed 19 patients who were followed for an average of 17.4 months after drainage. All patients had large paracolic or pelvic abscesses with a mean size of 8.9 cm. There were no complications related to catheter placement, and 15 patients (79 percent) required drainage for less than 3 weeks. Sepsis resolved rapidly, and only two patients (11 percent) had persistent fever or leukocytosis beyond the third day of drainage. Routine sinography revealed fistulous communications to the colon in nine patients (47 percent), but only three (16 percent) had grossly feculent drainage. Fourteen patients (74 percent) completed the treatment plan of preoperative catheter drainage followed by single-stage sigmoid colectomy and primary anastomosis without complications. Two patients refused operation, one of whom died 16 days postoperatively from recurrent sepsis and end-stage pulmonary disease. The three patients with fecal fistulas all had inadequate control of infection, suggesting the need for early operation and fecal diversion in such cases. We conclude that preoperative percutaneous catheter drainage obviates the need for colostomy and multiple-stage surgery in approximately three-fourths of patients with large diverticular abscesses.\r"

  ".U": "90103222\r", 
  ".W": "In order to characterize intraluminal airway inflammation in subjects with chronic bronchitis, bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage were performed in 28 subjects with chronic bronchitis with fixed airway obstruction and, for comparison, 15 asymptomatic smokers and 25 normal nonsmoking volunteers. The chronic bronchitics had a cough productive of sputum on most days of the month for 6 months in the preceding 2 yr, had at least one exacerbation requiring medical intervention in each of the previous 2 yr, and had an FEV1 less than 76% of predicted without response to bronchodilator. During bronchoscopy the airways were assessed for visual evidence of inflammation by assigning them a score, the bronchitis index, that graded the airways according to the apparent severity of airway edema, erythema, friability, and secretions. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed by sequentially instilling and retrieving with gentle suction five 20-ml aliquots of sterile normal saline into each of three separate lobes. The first aliquots, the \"bronchial\" sample, were pooled and processed separately from the final four aliquots, the \"distal\" sample. Cell counts, cell differentials, and albumin were determined for both the bronchial and distal samples. In order to correlate inflammation with clinical parameters, sputum was collected for 24 h prior to bronchoscopy; spirometry was performed just prior to bronchoscopy, and smoking histories were obtained. Visual inspection of the airways, as quantified by the bronchitis index, demonstrated significantly more evidence for inflammation in the chronic bronchitics than in either the asymptomatic smokers or the normal subjects. The bronchial sample lavage fluids from the chronic bronchitics tended to contain more cells (6.1 +/- 2.2 x 10(6) cells) than the bronchial sample fluids from the asymptomatic smokers (3.6 +/- 0.6 x 10(6) cells) or normal subjects (3.7 +/- 0.5 x 10(6) cells). Furthermore, the chronic bronchitics had a higher percentage of neutrophils in their bronchial lavage fluid (35.8 +/- 5.6%) than did either the asymptomatic smokers (20.7 +/- 2.6%, p = 0.0001) or the normal subjects (10.3 +/- 5.6%). The distal sample lavage fluid also recovered more neutrophils from both the chronic bronchitics (15.0 +/- 4.2%, p = 0.0012) and asymptomatic smokers (5.7 +/- 1.3%, p = 0.002) than from the normal subjects (2.8 +/- 0.4%). The chronic bronchitics were divided into two groups: those with low (less than 20%) and those with high (greater than 20%) bronchial sample neutrophils. Those with higher bronchial sample neutrophils had significantly more sputum production and lower FEV1, FEV1/FVC, and FEF25-75 than did the subjects with lower bronchial sample neutrophils.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between general health measured using the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP), lung spirometry, arterial oxygen saturation during exercise, and six-minute walking distance was studied in 141 patients with chronic airflow limitation. In addition the patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Questionnaire and the Medical Research Council (MRC) Bronchitis Questionnaire. Their mean age was 63 years (range 31 to 75) and their mean FEV1 was 47 +/- 23 (SD)% of predicted normal. The SIP scores were lower (i.e., the patients had better general health) than in previously reported patients who had greater physiological disturbance, but the profile of the different category scores within the SIP was similar to previous findings. Walking distance correlated with the SIP better than any spirometric measure or arterial saturation and accounted for 41% of the variance in SIP (p less than 0.001). The SIP score was considerably higher in patients who wheezed every day compared with those who did not (p less than 0.005). In patients who reported that their breathing was not normal between acute attacks of breathlessness and wheeze, the SIP score was twice as high as in those who felt normal between attacks (p less than 0.0006). Walking distance, depression score, and MRC dyspnea score correlated with SIP score independently of each other. A multiple regression incorporating these three variables accounted for 62% of the total variance in SIP score. Age, sex, and response to bronchodilator were not correlated with SIP score. We conclude that the SIP provides a valid measure of general health in a population of patients with chronic airflow limitation.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of our study was to examine the nutritional status of patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (mean predicted FEV1, 30 +/- 11%) and to explore its relationship to functional capacity. Functional capacity was evaluated by measuring peak oxygen consumption (VO2max) using an incremental cycle ergometry test, a 6-min walk test, self-perceived level of dyspnea, and quality of life. The percentage ideal body weight (%IBW) was less than 90% in 33 of 135 subjects. Triceps skinfold thickness was less than 60% of normal in 19 of 33 of these subjects. Total lymphocyte count was not different between groups, whereas hemoglobin (14.9 versus 15.9 g/dl) and albumin (4.0 versus 4.1 g/dl) were marginally reduced in underweight subjects. Dyspnea and overall quality of life were unaffected by nutritional status. Maximal inspiratory (Pimax) and expiratory mouth pressures (PEmax) were weakly associated with %IBW (R2 = 0.04; p = 01 and R2 = 0.15; p less than 0.01, respectively). The %IBW was a predictor of VO2max (percent predicted) after controlling for FEV1 in regression analysis (partial R2 = 0.08; p less than 0.001). Despite the association of weight status with VO2max, the 6-min walk was not influenced by %IBW. The perceived intensity of exercise as judged by the Borg score was far greater with the bicycle exercise that with the 6-min walk (mean score, 10.6 +/- 1.2 versus 4.6 +/- 1.9). This was supported by the difference in heart rate after these two tests.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Recently, we reported the characteristic electrical and contractile changes of airway smooth muscle (ASM) preparations after administration of highly purified antiovalbumin immunoglobin G1 (IgG1). Because these changes are comparable to those we observed after administration of several phorbol esters, we theorized that sensitization of ASM with IgG1 leads to the activation of protein kinase-C. Therefore, in this study we examined the effect of two inhibitors of protein kinase-C on the sensitization-induced changes of ASM cells. ASM preparations were obtained from adult male guinea pigs (Camm-Hartley strain). Changes in both the resting membrane potential, as measured by a glass microelectrode technique, and changes in the isometric force, measured by a copper-beryllium strain gauge, were continuously monitored. Experiments were conducted at the optimal length of ASM preparations and a temperature of 37 degrees C. The preparations were pretreated with H-7 (1-(5-isoquinoilinyl-sulfonyl)-2-methyl piperazine) or NA-0345 (N,N-dimethylamino-methyl-SF2370) both protein kinase-C inhibitors, passively sensitized with IgG1 and consequently exposed to a specific antigen. We found that pretreatment inhibited the initial depolarization and the increase in the isometric force, usually observed after administration of IgG1, and that it attenuated ovalbumin-induced depolarization and sustained increase in the isometric force. These effects were concentration-dependent and were observed only when protein kinase-C inhibitors preceded administration of IgG1. Finally, H-7 pretreatment had no effect on KCl- or substance-P-induced physiologic changes but partially attenuated response to histamine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The chemotactic responses to autologous zymosan-activated serum (C5a) by neutrophils obtained from uninfected digoxin-treated and control animals were similar; comparable observations were made with circulating granulocytes isolated from animals at 24 or 48 h after intratracheal challenge with 5 x 10(5) colony-forming units (cfu) of bacteria. However, at 4 and 6 h after intratracheal pneumococcal challenge, the number of immature neutrophils in the peripheral blood was significantly lower in the glycoside-treated animals versus controls; at 24 and 48 h, these differences were not apparent. Following the intravenous inoculation of pneumococci, the number of circulating immature neutrophils was also found to be significantly lower at 4 and 24 h in animals given the cardiac glycoside versus controls. We conclude that digoxin disrupts host defense in experimental pneumococcal pneumonia and bacteremia by impairing the mobilization of neutrophils.\r"

The precise mechanism remains obscure, but some studies report a decrease in the number of beta-adrenergic receptors. The present study was designed to assess the effect of viral respiratory infection with influenza A on lung beta-adrenergic receptors and adenylate cyclase activation in mice under two separate protocols. First, to determine whether changes are due to a local or systemic effect, we compared mice with influenza infections limited to the upper respiratory tract to mice with infection of the total respiratory tract. Four days after upper respiratory tract infection there were no changes in either isoproterenol- or NaF-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. In contrast, there was an 82% decrease in isoproterenol- and a 25% decrease in NaF-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity on the fourth day after total respiratory tract infection. There were no changes in beta-adrenergic receptors or receptor coupling to adenylate cyclase with either type of infection. Our second protocol compared acutely infected mice to postrecovery mice. Twelve days after infection the virus was no longer present in the lungs, and adenylate cyclase activity was restored to normal. These data suggest that viral respiratory infection may impair airway function through attenuation of receptor and postreceptor activation of adenylate cyclase activity.\r"

Low concentrations were observed in Group I: Cmax = 65.6 +/- 9.4 micrograms/L (mean +/- SEM), contrasting with high levels in Group II: Cmax = 215.8 +/- 49.8 micrograms/L (mean +/- SEM). Consequently, the mean area under the curve from zero to 4 h was 2.6-fold higher in Group II than in Group I. These findings underline the risk of dose-related pentamidine toxicity in ventilated patients treated with aerosolized pentamidine and the interest of plasma pentamidine monitoring.\r"

By October 31, 1987, we had identified 163 positive specimens from 131 patients. All M. terrae were isolated from specimens obtained from non-sterile sites, i.e., respiratory, gastrointestinal, or urine. No clinical disease related to M. terrae occurred. Review of procedures and cultures of solutions used in the Microbiology Laboratory suggested the source of M. terrae was not in the Microbiology Laboratory. An analysis of case location showed an association with hospital tier (p less than 0.05), a pattern matching the design of the potable water system of the hospital. M. terrae was cultured from multiple outlets of this system. There appeared to be multiple modes of transmission of M. terrae from this reservoir. Control measures included avoidance of water sources during specimen collection and hyperchlorination of the potable water system. These measures appeared to result in the disappearance of M. terrae from subsequent clinical specimens. We believe this to be the first report defining the epidemiologic aspects of M. terrae contaminating clinical specimens.\r"

In patients with less advanced disease, elevated plasma levels of TNF alpha correlated with high levels of complexes between neutrophil elastase and alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor, suggesting that TNF alpha may be a mediator of neutrophil degranulation. TNF alpha, by its chemotactic effect on neutrophils, may also contribute to the massive influx of neutrophils into and around the bronchial tree. Our findings raise the questions whether in patients with cystic fibrosis TNF alpha acts as cachectin and whether it mediates the anorexia that often results in weight loss.\r"

We have recorded airway potentials from seven patients with CF who had undergone heart-lung transplantation and from eight patients without CF who had had transplants for cardiovascular disease; comparison of these populations controls for the effects of denervation and immunosuppressive treatment. Six patients without CF who had not had transplants formed an additional control. PD was recorded during routine fiberoptic bronchoscopy, using a Ringer's-perfused exploring bridge connected across a high impedance amplifier to an intravenous reference bridge. Bronchial lavage and sputum culture revealed no evidence of infection. Bronchial PD was similar in all three groups of patients at equivalent sites. However, nasal PD was raised in the CF group (mean value, 44 mV +/- 3.9 SE) compared with the patients who had transplants for cardiovascular disease (mean, 18 mV +/- 1.1 SE), and the control patients (mean, 15 mV +/- 1.2 SE). We conclude that the epithelial defects that result in raised airway potentials in CF do not recur in the transplanted lung.\r"

The intracellular consequences of the various substitution, deletion, and insertion mutations causing the Null state can be categorized into two groups: those associated with detectable alpha 1AT mRNA transcripts and those with no detectable alpha 1AT mRNA transcripts. To classify the intracellular mechanism associated with the Nullgranite falls allele (Tyr160 TAC, C deletion, 5' frameshift----Stop160 TAG), a Nullgranite falls homozygote was evaluated. Genotypic diagnosis of the Nullgranite falls homozygous state was determined using the polymerase chain reaction and Nullgranite falls specific primers. Total cellular RNA extracted from alveolar macrophages of the index case was compared to that from a normal M1 homozygote for the presence of alpha 1AT mRNA transcripts using Northern blot analysis and hybridization to either a 32P-labeled full length alpha 1AT cDNA probe or (as a control) a 32P-labeled gamma-actin cDNA probe. Although the macrophages of both the Nullgranite falls homozygote and the normal showed gamma-actin mRNA transcripts in comparable amounts, Nullgranite falls macrophages contained no detectable alpha 1AT mRNA transcripts whereas the normal had the expected 1.8 kb alpha 1AT mRNA transcripts. Thus, the Nullgranite falls allele can be classified along with Nullbellingham as a Null allele associated with no detectable alpha 1AT mRNA. These observations highlight the marked heterogeneity in the molecular processes causing the Null state, despite an identical phenotype at the clinical level.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined the effect of cigarette smoking on the fluidity of the rat alveolar macrophage plasma membrane. Rats were subjected to 8 wk of an in vivo smoke exposure protocol, after which their alveolar macrophages were harvested. Fluidity was assessed by measuring steady-state anisotropy of isolated plasma membranes as well as of lipid vesicles made from total lipid extracts of these plasma membranes. The smoke-exposed animals showed a significant decrease in fluidity in both intact plasma membranes (p less than 0.0001) and in their lipid vesicle preparations (p less than 0.0001). To assess the time course of these changes, lipid vesicles were prepared from total cellular lipid extracts of macrophages from paired rats, control and smoke-exposed, at 1 through 4 wk after initiation of exposure. Significant decreases in fluidity were observed as early as 2 wk after smoking was begun (p less than 0.001). To assess the reversibility of these changes, paired rats were exposed for 8 wk, then withdrawn for 8, 12, and 18 wk, after which fluidity was evaluated in lipid vesicles prepared from total cellular lipids. Even after 18 wk of smoking cessation, significant decreases in fluidity persisted (p less than 0.01). We conclude that cigarette smoking causes a decrease in plasma membrane fluidity of rat alveolar macrophages. This is due at least in part to a change in the lipid portion of the membrane. These alterations occur after a very brief period of smoke exposure and persist long after cessation of smoking.\r"

Alveolar macrophages from dust-exposed subjects, including those who had been free of exposure to particles for more than 1 yr, contained particles of higher proportion than did those of normal unexposed subjects. Most of these particles were located within phagolysosomes. The frequency of multinucleated alveolar macrophages was significantly higher in the dust-exposed groups. Ultrastructural studies showed alterations of the morphologic aspects of the surfaces of alveolar macrophages from the dust-exposed subjects, including increased numbers of rufflings, filopodia, pinocytotic vesicles, subplasmalemmal linear densities, and increased frequency of macrophage-macrophage and macrophage-lymphocyte interactions. Furthermore, the numbers of lysosomes were significantly increased in alveolar macrophages from the dust-exposed subjects. Together, these morphologic changes are consistent with the sequelae of phagocytosis, and they emphasize both the role of alveolar macrophages in eliminating inorganic particles from the alveolar spaces and the consequences this role has in alveolar macrophage activation.\r"

Conversely, in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, sarcoidosis, and certain inflammatory diseases, increased amounts of IL-1 are released by alveolar macrophages (AM). We examined IL-1 production by AM from patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and compared it with that in patients with severe pneumonia requiring assisted ventilation, patients with pneumonia requiring parenteral antibiotics, and healthy control subjects. In vitro, ARDS AM released significantly more total IL-1 and IL-1 beta than did ARDS AM in patients with pneumonia and in control subjects. Moreover, after stimulation of these cells with 10 micrograms/ml of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), ARDS AM significantly increased release of IL-1 and IL-1 beta. AM from patients with severe pneumonia also released greater amounts of both IL-1 and IL-1 beta as fresh explants and after LPS stimulation when compared with control subjects. Incubation of AM with 250 U/ml human interferon-gamma (gamma IFN) was associated with less IL-1 beta release. However, stimulating AM from patients with ARDS and severe pneumonia with gamma IFN plus LPS enhanced the release of IL-1 beta compared with that in patients with pneumonia and in control subjects. ARDS AM released significantly more IL-1 beta than did all of the other groups. These results demonstrate that AM from patients with ARDS are capable of releasing significantly greater amounts of IL-1, which may be related to the progression of acute lung injury.\r"

We studied lung biopsies from 30 patients with pulmonary fibrosis, using immunohistochemistry with monoclonal antibodies against the propeptides of type I collagen to localize fibroblasts actively synthesizing collagen. Adjacent sections were stained with antibodies to type III and IV collagen, fibrin, cytokeratin, plasma fibronectin, or EDIIIa-containing \"cellular\" fibronectin (cFN). In rapid pulmonary fibrosis, including the proliferative phase of diffuse alveolar damage, organizing pneumonia, and subacute idiopathic fibrosis, collagen-synthesizing cells were numerous in organizing exudate filling airspaces but were also seen in the interstitium of the alveolar walls, interlobular septa, and walls of blood vessels. The new matrix deposited in the airspaces also contained type III collagen and EDIIIa-containing fibronectin. In chronic pulmonary fibrosis, more than half of the biopsies showed foci of collagen synthesis and cFN deposition near the air-tissue interface. The foci were consistently localized outside remnants of basal lamina and therefore within airspaces. The results indicate that (1) fibrosis in chronic idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis results mainly from organization of exudate within airspaces, just as it does after acute lung injury, and (2) during this process, fibroblasts increase their synthesis of collagen and fibronectin coordinately. Foci of active matrix deposition provide evidence for the progressive nature of chronic pulmonary fibrosis.\r"

Groups of 6 male guinea pigs, sensitized with ovalbumin, were pretreated with U-75302, 1.0, 10.0, or 30.0 mg/kg, or vehicle 1 h before and 7 h after antigen inhalation. Twenty-four hours after antigen provocation, the lungs were lavaged for the enumeration of inflammatory cell populations. Doses of U-75302 (1.0, 10.0 and 30.0 mg/kg) administered orally produced 12.2%, (p greater than 0.05), 43.2% (p less than 0.05), and 61.1% (p less than 0.05) inhibition, respectively, of the antigen-induced influx of eosinophils into the bronchial lumen. Neutrophil populations were not significantly affected by treatment with U-75302. In a separate study, we compared the histopathological changes that occurred following antigen challenge in U-75302-treated or vehicle-treated guinea pigs. Vehicle-treated, sensitized animals exhibited marked changes in the airway at 8 min, 6 h, and 24 h after antigen challenge. U-75302 treatment produced a significant reduction in eosinophil adherence to peribronchial/peribronchiolar capillaries followed by a dramatic and specific reduction of peribronchial eosinophil infiltration (81% reduction at 6 h and 79% reduction at 24 h). Neutrophil migration appeared unaffected. These data implicate LTB4 as a mediator of antigen-induced bronchopulmonary eosinophilia in the guinea pig.\r"

In addition, the lungs of four premature and seven mechanically ventilated infants were studied. A computer-assisted digitizer was used to measure airway diameter and to determine the area of cartilage, gland, and muscle in each type of airway. Epithelial height was also measured, and goblet cell number was counted. Using histochemical stains, types of glycoprotein were identified in goblet cells and submucosal glands. Between 22 wk of gestation and 8 months of age, the normal infant showed a linear increase with age in airway diameter. With age the area of muscle and submucosal gland increased in total amount and showed a significant linear increase when related to the size of the airways, except the submucosal gland in hilar airways. By contrast, the increase in cartilage was only commensurate with the increase in size of intrapulmonary airways, but showed a linear size-related increase in the main bronchus. Epithelial height and goblet cell number increased with age in the bronchi, but not more peripherally. Premature infants had for their postconceptional age normal-sized airways with an increase in amount of bronchial smooth muscle and an increase in number of goblet cells. Ventilated infants had a greater increase in smooth muscle (p less than 0.05 to p less than 0.002) and goblet cells (p less than 0.05) and an increase in submucosal gland area (p less than 0.04) whether or not the infant had had hyaline membrane disease.\r"

The length of time that the foreign body was in the lung was less than 1 wk in six (acute group), more than 1 month in 21 (chronic group), and uncertain in two (uncertain group), and the foreign body was an endogenous broncholith in four patients (broncholith group). The foreign bodies were nonfragile, solid matter in most cases and they frequently had sharp projections on them. Granulations around the foreign body were common in the chronic group, but there was no correlation between the length of time the foreign body was in the lung and the amount of granulation or the number of the bronchoscopies needed for diagnosis or management. The granulations did not bleed easily on biopsy or during removal of the foreign body. In fact, they receded if several pieces were removed, making the foreign body much easier to recognize and to retrieve in the next bronchoscopy (about 1 wk later). After removal of the foreign body, the residual granulations regressed, and the bronchial lumen became more patent. The mortality, morbidity, and complication rates were very low, whereas the success rate was high. We conclude that flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy is practical and safe in retrieving bronchial foreign bodies in adult patients.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the mechanisms of airway hyperresponsiveness induced by viral infection, we examined histologically and analyzed bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid using dogs infected with influenza C and noninfected control dogs. Airway responsiveness was assessed as inhaled acetylcholine concentration required to increase pulmonary resistance by 5 cm H2O/L/s (ACh PC). Airway responsiveness was determined before and 2 wk after virus or vehicle inoculation in infected and control dogs, and BAL and histologic studies were performed after the final challenge. Differential cell numbers and histamine concentration were determined in the BAL fluids of both groups. The ACh PC of control dogs did not change with the vehicle inoculation. However, that of infected dogs decreased two to five times as much as their initial value with viral infection. Histologic studies revealed diffuse epithelial damage in the central airways of infected dogs, but infiltrated cell counts within the airway tissue of both groups were not significantly different. From BAL analysis, mast cell number and the histamine concentration of infected dogs increased significantly compared with those of control dogs (3.1 +/- 0.4 x 10(5) versus 0.9 +/- 0.3 x 10(5) cells/ml and 7.3 +/- 1.7 versus 1.9 +/- 0.5 ng/ml, respectively). Luminal mast cell number and epithelial damage score in each dog was correlated with the increase in airway responsiveness. These findings indicate that airway inflammation in virus-induced hyperreactive dogs is characterized by epithelial damage and luminal increase in mast cells and related mediators, and these changes may be related to the appearance of virus-induced airway hyperreactivity.\r"

Rats were exposed to 50 ppm NO2 for 5 h a day for 7 consecutive days, and microscopic findings were assessed subjectively and quantitatively. Destruction of airway epithelium was present on Day 1, and the reparative phase was observed between Days 3 and 7. Light microscopy showed that on Day 1, loss of cilia and disintegration of epithelium occurred, and that the latter was worse in major bronchi than in terminal bronchioles; apical projections of Clara cells in terminal bronchioles were lost almost totally. Recovery of epithelium began by Day 3 and cilia by Day 5, and ciliogenesis progressed less promptly in terminal bronchioles. Clara cells did not return to normal during the experiment. Furthermore, a decrease in the airway diameter occurred in peripheral airways along with an increase in mural thickness in terminal bronchioles. Mural inflammation was also seen more conspicuously in terminal bronchioles. Electron microscopy revealed that epithelial cells lost secretory granules on Day 1 and began to repair them by Day 5 in major bronchi and by Day 7 in terminal bronchioles. It is likely that epithelium in terminal bronchioles is not particularly sensitive to NO2 compared with that in major bronchi, but that recovery occurs more promptly in major bronchi than in terminal bronchioles. Mechanisms underlying bronchoconstriction occurring preferentially in peripheral airways are also discussed.\r"

For each subject and machine, we calculated the coefficient of variation (CV) of the DLCO and its associated alveolar volume (VA) and inspiratory vital capacity (IVC) over the five different measurement periods using the mean value for each period. CV (in %) for DLCO in each of the eight subjects for each machine varied from 2.4 to 7.1% for machine C, 4.1 to 10.5% for machine G, and 2.5 to 8.7% for machine S. Two-way ANOVA showed significant differences in CV for DLCO and IVC but not for VA across subjects (p less than 0.01) and for DLCO, VA, and IVC across machines (p less than 0.03): CV for DLCO was higher for G than for C or S; CV for VA and IVC was lower for C than for G or S. Multiple regression did not show a significant relationship between within-individual CV for DLCO and that for VA or IVC. We conclude that variability in DLCO measurements is affected by both subject and machine, but, at least in healthy cooperative subjects, it does not appear to be affected by variability in VA or IVC. For the average subject and the two less variable machines we tested, DLCO measurements could vary within the same subject as much as +/- 9.6% (two-tailed 95% confidence interval) with repeated measurements over 1 yr.\r"

All patients were able to precisely estimate the average length of their cigarette butts, and they left butts of consistent lengths. There was no association between the numbers of cigarettes smoked and the butt lengths. Carboxyhemoglobin levels were positively associated with the numbers of cigarettes smoked in 24 h and negatively associated with the butt length and the time elapsed since the last cigarette was smoked, but these were not associated with the amount of tar in the cigarettes or with the number of years the person had smoked.\r"

We found that addition of neutrophil cytoplasts and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) caused less edematous injury in isolated lungs than addition of neutrophils and PMA. However, addition of neutrophil elastase along with neutrophil cytoplasts and PMA increased the amounts of lung injury found in lungs perfused with neutrophil cytoplasts and PMA to levels that equaled the amount of lung injury found after addition of normal neutrophils and PMA. By comparison, addition of purified neutrophil elastase, PMA alone, or human neutrophils alone did not cause lung injury. The results indicate that neutrophil elastase is a necessary component for the maximal development of acute edematous injury in isolated lungs perfused with neutrophils and PMA.\r"

The exposure level exceeds the US Short-Term Exposure Limit (STEL) of 5 ppm, but occurs as peak exposures in industrial indoor environments. Exposures were made during light work on a bicycle ergometer in an environmental exposure chamber for 20 min. BAL was performed 2 wk or more before exposure and 4, 8, 24, and 72 h after exposure in eight subjects at each time interval. Four hours after exposure significant increases were found in the numbers of lysozyme-positive macrophages, lymphocytes, and mast cells (p less than 0.02 to 0.05). Lymphocytes, lysozyme-positive macrophages, total count of alveolar macrophages, and total cell number increased to peak values 24 h after exposure (p less than 0.02 to 0.05). Seventy-two hours after exposure the cell numbers and distribution had returned to normal. The time course of the cell reactions found in BAL fluid after controlled SO2 exposure represents a new and previously not reported response to a noxious gas.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-four cases of emergency cricothyroidotomy performed formed from September 1984 through January 1988 are reviewed. Thirty-one of the cases were required out of 2,200 acute-trauma patients. The indication for cricothyroidotomy was inability to establish an airway by intubation usually in a situation of possible neck injury or severe facial trauma. Fourteen of the patients died as a result of their injuries, 13 of these in the first several hours after injury. The 20 surviving patients are studied in two groups: eleven patients whose cricothyroidotomy remained in place until decannulation (group I) and nine patients who underwent tracheostomy subsequent to cricothyroidotomy (group II). Clinical follow-up included physical examination in all survivors and endoscopic evaluation in twelve patients. Three minor complications were discovered in each of the two groups and two major complications were noted in group II. The major complications included a case of tracheal stomal stenosis requiring tracheal resection and a case of partially obstructing tracheal granulation tissue requiring endoscopic resection. This study supports the use of emergency cricothyroidotomy in situations in which intubation is not successful or thought to be safe. Data is also presented that suggests that tracheostomy subsequent to emergency cricothyroidotomy does not necessarily reduce airway-related morbidity in these patients.\r"

However, at the present time there is no consensus on the appropriate follow-up protocol for such patients. This investigation was undertaken to determine which tests and procedures are most useful in detecting recurrence and the frequency with which they should be employed. Another purpose of this study was to identify those patients at high risk for recurrence. Sixty-five patients who underwent curative resection of adenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum were followed for at least two years or until recurrence. Thirty were classified as Duke's A carcinoma of the colon, 18 were Duke's B, and 17 were Duke's C. Mean follow-up was 44.9 months. The follow-up regimen consisted of clinical exam, liver function tests, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, and chest x-ray every three months for the first two years postoperatively and every six months thereafter, and colonoscopy or barium enema and proctoscopy every six months for the first two years postoperatively and every year thereafter. Seventeen patients (26%) had a recurrence; 24% per cent of these developed within one year, 65 per cent developed within two years, 82 per cent developed within three years, and 94 per cent developed within four years of resection. Recurrence was detected by CEA in eight patients, chest x-ray in five, endoscopy in three, and laparotomy for small-bowel obstruction in one patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirteen patients (39%) were right sided and 19 (56%) were left sided. One patient sustained bilateral ruptures. The mean Injury Severity Score (ISS) in both those that lived and those that died was not significantly different when right- and left-sided injuries were compared. Admission chest films were abnormal in 28 patients and diagnostic in nine patients (27%). The chest x ray was abnormal in 10 (78%) of those with right-sided injury. Twenty-three patients had diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL); 19 were initially positive, two were initially negative but became positive on relavage. There were two false-negative lavages. CT scan (4 patients) and barium enema (1 patient) were nondiagnostic. Diagnosis was delayed in four patients, two were diagnosed by repeat chest x ray and two by repeat lavage. All patients had multiple associated injuries, with 82 per cent having concomitant intra-abdominal injuries. All patients were explored via the transabdominal route. Complications occurred in 55 per cent and there were eight deaths (24%), all unrelated to the diaphragmatic injury. There was no relationship to mortality and hemidiaphragm injured. Chest x ray remains the single most beneficial diagnostic test for diaphragmatic injury. DPL is an insensitive test for isolated diaphragm injuries; however, the combination of CXR and DPL will lead to the diagnosis in the majority of cases. Ancillary radiologic tests are not beneficial. An elevated or obscured right hemidiaphragm should raise suspicion for blunt rupture.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The total cost for administration of prophylactic antibiotics was reduced from an average of $37.35 per case for the six months preceding the start of these restrictive policies to an average of $21.99 per case during the next twelve months. Class I and class II wound-infection rates were 2.0 per cent and 4.9 per cent, respectively, prior to the adoption of the new antibiotic practices. Comparable infection rates were 1.8 per cent and 2.1 per cent, respectively, after this program was initiated. The rising cost of antibiotic prophylaxis can be reduced without adversely affecting wound-infection rates.\r"

  ".W": "A crucial shortage of organ donors exists in the United States. The majority of donor referrals come from large (greater than 500) beds) hospitals and trauma centers. To determine whether a significant number of donors who are not being recognized or referred also existed in medium-sized (300 beds) community hospitals, a Donor Advocacy Program was instituted at Francis Scott Key Medical Center in May 1987. This team developed policies and procedures to identify potential donors and conducted educational programs for physicians and nurses. A designated \"Donor Advocate\" made daily rounds on the inpatient units to maintain donor awareness and facilitate potential donations. After the first year, the program was evaluated. In comparison to the average of the previous three years, donor referrals increased by approximately 400 per cent and tissue donations increased over 500 per cent. Four organs were retrieved from two donors. It is concluded that an increase in referrals and tissue donations can be achieved at community hospitals through a structured donor awareness program. Recommendations are made to further examine the age group most often eligible for organ and tissue donations in community hospitals and target educational efforts accordingly. Commitment of hospital administration is vital to a positive outcome in such a program.\r"

Twenty-eight patients developed cecal pseudo-obstruction (cecal diameter ave., 13.6 cm +/- 2.0; range, 10-18 cm) and 25 of these 28 (89%) were hospitalized for nonabdominal problems. Significant comorbidities existed in all patients. Multimodal therapy was used in most: nasogastric (NG) suction (100%), rectal tube (64%), laxatives (64%), enemas (57%), Colonoscopy (57%), and surgery (25%). Twelve of 18 patients receiving rectal tubes, 14 of 18 receiving laxatives, 11 of 16 receiving enemas, and 12 of 16 (75%) undergoing colonoscopy avoided surgery; colonoscopy cured 44 per cent of the patients, was useless in 38 per cent, was detrimental in 6 per cent, and was temporizing in 12 per cent. Seven of the 28 patients (5 cecostomy, 2 right hemicolectomy) underwent surgery. Four of the seven patients (57%) had significant surgical complications such as wound infection, incisional hernia, cecal prolapse with infarction/death, and evisceration/death. Twenty-four patients of the 28 (86%) survived the index admission; Two of four patients died of the systemic problems that brought on cecal pseudo-obstruction and two of four patients died as a result of cecostomy complications. Pseudo-obstruction occurs in older, debilitated patients generally hospitalized because of nonabdominal problems. Treatment should be aimed at correcting the underlying cause; multimodalities often temporize until underlying problems are corrected and pseudo-obstruction resolves. Colonoscopy is often curative, occasionally helpful, and rarely harmful. Surgery is curative but carries significant risks. Uncomplicated cecal dilatation to 10-18 cm is tolerated; early operative intervention should not be dictated by cecal size alone.\r"

  ".W": "Numerous investigators have reported the safety, cost effectiveness, and low morbidity and mortality of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) but not studies compare the results of gastroenterologists and surgeons performing PEG. In a retrospective review of PEG performed at our institution, morbidity and mortality were compared between these two groups. The procedure was performed by either the surgical service (n = 49) or gastroenterology service (n = 51). One hundred PEGs were successfully placed in 92 patients. Three placement failures occurred in the gastroenterology group. Major complications were defined as conditions requiring operative intervention or resulting in death. Minor complications, using a defined list (13 different complications), were those not serious or life-threatening, which were managed medically or resolved without treatment. Twenty-nine minor (17 patients) complications and 3 major (3 patients) complications occurred in the gastroenterology group. Thirteen minor (11 patients) complications and 4 major (4 patients) complications occurred in the surgery group. Overall 30-day mortality was 14 per cent (13 patients), two of which were probably procedure-related in the gastroenterology group. In both groups, there was no difference in the numbers of patients who had complications (P greater than 0.05). The complication rate (numbers of complications/number of patients) doubled in the gastroenterology group compared with the surgery group for minor (P less than 0.04) and total complications (minor and major--P less than 0.06). Since PEG is a procedure frequently performed by gastroenterologists, it is imperative that surgeons, particularly those not performing endoscopy, be aware of the potential morbidity associated with PEG.\r"

During the past seven years 154 patients underwent PCD for treatment of abdominal abscesses. Fourteen of these patients had PCD as the initial treatment for IAA secondary to a perforated viscus and subsequently underwent an elective one-stage operation to treat the underlying disease. Etiologies of the abscesses included perforated appendicitis in six patients, sigmoid diverticulitis in three patients, Crohn's ileitis in two patients, and one case each of perforated gastric ulcer, perforated sigmoid carcinoma, and perforated gallbladder. Initial localization of the abscess was achieved by either CT or ultrasound. Seven abscesses were localized in the right lower quadrant, four were localized in the liver, and one was localized each in the left flank, right flank, subhepatic space, and pelvis. All patients subsequently underwent a definitive elective operation for their primary disease including six interval appendectomies, four sigmoid colectomies, two small-bowel resections, one subtotal gastrectomy and one cholecystectomy. There were no complications due to PCD and no deaths occurred. We conclude that PCD can be successfully performed as the initial treatment for IAA associated with a perforated viscus, obviating the first stage of the traditional two-stage surgical approach.\r"

The extent of burn was charted weekly during hospitalization and rate of wound healing was calculated using linear regression analysis. The mean total percent burn was 26.2 per cent (range, 4-85%). The overall mortality rate was 40 per cent. Mortality rate increased sharply by decade from 17.4 per cent for those aged 50-59 years to 100 per cent for the five patients age 90 and more. Excision and grafting were performed in 40 patients; 35 patients were not operated upon. Although hospitalization was somewhat longer in patients treated surgically, survival was better. Excision and grafting should be used when needed to achieve rapid wound closure in patients more than fifty years of age.\r"

  ".W": "Mastectomy is frequently performed after intensive chemotherapy for locally advanced breast cancer. The effects of preoperative chemotherapy on the postoperative course and the timing of subsequent adjuvant therapy, however, have not been defined. We therefore reviewed the perioperative course of 54 patients undergoing mastectomy after combination (CAMFPT) chemotherapy for stage IIIA,B (IIIA - 25 pts; IIIB noninflammatory - 5 pts; IIIB inflammatory-24 patients) breast cancer. A median of 7 cycles (6 months) of chemotherapy was administered preoperatively. Mastectomy was performed a median of 20 days after last chemotherapy; white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet counts returned to normal limits preoperatively. Total mastectomy with or without axillary node dissection was performed in 53 patients, and a Halsted radical mastectomy in 1 patient. Negative margins on breast and/or axillary tissue were achieved in 47 patients (87.0%). Postoperative complications included skin flap necrosis in 8 patients (14.8%), seroma formation in 5 patients (9.3%), and wound infection in 1 patient (1.9%). Median operative blood loss (550 cc), hospital stay (8 days), and duration of wound catheter drainage (6 days) were comparable to published reports for modified radical mastectomy without preoperative chemotherapy. Systemic chemotherapy was resumed a median of 16 days after mastectomy, and radiotherapy started a median of 33 days after mastectomy. These findings indicate that intensive preoperative chemotherapy does not increase the hospital course or the postoperative complications of mastectomy for locally advanced breast cancer. In view of the current interest in treatment of stage I and II breast cancer with preoperative chemotherapy, this information may be useful in their management as well.\r"

The patients were 30 +/- 2 years old (+/- SE) with initial serum sodium of 140 +/- 1 mmol/L. They all awoke from analgesia but, 32 hours after completion of the procedure, they went from alertness to respiratory arrest in less than 1 hour. At this time, serum sodium was 116 +/- 2 mmol/L and blood glucose was 6.7 +/- 0.7 mmol/L. Without treatment for the hyponatremia, urine output spontaneously increased from 38 to 689 mL/h and urine osmolality fell from 546 to 83 mmol/kg body weight. Over the next 51 hours, blood glucose rose to a high of 24.1 +/- 2.5 mmol/L while serum sodium rose to a high of 167 +/- 2 mmol/L. None of the patients regained consciousness. At autopsy, all patients had cerebral edema with herniation along with hypoxic brain damage. The pituitary showed infarction of both anterior and posterior lobes in 7 of 7 patients examined, while 8 of 11 had necrosis of the medulla and 8 of 8 patients examined had hypothalamic necrosis. All had normal pancreas and kidneys at autopsy. Soon after respiratory arrest, all of the patients developed fixed, dilated pupils that often led to the diagnosis of brain death. Autopsy showed compression of the third cranial nerve (oculomotor) because of cerebral herniation. Thus, all of the patients were diagnosed as being brain dead when some may have been saved. These data suggest that in otherwise healthy young women, untreated symptomatic hyponatremia may lead to brain edema, cerebral herniation, and infarction of pituitary and hypothalamus, resulting in central diabetes insipidus and mellitus.\r"

DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study of a cohort of perimenopausal women (mean age, 50.8 years). SETTING: Community volunteers in a university hospital. SUBJECTS: One hundred twenty-four white volunteers established as perimenopausal by history and serum concentrations of estrogens and follicle-stimulating hormone. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Models were constructed to predict bone mass in the radius, lumbar spine, and hip using risk factors (age, height, weight, calcium and caffeine intake, alcohol and tobacco use, and urinary markers of bone turnover). Although highly significant predictive models were developed for all skeletal sites, none of the models correctly identified more than 70% of women with low bone mass at any site. However, for the radius, a model was constructed that never overestimated bone mass by more than 0.10 g/cm. A small subgroup (7%) with short stature, low body weight, low calcium intake, and who were heavy smokers always had low radial bone mass. Using these models, about 30% of our population could be assessed without bone mass measurements. Predictions for the spine and femur were less efficient, suggesting that direct measurements are required if therapy decisions are to be based on bone mass at these sites. CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for osteoporosis are of limited use in identifying women with low bone mass around the time of menopause. Measurements of bone mass are probably necessary if the risk for osteoporosis is to be the basis for deciding on estrogen replacement therapy.\r"

Preoperative computed tomographs are also taken at angles different from those encountered in the surgical setting. As a result, the appropriate angle and depth of instrument insertion can fail to be appreciated. In order to study those angles and depths in a setting that more closely resembles the clinical situation in the operating room, we have performed 15 cadaver dissections and measured 14 dimensions relevant to the endoscopic approach. We recommend that cadaver dissection be an important part of continued training in sinus surgery. We also recommend that a reference probe be place along the floor of the nose and that endoscopic instruments be calibrated at 1-cm intervals so that the depth of insertion can be monitored by an observer or instructor.\r"

Only 4 patients (2%) developed recurrence at the primary site. The neck was the most common site for recurrent disease (39/47 or 83%), which in 35 patients appeared in the undissected, contralateral side. The risk to the contralateral side of the neck in patients with midline (epiglottic) lesions was similar to that in those with unilateral (aryepiglottic fold) lesions. Supraglottic laryngectomy, when properly selected, did not compromise primary control in the larynx. Radiation therapy was ineffective in controlling metastasis to the contralateral side of the neck in 16 of 99 patients (16%). Therefore, routine bilateral neck dissection should be considered in the surgical treatment of supraglottic carcinoma for control of regional disease.\r"

A Kay Elemetrics DSP Sona-Graph, model 5500, was used to analyze a complex vocal figure of five consecutive voice qualities, three of which were nasal, and two, oral. Simultaneous velolaryngeal videoendoscopy proved to be of great value for the understanding of the interaction of velar and laryngeal functions and for clarifying the mechanisms of nasal and twang qualities.\r"

The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), an indicator of the severity of head injury, may help identify that subpopulation of trauma victims who will ultimately undergo tracheotomy. This retrospective study demonstrates through discriminant analysis that the likelihood of tracheotomy is significantly greater in patients with a GCS rating less than or equal to 7 than it is in patients with a GCS rating greater than 7 (p = .0001). Conversely, the presence of thoracoabdominal or maxillofacial injury is associated with but not predictive of eventual tracheotomy. In the hope of minimizing complications and enhancing the utilization of hospital resources, this study argues for early tracheotomy in patients with a GCS score less than or equal to 7 who do not undergo craniotomy and are otherwise stable.\r"

The patient had a 4-year history of severe iron deficiency anemia, a 2-year history of progressive dysphagia and weight loss, and a greater than 90% benign upper esophageal stricture. Iron therapy alone resolved her dysphagia and anemia, and a follow-up esophagram 1 year later showed a residual stenosis of less than 30%. The development of severe iron deficiency anemia in this patient 2 years before the onset of dysphagia, as well as the response of the stricture to iron repletion, supports the theory that iron deficiency can cause dysphagia and upper esophageal strictures. The occurrence of glossitis, gastritis, and esophagitis in iron deficiency demonstrates the adverse effects of iron depletion on the rapidly proliferating cells of the upper alimentary tract.\r"

In five animals who underwent oral endotracheal intubation, epithelial erosions and submucosal inflammation in the proximal (bronchial) airway covered 34.9% and 71.3% of the luminal circumference, respectively. This was highly significant (p less than .001) against two control animals, in which 4.8% erosion and 3.9% inflammation were observed. Tracheotomy in three animals caused 22.8% bronchial epithelial erosion and 46.0% inflammation, which were not significantly greater than values of 15.0% and 20.6% observed following \"sham\" tracheotomy. The severity of the proximal (indirect) consequences of endotracheal intubation may have been attributable to the lack of humidification, but this does not explain the lesser damage caused by tracheotomy. It is postulated that increased inspiratory flow rate and pressures occurring in endotracheally intubated animals may be contributory factors.\r"

Topical application of epidermal growth factor (EGF), a potent mitogen for epidermal and mesodermal cells, promotes healing of injuries in tissues histologically similar to TM, such as cornea and skin. We evaluated TM as a target tissue for EGF action. Specific, high affinity receptors for EGF were detected in TM (Kd = 3.1 nM, 150 fmol receptor/mg protein). Autoradiography of iodine 125-EGF binding to intact TMs revealed that EGF receptors were present on cells in the stratified squamous epithelial layer and in the stromal/mucoepithelial layer. Repetitive treatment of perforated cat TMs with 20 micrograms of EGF formulated in saline induced substantial hyperplasia of epithelial and stromal layers compared to paired TMs treated with saline. A single treatment of perforated cat TMs with 50 micrograms of EGF formulated in a hydrogel or in shredded Gelfoam produced significantly (p less than .05) smaller perforations at 6 days following the operation compared to paired TMs treated with vehicles. These results demonstrate that TM is a target tissue for EGF and that topical treatment with EGF stimulates healing of TM perforations.\r"

All of these 30 patients presented with progressive external ophthalmoplegia and limb weakness, and 8 had the additional features of the Kearns-Sayre syndrome. Of the 42 patients without detectable muscle mtDNA deletions, 10 had progressive external ophthalmoplegia and limb weakness, 2 had the Kearns-Sayre syndrome, 11 had limb weakness without extraocular involvement, and 19 had multisystem disorders predominantly affecting the central nervous system. Only 2 patients with mtDNA deletions had clinically affected relatives, compared with 10 of those without deletions. In the 4 patients with polarographic defects exclusively involving complex I (NADH coenzyme Q reductase), the deleted protein-coding genes were confined to those for complex I subunits. Thirteen other patients with apparently identical deletions had variable clinical and biochemical features. Immunoblots of complex I polypeptides from patients with deletions were either indistinguishable from controls or showed only a mild generalized decrease in all identifiable subunits.\r"

Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) to electrical stimulation of the median nerve on the left or right side were averaged and mapped out over the scalp. Stimulation on the side opposite to the missing hemisphere evoked brief P9 and P14 farfields and a slow N18 negative potential of 15- to 25-msec duration bilaterally. No additional focal response was detected over the remaining (ipsilateral) hemisphere for 60 msec after the stimulus. Because long-standing hemispherectomy entails massive retrograde degeneration of thalamocortical neurons, the preserved P14 and N18 responses must reflect neural activities generated below the thalamus that are volume conducted to the scalp bilaterally. The data clarify several current issues in the evaluation of SEP components.\r"

  ".W": "Coughing in response to irritation of the airways is a fundamental protective reflex that is dependent on rapidly adapting bronchopulmonary receptors and their vagal afferent fibers; reflex airway constriction, which is effected by vagomotor efferent fibers, usually accompanies coughing. Although dysfunction of vagally mediated cardiovascular and gastrointestinal reflexes is a well-documented complication of autonomic neuropathy, to date there have been no studies of the effect of peripheral autonomic failure on the cough reflex. In the study reported here, we examined the effect of acrylamide-induced neuropathy, a distal axonopathy, on the ventilatory and tracheomotor components of the cough reflex in conscious dogs. There was a reduction in the cough reflex in response to mechanical irritation of the large airways in the preclinical phase of the neuropathy, and the cough reflex was virtually abolished when the dogs had moderate neuropathy. Following withdrawal of the neurotoxin, there was a substantial recovery of the cough reflex in surviving animals. It is possible that the cough reflex may be reduced in patients with vagal neuropathy and that this might compromise protection of the airway.\r"

Although gliomas have a high density of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding site, PET scans with a selective ligand for this site, [11C] Ro5-4864, failed to demonstrate higher radioactivity levels in human gliomas than in brain. In vitro studies of surgically removed specimens of human glioma demonstrated little binding of Ro5-4864 but high levels of binding of another selective ligand, PK 11195. Scans with [11C]PK 11195 demonstrated increased radioactivity in glioma compared to brain in 8 of 10 patients. Radioactivity in tumor and the ratios of radioactivity in tumor to that in remote gray and in white matter correlated significantly with the specific activity of [11C]PK 11195, suggesting that accumulation represents saturable high-affinity binding. We conclude that the PK 11195 manifests greater binding than Ro5-4864 to the peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding site on human gliomas and that human gliomas can be successfully imaged using [11C]PK 11195 and PET.\r"

Strokes were embolic in origin; that is, hemodynamic and in situ thrombotic stroke mechanisms had been excluded. Embolically active, cardiac disease was proved in 42 and was clinically evident in 13 patients. Five patients had suffered a stroke due to catheter-related embolism. Computed tomography revealed pial artery territorial infarction in 55 patients (92%). In 5, the infarction had the size or location (or both) characteristic of lacunes, although shape and lack of multiplicity raised questions about this interpretation. No patient showed a low-flow type of infarction pattern. These findings strongly support the view that (1) except for in situ thrombosis, pial artery territorial infarctions are indicative of an embolic mechanism, and (2) that the mechanism underlying lacunes is hardly, if ever, embolic.\r"

Antibodies to tyrosine hydroxylase, a marker for nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, and to calcineurin, a marker for striatonigral projection fibers, were used in this study. There was a marked depletion of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of parkinsonian patients compared with control subjects, the reduction being greater in the lateral portion than in the medial portion (p less than 0.001). Calcineurin immunoreactivity was densely distributed throughout the substantia nigra of patients with Parkinson's disease and control subjects. The numbers of dopaminergic neurons and of calcineurin-immunoreactive fibers were markedly reduced in the lateral portion of the substantia nigra in all patients with striatonigral degeneration. Our results suggest that many symptoms of these two diseases may be due to disruption of the functions of the putamen and the lateral portion of the substantia nigra, which have dense reciprocal connections as part of the dopamine-related nigrostriatal loop.\r"

The most elevated levels of alpha-TNF were found in patients with inflammatory or autoimmune diseases. Comparable serum levels of alpha-TNF were detected in normal control subjects, patients with multiple sclerosis, and patients with degenerative neurological diseases. In patients with multiple sclerosis, alpha-TNF levels were also unrelated to time elapsed between the occurrence of clinical exacerbation and the time of sample collection. Only 3 patients with chronic progressive multiple sclerosis had detectable alpha-TNF in the cerebrospinal fluid. Our data do not support a role for elevated levels of circulating alpha-TNF in the maintenance of the disease.

Changes in the appearance of defects were independent of the presence or degree of reflux at presentation and of symptomatic recurrence of infection, though the combination of new infection and grade 3 reflux (reflux reaching the renal calices with distension) was associated with deterioration. No kidney with a relative DMSA uptake of less than 35% showed any improvement in its cortical defects. Only two kidneys that were initially without defects, in a single patient who had bilateral grade 3 reflux and breakthrough infections, developed defects on subsequent scans. The outcome after urinary tract infection is dependent on the effect of the first infection on the kidney. Occasionally children with grade 3 reflux develop damage during subsequent infections. More widespread use of DMSA scans should improve our understanding of the factors that determine the development of renal damage.\r"

Eleven patients with classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia had completed growth, of whom seven had height standard deviation (SD) scores for chronological age less than zero, and one had extremely short stature (SD score -3.25). In 13 patients who were still growing, nine had height SD scores for chronological age of less than zero despite having mean (SD) advances in bone age over chronological age of 1.64 (1.68) years. Height SD scores for bone age were less than 0 in all 13 patients, indicating a loss of height despite advanced skeletal maturation. Doses of glucocorticoid that permit mild chronic or intermittent hyperandrogenaemia also seem to be associated with mild growth retardation. An adult height below average may be an inevitable consequence for many patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia receiving conventional glucocorticoid treatment.\r"

Despite the smaller size of preterm infants, mean values of bone mineral content in the mid-forearm were not significantly different between the two groups. In contrast, near 40 weeks' postconception the mean bone mineral content observed in 35 of the preterm infants was significantly smaller than that observed in eight of the full term infants. Our results suggest that there is a phase of rapid mineral accretion between 40 and 60 weeks' postconception. This 'catch up' in mineral accretion reduces the perinatal mineralisation deficit that might otherwise persist into childhood.\r"

  ".W": "Developmental progress, hearing, and dysmorphic features were monitored prospectively in eight babies with Norrie's disease (an X linked form of congenital blindness believed to be associated with mental retardation, regression, sensorineural deafness, and dysmorphic features) and in six congenitally blind peers during their preschool years. No evidence of sensorineural deafness or dysmorphology was found in the group with Norrie's disease. No significant difference in the rate of developmental progress occurred between the two groups. All 14 children showed continuing developmental progress and in 10 this was at a normal or superior rate. Two cases and two controls showed slowing in their rate of progress; in both groups a suboptimal developmental climate had prevailed and may have been contributory. The emphasis on serious and progressive associated disabilities in past reports has led to considerable distress for families of children with this disease. Our study suggests that these anxieties may often be illfounded. Parental depression constrains development, particularly when a baby is blind. More optimistic counselling with developmental guidance is recommended for children who are not overtly retarded in infancy until the long term developmental perspective of this disease is further clarified.\r"

Both cough and asthma were more common in boys and associated with a history of eczema, chest deformity, and skin reactivity to inhaled allergens, but these findings were more prevalent in asthma than cough. House dust mite sensitivity was found in 34 (57%) children with cough, 45 (75%) with asthma, and six (10%) controls. Tests of immunological function showed some high concentrations of IgM in groups with both cough and asthma, but high IgE concentrations, eosinophilia, and lymphocytosis were significant only in asthma. IgG1 and IgG2 concentrations were raised in some children with cough or asthma, but the only low subclass concentrations were of IgG3 observed in the group with cough. Children with simple cough represented a heterogeneous population but many showed evidence of atopy. Major defects of immunity were not observed.\r"

  ".W": "Altogether 38 postpubertal children with coeliac disease were rebiopsied. Mucosal abnormality in nine (24%) of them indicated poor adherence to the diet. Gluten challenge with a diet containing a normal amount of gluten was performed in those 29 patients with a normal mucosa. During challenge, rebiopsy was done when reticulin antibodies turned positive (mean 0.6 years, range 0.2-2.0) or at the end of the two year study. Histologically a clear relapse into coeliac disease was seen in all 23 patients who were positive for reticulin antibodies. At this time gliadin antibodies were positive in all but two. Sixteen (70%) of those who relapsed were completely asymptomatic. Three girls and one boy did not relapse within two years, indicating the possible recovery from coeliac disease to be 11%. All four had undergone gluten challenge earlier in childhood, after initial diagnosis and mucosal recovery, and this had resulted in mucosal relapse. To establish definite postpubertal recovery from coeliac disease in cases with normal mucosa at two years from challenge, further follow up studies of reticulin antibodies and later rebiopsy are needed. The reticulin antibody test seems to be suitable for prediction of mucosal relapse in coeliac disease.\r"

There were no operative deaths, no reoperations for bleeding, and 30 of 33 (91%) patients had a functioning splenic remnant documented by a postoperative radionuclide spleen scan. One patient developed neutropenia without evidence of viral infection that required temporary cessation of azathioprine and the patient with thalassemia major had only transient improvement in transfusion requirements. All other patients (94%) had control of the underlying condition for which the operation was performed. We conclude that subtotal splenectomy is a safe, effective therapy for a variety of nontraumatic conditions.\r"

Among a cohort of 4183 patients undergoing a primary surgical procedure in which secondary cholecystectomy might have been considered. 69 patients had a secondary cholecystectomy. The surgical wound infection rate was 8.7% in the secondary cholecystectomy group compared to 2.4% in the rest of the cohort (relative risk, 3.7, 95% C.I. 1.7, 8.1). Other postoperative complications occurred in 10.1% of those undergoing secondary cholecystectomy compared to 4.1% in those who did not (relative risk, 2.5, 95% C.I. 1.2, 5.1). The adjusted relative risk for wound infection was 3.3 (95% C.I. 1.4,8.0) and for other surgical complications was 1.7 (95% C.I. 0.8, 3.8). Postoperative length of hospital stay was longer for the secondary cholecystectomy group (mean, 13.8 days) than in the comparison group (mean 8.9 days, p = 0.001). These data suggest that patients undergoing a secondary cholecystectomy may have an increased risk of surgical wound infection and possibly other surgical complications.\r"

A retrospective study was conducted on 86 consecutive patients who had exploration for the calculous obstructions to identify the high-risk population to guide better management. Septicemic shock was present in 55 patients before surgery. All patients had ductal exploration under general anesthesia. Additional procedures included cholecystectomy (n = 55), cholecystostomy (n = 5), and transhepatic intubation (n = 2). Complications and deaths occurred in 43 (50%) and 17 (20%) patients, respectively. Multivariate analysis on the 25 clinical (n = 14) and biochemical (n = 11) parameters evaluated yield the following five predictive factors (relative risk): the presence of concomitant medical problems (4.5); pH less than 7.4 (3.5); total bilirubin more than 90 mumol/l (3.1); platelet less than 150 x 10(9)/l (2.9), and serum albumin less than 30 g/L (2.9). In the presence of three or more albumin less than 30 g/L (2.9). In the presence of three or more risk factors, postoperative morbidity and mortality rates were 91% and 55%, respectively, which were significantly higher than those with two or less risk factors (34% and 6%, respectively). As thrombocytopenia developed even with transient hypotension, timely ductal decompression would improve outcome of these patients after surgery. For the high-risk population, application of nonoperative biliary drainage might be considered.\r"

Eighty per cent of tumors were located in stomach or small intestine. Two thirds of the tumors were discovered in symptomatic patients before operation by a variety of diagnostic studies. A mitotic index (MI) was determined for each tumor, defined as the number of mitoses per 50 high-power microscopic fields. Only gastric and small intestine tumors had MIs more than 2. Tumors were treated by conservative excision in 67% and radical excision in 33%. At a median follow-up of 6 years there were no local recurrences. No patient with a tumor discovered incidentally has recurred. Three symptomatic patients have died of metastatic liver disease. Each patient with recurrence had a tumor with MI of 2 or more, which represents a recurrence rate of 16% in this group. We conclude that symptomatic gastric and small intestine tumors having two or more mitoses per 50 high-power fields carry a significant risk for recurrence, and that routine pathologic assessment of MI may identify a subset of patients who would potentially benefit from close follow-up and consideration for further therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The management of large carcinoid tumors of the anorectum is controversial. Most carcinoid tumors of the rectum and anus are early lesions, adequately treated by local excision. However, because of their relative rarity, the number of advanced cases seen at most institutions is small. Forty-three patients with anorectal carcinoid tumors were treated at our institution between 1960 and 1988 with complete follow-up. The median age of onset was 56 years. Eleven patients had no symptoms and the tumor was detected incidentally in eight additional patients with other diseases. Twenty tumors were larger than 2 cm in diameter and all patients had symptoms. Eight patients had another malignancy and three patients had ulcerative colitis. An association between ulcerative colitis and rectal carcinoid tumors is not widely appreciated. Eighteen tumors were treated by local excision, 16 by radical surgery, and nine underwent only biopsy. With complete resection of the primary lesion, local recurrence was never a problem. The median survival from diagnosis was 38 months in this series and 23 patients died of disease. After detection of metastases, the median survival time was 10 months. Tumors more advanced that T2 or larger than 2 cm in diameter were always fatal. All 13 patients with involved lymph nodes died of metastatic disease, with a median survival of 10 months, although one lived 9 years. Advanced rectal carcinoid tumors are aggressive malignancies. Adequate local excision controls regional disease but rectal carcinoid tumors are cured only when they are discovered before the T3 stage, measure less than 2 cm in diameter, and when lymph nodes are not involved. Consequently if a local excision permits complete resection, radical extirpative surgery will provide little benefit.\r"

Results of human studies are largely based on the in vitro responsiveness of peripheral blood leukocytes, while splenocytes are generally used in the animal studies. Because the response of lymphocytes from different lymphocyte compartments may vary, we compared the responses of murine peripheral blood, splenic, Peyer's patch, and mesenteric lymph node lymphocytes to a battery of mitogens after thermal injury. Burn-induced immunosuppression was maximal in the splenic lymphocyte compartment, where the responses to all three test mitogens were depressed throughout the 28-day postburn study period. Although the PHA-induced mitogen response of lymphocytes from the other three lymphoid compartments remained suppressed throughout the study period, the response to the mitogens Con-A and PWM generally returned to normal or supranormal levels by the seventh postburn day, Therefore it appears that the effect of a thermal injury on lymphocyte function varies according to the lymphocyte compartment examined and the mitogen tested. These results raise the question of whether animal studies using splenic lymphocytes can be correlated with human studies performed on circulating blood lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Sixty-six patients unable to complete a standard preoperative exercise test because of physical limitations were studied to determine the predictive value of individual clinical parameters, of clinical scoring systems based on multifactorial analysis, and of dipyridamole-thallium imaging before major general and vascular surgery. Study endpoints were limited to postoperative myocardial infarction or cardiac death before hospital discharge. There were nine postoperative cardiac events (seven deaths and two nonfatal infarctions). There was no statistical correlation between cardiac events and preoperative clinical descriptors, including individual clinical parameters, the Dripps-American Surgical Association score, the Goldman Cardiac Risk Index score, the Detsky Modified Cardiac Risk Index score, Eagle's clinical markers of low surgical risk, and the probability of postoperative events as determined by Cooperman's equation. There were no cardiac events in 30 patients with normal dipyridamole-thallium scans or in nine patients with fixed myocardial perfusion defects. Of 21 patients with reversible perfusion defects who underwent surgery, nine had a postoperative cardiac event (sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 43%). In the six other patients with reversible defects, preoperative angiography showed severe coronary disease or cardiomyopathy. Thus in patients unable to complete a standard exercise stress test, postoperative outcome cannot be predicted clinically before major general and vascular surgery, whereas dipyridamole-thallium imaging successfully identified all patients who sustained a postoperative cardiac event.\r"

Eleven patients who fit the entry criteria underwent abdominal exploration and attempted tumor resection for cure. A historical control group was used for comparison. Cure was defined as: (1) normal serum gastrin level, (2) no response to intravenous secretin, (3) no symptoms when antisecretory medications are stopped, and (4) no tumor recurrence on follow-up examination. Tumors found in both groups tended to be small (1.5 cm vs. 2.2 cm), multiple (71% vs. 40%), and in lymph nodes (70% vs. 70%). All tumors identified were located anatomically within the gastrinoma triangle. Tumors were found in 10 of 11 patients (91%) in the study group, and significantly more patients had their tumors excised for cure as compared to controls (82% vs. 27%, p less than 0.05). The current prospective cure rate for gastrinoma is higher than previously appreciated and tumors within lymph nodes do not preclude curative resection.\r"

  ".W": "The role of oxygen-free radicals for metabolic derangements in the ischemic and reperfused liver is controversial. The effect on hepatic protein synthesis of a 60-minute period of ischemia followed by two hours of reperfusion was studied in four groups of rats with different hepatic contents of the oxygen free radical scavenger glutathione (GSH): group 1, fed rats; group 2, fed rats treated with diethylmaleate (DEM) one hour before use (0.69 mL/kg, i.p.); group 3, 48-hour fasted rats; and group 4, 48-hour fasted rats treated with cobalt-chloride (45 mg/kg, s.c.) ten hours before use. Protein synthesis rates were determined by measuring incorporation of U-14C-leucine into protein in incubated liver slices. Treatment of fed rats with DEM and fasting for 48 hours significantly reduced liver GSH content. The effect of fasting on liver GSH was reversed by treatment with cobalt-chloride. The protein synthesis rate was reduced to approximately 30% of initial value at the end of the ischemic period and recovered to 70% to 100% of initial value after two hours of reperfusion with no differences between the experimental groups. Thus the effect of liver ischemia and reperfusion on protein synthesis was similar in groups of rats with different hepatic GSH contents at the onset of ischemia. The data suggest that oxygen free radicals do not play a major role for the impairment of protein synthesis in the ischemic and reperfused liver.\r"

I examined the vulnerability hypothesis in a sample of 157 children with cerebral palsy, myelodysplasia, or multiple handicaps and in 339 randomly selected controls. Data on psychopathology came from direct interviews with the children; data on the family environment came from mothers' reports. Physical disabilities were associated with significant increases in depressive symptoms and inattention. Family environment had a significant main effect on depressive symptoms; effect on disabled children was not significantly different from effect on controls. Family environment had no significant effects on symptoms of inattention in disabled children. The findings provided no support for the hypothesis that brain dysfunction renders children vulnerable to environmental stress.\r"

We previously found behavioral inhibition prevalent in the offspring of parents with panic disorder and agoraphobia. In this report, we examined the psychiatric correlates of behavioral inhibition by evaluating the sample of offspring of parents with panic disorder and agoraphobia, previously dichotomized as inhibited and not inhibited, and an existing epidemiologically derived sample of children, followed by Kagan and colleagues and originally identified at 21 months of age as inhibited or uninhibited. A third group of healthy children was added for comparison. Our findings indicate that inhibited children had increased risk for multiple anxiety, overanxious, and phobic disorders. It is suggested that behavioral inhibition may be associated with risk for anxiety disorders in children.\r"

Abnormalities in computed tomographic scans, electroencephalograms, positron emission tomographic scans, and evoked potentials have been described in this disorder, but are neither consistent nor pathognomonic of OCD. Neurological soft signs are nonlocalizing signs of deviant performance on a motor or sensory test where no other sign of a neurological lesion is present. We studied 41 medication-free patients with OCD who met DSM-III-R criteria, as well as 20 normal controls, matched for age, sex, and handedness, on 20 individual tasks that involved fine motor coordination, involuntary movements, and sensory and visuospatial function. There were significantly more signs of central nervous system dysfunction in the OCD group, as shown by abnormalities in fine motor coordination, involuntary and mirror movements, and visuospatial function. An excess of findings on the left side of the body and abnormalities of cube drawing may suggest right hemispheric dysfunction in a subgroup of patients with OCD. Soft signs correlated with a severity of obsessions. There was also a correlation between abnormalities in visual memory and recognition on neuropsychological testing and total soft signs. These findings provided additional evidence for a neurological deficit in some patients with OCD. However, further comparisons with other psychiatric populations are needed to determine whether these findings are unique to OCD or are a property of other psychiatric disorders as well.\r"

In this second series, control subjects were selected to be educationally equivalent to the schizophrenic patients, a modification in design that may partially account for the failure to replicate. By means of coronal images, ventricular volume was compared in patients and controls and found to differ to a highly significant degree, with the frontal horns being possibly slightly more enlarged than the rest of the ventricular system. A prominent sex effect was also observed, with most of the increased ventricular size occurring in the male patients. Within the male patients, the thalamus was also observed to be significantly smaller, a finding that could be consistent with periventricular injury. Patients with prominent negative symptoms had significantly larger ventricular size than did those with the mixed or positive subtypes. Because of its superior resolution, magnetic resonance imaging appears to offer a more sensitive index of ventricular enlargement than that provided by computed tomography.\r"

The magnitude of these lesions, expressed as lesion-brain ratios, correlated closely with the severity of dementia indicated by scores on the Blessed Dementia Scale and the Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination. Impairment in several domains of cognitive functioning tested by the Mini-Mental State Examination was also correlated with the relative quantity of periventricular lesions. Correlations were significant with systolic blood pressure, approached significance with age, and were not significant with duration of dementia or the magnitude of the lateral ventricles. These findings indicate the potential utility of structure-function correlations that are possible with magnetic resonance imaging in identifying mechanisms underlying dementia. They suggest that magnetic resonance imaging may be more useful than computed tomography in following the course of dementia.\r"

The depressed group had a marked reduction in global cortical blood flow. To examine topographic abnormalities, traditional multivariate analyses were applied, as well as a new scaled subprofile model developed to identify abnormal functional neural networks in clinical samples. Both approaches indicated that the depressed sample had an abnormality in topographic distribution of blood flow, in addition to the global deficit. The scaled subprofile model identified the topographic abnormality as being due to flow reduction in the depressed patients in selective frontal, central, superior temporal, and anterior parietal regions. This pattern may reflect dysfunction in the parallel distributed cortical network involving frontal and temporoparietal polymodal association areas. The extent of this topographic abnormality, as revealed by the scaled subprofile model, was associated with both patient age and severity of depressive symptoms.\r"

This soft-tissue tumor present on the right temple of a newborn boy consisted mainly of small round cells of the primitive neuroepithelial type, occasionally forming rosettes. The other components were focal glandular structures producing mucin, and aggregates of epithelioid cells bearing clear cytoplasm, both being distributed throughout the entire tumor. Additional glandular and clear cell components were strongly positive for various epithelial markers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen, epithelial membrane antigen, and cytokeratin. Epithelioid cells were also positive for neuron-specific enolase and S100 protein. Glial differentiation was evidenced in some of the epithelioid cells by localization of cytoplasmic glial fibrillary acidic protein. These findings suggest that this tumor derives from a remnant of a neural crest, and the possibility of a special type of peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor is considered.\r"

Reversibly aggregated platelets were estimated by subtracting the percentage of aggregated platelets in solution E from that in solution F. The average amount of platelets per aggregate was calculated by dividing the number of aggregated platelets in solution F by the number of aggregates per 1000 platelets counted. The reference ranges (means +/- SDs) established in 100 healthy persons were 5.8% +/- 2.4% (1% to 9%) for solution F, 3.9% +/- 1.8% (0% to 7%) for solution E, and 2.2 +/- 0.18 (2.0 to 2.5) for the average number of platelets per aggregate. Twenty hospitalized patients without heart disease had values similar to those of 100 normal subjects. In 50 patients with acute myocardial infarction, the percentage of aggregated platelets in solution F was 23.8% +/- 10.3%; in solution E, 4.0% +/- 3.0%; and the average number of platelets per aggregate, 2.9 +/- 0.7. The mean variance for five daily consecutive measurements was 0.52% for solution F, 0.63% for solution E, and 0.002 for the average number of platelets per aggregate. An even lesser mean variance was observed when the interobserver-vs-intraobserver and the intersmear-vs-intrasmear variations were tested. In patients with acute myocardial infarction, the interobserver-vs-intraobserver variance was 5.6% for solution F, 2.2% for solution E, and 0.005 for the average number of platelets per aggregate. The parameters studied were unaffected by different blood drawings, assay tubes, or venous stasis. In 80 patients with unstable angina, the studied parameters as well as the percentage of \"big\" platelets were measured on hospital days 1, 2, and 5. In 25 patients in whom acute myocardial infarction developed during hospitalization, the percentage of aggregated platelets was 28.1% +/- 8.3%. Most of them (71%) were reversibly aggregated and did not change during hospitalization. The average number of platelets per aggregate was 3.9 +/- 1.6, and the percentage of big platelets was 12.5% +/- 7.2%, both values not undergoing subsequent changes. In patients in whom acute myocardial infarction did not develop, the percentage of aggregated platelets decreased to 14.2% +/- 6.1% on day 5. Most aggregated platelets (58.8% to 90%) were irreversibly aggregated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The histologic changes related to the hemorrhages included smooth-muscle cell (SMC) proliferation with fibrosis, elastin fragmentation and collagen degeneration, and SMC vacuolar degeneration and coagulation necrosis. These lesions seemed to be prototypes for dissection, since they were associated with aortic and muscular artery dissections in three additional cases unrelated to pregnancy. In each case, dissections seemed to result from SMC activity that also involved the systemic vasculature, veins, and visceral smooth muscle in histologic patterns that could be explained as a product of SMC metabolism. We propose that the histologic changes associated with dissections are best explained as a product of the metabolism of SMCs that function as multifunctional mesenchyma in a manner controlled by variable penetrance of a gene that controls their metabolism.\r"

Because of partial volvulus formation, ileocecal resection was performed. Histopathologic examination of the resected specimen revealed signs of advanced brown bowel syndrome, with excessive deposits of ceroid-lipofuscin in, and a considerable loss of, smooth-muscle cells and myofibrils. The patient died after surgery, and at autopsy a systemic ceroid lipofuscinosis of smooth-muscle cells was detected. Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis was not observed. Serious and eventually fatal bowel dysfunction is rarely seen in brown bowel syndrome, but may occur in advanced stages. Since treatment with vitamin E appears to exert a favorable effect, early diagnosis of brown bowel syndrome seems to be very important.\r"

In addition, more general features of glandular tissue were seen. Features notable for their absence were mucin granules, microvilli containing filamentous cores, glycocalyx, and glycocalyceal bodies. The ultrastructural appearance was sufficiently distinctive to suggest that, in the proper clinical context, electron microscopy may serve to support a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the rete testis.\r"

Computed tomographic scans showed right-lobe or bilobar liver lacerations and/or subcapsular hematomas in all patients and associated hemoperitoneum in 8 patients. Exploration was required in 2 patients; both were found to have a hemoperitoneum and a nonbleeding liver laceration. There were no deaths. Patients with hemoperitoneum requiring transfusion had significantly greater injury severity scores and longer intensive care unit and hospital stays. The major advantage of a nonoperative approach is the opportunity to stabilize major extra-abdominal (particularly head) injuries as the first priority. Unstable hemodynamics, abdominal distension, and falling hematocrit are indications for prompt exploration. Nonoperative care of these injuries requires a strict treatment protocol.\r"

Fifteen minutes after injection, objective measurement of dye fluorescence was performed at multiple sites with a quantitative fluorometer, and a dye fluorescence index was derived. All limbs undergoing amputation were ischemic, manifested by rest pain, nonhealing ulcers, or gangrene. Five patients (8.7%) failed to heal at the below-knee level. The mean dye fluorescence index for the group that healed was 81 +/- 51 (range, 13 to 259) and for the group that failed to heal, 110 +/- 49 (range, 70 to 195).

The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the severity of these metabolic disturbances at the time of pack placement and the sequential improvement. It was found that most life-threatening disturbances that developed during the initial operative procedure could be corrected within 18 hours after pack placement and aggressive resuscitation. We concluded that the onset of nonmechanical bleeding and a coagulopathy marks a grave prognosis for the patient, and consideration should be given at this time for pack placement. Patients can then be aggressively resuscitated and returned to the operating room within 24 hours for pack removal if stability is achieved.\r"

Nonsurviving patients with infection had significantly higher sepsis scores than did survivors. Nonsurvivors with sepsis, on the other hand, did not differ from survivors with respect to any variable reflecting infection but did have higher mean sepsis scores. Maximum sepsis scores and sepsis scores on the day of death were similar in patients dying without infection and those dying with uncontrolled infection. The magnitude of the host septic response, independent of the presence, bacteriologic characteristics, or control of infection, is an important determinant of outcome in critical surgical illness.\r"

We sought to determine whether administration of: (1) murine monoclonal antibody directed against endotoxin, (2) steroids, or (3) antimicrobial agents would abrogate TNF production and whether the protective capacity would correlate with TNF levels in an experimental model of murine gram-negative bacterial sepsis. Mice were pretreated with anti-lipopolysaccharide monoclonal antibody, gentamicin sulfate, hydrocortisone, or saline and were then challenged with a lethal dose of intraperitoneal Salmonella minnesota. Murine serum TNF levels were measured by the L929 fibroblast cytotoxicity assay. Both gentamicin and anti-lipopolysaccharide monoclonal antibody significantly enhanced survival, and TNF activity at 1.5 and 3 hours was significantly suppressed in animals receiving these agents compared with animals that received either steroids or saline. We conclude that agents such as gentamicin, which inhibits bacterial replication, or monoclonal antibodies, which may neutralize lipopolysaccharide, indeed enhance survival, and survival was correlated with a significant reduction in circulating TNF during the early stages of infection.\r"

Thereafter, control mice and mice with KC blockade underwent either a sham operation or a cecal ligation and puncture. As indicators of systemic cell-mediated immunity, delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to soluble antigen and cellular alloantigen were measured 24 hours after the abdominal operations. The activation of KCs was assessed by their in vitro interleukin 1 production. Control septic mice were profoundly immunosuppressed and demonstrated marked KC activation. Septic mice with KC blockade, however, demonstrated less systemic immune hyporesponsiveness and significantly reduced KC activation, but died more rapidly. We concluded that despite apparent improvement in systemic immunity by KC blockade during intra-abdominal sepsis, the resulting impairment in functional phagocytic integrity predisposes to significantly higher mortality.\r"

Following infusions over 1 to 6 days, adrenal weight was increased with increasing dosage of TNF. Tumor necrosis factor at a dosage of 4 x 10(5) U/kg per 24 hours increased the plasma corticotropin level over the same period. In a further series of experiments the metabolic effects of TNF were compared with the effects of corticosterone, the predominant glucocorticoid in the rat. In comparison with controls, rats given corticosterone (75 mg subcutaneously) or TNF (2 x 10(5) U/kg per 24 hours) demonstrated decreased nitrogen balance and diminished carcass nitrogen content over a 6-day period. Tumor necrosis factor alone, however, induced a significant increase in liver nitrogen content and diminished jejunal mucosa DNA and protein levels in comparison with the control and corticosterone groups. Finally, adrenalectomized animals receiving basal corticosterone replacement were infused with TNF. Urinary nitrogen loss was significantly diminished in these animals compared with sham adrenalectomized controls, indicating that an intact adrenal stress response is necessary for the increased nitrogen loss following TNF infusion. Tumor necrosis factor may exert an important regulatory influence on the interorgan substrate flux that occurs during critical illness. The effects of TNF on skeletal muscle proteolysis can be simulated by adrenal glucocorticoid administration. The effects of this cytokine on visceral organs appear to be unique to TNF and cannot be reproduced by the administration of glucocorticoids alone.\r"

Lung flux of glutamine, glutamate, and alanine was determined in three groups of surgical patients with indwelling pulmonary artery catheters: (1) preoperative controls (n = 14), (2) postoperative elective general surgical patients (n = 10, and (3) hyperdynamic septic surgical patients (n = 17). In controls the lung was an organ of amino acid balance. These exchange rates did not change in general surgical patients. In the septic group, glutamine release by the lung increased markedly from a control value of 0.80 +/- 0.99 mumol/kg per minute to 6.80 +/- 1.32 mumol/kg per minute. This accelerated release rate was secondary to both an increase in total pulmonary blood flow and an increase in the pulmonary artery-systemic arterial concentration difference. The lung also became an organ of significant alanine release in septic patients. The lung plays an active metabolic role in the processing of amino acids and may be a key regulator in interorgan nitrogen flux after major injury and infection.\r"

In all experiments, the time- and dose-dependency of superoxide secretion were the same for blood and wound neutrophils. However, wound neutrophils produced significantly more superoxide. Furthermore, the cytochrome b component of the NADPH oxidase was found in greater quantities within wound neutrophils. We conclude that priming does little to alter the requirements for activating the NADPH oxidase but does significantly increase the velocity of superoxide generation. The data suggest that alterations in the assembly and function of the NADPH oxidase may contribute to enhanced superoxide secretion by wound neutrophils.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether phagocytosis mediated by Fc receptors and/or receptors for the third component of complement (C3b) are altered after hemorrhage, C3H/HeN mice were subjected to nonlethal hemorrhage and then adequately resuscitated. Twelve hours after the hemorrhagic episode, a significant decrease in both Fc (-55.2%) and C3b (-46.6%) receptor-positive peritoneal macrophages was observed compared with controls. At 24 hours the extent of the depression, while still marked, was only -22.5% and -17.4% for Fc and C3b receptors, respectively. By day 3 after hemorrhage, no differences could be observed for either of these receptors. The capacity of macrophages from mice after hemorrhage to elaborate interleukin 1 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha showed no increase over that of the sham controls, and serum levels of endotoxin were not elevated 2 or 24 hours after hemorrhage. Moreover, endotoxin-tolerant C3H/HeJ mice also exhibited depression of both receptors after hemorrhage. Thus, the inability of the host macrophages to clear opsonized infectious agents after hemorrhage may be due in part to the loss of Fc and C3b receptors on macrophages.\r"

  ".W": "The requirement of dietary nucleotide sources for maximal helper T-cell function has been demonstrated. The effect of dietary nucleotide restriction was tested during two forms of nutritional stress: starvation and protein malnutrition. In the starvation model, mice were fed chow diet, nucleotide free or nucleotide free supplemented with 0.25% yeast RNA, for at least 4 weeks. The animals were then starved for 5 days, at which time they were killed and mitogen assays were performed using spleen cells. Animals previously maintained on the nucleotide-free diet supplemented with RNA showed a significant increase in spontaneous concanavalin A and phytohemagglutinin-stimulated blastogenesis. Protein malnutrition was induced by feeding Balb/c mice a protein-free diet for 7 to 10 days. These mice then received either the protein-free diet, the nucleotide-free diet, or the nucleotide-free diet supplemented with 0.25% yeast RNA. Popliteal lymph node assays were then performed. The chow diet, nucleotide-free diet, and nucleotide-free diet supplemented with 0.25% yeast RNA led to a restoration of body weight, but only the chow and supplemented diets restored significant popliteal lymph node immune reactivity. These studies using starvation and protein-malnutrition models clearly indicate the nutritional role of nucleotides in the maintenance and restoration of the immune response.\r"

  ".W": "This study investigates mechanisms of impaired humoral immune response in a well-defined population of blunt trauma patients (n = 18, Injury Severity Score greater than or equal to 20). Spontaneous and pokeweed mitogen-induced polyclonal immunoglobulin production were assessed in cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The proliferative response to alloantigen and mitogen was assessed in parallel by the mixed lymphocyte reaction and pokeweed mitogen-induced blastogenesis, respectively. Pokeweed mitogen-induced IgG and IgM production was significantly reduced in trauma patients compared with controls. This effect was not reversed by depletion of adherent cells or by the addition of indomethacin. Exogenous interleukin 2 was also ineffective. However, the addition of normal T cells or supernatants from isoantigen-stimulated cultures of these cells to patient B cell-enriched cultures significantly enhanced (by 1.4- to 5.1-fold) the antibody response to pokeweed mitogen. Thus, suppression of humoral antibody response in blunt trauma patients may be due to failure of T-cell mediated help, resulting in insufficient secretion or activity of cytokines required for adequate B cell activation, proliferation, or differentiation into immunoglobulin-secreting cells.\r"

The total area of MRI-demonstrated lesions was measured from film enlargements for each region using an interactive image analysis system. While the MRI was abnormal in 60 (97%) of 62 patients, the visual-evoked potentials in 51 (85%) of 60 patients, the brain stem auditory-evoked potentials (BAEPs) in 24 (46%) of 52 patients, and the somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEPs) in 45 (89%) of 54 patients, an abnormal intra-blood-brain barrier (BBB) IgG synthesis rate, IgG oligoclonal bands, or both were found in all 62 patients. The total area of MRI abnormality in the cerebrum was significantly correlated only with the intra-BBB IgG synthesis rate, abnormal visual-evoked potentials, impaired performance on the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), and one test of standing duration in the quantitative examination of neurologic function (QENF). The brain stem lesion area correlated with the Kurtzke expanded disability status scale and brain stem functional systems score, the ambulation index, abnormal BAEPs, and impaired performance on the SDMT as well as multiple tests of upper and lower extremity function in the QENF. The cerebellar lesion area correlated with impaired performance on the SDMT and primarily upper extremity testing in the QENF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Linear increases are observed in measures of ventricular and sulcal fluid. A curvilinear decrease in cortical volume is found and is demonstrable even in young adults. Highly nonlinear increases in the volume of signal hyperintensities are observed in cortical and subcortical regions. The methods described may be used to provide an age-adjusted index of morphologic abnormality for each subject on any of the measures. They are currently in use in ongoing neurobehavioral studies of patients with nonfocal brain abnormalities and primary disorders of affect and cognition.\r"

Magnetic evoked fields to both stimulation conditions were measured in eight consecutive normal subjects, and the cortical sources of these fields were estimated on the basis of these measurements. Subsequent projection of the source location coordinates onto magnetic resonance images showed that in all subjects the sources were accurately estimated to fall in the vicinity of the auditory cortex and that two separate sources may account for the response to ipsilateral and contralateral stimulation.\r"

To investigate potential risk factors for ALS, we conducted a case-control study using two control subjects matched to each case patient for age, gender, and duration of residence in Two Rivers. Physical trauma, the frequent consumption of freshly caught Lake Michigan fish, and a family history of cancer were reported more often by case patients than control subjects. These findings support previous studies proposing a role for trauma in ALS pathogenesis and suggest that the causative role of diet should be further explored. Continued surveillance for and epidemiologic investigation of ALS clusters with subsequent retrospective analysis may provide clues concerning the cause of ALS.\r"

Twenty-four patients with AD performed in the nondemented range by scoring above the recommended cutoff point of 23 of a possible 30 on the MMSE. We compared the scores for items of the MMSE in controls and subjects with AD and used logistic regression to model a shorter MMSE that retained the accuracy of the complete test. A score summing tests of recall and orientation for place had similar sensitivity to the full MMSE.

Four of the older patients with DS had a history of mental deterioration, disorientation, and memory loss and were demented. Patients and control subjects had EEGs, psychometric testing, quantitative computed tomography, and positron emission tomography with fludeoxyglucose F 18. A \"blinded\" reader classified the EEGs into two groups--those with normal alpha background or those with abnormal background. All the control subjects, the 13 young adult patients with DS, and the 5 older patients with DS had normal EEG backgrounds. In comparison with the age-matched patients with DS with normal alpha background, older patients with DS with decreased alpha background had dementia, fewer visuospatial skills, decreased attention span, larger third ventricles, and a global decrease in cerebral glucose utilization with parietal hypometabolism. In the young patients with DS, the EEG background did not correlate with psychometric or positron emission tomographic findings, but the third ventricles were significantly larger in those with abnormal EEG background. The young patients with DS, with or without normal EEG background, had positron emission tomographic findings similar to those of the control subjects. The mechanism underlying the abnormal EEG background may be the neuropathologic changes of Alzheimer's disease in older patients with DS and may be cerebral immaturity in younger patients with DS.\r"

Patients with greater weakness in plantar flexors than in dorsiflexors should be suspected of having intraspinal disease rather than peripheral neuropathy.

In 3 patients, EEG findings were normal 1-2 months after onset, while F-VEP findings were normal at 9-10 months. Brainstem auditory evoked potential findings were normal, except for 1 with otitis media. Evoked potentials suggested that subclinical brain damage, especially due to cortical lesions, persisted during the first year of life in these patients clinically diagnosed with \"meningitis.\"\r"
