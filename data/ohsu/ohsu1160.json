  ".W": "ATP is copackaged and coreleased with adrenergic, serotonergic, and cholinergic neurotransmitters, suggesting a possible interaction between the signaling pathways for ATP and these coreleased neurotransmitters. Muscarinic m2 and m4, alpha 2-adrenergic, and D2-dopaminergic neurotransmitter receptors, which have in common their ability to inhibit adenylate cyclase through the inhibitory guanine nucleotide binding protein Gi, were transfected and expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that contain endogenous ATP receptors coupled to the release of arachidonic acid. Normal functional coupling of m2, m4, alpha 2, and D2 receptors was demonstrated by their ability to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation with dose-response activities consistent with previous reports for these Gi-coupled receptors. Stimulation of m2, m4, alpha 2, and D2 receptors resulted in an augmentation of ATP-stimulated arachidonic acid release. With the exception of the m4 receptor, none of the receptors tested was able to stimulate arachidonic acid release in the absence of ATP. Potentiation of ATP-stimulated arachidonic acid release was independent of changes in cAMP. The augmentation of ATP-stimulated arachidonic acid release and the inhibition of cAMP accumulation were both blocked by pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of Gi, but with different dose-response characteristics. Inhibition of protein kinase C with staurosporine or long-term pretreatment of the cells with the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate blocked the augmentation response. This demonstrates that Gi-coupled inhibitory receptors can amplify ATP-receptor-stimulated arachidonic acid release through a pertussis-toxin-sensitive G protein, independent of their ability to inhibit adenylate cyclase activity.\r"

High- and low-affinity binding sites for ANP were found on PTr cells; BNP appeared to bind to the same receptors with similar affinities. Either ANP or BNP stimulated production of cGMP and caused a 30% decrease in Na(+)-K(+)-Cl- cotransport. Each peptide increased synthesis and secretion of endothelin 1 by PTr cells in a dose-dependent fashion, but cell growth was not affected. Human parathyroid cells (normal and pathological) also responded to ANP or BNP with an increase in cGMP production. The finding of receptors for natriuretic hormones on parathyroid cells with consequent effects on release of endothelin 1 might be of relevance in understanding the clinical association between hyperparathyroidism and hypertension.\r"

Analysis of stop codon suppression by the various mutants showed an exclusive response to UGA stop signals, which was correlated directly with the continuity of one or the other of two tandem complementary UCA sequences (bases 1199-1204). Since no other structural features of the mutated ribosomes were hampered and the translation initiation and elongation events functioned properly, we propose that a direct interaction occurs between the UGA stop codon on the mRNA and the 16S rRNA UCA motif as one of the initial events of UGA-dependent peptide chain termination. These results provide evidence that base pairing between rRNA and mRNA plays a direct role in termination, as it has already been shown to do for initiation and elongation.\r"

  ".W": "Although in vivo effects of 17 beta-estradiol (estrogen) on bone turnover have been shown to occur mainly through influences on osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, the mechanism by which estrogen reduces bone resorption is unclear. To approach this question, we have examined authentic osteoclasts for evidence of a direct osteoclast response to estrogen in vitro. Highly purified (greater than (90%) viable avian osteoclasts from birds maintained on a low calcium diet were obtained using an osteoclast-specific monoclonal antibody coupled to magnetic beads. Isolated cells were either analyzed directly for estrogen receptor (ER) levels or cultured to assess the biological effects of estrogen. Northern blot analysis revealed a 5.2-kilobase mRNA that hybridized with a cDNA to human ER mRNA in the osteoclasts. An anti-human ER antibody recognized proteins of 66 kDa and 140 kDa in osteoclast extracts by Western blot analysis. The 66-kDa size is in close agreement with the reported size of the human ER. Nuclear binding of estrogen to intact viable osteoclasts was steroid-specific and saturable, with 5662 +/- 1420 molecules bound per nucleus (mean +/- SEM). In vitro estrogen responses in osteoclasts included a dose-dependent decrease in resorption as well as an increase in nuclear protooncogene mRNA levels. These observations indicate that osteoclasts are capable of directly responding to estrogen in vivo.\r"

We demonstrate that 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [1,25-(OH)2D3] enhances the replication of monocyte- and lymphocyte-tropic strains of HIV-1 up to 10,000-fold in monocyte cell lines, peripheral blood monocytes, and unfractionated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. 1,25(OH)2D3 is therefore one of the most potent regulators of HIV-1 replication described to date. Precursors of 1,25(OH)2D3 enhance HIV-1 replication in proportion to their affinity for the 1,25(OH)2D3 intracellular receptor, suggesting that 1,25(OH)2D3 influences HIV-1 replication by mechanisms involving this receptor. These studies may have important implications for the design of effective therapy of HIV-1 infection.\r"

Here we report the molecular cloning and subcellular localization of a 13-kDa FKBP (FKBP-13), which has a 21-amino acid signal peptide and appears to be membrane-associated. Although no internal hydrophobic region, and thus no transmembrane domain, is apparent within the 120 amino acids of mature FKBP-13, a potential endoplasmic reticulum retention sequence (Arg-Thr-Glu-Leu) is found at its C terminus. FKBP-13 has 51% nucleotide sequence identity and 43% amino acid sequence identity to FKBP-12; the N-terminal sequences are divergent, but the 92-amino acid C-terminal sequence of FKBP-13 has 46 identical and 20 related residues when compared with FKBP-12. The conserved residues that comprise the drug binding site and rotamase active site of FKBP-12 are completely conserved in FKBP-13. Therefore, the three-dimensional structures of FKBP-12 and the FKBP-12/FK506 complex are likely to be excellent models of the corresponding FKBP-13 structure.\r"

We have examined key events in T-cell signaling in peripheral T cells isolated from these mice. In this report, we show that the anergic CD4+ T cells did not mobilize calcium or express receptors for interleukin 2 (IL-2) following TcR ligation. However, the cells retained viability and functional potential because stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin bypassed the block in receptor-mediated signaling and induced IL-2 receptor expression and proliferation of the anergic cells.\r"

  ".U": "91319751\r", 
  ".W": "Essential to signal transduction are mechanisms of \"cross-talk\" to coordinate different pathways. This study shows that stimulation of serine/threonine protein kinases activates protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase; protein-tyrosine-phosphate phosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.3.48). More than 95% of intracellular PTPase was in the particulate fraction of various cell lines and was extracted with detergent as a 150-kDa complex that contained a 55-kDa catalytic subunit. The complex was activated by protease digestion, which changed its substrate specificity coincident with reduction in size. The complex was dissociated by treatment of the membrane fraction with 3 M LiBr. Treatment of intact cells with isoproterenol, forskolin, or cAMP analogues to stimulate cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) or with phorbol ester or dioctanoylglycerol to stimulate Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (PKC) produced activation of membrane PTPase complex without a change in its size. Inhibition of protein-serine/threonine phosphatases with okadaic acid or fluoride also resulted in activation of the membrane PTPase. These results support a model for regulation of PTPase by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of serine/threonine residues in a regulatory component complexed with the 55-kDa PTPase catalytic subunit. This mechanism may be important in regulating sensitivity to extracellular signals transduced via tyrosine phosphorylation and in the synchronization of events during the cell cycle.\r"

We found that kinesin and ATP are all that is required to support efficient (33% vesicle motility) and rapid (0.4-0.6 micron/s) translocation of secretory granule membranes on microtubules in the presence of a low-salt motility buffer. Kinesin also induced the formation of microtubule asters in this buffer, with the plus ends of microtubules located at the center of each aster. This observation indicates that kinesin is capable of promoting active sliding between microtubules toward their respective plus ends, a movement analogous to that of anaphase b in the mitotic spindle. The fact that vesicle translocation, microtubule sliding, and microtubule-dependent kinesin ATPase activities are all enhanced in low-salt buffer establishes a functional parallel between this translocator and other motility ATPases, myosin, and dynein.\r"

  ".W": "Transgenic mice carrying the human apolipoprotein (apo) A-I gene (HuAITg mice) were used to examine the effects of overexpression of the human gene on high density lipoprotein (HDL) particle size distribution and metabolism. On a chow diet, control mice had HDL cholesterol and apo A-I levels of 49 +/- 2 and 137 +/- 12 mg/dl of plasma, respectively. HuAITg mice had HDL cholesterol, human apo A-I, and mouse apo A-I levels of 88 +/- 2, 255 +/- 19, and 16 +/- 2 mg/dl, respectively. Nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis revealed control mouse plasma HDL to be primarily monodisperse with a particle diameter of 10.2 nm, whereas HuAITg mouse plasma HDL was polydisperse with particles of diameter 11.4, 10.2, and 8.7 nm, which correspond in size to human HDL1, HDL2, and HDL3, respectively. In vivo turnover studies of HDL labeled with [3H]cholesteryl linoleyl ether (representing the cholesteryl ester pool) and 125I-apo A-I were performed. In control animals, the fractional catabolic rate (FCR) for HDL cholesteryl ester (0.197 +/- 0.010 pool/hr) was significantly (P less than 0.0005) more than the apo A-I FCR (0.118 +/- 0.006 pool/hr). In the HuAITg mice, the HDL cholesteryl ester FCR (0.124 +/- 0.008 pool/hr) was the same as the apo A-I FCR (0.126 +/- 0.010 pool/hr). There were no significant differences between control and HuAITg animals in the sites of tissue removal of HDL cholesteryl ester, with the liver extracting most of the injected radioactivity. Control and HuAITg animals had comparable liver and intestinal cholesterol synthesis and LDL FCR. In conclusion, HuAITg mice have principally human and not mouse apo A-I in their plasma. This apparently causes a change in HDL particle size distribution in the transgenic mice to one resembling the human pattern. The replacement of mouse by human apo A-I also apparently causes the loss of the selective uptake pathway of HDL cholesteryl esters present in control mice. These data imply that apo A-I primary structure has a profound influence on HDL particle size distribution and metabolism.\r"

Here we extend our analysis of the sevenless enhancer, defining a 475-base-pair fragment that contains elements necessary for the correct qualitative and quantitative expression of the sevenless gene. Within this fragment are sequence elements conserved in the sevenless gene of a distantly related Drosophila species and protected from DNase I digestion by nuclear extracts isolated from adult heads and imaginal discs. Partial deletions of the 475-base-pair fragment result in preferential loss of expression in different subsets of cells. These results suggest that the normal pattern of expression is generated by the combined action of separate cell-specific regulatory elements.\r"

Time-resolved visible absorption spectroscopy and resonance Raman experiments, respectively, show the presence of long-lived O-like and N-like intermediates in the photocycles of the above mutants. We infer the existence of an equilibrium between the N and O intermediates in the photocycles of these mutants. The L93A and L93T mutants exhibit normal proton pumping under continuous illumination, suggesting that the decay of the N and/or O intermediate, and consequently, proton translocation, can be accelerated by the absorption of a second photon. Since the 13-cis----all-trans reisomerization of retinal is completed during the decay of the N and O intermediates, we conclude that the interaction of Leu-93 with retinal is important in this phase of the photocycle. This conclusion is supported by a recent structural model of bacteriorhodopsin that suggests that Leu-93 is near the C-13 methyl group of retinal.\r"

  ".W": "Malnutrition and respiratory disease commonly occur together, and the immunologic defects caused by malnutrition may affect clinical responses and the impact of vaccines. These defects include impaired maturation and function of T lymphocytes, diminished secretory immune responses, poor humoral antibody responses to polysaccharide antigens, deficient complement activity (especially the alternative pathway), and impaired antimicrobial mechanisms by phagocytic cells. In addition, protein-energy malnutrition often leads to very high serum levels of IgE as a result of altered T cell regulation of IgE production and may contribute to IgE-mediated pathologic responses to respiratory syncytial virus or parainfluenza virus infection. Correction of these deficits may improve host response to infection and enhance vaccine-related protection. Both vitamin A and iron deficiency states have been epidemiologically associated with increased morbidity due to respiratory infection. The impact of preventive therapy with either vitamin A or iron is still uncertain, but such therapy has the potential for diminishing the incidence of respiratory infections and their consequences.\r"

  ".W": "Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) represent a diverse family of enzymes that exist as integral membrane and nonreceptor forms. The PTPs, with specific activities in vitro 10 to 1000 times greater than those of the protein tyrosine kinases would be expected to effectively control the amount of phosphotyrosine in the cell. They dephosphorylate tyrosyl residues in vivo and take part in signal transduction and cell cycle regulation. Most of the transmembrane forms, such as the leukocyte common antigen (CD45), contain two conserved intracellular catalytic domains; but their external segments are highly variable. The structural features of the transmembrane forms suggest that these receptor-linked PTPs are capable of transducing external signals; however, the ligands remain unidentified. A hypothesis is proposed explaining how phosphatases might act synergistically with the kinases to elicit a full physiological response, without regard to the state of phosphorylation of the target proteins.\r"

These predictions were tested by taking samples from six populations of Drosophila melanogaster kept at low population densities (r-populations) for nearly 200 generations and placing them in crowded cultures (K-populations). After 25 generations in the crowded cultures, the derived K-populations showed growth rate and productivity that at high densities were elevated relative to the controls, but at low density were depressed.\r"

  ".U": "91320304\r", 
  ".W": "The early history of QA is one of stunning achievements. Men and women led by a vision of what hospital health care should be brought about fundamental changes in the structure of hospitals and medical schools. These successes required lifetimes of work and enormous capital (Flexner's war chest would have amounted to billions of 1990 dollars). A second wave of reform included the creation of credentialing committees, tissue committees, and infection control efforts. Although less dramatic in their impact, these efforts have had measurable influence on the outcome of health care and, under the joint administration of local hospitals and the JCAHO, continue to guarantee excellence in health care. The most recent attempts at quality assurance, driven at least in part by a federal mandate to control costs, have been much more modest in their success. Committed groups working within a sound theoretical framework have had great difficulty monitoring and evaluating centrally a process as decentralized as health care. The regularity with which new fashions in QA have appeared underscores the frustration felt with this approach. If the quality of health care is to be monitored centrally, reliable measures of quality will be required. No one knows if such measures actually exist. The absence of objective evidence that quality has been improved by these efforts suggests that little has been accomplished, perhaps because all easily attainable improvements had already been implemented. The basic concept of a centrally monitored hospital structure within which provision is made for ongoing observation and innovation by those actually involved in the care of patients retains the advantages of central monitoring and local invention. It is a model that will be hard to improve on. We should persist in our efforts, but fundamental advances are unlikely. In the end, quality is only doing everything the best it can be done. The best quality assurance requires an excellent hospital in which a well-trained and committed staff has a central mandate and local purview to do the best possible job. Two thousand years after Hammurabi's minions busied themselves determining the appropriate punishment for various medical misadventures, the Greek Hippocrates advocated a less complex approach to the same problem. He suggested that the quality of health care could be best guaranteed by administering an oath to physicians, exhorting them simply to do what was best for their fellow men. This approach has seen us through two millennia and, however variable its results, may not be easily improved on.\r"

These antibodies are potentially hemolytic. This case underscores the importance of considering risks of plasma infusion. Plasma should not be used casually, especially for indications for which alternate therapies, such as crystalloid and colloid solutions, are available.\r"

  ".W": "In a clinically applicable cat stroke model, 16 purpose-bred adult animals were used to evaluate the beneficial effects of two treatment regimens: isovolemic hemodilution with either a perfluorocarbon emulsion or dextran 40 (a glucose polymer). Animals that received these treatment regimens were then compared with a control group of untreated animals. Focal cerebral infarctions were produced by transorbital ligation of the left middle cerebral artery. The randomly allocated treatment arms of the study were instituted 3 hours after ligation of the middle cerebral artery, thereby simulating a human clinical situation. In vivo mitochondrial metabolic activity of the peri-infarct cerebral tissue was continually assessed by means of a multiwavelength near-infrared spectrophotometer. This allowed measurement of cellular oxygenation at the cytochrome aa3 level, the terminal member of the cytochrome chain. Sequential proton-based magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure intracerebral water in vivo. Cardiac output, oxygen consumption/delivery, chemical, histologic, and rheologic parameters were also assessed. The data collected were analyzed by group means and standard statistical analyses, which revealed that the group treated with the perfluorocarbon emulsion had both less brain edema in the early post-infarct period (p less than 0.05), as well as a higher level of oxidation of cytochrome aa3 (p less than or equal to 0.025). This evidence supports the premise that isovolemic hemodilution with an oxygen-carrying hemodiluent may be beneficial in the treatment of ischemic strokes.\r"

Fibrinolysis variables were similar (with greater than 95% confidence) in the patients with thrombus-associated coronary syndromes as compared with those with chest pain syndromes not due to coronary thrombosis. These fibrinolytic variables were also similar to those in patients without coronary artery disease and in healthy controls. Their data suggest that defective fibrinolysis is not involved, at least systemically, in the pathogenesis of thrombus-associated coronary artery syndromes.\r"

Their mean postnatal age was 19 (10) hours at the onset of pH recording, which was performed with the babies supine. The mean hourly values for the total number of episodes of gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) was 2.3 (2.7), for acid GOR 1.2 (1.4), and for acid GOR longer than 5 minutes 0.08 (0.09). The time the pH was greater than 4 (the reflux index) was 3.5 (3.3)% and the mean airway pressure was 6.6 (5.1) cm H2O. Fifteen infants had a reflux index above 5%. GOR patterns were not significantly correlated to birth weight, gestational age, postconceptional age, ventilatory patterns, and duration of mechanical ventilation. We concluded that the reproducibility of the reflux index was low because the median of the absolute differences was 1% when two consecutive 12 hour periods were compared and reached 2.5% when the two periods were separated by 96 hours. A second 24 hour pH recording was performed in 30 of the 42 patients after weaning from the ventilator and at a time when patients were asymptomatic and enterally fed. Compared with the late postprandial period of the second pH recording, the first recording showed an increase in the number of episodes of GOR and a decrease in reflux index, without any difference in the number of episodes of acid GOR.\r"

With extended periods of insufflation, patient arterial carbon dioxide levels may be adversely altered. Patients were selected for laparoscopic cholecystectomy using the same criteria as for open cholecystectomy. Twenty patients (group 1) had normal preoperative cardiopulmonary status (American Society of Anesthesiologists class I), while 10 patients (group 2) had previously diagnosed cardiac or pulmonary disease (class II or III). Demographic, hemodynamic, arterial blood gas, and ventilatory data were collected before peritoneal insufflation and at intervals during surgery. Patients with preoperative cardiopulmonary disease demonstrated significant increases in arterial carbon dioxide levels and decreases in pH during carbon dioxide insufflation compared with patients without underlying disease. Results of concurrent noninvasive methods of assessing changes in partial arterial pressures of carbon dioxide (end-tidal carbon dioxide measured with mass spectrographic techniques) may be misleading and misinterpreted because changes in partial arterial pressures of carbon dioxide are typically much smaller than changes in arterial blood levels and, unlike arterial gas measurements, do not indicate the true level of arterial hypercarbia. During laparoscopic cholecystectomy, patients with chronic cardiopulmonary disease may require careful intraoperative arterial blood gas monitoring of absorbed carbon dioxide.\r"

Primary HIV-1 infection was confirmed in each subject by seroconversion and virus isolation. The acute phase of the illness resolved a median of 4 days (range, 3-14 days) from commencement of zidovudine. Six subjects reported symptoms that may have been side-effects of zidovudine, the most common being nausea in four subjects and headache in two. Treatment was discontinued in one subject who had persistent headache and nausea. Haemoglobin, haematocrit and erythrocyte counts decreased and mean corpuscular volume increased significantly during the treatment. None of the subjects developed anaemia and none required dose modification or blood transfusion as a result of haematological side-effects. There were no significant differences in the granulocyte count or the lymphocyte count during any week of treatment when compared with baseline levels. There were no significant differences in T-cell subset numbers of the subjects during treatment compared with a group of historical controls. HIV-1 was isolated from several subjects during and after termination of zidovudine treatment. The results of this investigation indicate that zidovudine is a safe drug to administer to people with primary HIV-1 infection. There was no clear evidence, however, of any clinical benefit in terms of resolution of the acute illness and no indication that the treatment would prevent development of persistent infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "HIV-1 proviral DNA contains two binding sites for the transcription factor NF-kappa B. HIV-1-infected individuals have, on average, abnormally high levels of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and abnormally low plasma cysteine levels. We therefore investigated the effects of cysteine and related thiols on HIV-1 replication and NF-kappa B expression. The experiments in this report show that cysteine or N-acetylcysteine (NAC) raise the intracellular glutathione (GSH) level and inhibit HIV-1 replication in persistently infected Molt-4 and U937 cells. However, inhibition of HIV-1 replication appears not to be directly correlated with GSH levels. Cysteine and NAC also inhibit NF-kappa B activity as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase (CAT) gene expression under control of NF-kappa B binding sites in uninfected cells. This suggests that the cysteine deficiency in HIV-1-infected individuals may cause an over-expression of NF-kappa B-dependent genes and enhance HIV-1 replication. NAC may be considered for the treatment of HIV-1-infected individuals.\r"

Baseline serum values of beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2M), neopterin, soluble CD8 (sCD8), and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) for 185 men were examined univariately and multivariately as predictors of AIDS during 36 months of follow-up. Thirty-three cases of AIDS (18%) were diagnosed during the follow-up period. All four assays correlated highly with each other (r = 0.48-0.63), and all four were good univariate predictors of AIDS and comparable to CD4 lymphocyte count. beta 2M, neopterin, and sCD8 predicted AIDS independently of both CD4 count and HIV p24 antigen or p24 antibody in multivariate analysis. Within the range of CD4 count 200-499 x 10(6) cells/l, an immune activation marker used in combination with an assay for p24 antigen identifies those at 3-6% risk of AIDS over 36 months (low risk on both assays) and those at 63-86% risk (high risk on both assays). These results can be used to guide physicians and patients making decisions about treating asymptomatic HIV infection with zidovudine in individuals with CD4 lymphocyte count of 200-499 x 10(6) cells/l.\r"

HIV-1 seroprevalence was 31% for the entire population and 43% for the 247 adults. Forty-two (38%) of the 110 HIV-1-seropositive adult deaths occurred in those between the ages of 25 and 34 years. The mean age of death for seropositives was 36 years, 7.5 years less than seronegative deaths. AIDS and AIDS-associated diagnoses such as cryptococcal meningitis, chronic diarrhea and pneumonia accounted for 42% of all adult deaths and 74% of all HIV-1-seropositive adult deaths. Seventeen per cent of 50 sera initially negative by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were ultimately found to be HIV-1-seropositive by Western blot or p24 antigen testing. The data indicate that HIV-1 infection and AIDS contribute significantly to adult mortality in Kinshasa population and that sensitivity of ELISA tests decreases in terminal HIV-1 infection.\r"

The resultant intracellular accumulation of GAG leads to disruption of the intracellular and extracellular environment and dysfunction of multiple organ systems. Among the most noted manifestations of this disease is disproportionate short trunk dwarfism, which develops during the first years of life. Histochemical and electron-microscopic observations on a 30-month-old child with Hurler syndrome showed marked irregularities in chondrocyte orientation within the growth plate, along with disruption of the normal columnar architecture. Vacuolization with enlargement of the cellular border was the characteristic ultrastructural finding. An heritable abnormality in the enzymatic degradation of structural glycosaminoglycans leads to profound disruption of the normal mechanisms of growth and development.\r"

We examined multiple physiologic and psychosocial variables in an attempt to predict exercise performance in a group of patients with COPD enrolled in a clinical trial of pulmonary rehabilitation. A total of 119 patients (FEV1 = 1.41 +/- 0.64 L) were divided randomly into either a study group (group A, n = 58) or validation group (group B, n = 61). Stepwise multiple regression in group A revealed that peak oxygen uptake (peak VO2) was predicted best by the following equation: Peak VO2 (L/min) = (0.0327 x DCO) + (0.0040 x MVV)-(0.0156 x peak-exercise VD/VT) + (0.0259 x resting VE) + 0.848; r = 0.90; SE = 0.233 L/min. This equation was then cross-validated in group B. It demonstrated excellent validity: measured peak VO2 (L/min) = (1.13 x predicted peak VO2)-0.0891; r = 0.90; SE = 0.239 L/min. We conclude that exercise tolerance was predicted reasonably well from measurements of lung function and gas exchange in this group of patients with COPD. However, the variability of the prediction would limit its usefulness in individual patients.\r"

During 6 h and on one day only, all patients were given intermittent negative pressure ventilation (INPV) together with oxygenation starting at a concentration of 24 percent and increasing to 30 percent. Using this procedure, it was possible to raise arterial PaO2 to safe levels (from 47.2 +/- 3 mm Hg to 61.5 +/- 6 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) without increasing hypercapnia, and a significant drop in PaCO2 levels (from 74.4 +/- 9 mm Hg to 65.6 +/- 12 mm Hg, p less than 0.005) was even observed. One hour after INPV ended, the mean values of PaO2, PaCO2, oxygen saturation, and pH were also significantly better than prestudy values. We conclude that INPV and oxygen therapy with increasing oxygen flow could constitute an alternative option to intubation and mechanical ventilation in cases of severe hypercapnic respiratory failure due to advanced COPD.\r"

The stability of the 99mTc-labelled antacids was satisfactory and there was no difference in antacid capacity between the labelled and unlabelled antacids. The studies were carried out on 15 healthy male volunteers. After an eight hour fast each subject ingested a standardised meal of 95.7 MJ (400 kcal). One hour later 10 ml of one of the two antacids previously labelled with 99mTc was administered. Serial detection by anterior and posterior projection of the amount of antacid retained in the stomach was performed to determine gastric emptying of antacid. One week later the study was repeated under the same conditions with the other antacid also labelled with 99mTc. The mean (SD) percentages of antacid retained in the stomach fit a linear model with a t1/2 of 86.6 (15.3) minutes for magaldrate and 52.3 (5.2) minutes for Maalox (p less than 0.01). When the mean percentages of retention at six time intervals were compared for both antacids, it was found that Maalox emptied much faster (p less than 0.01 at 15 and 30 minutes, p less than 0.02 at 45, 60, 75, and 90 minutes).\r"

  ".U": "91324202\r", 
  ".W": "To elucidate the mechanisms that lead to sleep-disordered breathing, we have developed a mathematical model that allows for dynamic interactions among the chemical control of respiration, changes in sleep-waking state, and changes in upper airway patency. The increase in steady-state arterial PCO2 accompanying sleep is shown to be inversely related to the ventilatory response to CO2. Chemical control of respiration becomes less stable during the light stage of sleep, despite a reduction in chemoresponsiveness, due to a concomitant increase in \"plant gain\" (i.e., responsiveness of blood gases to ventilatory changes). The withdrawal of the \"wakefulness drive\" during sleep onset represents a strong perturbation to respiratory control: higher magnitudes and rates of withdrawal of this drive favor instability. These results may account for the higher incidence of periodic breathing observed during light sleep and sleep onset. Periodic ventilation can also result from repetitive alternations between sleep onset and arousal. The potential for instability is further compounded if the possibility of upper airway occlusion is also included. In systems with high controller gains, instability is mediated primarily through chemoreflex overcompensation. However, in systems with depressed chemoresponsiveness, rapid sleep onset and large blood gas fluctuations trigger repetitive episodes of arousal and hyperpnea alternating with apneas that may or may not be obstructive. Between these extremes, more complex patterns can arise from the interaction between chemoreflex-mediated oscillations of shorter-cycle-duration (approximately 36 s) and longer-wavelength (approximately 60-80 s) state-driven oscillations.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated whether the capacity of the inspiratory muscles to generate pressure and flow during a ventilatory load is related to changes in inspiratory muscle relaxation rate. Five highly motivated normal subjects performed voluntary maximal isocapnic ventilation (MIV) for 2 min. Minute ventilation and esophageal, gastric, and transdiaphragmatic pressures were measured breath by breath. We observed that ventilation, peak inspiratory and expiratory pressures, and inspiratory flow rate declined from the start of the run to reach a plateau at 60 s that was sustained for the remainder of the exercise. In a subsequent series of studies, MIV was performed for variable durations between 15 and 120 s. The normalized maximum relaxation rate of unoccluded inspiratory sniffs (sniff MRR, %pressure loss/10 ms) was determined immediately on stopping MIV. Sniff MRR slowed as the duration of MIV increased and paralleled the decline in inspiratory pressure and ventilation observed during the 2-min exercise. No further slowing in MRR occurred when ventilation became sustainable. We conclude that, during MIV, the progressive loss of ventilation and capacity to generate pressure is associated with the early onset and progression of a peripheral fatiguing process within the inspiratory muscles.\r"

Tidal volume was measured with a body plethysmograph. Blood gases were measured after a quasi-steady state was established. The kinematic viscosity of the breathing gas mixture, which changed by 1,700%, was found to have little effect on arterial PO2 and PCO2. The results are consistent with findings in a branched model that consisted of tubes with a diameter of 1 cm and with the theory of Taylor-type diffusion in turbulent flow. In addition, experiments were performed reducing and increasing the equipment dead space. This resulted in changes of PO2 and PCO2 that were appreciably less than those resulting from variations of tidal volume of the same magnitude.\r"

Superfusion with low [HCO3-]-acid mock cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (normal Pco2) induced a significant increase in ventilation, with an accompanying reduction in endtidal Pco2 (PETco2). High [HCO3-]-alkaline CSF depressed ventilation. Changes in Pco2 of superfusing CSF, on the other hand, had no significant effect despite the similar changes in pH. Simultaneous decrease in [HCO3-] and Pco2 of mock CSF with normal pH also maintained stimulated respiration. CO2 inhalation during superfusion with various [HCO3-] solutions caused further increase in ventilation as PETco2 increased. The results suggest that the surface area of the rat ventral medulla contains HCO3- (or H+)-sensitive respiratory neural substrates which are, however, little affected by CO2 in the subarachnoid fluid. A CO2 (or CO2-induced H+)-sensitive chemosensor responsible for the increase in ventilation during CO2 inhalation may exist elsewhere functionally apart from the HCO3- (or H+)-sensitive sensor in the examined surface area.\r"

Secretory macromolecules were radiolabeled biosynthetically with two precursors in the cat, [3H]glucose and [35S]sulfate, and with [35S]-sulfate only in human tissue. Both enzymes (2.6 x 10(-9) to 1.3 x 10(-6)M elastase and 8 x 10(-9) to 2.4 x 10(-6)M alkaline protease) released radiolabeled macromolecules in a concentration-dependent manner from the two preparations. Purified elastase, 1.3 x 10(-6)M, released radiolabeled macromolecules (delta 3H = +397 +/- 72%, delta 35S 225 +/- 40% over control, P less than 0.001) and periodic acid-Schiff- (PAS) reactive glycoconjugates (delta PAS = +4.1 +/- 0.96 micrograms/min or +102 +/- 20%; P less than 0.01) from cat trachea, as did alkaline protease, 2.4 x 10(-6)M (delta 3H = +356 +/- 57%, delta 35S = +176 +/- 25%, delta PAS = +7.5 +/- 1.3 micrograms/min or 194 +/- 36%, P less than 0.001). Increases in 3H exceeded those of 35S, suggesting surface epithelium as the main source of secretion. Inhibition of enzyme activity abolished secretory effects. Both enzymes also stimulated secretion from human bronchus (e.g., with elastase, 1.3 x 10(-6)M: delta 35S = +331 +/- 67%, delta PAS = +4.3 +/- 0.92 micrograms/min or +131 +/- 24%, P less than 0.001; with alkaline protease, 2.4 x 10(-6)M: delta 35S = +220 +/- 67%, delta PAS = +12.7 +/- 3.2 micrograms/min or +575 +/- 245%, P less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At birth, the lambs were randomized to receive surfactant or no treatment. Surfactant treatment improved lung function of all the groups. Corticosteroids alone and in combination with TRH improved compliance and gas exchange as well as pressure-volume curves. Corticosteroids alone dramatically decreased the recovery of intravenously administered radiolabeled albumin in the lung tissue and air space and improved the pulmonary response to surfactant treatment. There were no additional effects of TRH when given with corticosteroids on lung function or albumin leak. There were no changes in alveolar surfactant-saturated phosphatidylcholine pool sizes after any hormone treatment. The single significant effect of combined corticosteroid and TRH treatment was a fivefold increase in surfactant protein A in alveolar lavage fluid relative to all other groups.\r"

This target antigen-specific effector T cell line, M52, was derived from bulk populations of CD8+ T cells isolated from susceptible animals immunized to produce anti-tubular basement membrane (alpha TBM) disease. Our studies show that M52 retains the phenotypic and functional characteristics of nephritogenic T cells induced in vivo. M52 mediates antigen-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses to the target antigen 3M-1, it is cytotoxic to 3M-1-expressing renal tubular epithelial cells in vitro, and it adoptively transfers interstitial nephritis to naive syngeneic recipients. Clonal analysis of these nephritogenic CD8+ T cells reveals distinct functional phenotypes within the M52 cell line. We have isolated a cytotoxic CD8+ clone, M52.26, which is not DTH-reactive to 3M-1, and multiple DTH-reactive clones which mediate less efficient cytotoxicity to 3M-1-expressing target cells. Cytofluorographic analysis of four randomly selected clones reveals alpha beta T cell receptor expression. Further characterization of these functionally distinct CD8+ T cell clones will help to define their respective roles in mediating tubular epithelial cell injury and the inflammatory lesion of autoimmune interstitial nephritis.\r"

AII also stimulates formation of 5,6-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (5,6-EET) from arachidonic acid by a cytochrome P450 epoxygenase and decreases Na+ transport in the same concentration range. Because 5,6-EET mimics AII with regard to Na+ transport, it effects on calcium mobilization were evaluated. [Ca2+]i was measured by video microscopy with the fluorescent indicator fura-2 employing cultured rabbit proximal tubule. AII-induced [Ca2+]i transients were enhanced by arachidonic acid and attenuated by ketoconazole, an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 epoxygenases. Arachidonic acid also elicited a [Ca2+]i transient that was attenuated by ketoconazole. 5,6-EET augmented [Ca2+]i similar to that seen with AII, but was unaffected by ketoconazole. By contrast, the other regioisomers (8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-EET) were much less potent. [Ca2+]i transients resulted from influx through verapamil- and nifedipine-sensitive channels. These results suggest a novel mechanism for AII-induced Ca mobilization in proximal tubule involving cytochrome P450-dependent arachidonic acid metabolism and Ca influx through voltage-sensitive channels.\r"

The present studies show that cellular ATP depletion results in a rapid duration-dependent dissociation of Na+,K(+)-ATPase from the actin cytoskeleton and redistribution of Na+,K(+)-ATPase to the apical membrane. During ATP depletion, total cellular Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity was unaltered, but the Triton-X-100-insoluble fraction (cytoskeleton associated) of Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity decreased (P less than 0.01), with a corresponding increase in the detergent-soluble fraction of Na+,K(+)-ATPase (P less than 0.01). Indirect immunofluorescent studies of cells with depleted ATP revealed a redistribution of Na+,K(+)-ATPase from the basolateral membrane into the apical membrane and throughout the cytoplasm. ATP depletion also resulted in the redistribution of F-actin from a primarily cortical concentration to a perinuclear location. There was also a rapid, duration-dependent conversion of monomeric G-actin to F-actin starting during the first 5 min of ATP depletion. Taken together, these data suggest that ATP depletion causes profound alterations in cell polarity by inducing major changes in the actin cytoskeletal architecture.\r"

  ".U": "91324483\r", 
  ".W": "In normo- and hypoglycemic ferret lungs, the pulmonary vascular response to severe hypoxia (PiO2 less than or equal to 10 mmHg) is characterized by an initial intense vasoconstriction followed by marked vasodilation, whereas in hyperglycemic lungs, vasodilation is minimal, causing vasoconstriction to be sustained. In contrast, the response to moderate hypoxia is characterized by a slowly developing sustained vasoconstriction which is unaffected by glucose concentration. To determine the role of ATP-dependent K+ (KATP) channels in these responses, we examined the effects of cromakalim, which opens KATP channels, and glibenclamide, which closes them. During steady-state vasoconstriction induced in isolated ferret lungs by moderate hypoxia, cromakalim caused dose-dependent vasodilation (EC50 = 7 x 10(-7) M) which was reversed by glibenclamide (IC50 = 8 x 10(-7) M), indicating that KATP channels were present and capable of modulating vascular tone. During severe hypoxia in hypoglycemic lungs [( glucose] less than 1 mM), glibenclamide markedly inhibited the secondary vasodilation. Raising perfusate glucose concentration to 14 +/- 0.4 mM had the same effect. As a result, initial vasoconstrictor responses were well sustained. However, neither glibenclamide nor hyperglycemia affected vasoconstrictor responses to moderate hypoxia or KCl, indicating that effects during severe hypoxia were not due to nonspecific potentiation of vasoconstriction. These findings suggest that in the ferret lung (a) severe hypoxia decreased ATP concentration and thereby opened KATP channels, resulting in increased K+ efflux, hyperpolarization, vasodilation, and reversal of the initial vasoconstrictor response; and (b) hyperglycemia prevented this sequence of events.\r"

  ".W": "Human mononuclear leukocytes (MNL) exposed to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) produce net IL-1 inhibitor bioactivity with the anticipated consequences of cell cycle arrest, suppressed virus-specific proliferation, and reduced expression of activation markers. These studies were undertaken to investigate effects of exposure and resultant net IL-1 inhibitor activity on the expression of the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and its ligand the lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA-1). MNL collected at 1, 4, and 24 h after exposure to influenza virus (which induces net IL-1 bioactivity) showed enhanced expression of ICAM-1 and LFA-1 relative to sham-exposed MNL and exhibited cell clustering. In contrast, exposure to RSV was associated with suppressed expression of both ICAM-1 and LFA-1 and with minimal detectable cell clustering throughout the culture period. Influenza virus-exposed MNL produced significantly more IL-1 and IFN-gamma (which require cell-cell collaboration for optimal production) than did RSV-exposed MNL. These data raise the possibility that exposure of MNL to RSV fails to elicit or blocks the early events necessary for cellular collaboration, contributing to early suppression of the clonal expansion of RSV-specific lymphocytes.\r"

Together with CD4+ T cells, macrophages constitute a major target for infection by HIV-1. Unlike lymphocytes, however, stimulation of mononuclear phagocytes is not associated with cell division and proliferation. Human monocyte-derived macrophages transfected with HIV-LTR-CAT constructs demonstrated down-regulation of CAT activity after stimulation with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that mapped to a region distinct from NF kappa B binding sites. In contrast, fresh monocytes and the promonocytic U937 cell line both demonstrated up-regulation of HIV-LTR-CAT expression by LPS. Differentiation of U937 by PMA to establish a nondividing phenotype resulted in down-regulation of transfected HIV-LTR-CAT activity by LPS similar to that in mature macrophages. Human monocyte-derived macrophages infected with HIV-1 in vitro demonstrated a decrease in viral p24 release after incubation in LPS that was comparable to the negative regulation that occurred in the transient transfection assays. Factors controlling HIV replication may differ in dividing and nondividing hematopoietic cells and may contribute to restricted viral expression in nondividing cells.\r"

Known causes of the cutaneous manifestation were eliminated by enzyme analyses, and further characterization of the accumulated urinary O-linked sialopeptides revealed identity to those excreted by patients with an infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy due to lysosomal alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency. Investigation of the alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity and protein in the proband revealed less than 2% of normal activity and the absence of detectable immunoreactive enzyme protein, findings comparable to those in the patients with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy and alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency. In addition, the proband's unaffected offspring had half-normal levels of alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity, consistent with this enzymatic deficiency being the primary metabolic defect in this autosomal recessive trait. Ultrastructural examination of skin and blood cells from the adult proband revealed the presence of prominent lysosomal inclusions containing diffuse amorphous and filamentous material. In contrast, these morphologic findings were not observed in the nonneural tissues from patients with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy and alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency. These studies document the occurrence of two forms of alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency and sialopeptiduria, a severe infantile-onset form of neuroaxonal dystrophy without angiokeratoma or visceral lysosomal inclusions and an adult-onset form characterized by angiokeratoma, extensive lysosomal accumulation of sialoglycopeptides and the absence of detectable neurologic involvement.\r"

This study determined that strains with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (MIC of greater than or equal to 0.05 mg/l) produced no zone of inhibition around a commercially available disc containing 30 micrograms of nalidixic acid. Ciprofloxacin sensitive (MIC of less than 0.05 mg/l) strains, however, grew with a large zone (greater than 21 mm) around this disc. These observations suggest that laboratories could adopt this disc test to detect those strains for which ciprofloxacin is not appropriate treatment.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of acute and chronic ethanol exposures on the coupling of neurotensin and bradykinin receptors to phospholipase C was determined in intact N1E-115 cells. Phospholipase C was monitored by the formation of total [3H]inositol phosphates in the presence of lithium in cells prelabeled with [3H]inositol. Acute exposure to ethanol over a range of 50 to 200 mM inhibited the stimulation of [3H]inositol phosphate formation elicited by neurotensin and bradykinin. In cells chronically exposed to 100 mM ethanol for 7 days, neither basal- nor neurotensin-stimulated [3H]inositol phosphate formation differed significantly from those of control (untreated) cells. In contrast, the [3H]inositol response to bradykinin was significantly inhibited in cells chronically exposed to ethanol. Because chronic ethanol exposure had no parallel effects on either the specific binding of [3H]bradykinin or the stimulation of [3H]inositol phosphate formation by the stable GTP analog, guanine 5'-(y-thiotriphosphate), it is suggested that chronic ethanol impairs the ability of bradykinin receptors to activate the guanine nucleotide binding protein associated with phospholipase C. In addition, because chronic ethanol had no effect on the inositol phosphate response to neurotensin, it is proposed that certain types of receptor-guanine nucleotide binding protein interactions are more vulnerable than are others to disruption by chronic ethanol treatment.\r"

AA (1-1000 nmol) caused dose- and endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the presence of indomethacin and the effect was neither altered by lipoxygenase (AA 861) nor cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (alpha-naphthoflavone, ketoconazole and metyrapone) inhibitors indicating that AA-induced, endothelium-dependent vasodilation in this vascular bed was not mediated by product(s) of AA metabolism. The vasodilator effect of AA was also not altered by L-NG-nitro-arginine, methylene blue (50 microM), oxyhemoglobin (5 microM) or superoxide dismutase (50 U/ml), thus ruling out nitric oxide being its mediator. Conversely, arterial perfusion with K(+)-free or excess (50 mM) K+ Krebs' solution, but not ouabain infusion, minimized the vasodilator effect of AA, suggesting that this action of the fatty acid is due to changes in membrane K+ conductance that is independent of Na+/K(+)-adenosine triphosphatase activity. The vasodilator action of BRL 34915 (a K+ channel activator) was also minimized by extracellular K+ depletion or excess K+ (50 mM), but not by ouabain. Apamin (0.5 microM) and crude scorpion venom (2.5 micrograms/ml) attenuated AA- but not BRL 34915-induced vasodilation. Glyburide (inhibitor of ATP-activated K+ channel) abolished the vasodilator action of AA and BRL 34915. Procaine, a nonspecific K+ channel blocker did not affect AA-induced vasodilation even though it attenuated that caused by BRL 34915.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Metabolism of [5-125I-His]ebiratide occurred during a 30-min incubation with bovine brain capillaries at 37 degrees C. In the presence of 20 mM EDTA, added to inhibit this metabolism, the medium, after 30 min of incubation, contained 82.3 +/- 0.5% of the unchanged ebiratide. The total binding and acid-resistant binding of [125I]ebiratide increased with time and reached an equilibrium at about 15 min. The total binding and acid-resistant binding at 30 min (as the cell/medium ratios corrected with [14C]sucrose) were 13.07 +/- 0.86 and 5.00 +/- 0.18 microliters/mg of protein, respectively. The acid-resistant binding showed significant dependence on temperature and medium osmolarity. The [125I]ebiratide binding was significantly inhibited by dansylcadaverine, an endocytosis inhibitor. The saturable acid-resistant binding was obtained by the addition of unlabeled ebiratide (100 nM-5 mM), and the maximal internalization capacity (Bmax) at 30 min was 144.2 pmol/mg of protein, with the half-saturation constant (KD) of 62.1 microM. The nonsaturable acid-resistant binding [cell/medium ratio in the presence of the unlabeled compound (1 mM or more)] was 2.2 microliters/mg of protein. The acid-resistant binding was significantly inhibited by human ACTH, poly-L-lysine, protamine and E-2078, a basic peptide, but was not inhibited by poly-L-glutamate, insulin or transferrin. These results demonstrate that ebiratide is transported through the blood-brain barrier via a basic peptide-specific absorptive-mediated endocytosis.\r"

  ".W": "Morphine tolerance has proven to be accompanied by alterations in the efficiency of many neuronal signals, as well as by an inversion of the noradrenergic signal response of cortical acetylcholine terminals and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons in vivo (decreased acetylcholine and increased GABA release in normal animals, vice versa in tolerant). The latter observation may be relevant in interpreting morphine withdrawal, because the noradrenergic neuron firing rate increases dramatically during its course. This study was designed as an attempt to anatomically localize the inversion of the GABA response to norepinephrine. Because this phenomenon is observed in cortical slices and synaptosomes, it can be postulated that it occurs in the neocortex at the level of the intracortical GABA nerve terminals. Pharmacological analysis demonstrates that although the stimulation observed in controls is alpha-1 adrenoreceptor-mediated, the inhibition in tolerant animals is exerted via alpha-2 adrenoreceptors. Therefore, an increase in number or an improved coupling to the transduction system of alpha-2 adrenoreceptors is hypothesized. This observation gives a clue to a molecular interpretation of the inversion of GABA response to norepinephrine in tolerant animals, which may be of heuristic value in terms of biological interpretation of morphine tolerance.\r"

  ".W": "Astrocytes are likely to be a main locus for the metabolic bioactivation of the neurotoxicant 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). In this study, a detailed analysis of MPTP metabolism was conducted in primary cultures of mouse astrocytes. A constant rate of conversion of 1.22 nmol/mg of protein per hr was observed when astrocyte cultures were incubated in the presence of 250 microM MPTP for 4 days. Three metabolites were detected as products of this conversion: 1-methyl-4-phenyl-2,3-dihydropyridinium ion (MPDP+), 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+) and MPTP N-oxide. Production of MPP+ and MPTP N-oxide occurred at constant rates of 0.68 and 0.43 nmol/mg of protein per hr, respectively, whereas the level of MPDP+ remained quite stable and relatively low throughout the time of incubation. Both clorgyline, an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO) type A, and deprenyl, a MAO B inhibitor, blocked MPTP conversion to MPDP+ and MPP+; quantitative analysis of the effects of these two inhibitors revealed that MAO A and MAO B contribute to a similar extent to MPP+ production in astrocyte cultures. MAO inhibition did not result in an increased production of MPTP N-oxide and, in fact, the level of this metabolite was reduced markedly in the presence of 100 microM clorgyline. Formation of MPTP N-oxide was probably dependent upon the activity of the flavin-containing monooxygenase because: 1) it was blocked completely by thiobenzamide, a competitive substrate for this microsomal enzyme and 2) it was increased in the presence of n-octylamine, a known positive effector for flavin-containing monooxygenase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Phospholipase D (PLD) can be activated by a variety of receptor agonists in different cell types. However, an effect of prostaglandins (PGs) on the activity of this enzyme has not been demonstrated previously. In this study, we found that PGE1 could stimulate PLD in human erythroleukemia cells, as measured by phosphatidylethanol formation, with an ED50 of 3.5 x 10(-7) M. PGE2 was also active, but other PGs including prostacyclin, PGD2 and PGF2, had no effect. PGE1 also elicited cyclic AMP production over the same concentration range that activated PLD. However, it is unlikely that cyclic AMP per se is responsible for PGE-induced PLD activation, because PLD could be substantially activated by PGE2 at concentrations (0.1-1 microM) which did not stimulate cyclic AMP production. Furthermore, no increase of phosphatidylethanol formation could be observed when cells were treated with other adenylyl cyclase-activating agents such as prostacyclin, forskolin and vasoactive intestinal peptide. In Ca+(+)-free medium, PLD activation by PGE1 and PGE2 was greatly reduced, indicating that their effect was through a Ca+(+)-dependent pathway. Pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin abolished PGE1- and PGE2-stimulated PLD activity, implying the involvement of a G protein in the PGE-mediated signal transduction pathway. Our results not only indicate that E-series PGs may initiate some of their cellular effects through a novel pathway, activation of PLD, but also suggest that PGE-stimulated PLD activity in human erythroleukemia cells is Ca+(+)-dependent and is regulated via a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein.\r"

  ".W": "This report provides direct evidence for a dihydropyridine receptor/calcium channel in the insulin-secreting beta-cell line RINm5F. The receptor/channel can modulate the intracellular Ca++ concentration and the resultant insulin secretion by regulating the influx of extracellular Ca++ through dihydropyridine-sensitive voltage-dependent L-type Ca++ channels. Elevated extracellular K+ or the dihydropyridine Ca++ channel agonist, BAY k 8644 [methyl 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-3-nitro-4-(2-trifluoromethyl- phenyl)pyridine-5-carboxylate], stimulated the uptake of 45Ca++, raised [Ca++]i, and increased insulin secretion in a concentration-dependent manner. These actions were inhibited by L-type Ca++ channel blockers including nitrendipine, verapamil and diltiazem. (+)-[3H]PN200-110 bound specifically with high affinity to RINm5F cell membranes (Kd approximately 200 pM). Specific binding was inhibited competitively by dihydropyridines whereas phenylalkylamines inhibited incompletely (+)-[3H]PN200-110 binding, consistent with an allosteric interaction. The benzothiazepine diltiazem had no effect on (+)-[3H]PN200-110 binding in the presence of Ca++, but increased binding allosterically in the absence of Ca++ (in the presence of EGTA). Maximal (+)-[3H]PN200-110 binding required divalent cations, with Mg++, Mn++ and Ba++ essentially as effective as Ca++ in reversing the effects of EGTA, whereas binding was not supported by Cd++ or La . Specific high affinity (+)-[3H]PN200-110 binding was also demonstrated in intact RINm5F cells and shown to be modulated by membrane potential. Depolarization of the cells by raising extracellular K+ from 5 to 80 mM increased the affinity of (+)-[3H]PN200-110 4- to 5-fold (decreased Kd) with no significant effect on the maximum number of binding sites.\r"

Treatment consisted of an initial 70-day course of Con A at a dose of 10 micrograms/g b. wt., i.p. in sterile saline every other day. After two deaths occurred in the Con A group, treatment was stopped at day 70. The remaining animals were given two 1-week booster doses beginning on experimental days 118 and 189. The single animal in the Con A group that eventually developed IDDM at day 293 had not received an injection for 107 days. Histological examination revealed peri-islet lymphocytosis but no islet infiltration in the Con A group. Surviving control animals showed both peri-islet and islet infiltrates. One-week Con A treatment significantly suppressed in vitro responses of spleen cells to Con A and allogeneic lymphocytes. The treatment increased the frequency of \"blast-sized\" cells in vivo and decreased the CD4+/CD8+ ratio among resting splenocytes. It is concluded that polyclonal T cell activation by Con A provides protection against autoimmune diabetes in nonobese diabetic mice concomitant with phenotypic and morphologic lymphocyte changes.\r"

The demographic characteristics of the two groups were similar. Mild or no pain was reported with similar frequencies in both groups. No reduced respiration or undesired sedation was seen in either group. The postoperative times before sitting at the bedside, ambulating, tolerating clear liquids and leaving the hospital were also comparable. No complications were encountered with patient-controlled analgesia, but pruritus and alarms from apnea monitors occurred commonly in the epidural morphine group. The costs to the patient were similar for the two groups. Patient-controlled analgesia using a combined continuous infusion and demand dosing is an acceptable alternative to epidural morphine after cesarean delivery.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--A prospective regional study was conducted to determine if the observed differences in in-hospital mortality rates associated with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are solely the result of differences in patient case mix. DESIGN-Regional prospective cohort study. Data including patient demographic and historical data, body surface area, cardiac catheterization results, priority of surgery, comorbidity, and status at hospital discharge were collected. This study presents data for 3055 CABG patients between July 1, 1987, and April 15, 1989. SETTING--This study includes data from all surgeons performing cardiothoracic surgery in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont; the data were collected from five regional medical centers. PATIENTS--Data were collected from all consecutive isolated CABG surgery patients during the study period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Crude and adjusted in-hospital mortality rates associated with CABG. MAIN RESULTS--The overall crude in-hospital mortality rate for isolated CABG was 4.3%. The rate varied among centers (range, 3.1% to 6.3%) and among surgeons (range, 1.9% to 9.2%). Predictors of in-hospital mortality included increased age, female gender, small body surface area, greater comorbidity, reoperation, poorer cardiac function as indicated by a lower ejection fraction, increased left ventricular end diastolic pressure and emergent or urgent surgery. After adjusting for the effects of potentially confounding variables, substantial and statistically significant variability was observed among medical centers (P = .021) and among surgeons (P = .025). CONCLUSION--We conclude that the observed differences in in-hospital mortality rates among institutions and among surgeons in northern New England are not solely the result of differences in case mix as described by these variables and may reflect differences in currently unknown aspects of patient care. Understanding this variation requires a detailed understanding of the processes of care.\r"

Consecutive sample of all 4613 patients over a 30-month period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE. In hospital mortality rates. RESULTS. We observed differences in hospital mortality rates for patients who underwent coronary artery catheterization and CABG surgery during the same admission (diagnosis related group 106) but not for patients who underwent only CABG surgery during the admission (diagnosis related group 107). There were threefold differences in surgeon-specific mortality rates. The hospital mortality rates for coronary artery catheterization and CABG surgery during the same admission changed during the study and coincided with moves of surgeons among study hospitals. Our measures of illness severity did identify patients who were more likely to die, but differences in severity of illness did not explain differences in hospital- or surgeon-specific mortality rates. Patient mortality rates were not associated with the volume of procedures performed by individual surgeons. We found inconclusive evidence for an association with surgeons' clinical skills, and to a lesser extent, with the hospital's volume of procedures and the hospital's organization and staffing. A greater intensity of hospital services was not necessary for a lower mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that studies of CABG mortality should examine mortality rates by diagnosis related group, collect data from more than 1 year, examine associations with surgeons' clinical skills, include information on hospital organization and staffing, and cautiously explore more efficient ways of providing care.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine the relative cost and benefit of aerosolized pentamidine and the combination product of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim sulfate as secondary prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. DESIGN--A Markov-based cost-benefit analysis was performed. Drug efficacies, toxicities, and mortality rates were drawn from the current literature. SETTING--Hypothetical. PATIENT POPULATION--Patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus who had had at least one episode of P carinii pneumonia. INTERVENTIONS--Regimen 1 required the use of aerosolized pentamidine as the sole first-line prophylactic agent in all patients. Regimen 2 required the use of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim in all patients who had no history of a toxic reaction to the drug; only patients with a history of toxic effects and those who developed toxic effects while receiving the drug would receive aerosolized pentamidine. Regimen 3 required that no secondary prophylaxis be given. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Net cost, median patient survival, and 5-year survival for each regimen and for regimens 1 and 2 compared with regimen 3. MAIN RESULTS--Regimen 2 was dominant, with a net cost of $6332 per patient and a median survival of 2.050 years. Compared with no prophylaxis, regimen 2 resulted in a savings of $16,503 per patient and a 0.696-year increase in median survival. Compared with regimen 1, regimen 2 resulted in a savings of $2904 and a 0.067-year increase in median survival. CONCLUSIONS--Secondary prophylaxis for P carinii saves money and extends survival. Current data suggest that sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim should be given whenever it can be tolerated. Use of aerosolized pentamidine as a first-line agent would result in a modest increase in cost and a decrease in life expectancy.\r"

Plasma and urinary levels of RNase were measured in severely injured, hypermetabolic patients and in normal controls. Significant increases in the plasma and urinary RNase levels were seen in these polytrauma victims and they were positively correlated. Plasma RNase levels were also significantly related to blood urea nitrogen and daily urinary nitrogen excretion. Urinary clearance of RNase was increased by 220% in trauma victims, although the creatinine clearance was not affected by trauma. In a subgroup of eight patients who were fed intravenously (1.4 times basal energy expenditure calories and 250-300 mg of N per kilogram per day) for 6 days, the daily excretions of urinary RNase, nitrogen, 3-methylhistidine, creatinine, and catecholamines were measured. There was a significant negative correlation between daily urine RNase and nitrogen balance. A general increase in all the metabolic parameters on the first day of feeding was seen, suggesting a nutritional stress superimposed on the trauma-induced metabolic stress. Excretion of RNase, 3-methylhistidine, and creatinine peaked on the first day of feeding and then decreased. The normal levels could not be reached even after 6 days of adequate nutrition. The results suggest that RNase levels could be used as a biomarker of protein metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "A decrease in the formation/secretion of bile has been well documented in animals on total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Either an excess or an imbalance of amino acids (AA) has been most often implicated. In view of recent work showing that taurine promotes bile flow, bile acid secretion, and protects against hepatotoxic bile acids, the effect of adding taurine (15 mg/dL) to an AA solution was examined in guinea pigs on TPN for 3 days. The TPN-taurine group had a larger bile flow than the group without taurine and had bile acid secretory rates (BASR) similar to those of controls who were on saline by central catheter and had free access to food. Bile composition showed an increase in the secondary bile acid, 7-ketolithocholate and a concomitant decrease in chenodeoxycholate (CDC) in both experimental groups. Taurine led to a reversal of the usual predominance of glycine over taurine conjugated bile acids as well as to increases in HCO3 in cholesterol secretion. In response to a challenge with a large load of CDC, the TPN-taurine animals increased their BASR beyond those observed in the two other groups. These observations suggest that the addition of taurine to TPN solutions could play a role in the prevention of altered biliary function associated with AA solutions.\r"

  ".W": "The metabolic response to sepsis is characterized by increased proteolysis and gluconeogenesis, reduced protein synthesis, and negative nitrogen balance. The effects of a solution with a high proportion of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) on the nutritional state of septic patients were evaluated. Eighty patients with peritonitis were divided into two groups of 40 patients; group 1 was administered a solution with 22.5% BCAA and group 2 with 45% BCAA. The following parameters were evaluated: anthropometrics, creatinine/height index, urinary 3-methylhistidine, nitrogen balance, stress index, albumin, prealbumin, transferrin, retinol binding protein, lymphocytes, delayed cutaneous sensitivity tests, studies of hepatic function, and plasma aminogram. In group 2 a more positive nitrogen balance, a greater drop in the stress index, a rise in plasma prealbumin and retinol binding protein levels, an increase in the creatinine/height index, and a more marked fall in the urinary excretion of 3-methylhistidine were found. When solutions with a high BCAA content were administered, there was an increase in the plasma concentrations of these amino acids in the BCAA/aromatic amino acid quotient and a decrease in the aromatic amino acids. Plasma concentrations of leucine and valine achieved very high, potentially toxic, levels at 15 days when solutions with high BCAA content were used. It is concluded that solutions with BCAA are advisable for use in the septic patient in the increased protein catabolic phase, where positive nitrogen balance, a reduction in muscle protein catabolism, and faster recovery of muscle and visceral protein were obtained.\r"

All three solutions were isonitrogenous and isocaloric, and glutamine or glutamic acid was included at physiological levels (5% of the total amino acid content) in two of the three solutions; the third (control) contained neither glutamine nor glutamic acid. No differences were seen between groups in plasma glutamine or glutamic acid concentrations. Similarly, no effect was observed on small intestinal protein or DNA content or on the specific activities of lactase, sucrase, or maltase. These data demonstrate that in the healthy miniature piglet, parenteral glutamine or glutamic acid supplemented at physiological doses does not influence small intestinal growth and development.\r"

Short-chain fatty acid and hydrogen productions differed significantly with fiber source. The most rapid fermentation rate was with tomato followed by orange, grapefruit, apple, and finally prune fiber. Such differences in fermentability should be considered when fiber sources are selected to supplement TEN formulas.\r"

Two patients in group 1 developed liver cirrhosis; one was diabetic and died of sepsis and liver failure at the 88th month on HTPN; the other died of lung cancer at the 46th month on HTPN. The third patient, followed for 33 months, had transient severe liver function abnormalities associated with a blood transfusion. In groups 2 and 3, only one patient (with a history of probable liver disease before HTPN) developed biopsy-proven cirrhosis at the 60th month of HTPN. All four patients with clinically apparent liver disease developed persistent elevation of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) early in HTPN. Four other patients (all in group 3) with abnormal AST values in the early phase of HTPN normalized them later; they did not develop clinical liver disease over a mean follow-up time of 110 months (range, 39-152). None of the remaining eight patients (seven in group 2 and one in group 3) had significant liver function test abnormalities and none developed clinical liver disease over a mean follow-up period of 72 months (range, 39-120).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients were prospectively assigned either a fiber-free formula (FFF-OSMOLITE HN, Ross; n = 50) or a fiber-supplemented (soy polysaccharide 14.4 g/L) formula (FSF = JEVITY, Ross; n = 50). Diarrhea was defined as three or more loose or watery stools per day and occurred in 30% of all patients. Diarrhea developed in 29 (41%) of the 71 patients who received antibiotics during, or within 2 weeks prior to, the feeding period, whereas only 1 (3%) of the 29 patients not receiving antibiotics developed diarrhea (p less than 0.005); and this patient developed diarrhea on the day of death. Among the 30 patients with diarrhea, stool Clostridium difficile (CD) toxin was positive in 15 (50%), negative in 11 (37%), and was not measured in four. The mean serum albumin was significantly lower in patients with diarrhea (2.43) than in those without diarrhea (2.75) (p = 0.043). There were no significant differences in age, sex, diagnoses, number of feeding days, and percent ICU days between patients with and without diarrhea. While not statistically significant, patients who received FSF were observed to have a lower incidence of diarrhea, a lower percentage of diarrhea days per total feeding days, and a lower frequency of positive CD toxin assays than patients who received FFF. In this patient population, antibiotic usage was the factor most strongly associated with diarrhea during tube feedings.\r"

Seven malnourished children were studied during the first 3 weeks of TPN. Weight-for-height = 81.4 +/- 8.0%, with an initial weight of 4.5 +/- 3.3 kg.

The technique required endoscopy with externalization of gastric and intestinal ports through the abdominal wall. Feedings were begun through the intestinal tube with Vital HN within 4 hours of its insertion with simultaneous gastric decompression via the gastric tube. Tubes were placed 2.3 (range 0-5) days after injury. Full caloric intake (3020 kcal/24 h) was achieved by 6.8 (range 2-8) days after injury to 4.2 (range 2-8) days after placement of the feeding tube. Only 1 patient failed to tolerate feedings immediately after tube insertion. Technical inability to insert the tubes occurred in 3 patients and the intestinal tube migrated into the stomach in 2 patients; diarrhea occurred in only 1 patient. With this technique, it was possible to deliver an average daily intake of 1.2 g/kg of protein in 8-day balance periods beginning at the time of tube insertion. These data included 3- to 4-day periods in which feedings were steadily increased. In 16 patients in whom nitrogen balance was measured for 8-day balance periods, average nitrogen balance was -5.7 (range -11.3 to +3.5) g/24 h. The reduction in nitrogen loss by this technique appears equal to or superior to either gastric feeding or TPN. This technique provides the ability to enterally feed a high proportion of brain-injured patients (except those in barbiturate coma) very early after injury using a bedside procedure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In all experiments, greater than 97% of the cholic acid appearing in bile was conjugated with taurine or glycine. The pattern of taurine and glycine bile acid conjugation, however, was dependent on the availability of taurine in the perfusate medium. Thus, in the absence of Trophamine infusion, the percentage of cholic acid conjugated with taurine (ie, taurocholate) declined throughout the course of the cholic acid infusion. Trophamine infusion increased the ratio of biliary taurocholate/glycocholate by 4.5-fold over that observed in the absence of the amino acid infusion. Increasing the amount of taurine in Trophamine by 2- or 5-fold resulted in a 1.8- and 4.3-fold increase, respectively, in the taurocholate/glycocholate ratio over that observed during the Trophamine infusion. Infusion of taurine alone, at an equimolar concentration of taurine as that in Trophamine, resulted in a similar taurocholate/glycocholate ratio as that observed during the Trophamine infusion. These data indicate that taurine availability, even in the presence of high concentrations of glycine and other amino acids in Trophamine, appears to be the most important factor in determining the pattern of bile acid conjugation in the isolated perfused rat liver.\r"

Ten patients with SCI and 20 controls with nonspinal cord injury (NSCI) matched for time, sex, age, and injury severity score (ISS) were admitted to our Level I trauma center. In both groups, total nutritional support was delivered within 72 hours of admission based on predicted energy expenditures (PEE = Harris-Benedict equation x 1.2 x 1.6) and 2 g of protein/kg of ideal body weight (IBW). Subsequent changes in nutrient delivery were based on NB. No SCI patient established positive NB during the 7-week period following injury despite an average delivery of 2.4 g of protein/kg IBW and 120% of the PEE at the time of peak negative NB (-10.5). In six SCI patients, an average increase of 25% in delivered protein and 12% in delivered calories over a 1-week period effected no change in average NB (-7.4 vs -6.8). Indirect calorimetry in five SCI patients showed that calorie intakes were 110% more than average measured energy expenditures. In contrast, 17 of 20 NCSI patients achieved positive NB within 3 weeks of admission. They required an average delivery of 2.3 g of protein/kg IBW and 110% of PEE to reach positive NB. These data demonstrate the phenomenon of obligatory negative NB acutely following SCI. Aggressive attempts to achieve positive NB in these patients will fail and result in overfeeding.\r"

  ".W": "The use of home parenteral nutrition (HPN) in patients with inoperable malignant bowel obstruction (IMBO) is controversial. The efficacy, safety, and indications for HPN in these patients is uncertain, and its benefit is difficult to demonstrate. The records of 17 patients (9, ovarian cancer; 4, colon cancer; 4, other) with IMBO receiving HPN managed by the Nutrition Support Team (NST) at Yale-New Haven Hospital from 1980 to 1989 were reviewed. Median survival was 53 days and was longest in the two patients with appendiceal carcinomatosis (208 and 159 days), intermediate in patients with colon cancer (median 90 days), and shortest in patients with ovarian cancer (median 39 days). Survival was unrelated to age or sex. All patients died of their underlying disease; 82% of deaths occurred at home. Only one treatment-related complication requiring readmission occurred. Fourteen patients and their families (82%) perceived their therapy as highly beneficial or beneficial. The NST agreed with this assessment in 11 patients but did not share this perception in three patients. These three patients had a short duration of HPN (less than 25 days) or minimal rehabilitation. It is concluded that HPN for patients with IMBO is associated with a low complication rate, may be most beneficial for those patients with gastrointestinal tract primary tumors, and is usually perceived by patients and care providers as beneficial. HPN has palliative benefit and facilitates compassionate home care for carefully selected patients with IMBO.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the incidence of clinically significant pneumatosis intestinalis and intestinal necrosis with the use of needle catheter jejunostomy in 217 consecutive patients who had undergone complicated abdominal operations or selected bariatric procedures. The needle catheter jejunostomy was used to deliver immediate postoperative nutrition, maintenance, and replacement fluids, and selected medications. In this group, no serious complications requiring surgical intervention were related to the use of needle catheter jejunostomies. Clinically significant pneumatosis intestinalis was encountered in two of 217 patients (1%). With the needle catheter jejunostomy in place, both patients improved rapidly when enteral feedings were discontinued and parenteral antibiotics were administered. None of the 217 patients developed ischemic intestinal necrosis. We conclude that 1) clinically significant pneumatosis is a rare complication of enteric feeding via needle catheter jejunostomy when the intrajejunal feeding is begun with a diluted, hypoosmolar solution with stepwise increases in osmolality, and 2) patients who do develop clinically significant pneumatosis (n = 2) seem to respond rapidly to a temporary stoppage of enteral feedings and administration of parenteral antibiotics.\r"

  ".W": "It is widely accepted that early enteral nutrition is beneficial to critically ill patients. Diarrhea is a common problem in this setting and is often erroneously ascribed to enteral feedings. More often medications cause the diarrhea. Multiple cases of severe diarrhea associated with the use of a sugar-free theophylline solution (SFTS) were discovered by a nutrition support team. SFTS may induce an osmotic diarrhea because it contains sorbitol. A 55-year-old man admitted for a dissecting aneurysm was started on isotonic formula enteral feedings and within a day of starting SFTS developed severe diarrhea. The sorbitol-induced osmotic diarrhea persisted for 36 of his 83 days of hospitalization with direct cost for the evaluation of this diarrhea being $4,250. His prolonged hospitalization cost $166,200. A retrospective review of 20 consecutive patients receiving SFTS revealed that 15 patients had diarrhea for 2 or more consecutive days compared with 20 patients receiving iv aminophylline, of whom only two patients had diarrhea. Furthermore, SFTS was administered to healthy volunteers and a prominent breath hydrogen response was noted. The polyalcohol sorbitol is used as a sweetner in \"sugar-free\" products and not quantified on labeling because it is considered an inactive ingredient. Nutritionists should be aware that medicinal solutions can contain enough sorbitol to create a laxative effect which is an easily reversible cause of diarrhea in enterally fed patients.\r"

  ".W": "While the rate of malnutrition is relatively modest in alcoholic patients without alcoholic liver disease, the rate of malnutrition is virtually 100% in patients with alcoholic hepatitis and/or alcoholic cirrhosis. The reasons for malnutrition in the alcoholic hepatitis patient include various factors such as anorexia, poor diet, malabsorption, and altered metabolic state. When the patient is hospitalized, the malnutrition frequently worsens because of fasting for tests, continued anorexia, and complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with severe acute hepatitis appear to be both hypermetabolic and hypercatabolic, whereas data are much more conflicting concerning patients with more stable liver disease. Most studies suggest that patients with alcoholic liver disease require at least 60 g of protein per day to maintain positive nitrogen balance. Consistent alterations in plasma amino acid profiles occur in alcoholic liver disease, and specialized nutritional formulations have been devised to correct this amino acid profile with the intent of improving overall nutritional status, hepatic encephalopathy, and mortality. The effects of nutritional support (including use of specialized products) on outcome, on acute hepatic encephalopathy, and on chronic or latent portal systemic encephalopathy are reviewed.\r"

Even this substitution, however, can introduce a difference in metabolism that may be quantitatively important with regard to the development of the mathematical model used to interpret the kinetic data. The doubly labeled water method for the measurement of carbon dioxide production and hence energy expenditure in free-living subjects is a good example of how differences between the metabolism of the tracers and the tracee can influence the accuracy of the carbon dioxide production rate determined from the kinetic data.\r"

  ".W": "Preliminary experimental studies in our laboratory have shown that autologous pericardium treated with glutaraldehyde prevents late deterioration and calcification of the tissue. For this reason, glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardium has been used in a series of 64 patients who underwent operations for leaflet extension of the mitral valve between 1980 and 1989. Ages ranged from 2.5 to 60 years (mean 19 +/- 15). The causes of mitral valve insufficiency were rheumatic fever (69%), bacterial endocarditis (17%), congenital (8%), endomyocardial fibrosis (4.5%), and trauma (1.5%). The autologous tissue was fixed in a 0.62% glutaraldehyde solution for 15 minutes and rinsed in saline for an additional 15 minutes. Patching techniques varied depending on the site and the extent of the lesion. Associated mitral valve repair techniques (Carpentier's techniques) were mandatory in all patients. The period of follow-up extended from 6 months to 9 years (mean 3.1 +/- 2.5 years). There were no operative deaths in this series, and there was one late death (2%). In the six patients (12%) who underwent reoperation, there has been no case of calcification of the pericardial patch. Postoperative mitral valve function was assessed by bidimensional color Doppler echocardiographic techniques. Mitral valve insufficiency was trivial or absent in 80% of the patients. This experience permits us to conclude that leaflet extension is a simple and safe technique in valve reconstruction, allowing repair of mitral valves that otherwise would need to be replaced. It permits use of an adult-size prosthetic ring in children. Glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardium is the material of choice for this type of repair.\r"

Endothelial cells died within 1 day after seeding on the commercial tissue; however, considerable endothelial cell proliferation was measured, even 14 days after seeding on L-glutamic acid-treated pericardium. Improved biocompatibility of this alternative treatment may be due to stable chemical binding of free, reactive aldehyde groups.\r"

  ".W": "Atrial natriuretic hormone is released from the right atrial appendage in response to atrial distention. During cardiac operations the right atrial appendage is usually partially removed or ligated for venous cannulation. To evaluate the effect of right atrial appendectomy on the release of atrial natriuretic hormone and its natriuretic and diuretic responses, we prospectively randomized into two groups 23 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass operations. There were 16 male and 7 female patients with a mean age of 62 +/- 7 years. Group A (n = 11) had the right atrial appendage removed, and group B (n = 12) had the right atrial appendage preserved and venous cannulation done lateral to the appendage. The two groups were comparable for sexual distribution, age, number of grafts, and extracorporeal bypass time. All patients had normal left ventricular and renal functions, and they did not receive any diuretics during the study period. The patients were studied both preoperatively and postoperatively whereby the atrial natriuretic hormone serum levels, urine volume per minute, fractional excretion of sodium, amount of sodium excreted, and central venous pressure were measured before and after volume expansion with 5% albumin, 7.5 ml/kg. There was no statistical difference in these parameters preoperatively. In the postoperative period, however, group B patients had higher atrial natriuretic hormone levels after volume expansion than group A patients (376 +/- 84 versus 184 +/- 31 pg/ml; p less than 0.05), higher urine volume per minute (4.4 +/- 1.0 versus 2.0 +/- 0.4 ml/min; p less than 0.05), higher fractional excretion of sodium (2.30 +/- 0.66 versus 0.64 +/- 0.19; p less than 0.02), and higher amount of sodium excreted (511.1 +/- 150.9 versus 83.9 +/- 22.8 mmol/min; p less than 0.02). The central venous pressure was similar both before (9 +/- 1 versus 9 +/- 1 mm Hg) and after (16 +/- 1 versus 15 +/- 1 mm Hg) volume expansion in both groups. We conclude that preserving the right atrial appendage during cardiac operations significantly increased the release of atrial natriuretic hormone, resulting in increased urinary sodium excretion and better diuresis in the postoperative period.\r"

Anticoagulation was monitored by anti-Xa, antithrombin activity, and activated partial thromboplastin time. To evaluate factors that might influence absorption, body weight, body fat, and abdominal skinfold thickness were recorded. There was a pronounced inter-individual variability in absorption but the absorption of the two fractions of heparin was similar. The highly variable absorption was related to the abdominal skinfold thickness, and this could have implications for therapeutic and prophylactic heparin regimens.\r"

This shift occurred in spite of the average or below-average affinity of this group of antibodies.

  ".W": "Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a lymphocytotropic hormone which is thought to have a key role in the immune response of mammalian cells. It is produced by a subpopulation of activated T-lymphocytes and acts in vitro as the principal auto- and paracrine T-cell growth factor (for reviews see refs 1-3). IL-2 is, however, not the sole T-cell growth factor, nor does it act exclusively on T cells, also promoting growth of NK cells and differentiation of B cells. A role for IL-2 in T-cell development has been postulated but remains controversial. Here we test the requirement for IL-2 in vivo using IL-2-deficient mice generated by targeted recombination. We find that mice homozygous for the IL-2 gene mutation are normal with regard to thymocyte and peripheral T-cell subset composition, but that a dysregulation of the immune system is manifested by reduced polyclonal in vitro T-cell responses and by dramatic changes in the isotype levels of serum immunoglobulins.\r"

Recently we used fd phage to display antibody fragments fused to a minor coat protein, allowing enrichment of phage with antigen. Using a random combinatorial library of the rearranged heavy (VH) and kappa (V kappa) light chains from mice immune to the hapten 2-phenyloxazol-5-one (phOx), we have now displayed diverse libraries of antibody fragments on the surface of fd phage. After a single pass over a hapten affinity column, fd phage with a range of phOx binding activities were detected, at least one with high affinity (dissociation constant, Kd = 10(-8) M). A second pass enriched for the strong binders at the expense of the weak. The binders were encoded by V genes similar to those found in anti-phOx hybridomas but in promiscuous combinations (where the same V gene is found with several different partners). By combining a promiscuous VH or V kappa gene with diverse repertoires of partners to create hierarchical libraries, we elicited many more pairings with strong binding activities. Phage display offers new ways of making antibodies from V-gene libraries, altering V-domain pairings and selecting for antibodies with good affinities.\r"

  ".W": "The oncoprotein c-Jun is thought to be a mediator of ras transformation as both its synthesis and activity as a transcription factor are stimulated by ras expression. But c-Jun co-operates with ras in transformation assays, suggesting that they act along different pathways (reviewed in ref. 4). Here we show by means of a dominant-negative mutated transcription factor that c-Jun potentially in conjunction with other factors that interact with it is necessary for transformation by ras. The mutant Jun lacks an activation domain and blocks stimulation of transcription by several oncoproteins, including Ras, v-Src, polyoma middle T, c-Jun and c-Fos, as well as by the tumour promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). The inhibition is specific for motifs that bind Jun: activation of an NF-kappa B/Rel motif is not affected. This Jun mutant acts as an anti-oncogene in ras-transformed cells, generating non-transformed revertants that have acquired anchorage and density-dependent growth, as well as reduced tumorigenicity in vivo. Mutants of other transcription factors designed to inhibit transformation will enable us to study their role in signal transduction.\r"

To assess these factors in two such dressings, Biobrane (temporary wound dressing) (Winthrop) and Duoderm (hydrocolloid dressing) (Convatec), we compared them with a conventional fine mesh gauze dressing, xeroform, in a prospective, randomized study of 30 donor sites in the same number of patients. Wounds were considered healed when they were 100 per cent re-epithelialized and required no further dressings. Patient self-assessment of pain was quantified on a scale of zero to ten, with ten being the most severe pain. Donor sites dressed with xeroform had a healing time of 10.5 days, which was significantly better (p less than 0.05) than Duoderm (15.3 days) or Biobrane (19.0 days), although the protocol for Duoderm use (wound visualization at seven day intervals) extended the apparent healing times in this group. Duoderm was the most comfortable dressing (0.53 grade) when compared with Biobrane (1.44) and xeroform (2.41, p less than 0.05). No infections occurred in donor sites dressed with xeroform, but two developed in patients using Biobrane. One patient with a Duoderm dressing had a donor site infection during a drug-related neutropenic reaction. Xeroform was the least expensive dressing to use ($1.16 per patient), followed by Duoderm ($54.88 per patient) and Biobrane ($102.57 per patient). The results of our study confirm the usefulness of xeroform as a donor site dressing as it promotes relatively rapid healing, is easy to use and is inexpensive. We found Duoderm to be ideal for smaller donor sites when pain could be significantly reduced with minimal increase in cost. Biobrane is too costly and the infection rate too high for it to be used routinely as a skin graft donor site dressing.\r"

The basal PTH values were elevated in all but six of 89 patients and provided clear separation towards normal individuals (n = 75) and patients with hypercalcemia of other origin (n = 34). The PTH value correlated with the serum calcium concentration in hyperparathyroidism and with the weight of excised parathyroid adenomas but not with that of chief cell hyperplasias. A constant ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid infusion during 60 minutes of induced essentially linear reductions of plasma-ionized calcium concentrations, averaging 0.02 mmol/L/10 minutes, which were associated with swift, curvilinear, elevations of PTH levels that reached a plateau after 10 to 20 minutes. The increment in serum PTH level correlated with the basal PTH value both in patients with hyperparathyroidism and controls. However, in proportion to the much greater glandular mass in the patients with hyperparathyroidism, the secretion of PTH was relatively reduced. The findings support the value of the intact PTH assay in the differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia and show that PTH secretion in vivo is extremely sensitive to hypocalcemic stimulation, that the pathological parathyroid tissue in hyperparathyroidism is characterized by a reduction of hormone release per unit weight, and that the hormone secretion in hyperparathyroidism operates closer to its maximal capacity than under normal circumstances.\r"

With all three regimens, long survival was frequently achieved with good intestinal adsorption and weight gain, but histopathologic evidence of intestinal rejection existed in the most lightly treated animals. The liver, stomach, and pancreas had only minor abnormalities. Rejection of isolated intestinal grafts was more difficult to control based on histopathologic criteria, and satisfactory results were obtained only with the most aggressive treatment protocol, suggesting that the liver in the MVTX had provided an advantage to the companion organs of the graft, of which the intestine was most vulnerable. Histopathologically, the lymphoid elements of the intestine, including the Peyer's patches, appeared to be the most immunogenic component of the intestine. Epithelium near lymphoid areas was secondarily involved with villous atrophy, cryptitis, and abscess formation. Beginning within 12 days in successful MVTX experiments, the lymphoreticular components of the graft intestine, including the Peyer's patches, lamina propria, and mesenteric nodes, were shown with anti-Ia monoclonal antibodies to be repopulated with recipient cells. This finding in grafts that appeared to be permanently accepted was surprising and contrary to expectations from the literature on intestinal allotransplantation.\r"

Intravital fluorescent microscopy and fluorescein-labeled albumin were used to evaluate disruption of the blood-brain barrier under control conditions and during acute arterial hypertension in 10 rats equipped with an open cranial window and in six rats equipped with a closed cranial window. Permeability of the blood-brain barrier was quantified by calculating the clearance of fluorescein-labeled albumin and by counting the number of microvascular leaky sites under control conditions and during acute hypertension. Pressure in cerebral venules and intracranial pressure were measured in rats equipped with an open cranial window and a closed cranial window, respectively, under control conditions and during acute hypertension. In rats equipped with an open cranial window, arterial pressure increased from 118 +/- 6 to 189 +/- 3 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM) and pial venous pressure increased from 7 +/- 1 to 22 +/- 3 mm Hg during acute hypertension induced with 30 micrograms/kg/min phenylephrine for 5 minutes. In addition, the clearance of fluorescent albumin increased from 0.11 +/- 0.03 to 1.2 +/- 0.4 ml/sec x 10(-6) and the number of microvascular leaky sites increased from 0 to 25 +/- 1 during phenylephrine infusion. In rats equipped with a closed cranial window, arterial pressure increased from 122 +/- 5 to 187 +/- 7 mm Hg and intracranial pressure increased from 3 +/- 1 to 12 +/- 1 mm Hg during the intravenous infusion of 30 micrograms/kg/min phenylephrine for 5 minutes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Neurological examination was performed 24 hours after occlusion. We quantified infarct size by 2,3,5-triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride, hematoxylin and eosin, and Nissl staining and by computerized analysis of tracings of the infarcted areas and evaluated neuronal injury at the infarct periphery. The different types of ischemic cell damage were quantified by direct visual counting. We found no differences among saline-, placebo-, and PN 200-110-treated rats regarding infarct size, amount of neuronal alteration, and neurological outcome. Our results indicate the lack of a significant protective effect of this drug in experimental focal ischemia.\r"

Similar studies on DNA from maternal lymphocytes showed random X-chromosome inactivation. Among a total of 40 independent maternal fibroblast clones isolated by dilution plating and analyzed for IDS activity, no IDS- clone was found. Somatic cell hybrid clones containing at least one active human X chromosome were produced by fusion of patient fibroblasts with Hprt- hamster fibroblasts (RJK88) and grown in HAT-ouabain medium. Methylation-sensitive RFLP analysis of DNA from the hybrids showed that of the 22 clones that retained the DXS255 locus (M27 beta), all contained the paternal allele in the methylated (active) form. No clone was isolated containing only the maternal X chromosome, and in no case was the maternal allele hypermethylated. We postulate from these studies that the patient has MPS II as a result of a mutation resulting in both the disruption of the IDS locus on her paternal X chromosome and unbalanced inactivation of the nonmutant maternal X chromosome.\r"

The PrP gene encodes a host glycoprotein of unknown function and is located on the short arm of chromosome 20, a region with few known genes or anonymous markers. The complete structure of the PrP gene in man has not been determined despite considerable interest in its relationship to these unusual disorders. We have determined that the human PrP gene has the same simple genomic structure seen in the hamster gene and consists of two exons and a single intron. In contrast to the hamster PrP gene the human gene appears to have a single major transcriptional start site. The region immediately 5' of the transcriptional start site of the human PrP gene demonstrates the GC-rich features commonly seen in housekeeping genes. Curiously, the genomic clone we have isolated contains a 24-bp deletion that removes one of five octameric peptide repeats predicted to form a B-pleated sheet in this region of the PrP. We have also identified 5' of the PrP gene an RFLP which has a high degree of heterozygosity and which should serve as a useful marker for the pter-12 region of human chromosome 20.\r"

The sample was composed of males and females, selected for health, from two populations, those of exclusively French-Canadian (FC) and those of some non-French-Canadian (NFC) ancestry. An approach suggested by Weir and Cockerham, which includes estimates of nonrandom association (disequilibria) between three and four alleles at two loci as well as the traditional associations between two alleles, at two loci was used. The pattern of departures from HW equilibria suggested that the genetic structures of the FC and NFC are different. Departure from HW equilibrium at an RFLP locus could not be predicted from information about other loci in the same gene region. Nonrandom associations were also evident from the pairwise analyses. Two pairs of loci had significant diallelic disequilibria, while two other pairs had significant triallelic disequilibria. All of the RFLP pairs had at least one measure of disequilibrium at its maximum value determined by allele frequencies. Inferences about pairwise disequilibria depended on the statistical approach used. Sizes of the pairwise disequilibria were not correlated with the physical distance between loci. The impact of these disequilibria on RFLP-phenotype association studies is discussed.\r"

The mutation was characterized using PCR techniques with both patient cDNA and genomic DNA, followed by sequencing of the products. E1 beta cDNA sequence was found to be the same as that in controls. The deletion causes a frameshift and the occurrence of a premature stop codon. Western blot analysis revealed an extra band migrating just above the PDH E1 beta band. Northern blot analysis showed normal levels of both E1 alpha and E1 beta message when probed with the respective cDNAs. However, a larger intermediate-size transcript was observed for this patient in the E1 beta blot. The 20-bp deletion was not found in either parent's genomic DNA, and hence we conclude that the mutation must have occurred de novo, either in the germ-line cells or immediately following fertilization.\r"

A 165-nucleotide duplication (positions 1103-1267) was found in two infantile patients, producing an abnormally large mRNA; one patient was probably a homozygote, and the other was a heterozygote of this mutation. The other two infantile patients had different mutations; a 123 Gly(GGG)----Arg(AGG) mutation in one patient and a 316 Tyr(TAT)----Cys(TGT) mutation in the other. A 201 Arg(CGC)----Cys(TGC) mutation, eliminating a BspMI site, was detected in a late-infantile/juvenile patient; the restriction-site analysis of amplified genomic DNA confirmed his heterozygosity for this mutation. A 51 Ile(ATC)----Thr(ACC) mutation was found in all five adult/chronic patients examined in this study. It created a SauI site, and restriction-site analysis confirmed that four patients were homozygous mutants. The other was a compound heterozygote for this mutation and another 457 Arg(CGA)----Gln(CAA) mutation. These mutant genes expressed markedly decreased or completely deficient enzyme activities in beta-galactosidase-deficient human fibroblasts transformed by adenovirus-SV40 recombinants. We conclude that gene mutations are heterogeneous in GM1-gangliosidosis but that the 51 Ile(ATC)----Thr(ACC) mutation is common among the Japanese adult/chronic cases. Genotype-phenotype correlations in GM1-gangliosidosis are briefly discussed.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective evaluation of patient-level Medicaid claims data from two states was undertaken to discern the fiscal utility of transdermally delivered clonidine versus both the oral formulation of clonidine and oral formulations of eight other antihypertensive agents. In the first phase of our two-part study, we compared paid claims data (n = 1,135) from Florida for transdermal and oral clonidine. Multivariate regression analysis was used to evaluate the incremental impact of six variables on health-care expenditures in the first year after patients were given a diagnosis of hypertension. These variables were: age, gender, prior utilization of medical services, regimen complexity, and dosage formulation. Patients prescribed transdermal clonidine experienced a significant (p less than or equal to 0.001) increase in prescription expenditures and significant reductions in the use of physician (p less than or equal to 0.05), laboratory (p less than or equal to 0.10), and hospital (p less than or equal to 0.05) services. Moreover, savings were maximized (p less than or equal to 0.001) where multi-drug regimens incorporated the transdermal delivery system. In the second phase of our study we compared paid claims data (n = 8,894) from South Carolina for transdermal clonidine and for nine oral antihypertensive agents: atenolol, captopril, clonidine, diltiazem, enalapril, metoprolol, prazosin, terazosin, and verapamil-SR. Once again, regression analysis was used, this time to evaluate the incremental impact of five variables on health-care expenditures in the first year post diagnosis: age, gender, prior utilization of medical services, regimen complexity, and Medication Possession Ratio (MPR), an index of compliance. The data from part 2 of our study revealed that patients assigned a b.i.d. oral antihypertensive agent experienced a significant reduction (p less than or equal to 0.05) in MPR and a significant (p less than 0.05) increase in health-care expenditures when compared to patients prescribed the transdermal delivery system and to patients prescribed once-daily oral medications. These data confirm previous findings concerning the impact of complicated dosing regimens on compliance in hypertensive patients. In this two-part paper we report the data from both phases of our study.\r"

  ".U": "91328206\r", 
  ".W": "PURPOSE: The rise in health care costs has occasioned a number of initiatives in an attempt to reduce the rate of increase. Despite the growth of health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations and the introduction of Medicare's prospective payment system, health care costs have continued to increase. Coincident with these efforts, a number of researchers have shown that there exists wide variation in age-adjusted hospital discharge rates, which translate into significant variation in per capita expenditures. Much of the focus on the reasons for hospital admission variability has been on physician practice variation. If most of the variation in hospital discharge rates is due to physician practice style, then payment systems can be developed (e.g., capitation) that limit physician practice variation without harming patients. We examined socioeconomic factors in Michigan communities to assess their association with hospital discharge rates for patients with musculoskeletal diseases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data on hospital discharges from 1980 and 1987 were taken from the Michigan Inpatient Data Base. All admissions from the major diagnostic category 8, diagnosis-related group (DRG) 209-256 were included. Zip code-specific hospitalization data were grouped into small geographic areas or hospital market communities (HMCs). Discharge rates were calculated, and profiles of the socioeconomic characteristics of each of the HMCs were developed. A Poisson regression model with an extrasystematic component of variance was used to analyze the association of HMC socioeconomic characteristics with age-adjusted hospital use. RESULTS: We found that four socioeconomic variables, average annual income per capita, percent of the population with four years of college, percent of the population living in an urban area, and percent of families with incomes below the poverty line, explained 26.6% (R2) of the variation in overall hospital discharge rates (p less than 0.001). Moreover, we found that the ability of the model to explain variability was influenced by the type of disease, and that these socioeconomic variables had a consistent effect across the range of DRGs. Finally, we noted that, over the period of 1980 to 1987, socioeconomic factors remained important in explaining hospital use despite the dramatic changes in the delivery of care over this period. CONCLUSION: Socioeconomic factors play a significant role in explaining the observed variation in hospital discharge rates for musculoskeletal diseases. Models utilizing only physician practice variation to account for the population-based differences in discharge rates are overly simplistic. In order to ensure that vulnerable subsets of the population are not harmed by the introduction of cost-containment strategies based on simplistic models, more attention must be paid to the socioeconomic and epidemiologic factors related to hospital use.\r"

  ".W": "Class I and class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene products are key recognition units in the induction and regulation of the immune response. Expression of class I and class II may be constitutive or inducible by cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). A key step in the induction of MHC genes is recognition of IFN-gamma by its membrane receptor. The work described here examines the regulation of the occupied IFN-gamma receptor by the cytoskeleton. To do this the authors have used the fungal metabolites dihydrocytochalasin B (DHCB) and cytochalasin D (CD), substances that bind to actin filaments and thereby disrupt the cytoskeleton. The authors have studied the effect of DHCB and CD on IFN-gamma-induced MHC gene expression in 143 B cells, a human osteosarcoma-derived cell line. Herein the authors demonstrate that alterations in the cytoskeleton induced by DHCB and CD can lead to increases in IFN-gamma-induced MHC gene expression. Dihydrocytochalasin B added up to 3 hours after IFN-gamma results in a threefold to sixfold increase in levels of class II mRNA while producing minimal enhancement of class I gene expression. In contrast, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA expression was unaltered by IFN-gamma or by the cytochalasins. The increased amount of class II mRNA can be accounted for by a concomitant increase in transcription rate of this gene. Studies using 125I-IFN-gamma demonstrate that the occupied IFN-gamma receptor associates with a Triton X-100 insoluble fraction of 143 B cells and that DHCB and CD markedly inhibit this association. The results described here provide evidence that is consistent with the hypothesis that the activity of the occupied IFN-gamma receptor may be modulated by interactions with the cytoskeleton of the cell. This receptor may be one of a group of plasma membrane receptors that are sensitive to the action of cytochalasins after ligand binding.\r"

The incidence of injury was 3.7 injuries per 1000 hours of soccer per player. The incidence increased with age, and at the higher ages within the youth players, approached the incidence rate of senior players (age greater than or equal to 18 years). Seventy percent of the injuries were located in the lower extremities, particularly the knee (26%) and ankle (23%). Back pain occurred in 14% of players. Fractures, which accounted for 4% of injuries, were most often in the upper extremities. We conclude that youth soccer is a relatively low-risk sport with an injury pattern that differs slightly from that of senior players.\r"

Players with syndesmotic sprains missed significantly more games and practices and they received substantially more treatments than players with lateral ankle sprains. Physical examination findings, results of radiographic evaluations, and etiologic factors are discussed. The external rotation stress test, a clinical method for diagnosis of this type of sprain at the time of injury, is described. Results of this study clearly demonstrate a prolonged recovery time for syndesmotic ankle sprains. Physicians and trainers who are aware of this injury can differentially diagnose these two types of sprains in the early postinjury period by the method described.\r"

The purified recombinant S. mansoni tropomyosin was tested as an immunodiagnostic reagent in Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Sera from individual patients with chronic S. mansoni infection, but not S. haematobium, S. japonicum, parasitic infections other than schistosomiasis, and without infection reacted with the recombinant tropomyosin.

Only a small number of animals immunized with certain recombinants or irradiated sporozoites became fully protected against sporozoite challenge. Preimmunization and postimmunization plasma samples obtained from 30 monkeys on the day of challenge were tested in an in vitro assay based on sporozoite development into exoerythrocytic stages in primary cultures of Saimiri monkey hepatocytes. The percentage of inhibition was determined by comparison of the number of exoerythrocytic stages developing from sporozoites preincubated with a preimmunization and a postimmunization plasma sample of each animal. The plasma samples of the day of challenge of nearly all the immunized animals had a variable, but significant inhibitory effect, when compared with the corresponding preimmunization sample. We found no correlation between the degree of in vitro inhibition of liver stage development, and the in vivo protection against sporozoite challenge of individual animals. The variable results of the incubation of sporozoites with \"normal\" plasma of different animals indicates that the in vitro results were affected by plasma factors unrelated to anti-sporozoite antibodies.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the effects of halothane on segmental vascular responses to hypoxia, we used cardiopulmonary bypass with venous outflow divided into three compartments (splanchnic, coronary, and \"other\") in dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium. The reservoir volume changes represented the inverted changes in systemic blood volume (SBV). In addition, sympathetic efferent nerve activity (SENA) was simultaneously recorded from the ventral ansa subclavian nerve. Experiments were done in two groups: severe hypoxia (PO2 of 19 mm Hg) and moderate hypoxia (PO2 of 50 mm Hg). Hypoxia provoked a significant decrease in SBV of 22.3 +/- 3.1 mL/kg and 10.5 +/- 1.6 mL/kg during severe and moderate hypoxia, respectively. Two percent end-tidal halothane attenuated the decrease in SBV to 10.3 +/- 1.3 mL/kg during severe hypoxia, and 1% halothane attenuated the decrease to 3.7 +/- 1.4 mL/kg during moderate hypoxia. Subsequent chemoreceptor denervation in the presence of 1% halothane completely abolished the moderate hypoxia-induced decrease in SBV. In the presence of halothane, vascular resistance during hypoxia was significantly less than that during control conditions. Sympathetic efferent nerve activity increased significantly during severe and moderate hypoxia by about 180% and 55%, respectively. During severe hypoxia, halothane did not cause any change in the response of SENA, whereas during moderate hypoxia, halothane tended to decrease SENA, but not significantly, and subsequent chemoreceptor denervation completely abolished the increase in SENA. Coronary resistance showed a hypoxia-induced reduction that was not influenced by halothane. These results suggest that acute hypoxia causes a decrease in SBV dependent on the severity of hypoxia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

CO2 levels of approximately 20% were consistently observed in all carbonated beverages. The CO2 levels obtained with sodium bicarbonate, Maalox, and sodium citrate were 19.3%, 2.0%, and 0%, respectively. CO2 waveforms were observed during esophageal ventilation in five of six animals after intragastric administration of a carbonated beverage. An end-expired CO2 level of 2.5% or more was observed in two swine. The highest end-expired CO2 level measured was 5.3%. We conclude that although capnography is convenient and effective, it lacks all the attributes of an ideal monitor for detecting esophageal intubation.\r"

The tracheal tubes were straightened and centered within cardboard cylinders and the laser set to 40 W was aimed to reflect from the tracheal tubes onto the cardboard. The times to combustion perforating the cardboard cylinders because of laser reflection were 1.41 +/- 0.54 (mean +/- SD), 1.73 +/- 0.93, 3.70 +/- 2.18, and 9.26 +/- 3.40 s for tracheal tubes 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The differences between the times to combustion with tracheal tubes 3 and 1, 3 and 2, 4 and 1, 4 and 2, and finally, 4 and 3 were statistically significant. We conclude that the Laser-Guard-wrapped polyvinylchloride tracheal tube and the Mallinckrodt Laser-Flex tracheal tube were less reflective of incident CO2 laser radiation than the copper or aluminum-foil-wrapped red rubber tracheal tubes.\r"

All treatment regimens were instituted twice daily for 14 days. All eyes reepithelialized normally within 3 to 5 days. During 10 weeks of follow-up, all eyes developed moderate reticular subepithelial haze without significant differences among treatment groups. Results of light, fluorescence, and electron microscopic examination showed anterior stromal scarring and markedly reduced new subepithelial collagen formation in the group treated with mitomycin C, corticosteroids, and erythromycin. Focal abnormalities of Descemet's membrane and endothelial abnormalities were present in all treatment groups. Combination therapy with topical steroids, mitomycin C, and erythromycin to control the corneal wound healing response after refractive laser surgery appears promising and warrants further study.\r"

Transcutaneous oxygen (Po2) and carbon dioxide tensions (Pco2) and oxygen saturation were measured and the electro-cardiogram was recorded. During sleep mean oxygen saturation fell to 92.7% (minimum 86.1%) from 95.1% when awake. During the night oxygen saturation was below 95% for 62% of the time, below 90% for 6% of the time, and below 85% for 1% of the time. In four patients there were oxygen desaturation dips (a fall of greater than 4% in oxygen saturation from a stable baseline that lasted greater than 30 s) with concurrent increases in Pco2. Two patients had bradycardia during the dips: in one there was non-sustained ventricular tachycardia during the dips and in the other there was ST depression (greater than 0.1 mV at 80 ms after the J point) during a dip. In the controls the fall in mean oxygen saturation from 95.4% when they were awake to 94.4% when they were asleep was less than the fall in patients with heart failure and there were no desaturation dips or arrhythmias. Thus patients with severe heart failure had episodes of oxygen desaturation during sleep, some of which were associated with arrhythmia. Such episodes may be related to the increased risk of sudden death in chronic heart failure.\r"

Forced hyperventilation produced hypocapnia and metabolic alkalosis but no chest pain or electrocardiographic change. Patients with syndrome X showed reduced maximum oxygen consumption with an increased respiratory exchange ratio at peak exercise, confirming that exercise was limited by skeletal muscle perfusion--and thus that the increase in cardiac output with exercise is limited in syndrome X as in heart failure. Arterial carbon dioxide tension (PCO2) homoeostasis during exercise was normal but the ventilatory cost of carbon dioxide excretion was increased in syndrome X (as in heart failure). End tidal PCO2 measurements correlated only poorly with arterial PCO2 in individual patients with syndrome X, providing a possible explanation for previous reports, based on end tidal PCO2 of inappropriate hyperventilation. Patients with syndrome X did not show inappropriate hyperventilation but they did show hyperventilation that was appropriate to maintain normal arterial PCO2 in the face of reduced cardiac reserve.\r"

The conjugates (rscu-PA/MA-TSPI-1, rscu-PA/MA-PMI-2, rscu-PA/MA-PMI-1, and rscu-PA/MA-LIBS-1), purified by immunoadsorption and gel filtration, were obtained with recoveries of 34% to 45%, with an average stoichiometry of 1.6 to 1.8 IgG molecules per rscu-PA molecule, and with unaltered specific activities and affinities. Preincubation of human platelet-rich plasma with rscu-PA/MA-PMI-2, rscu-PA/MA-PMI-1, or unconjugated rscu-PA resulted in partial inhibition of ADP-induced aggregation; 25% inhibition was obtained with 63 micrograms/mL rscu-PA and with 6 micrograms u-PA/mL rscu-PA/MA-PMI-2 or 1.2 micrograms u-PA/mL rscu-PA/MA-PMI-1. In an in vitro system composed of a 125I-fibrin-labeled platelet-rich human plasma clot immersed in normal human plasma, the conjugates had threefold to greater than 15-fold less fibrinolytic potency than unconjugated rscu-PA. The thrombolytic potency of rscu-PA/MA-PMI-1 and rscu-PA/MA-LIBS-1 was compared with that of rscu-PA and that of a control conjugate rscu-PA/MA-1C8 in a pulmonary embolism model in the hamster, using clots prepared from platelet-poor or platelet-rich human plasma. Lysis was measured 30 minutes after the end of a 60-minute intravenous infusion of the thrombolytic agents. rscu-PA, rscu-PA/MA-PMI-1, rscu-PA/MA-LIBS-1, as well as rscu-PA/MA-1C8 had comparable thrombolytic potencies (percent lysis per dose administered) towards platelet-poor human plasma clots. In contrast, the thrombolytic potency of rscu-PA/MA-PMI-1 and of rscu-PA/MA-LIBS-1 towards platelet-rich clots was 2.3- to 3-fold higher than that of rscu-PA (P less than .005) and fivefold to sevenfold higher than that of the control conjugate (P less than .01).\r"

  ".W": "In an effort to identify human proteins that bind to the TATAA box, a lambda gt-11 expression library was screened with a radiolabeled DNA probe containing 12 copies of the TATAA sequence. A cDNA encoding a specific TATAA binding protein was isolated and found to contain a homeobox domain identical at 59 of 60 residues to the Drosophila Antennapedia (Antp) homeodomain, as well as another conserved motif found in homeotic genes, the homeo-specific pentapeptide. Although this and other Antp-like homeobox proteins have been described previously in neuronal cells and fibroblasts, we report the expression of this gene in lymphoid cells. This cDNA, isolated from a B-cell library, hybridizes to a 1.6-kb messenger RNA in several T- and B-cell lines, and the expected protein was identified in Jurkat T-lymphoid cells by Western blot analysis. The DNA binding specificity of this human Antp clone was analyzed using single-base mutations of the TATAA sequence. The first thymidine, as well as the last three bases (TAA), were important for homeobox binding. Finally, the function of the highly conserved homeospecific pentapeptide protein region was investigated in both the human and Drosophila Antp proteins. The homeospecific pentapeptide region was not required for DNA binding, and Drosophila Antp proteins mutated in the pentapeptide region were able to transactivate the Ubx promoter in Schneider L2 cells, in contrast to a homeodomain mutation, suggesting an alternative function for the homeospecific pentapeptide in homeotic genes. Because the human Antp TATAA binding protein is expressed in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells, we suggest that this homeobox gene has evolved a more general transcriptional regulatory function in higher eukaryotic cells.\r"

  ".W": "Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) has been reported to antagonize the stimulatory effect of various conditioned media on the growth of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells and clonogenic blasts from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). In the present study, using purified recombinant cytokines and homogenous cell populations, we provide evidence for a synergistic or additive effect of IFN-gamma with recombinant human (rhu) hematopoietic growth factors in the stimulation of clonogenic blasts from most AML patients examined. Under conditions of limiting cell concentration, rhuIFN-gamma alone showed little effect on blast proliferation, whereas in conjunction with recombinant human interleukin-3 (rhuIL-3), IFN-gamma significantly enhanced colony formation in 13 of 15 AML cases. Maximal stimulation was obtained at low concentrations of IFN-gamma (2 to 20 pmol/L) in four cases and at higher concentrations (700 to 7,000 pmol/L) in the remainder. IFN-gamma also synergized with recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhuGM-CSF) in 9 of 13 cases. Within 1 hour of exposure, IFN-gamma induced a twofold to fourfold accumulation of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha)-specific transcripts in AML blasts and several AML cell lines that include HL-60 and OCI-AML 1. Further, the synergy between IFN-gamma and IL-3 on AML blasts was partially or completely abrogated by a TNF alpha neutralizing antibody, suggesting that growth enhancement by IFN-gamma may be mediated through TNF alpha production in AML blast culture. Exposure of normal precursors (burst-forming unit-erythroid [BFU-E] and colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage [CFU-GM]) to IFN-gamma also resulted in significant growth enhancement, suggesting that the proliferative response elicited by IFN-gamma was not limited to AML blasts. Finally, in M07-E, an IL-3-dependent human \"megakaryoblastic\" cell line, IFN-gamma also significantly enhanced IL-3-supported colony formation, much in the same way as in primary AML blasts. In contrast, IFN-gamma inhibited growth of all CSF-independent leukemic cell lines tested. This inhibition was partially alleviated by anti-TNF alpha antibody. In summary, our data indicate that IFN-gamma can enhance or antagonize cell proliferation, depending on the cell type. Further, TNF alpha appears to mediate the biologic effect of IFN-gamma either in growth stimulation or growth inhibition.\r"

We used a large panel of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to characterize in detail the phenotypic changes during isolation and stimulation of human neutrophils. Centrifugation on density gradients appears to be the crucial step that causes an increase in expression of antigens not detectable on neutrophils in whole blood samples (cytochrome b558 recognized by MoAb 7D5; and CD10) or expressed at significantly lower levels (CD11a, CD11b, CD11c, CD13, CD16, CD45, and CD67). Other antigens were unaffected by the density gradient centrifugation step (CD32, CD54, CD58, Leu-8, HLA class I). Upregulation of antigens was also determined by stimulation of purified neutrophils. Upregulation of CD63 was an excellent marker for release from azurophil granules. We subsequently related the surface antigen expression to functional activities of purified neutrophils. From these experiments, we concluded that 7D5-as \"early activation\" marker--does not necessarily discriminate between primed or resting neutrophils with respect to NADPH oxidase activity.\r"

  ".W": "Band 3 variants occur rather frequently in different populations. Based on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide electrophoretic properties, a widespread polymorphism (band 3 Memphis) has been previously described. It corresponds to a protein that has been hypothesized to be elongated in its N-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Band 3 from a heterozygote subject for this polymorphism and that displays a normal reactivity towards stilbene disulfonates has been isolated and its primary structure determined by protein chemistry. Reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography tryptic peptide mapping showed, as the only difference with controls, that the enzymatic cleavage between the two N-terminal peptides did not occur, yielding a 69 residue-long fragment. Further cleavages of this peptide (cyanogen bromide, V8 protease), amino acid composition, and sequence analyses demonstrated that the lysine at position 56 was replaced by a glutamic acid. Thus, surprisingly, a single amino acid change is responsible for the large difference in the electrophoretic behavior. This result suggests that single amino acid substitutions may similarly be involved in the structural modification of several other protein variants, described as elongated or shortened based only on SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis studies. When deletions/insertions were confirmed by sequence analysis, their extent was often different from that expected from electrophoresis.\r"

  ".W": "Atrial natriuretic peptide is cleared from plasma by clearance receptors and by enzymatic degradation by way of a neutral metalloendopeptidase. Inhibition of neutral metalloendopeptidase activity appears to provide an interesting approach to interfere with metabolism of atrial natriuretic peptide to enhance the renal and haemodynamic effects of endogenous atrial natriuretic peptide. In this study, the effects of SCH 34826, a new orally active neutral metalloendopeptidase inhibitor, have been evaluated in a single-blind, placebo-controlled study involving eight healthy volunteers who had maintained a high sodium intake for 5 days. SCH 34826 had no effect on blood pressure or heart rate in these normotensive subjects. SCH 34826 promoted significant increases in excretion of urinary sodium, phosphate, and calcium. The cumulative 5-hour urinary sodium excretion was 15.7 +/- 7.3 mmol for the placebo and 22.9 +/- 5, 26.7 +/- 6 (p less than 0.05), and 30.9 +/- 6.8 mmol (p less than 0.01) for the 400, 800, and 1600 mg SCH 34826 doses, respectively. During the same time interval, the cumulative urinary phosphate excretion increased by 0.3 +/- 0.4 mmol after placebo and by 1.5 +/- 0.3 (p less than 0.01), 1.95 +/- 0.3 (p less than 0.01), and 2.4 +/- 0.4 mmol (p less than 0.001) after 400, 800, and 1600 mg SCH 34826, respectively. There was no change in diuresis or excretion of urinary potassium and uric acid. The natriuretic response to SCH 34826 occurred in the absence of any change in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels but was associated with a dose-dependent elevation of urinary atrial natriuretic peptide and cyclic guanosine monophosphate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of the 221 male subjects with hyperlipidemia studied, 121 responded well to the treatment with more than a 25% reduction in the non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, whereas 100 were nonresponders. Among responders, but not nonresponders, homozygosity for the apolipoprotein B X2 allele (XbaI site present) and heterozygosity for the apolipoprotein AI/CIII S2 allele (SstI site present) were associated with elevated baseline serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels, respectively. However, the hypolipidemic effect of gemfibrozil among the responders was independent of these gene polymorphisms. These data indicate that common polymorphisms of the apolipoprotein B and apolipoprotein AI/CIII gene loci influence serum lipid levels by mechanisms that are amenable to an intervention with gemfibrozil.\r"

The 185 patients in the control group, medically treated only, were closely matched for year of treatment, age at treatment, sex, seizure type, and neurologic deficit before treatment. Between 75 and 95% of the survivors (median 17 years after treatment) completed two questionnaires on their social situation. Although surgical treatment improved the seizure situation (about one-fourth had some neurologic deficit), a considerably smaller long-range influence on different social aspects was observed. There were no significant differences between the two groups in educational status, social pensions, social status, marital status, fertility, dependency in residential situation, the need for aid in daily activities of living (ADL), or the need for being looked after, when we controlled for pretreatment status. In all, 25.3% of the surgically treated patients and 8.5% of the controls were not receiving anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) at the time of investigation (Mann-Whitney U test, two-tailed p = 0.0011). A considerably higher proportion of the surgically treated (53.2%) than control patients (24.2%) claimed that the treatment had improved their \"working ability\" (Mann-Whitney U test, two-tailed p less than 0.0001), but this resulted in significant improvements in the actual working situation only for those in regular education or work before treatment (chi 2 = 6.514, p = 0.038).\r"

A statistically significant difference in seizure frequency from the baseline to the treatment phase was noted between patients receiving placebo and GBP 1,200 mg, in whom seizure frequency decreased 57%. The GBP dosage of 900 mg appeared to be ineffective. A close relationship was observed between the serum GBP concentrations and the GBP dosage based on the seizure frequency. Serum GBP concentrations greater than 2 micrograms/ml resulted in a lower frequency of seizures. The adverse effects were minor and consisted mainly of transient drowsiness. GBP appears to be effective in the treatment of partial epileptic seizures in a dosage-related manner.\r"

Status epilepticus was induced in 0.5% halothane-anesthetized Wistar rats with a threshold (90 mg/kg) or suprathreshold (200 mg/kg) dose of intravenous (i.v.) pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) under stereotactic hippocampal depth electrode monitoring. Fifteen minutes after seizure induction, the maximum hemodynamically tolerated dose of MgSO4 (10 mg/kg/min in 22 min) was administered i.v. MgSO4 was ineffective in altering seizure discharge. A subgroup of nine animals received hypertonic mannitol before MgSO4 to open the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to facilitate Mg2+ CNS penetration. Again MgSO4 was ineffective in attenuating epileptic activity. These results support the contention that MgSO4 is not an effective treatment for status epilepticus. We hypothesize that because Mg2+ blocks Ca2+ influx into the neuron through the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-operated calcium channel in a voltage-dependent manner it would be ineffective in neurons that are continuously depolarizing as in status epilepticus.\r"

  ".U": "91332328\r", 
  ".W": "Of 3,286 consecutive patients treated for acute myocardial infarction, electrophysiologic testing was performed in 1,209 survivors (37%) free of significant complications at the time of hospital discharge to determine their risk of spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias during follow-up. Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia was inducible by programmed electrical stimulation in 75 (6.2%). Antiarrhythmic therapy was not routinely prescribed regardless of the test results. During the 1st year of follow-up, 14 infarct survivors (19%) with inducible ventricular tachycardia experienced spontaneous ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation in the absence of new ischemia compared with 34 (2.9%) of those without inducible ventricular tachycardia (p less than 0.0005). During the extended follow-up period (median 28 months) of those with inducible ventricular tachycardia, 19 (25%) had a spontaneous electrical event; 37% of these first events were fatal. These results suggest that the most cost-effective strategy for predicting arrhythmia will be obtained by restricting electrophysiologic testing to infarct survivors whose left ventricular ejection fraction is less than 40% and using a stimulation protocol containing four extrastimuli. Electrophysiologic testing is the single best predictor of spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias during follow-up in infarct survivors. The majority (94%) with a negative test benefit from the more reliable reassurance that all is well, whereas the 25% risk of electrical events in those with inducible ventricular tachycardia justifies a prospective trial of effective prophylactic antiarrhythmic interventions.\r"

Conventional lipids have been implicated as the cause of a variety of iatrogenic side effects in critically ill hospitalized patients, and long-chain triglycerides of the omega-6 family have been shown to be potentially detrimental to immune function. Alternative lipids (fish oils, medium-chain triglycerides, and structured triglycerides) have been proposed as substitutes for conventional long-chain, polyunsaturated omega-6 fatty acids. Unlike long-chain triglycerides, medium-chain triglycerides are more rapidly cleared from the blood and are completely oxidized for energy. However, medium-chain triglycerides contain no essential fatty acids. On the other hand, structured triglycerides offer the advantages of long-chain triglycerides (essential fatty acids) and of medium-chain triglycerides (rapid clearance and oxidation). Fish oils, which contain long-chain polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, appear to be anti-inflammatory and to affect immune function differently from the omega-6 long-chain triglycerides.\r"

Although cytolytic effector function of PKC-depleted CTL triggered via alpha/beta-TCR structures was completely inhibited, target cell lysis induced via CD3-epsilon remained unaffected. Furthermore this PKC-independent cytolysis pathway was not associated with the release of serine esterases. Analyses at the clonal level revealed that PKC depletion blocked the cytolytic response of up to 95% of alpha/beta-TCR triggered CTL clones. The data suggest the existence of a distinct signaling pathway triggered via CD3-epsilon that is not associated with exocytosis of serine esterases and probably independent of PKC.\r"

In euthymic mice, significant numbers of cells with this phenotype are found only in the intestinal epithelium. Intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes have been shown to be cytolytically active in vivo, as measured by the redirected lysis assay. In this communication, freshly harvested T cell subsets obtained from pooled nude mouse spleen and lymph nodes and separated by flow cytometric cell sorting were assayed for their ability to lyse FcR+ P815 targets in the presence of mAb to the epsilon-chain of the CD3 complex. CD8+, but not CD4+ or CD4- CD8-, T cells in nude mice were cytolytically active. CD8+ alpha/beta- and gamma/delta-TCR-bearing T cells from the spleen and lymph nodes of nude mice demonstrated similar cytolytic activity. No cytolytic activity of purified cell subsets was apparent in the absence of anti-CD3 mAb, even when NK-susceptible target cells were used. These data indicate that, in contrast to euthymic mice, a large proportion of CD8+ cells from the spleen and lymph nodes of nude mice are cytolytically active in vivo. In addition, these results suggest that the intestinal epithelium is not the only anatomical location where constitutively cytolytic CD8+ alpha/beta- or gamma/delta TCR-bearing T cells may be found.\r"

The present studies investigated the effects of TGF-beta 1 on murine T cell proliferation triggered through the T cell receptor/CD3 complex. In contrast to previously reported T cell growth inhibition, TGF-beta 1 costimulated splenic T cell proliferation in the presence of immobilized anti-CD3 antibody 2C11, with maximal effect at anti-CD3 concentration of 50 micrograms/ml. Although TGF-beta 1 induced a modest increase in IL-2R display, TGF-beta 1 co-stimulated proliferation was largely independent of IL-2 and/or IL-4. Anti-IL-2 and/or anti-IL-4 antibody did not significantly block the TGF-beta 1 co-stimulated T cell growth, and no IL-2 or IL-4 bioactivity was detected in TGF-beta 1 co-stimulated cultures. TGF-beta 1 did not enhance IL-2 mRNA expression beyond control levels. However, TGF-beta 1 co-stimulation caused an accelerated evolution of a memory or mature T cell population phenotype. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets were significantly enriched for cells of the mature CD45RBloPgp-1hi phenotype, in comparison with T cells stimulated by anti-CD3 alone or with PMA, and CD8+ T cells predominated. These results thus provide initial evidence that TGF-beta 1 is capable of bifunctional T cell growth regulation, which occurs largely via an IL-2- and IL-4-independent pathway.\r"

We investigated the molecular basis of the signals leading to actin polymerization and concentrated on the involvement of guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding regulatory proteins, and protein kinase C (PKC). In addition, we related these early events to later events in B-cell activation, including cell proliferation. Cross-linking the Ag receptor with Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (SAC) or anti-IgM antibodies, or stimulation of PKC with phorbol ester induced a time- and concentration-dependent increase in the filamentous actin content of B cells. Inhibition or depletion of PKC resulted in decreased actin assembly induced by anti-IgM, SAC, and PMA, suggesting that the signal for polymerization is generated distally to PKC activation. Pertussis toxin pretreatment inhibited the responses to anti-IgM and SAC but not PMA, and direct stimulation of permeabilized cells with GTP gamma S induced microfilament assembly, indicating the involvement of a GTP-binding protein for receptor-mediated events. Disruption of actin polymerization with botulinum C2 toxin or cytochalasin D inhibited the assembly of actin and [3H]TdR incorporation induced by all stimuli. We conclude that human B cell activation by receptor-mediated stimuli results in actin polymerization by signaling pathways coupled to GTP-binding proteins. These changes in the cytoskeleton may be involved in the transduction of messages leading to responses such as proliferation in B lymphocytes.\r"

DN thymocytes were separated into three subpopulations depending on their cell-surface expression of Pgp-1 and IL-2R, namely, Pgp-1+IL-2R-, Pgp-1-IL-2R+, and Pgp-1-IL-2R-. The present study investigated the requirements of the MRL104.8a monolayer for inducing the differentiation of these DN thymocyte subpopulations. The following were revealed: i) the MRL104.8a monolayer failed to induce the differentiation of a Pgp-1+IL-2R- subpopulation; ii) whereas a Pgp-1-IL-2R+ subpopulation did not express either CD4 or CD8 Ag when cultured in medium, culturing this subpopulation on the thymic stromal cell monolayers resulted in the expression of CD8 but not CD4 Ag; and iii) a Pgp-1-IL-2R- DN subpopulation obtained through less extensive treatments with anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 antibodies in the presence of C before sorting procedures spontaneously differentiated into double positive cells in medium. In contrast, most of DN cells with the same phenotype obtained through extensive anti-CD4 and -CD8 treatments before sorting failed to express CD4 and/or CD8 Ag in medium but could differentiate through a CD3-4-8+ into more mature stages only when they were cultured on the thymic stromal monolayer. These results indicate differential requirements of thymic stromal cells for the differentiation of various DN subpopulations with qualitatively distinct phenotypes and different magnitudes (very low vs almost zero levels) of CD4/CD8 expression.\r"

  ".U": "91332424\r", 
  ".W": "Ly-6A/E is a phosphatidylinositol (PI)-linked membrane protein whose expression is induced or upregulated on normal murine T and B cells by IFN-gamma. Cross-linkage of Ly-6A/E expressed on normal murine T cells stimulates Ca2+ translocation, and in the presence of a protein kinase C (PKC) activator, lymphokine secretion, and cellular proliferation. Utilizing an anti-Ly-6A/E mAb, we studied the effect of cross-linking Ly-6A/E on IFN-gamma-treated resting B cells, for Ca2+ translocation, PI turnover, and cellular proliferation. Since these events are known to be stimulated by cross-linkage of B cell membrane (m)Ig, we compared the changes mediated through these respective membrane proteins. We show that cross-linkage of B cell Ly-6A/E stimulates a large, rapid, and sustained increase in the concentration of intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i) comparable in magnitude, though somewhat delayed, relative to that observed after cross-linking of mIg. Cross-linkage of B cell Ly-6A/E does not, however, stimulate detectable PI turnover, in contrast to PI turnover induced by ligation of mIg. Both the Ly-6A/E- and mIg-mediated increase in [Ca2+]i occur through mobilization of internal Ca2+ stores as well as entry of Ca2+ into the cell from the extracellular compartment. Ly-6A/E-mediated Ca2+ translocation appears to be under the regulation of PKC in that short term pretreatment of B cells with the PKC activator, PMA, inhibits the Ly-6A/E- as well as the mIg-mediated increase in [Ca2+]i, whereas prolonged exposure to PMA, under conditions that lead to depletion of PKC, results in an augmentation in Ca2+ translocation after ligation of either Ly-6A/E or mIg. Co-capping studies indicate that Ly-6A/E and mIg cap independently in the B cell membrane, thus suggesting that the Ly-6A/E-induced effects on Ca2+ translocation are not mediated through simultaneous modulation of mIg. Anti-Ly6A/E, by itself, does not stimulate an increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation by IFN-gamma-treated resting B cells, but induces a striking increase in the presence of PMA. By contrast, anti-Ig by itself stimulates significant increases in [3H]thymidine incorporation that is inhibited by PMA. Thus, Ly-6A/E is a potent mediator of B cell activation that may use a signal transduction system in quiescent B cells that is distinct from that of the Ag receptor.\r"

CD4+ TCR gamma delta+ T cell clones were established to study the phenotypical and functional characteristics of these cells. Thirty-four CD4+ TCR-gamma delta+ T cell clones were established after sorting CD4+ T cells from a pre-expanded TCR-gamma delta+ T cell population. These clones as well as the CD4- TCR-gamma delta+ T cells from the same donor used V gamma 2 and V delta 2. In a second cloning experiment CD4+ TCR-gamma delta+ T cells were cloned directly from freshly isolated TCR-gamma delta+ T cells using a cloning device coupled to a FACS sorter. Forty-three clones were obtained, which all expressed CD4 and TCR-gamma delta. Eleven of these clones used V delta 1 and three of them coexpressed V gamma 2. The other CD4+ TCR-gamma delta+ T cell clones used both V delta 2 and V gamma 2. CD4+ TCR-gamma delta+ T cell clones expressed CD28 irrespective of the V gamma or V delta usage, and were CD11b negative. Three CD4-CD8+ TCR-gamma delta+ clones expressed CD8 alpha but not CD8 beta and were CD11b positive. CD28 expression among CD4-CD8+ and CD4-CD8- was variable but lower than on CD4+ T cell clones. CD4- TCR-gamma delta+ T cell clones using V gamma 2 and V delta 2 specifically lyse the Burkitt lymphoma cell line Daudi and secrete low levels of IFN-gamma and granulocyte-macrophage-CSF upon stimulation with Daudi. In contrast, most CD4+ T cell clones that use V gamma 2 and V delta 2 had a very low lytic activity against Daudi cells and secrete high levels of IFN-gamma and granulocyte-macrophage-CSF after stimulation with Daudi cells. The NK-sensitive cell line K562 was killed efficiently by the CD4- TCR-gamma delta+ T cell clones, but not by CD4+ TCR-gamma delta+ T cell clones, and could not induce cytokine secretion in CD4+ or CD4- T cell clones. CD4+ TCR-gamma delta+ T cell clones, but not the CD4- clones, could provide bystander cognate T cell help for production of IgG, IgM, and IgA in the presence of IL-2 and IgE in the presence of IL-4. Thus, CD4+ TCR-gamma delta+ T cells are similar to CD4+ TCR-alpha beta+ T cells in their abilities to secrete high levels of cytokines and to provide T cell help in antibody production.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91332426\r", 
  ".W": "The role of T cell-mediated and humoral immunity to type II collagen has been well documented in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Previous work from our laboratory has indicated that genomic deletions of TCR V beta genes may play a role in CIA resistance in mice. This indicated a selectivity of TCR usage by autoreactive T cells in CIA in mice. Certain strains of mice, although having a normal genomic V beta TCR repertoire, can show clonal deletion of peripheral T cells that bear specific V beta gene products in their TCR. These clonally deleted T cells are reactive with self-Ag such as minor lymphocyte stimulation (Mls) Ag. An Mls-congenic strain, BALB.D2.Mlsa, which differs only at the Mls-1 a locus from BALB/c (Mls-1b), was used to examine the effect of clonal deletion of Mls-1a-reactive T cells in CIA. These two strains were crossed to three CIA-susceptible strains, B10.RIII (H-2r, Mls-1b), DBA/1 (H-2q, Mls-1a), and B10.Q (H-2q, Mls-1b), and the crosses were injected with type II collagen. A significantly decreased incidence of arthritis was observed in the (BALB.D2.Mlsa x B10.Q)F1 hybrids, compared with (BALB/c x B10.Q)F1 hybrids, upon immunization with chick type II collagen. The BALB.D2.Mlsa cross mice also had significantly lower levels of antimouse collagen antibodies. Flow cytometric analysis confirmed the clonal deletion of Mls-1a-reactive V beta 8.1, V beta 6, V beta 7, and V beta 9 subsets in the (BALB.D2.Mlsa x B10.Q)F1 hybrids. The study of H-2q/d mice in (BALB.D2.Mlsa x B10.Q) x B10.Q back-crosses demonstrated a significant correlation between CIA resistance and Mls-1a locus. On the other hand, B10.RIII crosses showed only a modest decrease in CIA incidence in the presence of Mls-1a. As expected, all the DBA/1 crosses had an equal incidence of CIA, which was somewhat less than that seen in DBA/1 mice themselves. These studies point out that the Mls-1a locus could play a role in decreasing CIA incidence by clonal deletion of T cells bearing specific V beta TCR, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of CIA. The influence of the clonal deletion of T cells on CIA, and hence the usage of specific V beta TCR by autoreactive anti-type II collagen T cells, however, depends not only on the source of the type II collagen and the MHC class II molecules involved but also on other background genes in mice.\r"

  ".W": "Recently there has been a number of reports suggesting that CD4-CD8- T cells participate in the processes of inflammatory reaction. In an attempt to delineate the distinctive functions of double negative (DN) T lymphocytes in an autoimmune-induced disease, we isolated and cloned such T cells, along with control CD4+ cells, from Lewis rats immunized with guinea-pig myelin basic protein in CFA. Both clones proliferated in response to the guinea-pig myelin basic protein and its synthetic encephalitogenic peptide, and expressed the same TCR V genes homologous to the mouse V alpha 2 and V beta 8.2 families that appear to be the defining entity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyeltis (EAE). Moreover, the TCR D and J region gene products of the DN cell were found to be similar to another encephalitogenic rat T cell clone. The two T clones did not differ markedly in their ability to produce TNF and IL-2 and to adhere to vascular wall-derived extracellular matrix- and laminin-coated plates. Surprising, therefore, was the finding that, although the CD4+ T lymphocytes were capable of inducing EAE, the DN cells did not elicit disease but rather inhibited subsequent EAE induction. Thus, TCR V alpha 2V beta 8.2 and its junctional region gene products are not the only prerequisite segment for a T cell to become encephalitogenic. We suggest that the important determinants of the T cell ability to induce disease are features of the T cell, other than or in addition to, the T cell receptor.\r"

We previously demonstrated that the liver is a major site for the proliferation of such DN alpha beta-T cells. Herein, we further demonstrate that a large proportion of alpha beta-T cells in the liver and other organs, except the thymus, of lpr mice have unique properties, such as DN phenotype, relatively dull TCR intensity, a preponderance of V beta 8+ cells, and Pgp-1 expression. Interestingly, alpha beta-T cells in the liver of normal mice were found to consist of T cells with intermediate intensity of TCR (i.e., brighter than thymic dull TCR and lower than thymic bright TCR) as well as with bright intensity of TCR in the immunofluorescence test. These hepatic alpha beta-T cells with intermediate TCR in normal mice were found to have properties similar to those of alpha beta-T cells in lpr mice. These results suggest that abnormal alpha beta-T cells in lpr mice are a counterpart of normal T cells in the liver. An abnormal expansion of such T cells in the liver might be fundamental to the pathogenesis involved in these autoimmune mice.\r"

Experiments reported here traced the molecular basis for this functional defect to an overproduction of IFN-gamma by A- CD4+ T cells compared with cells from A-sufficient (A+) mice. Secretion of IL-2 and IL-4 by cells from A- and A+ mice was equivalent. Retinoic acid supplementation in vitro decreased IFN-gamma secretion from A- T cells, indicating that IFN-gamma production is retinoid-responsive. Adding IFN-gamma neutralizing antibodies to cultures established with cells from immune A- mice substantially increased IgG1 production, whereas IL-4 addition moderately increased IgG1 production. Adding retinoic acid to the cultures either at initiation, or 48 h later, fully restored IgG1 production by A- cultures to the level of A+ control cultures. These results are consistent with a role for vitamin A in negatively regulating IFN-gamma secretion.\r"

The lower level of tumor cytotoxicity by lipid A-activated AKR macrophages correlated with lower levels of cytotoxic nitric oxide generation as measured by nitrite end product accumulation. The refractory state of AKR macrophages was unexpectedly found to be independent of their C5 deficiency in that IFN-gamma reconstituted their response to activation by lipid A coincident with an increase in C1q mRNA synthesis. AKR macrophages were augmented in their lipid A activation by exogenous soluble C1q in the absence of IFN-gamma, which corresponded with an increased production of nitric oxide by C1q-reconstituted macrophages. In contrast, responsive C3H mouse macrophages with sufficient levels of C1q synthesis were inhibited by exogenous soluble monomeric C1q in their lipid A activation. Both AKR and C3H macrophages plated over immobilized C1q were inhibited in their lipid A activation for tumor cytotoxicity and nitric oxide generation. Our results provide evidence that C1q modulates macrophage activation by lipid A for nitric oxide-mediated tumor cytotoxicity under the influence of IFN-gamma, which stimulates C1q synthesis and secretion. These findings strongly suggest that macrophage synthesis of C1q, but not C5, is a prerequisite for their activation by lipid A.\r"

The recognition and killing of cells infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) depends on the recognition of LCMV peptides bound to class I MHC. Mutations in class I MHC molecules have enabled the delineation of regions in the class I molecule important for binding peptides and for interaction with the TCR. We have constructed a library of class I mutants using saturation mutagenesis and report a phenotypic change resulting from a single amino acid substitution that results in the heteroclitic (increased) killing of LCMV-infected cells. This amino acid change, asparagine to serine at position 30, is in a conserved region of the class I molecule contacting the alpha 3 domain. This mutation does not result in increased expression of the class I molecule on the cell surface, does not affect the binding of CD8, and does not affect allogeneic recognition. Cold target experiments show that this heteroclitic killing is due to increased recognition by CTL. These data point toward a critical function for this region of the class I molecule in the binding of peptides or their presentation to CTL.\r"

These responses require APC that express MHC class II proteins, but they are not MHC restricted and they do not depend on a processing step, presumably because these mitogens bind directly to MHC class II molecules. These mitogens stimulate T cells by interacting in an unknown way with the portion of the TCR encoded by certain V beta gene segments. In this paper, we explore the importance of MHC class II polymorphism in T cell responses to staphylococcal enterotoxins. We find that certain MHC molecules present SEB to V beta 8-bearing T cells far better than others. These data suggest that one route of host defence against bacterial toxic mitogens may be to alter MHC class II molecules so that stimulation is inhibited.\r"

Sequence analysis demonstrated that 93% of VH81X containing H chain V region genes in splenic B cells were rearranged nonproductively. Furthermore, 74% of rearrangements of VH81X among sIg- bone marrow cells were nonproductive. This contrasts with previous results obtained for rearrangements of members of the VH36-60 gene segment family among sIg- cells wherein, as a consequence of extensive clonal expansion after productive H chain V gene rearrangement, 80% of rearrangements were productive. The low proportion of productive rearrangements of VH81X is interpreted as indicating that most productive rearrangements of VH81X cannot facilitate clonal expansion, which would support the hypothesis that selection for clonal expansion and maturation is dependent on the amino acid sequence of nascent H chains. Additionally, because most productive rearrangements of VH81X cannot facilitate clonal maturation but do appear to mediate allelic exclusion, these processes are likely to be regulated independently.\r"

  ".W": "CD24 is a signal-transducing molecule on the surfaces of most human B cells that can modulate their response to activation signals by antagonizing IL-induced differentiation into antibody-forming cells and inducing proliferation in combination with signals generated by Ag receptors. A cDNA that directs the expression of CD24 on the surfaces of transfected COS cells was cloned by its homology to a cDNA encoding the murine M1/69-J11d heat stable Ag. The CD24 cDNA encodes a mature peptide of only 31 to 35 amino acids that is extensively glycosylated and is attached to the outer surface of the plasma membrane by a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol lipid anchor. Although CD24 is structurally similar to M1/69-J11d, and the two Ag appear to have a common genetic ancestry, the homology of CD24 to the M1/69-J11d Ag is confined to a small cluster of amino acids comprising potential N-linked glycosylation sites. Combined with the differences in expression patterns of the human and murine Ag, this indicates that CD24 and M1/69-J11d may not have equivalent functional roles in lymphoid development. The novel structure of CD24 suggests that signaling could be triggered by the binding of a lectin-like ligand to the carbohydrates projecting from the CD24 peptide, and transduced through the release of second messengers derived from the glycosyl phosphatidylinositol membrane anchor of CD24.\r"

  ".W": "Many tumors have been shown to express minimal levels of class I MHC Ag, which makes them more resistant to recognition and lysis by cytolytic T lymphocytes. Line 1, a BALB/c spontaneous lung carcinoma, normally expresses very low levels of class I Ag, but expression can be increased 50-fold by treatment with agents such as DMSO or IFN-gamma. Because class I Ag serve as restricting elements for cytolytic T cell recognition of tumor Ag, we wished to determine if cytotoxic T lymphocytes could play a role in the immune response to this type of class I low, but inducible, tumor. After immunization in vivo and restimulation of splenic cells in vitro we were able to generate T cell clones that lysed line 1 cells induced to express high levels of class I, but did not lyse uninduced, low class I expressing line 1 cells in short term (6-h) 51Cr release assays. Paradoxically, incubation of the T cells with uninduced class I low line 1 cells for a few days resulted in complete destruction of the tumor cells. We demonstrate that the T cells, stimulated by the tumor cells, produce IFN-gamma, which in turn induces class I expression on the line 1 cells making them susceptible to lysis by the T cell clone. This suggests that a positive feedback reaction can occur in generating a response to this and perhaps other inducible tumor cell lines.\r"

Addition to the culture medium of those mAb that neutralize the antiviral activity of IFN-gamma or interact with its receptor inhibited proliferative and cytotoxic responses elicited in PBL by HLA alloantigens, anti-CD3 mAb, and IL-2, but not the proliferative response to PHA. The IFN-gamma blockade also inhibited IFN-gamma, IL-2, and TNF-alpha release during MLC. Kinetic experiments showed that reduction of proliferative and cytotoxic responses to HLA alloantigens is maximal when IFN-gamma is blocked within the first 48 h. Exogenous rIFN-gamma restored the proliferative response only when added at the beginning. Moreover, when IFN-gamma was blocked, T lymphocytes recovered from 6-day MLC displayed a profound decrease in their expression of p55 and p75 chains of the IL-2R, as well as in the number of high-affinity IL-2 binding sites. These findings strongly suggest that IFN-gamma is required in the early phases of induction of the oligo- and polyclonal proliferative and cytotoxic responses of lymphocytes.\r"

We, therefore, hypothesized that MCA-induced tumors may evade immune recognition by failing to present Ag to CD8+ CTL. Of a number of previously described MCA-induced sarcomas, one, MCA 101, fails to induce CTL, is nonimmunogenic, and grows rapidly and lethally in nonimmunosuppressed recipients. To better understand the nonimmunogenicity of MCA 101 we examined its ability to present foreign Ag to CTL. Unlike immunogenic sarcomas, MCA 101 failed to present endogenously synthesized influenza virus Ag to influenza virus-specific CTL. The deficiency in presentation of endogenous Ag by MCA 101 was attributed to a markedly reduced rate of synthesis of class I molecules because up-regulation of class I synthesis by IFN-gamma greatly increased the presentation of influenza A virus Ag. Despite low levels of cell surface class I expression, MCA 101 presented exogenous peptide Ag to anti-influenza CTL with efficiency similar to immunogenic MCA sarcoma cell lines. These findings could not be attributed to deficiencies in class I assembly or transport, as has been suggested by others who have studied mutant cells with defective Ag presentation. Furthermore, our studies suggest that some tumor cells can escape recognition by CTL and subsequent immune eradication by suppressing presentation of endogenous Ag.\r"

Studies with the two drugs in combination were compared using simultaneous or staggered (first doses of each drug were administered 6 h apart) dosing schedules. Bacterial regrowth and resistance were prevented by all combination dosing schedules; however, the simultaneous regimen consistently provided the greatest extent of killing for all strains, particularly in those initially resistant to ciprofloxacin. These enhanced effects of the combination were corroborated by an increase in the peak and duration of bactericidal activity in the analogous \"serum\" compartment of the model.

To evaluate alternative means to induce opsonic antibodies, a murine monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibody directed to an opsonic monoclonal antibody specific to MEP was produced. The anti-idiotypic antibody bound to F(ab')2 fragments of the opsonic antibody, blocked binding to MEP, bound to cross-reactive idiotopes on human opsonic antibodies to MEP, and elicited MEP-specific antibodies in syngeneic and allogeneic mice. These anti-idiotype-induced, MEP-specific antibodies fixed complement to mucoid P. aeruginosa cells and opsonized them for phagocytic killing by human leukocytes.

PMB (5 mg/kg) administered intravenously 30 min before meningococcal LOS challenge had no significant effect on heart rate, mean arterial pressure, serum bicarbonate, serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF) levels, or survival relative to controls. However, PMB premixed with LOS in vitro increased serum bicarbonate levels (P less than .05) and improved 24-h survival (P less than .05). In contrast, PMB given before E. coli LPS challenge increased serum bicarbonate levels, decreased TNF levels, and improved 24-h survival (all, P less than .05).

  ".W": "Lyme disease is a multisystemic disease caused by a tickborne spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi. Neuroborreliosis is characterized by intrathecal production of antibodies specific for the spirochete. This suggests that spirochetal infection of the central nervous system produces conditions that support the maturation of B lymphocytes to immunoglobulin-secreting cells. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) stimulates B cell differentiation into antibody-secreting cells. The present study was undertaken to determine whether B. burgdorferi can stimulate cells of central nervous system origin to secrete IL-6. C6 rat glioma cells cultured with spirochetes induced secretion of IL-6 activity. Peak stimulation was achieved at 24 h with 25 spirochetes per glioma cell. Glioma cells were also stimulated to produce IL-6 by interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor. That very few spirochetes are found in Lyme disease patients suggests that biologic amplification factors derived from the organism or the host, or both, are responsible for the pathogenesis of this disease. IL-6 can now be added to the growing list of such factors.\r"

In contrast, mitochondrial DNA deletion was observed in two of six patients with ophthalmoplegia. One suffered from typical Kearns-Sayre syndrome and the other from isolated external ophthalmoplegia. None of these patients had affected relatives. The detection of mitochondrial DNA deletion in external ophthalmoplegia and their site and size support previously reported data.\r"

Twenty-one of these underwent a PET examination after photon therapy and 12 also were studied after the end of combined therapy. CEA plasma levels were measured from blood samples taken immediately before the PET study. A significant decrease in FDG uptake despite good palliative results were observed in only 50% of the patients. This may be explained by inflammatory reactions caused by radiation injury. Inflammation and metabolically active residual tumor tissue cannot be distinguished. It is concluded that an observation interval longer than 6 mo may more effectively detect residual tumor activity. In 14 of 41 examinations, an increased FDG uptake was associated with a normal CEA value, and in only two cases were normal FDG uptake values and increased CEA levels found, suggesting that PET is more sensitive than the measurements of CEA plasma levels for tumor recurrence.\r"

  ".U": "91333105\r", 
  ".W": "OBJECTIVE. The prevalence of osteomyelitis in diabetic foot ulcers is unknown. Early diagnosis of this infection is critical, as prompt antibiotic treatment decreases the rate of amputation. We therefore assessed the prevalence of osteomyelitis in 35 diabetic patients with 41 foot ulcers. We compared results of roentgenograms, leukocyte scans with indium In 111 oxyquinoline, and bone scans with the diagnostic criterion standards of bone histologic and culture findings. Leukocyte scans were repeated at 2- to 3-week intervals during antibiotic treatment. DESIGN. Cohort study. SETTING. Institutional and private, ambulatory and hospitalized patients. PATIENTS. Consecutive sample of 54 diabetic patients. Thirty-five patients with 41 foot ulcers were included. RESULTS. As determined by bone biopsy and culture, osteomyelitis was found to underlie 28 (68%) of 41 diabetic foot ulcers. Only nine (32%) of the 28 cases were diagnosed clinically by the referring physician. Underscoring the clinically silent nature of osteomyelitis in these ulcers, 19 (68%) of 28 occurred in outpatients, 19 (68%) of 28 occurred in ulcers not exposing bone, and 18 (64%) of 28 had no evidence of inflammation on physical examination. All patients with ulcers that exposed bone had osteomyelitis. Of the imaging tests, the leukocyte scan had the highest sensitivity, 89%. In patients with osteomyelitis, the leukocyte scan image intensity decreased by 16 to 34 days of antibiotic treatment and normalized by 36 to 54 days. CONCLUSION. The majority of diabetic foot ulcers have an underlying osteomyelitis that is clinically unsuspected. Leukocyte scans are highly sensitive for diagnosing osteomyelitis in diabetic foot ulcers and may be useful for monitoring the efficacy of antibiotic treatment. We recommend that diabetic patients with foot ulcers that expose bone should be treated for osteomyelitis. Diabetic patients with foot ulcers that do not expose bone should undergo leukocyte scanning, which eliminates the risk of bone biopsy in diagnosing osteomyelitis and allows for the diagnosis and treatment of this well-known but often silent precursor of lower extremity amputation.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Nephrolithiasis may occur as a consequence of a number of hereditary disorders. We describe a large kindred from northern New York with hereditary nephrolithiasis accompanied by urinary concentrating defects, nephrocalcinosis, renal insufficiency, and renal wasting of potassium, phosphate, calcium, and uric acid. The pattern of inheritance was established by examining the patients and their records and interviewing family members. Selected members of the family were evaluated in detail, with measurements of erythrocyte cation fluxes and carbonic anhydrase (carbonate dehydratase) activity. RESULTS. The kindred consisted of 162 family members from six generations. All nine affected persons were male and appeared to have inherited the disease from their mothers. No affected man transmitted the gene to a son, but the daughters of affected men were carriers. The patients presented in childhood with calcium nephrolithiasis and proteinuria, with progression to nephrocalcinosis, urinary concentrating defects, and renal insufficiency. Renal biopsies revealed tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and glomerulosclerosis; the characteristic features of other forms of hereditary nephritis were absent. Abnormalities in the renal excretion of calcium, phosphate, potassium, and uric acid were found only in the adult members of the kindred, although renal biopsies were abnormal even in younger members. In one patient who has had a renal transplant for seven years, the disease has not recurred. CONCLUSIONS. This kindred manifested an X-linked recessive nephrolithiasis with renal failure, a new form of hereditary renal disease. Most of the identifiable physiologic abnormalities occurred after the development of nephrolithiasis and renal insufficiency and may not be of pathogenetic importance.\r"

Although minor alterations in body composition are probably of little clinical importance, losses of body protein of 10 percent or more contribute to morbidity and debility. This catabolic response can be modified and recovery can be accelerated by a variety of approaches. First, the inflammatory response can be reduced; second, specific nutrients can be provided to support the patient's tissue requirements during catabolic illness; and third, growth factors can be used to enhance protein synthesis and tissue repair. These approaches, whether used alone or in combination, will reduce the loss of body protein, which should accelerate recovery, shorten the length of hospitalization, and reduce convalescence.\r"

The first patient received Buserelin (900 micrograms/day intranasally) for 6 months. After 15 months of normal menstrual activity, the symptoms reappeared. The patient was then treated with Triptorelin (3.75 mg/month intramuscularly) for 6 months and remains asymptomatic and menstruating 14 months after discontinuing treatment. The patient presenting with pneumothorax was treated with leuprolide (1 mg/day subcutaneously) for 6 months and is asymptomatic 1 year after stopping treatment.

Agrobacterium A136 harboring plasmid pGP159, which contains virA, virG, and a reporter virB:lacZ gene fusion, was mutagenized with UV light or nitrosoguanidine. Survivors that formed blue colonies on a plate containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl beta-D-galactoside were isolated and analyzed. Quantification of beta-galactosidase activity in liquid assays identified nine mutant strains. By plasmid reconstruction and other procedures, all mutations mapped to the virA locus. These mutations caused an 11- to 560-fold increase in the vegetative level of virB:lacZ reporter gene expression. DNA sequence analysis showed that the mutations are located in four regions of VirA: transmembrane domain one, the active site, a glycine-rich region with homology to ATP-binding sites, and a region at the C terminus that has homology to the N terminus of VirG.\r"

Investigation of the conditions affecting this elevation of specific activity suggests that it is associated with density-dependent growth arrest. Fibroblasts in the exponentially doubling phase have a relatively low level of membrane phosphatase specific activity, which rises only as the rate of cell proliferation decreases and is maximal when cell growth is contact inhibited. These observations have been extended to BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts and normal human diploid fibroblasts. The increase in membrane tyrosine phosphatase activity is coupled to density arrest and not to cellular quiescence in general, as no increase in phosphatase specific activity is detected when non-contact-inhibited cells are induced to arrest their growth through serum deprivation. The observed alterations in specific activity are attributable to a tyrosine phosphatase of Mr 37,000 that was purified and characterized from solubilized membrane fractions of Swiss 3T3 cells. A regulatory mechanism controlling tyrosine phosphatase activity may play a role in cell proliferation and growth arrest caused by cell contact.\r"

CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes were isolated from the lymph nodes draining infectious lesions, and their RNA was examined for lymphokine transcripts. Distinct patterns of CD4+ cell cytokine expression were apparent: C57BL/6 CD4+ cells contained IFN-gamma and IL-2 mRNA, whereas BALB/c CD4+ cells expressed IL-4 and IL-10 message. CD8+ cells contributed little lymphokine expression during disease, but B cells were a major source of IL-2 mRNA in both strains of mice. BALB/c mice made resistant by treatment with anti-CD4 antibody at the time of infection repopulated lymph nodes with CD4+ cells that expressed IL-2 and IFN-gamma. Protective treatment with anti-IL-4 antibody in vivo also resulted in the appearance of CD4+ cells with increased IFN-gamma and diminished IL-4 and IL-10 expression. These data establish CD4+ cells as the primary source of IFN-gamma in healing mice and of IL-4 and IL-10 during progressive infection and confirm that the spectral extremes of this disease are characterized by the presence of CD4+ cells expressing Th1 or Th2 phenotypes in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Reactive gliosis is a characteristic response of astrocytes to inflammation and trauma of the central nervous system. To investigate whether soluble factors (cytokines) from inflammatory mononuclear cells that accumulate at lesion sites can provide the cellular signals to initiate gliosis and to identify such cytokines, we have tested and found that supernatants derived from subsets of activated human T lymphocytes (CD8+ or CD4+) are potent mitogens for cultured human adult astrocytes. This effect is blocked by a neutralizing antibody to gamma-interferon (IFN). Recombinant IFN alone can induce proliferation of human adult astrocytes in vitro and increase the extent of trauma-initiated gliosis in the adult mouse brain. The astrocyte proliferation-inducing activity of supernatants of glial cultures treated with IFN can be completely blocked with IFN-neutralizing antibody, suggesting that the proliferative effect does not require intermediary cytokines or cells. These results implicate IFN as an important mediator of the gliosis observed in pathologic conditions of the adult central nervous system associated with infiltrating lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "In a recently discovered class of oncogenes, GTPase-inhibiting mutations constitutively activate alpha subunits of signal-transducing guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins). Somatic mutations in a subclass of endocrine tumors are found in the arginine-179 codon of the alpha subunit of Gi2 (alpha i2), creating the putative gip2 oncogene. We have tested the ability of gip2 to mediate neoplastic transformation of Rat-1 and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts in tissue culture. Expression of a mutant alpha i2 cDNA encoding cysteine in place of arginine-179 (alpha i2-R179C) caused Rat-1 cells to grow to a higher density in monolayer culture, to lose anchorage dependence, and to form tumors when injected subcutaneously into nude mice. In contrast, expression of alpha i2-R179C failed to alter growth or tumorigenicity of NIH 3T3 cells. We conclude that gip2 is an oncogene, by the criterion that it induces neoplastic transformation of Rat-1 cells. Failure of gip2 to transform NIH 3T3 cells is in keeping with clinical indications that gip2 is a tissue-selective oncogene.\r"

These alpha i2-null cell lines regulate adenylyl cyclase and grow and differentiate in vitro the same as wild-type ES cells. Homologous recombination was used to sequentially inactivate both copies of the alpha i2 gene. The first allele was inactivated by insertion of a neomycin-resistance gene.

The techniques used should be generally applicable to other genes whether or not they are expressed in ES cells.\r"

To analyze this possibility with better spatial resolution, we made tangential microelectrode penetrations at constant eccentricity through supragranular striate cortex in 7 anesthetized, paralyzed macaque monkeys. We recorded from 121 single units. The data fell into two distinct populations with respect to mean preferred spatial frequency: (i) interblob cells (3.8 +/- 2.0 cycles/degree, n = 83) and (ii) blob cells (1.1 +/- 0.8 cycles/degree, n = 38; P less than 0.001). Beyond this, we found no evidence for an orderly mapping of spatial frequency optima. At blob-interblob borders, we observed abrupt shifts from low, relatively uniform spatial frequency optima (blobs) to higher optima that varied unsystematically (interblobs). The spatial frequency optima (low vs. high) and nature of the tuning curves (low-pass vs. band-pass) in blob vs. interblob cells correlate well with psychophysical measures of the same differences for the chrominance vs. luminance channels. These data are consistent with a functional subdivision of striate cortex in which blob cells carry information concerned predominantly with color and interblob neurons carry information important for form analysis.\r"

We used this drug to analyze the involvement of Ca2+ and Ca(2+)-ATPases in the control of growth- and transformation-related genes. Here we show that treatment of mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts with thapsigargin induced rapid expression of the c-fos and c-jun protooncogenes. Inhibition or depletion of protein kinase C partially diminished the c-fos but not the c-jun response. Furthermore, thapsigargin could synergize with the tumor promoter phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate to induce c-fos but not c-jun. However, thapsigargin had no effect on basal or phorbol ester-induced protein kinase C activity. Our results indicate that Ca2+ is a potent second messenger that controls expression of growth- and transformation-related genes. Since inhibition of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase results in a strong induction of these genes, our data suggest that this Ca2+ pump may act as a negative regulator of cell growth.\r"

Two independent mutations tested, y76d28 and y1#7, contain a 1.1-kilobase (kb) P element inserted in the 5' transcribed untranslated portion of the yellow gene. Sequences responsible for the y1#7 mutation are inserted in the same transcriptional orientation as yellow and cannot be processed by splicing, and this mutation is not suppressed by su(s) mutations. P element sequences are located in a transcriptional orientation opposite to that of the yellow gene in y76d28; these sequences can be spliced from a composite P element-yellow mRNA, resulting in low accumulation of a functional 1.9-kb yellow transcript. The levels of both the putative precursor P element-yellow RNA and the 1.9-kb yellow transcript increase in y76d28 su(s) flies, suggesting that mutations in su(s) do not affect the efficiency of splicing of the P element sequences. Analysis of y76d28 cDNAs isolated from flies carrying a wild-type or mutant su(s) gene demonstrates that the choice of splice junctions to process P element sequences is unchanged in these different backgrounds, suggesting that mutations in su(s) do not affect the selection of donor and acceptor splice sites. We propose that the su(s) protein functions to control the stability of unprocessed RNA during the splicing reaction.\r"

  ".W": "As the demand for donors for bone marrow transplantation increases, the use of HLA-matched, genetically unrelated donors represents a promising strategy. It is well documented that the clinical outcome of bone marrow transplantation is directly dependent on optimal matching for HLA class I and class II specificities. Molecular studies have revealed the existence of a much larger number of HLA class II alleles than was anticipated, many of which cannot be recognized by routine serological typing. Currently this \"hidden\" polymorphism represents a major limitation to the generalized use of unrelated donors for bone marrow transplantation. It has recently become possible, however, to identify HLA allelic polymorphism directly at the DNA level by hybridization with sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (\"HLA oligotyping\") after amplification of DNA by polymerase chain reaction. In this study, we have investigated whether donor-recipient pairs that are fully matched for HLA by serology are truly HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP identical and to what extent class II differences influence the primary mixed lymphocyte culture. We show that HLA oligotyping, performed on 50 pairs of HLA class I and II serologically matched individuals, can indeed reveal phenotypically relevant allelic differences at either DRB or DQB loci in 56% of these pairs and can therefore improve HLA class II typing and the choice of bone marrow donors quite significantly. Oligotyping for DRB/DQB/DPB polymorphism also allows prediction of a positive mixed lymphocyte culture, as established in 31 donor/recipient combinations, and even detection of polymorphic differences that were not revealed by this test. This approach is well suited for accurate HLA typing of large pools of bone marrow donors and was successfully applied to select fully matched donors for bone marrow transplantation.\r"

As was previously shown for G proteins similarly extracted from brain synaptoneurosomes, G alpha s behaved as polydisperse structures with S values higher than that of heterotrimeric G proteins. At concentrations of guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP[gamma S]) greater than 100 microM, incubation with membranes led to smaller structures having S values in the range of 4-5 S. Incubation of liver membranes with glucagon also caused a marked increase in structures having these S values; glucagon action required the presence of low concentrations of GTP[gamma S] (maximal, 10 microM), was rapid (within 10 sec), and was not observed with vasopressin, angiotensin II, or glucagon-(19-29). When G alpha s in its membrane-bound form was [32P]ADP-ribosylated by cholera toxin and the treated membranes were extracted with octyl glucoside, greater than 35% of the labeled G alpha s was found in material that sedimented through sucrose gradients and contained relatively low levels of immunoreactive G alpha s. Glucagon selectively converted the apparently large molecular weight structures to the 4-5 S structures in the presence of GTP[gamma S], even at 1 mM (the maximal effect of the nucleotide alone), when incubated with the toxin-treated membranes. These findings suggest that the glucagon receptor selectively interacts with polymer-like structures of G alpha s and that activation by GTP[gamma S] results in disaggregation. The role of the beta and gamma subunits of G proteins in the hormone-induced process is not clear since the polymer-like structures extracted with octyl glucoside are devoid of beta and gamma subunits.\r"

Information is now available to calculate this rate for several DNA-based haploid microbes, including bacteriophages with single- or double-stranded DNA, a bacterium, a yeast, and a filamentous fungus. Their genome sizes vary by approximately 6500-fold. Their average mutation rates per base pair vary by approximately 16,000-fold, whereas their mutation rates per genome vary by only approximately 2.5-fold, apparently randomly, around a mean value of 0.0033 per DNA replication. The average mutation rate per base pair is inversely proportional to genome size. Therefore, a nearly invariant microbial mutation rate appears to have evolved. Because this rate is uniform in such diverse organisms, it is likely to be determined by deep general forces, perhaps by a balance between the usually deleterious effects of mutation and the physiological costs of further reducing mutation rates.\r"

Mutations at either locus show high frequencies of nondisjunction at meiosis I and both have been shown to encode kinesin-like proteins. Unlike the ncd mutation, which affects all chromosome pairs, the nod mutation affects only the disjunction of nonexchange chromosomes. Although both the nod and ncd mutations are fully recessive, females doubly heterozygous for nod and ncd mutations show levels of X and fourth chromosome nondisjunction that are 6- to 35-fold above those observed in control females. Exchange between chromosomes can suppress this effect; thus, only nonexchange chromosomes segregating via the distributive system are sensitive in double heterozygotes. Since the phenotype of double heterozygotes mimics that of the nod mutation, we infer that ncd is a dominant enhancer of nod. Failure of ncd to fully complement nod reveals the chromosome segregation machinery to be dosage sensitive. The probability that the distributive system will fail is enhanced in females simultaneously haploinsufficient at the nod and ncd loci.\r"

CP vaccines for these pathogens are not available because poly(alpha 2-8NeuNAc) alone, as a complex or a conjugate, is poorly immunogenic. Because oligomers of poly(alpha 2-8NeuNAc) in fetal brain and other tissues bind antibodies in vitro, it has been suggested that antibodies to this CP might be pathologic. We synthesized conjugates of this CP with tetanus toxoid under conditions that avoid lactone formation. Using this scheme, we also synthesized conjugates of group C meningococcal CP (poly[(2----9)-alpha-N-acetylneuraminic acid] or poly(alpha 2-9NeuNAc] and of E. coli K92 CP [poly(alpha 2-8, alpha 2-9NeuNAc)].

We report here that purified recombinant human TGF-beta (greater than or equal to 300 pg/ml) can stimulate rapidly (within 2 h) the u-PA activity of nonrheumatoid synovial fibroblast-like cells. As for interleukin 1 (IL-1), u-PA mRNA levels are raised in response to TGF-beta, but unlike IL-1, no increase in prostaglandin E2 levels occurs. In contrast to a number of other examples in the literature, in which these two cytokines have opposing actions, TGF-beta can potentiate the action of optimal concentrations of IL-1 in enhancing u-PA expression. These effects of TGF-beta are similar to those of all-trans-retinoic acid. In addition, synovial fibroblast DNA synthesis was stimulated by TGF-beta. Because TGF-beta has been detected in the synovia of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and has been shown to reduce the collagenase levels and proliferation of synovial fibroblast-like cells, it has been proposed by others to be involved beneficially in the reparative processes occurring in arthritic lesions. However, on the basis of our findings, we propose alternative functions for this cytokine--namely, roles in the destructive events as well as in the synovial hyperplasia observed in rheumatoid joints.\r"

We have developed a strategy for introducing additional sites for PEG attachment by using site-directed mutagenesis to selectively replace arginine with lysine codons and tested it with purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) from Escherichia coli, an extremely stable but immunogenic enzyme, that could potentially be used to treat an inherited deficiency of PNP. A triple mutant, RK3, possessing three Arg----Lys substitutions was constructed that increased the number of lysines per PNP subunit from 14 to 17, providing an additional 18 potential PEG attachment sites per hexameric enzyme molecule. The wild-type and RK3 enzymes had similar catalytic activity, antigenicity, and immunogenicity. After PEG modification, both enzymes retained catalytic activity, the plasma half-life of both enzymes in mice increased from approximately 4 hr to 4 days, and the binding of both enzymes by antisera raised against each unmodified enzyme was markedly diminished. However, antibody raised against wild-type PEG-PNP did not bind the PEG-RK3 enzyme. PEG-RK3 PNP was also substantially less immunogenic than wild-type PEG-PNP. Accelerated antibody-mediated clearance of PEG-PNP occurred in 2 of 12 mice treated with PEG-RK3 PNP, compared with 10 of 16 mice treated with the modified wild-type enzyme. This combined use of directed mutagenesis and PEG modification is aimed at permitting the widest choice of proteins, including products of genetic and chemical \"engineering,\" to be used for therapy of inherited and acquired disorders.\r"

Two major transcripts of 5.8 and 5.2 kilobases are produced from this locus by alternative splicing and are present throughout the entire life cycle. Sequence analyses of cDNAs corresponding to these two classes of transcripts predict two proteins of 1597 and 395 amino acids. The first shows similarity in its carboxyl-terminal region to the catalytic domain of a vertebrate calcium-activated neutral protease (calpain), whereas its amino-terminal region contains several zinc-finger-like repeats of the form WXCX2CX10-11CX2C. The second predicted protein contains only the first two of the zinc-finger-like repeats and is missing the calpain domain.

In contrast to these results, we have found that immunization of Lewis rats with such peptides in complete Freund's adjuvant prior to induction of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis with myelin basic protein leads to responses ranging from profound disease enhancement to lack of disease. In some cases, enhanced disease was followed by a prolonged neurologic deficit that resembles multiple sclerosis more closely than does acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. These findings, on the one hand, support previous results showing T-cell receptor peptide-induced modulation of the disease experimental allergic encephalomyelitis and, on the other, indicate that such immunization is not a reliable method for inducing suppression of encephalitogenic effector cells.\r"

The deduced amino acid sequence predicts a protein of approximately 369 amino acids with a strong homology to other members of the family of protein-tyrosine-phosphatases. In vitro translation produces a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 46 kDa. A potential attachment mechanism to the cytoplasmic membrane is suggested by a myristoylation amino acid-consensus sequence at the N terminus of the protein. RNA analyses of various regions of rat brain reveal a 3-kilobase (kb) and a 4.4-kb mRNA. The 3-kb mRNA is highly enriched within the striatum relative to other brain areas and has been termed a \"striatum enriched phosphatase\" (STEP). In contrast, the 4.4-kb message is most abundant in the cerebral cortex and rare in the striatum. These two messages appear to be alternatively processed RNA transcripts of a single gene.\r"

The neuron innervating the antero-notopleural bristle was filled with horseradish peroxidase and studied at the light- and electron-microscopy level. In the mutants dnc and rut, this neuron has an abnormally large number of side branches and varicosities in a defined segment of the axon. In wild-type flies, age tends to decrease the number of side branches and variacosities in the same axonal segment that is affected by the mutations. Ultrastructural studies are compatible with the interpretation that the varicosities are potential synaptic sites. The results suggest that the cAMP cascade plays a role in shaping neuronal connectivity.\r"

Using second derivative absorption spectroscopy, the conformation of the cytochrome a cofactor has been investigated during steady-state turnover of this enzyme. Resting cytochrome c oxidase displays a transition for ferric cytochrome a at 430 nm. During aerobic steady-state turnover, this band is replaced by a ferrous cytochrome a transition at 450 nm. When anaerobicity is achieved, the transition occurs at 444 nm. The 450-nm-absorbing species is thus the dominant form during turnover, suggesting that conformational transitions of cytochrome a direct electron transfer during catalysis and may direct as well proton translocation in the last step of the respiratory electron transfer chain.\r"

The cholinergic differentiation factor (CDF, also known as leukemia inhibitory factor, LIF) induces cultured rat sympathetic neurons to become cholinergic, without affecting their survival or growth. To understand the role of this factor in normal development, it is essential to determine where it is produced in situ. To localize CDF/LIF mRNA, a semiquantitative, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction method was employed. Actin and tubulin mRNA were used as internal controls, and two different sets of CDF/LIF primers were compared. In postnatal rat peripheral tissues, CDF/LIF mRNA was selectively localized in the target area of developing, sympathetic cholinergic neurons; the mRNA was not detected in the targets of sympathetic noradrenergic neurons. This finding supports the hypothesis that CDF/LIF is a target-derived neuronal differentiation factor. In postnatal rat brain, CDF/LIF mRNA is localized selectively in two parts of the visual system, visual cortex and superior colliculus. Thus, CDF/LIF may play a role in this system as well.\r"

This cleavage reaction can proceed in vitro in the presence of activated RecA or as an intramolecular RecA-independent reaction, termed autodigestion, that is stimulated by alkaline pH. Here we describe a set of LexA mutant proteins that undergo a greatly increased rate of specific cleavage in vivo, compared with wild-type LexA. Efficient in vivo cleavage of these mutant proteins also took place without RecA. Several lines of evidence suggest that cleavage occurred via a mechanism similar to autodigestion. These mutations changed Gln-92, which lies near the cleavage site, to tyrosine, phenylalanine, or tryptophan. The latter mutation increased the rate of cleavage approximately 500-fold. These findings imply that the rate of wild-type LexA cleavage has been optimized during evolution to make the SOS system properly responsive to DNA-damaging treatments. Availability of these mutants will aid in the understanding of rate-limiting steps in intramolecular reactions.\r"

Contrary to previous studies, spider monkey was found to have not one but two gamma-globin genes, only one of which (gamma 2) is functional. The reconstructed evolutionary history of the gamma-globin genes and their flanking sequences traces their origin to a tandem duplication of a DNA segment approximately 5.5 kilobases long that occurred before catarrhine primates (humans, apes, and Old World monkeys) diverged from platyrrhines (New World monkeys), much earlier than previously thought. This reconstructed molecular history also reveals that the duplication resulted from an unequal homologous crossover between two related L1 long interspersed repetitive elements, one upstream and one downstream of the single ancestral gamma-globin gene. Perhaps facilitated by the redundancy resulting from the duplication, the gamma-globin genes escaped the selective constraints of embryonically functioning genes and evolved into fetally functioning genes. This view is supported by the finding that a burst of nonsynonymous substitutions occurred in the gamma-globin genes while they became restructured for fetal expression in the common ancestor of platyrrhines and catarrhines.\r"

  ".W": "The glycosylation enzyme alpha-1,3-galactosyltransferase (alpha 1,3GT; UDPgalactose:beta-D-galactosyl-1,4-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminide alpha-1,3-galactosyltransferase, EC 2.4.1.151) displays a unique pattern of distribution in mammals. It synthesizes an abundance of Gal(alpha 1-3)Gal(beta 1-4)GlcNAc-R (alpha-galactosyl) epitopes within the Golgi apparatus of cells of nonprimate mammals, prosimians, and New World monkeys (platyrrhines). The catarrhines, which include Old World monkeys, apes, and humans, lack this enzyme activity because of the inactivation of the alpha 1,3GT gene. In contrast, the catarrhines produce large amounts of antibodies, designated anti-Gal, against the alpha-galactosyl epitope. The inactivation of the alpha 1,3GT gene in ancestral catarrhines was probably the result of an intensive evolutionary pressure for alteration in the makeup of cell surface carbohydrates (i.e., suppression of alpha-galactosyl epitope expression) and for the production of the anti-Gal antibody. To determine the period in which the alpha 1,3GT gene was inactivated in ancestral catarrhines, comparative sequencing of a 370-base-pair region of this gene was performed by polymerase chain reactions with DNA of various primates. The data suggest that alpha 1,3GT inactivation occurred rather late in the course of catarrhine evolution (less than 28 million years ago), as separate events in apes and in Old World monkeys, after the two groups diverged from each other.\r"

  ".U": "91334474\r", 
  ".W": "Hemophilia A is an X chromosome-linked disorder resulting from deficiency of factor VIII, an important protein in blood coagulation. A large number of disease-producing mutations have been reported in the factor VIII gene. However, a comprehensive analysis of the mutations has been difficult because of the large gene size, its many scattered exons, and the high frequency of de novo mutations. Recently, we have shown that nearly all mutations resulting in mild-to-moderate hemophilia A can be detected by PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). In this study, we attempted to discover the mutations causing severe hemophilia A by analyzing 47 unselected patients, 30 of whom had severe hemophilia and 17 of whom had mild-to-moderate disease. Using DGGE as a screening method, we analyzed 99% of the coding region, 94% of the splice junctions, the promoter region, and the polyadenylylation site of the gene. We found the mutation in 16 of 17 (94%) patients with mild-to-moderate disease but in only 16 of 30 (53%) patients with severe hemophilia A. Since DGGE after computer analysis appears to detect all mutations in a given fragment, the lower-than-expected yield of mutations in patients with severe disease is likely not due to failure of the detection method; it is probably due to the presence of mutations in DNA sequences outside the regions studied. Such sequences may include locus-controlling regions, other sequences within introns or outside the gene that are important for its expression, or another gene involved in factor VIII expression that is very closely linked to the factor VIII gene.\r"

Expression of alpha 2-subunit mRNA was characteristic of glia, whereas alpha 3-subunit transcripts were predominant in neurons. Transcripts encoding the beta 1 subunit were detected in neurons, whereas beta 2-subunit mRNA expression was characteristic of glia. mRNA encoding both beta-subunit isoforms was present in choroidal epithelial cells.

Respiratory resistance (impedance) was measured with the pseudo-random noise forced oscillation technique while the subjects rebreathed from a wet spirometer in a closed respiratory circuit in which end tidal carbon dioxide tension (PCO2) could be controlled. Hypercapnia was induced by partially short circuiting the carbon dioxide absorber, and hypocapnia by voluntary hyperventilation. The circulating air was saturated with water vapour and kept at body temperature and ambient pressure. A rise of end tidal PCO2 of 1 kPa caused a significant fall in respiratory resistance in both normal and asthmatic subjects (15% and 9% respectively). A fall of PCO2 of 1 kPa did not cause any significant change in impedance in the control group. In the asthmatic patients resistance increased by 13%, reactance fell by 45%, and the frequency dependence of resistance rose 240%. These findings confirm that hypocapnia may contribute to airway obstruction in asthmatic patients, even when water and heat loss are prevented.\r"

Measurements of arterial blood gas tensions and maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) were performed before and after six hours of negative pressure ventilation or standard treatment (control day) given in random order on two consecutive days. After negative pressure ventilation the mean (SD) value of MIP increased from 68.1 (21.5) to 74.8 (20) cm H2O;* arterial oxygen tension (PaCO2) fell from 60.6 (12.2) to 50.9 (8.9) mm Hg* but PaO2 changed little (from 48.4 (7.4) to 47.6 (8.2) mm Hg). There were no significant changes on the control day in arterial blood gas tensions (PaO2 47.8 (8.1) and 48.9 (9.4) and Paco2 59.8 (10.9) and 57.5 (8.06) mm Hg) or in MIP (69.4 (22.4) and 70.9 (22.9) cm H2O). Six patients tolerated negative pressure ventilation poorly and these patients showed less improvement after negative pressure ventilation. Our results suggest that intermittent negative pressure ventilation can increase alveolar ventilation in patients with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive lung disease, particularly in those who tolerate the procedure well. Most subjects showed a fall in PaCO2 and an increase in MIP. The fact that PaO2 was unchanged despite the fall in PaCO2 suggests that gas exchange may deteriorate with negative pressure ventilation in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "Lactase is an enterocyte brush-border membrane beta-glycosidase that splits lactose, the sugar of milk. In mammals, including many human populations, intestinal lactase activity is very high in the suckling and declines to low levels after weaning. There are two human adult lactase phenotypes, one in which high lactase activity persists and another in which it declines. Two alleles have been postulated to explain these different phenotypes. In the present study lactase mRNA levels have been investigated in the small intestine (a) of rabbits and rats, at different ages, considered as models for mammals, and (b) of human adults with the two lactase phenotypes. In rabbits and rats, high levels of lactase mRNA are present up to the weaning period, a time at which a consistent decrease of this mRNA is found, a decrease that parallels that of lactase activity. It is surprising that after this period adult animals of both species express again high levels of lactase mRNA, whereas lactase activity remains at very low levels. Our results suggest that in the adult rabbits and rats the main control of lactase gene expression is likely to be at a posttranscriptional level. Similarly, in man no clear difference was found at the RNA level between adults with hypolactasia and adults with persistent high lactase activity, a result that also indicates a posttranscriptional control of lactase expression.\r"

The TaqI and XbaI polymorphisms were used in an investigation of linkage disequilibrium throughout the cluster of constant-region genes. The TaqI polymorphism, located 5' to the C delta gene, is in linkage disequilibrium with a polymorphism of the C mu switch region. The XbaI polymorphism, which is in the vicinity of the C delta 2 exon, is not strongly associated with any other polymorphisms, including the TaqI polymorphism and the Gm polymorphism of C gamma 3. Although there is a high degree of association between most genes of the IGH region, there is a lack of association between C delta and C gamma 3, which may indicate a hot spot for recombination.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of glibenclamide treatment on insulin action in isolated fat cells was studied in eight moderately obese patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Insulin receptor binding and the effect of insulin on glucose transport and lipogenesis were determined before and after 3 months of glibenclamide therapy. At the end of the treatment period, mean daytime plasma glucose concentrations were reduced (10.8 +/- 0.4 versus 7.0 +/- 0.3 mmol/L, p less than 0.001) whereas mean daytime plasma insulin level was increased (40 +/- 12 versus 71 +/- 9 mU/L, p less than 0.001). Adipocyte insulin receptor binding as well as basal glucose transport and metabolism were unaffected by drug treatment. In contrast, insulin-stimulated glucose transport and lipogenesis were both significantly enhanced (p less than 0.05). These findings are comparable to those of another study involving seven moderately obese subjects with NIDDM who had biopsies of the lateral vastus muscle taken for measurement of insulin receptor function and glycogen synthase activity before and during 2 months of gliclazide treatment. In that study insulin receptors purified with wheatgerm agglutinin showed unchanged insulin binding and receptor kinase activity. Moreover, gliclazide had no impact on maximal glycogen synthase activity. However, under physiologic hyperinsulinemic conditions gliclazide therapy was associated with an increased sensitivity of glycogen synthase for its allosteric activation by glucose-6-phosphatase (p less than 0.04). In conclusion, sulfonylurea treatment of NIDDM enhances insulin-stimulated peripheral glucose utilization in part through a potentiation of insulin action on adipose tissue glucose transport and lipogenesis and skeletal muscle glycogen synthase.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined the effect of gliclazide on tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA)-related fibrinolysis in 23 Type I diabetic patients without residual beta-cell function and 17 Type II diabetic patients initially treated with tolbutamide. The Type I diabetic patients received gliclazide for a period of 6 months; the Type II diabetic patients were shifted from tolbutamide to gliclazide. In Type I diabetic patients, after 2-3 months of treatment with gliclazide, we observed a significant increase in plasma concentrations of total t-PA antigen that remained stable until discontinuation of the drug (p less than 0.0002), whereas the plasma concentrations of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) did not change significantly during the study. Next, we investigated the possibility of gliclazide inducing t-PA-related fibrinolysis in a subset of Type II diabetics without detectable concentrations of t-PA during treatment with tolbutamide. The concentrations of active t-PA increased significantly 3 months after a change in treatment to gliclazide, and active t-PA again decreased in one patient to undetectable levels after 12 months with gliclazide. Moreover, the plasma concentrations of total t-PA antigen increased significantly (p less than 0.02) in this group of diabetic patients while PAI remained unchanged. The changes in t-PA-related fibrinolysis could not be related in either Type I or Type II diabetics to changes in metabolic state evaluated by blood glucose, HbA1c, cholesterol, triglycerides, or apolipoproteins A and B. We conclude that gliclazide has the potential to exert extrametabolic non-insulin-mediated effects on t-PA-related fibrinolysis in diabetic patients.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the effects of blood volume reduction on fetal plasma atrial natriuretic factor concentrations, chronically catheterized ovine fetuses at 109 to 138 days' gestation were subjected either to withdrawal of two consecutive blood samples or to a moderate hemorrhage. In fetuses from which two blood samples of 3.5 ml each (approximately 1% of fetal blood volume) were withdrawn under basal conditions at 15- to 30-minute intervals, plasma atrial natriuretic factor concentrations in the second sample decreased by 17 +/- 7 pg/ml from 178 +/- 8 pg/ml in the first sample (p less than 0.02). If the fetal blood removed during the first sample was replaced with an equal volume of maternal blood, plasma atrial natriuretic factor concentrations did not change significantly. In these same samples, plasma arginine vasopressin and angiotensin II concentrations were unchanged between the two samples regardless of whether volume was replaced. In fetuses subjected to hemorrhages of 21% +/- 2% over 10 minutes without blood replacement, plasma atrial natriuretic factor concentration at 1.5 hours after hemorrhage was suppressed by 42 +/- 10 pg/ml from basal level of 139 +/- 9 pg/ml (p less than 0.05). Plasma atrial natriuretic factor returned to control levels by 5.5 hours after hemorrhage as blood volume returned to normal. Thus in the ovine fetus a reduction in blood volume results in a decrease in plasma atrial natriuretic factor concentrations. Also, atrial natriuretic factor appears to be more sensitive to changes in blood volume than other vasoactive hormones studied.\r"

DESIGN: Monthly surveillance for MRSA colonization of nares, perineum, rectum, and wounds. SETTING: Long-term care facility attached to an acute care Veterans Affairs medical center. PATIENTS: All 341 patients in the facility had monthly surveillance cultures for 1 year. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Colonization and infection with MRSA. MAIN RESULTS: The monthly MRSA colonization rate was 23% +/- 1.0%; colonization occurred most commonly in the nares and wounds. Poor functional status was associated with MRSA colonization. Most patients (65%) never acquired MRSA; 25% of patients were already colonized at admission to the facility or at the start of the study, and only 10% of newly admitted patients acquired MRSA while in the facility. These latter patients acquired several different strains in a pattern of acquisition similar to that generally seen within the facility. In the course of 1 year, only nine patients who acquired MRSA had a roommate with the same phage type; no clustering was evident, and none of these patients developed infection. Nine other patients (3%) developed MRSA infection; five of these patients required hospitalization, but none died as a result of infection. CONCLUSIONS: In the long-term care facility in which our study took place, MRSA was endemic, and the infection rate was low. In such settings, the cost effectiveness of aggressive management of MRSA (widespread screening for MRSA and eradication with antimicrobial agents) needs to be assessed.\r"

DESIGN: Cross-sectional identification and prospective evaluation of seropositive donors; retrospective assessment of infectivity; and nested case-control study for risk factors. SETTING: Liver unit of a referral-based university hospital. SUBJECTS: Of 30,231 consecutive donors, 368 (1.2%) were found to be anti-HCV-reactive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Two hundred and fifty-four of these 368 donors were evaluated for risk factors by comparison with 284 age- and sex-matched controls. Eighty-six spouses of seropositive donors were also evaluated. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-four percent of the seropositive donors had a history of percutaneous exposure to blood. This rate increased to 45% when only those donors confirmed to be anti-HCV positive by a second-generation recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA-2) were considered. A family history of liver disease (odds ratio, 2.8; 95% Cl, 1.6 to 4.8), previous blood transfusion (odds ratio, 6.1; 95% Cl, 3 to 12.5), and a history of tattooing or intravenous drug abuse (odds ratio, 8.4; 95% Cl, 2.3 to 31) were associated with anti-HCV seropositivity. An elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was found in 58% of the seropositive donors. Of the 150 donors tested, 104 (69%; Cl, 62% to 77%) were confirmed by RIBA-2 to be anti-HCV positive. Of the 105 donors who had a biopsy, 16% had normal histologic findings, 11% had minimal changes, 21% had chronic persistent hepatitis, 45% had chronic active hepatitis, and 7% had active cirrhosis. All 77 donors with RIBA-2-confirmed seropositivity had histologic abnormalities. Of 43 donors evaluated in an infectivity study, 82% were implicated in previous HCV transmission. Only 2.3% of the spouses were anti-HCV positive. The ELISA, RIBA-2, and ALT results correlated with infectivity and abnormal histologic findings. CONCLUSIONS: In our geographic area, almost 70% of donors who are anti-HCV positive by ELISA are confirmed to be positive by RIBA-2; most of these donors appear to be chronic carriers of HCV and have substantial liver disease.\r"

This propensity to carry nontypeable H influenzae might explain why nontypeable H influenzae is a major cause of recurrent or chronic otitis media.\r"

The patients were divided into two groups: group A, (n = 9) suffering from a mild form of IEO, and group B (n = 15), suffering from a more severe form of the disease. Diabetes mellitus was the main underlying disease in these patients. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the only pathogen in 18 infected ears and part of the polymicrobial flora in an additional 6. Cure was observed in 83.3% of the patients. Two of the cured patients required more than one course of ofloxacin treatment. Development of P aeruginosa resistant to ofloxacin (n = 3) and severe allergic reaction (n = 1) required the discontinuation of ofloxacin therapy. Other side effects such as nausea, arthralgia, and vaginal itching were minimal. Oral administration of ofloxacin seems to be an effective, convenient, relatively safe, and economical therapy of IEO caused by the susceptible organism.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the contribution of the recently identified hepatitis C virus to chronic liver diseases of unknown cause and chronic hepatitis attributed by exclusion to non-A, non-B hepatitis, we tested for antibody to hepatitis C in hepatitis B surface antigen-negative patients with a spectrum of chronic liver diseases. Antibody to hepatitis C virus, a marker of hepatitis C infection, was detected with a first-generation radioimmunoassay at the following frequencies in the following patient groups: 69% of transfusion-associated non-A, non-B hepatitis; 53% of non-transfusion-associated non-A, non-B hepatitis; 26% of hepatitis B surface antigen-negative hepatocellular carcinoma; 8% of cryptogenic cirrhosis; 5% to 7% of autoimmune chronic liver diseases; 19% of patients with miscellaneous types of chronic liver disease; and 0.67% of healthy controls. Among non-transfusion-associated cases, 81% with a history of intravenous drug use but only 18% with occupational exposure as health workers had antibody to hepatitis C virus. Among cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, 63% of Japanese patients but only 11% of American patients had evidence of hepatitis C infection. Comparison in a subgroup of 79 serum samples of a second-generation radioimmunoassay with the first-generation assay demonstrated a 12% increase in antibody frequency from 30% to 42%. We conclude that hepatitis C plays a substantial role in transfusion-associated and non-transfusion-associated non-A, non-B hepatitis as well as in hepatocellular carcinoma, especially in Japan, a limited role in cryptogenic cirrhosis, and essentially no role in autoimmune chronic liver diseases. Application of more sensitive immunoassays will increase the frequency of antibody seropositivity in all subgroups, but relative distinctions among risk groups are likely to remain.\r"

The calculated sensitivity and specificity for PAR were 58% (95% confidence interval, 47% to 69%) and 69% (95% confidence interval, 44% to 94%), respectively. In this population with a stone prevalence of 85%, the positive predictive value of PAR was 91%. A clinical scoring system based on signs and symptoms fared as well as PAR (sensitivity, 73%; specificity, 46%; and positive predictive value, 88%). The strategy of clinical scoring followed by selective use of intravenous pyelography was more cost-effective than strategies using PAR. We conclude that the PAR has low sensitivity and specificity and improves the predictive value only marginally, and its routine use is not cost-effective.\r"

Deep vein thrombosis was diagnosed by bilateral ascending phlebography 7 to 11 days after operation. Two hundred forty-six patients were included and 219 were eligible for analysis. Deep vein thrombosis was diagnosed in seven of 108 patients in the LMWH group and in 24 of 111 patients in the dextran group. Clinical symptoms of pulmonary embolism did not develop in any patients during the study. In the postoperative period, patients receiving LMWH had a lower blood loss in drains and required fewer blood transfusions than patients receiving dextran, although no significant differences were noted between the groups with respect to the total number of blood transfusions required. Bleeding events and adverse events did not differ between the groups. None of the patients died in hospital during the study. One patient in the LMWH group died at home 15 days after the operation. Three patients receiving dextran had development of symptomatic deep vein thrombosis after hospital discharge. In conclusion, enoxaparin was a more effective thromboprophylactic than a standard regimen of dextran in patients undergoing total hip replacement. The two regimens were equally safe under the clinical conditions.\r"

When untreated, in the DS rat the pressure-natriuresis curve was blunted (P less than .05) and excretion of prostaglandin E2 (38 +/- 11 to 109 +/- 43 pg/min) was decreased in comparison to the DR rat. With indomethacin, the pressure-natriuresis curve in the DR rat was blunted, while no significant changes were observed in the DS rat. Plasma renin activity and concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide were not changed by the treatment of indomethacin in both strains. These results suggest that the decrease in renal prostaglandins, at least in prostaglandin E2, plays some role in blunting pressure natriuresis in DS rat.\r"

Compared to young, the old had higher basal ANP levels (O = 142 +/- 41 v Y = 29 +/- 4 pmol/L, P less than .025), achieved higher plasma levels with low-dose infusion (O = 327 +/- 24 v Y = 155 +/- 37 pmol/L, P less than .001) and had a longer ANP half-life (O = 7.8 +/- 0.6 v Y = 4.3 +/- 0.6 min, P less than .001), suggesting decreased catabolism in the old compared to the young. Despite these age-related differences in ANP levels, there was no difference in urinary sodium or cyclic GMP excretion. After termination of the low-dose infusion, plasma ANP and urinary cGMP promptly returned to baseline levels. Despite this, a sustained natriuresis (2-fold above control) was observed for 3 h in both groups. Low-dose infusion was associated with sustained suppression of aldosterone with minimal hemodynamic changes. During high-dose infusions there was no difference in natriuresis or peak ANP levels between the two groups (O = 1299 +/- 93 v Y = 1140 +/- 54 pmol/L). In contrast to the low-dose infusion, the high-dose infusion produced a transient natriuresis lasting only for the duration of the infusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Atrial natriuretic factor 95-126 [ANF (95-126)] is a novel 32 amino acid peptide which is thought to originate from the kidney. The systemic hemodynamic and renal effects of equimolar doses of intravenous synthetic ANF (95-126) and synthetic alpha ANF (99-126) were examined in normal dogs (n = 6) and in dogs with an arteriovenous (AV) fistula and chronic compensated high-output heart failure (n = 5). ANF (95-126) and alpha ANF (99-126) were infused at 5 and 10 pmol/kg/min for 75-min periods each. In the normal and AV fistula dogs the two peptides similarly decreased mean arterial pressures and right atrial pressures (P less than .05). Creatinine clearance and urinary volume excretion increased (P less than .05) in the normal dogs with both peptides, but only ANF (95-126) produced significant elevations (P less than .05) of these two parameters in the AV fistula animals. With the highest infusion dose, ANF (95-126) increased urinary sodium excretion to at least twice the levels observed with alpha ANF (99-126) in both groups of dogs (P less than .05). The decreases in plasma renin and aldosterone were comparable for the two peptides in both groups of animals. These results indicate that ANF (95-126) is more potent than alpha ANF (99-126) for the promotion of a natriuresis, particularly in AV fistula dogs with compensated high-output heart failure, in which the sodium excretory actions of alpha ANF (99-126) were attenuated markedly.\r"

Although there was no difference in the sustained force development between SHR and WKY vessels in response to 100 mmol/L KCl or 10 mumol/L Phe in Ca(2+)-containing medium, the transient contractile response to 10 mumol/L Phe in Ca(2+)-free medium was substantially smaller in SHR compared to that in WKY. Subsequent addition of 2.5 mmol/L Ca2+ restored the sustained contractile response to a similar level in both SHR and WKY vessels. The transient contractile response to Phe in Ca(2+)-free medium containing EGTA, presumably due to the release of intracellular Ca2+, decreased progressively with preincubation time in Ca(2+)-free medium, indicating intracellular Ca2+ depletion. Such a temporal change of aortic response was more pronounced in SHR than in WKY. The subsequent response to Ca2+ repletion in the presence of Phe, on the other hand, increased progressively with Ca(2+)-depletion period and was higher in SHR than in WKY. The rate of relaxation after washout of Phe was slower in SHR aorta compared to WKY aorta. These results, together with our earlier findings, collectively suggest that the previous known deficiency in Ca2+ pumping mechanisms of vascular muscle microsomes leading to a reduced functional size of intracellular Ca2+ pool may account for the smaller contractile response of SHR aorta to alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation in Ca(2+)-free medium and the slower rate of relaxation.\r"

Plasma levels of BNP increased time-dependently during the development of CHF, and were more than four-fold higher in sodium retaining rats than in control rats. The data suggest that BNP secretion from the atria is increased in CHF, and that resistance to BNP, in addition to the relative resistance to atrial natriuretic factor, may contribute to sodium retention in CHF.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the existence of a relationship between atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and plasma Na+/K+ATPase inhibitory activity in humans, we examined the hemodynamic and humoral response to volume expansion in 41 borderline hypertensive patients (BHT) with either normal (n = 33) or low plasma renin activity (n = 8). The study was carried out by measuring blood pressure, forearm circulation, plasma renin activity (PRA), ANF, and plasma levels of an endogenous Na+/K+ATPase inhibitor before and after 2 h of acute intravenous NaCl infusion (0.22 mL/min/kg bodyweight). The early (45 min) changes of ANF and those of Na+/K+ATPase inhibitory activity attained at the end of saline infusion were inversely related in BHT with normal PRA and directly related in the low-PRA population (r = 0.64). The time-course of ANF response to sodium loading was significantly delayed in BHT characterized by normal venous distensibility. They also showed a greater increase in plasma Na+/K+ATPase inhibitory activity occurring with an hypertensive, vasoconstrictive, and sodium retaining response as well. We conclude that in normal PRA borderline hypertensives, ANF may modulate the release of a plasma Na+/K+ATPase inhibitor in a setting where extracellular volume is acutely expanded. Our findings also suggest that dissimilarities in peripheral venous distensibility are able to influence the time-course of ANF response. The blunted ANF increase observed in response to NaCl loading in a subset of BHT could represent an early marker of the attitude of such patients to develop high blood pressure leading to the release of a Na(+)-pump inhibitor and influencing individual salt-sensitivity.\r"

  ".W": "In the present study inactivated human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) was conjugated to Brucella abortus and tested for immunogenicity in normal and anti-L3T4-treated BALB/c mice. HIV-BA was more immunogenic than uncoupled HIV in normal mice, since 6-fold less virus in HIV-BA preparations elicited higher titer responses than HIV-1 alone. Furthermore, the HIV-BA antibody response reached higher levels before the HIV-1 response. Immunoblot analysis showed that most of the HIV-1 antigens were recognized by antibodies induced by either HIV-1 or HIV-BA. Isotype analysis revealed that HIV-1 induced similar levels of IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies, whereas the IgG2a responses to HIV-BA were more pronounced than the IgG1 response. These different IgG subclass patterns suggest that conjugation of HIV-1 to BA changed the immunogenic nature of HIV-1. The requirement for helper T cells was examined by immunizing mice that were depleted of CD4+ T cells by in vivo anti-L3T4 treatment. Under these conditions the IgG responses to HIV-1 were completely eliminated. Although HIV-BA antibody responses were markedly reduced in anti-L3T4-treated mice, anti-HIV-1 antibodies, mainly of the IgG2a isotype, were produced. The antibodies generated by HIV-1 and HIV-BA immunization were also tested for their ability to inhibit syncytia formed by infecting CD4 + CEM cells with gp160 vaccinia. Sera from normal mice, immunized with either HIV-1 or HIV-BA were capable of inhibiting syncytia. In contrast, following anti-L3T4 treatment, only mice immunized with HIV-BA, but not HIV-1, produced antibodies capable of inhibiting syncytia.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine the effect of a short course of the GnRH analogue buserelin and human menopausal gonadotrophin (hMG), for ovarian stimulation in our IVF programme, on reproductive endocrinology and pregnancy rates compared with conventional clomiphene citrate and hMG treatment. DESIGN--Prospective randomized allocation to one of two ovulation stimulation regimens. SETTING--Fertility clinic. SUBJECTS--373 infertile couples with various factors associated with their subfertility. All the women were less than 46 years of age and had normal menstrual cycles. INTERVENTION--The first group (n = 151) was given clomiphene citrate (CC) from days 2-6 of the menstrual cycle and hMG from day 5 onwards (CC/hMG). The second group (n = 222) was given buserelin from days 1-3 and hMG from day 2 (buserelin/hMG). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Concentration of plasma luteinizing hormone (LH), oestradiol (E2) and progesterone, number of ovulatory follicles induced and the occurrence of pregnancy. RESULTS--Plasma LH, E2 and progesterone concentrations were reduced in the late follicular phase after buserelin/hMG compared with CC/hMG. Buserelin/hMG promoted the development of more follicles than CC/hMG. The overall pregnancy rate after buserelin/hMG was not significantly different from that following CC/hMG treatment. CONCLUSION--The chance of pregnancy is not improved by the short-term use of buserelin with hMG, provided adequate follicular phase management is maintained.\r"

Under basal culture conditions low levels of class I antigens were detected on a small percentage of cells, but there was no visible class II. IFN-gamma and TNF alpha stimulation enhanced class I expression. TNF alpha had no effect on class II expression, whereas IFN-gamma induced the expression of class II in a dose dependent manner.

Many, if not the majority, of these predominantly young patients are cured but the neuropsychometric, neuroendocrine and growth morbidity of neuraxis radiotherapy on children by conventional methods may be considerable; patients receiving such therapy at an early age often are eventually in the educationally subnormal category. Recent radiobiological data support the concept that all aspects of CNS radiation tolerance are heavily dependent on daily fraction size. We describe a new radiotherapy technique that allows lower daily fraction sizes to be delivered to the neuraxis without prejudicing the total dose to the neuraxis or primary area and without prolonging the overall treatment time. Published radiobiological data support the concept that all the major morbidities attributed to conventional neuraxis radiotherapy will be reduced by the currently described technique without reducing tumour control rates.\r"

In one patient, tumor response to tamoxifen has been maintained over several years of treatment. In the second patient, who had inoperable mesenteric fibromatosis, the tumor progressed on tamoxifen but regressed after treatment with Zoladex (goserelin acetate, ICI, Melbourne, Australia) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). To the authors' knowledge this is the first report of the use of Zoladex in the treatment of desmoid tumors. This review of the literature reveals that the biology of this disease is related to the endogenous hormonal environment and that estrogen receptors have been documented in desmoid tumors. Thirty-five cases are identified where endocrine agents have been employed, with a response rate of 51%. Furthermore, tumors may respond to second-line hormonal therapy after failing to respond to initial endocrine treatment. Endocrine treatments have also been used in other disorders of fibroblastic origin. The authors recommend that endocrine treatment be employed in inoperable desmoid tumors or where there has been postsurgical recurrence. In addition, the role for endocrine therapy in other soft tissue neoplasms should be determined.\r"

  ".W": "The role of ATP-regulated K+ channels in protecting the myocardium against ischemia/reperfusion damage was explored using glibenclamide and pinacidil to block and activate the channels, respectively. Electrical and mechanical activity of arterially perfused guinea pig right ventricular walls was recorded simultaneously via an intracellular microelectrode and a force transducer. The preparations were subjected to either 1) 20 minutes of no-flow ischemia with or without glibenclamide (1 and 10 microM) followed by reperfusion, or 2) 30 minutes of no-flow ischemia with or without pinacidil (1 and 10 microM) followed by reperfusion. No-flow ischemia for 20 minutes produced changes in electrical and mechanical activity that were completely reversed on reperfusion; resting membrane potential declined by 13 +/- 1.2 mV, action potential duration at 90% repolarization (APD90) decreased by 62%, and developed tension fell by greater than 95%, but resting tension did not change significantly. Glibenclamide (10 microM) had no effect on activity during normal perfusion, but during ischemia, resting membrane potential fell slightly further (17 +/- 1.8 mV) and APD90 declined by only 24%. Developed tension declined more slowly and to a lesser extent, but resting tension rose significantly between 10 and 20 minutes of ischemia. Reperfusion of glibenclamide-treated tissues elicited arrhythmias (extrasystoles and tachycardia), and the preparations failed to recover mechanical function. Glibenclamide at 1 microM produced qualitatively similar effects, albeit less severe. After 30 minutes of no-flow ischemia in untreated tissues, resting tension increased by approximately 130% during the no-flow period. Reperfusion caused arrhythmias (extrasystoles, tachyarrhythmias, and fibrillation) and failed to restore resting or developed tension to preischemic levels. Pinacidil at 1 microM did not affect electrical or contractile function, but at 10 microM it had a negative inotropic effect, decreasing APD90 and developed tension by 5% and 18%, respectively. Both concentrations of the drug caused a faster and greater decline in APD90 during the no-flow period. Resting tension did not change during 30 minutes of no-flow ischemia in the presence of pinacidil, and reperfusion led to 85% and complete recovery of electrical and mechanical activity at 1 and 10 microM, respectively. The data indicate that glibenclamide enhances whereas pinacidil reduces myocardial damage caused by ischemia/reperfusion. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that activation of ATP-regulated K+ channels during ischemia is an important adaptive mechanism for protecting the myocardium when blood flow to the tissue is compromised.\r"

  ".W": "Isolated bovine coronary arteries were treated with 10 mM diethyldithiocarbamate (DETCA) for 30 minutes to deplete the cytosolic ZnCu form of superoxide dismutase (SOD). This treatment completely inhibited the endothelium- and cGMP-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine (mediated via the endothelium-derived relaxing factor, which is thought to be nitric oxide) without significantly inhibiting endothelium-dependent relaxation to arachidonic acid (mediated by prostaglandins). DETCA treatment of endothelial cells cultured from the coronary arteries inhibited bradykinin-elicited release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor, which was detected by bioassay on an isolated rabbit aorta in the presence of extracellular SOD. DETCA also inhibited cGMP-associated relaxations to nitric oxide and to vasodilators thought to function via the generation of this mediator (nitroglycerin and nitroprusside), but cAMP-associated relaxations to isoproterenol and papaverine were not altered. The inhibitory effects of DETCA against the relaxation to nitroprusside and nitroglycerin were attenuated by severe hypoxia. DETCA treatment of isolated coronary arterial smooth muscle or cultured endothelial cells produced an increase of chemiluminescence elicited in the presence of lucigenin, a detector of superoxide anion generation. The addition of SOD markedly attenuated the effects of DETCA treatment on arterial relaxation and chemiluminescence. Therefore, control of cellular superoxide anion levels by endogenous SOD appears needed for the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor and relaxation of vascular smooth muscle to nitrovasodilators mediated via cGMP in the bovine coronary artery, but SOD is not critical for other endothelium-dependent or cAMP-associated relaxant mechanisms.\r"

  ".U": "91339246\r", 
  ".W": "The mechanism of reactive hyperemia remains unknown. We hypothesized that reactive hyperemia was related to the opening of ATP-sensitive potassium channels during coronary occlusion. The resulting hyperpolarization of the smooth muscle cell plasma membrane might reduce calcium influx through voltage-dependent calcium channels and result in relaxation of smooth muscle tone and vasodilation. In eight open-chest, anesthetized dogs, 30-second coronary occlusions resulted in an average flow debt repayment of 200 +/- 41%. After low-dose (0.8 mumol/min) and high-dose (3.7 mumol/min) infusion of intracoronary glibenclamide, flow debt repayment fell to 76 +/- 14% and 50 +/- 8%, respectively (p less than 0.05 compared with control for both). The decline in flow debt repayment was due to a significant reduction both in maximum coronary conductance during reactive hyperemia and in its duration. In addition, there was a significant decline in the sensitivity of the coronary circulation to adenosine-induced vasodilation after glibenclamide. While more variable, there was no overall change in the sensitivity of the coronary vasculature to acetylcholine-induced vasodilation after glibenclamide. We conclude that reactive hyperemia is determined in a large part by the ATP-sensitive potassium channel, probably through its effect on membrane potential and voltage-sensitive calcium channels. Because reactive hyperemia was never fully abolished at the highest doses of glibenclamide tested, it is possible that additional mechanisms are involved in the genesis of this complex phenomenon.\r"

  ".W": "Sulfonylurea derivatives glibenclamide and tolbutamide are selective blockers of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels. However, their ability to prevent cellular K+ loss and shortening of action potential duration during ischemia or hypoxia in the intact heart is modest compared with their efficacy at blocking KATP channels in excised membrane patches. In the isolated arterially perfused rabbit interventricular septum, the increase in unidirectional K+ efflux and shortening of action potential duration during substrate-free hypoxia were effectively blocked by glibenclamide, but only by very high concentrations (100 microM); during hypoxia with glucose present, glibenclamide was only partially effective at reducing K+ loss. During total global ischemia (10 minutes), up to 100 microM glibenclamide or 1 mM tolbutamide attenuated shortening of action potential duration but only reduced [K+]0 accumulation by a maximum of 32 +/- 6%. In isolated patch-clamped guinea pig ventricular myocytes in which the whole-cell ATP-sensitive K+ current was activated by exposure to the metabolic inhibitors, glibenclamide (up to 100 microM) and tolbutamide (10 mM) were only partially effective at blocking the whole-cell ATP-sensitive K+ current (maximum block, 51 +/- 10% and 50 +/- 9%, respectively), especially when ADP was included in the patch electrode solution. In inside-out membrane patches excised from these myocytes, glibenclamide blocked unitary currents through KATP channels with a Kd of 0.5 microM and a Hill coefficient of 0.5 in the absence of ADP at the cytosolic membrane surface, but block was incomplete when 100 microM ADP (+2 mM free Mg2+) was present. ADP had a similar effect on block of KATP channels by tolbutamide. These findings suggest that free cytosolic [ADP], which rises rapidly to the 100 microM range during early myocardial ischemia and hypoxia, may account for the limited efficacy of sulfonylureas at blocking ischemic and hypoxic cellular K+ loss under these conditions.\r"

Ang II has also been shown to transiently increase spontaneous beating behavior in these cells. In this study we seek to identify the molecular mechanism underlying this rapid (3-5-minute) desensitization. Time-course studies on the accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphates indicate that the loss in functional responsiveness correlates with reduced efficacy of Ang II to activate the phosphoinositide path. Binding studies with 125I-Ang II revealed that there was no change in surface receptor binding capacity during the time in which desensitization developed. Normal phosphoinositide and functional responses are observed when desensitized cells are treated with probes that activate the cardiac phosphoinositide pathway at discrete steps. These studies reveal that the functional status of the major components of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway, including G proteins, phospholipase C, and protein kinase C (PKC), are normal during maintained Ang II desensitization. To study the potential role of PKC in Ang II desensitization, the cells are treated with TPA for 24 hours, which downregulates PKC activity. PKC-depleted cells rapidly desensitize after Ang II application. We conclude that the selective Ang II-evoked biochemical/functional desensitization involves inhibition at the level of the receptor, rather than at a component downstream in the path, and that this process is independent of PKC and loss of surface binding capacity.\r"

Seventy-two-hour FD rats displayed the expected 80% reduction in hypothalamic preproGRF mRNA. Upon refeeding, levels were normalized in rats refed NF, CF, or FF diets. In contrast, preproGRF mRNA in rats refed a PF diet was similar to that in 72-h FD rats. Rats refed a PF diet failed to gain weight and consumed less food than animals refed NF, CF, or FF diets. However, the lack of the GRF response to the PF diet was due to protein deprivation rather than caloric restriction, since hypothalamic preproGRF mRNA returned to 66% of Fed values in rats refed an equivalent amount (grams per day) of a NF diet. In 72-h FD rats refed isocaloric diets containing 4%, 8%, or 12% protein, preproGRF mRNA was restored to Fed values in a protein concentration-dependent manner being completely restored by the 12% diet. A lack of dietary protein was sufficient to regulate hypothalamic preproGRF mRNA since feeding rats a PF diet without prior food deprivation resulted in 70% reduction in preproGRF mRNA, whereas CF and FF diets were without effect. These data indicate that decreased hypothalamic preproGRF mRNA expression in 72-h FD rats occurs as a result of dietary protein deprivation.\r"

Kidneys were rendered nonfiltering using low perfusion pressures (70 mm Hg) and a hyperoncotic perfusate (100 g/liter BSA). Under these conditions, differences in perfusion pressure were less than 9 mm Hg between control and PTH-treated kidneys over the 50 min of perfusion. In the absence of PTH, renin release was inversely correlated with ionized calcium (Ca2+) concentration, with the highest release of renin noted with 1 mM EGTA and no added calcium. Also, verapamil treatment markedly elevated renin release, even in the presence of 2 mM Ca2+. In contrast, renin secretion was strongly depressed by 20 nM BAY-K8644 in the perfusate. In medium containing normal calcium concentrations (1 mM Ca2+), rat PTH(1-34) induced a 2-fold greater renin accumulation than in the control, non-PTH-treated kidneys. Isoproterenol induced a 5-fold stimulation under the same conditions. In the 0 Ca2+/1 mM EGTA perfusion, PTH did not elevate renin secretion. Renin release in response to PTH in 2 mM Ca2+ was similar to that observed in the 1 mM Ca2+ perfusion. PTH also reversed the effects of BAY-K8644 to suppress renin release. In verapamil-treated kidneys, PTH failed to stimulate renin release. These results indicate that PTH stimulates renin release by a process independent of the baroreceptors and macula densa. The Ca2+ modulation of PTH-induced renin release is consistent with the reported ability of PTH to block calcium channels and relax vascular smooth muscle.\r"

  ".W": "The nuclear protooncogenes have been implicated in the coordinate regulation of gene expression during cell proliferation and differentiation. Previous work has shown that LH and human h CG as well as several growth factors including epidermal growth factor (EGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), transforming growth factor-beta, and insulin-like growth factor-I play a role in Leydig cell differentiated functions. To evaluate the possibility that protooncogenes mediate long term effects of these factors, their action on the levels of c-fos, c-jun, jun-B, and c-myc messenger (m) RNAs was studied. hCG (10(-9) M) produced a time-dependent increase in c-fos (9-fold), jun-B (18-fold) and c-myc (5-fold) mRNA levels but did not affect c-jun. The concentration of hCG required for half-maximal stimulation (ED50 = 7 +/- 4 x 10(-12) M) was similar to that required to induce half-maximal testosterone production. At optimal concentrations, the effects of EGF and bFGF on c-fos and jun-B mRNAs were lower than those induced by hCG, but their effects on c-myc mRNA were higher. In addition, they stimulated c-jun. Moreover, EGF and bFGF potentiated the effects of hCG on c-fos and jun-B, whereas hCG potentiated the action of growth factors on c-jun. Transforming growth factor-beta increased only jun-B mRNA, whereas insulin-like growth factor I increased c-fos, jun-B, and c-myc but less effectively than hCG. Lastly, the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate increased the level of the four protooncogene mRNAs, and its effects on c-fos and c-myc were significantly higher than those produced by hCG. These data indicate that the regulation of protooncogene mRNAs in normal Leydig cells is multifactorial. They also show differential responsiveness of the members of the Jun family to several factors. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the Fos and Jun families of regulatory proteins could play a role in mediating long term responses to the complex array of hormones and growth factors to which Leydig cells are exposed in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Treatment of pituitary GH4C1 cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF) caused up to a 60% reduction in the amount of [3H]MeTRH bound to specific TRH receptors. The effects of EGF were first detectable after a 2-h incubation and maximal by 24-72 h. EGF elicited a half-maximal response at 0.03 nM. Equilibrium binding analysis was performed on intact cells that had been incubated with or without 10 nM EGF for 96 h. EGF decreased the apparent number of TRH receptors (maximum binding = 0.36 vs. 0.58 pmol/mg protein for EGF-treated and control cells, respectively) without altering the apparent affinity (dissociation constant = 6.4 vs. 7.4 nM). The effects of EGF on TRH receptors were reversible. When EGF was removed from the medium, TRH receptors returned to control levels within 48 h. To assess whether the reduction of TRH receptors was functionally important, the ability of TRH to stimulate phospholipid turnover was measured in cells with a normal complement of TRH receptors and in cells that had been treated with EGF for 72 h to reduce TRH receptor density. EGF significantly blunted the ability of TRH to stimulate release of inositol phosphates from metabolically labeled cells. TRH increased inositol monophosphate accumulation 6.3-fold in control cultures and 2.0-fold in EGF-treated cells. These data show that EGF regulates the concentration of TRH receptors on pituitary GH4C1 cells and the responsiveness of the cells to TRH.\r"
