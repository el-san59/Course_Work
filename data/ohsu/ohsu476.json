  ".W": "A retrospective study was performed to evaluate the effect of recipient-donor trephine disparity on refractive error and corneal curvature post-suture removal in keratoconus. A double running suture technique was used and donor corneas were trephined from the endothelial side. When keratoconus patients with 0.25-mm larger donor than recipient trephines were compared with keratoconus patients with the same size recipient and donor trephines, a statistically significant increase in the mean keratometer value (45.4 and 43.8 diopters [D], respectively; P = 0.03) and increase in myopic spherical equivalent (-3.5 and -1.8 D, respectively; P = 0.03) was found. When keratoconus patients were compared with phakic Fuchs' dystrophy patients (both groups had 0.25-mm oversize donor trephines), the keratoconus group had a statistically significantly higher myopic spherical equivalent (-3.5 and -1.4 D, respectively; P = 0.03) despite only a 0.7-D difference in mean keratometer value which was not statistically significant (45.4 and 44.7 D, respectively). This study supports the hypothesis that the degree of post-penetrating keratoplasty myopia in patients with keratoconus can be decreased by reducing recipient-donor trephine disparity.\r"

Fundus photographs are taken to provide documentation of the anatomic status of eyes proposed for entry and are graded at an independent Reading Center. This article describes the protocol for photographic documentation of PVR as a continuum of increasing pathology, in which the pathology may only be present in the anterior retina, and the retina is usually highly elevated. In a validity and reliability study, agreement between photographic and clinical observation within one step was obtained for 88% of the eyes; intra- and inter-observer agreement within one step was 85 and 80%, respectively. Differences between the surgeon's grade and the Reading Center's were caused about equally by disagreement regarding extent of fixed folds and width of the funnel. Rarely did peripheral folds not visible in the photographs appear to be the sole explanation of the disagreement. Differences among readers were concerned mainly with differentiation of true full-thickness fixed folds from folds due to simple redundancy of the detached retina. These results demonstrate that complicated retinal detachment (RD) can be photographically documented and independently assessed.\r"

  ".W": "The development of tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of chronically administered delta (delta) and mu (mu) agonists was examined in vivo in rats using a protocol of alternated preferential activations of delta and mu receptors. This was accomplished by alternated chronic administrations of the relatively delta- and mu-selective agonists DADLE ([D-Ala2, D-Leu5]-enkephalin) and morphine sulfate (MSO4), respectively. Specifically, the agonists were given as 3 sequential 6 day cycles: (1) osmotic pump infusions of DADLE into the lumbar intrathecal space; (2) followed by intraperitoneal injections of MSO4; (3) followed again by intrathecal DADLE infusions. Following each cycle, the agonists' antinociceptive activities were measured using the tail-flick test of nociception. These were compared to their baseline (i.e., drug-naive) activities as a measure of tolerances. In a separate experiment the same total intrathecal dose of DADLE was infused chronically over twelve days without an interposed dose of MSO4. In the alternated agonist experiment, DADLE's antinociceptive ED50 value was increased by 10.4-fold, then reverted to only a 1.5-fold change from baseline and was subsequently shifted to a 13.7-fold increase over baseline. After cycle 2 with MSO4 a significant recovery from DADLE tolerance was noted as compared to that following cycle 1: 1.5- versus 10.4-fold, respectively. Furthermore, the interposition of a cycle of MSO4 between two cycles of DADLE resulted in a much lesser degree of tolerance for DADLE following cycle 3 (12 days of non-continuous DADLE infusion) than was noted after the 12 day continuous DADLE intrathecal infusion (13.7- versus 25.0-fold tolerance, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

No clinical or parasitologic relapses were seen in patients of both groups. Mild adverse effects to spiramycin were observed in 2 patients (10%). Spiramycin appeared to hasten clinical recovery and decrease the duration of oocyst excretion in immunocompetent children with diarrheal illness caused by Cryptosporidium.\r"

Standardization of allergens will provide even better results in the diagnosis and treatment of allergic rhinitis in the future. Success in an individual patient depends on appropriate application. Immunotherapy should be reserved for patients who have allergy to airborne allergens, have significant symptoms after exposure to them, have sensitivity that has been proven by a skin or in vitro test, and cannot avoid the allergen or control symptoms with drugs. Thus, allergy shots are generally not used for allergy to pet dander or food. Immunotherapy is begun with a very dilute concentration of allergen, which is gradually increased to the maximum dose that is safely tolerated. The interval between shots is then increased gradually to once a month. Duration of treatment is usually 3 years in children and longer in adults. Treatment usually fails if the patient cannot free the environment of large amounts of known allergens, if the allergen was not correctly determined during initial evaluation, or if the allergen dose is inadequate. The patient must have realistic expectations: Allergy shots often do not totally eliminate symptoms, and improvement takes time.\r"

Hair loss has many possible causes, such as systemic diseases, infections, toxic agents, and hormone imbalances. Treatment of the underlying disorder alleviates the shedding of hair. Balding may also be a normal physiologic occurrence in women taking oral contraceptives or after parturition and in men with male pattern baldness. The latter can be treated topically with progesterone or minoxidil. Minoxidil has been studied extensively and has been shown to improve balding at the vertex of the scalp, particularly in young men who have only begun to lose hair. Cases of more extensive male pattern baldness and baldness secondary to scarring can be treated effectively with surgical procedures.\r"

Results indicate that port-wine hemangiomas do not necessarily have different perfusion than normal skin but respond less vigorously to heat challenges. Cooling showed no uniform response by port-wine hemangioma vessels, while injection with Xylocaine plus epinephrine resulted in a markedly decreased perfusion and vasoconstriction contrary to previously held theories.

From 3 to 5 weeks, the entire substance of the tendon becomes filled with collagen-synthesizing cells.

  ".U": "89221589\r", 
  ".W": "Although amiodarone is a highly effective antiarrhythmic agent, it has a high incidence of side effects, some of which can be serious or even lethal. With close monitoring, side effects can be found in essentially all patients, but fortunately most of these are mild and well tolerated. Furthermore, many will respond to dosage reduction in a relatively short period of time, ie, days to weeks, which is remarkable considering the long period of time amiodarone has been shown to persist in tissues. There is reasonable evidence that toxicity, particularly the early toxic manifestations with large loading dosages, can be favorably modified by reducing the dosage. Similarly, reducing the maintenance dosage will, in most instances, reduce or eliminate most toxic manifestations. The mechanisms of toxic effects are uncertain, but suggestive evidence exists for and against both an immunologic reaction and an intracellular lysosomal lipoidosis. Principles of use of amiodarone should include individualizing administration of dosages for each patient due to the unusual pharmacokinetic properties of this drug and continuous long-term attempts at using the lowest effective dosage. There are no definite tests that predict amiodarone efficacy or toxicity, but the serum level can be used as a rough guide of absorption and distribution in the attempt to minimize the maintenance dosage. No guidelines regarding screening tests for toxicity can be made at this time since great variability in these tests has been reported, and no evidence exists for their benefit in preventing adverse effects to amiodarone. However, follow-up testing at the intervals noted in the package insert are reasonable and important. The possibility of interactions with drugs already reported and with others not yet reported should always be kept in mind, and appropriate monitoring for clinical evidence of toxicity due to the concomitantly used drugs should be undertaken. Amiodarone can have a tremendous beneficial effect in the proper circumstances, but it is a drug that should command utmost respect because of its side effects and requires constant vigilance from any physician wishing to use it.\r"

  ".W": "Amiodarone blocks the action of thyroid hormone by the inhibition of 5'-deiodinase which reduces production of T3 in peripheral tissues and possibly by blocking nuclear binding of T3. Since the drug inhibits peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, many patients taking amiodarone have abnormal thyroid function studies (increased T4 and rT3; decreased T3) despite being euthyroid. Treatment of patients with amiodarone generates an iodine excess, which contributes greatly to the significant incidence of altered thyroid status in this population. The diagnosis of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can be difficult. However, using the overall clinical picture and the tolerance limits of hormone levels determined for patients remaining euthyroid on amiodarone therapy, the accurate diagnosis of clinically significant thyroid dysfunction can almost always be made. To screen for thyroid disease, thyroid function should be assessed before initiating therapy, semiannually during therapy or whenever clinical features of thyroid dysfunction occur. Subclinical hypothyroidism as denoted by modest increases in TSH levels do not require treatment or the discontinuation of amiodarone therapy. An appreciation of the mechanism of the interaction between amiodarone and thyroid hormone metabolism allows the clinician to recognize thyroid dysfunction at an early stage and initiate appropriate therapy, thereby minimizing the morbidity associated with forms of amiodarone toxicity.\r"

Each offers the potential for modification using different types of antianginal drugs operating to alter regional O2 demands, improve regional perfusion, or both, leading to reduced ischemia and increased contractile function in the ischemic zone. Evidence is presented for matching of regional subendocardial myocardial blood flow and flow per beat with regional myocardial contraction at various levels of ischemia at rest, during steady-state exercise, and after antianginal drugs, signifying a particularly important role for heart rate control. In addition to reducing myocardial O2 demand per minute, beta-blockers and bradycardic drugs cause improvement of absolute subendocardial blood flow and particularly flow per beat by producing vasoconstriction in the epicardial region of the ischemic zone, with improvement of transmural blood flow distribution. Vasodilator drugs can act at several locations to increase regional blood flow and also to decrease O2 demands. A recruitable vasodilator reserve has been shown to exist during exercise-induced ischemia either in native resistance vessels, collateral channels, or both, which appears to be due at least in part to reduction of increased alpha-adrenergic constrictor tone to the coronary vessels during exercise, even in the presence of severe ischemia. The potential for additive effects using combinations of bradycardic and vasodilating agents are described within a framework relating regional subendocardial blood flow to regional systolic contraction. The experimental findings described suggest some potential new directions for antianginal therapy and, along with recent clinical observations, support the use of combinations of antianginal agents that act by different mechanisms.\r"

In developed countries where prevalence of tuberculosis is low, it will take at least 30-50 years to eliminate the disease because of exacerbation by individuals who acquire infection abroad. In developing countries, 2-3 million deaths will occur among the estimated 4 million new smear-positive and 4 million new smear-negative and extrapulmonary cases of tuberculosis. The low cure rate with standard chemotherapy is the chief reason for failure of tuberculosis control in developing countries. The basic chemotherapeutic regimen (streptomycin for 2 months then a combination of isoniazid and thiacetazone for 12 months) does not achieve a high cure rate in developing countries. Under routine conditions the cure rate is high (90%) with an inexpensive 8-month regimen consisting of 2 months of strictly supervised daily administration of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and streptomycin and then 6 months of self-administration of a tablet containing both isoniazid and thiacetazone. A substantial decrease in the risk of tuberculous infection in developing countries is essential because of the increase in number of AIDS patients with tuberculosis. Vaccination alone, at least with the present vaccine, cannot substantially influence the epidemiologic situation but should be continued for children when its use is justified for prevention.\r"

The duration of short-course chemotherapy cannot be further reduced for smear-negative and culture-positive or smear-negative and culture-negative pulmonary tuberculosis or for extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Isoniazid has been demonstrated to be active as prophylactic therapy for tuberculosis at a daily dose of 300 mg (5-10 mg/kg in children) for 6-12 months.

It is now realized that the possibility of rapidly influencing the tuberculosis problem in these countries with the present control technologies has been overestimated. It is clear that bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination, even in places where a high efficacy was demonstrated, does not substantially influence the chain of transmission. Case management, including bacteriologic diagnosis and chemotherapy, is a complex technology. Although it is potentially effective for the reduction of mortality and the risk of infection, there are many difficulties for its efficient application in developing countries. Although there should be no hesitation in the application and full utilization of what is already known, a major thrust in research may generate ways of accelerating the control of tuberculosis in developing countries. Without new developments in technology for tuberculosis control, the goal of worldwide control has still a long way to go.\r"

With an increase in HIV infection in some developing countries, there has been a resurgence in tuberculosis, and concern has been raised about the indications, efficacy, and safety of bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination. Anecdotal reports of local reactions and disseminated disease have been described in HIV-infected children and adults. Ten HIV-infected infants, who received BCG vaccination within 2 months of birth, developed local lymphadenitis at 4-15 months. However, in one preliminary survey in Zaire, the rates of local lymphadenitis were equal in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children, and no dissemination has been observed to date. Until further information is known, BCG vaccinations should not be given to symptomatic HIV-infected individuals and should only be given to HIV-infected children who are asymptomatic and who reside in areas where tuberculosis is highly endemic and where the risk of tuberculosis may outweigh the potential complications of BCG immunization.\r"

An integrated view of the pathogenesis of tuberculosis has been constructed that combines studies from animal models and our understanding of the key events in the development of cavitary pulmonary tuberculosis in humans. This view, developed as a guide for further hypothesis testing, indicates that whether cavitary pulmonary tuberculosis develops by endogenous reactivation or by exogenous reinfection is determined solely by the route by which the tubercle bacillus reaches the apical-subapical region of the lung. It is in this region that the bacillus survives the cell-mediated immune response. This view of the pathogenesis of tuberculosis permits identification of the factors in a given geographic region that govern the probability of the development of cavitary pulmonary tuberculosis by one or the other pathway. Knowledge of these factors permits the identification of the appropriate strategies for tuberculosis control.\r"

Efficient methods of introducing DNA into Mycobacterium smegmatis protoplasts have been developed, and the construction of mycobacteriophage recombinant DNA vectors has been initiated. Novel Escherichia coli-Mycobacterium shuttle vectors, termed shuttle phasmids, have been constructed. These vectors were constructed by inserting E. coli cosmids into nonessential regions of mycobacteriophage DNAs. Shuttle phasmids are multifunctional vectors that replicate in E. coli as plasmids and replicate in mycobacteria as phage. The presence of the bacteriophage lambda cos sequences permits the use of the lambda in vitro packaging system for efficient cloning of additional genes into these vectors. Temperate shuttle phasmids have been constructed that can infect and lyse mycobacterial cells or lysogenize mycobacterial cells to stably integrate and express cloned DNA into mycobacterial genomes. Shuttle phasmids can be transduced into a wide variety of mycobacterial species and thus should permit the development of molecular genetic systems for the mycobacteria.\r"

Most mycobacteria are endowed with specific, highly antigenic glycolipids that are powerful for the serodiagnosis of individual mycobacterial infections: e.g., the phenolic glycolipids of Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium bovis, the glycopeptidolipids of the Mycobacterium avium complex, and the acylated trehalose-containing lipooligosaccharides of species such as Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium szulgai, and Mycobacterium malmoense. A search for analogous structures in Mycobacterium tuberculosis has revealed an antigenic diglycosyl diacylglycerol and the immunogenic phosphomannoinositides. Others have reported on the presence of a novel phenolic glycolipid in the Canetti strain of M. tuberculosis. The dominant carbohydrate-containing antigen of M. tuberculosis (responsible for the high-titer anti-arabinofuranosyl activity in tuberculous sera) is lipoarabinomannan, which has been purified in the native state from M. tuberculosis and shown to contain both phosphatidylinositol and phosphoinositol side-branches. The cell wall of M. tuberculosis--more precisely, the peptidoglycan skeleton--is a source of a few distinct, highly immunogenic protein antigens. The recognition, isolation, and characterization of these antigens will also be described.\r"

Such a strategy can provide important information on antigens important to protection. Genetic deletion or modification of these virulence factors provides insight into both the mechanisms of pathogenesis and the possibilities for the development of live attenuated vaccines. Alternatively, individual antigens identified as important for protection by antibodies and T cells or by studies of pathogenesis can be introduced into other live vaccine vectors to generate multivaccine vehicles.

  ".W": "Animal models used to evaluate the relative protective potency of a panel of tuberculosis vaccines have yielded dissimilar data. Moreover, it is not known which animal model predicts the protective potency of vaccines for humans. Accordingly, animal models should be developed on the basis of an understanding of the key events in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis in humans. Vaccines such as bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) appear to protect against tuberculosis by inhibiting the bacillemic phase of primary infection with virulent tubercle bacilli; therefore, such vaccines can be expected to provide protection against tuberculosis developing via the endogenous reactivation pathway but not against disease developing via the exogenous reinfection pathway. To protect against disease developing by the latter pathway, it would appear that new vaccines produced by recombinant DNA technology or through use of monoclonal antibody would have to inhibit the implantation of bacilli at the portal of entry in the lungs. Experience with BCG vaccine indicates that factors other than the inherent potency of the vaccine play a decisive role in the outcome of vaccine trials in humans. These same factors will probably influence field trials of any new generation of tuberculosis vaccines.\r"

This theory is based on limit criteria, derived from plasticity theory, which determine bounds within which the structure is mechanically stable and thereby enables the prediction of failure when these criteria are not satisfied. It is shown that theorems developed for the plastic analysis of masonry arches can be simply adapted for the spine. An analysis is performed of three postures and associated loads described in the literature. The forces and intradiscal pressures are calculated and shown to be in good agreement with published measurements. The results show that compressive stresses in the spine are not as high as was previously calculated and that the curvature of the spine is necessary for its load-bearing function. Preservation of the lumbar lordosis, in conjunction with intra-abdominal pressure, strengthens the spine and is crucial to protect the spine from injury when lifting heavy loads.\r"

All patients with neurologic deficits recovered without functional motor or sensory deficits. Of the 19 patients grafted, 18 showed roentgenographic evidence of fusion, and one went on to a pseudarthrosis. The average increase in kyphosis at the infection site was 3 degrees. In selected patients with pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis requiring surgical treatment, anterior debridement and primary bone grafting in conjunction with appropriate antibiotics is successful in treating the infection and promoting osseous fusion in a high percentage of cases.\r"

The objective was to examine the impact of multiple individual and work-related risk factors for low-back injury from hospital employee health records. Hospital workers include occupational groups historically regarded as being at high risk, particularly nurses and others involved in patient care. In terms of traditional risk factors, significant associations were found for history of low-back pain or \"slipped disc\" by self-report and for history of previous back injury. Working the day shift also was significant (odds ratio [OR] = 2.23, P less than 0.005). Marital status (single) approached significance (OR = 1.65, confidence interval [CI] = 0.091, 2.99), as did low body weight (OR = 1.47, Cl 0.70, 3.10). No significant association was found between cigarette smoking and low-back injury. Possible work site health promotion interventions to lower the risk of low-back injury in this population are suggested.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of endogenous pituitary and pancreatic beta-endorphins in the physiopathologic factors of acute pancreatitis and the effect of opiate antagonist naloxone in these conditions were studied. Pancreatitis was induced by the injection of 0.5 milligram per kilogram of autologous bile mixed with 10,000 units per kilogram of trypsin into the main duct after ligating the accessory duct. After the induction of acute pancreatitis, plasma beta-endorphin concentrations in systemic and portal blood and cardiovascular function were measured. Ten dogs (control group) were given an intravenous injection of 10 milliliters per kilogram per hour of lactate Ringer's solution one hour before the induction of acute pancreatitis. Six (naloxone group) received an intravenous bolus injection of 2 milligrams per kilogram of naloxone at one hour after the induction of acute pancreatitis and then an intravenous infusion of 2 milligrams per kilogram per hour of naloxone was given under the same conditions as for those in the control group. Beta-endorphin in systemic and portal venous blood in those in the control group increased significantly during the experiments. Beta-endorphin and adrenocorticotropin hormone in systemic venous blood both in the control and naloxone groups increased simultaneously. However, blood pressure, pulse pressure and cardiac output improved quickly after the bolus injection of naloxone and were well maintained during intravenous infusion of naloxone. Also, naloxone improved the survival time from acute pancreatitis and decreased plasma lactate concentrations. Our data show that beta-endorphin, released mainly from the pituitary gland and not from the pancreas, may have an important role in subsequent cardiovascular depression. Also the opiate antagonist naloxone may be effective in the treatment of acute pancreatitis.\r"

  ".W": "Although synchronous intrauterine and ectopic pregnancies associated with the use of clomiphene citrate for infertility are rare, the actual incidence might, in fact, be considerably higher than previously thought. The cornerstone for ruling out an extrauterine gestation is the presence of sonographic evidence of an intrauterine pregnancy, as the possibility of concomitant intrauterine and extrauterine gestation is perceived to be statistically rare. This has resulted in an unacceptably high incidence of negative ultrasound interpretations. During a recent 12 month period, four women treated with clomiphene citrate for infertility were diagnosed as having concomitant intrauterine and ectopic pregnancies. Three had pelvic sonograms that were erroneous for the extrauterine component. However, successful evacuation of the products of ectopic gestation was performed in each, despite an immediate preoperative false-negative ultrasound report. Three of the women delivered healthy normal infants at full term, and the fourth woman spontaneously aborted the products of the concomitant intrauterine gestation. All four did well postoperatively, and no gross complications were encountered. Reassessment of ultrasound diagnostic criteria and the use of more sensitive methods, such as endovaginal ultrasound in high risk patients, are indicated for any symptomatic patient using clomiphene citrate for infertility. Awareness of the prevalence of this entity and the limitations of ultrasound will lead to prompt intervention and improved survival rates.\r"

  ".W": "Coronary artery disease is a difficult clinical entity to manage, and all forms of current therapy are palliative in nature. Results from the large randomized studies have clearly demonstrated the superiority of surgical versus medical therapy in subsets of patients previously described herein. As patients with severely compromised ventricles are demonstrated to fare better with bypass procedures, the number of patients that should be operated upon continues to grow. With refinements in operative and perioperative care and increased use of the internal mammary artery as the bypass conduit, it is inevitable that more subgroups will be determined to be best managed by surgical revascularization. For the present time, medical treatment is preferred for the vast majority of patients who were shown by randomized trials not to benefit significantly from surgical intervention. However, caution must be used in excluding patients based on trial results that used surgical techniques and conduits that are ten years old. The role of angioplasty in the invasive treatment of ischemic cardiac disease is still in evolution. Although not yet proved by vigorous trials, it is a procedure that most likely will continue to be used in many clinical applications. The high rate of restenosis after angioplasty, which is a formidable problem, may be a factor that will limit the application of angioplasty to patients with acute myocardial infarction or to those who do not desire surgical intervention. The answers to these and other complex problems of patient management must await well-designed prospective trials comparing angioplastic with surgical revascularization. Clinical use of some of the experimental procedures mentioned is certain; the efficacy and role of these procedures in the treatment of ischemic cardiac disease must also be defined with future studies.\r"

  ".W": "Many aspects must be studied when considering theories of oncogenesis. Growth factors, the polypeptide hormones that are necessary for cell growth, and oncogenes, the genes that produce cancer, are only two aspects. Proto-oncogenes are found in normal cellular DNA and are believed to play regulatory roles in differentiation and development. Oncoviruses, mutation of DNA and chromosomal damage can activate proto-oncogenes and cause malignant change. Oncogenes can render transformed cells independent of growth factors. A cell can bypass the need for outside growth factors by producing the growth factor and its receptor, thereby using an autostimulatory impetus for growth. This is autocrine growth. An oncogene can also bypass the need for growth factors by activating or modifying growth factor receptors, or by stimulating intracellular events, such as tyrosine phosphorylation, both of which ultimately lead to cell division. The various mechanisms by which oncogenes act provide specific targets for treatment. Specific antigrowth factor or antireceptor antibodies or antagonists could interfere with autocrine regulation. Further research on the activation of oncogenes could provide valuable insight on regulation of the growth of tumors. Ultimately, the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of cellular transformation will be a key to the prevention and treatment of cancer.\r"

Its intraocular pressure lowering effect through enhancement of aqueous outflow is well documented. Clinically, this effect seems non-specific for laser characteristics, including wave form, wave length, burn location, clock hours treated, and even to some degree, laser power. The response is delayed in onset, diminishes over time, and in some cases can be renewed with retreatment. Laser photocoagulation of the trabecular meshwork focally destroys, but diffusely stimulates trabecular meshwork cells. Shape alterations in the trabecular meshwork after laser are likely to contribute to outflow enhancement only at very high levels of intraocular pressure. More likely, cellular stimulation activates a molecular biologic chain of events, perhaps within the trabecular extracellular matrix, that permits improved facility of aqueous outflow.\r"

In the two historic periods 1982-85 and 1985-86, sharing programs (Category I & II) and nonsharing programs (Category III) had similar graft survival. In the study period 1986-88, graft survival improved in Category I and II programs and was unchanged in Category III programs. Highly sensitized recipients in sharing programs had an incremental gain of 15.0%, patients receiving multiple grafts 12.6%. Grafts derived from local donors and transplants in less sensitized patients also were improved but for less obvious reasons. The implementation of this study was followed by a slight decrement in delayed graft function. It is our conclusion that early graft sharing can result in improved overall early graft survival.\r"

  ".W": "Although great strides have been made in clinical transplantation, infection remains a major problem. Critical to the understanding of the infectious disease problems of the present and the foreseeable future is the recognition that the risk of infection is largely related to the interaction of two factors: the net state of immunosuppression present and the epidemiologic exposures the individual patient encounters. It is now apparent that different immunosuppressive agents with comparable antirejection effects will have differing effects on infectious processes. This is perhaps best illustrated by comparing the effects of cyclosporin and antithymocyte globulin on a murine model of cytomegalovirus infection. Cyclosporin appears to have little ability to reactivate latent virus but has profound virus-promoting effects once replicating virus is present. In contrast, antithymocyte globulin has potent reactivating effects but little influence on replicating infection. Thus, the infectious disease problems observed will be affected by the timing, nature, dose, and duration of the various components of the immunosuppressive program. As far as epidemiologic exposures are concerned, there is increasing emphasis on nosocomial hazards, particularly those encountered at such common sites within the hospital as operating rooms and radiology suites. Viral infections remain the most important single infectious disease problem among transplant patients for the foreseeable future. Although immunoglobulin prophylaxis and ganciclovir therapy appear to hold promise for limiting the effects of cytomegalovirus infection, hepatitis virus infection remains a major issue. In addition, it is likely that HIV infection, particularly the clinical management of asymptomatic carriers of the virus, will have an increasing impact on clinical transplantation over the next decade.\r"

Only one patient died from a fatal hereditary disease. Graft survival was 100% at one year in all groups and at three years was 86% for Aza, 94% for CyA alone and 100% for CyA and steroids. Rejection episodes occurred in 50% of Aza patients versus 18% in the CyA groups. However 55% of CyA patients require anti-hypertensives versus 20% of Aza recipients, and 12% of CyA patients were switched because of drug toxicity. In a previous study of 36 Aza treated A-matched patients, five of eight losses occurred after the first 5 years--most related to long term effects of immunosuppression. We may have to wait for longer follow-up before drawing conclusions regarding the use of CyA in identically matched living related recipients.\r"

  ".W": "From May 1977 to April 1988, 88 patients receiving cadaveric kidney transplants were selected to receive Orthoclone (OKT3; 5 mg intravenous bolus) (n = 28) or Minnesota antilymphocyte globulin (MAG; 20 mg/kg/day) (n = 60) as the induction phase of a quadruple immunosuppressive protocol. The duration of treatment ranged from 5-16 days for OKT3 (mean, eight days) and 7-14 days for MAG (mean, nine days), as dictated by the post-operative recovery of renal function. All patients were followed for at least four months (maximum 16 months, mean 10 months). Of the 28 patients receiving OKT3, six (21%) had rejection episodes which wre reversed and did not reoccur. Two patients developed OKT3 antibody. Only one graft was lost to rejection. Of the 60 patients receiving MAG, 30 (50%) experienced a first rejection episode within the follow-up period; 15 of these had repeat rejections. Three allografts were subsequently lost in the MAG group. Renal function was significantly better in the OKT3 group. While both OKT3 and MAG were associated with excellent patient (98%) and graft (92%) survival, OKT3 was easier to administer with fewer rejection episodes. We conclude that OKT3 is superior to MAG as perioperative cytoreductive therapy following cadaveric kidney transplantation.\r"

All three occurred after acyclovir was stopped. Five of six evaluable seropositive patients (83%) who did not receive acyclovir prophylaxis suffered HSV infection. We conclude that low-dose oral acyclovir may be effective in the prevention of HSV infection during OKT3 treatment of seropositive patients.

All donor-recipient combinations were at least one-haplotype disparate and 21 were two-haplotype disparate. Presensitization was present in ten patients and attempts at desensitization were uniformly unsuccessful. Of the 151 nonpresensitized patients, transient sensitization occurred in 3% and permanent sensitization in 7%. Of 140 nonsensitized patients, 135 underwent renal transplantation from the specific blood donor and 56% have never experienced a rejection episode. The allograft survival rate at two years (93%) and seven years (87%) is significantly better (p less than .01) than our historical experience with one-haplotype living-related transplants at two years (68%) and seven years (59%). The low rate of sensitization (7%) has permitted almost all patients to undergo eventual renal transplantation from the specific blood donor. This and the low rate of early rejection (2%) argues for a modification of the immunologic response, perhaps by clonal deletion, rather than a selecting out process as the mechanism for improved allograft survival.\r"
