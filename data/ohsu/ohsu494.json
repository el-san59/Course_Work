This paper reviews the 61 survivors of nonpenetrating rupture of the free walls of the myocardium reported in the English-language literature. The chambers were involved in the following frequency: right atrium, 36; left atrium, 11; right ventricle, 12; and left ventricle, four. Most victims were young males, and 85% were involved in motor vehicle accidents. Seventy percent had an admission systolic blood pressure less than 80 mm Hg, 78% had distended neck veins or a central venous pressure greater than 20 cm H2O, 67% had a widened mediastinum on admission chest roentgenogram, and 48% had fractures of the bony thorax. More than one hour elapsed before initiation of repair in 59%. Forty-eight percent of the repairs were performed via a median sternotomy. Cardiopulmonary bypass was used in only 10%.\r"

  ".U": "89350239\r", 
  ".W": "The technique for implanting the homograft aortic valve is significantly more complex than that of either the bioprosthetic or mechanical valve. During development of the procedure, errors of technique were committed; a critical analysis of the learning experience is presented. In the initial 31 patients, the following problems were encountered: mitral stenosis secondary to inadequate debulking of the homograft (1 patient), prolapse of a single homograft leaflet necessitating valve replacement three days later (1 patient), incorrect homograft orientation with torsion in a calcified aorta necessitating subsequent replacement (1 patient), and aortic sinus perforation (thawing injury) (1 patient). In addition, another 4 patients had diastolic murmurs thought to be secondary to inadequate tension setting of the homograft commissural posts. From this experience, several important technical considerations for homograft replacement of the aortic valve were noted: use of interrupted subannular sutures; careful inspection for aortic perforation (thawing); extensive trimming of the homograft septum and mitral remnant; orientation of the homograft to the recipient aorta to obtain the best commissural and sinus alignment; selection of another type of valve if the size of the recipient annulus is greater than 27 mm; retention of the homograft sinus, which orients to the recipient non-coronary sinus (for a calcified aorta); and exaggerated tension on the homograft commissural posts before initiation of the second suture line. There has been 1 hospital death and no late deaths. Adherence to rigid principles of technique has resulted in no further valve replacements and no incidences of valvular leakage at early or late follow-up.\r"

Group I included the 72 patients (39.6%) who had undergone a previous cardiac operation or operations and group II, the 110 (60.4%) who had not. The mean age of the patients in group I was 52.1 +/- 8.1 years and in group II, 46.1 +/- 10.2 years (p less than 0.01). The incidence of ischemic heart disease was 86.1% in group I and 29.1% in group II (p less than 0.01). All patients received cyclosporine-based immunosuppression. More patients in group I than in group II required reoperation for bleeding after transplantation: 18 (25.0%) versus 9 (8.2%) (p less than 0.01). The actuarial 1-year and 3-year survival rates were 77.6% and 66.5%, respectively, for group I and 77.1% and 66.3%, respectively, for group II. Because both groups had similar survival rates, we believe that prior cardiac operation in heart transplant recipients does not compromise long-term survival.\r"

Nine patients were weaned from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. There were five (36%) early deaths and four (29%) late deaths. Cannulation sites included right carotid/jugular vessels, femoral artery and vein, and right atrium and aorta. In 4 patients, the neck vessels were repaired at decannulation. Five survivors had normal growth and neurodevelopmental evaluations at follow-up. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can be successfully used as biventricular support in patients with intractable low cardiac output syndrome after repair of congenital heart disease. Best results are obtained in patients who have several hours of stability after operation before initiation of support. Hemorrhagic complications are reduced and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes appear promising with right neck vessel cannulation and repair. No bleeding complications were observed in patients cannulated through the neck vessels.\r"

Ischemic (4 patients), dilated (4 patients), acute viral (1 patient), postpartum (1 patient), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (1 patient), along with a failed transplant (1 patient), were the causative factors of end-stage cardiomyopathy in these patients. All patients were candidates for orthotopic cardiac transplantation but sustained refractory cardiogenic shock (cardiac index less than 2 L/min/m2). Left VADs were placed in all patients; 7 also required right VADs. Four patients died of hemorrhagic complications less than 24 hours after VAD insertion. Ventricular assist device stabilization was successful in 8 patients and support ranged from eight hours to 64 days. Seven patients successfully underwent orthotopic cardiac transplantation. One died postoperatively of hemorrhagic complications, 6 were discharged from the hospital, and 1 patient died at 3 months of cytomegalovirus infection. Five patients are long-term survivors. The Pierce-Donachy VAD is an effective means for supporting critically ill patients with end-stage cardiomyopathy and cardiogenic shock before orthotopic cardiac transplantation. Death is related to hemorrhagic, rather than infectious or thromboembolic, complications. Patients successfully stabilized with the VAD can undergo orthotopic cardiac transplantation with acceptable mortality and morbidity rates.\r"

PGI2-A was added in a dose of 300 micrograms/L to the potassium cardioplegic solution. Postoperatively, peak levels of the myocardial-specific isoenzyme of creatine kinase (MB-CK) were compared for the PGI2 group and a control group (n = 65). In patients 1 year of age or older (n = 32 and 49 for the PGI2 and control groups, respectively), the MB-CK level was significantly lower in the PGI2 group only when compared between the subgroups with an aortic cross-clamp time of 120 minutes or more (n = 9 and 10; MB-CK level, 35.2 +/- 15.6 vs 68.3 +/- 32.4 IU/L;p less than 0.05). In patients less than 1 year of age, in whom aortic cross-clamp times were generally less than 120 minutes, the MB-CK level was also lower in the PGI2-A group than in the control group (n = 13 and 16; MB-CK level, 33.6 +/- 14.3 vs 61.6 +/- 36.3 IU/L;p less than 0.05). Infants less than 6 months of age (n = 18) underwent ultrastructural assessment of left ventricular myocardial biopsy specimens, and the PGI2-A group showed better results in mitochondrial and intracellular edema scores. This clinical trial showed beneficial effects of PGI2-A used with crystalloid potassium cardioplegia in infants and children.\r"

All patients were adequately ventilated with each mode. During prebypass and postbypass periods, the group with high-frequency ventilation had significantly lower peak airway pressures (p = 0.0001) and mean airway pressure (p less than 0.05). There were, however, no significant differences in right ventricular performance or pulmonary vascular resistance between the two modes of ventilation. No significant differences in other cardiovascular and respiratory variables were noted. High-frequency positive-pressure ventilation, with the advantage of quieter operating conditions and improved surgical access, can be safely applied when meticulous operation or hemostasis is required or during dissection of the internal mammary artery.\r"

The results of these tests are often complementary in making a diagnosis. To be most cost-effective, the frequency of screening can be adjusted to the degree of risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

Gallbladder examinations were performed by abdominal real-time ultrasonography for the detection of gallstones. Initial sonography was performed prior to dieting and only those subjects in whom initial sonograms showed no gallstones or sludge were included in the study. Repeated sonography was performed at 4-week intervals for 8 weeks while they remained on a 2100-kJ/d diet. Initial weight of subjects prior to dieting averaged 105.9 +/- 3.8 kg (162% of ideal body weight) and decreased to 89.4 +/- 3.2 kg (137.3% of ideal body weight) after 8 weeks of dieting. Sonography performed after 4 weeks of dieting revealed new-onset gallbladder sludge in 1 subject and gallstones in 4 subjects. After 8 weeks of dieting sludge was detected in 3 subjects and gallstones in 13 (25.5%). In contrast, none of the nondieting subjects developed any detectable gallbladder abnormalities. During the dieting period, 1 of 51 subjects developed symptoms of biliary colic, necessitating cholecystectomy. On cessation of dieting with reinstitution of normal feeding, 2 additional subjects with stones developed symptoms severe enough to require cholecystectomy. In all 3 cases, cholesterol gallstones were recovered at the time of surgery. Eleven of the 13 patients with gallstones were followed up for 6 months after discontinuation of the diet. Besides the 3 undergoing cholecystectomy, 4 subjects had gallstones on follow-up ultrasound examination, while sonographically detectable gallstones had disappeared in 4 subjects. We conclude that this form of weight-reduction dieting predisposes to the development of gallstones and that gallstone formation is a risk of this type of prolonged calorie restriction. Dissolution or evacuation of gallstones may occur with resumption of a normal diet.\r"

When follow-up was terminated, 459 patients (9%) had died. Overall, the leading cause of death was pneumonia, followed by other subsequent unintentional injuries and suicides. The highest ratios of actual to expected deaths were for septicemia, pulmonary emboli, and pneumonia. Pneumonia was the leading cause of death among quadriplegics and persons at least 55 years of age, while among paraplegics and persons who were less than 55 years of age, subsequent unintentional injuries and suicides were the leading causes of death. While there is conclusive evidence that mortality rates for spinal-cord injured persons have declined dramatically since the end of World War II, many cause-specific mortality rates remain substantially above normal.\r"

Thirty-two evaluable patients had alpha 2-antiplasmin activity levels of less than 50% of normal (defined as severe deficiency), and 35 patients had levels between 50% and 75% of normal (mild deficiency). Records of these patients and of 32 patients who had normal levels were reviewed. Most patients with severe alpha 2-antiplasmin deficiency had either liver disease or disseminated intravascular coagulation and/or fibrinolysis, or both. There was a high incidence of severe alpha 2-antiplasmin deficiency among patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Five patients with pathologic bleeding had no identifiable coagulation abnormalities other than alpha 2-antiplasmin deficiency. The group with severe alpha 2-antiplasmin deficiency had a significantly higher incidence of life-threatening or fatal bleeding and the most striking laboratory evidence of hyperfibrinolysis. Using the presence of severe alpha 2-antiplasmin deficiency as an indication for therapy, epsilon-aminocaproic acid treatment was associated with cessation of life-threatening bleeding in 8 of 11 patients.\r"

Nonetheless, animal studies performed by several independent groups have shown the solvent to induce fat deposition, vacuolar degeneration, and centrilobular necrosis, changes similar to those seen after exposure to carbon tetrachloride, albeit of a much reduced magnitude, in animals exposed to the agent. Four patients with fatty liver disease whose work entailed substantial exposure to this agent were seen at the University of Pittsburgh (Pa). Based on this clinical experience, we believe that 1,1,1-trichloroethane should be reconsidered as an agent with potential hepatotoxicity in man.\r"

Of participants with a high nicotine-dependence score, those allotted to the nicotine group rather than to the placebo group were 13 times more likely to be abstaining at the 2-year follow-up. Use of nicotine polacrilex gum, therefore, can substantially aid in stopping smoking, particularly among highly dependent smokers.\r"

In 19 published trials, this form of lytic therapy has been shown to be associated with greater venous valvular and venous patency preservation, implying better short-term and long-term outcome. Unfortunately, closer examination of the data reveals several flaws, including overreliance on venogram data and lack of adequate long-term follow-up. Streptokinase, as well as other forms of lytic therapy, has not gained widespread acceptance in the treatment of acute deep venous thrombosis, and, until better data become available, such reluctance seems justified.\r"

  ".W": "Unlike the well-established hypotriglyceridemic effect of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, the influence of more clinically tolerable doses on lipoproteins and apolipoproteins is less well characterized. Therefore, we compared the relative effects of modest doses of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation with a corn oil control on lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins in a randomized, double-blind controlled crossover study. Eight hypertriglyceridemic subjects ingested 4.6 g/d of omega-3 fatty acids or 5.4 g/d of linoleic acid (supplied as corn oil) for 8 weeks, then crossed over to the alternative encapsulated oil for another 8 weeks, following an interposed 4-week wash-out period. Compared with the corn oil control, fish oil supplementation caused a significant reduction in triglyceride levels by a mean of 2.21 mmol/L and increased the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol by a mean of 0.13 mmol/L, associated with a significant rise in the high-density lipoprotein 3 subfraction. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) apolipoprotein B levels by a mean of 0.246 g/L. Compared with corn oil, no statistically significant change for LDL cholesterol or other apolipoprotein levels occurred, although LDL cholesterol showed a mild elevation. These data suggest that unlike large doses of omega-3 fatty acids, the hypotriglyceridemic effect of modest amounts of encapsulated fish oil supplementation is unaccompanied by favorable changes in LDL cholesterol or LDL apolipoprotein B levels; the potential therapeutic usefulness of modest doses of dietary fish oil for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia, therefore, may be limited.\r"

Beginning at 2 weeks post hatch, line 200 chickens develop intense lymphocytic infiltration of the comb and dorsal neck skin. To further characterize the nature of these cellular infiltrates, weekly serial skin biopsy specimens from line 200 and control birds were examined using hematoxylin and eosin staining and indirect immunofluorescence with a library of mouse anti-chicken monoclonal antibodies specific for lymphocyte markers. In situ staining performed on serial skin sections revealed the presence of large groups of T cells beginning at 2 weeks of age. Further characterization of these infiltrates demonstrated the presence of both T helper and T cytotoxic/suppressor cells with a mean +/- SD T4:T8 ratio of 1.44 +/- 0.29 by 4 weeks of age. As the lesions progressed, the infiltrates also contained distinct groups of B cells as characterized by MUI 36. In addition, the lesions were strongly positive for B-L (Ia) antigen, which was noted on B cells, monocytes/macrophages, activated T cells, and fibroblasts. The skin sections were negative for 2 different macrophage monoclonal antibodies at all time-points. Upon extraction from affected skin, 42.0 +/- 13.06% (mean +/- SD) of these cells were positive for B-L, 35.10 +/- 6.51% were T cells, and 31.25 +/- 3.14% were recognized by MUI 36. Although positive staining for IgG was not found in these extracted cells, 7% of the isolated cells were positive for surface IgM.\r"

  ".W": "The development of reactive arthritis, a sterile inflammatory polyarthropathy that primarily affects HLA-B27 positive individuals, has been associated with previous enteric infections caused by various gram-negative bacteria. The possibility that a common bacterial epitope triggers the disease was investigated by screening a panel of documented arthritogenic Shigella strains as well as 2 epidemic-associated nonarthritogenic Shigella controls. A 2-Md plasmid specific to the arthritogenic strains was identified and sequenced. The plasmid encodes a number of small peptides that could be related to the development of reactive arthritis. Within 1 of these is a stretch of 5 consecutive amino acids, inferred from the DNA sequence and contained within an open reading frame, that is homologous to amino acid residues 71-75 of the polymorphic region of the alpha 1 domain of HLA-B27. The data indicate that there is a bacterial plasmid common to arthritogenic Shigella strains that may play a role in triggering reactive arthritis. The finding that this plasmid encodes an epitope shared with HLA-B27 suggests that molecular mimicry may play a role in the induction of this disease.\r"

Although a significant proportion of synoviocytes in normal and osteoarthritic synovial membranes expressed the leukocyte common antigen and CR3, very few expressed the p150,95 molecule. In contrast, p150,95 was more evident in rheumatoid synovial membranes. Expression of this molecule was strongest in synovial membranes with a prominent macrophage infiltrate and accumulation of mononuclear phagocytes at the joint surface; p150,95 was also present on interdigitating cells in lymphoid collections. The patterns of expression suggest that these leukocyte adhesion molecules may be important in the diapedesis of mononuclear phagocytes into and through inflamed synovial membranes, as well as in cellular interactions within rheumatoid synovial membranes.\r"

Additionally, direct bipolar cautery of bleeders is afforded while use of the observer tube or video allows for excellent teaching.

  ".W": "We studied the disposition of sufentanil in 10 patients undergoing renal transplantation, and compared the data with those from eight healthy anaesthetized patients undergoing lower abdominal surgery. Patients received sufentanil 2.5 micrograms kg-1 as part of a balanced anaesthetic technique. Central venous blood samples were collected at intervals up to 600 min, and plasma sufentanil concentrations assayed by radioimmunoassay. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from drug concentration-time profiles by extended least squares non-linear regression analysis (ELSFIT) and by a model independent (MI) approach using AUC and its first moment, AUMC. There were no differences (based on MI results) between the two groups for elimination half-life (T1/2 beta) (renal failure: 188 min; anaesthetized controls: 195 min), clearance (CI) (1030 and 1093 ml min-1) and apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) (223.0 and 215.3 litre). Sufentanil binding to plasma proteins was 91.4% in the renal patients and 92.2% in the healthy group (ns). Comparison of kinetic methods showed significant correlation of the individual estimates for T1/2 beta, CI and Vss (P less than 0.01). The mean absolute differences between methods were: T1/2 beta 2.7 min (95% limits: -26.2 to 31.5), CI 36.5 ml min-1 (-5.5 to 78.4), Vss -18.4 litre (-47.7 to 10.9). When the mean estimate for the two methods [ELSFIT + MI)/2) was compared with the difference, there was no correlation for the estimates of CI and Vss+. MI tended to overestimate clearance and underestimate volume of distribution. There was a significant relationship between estimates for elimination half-life, with a slope greater than zero.\r"

A highly significant correlation between the symptoms of urgency and urge incontinence and the maximum amplitude of bladder neck activity was found with the new test. The correlation of the maximum deflection at rest with the symptom of urgency was significantly better than the best correlation found with the cystometric measurements. The values for sensitivity and specificity of cystometry for the detection of an abnormality associated with urgency were 58% and 92% respectively, and the corresponding values for a positive BNEC test (as defined by a maximum deflection at rest greater than 13 microA) were 100% and 77%.\r"

The IOP was measured during the first three hours after laser treatment, at 24 hours, and at two months. Forty-six patients (92%) in the placebo group had an immediate rise of IOP. The mean rise (SD) for these patients was 8.6 (7.1) mmHg. Fifteen patients (30%) in this group had an IOP rise of greater than 10 mmHg. Nine patients (18%) receiving acetazolamide had an immediate rise of IOP. The mean rise for these patients was 4.3 (3.1) mmHg, and no patient had an increase in IOP of greater than 8 mmHg.

All three sutures incited inflammatory cells and fibroblastic activity with collagen formation at two and four weeks. Residual scar tracks were observed at six weeks (two weeks after suture removal) also. Human specimens showed similar types of scar formation from the sutures. It was apparent that all three sutures create fibrotic scars along their tracks sufficient to correct, at least temporarily, involutional entropion.\r"

Significant advances made in understanding mechanisms underlying protection against malaria should not obscure the fact that the data are far from complete. More knowledge is needed about the influence of the erythrocyte cytoskeleton on invasion and growth of parasites as well as the potential role of phospholipids, erythrocyte enzymes other than G6PD, or other metabolic products.

The role of colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) in the pathophysiology of MPD was investigated by measuring circulating CSF-1 levels and examining their relationship to disease phenotype. Serum CSF-1 concentrations, measured by radioimmunoassay, were elevated in all MPD phenotypes. CSF-1 levels differed significantly between groups of patients with essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, and postpolycythemic or agnogenic myeloid metaplasia (in ascending order). CSF-1 serum levels were positively correlated with spleen size and the degree of peripheral bone marrow extension, determined by scintigraphy using a macrophage-seeking isotope. There was no correlation between CSF-1 concentration and circulating levels of erythrocytes, neutrophils or platelets, or the presence of bone marrow fibrosis. Elevated serum CSF-1 levels appear to be associated with an expanded monocyte/macrophage population in MPD. In view of the known cooperativity between CSF-1 and other growth factors in regulating hematopoiesis, the finding of increased serum CSF-1 concentrations and its association with myeloid metaplasia and bone marrow extension may indicate a pathophysiologic role for CSF-1 in determining the phenotypic expression of MPD.\r"

Patients greater than or equal to 1 year and less than or equal to 21 years of age who attained complete remission were stratified by conventional risk criteria and immunophenotype and then randomized to receive continuation therapy with either of two regimens of intensive chemotherapy, designated S (standard) and SAM (standard plus intermediate-dose methotrexate, 1 g/m2 every 8 weeks). The proportions of subjects achieving complete remission in the two phenotypically defined subgroups were identical, 96%. At a median follow-up time of 42 months, the overall probability of 4-year event-free survival (+/- SE) was 63% +/- 2% (pre-B = 51% +/- 5% and early pre-B = 66% +/- 3%).

In a univariate Cox regression analysis of potentially important prognostic factors, the pre-B immunophenotype was significantly related to a poorer outcome, as were other recognized biologic and clinical features (eg, pseudodiploidy, older age, male sex, black race, and a higher WBC). It retained its prognostic strength in a multivariate model based on age, WBC, ploidy, and sex. The risk of failure at any point in the clinical course of a child with the pre-B immunophenotype was 1.8 times as great as that in a patient lacking this feature but otherwise having an equivalent risk status. It should be stressed that the predictive value of any of the significant characteristics identified in this study could diminish in the context of another, more effective treatment program. Nevertheless, our major conclusion, that children with pre-B ALL fare worse than those with early pre-B disease in a contemporary clinical trial has implications for stratified randomization of patients and the design of risk-specific treatment protocols.\r"

  ".W": "Previous work with continuously cultured multiple myeloma lines suggested that cytokine production by tumor cells may mediate some of the medical complications of this disease. To further investigate this issue, we assayed freshly obtained bone marrow (BM) cells from myeloma patients for the in vitro production of cytokines and the presence of cytokine RNA. Production of cytokine protein was assessed by bioassays with the aid of specific neutralizing anticytokine antibodies. These assays detected interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) secretion by myeloma BM cells, which was significantly greater than secretion from similarly processed BM cells of control individuals. In contrast, lymphotoxin and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production could not be detected. The levels of IL-1 and TNF produced in vitro peaked at 24 hours of culture and correlated with stage and the presence (or absence) of extensive osteolytic bone disease. Northern blot analysis demonstrated the presence of IL-1 beta and TNF RNA in uncultured myeloma BM cells but no detectable IL-1 alpha or lymphotoxin RNA. In addition, the amount of cytokine RNA correlated with protein production, being significantly greater in patients' BM cells than in control marrow. These data suggest a role for IL-1 beta and/or TNF in the pathophysiology of multiple myeloma and argue against a role for lymphotoxin or IL-2.\r"

  ".U": "89352865\r", 
  ".W": "A fibroblast-mediated gene delivery method was used for the endogenous expression of human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) as a model for cytokine supplement therapy. Human G-CSF cDNA was inserted into the plasmid expression vector BMGNeo, which contains a partial sequence of bovine papilloma virus and a selectable marker gene. The recombinant plasmid (BMGNeo-GCSF) was transfected into NIH/3T3 fibroblasts by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method, and the stably transformed cells were isolated by G418 selection. An appropriate clone producing a large amount of G-CSF was selected by enzyme immunoassay of the culture supernatants. Southern blot analysis suggested that the BMGNeo-GCSF plasmid replicated mainly as an episome, and Northern blot analysis demonstrated the high expression of human G-CSF mRNA in the cells. After the implantation of the G-CSF-producing fibroblasts into nude mice, prominent neutrophilia, about 30-fold the level of normal control, was observed within seven days. Moreover, the number of hematopoietic progenitor cells in spleen remarkably increased for all cell lineages in these mice. To regulate the in vivo expression of G-CSF, we designed a subcutaneous diffusion chamber apparatus that contains the G-CSF-producing fibroblasts. The leukocytosis (neutrophilia) induced in C3H mice after embedding the device quickly disappeared after ethanol treatment of the chamber. Furthermore, reinjection of the G-CSF-producing fibroblasts into the chamber caused a second neutrophilia.\r"

  ".W": "A variety of studies have shown that osteoclasts originate from bone marrow, but their exact progenitors and differentiation pathway remain unclear. The treatment of mice with a high dose of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) results in an enrichment for primitive hematopoietic progenitors; using this procedure, we prepared a new class of murine hematopoietic colonies that had very high secondary plating efficiencies in vitro. When spleen cells from mice pretreated in vivo with 5-FU were cultured in the presence of methylcellulose medium containing recombinant interleukin-3 (rIL-3), small colonies consisting of blast cells with little sign of differentiation developed on day 7 of culture. We lifted these blast colonies, pooled them, and replated them as secondary methylcellulose cultures in the presence of rIL-3 and erythropoietin. Approximately 60% of the cells formed colonies comprising various combinations of neutrophils, macrophages, eosinophils, mast cells, megakaryocytes, and erythroblasts. We replated such blast cells into microtiter wells and cultured them in the presence of rIL-3 (100 U/mL) or recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (100 U/mL) plus 1.25(OH)2D3 (10(-7) mol/L). Multinucleated cells appeared from day 14 of culture and approximately 100 giant cells per well were scored on day 21 of culture. Parathyroid hormone (1 U/mL) also induced the multinucleated cell formation. May-Grunwald-Giemsa staining revealed the large cells containing many nuclei in their cytoplasm, which is characteristic of bone-resorbing cells or osteoclasts. These cells showed a tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity. Calcitonin caused a striking shape change in these cells and suppressed the formation of multinucleated cells. Moreover, electron microscopy shows that these cells were able to resorb fetal calvariae. In the presence of r granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, r macrophage-colony stimulating factor, or r interleukin-6 plus 1.25(OH)2D3, formation of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells was lower compared with the support of rIL-3 or rGM-CSF. Mature macrophages collected from colonies did not form the multinucleated cells as described above, even in the presence of rIL-3 and 1.25(OH)2D3. Moreover, to exclude the possibility that osteoclasts generated from non-blast cells, we performed a cloning experiment from one isolated blast cell and demonstrated that single cells differentiate into osteoclasts or macrophages in the presence of rIL-3 with or without 1.25(OH)2D3. This system will provide a useful model for further analysis of osteoclast formation in vitro.\r"

To determine the optimal way of abrogating the neutropenia caused by melphalan, patients received G-CSF and melphalan on several schedules. The half-life (t 1/2) of elimination of G-CSF was in the range 1.3 to 4.2 hours and was prolonged at higher doses, suggesting that one clearance mechanism becomes saturated at doses greater than 10 micrograms/kg, When a continuous subcutaneous (SC) infusion was administered for five days, a rapid reduction in serum G-CSF levels occurred during the last two days of the infusion, indicating that an additional clearance mechanism was induced. When a continuous infusion of G-CSF was administered after melphalan, serum G-CSF levels remained constant for a longer period of time but did decrease during the second phase of a biphasic neutrophil response. In another clinical trial, G-CSF was administered after high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT). In these patients, the G-CSF levels did not decrease while the patients were neutropenic. These results show that increased neutrophil levels are associated with increased clearance of G-CSF. This may be one of the negative feedback mechanisms involved in maintaining neutrophil homeostasis in normal and disease states.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to test whether recombinant human G-CSF (rh G-CSF) affects hematopoiesis in normal dogs and, if so, to test the effects of G-CSF in dogs given otherwise lethal total body irradiation (TBI). Rh G-CSF given subcutaneously at 10 or 100 micrograms/kg/d for 14 days to two normal dogs increased peripheral blood neutrophils eight to tenfold and monocytes four to sixfold above controls. Lymphocyte counts remained unchanged at the lower dose and increased threefold at the higher dose of rh G-CSF. No significant changes were observed in eosinophil, platelet, reticulocyte, or hematocrit levels. After 2 weeks of treatment with rh G-CSF, bone marrow displayed myeloid hyperplasia and left-shifted granulocytopoiesis. After discontinuation of rh G-CSF, peripheral leukocyte counts returned to control levels within three days. Five dogs administered 400 cGy TBI at 10 cGy/min from two opposing 60Co sources and no marrow infusion or growth factor, all developed profound pancytopenia and died between 17 and 23 days after TBI with infections secondary to marrow aplasia. Four of five dogs treated within two hours after 400 cGy TBI with 100 micrograms rh G-CSF/kg/d subcutaneously twice a day for 21 days showed complete and sustained endogenous hematopoietic recovery. In contrast, five dogs irradiated with 400 cGy TBI and treated with 100 micrograms rh G-CSF/kg/d starting on day 7 after TBI, all died between days 17 and 20 after TBI with infections secondary to marrow aplasia. Rh G-CSF, if administered shortly after irradiation, can reverse the otherwise lethal myelosuppressive effect of radiation exposure.\r"

Thirty-three patients (77%) had localized herpes zoster, and ten patients (23%) had varicella. Cutaneous dissemination developed in 15% of patients and probable visceral dissemination developed in 5%. Overall morbidity was 25% and included scarring, alopecia, postherpetic neuralgia, and neurologic dysfunction. There were no deaths from VZV infection. The majority of patients (79%) were treated with intravenous (IV) acyclovir. The only significant risk factor associated with VZV infection was the underlying disease. VZV infection occurred most frequently in patients with Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (46%) as compared with patients with leukemia (23%) or solid tumors (9%) (P less than .002). The frequency of VZV infection in ABMT patients appears to be comparable to that reported for allogeneic BMT patients and other immunocompromised patients.\r"

The actuarial survival after onset of chronic GVHD in 85 patients was 42% (95%Cl = 29%, 54%) at 10 years. Baseline characteristics present at the onset of chronic GVHD (before therapy) in 85 patients were reviewed to determine which were risk factors for death. In a multivariate proportional hazards analysis, three baseline factors emerged as independent predictors of death: progressive presentation (chronic GVHD following acute GVHD without resolution of acute GVHD; hazard ratio of 4.1, 95% Cl = 2.1 to 7.8), lichenoid changes on skin histology (hazard ratio of 2.2, 95% Cl = 1.1 to 4.3), and elevation of serum bilirubin greater than 1.2 mg/dL (hazard ratio = 2.1, 95% Cl = 1.1 to 4.1). Actuarial survival of 23 chronic GVHD patients with none of these risk factors was 70% at 6 years (95% Cl = 38%, 88%). Thirty-eight patients with one of these risk factors had a projected 6-year survival of 43% (95% Cl = 21%, 63%). The 29 patients with any combination of two or more of these factors had a projected 6-year survival of only 20% (95% Cl = 8%, 37%). Identification of baseline risk factors should facilitate design of trials of chronic GVHD therapies and assignment of high-risk patients to more aggressive innovative therapeutic regimens.\r"

  ".W": "The optimum marrow ablative regimen for preparing recipients of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has not been established. gamma-Irradiation, but not busulfan, produces a characteristic microvascular injury pattern which results in depressed capacity of normal lymphocytes to localize into the lymph nodes of syngeneic murine BMT recipients. Since peripheral lymph nodes are important sites for initiation and amplification of immune responses, the preparative regimen might delay recovery of regionally compartmentalized immune functions after BMT. We evaluated the effects of busulfan and gamma-irradiation on the phenotypic and functional reconstitution of helper T-cell function within the peripheral lymph nodes of BMT recipients. Both marrow ablative regimens caused a protracted delay in regeneration of peripheral lymph node CD4+ T cells. Specific helper T-cell functions, such as contact hypersensitivity and alloantigen responses, remained significantly depressed in the lymph nodes of irradiated mice for prolonged periods (up to 60 weeks). These responses recovered more rapidly in busulfan-treated BMT recipients. In contrast, the capacity of peripheral lymph node T cells to provide \"help\" for antigen-specific immunoglobulin production was only transiently depressed by either preparative regimen. Our experiments confirm the hypothesis that the marrow ablative regimen, particularly gamma-irradiation, may contribute to the period of immunodeficiency which follows BMT. The pattern of immune recovery observed suggests that preparative total body irradiation (TBI) may selectively depress the regional recovery of the TH1 [interleukin-2 (IL-2) and gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN) secreting] lymphocyte subset.\r"

We describe the use of real-time orbital ultrasound scanning to measure the medial rectus muscle width in 20 patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy and 21 normal individuals. The normal reference interval (to 2 SDs) was 1.75 to 4.07 mm. Significantly (p less than 0.001; Mann Whitney U-test) larger values were observed in the patients compared with controls, and there was good correlation between medial rectus width and a clinical index of disease severity in individual eyes (p less than 0.001; Spearman rank correlation coefficient). Comparison of the medial rectus measurements obtained using orbital computed tomography and ultrasound showed positive correlation at the p less than 0.001 significance level. Computed tomographic medial rectus measurements also correlated with horizontal and vertical muscle indices for that orbit. We suggest that real-time ultrasound of medial rectus width, using widely available equipment, provides an accurate, simple and non-invasive means of evaluating the orbits of patients with Graves' disease. Repeated measurements may be of value in identifying patients at high risk of visual failure, and in following prospectively the orbital response to therapy in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy.\r"

No statistically significant differences in the incidence and severity of side-effects were found between the 132 outpatients and 129 inpatient controls. Nine outpatients had to be kept in hospital at the end of a 4-h observation period and a further two outpatients were re-admitted to hospital because of severe side-effects. The current study was compared with a preceding study of identical design, already published, in which 200 patients underwent lumbar radiculography with 10 ml iohexol (240 mgI/ml). No statistically significant differences in the incidence and severity of side-effects between the two contrast media were evident up to 24 h after the examination. In the period between 24 h and 7 days, the incidence and severity of headache, nausea and dizziness were all significantly greater in the iopamidol group. Although outpatient radiculography can be performed safely with both contrast media, the higher incidence of delayed side-effects in the iopamidol patients prompts the authors to express a preference for iohexol for intrathecal use. The increased incidence of adverse reactions in female patients and the literature comparing iopamidol and iohexol for myelography are discussed.\r"

The clearance rate of renal calculi smaller than 1 cm was 81%, while that of calculi larger than 3 cm was 80% (mean clearance 77.5%). Lithotripsy of ureteric calculi following retrograde manipulation to a renal site resulted in 94.4% clearance compared with 39% for those treated at a ureteric site; 93% of 684 lithotripsy treatments were either painless or caused only mild pain. Our experience with imaging and treating urinary calculi with the EDAP LT.01 lithotripter has been excellent. Patients are treated effectively and inexpensively as out-patients without analgesia or sedation.\r"

A possible infective aetiology was sought by culture of bladder tissue, catheter and midstream specimens of urine, and urethral swabs by methods capable of detecting fastidious bacteria as well as aerobic pathogens. All bladder biopsies showed the histological appearances usually associated with interstitial cystitis, and bacteria were isolated from the catheter specimens and/or bladder biopsies of 12 patients. Eight of these isolates were fastidious bacteria, Gardnerella vaginalis (6) and Lactobacillus sp. (2). Fastidious bacteria were isolated from the midstream specimen of urine (MSU) and/or urethral swab of 6 other patients. The correlation of the histological and bacteriological findings supports the hypothesis of an infective aetiology and suggests that the so-called urethral syndrome and interstitial cystitis may be the earlier and later stages of the same disease process. The importance of early diagnosis of infection in these patients is emphasised.\r"

The principles of complete excision of non-viable tissue with removal of foreign material, leaving the wound open, and delayed primary closure of skin are vitally important. A major part of the surgical approach is wound assessment and the formation of an operative plan. The extent and ease of the operation depends on the site, age and type of wound. Attention to the technique of wound excision avoids septic complications and permits skin closure when the first dressing is removed. Wounds may need re-excision at a later date. Modification of surgical management is necessary when certain difficult areas are wounded and when the patient presents after many days or has suffered inappropriate first aid.\r"

Continued study of the immunological basis of ulcerative colitis is therefore required to solve the problem of pouchitis.\r"

An antiscirrhous carcinoma monoclonal antibody (MAb) S202 was used in a rapid immunostaining procedure to identify the limit of tumour invasion during surgery in samples obtained from the resection margins in 37 cases of Borrmann type 4 gastric cancer. In two instances, conventional cytological diagnosis using haematoxylin and eosin staining was negative, and in another it was inconclusive; whereas by the rapid immunostaining method single cells stained darkly, indicating malignancy. In two specimens, a positive diagnosis could be made by both methods, but immunostaining of these sections served to highlight the adenocarcinoma cells against the inflammatory background: further resection was performed. This technique enables clear recognition of the infiltrating tumour cells in the frozen sections of resected specimens. The rapid immunostaining method using MAb S202 allowed accurate and rapid determination of the limit of tumour extension at the surgical margin during surgery.\r"

The line of division is the main scissure, giving the right hemiliver (segments 5-8) and the left hemiliver (segments 2-4). Segment 1 (caudate lobe) has to be resected. The vessels are divided between the two grafts: the vena cava remains on the right; on the left, the left hepatic vein is sutured into the vena cava of the recipient, which is retained intact. The left graft retains only the left branch of the portal vein, the bile duct and the hepatic artery. The right graft retains the portal trunk, the common bile duct and the right branch of the hepatic artery. This procedure was used for emergency grafting of two patients with fulminant hepatitis when only one donor was available. Both recipients recovered from coma and regained normal liver function. However, both died from causes not specifically related to the operative technique, one from multiple organ failure on the 20th day and the other from diffuse cytomegalovirus infection on the 45th day.\r"

Abdominal pain and gastrointestinal bleeding were the commonest symptoms. Barium enema and angiography were misleading, the former in confusing polypoid lipomas and protruberant ileocaecal valves with carcinoma, the latter in misinterpreting fatty tissue vasculature as angiodysplasia in three patients. Most lesions were in the right side of the colon, and many were treated by limited colectomy as if for carcinoma or angiodysplasia. No patient has died as a result of their disease. Awareness of the possibility of colonic lipomas and knowledge of the normal ileocaecal valve anatomy are of importance to radiologists and endoscopists, particularly now that angiography is localizing the smaller fatty lesions.\r"

Recurrent buttonhole hernias were found in two patients, in both of whom a single row of sutures had been used. This reherniation was due to insufficient anchorage of the patch to the fascia.

All three patients were found to have non-viable caecum at laparotomy and were treated by right hemicolectomy. Primary ileocolic anastomosis was performed in one patient, who recovered following a stormy postoperative course owing to sepsis. Two patients underwent formation of an ileostomy with distal mucous fistula and each recovered with minimal postoperative complications; secondary anastomosis was performed electively in both cases.

  ".W": "In women over the age of 35 years, an accurate diagnosis of breast cancer can be made in over 95 per cent of patients using a 'triple assessment' system collating information from clinical examination, mammography, sonomammography, and fine-needle aspiration cytology. These methods have not been specifically evaluated in women aged 35 years or less, hence a study was undertaken on 30 such patients. Clinical examination was unreliable in predicting malignancy with a sensitivity of only 37 per cent. Thirty per cent of patients presented with a lump which had the clinical features of a fibroadenoma. Radiological methods were less sensitive in detecting malignancy in this age group than in older patients. The sensitivity of aspiration cytology was 78 per cent which was higher than that for breast cancer at all ages. Histology showed that there were fewer low grade tumours and fewer scirrhous tumours in this age group than in a control group of women aged over 35 years. This study indicates that cytological confirmation of apparently benign focal breast lesions in young women is essential, especially when these are managed conservatively.\r"

  ".W": "The authors have reviewed 106 cases of primary gastrointestinal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (GI-NHL) treated at the Institut Gustave-Roussy (IGR), France, between 1975 and 1986. The occurrence was 55 in the stomach, 26 in the small intestine, ten ileocecal, seven in the large intestine, and eight patients had multiple involvement. Patients were clinically staged according to the Ann Arbor staging system using the modification of Musshoff for Stage IIE. All histologic material of the 106 patients were reviewed and graded according to the Working Formulation (WF) and the Kiel classifications. Most patients received combination chemotherapy as part or all of their primary treatment program (95 patients, 90%). Seventy five patients (71%) had a multimodality treatment. The overall 5-year survival rate was 60%. Sixteen variables were tested by univariate analyses for prognostic influence on survival. Of these, only clinical stage (P less than 0.001), the achievement of initial complete remission (CR) (P less than 0.001), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (P = 0.01), mesenteric involvement (P = 0.03), and serosal infiltration (P = 0.05) were significant prognostic factors. Important variables were tested by a multivariate analysis using the Cox model taking into account different treatment modalities. Only three variables entered the regression analysis at a significant level: clinical stage (P = 0.02), surgical resection (P = 0.03), and histologic grade (Kiel) (P = 0.04). When the achievement of initial CR was introduced into the model, it was the most significant variable (P less than 0.001) whereas all other variables became nonsignificant except for the histologic grade (Kiel) (P = 0.004). Based on results of the multivariate analyses we propose two prognostic classifications of patients: one at the initial evaluation depending on clinical stage, surgical resectability, and histologic grade (Kiel); the other at the end of primary treatment depending on the achievement or not of CR and the histologic grade.\r"

These cell lines grew in suspension with or without forming clumps of cells. SP-50B was morphologically similar to the common Epstein-Barr (EB) virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines and was positive for EB virus nuclear antigen (EBNA), whereas SP-53 closely resembled the patient's lymphoma cells and was negative for EBNA. Both cell lines expressed the same phenotypic markers as original lymphoma cells (CpIg+, SmIg+, OKIa1+, Leu12+) and possessed t(11;14)(q13;q32) chromosome translocation. These results indicate that although morphologically different, SP-50B and SP-53 were both derived from patient's lymphoma cells. The long-term cultivation of EBNA-positive and EBNA-negative B-cell lymphoma lines from a single donor has not been previously reported. These cell lines would provide useful tools for studying the oncogenic role of EB virus and bcl-1 oncogene that is located on chromosome 11q13.\r"

To date, correlation of the presence of these features in ESB with clinical outcome has not been performed. The authors investigated the clinical relevance of positivity to antibodies against neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and Leu 7 (HNK 1) using the avidin-biotin complex technique in 40 cases of ESB seen at St. Jude (Memphis, TN) during the period 1968 to 1986. Twenty-three cases (58%) were positive for NSE and/or Leu 7. The median disease-free survival of patients with localized tumors and NSE and/or Leu 7 positivity was 3.8 years compared to a median disease-free survival of 1.6 years for those without these markers and localized disease. Using the log-rank test, a statistically significant difference was shown in these two groups of patients (P = 0.049). The authors conclude that in this relatively small series ESB commonly expresses NSE and/or Leu 7 and that the presence of these markers is of no prognostic significance overall, but that in patients with localized ESB the presence of NSE and/or Leu 7 by immunostaining may be a favorable prognostic indicator.\r"

The results showed that ferritin-positive tumor cells were present in every case. The quantity of cellular ferritin in well-differentiated histiocytes was higher than that in atypical histiocytes. Double labeling showed that ferritin and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin might be located either in one tumor cell or in separate cells. Our data suggest that ferritin may be a tumor associated antigen in malignant histiocytosis, playing a regulatory role for tumor cell differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "Both image and flow DNA cytometry were performed in isolated nuclei from paraffin-embedded tumor tissue of patients with small cell carcinoma of the lung (SCCL). In 14 patients tissue was obtained by surgery from the primary tumor. From 14 patients tissue was taken by autopsy. From two patients tissue obtained by both surgery and later autopsy were available. From the autopsy patients tissue was taken only from the primary tumor (n = 6), from a metastasis (n = 1) and from the primary tumor and distant metastases (n = 7). Twelve of the tumors obtained by surgery were diploid, and two multiploid (two stem lines present). This was found both with image and flow cytometry. The group of patients could clearly be subdivided in short survivors (less than 9 months, n = 6) and long survivors (greater than 16 months, n = 8); since in both groups one multiploid and the remainder diploid cases were present, ploidy did not seem to be a good prognosticator for survival. In most (n = 26) of the tissues measured from the autopsy patients, again, a good correlation between image and flow DNA cytometry was obtained, the histograms being either (near) diploid or multiploid. In six cases, however, flow cytometry showed multiploidy whereas image showed aneuploidy (one single peak clearly deviating from diploidy). This discrepancy is caused because normal diploid (nonneoplastic) cells in the preparations could not be discarded from the flow cytometry measurements. Using the image cytometry data of the primary tumors, five diploid, three aneuploid, and four multiploid tumors were found. In five of the seven patients of whom tissue was obtained from the primary tumor and multiple metastases, differences between the histograms were found, mostly showing two malignant cell populations in one tissue and only one of them in another. Of one of the two patients of whom tissue was obtained by surgery and later autopsy, a change in histogram pattern was observed. It is concluded that although there is a high similarity between image and flow DNA cytometry, for an optimal interpretation of the histogram pattern, image measurements are more reliable. Ploidy determination does not seem to be of use in prediction of survival, and care should be taken in interpreting DNA histograms of metastases in SCCL patients because of the variability in histogram pattern.\r"

One hundred sixty-six patients were assigned to either an oncology home care group (OHC) that received care from oncology home care nurses, a standard home care group (SHC) that received care from regular home care nurses, or an office care group (OC) that received whatever care they needed except for home care. Patients were entered into the study 2 months after diagnosis and followed for 6 months. Patients were interviewed at 6-week intervals across five occasions. At the end of the study, there were no differences in pain, mood disturbance, and concerns among the three groups. There were significant differences in symptom distress, enforced social dependency, and health perceptions. The two home nursing care groups had less distress and greater independence 6 weeks longer than the office care group. In addition, the two home nursing care groups steadily reported worse health perceptions over time. Thus, it was remarkable that the office care group, which indicated more symptom distress and social dependency with time, also indicated perceptions of improved health with time. These results suggest that home nursing care assists patients with forestalling distress from symptoms and maintaining their independence longer in comparison to no home nursing care. Home care may also include assisting patients in acknowledging the reality of their situation.\r"

In some patients the variation was small, but in others it was as much as 300%. To discover its cause, five patients were investigated prospectively with continuous right atrial pressure monitoring during coronary flow measurement and respiratory manoeuvres. In three, ice-cold saline was injected into the right atrium during respiratory manoeuvres while coronary sinus temperature was monitored continuously and the position of the catheter was monitored fluoroscopically. The cause was found to be movement of the catheter such that thermistor approached the right atrium, and the variation was therefore spurious. We report these findings and discuss other known causes of inaccurate coronary flow measurement using the thermodilution technique.\r"

  ".W": "The role of preseason conditioning in injury prevention was discussed in this article. Evidence was presented that conditioning involving flexibility, cardiovascular work, and resistance training contributed to the structural integrity of the joint as well as the muscle-tendon unit. The effect these physiologic adaptions had on the prevention of injuries was investigated. Epidemiological studies were reviewed to ascertain this effect and were found to carry methodological problems that made conclusions questionable. Further epidemiological research was recommended with suggested design modifications to produce valid conclusions. Even though there is a lack of empirical evidence relating preseason conditioning to injury prevention, many studies were reviewed that showed a clear connection between many specific training techniques that are used to prevent injury. The role of flexibility and resistance training in the prevention of hamstring strains was particularly emphasized. The application of preseason conditioning toward preventing injury was then discussed. It was recommended that a preseason evaluation precede this conditioning so that the sports medicine evaluator could assess the athlete's level of conditioning. Based on the strengths and weaknesses of this evaluation a preseason conditioning program could be devised. The elements of such a program were then presented with a summary of preseason training techniques. Specificity of testing and training was recommended. The closer that athletes come to testing and training for the muscle function needed in their sport, the greater the chance of increased performance. In addition, a more specific and adequate muscle function was thought to help in the prevention of injuries.\r"

Arthritides such as osteo, rheumatoid, septic, and lyme as well as the hematologic disorders of multiple myeloma, lymphomas, leukemia, hemophilia, and Gaucher's disease can all present with shoulder pain. Thoracic outlet syndrome, scalene syndrome, supra-scapular nerve syndrome, and quadrilateral space syndrome comprise a group of nerve compression syndromes that are becoming more apparent as our diagnostic skills improve. Yet, the most pervasive disorders in the young athlete are due to lack of shoulder stability. By understanding the delicate balance in normal shoulder between mobility and stability, the clinician is better able to conceptualize the etiology and progression of the problem, and design the optimal treatment program.\r"

Prophylactic braces are used in an attempt to prevent injury to a normal area while engaged in athletic endeavors. Braces are available for the neck, back, and both the upper and lower extremities. There are many commercially available braces that are quite useful and effective. It is still controversial whether or not prophylactic braces prevent knee injuries in contact sports. However, prophylactic braces and/or taping have proved to be quite effective in preventing ankle injuries. It should always be kept in mind, however, whether one is using rehabilitative, functional, or prophylactic braces, that a good rehabilitation program and conditioning should be instituted along with their use to strengthen the involved area and prevent further injuries.\r"

Conventional radiographs remain the primary imaging examination. Specialized radiographic projections will often provide additional pertinent information. A fluoroscopic examination or conventional tomography may provide a cost-effective method of clarifying subtle post-traumatic changes. The use of the more sophisticated and costly imaging procedures should be reserved for those cases in which a diagnosis cannot be made with simpler technology. CT scanning, by virtue of its ability to image in the axial plane, has proved to be an effective method of documenting injuries particularly in complex bony anatomy such as the spine, wrist, elbow, and hips. CT arthrography provides diagnostic information about intra-articular structures. MRI is emerging as an excellent method of noninvasively imaging injuries to soft-tissue structures such as tendons, ligaments, and cartilage. The advancements in MRI technology that are projected for the future may expand the range of usefulness of this modality and decrease the current high cost of these procedures. Radionuclide scanning with Tc99m diphosphonate compounds has proved to be an efficient method of localizing subtle bone pathology and providing a \"road map\" for further analysis with additional imaging techniques. The cost-effective use of all of these imaging procedures is predicated on an understanding of their usefulness in the diagnosis of each clinical problem and the judicious use of each procedure to fit the needs of the individual patient.\r"

The proper use of injectable steroids must be carefully understood to avoid complications. It is critical to know the anatomy and use your needle as carefully as you would a scalpel. Bring the anatomy close to you so that you can use the shortest delivery system and the smallest caliber needle. Have the patient in an optimal position: sitting up for subacromial injections, lying supine for anterior shoulder injections with rotation of the anatomy under your fingers until the area is specifically identified, lying prone for posterior shoulder problems, and sitting up for knee injections, especially for the tibial collateral ligament bursa. Remember that injection of the material should be free and easy. Resistance means you are not in planes between tissues but in the tissue, which is not desirable. Understand the importance of a therapeutic test for both diagnostic and treatment purposes. Judicious use of any medication is critical in the treatment armamentarium, including injectable corticosteroids. Remember that an injection does not substitute for a well-managed rehabilitation program. The key to the successful treatment of an athletic injury is predicted on an accurate diagnosis and a well-managed treatment program.\r"

When tetrodotoxin was added to arrest contractile activity, glucagon, forskolin, and IBMX still elevated cAMP content and rates of protein synthesis. Perfusion of beating rat hearts at elevated aortic pressure (120 mm Hg vs. 60 mm Hg) also accelerated rates of protein synthesis and raised cAMP content and cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity during the second hour of perfusion. Insulin accelerated rates of protein synthesis in beating hearts during the first and second hour of perfusion but did not increase cAMP content. Elevation of aortic pressure in insulin-treated hearts raised cAMP content but had no further effect on rates of protein synthesis. Perfusion of arrested hearts for as little as 2 minutes at 120 mm Hg resulted in a rapid and sustained increase in cAMP content, cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity, and rate of protein synthesis after 60-120 minutes of additional perfusion at 60 mm Hg. Exposure of arrested hearts to 0.2 mM methacholine, a muscarinic-cholinergic agonist, for 5 minutes before elevation of perfusion pressure blocked the pressure-induced increases in cAMP content, cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity, and rates of protein synthesis. When hearts were removed from pertussis toxin-treated animals, methacholine did not block the effects of forskolin on these same three parameters. These studies indicated that elevation of tissue cAMP by hormone binding, direct activation of adenylate cyclase, or inhibition of phosphodiesterase resulted in acceleration of protein synthesis. Furthermore, the effects of increased aortic pressure to accelerate synthesis appeared to involve a cAMP-dependent mechanism that was independent of changes in contractile activity but could be blocked with a muscarinic-cholinergic agonist. Acceleration of protein synthesis by insulin was not associated with an elevation of cAMP.\r"

A proposed mechanism for this increase in filling pressures is an abnormal pressure-volume homeostasis of the transplanted heart. Twenty-three patients undergoing routine 1-year evaluations performed supine bicycle exercise during right heart catheterization. Within 24 hours, these patients underwent supine bicycle exercise to the identical work load during radionuclide ventriculography. For the group, resting hemodynamics and resting left and right ventricular ejection fractions were normal. With exercise, right atrial and pulmonary wedge pressure rose markedly (from 6 +/- 2 to 14 +/- 7 mm Hg, p less than 0.0001, and from 10 +/- 3 to 20 +/- 6 mm Hg, p less than 0.0001, respectively). Left ventricular ejection fraction increased appropriately with exercise (from 0.58 +/- 0.08 to 0.63 +/- 0.07, p = 0.004). End-diastolic volume also increased mildly (from 100 +/- 31 to 117 +/- 39 ml, p = 0.001), but change in end-diastolic volume was highly variable. Patients with little or no change in end-diastolic volume with exercise had the greatest resting and exercise left ventricular filling pressures resulting in significant negative correlations between filling pressures and change in end-diastolic volume (r = -0.64, p = 0.002 and r = -0.50, p = 0.025, respectively). Negative linear relations between exercise left ventricular filling pressures or resting heart rates and donor to recipient body weight ratio (r = -0.35, p = 0.10, and r = -0.37, p = 0.06, respectively) suggested that initial donor heart size influenced subsequent cardiac function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We tested the hypothesis that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can resensitize the beta-adrenergic receptor system. Guinea pigs were given captopril, isoproterenol, or both for 2 weeks. At death, cardiac sarcolemmal and light vesicle fractions and intact mononuclear leukocytes were prepared. Captopril treatment led to an up-regulation of cardiac beta 1- but not mononuclear leukocyte beta 2-adrenergic receptors and an increase in isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in the heart. Animals treated with isoproterenol developed cardiac hypertrophy, had increased plasma norepinephrine levels, and had a decreased number and responsiveness of both cardiac and mononuclear leukocyte beta-adrenergic receptors. Concomitant treatment with captopril attenuated alterations of heart weight, plasma norepinephrine levels, and cardiac beta-receptor density and function. In contrast to its cardiac effects, captopril treatment did not diminish the down-regulation of mononuclear leukocyte beta 2-adrenergic receptors by isoproterenol. Our data suggest that captopril may resensitize the cardiac but not the mononuclear leukocyte beta-adrenergic receptor-adenylate cyclase system after long-term catecholamine exposure.\r"

Most of these studies have established \"normal values\" for Doppler-determined pressure gradients and valve areas of prosthetic mitral and aortic valves. Although these studies have established the \"normal range,\" they have all emphasized the individual variability in clinically normal functioning valves. Most of these studies have confirmed the extraordinary sensitivity and specificity of Doppler in detecting prosthetic valve dysfunction. The study by Burstow et al further emphasizes the excellent correlation obtained with simultaneous Doppler and catheter transvalvular pressure gradient measurements. The addition of both color flow Doppler techniques and transesophageal echocardiography can only serve to enhance the clinical diagnostic accuracy of this technique. At the present time, Doppler echocardiography is clearly the procedure of choice for the evaluation of the patient with suspected prosthetic heart valve dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "Extended cryoablation as a single method of myocardial ablation was used for surgical treatment of 33 patients with ventricular tachycardia associated with coronary artery disease. Surgery was guided by roving-probe mapping in 14 patients and by computerized epicardial and computerized, left ventricular, endocardial, multielectrode mapping in 19 patients. In the latter group, the anatomic correlation between sites of the earliest epicardial activation (EA-EPI) and those of the earliest endocardial activation (EA-ENDO) was found to be consistent in the apical region. In contrast, the EA-ENDO corresponding to the EA-EPI localized in the left anterolateral and posterobasal free-wall regions could be localized either in an underlying area or on the septum. All tachycardias with EA-EPI in anterior and posterior right ventricular regions had their corresponding EA-ENDOs in the interventricular septum. EA-ENDO preceded EA-EPI in 33 of 41 tachycardias studied. The converse was observed in the remaining eight tachycardias. Cryoablation was applied regionally in areas corresponding to EA-ENDO, along with standard aneurysmectomy and coronary artery bypass grafting when indicated. Among the entire group of 33 patients, there were two (6%) operative deaths. Ventricular tachycardias recurred spontaneously in two (6%) patients and remained inducible in four (13%), of whom one (3%) died suddenly. After hospital deaths were taken into account, actuarial survival was 74 +/- 9% (mean +/- SD) at 48 months after operation. Among the 10 patients who had an EA-EPI on the right ventricle and an EA-ENDO on the interventricular septum, deep septal involvement was suspected, and arrhythmic failure occurred in five patients; in contrast, complete surgical success was obtained in all nine patients who did not display this pattern during intraoperative investigation. We conclude that regional cryoablation alone in areas of the earliest left ventricular activation is highly effective for treatment of ventricular tachycardia, except in a subset of patients with specific markers of deep septal involvement, which can be detected by computerized epicardial and endocardial mapping.\r"

Therefore, special consideration of the surgical treatment of aortitis involving the aortic root is required. Fifteen patients (12 with Takayasu's disease and three with Behcet's disease) underwent various surgical procedures, depending on the pathological changes in the aortic valve and the aortic root and on the degree of involvement of the coronary artery. Group 1 patients had coronary artery involvement alone and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) (n = 3); group 2 patients had aortic regurgitation with an intact coronary artery and underwent AVR or a modified Bentall procedure (n = 7); and group 3 patients had aortic regurgitation with coronary artery involvement and underwent AVR, a modified Bentall procedure, or translocation with CABG (n = 5). A prosthetic valve or composite graft with a Teflon felt flange at the sewing ring was fabricated during surgery by exact measurement of the sizes of the aortic annulus and distal aorta and treatment with fibrin glue before insertion. The double-fixation method with reinforcement by a Teflon felt strip was employed for anastomosis of the flanged prosthesis. The button-shaped coronary ostium was directly anastomosed to the composite graft. One patient required translocation with CABG because of a deteriorated annulus. There were no operative or hospital deaths. One patient died of a brain abscess at 6 months after surgery, and another patient who underwent CABG required CABG reoperation due to graft occlusion. We recommend postoperative steroid therapy in patients who are diagnosed as being in the active stage of the disease until inflammatory signs disappear.\r"

  ".W": "Results of surgery in 165 patients with aneurysms of the ascending aorta and aortic arch during 1978-1988 were analyzed retrospectively. Etiology included 29% dissection, 22% atherosclerosis, 22% cystic-medial necrosis, and 27% other causes. Concomitant procedures on the aortic valve were performed in 65% of patients (valvular replacement in 37%, valve-conduit in 23%, and valvular resuspension in 5%), and 13% underwent concomitant coronary artery bypass surgery. Major changes in our operative technique for such aneurysms have been introduced during the last 5 years, especially use of a continuous suture-graft-inclusion technique in 99% of patients, use of circulatory arrest in 59%, and use of an open hemiarch repair in 32%. Hospital mortality dropped from 17.9% during the first 5 years of the study period to 12.3% in the last 5 years despite increasing complexity of the cases encountered. Operative mortality was 7.6% for ascending aortic aneurysmal repair; 5.3% for valve-conduit procedure; 8.8% for open hemiarch repair; and 30.8% for repair of extensive aneurysms involving the aortic arch and significant portions of the descending aorta. Multivariate analysis showed that, of the variables examined, significant predictors of increased operative risk were age (p less than 0.05) and extension of an ascending aortic aneurysm to the descending aorta or involvement of the aortic arch (p less than 0.001). The incidence of stroke was 2.4%, with only one stroke since 1983 despite more extensive use of circulatory arrest since that time. Follow-up was 94% complete, with a mean (+/- SD) follow-up interval of 28 +/- 24 months.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Surgical manipulation of the atherosclerotic ascending aorta in elderly patients is often accompanied by serious complications. To reduce the risk of disrupting highly degenerated but nonpalpable plaques, we used quantitative ultrasonic techniques to intraoperatively image the ascending aorta in 33 patients (mean age, 71 years) as a guide to selection of cross-clamping or cannulation sites. Two-dimensional, integrated backscatter images (integration time, 1.6 mu sec) were obtained with a 5-MHz transducer wrapped in a sterile sheath and placed directly on the aorta. Significant atherosclerotic disease was detected in 18 patients. Calcified lesions were found in 13 patients, and fibrofatty lesions were found in five. In four patients undergoing repair of degenerative aneurysms, the extent and distribution of ultrasonically delineated regions of calcification and fibrosis were confirmed histologically. In eight (24%) patients, the composition, severity, and location of plaques delineated ultrasonically led to selection of alternate cannulation sites without resultant atheroembolism. Thus, ultrasonic tissue characterization sensitively delineates the extent of aortic atherosclerosis, and its use may decrease the risk of atheroembolism.\r"

  ".U": "89355400\r", 
  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to identify preoperative and intraoperative variables predictive of left ventricular dysfunction 6 months after aortic valve replacement. Patients were considered to have postoperative left ventricular dysfunction if the end-diastolic-volume index was greater than or equal to 101 ml/m2 or if the ejection fraction was less than or equal to 0.50. Data from 180 patients entered into the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study on Valvular Heart Disease who had technically satisfactory cardiac catheterizations 6 months postoperatively were analyzed by a series of univariate and multivariate analyses. For the 88 patients with preoperative aortic stenosis, the most powerful predictor of postoperative left ventricular dysfunction in the final multivariate model was preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction (p = 0.0001), followed by preoperative myocardial infarction (p = 0.012), aortic valve gradient (p = 0.020), and incomplete coronary revascularization (p = 0.059). Abnormal preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction had a sensitivity of 72% and a specificity of 82% in identifying patients with postoperative left ventricular dysfunction. Preoperative left ventricular systolic-volume index greater than or equal to 40 ml/m2 had a similar sensitivity and specificity (79% and 84%, respectively). For the 36 patients with aortic regurgitation, preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction was again the most powerful predictor of postoperative left ventricular dysfunction (p = 0.013), followed by left ventricular systolic pressure (p = 0.038) and arteriovenous oxygen difference (p = 0.054). For the 56 patients with mixed aortic stenosis and regurgitation, left ventricular systolic pressure (p = 0.007) and preoperative myocardial infarction (p = 0.022) were the variables predictive of postoperative left ventricular dysfunction. Although many patients with preoperative left ventricular dysfunction experience improved left ventricular performance after aortic valve replacement, performance does not always return to normal. For patients with either aortic stenosis or regurgitation, the strongest predictor of postoperative left ventricular dysfunction is preoperative dysfunction. These data support the concept that patients with moderate or severe aortic stenosis or regurgitation should be operated on before the onset of significant left ventricular dysfunction.\r"

To assess the effectiveness of metabolic support for the heart in patients with refractory heart failure after hypothermic ischemic arrest for aortocoronary bypass surgery, we randomly assigned 22 patients to receive either intravenous glucose (50%), insulin (80 units/I), and potassium (100 meq/l) (GIK) infused at a rate of 1 ml/kg/hr for up to 48 hours or glucose (5%) and NaCl (0.225%) infused at the same rate (control). All patients required inotropic drug support, received intra-aortic balloon pump assistance, and had an initial mean cardiac index (CI) of 2.5 l/min/m2. At 12 and 24 hours, CI had risen significantly in the GIK but not in the control group (3.6 and 3.4 l/min/m2 vs. 2.5 and 2.7 l/min/m2, p less than 0.005). Time on the intra-aortic balloon pump (39 vs. 61 hours) and requirements for inotropic drug support were also significantly less in the GIK compared with the control group. Although the number of patients was relatively small, the GIK group also showed a trend for improved long-term survival: at 60 days after surgery, there were 10 of 11 survivors in the GIK-treated group compared with seven of 11 survivors in the control group. Although the exact mechanism for the beneficial effects of GIK on myocardial contractility remains to be elucidated, we conclude that GIK is safe and effective in the treatment of refractory left ventricular failure after aortocoronary bypass surgery.\r"

This study was performed to assess the ability of a series of PDMs to localize the site of earliest activation of VT originating in the interventricular septum. In 12 dogs, 13 morphologies of VT were initiated with programmed electrical stimulation 3-6 days after anterior septal coronary artery infarction. VT was mapped with endocardial and epicardial unipolar electrodes with a multipoint, computer-assisted mapping system. PDMs were compared with activation-time maps, and the former correctly identified the site of earliest activation of all 13 VT morphologies. When PDMs were viewed in sequence on a computer monitor, the site of earliest activation was signaled by abrupt development of a negative potential of less than -3.0 mV. The initial negative point subsequently expanded, and the spread of this negative-potential field correlated with activation sequence. PDMs provide an accurate, unambiguous, rapid means of analyzing large numbers of electrograms acquired with multipoint, computer-assisted mapping systems.\r"

Samples also were obtained from 18 normal controls and 30 patients with \"classical\" hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). The arachidonic acid content was estimated as the percentage relative to the five principal fatty acids in red blood cell phospholipids (C16:0, C18:0, C18:1 omega 9, C18:2 omega 6, C18:3 omega 6) and quoted as mean value +/- standard deviation. There was a highly significant difference between patients on cyclosporine (14.7 +/- 2.9) and non-cyclosporine-treated transplant recipients (17.1 +/- 2.5; p less than 0.002). This difference was even more significant when patients who had been on cyclosporine for less than 3 months were excluded (14.1 +/- 2.7; p less than 0.001). The mean arachidonic acid content in non-cyclosporine recipients also was significantly less than that in normal controls (19.2 +/- 1.5; p less than 0.005) whilst the HUS patients (11.2 +/- 3.6) had significantly reduced values when compared with all the other groups. Cyclosporine often causes nephrotoxicity and in some cases HUS may develop in cyclosporine-treated transplant recipients. We have found a significant negative correlation between serum creatinine levels and red blood cell phospholipid arachidonic acid levels (r = -0.45; p less than 0.01). We propose that the decreased concentration of arachidonic acid in the cyclosporine-treated group may be related to the development of nephrotoxicity in the long term and may be a useful marker in predicting the early development of nephrotoxicity in these patients.\r"

Before commencing nifedipine, creatinine and sodium clearance rates and the fractional excretion of sodium were similar in both two groups.

We report three cases of acute renal failure following ciprofloxacin in patients without a previous history of renal insufficiency. The average baseline creatinine was 1.1 mg/dl and rose to an average of 4.0 mg/dl during therapy. The length of antecedent ciprofloxacin therapy ranged from several days to several weeks. Other causes of acute renal failure and postobstructive uropathy were excluded. Kidney size was normal-to-increased. Gallium scans were positive in one of two patients studied. Peripheral eosinophilia developed in one case, suggesting an acute hypersensitivity reaction to the drug. The acute renal failure in all cases was non-oliguric and was completely reversed after discontinuation of ciprofloxacin. In two of the three reported cases there was an increased creatinine to BUN ratio, but increased production of creatinine (i.e., rhabdomyolysis) was unlikely with a normal serum creatinine phosphokinase (CPK). In addition, we performed in vitro studies which eliminated the possibility of methodological artifact. The nephrotoxicity of the quinolones has been linked to the development of crystalluria in experimental animals. However, in humans, crystalluria is unlikely and renal damage has not been noted. There have been only two previous case reports of acute renal failure due to oral ciprofloxacin therapy. In one, biopsy showed acute interstitial nephritis. We conclude that oral ciprofloxacin therapy may lead to acute renal failure secondary to tubulointerstitial nephritis characterized by an increased creatinine to BUN ratio. Patients placed on ciprofloxacin therapy need to be followed closely.\r"

The average age was 38 years, and the average follow-up period since the onset of symptoms was 5.3 years. PEMF treatment had been instituted an average of 4.1 years earlier. By the Steinberg quantitative staging method of roentgenographic analysis, none of the 15 hips in Stages 0-III showed progression, and grading improved in nine of 15. Eighteen of 79 hips (23%) with Stage IV lesions progressed and none improved. In the Stage V category, one of 21 hips (5%) worsened and none improved. Three Stage VI lesions were unchanged. The overall rate of quantified progression for the 118 hips, 87% of which had collapse present when entering the program, was 16%. This value represents a reversal of the percentage of progression reported recently by other investigators using conservative and selected surgical methods. PEMF patients also have experienced long-term improvements in symptoms and signs, together with a reduction in the need for early joint arthroplasty.\r"

Tibia vara is characterized by an abrupt angulation of the tibia into varus in the proximal end. The term does not reveal the etiology of the anatomic deformity, which may be developmental, posttraumatic, or postinfectious. There are four types: (1) Infantile tibia vara (Blount's disease) is a developmental condition that manifests itself between the ages of one and four years. Roentgenographic findings are typical. (2) Adolescent tibia vara is caused by partial closure of the growth plate after trauma or infection between the ages of six and 13 years. (3) Late-onset tibia vara appears in obese black children between the ages of six and 15 years. The roentgenographic findings differ from those of the other types, but the histopathology is similar to infantile tibia vara. (4) Tibia vara may also be caused by focal fibrocartilaginous dysplasia. Eight cases in which there was an area of fibrocartilaginous dysplasia in the medial aspect of the tibia have been reported in the literature. Several problems have been encountered in the treatment of infantile tibia vara.\r"

Major errors in questionnaire design and data reduction have led to invalid conclusions. A questionnaire containing a minimum set of rating criteria was formulated to validly assess athletic participation before and after treatment or surgery. Select questions and a data reduction format were established to assess the intensity of sports participation, changes in sports participation, the variables that produced the changes, self-assessed functional limitations, and the ability to participate in different types of sports. A clinical trial of the questionnaire was performed on 59 patients. An interview conducted upon completion of the questionnaire enabled the authors to detect difficulties or inconsistencies in the responses to the questions. The design format described in this report forms the basis for a subjective evaluation of ligamentous surgery. A standard format for analysis of sports participation and knee function is proposed to aid investigators in comparing variations in clinical results.\r"

Currently, the predominant use of FTT is to describe a child's growth failure resulting from caloric or maternal deprivation or both. Despite widespread use, the term FTT lacks a clarified definition. In this study the authors review 22 current reference texts in general pediatrics, pediatric nutrition, and pediatric gastroenterology and 13 recent journal articles addressing FTT. Only 9 of the 22 texts and 9 of the 13 journal articles describe FTT in quantitative terms, but even these references lack consensus on the anthropometric indices used and their criteria for abnormality. The absence of a standard, scientifically credible definition for FTT, which reflects the dynamic nature of this syndrome, continues to produce an ambiguous body of literature on the subject.\r"

Physiological doses of adrenaline (0.5 microgram/min and 3 microgram/min) increased peripheral venous packed cell volume significantly; intravenous noradrenaline at 0.5 microgram/min had no effect on packed cell volume, whereas packed cell volume increased significantly at 3 micrograms of noradrenaline/min. No significant change in packed cell volume was found during saline infusion. 3. During adrenaline infusion at 6 micrograms/min, packed cell volume increased, plasma volume decreased and intravascular mass of albumin decreased significantly. During noradrenaline infusion at 6 micrograms/min, packed cell volume increased and plasma volume decreased, but intravascular mass of albumin did not change. 4. Application of a hyperinsulinaemic, euglycaemic glucose clamp led to an increase in transcapillary escape rate of albumin and a decrease in intravascular mass of albumin. Packed cell volume remained constant, while plasma volume, measured by radiolabelled albumin, decreased. 5. We conclude that the previously reported changes in packed cell volume, plasma volume, intravascular mass of albumin and transcapillary escape rate of albumin during hypoglycaemia may be explained by the combined actions of adrenaline and insulin.\r"

Subsequent manifestations are protean. This is particularly true concerning the nervous system. It is estimated that 15% of patients with Lyme disease have neurologic complications. It is very possible that nervous system manifestations of Lyme disease are even more common, and these can occur from weeks to many years following the primary infection and can be quite devastating. A high index of suspicion is necessary in diagnosing Lyme-related disorders, because the majority of patients will not recall a tick bite or characteristic rash, and because the subsequent neurologic manifestations are not unlike those seen with many other diseases. With this awareness and appropriate laboratory testing, a presumptive diagnosis can usually be made without significant difficulty. When the nervous system has been affected by Lyme disease, aggressive antibiotic treatment is usually necessary, often using IV preparations. Usually, there will be significant improvement following the use of antibiotics, but there are some patients who will continue to have persistent, probably irreversible, nervous system abnormalities. This is often the case in patients who have had symptoms for long periods of time or who have had multiple recurrences.\r"

The vaginal discharge is often heavy and foul smelling, and usually resolves when treated with metronidazole, 500 mg twice a day for seven days. It is unclear whether bacterial vaginosis is caused by G. vaginalis or whether G. vaginalis is simply associated with the condition and its development is related to other factors. More importantly, the association of bacterial vaginosis with preterm labor (whether merely a risk factor or a causal factor) needs to be clarified, and the question of whether treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy will improve fetal outcome by decreasing prematurity needs to be addressed.\r"

In spite of homogeneous inflammatory responses, significant differences in the severity of the injury to the skin barrier function caused by the different irritants were found. Also significant differences between irritants were found in the time course of development of maximum irritant reactions. Bioengineering methods indicating inflammatory responses (measurement of blood flow and skin thickness) were helpful in quantifying the irritant response in general, while bioengineering methods indicating epidermal damage (measurement of TEWL and electrical conductance) were helpful in classifying the individual irritants.\r"

There were eight comparisons of a group receiving cimetidine with a control group, nine comparisons of a group receiving antacids with a control group, and ten comparisons of a group receiving cimetidine with a group receiving antacids. The incidence of upper GI bleeding ranged from 3.4% to 52.7% among 866 control patients who received either a placebo or no prophylaxis. In five of eight comparisons, cimetidine was significantly more effective than no treatment or a placebo to prevent occult and overt upper GI bleeding; the typical odds ratio was 0.32 (95% confidence interval 0.21 to 0.49). In six of nine comparisons, antacids were significantly more effective than no treatment or a placebo; the typical odds ratio was 0.12 (0.08 to 0.19). Finally, antacids were significantly more effective than cimetidine in two of ten comparisons; the typical odds ratio was 1.61 (0.97 to 2.65). However, weaknesses in the study designs, heterogeneity of treatment effects, the lack of strength of the accumulated evidence, and the fact that no utility has been shown in terms of reducing morbidity (shock, need for transfusion) or mortality, prevent any definitive conclusion in regard to compulsory use of upper GI bleeding prophylaxis for ICU patients.\r"

Massive hemoptysis was present in ten patients receiving thrombin therapy and nine patients receiving fibrinogen-thrombin therapy. Thrombin therapy was very effective in 14 cases, effective in one case and ineffective in four cases. Fibrinogen-thrombin therapy was very effective in 11 cases and somewhat effective in three cases; two of these three patients had tuberculosis and the third required emergency surgery for removal of a foreign object in the bronchus.

The PaO2 showed no significant difference at 0.5 h but rose significantly from 96 +/- 14 to 105 +/- 14 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and 111 +/- 14 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) at 1 and 2 h, respectively. Since we observed no changes in hemodynamics, we speculate a direct effect of furosemide in the pulmonary vasculature affecting the ventilation-perfusion mismatch and, therefore, the Qs/QT and PaO2.\r"

Fifty-six patients received intravenous ceftazidime (1 to 2 g two to three times daily). Ciprofloxacin was as effective as ceftazidime and produced a 91 percent clinical cure rate. Significantly more pretreatment bacterial isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin had a significantly higher rate of sputum bacterial eradication than did ceftazidime. Ciprofloxacin showed broad in vitro antibacterial activity with particularly low minimal inhibitory concentrations for Gram-negative organisms. Ciprofloxacin was well tolerated; there were few adverse effects. Ciprofloxacin was an effective and well-tolerated treatment for severe RTI that had the advantages of broad in vitro antibacterial activity, twice-daily dosing, and sequential availability in an intravenous and oral formulation.\r"

Eighteen patients with biopsy-proven sarcoidosis were prospectively evaluated. An inverse relationship was demonstrated between BAL coefficient of excretion relative to albumin (RCE) values of IgG and IgA and diffusion for carbon monoxide (Dco). A similar negative correlation existed with PaO2 at the end of a maximal exercise. Steroid therapy in five patients lowered concomitantly BAL RCE of IgA and IgG while Dco values increased. Immunoperoxidase studies in three lung biopsies revealed numerous Ig-containing cells within the lung parenchyma. We suggest that these BAL Ig values reflected the mononuclear cell infiltration of the bronchiolovascular sheaths and lung interstitium. This cellular infiltration likely induces a distortion of the capillary bed and may affect the gas exchanges in a reversible way.\r"

Inhaled corticosteroids, used by 22 and 24 subjects in the active and placebo groups respectively, were discontinued before the study, in which a two-week baseline was followed by six weeks of treatment. Two-weekly clinic assessments of lung function, symptoms and final opinions of treatment were significantly (p less than 0.05 p less than 0.001) in favor of nedocromil sodium. Daily diary cards showed a similar trend with significant drug effects seen after the third week. Blood and urine samples showed no abnormalities and the majority of patient withdrawals (five from nedocromil sodium and six from placebo treatment) were due to worsening asthma. Overall, we found nedocromil sodium to be well tolerated and effective in the management of bronchial asthma.\r"

When adjusting the ventilator PEEP valve, FRC increases only after PEEPi has been exceeded. In both mechanically ventilated and spontaneously breathing patients, changes in FRC are mirrored by changes in end-expiratory TGV as measured with RIP set in the DC mode. We compared PEEPi as measured by RIP to PEEPi-OC in 20 patients receiving mechanical ventilator support. Noninvasive measurement of changes in end-expiratory TGV by RIP is a convenient alternative method to estimate PEEPi in both controlled, assisted, and spontaneously ventilating patients.\r"

It allows spontaneous ventilation with CPAP but differs from conventional ventilatory modes because, with APRV, peak inflation pressure never exceeds the level of CPAP, and airway pressure decreases, rather than increases, when tidal volume is delivered. The risk of pulmonary barotrauma and adverse hemodynamic effects associated with conventional modes of positive-pressure mechanical ventilation may be decreased because of lower peak inflation and mean airway pressures. We describe a patient in whom several risk factors for these complications were present who was treated successfully with APRV.\r"

The infusion resulted in plasma concentrations of 203 +/- 21 pmol/liter (mean +/- SEM) of oxyntomodulin, regarded as high but not unphysiological concentrations of the peptide. Oxyntomodulin almost abolished basal acid secretion and inhibited postprandial acid secretion by 35 +/- 10%. Gastric emptying decreased significantly; the time for 50% to leave the stomach increased from 17.3 +/- 2.2 min to 34.7 +/- 8.0 min. The postprandial gastroduodenal motility was massively inhibited by oxyntomodulin. Postprandial trypsin and lipase output was significantly inhibited by 56 +/- 12% and 42 +/- 11%, respectively, during oxyntomodulin infusion. However, pancreatic enzyme output was linearly related to gastric emptying and oxyntomodulin did not influence this relationship, suggesting that oxyntomodulins effect was due to its effect on gastric emptying. Oxyntomodulin seems to play an important role in the small intestinal inhibitory control of gastropancreatic functions.\r"

All subjects suffered from chronic pain. Constipated women were found to have significantly higher scores on the hypochondria, hysteria, control, and low back pain scales and a lower score on the masculinity-femininity scale. Discriminant analysis permitted us to sort out constipated from arthritic patients in 83% of the cases, on the basis of only the personality data. In women with constipation by delayed colonic transit, multiple regression analysis demonstrated a close link (r = 0.90; P less than 0.001) between transit time in the ascending colon and levels of anxiety. It is concluded that women with constipation of colonic origin have a different pattern of personality than arthritic women and that severe constipation may play the role of a defense mechanism, where psychophysiologic responses to life stresses replace normal emotional reactions.\r"

Expression of MHC class I (HLA-A, B, C) and class II (HLA-D) antigens was studied in parallel. In the normal colonic mucosa, the CD4:CD8 ratio in the epithelial compartment approximated 1:1, and in the lamina propria, 2.55:1. Of the CD8+ (cytotoxic/suppressor) subset, approximately half did not express the CD5 \"pan-T\" marker in either compartment. Virtually no Leu8+ cells were observed, implying that the CD4+ subset consisted of helper, rather than suppressor-inducer cells. Classical markers of T-cell activation (CD25, HLA-D) and proliferation were absent, and strong expression of the CD7 \"immunostimulation\" marker was approximately equal in both CD4 and CD8 subsets. The epithelium was uniformly negative for class II antigens, but positive for class I. In UC, there were no significant alterations in CD4:CD8 ratios in either compartment, and there were no changes with respect to phenotype of the subsets. In 11 of 19 patients (mainly with total colitis), enterocytes were HLA-D+. In this HLA-D+ group, there was an increase in the percentage of CD4+ cells coexpressing CD7; this difference was significant (P less than 0.02) in the lamina propria. Increased expression of CD7 was also found by the CD6+ T cell subset (P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The use of these tools in neonatal screening for congenital hypothyroidism alone has reduced the incidence of mental retardation in the industrialized world. Based on an accurate physical examination, the judicious use of immunoassays for thyroxine, triiodothyronine, and thyrotropin and the use of thyroglobulin and thyroid microsomal antibodies will allow the general physician to confidently delineate common thyroid disorders in the great majority of patients. The additional use of an ultrasensitive thyrotropin assay, thyroid scans, and fine-needle aspiration biopsy will complete the accurate diagnosis of the great majority of thyroid diseases. The ultrasensitive thyrotropin assay may become the universal thyroid function test. The major pitfalls in the use of these tests lies in the variable effect chronic illness has on the most frequently used tests: thyroxine and triiodothyronine. Tests for these thyroid hormones, which in the relatively well outpatient are highly accurate, may in the ill, hospitalized patient become very misleading.\r"

A novel approach to solve the problem has been the synthesis of a phosphate ester of PHT (PHT prodrug ACC-9653). This water-soluble compound is metabolized rapidly into PO4 and PHT. A four center open-label, baseline-controlled study of 43 patients with epilepsy maintained on oral twice-daily PHT monotherapy was performed to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of the prodrug. Patients received an i.v. or i.m. dose of ACC-9653 at a dose equivalent to the patients' morning dose of PHT. Intravenous dosages were infused at a rate of 75 mg/min, and i.m. dosages were given as one or two injections. After a period of 6 days, during which patients were again maintained with oral PHT, they were given a dose of ACC-9653 via whichever route they had not yet received. The Tmax of the prodrug averaged 5.7 and 36 min (0.095 and 0.606 h) after i.v. and i.m. administrations, respectively.

Absolute bioavailability of phenytoin derived from ACC-9653 in each subject was calculated as the ratio of the phenytoin area under the plasma concentration time curve for time 0 to infinity [AUC(0-inf)] after ACC-9653 divided by the phenytoin AUC(0-inf) after intravenous sodium phenytoin. The mean absolute bioavailability of ACC-9653 was 0.992 after intravenous administration and 1.012 after intramuscular administration. These data establish that the bioavailability of ACC-9653 is complete following intravenous or intramuscular administration in single-dose volunteer studies.

  ".W": "Benzodiazepines are potent and effective drugs for the management of acute seizures and status epilepticus. Lorazepam, diazepam, and clonazepam have been the most widely studied of the benzodiazepines in the treatment of status epilepticus. In 47 studies of these drugs involving 1,455 patients, lasting control of status epilepticus was achieved in 79% of the patients. None of these benzodiazepines is clearly superior to another for the effective control of status epilepticus. Differences in pharmacokinetic parameters, therefore, will influence the choice of drug. All three benzodiazepines are lipid-soluble and enter the brain within seconds to minutes after intravenous administration. Diazepam, however, is very lipid-soluble and highly protein-bound and thus has a very large volume of distribution of unbound drug. As a result, the effective duration of action of diazepam in status epilepticus is only 20 to 30 min, whereas that of lorazepam, which has a much smaller volume of distribution of unbound drug, is at least several hours after a single intravenous injection. This allows the orderly administration of an antiepileptic drug for long-term seizure control after status epilepticus has been controlled. For this reason, lorazepam is preferable for the initial management of status epilepticus. Continuous intravenous infusion of diazepam has been used successfully in the management of some patients with status epilepticus refractory to initial treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Diabetic nephropathy leading to kidney failure is a major complication of both type I (insulin-dependent) and type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus, and glomerular structural lesions (especially expansion of the mesangium) may constitute the principal cause of decline in kidney function experienced by a significant fraction of diabetic patients. Although the biochemical bases of these mesangial abnormalities remain unknown, an understanding of the natural history of diabetic nephropathy from a combined structural and functional approach can lead to greater pathophysiological insight. Work in animals has supported the concept that the metabolic disturbances of diabetes mellitus cause diabetic nephropathy, with structural and functional lesions prevented or reversed with improved or normalized glycemic control. Additional research must address this fundamental issue in humans, especially the response of advancing mesangial lesions to improved glycemic control. Factors not directly related to the metabolic perturbations of diabetes may serve to accelerate or diminish the pathophysiological processes of diabetic nephropathy. The elucidation and management of these factors, when coupled with improved glycemic control, may moderate the development or progression of diabetic kidney lesions in humans.\r"

  ".W": "Our aim was to isolate and determine the contribution of partial pancreatectomy, systemic delivery of pancreatic hormones, and duct obliteration to glucose regulation after segmental pancreas transplantation in dogs. Fasting, postprandial, and intravenous glucose-stimulated glucose, insulin, glucagon, pancreatic polypeptide (PP), and cholecystokinin (CCK) and intravenous bombesin-stimulated PP levels were studied in beagles at three successive intervals in a crossover design. The first was 6 wk after partial (approximately 70%) pancreatectomy with intact regular enteric exocrine drainage from the duodenal pancreatic remnant, the next was 2 wk after venous transposition with systemic delivery of pancreatic hormones, and the third was 6 wk after in situ duct obliteration of the remnant. With partial pancreatectomy, K values were modestly diminished (30%), and a concomitant reduction of second-phase intravenous glucose-stimulated insulin release was observed. Other parameters were not significantly affected. Venous transposition doubled peripheral plasma levels of insulin under all conditions. Fasting glucose, PP, and CCK levels decreased slightly. Other parameters were not affected. Duct obliteration of the systemic draining pancreatic remnants seriously impaired glucose sensitivity, resulting in a 50% reduction of K values and fasting and sustained postprandial hyperglycemia (approximately 8 mM) and a 70-50% reduction (acute and overall responses, respectively) of intravenous glucose-stimulated insulin. Fasting hormone and postprandial insulin, glucagon, and CCK levels were not affected. The postprandial PP response was severely reduced, and bombesin-stimulated PP release was abolished by duct obliteration. We conclude that histological changes associated with duct obliteration are the major determinants of glucose regulation in segmental pancreas transplantation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The D variant of encephalomyocarditis (EMC-D) virus does not induce the production of interferon (IFN) and produces an insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM)-like syndrome in certain mouse strains. In contrast, the B variant (EMC-B) virus, which is serologically identical to EMC-D virus, is a good inducer of IFN and is nondiabetogenic. It has been postulated that IFN may play a major role in determining the ability of these two viruses to infect pancreatic beta-cells. However, recent studies have shown that ICR Swiss and BALB/cByJ male mice are not protected by IFN against EMC-D virus-induced IDDM. Furthermore, treatment of these two strains of mice with anti-IFN gamma-globulin before infection with EMC-B virus does not result in diabetes. These observations suggest that mechanisms other than the IFN system are involved in determining the ability of the viruses to infect and destroy beta-cells. Studies were initiated to identify other mechanisms of action. In this communication, we show that up to six times more EMC-D than EMC-B virus attaches to primary beta-cells extracted from male ICR Swiss mice. This difference in ability to attach to beta-cells may account for the difference in the diabetic potential of this mouse strain.\r"

We studied 11 control rats, 11 rats with severe streptozocin (STZ)-induced hyperglycemia (diabetic group), and 10 moderately hyperglycemic rats made diabetic by injection of STZ but given 2-8 U s.c. insulin daily (insulin-treated group). RBF was measured by an electromagnetic flowmeter during stepwise reduction of renal perfusion pressure 4-8 wk after injection of STZ (older group). RBF autoregulation of the diabetic group was impaired compared with the control group. In the insulin-treated group, autoregulatory capability was less attenuated than in the diabetic group. The average autoregulatory index (ARI) of the diabetic group (0.61 +/- 0.05) was greater than that of the control (0.24 +/- 0.02, P less than .01) and the insulin-treated (0.33 +/- 0.07, P less than .05) groups. To study the relationship between autoregulation and the duration of diabetes, an autoregulatory study was also made in a group of 22 rats (11 diabetic and 11 control) that were tested 2-3 wk after injection of STZ (younger group). The ARI in the younger diabetic group was smaller than that in the older diabetic group (P less than .05). The results suggest that in uncontrolled diabetes RBF fluctuates with blood pressure change, and protection against hypertensive injury of glomerular capillaries may be diminished. Autoregulatory disability develops with time, and insulin treatment diminishes impairment of autoregulation. These findings may also explain the adverse consequences of hypertension on the progression of diabetic nephropathy in poorly controlled diabetes.\r"

The results showed no effect of galanin infusion on plasma glucose or serum insulin, although a rise in serum growth hormone even in the face of the intravenous glucose load confirmed the potent growth hormone-stimulating effect of galanin. These results suggest that caution should be exercised in extrapolating a physiological role for galanin in humans from the results of animal studies.\r"

An evisceration procedure, including functional hepatectomy-nephrectomy, was performed, and the rate of proteolysis in the remaining tissues, primarily skeletal muscles, was evaluated over 2 h. With cycloheximide to block protein synthesis, total protein breakdown was measured from the rate of rise in plasma tyrosine concentration. The rate of degradation of contractile (myofibrillar) protein was estimated from the rate of rise in plasma concentration of 3-methylhistidine released from the breakdown of actomyosin. Compared with nondiabetic control preparations, the total protein degradation rate was increased 30% by diabetes (P less than .001), and myofibrillar catabolism was accelerated by 60% (P less than .005). In diabetes, the increase in proteolysis was accompanied by reductions in circulating insulin to 25-50% of normal level, whereas food intake did not differ from control. Treatment of diabetic rats with exogenous insulin, including acute infusions postoperatively, completely reversed the proteolytic effects of diabetes. The findings demonstrate that the hypoinsulinemia of acute diabetes increases the catabolism of skeletal muscle protein and that the inhibitory effect of normal levels of insulin includes a specific action to restrain myofibrillar proteolysis.\r"

  ".W": "Antibodies in serums from newly diagnosed insulin-dependent (type I) diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients and individuals experiencing early phases of beta-cell destruction specifically immunoprecipitate a minor pancreatic islet cell membrane protein of 64,000 Mr (64K). In this report, we demonstrate the use of two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis to unambiguously identify the 64K antigen. By nonequilibrium pH-gradient gel electrophoresis in the first dimension and sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the second dimension, the 64K protein separates into two components, designated alpha and beta, that differ in size but display identical charge heterogeneity. The high resolution of the 2-D method efficiently separates the 64K components from background proteins in immunoprecipitates from crude detergent lysates of islets. The background proteins were identified as major cellular proteins carried nonspecifically through the immunoprecipitation procedure. The high affinity and specificity of the 64K autoantibodies were demonstrated by the exclusive and greater than 1000-fold purification of this minor protein by immunoprecipitation with IDDM serums. The 2-D analyses did not reveal additional proteins specifically immunoprecipitated by IDDM serums, suggesting that the 64K protein is the only protein antigen specifically and consistently recognized by IDDM autoantibodies in the relatively stringent conditions of immunoprecipitation. Moreover, the 2-D analyses demonstrate that purification of membrane protein fractions from both human and rat islets before the immunoprecipitation efficiently removes background proteins and substantially increases the specificity of 64K autoantibody measurements by traditional methods.\r"

In addition, the EC50 of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was higher (921 +/- 82 vs. 557 +/- 69 pM insulin, P less than .05) in adipocytes from SHR rats than from WKY rats. The ability of phenylisopropyladenosine (PIA) to modulate basal and maximal insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was compared in adipocytes from SHR and WKY rats. These results also demonstrated that glucose uptake was decreased in adipocytes from SHR rats and that PIA similarly enhanced both basal and maximal insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes from both groups. Although maximal isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis was decreased in adipocytes from SHR rats, the ability of insulin to inhibit catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis was at least as great in adipocytes from SHR as from WKY rats. Despite the decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose transport in isolated adipocytes from SHR rats, total number of insulin receptors, their affinity for insulin, and the ability of insulin to stimulate receptor-associated tyrosine kinase activity were similar in adipocytes from SHR and WKY rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Hyperinsulinemia secondary to a poorly characterized disorder of insulin action is a feature of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCO). However, controversy exists as to whether insulin resistance results from PCO or the obesity that is frequently associated with it. Thus, we determined in vivo insulin action on peripheral glucose utilization (M) and hepatic glucose production (HGP) with the euglycemic glucose-clamp technique in obese (n = 19) and nonobese (n = 10) PCO women and age- and body-composition-matched normal ovulatory women (n = 11 obese and n = 8 nonobese women). None had fasting hyperglycemia. Two obese PCO women had diabetes mellitus, established with an oral glucose tolerance test; no other women had impairment of glucose tolerance. However, the obese PCO women had significantly increased fasting and 2-h glucose levels after an oral glucose load and increased basal HGP compared with their body-composition-matched control group. There were statistically significant interactions between obesity and PCO in fasting glucose levels and basal HGP (P less than .05). Steady-state insulin levels of approximately 100 microU/ml were achieved during the clamp. Insulin-stimulated glucose utilization was significantly decreased in both PCO groups whether expressed per kilogram total weight (P less than .001) or per kilogram fat free mass (P less than .001) or when divided by the steady-state plasma insulin (l) level (M/l, P less than .001). There was residual HGP in 4 of 15 obese PCO, 0 of 11 obese normal, 2 of 10 nonobese PCO, and 0 of 8 nonobese normal women. The metabolic clearance rate of insulin did not differ in the four groups. We conclude that 1) PCO women have significant insulin resistance that is independent of obesity, changes in body composition, and impairment of glucose tolerance, 2) PCO and obesity have a synergistic deleterious effect on glucose tolerance, 3) hyperinsulinemia in PCO is not the result of decreased insulin clearance, and 4) PCO is associated with a unique disorder of insulin action.\r"

Hemodynamic and metabolic data were obtained before and for 90 min after insulin injection. Insulin induced no changes in heart rate, mean aortic pressure, rate-pressure product, coronary sinus flow, or coronary resistance. Metabolic changes were similar in both groups and included 1) 30% decrease of arterial glucose (P less than .001) and 3-fold increase of myocardial glucose uptake (P less than .001), 2) 1.5- to 2.5-fold elevation of arterial lactate (P less than .001) and myocardial lactate usage (P less than .001), respectively, 3) 50-70% suppression of arterial levels (P less than .001) and myocardial uptake of free fatty acids (P less than .01), and 4) 10% reduction of myocardial net oxygen consumption (P less than .05). Myocardial citrate efflux increased in the CAD patients (P less than .05), whereas alanine release rose only in control patients (P less than .01), suggesting that glucose enters glycogen production in the CAD patients and pyruvate production in the control patients to a high degree. Myocardial glutamate uptake remained unchanged. In conclusion, insulin sensitivity was not altered in CAD. The insulin-induced shift from myocardial free fatty acid to carbohydrate usage may be beneficial to the ischemic heart by increasing glycogen stores, saving oxygen, and inhibiting an excess free-fatty acid concentration, which may be toxic during ischemia.\r"

The mechanism by which exogenous phosphatidic acid from egg yolk lecithin may augment insulin secretion was investigated in neonatal beta-cells. In whole cells labeled with [2,8-3H]-adenine, a dose-dependent increase in phosphatidic acid-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was seen, and a small intracellular transient free-Ca2+ rise was seen in Fura 2AM-loaded cells. In [gamma-32P]ATP-labeled membranes from those beta-cells, phosphatidic acid effected PIP2 hydrolysis. These phosphatidic acid-stimulated effects were not sensitive to preincubation with Bordetella pertussis exotoxin. The findings are consistent with a stimulatory effect of exogenous phosphatidic acid on insulin release and indicate an effect at the plasma membrane. It is possible that newly synthesized phosphatidic acid may function similarly to amplify intracellular events in glucose-stimulated islet cells through both local Ca2+ concentration and cyclic AMP-sensitive mechanisms. The participation of newly synthesized phosphatidic acid derived from glucose could provide a link between the metabolism of glucose and insulin release.\r"

Consecutive patients who underwent sclerotherapy were evaluated. Patients were prospectively endoscoped 4 days (range, 3 to 5 days) after sclerotherapy. Those with ulcers greater than 5 mm in diameter were randomized to receive sucralfate suspension, 4 g/day (10 ml four times a day), or placebo. Endoscopic evaluations were done weekly for the 4 weeks of therapy. Nineteen patients survived long enough to be evaluated; complete ulcer healing was scored as success. Nine patients (13 ulcers) received sucralfate and 10 patients (17 ulcers) received placebo. At the end of 4 weeks, 78% of ulcers in sucralfate-treated patients had healed compared with 40% in the placebo group (p = not significant). Large ulcers were found to heal more slowly (p = 0.03, life table analysis) and small ulcers were disproportionally represented in patients receiving sucralfate (67% compared with 40% in the placebo group). When ulcer size was taken into account, the possible drug advantage disappeared; ulcer size appears to be a major determinant of rate of healing of sclerotherapy-associated esophageal ulcers. A large multicenter trial will be required to identify whether sucralfate accelerates postsclerotherapy esophageal ulcer healing.\r"

These different types may co-exist. If the initial treatment is ineffective, it is recommended that referral be made for expert evaluation and urodynamic investigation.\r"

Although lower doses (5 MU/m2 and 2.5 MU/m2) also produced some responses, the seroconversion rate was not significantly greater than that observed in the control group. Sixteen of the 45 patients receiving interferon were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody positive: none of these responded. Forty one per cent of the anti-HIV negative patients receiving interferon (12/29, p less than 0.005) lost HBeAg and 17% (5/29) lost hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). The response rate among these anti-HIV negative patients receiving at least three months therapy was 46% and 19% respectively. Low pretreatment HBV-DNA and absence of anti-HIV were the only significant independent variables predicting response to therapy (p less than 0.03 and p less than 0.05 respectively). In six patients, neutralising antibodies to alpha interferon were detected during therapy, the majority being non-responders.\r"

All 25 patients randomised to endoprosthesis were treated by this procedure, whereas only 19 of 25 patients randomised to bypass surgery underwent operative biliary-digestive anastomosis. Life table analysis revealed no difference in survival between treatment groups or randomisation groups. No differences were found when other variables were compared. We conclude, that palliation of obstructive jaundice in malignant bile duct obstruction with endoscopically introduced endoprosthesis is as effective as operative bypass.\r"

  ".W": "Renovascular hypertension is a potentially curable form of high blood pressure. However, it is unclear how best to select patients who are likely to have renovascular hypertension, what diagnostic strategy to use in these selected patients, and how to predict the hemodynamic significance of a renal artery stenosis. We determined the prevalence of renovascular hypertension in adults who exhibited suggestive clinical features. In these clinically selected patients, we then determined the test characteristics of various diagnostic and potential screening tests. Renovascular hypertension was diagnosed if correction of renal artery stenosis resulted in decreased blood pressure. Of the 66 hypertensive adults evaluated, 11 (16.7%) had renovascular hypertension. Captopril-stimulated peripheral renin activity detected renovascular hypertension with 73% sensitivity, 72% specificity, 38% positive predictive value, and 92% negative predictive value. Less optimal combinations of sensitivity and specificity were found for differential glomerular filtration rate renography, differential effective renal plasma flow renography, and selective renal vein renin ratios, each performed after a single dose of captopril. Intravenous digital subtraction renal angiography detected all patients with renovascular hypertension and was normal in 71% of patients with essential hypertension. To evaluate potential screening tests for renovascular hypertension, we calculated predictive values applied to a low prevalence population. If the observed sensitivities and specificities apply to a population with 5% prevalence of renovascular hypertension, captopril-stimulated peripheral renin would have a positive predictive value of 12% and a negative predictive value of 98%. In 16 patients with known renal artery stenosis, neither the captopril-stimulated renal vein renin ratio nor captopril-stimulated differential renography accurately predicted blood pressure response to correction of the stenosis. We conclude that clinical criteria can identify a subgroup with 16.7% prevalence of renovascular hypertension. In this high prevalence group, intravenous digital subtraction renal angiography will identify virtually all patients with renovascular hypertension, and a normal study will be sufficient to exclude renovascular hypertension. In unselected hypertensive patients, screening with captopril-stimulated peripheral renin activity may be the most useful and efficient procedure for identification of patients with renovascular hypertension. Functional tests do not accurately predict the hemodynamic significance of a renal artery stenosis.\r"

Pregnant and lactating SHR were given oral captopril (100 mg/kg/day). After weaning, pups were maintained on captopril (50 mg/kg/day) until the study (19-21 weeks). Control rats received tap water. One week before study captopril-treated and control SHR were given an intracerebroventricular infusion of angiotensin II (7.5 ng/hr, osmotic pump) or vehicle (artificial cerebrospinal fluid). Baroreceptor reflex control of heart rate was assessed by the slope of the relation between the change in mean arterial pressure (mm Hg) versus the change in pulse interval (msec beat-1). Arterial pressure was raised or lowered by intravenous bolus injections of phenylephrine or nitroprusside, respectively. Central infusion of angiotensin II had no significant effect on mean arterial pressure in captopril or control SHR (captopril-angiotensin II 125 +/- 4 vs. captopril-vehicle 121 +/- 2; control-angiotensin II 169 +/- 5 vs. control-vehicle 173 +/- 7 mm Hg), but it produced a significant rise in basal heart rate (captopril-angiotensin II 371 +/- 10 vs. captopril-vehicle 323 +/- 8, p less than 0.0002; control-angiotensin II 338 +/- 7 vs. control-vehicle 312 +/- 8 beats/min, p less than 0.0183) and in daily water intake (captopril-angiotensin II 20.7 +/- 2.2 vs. captopril-vehicle 9.8 +/- 0.7, p less than 0.0426; control-angiotensin II 33.1 +/- 3.8 vs. control-vehicle 9.0 +/- 0.6 ml/100 g body wt, p less than 0.0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Before the infusion, rats were pretreated with vehicle, enalaprilat (an ACE inhibitor), or a cocktail of kininase inhibitors containing 1) enalaprilat, 2) DL-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethyl-thiopropanoic acid (MGTA), a carboxypeptidase N inhibitor, 3) phosphoramidon, a neutral endopeptidase 24.11 inhibitor, and 4) bestatin, an aminopeptidase B inhibitor. In the rats with vehicle (n = 8), the cocktail did not significantly increase endogenous kinins (from 31 +/- 6 to 41 +/- 9 pg/ml, p = 0.94). In the rats infused with bradykinin (peptidase substrate), plasma kinins increased threefold in the group pretreated with the vehicle, 21-fold in the enalaprilat group, and 22-fold in the cocktail group. These increases were doubled by nephrectomy but were not affected by ureteral ligation. In the groups pretreated with the cocktail or enalaprilat, the hypotensive effect of bradykinin was correlated with plasma kinin concentration (r = 0.75, p less than 0.001). After bradykinin infusion was stopped, plasma kinins decreased by half in 10-12 seconds in the rats pretreated with vehicle, enalaprilat, or cocktail. We concluded that ACE and the kidney are important to the metabolism of circulating kinins while carboxypeptidase N, neutral endopeptidase 24.11 and aminopeptidase B are not. We also concluded that other tissue peptidases, not affected by either the above inhibitors or nephrectomy, play an important role in kinin metabolism.\r"

Anesthesia and surgery bring the patient into a complex world in which innumerable small failings can converge to produce an eventual catastrophe. And for all the technology involved, the anesthesiologist remains the cornerstone of safe anesthesia care, protecting the patient from harm regardless of its source. Responding to the demands of the operating room environment requires on-the-spot decision making in a complex, uncertain, and risky setting. Only responsible, professional human beings acting in concert can perform this task; no machine that we devise now or in the foreseeable future will suffice. I have outlined the components of a dynamic decision-making process that successfully protects patients in almost all cases. However, being human, anesthesiologists do make errors along the way--errors we are just beginning to understand. Sometimes these errors are due to faulty vigilance or incompetence, but usually they are made by appropriately trained, competent practitioners. Anesthesiologists can err in many ways, and recognizing these ways makes it easier to analyze the events leading to an anesthetic accident. More importantly, it better equips us to eliminate or minimize them in the future--and this is the real challenge.\r"

Adding this method of assessing the balance of oxygen supply and demand to our standard armamentarium of hemodynamic monitoring may improve our ability to diagnose and treat cardiovascular aberrations at an earlier stage than was previously possible. Through analysis of the Fick equation, it can be seen that SvO2 depends upon the cardiac output, the arterial oxygen saturation, the hemoglobin level, and the rate of oxygen consumption. These are, in turn, affected by a great number of factors (see Fig 8). As seen in the variety of patient care examples cited above, the usefulness of SvO2 monitoring continues to grow. It appears that there are no intrinsic risks associated with SvO2 monitoring beyond those of customary PA monitoring. This new technology provides us with online information not previously available, at an associated cost that needs to be further examined.\r"

For this purpose in vitro and in vivo tests have been carried out in a series of different conditions. In vitro sieving coefficients were near 1 for solutes with molecular weight up to 5000 Daltons. The ultrafiltration coefficient of the device was 5.4 ml/h/mmHg while the value of Kf normalized per square meter was lower than 5 ml/h/mmHg. The geometry of the blood path was adequate even operating at high blood flows without excessive resistance and obligate filtration. This resulted in vivo in a good performance during short dialysis schedules with good clearances of small and large molecules and with no risks of backfiltration. In fact, the low permeability to water permits constant operation with positive transmembrane pressures without excessive ultrafiltration rates. The biocompatibility of the membrane was excellent and high capacity of adsorption for beta-2 microglobulin was demonstrated. These results suggest that these membranes seem to be able to join the advantages of the traditional cellulosic membranes and of the newer synthetic membranes reducing their relative disadvantages.\r"

This bone resorption depended on the surface energy and roughness of the foreign surface, varying with these physical properties rather than with the chemical nature of the material. It is concluded that loosening of orthopaedic implants is likely to be influenced by the surface energy and roughness of the implant.\r"

The effect of the treatment was evaluated in relation to work attendance, pain, disability and movements of the lumbar spine. Patients were examined one hour and two and six weeks after treatment and also completed a questionnaire after three months. A significant improvement was observed in work attendance, pain and disability scores, but this was independent of the treatment given and movements of the lumbar spine were not improved. Of the 70 patients with initial pain relief after injection, 36% reported persisting benefit at the three month follow-up, independent of the mode of treatment given. We conclude that facet joint injection is a non-specific method of treatment and the good results depend on a tendency to spontaneous regression and to the psychosocial aspects of back pain.\r"

Of the 124 tests, there was complete agreement between methods in 107 and only one strain was clearly negative by Christensen's method while positive on Congo red agar. The Congo red method is rapid, sensitive, and reproducible and has the advantage that colonies remain viable on the medium.

Cutaneous drug reactions may be caused by immunosuppressive therapy that commonly includes corticosteroids, cyclosporine, azathioprine, and antithymocyte and antilymphocyte globulins. Immunosuppressive drugs can also potentiate the effects of other carcinogens, such as ultraviolet radiation, that cause premalignant lesions and squamous cell carcinoma. The risk of Kaposi's sarcoma is increased in these immunosuppressed patients, particularly in renal transplant recipients. Oncogenic viruses such as the Epstein-Barr virus have been associated with the development of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in transplant recipients. In transplant patients human papillomavirus infections may be predisposed to malignant transformation, particularly at genital sites. Opportunistic infections caused by bacteria, fungi, viruses, or protozoa are the most common cause of death in transplant recipients. Skin manifestations of infection in immunosuppressed patients may be an important clue to their presence.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the usefulness of the case report literature concerning toxic epidermal necrolysis, we surveyed English-language reports published from January 1966 to April 1987, using epidermal necrolysis as a key word in the MEDLINE database. Of the 345 articles identified, 80 definitely or possibly contained individual case reports of at least 100 words; 59 of these 82 (72%) were available and reviewed. These 59 reports included a total of 73 separate cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis possibly related to drugs, which represents less than 5% of the case of toxic epidermal necrolysis that occurred in this period. In 62% of these 73 cases the apparent purpose of the report was to show an association between a given drug and the development of toxic epidermal necrolysis. The drugs most frequently associated with toxic epidermal necrolysis are allopurinol, the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, phenytoin, and the sulfonamide antibiotics. Given that only a small proportion of cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis appear in the case report literature, except to present association with drugs not previously reported, the contribution of case reports in providing an estimate of the relative risk of drug-associated toxic epidermal necrolysis is limited. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that the adoption of specific diagnostic criteria for and more uniform reporting of signs, symptoms, and therapy could greatly increase the usefulness of the case report literature. We propose a minimum set of informational and specific diagnostic criteria.\r"

Others, like proper darkroom techniques, are universally acknowledged as essential. Still others, like the selection of an image receptor and the selection of the type of examination, are the subject of much discussion and debate. This article addresses some of the more controversial options and choices facing dental practitioners by reviewing the standard assessment techniques available to help make appropriate decisions, by summarizing and analyzing available data, and by offering recommendations for practice.\r"

  ".W": "With the advent of newer methods of activation of the polymerization of denture base resins, there is a need to compare dentures constructed using various modes of activation such as heat, light, and microwave energy. This study compares the dimensional accuracy of a conventional heat-activated acrylic resin poly (methyl methacrylate) with a new pour resin, a visible light-activated resin, and microwave-activated acrylic resin, all polymerized for denture bases. All groups showed a processing contraction; the poorest-fitting group was processed in a brass flask and a water bath at 70-100 C, using a heat-activated resin (Acron); the relatively new light-activated resin (Triad) produced dentures of intermediate accuracy, as did Acupac 20, when either heat- or microwave-activated. The two best-fitting groups were prepared from an autopolymerizing resin (PERform) and the microwave-activated resin (Acron MC).\r"

A mixture of water, alcohol, and glycerol significantly increased the rate of material removal when enamel was cut with diamonds and when dental amalgam was cut with diamonds and carbide burs. In contrast, the rate of material removal for composite resin was significantly faster with use of carbide burs than diamond stones, and the irrigant improved the cutting action for carbide burs. The studies indicate that chemomechanical effects operate with dental substrates, but the effect varies with the material being cut and the cutting tool used. The chemomechanical effects observed here significantly improve the rate of material removal with diamond stones and carbide burs.\r"

Although in some cases systolic and diastolic blood pressure and rate pressure product increased slightly after local anesthetic administration, these changes were not statistically significant. Because these patients were medically supervised and compliant with cardiac therapy, this study suggests that such patients are not at great risk while receiving local anesthesia with 1:100,000 epinephrine for routine dental care.\r"

  ".W": "Cardiac surgery has undergone dramatic advancements during the past 3 decades. The introduction of cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegic arrest ushered in the true era of open heart surgery. Bioprostheses and mechanical valves as well as techniques for valve reconstruction permit routine repair or replacement of stenotic and regurgitant native valves. Progress in the disciplines of mechanical and electrical engineering has led to the development of pocket watch-sized, physiologically responsive pacemakers as well as a variety of circulatory assist devices that include the intraaortic balloon pump, ventricular assist device and total artificial heart. The synthesis of cardiotonic and vasoactive drugs and advancements in anesthetic management, postoperative monitoring and nursing care greatly facilitate perioperative patient management. This summary of state of the art cardiac surgery begins with a brief historical background followed by a review of recent advances in six main categories: coronary artery disease, acquired valvular heart disease, congenital cardiac disease, cardiac transplantation, myocardial preservation and mechanical circulatory assistance. In conducting the review of recent literature, particular attention was directed to large clinical series that document the results of contemporary surgical procedures, novel therapeutic approaches to current clinical problems and unresolved controversies in the field of cardiac surgery. The abundance of surgical literature and constraints on the length of this article do not permit an exhaustive review. Apologies are extended to clinicians and laboratory investigators whose important contributions to the understanding and treatment of cardiac disease are not included herein.\r"

  ".U": "89360268\r", 
  ".W": "Much of the understanding of hypertensive pulmonary vascular disease comes from studies of primary pulmonary hypertension. The three subtypes of primary pulmonary hypertension, plexogenic pulmonary arteriopathy, thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and venoocclusive disease, have served as a basis to understand the mechanisms and to develop treatments of all forms of pulmonary hypertension. However, many inconsistencies regarding presumed pulmonary vasoconstriction and recurrent embolization remain. With newer data on the influence of the endothelium on vascular responsiveness and thrombosis, it appears that older concepts regarding the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension need to be revised. Recent studies have shown that plexogenic pulmonary arteriopathy is associated with abnormalities of endothelial structure and function that could result in impaired release of endothelial derived relaxing factors. Thromboembolic pulmonary arteriopathy, or more properly thrombotic pulmonary hypertension, appears to be the result of endothelial cell injury that creates a procoagulant environment in the pulmonary vascular bed with the development of widespread eccentric intimal proliferation and thrombosis in situ. It is possible that the effectiveness of vasodilator or anticoagulant therapy depends on the nature of the endothelial injury. Secondary pulmonary hypertension without endothelial injury, such as that which occurs with hypoxic lung disease or mitral stenosis, appears more satisfactorily treated when the primary cause is reversed.\r"

  ".W": "Primary pulmonary hypertension is a well described but poorly understood illness. It is a disease of the small muscular pulmonary arteries in which proliferative lesions involving endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts obstruct flow. Aggressive therapy with vasodilator drugs, especially calcium channel blockers, has improved the quality of life in a minority of patients; heart-lung transplantation is feasible for only a few. Rapid developments in the study of vascular biology in the last several years are likely to provide insight into the etiology and pathogenesis of primary pulmonary hypertension. The areas involved include the cell biology of pulmonary vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, studies of integrins, endothelial surface charge, angiogenesis and growth factors, endothelial-derived vasoactive substances, the effects of shear and the role of coagulation at the endothelial surface. The future looks bright for understanding and treating this difficult and cryptic illness.\r"

  ".W": "Between September 1976 and November 1987, 53 patients underwent surgical treatment by the same surgeon for \"complex transposition of the great arteries\" with ventricular septal defect or severe left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, or both. Six patients with transposition and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction underwent atrial rerouting and direct relief of the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Twenty-two patients presented with transposition plus ventricular septal defect; 15 of these patients underwent atrial rerouting and ventricular septal defect closure and 7 underwent an arterial switch procedure. Twenty-five patients presented with transposition plus ventricular septal defect and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, 23 of whom underwent a Rastelli procedure. There were one early death (mortality rate 1.9%; 90% confidence limits 0-7%) and three late deaths (mortality rate 5.8%) during a mean follow-up period of 42 months (range 2 to 124). These results show that 1) atrial rerouting is an appropriate surgical procedure for transposition of the great arteries with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction; 2) the arterial switch procedure provides excellent early correction of transposition with ventricular septal defect and is currently the preferred procedure for this lesion; and 3) the Rastelli procedure can be performed with a low early mortality rate and excellent long-term results for transposition with ventricular septal defect and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of long-term verapamil administration on the consequences of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in mice was studied with regard to animal mortality, morbidity, myocardial pathologic features and myocardial beta-adrenergic adenylate cyclase activity. Verapamil administration dramatically decreased the mortality rate from 60% to 6% during the 70 day period of infection. Three clinical stages of infection were evident. In the acute stage (17 days after infection with maximal parasitemia), verapamil treatment not only decreased the incidence of myocardial disease (fibrosis and inflammation), but also protected myocardial beta-adrenergic adenylate cyclase activity. In addition, there was no increase in total body weight, which was regarded as an index of right-sided heart failure. In the subacute stage (30 to 60 days after infection), administration of verapamil continued to decrease myocardial disease and preserve beta-adrenergic adenylate cyclase activity. In addition, verapamil ameliorated the morbidity and mortality associated with this stage of infection. The chronic stage of infection was characterized by a decrease in myocardial disease and in beta-adrenergic adenylate cyclase activity. Thus, independent of the state of infection, long-term verapamil treatment enhanced beta-adrenergic adenylate cyclase activity. In addition, verapamil ameliorated the morbidity associated with infection. Although the relation among these various effects of verapamil in the setting of T. cruzi infection remains to be determined, collectively the results suggested that verapamil administration attenuated the consequences of T. cruzi infection.\r"
