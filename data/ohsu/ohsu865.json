Gross was an innovative surgeon whose 50-year career as a surgeon caring for injured patients encompassed orthopedics, thoracic surgery, abdominal surgery, and ophthalmology. The dominant influence of Gross over contemporary surgical doctrine was a consequence of his prolific scholarship which included six superbly written texts that passed through a combined total of 15 editions. Gross was a teacher, occupying for 42 years Chairs of Surgery at three medical schools. Gross wore the mantle of political leadership, founding medical societies that continue today as forums for the presentation and review of new treatments for injured patients. Modern academic trauma surgeons could do no better than to emulate the career of Samuel David Gross, the Patriarch of American trauma surgeons.\r"

These procedures are expensive, time-consuming and associated with some morbidity, prompting us to study a less invasive method, high resolution ultrasonography and pulsed wave Doppler ultrasound. We evaluated 13 patients with nonendocrinological, nonneurological erectile dysfunction by high resolution and Doppler ultrasound for flow in the dorsal and cavernosal veins after intracorporeal papaverine. All patients had a nonrigid response to papaverine and a mean maximum cavernous arterial systolic velocity of greater than 25 cm. per second. The 13 patients were subsequently studied by dynamic cavernosometry and cavernosography, which revealed evidence of venous incompetence (12 with dorsal venous leaks and 11 with cavernous venous leaks). Only 5 of the 12 patients with dorsal venous incompetence had flow detected in the dorsal vein by ultrasound and Doppler studies. High resolution and Doppler ultrasound was unable to detect leakage in the cavernous veins. Among the 2 groups of patients with dorsal venous leaks (those with and without flow detectable by Doppler ultrasound) there was no significant difference in mean cavernous artery diameter or mean cavernous arterial maximum velocity. Similarly, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups in induction, maintenance or initial decompression rates on cavernosometry. We conclude that high resolution and Doppler ultrasound cannot replace dynamic cavernosometry and cavernosography as the diagnostic modality for venous incompetence.\r"

  ".W": "During the diagnostic evaluation of patients with vasculogenic impotence duplex scanning has been proposed as a reliable noninvasive method to evaluate the cavernous arteries. However, the sensitivity and specificity of this test have never been elucidated. To provide insight into the clinical value of this test 25 men who presented with impotence and failed to respond to 60 mg. intracavernous papaverine were evaluated with duplex scanning and the results of this modality were compared to penile angiography. The cavernous arteries were considered normal by duplex scanning if the artery demonstrated either a 60% or greater increase in diameter and/or a peak flow velocity of greater than 25 cm. per second 5 minutes after papaverine injection. Penile angiography was considered normal if both cavernous arteries were visualized and appeared to be normal radiographically (after intracorporeal papaverine). In the 25 patients studied there was no significant difference in peak flow velocity between patients with normal or abnormal cavernous arteries by angiography. In addition, arterial dilatation (more than 60%) after papaverine injection did not correlate with the results of the angiogram. These data demonstrate that duplex scanning of the cavernous arteries does not correlate well with what is observed by penile angiography in a selected population of men with vasculogenic erectile dysfunction. Since penile angiography itself has limitations in the evaluation of the penile arteries, the reliability of duplex scanning to identify cavernous artery dysfunction needs additional confirmation.\r"

The upper tract endoscopic procedure provided the diagnosis in all patients, as well as allowed for therapeutic intervention in 19. There was no significant morbidity associated with any procedure. We advocate the continued development of flexible ureteropyeloscopic instrumentation and procedures. We suggest the inclusion of ureteropyeloscopy with tissue sampling of neoplasms in the evaluation of all upper urinary tract lesions, except when diagnostic ultrasound correlates the characteristics and position of the lesion as calculous disease.\r"

Testicular mature and immature teratomas are usually associated with other germ cell tumors. Nongerminal malignancies that tend to occur in gonadal and extragonadal teratomas are often epithelial. Sarcomas of all types are less frequent but embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas are encountered predominantly. This sarcomatous element can be present in the primary excision or it can appear after chemotherapy in the metastases. Usually, prognosis is dependent on the degree of aggressiveness of the sarcomatous component. A review of the literature reveals that it is unusual for an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma to develop on purely mature teratoma. We report a case in the testicle. During followup metastases arise rapidly from the purely embryonal rhabdomyosarcomatous component. The accurate diagnosis of this unusual sarcomatous component is of paramount importance because of the implications for therapy.\r"

Accumulating evidence, although not unanimous, supports the hypothesis of psychoactive substance abuse among adolescents as a risk factor for a range of suicidal behavior--ideation, attempted suicide, and completed suicide. With increasing rates of psychoactive substance abuse for the adolescent population during the past 20 years, this appears to be an increasingly important factor. It is not known if the association is causal. Psychoactive substance abuse appears to be associated with a greater frequency and repetitiveness of suicide attempts, more medically lethal attempts, a measured seriousness of intention, and greater suicidal ideation. Additional data support a specific association between alcohol intoxication and suicide by firearms among adolescents. Adolescents who abuse psychoactive substances, particularly those with any type of depressive disorder, appear to be at higher risk for suicidal behavior and may need appropriate psychiatric treatment.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate mechanisms underlying GFR control in diabetes mellitus, renal hemodynamics and segmental tubular handling of sodium, using lithium clearance, were assessed in 41 insulin-dependent diabetics (IDD) treated by insulin for 11 +/- 8 days, and in 19 normal controls. Average GFR and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were slightly but not significantly higher (136 +/- 22 vs. 123 +/- 16 ml/min.1.73 m2) in IDD than in normal subjects. GFR and ERPF were positively and strongly correlated in controls (r = 0.61, P less than 0.001) and in diabetics (r = 0.72, P less than 0.0001) indicating the marked flow dependency of GFR in both populations. After adjustment for ERPF, GFR was significantly higher in diabetics, suggesting a role of increased glomerular capillary pressure and ultrafiltration coefficient in the subset of \"hyperfiltering\" patients. Both fractional (FPRNa) and absolute (APRNa) proximal sodium reabsorption were significantly higher in IDD and significantly correlated with GFR. The ensuing decrease in sodium distal delivery could deactivate the tubuloglomerular feedback response and thus favor sustained vasodilation and high GFR in some diabetics. The renal effects of acute administration of drugs acting predominantly at either the pre- or the postglomerular resistance using nicardipine (N = 16) or captopril (N = 25) were further evaluated in IDD. The renal response to captopril or nicardipine was different in IDD. Whereas both drugs induced a marked decrease in renal vascular resistance, GFR was slightly decreased by captopril and was unchanged after nicardipine; these results are similar to those observed in normotensive non-diabetic subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90258277\r", 
  ".W": "Fourteen individuals on long term hemodialysis, with varying amounts of aluminum in bone from 11 to 296 mg/kg by flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry, were examined to see whether the aluminon or acid solochrome azurine (ASA) staining reactions best approximated the chemical determination. Correlation coefficients were 0.78 for aluminon and 0.88 for ASA. Together with 11 additional patients morphometric parameters were compared with the two aluminum stains. The aluminon stain gave satisfactory results in the osteomalacic group but underestimated the amount of aluminum present in those with hyperparathyroid, mixed or aplastic disease. Some individuals showed a striking difference between the two techniques which could have led to an erroneous conclusion regarding the amount of aluminum present. The aluminon stain was pH dependent and together with ASA could be enhanced by prior heat treatment of the sections. It is recommended that ASA either replace aluminon for routine use or be used together with the aluminon stain, particularly for bones without osteomalacia or with mild to moderate aluminum storage.\r"

Although this article focuses primarily on workplace risk factors, it discusses them within a framework of biological, psychological, familial, social class and sociocultural risks, and argues that a comprehensive explanation of alcohol problems must encompass all of these factors. In addition, the article argues that by constructing drinking norms, especially within the context of the workplace, these risks may be contained and reduced. Consequently, the article also reviews data on the workplace strategy of constructive confrontation and calls for research on similar interventions for containing risks from outside the workplace.\r"

In 17 of the 45 patients who completed the treatment, Helicobacter pylori was eradicated, and there was no ulcer relapse during the first 12 months of follow-up. The ulcer relapse rate was significantly higher (17 of 21 [89%]) among patients who remained positive for H pylori. 9 patients who remained positive for H pylori and had ulcer relapses within 6 months of treatment with CBS alone, were subsequently given triple therapy. 7 of the 9 showed H pylori eradication and no relapses within the next 12 months. The 2 patients still H pylori-positive after triple therapy had further ulcer relapses. H pylori eradication, without altering acid output, will become the mainstay of duodenal ulcer treatment because it cures the disease.\r"

Oxalate excretion correlated highly with urinary phosphate excretion and with intake of phosphate supplements corrected for body surface area. Young children received the highest relative doses of phosphate (range 2.27-10.8 g/1.73 m2 daily) and their urinary oxalate excretion was very high (0.94-3.38 mmol/1.73 m2 daily). The urinary oxalate excretion of untreated adults with XLH was within normal limits. Six patients had evidence of nephrocalcinosis on ultrasound. The high urinary oxalate excretion in phosphate-supplemented XLH may be seen as a special type of enteric hyperoxaluria, in which the conditions of calcium-oxalate crystal precipitation could be reached even at normal levels of urinary calcium excretion. Urinary excretion of both calcium and oxalate should therefore be monitored during treatment in young XLH patients.\r"

Treatment involves high-dose chemotherapy with or without radiation followed by a transplant of previously cryopreserved stem cells derived from bone marrow or blood. The transplanted bone marrow may be manipulated in vitro to remove CML cells. Results vary. Transplants in advanced CML usually re-establish chronic phase but responses are brief. After transplants in chronic phase some recipients become Philadelphia chromosome negative for a year or more; others remain Ph-chromosome positive. There are insufficient data to show whether these early transplants prolong chronic phase duration or increase survival. The incurability of CML by conventional therapy should encourage further studies of this approach.\r"

Expression of the antigen did not correlate with the histological type of chronic hepatitis, nor with SOLex expression in liver cells, which did correlate with severity of hepatic necrosis and inflammation. Treatment of patients with interferon-alpha increased SOLex expression by Kupffer cells, but not by liver cells, which suggests different means of regulation of SOLex expression in these two cell types. SOLex and HLA class II antigens were expressed simultaneously by Kupffer cells. Expression of SOLex by Kupffer cells (HLA class II antigen-positive) and liver cells (HLA class I antigen-positive) suggests a possible autoimmune response against this carbohydrate antigen in chronic hepatitis.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the activation of blood coagulation in septicemia, a condition commonly associated with intravascular coagulation and disturbances of hemostasis. To evaluate the early dynamics and the route of the in vivo coagulative response to tumor necrosis factor, we performed a controlled study in six healthy men, monitoring the activation of the common and intrinsic pathways of coagulation with highly sensitive and specific radioimmunoassays. Recombinant human tumor necrosis factor, administered as an intravenous bolus injection (50 micrograms per square meter of body-surface area), induced an early and short-lived rise in circulating levels of the activation peptide of factor X, reaching maximal values after 30 to 45 minutes (mean +/- SEM increase after 45 minutes, 34.2 +/- 18.2 percent; tumor necrosis factor vs. saline, P = 0.015). This was followed by a gradual and prolonged increase in the plasma concentration of the prothrombin fragment F1+2, peaking after four to five hours (mean increase after five hours, 348.0 +/- 144.8 percent; tumor necrosis factor vs. saline, P less than 0.0001). These findings signify the formation of factor Xa (activated factor X) and the activation of prothrombin. Activation of the intrinsic pathway could not be detected by a series of measurements of the plasma levels of factor XII, prekallikrein, factor XIIa-C1 inhibitor complexes, kallikrein-C1 inhibitor complexes, and the activation peptide of factor IX. The delay between the maximal activation of factor X and that of prothrombin amounted to several hours, indicating that neutralization of factor Xa activity was slow. We conclude that a single injection of tumor necrosis factor elicits a rapid and sustained activation of the common pathway of coagulation, probably induced through the extrinsic route. Our results suggest that tumor necrosis factor could play an important part in the early activation of the hemostatic mechanism in septicemia.\r"

We examined the effectiveness of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), a program of stretching exercises, or a combination of both for low back pain. Patients with chronic low back pain (median duration, 4.1 years) were randomly assigned to receive daily treatment with TENS (n = 36), sham TENS (n = 36), TENS plus a program of exercises (n = 37), or sham TENS plus exercises (n = 36). After one month no clinically or statistically significant treatment effect of TENS was found on any of 11 indicators of outcome measuring pain, function, and back flexion; there was no interactive effect of TENS with exercise. Overall improvement in pain indicators was 47 percent with TENS and 42 percent with sham TENS (P not significant). The 95 percent confidence intervals for group differences excluded a major clinical benefit of TENS for most outcomes. By contrast, after one month patients in the exercise groups had significant improvement in self-rated pain scores, reduction in the frequency of pain, and greater levels of activity as compared with patients in the groups that did not exercise. The mean reported improvement in pain scores was 52 percent in the exercise groups and 37 percent in the nonexercise groups (P = 0.02). Two months after the active intervention, however, most patients had discontinued the exercises, and the initial improvements were gone. We conclude that for patients with chronic low back pain, treatment with TENS is no more effective than treatment with a placebo, and TENS adds no apparent benefit to that of exercise alone.\r"

  ".U": "90259074\r", 
  ".W": "Mammalian neurons contain at least three types of excitatory amino-acid receptors, selectively activated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) or aspartate, (S)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole proprionate ((S)-AMPA) and kainate. An important aspect of NMDA receptors is their regulation by a variety of factors such as glycine, Mg2+ and Zn2+ that are present in vivo. We show here that NMDA receptor responses are selectively inhibited by protons, with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) that is close to physiological pH, implying that NMDA receptors are not fully active under normal conditions. (S)-AMPA and kainate responses remain unchanged at similar pH levels. Proton inhibition is voltage-insensitive and does not result either from fast channel block, a change in channel conductance, or an increase in the 50% excitatory concentration (EC50) of aspartate/NMDA or glycine. Instead, protons seem to decrease markedly the opening frequency of 30-50 pS NMDA channels, and reduce the relative proportion of longer bursts. This feature of NMDA receptors could be relevant to neurotoxic activation of NMDA receptors during ischaemia, as well as to seizure generation, as extracellular proton changes occur during both of these pathological situations. Furthermore, these results may have implications for normal NMDA receptor function as transient changes in extracellular protons occur during synaptic transmission.\r"

  ".U": "90259077\r", 
  ".W": "Simian immunodeficiency viruses have been isolated from four species of monkey, the 'captive' macaque and mangabey and the 'feral' African green monkey and mandrill. While none of these viruses is a replica of HIV-1, the macaque and mangabey viruses represent correct genetic models for HIV-2, possessing exactly the same complement of genes. Recently a lentivirus has been identified in two wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) in Gabon, west equatorial Africa, and isolated from one of them. This virus is referred to as SIVCPZ. Sera from these animals cross reacted with all the HIV-1 proteins including the envelope glycoproteins. Here, we describe the molecular cloning and sequencing of an infectious proviral clone of SIVCPZ. The overall genetic organization was the same as that of HIV-1, but phylogenetic analysis revealed that the sequence was more divergent than any HIV-1 sequence reported so far. The vpu gene product, found only in the type 1 viruses, was particularly different (64% divergent to HIV-1BRU) suggesting that the SIVCPZ represents a distinct subtype. These findings indicate that there is a larger pool of simian lentiviruses than previously suspected and revives debate as to the origins of HIV-1.\r"

  ".W": "A striking characteristic of many different eukaryotic transcriptional activators is their ability to activate gene expression synergistically. Thus, for example, the rat glucocorticoid receptor and the yeast activator GAL4 cooperatively activate transcription of a mammalian gene bearing binding sites for each of the proteins: activation by both activators is greater than the sum of the effects of each working alone. It would seem unlikely that these two proteins from such different organisms directly interact; rather, the idea has been suggested that these and at least some other eukaryotic activators can work synergistically by simultaneously touching some part of the transcriptional machinery. An important prediction of this idea is that synergy between two such activators would be seen under conditions where each is present at concentrations sufficiently high to saturate its site on DNA. In this paper we use transcription in vitro to confirm that prediction using a derivative of the yeast activator GAL4 and the mammalian transcription factor ATF. The accompanying paper describes a similar conclusion comparing the effects of singly and multiply bound GAL4 molecules.\r"

  ".U": "90259079\r", 
  ".W": "In prokaryotes and eukaryotes many gene activators work synergistically. For example, two dimers of lambda repressor interact to promote binding of these proteins to DNA, a reaction that is crucial at the repressor concentrations found in lysogens. In this case one of the bound dimers activates transcription, evidently by touching RNA polymerase. In another example, the yeast transcriptional activator GAL4, which can stimulate transcription in many eukaryotes, binds to multiple sites on DNA to activate transcription synergistically; the presence of two such sites can elicit a level of transcription more than twice that found with a single site. In this paper we show that synergistic activation by each of several GAL4 derivatives involves a mechanism different from that illustrated by the lambda repressor: multiple activator molecules can work synergistically under conditions in which their binding sites on DNA are saturated. The accompanying paper shows that under similar conditions of activator excess, GAL4 derivatives work synergistically with a heterologous mammalian gene activator. These results support the idea that eukaryotic activators can cooperate not by directly interacting but by simultaneously touching some component(s) of the transcriptional machinery.\r"

  ".W": "Mice homozygous for the recessive mutation osteopetrosis (op) on chromosome 3 have a restricted capacity for bone remodelling, and are severely deficient in mature macrophages and osteoclasts. Both cell populations originate from a common haemopoietic progenitor. As op/op mice are not cured by transplants of normal bone marrow cells, the defects in op/op mice may be associated with an abnormal haematopoietic microenvironment rather than with an intrinsic defect in haematopoietic progenitors. To investigate the molecular and biochemical basis of the defects caused by the op mutation, we established primary fibroblast cell lines from op/op mice and tested the ability of these cell lines to support the proliferation of macrophage progenitors. We show that op/op fibroblasts are defective in production of functional macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), although its messenger RNA (Csfm mRNA) is present at normal levels. This defect in M-CSF production and the recent mapping of the Csfm structural gene near op on chromosome 3 suggest that op is a mutation within the Csfm gene itself. We have sequenced Csfm complementary DNA prepared from op/op fibroblasts and found a single base pair insertion in the coding region of the Csfm gene that generates a stop codon 21 base pairs downstream. Thus, the op mutation is within the Csfm coding region and we conclude that the pathological changes in this mutant result from the absence of M-CSF.\r"

The ovary was the primary site in 165 (78.7%) of the cases, whereas extragonadal sites represented 44 (21.3%). Endometrioid adenocarcinomas accounted for 69% of the lesions, clear-cell carcinomas 13.5%, sarcomas 11.6%, and rare cell types 6%. Extragonadal lesions were mostly endometrioid tumors (66%) and sarcomas (25%). Tumors arising in endometriosis were predominantly low grade and confined to the site of origin. Radiation therapy was often able to control completely tumors limited to the pelvis, but was not beneficial in metastatic disease. Only one patient had a response to chemotherapy. Fourteen patients received postoperative progestin therapy, with a 77% 5-year survival. Follow-up has been reported in 86 patients. The tumor was either confined to the ovary (57), confined to the extragonadal site of origin (11), or spread throughout the peritoneal cavity (18). With each of these situations, the 5-year survival was 65, 100, and 10%, respectively. Fourteen patients had malignant transformation in endometriosis associated with presumed estrogenic stimulation; most lesions (69%) were well differentiated and the 5-year survival was 82%. After surgical resection, we recommend that progestin therapy be included in the treatment of cancer arising in endometriosis. The actual frequency of malignancy arising in endometriosis may be higher than reported.\r"

Blood glucose levels were evaluated weekly in a high-risk clinic where medical and nutritional support and counseling were provided. Among 68 women successfully treated for a minimum of 6 weeks, the mean birth weight, macrosomia rate, and ponderal index were reduced significantly in the insulin-treated group. Insulin reduced birth weights significantly in women with a delivery weight of 200 lb or more (4060 +/- 342 versus 3397 +/- 640 g) and in those with a delivery weight less than 200 lb (3324 +/- 448 versus 3047 +/- 394 g). No patient with good glucose control and a maternal delivery weight under 200 lb had a newborn over 4000 g. Patients failing glycemic control were at greatest risk (30%) for fetal overgrowth whether initially receiving insulin or not. Maternal obesity or failure to achieve glycemic control should alert the clinician to a substantially increased risk of macrosomia.\r"

Therefore, we designed this study to define polyhydramnios using the amniotic fluid index of greater than 2 SDs above the mean for late second- to third-trimester pregnancies, or 24 cm or greater. One hundred twelve nondiabetic women referred to Women's Hospital, Los Angeles County/University of Southern California Medical Center with the descriptive diagnosis of polyhydramnios made by experienced ultrasonographers were included in the study. There was poor correlation between these descriptions and fetal outcome. Twenty-six were qualitatively described as having severe, 29 as moderate, and 57 as mild polyhydramnios. Forty-nine of the 112 patients met our definition of significant polyhydramnios by having an amniotic fluid index of 24 cm or more. This particular definition allowed the inclusion of all fetuses with serious structural defects and/or death. Seven patients had an amniotic fluid index less than 24 cm, but with the traditional quantitative definition of one pocket of 8 cm or more; none of these patients had poor fetal outcome. These data appear to suggest that the use of descriptive definitions of polyhydramnios or a single fluid pocket of 8 cm or greater should be discarded in favor of using an amniotic fluid index of 24 cm or more. Once the diagnosis of polyhydramnios is made, the patient should have a detailed sonographic evaluation, be offered cytogenetic studies, and have antepartum surveillance.\r"

The anterior edge of the probe was placed 0.5 to 1.5 mm posterior to the limbus, using 7 to 9 W of power for 0.7 seconds with 32 to 40 applications, sparing the 3 and 9 o'clock meridians. Patients were studied prospectively. The mean preoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) of 36.7 +/- 0.97 mmHg decreased to 21.2 +/- 0.99 mmHg (P = 0.004) after treatment (mean follow-up, 3.2 +/- 0.35 months) for a mean decrease in IOP of 15.5 +/- 1.21 mmHg and a mean percent decrease of 39%. Forty-one eyes were followed 6 or more months (mean, 6.7 +/- 0.25 months). The CYC reduced IOP to 25 mmHg or less in 71% of eyes, to 22 mmHg or less in 62% of eyes, and to 19 mmHg or less in 49% of eyes. Maximum lowering of IOP occurred 1 week to 1 month after treatment and remained at that level through 6 months of follow-up. Retreatment was required in 11% of patients; only one patient was retreated more than once. Four patients treated with 9 W of power developed IOPs below 5 mmHg; two of these patients had an IOP of 0 mmHg. Other complications of therapy were minimal, and patients had little pain. There was no significant change in visual acuity. Early results of this newly available therapy are encouraging.\r"

IgE-positive material was found in association with the majority of leukocytes and with muscle fibers. Parallel sections reacted with anti-IgM antibody were negative, whereas anti-IgG produced diffuse staining with no specific structures highlighted. Control, non-Graves' tissues had no evidence of immune cell activity and were either negative or displayed reactions with anti-IgE reagents that were in most cases different from those of Graves' tissue.

No systemic therapy was used in three patients, three patients received oral ketoconazole, and two patients received oral flucytosine postoperatively. Intravenous amphotericin B was not used because of lack of evidence of disseminated candidiasis and the systemic toxicity associated with its use. The ECE responded favorably to treatment in all cases. Final vision was better in patients with a shorter interval between onset of symptoms and initiation of antifungal therapy. Posttreatment visual acuities were: four eyes greater than or equal to 20/50, two eyes at 20/80 to 20/200, and two eyes less than 5/200. This series showed that ECE without evidence of disseminated disease can be treated successfully with vitrectomy and intravitreal amphotericin B.\r"

Hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, a high waist-hip ratio of body fat distribution, and certain psychosocial factors, while they pose risks for both men and women, have aspects that are unique to women. Clinicians need to identify the gender-related aspects of CAD and intervene aggressively to minimize the special risks to their women patients.\r"

The most important factor that influences therapeutic outcome is the development of metastasis to the cervical lymph nodes. Traditionally, assessment and staging have been based on clinical evaluation. Studies of clinicopathologic correlation have demonstrated that both the sensitivity and the specificity of the clinical examination findings are unsatisfactorily low in that false-negative rates may be 15%-25% while false-positive rates may be similarly high. The clinician is caught in the position of having to overtreat many patients to avoid undertreating a few. The rapid advances in imaging technology introduced in the past decade have greatly affected our ability to identify cervical metastatic disease. With improved technology and increased experience, patients can be better characterized individually according to the status of the cervical lymph nodes so that therapeutic intervention can be appropriately designed.\r"

To prospectively ascertain the accuracy and limitations of this technique, CDFI was performed in 75 lower limbs of 69 consecutive patients referred for venographic evaluation of clinically suspected lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT). The CDFI study was obtained within 24 hours of the contrast venogram. Both studies were interpreted without knowledge of the patient's clinical findings or the results of the other test. Contrast venography was regarded as the standard for diagnosis of DVT. Accuracy was 99% for detection of DVT above the knee and 81% below the knee. Sonographic evaluation of the calf veins was technically adequate in 60% of limbs; accuracy was 98% in this group. In the 40% of limbs with technically limited CDFI studies of the calf, accuracy decreased to 57%. Although small nonocclusive thrombi occurred infrequently in this series of symptomatic patients, CDFI missed three of four such thrombi. It is concluded that CDFI, when not technically compromised, is sufficiently accurate to definitively diagnose symptomatic lower extremity DVT.\r"

A normal compression US examination is considered indicative of no thrombotic disease, and anticoagulant therapy is withheld. There are no long-term data supporting treatment decisions based solely on normal compression US results. The authors undertook a long-term (8-33-month) review of 1,111 normal compression US examinations performed on 1,022 patients. Outcome analysis obtained through review of imaging records, inpatient charts, and death certificates failed to document sequelae of untreated DVT in all but five patients with negative examinations. Three patients again presented with clinical symptoms of DVT that were subsequently documented with compression US, and two patients reportedly died of pulmonary embolism with no documentation of DVT several months after the initial negative study. Because of the clinical acceptance of this test and the subsequent increased demand for its use, compression US has quadrupled the yearly detection rate of DVT at the authors' institution. With the results of prior controlled studies and this favorable outcome analysis study, compression US is recommended as the diagnostic modality of choice for suspected DVT.\r"

Thirteen patients were imaged. The diagnosis of spontaneous (or \"effort\") thrombosis was made clinically and confirmed initially at venography (n = 11) or at technetium-99m dynamic scintigraphy (n = 2). After therapy, follow-up imaging with color Doppler flow US and venography was performed in all 13 patients for correlation. Absence of flow signals was noted in five patients with complete occlusion of the subclavian vein, and decreased flow signal was seen in two patients with partial obstruction of the subclavian vein. In five patients, findings returned to normal at color Doppler flow US and venography, and patent collateral veins were seen in one patient. The authors conclude that color Doppler flow US is useful in evaluating venous thrombosis in the upper extremity and might be preferable to venography for follow-up because the discomfort of injection and risk of contrast material-induced phlebitis are eliminated.\r"

Nineteen of these 22 patients were followed up for an average of 18 weeks, and only three were found to be free of residual fragments at US. The other three patients were lost to follow-up. Sixteen patients are still undergoing biliary ESWL. Comparison of calcified and noncalcified gallbladder calculi revealed that calcified stones required 50% more shock waves for successful fragmentation, fragments cleared considerably more slowly from the gallbladder, and patients had a higher frequency of acute pancreatitis (5% vs 2%) and transient hematuria (8% vs 3%). Stones with dense homogeneous calcification required significantly fewer shock waves for successful fragmentation than stones with calcific lamination. ESWL can be applied occasionally in patients with calcific cholecystolithiasis if an alternative to surgery is required, but success has been limited.\r"

After administration of anesthesia and laparotomy, biopsies were performed under direct vision with a cutting biopsy needle (a) alone, (b) fitted with the PPS, or (c) fitted with a thrombin-coated PPS. Dry sponges were applied and subsequently weighted to quantitate blood loss. At all levels of anticoagulation, use of the PPS enhanced hemostasis; the thrombin coating supplemented effectiveness. The PPS appears to be a simple and effective method of achieving hemostasis at high-risk percutaneous biopsy.\r"

The results of the imaging studies were compared with the surgical and pathologic findings by means of a lesion-by-lesion analysis. A total of 34 masses were identified in the resected specimens: 18 main tumor masses and 16 intrahepatic metastases. For CTAP, the detection rate of main tumors was 94%; for iodized-oil CT, 82%. However, the daughter-nodule detection rates for both techniques were poor-only 38% detected for CTAP and 50% for iodized-oil CT. Although these two techniques remain important preoperative imaging methods in patients with HCC, the results of this study suggest that small daughter nodules (less than 5 mm in diameter) may go undetected with both techniques.\r"

Antegrade flow in the RMCA continued uninterrupted in all patients at the moment of ligation. Peak systolic velocity decreased initially and then increased to 70% of baseline levels in the following 3-5 minutes. End diastolic velocity remained relatively unchanged at the time of ligation and rose slightly above baseline during the following 3-5 minutes. This study demonstrates that at the time of RCCA ligation, collateral flow is immediately established in the RMCA distribution and is further augmented within minutes.\r"

All studies were obtained prior to and following preoperative chemotherapy. Static MR imaging was of little value for assessment of response; reduction in signal intensity within soft-tissue masses on the T2-weighted spin-echo images indicated response with a sufficient degree of accuracy (71%) but low sensitivity, whereas an increase in signal intensity after Gd-DTPA administration indicated zones of viable tissue with low specificity. With three-phase skeletal scintigraphy, the findings in the perfusion and blood-pool phases were of no value, whereas the findings in the osseous phase allowed the prediction of response with an accuracy of 73.7%. Of all techniques employed, dynamic MR imaging had the highest degree of accuracy (85.7%) and was superior to scintigraphy, particularly in patients who were receiving intraarterial chemotherapy.\r"

Color Doppler flow imaging demonstrated a lack of intratesticular flow in six of the seven testes with torsion and relatively normal intratesticular flow in one of the patients with acute torsion. Normal or increased intratesticular flow was demonstrated by color Doppler in all 57 of the nonischemic testes. Using the single criterion of presence or absence of identifiable intratesticular flow, the authors found that color Doppler was 86% sensitive, 100% specific, and 97% accurate in the diagnosis of torsion and ischemia in the painful scrotum. Color Doppler sonography is an accurate, noninvasive means of rapidly assessing perfusion of the testis in the painful scrotum.\r"

After a total of 36 injections in all eight patients, there were no complications. Follow-up ranged from 2 to 10 months. After therapy, symptoms subsided and hormonal levels became normal or reached the range of subclinical hypothyroidism. Scintigrams showed that the previously suppressed thyroid tissue had resumed functioning. At US, all nodules had shrunk. PEI was risk free and easy to perform. If these preliminary results are confirmed in a larger study with longer follow-up, the new treatment may become an alternative to surgical or radioiodine ablation of autonomous thyroid nodules.\r"

  ".U": "90260628\r", 
  ".W": "The 70-kilodalton family of heat shock proteins (Hsp 70) has been implicated in posttranslational protein assembly and translocation. Binding of cytosolic forms of Hsp 70 (Hsp 72,73) with nascent proteins in the normal cell was investigated and found to be transient and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent. Interaction of Hsp 72,73 with newly synthesized proteins appeared to occur cotranslationally, because nascent polypeptides released prematurely from polysomes in vivo can be isolated in a complex with Hsp 72,73. Moreover, isolation of polysomes from short-term [35S]Met-labeled cells (pulsed) revealed that Hsp 72,73 associated with nascent polypeptide chains. In cells experiencing stress, newly synthesized proteins coimmunoprecipitated with Hsp 72,73; however, in contrast to normal cells, interaction with Hsp 72,73 was not transient. A model consistent with these data suggests that under normal growth conditions, cytosolic Hsp 72,73 interact transiently with nascent polypeptides to facilitate proper folding, and that metabolic stress interferes with these events.\r"

Three second-site mutations that suppress the lethality caused by the absence of abl function have been isolated, and all three map to the gene enabled (ena). The mutations are recessive embryonic lethal mutations but act as dominant mutations to compensate for the neural defects of abl mutants. Thus, mutations in a specific gene can compensate for the absence of a tyrosine kinase.\r"

In vivo the carboxyl-terminal third of the CDC25 gene product is sufficient for the activation of adenylate cyclase. The 3'-terminal part of SCD25, a gene of S. cerevisiae structurally related to CDC25, can suppress the requirement for CDC25. Partially purified preparations of the carboxy-terminal domain of the SCD25 gene product enhanced the exchange rate of guanosine diphosphate (GDP) to guanosine triphosphate (GTP) of pure RAS2 protein by stimulating the release of GDP. This protein fragment had a similar effect on the human c-H-ras-encoded p21 protein. Thus, the SCD25 carboxyl-terminal domain can enhance the regeneration of the active form of RAS proteins.\r"

The boundaries and structures of membrane-embedded domains in integral membrane proteins can be determined by a method based on a combination of site-specific mutagenesis and nitroxide spin labeling. The application to one polypeptide segment in bacteriorhodopsin, a transmembrane chromoprotein that functions as a light-driven proton pump is described. Single cysteine residues were introduced at 18 consecutive positions (residues 125 to 142). Each mutant was reacted with a specific spin label and reconstituted into vesicles that were shown to be functional. The relative collision frequency of each spin label with freely diffusing oxygen and membrane-impermeant chromium oxalate was estimated with power saturation EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) spectroscopy. The results indicate that residues 129 to 131 form a short water-exposed loop, while residues 132 to 142 are membrane-embedded. The oxygen accessibility for positions 131 to 138 varies with a periodicity of 3.6 residues, thereby providing a striking demonstration of an alpha helix. The orientation of this helical segment with respect to the remainder of the protein was determined.\r"

Yet, these observations do not define the timing of ras oncogene activation in the multistep process of carcinogenesis. To ascertain the timing of ras oncogene activation, an animal model system was devised that involves the induction of mammary carcinomas in rats exposed at birth to the carcinogen nitrosomethylurea. High-resolution restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified ras sequences revealed the presence of both H-ras and K-ras oncogenes in normal mammary glands 2 weeks after carcinogen treatment and at least 2 months before the onset of neoplasia. These ras oncogenes can remain latent within the mammary gland until exposure to estrogens, demonstrating that activation of ras oncogenes can precede the onset of neoplasia and suggesting that normal physiological proliferative processes such as estrogen-induced mammary gland development may lead to neoplasia if the targeted cells harbor latent ras oncogenes.\r"

In addition, the PMCs were microinjected into PMC-depleted recipient embryos at different developmental stages and their effect on SMC fate was examined. The critical interaction between PMCs and SMCs was brief and took place late in gastrulation. Before that time, SMCs were insensitive to the suppressive signals transmitted by the PMCs.\r"

Given the large number of vaccinees, many of whom wear contact lenses, reported cases of significant adverse reactions are sparse. No studies have directly addressed the ocular sensitivity issue. For two years, we monitored an immunization program for hospital employees. Ten employees (2.2%) gave a history of ocular sensitivity to thimerosal. Nine were vaccinated, without untoward reactions. This small series does not resolve the safety issue and should not be so interpreted. Likewise, the question of danger remains unanswered. If others administering the vaccine would ask the proper questions, sufficient numbers could be generated and reported that would either support the contraindication, or lead to a change in its present wording.\r"

No skin incision or skull opening is required. Lars Leksell originally defined the concept and over a prolonged research and development period created the \"Gamma Knife.\" The Gamma Knife is a self-contained unit with 201 cobalt 60 sources arranged in a hemispheric array such that the emitted beams of radiation reach a common point of intersection. Interchangeable collimating devices allow variation of the diameter of the 50% isodose distribution from 5.0 to 24.2 mm. Larger radiation dose distributions can be achieved by multiple overlapping exposures. Initial radiation dose rate is between 300 and 400 cGy/min. Obliteration of arteriovenous malformations has been shown angiographically in 80% to 86% of optimally treated patients two years later. Growth arrest or actual decrease in tumor size has occurred in 86% of acoustic neuromas treated. Other lesions treated with the Gamma Knife have included pituitary adenomas, craniopharyngiomas, pineal region tumors, and ocular melanomas, as well as functional disorders.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical presentation of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) is the result of gastrin hypersecretion and may be modified by secondary peptide hypersecretion. Treatment is medical (H2-blockers) or surgical (tumor excision and total gastrectomy). H2-blocker escape occurs up to 23 per cent and surgical mortality ranges to 15 per cent. Treatment of advanced disease has limited success. Sandostatin (SMS 201-995) has been shown to decrease basal gastrin and gastric acid secretion in ZES. We hypothesized that SMS would suppress basal and provoked gastrin and secondary peptide secretion in ZES. A patient with refractory, metastatic gastrinoma underwent provocative testing (test meal, calcium infusion, secretion bolus and tolbutamide bolus). Thirteen peptides were drawn at set intervals during these provocative tests. Testing was repeated during SMS therapy (100 micrograms subcutaneously three times per day). Gastrin, pancreatic polypeptide (PP) and glucagon levels were elevated at baseline. SMS suppressed all three peptides (mean 74 per cent) (p less than 0.05). Gastrin, PP and glucagon were provoked by all four tests (means above baseline, 19, 155 and 138 per cent, respectively). Gastrin-releasing peptide, gastric inhibitory peptide and insulin were provoked by calcium infusion (427, 306 and 162 per cent above baseline, respectively). SMS suppressed 14 of 15 of these peaked-provoked peptide levels (mean 72.5 per cent, p less than 0.05). Gastric analysis during calcium infusion showed SMS suppression of hourly gastric secretory volume by 77.5 per cent and of acid production (milliequivalents of acid) by 87.5 per cent. During a 20 month follow-up period, the patient was maintained on SMS, 200 micrograms subcutaneously three times per day. She has remained asymptomatic. Interval peptide profiles at two, eight and 18 months show normal gastrin, PP and glucagon levels. A computed tomographic scan at eight months shows a remarkable regression of primary and metastatic tumor. Regrowth, however, was noted at 19 months. SMS may be useful in ZES by suppressing basal and provoked gastrin and secondary peptide secretion and may occasionally give palliation by yielding temporary tumor registration.\r"

  ".W": "Right atrial volume (RAV) and other hemodynamic parameters were measured in ten anesthetized swine with an impedance catheter in the right atrium during ventilation and increasing levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to determine the effects of PEEP on right atrial dynamics. RAV and cardiac output (CO) decreased progressively during ventilation with 5, 10 and 15 centimeters of water PEEP, whereas central venous pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure increased. Despite this decrease in RAV, atrial ejection fraction increased significantly and active atrial output (AAO equals stroke volume times heart rate) was maintained. Thus, the decrease in CO resulted from a decrease in the passive component of ventricular filling. Compensatory increases in AAO helped to minimize the fall in CO in some swine (r = 0.73, p less than 0.01). Peripheral adenocorticotropin (ACTH) increased from 14.0 +/- 4.5 picograms per milliliter at zero centimeters of water PEEP to 46.8 +/- 18.3 picograms per milliliter at 10 centimeters of water PEEP (p less than 0.05). Volume expansion that restored CO to control levels despite PEEP led to a significant increase in RAV and in passive ventricular filling, as well as a decrease in ACTH to 11.2 +/- 1.5 picograms per milliliter (p less than 0.05). Changes in the ACTH levels correlated with changes in the RAV (r = 0.58, p less than 0.05), but did not correlate with changes in CO, arterial pressure or central venous pressure. The data herein suggest that the decrease in CO with PEEP results from decreased venous return, RAV and passive ventricular filling, whereas a compensatory increase in right atrial contractility helps to maintain CO. Ventilation with PEEP stimulates hormonal secretion that can be terminated by adequate volume expansion.\r"

Risk factors for uveitis in JRA patients are: female gender, pauciarticular onset of arthritis, presence of circulating antinuclear antibodies, and the antigens HLA-DW5 and HLA-DPw2. Uveitis is rare after seven years or more have elapsed from the onset of arthritis. The visual prognosis in patients with uveitis is good in 25% and fair in 50%. The remaining 25% develop visual impairment from complicated cataract and/or secondary inflammatory glaucoma. The potential benefit of cytotoxic agents in the treatment of intractable uveitis is outweighed by the risk of serious side effects. The management of secondary inflammatory glaucoma is unsatisfactory, but the results of treatment of complicated cataracts by lensectomy-vitrectomy are good.\r"

Although much effort has been put forth in the last century, there is still no method of correcting myopia which is broadly acceptable as safe and effective. The nonsurgical procedures of orthokeratology and the topical use of cycloplegics have not been well proven. Surgical measures are the current vectors of hope. Surgical procedures on parts of the eye other than the cornea have proven to be difficult. Surgery which alters the refractive power of the cornea (refractive keratoplasty) has been used frequently in the past decade. These procedures include keratomileusis, epikeratophakia and radial keratotomy. The latter is currently the most often performed method for the correction of myopia. This paper critiques the major methods, explains their historical development and basic procedures, lists major published studies and discusses their problems and promise for their future.\r"

In spite of long usage, clinical success in controlling pain in many settings appears to be limited by a lack of understanding of the clinical pharmacology of these agents. Efforts to achieve better outcomes often focus on the use of adjunctive agents, such as hydroxyzine, in an attempt to control postoperative pain with a minimum of toxicity. Although such combined therapies are exceedingly common, clinical data supporting a hypothesis of an \"opioid-sparing\" effect of hydroxyzine are marked by serious methodologic flaws, including lack of placebo control, lack of statistical analyses, and use of subjective assessments, all of which compromise the validity of such conclusions. In doses that may contribute to pain relief, hydroxyzine demonstrates a significant potential for causing respiratory depression which is additive to that of opioids, but not reversible with naloxone. In total, the data do not confirm the purported clinical benefits of hydroxyzine-opioid combinations in comparison with appropriate regimens of opioids alone.\r"

Activity of cefixime against Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, Listeria monocytogenes, and Pseudomonas spp. is poor. The relatively long elimination half-life of cefixime (approximately 3.0 h) has made possible once- to twice-daily administration with the potential added benefit of improved patient compliance. Clinical trials indicate that cefixime is at least as effective as standard agents in the treatment of genitourinary and upper respiratory tract infections. The incidence of resistant organisms reported during clinical trials with cefixime was low. Adverse reactions observed during clinical trials were relatively uncommon and generally mild and transient in nature.

  ".U": "90261196\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on renal hemodynamics vary widely depending on the preexisting physiologic and pathologic state of the kidneys. Although some studies of ACE inhibitors in primary essential hypertension have demonstrated increases in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow in patients with renal impairment, other studies have not shown these same beneficial results. The difference may involve the choice of ACE inhibitor used in the investigations, but controlled comparison trials are needed to determine whether this is the case. The use of ACE inhibitors in renovascular hypertension remains controversial. ACE inhibition can interfere with the autoregulation of GFR mediated by angiotensin II and may lead to deterioration of renal function, especially in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of a solitary kidney. Additionally, ACE inhibitors have been shown to cause a decline in GFR in the kidney affected by the stenosis, whether or not clinically apparent renal insufficiency occurs. Although the functional impairment associated with ACE inhibitors in renal artery stenosis has generally been reversible following removal of the drug, the consequences of a long-term reduction in GFR are unknown. Treatment of stable congestive heart failure (CHF) with ACE inhibitors can result in enhancement of GFR and reduction of sodium and fluid retention, thus improving the clinical state. However, in patients with decompensated cardiac failure, renal perfusion pressures may already be at or near the autoregulatory breakpoint and ACE inhibition may cause deterioration of renal function. In general, ACE inhibitors can be used safely in CHF if they are initiated cautiously, with adjustment of ACE inhibitor and diuretic dosages to avoid systemic hypotension and sodium and fluid depletion. In studies comparing the agents, enalapril and lisinopril have both been shown to cause higher incidences of renal function deterioration than has captopril. These findings suggest that the more complete or sustained ACE inhibition seen with the longer-acting agents may be detrimental to renal function in patients with CHF. The use of ACE inhibitors in the treatment of proteinuria is the newest area of research with these agents. At present it appears that ACE inhibitors reduce urinary protein excretion the most effectively in diabetic patients with mild proteinuria and in hypertensive patients with renal insufficiency and proteinuria due to glomerular disorders. More study is needed to determine whether these agents can reduce the rate of renal failure progression and to define the patient populations expected to benefit most.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, adverse effects, and dosages of the three currently available angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are reviewed. This class of agents effectively inhibits the conversion of angiotensin I to the active vasoconstrictor angiotensin II, a hormone that also promotes, via aldosterone stimulation, increased sodium and water retention. The ACE inhibitors, therefore, are capable of lowering blood pressure primarily by promoting vasodilatation and reducing intravascular fluid volume. Captopril, the first orally active, commercially available ACE inhibitor, is a sulfhydryl-containing compound. Captopril was followed by the introduction of enalapril and lisinopril, two non-sulfhydryl ACE inhibitors. The pharmacokinetic profiles of these three ACE inhibitors differ. Captopril has rapid onset with relatively short duration of action, whereas enalapril and lisinopril have slower onset and relatively long duration of action. Captopril is an active ACE inhibitor in its orally absorbable parent form. In contrast, enalapril must be deesterified in the liver to the metabolite enalaprilat in order to inhibit the converting enzyme; this accounts for its delayed onset of action. Lisinopril does not require metabolic activation to be effective; however, a slow and incomplete absorption pattern explains the delay in onset of activity. Captopril and its disulfide metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine with minor elimination in the feces. Approximately two-thirds of an administered enalapril dose is excreted in the urine as both the parent drug and the metabolite enalaprilat; the remainder of these two substances are excreted in the feces. Lisinopril does not undergo measurable metabolism and approximately one-third is excreted unchanged in the urine with the remaining parent drug being excreted in the feces. The ACE inhibitors lower systemic vascular resistance with a resultant decrease in blood pressure. Their efficacy is comparable to diuretics and beta-blockers in treating patients with mild, moderate, or severe essential and renovascular hypertension. In those patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF) the ACE inhibitors produce a reduction in systemic vascular resistance, blood pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and pulmonary artery pressure. These drugs may produce improvement in cardiac output and stroke volume and, with chronic administration, may promote regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. The antihypertensive effects of the ACE inhibitors are enhanced when these agents are combined with a diuretic. Captopril and enalapril have been shown to be of particular benefits as adjunctive therapy in patients with congestive heart failure, both in terms of subjective improvement of patient symptoms, and in improving overall hemodynamic status.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Concern continues to be expressed about the lipid-altering effects of their long-term use, especially beta blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity such as propranolol. Data collected for the Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial, the largest long-term clinical trial of beta-blocker use in patients after MI, have been analyzed to address the following questions. To what extent does propranolol alter lipid levels at least 6 months after MI and initiation of therapy? How predictive of subsequent coronary events and mortality are lipid levels 6 months after MI? Is there any evidence that altered lipid levels attenuate any of the beneficial effect of propranolol on coronary morbidity and mortality? By the 6-month post-MI visit, propranolol was shown to raise serum triglyceride levels by about 17% (approximately equal to 35 mg/dl) and lower serum high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by about 6% (approximately equal to 3 mg/dl). There was no effect on total cholesterol or low density lipoprotein cholesterol. In other analyses, no lipid measured 6 months after the MI was strongly predictive of subsequent coronary events or mortality. For example, every 1-mg-lower HDL value was associated with only a 0.7% relative increase in the mortality rate. Theoretically, the estimated relative increase on all-cause mortality associated with propranolol-induced HDL reduction is about 2%. In multivariate analyses adjusting for changes in HDL and serum triglyceride, propranolol-induced beneficial reductions in mortality and morbidity remained on the order of 20%, 10 times the estimated hazard.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-three men with stable exercise-induced angina pectoris entered a randomized, double-blind, crossover study in which controlled-release isosorbide-5-mononitrate 60 mg once daily was compared with conventional isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg 3 times daily. Each drug was given for 2 weeks. Twenty-eight patients completed the study and data on exercise variables are available in 23 patients. Treatment with either drug resulted in significant antianginal effects, when measured 6 hours after a single dose and after 2 weeks of therapy compared with baseline placebo; however, there were significantly fewer signs of myocardial ischemia during treatment with isosorbide-5-mononitrate. There was no evidence of tolerance to either drug treatment but a significant attenuation of resting blood pressure (but not of exercise blood pressure) was observed with both drugs. Headache was the only clinically significant adverse event during therapy and it occurred more frequently in the isosorbide dinitrate treatment group (p less than 0.05 vs placebo); 3 such patients had to withdraw from the study because of headache. Thus, once-daily, controlled-release isosorbide-5-mononitrate appears as effective as conventional isosorbide dinitrate 3 times daily in patients with stable angina pectoris. The once-daily administration is convenient and improves patient compliance.\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective study the significance of silent ischemia was evaluated in 66 patients with a clinical diagnosis of unstable angina (no requirement for reversible ST-T changes during pain on 12-lead electrocardiograms before entry), and the results of continuous 2-channel electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings, begun within 24 hours of admission, were compared with other clinical and ECG predictors of adverse outcome. Ischemic changes were detected in 7 patients (11%) during a mean of 41 hours of recording. There were 37 episodes of transient ST-segment change (16 ST elevation, 21 ST depression) of which 11 (30%) were symptomatic and 26 (70%) were silent. All 7 patients had at least 1 silent episode and 5 also had symptomatic episodes during the recording but only 2 patients had exclusively silent episodes. During a mean follow-up of 13.3 months, 3 patients died, 5 had a nonfatal myocardial infarction and 32 required revascularization. Although transient myocardial ischemia during the continuous ECG recording, whether silent or symptomatic, was a specific predictor of subsequent nonfatal myocardial infarction or death (specificity 92%), its sensitivity for these events was low (25%). In contrast, recurrent rest pain (greater than or equal to 1 episode) occurred in all patients with these serious adverse events (sensitivity 100%, specificity 49%). Transient ischemia occurs infrequently during continuous ECG recordings in patients with unstable angina not selected by reversible ST-T changes on a 12-lead electrocardiogram at entry. Recurrent rest pain after hospital admission is a more sensitive predictor of serious events in this group.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-five patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) underwent a double-blind randomized study of the acute hemodynamic effects of orally administered nicorandil, a newly developed vasodilator drug. A dose range of 10 to 60 mg was studied. Nicorandil, at a dose of 60 mg, caused statistically significant decreases in systemic systolic and diastolic blood pressure, right atrial pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance and systolic and diastolic pulmonary arterial pressure. A brief increase in cardiac index attributable to an increase in stroke volume without a change in heart rate was also observed. A dose of 40 mg produced similar results in cardiac index and systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance, but changes in other hemodynamic parameters were much smaller in magnitude and usually not of statistical significance. No significant hemodynamic response was seen to doses of 10 and 20 mg of nicorandil. Duration of action was short with nearly all hemodynamic parameters returning close to baseline within 3 hours. This rapid decrease in activity occurred in concert with a rapid plasma clearance of nicorandil as determined by serial measurements of plasma drug concentration. This study suggests that first-dose orally administered nicorandil elicits favorable, but brief, hemodynamic effects in CHF at doses greater than or equal to 40 mg.\r"

  ".W": "The capability of obtaining cross-sectional, high resolution images of arteries with the use of ultrasound catheters has recently been demonstrated in animal studies. In this study the in vivo feasibility of intravascular ultrasound imaging in humans was evaluated. In 26 patients who had undergone diagnostic cardiac catheterization or iliofemoral arteriography, 1 of 3 different models of 20-MHz ultrasound catheters was advanced retrograde, into the iliac arteries and aorta or anterograde into the femoral arteries and real-time cross-sectional images of the arteries were obtained in all. In 10, the iliac arteries were normal and appeared circular and pulsatile with a 3-layered wall and crisply defined lumens. In 7 patients with nonobstructive plaques, the plaque was easily identified in the ultrasound image as a linear, bright, adynamic echo-dense structure. In 4 with obstructive disease in the iliac artery, the arterial lumen appeared irregular, bordered by a thickened, nonpulsatile wall. Variable grades of atheromatous abnormalities in the wall could be visualized. In all 5 patients with arteriographic evidence of obstructive disease of the femoral artery, intravascular ultrasound displayed reduced lumens and irregular borders with protruding high-intensity echoes in the wall. In all patients, the arterial lumen and the normal or abnormal wall were well visualized in the ultrasound images. There were no complications. This study thus demonstrates the feasibility of intravascular ultrasound imaging of arterial circulation in humans. With further improvements in catheter design and image quality, this imaging approach is likely to have a number of potential applications in the assessment of peripheral and coronary arterial diseases and in guiding interventional therapeutic procedures.\r"

In agoraphobia and social phobia, alcohol problems appear more likely to follow from attempts at self-medication of anxiety symptoms, but panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder may be more likely to follow from pathological alcohol consumption. Simple phobia does not appear to be related to alcohol problems in any meaningful way.\r"

The mental status examination is not adequately sensitive to detect noncognitive dysfunction, and subjective complaints, neurological signs, reduced T4 lymphocytes, CSF abnormalities, diffuse slowing on ECG, mild cerebral atrophy on brain CT, and nonspecific hyperdensities on brain magnetic resonance imaging do not correlate reliably with early and subtle HIV-induced neuropsychological impairment. Zidovudine (AZT) can delay or reverse mental deficits, and psychostimulants can reduce apathetic withdrawal, but high-potency neuroleptics can cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome.\r"

Subjectively, both groups were very satisfied with the results of their treatment. Cybex II dynamometer measuring strength, power, and endurance revealed no statistical significant differences between groups, even in light of the shorter followup of the percutaneous group. The percutaneous repairs demonstrated significantly more symmetry in injured/uninjured tendon size than did the open surgical repairs. Two reruptures occurred in the percutaneous group. No other complications were noted. After evaluation of both subjective and objective data we recommend percutaneous repair in the recreational athlete and in patients concerned with cosmesis. Open repair is recommended for all high-caliber athletes who cannot afford any chance of rerupture.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of four commonly used anesthetic agents, halothane, isoflurane, alfentanil, and ketamine, on cardiovascular function and oxygen balance were studied in a dog model of septic shock. After initial pentobarbital administration, the dogs were given Escherichia coli endotoxin (3 mg/kg) and, after 30 min, fluids to restore cardiac filling pressures to baseline levels. This resulted in a low resistance shock in all animals. Dogs were then given for 2 h either halothane (n = 9, 0.5 MAC), isoflurane (n = 9, 0.5 MAC), or alfentanil (n = 9, 150 micrograms/kg IV plus 2 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) or ketamine (n = 9, 2 mg/kg IV plus 0.2 mg.kg-1.min-1) or no anesthetic (control: n = 9). Mean arterial pressure increased in the control group (+11 +/- 18 mm Hg) and with ketamine (+10 +/- 20 mm Hg), remained unchanged with isoflurane (-2 +/- 11 mm Hg), and decreased with halothane (-22 +/- 23 mm Hg) and alfentanil (-9 +/- 23 mm Hg). Heart rate tended to increase in the control group but decreased with the four anesthetic agents, especially with alfentanil and halothane. Cardiac index and left ventricular stroke work index increased in the control group and in each anesthetic group except the halothane group. Systemic vascular resistance decreased in all groups except in the ketamine group. In the control group, the increase in cardiac index was associated with significant increases in oxygen delivery and consumption, and with a significant decrease in blood lactate levels. There was a dramatic decrease in oxygen consumption in all anesthetic groups, whereas oxygen delivery failed to increase only with halothane. Blood lactate increased significantly with halothane (5.0 +/- 1.5 to 6.3 +/- 1.4 mM/L) and isoflurane (4.8 +/- 1.1 to 5.3 +/- 1.2 mM/L), remained unchanged with alfentanil (4.5 +/- 1.5 and 4.6 +/- 0.8 mM/L), and tended to decrease with ketamine (4.9 +/- 1.4 to 4.5 +/- 1.4 mM/L). In conclusion, among the four anesthetic agents tested, halothane had the least desirable effects. Ketamine best preserved cardiovascular function and appeared to have the least deleterious effects on the hypoxic tissues. Thus, ketamine could be the anesthetic agent of choice in septic shock.\r"

Sorbitol has been shown to be the most rapidly acting cathartic, but its therapeutic significance has been debated. Using a previously described aspirin overdose model, ten healthy volunteers participated in a crossover design study that investigated the effect of activated charcoal alone versus that of activated charcoal and sorbitol in preventing salicylate absorption. In phase 1 of the study, subjects consumed 2.5 g aspirin followed by 25 g activated charcoal one hour later. Urine was collected for 48 hours and analyzed for quantitative salicylate metabolites. Phase 2 was identical except that 1.5 g/kg sorbitol was consumed with the activated charcoal. The mean amount of aspirin absorbed without the use of sorbitol was 1.26 +/- 0.15 g, whereas the mean absorption was 0.912 +/- 0.18 g with the addition of sorbitol. This is a 28% decrease in absorption of salicylates attributable to the use of sorbitol. The difference is significant at P less than .05 by the paired Student's t test. This study demonstrates that the addition of sorbitol significantly decreases drug absorption in a simulated drug overdose model. Effects on absorption in actual overdose situations and on patient outcome should be the subjects of further study.\r"

We report results from a prospective study of 329 cases of ibuprofen overdose from a statewide cohort that were reported to our poison center between April 1985 and November 1986; 85 patients had ibuprofen serum concentrations measured. Gastrointestinal disturbances and central nervous system depression were the most common clinical findings (42% and 30% of patients, respectively), but the severity was mild; only one patient had severe symptoms that could be attributed to ibuprofen. Ibuprofen serum concentrations correlated poorly with gastrointestinal symptoms (r = -.177), central nervous system findings (r = .176), presence of coingestants (r = .078), and presence of potentially life-threatening symptoms (r = .087). We evaluated the usefulness of a previously published nomogram to predict ibuprofen toxicity; the positive predictive value for severe symptoms was 6% for all patients and 0% for patients ingesting ibuprofen alone. We conclude that the frequency of life-threatening complications from ibuprofen overdose is low, the nomogram is not predictive of toxicity, and routine serum concentration determinations are not useful as an adjunct in the management of overdose cases.\r"

Administration of glucose during severe incomplete ischemia has a similar detrimental effect. The translation of these experimental findings into clinical practice has been slow, perhaps hindered by the frequent use of rodent models and large bolus doses of glucose. However, evidence is now provided by primate and human studies and by experimental designs using clinically relevant doses of glucose. These clinical and experimental findings in conjunction with the wide availability of a rapid bedside screen for hypoglycemia provide the rationale for an alteration in the standard of care. The empiric administration of glucose should be avoided in patients at risk for cerebral ischemia, such as those with acute stroke, impending cardiac arrest, or severe hypotension or receiving CPR. A bedside fingerstick blood glucose estimation should be performed immediately on all patients presenting with altered mental status. The administration of 50% dextrose should be reserved for those patients in whom hypoglycemia is demonstrated; this practice will uphold Hippocrates' most basic principle of clinical medicine, \"The physician must ... do no harm.\"\r"

  ".W": "A prospective study was conducted in the emergency departments of two community hospitals to assess the accuracy of Doppler ultrasonography performed by emergency physicians in the evaluation of patients with symptoms suggestive of deep-vein thrombosis. Seventy-eight extremities in 76 patients were evaluated by both Doppler ultrasonography and contrast venography. Thirty-six Doppler examinations were normal, 26 were abnormal, and 15 were equivocal. Of the unequivocal examinations, three were false-negative and nine were false-positive. These data represent a sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 79%, negative predictive value of 92%, and positive predictive value of 65%. Negative predictive value improved to 100% among a subgroup of low-risk patients, and positive predictive value improved to 80% among a subgroup of high-risk patients. Our study suggests that Doppler ultrasonography is highly predictive of a negative venogram, particularly in the low-risk patient. Further study with a larger population is needed. The availability and noninvasiveness of Doppler ultrasonography make it a useful adjunct in the evaluation of suspected deep-vein thrombosis in the ED.\r"

Heart rate, QRS duration, QT interval, and most recently, the terminal 40 ms QRS (T40) axis have been reported to be valuable indicators in TCA overdose. The value of plasma drug levels and their ability to predict complications has been debated. To evaluate the discriminant and predictive abilities of ECG parameters and quantitative drug levels in a large series of TCA overdoses, we retrospectively reviewed the charts of all overdose patients admitted to ICU in our facility during a 30-month study period. The TCA-positive group (187) had statistically significant differences (P less than .001) from the TCA-negative group (171) in heart rate, QRS duration, QTc, and T40 axis. However, none of these parameters could correctly classify more than 66% of cases. The sensitivity and specificity of the T40 axis were found to be only 29% and 83%, respectively. Correlation coefficients for plasma quantitative TCA levels by ECG parameter yielded an R of less than .33 in all cases. QRS duration of 100 ms or more and heart rate of 100 or more, or TCA level of 1,000 ng/mL or more, were present in all of a few patients with complications. We conclude that ECG parameters cannot be relied on to include or exclude the diagnosis of TCA overdose and that TCA levels do not correlate with ECG parameters.\r"

DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: The emergency room of a large, urban hospital with primary and referral care responsibilities. PATIENTS: Eighty-one patients from 18 to 45 years of age with acute bronchial asthma and without pneumonitis or other serious underlying illnesses were studied on 91 occasions and were randomly assigned to control or experimental groups. INTERVENTIONS: The steroid group received 125 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone whereas the control group received intravenous normal saline 30 minutes after initial treatment. Additional treatment included aerosolized metaproterenol and oral theophylline therapy. Six hours after study entry, remaining patients were treated with 40 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone. Hospitalization was mandatory if total treatment time was greater than 12 hours. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Age, sex, peak expiratory flow at entry, and prevalence of recent corticosteroids use were similar in both groups. Duration of emergency room treatment was 6.7 +/- 4.2 (SD) hours in the steroid group and 6.3 +/- 4.1 hours in the control group (P = 0.66). Hospitalization was necessary in 18% (95% CI, 7% to 30%) of the steroid group and in 13% (CI, 3% to 22%) of the control group. Frequency of return visits for acute asthma 2 days after emergency room discharge was 11% (CI, -1% to 22%) in the steroid group and 13% (CI, 2% to 23%) in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: These results fail to show any benefit for early administration of corticosteroids in patients with acute asthma. Routine administration of corticosteroids on initial presentation in such patients may not be warranted.\r"

Contact tracing identified 159 persons who may have been exposed to B virus (21 had been exposed to monkeys at the facility and 138 had been exposed to one or more of the case-patients), but no further cases were identified. Comparisons of restriction endonuclease patterns from B virus isolates linked two of the three cases in monkey handlers to one clinically ill monkey and the other to a second, healthy monkey. Three risk factors for human infection were identified: nonuse of mechanical or chemical restraints for monkeys before handling, nonuse of available protective gear, and direct viral inoculation through the application of a topical medication.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To provide a comprehensive review of the causes, current diagnostic evaluation, and treatment of syncope. DATA IDENTIFICATION: New data and knowledge in this evolving field were critically analyzed by doing a MEDLINE search on syncope supplemented by selective review of English language literature citations in the Index Medicus before 1980. STUDY SELECTION: We reviewed approximately 200 published articles on syncope and closely related topics as well as using our own clinical experience. We selected articles if they addressed the pathophysiology of syncope, classification and causes, differential diagnosis, noninvasive and invasive evaluation, and current therapy. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: Syncope is a common clinical problem, occurring in 30% to 50% of the adult population. The prognosis for syncope depends on its cause. Cardiac syncope has the worst prognosis and therefore mandates thorough evaluation and prompt treatment. Diagnostic evaluation is made difficult by the transient nature of the episodes and the many causes. Noninvasive testing reveals the cause of syncope in approximately 50% of cases. More extensive evaluation, including invasive electrophysiologic studies, has assumed a larger role in defining the cause of syncope in selected patients with structural heart disease in whom a noninvasive evaluation has been nondiagnostic. Recently tilt-table studies have been proposed as a clinically useful noninvasive test for vagally mediated syncope. CONCLUSIONS: A rational stepwise diagnostic and therapeutic approach to patients with syncope can be developed by initially doing a careful history and physical examination followed by a noninvasive evaluation and selective use of additional, more specialized or invasive tests. Future research should focus on defining the validity and utility of current diagnostic testing in syncope and on exploring further the pathophysiology of patients with recurrent, unexplained syncope.\r"

None of these individuals took prophylactic antibiotics, although 4 of 13 took short courses of an antimicrobial agent for therapy of traveler's diarrhea. With an average of 9.3 E. coli per sample, resistance to all agents tested except gentamicin was shown to increase during the time in Mexico (P less than 0.001 to P less than 0.05). For example, no TMP-resistant (Tmpr) E. coli isolates were found by this method before travel, whereas 57% of the individuals had Tmpr and Tmpr-Smxr E. coli by the final week in Mexico. This increase in resistance occurred regardless of whether an individual took a short course of antimicrobial therapy. This study shows that travel itself, even without the use of prophylactic or therapeutic antimicrobial agents, is associated with the acquisition of resistant E. coli. Travel to developing nations may rival other sources of resistant organisms.\r"

USA 83:6164-6168, 1986) have proposed that misread membrane proteins created by the action of streptomycin on translating ribosomes cause the formation of nonspecific membrane channels which allow increased uptake of the antibiotic and contribute to its bactericidal action. Pretreatment of Escherichia coli with a low concentration of puromycin enhanced the rate of killing by streptomycin. The effect of the pretreatment with puromycin was transient, since approximately normal rates of killing by streptomycin were restored after 30 min of incubation in antibiotic-free medium. This time period correlates with the time required to degrade labile polypeptides in puromycin-treated cells. The induction of a specific abnormal malE-lacZ fusion protein, which is capable of disrupting the normal membrane protein secretion process, also increased the rate of killing by streptomycin. Induction of malF-phoA fusion proteins, which have no significant effects on membrane integrity, did not alter susceptibility to streptomycin. These observations suggest that certain abnormal membrane proteins can contribute to the bactericidal action of streptomycin.\r"

In vitro, ceftriaxone demonstrated an important inoculum effect (MICs were 2 and 256 micrograms/ml with 5 X 10(5) and 5 X 10(7) CFU of inoculum per ml, respectively). Sulbactam inhibited the beta-lactamase degradation of ceftriaxone and enhanced the killing by ceftriaxone with both inocula tested. In vivo, sulbactam (100 mg/kg every 8 h) or ceftriaxone (15 or 30 mg/kg every 24 h) alone were ineffective after a 4-day therapy. The addition of sulbactam to ceftriaxone (15 mg/kg) or to the ceftriaxone (15 mg/kg)-netilmicin (6 mg/kg every 24 h) combination produced a reduction of 2 log10 CFU/g of vegetation greater than that produced by therapy without sulbactam. The sulbactam-ceftriaxone (30 mg/kg) combination produced a reduction of almost 5 log10 CFU/g of vegetation greater than that produced by single-drug therapy (P less than 0.01), sterilized five of eight vegetations (versus none of seven for ceftriaxone [30 mg/kg] alone; P less than 0.05), and was as effective as the ceftriaxone (15 mg/kg)-sulbactam-netilmicin combination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the present study, we examined the possibility that this murine AIDS (MAIDS) model would be useful for evaluating antiretrovirus drugs in vivo through the use of a well-defined antiretrovirus drug, the reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor (H. Mitsuya, K.J. Weinhold, P.A. Furman, M.H. St. Claire, S. Nusinoff-Lehrman, R.C. Gallo, D. Bolognesi, D.W. Barry, and S. Broder, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We evaluated the effect of AZT treatment on de novo virus infection as well as on the induction of immunodeficiency by various parameters, including RT activity in serum, splenomegaly, proliferative responses against alloantigens and mitogens, soluble-antigen-presenting cell activity, and immunoglobulin G levels in serum. Our results demonstrated that AZT treatment of C57BL/10 mice infected with LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus efficiently prevented the induction of immunodeficiency if started at the time of virus inoculation. Starting AZT treatment 1 week later provided only a partial protective effect. Starting AZT treatment 2 weeks later was associated with suppression of RT activity in serum but no prevention of immunosuppression. This MAIDS model may allow rapid and cost-effective screening for antiretrovirus drugs targeted against retroviral functions shared between human AIDS and MAIDS, such as those encoded by gag, pol, or env.\r"

In the present paper, the influences of cephaloridine, imipenem, and ceftazidime on the serum resistance of eight serum-resistant K1-positive E. coli blood culture isolates with smooth-type lipopolysaccharide were studied. All strains were rendered more serum sensitive by treatment with subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics. The amount of the reduction of serum resistance was dependent on the concentration of the antibiotic. Amounts of K1 produced under the influence of the antibiotics were measured and were found to be reduced for almost all strains tested. To further test the hypothesis that antibiotic-induced reduction of serum resistance is mediated by inhibition of K1 expression, isogenic mutants of one strain were produced by selection for resistance against infection with K1-specific bacteriophages. These mutants were found to be highly serum sensitive. We conclude from this study that beta-lactam antibiotics can render K1-positive serum-resistant strains of E. coli highly serum sensitive and that this effect is mediated by inhibition of K1 expression.\r"

The in vitro potencies of these compounds against HIV infection in CEM cells were measured, with FddT and AZT being more potent than D4T. The cytotoxicities of D4T, FddT, and AZT for CEM cells were comparable. The triphosphates of these three derivatives inhibited purified HIV reverse transcriptase, and their affinities for this polymerase were found to be 1 or 2 orders of magnitude greater than that for the normal substrate, dTTP. D4T was less toxic than FddT or AZT for cultured human and mouse bone marrow cells (granulocyte-macrophage CFU). The three compounds had similar toxicities for human progenitor erythrocyte burst-forming units. In a 30-day mouse toxicity study, AZT and FddT produced a similar spectrum of hematopoietic toxicities. These toxic effects occurred at much lower doses of FddT than of AZT. At the higher doses of FddT, a significant incidence of lethality occurred. By contrast, D4T was considerably less toxic than both AZT and FddT in this study. The dose-limiting toxicity of D4T in mice was hepatotoxicity. The very different phosphorylation patterns of D4T, its lower toxicity, and its comparable potency relative to FddT and AZT suggest that the potential of D4T as an anti-HIV agent should be further explored.\r"

Evidence is given here for an alternative location of this gene at a site identical to sites observed earlier for dhfrII on plasmid R388, dhfrV on pLMO20, and aadA on Tn21. All these genes and dhfrI are precisely inserted as discrete GTTA-flanked elements at distinct loci in very conserved surrounding sequences. One of these dhfrI insertions was observed to occur in association with a similarly inserted aadA nucleotidyltransferase gene, which mediates streptomycin and spectinomycin resistance. Close to the insertion site, there is an open reading frame translating into a 337-amino-acid peptide which shows striking similarities to recombinases of the integrase family, sulI, the sulfonamide resistance gene, is very often found close to the insertion point forming a genetic surrounding, originally observed as a part of Tn21-like transposons.

Furthermore, the newly observed location of dhfrI could shed light on the evolution of the antibiotic resistance region of Tn7, which could be able to take up genes by the same mechanism as that of Tn21-like transposons.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To assess the proportion of acutely ill psychiatric patients who can be treated in a day hospital and compare the outcome of day patient and inpatient treatment. DESIGN--Prospective randomised controlled trial of day patient versus inpatient treatment after exclusion of patients precluded by severity of illness or other factors from being treated as day patients. All three groups assessed at three and 12 months. SETTING--Teaching hospital serving small socially deprived inner city area. Day hospital designed to take acute admissions because of few beds. PATIENTS--175 Patients were considered, of whom 73 could not be allocated. Of the remaining 102 patients, 51 were allocated to each treatment setting but only 89 became established in treatment--namely, 41 day patients and 48 inpatients. 73 Of these 89 patients were reassessed at three months and 70 at one year. INTERVENTIONS--Standard day patient and inpatient treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Discharge from hospital and return to previous level of social functioning; reduction of psychiatric symptoms, abnormal behaviour, and burden on relatives. RESULTS--33 Of 48 inpatients were discharged at three months compared with 17 of 41 day patients. But at one year 9 of 48 inpatients and three of 41 day patients were in hospital. 18 Of 35 day patients and 16 of 39 inpatients were at their previous level of social functioning at one year. The only significant difference at three months was a greater improvement in social role performance in the inpatients. At one year there was no significant difference between day patients and inpatients in present state examination summary scores and social role performance, burden, or behaviour. CONCLUSIONS--Roughly 40% of all acutely ill patients presenting for admission to a psychiatric unit may be treated satisfactorily in a well staffed day hospital. The outcome of treatment is similar to that of inpatient care but might possibly reduce readmissions. The hospital costs seem to be similar but further research is required to assess the costs in terms of extra demands on relatives, general practitioners, and other community resources.\r"

DESIGN--A prospective comparative study of growth retarded fetuses with normal and abnormal umbilical artery blood flow. SETTING--The fetal assessment clinic of a large maternity hospital in Ireland. PATIENTS--179 Women with singleton pregnancies in which the fetal abdominal circumference, measured by ultrasonography, was below the fifth centile for gestation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Perinatal deaths, fetal distress requiring caesarean section, preterm delivery, cerebral irritation. RESULTS--Of 124 fetuses with normal flow, all physically normal fetuses survived but one baby had cerebral irritation; there were six preterm deliveries and four caesarean sections for fetal distress. Among 55 women with abnormal flow there were two midtrimester abortions, three perinatal deaths, and one case of cerebral irritation in physically normal fetuses. CONCLUSIONS--Intrauterine growth retardation associated with normal umbilical blood flow is a different entity from that associated with abnormal flow, normal flow being largely benign and abnormal flow carrying a serious risk of adverse outcome.\r"

In most cases treatment is effective, but important episodes of depression are being missed. To determine whether a brief, systematic assessment for the early detection of depression should be part of the periodic health examination we searched MEDLINE and the Science Citation Index for randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effectiveness of early detection of depression with a questionnaire. Seven instruments met our quality criteria; the Beck Depression Inventory, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, the Zung Self-Assessment Depression Scale, the General Health Questionnaire, the Hopkins Symptom Checklist, the Mental Health Inventory and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The four randomized controlled trials failed to provide adequate evidence of the benefit of routine screening. Early detection is difficult because of depression's natural history, the role of symptoms, the cultural diversity of Canada and how detection instruments have been developed. Depression deserves careful attention from primary care physicians; however, further research and development is required before the widespread routine use of any detection test can be recommended.\r"

The other groups, in decreasing order of risk, were the mentally ill, people who have attempted suicide, those with a life-threatening illness, native people, people with a family history of suicide and prisoners. Studies that evaluated suicide prevention programs showed that none significantly reduced the incidence of suicide; however, the studies were found to be methodologically inadequate or used noncomparable systems of data collection. On the basis of our findings we recommend that primary care physicians routinely evaluate suicide risk among patients in high-risk groups and that intervention include counselling, follow-up and, if necessary, referral to a psychiatrist. Close follow-up is recommended for newly discharged psychiatric patients and those who recently attempted suicide.\r"

A regurgitant index (RI) was calculated by obtaining the ratio of the areas of the triangles from regurgitant and forward curves. Eight-five percent of the patients were 70 years or older. After valvuloplasty, aortic valve area increased from 0.5 +/- 0.3 cm2 to 0.7 +/- 0.3 cm2 (P = .0002) while left ventricular to aortic gradient decreased from 77 +/- 32 to 51 +/- 24 (P = .0001). RI did not significantly change in 58% of patients, increased in 25%, and decreased in 15.2%. We conclude that in most patients undergoing aortic valvuloplasty, regurgitation does not change after the procedure. In some patients it may increase significantly, and in a few it may even decrease. Indicator dilution curves technique seems to provide a sensitive, accurate, and reproducible method to detect and quantify aortic incompetence before and after valvuloplasty.\r"

A normotensive sham-clipped group was included. Another group of two-kidney, one-clip rats was studied 3 weeks after unclipping. Baroreflex sensitivity, as assessed by the steady-state method using a graded phenylephrine infusion, mean arterial pressure, and heart rate were measured preoperatively and at 24 hours postoperatively. Two-kidney, one-clip rats were significantly hypertensive preoperatively compared with control (mean arterial pressure, 183 +/- 4 vs. 106 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.001), heart rate was similar (420 +/- 9 vs. 401 +/- 9 beats/min, p greater than 0.05), and baroreflex sensitivity was significantly reduced (0.76 +/- 0.07 vs. 1.50 +/- 0.20 msec/mm Hg; p less than 0.001). There was a minimal change in heart rate despite the fall in mean arterial pressure in all hypertensive groups, indicating resetting of the baroreflexes. At 24 hours after the operation, baroreflex sensitivity was unchanged in all groups compared with the preoperative value. By 3 weeks, baroreflex sensitivity was significantly greater than in the hypertensive two-kidney, one-clip rats before the operation and 24 hours after they were unclipped, but not compared with normotensive sham-clipped rats. Thus, although resetting occurs within 24 hours, whatever the method of blood pressure reduction, baroreflex sensitivity remains impaired at this time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We show that rat aortic IGF-I messenger RNA (mRNA) is induced 24 hours after deendothelialization, at a time when smooth muscle cell proliferation within the intima is still not apparent. After 7 days, IGF-I mRNA induction peaks at about ninefold control levels and then falls to about threefold 14 days after denudation when smooth muscle cell proliferation is at its peak. We also show that, of the 5' untranslated IGF-I mRNA transcripts, only the class C transcript is expressed and regulated in aortic tissue. In contrast, treatment of rats with supraphysiological doses of growth hormone, the major endocrine regulator of IGF-I gene expression, elicited only twofold induction of aortic IGF-I mRNA. Our findings suggest that IGF-I may be an important autocrine or paracrine regulator of smooth muscle cell proliferation and that it may be significant in determining the cellular response to arterial wall injury.\r"

The dose of Fab fragments was equal to the amount of digoxin or digitoxin in the patient's body as estimated from medical histories or determinations of serum digoxin or digitoxin concentrations. The youngest patient received Fab fragments within several hours of birth, and the oldest patient was 94 years old. Seventy-five patients (50%) were receiving long-term digitalis therapy, 15 (10%) had taken a large overdose of digitalis accidentally, and 59 (39%) had ingested an overdose of digitalis with suicidal intent. The clinical response to Fab was unspecified in two cases, leaving 148 patients who could be evaluated. One hundred nineteen patients (80%) had resolution of all signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity, 14 (10%) improved, and 15 (10%) showed no response. After termination of the Fab infusion, the median time to initial response was 19 minutes, and 75% of the patients had some evidence of a response by 60 minutes. There were only 14 patients with adverse events considered to possibly or probably have been caused by Fab; the most common events were rapid development of hypokalemia and exacerbation of congestive heart failure. No allergic reactions were identified in response to Fab treatment. Of patients who experienced cardiac arrest as a manifestation of digitalis toxicity, 54% survived hospitalization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Either placebo or 1.0 g methylprednisolone (steroid) was infused intravenously 2-24 hours before planned PTCA in 915 patients. The PTCA patient success rate was 87% (mean) in the eight centers. There were no differences in clinical or angiographic baseline variables between the two groups. End-point analysis (angiographic restenosis, death, recurrent ischemia necessitating early restudy, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery) showed that there was no significant difference comparing placebo- with steroid-treated patients. Angiographic restudy showed the lesion restenosis rate to be 39% (120 of 307 lesions) after placebo and 40% (117 of 291) after steroid treatment (p = NS). We conclude that pulse steroid pretreatment does not influence the overall restenosis rate after successful PTCA.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the participation of the renin-angiotensin system in sustaining hypertension, we administered the specific dipeptide renin inhibitor enalkiren (A-64662) to 18 patients with essential hypertension. Ascending intravenous bolus doses (0.03, 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mg/kg) of the inhibitor were each given at 45-minute intervals to patients maintained on an ad libitum sodium diet who were studied while in bed in the semirecumbent posture. Enalkiren produced marked decreases in plasma renin activity (PRA) that were still evident 8 hours after completion of dosing. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were decreased in a dose-dependent fashion without an effect on heart rate. Repetition of this procedure after patients were subjected to sodium depletion by 1 week of thiazide treatment produced amplified decreases in blood pressure. Despite the short plasma half-life of the inhibitor, these blood pressure-lowering effects were sustained for 4-8 hours when compared with parallel placebo administration in the same patients. Both the baseline PRA and the inhibitor-induced changes in PRA correlated significantly with blood pressure changes during the unstimulated and the sodium-depleted studies. However, effects of the inhibitor on diastolic blood pressure in the latter study correlated most closely with actual increases in renin produced by diuretic pretreatment. Thus, this specific renin inhibitor has demonstrated the dependency of blood pressure on the renin-angiotensin system even during basal conditions in hypertensive patients. Moreover, renin response to sodium depletion appears to be an attribute that additionally characterizes individual hypertensive patients.\r"

  ".U": "90263292\r", 
  ".W": "Endothelin, a recently discovered endothelium-derived peptide, has been reported to produce potent vasoconstriction in various vessels of experimental animals. To study the involvement of endothelin in the regulation of vascular tonus in humans, isolated human mesenteric arteries were investigated by both pharmacological and immunohistochemical methods. The vasoconstrictor action of endothelin-1 was examined on ring segments of human mesenteric arteries. Endothelin-1 induced a slowly developing and sustained contraction, with an EC50 value (half-maximal effective concentration) of 2.9 x 10(-9) M, two orders of magnitude smaller than that of norepinephrine (EC50 of 3.9 x 10(-7) M), indicating that the vasoconstrictor action of endothelin-1 is about 100 times more potent than that of norepinephrine. The contractile effect of endothelin-1 was affected neither by adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic, nor serotonergic antagonists, nor by inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism. The vasoconstrictor response to endothelin-1 was effectively antagonized by nicardipine, a dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel blocker. Endothelin-1 profoundly augmented contractile response to Ca2+ in partially depolarized tissues. Immunohistochemical studies revealed for the first time that endothelin-like immunoreactivity was localized in endothelial cells of human mesenteric artery. The results of the present study indicate that endothelin-1 is one of the most potent vasoconstrictors in the human mesenteric artery and that it induces vasoconstriction via an ultimately accelerating Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. Since endothelin-1 can be located in human endothelial cells, it may play an important physiological or pathophysiological role.\r"

  ".W": "Spontaneously hypertensive Okamoto-strain rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were actively immunized with mouse renin to investigate the effect on blood pressure of blocking the renin-angiotensinogen reaction. Ten male SHR and 10 male WKY rats were immunized with purified mouse submandibular gland renin. Control rats were immunized with bovine serum albumin. Antirenin antibodies were produced by both SHR and WKY rats, but renin-immunized SHR had higher titers of circulating renin antibodies after three injections. The increase in renin antibody in renin-immunized SHR was associated with a significant drop in blood pressure (tail-cuff method) that became similar to that of the WKY control rats after four injections. The blockade by antirenin immunoglobulins of the renin-angiotensinogen reaction also decreased the blood pressure of normotensive rats. Perfusion of renin-immunized rats with mouse submandibular renin (10 micrograms) in vivo caused no increase in blood pressure. Perfusion of renin-immunized, salt-depleted SHR with converting enzyme inhibitor caused no further decrease in blood pressure but significantly decreased blood pressure in salt-depleted control rats. The presence of circulating renin antibodies was associated with low plasma renin activity (0.31 +/- 0.23 ng angiotensin I [Ang I]/ml/hr). Plasma renin activity was unchanged in control animals (13.1 +/- 3.9 ng Ang I/ml/hr in control SHR, 13.9 +/- 3.2 ng Ang I/ml/hr in control WKY rats). Renin antibody-rich serum produced a dose-dependent inhibition of rat renin enzymatic activity in vitro. The chronic blockade of the renin-angiotensinogen reaction in renin-immunized SHR produced an almost-complete disappearance of Ang II (0.8 %/- 7 fmol/ml; control SHR, 30.6 +/- 15.7 fmol/ml) and a 50% reduction in urinary aldosterone. Renin immunization was never associated with a detectable loss of sodium after either 10 or 24 weeks. The glomerular filtration rate was not decreased 10 weeks after renin immunization, whereas blood pressure was significantly decreased, plasma renin activity was blocked, and renal plasma flow was increased. The ratio of left ventricular weight to body weight after 24 weeks was significantly below control levels in renin-immunized WKY rats and SHR. Histological examination of the kidney of renin-immunized SHR showed a chronic autoimmune interstitial nephritis characterized by the presence of immunoglobulins, mononuclear cell infiltration, and fibrosis around the juxtaglomerular apparatus. These experiments demonstrate that chronic specific blockade of renin decreases blood pressure in a genetic model of hypertension in which the renin-angiotensin system is not directly involved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The quality of cine angiography is excellent in our days, and as a consequence some of the pitfalls encountered in previous randomized trials are not currently present. An example can be found in the CASS analysis of the reproducibility of coronary arteriographic reading by the Quality Control Committee Sessions: \"There is an indication that different clinics\" involved in the CASS trial \"can reduce the variability between their readings by concerted effort to improve both the quality and the completeness of the angiographic examination.\" The introduction of electronic calipers to judge the severity of the obstruction can eliminate human errors. The computerized protocol has the disadvantage that it takes longer to tabulate cine coronary angiography and it will depend on its pattern, but it certainly will not be as long as filling in the CASS protocol. However, this effort is justified because it will enrich our knowledge of coronary arteriosclerosis. As a result, patients will be divided into proximal (1, 2, 12, 13, and 19), middle (mainly, 3, 14, and 20), and distal (remainder) segments. Sometimes midsegments can be important. For example, in the report from CASS related to the left main equivalent lesions, the 5-year survival rate was 48% if the obstruction on the left anterior descending was proximal and increased to 71% if it was more distal. Several randomized studies to compare PTCA with CABG as suggested by Gruentzig et al in 1979 are underway, and it is hoped that the data will be properly analyzed. However, if cine coronary angiography and the status of the left ventricle are not carefully tabulated (classification of patients into left main trunk or one-, two-, or three-vessel disease is not sufficient), the results of the randomized trials comparing PTCA with CABG will add more confusion instead of clarifying proper therapeutic implications.\r"

We evaluated the capability of intravascular ultrasound to quantify pulmonary artery (PA) morphology in vitro and explored the feasibility of in vivo PA imaging in animals and humans. In the in vitro study of 15 PA segments, we used a 20-MHz prototype ultrasound catheter. Intravascular ultrasound (y) provided crisp images of PA segments and demonstrated excellent correlations with anatomic measurements (x) in the estimation of luminal area (y = 0.89x + 2.95, r = 0.99, p less than 0.001), luminal diameter (n = 30, y = 0.79x + 0.96, r = 0.92, p less than 0.001), and vessel wall thickness (n = 60, y = 0.65x + 0.33, r = 0.85, p less than 0.001). We subsequently introduced the probe into the PA of 10 dogs and were able to obtain real-time, two-dimensional images of the main PA, its major branches, and farther smaller branches as far as the wedge level. To evaluate the in vivo feasibility of PA imaging in conscious humans, we used a commercially available, 20-MHz intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) catheter in 22 subjects through a femoral or jugular venous sheath at the end of standard diagnostic cardiac catheterization. In 20 subjects, we acquired dynamic, high-resolution, cross-sectional images of the proximal and distal PA. Changes in shape and decreasing luminal area could be clearly recognized as the IVUS catheter reached branching points and as it passed more distally. There were no complications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

An increase in plasma methadone concentration resulted in a rapid increase in pain relief or sedation. The estimates of values of 50% of maximum effect (Css50) for pain relief and sedation obtained with a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model varied tenfold to twentyfold among patients; the mean Css50 value for pain relief (0.359 +/- 0.158 [SD] micrograms/ml) was virtually the same as the mean Css50 value for sedation (0.336 +/- 0.205 [SD] micrograms/ml). Similarly, the mean gamma (slope function) for pain relief (4.4 +/- 3.8 [SD]) and sedation (5.8 +/- 5.4 [SD]) did not differ. Examination of hysteresis plots of data obtained during the infusion and for 4 to 5 hours after cessation of the infusion revealed a very rapid equilibration between plasma methadone values and the sites mediating pain relief. There was no indication of the development of tolerance to the pharmacodynamic effects of methadone during the study. This report describes a method for quantitating the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships of the desirable and undesirable effects of opioid analgesics.\r"

Comparison of the blockade by these drops showed that carteolol and timolol totally inhibited the beta 1 and beta 2 effects of a dose of isoproterenol able to increase heart rate by 50% (placebo eyedrops were used as a control). Betaxolol differ significantly because it allowed the same effects with the same dose of isoproterenol. Intensity of the blockade was measured by comparison of the effective doses of isoproterenol.

After a 2 to 4 week placebo baseline period, patients with diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 114 mm Hg, were randomized to receive either placebo or benazepril hydrochloride, 5, 10, 20, or 40 mg, once daily in double-blind fashion for 28 days. Blood pressure was measured predose and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 hours after the dose during inpatient observation days at the end of the placebo baseline period, and on the first and last day of the double-blind treatment period; and 24 hours after the dose at weekly outpatient visits. All doses of benazepril hydrochloride resulted in clinically important reductions in diastolic and systolic blood pressures that lasted between 12 and 24 hours after both the first dose, and following the last dose after 4 weeks of treatment. The findings indicate that benazepril hydrochloride may be clinically useful as once-daily monotherapy in many patients with hypertension.\r"

Urine volume and excretion of sodium greater than chloride greater than potassium tended to increase during administration of pyrazinoylguanidine. Systemic arterial pressure declined while pyrazinoylguanidine was given at 300 or 600 mg b.i.d. for 3 days. At both doses pyrazinoylguanidine reduced plasma renin activity during the first 2 hours. Between days 1 and 3 only the high dose of pyrazinoylguanidine decreased plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone levels. These findings with pyrazinoylguanidine are consistent with those of secretion of urea in human subjects across the renal tubules and indicate that this process is susceptible to pharmacologic alteration, even in the presence of severe renal insufficiency.\r"

However, the patients were able to readjust their oral dosings. Equal analgesia was achieved with both drugs, but the intravenous dose of oxycodone hydrochloride needed was 30% higher than that of morphine. The median calculated oral/intravenous ratios giving comparable analgesia were 0.31 for morphine and 0.70 for oxycodone hydrochloride. Morphine caused more nausea than oxycodone hydrochloride and hallucinations occurred only during morphine treatment. Otherwise, there were no major differences in the side effects between these two opioids.\r"

During this time interval, from the 172 Veterans Administration Medical Centers in the United States, 146 contact calls were initiated to the single center authorized to do liver transplants for the Veterans Administration. One hundred one (69%) of these contact calls resulted in a patient evaluation. Of the 101 patients evaluated, 77 (76%) were accepted for liver transplantation (OLTx). Of these 77, 67 (87%) were transplanted. The reasons for denial of transplant evaluation were numerous and included metastatic cancer, active alcoholism, homosexuality, and a variety of concurrent medical problems. The reasons for denying liver transplantation after evaluation were similar and included concurrent medical problems that contraindicated transplantation (N = 14), metastatic cancer (N = 6), and liver disease of insufficient severity to justify transplantation (N = 3). The number of transplants performed annually by the Veterans Administration increased from one in 1983 to 21 in 1988. Seventeen second grafts and two third grafts were transplanted in 17 cases, resulting in a retransplant rate of 22%; 46% of the patients receiving a second graft survived. None of those receiving three grafts survived. The reasons for retransplantation included acute and/or chronic rejection (N = 6), hepatic artery thrombosis (N = 5), primary graft failure (N = 4), recurrent cancer (N = 2), fulminant hepatitis and portal venous emboli (one each). A total of 45 transplanted patients are still alive (67% of those transplanted).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In the early 1970s an increased prevalence of gallstones was reported in adults and children with immunoglobulin deficiency. As the advent of ultrasonography has largely changed the diagnostic approach to gallstones, we have reevaluated the prevalence of cholelithiasis in a group including 37 patients with common variable immunodeficiency and seven patients with other forms of primary immunodeficiency. All patients were receiving intravenous gammaglobulin replacement since 1983 or, in more recent cases, soon after the diagnosis was made, and therefore had relatively few infections. All patients underwent a hepatobiliary ultrasonogram and blood sampling. Data were compared, after age and sex standardization, with those obtained by the GREPCO in a free-living population of 1239 men and 1081 women. Only two women with immunoglobulin deficiency had gallstones. One of these was obese and had had one pregnancy. Both were asymptomatic. None of the patients studied had a history of cholecystectomy or evidence of biliary sludge. Thus, the observed prevalence rates of gallstone disease were 8.7% in women and 0% in males, respectively, against expected values of 9.5% and 3.2%. Immunodeficient patients expressed several putative risk factors for gallstones in the low range (body mass index, total and HDL cholesterol, and blood glucose in both sexes, and triglycerides in men). We conclude that gallstone disease is not more frequent in patients with immunodeficiency syndromes undergoing immunoglobulin therapy than in the general population.\r"

An intrajejunal infusion of Clinimeal resulted in significant rises of pancreastatin and CCK, which paralleled the pancreatic secretion and gallbladder contraction. On the other hand, an intrajejunal infusion of Clinimeal resulted in a delayed rise of pancreastatin and no rise of CCK in chronic pancreatitis. Pancreatic secretion did not increase, and gallbladder contraction was not induced in these patients. It is suggested that pancreastatin may play an important role in the regulation of intestinal phase of exocrine pancreas. The impaired pancreastatin and CCK release in chronic pancreatitis may be due to the inappropriate stimuli in the lumen, which is attributed to pancreatic exocrine dysfunction, or to disturbed physiological regulation between the pancreas and gastrointestinal tract.\r"

Most cases are caused by the Shiga-like toxin-producing bacteria, Escherichia coli 0157:H7. Nineteen colonic biopsy specimens and one resection specimen were reviewed from 11 patients with E. coli 0157:H7-associated colitis to determine whether histologic features could be useful in diagnosis or in suggesting pathogenesis. All specimens showed hemorrhage and edema in the lamina propria. Specimens from nine patients were focally necrotic and showed hemorrhage and acute inflammation in the superficial mucosa with preservation of the deep crypts, similar to the pattern of injury associated with acute ischemic colitis. Specimens from five patients showed neutrophils focally infiltrating the lamina propria and crypts, resembling the pattern of injury seen in infectious colitis. One or both of these histologic patterns were observed in specimens from all but one patient. Specimens from four patients had poorly formed inflammatory pseudomembranes. It is concluded that the histologic features of E. coli 0157:H7-associated colitis resemble a combination of ischemic and infectious injuries similar to those described in toxin-mediated Clostridium difficile-associated colitis. This suggests that the toxin(s) produced by these E. coliplay a role in the colonic injury. Infection with E. coli 0157:H7 should be considered in the differential diagnosis of ischemic and infectious colitis.\r"

A fiberoptic catheter coupled to a helium-cadmium laser (325 nm) and an optical multichannel analyzer were used to obtain fluorescence spectra (350-600 nm) from 35 normal colonic specimens and 35 resected adenomatous polyps. A score based on six wavelengths was derived by stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis of the spectra. The mean score (+/- SEM) was + 0.86 +/- 0.06 for normal mucosa and -0.86 +/- 0.06 for adenomatous polyps (P less than 0.001). Spectra from an additional 34 normal specimens, 16 adenomatous polyps, and 16 hyperplastic polyps were prospectively classified with accuracies of 100%, 100%, and 94%, respectively. The mean score for hyperplastic polyps was significantly different from adenomatous (P less than 0.001) but not from normal tissue. Thus, quantitative analysis of fluorescence spectra enables the detection of adenomatous transformation in colonic mucosa.\r"

The objectives of this study were to extend these findings and to determine whether purified immunoglobulin from the sera of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis inhibit activity of these dehydrogenase complexes in vitro. Sera were examined from 14 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (13 mitochondrial antibody positive), 23 with rheumatic diseases and 30 with chronic active hepatitis (all 53 positive for mitochondrial antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence), 10 with alcoholic liver disease, and 5 normal controls. Antibodies against pyruvate dehydrogenase, branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes were detected by immunoblot and quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Of the 14 serum samples obtained from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, 13, 11, and 2 samples tested positive by immunoblot for the E2 subunits of pyruvate, branched-chain ketoacid, and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, respectively. In contrast, samples from subjects with rheumatic diseases, chronic active hepatitis, and alcoholic liver disease and control subjects tested negative for these antibodies. Serum immunoglobulin G with high titers of mitochondrial antibodies showed concentration-dependent inhibition of activity of the dehydrogenase complexes, and close correlation (r = 0.917, n = 13) was observed between inhibitory activity against pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and the reciprocal titer of immunoglobulin against this complex. These data suggest that such autoantibodies, besides serving as diagnostic markers for primary biliary cirrhosis, may have a pathogenic role by their ability to inhibit important mitochondrial enzymes.\r"

Based on these findings, a prospective multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was planned to assess whether oral S-adenosylmethionine is effective in cholestatic patients with chronic liver disease. Accordingly, 220 inpatients (26% chronic active hepatitis, 68% cirrhosis, 6% primary biliary cirrhosis) with stable (1 month or more) at least twofold increases in serum total and conjugated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase volunteered for the trial. Serum markers of cholestasis significantly (P less than 0.01) decreased after oral S-adenosylmethionine administration (1600 mg/day), and their values were significantly (P less than 0.01) lower than the corresponding values in the placebo group. S-adenosylmethionine significantly (P less than 0.01) improved subjective symptoms such as pruritus, fatigue, and feeling of being unwell, whereas placebo was ineffective. Two patients in the S-adenosylmethionine group and 9 controls (P less than 0.05) withdrew from the trial for reduced compliance because of inefficacy of treatment. Oral S-adenosylmethionine was tolerated to the same extent as placebo. In conclusion, short-term administration of oral S-adenosylmethionine is more effective than placebo in improving clinical and laboratory measures of intrahepatic cholestasis and offers a new therapeutic modality for the symptomatic management of this syndrome.\r"

All material originated from pancreatic restrictions. Evaluable DNA histograms could be obtained for 77 carcinomas, and clinical data were available for 71 of these. In these 71 specimens, the nuclear DNA ploidy pattern was also investigated by means of flow cytometry. In 76 of the 77 cases, the image-cytometric DNA ploidy pattern obtained showed a \"nondiploid\" distribution with modal values as high as 8.5 c. In 21 cases, the neoplastic cells showed modal values in the \"triploid\" region. The analogous 71 flow-cytometric DNA histograms could only be evaluated in 50 cases because of excessively high amounts of background and/or excessively broad peaks. In 47 cases, the nuclear DNA histogram was nondiploid according to both techniques. The patients with carcinomas whose cell nuclei showed a triploid DNA distribution showed a significantly shorter survival time than those with tumor cell populations of nontriploid DNA distribution patterns. In the 8 specimens of chronic pancreatitis, the parenchymal cells were all equipped with nuclei showing diploid DNA distribution patterns.\r"

Although many disease activity measures have been devised, they are not widely accepted by clinicians because existing ones are no better than a carefully obtained clinical assessment. Furthermore, health status is determined not only by disease activity, but also by the psychological state, cultural influences, degree of social support, and effects of complications, previous surgery, and medication. To develop more accurate appraisals of the impact and severity of IBD, we must prospectively evaluate the biological and psychosocial measures that predict clinically relevant outcomes. We should then be able to develop statistically weighted scales related to specific outcome variables. Such knowledge will help us to develop more sensitive measures of illness, particularly in patients with mild disease for whom present indices are insensitive. This type of assessment should also aid in the understanding of health care utilization, medical vs. surgical options, resource allocation, and the efficacy of therapeutic trials.\r"

  ".W": "Because earlier ambulation and discharge after cardiac catheterization may result in the increased utilization of outpatient facilities, a prospective five center clinical pilot trial assessing the safety and outcome of early ambulation after routine left heart catheterization was performed in 287 patients. Catheterization routines at each clinical center were unchanged throughout the study. After the diagnostic catheterization using 5 French (F), preformed, large lumen catheters and arterial puncture compression (mean 15 min, range 5 to 52), 260 patients were ambulated by a physician at a mean time of 2.6 h (range 1.8 to 3.1) after catheterization. Follow-up examination or a phone call 24 to 72 h later was performed to assess late results. The mean age of the patients was 58 years (range 25 to 91); 166 (58%) were men. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 54 +/- 15%. One hundred twenty-seven patients (44%) received intravenous heparin (1,500 to 5,000 U as an intravenous bolus) and 136 (47%) received aspirin. Major complications included transient ischemic attack (one patient) and ventricular tachycardia requiring cardioversion during ventriculography (two patients). A small hematoma (less than 5.0 cm) after ambulation occurred early (from compression to standing) in 14 patients (5%; 9 received heparin, 8 were taking aspirin) and later (after standing to 72 h) in 9 patients (3%; 2 receiving heparin, 2 taking aspirin). Five patients with a hematoma had studies with a 6F sheath. No patient required surgical intervention for early or late hematoma. Only three patients (1%) needed a 7F or 8F catheter because of suboptimal 5F coronary angiography.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Three immunofluorescence patterns were observed: diffuse cytoplasmic on cardiac tissue only (organ-specific), fine striational on cardiac and, to a lesser extent, skeletal muscle (cross-reactive 1) and broad striational on both cardiac and skeletal muscle (cross-reactive 2). Cardiac specificity of the cytoplasmic pattern was confirmed by absorption studies with homogenates of human atrium, skeletal muscle and rat liver. Organ-specific cardiac antibodies (IgG; titer range 1/10 to 1/80) were more frequent in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (17 [26%] of 65) than in those with other cardiac disease (2 [1%] of 208, p less than 0.0001) or heart failure (0 [0%] of 41, p less than 0.001) or in normal subjects (7 [3.5%] of 200, p less than 0.0001). Organ-specific cardiac antibodies were more common in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and in those with fewer symptoms (8 of 15 in New York Heart Association functional class I versus 9 of 50 in classes II to IV, p less than 0.01) and more recent (less than 2 years) onset of disease (9 of 19 versus 8 of 46, p less than 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this study, 112 patients with superficial femoral artery stenosis or occlusion were treated with percutaneous atherectomy. Patients were considered to have a simple lesion if the occluded or stenotic arterial segment was less than 5 cm, and a complex lesion if the length of the occluded segment was greater than 5 cm. All atherectomies were performed in the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries; urokinase thrombolysis was used in conjunction with atherectomy in 16 patients. Atherectomy was considered successful if there was less than 20% residual stenosis determined by arteriography. Initial atherectomy results (30 day patency) were 100% successful in the group with a simple lesion and 93% successful in the group with a complex lesion. At a mean follow-up period of 12 months (range 5 to 24), there was a continued patency rate of 93% and 86%, respectively, in the simple and complex groups. In the patients who had restenosis, all pathologic specimens obtained during the second procedure demonstrated myointimal hyperplasia and organized thrombus. Eight major complications (7.1%) occurred, including one fatal myocardial infarction. The complication rate was 3.5% in the simple group and 8.3% in the complex group. With the exception of the myocardial infarction, all complications were associated with catheter entry site hematomas. Femoropopliteal atherectomy has a high rate of success and low morbidity and mortality for both simple and complex lesions and is a viable and competitive alternative therapy for patients with severe peripheral vascular disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Coronary artery stenosis measurement from coronary arteriograms is dependent on lumen edge determination. In theory, dependence may be minimized by densitometric integration of the entire lumen as compared with densitometric determination of edges alone coupled with calculation of lumen size by geometric formulas. To assess the impact of approximations of lumen border position when densitometric and geometric methods are employed, external, intermediate and internal borders were defined and used with each method to calculate lumen narrowing from images of contrast-filled, asymmetrically stenotic model vessels and from clinically generated coronary arteriograms. Actual cross-sectional area narrowing of models correlated almost perfectly with densitometric narrowing for each of the three border criteria (external: r = 0.99, n = 192; intermediate: r = 0.99, n = 192; internal: r = 0.99, n = 192). Lumen narrowing calculated by assuming a circular lumen geometry with a diameter equal to the distance between these identical borders correlated less well with true area narrowing (external: r = 0.79, n = 192; intermediate: r = 0.83, n = 192; internal: r = 0.78, n = 192); the residual variance of the densitometric regression was significantly less than that of the geometric regression for each of the three border criteria (external: 8.13 versus 372, p less than 0.001; intermediate: 7.39 versus 315, p less than 0.001; internal: 7.13 versus 531, p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The use of Doppler color flow imaging and axial contrast angiography in the preoperative detection of additional ventricular septal defects (in the setting of a known large defect) were compared in a prospective fashion. One hundred seventy-nine infants with two ventricles (each of at least normal size) and a large, nonrestrictive ventricular septal defect underwent reparative surgery before 2 years of age. The reference standard for the presence of additional defects was intraoperative verification or (in cases in which the surgeon did not visualize any additional defect) subsequent identification at postoperative angiography, postoperative color Doppler examination or reoperation. Only six patients (3%) had additional ventricular septal defects confirmed at the time of repair; an additional five (3%) had defects found only postoperatively. The negative predictive value of Doppler color flow imaging and angiography was 0.95 (168 of 176) and 0.97 (168 of 174), respectively. The sensitivity was 0.27 (3 of 11) and 0.45 (5 of 11), respectively. For certain malformations with a very low prevalence of additional muscular defects (such as perimembranous ventricular septal defect with normally aligned great arteries), a clinical trial of reparative surgery without prior invasive study appears reasonable.\r"

  ".W": "Vascular injury represents a critical initiating event in the pathogenesis of various vascular diseases, including atherosclerosis. This review discusses 1) the current understanding and a new pathologic classification of vascular injury; 2) the resultant cellular pathophysiologic responses, specifically, lipid accumulation, platelet aggregation, thrombus formation and smooth muscle cell proliferation; 3) the role of vascular injury in the pathogenesis of spontaneous and accelerated atherosclerosis; and 4) emerging therapeutic approaches in preventing these vascular diseases. The process of type I vascular injury (nondenuding functional injury) followed by lipid accumulation, monocyte and platelet adhesion, smooth muscle cell proliferation and resultant plaque formation represents the prevalent view of the early stages of spontaneous atherogenesis. The syndromes of accelerated atherosclerosis (namely, heart transplant atherosclerosis, coronary vein graft disease and restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) appear to share etiologic mechanisms with spontaneous atherosclerosis by means of the \"response to injury\" hypothesis. However, type II and type III vascular injury (denuding endothelial and intimal injury with or without medial damage) followed by thrombus and its organization by smooth muscle cell proliferation and subsequent fibrosis appear to be responsible for the vascular process. This accelerated and premature occlusive process accounts for significant morbidity and mortality in patients with these conditions. Better understanding of the nature of vascular injury and its pathophysiologic responses in these clinical situations may aid in developing therapeutic strategies for preventing these vascular diseases.\r"

More recently, direct evidence for enteroviral presence in diseased human heart tissues has been obtained by nucleic acid hybridization analyses. Although the data suggest that enteroviral infections may be associated with 18% to 50% of cases of myocarditis or dilated cardiomyopathy, or both, causality has not been established. Unanswered questions remain regarding the specific identity of the enteroviral genomes detected in the human heart and the potential for enteroviruses to persist in the heart.\r"

A monovalent E. coli conjugate vaccine against O18ac antigen was safe and highly immunogenic in humans. A 12-valent conjugate vaccine elicits good levels of antibody in rabbits, and will soon undergo phase I testing in humans.

Considering the increasing incidence of drug resistance, combined with the high case-fatality rate, most research efforts have focused on developing a vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum. A successful vaccine against P. falciparum would be a significant advance in medical science. One must not, however, forget the severe morbidity associated with the other three human malarial species.

Active surveillance during the subsequent rotavirus season revealed 8 cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis in 39 placebo control infants and no cases in 38 WI79-9 vaccine recipients (protection = 100%, P = .003). Six cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis were caused by type 1 and two by type 3 virus.

Diagnoses from autopsies, angiograms, and medical records at Massachusetts General Hospital, 1960-1984, were reviewed to identify patients with septic cortical thrombophlebitis. Only 10 confirmed cases of septic cortical vein thrombosis without sagittal sinus thrombosis were found. Meningitis was present in nine patients; Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated from the blood or cerebrospinal fluid of five patients. Common clinical manifestations included fever, seizures, and focal neurologic signs. Half the patients survived, but three had persistent disabilities. Cortical vein thrombosis could be documented in only approximately 1% of 790 cases of bacterial meningitis. In 97 patients with meningitis who died and had autopsies, cortical thrombophlebitis was identified in 5%. In autopsied patients, other pathologic processes including arteritis, ventriculitis, cavernous sinus thrombosis, and cerebral infarctions were usually more prominent than venous thrombosis. Cortical thrombophlebitis does not appear to be the major cause of seizures or focal neurologic signs during bacterial meningitis.\r"

Of the 317 TMP-resistant Shigella isolates identified during 1975-1988, 175 (55%) collected in 1985-1987 and in 1988 were tested further. Almost all (98%) were highly resistant to TMP, suggesting a plasmid-mediated origin. The type I dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene was detected in 85% of the isolates studied. Twenty-three percent of the type I DHFR-positive isolates failed to hybridize with a probe detecting only Tn7-derived sequences, suggesting that the type I DHFR gene may occur independently of transposon Tn7. Four of the five Shigella species isolated from travelers to Sri Lanka hybridized with the probe for type V DHFR gene, implying a local distribution of the type V DHFR gene. The type II and type III DHFR genes were not found among the isolates studied. Only 12% of the TMP-resistant Shigella isolates failed to hybridize with any of the DHFR gene probes used.\r"

Until now, the only means of identifying EAggEC strains has been the cumbersome HEp-2 cell adhesion assay. The isolation and cloning of a 1-kilobase fragment from the plasmid of EAggEC strain 17-2 is described. This probe is 89% sensitive and 99% specific for EAggEC identification. Thus, this probe should greatly facilitate epidemiologic studies assessing the importance of EAggEC as a diarrheal pathogen.\r"

This procedure amplified a region of the invasive-associated locus (ial) from a crude DNA extract of feces. A synthetic 21-base oligonucleotide corresponding to the ial gene sequence was shown to specifically hybridize only with enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) strains and Shigella species. Upon PCR amplification, a 320-base pair fragment was generated in DNA extracted from feces reconstituted with EIEC or Shigella flexneri but not in DNA from 70 normal stools lacking these organisms and could be readily detected by the ial probe. For identifying Shigella and EIEC, the PCR assay was 10(5)- and 10(2)-fold more sensitive than standard biochemical tests and the macrocolony hybridization assay, respectively. These findings demonstrate a novel methodology for rapid, sensitive, and culture-independent diagnosis of diarrhea caused by these pathogens and underscores the utility of PCR in the diagnostic laboratory.\r"

In addition, a proteinase-deficient mutant strain of Candida albicans (IR24) was compared with the wild-type parent strain (10261) for ability to infect the vagina of pseudoestrus rats under estradiol treatment. Among the 67 women examined, proteinase was detected only in 22 harboring C. albicans (range, 42-233 ng/ml of vaginal fluid), at concentrations significantly higher in the 14 vaginitis patients than in the 8 asymptomatic fungal carriers. Western blots confirmed the presence of only one protein band of approximately 43 kDa, corresponding to that of the purified proteinase, in the ELISA-positive vaginal fluids. Experimental vaginal infection was significantly more extensive and persistent in rats infected with the proteinase-producer strain than in those challenged with the proteinase-deficient mutant, and the enzyme was detected in the vaginas of the former but not of the latter animals. Both strains 10261 and IR24 developed hyphal forms to a roughly similar extent during infection, and both showed a comparable adherence in vitro to vaginal and buccal epithelial cells. The clinical and experimental evidence support a role for secretory proteinase as a virulence factor in the pathogenesis of candidal vaginitis.\r"

To achieve and maintain therapeutic blood quinine concentrations (10 mg/l) safely and rapidly, a consecutive-infusion regimen (7 mg of salt/kg of body weight over 30 min followed by 10 mg of salt/kg of body weight over 4 h) based on pharmacokinetic parameters in cerebral malaria has been suggested. This regimen was evaluated in 16 adults (6 male, 10 female; mean age, 25.9 years) with severe falciparum malaria. Plasma quinine concentrations (mean +/- SE) were 8.7 +/- 1.2 mg/l at 30 min and 11.0 +/- 1.8 mg/l at 4.5 h. There was no electrocardiographic evidence of serious cardiotoxicity during the 4.5-h infusion period, and systolic blood pressure fell by greater than 10 mm Hg in only one patient. Parasite clearance in 13 surviving patients (median count on admission, 438 x 10(3)/microliters; range, 500-122 x 10(4) took an average of 71 h (range, 9-115).

To evaluate the prognostic value of weight loss, the charts of 199 nursing home patients (414 nursing home patient years; mean age 87 years) were reviewed over a 3-year period. Weights recorded at nursing home admission and during the study period were compared with weights at the time of acute care hospitalization, transfer between levels of nursing home care, change in level of functional status, and death. There were no significant changes in weight before acute care hospitalizations, although patients who died lost an average of 10% of their body weight from the time of nursing home admission (P less than .001). In addition, weight loss was associated with decreased functional ability and transfer to a higher level of nursing home care. Despite the association of weight loss with subsequent morbidity and mortality, moderate weight loss of up to 20% was a poor predictor of mortality. Although weight loss is routinely used as a screening tool in the nursing home setting, it is not a sensitive marker for underlying disease. The efficacy of active intervention in nursing home patients who lose weight requires further study.\r"

  ".W": "Tubular cysts consisting of dilatation of the collecting ducts at the level of the subcapsular zone of the kidney were induced in newborn rabbits by a single injection of methylprednisolone acetate. We describe here the structural and compositional modifications of the tubular basement membrane (BM) during the formation, growth, and regression of the tubular cysts. During development of the tubular cysts the cystic BM appeared thickened and multilayered, with numerous matrix vesicles. Alcian blue- (AB) and ruthenium red- (RR) positive material distributed differently along the BM of control and cystic tubuli. While the amount of RR-positive material appeared increased in the cystic BM, no differences in the intensity of the AB staining could be discerned between normal and cystic tubuli. Immunofluorescent staining for laminin and type IV collagen appeared to be slightly decreased in the cystic tubuli. However, the amount of fibronectin appeared clearly increased. These changes in the cystic BM appear at the beginning of the tubular dilatation and are not observed in other renal BM. We suggest that there is a causal relationship between the modifications of the BM and the development of the tubular cysts. Glucocorticoids appear to modify the synthesis and/or secretion of the BM components. An abnormal BM should modify the spatial and chemical signals encoded within the BM that, in turn, could lead to abnormal behavior of the tubular cells. This may result in a loss of the normal developmental constraints imposed upon the tubular epithelium, which then undergoes cystic dilatation. During the regression of the cysts, the abnormalities of the BM progressively disappear. The sharp increase in the number of interstitial cells, which show close relationships with the components of the BM, suggests that these cells may be involved in the removal of the cyst BM.\r"

Autoimmune tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) was induced in BALB/c mice by immunization with trypsin-solubilized LEW rat TBM, while immunization with non-solubilized TBM did not produce the disease. Based on this preliminary experiment we studied the characterization of immunogenic and nephritogenic TBM antigen of the LEW rat. TIN was characterized by severe mononuclear cell infiltrates with multi-nucleated giant cells in the interstitium, tubular destruction and intensive IgG and C3 deposits along the TBM. Anti-TBM antisera and eluate from the nephritic mouse kidneys reacted with the TBM of normal LEW rat kidney by immunofluorescence. LEW rat TBM was also detected immunofluorescently by using antisera from BALB/c mice immunized with autologous trypsin-solubilized TBM. A competitive inhibition test revealed a higher titer of anti-TBM antibody in the eluate than in the adsorption-treated antisera per microgram IgG. Immunoblotting showed one reactive band with a molecular weight of 45,000 daltons, and the blotting patterns in tryptic TBM of the Brown Norway (BN) and LEW rats appeared similar. Amino acid analysis of nephritogenic LEW rat tryptic TBM showed that it contained no hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine, suggesting that this TBM preparation was not collagenous. These findings suggest that tryptic digestion contributes to the release of nephritogenic antigen from the LEW rat TBM and that this antigen system might participate in the immune system involved in the anti-TBM associated TIN that is well known to be induced by non-digested TBM of TBM antigen positive animals.\r"

They were given either calcitriol at a dose of 0.25 to 0.5 micrograms daily (eight patients), or placebo. Transiliac crest bone biopsies were performed before entrance into the study and after 12 months of experimental observation. None of the patients were symptomatic or had biochemical or radiological evidence of bone disease. Of the thirteen patients who completed the study, initial serum 1,25(OH)2D levels were low in seven patients and parathyroid hormone levels were elevated in seven patients. Bone histology was abnormal in all patients. Calcitriol treatment was associated with a significant fall in serum phosphorus concentrations and alkaline phosphatase levels as well as with histological evidence of an amelioration of hyperparathyroid changes. In contrast to previous reports, no deterioration of renal function attributable to the treatment occurred, perhaps because a modest dose of calcitriol was employed combined with meticulous monitoring. Further investigation is required to determine whether alternative therapeutic strategies (smaller doses or intermittent therapy) may avoid the potential for suppressing bone turnover to abnormally low levels in the long term.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin resistance is almost universal among uremic patients. There are, however, two different subgroups of uremic patients with regard to glucose tolerance. About half of uremic patients can augment their insulin secretion in response to glucose loads to overcome the insulin resistance and maintain glucose tolerance. In the other half of uremic patients, insulin secretion following glucose loads is not different from normal values so that glucose intolerance results. There is recent evidence that hyperparathyroidism or vitamin D deficiency may inhibit insulin secretion in uremia. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations correlated inversely with glucose tolerance in adolescents with chronic renal insufficiency. Insulin hypersecretion in response to glucose loads occurred only in uremic patients with normal PTH concentrations. Surgical correction of hyperparathyroidism in uremic patients on hemodialysis led to the resolution of glucose intolerance with an increase in insulin secretion and no change in insulin resistance. However, the role of vitamin D repletion was not separately assessed since these patients were supplemented with vitamin D post-operatively. Medical correction of hyperparathyroidism by high-dose phosphate binders and vitamin D led to similar changes in glucose metabolism in children with chronic renal insufficiency. Glucose intolerance resolved, insulin secretion increased, and insulin resistance persisted. In the latter study, plasma 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (DHCC) increased significantly following phosphate restriction. Recently, a preliminary study showed that intravenous 1,25-DHCC acutely restored glucose tolerance and increased insulin secretion in uremic patients on hemodialysis without simultaneous changes in serum PTH, ionized calcium, phosphate, magnesium or potassium concentrations. Thus, 1,25-DHCC, independently of PTH and calcium, may be important in the control of insulin secretion in uremic patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, carnitine supplementation has not shown a consistent beneficial response in hyperlipidemia. We have compared in a double-blind, cross-over study the effect of dialysate buffer composition (acetate or bicarbonate) on the serum lipid response to L-carnitine supplementation during hemodialysis. We studied nine patients (mean age, 19 years; range, 14 to 23) with hyperlipidemia undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. Plasma levels of carnitines and lipids, including total and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides (TG), were measured at baseline and monthly intervals after receiving 2 grams of L-carnitine or placebo added to dialysis bath for three months. One month of carnitine supplementation in acetate hemodialysis significantly reduced plasma TG (230 +/- 95 to 136 +/- 20 mg/dl; P less than 0.05) and elevated HDL-C (50 +/- 12 to 71 +/- 26 mg/dl; P less than 0.05). However, this effect was no longer observed at the end of three months of supplementation. Bicarbonate hemodialysis had lower baseline TG values, but carnitine supplementation did not modify plasma lipids (TG:144 +/- 87 to 158 +/- 115 mg/dl; HDL-C:50 +/- 23 to 50 +/- 19 mg/dl). Both groups had a significant increase in plasma carnitine levels after carnitine supplementation. These results suggest that bicarbonate hemodialysis may add a protective effect in hyperlipidemia by reducing requirements of carnitine supplementation. On the other hand, carnitine supplementation should be considered in patients with hyperlipidemia undergoing acetate hemodialysis. The observed difference in response between acetate and bicarbonate hemodialysis may be due to enhanced formation of acetyl-CoA and fatty acid synthesis during acetate hemodialysis.\r"

Evidence accumulated over the last few years indicates that increased ingestion of cholesterol accelerates the development of glomerulosclerosis in guinea pigs, rats and rabbits, and in rats with endogenous hyperlipidemia due to the nephrotic syndrome. Lowering the levels of serum lipids ameliorates the progression of renal disease in obese rats, rats with a remnant kidney and rats with the nephrotic syndrome produced by the aminonucleoside of puromycin. Changes in dietary fatty acids also influence the progression of renal disease. Several eicosanoids influence the progression of renal disease in experimental animals. Maneuvers that decrease the production of thromboxane A2 ameliorate renal disease in rats with a remnant kidney and in mice with lupus nephritis. Increasing the production of vasodilatory prostaglandins (PGE2, prostacyclin) seems to have a beneficial role in the progression of renal disease. The mechanisms by which dietary lipids and/or renal eicosanoids affect the progression of renal disease remain to be defined.\r"

Respiratory burst activity is diminished in both PMA-stimulated and unstimulated states compared to healthy controls. Hemodialysis treatment normalizes stimulated hydrogen peroxide production and decreases unstimulated hydrogen peroxide production. Several authors found that resting and stimulated chemiluminescence (CL) during hemodialysis correlate with complement activation, whereas other authors describe the development of CL using dialyzer membranes with only mild anaphylatoxin formation. Alterations in PMN carbohydrate metabolism in uremic patients improve during HD. These alterations may be responsible for disturbances in phagocytosis. Degranulation during HD also occurs in the absence of complement activation. Calcium channel blockers decrease activation of PMNs when dialyzers with only little anaphylatoxin formation are used. Acute renal failure and sepsis induce activation of PMNs. Hemodialysis with membranes made of cuprophan leads to further activation of these PMNs and may contribute to granulocyte dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "This paper reviews experimental findings which support the concept that vasopressin (VP) and the process of urine concentration may be involved in the progression of chronic renal failure (CRF). The influence of dietary protein intake on the progression of CRF may also involve VP and the operation of the concentrating process. VP receptors have been identified in glomeruli and VP is able to constrict mesangial cells as does angiotensin II. Acute VP infusion increases the glomerular transcapillary hydraulic pressure difference, and chronic VP infusion increases GFR. In rats with CRF (induced by 5/6 nephrectomy), VP levels were found elevated. In rats with 5/6 nephrectomy, we increased experimentally water intake in order to decrease circulating VP levels, urine concentration, and free water reabsorption. Several indices of progression of CRF, including proteinuria, hypertension and glomerulosclerosis, were significantly reduced, thus suggesting a contribution of VP in progression. Lowering protein intake in CRF could be beneficial because proteins, but not carbohydrates or lipids, produce metabolic end products (mainly urea, ammonia, protons, etc.) that are excreted by the kidney, and concentrated in the urine. In healthy subjects (man or rat), high protein (HP) intake favors urine concentration and causes changes in kidney function and morphology very similar to those induced by chronic VP infusion or water restriction. These changes involve an increase in transport activity of the thick ascending limb (where the initial active step of the concentrating process takes place) and may affect filtration rate and/or glomerular hemodynamics secondarily, by decreasing salt concentration at the macula densa and depressing tubuloglomerular feedback.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Owing to these changes, measurements of reciprocal creatinine concentration gave erroneous impressions of the rate or existence of progression, during all or a portion of the period of observation, in nearly half of these patients. However, in the 22 studies as a group, using the entire periods of observation, b2 indicated nearly the same mean rate of progression as b1, and had the same variance. We conclude that sequential plasma or serum creatinine measurements in individual patients are often misleading as measures of progression and should, when feasible, be replaced by urinary clearances of isotopes in following patients with chronic renal failure.\r"

Among first-degree relatives at high risk for IDD, 64KA were identified in 23 of 28 persons positive for ICA and 4 of 5 with IAA but no ICA. Among 31 patients with newly diagnosed IDD, 64KA were found in 26. 64KA were identified in 23 of 28 persons studied up to 75 months before clinical onset of IDD. Of these 23 64KA-positive prediabetic subjects, 5 were ICA-negative and 10 lacked IAA. 64KA were most predictive in those who became diabetic before age 34 (22/24). In several individuals, 64KA were detected before the other autoantibodies appeared. These findings suggest that 64KA may be an early and useful predictive marker for IDD.\r"

All 158 urine specimens from seropositive subjects were anti-HIV positive by GACPAT and 157 of them (99.4%) were positive by GACELISA. Tests on 553 urine specimens from seronegative subjects gave two repeatable false-positive reactions by GACPAT (0.4%) and none by GACELISA. By means of a modified procedure anti-gp160 was detected by commercial western blot in the urine of 44 of 45 seropositive subjects examined. IgG-capture assays will detect anti-HIV in unconcentrated urine and so allow a diagnosis in circumstances when blood sampling is impracticable.\r"

Systems based on probabilistic reasoning have been developed and applied within limited domains (e.g., acute abdominal pain) and for the general diagnosis of systemic disorders. Less progress has been made in the development and application of diagnostic systems based on \"artificial intelligence\", reflecting theoretical limits to this application of computers to medicine and the enormity of the task. The presently available probabilistic systems have recently been joined by a new microcomputer-based system, MEDITEL Computer-Assisted Diagnosis, Adult System. The performance of this system was evaluated with both clinical-pathologic conference cases and consecutive admissions with undiagnosed illnesses. The correct diagnosis appeared on the list generated by the system in 80 to 90% of the cases. Experience with this and other systems illustrates current issues in the evaluation of computer systems for aid in diagnosis and of computer-based medical \"expert\" systems in general. These issues include physician acceptance of these systems and the ethical, legal, and regulatory aspects of computer system application. We conclude that, in appropriately selected cases, the accuracy and efficiency of physician diagnosis can be enhanced with computer assistance, and the risk of overlooking the correct diagnosis can be reduced.\r"

Review of the multifactorial pathophysiology of age-related bone loss in men suggests that routine maintenance of adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, exercise, early recognition and treatment of testosterone deficiency, and modification of other osteoporotic risk factors may have prophylactic value. Future basic research on the cellular biology of bone in health and disease and clinical trials assessing the effects of long-term prophylactic and treatment regimens on bone mass and fracture occurrence will expand the understanding of osteoporosis in men.\r"

  ".W": "We studied 433 patients with syncope to derive insights into the diagnostic evaluation and outcome of patients with this common problem. This study shows that the etiology of syncope was not found in approximately 41% of patients. When a cause of syncope was determined, it was most frequently established on the basis of initial history, physical examination and an electrocardiogram (EKG). Furthermore, many of the other entities (e.g., aortic stenosis, subclavian steal) were suggested by findings on the history and physical examinations that required directed diagnostic testing. Initial EKG was abnormal in 50% of patients but led to a cause of syncope infrequently (less than 7%). Prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring, which has assumed a central role in the evaluation of syncope, led to a specific cause in only 22% of patients. Other tests were less often helpful in assigning a cause of syncope. At 5 years, the mortality of 50.5% in patients with a cardiac cause of syncope was significantly higher than the 30% mortality in patients with a noncardiac cause or 24.1% in patients with an unknown cause. At 5 years, a mortality of 50.5% in patients with a cardiac cause of syncope was noted. There were 54 actual deaths in this group as compared to 10.7 expected deaths based on 1980-86 mortality data from Allegheny County, PA (standardized mortality ratio = 5.02). At 5 years, a 33.1% incidence of sudden death was noted in patients with cardiac cause of syncope, as compared with 4.9% in patients with a noncardiac cause and 8.5% in patients with an unknown cause. Mortality and sudden death remained significant for the first 3 years after which the survival curves were parallel. A cardiac cause of syncope was an independent predictor of sudden death and mortality. Recurrences were common but were not associated with an increased risk of mortality or sudden death. Major vascular events were also more frequent in patients with cardiac causes of syncope. The results of this study will be helpful in designing future studies to evaluate the usefulness of newer diagnostic techniques. Furthermore, short- and long-term outcome data will be useful in planning intervention strategies in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "Although electromyography (EMG = nerve conduction and needle electromyographic examination) is among the most sensitive and reliable approaches to detect and even to characterize certain aspects of nerve disease, it is important for physicians to appreciate that EMG has limited value in (1) inferring symptoms and neuropathic deficit (particularly the overall deficit recorded by clinical neurologists), (2) inferring involvement of small-diameter fibers, (3) inferring underlying biochemical or other pathophysiologic derangement, (4) inferring the presence and type and pathologic alterations in single fibers or Schwann cells, or (5) inferring interstitial pathologic abnormality. For 1 and 2, an adequate neurologic history and examination is needed. For 2, quantitative sensory (QSE) and quantitative autonomic (QAE) examination and histologic study of nerve often are especially helpful. For 3, clinical evaluation and a variety of laboratory examinations are needed. For 4 and 5, clinical evaluation and/or pathologic study of nerve may be needed. Electromyography has deservedly gained considerable acceptance as a worthwhile evaluative procedure for the study of neuromuscular disease. For some purposes, however, it is of limited value and other evaluative procedures are more informative. In this review, I trace the history of some of the reasons for the popularity of EMG and highlight some of its limitations. The purpose is not to diminish EMG or to elevate the procedure of nerve biopsy, rather to provide a conceptual framework for how these techniques and the clinical and other laboratory examinations can be used together in the assessment and follow-up of neuropathy.\r"

  ".W": "We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of inosine pranobex (Isoprinosine) [corrected] in the treatment of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection but without manifest acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). A total of 866 patients were enrolled in 21 centers in Denmark and Sweden. The patients were stratified in three groups according to their CD4+ cell count and randomly assigned to receive either inosine pranobex (1 g three times a day) (n = 429) or matching placebo (n = 437) for 24 weeks. Of the 831 patients who could be evaluated, AIDS developed in 17 in the placebo group as compared with 2 in the inosine pranobex group (P less than 0.001; odds ratio, 8.6 [95 percent confidence limits, 2.2 and 52.6]). There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to changes in CD4+ cell count or the development of other HIV-related conditions, with the exception of thrush, which developed in fewer patients in the inosine pranobex group (P = 0.05). No serious side effects were observed. We conclude that treatment with inosine pranobex delays progression to AIDS in patients with HIV infection. The duration of this beneficial effect, the optimal dose, and the mode of action of inosine pranobex remain to be clarified.\r"
