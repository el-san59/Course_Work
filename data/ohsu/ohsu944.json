  ".W": "This paper reports an analysis of the protein composition of highly purified mammalian spliceosomes isolated by a two-step large-scale affinity chromatography procedure. Splicing complexes were assembled in vitro on biotinylated pre-mRNA, fractionated by gel filtration, and then affinity-purified by binding to avidin-agarose. The purified spliceosomes are unexpectedly complex, containing at least 50 proteins that range in molecular mass from less than 14 to 200 kDa. Three complexes that assemble in the absence of ATP were also purified and characterized. These include a complex enriched in the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle U1 and non-specific complexes assembled either on pre-mRNA or an RNA lacking splice sites. Comparison between these complexes and the spliceosome revealed a distinct set of pre-mRNA-specific proteins and a set of proteins that bind to pre-mRNA only in the presence of ATP. Proteins in these two classes, many of which do not correspond in size to known small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle proteins, are strong candidates for functional splicing components.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the function of the human small (46-kDa) mannose 6-phosphate receptor (SMPR) in transfected mouse L cells that do not express the larger insulin-like growth factor II/mannose 6-phosphate receptor. Cells overexpressing human SMPR were studied for enzyme binding to cell surface receptors, for binding to intracellular receptors in permeabilized cells, and for receptor-mediated endocytosis of recombinant human beta-glucuronidase. Specific binding to human SMPR in permeabilized cells showed a pH optimum between pH 6.0 and pH 6.5. Binding was significant in the presence of EDTA but was enhanced by added divalent cations. Up to 2.3% of the total functional receptor could be detected on the cell surface by enzyme binding. We present experiments showing that at very high levels of overexpression, and at pH 6.5, human SMPR mediated the endocytosis of beta-glucuronidase. At pH 7.5, the rate of endocytosis was only 14% the rate seen at pH 6.5. Cells overexpressing human SMPR also showed reduced secretion of newly synthesized beta-glucuronidase when compared to cells transfected with vector only, suggesting that overexpressed human SMPR can participate in sorting of newly synthesized beta-glucuronidase and partially correct the sorting defect in mouse L cells that do not express the insulin-like growth factor II/mannose 6-phosphate receptor.\r"

  ".U": "91045933\r", 
  ".W": "Some undifferentiated F9 embryonal carcinoma cells allow adenovirus genes to be expressed independently of the E1a oncogene normally required for their activation; this has been attributed to a cellular equivalent of E1a in F9 cells. However, transcription of all early genes was low in undifferentiated OTF963 embryonic carcinoma cells during the first 48 hr after infection with adenovirus type 5 (Ad5). Transcription then increased to about the level seen 16 hr after infection of cells induced to differentiate by retinoic acid (RA) (referred to as RA-dF9 cells), but this increase did not occur in cells infected by the E1a deletion mutant dl312. Addition of E1a in trans, or of RA, had no immediate effect on viral transcription in OTF963 cells, but viral transcription increased about 48 hr after these additions. Ad5 induced transcription of several differentiation-specific genes in OTF963 cells with about the same kinetics as their induction by RA. These genes were superinduced in RA-dF9 cells by cAMP or infection by adenovirus. We suggest the small amount of E1a produced early in infection of OTF963 cells activates cellular genes, some of which are differentiation specific and required for efficient transcription of viral genes, so that E1a both induces and is induced by differentiation. The simple hypothesis of a cellular equivalent to E1a does not adequately explain the complex interactions between viral and cellular genes in OTF963 embryonic carcinoma cells.\r"

Linkage was analyzed in 13 families with two or three affected sibs comprising a total of 84 individuals. Positive two-point logarithm-of-odds (lod) scores were obtained between the DD locus and three polymorphic markers on chromosome 5. The highest pairwise lod score estimate of 7.37 with zero recombination to locus D5S72 suggests very tight linkage. There was no evidence of heterogeneity. Multipoint linkage analysis against the published order of the three loci gave the result centromere-D5S84-(DD, D5S72)-D5S61-terminus with a four-point lod score of 9.11. The present findings place the DD locus distal to the gene for adenomatous polyposis coli on the distal part of the long arm of chromosome 5. Our results provide a basis for refining the map position of the DD locus followed by physical localization, isolation, and characterization of the gene.\r"

We have used a screen that combines polymerase chain reaction amplification of genomic DNA and low-stringency hybridization with degenerate oligonucleotides to isolate human BDNF and a human gene, neurotrophin-3, that is closely related to both nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. mRNA products of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-3 genes were detected in the adult human brain, suggesting that these proteins are involved in the maintenance of the adult nervous system.

Important targets for these retinal fibers are the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus, which are thought to be primary sites for the biological clock. The neurotransmitters that operate in this projection system have not yet been determined. Immunohistochemistry and radioimmunoassay performed with affinity-purified antibodies to N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) demonstrate that this neuron-specific dipeptide, which may act as an excitatory neurotransmitter, is localized extensively in the retinohypothalamic tract and its target zones, including the SCN. Optic nerve transections resulted in significant reductions in NAAG immunoreactivity in the optic chiasm and SCN. Analysis of NAAG concentrations in micropunches of SCN, by means of radioimmunoassay, showed approximately 50% reductions in NAAG levels. These results suggest that this peptide may act as one of the neurotransmitters involved in retinohypothalamic communication and circadian rhythm entrainment.\r"

We have previously shown that pac is a 162-base-pair segment of P1 DNA that contains seven DNA adenine methyltransferase methylation sites (5'-GATC). We show here that cleavage of pac is methylation sensitive. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments indicate that methylated pac is cleavable, whereas unmethylated pac is not. Moreover, DNA isolated from P1 phage and containing an uncut pac site was a poor substrate for in vitro cleavage until it was methylated by the Escherichia coli DNA adenine methyltransferase. Comparison of that uncut pac DNA with other viral DNA fragments by digestion with methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes indicated that the uncut pac DNA was preferentially undermethylated. In contrast, virion DNA containing a cut pac site was not undermethylated. We believe these results indicate that pac cleavage is regulated by adenine methylation during the phage lytic cycle.\r"

We studied the role of the HIV type 2 (HIV-2) nef and vpr genes in viral tropism. HIV-2 mutants, lacking either vpr or nef genes, or both vpr and nef, were obtained by site-specific mutagenesis of a biologically active HIV-2 proviral clone (HIV-2sbl/isy), which is infectious in both human T cells and macrophages. Viral progeny carrying mutations of nef, vpr, or of both nef and vpr genes replicated more efficiently than the parental virus in primary human peripheral blood cells and in the human Hut 78 T-cell line. In contrast, the HIV-2 nef- mutant infected human macrophages as efficiently as the parental virus, whereas viruses lacking the vpr gene either alone or in conjunction with the lack of the nef gene did not replicate in macrophages. Thus, some lack of nef in HIV-2 enhances viral replication in T cells and does not interfere with viral replication in primary macrophages, whereas vpr is essential for replication of HIV-2 in human macrophages. Because the parental HIV-2sbl/isy cloned virus also infects rhesus macaques, the use in animal studies of these HIV-2 mutants with differences in cell tropism and rates of replication will be highly useful in understanding the mechanism of viral infectivity and possibly pathogenicity in vivo.\r"

Recent evidence of impaired thrombopoiesis in HIV-1-related thrombocytopenia suggested that these cells could be directly infected by the virus and prompted a search for a receptor on megakaryocytes of normal subjects that could permit entry of HIV-1. Bone marrow specimens from uninfected normal control subjects were centrifuged over Ficoll-Hypaque (1.077 g/ml) and analyzed by three-color analysis with a flow cytometer utilizing monoclonal antibodies against CD4 and a glycoprotein present on the surface of megakaryocytes and platelets (GPIIb/IIIa; CD41), as well as 7-aminoactinomycin D, a stain for DNA. Cells presumed to be megakaryocytes were identified by having a DNA content greater than tetraploid and staining brightly with anti-CD41. Approximately 0.4% of the nucleated cells of the marrow met these criteria. Twenty-five percent of these megakaryocytes stained as brightly as CD4+ T cells. Several clones of antibody recognizing different epitopes of the CD4 molecule gave similar results. Platelets were CD4-. Staining of megakaryocytes with anti-CD4 was confirmed by direct microscopic examination of Percoll-gradient-enriched megakaryocytes employing two-color (CD4-phycoerythrin and CD41-fluorescein) immunofluorescence analysis and phase-contrast microscopy. The proportion of double-labeled cells among 112 phase-contrast-identifiable megakaryocytes from five bone marrow specimens varied between 20% and 26% with a mean and SD of 22% +/- 2.5%. Thus some human megakaryocytes express CD4 on their surface that should be capable of binding the HIV-1 gp120 envelope protein. This could serve as a portal of entry for HIV-1.\r"

The expression of c-myb is induced in mitogen-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes and is constitutively expressed in several CD4+ T-cell and myeloid cell lines, all of which constitute excellent targets for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and replication. We looked for the presence of Myb-binding motifs in human retroviral long terminal repeats (LTRs) and tested for Myb binding to HIV-1 LTR sequences by using a highly purified recombinant Myb protein. Our results show that HIV-1 LTR contains one high-affinity Myb-binding site along with two or more low-affinity binding sites. DNase I protection analysis as well as oligonucleotide competition experiments indicate that this binding is sequence specific. Introduction of purified Myb protein directly into HeLa cells harboring HIV-1 LTR chloramphenicol acetyltransferase vectors indicates that Myb protein transactivates HIV-1 LTR-mediated transcription. Thus, Myb protein binding to HIV LTR sequences may constitute one of the signals that regulates HIV-1 transcription.\r"

We show here that the steroid dexamethasone significantly increases total surface AChRs on cultured human muscle exposed to myasthenia gravis sera. Our results suggest that the clinical improvement observed in myasthenic patients treated with steroids is due not only to an effect on the immune system but also to a direct effect on muscle. We propose that the identification and development of pharmacologic agents that augment receptors and other proteins that are reduced by human genetic or autoimmune disease will have broad therapeutic applications.\r"

  ".W": "The retrovirus-like particles of Drosophila are intermediates of retrotransposition of the transposable element copia. In these particles, a 39-nucleotide-long fragment from the 5' region of Drosophila initiator methionine tRNA (tRNA(iMet) is used as the primer for copia minus-strand reverse transcription. To function as primer for this reverse transcription, the Drosophila tRNA(iMet) must be cleaved in vivo at the site between nucleotides 39 and 40. When a synthetic Drosophila tRNA(iMet) precursor was incubated with M1RNA, the catalytic RNA of Escherichia coli RNase P, other cleavages within the mature tRNA sequence were detected in addition to the efficient removal of the 5' leader sequence of this tRNA precursor. One of these cleavage sites is between nucleotides 39 and 40 of Drosophila tRNA(iMet). Based on this result, we propose a model for formation of the primer tRNA fragment for reverse transcription in copia retrovirus-like particles.\r"

To explore the biological role of the carboxyl-terminal portion of the myosin tail, we have created a Dictyostelium cell line bearing a mutation designated my delta C34 in the myosin (mhcA) locus. This cell line produces a truncated myosin protein lacking the 34-kDa carboxyl terminus of the wild-type tail. Southern blots of the mutant cells show that the myosin gene was disrupted by homologous recombination of the transforming plasmid into the myosin locus. Based on in vitro studies of myosin functional domains, the 200-kDa truncated myosin was designed to include a domain important for assembly but to eliminate a domain important for threonine phosphorylation. The mutant cells are defective in cytokinesis, similar to those mutants that are either devoid of myosin (null cells) or contain a truncated 140-kDa myosin (hmm cells). However, unlike previous mutants, the cells carrying the my delta C34 mutation are able to complete the Dictyostelium developmental cycle to form fruiting bodies. Thus a truncated 200-kDa myosin can substitute for native myosin to function in developing cells. These results demonstrate that the 34-kDa carboxyl terminus of myosin, which contributes regulated phosphorylation sites and 20% of the total length of the rod, is not required for the developmental cycle of Dictyostelium.\r"

In the human erythroid cell line K562, competition of the epsilon-globin major cap site promoter linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene (epsilon P-CAT) with the same promoter fragment linked to a neomycin resistance gene (epsilon P-NEO) leads to a reduction in CAT activity. This indicates the specific presence of K562 cells of factor(s) which interact with the 200-bp promoter fragment (isolated from the gene body or flanking sequences) to activate transcription from the epsilon-globin major cap site. Competition of the epsilon-globin major promoter (as epsilon P-CAT) with the upstream minor epsilon-globin promoter (as epsilon P2-NEO) also leads to a reduction in CAT activity, indicating that both promoters share erythroid-specific trans-acting factors. The reverse competition (epsilon P2-CAT with epsilon P-NEO) leads to an increase in CAT activity, suggesting that the existence of erythroid-specific factor(s) which repress transcription from the 200-bp-upstream epsilon-globin promoter.\r"

  ".W": "Pneumococcal peptidoglycan amidase (N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase, EC 3.5.1.28) and phage CPL1 lysozyme degrade a common substrate (choline-containing pneumococcal cell walls); the former hydrolyzes the bond between muramic acid and alanine, whereas the latter breaks down the linkage between muramic acid and glucosamine. The amino acid sequences of their C-terminal domains are homologous. Chimeric genes were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis: a unique SnaBI restriction site in the cpl1 gene, coding for the phage lysozyme, was introduced at a location equivalent to the SnaBI site present in the lytA gene, which codes for the pneumococcal amidase. The resulting genes expressed lytic activities at levels similar to those of the parental genes. The gene products, which have been purified to electrophoretical homogeneity, exhibited unusual combined biochemical properties--e.g., by exchange of protein domains, we have switched the regulatory properties of these enzymes without altering their catalytic activities. Chimeric gene construction in Streptococcus pneumoniae and its bacteriophages is an excellent model to study the modular organization of genes and proteins and to help to establish evolutionary relationships between phage and bacteria. These constructions provide an experimental approach to the molecular processes involved in cassette recruitment during evolution and contribute support to the concept of bacteria as adaptable chimeras.\r"

  ".U": "91045951\r", 
  ".W": "An operon encoding four proteins required for bacterial cellulose biosynthesis (bcs) in Acetobacter xylinum was isolated via genetic complementation with strains lacking cellulose synthase activity. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that the cellulose synthase operon is 9217 base pairs long and consists of four genes. The four genes--bcsA, bcsB, bcsC, and bcsD--appear to be translationally coupled and transcribed as a polycistronic mRNA with an initiation site 97 bases upstream of the coding region of the first gene (bcsA) in the operon. Results from genetic complementation tests and gene disruption analyses demonstrate that all four genes in the operon are required for maximal bacterial cellulose synthesis in A. xylinum. The calculated molecular masses of the proteins encoded by bcsA, bcsB, bcsC, and bcsD are 84.4, 85.3, 141.0, and 17.3 kDa, respectively. The second gene in the operon (bcsB) encodes the catalytic subunit of cellulose synthase. The functions of the bcsA, bcsC, and bcsD gene products are unknown. Bacterial strains mutated in the bcsA locus were found to be deficient in cellulose synthesis due to the lack of cellulose synthase and diguanylate cyclase activities. Mutants in the bcsC and bcsD genes were impaired in cellulose production in vivo, even though they had the capacity to make all the necessary metabolic precursors and cyclic diguanylic acid, the activator of cellulose synthase, and exhibit cellulose synthase activity in vitro. When the entire operon was present on a multicopy plasmid in the bacterial cell, both cellulose synthase activity and cellulose biosynthesis increased. When the promoter of the cellulose synthase operon was replaced on the chromosome by E. coli tac or lac promoters, cellulose production was reduced in parallel with decreased cellulose synthase activity. These observations suggest that the expression of the bcs operon is rate-limiting for cellulose synthesis in A. xylinum.\r"

Pairs of tissue samples from colorectal cancer and histologically normal mucosa 5-10 cm away from the tumor were obtained from 11 patients who underwent partial colectomy. All cancer specimens displayed abnormal spectra compared with the corresponding normal tissues. These changes involved the phosphate and C-O stretching bands, the CH stretch region, and the pressure dependence of the CH2 bending and C = O stretching modes. Our findings indicate that in colonic malignant tissue, there are changes in the degree of hydrogen-bonding of (i) oxygen atoms of the backbone of nucleic acids (increased); (ii) OH groups of serine, tyrosine, and threonine residues (any or all of them) of cell proteins (decreased); and (iii) the C = O groups of the acyl chains of membrane lipids (increased). In addition, they indicate changes in the structure of proteins and membrane lipids (as judged by the changes in their ratio of methyl to methylene groups) and in the packing and the conformational structure of the methylene chains of membrane lipids. The cell(s) of the malignant colon tissues responsible for these spectral abnormalities is unknown. Cultured colon adenocarcinoma cell lines displayed similarly abnormal FT-IR spectra. The diagnostic potential of the observed changes is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Interactions between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs on dendrites determine the level of activity in neurons. Models based on the cable equation predict that silent shunting inhibition can strongly veto the effect of an excitatory input. The cable model assumes that ionic concentrations do not change during the electrical activity, which may not be a valid assumption, especially for small structures such as dendritic spines. We present here an analysis and computer simulations to show that for large Cl- conductance changes, the more general Nernst-Planck electrodiffusion model predicts that shunting inhibition on spines should be much less effective than that predicted by the cable model. This is a consequence of the large changes in the intracellular ionic concentration of Cl- that can occur in small structures, which would alter the reversal potential and reduce the driving force for Cl-. Shunting inhibition should therefore not be effective on spines, but it could be significantly more effective on the dendritic shaft at the base of the spine. In contrast to shunting inhibition, hyperpolarizing synaptic inhibition mediated by K+ currents can be very effective in reducing the excitatory synaptic potentials on the same spine if the excitatory conductance change is less than 10 nS. We predict that if the inhibitory synapses found on cortical spines are to be effective, then they should be mediated by K+ through GABAB receptors.\r"

Promoters containing the palindromic T3 response element TCAGGTCA TGACCTGA are positively regulated by the T3 receptor after the administration of T3, whereas otherwise identical promoters containing the estrogen response element TCAGGTCA CTG TGACCTGA can be regulated negatively; converse effects are observed with the estrogen receptor. We describe evidence that the transcriptional inhibitory effects of the T3 or estrogen receptors on the estrogen or T3 response elements, respectively, are imposed by amino acid sequences in the C'-terminal region that colocalize with dimerization and hormone-binding domains and that these sequences can transfer inhibitory functions to other classes of transcription factors. Removal of the C'-terminal dimerization and hormone-binding domains of either the alpha T3 or estrogen receptors permits each receptor to act constitutively to enhance transcription on both T3 and estrogen response elements. It is, therefore, suggested that protein-protein interactions between receptor C' termini limit the subset of DNA binding sites on which transcriptional activation occurs.\r"

To compare the sexual transmission and oncogenic nature of RhPV-1 with these HPVs, we undertook an extensive retrospective study of a group of rhesus monkeys whose sexual mating and offspring histories were known. These animals had mated directly with the index male mentioned above or were secondarily exposed to this virus through intermediate sexual partners. This study combines cytological, histopathological, and several complementary hybridization and DNA amplification techniques on multiple tissue samples to demonstrate the sexually transmitted nature of RhPV-1. The oncogenic potential of RhPV-1 is suggested in several of the infected animals by the presence of various degrees of neoplasia including squamous cell cancer of the cervix.\r"

After fusion was complete, the cycloheximide was washed out, protein synthesis was resumed, and the rates of reappearance of serum albumin and procollagen I in the two separated Golgi apparatuses within each heterokaryon were followed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Serum albumin was found to always reappear first in the Golgi apparatus contributed by the Hep G2 half of the heterokaryon, and procollagen I in the Golgi apparatus of the WI-38 half. These results suggest that the endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi apparatus transfer in situ is not simply a stochastic process but is either spatially restricted or exhibits cell-type specificity or both.\r"

Overexpression of the TK14 protein by transfection of COS-1 cells with the corresponding cDNA in a simian virus 40-based expression vector leads to the appearance of new cell-surface binding sites for both acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors. This has been demonstrated by specific binding assays and chemical cross-linking experiments using 125I-labeled growth factors. It appears, therefore, that the human genome contains at least two distinct genes, for TK14 and FLG, that code for related fibroblast growth factor receptors.\r"

We now show that equilibrium dissociation constants for complexes between the Tetrahymena ribozyme and its RNA substrates and products can be directly measured by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels containing divalent cations. Binding is 10(3)- to 10(4)-fold tighter (4-5 kcal/mol at 42 degrees C) than expected from base-pairing interactions alone, implying that tertiary interactions also contribute to energetic stabilization. Binding decreases with single base changes in the substrate, substitution of deoxyribose sugars, and lower Mg2+ concentration. Ca2+, which enables the ribozyme to fold but is unable to mediate efficient RNA cleavage, promotes weaker substrate binding than Mg2+. This indicates that Mg2+ has special roles in both substrate binding and catalysis. Mutagenesis of a region near the internal guide sequence disrupts substrate binding, whereas binding is not significantly affected by a mutation of the guanosine-binding site. This approach should be generally useful for analysis of ribozyme variants independent of their catalytic activities.\r"

Evidence supporting the pairing of certain of these sequences has come from the comparison of intron sequences and from the analysis of mutations that disrupt splicing by interfering with pairing. One of the structures proposed for all group I introns is an internal guide sequence that base pairs with the upstream and the downstream exons, bringing them into alignment for ligation. We made specific mutations in the internal guide sequence and the flanking exons of the fifth intron in the yeast mitochondrial gene for apocytochrome b (COB). Mutations that disrupted the pairing between the internal guide sequence and the upstream exon (the P1 pairing) blocked addition of guanosine to the 5' end of the intron during autocatalytic reactions and prevented formation of the full-length circular intron. In contrast, transcripts containing mutations that disrupted the pairing between the guide sequence and the downstream exon (the P10 helix) initiated splicing but failed to ligate exons. Compensatory mutations that restored helices of normal stability mitigated the effects of the original mutations. These data provide direct evidence for the importance of the base pairing between the internal guide sequence and the downstream exon in the splicing of a wild-type group I intron.\r"

The results show one principal early folding intermediate (I1), which is formed rapidly after the start of folding and whose proton-exchange properties change with the time of folding. All probes that are hydrogen bonded within the beta-sheet of native ribonuclease A are protected in I1. Thus, the results suggest that the beta-sheet is formed rapidly and cooperatively. The initial protection factors of probes in the beta-sheet are between 10 and 100, but they increase with time of folding and exceed 1000 at 400 msec from the start of folding. Thus, the beta-sheet is only moderately stable when it is first formed, but subsequent events stabilize it, possibly through interactions involving hydrophobic side chains. The large protection factors of the beta-sheet probes in an early folding intermediate are unexpected and remarkable. Probes in the three alpha-helices are fewer in number and give less accurate data than the beta-strand probes. The folding kinetics expected for a simple sequential model of folding are outlined. An important difference between the observed and predicted behavior is that the early folding intermediate is not fully populated when it is first formed.\r"

When the particular form of the thymidine-rich element found in the pol I enhancer was placed in front of a pol II promoter, transcription was stimulated 43-fold, comparable to the effect of a powerful pol II activator such as Gal4. Conversely, when two copies of a thymidine-rich element from a pol II enhancer were placed upstream of a pol I promoter, transcription was stimulated 38-fold. This functional reciprocity of pol I and II enhancers may reflect similarities in the mechanisms of transcriptional activation. The pol I enhancer also contains an element that appears to be pol I-specific and prevent the activation of pol II.\r"

The terminal telomere sequences of the green alga Chlamydomonas are composed of (TTTTAGGG)n repeats that are similar, but not identical, to those of the higher plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We demonstrate that these repeats are telomeric by their preferential sensitivity to nuclease Bal-31 digestion, their similarity to A. thaliana telomeres, their orientation relative to the end of the chromosome, and the methods used for their isolation. Five independent telomere clones were isolated, and three of these clones include closely related telomere-associated sequences. One of these telomere-associated sequences hybridizes to a number of genomic fragments sensitive to digestion with the exonuclease Bal-31. Like telomere sequences from other organisms, the C. reinhardtii telomeres display a bias for guanine and thymine nucleotides on the 3'-end strand. However, the sequence of Chlamydomonas telomeres is more A + T-rich than any other known telomere sequence. We propose that the common feature of all known telomere is the frequent occurrence of tracts of three or more adjacent guanine residues.\r"

We have found that sodium azide is an extremely rapid and potent inhibitor of protein export in vivo and that azi mutants are more resistant to such inhibition. Furthermore, SecA-dependent in vitro protein translocation and ATPase activities are inhibited by sodium azide, and SecA protein prepared from an azi mutant strain is more resistant to such inhibition.

  ".W": "Yeast artificial chromosome cloning is an attractive technology for genomic mapping studies because very large DNA segments can be readily propagated. However, detailed analyses often require the extensive application of blotting-hybridization techniques because artificial chromosomes are normally present at only one copy per haploid genome. We have developed a cloning vector and host strain that alleviate this problem by permitting copy number amplification of artificial chromosomes. The vector includes a conditional centromere that can be turned on or off by changing the carbon source. Strong selective pressure for extra copies of the artificial chromosome can be applied by selecting for the expression of a heterologous thymidine kinase gene. When this system was used, artificial chromosomes ranging from about 100 to 600 kilobases in size were readily amplified 10- to 20-fold. The selective conditions did not induce obvious rearrangements in any of the clones tested. Reactivation of the centromere in amplified artificial chromosome clones resulted in stable maintenance of an elevated copy number for 20 generations. Applications of copy number control to various aspects of artificial chromosome analysis are addressed.\r"

Although the majority of the molecular probes used in this study can be unambiguously assigned to established linkage groups, the electrophoretic karyotype differs between the closely related strains AX3k and NC4, suggesting that chromosomal fragmentation may have occurred during their maintenance and growth. The largest chromosome identified in this study is approximately 9 million base pairs. To achieve resolution with molecules of this size, programmed voltage gradients were used in addition to programmed pulse times.\r"

  ".U": "91045975\r", 
  ".W": "The 5' region of the gene encoding human X chromosome-linked phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) is a promoter-containing CpG island known to be methylated at 119 of 121 CpG dinucleotides in a 450-base-pair region on the inactive human X chromosome in the hamster-human cell line X8-6T2. Here we report the use of polymerase chain reaction-aided genomic sequencing to determine the complete methylation pattern of this region in clones derived from X8-6T2 cells after treatment with the methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine. We find (i) a clone showing full expression of human phosphoglycerate kinase is fully unmethylated in this region; (ii) clones not expressing human phosphoglycerate kinase remain methylated at approximately 50% of CpG sites, with a pattern of interspersed methylated (M) and unmethylated (U) sites different for each clone; (iii) singles, defined as M-U-M or U-M-U, are common; and (iv) a few CpG sites are partially methylated. The data are interpreted according to a model of multiple, autonomous CpG sites, and estimates are made for two key parameters, maintenance efficiency (Em approximately 99.9% per site per generation) and de novo methylation efficiency (Ed approximately 5%). These parameter values and the hypothesis that several independent sites must be unmethylated for transcription can explain the stable maintenance of X chromosome inactivation. We also consider how the active region is kept free of methylation and suggest that transcription inhibits methylation by decreasing Em so that methylation cannot be maintained. Thus, multiple CpG sites, independent with respect to a dynamic methylation system, can stabilize two alternative states of methylation and transcription.\r"

  ".W": "We hypothesized that cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) may utilize extracellular ATP (ATPo) during the effector phase of the CTL-target cell interactions and that CTL could be the source of ATPo. It is demonstrated here that incubation of CTL with activating ligands [Con A or monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR)] results in the extracellular Ca2(+)-independent accumulation of the ATPo. The addition of the ATP-degrading enzymes into the mixture of CTL and target cells results in a strong inhibition of the CTL-mediated, TCR-triggered lethal-hit delivery to the target cell. In a parallel control experiment, the employed enzymes did not affect target cell-induced, TCR-triggered exocytosis of granules from CTL. Thus, the removal of ATPo with enzymes does not interfere with the activation of CTL by the target cell but does block lytic events. Cloned helper T lymphocytes also accumulate ATPo after incubation with anti-TCR mAb or Con A, suggesting the possibility that ATPo, which acts in concert with ectoprotein kinases and/or purinergic receptors, may be of general use as a messenger in cellular interactions of T lymphocytes.\r"

In contrast to results obtained with kin mutants of S. cerevisiae, disruption of the Sc. pombe kin1+ gene resulted in recessive morphological and growth defects. kin1-disrupted cells grew slowly on enriched medium and grew as spheres, in contrast to wild-type Sc. pombe cells, which grow as rods. Relative to kin1+ cells, kin1-disrupted cells were differentially sensitive to lysis by treatment with alpha- and beta-glucanases, suggesting an alteration in either the composition or the organization of their cell walls.\r"

  ".U": "91045980\r", 
  ".W": "B-G antigens are cell-surface molecules encoded by a highly polymorphic multigene family located in the chicken major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Rabbit antisera to B-G molecules immunoprecipitate 3-6 bands from iodinated erythrocytes by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gels under reducing conditions. These are all B-G molecules because they all map to the B-G region of the chicken MHC in congenic and recombinant chickens, most are directly recognized by the antisera, most form disulfide-linked dimers, and none bear N-linked carbohydrate. Both apparent homodimers and heterodimers are found, which bear intrachain disulfide bonds. All 3-6 bands have different mobilities in SDS gels between different haplotypes, ranging from 30 to 55 kDa. This size polymorphism is not affected by glycosidase treatment or addition of protease inhibitors. Partial proteolysis of cell surface-iodinated B-G molecules generates extremely similar patterns of spots, both within and between haplotypes. These surface-iodinated peptides bear either interchain or intrachain disulfide bonds. Additional peptides are generated by proteolysis of B-G molecules iodinated after isolation. Thus, it appears that the extracellular regions of these molecules are very similar and that the length polymorphism is due to variations in the cytoplasmic regions. Inspection of the cDNA-derived protein sequence in this region shows many heptad repeats, which may allow variation in length by step deletion and alternative splicing. The repeats indicate an alpha-helical coiled-coil structure, which could form an interaction between subunits of the dimer or with the cytoskeleton or both.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin 1 (IL-1) has been obtained from the Epstein-Barr virus-infected B-lymphoblastoid cell line 3B6 and shown to be involved in autocrine growth of 3B6 B cells. Independently, adult T-cell leukemia-derived factor (ADF) was purified from human T-lymphotropic virus I-infected leukemic T-cell line (ATL-2) and reported as an interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor-inducing factor. We have previously reported the same molecular mass, pI, and NH2-terminal amino acid sequence for both 3B6-derived IL-1 and ADF. cDNA cloning of ADF demonstrated high homology with the prokaryotic disulfide reducing enzyme thioredoxin. We show here that ADF and 3B6-derived IL-1 are identical. By RNA blot, 3B6 and ATL-2 cells were shown to contain high levels of 0.6-kilobase mRNA corresponding to ADF. Such message was not detected in resting peripheral blood lymphocytes but could be weakly induced by lymphocyte activation. Antibodies have been raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to the NH2 terminus and the COOH terminus of ADF. Immunoblotting and sequential immunoprecipitation with these antibodies revealed the same 13-kDa protein in 3B6 and ATL-2 cells. Recombinant ADF could sustain growth of 3B6 and ATL-2 cells at low cellular concentration without fetal calf serum; ADF, thus, appears involved in their autocrine growth. Similarly, recombinant ADF could enhance growth of other B-cell lines, including the Epstein-Barr virus-negative Burkitt lymphoma line BL41 and the lymphoblastoid cell lines CRAG8, CRB95, and 1G8. Finally, recombinant ADF exhibits marked synergism with other cytokines, such as IL-1 and IL-2, allowing virally infected lymphocytes to respond to suboptimal amounts of a variety of growth factors.\r"

  ".W": "Anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 is a recombinant single-chain immunotoxin containing the heavy and light variable regions of the anti-Tac monoclonal antibody fused to a mutant form of Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE). Anti-Tac binds to the p55 subunit of the human interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor, and anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 kills human or monkey cell lines that contain either the intact IL-2 receptor or its p55 subunit alone. To assess the usefulness of anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 in treatment of IL-2 receptor-positive leukemia, we tested peripheral blood mononuclear cells from six patients with adult T-cell leukemia. In each of the six patients, anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 was extremely cytotoxic to the malignant cells. Metabolic activity and sensitivity of the fresh cells improved when a small amount of IL-2 (10 units per ml) was present during incubation. The toxin concentration necessary to inhibit protein synthesis by 50% after 16-hr incubation of cells with immunotoxin varied from 1.6 to 16 ng/ml (2.5-25 x 10(-11) M). In every case, binding was by means of the Tac antigen because anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 cytotoxicity was prevented by adding excess anti-Tac antibody. Moreover, anti-Tac alone or an inactive mutant of anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 without ADP-ribosylation activity had very little cytotoxic activity. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from normal controls, from a patient with Tac-negative leukemia, and from adult T-cell leukemia patients without significant peripheral blood involvement were not sensitive to anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40. These results indicate that anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 is a potent cytotoxin against adult T-cell leukemia cells in vitro and warrants clinical testing.\r"

From correlating the morphologically defined invasiveness of tumor cells with the presence of specific membrane-associated proteases, we have identified a malignant human melanoma cell line, LOX, that invades crosslinked gelatin films in vitro and contains uniquely a neutral 170-kDa gelatinase in the cell membrane. A similar gelatinase was found in membranes recovered from culture media conditioned with LOX. The 170-kDa gelatinase is a wheat germ agglutinin-binding protein. The proteolytic activity is maximal at neutral pH, enhanced by EDTA and dithiothreitol, inhibited by the cysteine protease inhibitors N-ethylmaleimide, HgCl2, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and can bind to an organomercurial adsorbent, suggesting that it is a neutral sulfhydryl-sensitive protease. This 170-kDa gelatinase of LOX cells was not found in a control melanoma cell line, SK-MEL28, or in 32 other tumor cell lines that did not show extracellular gelatin degradation. Thus, we have identified a large membrane-bound protease that may be a specific marker molecule for melanoma cell invasiveness.\r"

  ".U": "91045985\r", 
  ".W": "Recognition of an AUG initiator codon in a suboptimal context improves when a modest amount of secondary structure is introduced near the beginning of the protein-coding sequence. This facilitating effect depends on the position of the downstream stem-loop (hairpin) structure. The strongest facilitation is seen when the hairpin is separated from the preceding AUG codon by 14 nucleotides. Because 14 nucleotides corresponds to the approximate distance between the leading edge of the ribosome and its AUG-recognition center as measured by ribonuclease protection experiments, a likely explanation for the enhancing effect of a downstream hairpin is that secondary structure slows scanning, thereby providing more time for recognition of the AUG codon, and the facilitation is greatest when the 40S ribosome stalls with its AUG-recognition center directly over the AUG. The variable ability of mammalian ribosomes to initiate at non-AUG codons in vitro is also explicable by the presence or absence of a stem-loop structure just downstream from the alternative initiator codon. This may be relevant to recent reports of adventitious upstream initiation events at non-AUG codons in some vertebrate mRNAs that have structure-prone, G + C-rich leader sequences.\r"

These measurements were made at high temporal resolution with a low-noise voltage clamp. The inactivation-resistant gating current, I(g,inact), could be separated into a very fast (tau = 5-25 mus) and a slower (tau = 40-200 mus) component over a wide range of test potentials (-140 mV to 80 mV) and for three different starting potentials (-70 mV, 0 mV, and 50 mV). The time constants for these components plotted against test potential lay on two bell-shaped curves; the time constants at any particular test potential did not depend on the starting potential. Both components had charge-voltage curves that saturated between -150 mV and 50 mV. A fast spike, similar to the fast component of I(g, inact), was also apparent in recordings of the fully recovered total \"on\" gating current. I(g, inact)(fast) and I(g, inact)(slow) could not together be described by the simplest possible model, a linear three-state scheme; however, I(g, inact)(fast) could be modeled by a two-state scheme operating in parallel with other gating processes. I(g, inact)(slow) and the gating current due to recovery from inactivated states into resting states could together be well described by a three-state scheme. This lends support to models in which a pair of inactivated states are connected by a single voltage-dependent step to the resting states of the Na system.\r"

Increased titers of TGF beta were found in supernatants of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HIV-infected donors as compared to uninfected controls (P less than 0.001). This correlated closely with defective responses of CD4+ lymphocytes to the recall antigens tuberculin purified protein derivative or tetanus toxoid. The addition of TGF beta-neutralizing antibody to PBMCs partially restored these defective T-cell responses. Furthermore, purified TGF beta or HIV+ PBMC culture supernatants preferentially inhibited proliferation of CD4+ lymphocytes as compared to CD8+ cells. The increased expression of the TGF beta protein was associated with increased TGF beta mRNA as determined by a polymerase chain reaction assay. This increase in TGF beta protein and mRNA was due to a selective upregulation of the TGF beta 1 isoform. These results indicate that overexpression of TGF beta 1 occurs in HIV-infected individuals and that this cytokine can contribute to impaired immune functions and to depletion of CD4+ T lymphocytes.\r"

Parents and some family members heterozygous for this enzyme deficiency showed a similar pattern when given a substantially larger dose of fructose. Three of the nine heterozygotes thus identified also had clinical gout, suggesting the possibility of this defect being a fairly common cause of gout. In the present study this same noninvasive technology was used to identify the same spectral pattern in 2 of the 11 families studied with hereditary gout. In one family, the index patient's three brothers and his mother all showed the fructose-induced abnormality of metabolism, in agreement with the maternal inheritance of the gout in this family group. The test dose of fructose used produced a significantly larger increment in the concentration of serum urate in the patients showing the changes in 31P magnetic resonance spectra than in the other patients with familial gout or in nonaffected members, thus suggesting a simpler method for initial screening for the defect.\r"

The cDNA sequence of this second TNF inhibitor clone suggests that it is also a soluble fragment of a TNF receptor. Expression of this cDNA sequence in COS-7 cells verified that it encodes a receptor for TNF-alpha (TNFrII) that can give rise to a soluble inhibitor of TNF-alpha, presumably through proteolytic cleavage. The extracellular domain of TNFrII has significant homology with that of TNFrI and these two receptors share a striking conservation of cysteine residue alignment with the extracellular domain of the nerve growth factor receptor.

When cyclosporin A, which perturbs T-cell functions, was injected intraperitoneally into [NOD----C3H/HeN] chimeric mice daily for 1 month, the chimeric mice developed insulitis and overt diabetes within 20 weeks following bone marrow transplantation. Transplantation of bone marrow cells from (NZW x BXSB)F1 mice, which develop lupus nephritis, myocardial infarction, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, into C3H/HeN or C57BL/6J mice induced in the recipient strains both lupus nephritis and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura more than 3 months after transplantation. Transplantation of a stem-cell-enriched population from (NZW x BXSB)F1 mice into normal mice also induced autoimmune disease in the recipients. These results indicate that both systemic autoimmune disease and organ-specific autoimmune disease originate from defects that reside within the stem cells; the thymus and environmental factors such as sex hormones appear to act only as accelerating factors.\r"

We show that the observed structure of the topographic map can arise from a principle of continuous mapping. For the realization of this principle we use a mathematical model that can be interpreted as an adaptive process changing a set of synaptic weights, or synaptic connection strengths, between two layers of cells. The patterns of orientation preference and selectivity generated by the model are similar to the patterns seen in the visual cortex of macaque monkey and cat and correspond to a neural projection that maps a more than two-dimensional feature space onto a two-dimensional cortical surface under the constraint that shape and position of the receptive fields of the neurons very smoothly over the cortical surface.\r"

  ".U": "91045995\r", 
  ".W": "Using various end-labeled, defined-sequence DNA substrates, we examined bleomycin-induced damage at several G.C base pairs which correspond to mutational hot spots. The most frequent lesions detected were single-strand breaks and single apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites at the C residue, suggesting that this was the primary site of damage. Strand breaks and AP sites also occurred, but less frequently, at a secondary damage site--i.e., the directly opposed G residue in the complementary strand. However, damage at the secondary site occurred only when a strand break was present at the primary site, and AP sites at the primary site were never accompanied by closely opposed damage in the complementary strand. Thus, formation of a strand break at the primary damage site was a necessary though not sufficient condition for attack at the secondary site. Similar patterns were seen at other sequences attacked by bleomycin, although primary and secondary sites were sometimes staggered by one nucleotide position rather than directly opposed. These and other results suggest a mechanism of double-strand cleavage in which bleomycin is reactivated during formation of the first strand break, and the reactivated drug subsequently attacks the complementary strand at a specific position which is not normally a site of bleomycin-induced cleavage. Regeneration of activated bleomycin could result from a reaction between Fe(III).bleomycin and a 4'-peroxyl derivative of deoxyribose, both produced during formation of the strand break.\r"

Like other FGF receptors, the Xenopus homolog is a membrane-spanning protein with a split intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. The Xenopus FGF receptor mRNA is present as a maternal message whose levels are constant through early development. There is no specific regional localization of the transcript by analysis of FGF receptor mRNA levels in microdissected embryonic tissue. In isolated animal-pole blastomeres, FGF receptor mRNA declines over 16 hr in culture and this loss can be prevented by incubation with FGF or activin. Despite the presence of the FGF receptor mRNA in the oocyte, oocytes in culture do not respond to added FGF. However, injection of exogenous Xenopus FGF receptor transcripts into oocytes does generate a functional response to FGF. Our data suggest that posttranscriptional response to FGF. Our data suggest that posttranscriptional mechanisms regulate the FGF receptor in the oocyte and early embryo and further suggest that mesoderm-inducing factors influence receptor mRNA levels during the time of early tissue formation.\r"

Yet DNA topology is a significant factor in a number of genetic functions and is apparently affected by both genetic and environmental influences. We have employed a technique that allows us to estimate the level of unconstrained superhelical tension inside the cell. We study the formation of cruciform structures by alternating adenine-thymine sequences in plasmid DNA by in situ chemical probing. This structural transition is driven by superhelical torsion in the DNA and thus reports directly on the level of such tension in the cellular DNA. We observe that the effect of osmotic shock is an elevation of superhelical tension; quantitative comparison with changes in plasmid linking number indicates that the alteration in DNA topology is all unconstrained. We also show that the synthesis of defective topoisomerase leads to increased superhelical tension in plasmid DNA. These experiments demonstrate that the effect of environmental and genetic influences is felt directly at the level of torsional stress in the cellular DNA.\r"

Treatment of SFME cells with serum or transforming growth factor beta led to the appearance of glial fibrillary acidic protein, a specific marker for astrocytes. The appearance of glial fibrillary acidic protein in cultures was reversed upon removal of transforming growth factor beta or serum. Cells with properties similar to SFME cells were also isolated from adult mouse brain. These results suggest a role for transforming growth factor beta in astrocyte differentiation in developing organisms and in response to injury and identify the cell type that has the unusual properties of SFME cells.\r"

We reported previously that the frequency of psoralen-photoinduced mutations at the HPRT locus is lower in FA cells than in normal cells. This hypomutability is shown here to be associated with an increased frequency of deletions in the HPRT gene when either a mixture of cross-links and monoadducts or monoadducts alone are induced. Molecular analysis of mutants in the HPRT gene was carried out. In normal cells the majority of spontaneous and induced mutants are point mutations whereas in FA deletion mutations predominate. In that case a majority of mutants were found to lack individual exons or small clusters of exons whereas in normal cells large (complete or major gene loss) and small deletions are almost equally represented. Thus we propose that the FA defect lies in a mutagenic pathway that, in normal cells, involves bypassing lesions and subsequent gap filling by a recombinational process during replication.\r"

As this molecule is important for future vaccine studies of leishmaniasis, the gene encoding the GP46/M-2 surface membrane glycoprotein of Leishmania amazonensis has been cloned and sequenced. The protein sequence derived from the DNA sequence data is consistent with the known biochemical and immunochemical properties of the protein and indicates a number of structural areas of interest. A repetitive sequence (24 amino acids repeated four times) occurs within the amino-terminal portion of the molecule and constitutes approximately 22% of the total mature protein. The protease-resistant immunodominant carboxyl-terminal domain of the protein comprises approximately half of the molecule and consists of proline-rich and cysteine-rich areas of sequence; the distribution of cysteine residues is suggestive of metal binding motifs. The sequence predicts a hydrophobic leader peptide, and a putative attachment site for a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor is indicated at the carboxyl terminus, consistent with the membrane location of the protein. Southern blot analyses also indicate the presence of a GP46/M-2 gene family.\r"

To assess their potential oncogenic role, normal bone marrow cells were infected with retroviruses bearing the genes for IL-3 or IL-3 plus Hox-2.4. Unlike the IL-3 virus, the IL-3/Hox-2.4 virus was highly leukemogenic. Infected cells expressing both genes exhibited retarded differentiation in vitro, generated myelomonocytic cell lines, and provoked a rapid, transplantable myeloid leukemia in vivo. The oncogenic action of Hox-2.4 appears to derive from its ability to impede the IL-3-driven terminal differentiation of myeloid cells. The results suggest that homeobox genes can regulate key differentiation processes such as self-renewal capacity and that their inappropriate expression can be oncogenic.\r"

  ".U": "91046005\r", 
  ".W": "Purified heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 protein, which is found in vivo associated with heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA), promotes the rapid renaturation of nucleic acid strands. Maximal renaturation activity requires the glycine-rich carboxyl-terminal one-third of the protein, although the amino-terminal two-thirds also has activity. The A1-mediated reaction is second-order with respect to complementary DNA concentration, and the renaturation rate constant at 37 degrees C with A1 is about 3000-fold greater than in the absence of the protein. At 60 degrees C, the A1-mediated renaturation rate is even faster, and is about 300-fold greater than protein-free reactions carried out at 68 degrees C in 1 M NaCl. Provided that sufficient A1 protein is present to coat all strands in solution, the presence of nonhomologous, single-stranded DNA does not significantly inhibit the reaction. Moreover, renaturation of short strands to their complement contained in very long strands is nearly as efficient as between two short strands. These results indicate that A1 may be useful for procedures that rely on nucleic acid renaturation. We propose that A1 promotes rapid renaturation primarily by reducing the entropic barrier of bimolecular strand association through relatively transient interactions between A1-coated strands. Such interactions, mediated by flexible repeating domains, may act generally to increase the association kinetics of highly specific molecular assemblies in processes such as RNA maturation, transcription, translation, and transport.\r"

Perception of MHC-determined odor types influences reproductive behavior in the contexts of mate choice and maintenance of early pregnancy, tending to favor the propagation of one MHC type over another. How MHC genotype determines MHC odor type is unknown. One possible explanation is that differential odorants are generated by populations of commensal microorganisms whose composition is somehow geared to MHC diversity. This hypothesis was tested in the Y-maze system in which mice are trained to distinguish the urinary odors of MHC-congenic mice. First, it was shown that mice could readily be trained to distinguish the urines of germfree MHC-congenic mice. Second, it was shown that mice trained to distinguish the urines of conventionally maintained MHC-congenic mice could as readily distinguish the urines of germfree MHC-congenic mice. These results imply that MHC-determined odor types do not depend on odorants generated by microorganisms.\r"

The supK584 mutation, which had been isolated as a recessive UGA suppressor in S. typhimurium, caused an opal (UGA) substitution at amino acid position 144 in the prfB gene. Complementation, reversion, and gene fusion analyses led to the conclusion that supK is a S. typhimurium RF2 mutation and this opal RF2 mutation generates a UGA suppressor activity, presumably because of inefficient translation termination due to the reduced cellular level of RF2. In fact, suppression of the supK opal mutation results from a form of autogenous control of RF2 synthesis.\r"

Hepatocytes were harvested from WHHL rabbits, plated in primary cultures, and exposed to recombinant retroviruses capable of efficiently transferring a functional human LDL receptor gene. Genetically modified cells were harvested and infused into the portal vein of WHHL recipients, who were analyzed for metabolic consequences of human LDL receptor expression. Each animal exhibited a statistically significant decrease in total serum cholesterol 2-6 days after transplantation, with an eventual return to pretreatment levels. Proviral DNA sequences and virus-directed transcripts were detected in liver tissue 24 hr after transplantation. In situ hybridization demonstrated provirus expression in a small population of hepatocytes distributed in periportal sections of the liver. This study illustrates the potential of somatic gene therapy in ameliorating hyperlipidemia associated with familial hypercholesterolemia.\r"

We show that MyoD causes growth arrest when expressed in cell lines derived from tumors or transformed by different oncogenes. MyoD-induced growth inhibition was demonstrated by reduction in the efficiency of colony formation and at the single-cell level. We further show that MyoD growth inhibition can occur in cells that are not induced to activate muscle differentiation markers. The inhibitory activity of MyoD was mapped to the same 68-amino acid segment necessary and sufficient for induction of muscle differentiation, the basic-helix-loop-helix motif. Mutants with alterations in the basic region of MyoD that fail to bind or do not activate a muscle-specific enhancer inhibited growth; mutants with deletions in the helix-loop-helix region failed to inhibit growth. Thus, inhibition of cell growth by MyoD seems to occur by means of a parallel pathway to the one that leads to myogenesis. We conclude that MyoD is a prototypic gene capable of functionally activating intracellular growth inhibitory pathways.\r"

  ".W": "Additional mutations in the cystic fibrosis (CF) gene were identified in the regions corresponding to the two putative nucleotide (ATP)-binding folds (NBFs) of the predicted polypeptide. The patient cohort included 46 Canadian CF families with well-characterized DNA marker haplotypes spanning the disease locus and several other families from Israel. Eleven mutations were found in the first NBF, 2 were found in the second NBF, but none was found in the R-domain. Seven of the mutations were of the missense type affecting some of the highly conserved amino acid residues in the first NBF; 3 were nonsense mutations; 2 would probably affect mRNA splicing; 2 corresponded to small deletions, including another 3-base-pair deletion different from the major mutation (delta F508), which could account for 70% of the CF chromosomes in the population. Nine of these mutations accounted for 12 of the 31 non-delta F508 CF chromosomes in the Canadian families. The highly heterogeneous nature of the remaining CF mutations provides important insights into the structure and function of the protein, but it also suggests that DNA-based genetic screening for CF carrier status will not be straightforward.\r"

  ".W": "The c-myb protooncogene codes for a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that appears to act as a transcriptional regulator and is highly conserved through evolution. The DNA-binding domain of Myb has been shown to contain three imperfectly conserved repeats of 52 amino acids that constitute the amino-terminal end. Within each repeat, there are three tryptophans that are separated by 18 or 19 amino acids and are flanked by basic amino acids. To determine the role of tryptophans and the flanking basic amino acids in the DNA-binding activity of Myb proteins, we have selectively mutagenized individual tryptophans as well as some of the amino acid residues that flank these tryptophans. Replacement of these tryptophans with glycine, proline, or arginine abolished the DNA-binding activity whereas replacement with other aromatic amino acids or leucine or alanine did not appreciably affect this activity. On the other hand the replacement of two amino acids, asparagine and lysine, that flank the last tryptophan with acidic amino acids completely abolished their DNA-binding activity. These results are consistent with a model we present in which the tryptophans form a hydrophobic scaffold that plays a crucial role in maintaining the helix-turn-helix structure of the DNA binding domain. Basic and polar amino acids adjacent to these tryptophans seem to participate directly in DNA binding.\r"

Loss of the p bandlet is not, however, a sufficient condition for transfating of the o bandlet. Rather, loss of the p bandlet allows the o bandlet to shift into ectopic positions, and it is the ultimate position of the o bandlet that mandates which fate--O or P--the blast cells will take on. Therefore, the choice of the pluripotent o blast cells to follow either the O or P developmental pathway depends on their perception of positional cues provided by cells outside the equivalence group rather than on a direct interaction with p blast cell equivalence group members.\r"

The simulations yield a value of--15 kcal/mol. Although there is no quantitative experimental value for comparison, this is in qualitative agreement with the experimental result that HbS self-assembles into multistranded fibers that are responsible for erythrocyte sickling, while HbA does not. The free-energy difference was decomposed into enthalpic and entropic terms, both of which are significant, and the contributions of individual protein residues and of the solvent were examined. Electrostatic effects play the dominant role in favoring dimerization of HbS compared with HbA; van der Waals interactions make a negligible contribution to the difference. Both differential solvation and protein-protein interactions are important. Interactions within the donor tetramer (i.e., that containing the Glu-beta 6 mutation site), as well as those with the acceptor tetramer, contribute to the preferential free energy of dimerization of HbS.\r"

These 20 spacer-length variants, which are detectable by Southern blot hybridization, serve as markers of rDNA alleles of two Mendelian loci, Rrn1 and Rrn2. All of the populations of wild barley studied were polymorphic for both loci. In wild barley allele 112 (Rrn1) and allele 107 (Rrn2) behaved as widely adapted wild-type alleles; in our sample of cultivated barley allele 112 also behaved as a wild-type allele but allele 104 was somewhat more frequent than allele 107 in Rrn2. A few other alleles were locally frequent in wild barley. However, most of the 20 alleles were infrequent or rare and such alleles were often associated as \"hitchhikers\" with one of the wild-type alleles in compound two-component alleles. Allelic and genotypic frequencies differed widely in different habitats in correlation with eight of nine factors of the physical environment. Discrete log-linear multivariate analyses revealed statistically significant associations among alleles of Rrn1 and Rrn2. It was concluded that natural selection acting differentially on various rDNA alleles plays a major role in the development and maintenance of observed patterns of molecular and genetic organization of rDNA variability.\r"

One of the clones was positively identified as a GAD clone on the basis of the following results: (i) the clone and its secondary and tertiary clones all reacted strongly with anti-GAD antibodies; (ii) the fusion protein obtained from lambda GAD-Y1089 showed good GAD enzyme activity as determined by both CO2 and gamma-aminobutyric acid methods. The GAD clone thus obtained contains GAD cDNA of approximately 2.6 kilobases that has one internal EcoRI site. After GAD cDNA was cut at the EcoRI site, two DNA fragments of about 1.6 and 1.0 kilobases were obtained at the 5' and 3' ends, respectively. The cDNA insert was found to be composed of 2632 base pairs, the translation initiation site was assigned to the methionine codon ATG, and the termination site was found to be TGA (positions 2216-2218). Furthermore, the coding region in 2169 base pairs was found to consist of 723 amino acids. The protein has a molecular weight of 83,207 and contains 83 strongly basic, 108 strongly acidic, 226 hydrophobic, and 221 polar amino acids with an isoelectric point of 5.355. The relationship of this GAD cDNA to other forms of GAD is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Expression of the cloned human nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) cDNA in cell lines can generate both high- and low-affinity binding sites. Since the inability to respond appropriately to differentiation factors such as NGF may contribute to determining the malignant phenotype of neuroblastomas, we sought to determine whether the same is true of medulloblastomas. To generate a human central nervous system neuronal cell line that would respond to NGF, we infected the medulloblastoma cell line D283 MED with a defective retrovirus carrying the cDNA coding for the human NGFR. The resultant cells (MED-NGFR) expressed abundant low- and high-affinity NGFRs, and NGF treatment induced a rapid transient increase of c-fos mRNA in the NGFR-expressing cells but not in the parent line or in cells infected with virus lacking the cDNA insert. However, the MED-NGFR cells did not internalize the NGFR at high efficiency, nor did they differentiate in response to NGF. Three important conclusions emerge from this study: (i) internalization of NGFRs is not necessary for some early rapid transcriptional effects of NGF; (ii) an unknown factor(s) that cooperates with the cloned NGFR in allowing high-affinity NGF binding is found in a primitive central nervous system cell line; and (iii) NGFRs introduced into and expressed by D283 MED (i.e., MED-NGFR) cells are partially functional but are unable to induce differentiation in these primitive neuron-like tumor cells, implying that high-efficiency receptor-mediated endocytosis of NGF and its receptor may be a necessary step in the cascade of events leading to NGF-mediated differentiation.\r"

These forms of local inhibition are mediated by morphologically and neurochemically well-defined, mostly GABA-containing, interneurons, which control large populations of principal cells through their extensive axonal arborizations. These neurons can serve as ideal targets for subcortical pathways, such as those originating in the septum or raphe, which exercise a global control over hippocampal activity. This intriguing possibility prompted us to study whether the profound effect of the serotonergic raphe-hippocampal pathway is mediated by inhibitory interneurons or whether a direct diffuse action on the principal cells is dominant. We demonstrate that axons of this pathway form multiple synaptic contacts with hippocampal GABAergic interneurons. Interestingly, the serotonergic afferents selectively innervate the somata and dendritic trees of GABAergic neurons that contain the 28-kDa calcium-binding protein calbindin D28K, but never those that contain another calcium-binding protein, parvalbumin. These results show that the mechanism by which the serotonergic pathway may exert a powerful influence on hippocampal function involves the modulation of local inhibitory circuits. Furthermore, the selectivity in the choice of target GABAergic interneurons suggests a strong functional specialization among inhibitory circuits, as well as among the subcortical input pathways originating in the septum and raphe.\r"

Sequence analysis, hydrogen-bonding environment, and shape complementarity suggested that the N-terminal residues of PCI, which are not homologous to those of alpha 1-antitrypsin, form an amphipathic alpha-helix, here designated A+ since it precedes the alpha 1-antitrypsin A helix. Electrostatic calculations revealed a single, highly positive surface region arising from both the A+ and H helices, suggesting that this two-helix motif is required for GAG binding by PCI. The dominant role of electrostatic interactions in PCI-heparin binding was confirmed by the strong ionic strength dependence of heparin stimulation. The involvement of the A+ helix in heparin binding was verified by demonstrating that an anti-PCI antibody that specifically binds the A+ peptide blocks heparin binding.\r"

  ".W": "Covalent attachment of myristic acid (C14:0) to the NH2-terminal glycine residue of a number of cellular, viral, and oncogene-encoded proteins is essential for full expression of their biological function. Substitution of oxygen for methylene groups in this fatty acid does not produce a significant change in chain length or stereochemistry but does result in a reduction in hydrophobicity. These heteroatom-containing analogs serve as alternative substrates for mammalian myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.97) and offer the opportunity to explore structure/function relationships of myristate in N-myristoyl proteins. We have synthesized three tritiated analogs of myristate with oxygen substituted for methylene groups at C6, C11, and C13. Metabolic labeling studies were performed with these compounds and (i) a murine myocyte cell line (BC3H1), (ii) a rat fibroblast cell that produces p60v-src (3Xsrc), or (iii) NIH 3T3 cells that have been engineered to express a fusion protein consisting of an 11-residue myristoylation signal from the Rasheed sarcoma virus (RaSV) gag protein linked to c-Ha-ras with a Cys----Ser-186 mutation. This latter mutation prevents isoprenylation and palmitoylation of ras. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of membrane and soluble fractions prepared from cell lysates revealed different patterns of incorporation of the analogs into cellular N-myristoyl proteins (i.e., protein-sequence-specific incorporation). In addition, proteins were identified that underwent redistribution from membrane to soluble fractions after incorporating one but not another analog (analog-specific redistribution). Comparable studies using the model RaSV-ras chimeric protein also demonstrated analog-specific differences in incorporation, varying from approximately 25% of the total RaSV-ras chimeric protein with 5-octyloxypentanoate to greater than 50% with 12-methoxydodecanoate. Modification by this latter compound was so extensive that the amount of membrane-associated N-myristoylated protein was decreased. Incorporation of each of the analogs caused a dramatic redistribution to the soluble fraction, comparable to that seen when myristoylation was completely blocked by mutating the protein's site of myristate attachment (glycine) to an alanine residue. The demonstration that these analogs differ in the extent to which they are incorporated and in their ability to cause redistribution of any single protein suggests that they may also have sufficient selectivity to be of potential therapeutic value.\r"

We cloned the human adrenodoxin reductase gene and characterized it by restriction endonuclease mapping and DNA sequencing. The entire gene is approximately 12 kilobases long and consists of 12 exons. The first exon encodes the first 26 of the 32 amino acids of the signal peptide, and the second exon encodes the remainder of signal peptide and the apparent FAD binding site. The remaining 10 exons are clustered in a region of only 4.3 kilobases, separated from the first two exons by a large intron of about 5.6 kilobases. Two forms of human adrenodoxin reductase mRNA, differing by the presence or absence of 18 bases in the middle of the sequence, arise from alternate splicing at the 5' end of exon 7. This alternately spliced region is directly adjacent to the NADPH binding site, which is entirely contained in exon 6. The immediate 5' flanking region lacks TATA and CAAT boxes; however, this region is rich in G + C and contains six copies of the sequence GGGCGGG, resembling promoter sequences of \"housekeeping\" genes. RNase protection experiments show that transcription is initiated from multiple sites in the 5' flanking region, located about 21-91 base pairs upstream from the AUG translational initiation codon.\r"

The alpha- and beta-globin polypeptides associate into soluble tetramers, incorporate heme, and accumulate to greater than 5% of the total cellular protein. Purified recombinant hemoglobin has the correct stoichiometry of alpha- and beta-globin chains and contains a full complement of heme. Each globin chain also contains an additional methionine as an extension to the amino terminus. The recombinant hemoglobin has a C4 reversed-phase HPLC profile essentially identical to that of human hemoglobin A0 and comigrates with hemoglobin A0 on SDS/PAGE. The visible spectrum and oxygen affinity are similar to that of native human hemoglobin A0. The recombinant protein shows a reduction in Bohr and phosphate effects, which may be attributed to the presence of methionine at the amino termini of the alpha and beta chains. We have also expressed the alpha- and beta-globin genes separately and found that the expression of the alpha-globin gene alone results in a marked decrease in the accumulation of alpha-globin in the cell. Separate expression of the beta-globin gene results in high levels of insoluble beta-globin. These observations suggest that the presence of alpha- and beta-globin in the same cell stabilizes alpha-globin and aids the correct folding of beta-globin. This system provides a simple method for expressing large quantities of recombinant hemoglobin and allows facile manipulation of the genes encoding hemoglobin to produce functionally altered forms of this protein.\r"

However, Southern blot analysis suffers from a number of technical disadvantages, including the time necessary to obtain results, the use of radioactivity, and the susceptibility of the method to various artifacts. We have investigated an alternative approach for assessing the clonality of antigen receptor gene rearrangements in lymphoid tissue biopsy specimens. This approach involves the amplification of rearranged gamma T-cell receptor genes by the polymerase chain reaction and analysis of the polymerase chain reaction products by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. By use of this approach, clonal rearrangements from neoplastic lymphocytes constituting as little as 0.1-1% of the total cells in the tissue are detected as discrete bands in the denaturing gel after the gel is stained with ethidium bromide and viewed under ultraviolet light. In contrast, polyclonal rearrangements from reactive lymphocytes appear as a diffuse smear along the length of the gel. Our findings suggest that polymerase chain reaction combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis may offer a rapid, nonradioactive, and sensitive alternative to Southern blot analysis for the diagnostic evaluation of lymphoid tissue biopsy specimens.\r"

  ".W": "We have developed a homologous in vitro transcription system that requires (i) 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (called TCDD or dioxin), (ii) the Ah receptor, and (iii) a dioxin-responsive enhancer for activity. Unfractionated nuclear extracts from mouse hepatoma cells contain an inhibitor and fail to direct transcription in vitro. However, following phosphocellulose chromatography and reconstitution, the fractionated nuclear extract directs accurate transcription in vitro, using as a template the promoter/enhancer region from the mouse cytochrome P1-450 gene (Cyp1a1) linked to a \"G-free cassette\" (which generates a transcript with no guanosine residues). Extracts from TCDD-treated cells exhibit higher activity than extracts from untreated cells when transcribing a template containing both the promoter and enhancer but not when transcribing a template containing the promoter alone. Extracts from Ah receptor-defective cells fail to direct in vitro transcription in a TCDD-inducible fashion. A regulatory element that contains two binding sites for the liganded Ah receptor plus a truncated Cyp1a1 promoter suffices to direct TCDD-inducible, Ah receptor-dependent transcription in vitro. The inducible, receptor-dependent, enhancer-dependent properties of this system make it appropriate for analyzing in vitro the mechanism of dioxin action and the function of the Ah receptor.\r"

  ".W": "The molecular structure of a rat hepatoma 70-kDa insulin/mitogen-stimulated S6 protein kinase, obtained by molecular cloning, is compared to that of a rat homolog of the 85-kDa Xenopus S6 protein kinase alpha; both kinases were cloned from H4 hepatoma cDNA libraries. The 70-kDa S6 kinase (calculated molecular mass of 59,186 Da) exhibits a single catalytic domain that is most closely related in amino acid sequence (56% identity) to the amino-terminal, kinase C-like domain of the rat p85 S6 kinase (calculated molecular mass of 82,695 Da); strong similarity extends through a further 67 residues carboxyl-terminal to the catalytic domain (40% identity), corresponding to a region also conserved among the kinase C family. Outside of this segment of approximately 330 amino acids, the structures of the p70 and p85 S6 kinases diverge substantially. The p70 S6 kinase is known to be activated through serine/threonine phosphorylation by unidentified insulin/mitogen-activated protein kinases. A model for the regulation of p70 S6 protein kinase activity is proposed wherein the low activity of the unphosphorylated enzyme results from the binding of a basic, inhibitory pseudosubstrate site (located carboxyl-terminal to the extended catalytic domain) to an acidic substrate binding region (located amino-terminal to the catalytic domain); substrate binding is thereby prevented. S6 kinase activation requires displacement of this inhibitory segment, which is proposed to occur consequent to its multiple phosphorylation. The putative autoinhibitory segment contains several serine and threonine residues, each followed directly by a proline residue. This motif may prevent autophosphorylation but permit transphosphorylation; two of these serine residues reside in a maturation promoting factor (MPF)/cdc-2 consensus motif. Thus, hormonal regulation of S6 kinase may involve the action of MPF/cdc-2 or protein kinases with related substrate specificity.\r"

In vivo a DNA secondary structure also existed in the replication origin. Its frequency of formation was correlated with efficiency of RepC utilization.

  ".U": "91046037\r", 
  ".W": "In a search for determinants of retinotopic specification we previously identified an antigen in the dorsal embryonic retina as a protein called the 68-kDa laminin receptor. A dorso-ventral asymmetry in a laminin receptor seemed consistent with the known responsiveness of embryonic optic axons to laminin, but there were three peculiar points. (i) The molecular mass of this presumed laminin receptor in immunoblots is not 68 kDa but 43 kDa, and the molecular mass of the protein deduced from the mRNA is only 33 kDa. (ii) The antigen does not have the localization expected of a receptor for the extracellular matrix: the antibodies label mainly a granular cytoplasmic antigen in dorsal retina; an additional sparse cell-surface antigen present on a few cells does not show a dorso-ventral asymmetry. (iii) Despite the pronounced dorso-ventral difference seen immunohistochemically, in immunoblots the 43-kDa protein (p40) is evenly distributed throughout the retina. Here we show that (i) native p40 and in vitro-translated gene product are indistinguishable and their anomalous migration in denaturing gels probably is due to low pI; (ii) p40 is bound in a Mg2(+)-dependent manner to large cytoplasmic complexes that appear to include ribosomes; and (iii) there is a labile conformational difference in p40 between dorsal and ventral retina: dorsally it is more accessible to proteolysis, suggesting a more open conformation. In conjunction with the recent hypothesis that p40 constitutes a translation initiation factor (D. Auth and G. Brawerman, personal communication), these observations point to a dorso-ventral asymmetry in some aspect of protein translation, which in turn may set up differences in recognition factors on retinal growth cones.\r"

Total K efflux was 150 nmol per mg of protein per hr in a Cl medium of 295 mosmol/kg (with the Na/K pump inhibited). Cl-dependent K efflux (determined with methanesulfonate replacing Cl) was 54 nmol/(mg.hr). Cl-dependent K efflux (K-Cl cotransport) increased to 77 nmol/(mg.hr) with osmotic swelling of approximately 30% in 230-mosmol/kg medium and decreased to 13 nmol/(mg.hr) after shrinkage of approximately 60% in 430-mosmol/kg medium. Osmotically induced changes in transport and vesicle volume were reversible. K-Cl cotransport was enhanced by ATP. Nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues failed to substitute for ATP, indicating that phosphorylation is involved. However, in the absence of added ATP there was significant K-Cl cotransport, suggesting that phosphorylation is not essential for function. The results provide clues about the nature of the signals detected by the sensor of cell volume changes and demonstrate that inside-out vesicles from sheep erythrocyte membranes provide an advantageous experimental system for investigation of the volume sensor.\r"

  ".W": "The secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) by the pituitary gland is a pulsatile phenomenon. In the rhesus monkey, each pulse of LH in the peripheral circulation is associated with a characteristic increase in multiunit electrical activity (MUA) recorded from the medial basal hypothalamus. These \"volleys\" of electrical activity initiate the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) into the pituitary portal circulation from the terminals of neurosecretory cells. Their duration varies from 1-3 min in normal, adult intact females to 10-25 min in long-term ovariectomized monkeys. A variety of pharmacological interventions also modify volley duration. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the physiological significance of alterations in volley duration. The dynamics of LH pulses in ovariectomized animals were observed in a number of experimental circumstances in which MUA volley duration was reduced from a maximum of 23 min to a minimum of 4 min without significantly altering their frequency. The magnitude of each LH pulse was assessed by calculating the area under the curve delineated by the time course of LH above baseline. In eight experiments, a linear regression of these values on volley duration failed to reveal a significant correlation between MUA volley duration and the magnitude of LH pulses. These results suggest that all of the GnRH secreted per pulse is released at the onset of each MUA volley, the remainder of the increase in electrical activity having no further action on GnRH secretion, although effects on other systems cannot be excluded.\r"

To explore the possibility of using src mutants as probes for such interactions, we have compared mouse NIH 3T3 cells with chicken embryo fibroblasts as host cells for 24 previously described substitution and deletion mutants with lesions in the SH2- and SH3-encoding regions of a transformation-competent allele of chicken c-src. Although several of these mutants are equally competent or equally defective for transformation of the two cell types, four mutants (three of which map within SH3) preferentially transform NIH 3T3 cells, and seven mutants (all of which map within SH2) preferentially transform chicken cells. Some of the SH2 mutants least able to transform mouse cells exhibit augmented transforming activity in chicken cells. In general, the in vitro protein-tyrosine kinase activities of the mutants correlated with transforming activities. Thus, in many cases, the catalytic activity of a mutant protein depended upon the host cell in which the protein was made. Such host-dependent mutants may be especially useful reagents for biochemical and genetic studies of the src gene family.\r"

Each of these six tumors contains aberrant transcripts derived from identical splicing of exon 1 to exon 8 as a consequence of a deletion-rearrangement of the amplified gene, the extent of which is variable among these tumors. In spite of this intertumoral variability, each intragenic rearrangement results in loss of the same 801 coding bases (exons 2-7) and creation of a new codon at the novel splice site in their corresponding transcripts. These rearrangements do not, however, affect the mRNA sequence for the signal peptide, the first five codons, or the reading frame downstream of the rearrangement.\r"

  ".U": "91046044\r", 
  ".W": "The mechanism by which L-glutamine (L-Gln) inhibits the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor from bovine aortic cultured endothelial cells was investigated. The intracellular concentration of L-arginine (L-Arg) in Arg-depleted endothelial cells was inversely related to the level of L-Gln. Removal of L-Gln from the culture medium (usually containing L-Gln at 2 mM) abolished the inhibitory effect of the culture medium on L-Arg generation. L-Gln (0.2 and 2 mM) but not D-Gln inhibited the generation of L-Arg by both Arg-depleted and nondepleted endothelial cells. L-Gln did not interfere with the uptake of L-Arg or the metabolism of L-Arg-L-Phe to L-Arg but inhibited the formation of L-Arg from L-citrulline (L-Cit), L-Cit-L-Phe, and NG-monomethyl-L-arginine. L-Gln also inhibited the conversion of L-[14C]Cit to L-[14C]Arg by Arg-depleted endothelial cells. However, L-Gln did not inhibit the conversion of L-argininosuccinic acid to L-Arg by endothelial cell homogenates. Thus, L-Gln interferes with the conversion of L-Cit to L-Arg probably by acting on argininosuccinate synthetase rather than argininosuccinate lyase. L-Gln also inhibited the generation of L-Arg by the monocyte-macrophage cell line J774 but had no effect on the conversion of L-Cit to L-Arg by these cells. As the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor from cultured and non-cultured endothelial cells is limited by the availability of L-Arg, endogenous L-Gln may play a regulatory role in the biosynthesis of endothelium-derived relaxing factor.\r"

  ".U": "91046045\r", 
  ".W": "We have investigated the mechanism by which cultured endothelial cells generate L-arginine (L-Arg), the substrate for the biosynthesis of endothelium-derived relaxing factor. When Arg-depleted endothelial cells were incubated in Krebs' solution for 60 min, L-Arg levels were significantly (9.7-fold) elevated. The generation of L-Arg coincided with a substantial decrease (90%) in intracellular L-glutamine (L-Gln), whereas all other amino acids were virtually unaffected. Changes in calcium, pH, or oxygen tension had no effect on L-Arg generation, which was, however, prevented when the cells were incubated in culture medium containing L-Gln. L-Arg generated by endothelial cells labeled with L-[14C]Arg was derived from an unlabeled intracellular source, for the specific activity of the intracellular L-Arg pool decreased substantially (8.8-fold) over 60 min. Arg-depleted endothelial cells did not form urea or metabolize L-ornithine but converted L-citrulline (L-Cit) to L-Arg possibly via formation of L-argininosuccinic acid. Nondepleted cells stimulated with the calcium ionophore A23187 showed only a transient accumulation of L-Cit, indicating that L-Cit is recycled to L-Arg during the biosynthesis of endothelium-derived relaxing factor. The generation of L-Arg by Arg-depleted endothelial cells was partially (45%) blocked by protease inhibitors, and various Arg-containing dipeptides were rapidly cleaved to yield L-Arg. Thus, cultured endothelial cells recycle L-Cit to L-Arg and possibly liberate peptidyl L-Arg. The Arg-Cit cycle appears to be the equivalent in the endothelial cell to the formation of urea by the liver. The biosynthesis of endothelium-derived relaxing factor may, therefore, not only produce a powerful vasodilator but also relieve the endothelial cell of excess nitrogen.\r"

We used one of these sera to purify the antigen from HeLa cells synchronized in mitosis as a noncovalent complex with a 25-kDa protein. The antigen was released from DNA by intercalation with 25 mM chloroquine. Ion-exchange chromatography yielded the pure complex with an apparent molecular size of 68 kDa, which was separated into its components by gel filtration in 6 M guanidinium chloride. Upon two-dimensional gel electrophoresis the 47-kDa protein gave two main spots of pI 6.6 and 6.7, respectively. Posttranslational modification is indicated by additional antigenic spots, by lack of a free alpha-amino group, and by chromatographic behavior of peptides on reversed-phase chromatography. The amino acid sequence for 205 residues of the 47-kDa protein has been established. This sequence is highly homologous with the translated reading frame of RCC1, a gene reportedly involved in regulating onset of mammalian chromosome condensation.\r"

  ".W": "Cytoplasmic proteins that regulate signal transduction or induce cellular transformation, including cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinases, p21ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP), phospholipase C gamma, and the v-crk oncoprotein, possess one or two copies of a conserved noncatalytic domain, Src homology region 2 (SH2). Here we provide direct evidence that SH2 domains can mediate the interactions of these diverse signaling proteins with a related set of phosphotyrosine ligands, including the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. In src-transformed cells GAP forms heteromeric complexes, notably with a highly tyrosine phosphorylated 62-kDa protein (p62). The stable association between GAP and p62 can be specifically reconstituted in vitro by using a bacterial polypeptide containing only the N-terminal GAP SH2 domain. The efficient phosphorylation of p62 by the v-Src or v-Fps tyrosine kinases depends, in turn, on their SH2 domains and correlates with their transforming activity. In lysates of EGF-stimulated cells, the N-terminal GAP SH2 domain binds to both the EGF receptor and p62. Fusion proteins containing GAP or v-Crk SH2 domains complex with similar phosphotyrosine proteins from src-transformed or EGF-stimulated cells but with different efficiencies. SH2 sequences, therefore, form autonomous domains that direct signaling proteins, such as GAP, to bind specific phosphotyrosine-containing polypeptides. By promoting the formation of these complexes, SH2 domains are ideally suited to regulate the activation of intracellular signaling pathways by growth factors.\r"

  ".W": "The actin cores of hair-cell stereocilia were tested as a substrate for the movement of myosin-coated beads in an in vitro assay. Large numbers of stereocilia from bullfrog sacculi and semicircular canals were isolated by blotting onto coverglasses and were demembranated to expose the polar actin tracks of their cytoskeletal cores. Silica or polystyrene beads, coated with thick filaments of chicken skeletal muscle myosin, were added to this core preparation in the presence of ATP. Myosin-coated beads could reach some of the cores by diffusion alone, but the efficiency and precision of the assay were improved considerably by the use of \"optical tweezers\" (a gradient-force optical trap) to deposit the beads directly on the cores. Beads applied in this fashion bound and moved unidirectionally at 1-2 microns/s, escaping the retarding force of the trap. Actin filaments within the stereocilia are cross-linked by fimbrin, but this did not appear to interfere with the motility of myosin. Beads coated with optic-lobe kinesin were also tested for movement; these bound and moved unidirectionally at 0.1-0.2 microns/s when applied to microtubule-based kinociliary cores, but not when applied to actin-based stereociliary cores. Our results are consistent with, and lend support to, a model for hair cell adaptation in which a molecular motor such as myosin maintains tension on the mechanically gated transduction channels. Optical tweezers and video-enhanced differential interference contrast optics provide high efficiency and improved optical resolution for the in vitro analysis of myosin motility.\r"

  ".U": "91046050\r", 
  ".W": "The study of tumor-specific chromosomal abnormalities has been severely impeded by an inability to link cytogenetic to molecular data. Restriction fragment length polymorphism mapping of any particular chromosomal rearrangement to the resolution limit of genetic methodology generates sets of probes that frequently are still too widely spaced to render the rearrangement breakpoints accessible to molecular isolation. The stable propagation of genomic fragments of up to one million base pairs in size as yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) represents an important development in this regard. However, existing YAC libraries have been made from karyotypically normal sources making the localization and cloning of specific rearrangement breakpoints much more difficult. As a solution to this problem, we present an improved method for creating YAC libraries that can utilize specialized tumor-derived materials and that can be executed effectively in a small laboratory setting. Procedures that enabled more consistent DNA insert size selection and enhanced yeast transformation frequency were employed to generate a human YAC library from a neuroepithelioma cell line containing a characteristic t(11;22) chromosomal translocation. Approximately 40,000 colonies with an average insert size of 330 kilobase pairs were created. This library was screened with two single-copy probes that bracket the translocation breakpoint. YAC clones ranging from 370 to 550 kilobase pairs that were specific for each single-copy probe were identified. Specialized YAC libraries will make many more tumor-specific chromosomal abnormalities accessible to molecular isolation.\r"

  ".W": "Diabetes (db) is an autosomal recessive mutation located in the midportion of mouse chromosome 4 that results in profound obesity with hyperphagia, increased metabolic efficiency, and insulin resistance. To clone this gene and generate a molecular map of the region around this mutation, two genetic crosses were established: an intraspecific backcross between C57BL/6J db/db females and C57BL/6J db/db x DBA/2J +/+ F1 (B6D2 db/+ F1) male mice and an interspecific intercross between B6D2 db/+ F1 males and C57BL/6J db/db x Mus spretus F1 (B6spretus db/+ F1) females. The progeny of both crosses were characterized for genotype at the db locus to map a series of restriction fragment length polymorphisms relative to the db locus. Measurements of body weight, body length, and plasma concentrations of glucose and insulin in the animals allowed the assignment of genotype (db/db vs. db/+ or +/+). A total of 132 progeny of the intraspecific cross and 48 db/db progeny of the interspecific cross were typed for individual restriction fragment length polymorphisms to generate a gene order of: centromere-brown (Mt4)-P lambda Mm3(2)-Ifa (Inta)-Cjun-db-D4Rp1-Glut1-Mtv-13-Lck. Several of the genes that are linked to db [Cjun, glucose transporter (Glut1) and Lck] map to human chromosome 1p, suggesting that db may be part of a syntenic group between human 1p and the distal portion of mouse chromosome 4. In addition, phenotyping of the progeny of these crosses revealed a wide range in plasma concentrations of glucose and insulin among the obese progeny, with some animals developing overt diabetes and other remaining euglycemic. Distributions of age-controlled plasma [glucose] and [insulin] among the intraspecific-cross obese progeny were not bimodal, suggesting a role for polygenic differences between the progenitor strains (C57BL/6J and DBA/2J) in the development of overt diabetes.\r"

Five patients with an illness characterized by the abrupt onset of aching skeletal muscles, edema, thickening and induration of the skin, and marked blood eosinophilia associated with L-tryptophan ingestion provided eosinophils, serum, or both, for evaluation. Gradient sedimentation density analysis of the peripheral blood eosinophils from four of these patients revealed that 43 +/- 13% (mean +/- SEM) of the cells had converted to the abnormal (hypodense) sedimenting phenotype. When normodense eosinophils from the reference donors were cultured for 3 days in medium supplemented with increasing concentrations of serum from the patients with EMS, their viability increased in a dose-dependent manner to 45%, which was significantly augmented over the effect of normal serum. This eosinophil viability-sustaining activity was inhibited by 76 +/- 7% (mean +/- SEM; n = 3) by the addition of anti-interleukin 5 (IL-5) but not by neutralizing antibodies monospecific for either granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or IL-3. IL-5, an eosinophilopoietic factor, converts normodense peripheral blood eosinophils in vitro to a hypodense sedimenting form with extended viability and augmented biologic responses to activating stimuli. Thus, the presence of IL-5 in the sera of patients with EMS may contribute to the development and maintenance of the eosinophilia and may regulate the conversion of the peripheral blood eosinophils to the hypodense phenotype with augmented pathobiologic potential.\r"

A 7-base-pair microhelix that recreates the acceptor helix can be charged with alanine. No other examples of charging of small helices with specific amino acids have been reported, to our knowledge. We show here that a 13-base-pair and an 8-base-pair hairpin helix that reconstruct a domain and subdomain, respectively, of histidine tRNAs can be charged with histidine. We also show that transplantation of a base pair that is unique to histidine tRNAs is sufficient to consider histidine acceptance on a domain and subdomain of alanine tRNA. Both alanine and histidine aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases retain specificity for their cognate synthetic substrates. Alanine- and histidine-specific microhelices may resemble a system that arose early in the evolution of charging and coding.\r"

  ".W": "The human homologue of the neu oncogene is frequently found in human tumors. Certain amino acid substitutions at position 664 in the transmembrane domain of the neu oncogene-encoded p185 protein product are known to cause malignant transformation of cells. Using conformational energy analysis based on ECEPP (empirical conformational energies for polypeptides program), we have previously determined the preferred three-dimensional structures for the transmembrane domain of the p185 protein with a transforming (glutamic acid) and a nontransforming (valine) substitution at the critical position 664 and found that the global minimum-energy conformation of this region in the nontransforming protein contains a sharp bend, whereas the global minimum-energy conformation for this region from the transforming protein is entirely alpha-helical. We now demonstrate that this result holds for other known nontransforming (glycine, histidine, tyrosine, and lysine) and transforming (glutamine) substitutions at position 664. Furthermore, a simple statistical thermodynamic analysis of the results indicates that approximately 85% of each of the nontransforming sequences exist with the bend at positions 664 and 665, while approximately 90% of each of the transforming sequences exist as an alpha-helix. About 9% of the nontransforming sequences exist as the alpha-helix. These results suggest that if the intracellular concentration of the normal protein is increased at least 10-fold, thereby increasing the alpha-helical form by this factor, cell transformation should result. This conclusion is directly supported by genetic experiments in which this level of overexpression of the normal protein was achieved with attendant cell transformation.\r"

We have found a short stretch of conserved amino acid sequence among the terminal proteins from six different sources. The location of this sequence motif is also similar among the different terminal-proteins. To determine the functional role of this terminal-protein domain in DNA replication, we have studied the bacteriophage PRD1 system. The PRD1 terminal protein and DNA polymerase genes were cloned into expression vectors, and the recombinant plasmids were used for constructing PRD1 terminal protein mutants. Site-directed mutagenesis and functional analysis showed that one of the two arginines (Arg-174) in the conserved sequence is critical for the initiation complex-forming activity of the PRD1 terminal protein. Replacement of Arg-174 by noncharged amino acids resulted in nonfunctional terminal protein. Phenylglyoxal, an alpha-dicarbonyl compound that reacts with the guanidino group of arginine, inhibits initiation complex formation between PRD1 terminal protein and dGMP. On the basis of these results, we propose that Arg-174 represents, at least in part, the binding site for phosphate groups of dGTP.\r"

The target transgenome is a mouse adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) gene rendered nonfunctional by introduction of a substitution at either of two bases that comprise a splice acceptor site. Reversion at a mutated site results in the expression of wild-type mouse APRT and consequent growth of APRT+ transgenic cell colonies. Site-specific reversion to wild-type sequence is confirmed by regeneration of a previously destroyed diagnostic Pst I site. Two independent cell clones, each with mutant transgenomes bearing an A----G transition, exhibited an up to 7500-fold, dose-dependent induction of reversion following treatment with ethyl methanesulfonate. Treatment of these clones with 2-aminopurine resulted in no induction of revertants. In contrast, another transgenic cell clone, bearing a G----A transition, reverted as a consequence of 2-aminopurine, but not ethyl methanesulfonate, treatment. These data confirm for human cells the proposed mechanisms of action of these mutagens and provide evidence for the utility of our site-specific reversion method for mutagenesis studies.\r"

The BMD of lumbar vertebrae L2-4, the femoral neck, the Ward's triangle, and the greater trochanter was measured with dual-photon absorptiometry. Isometric and isokinetic torque and work measurements obtained on a trunk testing unit were used to assess trunk flexor and extensor strength. Correlation analysis demonstrated a statistically significant relationship between most trunk torque and work measurements and BMD. The trunk extensors generally provided higher correlations with BMD than did the trunk flexors, and the isokinetic extension torque values demonstrated higher correlations than the isometric extension values in every case. Linear backward-regression models, based on the subjects' weight and trunk flexor and extensor torque and work measurements, demonstrated multiple-correlation coefficients of .67, .58, .43, and .65 in predicting the BMD of the L2-4 region, femoral neck, Ward's triangle, and greater trochanter region, respectively. Estrogen therapy status did not affect the linear regression models. These data suggest a positive relationship in postmenopausal women between flexor and extensor torque values and BMD at the lower lumbar spine and proximal femur.\r"

The purposes of this article are to clearly distinguish empathy from related terms and to suggest that the act of empathizing cannot be taught. According to Edith Stein, a German phenomenologist, empathy can be facilitated. It also can be interrupted and blocked, but it cannot be forced to occur. What makes empathy unique, according to Stein, is that it happens to us; it is indirectly given to us, \"nonprimordially.\" When empathy occurs, we find ourselves experiencing it, rather than directly causing it to happen. This is the characteristic that makes the act of empathy unteachable. Instead, promoting attitudes and behaviors such as self-awareness, nonjudgmental positive regard for others, good listening skills, and self-confidence are suggested as important in the development of clinicians who will demonstrate an empathic willingness.\r"

Computer-averaged EMG profiles for the gluteus medius muscle were recorded at a free-walking cadence and at stepping frequencies of 78 and 120 steps/min, using detectors with 3- and 25-Hz cutoff frequencies simultaneously. The 3-Hz filtered EMG profiles proved to be smoother, to exhibit a significantly lower cycle-to-cycle variability, and to have a greater time lag with respect to the original unprocessed EMG signal than the 25-Hz filtered EMG profiles. The observed intersubject variability also was lower for the 3-Hz filtered EMG profiles than for the 25-Hz filtered EMG profiles. The results indicate that comparison of EMG profiles recorded with different detectors is difficult. A standard detector may solve this difficulty.\r"

  ".W": "During much of this century, our views of motor development were greatly influenced by speculations as to the role of reflexes in the control of movement. However, recent work casts a new view regarding the organization and control of movement. In this article, a review of recent studies of motor development in neonatal kittens and chick embryos is provided. The results of these studies suggest that very early in development there is considerable potential for coordinated movement. The potential for coordinated movement may also exist in early human development. Whether coordinated movement is observed appears to be dependent on a number of variables. For example, mechanical factors emerging during movement may impose demands that restrict the expression of coordinated movement. One possible implication for the practice of physical therapy is that researchers and clinicians will need to precisely characterize and quantify movement variables to advance our knowledge of the processes driving development and to establish effective means for addressing the movement problems of a pediatric population.\r"

Research shows a clear cephalocaudal gradient in the development of postural responses. Postural muscle synergies develop appropriate temporal organization through experience in each new level of postural skill development. Sensory inputs contributing to posture control influence postural responses very early in development, with responses being elicited by vision alone, or by somatosensory and vestibular cues in isolation. Studies of older adults indicate small, but significant, increases in onset latencies and disruptions in the temporal organization of postural muscle responses when subjects are given external threats to balance. In addition, older adults, like young children, use antagonist muscles more often in coactivation with agonist muscles. Older adults also have more difficulty balancing when sensory inputs are reduced experimentally or pathologically. Ankle dorsiflexor muscle weakness is also a factor in balance dysfunction in the older adult.\r"

The problem with this approach is that the results of such assumptions often lead to conclusions about the production and control of movement that do not relate to the control demands placed on the central nervous system. In order to truly understand how the central nervous system plans and produces movements to match environmental demands, we must take into account the many variations available within the body. The purpose of this article is to examine two movement systems that have the potential to act in multiple spatial dimensions with variable muscle action patterns when performing a stabilizing task. Methods of analyzing how the systems operate under differing task constraints and results of the experiments will be presented. Hypothetical models that have been proposed to explain how complex movement systems operate will also be discussed.\r"

The purpose of this article is twofold. First, it provides a review of properties of postural adjustments that accompany a variety of limb and trunk movements. Second, a schema for the coordination of posture and movement is proposed. This schema suggests that a central nervous system model of body dynamics is essential to anticipatory control of posture during movement.\r"

The formation of workable hypotheses, however, has been limited by the great variety of putative roles reported in the literature. Reported functions have often been in direct conflict. Recent developments, however, provide new perspectives from which to view seemingly discordant functions. Data reviewed in this article suggest a distinct anatomical topography within the BG, allowing for highly specialized subfunctions. In parallel, BG cellular activity has been found primarily in association with specific sensory and task-related dimensions relevant to particular movements. The multiple sensorimotor contributions of the BG therefore are not contradictory, but represent BG contributions within different functional contexts. These multiple roles of the BG offer particular clinical insights.\r"

  ".U": "91046425\r", 
  ".W": "Progressive tissue expansion induces significant gross, histologic, and bony changes in skulls and long bones of neonatal miniature swine. These bony changes consist of erosion underlying tissue expanders, with bony lipping and bone deposition at the periphery of the expander. Cranial suture lines underneath expanders appear effaced and convoluted. Serial CT scans reveal decreased bone thickness and volume (p less than 0.02) but identical bone density (p = 0.60) beneath expanders. Increased bone volume and thickness occur at the periphery of expanders (p less than 0.02). Bone density (CT number) is unaffected by tissue expansion in both cranial and long bones. These findings have histomorphometric correlates: Osteoclastic bone resorption occurs underneath expanders with periosteal reaction at the periphery of expanders. Cranial sutures are similarly affected, but no cranial synostosis results. No changes to the inner table of the skull or stigmata of increased intracranial pressure were observed either in CT scans or in behavioral changes in long-term animals. The pathophysiology of bony changes is a remodeling effect, not one of simple pressure deformation. Increased bone resorption and complete inhibition of bone formation occur until the pressure is removed. Cranial bone is significantly more affected than long bone. After removal of the expanders, reparative bone remodeling begins within 5 days and nearly complete healing of the cranial defects occurs within 2 months (p less than 0.02). No plagiocephaly results despite early coronal suture changes. On the basis of this study, we conclude that tissue expansion causes significant but reversible effects, readily monitored by high-resolution CT scans, on neonatal and infant cranial and long bones.\r"

Patients were followed for 1 to 11 years (average 5.3 years). No recurrence or invasion of the fibrous dysplasia into the grafted bone was seen. One patient had orthognathic maxillary osteotomy on the reconstructed maxilla 6 years after initial reconstruction. Five of 19 patients with alveolar dysplasia had a recurrence and were reshaped. One patient had mandibular sagittal osteotomies to set back the prognathic, fibrous dysplasic mandible after three attempts at conservative shaving. Another patient with mandibular fibrous dysplasia had recurrence with pain and a hemimandibulectomy with successful immediate free vascularized iliac bone graft reconstruction.\r"

This approach limits the surgeon by reducing the stable bone mass available for fixation, creating dependence on concave surfaces. Most important, it changes the bony topography that determines the preoperative plan. This paper presents a new craniofacial concept and technique used in 26 patients with various dysmorphic syndromes who were reconstructed by performing a lamellar split osteotomy. This technique maintains the internal lamella in its native position, thereby allowing it to act as a reference for the bony topography and providing a stable facial framework for rigid fixation. This interlamellar osteotomy has led to improved aesthetic results in the orthomorphic reconstructions of congenital and other deformities. It can be used in any aesthetic patient in whom contour changes or augmentation of form is desired. It is recommended as a preferred method for achieving quantitative contour improvement in patients over 3 years of age.\r"

  ".W": "The improved combination of surgical and dental teamwork in the primary treatment of clefts presented here is consistent with principles. In fact, this is a staged design for correction of classic clefts of the lip and palate that, based on biological principles, facilitates the continuance of the failed embryonic \"migrations\" toward a normal end point. Positioning of the alveolar segments, dissection of mucoperiosteum out of the cleft, and union of mucoperiosteum across the alveolar and anterior hard palate cleft make it possible to create a periosteal tunnel across the bony gap and set up a condition conducive to bone formation and eventual tooth eruption in the cleft area. Lip closure by adhesion reduces the tension of the primary lip closure and allows gentle molding until solidification of the arch occurs. Thus a complete cleft has been rendered an incomplete cleft. With a balanced, stabilized maxillary platform, the definitive lip and nose corrections can be carried to completion early (by 2 to 4 years of age). These planned actions bypass a persistent cleft, fistulas, raw areas, malposition of alveolar segments, and probably the necessity for later bone grafting. The only question not totally answered is the effect of this approach on final growth. Although most reports seem to indicate that growth has and will proceed within normal limits, another 10 years of careful follow-up is indicated and, in fact, is in progress.\r"

It reviews the technical steps of the procedure, which emphasizes wide undermining and release of the orbicularis oris muscle on the lateral side of the cleft to allow redraping and lengthening of the lip skin, step-by-step layered closure of the mucosa, muscle, and skin, and further vertical lengthening of the lip with a Z-plasty skin closure. Three elements that are difficult to achieve or restore with cleft lip revision are evaluated: (1) achievement of a good skin scar, (2) maintenance of the alar-facial groove, and (3) achievement of adequate lip height without sacrificing horizontal lip length. Ten of the 12 patients had a satisfactory scar, 9 patients had a good alar-facial groove, and all patients had a normal-appearing horizontal lip length. Nine patients required secondary surgery; however, in six patients, this included correction of the nasal deformity that was not corrected at the time of cleft lip repair.\r"

With the adolescent growth spurt, three unfavorable features have become apparent: (1) the columella may grow too long and the nostrils too large, (2) often the nasal tip remains broad, and (3) there is a drift of the columellar base and the lip-columellar angle is transgressed by scar. This procedure has therefore been discontinued. A new treatment plan is presented in which the columella is reconstructed from tissues in the splayed-out nasal tip.\r"

Membranous cranial bone grafts are less likely to resorb, especially when used with rigid internal fixation techniques. However, when split, they are often too thin and can be difficult to contour. Full-thickness cranial bone grafts were used to achieve nasal augmentation in 26 patients with end-stage nasal skeleton deficiency. All procedures were carried out using only a coronal incision. Grafts were harvested through a craniotomy, carved meticulously, and secured rigidly with miniplates or bicortical screws. Donor sites were reconstructed with split cranial grafts, leaving an intact cranial vault. No graft was lost to infection, and there was no significant donor-site morbidity. In carefully selected patients this method of full-thickness cranial bone graft reconstruction yields good results.\r"

Although our knowledge of the biomechanical changes occurring in expanded skin has increased greatly, little information is available regarding average aesthetic results achieved with this technique. In order to eliminate the bias of best case selection reports, this study of 60 consecutive patients undergoing skin-expansion breast reconstruction was undertaken. Results of the study demonstrated a significant frequency and diversity of complications. In particular, immediate breast reconstruction with skin expanders was identified as a high-risk procedure because of its association with skin necrosis and delayed wound healing. Although two procedures--insertion and replacement--had been anticipated, patients from both the Boston and New York groups required approximately three operations to complete the expansion process. Average aesthetic results, often characterized by problems of symmetry, ptosis, and contour, need to be recognized and improved.\r"

Patients with painful neuroma or segmental nerve injury of 3 cm were chosen as the test group. Those amenable to direct repair were classified as controls. Between 1982 to 1988, a total of 22 patients were enrolled in this study. A total of 34 nerves were repaired, 15 with a venous nerve conduit, 4 with a sural nerve graft, and 15 with direct repair. Significant symptom relief and satisfactory sensory function return were uniformly observed. The two-point discrimination measurements indicated superiority of direct repair and probably of conventional nerve grafting. However, the universally favorable patient acceptance and the return of measurable two-point discrimination indicates the effectiveness of autogenous vein grafts as nerve conduits when selectively applied to bridge a small nerve gap (less than or equal to 3 cm) on nonessential peripheral sensory nerves.\r"

  ".W": "Hydrofluoric acid is used extensively as an industrial cleaning agent for metals and glass. Many workers are injured by cutaneous contact of the acid with exposed skin surfaces, particularly hands. Hydrofluoric acid burns are characterized by delayed onset of symptomatology with skin ulceration, and severe pain may be of extended duration. Treatment of hydrofluoric acid burns traditionally has consisted of local infiltration or intraarterial injections of calcium solutions. These injections are painful and frequently require retreatment. A new treatment utilizing a topical gel of calcium carbonate is described. Nine patients have been treated for hydrofluoric acid burns of the hand with calcium carbonate gel applied topically and covered with occlusive glove dressings. A gel slurry is compounded from calcium carbonate tablets and K-Y Jelly. Fingernails of the affected fingers are removed if a subungual burn is obvious. The gel is put into a surgeon's glove and placed over the burned hand. The patient replaces the glove and slurry every 4 hours for 24 hours. After the first day, the glove is discontinued unless there is resumption of painful symptoms. Full range of motion is encouraged during this interval. The calcium carbonate gel technique was successfully utilized in nine patients with no further need for injection therapy. In these patients, pain relief was obtained within 4 hours of treatment, with no further progression of skin ulceration. No reconstructive procedures were required in any patient, and only one patient did not return to full-duty work within 1 week. There were no long-term sequelae from burns treated with this topical therapy, except one patient, who presenting 24 hours after the burn, developed a digital tip neuroma that was excised.\r"

Two diluting agents (dextran 60 and hydroxyethyl starch 200) are utilized. Our quantitative findings demonstrate that the amount of nonperfused tissue following flap creation in both the dextran (n = 23) and starch (n = 13) groups was significantly decreased as compared with controls (n = 19). Our qualitative observations suggest that improved hemorrheologic properties at the microcirculatory level are responsible for the observed decreased necrosis. Various mechanisms by which hemodilution may act to prevent necrosis are discussed.\r"

The internal layer is moved upward until the eyelashes turn outward, and then through-and-through sutures are placed to fix it in this corrected state. The resultant defect between the lower end of the tarsus and the retractor is filled with a conchal cartilage graft. The raw surface of the cartilage is epithelialized from the surrounding mucosa within 1 to 2 weeks without shrinkage. This technique is more stable than any other technique that we have performed.\r"

The patient returned to her daily life 3 months after the operation. She had no trouble in her daily living, without any dislocation of the sternoclavicular joints or any displacement of the artificial sternum. The autopsy examination about 1 year after the operation showed that the Dacron fabric enveloping the artificial sternum became stronger with time. The sternoclavicular joint also was stably fixed, and the Dacron fabric fulfilled its function as an artificial articular capsule and biologic fixation of the surrounding supporting tissues.\r"

Rather, the initial interdisciplinary teams took root in large hospitals and tertiary medical center inpatient services during the middle 1960s. By the early 1970s, however, numerous papers appeared that described a unique and exciting practice model that incorporated primary care physicians and clinical pharmacists. The sole purpose of the interdisciplinary concept was to allow each member to contribute their own expertise to improve patient care. In my experience, primary care physicians have been eager to consult clinical pharmacists and other health professionals. I believe that the reason for this is a fundamental philosophy that distinguishes these physicians from other medical specialists. Ingrained in their philosophy are concepts such as continuity of care and care of the entire patient. The latter relates, not only to multiple organ systems, but also the spiritual and behavioral characteristics of the person. The primary care physician is also viewed as the coordinator for all health care services required by their patients. Most primary care physicians welcome others' expertise as long as they continue to be the health care coordinator for the patient. The health care structure of the United States continues to shift to ambulatory care. This will provide additional opportunities for the types of group models described in this article. After 20 years, the positive impact that physician and pharmacotherapist teams can have on drug therapy is being recognized on a broader scale. These models should continue to move from the academic laboratory to private group practice.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

First, drug therapy should never be considered without adequate dietary intervention. Dietary therapy may be effective for many patients with mild to moderate elevations in cholesterol. None of the drugs used to treat lipid disorders are benign agents. There is still debate about the interpretations of recent studies, the ability to generalize from studies to the whole population, and the cost effectiveness of drug treatment. Within the framework of the AHA and NCEP guidelines, an individualized approach to therapy is prudent. This should be initiated with maximal patient education because drug therapy will be maintained for the long-term or for life. The LDL and HDL levels, age, sex, other CHD risk factors, cost of treatment, patient awareness, and motivation must all be assessed when making treatment decisions. When drug therapy is considered for patients with isolated hypercholesterolemia, bile acid sequestrants are the drugs of choice.\r"

  ".W": "Although either insulin or oral hypoglycemics may be used in conjunction with diet and exercise in the management of type II diabetes, drug therapy for type I diabetes involves only insulin. C-peptide levels can be tested to assess whether the patient has remaining pancreatic endocrine function. Patients being started on insulin for the first time should receive a single injection of an intermediate-acting insulin of \"human\" origin at a dose of approximately 0.5 U/kg. Thereafter, fasting, mid-morning, mid-afternoon, bedtime, and possibly early morning blood sugars should be examined periodically to determine if the insulin dose needs to be increased, decreased, split, or if the patient needs to be on a two-insulin regimen. Intensive insulin therapy has become commonplace to control plasma glucose levels in the majority of patients receiving insulin therapy. Proper patient education regarding the insulin regimen, injection techniques, blood glucose monitoring, as well as diet, exercise, and foot care are essential if the patient's diabetes is to be controlled adequately. Guidelines for \"adequate\" glycemic control are outlined in Table 6. Recent evidence suggests that tight control of plasma glucose levels may decrease the macrovascular complications of diabetes. Although there is also evidence to suggest that the onset of microvascular complications might be delayed with strict glycemic control, the data are conflicting. The benefits of strict control must be weighted against the problems of hypoglycemia experienced by many patients who attempt tight control of their blood glucose levels. Biguanide compounds are available in Europe, but the sulfonylureas comprise the only class of oral agents in the United States commercially available for the treatment of type II diabetes. The two generations of these drugs reflect their potency and possible side-effect profiles. Of the first-generation agents, tolbutamide and chlorpropamide are the most widely prescribed. Tolbutamide is the weakest of the sulfonylureas, possibly making it a good drug for initiating oral therapy in the elderly. Chlorpropamide is becoming a less popular agent because of its long duration of action and its increased incidence of side effects. Of the second-generation agents, glyburide offers a better dosing schedule (once daily compared with twice daily for glipizide); however, glyburide may produce a greater incidence of hypoglycemia, particularly in the elderly or in patients with significant renal impairment. There are few good studies comparing these two drugs so that recommending one over the other is difficult. Drug interactions are numerous with the first-generation drugs, but less so with the newer second-generation agents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Several important points regarding the treatment of urinary tract infections should be made. Single-dose and short-course antibiotic therapy is appropriate only for women with acute bacterial cystitis due to E. coli. Studies comparing single-dose to full-course therapy have not been sufficiently designed to draw valid statistical conclusions, and only TMP/SMX is recommended at this time. Recurrent UTI in women is almost always due to reinfection, which is best managed by prophylactic antibiotics. Acute bronchitis and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis are often due to viral infections, and therefore antibiotic therapy is not always needed. In acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, the clearest success rates for antibiotic therapy have been in patients, who have all three of the following symptoms: increased dyspnea, increased sputum production, and sputum purulence. Mupirocin is an important addition to the agents used to treat bacterial skin infections due to streptococcal and staphylococcal strains. In impetigo, mupirocin has been demonstrated to be as effective or superior to oral erythromycin. In prostatitis, data on the fluoroquinolones appears impressive, but further comparative trials are needed. They may become first-line, empiric therapy. The newer oral antibiotics are not recommended as initial, empiric therapy in the outpatient management of common infections, with the possible exception of the treatment of prostatitis. These newer agents may be more important in the treatment of recurrent or resistant infections.\r"

  ".W": "The key to the proper treatment of affective disorder is a correct diagnosis of the subtype of depressive illness. Thus, primary treatment recommendations include the TCAs for a depressive episode; ECT for a depressive episode with psychotic features; and MAOIs for dysthymic disorder and atypical depressive episodes. Nonresponding patients are treated with either lithium augmentation of TCA therapy, an MAOI, or ECT. Second-generation antidepressants are not usually indicated as initial treatments. They are recommended in situations in which their adverse-effect profiles offer significant advantages over TCAs in an individual patient. Second-generation antidepressants have not been extensively studied in patients who do not respond to TCAs. Maintenance antidepressant may be necessary to prevent recurrent depressive episodes. Lithium remains the mainstay of acute treatment of mania and for prophylaxis of subsequent affective episodes. In lithium-refractory or lithium-intolerant patients, carbamazepine is recommended. Valproic acid and verapamil have been useful, primarily in patients who do not respond to lithium and carbamazepine.\r"

  ".W": "More than a dozen NSAIDs are commercially available in the United States. Diclofenac may not be as effective for dysmenorrhea. Although most are equally efficacious, indomethacin is the preferred agent for hemicrania continua and chronic paroxysmal hemicrania. Although all NSAIDs should theoretically be beneficial in gout, the greatest experience is with indomethacin. Sulindac may be the preferred agent for diabetic neuropathy. Fenoprofen appears to be the most offensive NSAID in terms of nephrotoxicity. NSAIDs may antagonize antihypertensive therapy, although this effect may not persist beyond 1 month. Generally, use of NSAIDs in pediatric patients is limited to naproxen and tolmetin. Concomitant therapy with methotrexate, lithium, and AZT should be approached with caution. NSAIDs have similar propensities to cause gastrointestinal side effects. Sucralfate has consistently proved beneficial as cytoprotective therapy for use with NSAIDs without impairing absorption of the NSAID, NSAIDs generally should be avoided prior to surgery, although sulindac or nonacetylated salicylates have a negligible effect on platelet function and may be used if continued NSAID therapy is required. Hepatotoxicity, although rare with NSAIDs, is most common with phenylbutazone and least common with the fenamates.\r"

(4) What are the major risks inherent to this particular drug treatment? (5) Do the benefits outweight the risks? and (6) How can the risks be minimized by adjusting the drug dosage and duration? It is important to inform the patient of the possible risks and have her participate in making treatment decisions. If possible, the fetus or neonate should be monitored for adverse reactions during the course of treatment, and if any serious problems occur, the medication can be discontinued. Although it is true that no drug is totally without risk when used during pregnancy or lactation, if proper precautions are taken, then treatment can be rendered with minimal risks to both mother and child.\r"

The key to decreasing the incidence of this disease is education to prevent people from starting to smoke and to educate those who do smoke to stop. The therapeutic management involves numerous medications, oxygen, and physiotherapy. Unfortunately, the pharmacologic management remains largely empiric with sympathomimetics, anticholinergics, methylxanthines, and corticosteroids. These agents, especially methylxanthines and corticosteroids, are not without considerable toxicity. Therefore, embarking on a pharmacologic plan requires weighing the risk to benefit ratio carefully and having a comprehensive plan to assess subjectively and objectively the efficacy and toxicity of the chosen therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Factors thought to affect the success of and energy requirements for cardioversion of atrial fibrillation were studied in 80 (49 male, 31 female) patients aged 21-88 (mean 61.5 years). Transthoracic impedance was measured in advance of the countershock using a 30 kHz low amplitude AC current passed through self-adhesive ECG/defibrillator pads (diameters 8-12 cm) applied to the chest in the antero-posterior (AP) position in 57 patients and the anteroapical (AA) position in 23 patients. Mean transthoracic impedance for all patients was 69.3 +/- 16 (SD) ohms (range 39-131 ohms), but transthoracic impedance was significantly greater in the AA than the AP position (75.4 +/- 13 vs. 66.7 +/- 16 ohms, p = 0.02). Initial energy was 50 J (delivered) and was gradually increased to a maximum of 360 J if required. Cardioversion was successful in 73 of 80 (91.2 per cent), and low energy shocks (less than or equal to 200 J) were successful in 45 of 80 (56.2 per cent) patients. Using single factor analysis, sex, left atrial enlargement, electrode pad positions, aetiology of atrial fibrillation, presence of left ventricular failure, and prior treatment with verapamil or beta-adrenergic blockers were not significant determinants of cardioversion success or success of low energy shocks but prior treatment with digoxin was, both for cardioversion success and success at low energies. In patients with transthoracic impedance less than or equal to 70 ohms, low energy shocks were more often successful (33 or 50, 66 per cent) than in patients with transthoracic impedance greater than 70 ohms (12 of 30, 40 per cent), p = 0.04. Using univariate analysis, cardioversion success with low energy shocks was not only significantly associated with prior treatment with digoxin but also with the duration of atrial fibrillation (24 hours to one month and one month to three years) and for shocks of less than or equal to 100 J, with prior treatment with amiodarone. Multifactorial linear regression analysis selected, in rank order, only duration of atrial fibrillation of 24 hours to less than one month and one month to three years as significant predictors of both cardioversion success irrespective of shock strength, and success of low energy shocks.\r"

Lactovegetarianism (no meat, fish or egg consumption) was associated with significantly greater osteomalacic risk than ovolactovegetarianism (no meat or fish consumption). Unlike Asian rickets, high-extraction wheat cereal as chapatti was not a significant risk factor for osteomalacia in Asian women and dietary fibre was a less important risk factor than absent dietary meat, fish or egg. When exposure to ultraviolet radiation is limited, Asian osteomalacia (and Asian rickets) are determined by dietary factors.\r"

These models can both reveal the causes of conflicts of judgment and may help resolve them in a way that unaided discussion cannot. Revealing experts' models to students speeds learning of diagnostic skills. Clinical judgment analysis offers a method of probing the judgments not just of students and doctors but also of patients who have shown systematic differences in their perceptions of risk and benefit. The power and relevance of clinical trials can be improved by the consistent application of judgment policies generated from both the trialists and those who will use their results.\r"

We have studied the interferon system and natural killer cell activity in 25 patients with myasthenia gravis and compared them to 68 healthy subjects and 96 patients with acute viral infections. Forty-four per cent of patients had circulating interferon (greater than 16 mu/ml), and in a similar proportion their peripheral blood mononuclear cells were in an antiviral state, i.e., showed low levels of viral replication when infected by vesicular stomatitis virus. Spontaneous in vitro interferon production by patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells was also common (greater than 10 mu/ml, 32 per cent), while the response to the alpha-interferon inducer poly I:C was lower than expected, possibly reflecting the already high state of activation of the interferon system. These results were essentially similar to those obtained in patients with viral illnesses and differed significantly from healthy controls. In many myasthenia gravis patients (16 of 22, 73 per cent), a markedly deficient natural killer cell activity was found, with a median cytotoxicity of 6.5 per cent compared to 29 per cent in healthy subjects (p less than 0.005). Thus, many patients with myasthenia gravis have evidence of an activated interferon system and defective natural killer cell activity, suggesting an occult viral infection or reflecting nonspecific stimulation which may nevertheless contribute to the pathogenesis of the autoimmune response.\r"

Retreatment was required by 413 patients (40.2 per cent), with 134 patients (13.0 per cent) requiring more than two 131I doses. One hundred and eighty-nine patients received carbimazole after 131I until euthyroidism was achieved. The cumulative incidence of hypothyroidism at one, five, 10 and 15 years was 9.6 per cent, 31.4 per cent, 53.8 per cent and 65.8 per cent, respectively. The average incidence of hypothyroidism after the first two years was 3.3 per cent per annum. Stepwise logistic regression analysis of pretreatment variables suggested that a combination of adjunctive carbimazole therapy, absence of ophthalmopathy and longer effective half-lives of 131I were of value in predicting which patients were less likely to develop permanent hypothyroidism. However, the probability of accurately predicting permanent hypothyroidism based on the present model was only 60 per cent. We believe that no single pretreatment variable, or combination of variables, predicts long-term hypothyroidism with sufficient confidence to justify the use of a 'formula' approach for prescribing 131I therapy for Graves' disease.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-five patients (seven male, 18 female) were diagnosed as having the loin pain and haematuria syndrome. Presenting symptoms were either loin pain alone or pain associated with macroscopic or microscopic haematuria, and were longstanding, having been present for mean of 9.3 years in males, and 10 years in females. Ten patients described symptoms of passing gravel or renal stones but these were only demonstrated radiologically in two patients. Investigation of all patients showed anatomically normal renal tracts, normal renal function, and no significant proteinuria. Phase-contrast microscopy during episodes of haematuria revealed dysmorphic red cells in all 10 patients studied. Renal biopsies were performed in 20 patients and showed no glomerular pathology, but arteriolar and arterial hyalinosis was seen in 13 of 20 (65 per cent), fibro-elastosis in larger vessels in eight of 20 (40 per cent) and red blood cells in tubules in 13 of 20 (65 per cent) patients. The histological appearance in vessels was similar to that seen in cyclosporin A nephrotoxicity and would be consistent with the hypothesis that regional vasospasm occurs in the cortical circulation. Haematological studies in 22 patients, when compared with age and sex matched controls, showed the presence of circulating platelet aggregates, elevation of plasma beta-thromboglobulin (p less than 0.001), and increased platelet aggregation in response to serotonin and ADP (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.03, respectively). Plasma concentrations of D dimer (p less than 0.02) and C-reactive protein (p less than 0.03) were also significantly elevated in the patient group. There was no deterioration of renal function during a mean observation period of 3.7 years and no patients developed proteinuria. Treatment was largely supportive; seven patients with intractable loin pain underwent surgical denervation with the relief of pain in four.\r"

Using conventional clinical and laboratory criteria, an underlying myeloproliferative state was identified as the cause of the thrombosis in five patients (25%). A further 10 of the remaining 15 cases were found to have characteristic in vitro bone marrow culture studies and cytogenetic abnormalities suggestive of an underlying myeloproliferative disorder. Although none of these 10 cases have developed overt clinical and laboratory features of such a myeloproliferative disorder after a median observation period of two years, the presence of clonal karyotypic abnormalities in three cases, increased megakaryocyte colony growth in three cases and endogenous erythropoietin independent colony growth of the marrow erythroid progenitors in seven cases, argues strongly in favour of a primary haematological disorder. This has important therapeutic implications, particularly in cases being considered for orthotopic liver transplantation.\r"

A multi-causal model in which both psychological and physical factors play a part is helpful; a fundamental factor is continued misinterpretation of minor physical symptoms as evidence of heart disease. We report supportive evidence and describe a psychological treatment derived from the model. In a randomized trial, cognitive behavioural methods were effective in reducing chest pain, disability and use of medication, in patients both with and without psychiatric disorder. The clinical implications are discussed.\r"

The choice of the optimal management strategy for a patient with symptomatic gallstones in the 1990s will take into account the clinical status of the patient, the characteristics of the gallstones, and the patient's preference. Only patients whose doctors understand the advantages and disadvantages of the newer methods can make properly informed choices. When interventional radiologic alternatives to cholecystectomy are being contemplated, one approach is to first consider the patient's clinical presentation (acute or nonacute) and then their risk of death after cholecystectomy (low or high). Figure 5 shows an algorithmic approach to the management of gallbladder stones based on this concept. This algorithm also can be used as a framework for discussion of treatment options with any individual patient.\r"

The procedure is done in the fluoroscopy suite with an angioplasty balloon catheter. Transhepatic access is most common, but the procedure may be done via existing T-tube tracts or specially created jejunal loops. As the frequency of radical liver surgery such as liver transplant and radical trisegmentectomy rises, so too, the rate of biliary stricture is likely to rise, making percutaneous balloon dilatation an increasingly important tool in the interventional radiologist's armamentarium.\r"

  ".U": "91046716\r", 
  ".W": "Plastic biliary endoprostheses relieved malignant obstructive jaundice in 80% to 90% of the patients. The comfort of a completely indwelling endoprosthesis should be offered to all palliatively treated tumor patients, and external-internal catheters should be reserved for the minority of patients who return with reoccluded endoprostheses. These patients have bacterial flora that rapidly contaminates the endoprosthesis and causes encrustations and reocclusions. Thus, a second endoprosthesis also would reocclude quickly. The mechanism of reocclusion of plastic and metal endoprostheses is completely different. In plastic endoprostheses, bacterial contamination causes decomposition of the bile and subsequent encrustation. In metal endoprostheses tumor ingrowths between the struts of the stent cause reocclusion. Tumor ingrowths were observed in only 6.5% of metal prostheses with a narrow woven mesh (Wallstent), whereas prostheses with large distances between the struts (Gianturco stent) had ingrowth rates of 19% to 50%. This fact shows that tumor ingrowths can be reduced by narrowing the spaces between the metallic network, and, therefore, improvements in the design of the metal stents should reduce the occlusion rate to or below that of plastic endoprostheses, which currently have a lower encrustation rate. The major advantages of expandable metal prostheses are the relative ease and the minimal trauma of the implantation procedure. The Wallstent endoprosthesis, in particular, can be inserted through a 7-F introducer sheath and offers the chance of single-step placement. The 30-day mortality rate, therefore, was only 5%. This is significantly lower than the 30-day mortality rate after insertion of plastic prostheses (15% to 24%). Even simple external catheter drainage procedures have a higher reported 30-day mortality rate (27%). Expandable metal endoprostheses would be the most useful device if the occlusion rate could be kept under 10% in large series. Increasing the length of the endoprostheses to 10 cm in the expanded state could also improve the long-term patency rates.\r"

The frequency of bifurcational obstruction in this setting requires familiarity with drainages from both the right and the left transhepatic approach. The preferred right transhepatic approach is fluoroscopically guided; on the left, ultrasonography is the guidance of choice. Large caliber drainage catheters are required, and dilatation of the necessary transhepatic tracts is extremely painful unless adequate inhalation anesthesia or, preferably, epidural anesthesia, is provided. Long-term biliary drainage requires a choice between internal-external external drainage catheters and endoprostheses that is made by considering the patient's life expectancy and his or her adjustment to a stent extending to the outside. The feasibility of corrective procedures if an internal-external drainage catheter or an endoprosthesis becomes blocked needs to be considered before definitive placement. The interventional radiologist becomes intimately involved in the follow-up care of patients and frequently has to direct appropriate patient evaluation. Familiarity with antibiotic regimens is important.\r"

Intracorporeal EHL requires direct vision to prevent damage to the bile duct mucosa.

Sclerotherapy of the isolated gallbladder with 95% ethanol and 3% STS can be performed without toxic or otherwise adverse effects and is suitable to ablate the porcine gallbladder. Initial clinical trials with this new technique on a small number of patients are promising and have demonstrated that the protocol can be applied safely to humans. The electrocoagulation technique by catheter appears suitable to ablate the human cystic duct. Follow-up evaluation of our first patients is under way and must determine whether our regimen is appropriate to ablate the human gallbladder on a long-term basis. Further development of this new approach may eventually enable definitive nonoperative treatment of cholecystolithiasis in selected patients.\r"

It seemed to disappear as a clinical entity after that time, but it has been recorded with increasing frequency in the pediatric literature since 1979. We describe eight new cases and review 110 previously described cases. The clinical course consists of a prodromal upper respiratory illness with stridor, fever, and a variable degree of respiratory distress. Unlike patients with croup, patients with bacterial tracheitis do not respond to aerosolized racemic epinephrine. Most patients require endotracheal intubation; some require tracheostomy. Reported complications include pneumonia, pneumothorax, formation of pseudomembranes, toxic shock syndrome, and cardiopulmonary arrest. Bacterial tracheitis is a secondary bacterial infection following a primary viral respiratory infection. The most common preceding viral infection is parainfluenza. Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae are the predominant causes of bacterial tracheitis. Secondary bacterial infection may occur as a result of tracheal mucosal injury or impairment of normal phagocytic function due to viral infection.\r"

These etiologies were demonstrated in 1,637 (36.2%) of 4,521 cases. Among viruses, respiratory syncytial virus most frequently infected children; influenza virus showed the same pattern of circulation as in other European countries. Of nonviral agents, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and C. burnetii were most often involved in lower respiratory tract infections, with a variable predominance in patients of different ages. A high proportion of cases of M. pneumoniae infection occurred in infants and children aged less than 1 year, and most of these cases occurred during spring and summer. The majority of Q fever cases, including those observed in two outbreaks, occurred in the northern region.\r"

The great majority of patients with pulmonary infection due to M. kansasii had underlying pulmonary diseases, and 70% had nonpulmonary predisposing factors. M. kansasii pulmonary disease clinically and radiographically resembled pulmonary tuberculosis. Disseminated M. kansasii infection occurred in severely immunocompromised patients, who frequently had pulmonary predispositions as well. Disseminated infection most of ten involved the lung, reticuloendothelial system, bone, joint, and skin and presented with signs and symptoms related to these organs. Despite only moderate in vitro susceptibility of M. kansasii to routine antituberculous drugs, most patients responded to rifampin-containing regimens. The prognosis of patients with M. kansasii disease was determined primarily by their underlying diseases.\r"

Four species accounted for 191 (52%) of aerobic actinomycete isolates: Nocardia asteroides (98 isolates), Actinomadura madurae (42 isolates), Streptomyces griseus (28 isolates), and Nocardia brasiliensis (23 isolates). Sputum and wounds were the most common sources. No isolate was resistant to amikacin, no N. brasiliensis isolate was resistant to sulfamethoxazole or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and no A. madurae isolate was resistant to ceftriaxone or imipenem. In summary, our findings show that unusual species of aerobic actinomycetes can cause infection, colonization, or both and that antimicrobial resistance varies markedly by species.\r"

Group B streptococcal infections of muscle are rare. We report here an unusual case of group B streptococcal pyomyositis. Pyomyositis arises predominantly from infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus and, occasionally, Streptococcus pyogenes. Because of the rarity of pyomyositis in temperate climates, the common lack of localizing signs or symptoms, and the frequently negative blood cultures, considerable delay often precedes the diagnosis of pyomyositis; in fact, the infection has been initially misdiagnosed as muscle hematoma, cellulitis, thrombophlebitis, osteomyelitis, or neoplasm. Diagnosis may be greatly aided by radiologic techniques that can demonstrate the sites of muscle enlargement and the presence of fluid collections. The response to antibiotics is usually rapid, but resolution of the infection may require aspiration of deeply situated muscle abscesses. This report describes a diabetic patient with an unusual presentation of pyomyositis that mimicked an acute abdomen.\r"

Of the 38 patients who met the study criteria, 11 had had a course of intravenous acyclovir initiated within the first 36 hours of hospitalization; the mean time from admission to initiation of therapy in this early-treatment group was 9.6 hours. The group that received early acyclovir treatment had a lower mean temperature beginning on the fifth day of hospitalization (37.0 degrees C vs. 37.7 degrees C; P = .011) and a lower mean respiratory rate beginning on the sixth day of hospitalization (21 vs. 28 respirations per minute; P = .004). Early acyclovir therapy also resulted in a significant improvement in oxygenation beginning on the sixth day of hospitalization in patients with follow-up arterial blood gas measurements (P = .035). Thus, early institution of acyclovir therapy is associated with reduction in fever and tachypnea and improvement in oxygenation in otherwise healthy adults with varicella pneumonia.\r"

The biliary tract and central venous catheters were the most common sources of bacteremia. Two-thirds of patients had preceding antibiotic therapy. The overall mortality was 24%; mortality attributable to enterobacter bacteremia was 18%. Statistically significant differences in mortality were associated with an age less than 18 months (P = .031) or thrombocytopenia (P = .017); presence of fever was of borderline significance (P = .098).

The group C streptococci include the large colony of Voges-Proskauer-negative bacteria (Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus equisimilis, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, and Streptococcus dysgalactiae) as well as as the minute colony of Voges-Proskauer-positive Streptococcus anginosus (\"Streptococcus milleri\") group C organisms. Any joint may become infected, but joints affected by preexisting rheumatologic abnormalities are more frequently involved. Bacteremia was documented in five of the 10 patients. One patient had an associated pneumonia, and another patient had an associated acute aortic valve endocarditis. None of the infections involved a prosthetic joint or an overlying cellulitis, associations reported for group G streptococcal arthritis. Surgical drainage of the infected joint was required in six of the 10 patients. We concluded that the presence of two groups of organisms sharing the same Lancefield group antigen necessitates the careful identification of isolates to determine potential clinical differences.\r"

Culture of the conjunctival exudate yielded N. meningitidis in all cases, and 44% of the isolated meningococci belonged to serogroup B. Ocular complications, which occurred in 15.5% of the patients, most frequently were corneal ulcers. Systemic meningococcal disease developed in 17.8% of the patients; the overall mortality was 13.3% for patients with PMC complicated by systemic disease. Development of systemic disease was significantly more frequent in patients receiving only topical therapy than in those treated with systemic therapy (31.71% vs. 2.38%; P = .001). Gram-negative diplococci observed in conjunctival exudate are an indication for systemic antibiotic therapy because of the risk of systemic complications associated with the use of topical therapy alone.

That the vaginal flora forms part of a dynamically changing ecosystem is evident from the variable prevalence and population levels of each bacterial species detected with repetitive longitudinal sampling, with pregnancy, and with stage in the menstrual cycle. This review emphasizes the role that vaginal lactobacilli may play in control of the vaginal microflora and maintenance of the normal state. Lactobacilli possess many antagonistic properties and produce many metabolites that may be important in maintaining dominance in the vagina. Contradictory data from previous studies regarding the impact of factors such as contraception, catamenial products, and physiologic elements on the vaginal microflora are due in part to poor study design and differences in methodology. Well-designed and controlled investigations with large numbers of individuals in each group are needed, and the limitations of the methodology for such investigations must be considered. Studies of the normal flora, exploring the interaction of lactobacilli and other bacterial species, must be performed before the pathologic processes resulting in vaginitis or systemic sequelae are investigated.\r"

  ".W": "The 4-fluoroquinolones are a new class of antimicrobial agents that possess broad in vitro antibacterial activity, including efficacy against enteric pathogens such as Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, and Vibrio species. These drugs are clinically effective against both drug-sensitive and multiresistant strains of Salmonella typhi and Salmonella paratyphi that cause enteric fever. In salmonella enterocolitis, the quinolones--unlike older antimicrobial agents that may have little impact on the duration of symptomatic illness and can in fact prolong fecal carriage of salmonellae--actually shorten the course of clinical disease and terminate excretion of these organisms in the stool. Similarly, for chronic carriers of both typhoidal and nontyphoidal Salmonella strains, the quinolones are effective in eradicating biliary and fecal reservoirs of infection. Immunosuppressed persons with salmonellosis, such as those with AIDS, may benefit from both short-term treatment and prolonged prophylaxis with a quinolone antibiotic. The optimal agent, dose, and duration of quinolone therapy for all salmonella syndromes remain to be determined by larger controlled trials.\r"

During World War II, attention was called to a possible nutritional origin for most of these diseases. Recently, however, human T lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I), formerly linked only to a rare form of leukemia (adult T cell leukemia), has been associated with a spastic paraplegia observed mostly in tropical areas and referred to as tropical spastic paraparesis. This entity is also observed in nontropical areas endemic for HTLV-I, including Japan, South America, and the southern United States. Viruses of the HTLV family are being associated increasingly with pathology in humans. The pathogenesis of HTLV-I-associated tropical spastic paraparesis remains to be understood. However, future research is expected to favor a multidisciplinary approach, with exciting potential insights derived from the fields of neurology, immunology, and infectious diseases. The aim of this review is to summarize contemporary research related to the viral etiology of this clinical entity.\r"

These include the formation of the Canadian Infectious Diseases Society and the development of the first Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons examinations in the subspecialty of infectious diseases. The majority of Canadians training for practice in the field of infectious diseases are now enrolled in programs in Canada. Despite predictions in the United States of an excess of physicians who specialize in infectious diseases, such a situation has not occurred in Canada. More physicians with training in infectious diseases will be required in Canada in the next decade to fill positions in patient care, microbiology (for individuals with both clinical and laboratory training), research, epidemiology and infection control, programs related to human immunodeficiency virus infections, geographic and international medicine, the pharmaceutical industry, and education and administration. In Canada, the extent to which infectious diseases physicians are involved in these areas varies from that in the United States. This review suggests a continued need for physicians with appropriate training in infectious diseases.\r"

Clinicians have made great strides in the treatment of tumors, opportunistic infections, and complications associated with AIDS as well as in the treatment of the infection itself. In selected patients, treatment with interferon-alpha has been successful against AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. Attempts to treat the leukopenia and anemia of patients with AIDS by the administration of hematopoietic growth factors have resulted in increased white blood cell counts and a decrease in erythrocyte transfusion requirements. In addition to zidovudine, several antiretroviral agents are undergoing testing, including the nucleoside analogues dideoxycytidine and dideoxyinosine, soluble CD4, and the glycosidase inhibitor N-butyldeoxynojirimycin.\r"

The ELISA is currently the preferred initial screening test, although a variety of other rapid immunoassays have also been developed. Methods defining the antigenic specificity of the antibody response, such as the western blot, have become standard confirmatory tests in this setting. CD4+ cell enumeration and the HIV-1 antigen capture assay are useful in predicting the course of HIV-1 infection and in monitoring antiretroviral therapies. Newer techniques of HIV-1 co-cultivation permit the characterization of viral isolates and the stratification of patients and facilitate monitoring of the effects of antiretroviral agents. The polymerase chain reaction is of value in identifying HIV-1 infection in individuals with inconclusive serologic results. Judicious use of other laboratory tests, including surrogate markers such as beta 2-microglobulin, also provides prognostic information potentially useful in clinical management of HIV-1-infected patients.\r"

In clinical studies, GM-CSF given alone dramatically increased counts of white cells, particularly neutrophils and band cells. Very small doses of GM-CSF, self-administered subcutaneously, restored white cell production in leukopenic patients with AIDS. Combination treatment with AZT and GM-CSF in AZT-intolerant patients allowed resumption of AZT treatment and increased bone marrow cellularity. Treatment of anemic patients who have AIDS or AIDS-related complex with recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) produced promising results. After 12 weeks of treatment with r-HuEPO, the need for transfusions to maintain hematocrit values within the normal range was reduced significantly or eliminated in patients with low baseline levels of endogenous erythropoietin. Studies combining AIDS chemotherapy with CSF or erythropoietin treatment are proposed.\r"

Recently, the KS seen in association with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been shown to be mediated by the production of certain growth factors. HIV per se may also play an etiologic role via its tat gene. Therapeutic options include irradiation for local or cosmetic control, interferon-alpha, combinations of antiretroviral agents and interferon-alpha, and chemotherapy. The use of antineoplastic agents, either individually or in combination, in cases of advanced disease has been somewhat successful, but resultant immunosuppression and neutropenia may predispose patients to further infection, thereby adversely affecting survival. AIDS-related lymphoma, a late manifestation of HIV infection, often presents with widespread extranodal disease; the median survival time in all series has been approximately 6 months. Two-thirds of patients may have central nervous system involvement at some time in the course of illness. Intensive chemotherapeutic regimens are associated with an increased likelihood of opportunistic infection and do not prolong survival. Combinations of antineoplastic agents given at low doses for short periods may be associated with long-term remissions.\r"

The recent report of HIV resistance associated with long-term AZT therapy has accelerated the sense of urgency about the development of additional agents for use--either alone or in combination with AZT--against this infection. Several new agents are in various stages of preclinical or clinical evaluation. Some, such as dideoxycytidine, dideoxyinosine, dideoxydidehydrothymidine, azidouridine, and foscarnet, inhibit viral DNA synthesis through inhibition of reverse transcriptase. Other potentially useful agents presumably act at different stages of infection. Soluble CD4, for example, is a soluble form of the receptor to which HIV must bind to infect cells, and castanospermine represents a new class of compounds that block the maturation process of the viral glycoprotein. An apparently more potent and less toxic analogue of the latter agent, N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin, is currently in phase I testing.\r"

In Israel, immunization of infants against measles began in 1967, and 90% had been immunized by the mid-1980s. In Gaza and the West Bank, where immunization of infants against measles began in 1973 and 1976, respectively, the immunization rate reached 75% in the late 1970s and increased to greater than 90% in the 1980s. Measles epidemics, which previously had occurred in 5- to 7-year cycles, occurred every 2-4 years in the 1980s and affected individuals who were older than those affected in previous years. Israel's commitment to eradicating measles by 1992 will require a substantially expanded immunization program in comparison with the traditional program that requires immunization of infants alone. The benefits of several alternative immunization strategies considerably exceed their costs. A new, two-dose immunization will be needed as a minimal strategy, and a campaign for administering booster doses to school-aged children may be required as well to achieve control and eradication of measles. Measles is a serious but preventable public health problem; appropriate strategies must be devised by national and international public health officials to control the disease in developing and developed countries.\r"

Because of its complex structure, long replicative cycle, low yield in vitro, and highly species-specific cell-substrate requirement, the cellular and molecular biologic analyses of human CMV have been slow, but recombinant DNA and monoclonal antibody technologies are bringing about rapid changes. Because of the long period of latency and wide range of disease presentations, epidemiologic and medical insights have also come slowly. However, the clinical events that occur during iatrogenic immunosuppression (transplantation and cancer therapy) and as a result of immunocompromise due to human immunodeficiency virus infection are currently promoting our understanding of the epidemiology of CMV disease and the definition of its clinical spectrum. Rapid diagnostic methods, antiviral drugs, and vaccines for CMV are becoming available. We may not yet understand completely the impact of this agent on the nonimmunosuppressed or aspects of its pathogenesis: e.g., the immune functions controlling recrudescence and the possibility of increased disease severity in those with no detectable immune defect. With the availability of new approaches, other issues should be clarified, such as the functions of host and virus involved in the mechanism of persistence.\r"

A major unsolved problem in the study of CMV is the nature of viral latency. Knowledge regarding the requirements for activation of latent infection at the molecular, cellular, or host level is incomplete. Both viral and host factors may contribute to the successful transmission of CMV by latently infected cells in transplanted organs and transfused blood.\r"

A number of host and viral factors are associated with pathology following CMV infection. CMV can be found at many sites in the body but only causes disease at some of these and then only in certain patient populations. In some situations the mechanism underlying disease is direct viral replication, but in others, particularly CMV pneumonitis in allogeneic transplant recipients, an immunopathologic basis is strongly implicated. An important factor in the pathogenesis of infection and the expression of symptomatic disease is the source of CMV infection-whether it arises from an exogenous source or is due to reactivation of latent endogenous virus. Exogenous infection can occur in previously seronegative individuals or in those with prior exposure to the virus. In renal transplant recipients both types of exogenous infection have been associated with disease. Another factor that affects the interaction between CMV and its host is the modulating effect of the virus on the host immune response, the mechanism of which remains unknown.\r"

The crucial role of T cells in the host defense against CMV may be inferred by the expression of life-threatening CMV disease in these restricted patient subpopulations. However, detailed understanding of the pathogenesis of CMV disease in the compromised host is lacking, and the mechanisms by which T cells confer protection are unknown. Insight into the pathogenesis of CMV in these patients is crucial for the development of rational therapeutic strategies. A considerable body of data has been generated to explore the role of T cell-mediated immunity in a number of model viral infections as well as in experimental CMV infections in both normal and immunocompromised mice. This experience will be critically reviewed to clarify the often conflicting observations regarding a protective or, conversely, a pathogenic role for T cells in producing CMV disease.\r"

Newer serologic assays such as enzyme immunoassay or latex agglutination assay are accurate and efficient for screening donors and recipients and for determining susceptibility to primary infection. Available IgM antibody assays have occasional utility in recognition of recent infection. The slow process of isolating CMV in cell culture has prompted development of effective rapid techniques that utilize CMV-specific monoclonal antibodies and DNA sequences. Immediate-early viral antigen can be detected in infected cell cultures within hours of specimen inoculation. CMV antigens can also be detected directly in cells within clinical specimens. DNA hybridization has been used for CMV analysis in dot-blot, Southern blot, and in situ hybridization assays; the use of the latter is increasing for the detection of virus in fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Antigen or nucleic acid detection procedures, when applied directly to relevant clinical specimens, aid in the recognition of tissue invasive disease for which antiviral therapy might be considered. DNA amplification, using the polymerase chain reaction, achieves new levels of sensitivity in viral detection and should be useful for clinical diagnosis and for investigation of CMV pathogenesis and latency.\r"

The test is based on immunocytochemical detection of CMV immediate early antigens in blood leukocytes. Technical aspects and pitfalls are discussed. The diagnostic merits of the test are compared with those of other methods, such as isolation of virus from blood, serologic determinations, and the polymerase chain reaction. Overall, active CMV infection can be diagnosed by the detection of CMV antigenemia with a sensitivity and specificity of greater than or equal to 90%, whereas sensitivity is 100% in symptomatic patients. On average, the test provides diagnostic information at least 1 week earlier than other established methods. Moreover, the level of CMV antigenemia appears to be related to the severity of disease and to be inversely related to the level of host immunocompetence. It is concluded that (1) the test is useful for the early and rapid diagnosis of life-threatening CMV infection in immunodeficient patients, (2) the test could be a useful tool in the study of the immunopathophysiology of CMV disease, and (3) the antigenemia test may be a promising marker for monitoring disease activity and its response to specific chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the single most important infectious agent affecting recipients of organ transplants, with at least two-thirds of these patients having CMV infection 1-4 months after transplantation. Latently infected allografts are the major exogenous source of CMV infection in transplant recipients, although leukocyte-containing blood products can also transmit the virus. Three patterns of CMV infection are recognized: primary infection, reactivation infection, and superinfection. Primary infection has the greatest clinical impact. The clinical effects of CMV infection include infectious disease syndromes such as pneumonia and chorioretinitis; an immunosuppressed state that predisposes to potentially lethal opportunistic infection; and the initiation of a process that can result in allograft injury. Progress has been made in controlling CMV infection; hyperimmune anti-CMV globulin and certain antiviral drugs appear promising for prophylaxis, and the combination of hyperimmunoglobulin and ganciclovir appears promising for therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) has been shown to be an important pathogen in liver transplant recipients. The presence of primary infection and the use of OKT3 monoclonal antibodies appear to be risk factors for symptomatic infection. In my experience, the disease is clinically similar to the CMV disease seen in other transplant groups except that infection of the liver may be clinically more important in liver recipients than in other transplant recipients. Various regimens for prevention of CMV infection in transplant recipients have been investigated, including vaccination, prophylaxis with a variety of polyclonal immunoglobulin preparations, the use of immunomodulators such as interferon-alpha, and antiviral prophylaxis with acyclovir. These studies have been performed in kidney or bone marrow recipients and may not be applicable to liver recipients. Studies in progress on which no data are currently available employ human monoclonal immunoglobulin and ganciclovir. It is not possible at present to make any specific recommendations for prophylaxis. It is likely that ongoing randomized studies and further understanding of host-virus interactions in CMV disease will lead to useful prophylactic regimens in this group of patients.\r"

  ".U": "91047544\r", 
  ".W": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection occurs in approximately 50% of all recipients of allogeneic bone marrow transplants and is seen more frequently in CMV-seropositive patients than in CMV-seronegative patients. Sources of infection include reactivation of latent endogenous virus, blood products from CMV-seropositive blood donors, and the use of marrow from a CMV-seropositive donor for a CMV-seronegative recipient. The most common and severe clinical syndrome associated with CMV infection in allogeneic transplant recipients is interstitial pneumonia, which occurs in approximately 15% of patients. Risk factors for CMV pneumonia include old age, conditioning with total-body irradiation, and severe graft-vs.-host disease. The rapid diagnosis of CMV pneumonia has been facilitated by immunochemical staining of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or by centrifugation of cell cultures with CMV monoclonal antibodies. The treatment of CMV pneumonia remains problematic, but therapy with a combination of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) plus ganciclovir has resulted in survival rates substantially better than those achieved in previous trials of antiviral therapy. In CMV-seronegative patients, CMV infection and pneumonia can be prevented or modified by the use of CMV-seronegative blood products and IVIG. IVIG may also have the additional benefits of preventing other infectious complications and graft-vs.-host disease in patients receiving CMV-seronegative blood products. For CMV-seropositive patients, effective prophylaxis for CMV reactivation and pneumonia has not yet been established, but a clinical trial of prophylactic ganciclovir is now under way.\r"

CMV excretion occurred in 24%, viremia in 9%, seroconversion in 40%, and overall active infection in 47%. CMV disease was much less common. Retinitis, enteritis, and pneumonitis occurred in only one, five (less than 1%), and 55 (7%) of the patients, respectively. Allograft recipients were more likely to develop CMV disease than were autograft patients (P = .0001) despite comparable rates of active CMV infection. CMV disease was rare after primary infection in both autograft and allograft recipients (0 and 1%, respectively). In contrast, CMV disease occurred in 16% of seropositive allograft recipients. Among allograft recipients, risk factors for CMV pneumonitis were seropositivity, age greater than 10 years, and acute graft-vs.-host disease, while the use of cyclosporine as prophylaxis against graft-vs.-host disease was protective. Although active infection rates did not decrease, the rates of CMV pneumonitis in allograft recipients during successive years declined significantly (P less than .001).\r"

In addition, CMV may potentiate the cellular immunodeficiency observed in patients with HIV infection either directly or through enhancement of HIV replication. Finally, CMV may predispose the host to bacterial or fungal infection by compromising the integrity of mucosal barriers to infection. Therapy with ganciclovir for CMV infection may result in a decrease in morbidity related to the virus, but problems with drug toxicity and resistance to the agent mandate the development of additional therapeutic approaches.\r"

Thirteen children belonged to the P0 (indeterminate) group, one to the P1 (asymptomatic) group, and 24 to the P2 (symptomatic) group, per the classification of the Centers for Disease Control. Of the 24 children in the P2 group, 10 died. The mean follow-up time was 22.8 months for the 10 children who died and 16.3 months for the 13 children in the P0 group. Serial cultures of urine were performed for all 38 patients. CMV was isolated from seven of 10 children who died and from four of 14 children who survived (P less than .05). Only one of the 13 P0 children was culture-positive for CMV, as compared with 11 of 24 P2 children (P less than .05). All CMV-infected children continued to demonstrate CMV viruria in serial cultures. The mean age at the time of the first culture positive for CMV was 13 months. Microcephaly was present in 15 (65%) of 23 P2 children but in none of the P0 and P1 children (P less than .05). Eight of 11 CMV-infected children were microcephalic; seven of 12 children not infected with CMV were microcephalic (P greater than .05). These data suggest that the prevalence of active CMV infection is significantly higher in P2 children than in P0 and P1 children. In addition, there is a significant association between CMV infection and mortality among P2 children.\r"

(2) The Towne vaccine partially protects seronegative renal transplant recipients from severe CMV disease but does not prevent them from getting infected. (3) In healthy subjects the live vaccine is also protective, but protection is related to challenge dose. Vaccine-derived immunity is equivalent to natural immunity for prevention of disease but at higher challenge doses is less protective for prevention of infection. (4) The viral envelope contains proteins that can stimulate humoral and cellular immune responses, although it is not yet clear whether the responses are as protective as those following infection. (5) One glycoprotein of the envelope, the 55-58K protein, can stimulate the same responses. If large amounts of this protein can be produced by molecular biologic techniques, this protein might be used as a subunit vaccine. (6) Target groups for vaccination would include seronegative healthy women and seronegative or seropositive recipients of solid organ transplants.\r"

In prospective studies of renal transplant recipients, prophylactic administration of CMV hyperimmunoglobulin reduced by 50% the clinical manifestations of primary CMV disease. CMV hyperimmunoglobulin had no effect on infection rates, but a trend toward a decreased rate of viremia was evident. Its protective effect was attenuated by increased immunosuppression, e.g., by use of antilymphocyte serum or monoclonal antibody for antirejection therapy. In bone marrow transplantation studies, large doses of hyperimmune plasma or gamma-globulin decreased rates of CMV pneumonia or interstitial pulmonary infiltrates. The mechanism of globulin protection has yet to be defined. Data on liver or heart transplantation are insufficient to permit a meaningful statement about efficacy of immunoglobulin for CMV prophylaxis. Preliminary uncontrolled studies suggest that high-dose immunoglobulin plus ganciclovir may be more effective than ganciclovir alone for treating CMV pneumonia in bone marrow transplant recipients. Questions remain unanswered about the use of CMV immunoglobulin in other settings or with antiviral therapy for prophylaxis.\r"

Favorable clinical responses to ganciclovir have been reported in approximately 80% of immunocompromised patients with CMV retinitis or gastrointestinal disease. CMV pneumonia is more difficult to treat, with therapy benefiting 10%-72% of patients. Ganciclovir must be given parenterally; the dose-limiting adverse event is neutropenia. Patients with AIDS frequently experience relapse and require maintenance therapy. Foscarnet is an attractive anti-CMV drug but must be given parenterally and is completely dependent on renal clearance for elimination. Prevention of CMV disease with antiviral drugs may be possible. Five weeks of intravenous acyclovir (500 mg/m2 three times a day) significantly reduced the risk of CMV infection and disease in seropositive allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients. The prophylactic benefit of acyclovir has recently been confirmed and extended by a placebo-controlled trial in renal allograft recipients at the University of Minnesota. A 12-week course of high doses of oral acyclovir (3,200 mg/d) was safe and significantly reduced the incidence of CMV infection and disease.\r"

The repression of the araBAD promoter is mediated by DNA looping between AraC protein bound at two sites near the promoter separated by 210 base pairs, araI and araO2. In vivo and in vitro experiments presented here show that an AraC dimer, with binding to half of araI and to araO2, maintains the repressed state of the operon. The addition of arabinose, which induces the operon, breaks the loop, and shifts the interactions from the distal araO2 site to the previously unoccupied half of the araI site. The conversion between the two states does not require additional binding of AraC protein and appears to be driven largely by properties of the protein rather than being specified by the slightly different DNA sequences of the binding sites. Slight reorientation of the subunits of AraC could specify looping or unlooping by the protein. Such a mechanism could account for regulation of DNA looping in other systems.\r"

In 1 molar NaCl at low temperatures, these molecules do not behave like single strands, but rather exhibit properties consistent with tetraplex formation. The standard state enthalpies, entropies, and free energies for formation of each tetraplex have been measured, as have preliminary nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. In 1 molar KCl, the melting behavior of the structure or structures is more complex than in 1 molar NaCl. This observation may be related to the recently proposed \"sodium-potassium switch.\"\r"

  ".W": "The role of defective glucose transport in the pathogenesis of noninsulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM) was examined in Zucker diabetic fatty rats, a model of NIDDM. As in human NIDDM, insulin secretion was unresponsive to 20 mM glucose. Uptake of 3-O-methylglucose by islet cells was less than 19% of controls. The beta cell glucose transporter (GLUT-2) immunoreactivity and amount of GLUT-2 messenger RNA were profoundly reduced. Whenever fewer than 60% of beta cells were GLUT-2-positive, the response to glucose was absent and hyperglycemia exceeded 11 mM plasma glucose. We conclude that in NIDDM underexpression of GLUT-2 messenger RNA lowers high Km glucose transport in beta cells, and thereby impairs glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and prevents correction of hyperglycemia.\r"

These include the silencers at the transcriptionally repressed mating-type genes, the promoters of many genes important for cell growth, and the poly[(cytosine)1-3 adenine] [poly(C1-3A)] repeats of telomeres. Because RAP1 binds in vitro to the poly(C1-3A) repeats of telomeres, it has been suggested that RAP1 may be involved in telomere function in vivo. In order to test this hypothesis, the telomere tract lengths of yeast strains that contained conditionally lethal (ts) rap1 mutations were analyzed. Several rap1ts alleles reduced telomere length in a temperature-dependent manner. In addition, plasmids that contain small, synthetic telomeres with intact or mutant RAP1 binding sites were tested for their ability to function as substrates for poly(C1-3A) addition in vivo. Mutations in the RAP1 binding sites reduced the efficiency of the addition reaction.\r"

In most cases, the fusion involves a reciprocal translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11), which produces the cytogenetically distinctive Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1). Fusion can be detected by Southern (DNA) analysis or by in vitro amplification of the messenger RNA from the fusion gene with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These techniques are sensitive but cannot be applied to single cells. Two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used with probes from portions of the bcr and abl genes to detect the bcr-abl fusion in individual blood and bone marrow cells from six patients. The fusion event was detected in all samples analyzed, of which three were cytogenetically Ph1-negative. One of the Ph1-negative samples was also PCR-negative. This approach is fast and sensitive, and provides potential for determining the frequency of the abnormality in different cell lineages.\r"

The cDNA hybridizes with a 7-kilobase RNA on a Northern blot and has an open reading frame of 970 amino acids. Hydropathy analysis suggests that the protein has multiple transmembrane helices, and a small region of the sequence is similar to that of the Na(+)- and K(+)-dependent adenosine triphosphatase. Polyclonal antibodies to a synthetic peptide from the deduced amino acid sequence react with sarcolemmal proteins of 70, 120, and 160 kilodaltons on immunoblots.

How the initial electrical signal is amplified in heart muscle has remained controversial, however. Analogous protein structures from skeletal muscle and heart muscle have been identified physiologically and sequenced; these include the Ca2+ channel of the sarcolemma and the Ca2+ release channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Although the parallels found in cardiac and skeletal muscles have provoked valuable experiments in both tissues, separation of the effects of voltage and intracellular Ca2+ on sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release in heart muscle has been imperfect. With the use of caged Ca2+ and flash photolysis in voltage-clamped heart myocytes, effects of membrane potential in heart muscle cells on Ca2+ release from intracellular stores have been studied. Unlike the response in skeletal muscle, voltage across the sarcolemma of heart muscle does not affect the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, suggesting that other regulatory processes are needed to control Ca2(+)-induced Ca2+ release.\r"

In the past, investigators have based speculations about the upper limits of human longevity on observations of past trends in mortality. Here the estimate of the upper bound is based on hypothesized reductions in current mortality rates necessary to achieve a life expectancy at birth from 80 to 120 years and an expectation of life at age 50 from 30 to 70 years. With the use of conditional probabilities of death from complete life tables for the United States, reductions in mortality required to achieve extreme longevity (that is, 80 to 120 years) were compared with those resulting from hypothetical cures for all cardiovascular diseases, ischemic heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Results indicate that in order for life expectancy at birth to increase from present levels to what has been referred to as the average biological limit to life (age 85), mortality rates from all causes of death would need to decline at all ages by 55%, and at ages 50 and over by 60%. Given that hypothetical cures for major degenerative diseases would reduce overall mortality by 75%, it seems highly unlikely that life expectancy at birth will exceed the age of 85.\r"

This order differs from both host-guest copolymer values (Met greater than Ile greater than Leu greater than Ala greater than Gln greater than Val greater than Thr greater than Asn greater than Ser greater than Gly) and the tendencies of these amino acids to occur in helices in globular proteins (Ala greater than Met greater than Leu greater than Gln greater than Ile greater than Val greater than Asn, Thr greater than Ser greater than Gly), but matches the order found in a series of synthetic coiled-coil alpha helices, except for Ser.

The open probability of leak channels is markedly increased in dystrophic myotubes. Other channel properties, such as mean open times, single channel conductance, ion selectivity, and behavior in the presence of pharmacological agents, were similar among myotube types. Compared to the Ca2+ concentrations in normal human and normal mouse myotubes, intracellular resting free Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) in myotubes of Duchenne and mdx origin were significantly higher at a time when dystrophin is first expressed in normal tissue. Taken together, these findings suggest that the increased open probability of Ca2+ leak channels contributes to the elevated free intracellular Ca2+ concentration in Duchenne human and mdx mouse myotubes.\r"

In order to elucidate the role of c-myc oncogene activation in B cell malignancy, the phenotypic changes caused by the expression of c-myc oncogenes in human B lymphoblastoid cells immortalized by Epstein-Barr virus were analyzed. C-myc oncogenes caused the down-regulation of lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) adhesion molecules (alpha L/beta 2 integrin) and loss of homotypic B cell adhesion in vitro. Down-regulation of LFA-1 occurred by (i) posttranscriptional modulation of LFA-1 alpha L-chain RNA soon after acute c-myc induction, and (ii) transcriptional modulation in cells that chronically express c-myc oncogenes. Analogous reductions in LFA-1 expression were detectable in Burkitt lymphoma cells carrying activated c-myc oncogenes. Since LFA-1 is involved in B cell adhesion to cytotoxic T cells, natural killer cells, and vascular endothelium, these results imply functions for c-myc in normal B cell development and lymphomagenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Voltage-gated sodium channels are transmembrane proteins of approximately 2000 amino acids and consist of four homologous domains (I through IV). In current topographical models, domains III and IV are linked by a highly conserved cytoplasmic sequence of amino acids. Disruptions of the III-IV linker by cleavage or antibody binding slow inactivation, the depolarization-induced closed state characteristic of sodium channels. This linker might be the positively charged \"ball\" that is thought to cause inactivation by occluding the open channel. Therefore, groups of two or three contiguous lysines were neutralized or a glutamate was substituted for an arginine in the III-IV linker of type III rat brain sodium channels. In all cases, inactivation occurred more rapidly rather than more slowly, contrary to predictions. Furthermore, activation was delayed in the arginine to glutamate mutation. Hence, the III-IV linker does not simply act as a charged blocker of the channel but instead influences all aspects of sodium channel gating.\r"

  ".U": "91047976\r", 
  ".W": "The ventromedial nuclei of the hypothalamus (VMN) are important for the control of feminine mating behavior, and hormone action within these nuclei has been causally related to behavior. Estradiol induces receptors for oxytocin in the VMN and in the area lateral to these nuclei over the course of 1 to 2 days, and progesterone causes, within 30 minutes of its application, a further increase in receptor binding and an expansion of the area covered by these receptors lateral to the VMN. The rapid progesterone effect appears to be a direct and specific effect of this steroid on the receptor or membrane, because it was produced in vitro as well as in vivo and was not mimicked by a variety of other steroids. The effect of progesterone occurred in the posterior part of the VMN, where oxytocin infusion facilitated feminine mating behavior; it did not take place in the anterior part of the VMN, where oxytocin infusion had no effect on mating behavior.\r"
