  ".W": "Terazosin is a new long-acting, selective alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist. Its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles are similar to those of prazosin, but terazosin has a half-life three to four times longer. This allows once daily dosing of terazosin and a potential advantage in ensuring patient compliance to treatment. Terazosin has been evaluated alone and in combination with other drugs for the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. Terazosin has been shown to have favorable lipid and side effect profiles. Unlike prazosin, the drug is available (but not yet marketed) in parenteral form. Its gradual onset of action with intravenous use would limit its potential application in hypertensive emergencies. Other possible uses for terazosin might include treatment of congestive heart failure and Raynaud's phenomenon, but definitive studies are needed.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate whether cessation of regular beta-agonist treatment results in an increase in bronchial responsiveness, two double-blind, randomised crossover studies were done. Subjects with mild asthma were investigated to determine the course of change in bronchial responsiveness, measured as the provocative dose (PD20) of histamine that caused a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s after short-term and longer term treatment with an inhaled beta-agonist. In the first study in 8 subjects, 500 and 2000 micrograms terbutaline thrice in 1 day protected against histamine-induced bronchoconstriction, and the increase in PD20 compared with placebo remained high throughout the day and overnight. In the second study 8 subjects received placebo or terbutaline 750 micrograms thrice daily for 14 days. The protection afforded by terbutaline against histamine-induced bronchoconstriction on day 14 was less than that on day 1 by 40% in the morning and 82% in the afternoon. On day 15 PD20 was lower after stopping terbutaline than placebo, with a maximum difference of 1.5 (95% CI 0.6-2.5) doubling-doses of histamine 23 h after the end of treatment. Thus treatment with terbutaline for 1 day did not result in any rebound increase in bronchial responsiveness. Treatment for 2 weeks impaired the ability of terbutaline to protect against histamine-induced bronchoconstriction, and was followed by a rebound increase in bronchial responsiveness after cessation of treatment.\r"

In each patient three blood specimens for culture and endotoxin testing were obtained at the onset of fever. Blood pressure, urinary output, and the occurrence of thrombocytopenia and metabolic acidosis were recorded prospectively during three days of follow-up. Septicaemia developed in 19 patients (4%). The sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratio for a positive result with the endotoxin assay were 79%, 96%, and 20, respectively. The corresponding indices for bacteraemia were 89%, 78%, and only 4. The results suggest that endotoxaemia is a clinically valid indicator for impending gram-negative septicaemia (positive predictive value 48%) and that the absence of endotoxaemia virtually rules out the risk that septicaemia will ensue (negative predictive value 99%).\r"

Bromocriptine-treated patients showed significant reductions in prolactin levels and in S-phase fraction of tumour cells within the primary infiltrating carcinoma. There were no major side-effects. Perioperative bromocriptine may provide another approach to adjuvant therapy, possibly combined with endocrine or cytotoxic treatment for patients with axillary nodal metastases.\r"

Simvastatin was better than bezafibrate at lowering total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B concentrations (30.4% [p less than 0.001], 37.3% [p less than 0.001], and 37.8% [p less than 0.001] vs 17.0%, 19.6%, and 24.0%, respectively). Both drugs increased the high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I, but this change was significant only with bezafibrate (p less than 0.05). Bezafibrate and simvastatin reduced triglycerides by 25.6% (p less than 0.001) and 13.7% (p less than 0.05), respectively. Very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-cholesterol was significantly reduced only by bezafibrate (44.3%, p less than 0.001). Both drugs were tolerated well and no serious side-effects were noted. The results show that simvastatin was more effective than bezafibrate in lowering total-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B, while bezafibrate was better at lowering triglycerides and VLDL-cholesterol and at raising HDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I.\r"

We developed from the literature a list of 864 possible reasons for performing carotid endarterectomy, and asked a panel of nationally known experts to rate the appropriateness of each indication using a modified Delphi technique. On the basis of the panel's ratings, we determined the appropriateness of carotid endarterectomy in a random sample of 1302 Medicare patients in three geographic areas who had had the procedure in 1981. Thirty-five percent of the patients in our sample had carotid endarterectomy for appropriate reasons, 32 percent for equivocal reasons, and 32 percent for inappropriate reasons. Of the patients having inappropriate surgery, 48 percent had less than 50 percent stenosis of the carotid artery that was operated on. Fifty-four percent of all the procedures were performed in patients without transient ischemic attacks in the carotid distribution. Of these procedures, 18 percent were judged appropriate, as compared with 55 percent judged appropriate in patients with transient ischemic attacks in the carotid distribution. After carotid endarterectomy, 9.8 percent of patients had a major complication (stroke with residual deficit at the time of hospital discharge or death within 30 days of surgery). We conclude that carotid endarterectomy was substantially overused in the three geographic areas we studied. Furthermore, in situations in which the complication rate is equal to or above the study's aggregate rate, carotid endarterectomy would not be warranted, even in cases with an appropriate indication, because the risks would almost certainly outweigh the benefits.\r"

Here we map the MEN-1 locus to chromosome 11 by family studies, and demonstrate tight linkage with the human muscle phosphorylase gene. By comparing constitutional and tumour tissue genotypes of insulinomas from a pair of brothers who had inherited MEN-1 from their mother, we have shown that oncogenesis in these cases involves unmasking of a recessive mutation at this locus.\r"

Attempts to determine the relative contribution of class I or class II major histocompatibility antigens and/or minor histocompatibility (miH) antigens towards the induction of an unresponsive state have yielded conflicting results. We have addressed this issue using DNA-mediated gene transfer to introduce murine class I or class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes from the organ donor into cells of recipient origin. This allowed murine recipients of cardiac allografts to be pretreated with either donor cells sharing only an isolated class I or class II MHC locus product with the donor organ. We show that pretreatment with either donor class I or class II antigens prolongs survival of cardiac allografts, and that the capacity of a particular donor MHC antigen to induce unresponsiveness is the product of its intrinsic immunogenicity and the antigen load delivered during pretreatment. These results explain discrepancies in earlier studies of antigen-induced unresponsiveness and suggest a novel approach to specific immunosuppression in clinical transplantation.\r"

This pilus mediates adherence to mannose-containing receptors on mucosal epithelia and other cells. The type-1 pilus, in one of several serological variants, is expressed by nearly all E. coli strains, and its promotion of colonization by pathogenic bacteria and the protective effects of purified pilus vaccines suggest that it is important as a bacterial virulence factor. Both the adhesive function and the serological variation of the type-1 pilus have been attributed to the thousand or so pilin protein monomers making up the pilus rods. This idea has been contradicted by our earlier observations on an E. coli strain expressing adhesion-defective pili. More recent genetic evidence also indicates that auxiliary pilus proteins are required for adhesive function. We report here the identification of three previously undetected integral minor proteins on the type-1 pilus, and show that one of them is the receptor-binding adhesin. This protein is antigenically conserved among strains with different pilin serotypes and is located at the pilus tip.\r"

This virus encodes a protein, p47gag-crk, that has blocks of sequence similarity to the amino-terminal, non-catalytic region of the non-receptor class of tyrosine kinases. In addition, the structure of p47gag-crk has striking similarity to a 180-amino acid region of bovine brain phospholipase C. Biochemical data suggest that p47gag-crk activates one or several endogenous tyrosine kinases.\r"

  ".U": "88156967\r", 
  ".W": "Segmentation in the inset embryo is initiated by maternally provided information, which is stored in the developing oocyte. In Drosophila, the genes necessary for this process have been genetically characterized. The anterior segmented region is organized by the bicoid (bcd) gene product. The posterior segmented region is organized by several interacting gene products, among them the oskar (osk) gene product. The first zygotic group of genes, which are thought to respond to the spatial cues provided by the maternal genes, are the gap genes, whose members include hunchback (hb), Kruppel (Kr) and knirps (kni). To elucidate the role played by the maternal genes in expression of the gap gene hb, antibodies were raised against a fusion protein and were used for the cytological localization of the hb gene product in wild-type and mutant embryos. The hb protein is predominantly located in the nucleus. Its spatial expression includes the formation of an anterior-posterior gradient during the early cleavage stages and a strong zygotic expression in the anterior half of the embryo. Analysis of embryos mutant for the maternal genes affecting the anterior-posterior segmentation pattern shows that the formation of the early gradient is controlled by the osk group of genes, whereas efficient activation of the zygotic anterior expression domain is dependent on bcd activity.\r"

The response was rated on a scale of 0 to 5 (1 = marked improvement, 4 = no response, 5 = worsening). The mean effect from tetrabenazine was rated as follows: 2.3 in 44 patients with tardive dyskinesia, 2.6 in 15 with tardive dystonia, 2.6 in 10 with Huntington's disease, 2.7 in 17 with Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome, 2.8 in 19 with generalized dystonia, 2.8 in 57 with Meige's syndrome, and 3.4 in 25 with other focal dystonias. Twenty-two patients with a variety of unusual movement disorders had a mean effect of 2.9. Parkinsonism occurred as a side effect in 53 patients, sedation in 28, depression in 23, anxiety in 16, insomnia in 11, and akathisia in 10. The choreatic movement disorders are most amenable to tetrabenazine therapy, but tardive and idiopathic dystonia may also be responsive. Tetrabenazine is an effective and relatively safe drug for a variety of hyperkinetic movement disorders.\r"

Following a retrospective review of eight patients treated with a variety of barbiturates and dosing regimens, we established a specific protocol employing pentobarbital and evaluated it prospectively in six patients. Among the 14 patients, intravenous barbiturates, when administered with a loading dose followed by continuous infusion, were uniformly effective in aborting seizures and producing a burst-suppression EEG pattern. Other than the pupillary light reflex, most patients lost all brainstem reflexes and motor responses during therapy. Barbiturate-induced hypotension was observed in 9 of the 14 patients, and required treatment with pressors in seven cases. Three patients died early as a consequence of their underlying illness, while three others died late for reasons unrelated to the status itself or to anticonvulsant therapy. The time to recovery of function following anesthesia varied highly, spanning hours to days for return of motor function and days to weeks for cognition. Of the eight survivors, four were left with mild cognitive deficits, one returned to his baseline dementia, and three had residual encephalopathies (severe in two). We conclude that barbiturate anesthesia is an extremely effective therapy for refractory seizures. However, its use necessitates recognition of untoward cardiovascular responses and prolonged intensive care.\r"

The clinical response to bromocriptine was compared with that of a placebo for the following hormones: prolactin (PRL), luteinizing hormone (LH)/follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) ratio, testosterone, androstenedione, estradiol-17 beta (E2), estrone (E1), and progesterone. Patients were divided into two subgroups: hyperprolactinemic (basal PRL greater than 20 ng/mL) and normoprolactinemic (basal PRL less than 20 ng/mL), and the response of both subgroups to bromocriptine was compared. Prolactin, LH/FSH ratio, testosterone, and E1 showed a significant drop with bromocriptine, whereas E2 significantly increased.

In a controlled, double-blind trial, the subjects were randomly allocated to four treatment groups receiving either placebo or 400, 600, or 800 micrograms Cabergoline (N = 8 in each group) within 24 hours after delivery. Treatment efficacy was assessed clinically by physical examination before (day 0) and at one, two, three, four, and 14 days after treatment. Plasma prolactin (PRL) concentrations were measured in blood samples collected before and at one, two, three, and four days after treatment. Lactation was prevented in four of the eight subjects (50%) who received 400 micrograms Cabergoline and in all subjects who received 600 or 800 micrograms Cabergoline. By contrast, only one of the eight subjects (12.5%) receiving placebo showed no signs of spontaneous lactation within the 14 days after delivery. No effects of placebo administration on plasma PRL levels were observed. Plasma PRL concentrations were significantly reduced starting from one day after Cabergoline administration, however, and the amount of inhibition of PRL secretion induced by different doses of the drug was not statistically different. These preliminary data demonstrate that Cabergoline has a dose-related effect in the prevention of postpartum lactation, and milk secretion can be prevented completely by a single oral administration of 600 or 800 micrograms of the drug.\r"

Ultrasound assessment of fetal breathing and body movements was performed only to evaluate the nonreactive NST. Decreased amniotic fluid volume and spontaneous fetal heart rate (FHR) decelerations were considered abnormal findings during antenatal testing, and served as indications for delivery regardless of FHR reactivity. Despite intervention, decreased amniotic fluid volume and spontaneous decelerations were associated with an increased incidence of meconium staining, decelerations during labor, cesarean section for fetal distress, and small for gestational age infants. Perinatal morbidity also occurred in patients with spontaneous decelerations and normal amniotic fluid volume. The search for spontaneous FHR decelerations by electronic fetal monitoring should continue during antepartum testing because FHR decelerations cannot be identified by conventional ultrasound assessment. The modified profile seems practical for routine assessment of fetal well-being in high-risk pregnancy, and affords insights unavailable with ultrasound surveillance alone.\r"

  ".W": "Previous attempts to computerize the analysis of fetal heart rate (FHR) using mainframe or minicomputers were not accepted in routine clinical practice because of their complexity, cost, and lack of validation. We describe the first practical, inexpensive system integrated into a clinical protocol that analyzes and documents FHR baseline, long-term variability, and episodic events using a standard microcomputer. A comparison of computerized and manual analyses of 284 nonstress tests (NSTs) of high-risk patients revealed no significant differences in determining the number of acceleration and deceleration events and mean FHR baseline. Long-term variability and other reported data could not be compared for lack of manual techniques. The combination of standardized analysis and quantified data may improve the predictive value of the computerized NST compared with the visually analyzed NST. Other benefits include computerized archiving, data transmission by telephone, and linkage to a perinatal data base.\r"

The purified antibodies recognized antigens on two human ovarian cell lines and several fresh ovarian tumor specimens, but did not react with nongynecologic tumors. The purified antibodies (IgG) were labeled with alkaline phosphatase, and a noncompetitive enzyme immunoassay was developed to detect the tumor-associated antigens in the sera of patients with ovarian cancer. The levels of tumor-associated antigens detected by this assay were found to be two to four times higher in patients with ovarian cancer than in controls. Levels of tumor-associated antigens were higher in patients with high levels of CA 125, although a direct correlation was not observed with the levels of CA 125 in these patients.\r"

These malignancies are often well differentiated and may behave similarly to estrogen-induced endometrial carcinomas. After surgical castration of a premenopausal woman with endometriosis, the use of progestins in replacement therapy may reduce the risk of malignancy arising in endometriosis.\r"

In 2 of the 21 eyes, keratoplasty was a repeat operation because of graft rejection or graft dystrophy. With a mean follow-up of 22 months, visual rehabilitation was satisfactory: 15 patients (71%) achieved a postoperative corrected visual acuity of 6/12 or better. Postoperative deviation from preoperatively calculated refractive lens power--the only major problem--remained within +/- 2 dptr in 95% (20 eyes), with an error of + 4 dptr in 1 eye (5%). In all 21 eyes, clear corneal grafts were obtained. Thus we consider the triple procedure to be the treatment of choice in cataract patients with corneas opacities.\r"

We also evaluated the effect of study participation on compliance in the control group continuing to receive 0.5% timolol. In each treatment group, the IOP of approximately 30-40% of the patients was successfully controlled for the 3-month study period. The remaining patients did not exhibit significant pressure reductions and were dropped from the study within 2 weeks. We concluded that (1) the results of 'switch' studies without a control group must be interpreted carefully, and (2) the initiation of a 'new regimen' with an equieffective beta blocker may be sufficient to increase compliance and thereby control IOP.\r"

This provides a rationale for use of beta-blocker therapy in patients with cardiac myopathies of various etiologies. Postinfarction trials in patients with ischemic heart disease have suggested that beta blockade provides a substantial mortality benefit, and beta blockers are accepted as first-line therapy for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The use of beta-blocking drugs for dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), however, is currently investigational. Early trials reporting benefits in functional class, exercise capacity, and myocardial function stimulated further interest in this application of beta blockade. Recent studies comparing metoprolol with placebo or standard treatment have shown promising improvements in functional class and exercise capacity. The patients who will benefit most from beta-blocker therapy in DCM may be those with a high resting heart rate and a short duration of symptoms and, perhaps, feminine gender. Marked structural abnormality on cardiac biopsy (eg, fibrosis) may suggest a poor response to treatment. A multicenter controlled study of metoprolol in dilated cardiomyopathy is in progress. If the outcome is favorable, beta-blocker therapy in DCM may become an accepted, rather than an experimental, treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Ventricular arrhythmias can lead to sudden cardiac death (SCD), and they can be classified according to the risk they present. Lethal ventricular arrhythmias, the least common, present the highest risk for SCD and usually manifest as paroxysmal sustained ventricular tachycardia. Most of the patients have serious left ventricular dysfunction and important hemodynamic symptoms, which must be treated immediately. Potentially lethal arrhythmias are much more common, accounting for most SCD cases. The patients generally have coronary artery disease, and the ventricular arrhythmias usually do not cause hemodynamic symptoms. Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia are the usual forms. PVCs are classified as benign in the absence of coronary artery disease, structural heart disorders, and hemodynamic symptoms, and in these cases the risk for SCD is low. Beta blockers have been shown to reduce the SCD rate, and although the precise mechanism is unknown, the effect may be in part on an antiarrhythmic basis. Like the class IA and IB antiarrhythmic agents (the Vaughan Williams classification), beta blockers are effective in about 50% of patients with either potentially lethal or benign ventricular arrhythmias. However, compared with such agents, beta blockers have a more favorable side effects profile.\r"

Beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes are differentially distributed throughout the CNS and are probably differentially regulated. An effect of normal aging on beta receptors has been found in studies of both animal and human brain tissue. Preliminary studies relating to neuropsychiatric disorders in humans and animal studies on the action of antidepressants suggest that CNS beta receptors may play a critical role in affective disorders and their treatment. This may explain why beta-blocker medication is associated with side effects such as depression and lethargy, which are generally reversible when selective hydrophilic beta blockers are used or when the therapy is withdrawn.\r"

The study involved 114 hemodynamically stable patients with acute head injury who were randomized, double blind, to either placebo or atenolol given intravenously (10 mg every six hours) for three days and then orally (100 mg once a day) for four days. Both groups were equally stressed in terms of raised arterial norepinephrine levels. In patients receiving placebo, but not in those given atenolol, there was a significant (P less than 0.01) positive correlation between arterial level of norepinephrine and plasma level of cardiac-specific isoenzyme CK-MB. Thirty percent of the placebo group, in contrast to 7.4% of the atenolol group (P less than 0.05), had pathologically elevated CK-MB levels (ie, greater than 3% of total CK, a value compatible with acute myocardial infarction). Atenolol appeared to significantly reduce the likelihood of supraventricular tachycardia and ST-segment and T-wave changes and prevented cardiac necrosis (as determined post mortem). The finding that beta 1-selective blockade significantly inhibits catecholamine-induced necrosis has possible broad clinical implications.\r"

  ".W": "Catecholamine stimulation increases the heart rate and the force of cardiac contraction. Cardiac output then increases, with a decrease occurring in total peripheral resistance due to smooth muscle dilation in the vascular beds of the muscle and heart, though there is constriction of the skin and viscera; this leads to a net decrease in total peripheral resistance. Consequently, systolic pressure rises and diastolic pressure falls. The net effect is to increase myocardial oxygen demand. Smoking stimulates catecholamine secretion and may therefore be expected to have detrimental effects in patients with angina. In a double-blind study of ten patients with stable angina pectoris treated with nifedipine, propranolol, and atenolol, smoking was found to have direct and adverse effects on the heart and to interfere with the efficacy of all three antianginal drugs, but with that of nifedipine the most. Differences between the two beta blockers may be related, at least in part, to the known different metabolic pathways of these drugs.\r"

MVP is considered to be an anatomic entity with specific pathologic tissue characteristics and pathophysiologic consequences. The term \"MVP syndrome\" (MVPS) is used to refer to symptoms due to neuroendocrine or autonomic dysfunction that occur in patients with MVP and that cannot be explained on the basis of valvular abnormality alone. Several studies have shown that patients with MVPS have high urinary epinephrine and norepinephrine excretion, high plasma catecholamine concentrations, abnormal catecholamine response to volume expansion, and hyperresponse to adrenergic stimulation. In patients with MVPS and ventricular arrhythmias, the frequency of premature ventricular contractions parallels the urinary and plasma catecholamine values. The clinical presentation of MVPS may be related in part to high adrenergic tone and/or hyperresponse to adrenergic stimulation. Therefore, certain patients with MVPS and high adrenergic tone may benefit from beta blockade.\r"

Although a neurochemical basis for aggression in these cases is unclear, a hyperadrenergic state is considered to be one possibility. This has led to the hypothesis that beta blockers may be useful in the control of aggression. The original assumption was that the site of antiaggressive action of beta blockers is in the brain. However, the antiaggressive efficacy of nadolol, which does not cross the blood-brain barrier to any great extent, suggests a peripheral site or sites. A review of several studies in which both old and young aggressive patients with various organic brain disorders received propranolol showed that aggressive behavior was reduced in 75 (86%) of 87. These results are encouraging because none of the patients had responded to earlier drug treatment. However, with the exception of one study of nine patients, none of the studies were controlled for placebo effects and most were retrospective. Preliminary results suggest tentative guidelines for treatment of aggressive behavior with beta blockers. Further studies are needed, and these should use a prospective, longitudinal double-blind design; large enough patient samples to permit testing hypotheses about disease-specific or symptom-specific responses to beta blockers; and improved instruments for measuring and classifying aggression.\r"

In addition to receiving customary therapy, patients were randomly assigned to receive atenolol (61 patients) or placebo (59 patients). Outcome was assessed daily by the measurement of nine features in three categories: vital signs, clinical signs (eg, tremor), and behavioral signs (eg, agitation). Among patients who had withdrawal symptoms at baseline, vital signs became normal more rapidly in the patients receiving atenolol; abnormal behavior and clinical characteristics also resolved more rapidly. On each treatment day, significantly fewer patients receiving atenolol required concomitant oxazepam therapy for agitation. Patients receiving placebo, however, required a significantly higher mean daily dose of oxazepam. The results indicate that atenolol is helpful in the treatment of patients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome.\r"

The beta-adrenergic receptor has been divided into two general subtypes, and these have been purified to homogeneity. The beta 2-receptor gene has been cloned, and the primary structure of the beta 2 receptor has been deduced. Additionally, important details of the receptor-adenylate cyclase complex have been elucidated. Another general category of information relates to the unique features of the myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor population. These include (1) a relatively high proportion of beta 2 receptors and coupling of these receptors to muscle contraction; (2) the apparent lack of spare receptors; (3) selective down-regulation of the beta 1-receptor population in heart failure, with preservation of the beta 2 and alpha 1 populations; and (4) mediation of the most powerful inotropic stimulus that can be delivered by a receptor-coupled pathway. In the next 25 years, investigations will emphasize the use of molecular biologic techniques to discover crucial information about the control of beta-receptor structure and function. From this research will come both new pharmacologic agents and new applications of currently available agents.\r"

  ".U": "88157949\r", 
  ".W": "Severe myocardial ischemia and infarction cause release of catecholamines, with exposure of injured myocardial cells to relatively high concentrations during the transitional period in which myocyte injury worsens. In experimental animals, the number of beta-adrenergic receptors increases markedly without any change in affinity within one hour of coronary artery occlusion, and the number of alpha-adrenergic receptors also increases. Stimulation by exogenous cate-cholamines during a period of reperfusion one hour after temporary coronary occlusion is associated with an enhanced biochemical response in the ischemic myocardium. Administration of beta-adrenergic blockers prior to or within a few minutes after occlusion limits the extent of myocardial necrosis. In clinical studies, administration of propranolol, timolol, or metoprolol has been shown to significantly reduce the mortality rate after myocardial infarction (MI). Administration of timolol or metoprolol also reduces the frequency of recurrent MI. Beta-adrenergic blockers may prolong life and reduce the risk for recurrent MI by antagonizing and/or preventing basic biologic alterations in injured myocytes and/or by antagonizing detrimental effects of the relatively high concentrations of catecholamines to which these cells are exposed. Increased number of beta-adrenergic receptors, the ability to translate adrenergic stimulation into intracellular metabolic events, and increased local concentrations of catecholamines may be important factors in arrhythmogenesis and myocyte injury during severe myocardial ischemia and evolving MI.\r"

The two approaches thus far explored have used external parameters, such as counting days of work lost or changes in sexual function, and subjective assessment by patients, through completion of a questionnaire. The latter presents problems of reliability and sensitivity of the instrument as well as comparability of results across various studies. 2. Should quality of life be measured? If morbidity due to hypertension is reduced but quality of life is also reduced without an associated improvement in longevity, it is important to know exactly how and to what extent quality of life is impaired. Also, measurement of quality of life should make possible improved compliance with antihypertensive therapy. 3. How can quality of life be measured? Results of the studies evaluating quality of life associated with antihypertensive therapy leave much to be desired. A study protocol is proposed that would use the voluntary drop-out rate as the point of comparison. Research would then unravel the behavioral factors specifically affected by a given treatment. Through such studies, the effects of drugs on quality of life could become a criterion in individualization of treatment.\r"

After a washout period, 58 patients with essential hypertension received either 20 mg of enalapril or 50 mg of atenolol. After two weeks, the dosage was doubled (to 40 mg of enalapril and 100 mg of atenolol) in those patients with diastolic blood pressure higher than 95 mm Hg. After four weeks of active treatment and a second two-week washout period, patients received the alternative antihypertensive agent under the same procedure and time schedule as in the first treatment phase. Four patients dropped out. Side effects were evaluated by questionnaire at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 10. In the 54 patients who completed the study, enalapril and atenolol led to almost identical blood pressure reduction in both treatment phases, indicating that pooling these data is a sound method. However, incidence of side effects was twice as high in phase 1 as in phase 2 and markedly decreased in each treatment phase, with no differences being observed between enalapril and atenolol. These results clearly demonstrate that pooling side effects data from a cross-over study may lead to quite wrong interpretations.\r"

Endothelial injury at sites of coronary artery stenosis, platelet attachment, and release of humoral mediators, including thromboxane A2 and serotonin, may be major causes of primary reductions in coronary blood flow leading to unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction (MI). Findings of clinical studies are consistent with the hypothesis that platelet aggregation and subsequent increases in thromboxane and serotonin concentrations may play a role in causing acute MI, death, or both in patients with unstable angina. Animal studies suggest that both thromboxane and serotonin are important in initiating or sustaining the cyclic coronary blood flow reductions that occur after severe stenosis and endothelial injury. If the contribution from either of these humoral mediators is eliminated or antagonized, cyclic flow reductions are usually terminated. Beta blocker and/or thrombolytic therapy administered within the first two hours after onset of coronary artery occlusion may limit infarct size and improve segmental ventricular function. When given within six hours of symptoms of MI, thrombolytic therapy may reduce mortality.\r"

Furthermore, evidence is building to suggest that in many patient groups, silent ischemia relates to prognosis. Numerous therapies, including nitroglycerin or isosorbide dinitrate, have been shown to modify silent ischemia and its associated risks. Studies indicate that frequency and perhaps duration of silent ischemic episodes can be modified by treatment with beta-adrenergic blockers or calcium antagonists alone or, even more effectively, with a combination of both types of agent. Many ischemic episodes persist, however, when therapy is directed only at reduction of angina. Evidence suggests that some characteristics of silent ischemia predict prognosis, whereas angina characteristics do not. Until additional data about prognosis and the influence of treatment on prognosis are available, the appropriate focus seems to be improvement of outcome in those patients who are at highest risk, rather than only reduction of chest pain.\r"

In the late 1940s, Ahlquist conceptualized the alpha- and beta-blocking actions of catecholamines. Sir James Black's research in the 1950s led to the introduction of pronethalol and then of propranolol into the therapeutics of angina and arrhythmias. Early beta-receptor blocking compounds were noted not only to be competitive inhibitors of the beta receptor but to have a direct depressant, membrane-stabilizing action. Later compounds, such as pindolol, were noted to have partial agonist activity. Practolol, metoprolol, atenolol, and similar \"cardioselective\", or beta-selective, drugs were subsequently described. Agents that combine beta blockade with alpha blockade or vasodilator action have been developed recently. There are various therapeutically advantageous pharmacodynamic differences among the beta-blocking drugs, such as less effect of beta 1-selective drugs on bronchial smooth muscle. Lipid solubility, systemic bioavailability, first-pass liver metabolism, renal excretion, and brain penetration are pharmacokinetic properties that further distinguish one agent from another. After the initial predicted therapeutic uses, beta-blocking drugs were used in hypertension and subsequently have been applied in a wide range of cardiovascular conditions. Recent work clearly demonstrating a cardioprotective effect in the post-myocardial infarction period is a major reason that use of the agents is likely to remain high.\r"

To investigate whether this treatment confers clinical benefits, 28 trials have been conducted involving some 27,500 patients during the early hours after onset of symptoms suggesting acute myocardial infarction (MI). Patients were randomized to receive either initial intravenous beta blocker plus oral maintenance or standard therapy. In toto, these trials indicated that early-intervention short-term beta-blocker treatment reduces: (1) the risk for early death, reinfarction, and ventricular fibrillation by about 15%; (2) enzymatic indices of infarct size; (3) the number of patients with threatened MI in whom a confirmed MI develops; and (4) the frequency of repetitive and nonrepetitive ventricular arrhythmias. Overall, the treated group had few major side effects other than a small excess of reversible and nonfatal heart block and hypotension. Retrospective analyses suggest (but do not prove) that the reduction in mortality is greatest for those treated within two hours of pain and during the first two days. These results indicate that early initial administration of intravenous beta blocker plus one week's oral beta-blocker treatment produces modest benefits that would presumably be of major public health importance if such treatment were widely used.\r"

Some insights pertinent to this important question can be gained by reviewing the results of clinical trials with beta agonists and antagonists. Neither beta 1-selective (prenalterol) nor beta 2-selective (pirbuterol) agonists have been shown to be effective in treating heart failure in double-blind, placebo-controlled studies; moreover, research has indicated that prolonged stimulation of beta receptors with oral or intravenous catecholamines may adversely affect survival. In contrast, sustained therapy with drugs that attenuate the effects of the sympathetic nervous system (by blocking either tyrosine hydroxylase or beta-adrenergic receptors) may produce hemodynamic and clinical improvement and may favorably affect long-term prognosis. These potential benefits of beta-adrenergic blockade contrast strikingly with the lack of efficacy (with respect to clinical status and survival) of agents that block alpha-adrenergic receptors. Beta-adrenergic blockade carries important risks in the patient with heart failure, however. The risk-to-benefit ratio cannot be delineated accurately until the outcome of additional randomized clinical trials is known.\r"

We found that the low-affinity site araO2 is essential for araC autoregulation; araO1 and araI1 provide high-affinity AraC-binding sites, which allow cooperative binding at araO2. Profound effects on the araBAD promoter and the araC promoter are produced by ligand-induced changes in AraC occupancy of functional sites on the DNA. We suggest that AraC exerts its multiplicity of controls through two alternative states of cooperative interactions with DNA and we illustrate this with a model. This model presents our interpretations of activation and repression of the araBAD operon and the autoregulation of the araC gene.\r"

In mammals these two activities are found in a single, bifunctional protein called UMP synthase. A human T-lymphoblastic cell cDNA library constructed in lambda gt10 was screened with a UMP synthase-specific rat cDNA probe. Human UMP synthase cDNAs were isolated and then used to select UMP synthase gene fragments. The complete coding sequence of the mRNA for UMP synthase was determined by analysis of overlapping cDNA and genomic fragments. One of the cDNAs appears to have been synthesized from an incompletely or alternatively processed form of the UMP synthase mRNA. This cDNA lacks a poly(A) tail and has an extended 3'-nontranslated region that hybridizes with larger forms of the UMP synthase mRNA. The UMP synthase protein is composed of 480 amino acids with a molecular weight of 52,199. The two activities of UMP synthase reside in distinct domains encoded by the 3' and 5' halves of the mRNA. The COOH-terminal 258 amino acids of the human UMP synthase protein contain the orotidine-5'-monophosphate decarboxylase catalytic domain. This region is highly homologous to the mouse orotidine-5'-monophosphate decarboxylase sequence. The NH2-terminal 214 amino acids contain the OPRT domain. There is amino acid homology between this protein domain and specific regions of the Escherichia coli OPRT. The human OPRT domain also contains the putative catalytic site common to other human phosphoribosyltransferases.\r"

  ".W": "The mutation rate of Escherichia coli increases approximately 100-fold after treatment with replication-inhibiting agents such as UV light. This enhanced mutation rate requires the action of the UmuD and UmuC proteins, which are induced as part of the SOS response to DNA damage. To initiate a biochemical characterization of the role of these proteins, we have developed a plasmid system that gives efficient expression of the umuD and umuC genes. The umuD and umuC genes were placed under the control of a regulated phage lambda PL promoter and a synthetic ribosome-binding site, and the distance to the UmuD start was adjusted to maximize gene expression. Starting from this overproduction system, we have purified the UmuD protein and studied its interaction with RecA. The SOS response is turned on by the capacity of RecA protein to mediate cleavage of the LexA repressor for SOS-controlled operons. Others have shown that UmuD exhibits sequence homology to LexA around the cleavage site, suggesting a possible cleavage reaction for UmuD. We show that RecA mediates cleavage of UmuD, probably at this site. As with LexA, UmuD also undergoes a self-cleavage reaction. We infer that RecA-mediated cleavage of UmuD is another role for RecA in SOS mutagenesis, probably activating UmuD for its mutagenic function.\r"

Other genetic experiments are presented that (i) support the hypothesis that the primary role of Ser-60 in UmuD function is to act as a nucleophile in the RecA-mediated cleavage reaction and (ii) raise the possibility that RecA has a third role in UV mutagenesis besides mediating the cleavage of LexA and UmuD.\r"

A 2.1-kilobase insert was isolated that also hybridized to a 17-base mixed oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the amino-terminal sequence of the yeast dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase. The cDNA has a coding sequence of 499 amino acids that corresponds to a 21-residue signal peptide and a 478-residue mature protein (Mr = 51,558). Computer analysis shows that yeast dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase has about 41% amino acid identity with Escherichia coli dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase.

Transductional crosses placed the arcA gene near min O on the chromosomal map. Complementation tests showed that the arcA gene corresponded to the dye gene, which is also known as fexA, msp, seg, or sfrA because of various phenotypic properties [Bachmann, B. (1983) Microbiol.

Purified cell walls stimulated proliferation of T cells from tuberculoid, but not from lepromatous leprosy, patients and elicited delayed-type hypersensitivity skin reactions in guinea pigs and patients sensitized to M. leprae. Analysis of the precursor frequency of antigen-reactive human peripheral T cells revealed that as many cells (approximately equal to 1/6000) proliferate to antigen contained in cell walls as to intact M. leprae. Sequential removal of mycolates and arabinogalactan resulted in a large peptidoglycan-protein complex that retained all the immunological activity. This immunological reactivity and the inherent protein were destroyed by proteolysis. Thus, cell wall protein is a major contributor to cell-mediated immune reactivity to this pathogenic mycobacterium.\r"

Using a sensitive assay based on gene transfer and tumorigenesis, we sought evidence that damage to protooncogenes might figure in the progression from the chronic to the blast phase of CML. Seven of the 12 patients with CML examined in this manner harbored transforming genes. Mutations in RAS protooncogenes were detected in the leukemic cells from 1 of 6 chronic-phase patients, and 3 of 6 blast-crisis patients. In addition, a presently unidentified transforming gene (neither RAS nor RAF) was detected in 1 patient with chronic phase and 1 with blast crisis. Our data indicate that mutations in RAS genes may play diverse roles in the pathogenesis of CML.\r"

  ".W": "Human ovarian follicular fluid contains renin-like activity. In normal women, circulating levels of prorenin, the biosynthetic precursor of renin (EC 3.4.23.15), change in parallel with changes in progesterone during the menstrual cycle. Therefore, the ovary has been implicated as a source of plasma prorenin. In the present studies, we report the finding of high concentrations of prorenin in human ovarian follicular fluid (3000 ng.ml-1.hr-1 vs. 10-40 ng.ml-1.hr-1 in normal human plasma) obtained from follicles of women prepared for in vitro fertilization. The inactive renin-like enzyme was identified as prorenin by its activation characteristics, its molecular weight of 47,000, which is the same as that for recombinant prorenin, and its cross-reactivity with human renal renin antibodies. Culture of isolated human theca cells and isolated granulosa cells indicated that prorenin is secreted by theca cells but not by granulosa cells. Prorenin production by theca cells peaked during the first 10 days of culture and gradually decreased by 17 days. Active renin levels were 10% or less of the prorenin levels. Prorenin was barely detectable in medium from granulosa cells cultured for 24 days. Immunohistochemical staining of human ovaries (n = 5) with anti-human renin antibody demonstrated the presence of renin primarily in theca cells. These studies suggest that the theca cell is the source of the large quantities of prorenin in human ovarian follicular fluid.\r"

  ".W": "Spontaneous release of neurotransmitter has been demonstrated in various types of synapses. Its physiological significance, however, is still unknown. In nerve-muscle cultures of embryonic Xenopus laevis, we observed that acetylcholine, which is released spontaneously at the synaptic terminal, caused frequent twitches of muscle cells. These muscle cells developed cross-striations earlier than neighboring non-twitching cells. This effect of innervation was unaffected by tetrodotoxin but was blocked by alpha-bungarotoxin. Repeated iontophoretic application of acetylcholine or KCl to muscle cells caused twitches and also accelerated the formation of cross-striations. Thus twitching apparently promotes lateral alignment of myofibrils. It is also known that myosin synthesis is higher in twitching muscle cells. Therefore, successfully innervated twitching muscle cells may have an advantage for faster differentiation over neighboring non-twitching muscle cells. We suggest that spontaneously released transmitter may serve as a mediator for trophic interaction at forming synapses.\r"

The total-risk score was a sum of categorical risk scores. A between-group analysis of variance showed that the total-risk scores did not differ significantly by sex or race. Thirty percent of the infants we tested had total-risk scores greater than 7, which differed significantly from the 15% in the original Movement Assessment of Infants data. On 18 of the 65 Movement Assessment of Infants items, more than 15% of our study sample had risk scores that differed from Movement Assessment of Infants profile normative scores.

The sessions were repeated twice a week over a period of five weeks.

Parasympathetic tone was assessed 1) by quantifying the amplitude of the respiratory sinus arrhythmia from the heart rate pattern and 2) by measuring heart rate. Heart rate patterns were assessed during the pelvic lift and during the durational touch and baseline control conditions. Two groups of healthy subjects were tested: Group 1 contained 20 subjects aged 26 to 41 years, and Group 2 contained 10 subjects aged 55 to 68 years. In Group 1, the pelvic lift elicited a somatovisceral-parasympathetic reflex characterized by a significant increase in parasympathetic tone relative to durational touch and baseline conditions. Group 2 did not exhibit a parasympathetic change during the pelvic lift. The results of this study contribute to our understanding of pelvic mobilization techniques and may help to explain why these techniques have been clinically successful in treating myofascial pain syndromes and other musculoskeletal dysfunctions characterized by reduced parasympathetic tone and excessive sympathetic activity.\r"

The purpose of this study was to conduct a historical review of the number of geriatrics-related articles published in Physical Therapy. All articles indexed under \"geriatrics\" between January 1921 and June 1987 were identified and categorized in five-year time intervals to assess trends over time. Geriatrics-indexed articles generally appeared infrequently in the Journal, averaging one article every two years. All Physical Therapy articles published between January 1980 and June 1987 were read to determine whether they exhibited a geriatrics orientation. An average of six geriatrically oriented articles appeared in the Journal annually (about 5% of all articles annually). An increased number of geriatrics articles appeared in the Journal between 1980 and 1987. An imbalance clearly exists when an age group that comprises 25% of our patient population receives attention in only 5% of the Journal articles. As a profession, we must examine our attitudes toward and perceptions about elderly persons if we are to address their needs responsibly.\r"

The groin flap provided skin coverage, and the aponeurosis was rolled to form a tendon-like structure to replace the Achilles tendon. In group B, those patients with an additional calcaneus bone loss were treated with free iliac osteocutaneous flaps, together with the external oblique aponeurosis based on the deep circumflex iliac vessel. The iliac bone was then utilized to reconstruct the calcaneus defect. All composite free tissue transfers were successful, except in two group B patients who suffered partial skin loss. The advantages of this technique are (1) a single, one-stage procedure, (2) faster wound healing with fewer adhesions of the reconstructed Achilles tendon, and (3) good cosmesis and minimal morbidity at the donor site.\r"

No other abnormalities were present. Three days after a term delivery, an abdominal US examination again demonstrated multiple gallstones. When the infant was 6 weeks old, a follow-up abdominal US study showed no evidence of gallstones. This case, as well as one previously reported, demonstrates that findings typical of gallstones may be seen in the fetus, and that these structures may spontaneously resolve.\r"

The normal median and ulnar nerves in the upper extremity and the normal sciatic and external popliteal nerves in the lower extremity were seen, all having an echogenic fibrillar echotexture. Pathologic findings included nine cases of benign tumor (four schwannomas, three neurofibromas, two traumatic neuromas), one of neurilemmitis, and one of tuberculoid leprosy. All lesions were hypoechoic. Three of the four schwannomas had well-defined contours, and two were associated with a typical distal sound enhancement. Neurofibromas and traumatic neuromas were less sharply delineated. Inflammatory conditions were characterized by a hypoechoic, thickened nerve. US was effective in imaging nerve masses in the extremities, and large normal nerves can now be demonstrated with high-resolution US.\r"

Twelve patients with proved glomus tumors of the fingers were examined with high-resolution real-time ultrasound (US). US depicted the tumor preoperatively in nine patients (75%). All detected tumors were hypoechoic on US scans. The smallest tumor detected was 3 mm in diameter. A limitation of US is in the detection of small, flattened subungual lesions. These preliminary observations indicate that US imaging with high-frequency transducers is useful in both the diagnosis and the preoperative three-dimensional localization of glomus tumors.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred carotid bifurcations in young asymptomatic volunteers were examined with color Doppler flow imaging in an attempt to determine the frequency, configuration, magnitude, and duration of flow reversal. Areas of flow reversal were identified in all but one bifurcation. Just proximal to the bifurcation, flow reversal was typically located peripherally, opposite the origin of the external carotid artery. Distal to the bifurcation, flow reversal in the internal carotid artery typically assumed a linear configuration in the center of the vessel, extending from the superficial to the deep wall. Variations of these patterns were common. On the average, flow reversal occupied 33% of the lumen of the carotid bulb and extended for a distance of 14 mm. The average duration of flow reversal was 22% of the total cardiac cycle, with reversal typically occurring at peak systole and being replaced by static blood during diastole. These findings indicate that flow reversal in the carotid bifurcation is a normal phenomenon with a variable configuration, magnitude, and duration.\r"

Eleven patients had CT confirmation of a CNS recurrence; in eight patients, the recurrent tumor was in a different location than the original lesion.

The relative distributions of each US sign in proliferative and secretory endometrium were compared. Despite complicating extrinsic factors such as uterine leiomyomas and intrinsic factors such as the transition period between endometrial phases, US staging of the endometrium is a useful diagnostic technique that allows serial examinations of the endometrium.\r"

In phase 1, ultrasonographic (US) scanning was performed after review of abdominal radiographs and renal tomograms in 30 patients who had undergone extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL). In this group the sensitivity of US for detecting stones was 98%. In phase 2, scanning was performed in 30 post-ESWL patients without prior review of radiographs or tomograms. The sensitivity of US for stone detection in this group was 95%. In phase 3, sonography was performed in a blinded fashion on a random mix of post-ESWL patients and patients who had undergone urography for reasons unrelated to nephrolithiasis. The sensitivity of US for stone detection in this group of 40 patients was 91%. The overall sensitivity in all three groups was 96%, which was superior to the performance of abdominal radiography and slightly inferior to the combination of abdominal radiography and renal tomography. The ability to detect kidney stones with US depended on stone size but was independent of stone location or patient size. The study findings suggest that US is an effective means for detecting kidney stones in patients with suspected nephrolithiasis.\r"

Although this can be achieved at two to three days after coronary occlusion by histologic techniques, a variety of technologies including two-dimensional echo, CTT, SPECT, PET, and NMR have demonstrated potential for providing noninvasive quantitative measurements of the extent of myocardial infarction. Additional studies are needed to clarify the utility of these technologies for resolving the highly variable transmural distribution of infarction that is present in the clinical setting. Assessment of the region at risk for infarction, the ischemic zone, requires quantitative measurements of the degree of ischemia as well as the size of the ischemic region. Although the above technologies may provide quantitative measurements of the dimensions of the ischemic zone, the utility for resolving the highly variable transmural distribution of regional myocardial blood flow using clinically applicable methodologies has not been convincingly established at present. It is possible that cine CT, new generation PET, and NMR technologies may eventually provide noninvasive quantitative measurements of regional myocardial blood flow.\r"

On the opposite ends of this spectrum are ofloxacin, which is almost entirely eliminated by the kidney as unmodified drug, and pefloxacin, which undergoes extensive biotransformation. Dosage adjustments in patients with renal insufficiency therefore are recommended for ofloxacin, but, on the basis of currently available data, adjustments do not appear to be required for pefloxacin. Both renal clearance of unmodified drug and metabolic transformation contribute substantially to the elimination of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Because of the great antimicrobial potency of the new fluoroquinolones, it should be possible to employ them in the treatment of urinary tract infections caused by highly susceptible bacteria even in patients with marked impairment of renal function.\r"

Several animal models have been used to compare the efficacies of quinolones with those of standard therapies against selected bacterial pathogens. In animal models of endocarditis, pefloxacin, enoxacin, and ciprofloxacin have been shown to be equivalent to standard therapies against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and as effective as vancomycin against methicillin-resistant strains. Difloxacillin has been shown to be equivalent to vancomycin in a model of osteomyelitis due to S. aureus. Ciprofloxacin is as effective as the combination of ceftazidime and tobramycin in a model of pseudomonal meningitis, although the levels of ciprofloxacin (6 mg/L) in serum required to produce a bactericidal effect in the cerebrospinal fluid are higher than those usually obtained in humans. Ciprofloxacin and other quinolones are also effective therapy for pseudomonal infections in neutropenic animals with pneumonia, peritonitis, osteomyelitis, and endocarditis. Data obtained from these animal studies suggest that the quinolones may have an important role in the treatment of endocarditis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, and other serious infections in humans caused by S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\r"

The reported interactions of new quinolones are due to a decrease in antimicrobial activity at low pH, a Mg++-dependent reduction in efficacy, and a probenecid-induced decrease in tubular secretion of ciprofloxacin. The reduction of theophylline clearance by those quinolones that are metabolized primarily in the liver (enoxacin and ciprofloxacin) is of clinical relevance; also, the interactions of quinolones with Mg++-containing antacids, which result in tremendous loss of bioavailability, are of therapeutic importance.\r"

For many of the quinolone agents, increased antibacterial potency correlates with increased potency in inhibiting the essential bacterial enzyme DNA gyrase. Studies with mutants resistant to drug action have identified the A subunit of this enzyme as a drug target. Other drug-resistance mutations are associated with pleiotropic drug resistance and decreased amounts of porin outer-membrane proteins and appear to involve alterations in permeability of the bacterium to the drug. Structure-activity studies of a large number of quinolone analogs have identified the importance to drug action of substituents at positions 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7 of the quinolone ring. Uncertainties remain, however, about the details of the molecular interactions of quinolones, DNA gyrase, and DNA and about the specific events that lead to quinolone-mediated bacterial killing.\r"

In immature animals all quinolones studied cause arthropathies of the major diarthrodial joints. Arthropathies have also developed in adult dogs after 12 months of pefloxacin treatment. At high doses the quinolones exert effects on renal function that are related to a foreign-body reaction caused by crystals; nephropathologic changes seem not to occur without crystalluria. In humans quinolones can have various CNS effects. The subcellular \"substrate\" for these effects is unknown. Further understanding of severe CNS reactions (confusion, hallucination, anxiety, agitation, nightmares, convulsive seizures, and depression) is needed. Pefloxacin causes cataracts in dogs after treatment for 8-12 months. Low-dose quinolones (administered as an intravenous bolus) cause pronounced but transient systolic hypotension in dogs and cats; cardiovascular effects may be mediated by histamine release. Quinolones inhibit the bacterial enzyme DNA gyrase. To exclude the possibility of damage to mammalian DNA, mutagenicity studies have been performed. Since all but two tests (which may give false-positive results) have been negative, quinolones appear to be nonmutagenic. Photosensitivity has occurred in humans given quinolones. Drug interactions can be clinically important.\r"

Comparative trials of single-dose regimens have, however, been limited. A few randomized, comparative trials have shown that in complicated UTI norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin were at least as effective as amoxicillin and TMP-SMZ and usually more effective than pipemidic acid. Moreover, preliminary results indicate that fluoroquinolones might be effective for the oral treatment of complicated UTI that are difficult to treat, especially those due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Comparative trials are needed to establish the value of fluoroquinolones for chronic bacterial prostatitis. There are no conclusive data on fluoroquinolone treatment of UTI in patients with renal failure. Emergence of resistant pathogens during therapy with fluoroquinolones has been infrequent but might be more frequent in complicated UTI caused by P. aeruginosa.\r"

Their pharmacologic properties and their availability for oral administration make them the drugs of choice in the treatment of such chronic infections. Pefloxacin and ciprofloxacin are the principal quinolones that have been evaluated with respect to the treatment of bone and joint infections. In the literature cited the mean rates of bacteriologic and clinical response among patients treated with pefloxacin and ciprofloxacin were 87.6% and 73%, respectively, whereas failure of therapy were due to the persistence of the causative organisms (5% and 15% of the cases, respectively) or to the emergence of resistant mutant strains (15% and 12% of the cases, respectively). Development of resistance to the quinolones--especially in staphylococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia, Enterobacter species, and Klebsiella pneumoniae--is a problem that can be reduced by the intelligent use of these potent agents in spite of the ease of their administration. Therapy that combines new quinolones with other antibiotics should prevent the emergence of resistant mutants, but this hypothesis has to be assessed in large studies.\r"

This review article summarizes the published data concerning these studies. The results show that the oropharyngeal flora is only slightly or not at all affected by the quinolones. All new quinolones have a similar effect on the normal intestinal flora. The gram-negative aerobic flora is strongly suppressed during administration of quinolones, while the gram-positive flora is only slightly affected. The anaerobic microflora is almost not at all affected by the administration. The emergence of resistant bacterial strains is uncommon, although one investigation showed increased MIC values for anaerobes during ciprofloxacin administration. Replacement by yeasts or other inherently resistant microorganisms does not often seem to be a problem. High concentrations of the new quinolones are reached in feces; values between 100 and 2,200 mg/kg are reported. Since the new quinolones do not cause marked ecologic disturbances in the intestinal microflora, they may be suitable for selective decontamination in immunocompromised patients and for treatment of bacterial intestinal infections.\r"

  ".W": "Increasing antimicrobial resistance of enteric pathogens represents a significant barrier to therapy for bacterial enteritis and, to a lesser extent, typhoid fever. Poor study design limits the value of many of the clinical trials that suggest drug efficacy. Studies are often not placebo-controlled, randomized, or blind comparative trials; clinical criteria for response are frequently not stated; and the numbers of subjects are small. Among the known therapeutic principles for choosing drugs for enteric infections is that the agent be active in vitro against the isolate, that for treating infections due to invasive pathogens both lumenal and tissue levels be adequate, that drugs with good enterohepatic circulation may be especially well suited for the treatment of infections due to noninvasive pathogens, and that drugs active intracellularly may have particular value in therapy for typhoid, especially in reducing the relapse rate. The new 4-quinolones are not only highly active in vitro against a broad range of enteric pathogens but generally also exhibit most of the other properties desirable for the treatment of these infections. Although further clinical trials are necessary to assess the comparative efficacy of the quinolones, the present clinical data already indicate that they will be of great utility, and particularly important in the treatment of drug-resistant shigellosis, which is currently a major problem in many developing nations in Asia and Africa.\r"

  ".W": "The evolutionary route followed in the development of the new generations of 4-quinolone antibacterial agents, from the precursor of nalidixic acid to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin (and beyond), is characterized by a paramount role for serendipity. All of the high-technology features such as fluorination, the presence of a piperazine ring at position 7, and the stereoisomerism of the molecule, represent only the combination of characteristics incorporated in earlier generations of nalidixic acid analogues. Although almost unprecedented levels of potency per mole have been attained along with effective broad-spectrum antibacterial activity and acceptable pharmacokinetic properties, all developments have been made and are being made in the absence of a proper knowledge of how these agents work against susceptible bacteria. The absence of this knowledge, along with our almost total ignorance of how the antibacterial activity relates to possible effects in Homo sapiens, is at present a barrier to the rational development of truly optimized 4-quinolones.\r"

These compounds can be successfully used in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis but do not seem superior to older drugs; moreover, bacteriologic persistence and even treatment failures in infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae can be a problem. Because of the poor activity of fluoroquinolones against S. pneumoniae, these compounds do not appear to be the first choice in the empiric treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. Ciprofloxacin is apparently valuable for the treatment of pseudomonas infections in patients with cystic fibrosis: clinical results seem comparable to those obtained with conventional intravenous treatments. More clinical experience is needed to compare the role of fluoroquinolones with that of beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics in the treatment of nosocomial gram-negative pneumonia.\r"

They are effective in animal models of systemic infections, with activity comparable to that of current antimicrobial regimens. Their use to date in systemic infections in humans has not been extensive, but results in the treatment of severe infections, including bacteremia, osteomyelitis, and pneumonia have been encouraging. The few comparative studies that have been undertaken confirm the efficacy of these agents. The limited experience with these drugs in the treatment of infection in the immunosuppressed host is largely favorable. Emergence of resistance, although demonstrable in vitro, does not appear to pose a clinical problem, although addition of a second agent may be advantageous. These drugs appear to be well tolerated, with gastrointestinal disturbance being the most commonly reported adverse effect.\r"

The concentrations of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin in tonsillar tissue and the concentrations of ofloxacin in the mucosa of the paranasal sinuses generally exceeded the peak concentrations of these agents in serum after oral administration of the drugs. Good penetration was noted for ciprofloxacin into nasal secretions, ofloxacin into tears, and various quinolones into saliva. Penetration into ocular humors appears to be moderate. Reports in English concerning clinical trials of the new fluoroquinolones in the treatment of infections of the eyes, ears, nose, and throat are sparse, but a number of studies of ofloxacin have been published in Japanese. The data suggest that the new quinolones may be useful for the treatment of acute sinusitis and chronic suppurative otitis media. However, studies comparing these agents with more established drugs and using carefully defined criteria for diagnosis and for evaluation of the response to treatment are needed.\r"

Pefloxacin has been found to penetrate well into the CSF of patients with normal or inflamed meninges as well as into brain tissue. Ciprofloxacin also penetrates into CSF, although not as well as pefloxacin. Two patients with meningitis due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been reported to have recovered after treatment with ciprofloxacin. Because of the spectrum limitations of quinolones, especially with regard to anaerobes and gram-positive aerobic cocci, these agents should not be considered for empiric use in CNS infections. They may, however, become alternatives in the rare cases of CNS infection caused by organisms resistant to other antibiotics.\r"

Overall rates of adverse reactions were 4.0%-8.0%, and adverse reactions necessitated discontinuation of therapy in 1.0%-2.6% of patients. Patterns of organ-system involvement and of signs and symptoms were quite similar, with gastrointestinal effects predominating (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain in 1.0%-5.0% of the patients), followed by effects on the central nervous system (dizziness, headache, and/or insomnia in 0.1%-0.3% of the patients) and skin (0.5%-2.2% of the patients). Elevation in levels of hepatic enzymes occurred in 1.8%-2.5% of the patients, azotemia in 0.2%-1.3%, and eosinophilia in 0.2%-2.0%. These adverse effects were reversible after drug withdrawal and were generally not dose-dependent. Within the constraints of the relatively small number of well-documented patients and the unique mechanism of action of these antimicrobial agents, the safety profile of these drugs seems to make them acceptable for use when their administration is well directed and specific. In addition, close surveillance for new phenomena should be maintained.\r"

  ".W": "Fluoroquinolones inhibit bacteria by interacting with the A subunit of DNA gyrase. Resistance to older agents such as nalidixic acid was due to mutations in the gyrA gene. Resistance to the new fluoroquinolones (e.g., norfloxacin, enoxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, and ciprofloxacin) as a consequence of spontaneous single-step mutation occurs at a low frequency, less than 10(-9), and generally results in a 300-fold lower level of resistance than does the mutation to nalidixic acid resistance. High-level resistance to quinolones can be produced by serial exposure of bacteria to subinhibitory concentrations. Cross-resistance to all quinolones usually occurs. High-level resistance appears to be due to alterations in the A subunit of DNA gyrase and in a simultaneous alteration in permeability that probably is related to a loss of outer-membrane proteins. Organisms resistant to the new quinolones may also be resistant to other antibiotic classes, including beta-lactams. Clinical resistance to the new quinolones has been uncommon and has occurred most often among respiratory pathogens, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa from patients with cystic fibrosis and, less frequently, among strains of Serratia marcescens, P. aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus from wound infections. Resistance of urinary or diarrheal isolates has been rare. So far, overall resistance of bacteria to quinolones has not emerged as a major problem, but--like resistance to all other antimicrobial classes--does occur in certain clinical settings.\r"

MICs of these drugs for Enterobacteriaceae correlate with those of nalidixic acid, but resistance to the quinolones is rare if a breakpoint of greater than 2 mg/L is accepted. Most intestinal pathogens are sensitive. Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other Pseudomonas species except Pseudomonas maltophilia are usually sensitive. Ciprofloxacin is generally the most active of the 4-quinolones against these organisms. All of the new agents have antistaphylococcal activity, but that of norfloxacin and ofloxacin is borderline. Against streptococci, including enterococci and pneumococci, the drugs' activity is moderate or poor. Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis are very sensitive. Gonococci and meningococci are also highly sensitive to the new agents, but activity against Chlamydia trachomatis and the mycoplasmas is borderline. The organisms associated with nonspecific vaginal infection are not very sensitive. Anaerobes except Bacteroides ureolyticus and Clostridium perfringens are mostly resistant.\r"

Cytidines or uridines are added to C5 to generate chain lengths of 10 to 11 nucleotides, with longer products being generated at greatly reduced efficiency. The reaction is analogous to that catalyzed by a replicase with C5 acting as the primer, GpNs as the nucleoside triphosphates, and a sequence in the ribozyme providing a template. The demonstration that an RNA enzyme can catalyze net elongation of an RNA primer supports theories of prebiotic RNA self-replication.\r"

We reviewed 16 cases of PCD treated during the past 15 years; 11 of the patients were male, and the average age of all the patients was 59 years. Malignant disease was the most common underlying condition (seven patients). Venous gangrene (VG) was present in seven extremities. Three treatment methods were used alone or in combination--intravenous heparin, venous thrombectomy, and thrombolytic therapy. Heparin was used initially in 13 patients; it yielded a successful result in seven (53%) patients, none of whom had VG. Venous thrombectomy was done in six patients; in three it was the primary procedure, in two it followed failure of heparin, and in one it followed failure of both heparin and thrombolytic therapy. Venous thrombectomy was successful in three (50%) patients, one of whom had early VG. Thrombolytic therapy was used on one occasion in conjunction with both heparin and venous thrombectomy, without benefit. Five patients died, all with VG, three after heparin only, one after heparin and venous thrombectomy, and one after all three treatment methods. Review of the 38 cases reported in the recent literature shows comparable results. These data suggest that nongangrenous forms of PCD respond well to systemic anticoagulation. Combination therapy using venous thrombectomy and heparin is indicated for severe ischemia, early VG, or failure of PCD to improve after six to 12 hours of heparin therapy. Phlegmasia cerulea dolens with VG is the lethal form of the entity and responds poorly to established therapy. Future therapeutic trials need to consider aggressive use of thrombolysis with or without thrombectomy.\r"

Seasonal variation in the recovery of NGAS from symptomatic children was suggested by higher relative and absolute recovery rates of NGAS during warm weather.

Parents of children from low pre-beta-lipoprotein groups had elevated alpha- and lower pre-beta-lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Parents whose children had high beta-lipoprotein cholesterol levels also had high serum total and beta-lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Parents of children with high levels of both beta- and pre-beta-lipoprotein cholesterol had a high prevalence of both abnormal risk factor levels, as well as clinical evidence of early coronary artery disease (before age 50 years). These observations show that parents of children with high beta- and/or pre-beta-lipoprotein cholesterol levels have greatly enhanced risk for cardiovascular disease, and children mirror their parents' lipoprotein cholesterol levels. These observations emphasize the need for cardiovascular risk evaluation early in life, especially in high-risk families.\r"

  ".W": "The history of the peroxisomal disorders (PDs), including the most frequent variant, the cerebrohepatorenal syndrome of Zellweger, can be divided into four phases. During the first phase, lasting from 1964 to 1972, the clinical and pathologic manifestations of Zellweger's syndrome (ZS) were explored and delineated. In 1973 it was found that ZS is due to the absence of peroxisomes in hepatocytes and renal tubular epithelial cells. With this discovery the second phase of ZS was initiated, which in subsequent years led to discovery of various defective peroxisomal functions. During the third phase, beginning in 1980, various other peroxisomal disorders were discovered, among them infantile Refsum's disease, hyperpipecolic acidemia, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, and rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata. During 1986 the etiology of the various PDs was identified by complementation studies, marking the beginning of the fourth phase of the history of the peroxisomopathies. It was found that ZS, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, and rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata represent different genetic entities, while Refsum's disease and hyperpipecolic acidemia are alleviated variants of ZS. Moreover, results of preliminary studies indicate that cells of one case of ZS may complement the cells of another ZS case, which could indicate genetic heterogeneity of ZS.\r"

The new automated instruments such as the Coulter S+ series offer \"state of the art\" precision and accuracy in counting more than 10,000 cells per blood sample. The nonoptical electronic impedance method yields RBC, WBC, and platelet data, as well as histograms that characterize hematologic data. Analysis of more than 3,500 cases yielded a false-negative rate of less than 4% and a false-positive rate of 30%, indicating the instrument's accuracy in recognizing and flagging abnormalities. All normal screened CBCs were free of significant abnormalities. The Coulter S+ series provides innovative parameters and histograms that aid in establishing differential diagnoses. We review the advantages and the limitations of automation. Morphologic examination of abnormal blood smears remains the cornerstone of diagnosis in both the new and the old hematology.\r"

With modern scanners, the procedure is rapid and efficient and suitable for the most severely ill and infirm. The scans are easily interpretable, and the anatomic and morphologic depiction of disease is readily understood by those with surgical training. Information regarding the state of the bowel wall, mesentery, and intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal structures is displayed in greater detail than by any other diagnostic imaging modality. The use of intravenous contrast medium is rarely essential. The concentration of iodinated contrast needed for opacification of the bowel is no greater than 2 per cent to 5 per cent and will not complicate bowel surgery, as would standard upper gastrointestinal or barium enema studies. Abscess, free air, calcium, and intraperitoneal fluid are very sensitively detected. CT is extremely useful in aiding surgical decision making in the acute abdomen and is complementary to or has replaced conventional studies.\r"

CT scanning also evaluates the retroperitoneal organs and retroperitoneal hematoma more accurately than any other available imaging technique. Like any other diagnostic tool, the CT scan must not be overused or abused. This technique should be applied only to stable patients and only in institutions with up-to-date equipment, a committed radiology and surgery staff, and appropriate monitoring equipment in the CT suite. If proper technique is used, then high-quality scans can be obtained which, if interpreted by experienced personnel in the light of the clinical findings, can improve our management of selected trauma patients.\r"

Acute colonic diverticulitis occurs in approximately 25 per cent of the patients with diverticula, and 20 per cent of the patients with diverticulitis will ultimately require surgical intervention. Because of the often virulent nature of the disease in younger patients and the prevalence in the geriatric population, an aggressive approach is advocated. Primary resection of the involved segment of colon is advocated in all cases requiring operation. A primary anastomosis can be constructed in stage I and some cases of stage II disease. This results in lower morbidity and mortality rates as well as fewer days of hospitalization and disability. Newer techniques such as diagnostic CT scanning, percutaneous drainage of diverticular abscess, and greater application of surgical stapling devices have done much to improve the ultimate outcome of colonic diverticulitis.\r"

Each group has specific abdominal conditions, and the clinician must be familiar with the specific causes of the acute abdomen within each subset. The causes of the acute abdomen in immunocompromised patients may be divided into two broad categories: (1) those disorders that are closely associated with the immunocompromised state and (2) those processes that can occur in any patient regardless of the immune status. Physicians at every level of specialization must become familiar with the unusual complications that occur in this population and with the ways in which the underlying disease and its therapy can modify the clinical presentation and management of common abdominal conditions. This article outlines broad principles of common clinical findings and surgical therapy in these patients.\r"

Pathologic conditions reported to develop during pregnancy include central serous chorioretinopathy, hypertensive and vascular disorders, and uveal melanoma. Pregnancy also can affect pre-existing ocular conditions, such as diabetic retinopathy, tumors, and a variety of immunological disorders and can have beneficial effects on such pre-existing conditions as glaucoma. This review covers ocular disorders in these three categories, and summarizes the systemic changes of pregnancy and the effects of ocular medications on the fetus.\r"

Uveal melanoma is an uncommon cancer with an incidence of only six cases per million population per year. It is most often diagnosed in the sixth decade and is somewhat more common in males. Apart from sporadic reports of family clusters, uveal melanoma is not considered an inherited disease. Whether some environmental exposure triggers the development of uveal melanoma remains an open question. Sunlight has been proposed as an environmental risk factor because sunlight is known to cause melanoma of the skin and both diseases are rare in nonwhite races. Unlike cutaneous melanoma, however, rates have not been increasing over time and do not vary by latitude. This paper evaluates the available evidence for sunlight and other potential risk factors for uveal melanoma, highlighting areas requiring further research.\r"

  ".W": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) involves a progressive impairment of the outer layers in the center of the retina. Experimental studies have demonstrated that bright light preferentially damages precisely the region that degenerates in AMD. The evidence that solar radiation is responsible for some of the deteriorative changes that lead to AMD is examined in this review. In the primate eye, the high-energy portion of the solar spectrum is most hazardous to retinal molecules, with damaging effects increasing as photon energy rises. This action spectrum is explicable by the quantum laws which describe the interaction of radiation with matter. High-energy visible and ultraviolet photons can produce molecular damage by a photochemical mechanism. The lesion is exacerbated by oxygen, which initiates free-radical chain reactions (photodynamic effects). Melanin exerts a protective effect against damage from sunlight. In the human retina, documented lesions from solar radiation range from the acute effects of sun-gazing to injuries resulting from prolonged periods of exposure in brightly illuminated environments. The damage occurs in the same region that degenerates in AMD. A cataractous lens and ocular melanin both protect the retina against AMD, as predicted by the radiation hypothesis. Identification of an environmental factor that evidently plays a role in the etiology of AMD provides the basis for a program of preventive medicine.\r"

A gas bubble is injected into the vitreous cavity and the patient positioned so that the bubble closes the retinal break, permitting resorption of subretinal fluid. A chorioretinal adhesion formed around the break secures the retina in place. The history of pneumatic retinopexy is presented as well as recent studies on the subject. Characteristics of intraocular gases are reviewed. A protocol is described for pneumatic repair of complex retinal detachments. Patient selection and surgical techniques are recommended. Pneumatic retinopexy is compared to other retinal reattachment techniques and controversial issues are discussed.\r"

The Lewis antibodies presumably were produced in the course of rejection of the first graft and had an effect on the success of the second graft. As indirect evidence, Lewis mismatching would be expected to occur more frequently in black patients than white, and correspondingly, a lower graft survival rate was noted in black patients receiving sibling, parent, and cadaver donor grafts.\r"

  ".W": "In summary, I have attempted to review with you some of Dr Starzl's numerous clinical and scientific contributions that have cut across the spectrum of the field of renal transplantation. It is thus not surprising that Dr Starzl was elected the first President of the American Society of Transplant Surgeons, singular recognition from his own peers for the many contributions and leadership that he has provided during the formative and developmental years of organ transplantation. In addition, Dr Starzl has been recognized with a number of other prestigious awards, among which was the David M. Hume Memorial Award, the highest honor bestowed by the National Kidney Foundation. Careful analysis of Dr Starzl's work therefore clearly indicates that many of his contributions since 1960 have been uniquely innovative, have provided many firsts, and have reflected the science and technology of transplantation as it is today, in 1987. Thus, it can be truly said that Dr Starzl, the surgeon-scientist, was not only a pioneer but also a leader and subsequently a giant in the field of clinical renal transplantation. He has left a lasting and indelible impact on the field, the Starzl influence, for which all of us, both patient and physician, are extremely grateful. Thank you very much, Dr Starzl.\r"

The long-term overall results in hepatic transplantation for irresectable tumors are disappointing in spite of good short-term palliation in most of the patients. Tumor recurrence is the rule. But individual long-living patients demonstrate the potentials of this treatment. Thus the crucial question will be a proper selection of patients. The relative suitability (in descending order of favorableness) of the kinds of tumors may range from HCC without cirrhosis, to central bile duct tumors, to HCC in cirrhosis, to CCC, and finally to secondaries. But this range can only give some probability for the success rate. More important is the tumor stage. Survival in lymph node-positive stages is by far worse than in lymph node-negative stages. The 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year actuarial survival data in our experience for lymph node-negative (lymph node-positive) HCC without cirrhosis are 83%, 75%, 75% (33%, 11%, 11%); in bile duct carcinomas in lymph node-negative stages (lymph node-positive) they are 6 months, 100% (40%); 1 year, 100% (13%); and 2 years, 83% (0%). Hepatic transplantation for selected tumor patients furthermore seems justified and is essential for a detailed analysis of the chance of different tumor types for success with this method of treatment.\r"

Sixty female Landrace pigs were used for 30 OLTs. Group 1 livers underwent PP, whereas group 2 livers were treated with PAP. The cold ischemic time was less than 120 minutes for both groups, with no warm ischemia. Intraoperative and 24-hour postoperative biochemical, coagulation, and histocytological data were analyzed. Morphological studies of cellular damage were based on the percentage of CVD and KP and classified as light, moderate, and severe damage. Data, at closing, were compared by using Fisher's test (group 1 v group 2,P = 0.003 for light damage and P = .04 for severe damage; first postoperative day for group 1 v group 2, P = .133 for light damage and P = .25 for severe damage. Blood samples at closing and 24 hours postoperatively showed significant differences between groups 1 and 2: At closing for groups 1 and 2, respectively: AST, 968.9 +/- 742.7 and 327.4 +/- 174.7 IU/L (P less than .001); ALT, 63.1 +/- 40.3 and 20.3 +/- 5.3 IU/L (P less than .001); AP, 292.2 +/- 107.1 and 139.5 +/- 45.3 IU/L (P less than .001); and 24 hours postoperatively for groups 1 and 2, respectively: AST, 1,664.9 +/- 917.8 and 419.3 +/- 230.9 IU/L (P less than .001): ALT. 180.4 +/- 28.9 and 66.4 +/- 17.5 IU/L (P less than .001); AP, 602.1 +/- 153.3 and 255.7 +/- 116.3 IU/L (P less than .01). Comprehensively, the results reflect a better perfusate distribution of the PAP livers compared with PP ones: uniform organ preservation, faster metabolic recovery, and reduced postoperative mortality.\r"

Significant bleeding episodes are not uncommon during the first five days postoperatively when platelet counts are low. This thrombocytopenia may be the result of platelet sequestration in the newly grafted liver. The sequestration phenomenon does not appear to be on the basis of antiplatelet antibody activity. Further work defining the time course of this organ sequestration and evaluating the possible release of previously sequestered platelets back into the circulation need to be done. Also, it may be productive to study medications known to inhibit platelet activation (ie, cyclooxygenase inhibitors, prostacyclin, and calcium channel blockers) with the intent of interrupting platelet adhesiveness-sequestration at the time of recirculation of the newly grafted liver.\r"

The only child who has significant symptoms is an 11-year-old heart-lung transplant recipient who developed airway rejection with restrictive pulmonary function 14 months after transplantation. Rejection continues to be a major threat to these children more than a year removed from their transplantation procedure. Until a satisfactory noninvasive method is developed to monitor graft rejection, endomyocardial biopsies will continue to be performed at 6-month intervals. Cyclosporine nephrotoxicity and systemic hypertension remain important and unresolved problems that could limit the initial success of transplantation. We believe that heart transplantation is an acceptable option for children with end-stage heart and heart-lung disease who have a grim outlook. Future improvements in immune suppression, and the development of improved methods of assessing rejection, will allow for improved survival.\r"

Therapeutic regimens were as follows: after complete transurethral resection of all visible tumors, BCG RIVM (1 x 10(9) bacilli in 50 mL saline) was instilled once a week for six consecutive weeks, and mitomycin C (30 mg in 50 mL saline) was administered once a week for one month (weeks 1 to 4) and thereafter once a month for a total of six months. Reported are the incidence of side effects in 165 patients and the recurrence rate of tumors in 308 patients after a follow-up period of twelve months. Drug-induced, or chemical cystitis was observed in 13 (16.7%) of 78 BCG-treated patients and in 12 (13.8%) of 87 MMC-treated patients. In the same groups bacterial cystitis occurred in 17 (21.8%) patients and in 16 (18.4%) patients, respectively. In the BCG-treated group (N = 148), 44 (29.8%) had recurrent tumors, while in the MMC-treated group (N = 160), 40 (25.0%) had a recurrence. The recurrence rate for BCG-treated patients was 0.33; the recurrence rate for MMC-treated patients was 0.29 (P = 0.560, not significant). These preliminary data demonstrated no statistically significant difference between the two arms with regard to toxicity and recurrence of tumors.\r"

Infarct size was estimated from maximal LD1 isoenzyme levels, and the diagnosis confirmed by CK-MB determination. Thrombolytic therapy was started within 1 hour of pain onset in 11 patients (group A), between 1 and 2 hours in 10 (group B), and later than 2 hours in eight patients (group C). Marked differences appeared between the groups. Thus, three patients in group A and one patient in group B did not develop infarction, all had critical LAD stenoses. Three patients in group C died in shock without bleeding. Further, the average maximal LD1 values in the 22 patients who survived their infarction differed significantly between the groups, and were 12.6, 19.1 and 36.2 mu kat/l in groups A, B and C, respectively. In conclusion, very early intravenous streptokinase infusion probably reduces myocardial necrosis, and possible prevents infarction in some patients.\r"

The 24-hour heart rate was significantly reduced by all regimens, and the Holter-monitoring pattern indicated the presence of ISA-effect at least 20 hours after the 300-mg dose. Maximal heart rate and blood pressure were significantly reduced and exercise duration increased during a symptom-limited bicycle exercise test on 200 and 300 mg, but not on 100 mg daily. Resting heart rate and blood pressure were uninfluenced on all regimens. ICI 141.292 is an effective agent in patients with severe angina pectoris.

Insulin treatment was successfully stopped in 15 of our 22 patients who satisfied the inclusion criteria for the study and were selected on the basis of a computer file including practically all diabetic patients treated with insulin in the Kuopio University Central Hospital region (population base 250,000 inhabitants). Insulin therapy was restarted in seven patients during the first 3 months after discharge. During the following 9 months insulin therapy was restarted in another three patients so that after a 1-year follow-up period half of the diabetic patients whose insulin therapy was stopped had been switched back to insulin. Insulin therapy was seldom successfully stopped if the postglucagon C-peptide value was under the limit of 1.0 nmol/l. Glycaemic control did not change during the follow-up, although there was a significant weight loss in diabetic patients. No changes were observed in serum lipids or lipoproteins with the exception of LDL cholesterol, which showed a significant reduction during the 3-month follow-up. In conclusion, insulin therapy can often be successfully stopped in patients with postglucagon C-peptide over the limit of 1.0 nmol/l without worsening of glycaemic control and without unfavourable changes in serum lipid and lipoprotein levels.\r"

  ".W": "Studies were performed in 10 male patients with untreated essential hypertension, WHO grade I-II, aged 25-62 years, to explore the acute (single dose) and long-term (8 weeks) effects of felodipine on sympathetic activity--evaluated by plasma and urinary catecholamines--as related to blood pressure, heart rate and the activity in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The patients were hospitalized for 8 (acute) and 6 (long-term) days and were maintained on a standardized daily intake of sodium (150 mmol), potassium (75 mmol) and water (2,500 ml). Acute felodipine administration (10 mg) significantly reduced blood pressure and increased heart rate. Plasma and urinary noradrenaline, plasma renin activity and angiotensin II increased, whereas plasma and urinary adrenaline, dopamine, aldosterone and plasma vasopressin were unaltered. Long-term felodipine treatment, 10 mg twice daily, reduced blood pressure to a similar extent as acute felodipine administration, but heart rate was not significantly changed. Plasma noradrenaline 3 and 12 hours after the last dose and urinary noradrenaline were increased, whereas plasma and urinary adrenaline and dopamine were unchanged. Plasma renin activity and angiotensin II were increased 3 hours, but unchanged 12 hours after the last dose. Plasma aldosterone was unchanged but urinary aldosterone increased. Plasma vasopressin was unchanged. The changes in plasma noradrenaline as related to blood pressure, heart rate, plasma renin activity and angiotensin II during long-term felodipine treatment may reflect decreased cardiac and renal beta-adrenoceptor-mediated responses. Increased renal clearance of aldosterone could partly explain the unaltered plasma aldosterone level in spite of increased plasma angiotensin II following long-term felodipine treatment.\r"

The remaining 18 were randomized into two treatment modalities, captopril and moderate dietary salt reduction, and captopril and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily. Following a wash-out period the groups crossed over to the alternative treatment. At the end of the control period the average blood pressure was 151/100 +/- 12/6 mmHg recumbent and 140/91 +/- 11/7 standing, following captopril 144/94 +/- 13/5 and 132/92 +/- 12/6, respectively, with low salt diet added to captopril 140/91 +/- 12/6 and 128/89 +/- 11/6 and with hydrochlorothiazide and captopril 133/86 +/- 12/7 and 120/84 +/- 11/7 mmHg supine and erect, respectively.

Thermogenesis was significantly lower in the metoprolol group compared with both the hypertensives given (p less than 0.05), and a normotensive group without treatment (p less than 0.005). Metoprolol also provoked a significant fall in body temperature in comparison with the two other groups (p less than 0.01). In the hypertensives given placebo, heat production was inversely related to plasma adrenaline (r = -0.89), indicating a role of the sympatho-adrenal system in muscle thermogenesis. No such correlation appeared during metoprolol treatment. In the present acute stress situation it is suggested that muscle thermogenesis was decreased indirectly by metoprolol via blockade of beta 1-receptors in adipose tissue, causing a relative inhibition of lipolysis with diminished substrate supply to the muscles.\r"

Blood glucose levels during a somatostatin (100 micrograms X h-1)-insulin (0.4 mU X kg-1 X min-1)-glucose (4.5 mg X kg-1)-infusion test (SIGIT) performed between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. served as an indicator of total body insulin resistance. Plasma epinephrine, growth hormone, and cortisol increased in response to hypoglycemia, while blunted responses of glucagon were simultaneously registered. At the start of the subsequent SIGIT, blood glucose and plasma-free insulin concentrations were similar to those obtained in the control study without preceding hypoglycemia, and at this point all counter-regulatory hormones had returned to basal. During the SIGIT close to identical levels of plasma-free insulin and counter-regulatory hormones were registered, despite which a significant hyperglycemia was seen 2 hours after the start of the SIGIT when preceded by hypoglycemia. In a separate study, the SIGIT was shown to have a good reproducibility in IDDM patients. We conclude that hypoglycemia evokes a state of insulin resistance for several hours, as demonstrated by elevated blood glucose levels during a somatostatin-insulin-glucose-infusion test.\r"

The patients participated in two experiments in which hypoglycemia at 4 a.m. was induced by i.v. insulin (1.5 mU/kg/min). In both experiments the endogenous secretion of GH was suppressed by somatostatin (250 micrograms/h) and glucagon (0.5 ng/kg/min) was given as substitute for the somatostatin-induced suppression of endogenous glucagon secretion. GH (20 mU/kg/h) or saline was given for 60 min from nadir blood glucose in random order. Mean nadir glucose values were the same in both studies (1.7 +/- 0.2 vs. 1.7 +/- 0.1 mmol/l) and no differences were registered in plasma-free insulin, glucagon and the responses of adrenaline and cortisol to hypoglycemia. The infusion of GH resulted in plasma GH levels of about 50 micrograms/l at the end of the infusion, thereafter decreasing to low or immeasurable levels within 2 hours. Infusion of GH evoked a marked hyperglycemia within 4 hours. It is concluded that when hypoglycemia is accompanied by a transient increase in plasma GH, insulin resistance occurs after a lag period of approximately 4 hours and that this effect persists for at least another 4 hours.\r"

The Simplate technique for measuring skin bleeding time was adapted to quantify by radioimmunoassay PGI2 and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) in the emerging blood, as the stable degradation products 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha) and thromboxane B2 (TXB2), both of which were measured in venous plasma as well as in serum (clotted at 37 degrees C for 1 h). During bleeding, when platelets aggregate to occlude the injured vessels, the median TXB2 level in the emerging bleeding time blood was 1.7 ng/ml. The median TXB2 level in plasma was less than 1 ng/ml and in serum 275 ng/ml. The levels of immunoreactive 6-keto-PGF1 alpha were always below determination limit in bleeding time blood (0.2 ng/ml) and in plasma (0.1 ng/ml), whereas in serum the levels ranged between 0.26 and 0.47 ng/ml. The fact that enhanced PGI2 production in primary haemostasis in skin incisions could not be demonstrated calls for further investigations of possible PGI2 production with more sensitive assays or in injured large vessels.\r"

  ".W": "During the last few years streptococcal infections have been reported in connection with various cutaneous manifestations with severe or fatal outcome. A 62-year-old female with chronic interstitial nephritis was admitted with progression of confluent bullous lesions on her right leg. She had contracted a superficial scratch on her right foot 2 days prior to admission. Within 16 hours she deteriorated rapidly with symptoms on sepsis. Blood cultures and cutaneous swabs disclosed growth of beta-haemolytic streptococci group A. In spite of correct penicillin treatment she died 28 hours after admission. Skin biopsies from her right leg showed severe necrosis. This report is a reminder that new, cutaneous manifestations of streptococcal disease are still emerging.\r"
