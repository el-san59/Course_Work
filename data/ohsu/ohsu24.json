  ".W": "The defensive factors that prevent the human duodenal mucosa from acidic and peptic damage have not been fully evaluated. To determine whether duodenal mucosal bicarbonate production was altered in patients with inactive duodenal ulcer, we measured basal and acid-stimulated bicarbonate output from the duodenal bulb and the distal duodenum in healthy subjects and patients with inactive duodenal ulcer. As compared with 16 normal subjects, the 12 patients had significantly less mean (+/- SE) basal proximal duodenal mucosal bicarbonate secretion (185 +/- 13 vs. 107 +/- 18 mumol per centimeter per hour; P less than 0.001). Moreover, in response to a physiologic amount of hydrochloric acid (2 mmol per five minutes) instilled directly into the duodenal bulb, peak proximal duodenal bicarbonate output in the patients was 41 percent of the normal response (263 +/- 65 vs. 642 +/- 77 mumol per centimeter per hour; P less than 0.01). There was little overlap between groups. In contrast, bicarbonate outputs in the distal duodenum were similar in the two groups. We conclude that most patients with duodenal ulcer disease have decreased proximal duodenal mucosal bicarbonate production at rest, in response to hydrochloric acid, and in relation to peak gastric acid secretion. Impaired proximal duodenal mucosal bicarbonate secretion may be an important factor in the development and natural history of duodenal ulcer.\r"

  ".W": "Our study of cesarean rates in 19 industrialized countries of Europe, North America, and the Pacific revealed sharp differences in rates, ranging from a low of 5 (Czechoslovakia) to a high of 18 (United States) per 100 hospital deliveries in 1981. Differences in cesarean rates according to maternal age, parity, and complications of pregnancy and childbirth reflected national differences in obstetrical practice. For example, the percentage of mothers who had a vaginal birth after a previous cesarean section was only 5 in the United States as compared with 43 in Norway, where the cesarean rate was half that in the United States. Despite the wide range of cesarean rates, almost all the countries studied have had consistent increases over the past decade, and the annual rate of increase for all countries appears to be converging. The steady pace of increase in developed countries, combined with comparable or even higher rates of cesarean delivery now being reported in less developed countries, underscores the need for the medical community to consider the appropriateness of this continued rise in the number of cesarean deliveries.\r"

  ".W": "We describe an outbreak of acute rheumatic fever that occurred in the intermountain area centered in Salt Lake City, Utah. Seventy-four children meeting the modified Jones criteria for the diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever were evaluated by the staff at Primary Children's Medical Center, Salt Lake City, from January 1985 through June 1986. This represents an eightfold increase over the average annual incidence at this hospital during the past decade. Carditis, a dominant feature of the outbreak, was confirmed by auscultation in 53 of the patients (72 percent). An additional 14 patients were found to have mitral regurgitation by Doppler ultrasound examination, raising the total incidence of carditis to 91 percent. The children were predominantly from white (96 percent) middle-class families with above-average incomes and with ready access to medical care. There was no apparent increase in the incidence of streptococcal disease or other explanation for the marked increase in acute rheumatic fever. However, mucoid M type 18 and M type 3 group A streptococcal strains were isolated from several siblings of the patients and from schoolchildren (chosen at random) in the area. We conclude that acute rheumatic fever remains an important health problem in the United States.\r"

  ".W": "In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 518 infants and children who had otitis media with effusion (\"secretory\" otitis media), we evaluated the efficacy of a two-week course of amoxicillin (40 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) with and without a four-week course of an oral decongestant-antihistamine combination. Among the 474 subjects who were evaluated at the four-week end point, the rate of resolution of middle-ear effusion was twice as high in those treated with amoxicillin, either with or without the decongestant-antihistamine, as in those who received placebo (P less than 0.001), but 69.8 percent of the amoxicillin-treated subjects still had effusion. Among both the amoxicillin-treated subjects and the placebo-treated subjects, resolution was more likely in those with initially unilateral effusion, in those who had had effusion for eight weeks or less, and in those without an upper respiratory tract infection at the four-week end point. Side effects were reported more often in subjects who received decongestant-antihistamine than in those who did not. Among the subjects without effusion at the four-week end point, recurrent effusion developed in approximately half those in both the amoxicillin and placebo groups during the subsequent three months. We conclude that in infants and children with otitis media with effusion, amoxicillin treatment increases to some extent the likelihood of resolution.\r"

We studied the synthesis and intracellular processing of sucrase-isomaltase, using human intestinal explants in organ culture. Pulse-chase experiments with [35S]methionine followed by immunoprecipitation, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, and fluorography of labeled sucrase-isomaltase demonstrated that the molecule was initially recognized as a protein with a relative molecular weight (Mr) of 205,000. This was apparently converted to a species of 225,000 Mr within two hours. We studied the glycosylation of the protein using endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H and peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl)-asparagine amidase digestion of oligosaccharide side chains of the two forms of sucrase-isomaltase. The results showed that the early-appearing 205-kd (kilodalton) molecule contained high-mannose asparagine-linked oligosaccharides, and that the later-appearing, 225-kd molecule contained highly processed (mature) carbohydrate chains. Studies in a patient with primary sucrase-isomaltase deficiency demonstrated normal translation and high-mannose glycosylation of the precursor but a failure in further processing of the oligosaccharides, with subsequent intracellular degradation of the glycoprotein and undetectable enzymatic activity of intestinal sucrase. Abnormal intracellular processing of the enzyme was the probable mechanism of enzyme deficiency in this patient.\r"

Only 24 meta-analyses (28 percent) addressed all six areas, 31 (36 percent) addressed five, 25 (29 percent) addressed four, 5 (6 percent) addressed three, and 1 (1 percent) addressed two. Of the 23 individual items, between 1 and 14 were addressed satisfactorily (mean +/- SD, 7.7 +/- 2.7).

  ".W": "We evaluated the risk of unprovoked seizures after febrile convulsions and the factors prognostic of them in a cohort of 687 children who had an initial febrile seizure while residing in Rochester, Minnesota. Overall, children with febrile convulsions had a fivefold excess of unprovoked seizures, and the risk until the age of 25 was 7 percent. The risk ranged from 2.4 percent among children with simple febrile convulsions to 6 to 8 percent among children with a single complex feature--i.e., focal or prolonged seizures or repeated episodes of febrile convulsions with the same illness. For children with any two of the complex features, the risk was 17 to 22 percent, and for those with all three features, 49 percent. The occurrence of subsequent partial unprovoked seizures was strongly associated with all three of the complex features, whereas the occurrence of subsequent unprovoked seizures of generalized onset was associated with the number of febrile convulsions and a family history of unprovoked seizures. These results are consistent with the view that the increased risk of generalized-onset unprovoked seizures reflects a predisposition to both simple febrile convulsions and generalized-onset unprovoked seizures. The association between complex febrile convulsions and partial seizures, on the other hand, may reflect either a causal association or the presence of preexisting brain disease that is responsible for both the complex febrile seizures and later partial seizures.\r"

To study which blood-cell lineages are affected by the monosomy, we used chromosome 7-specific DNA probes in Southern blotting experiments on DNA derived from specific cell fractions isolated from the blood of five patients. As judged by the presence or absence of two different alleles for restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms, lymphocytes of all five patients were shown to have two different chromosomes 7. Granulocytes were affected by the chromosomal abnormality in four patients (No. 1, 2, 4, and 5) and unaffected in one (No. 3). Chemotaxis was normal in Patient 3 and impaired in Patients 4 and 5. Monocytes were affected by the monosomy in two of three patients (No. 2 and 3) and mainly unaffected in one (No. 1). Thus, the granulocytes and monocytes were affected differently in different patients. We conclude that mature blood cells are derived from abnormal progenitors and that there may be heterogeneity in the involvement of different cell lineages in different patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. There is an association between DNA loss and functional impairment.\r"

To evaluate the mechanism of action of these drugs, we studied six consecutive patients with chronic ITP treated with danazol and one treated with vinblastine. All the patients responded clinically without a notable change in the level of platelet-associated IgG. Instead, the clinical response to therapy was associated with a decrease in the number of monocyte binding sites for monomeric IgG (Fc receptors). In one patient, clinical relapse was associated with a spontaneous 2.7-fold increase in the number of monocyte Fc (IgG) receptors, without a change in the level of platelet-associated immunoglobulin. A decrease in the number of monocyte Fc (IgG) receptors following vinblastine infusion was associated with a clinical remission. We conclude that the clinical course of ITP may be influenced by the expression of monocyte or macrophage Fc (IgG) receptors. Danazol and vinblastine may mediate their clinical effect, at least in part, by influencing the number of available Fc (IgG) receptors on phagocytic cells.\r"

We investigated the possibility that the high cytosolic calcium concentration may be caused by a circulating plasma factor, by incubating platelets from normotensive subjects with plasma ultrafiltrates from patients with essential hypertension. The cytosolic calcium concentration in normal platelets increased after incubation with plasma from patients with untreated hypertension (80 +/- 15 percent [+/- SEM]) or from patients in whom hypertension was well controlled by calcium-influx blockers (129 +/- 33 percent). In contrast, the cytosolic calcium concentration was unchanged after incubation with plasma from normotensive subjects. When platelets from the patients were incubated with plasma from the controls, cytosolic calcium in platelets decreased by more than 30 percent, into the normal range (P less than 0.01). These data demonstrate that plasma from patients with essential hypertension contains a substance that increases the cytosolic calcium concentration in platelets. Cytosolic calcium is a trigger for vascular smooth-muscle-cell contraction, and if the plasma factor acts on these cells as it acts on platelets, it may be responsible for the increased peripheral vascular resistance associated with hypertension.\r"

In 60 percent of all cases the patient's mother had received diethylstilbestrol during pregnancy. An additional 12 percent of all mothers had been treated with another hormone or with an unidentified medication. Ninety-one percent of the cases in diethylstilbestrol-exposed women were diagnosed when the patient was between the ages of 15 and 27. The median age at diagnosis was 19.0 years. The risk that clear-cell adenocarcinoma will develop in an exposed female from birth through age 34 is 1 case per 1000 women. The temporal pattern of occurrence of clear-cell adenocarcinoma corresponds closely with that of the use of diethylstilbestrol for pregnancy support in the United States. The rarity of this tumor among exposed women suggests that diethylstilbestrol is not a complete carcinogen and that some other factor is also involved in the pathogenesis of clear-cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina and cervix.\r"

Cross-matched blood was ordered for 1287 patients (26 percent), and of these, 590 (46 percent) were considered eligible for predepositing blood. Only 5 percent (32) of the eligible patients actually predeposited blood, indicating that predonation is not widely used. Of those who predeposited, only 13 percent (4 of 32) subsequently received homologous blood, as compared with 36 percent (199 of 558) of those who did not predeposit (P less than 0.01). Among the 199 patients who did not predeposit but required transfusion, we estimate that predonation could have avoided homologous transfusion in as many as 68 percent. If all eligible patients had predeposited autologous blood, they could have supplied as much as 72 percent of their own transfused red cells. The blood for as much as 10 percent of all red-cell transfusions could have been predonated by and transfused into the patients undergoing elective surgery. Greater use of predonation would not only reduce the demand on the blood supply by decreasing the need for homologous transfusion, but would probably also reduce the risk of hepatitis and other transfusion-associated illnesses.\r"

Among animals, such an advantage of one hemisphere (lateralization) in processing communication sound from other members of the species has so far been demonstrated only in macaque monkeys. I report here that in the house mouse, which has a very much less elaborate forebrain than man or macaque monkey, the ultrasonic calls that are emitted by young mice to evoke maternal caring behavior are preferentially recognized by the left hemisphere. In females with no experience of pups, which have been trained to respond to the same ultrasonic calls by conditioning, no advantage for one hemisphere is detected. The results suggest that lateralization of this function evolved early in mammals and emphasize that an innate predisposition for perceiving communication sounds is connected with a left-hemisphere advantage in processing them. This experimental system is a readily-available animal model for studying lateralized auditory brain functions.\r"

It is probably triggered by agents, such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), thought to be released from tissues adjacent to proliferating capillaries. As well as being a potent inducer of cell division in capillary endothelial cells in vitro, bFGF can act as an angiogenic agent in vivo. It is present in a wide variety of richly vascularized tissues including brain, pituitary, retina, adrenal gland, kidney, corpus luteum, placenta and various tumours. So far, however, the normal bFGF-producing cell species in these tissues have not been identified. We report here that capillary endothelial cells express the bFGF gene, that they produce and release bFGF and that bFGF derived from them can stimulate the proliferation of capillary endothelial cells. We conclude that bFGF can act as a self-stimulating growth factor for capillary endothelial cells, and that it is possible that the formation of new capillaries is induced by capillary endothelial cells themselves.\r"

Trypanosomes ingested by the fly undergo a number of changes in the insect midgut during differentiation to procyclic forms. These include the loss of the variant specific glycoprotein (VSG) coat and the appearance of a common set of procyclic surface antigens. In order to investigate genes other than VSG genes which are expressed only at certain stages of the life cycle, the first cDNA specific to procyclic culture form trypanosomes (equivalent to the stage found in the insect midgut) has been characterized. The encoded polypeptide shows several characteristics of membrane proteins, but its most striking feature is the presence of a repetitive amino-acid sequence in which there are 22 tandem repeats of the dipeptide-Glu-Pro-. Related genes are also found in other trypanosome species and in leishmania. This gene shows many similarities to a number of surface antigen genes described in malaria and, more recently, Trypanosoma cruzi. This is the first example of a repetitive sequence in a parasite protein which is present only in the insect vector, and which therefore cannot be implicated in the mammalian host immune response.\r"

The notion of moisture sensitivity of proteins is not universally true. Barnacle cement (which can adhere to Teflon) and mussel and clam byssus, all of which are 99% protein, set in the presence of water and resist enzymatic as well as chemical degradation at ambient temperature. This observation suggests that proteins that are capable of tight three-dimensional cross-linking can overcome sensitivity to moisture and enzymatic attack. It should then be possible to achieve similar resistance by appropriate chemical manipulation of proteins, leading to cross-linking. We have achieved such a result with an ordinary protein, commercially available gelatin, which was chemically modified and then epoxidized. When cured such a material binds to metals and plastics. Any protein that has modifiable amino acids can be used for this purpose.\r"

However, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate this sliding among the nine doublets of the cylindrical axoneme to produce the coordinated planar bending waves required for efficient sperm propulsion. We have investigated these mechanisms with a new procedure in which the sperm head is held in the tip of a vibrating micropipette. Data obtained by gradually rotating the plane of imposed vibration around the sperm axis indicate that the pattern of active sliding between the outer doublet tubules can rotate relative to the sperm head, and suggest that this active sliding is regulated in part by the central tubule complex.\r"

These disorders include xeroderma pigmentosum, ataxia-telangiectasia, Fanconi's anaemia and Bloom's syndrome. Cells from individuals with Bloom's syndrome usually grow slowly in culture and exhibit increased chromosomal breakage and rearrangement, an elevated frequency of sister chromatid exchanges, retarded rates of progression of DNA replication forks, delayed conversion of replication intermediates to high-molecular-weight DNA, and slightly increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. Several of these features are also characteristic of Escherichia coli and yeast mutants with a defective DNA ligase. In this investigation we show that one of the two DNA ligases of human cells, ligase I, is defective in a representative lymphoid cell line of Bloom's syndrome origin.\r"

DNA ligases and DNA polymerases have long been prime candidates for abnormality in Bloom's syndrome, but various studies of DNA polymerases in Bloom's syndrome cells have disclosed no abnormalities. Evidence is presented here, as in the accompanying paper from a different laboratory, for the existence in Bloom's syndrome of an abnormality of the DNA ligase involved in semi-conservative DNA replication.\r"

  ".W": "Diacylglycerol (DG) plays a central role in phospholipid metabolism and is an endogenous activator of protein kinase C. We have suggested that constitutive activation of this kinase is one mechanism by which oncogenes transform cells. The ras-encoded proteins are similar to regulatory G-proteins and are candidates for the unknown G-protein that modulates phosphatidylinositol (PI) turnover. Differences in polyphosphoinositide metabolism have been reported for ras-transformed cells. But because these experiments were performed on confluent cultures of established cell lines, the differences are difficult to attribute to ras transformation. Here we show that exponentially growing NIH 3T3 fibroblasts recently transformed by Ha-ras or Ki-ras possess elevated DG concentrations without significant alterations in the levels of other polyphosphoinositide metabolites. The basal phosphorylation of protein kinase C substrate of relative molecular mass (Mr) 80,000 (80K) is significantly increased in all the ras-transformed cell lines. Surprisingly, however, further phosphorylation of this protein on addition of phorbol ester was greatly reduced. Ha-ras cells also show less binding of phorbol ester than control cells, suggesting that elevation of DG causes partial down-regulation in addition to activation of protein kinase C.\r"

Because transient increases in both intracellular [Ca2+] and actin polymerization accompany the cellular response to certain stimuli, it has been suggested that gelsolin regulates the reversible assembly of actin filaments that accompanies such cellular activations. But other evidence suggests that these activities do not need increased cytoplasmic [Ca2+] and that once actin-gelsolin complexes form in the presence of Ca2+ in vitro, removal of free Ca2+ causes dissociation of only one of two bound actin monomers from gelsolin and the resultant binary complexes cannot sever actin filaments. The finding that cellular gelsolin-actin complexes can be dissociated suggests that a Ca2+-independent regulation of gelsolin also occurs. Here we show that, like the dissociation of profilin-actin complexes, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, which undergoes rapid turnover during cell stimulation, strongly inhibits the actin filament-severing properties of gelsolin, inhibits less strongly the nucleating ability of this protein and restores the potential for filament-severing activity to gelsolin-actin complexes.\r"

  ".W": "Glucocorticoids, a class of steroid hormones, associate specifically with intracellular receptors, facilitating a conformational change that converts the receptor in vitro to a DNA-binding protein and in vivo to a nuclear species that activates a class of transcriptional enhancers termed glucocorticoid response elements (GREs). The DNA sequences recognized specifically by the hormone-receptor complex correspond directly to those required for GRE enhancement. The structural transition that accompanies steroid binding, 'receptor transformation', has been monitored by changes in receptor chromatographic properties, accessibility to monoclonal antibodies, association with other receptor subunits or with heterologous proteins, and aqueous two-phase partition coefficient. However, the significance of the structural change for the biological activity of the receptor is not understood. We have used cloned rat glucocorticoid-receptor coding sequences to produce and characterize a novel class of receptor mutants that elicit GRE enhancer function in transfected cells even in the absence of hormone. The constitutive activity of those receptor derivatives, together with mapping studies that distinguish between the DNA- and hormone-binding domains of the receptor, imply that the conformational change corresponding to receptor transformation may simply unmask pre-existing functional domains for DNA binding, enhancer activation, or both.\r"

  ".W": "Genetic analysis of eukaryotic transcriptional promoters has revealed that protein-coding genes often contain a complex array of cis-control elements consisting of upstream activator sequences and enhancer elements. The metallothionein genes provide a useful example for dissecting the action of multiple interspersed control elements that govern both basal level and regulated expression in animal cells. The human metallothionein (hMTIIA) promoter has been analysed in detail and found to contain no less than five distinct control elements in the 5' flanking regions of the gene that mediate specificity and regulation of transcription. These different control elements can be functionally subdivided into two categories: basal and induced elements. There are several distinct basal recognition sequences, which include a TATA-box, a GC-box, and at least two basal level enhancer (BLE) sequences, that function like classical enhancer elements. The hMTIIA gene also responds to induction by heavy metals and by steroid hormones through the action of metal regulatory elements (MRE) and glucocorticoid responsive elements (GRE). Here we report the identification of two cellular DNA-binding proteins that interact selectively with sequences governing the basal level expression of hMTIIA. One of these factors is a novel activator protein (AP1) that interacts with sequences in the BLE of hMTIIA and also binds to a site within the 72-base pair (bp) repeats of the simian virus 40 (SV40) enhancer region. The second protein has been purified to homogeneity and shown to be transcription factor Sp1 which recognizes and binds to a single GC-box element within the hMTIIA promoter.\r"

  ".U": "87115813\r", 
  ".W": "In recent years, a number of authors have suggested several geometric principles for the design of nature reserves based upon the hypothesis that nature reserves are analogous to land-bridge islands. Land-bridge islands are islands that were formerly connected to the mainland and were created by a rise in the level of the ocean. Land-bridge islands are considered supersaturated with species in that the ratio of island to mainland species numbers is higher than expected from the area of the island. As a result, the rate of extinction should exceed the rate of colonization on a land-bridge island, resulting in a loss of species that is suggested to be related to the size and degree of isolation of the island. If nature reserves are considered to be similar to land-bridge islands, because most are slowly becoming isolated from their surroundings by habitat disturbance outside the reserves, several predictions follow. First, the total number of extinctions should exceed the total number of colonizations within a reverse; second, the number of extinctions should be inversely related to reserve size; and third, the number of extinctions should be directly related to reserve age. I report here that the natural post-establishment loss of mammalian species in 14 western North American national parks is consistent with these predictions of the land-bridge island hypothesis and that all but the largest western North American national parks are too small to retain an intact mammalian fauna.\r"

In TIT FOR TAT the player cooperates on the first move and thereafter does whatever the opponent did on the previous move. I have studied the behaviour of fish when confronting a potential predator, because conflicts can arise within pairs of fish in these circumstances which I argue resemble a series of games of Prisoner's Dilemma. Using a system of mirrors, single three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) approaching a live predator were provided with either a simulated cooperating companion or a simulated defecting one. In both cases the test fish behaved according to TIT FOR TAT supporting the hypothesis that cooperation can evolve among egoists.\r"

Exogenously applied dopamine modifies several aspects of horizontal cell activity in the intact retina, including the responsiveness of these neurons to light and the strength of electrical coupling between them. We have used whole-cell voltage clamp methods to examine whether dopamine can alter the light-responsiveness of horizontal cells by changing their sensitivity to the neurotransmitter released by the photoreceptors. We report that dopamine and cyclic AMP, although having little direct effect on resting membrane conductance, greatly enhance ionic conductances gated by kainate, an agonist of the transmitter released by the photoreceptors, and by L-glutamate, the agent proposed to be the photoreceptor transmitter. Our results provide the first direct evidence for dopaminergic regulation of excitatory amino-acid neurotransmission in the vertebrate nervous system and suggest a possible mechanism to explain the reduction in the responsiveness of horizontal cells observed when retinas are treated with dopamine.\r"

Spectral sensitivities of 'green' and 'red' cones, determined over the entire visible region, show peaks near 530 and 560 nm respectively, and are remarkably similar to those of the old-world monkey Macaca fascicularis. They satisfactorily predict the photopic luminosity function, a measure of the sensitivity of cone-mediated human vision to light of different wavelengths. The kinetics of the light responses of human cones also appeared similar to those of macaque cones: the time to peak response to a dim flash was 50-100 ms and there was a characteristic undershoot during recovery.\r"

Several mechanisms for pHi regulation in different tissues have been found, such as direct proton pumping, Na/H exchange, Cl/HCO3 exchange, NaHCO3 cotransport, and Na/H/Cl/HCO3 obligatorily linked. All these studies have used either single cells or cell populations assumed to be behaving homogeneously. Most tissues consist of more than one cell type, so it would be desirable to examine pHi regulation simultaneously in many identified individual cells, particularly in epithelia where disaggregation and purification of isolated cells destroys the normal distinction between luminal and serosal environments. We have used a pH-sensitive fluorescent dye, BCECF (2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein) and digital image processing to study pHi regulation simultaneously in the oxyntic cells (OC) and chief cells (CC) of gastric glands isolated from rabbit stomach. CCs become markedly more acidic upon removal of external Na (Nao), but pHi is restored rapidly on return to normal Nao, with or without Cl. Oxyntic cell pHi is much less affected by Nao. Conversely, OCs become strongly more alkaline on removal of external Cl (Clo), pHi being restored when Clo is replaced with or without Na, whereas CCs are relatively insensitive to Clo. Therefore, Na/H exchange is dominant over Cl/HCO3 exchange in CCs, but in the neighbouring OCs, Cl/HCO3 outweighs the Na/H mechanism, a heterogeneity that correlates with the functions of the two cell types.\r"

Suppression of Na+/H+ exchange either by removal of extracellular Na+ or by application of amiloride inhibits shape change, secretion of granule contents and aggregation. The data we present here indicate that inhibition of this transport by ethylisopropyl-amiloride or by lowering extracellular sodium reduces or even completely suppresses the rise in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration that is essential for platelet aggregation in response to thrombin. We also demonstrate that cytoplasmic alkalinization produced by exposure to the ionophore monensin sensitizes the human platelet response to stimulation by thrombin resulting in enhanced Ca2+ mobilization and aggregability. We conclude that an increase in intracellular pH evoked by activation of Na+/H+ counter transport is an important signal in stimulus-response coupling and forms an essential step in the cascade of events required to increase cytoplasmic free Ca2+ in platelets.\r"

The marked contrast between an extremely rapid action in vivo and the absence of any significant activity on microfilariae in vitro is unique among chemotherapeutic agents. DEC has been thought to modify the surface layer of the microfilariae and expose them to immunological cell-mediated lysis. This report provides the first evidence that the effect of DEC is mediated by blood platelets with the additional triggering of a filarial excretory antigen (FEA). The killing mechanism is antibody-independent and involves the participation of free radicals.\r"

Here, we report the molecular cloning of human DAF from HeLa cells. Analysis of DAF complementary DNAs revealed two classes of DAF messenger RNA, one apparently derived from the other by a splicing event that causes a coding frameshift near the C terminus. The apparent 'intron' sequence contains an Alu family member and encodes contiguous protein sequence. Two DAF proteins are therefore possible, having divergent C-terminal domains which differ in their hydrophobicity. Both mRNAs are found on polysomes, suggesting that both are translated. We propose that the major (90%) spliced DAF mRNA encodes membrane-bound DAF whereas the minor (10%) unspliced DAF mRNA may encode secreted DAF and we present expression data supporting this. The deduced DAF sequence contains four repeating units homologous to a consensus repeat found in a recently described family of complement proteins.\r"

Recently, the knowledge of the chemistry of fog has expanded to include carbonyl compounds, volatile organic acids, and alkyl sulphonates. We have discovered that a variety of pesticides and their toxic alteration products are present in fog, and that they occasionally reach high concentrations relative to reported rainwater concentrations. In our experiments, we were able to measure the air-water distribution coefficients of pesticides between the liquid fog and the interstitial gas phase. These measurements reveal that some chemicals are enriched several thousandfold in the suspended liquid fog droplets compared to equilibrium distributions expected from Henry's Law coefficients for pure aqueous solutions.\r"

  ".W": "Blooms of the toxic dinoflagellate Gonyaulax tamarensis (synonyms Protogonyaulax tamarensis and Alexandrium tamarense) cause outbreaks of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) in coastal waters throughout the world. In the Gulf of Maine, episodes occur between April and November, a seasonality due in part to life-cycle alternations between motile, vegetative cells and resting cysts which overwinter in bottom sediments. Newly formed cysts have a mandatory 2-6 month dormancy period during which germination is not possible, but once mature, the resting state will continue if temperatures are unfavourable or oxygen is unavailable. We now report another factor controlling germination of cysts of G. tamarensis from deep coastal waters--an endogenous annual clock that can override an otherwise favourable environment for germination. Similar annual variability in germination has not been observed for cysts of this species from shallow estuaries. These results represent the first conclusive demonstration of an endogenous circannual rhythm in a marine plant. They are evolutionarily and ecologically significant because an endogenous annual clock can lead to the release of motile cells into deep and relatively invariant bottom waters at those times when temperature and light at the surface are suitable for growth. In shallow waters where seasonal variability is large and extends to bottom sediments, a strategy similar to that of the seeds of terrestrial plants would be more appropriate, namely a direct coupling between germination and the external environment.\r"

  ".U": "87115863\r", 
  ".W": "Glucagon specifically inhibits the Ca2+ pump in liver plasma membranes independently of adenylate cyclase activation. However, this inhibition is only observed at high concentrations of glucagon (Ki = 0.7 microM). Moreover, in the presence of bacitracin, an inhibitor of glucagon degradation, the Ca2+ pump is no longer sensitive to glucagon. These findings suggest that a fragment of glucagon might be the true effector of the liver Ca2+ pump. Pairs of basic amino acids are recognized as potential cleavage sites in post-translational processing of peptide hormones. The glucagon molecule includes a dibasic doublet (Arg 17-Arg 18). Therefore, we have examined the action of glucagon(19-29) on the liver Ca2+ pump. This peptide was obtained from glucagon by tryptic cleavage and separated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. We found that glucagon(19-29), which is totally ineffective in activating adenylate cyclase, inhibited both the Ca2+-activated and Mg2+-dependent ATPase activity [Ca2+-Mg2+) ATPase) and Ca2+ transport in liver plasma membranes with an efficiency 1,000-fold higher than that of glucagon. Glucagon(1-21) was completely inactive; glucagon(18-29) and glucagon(22-29) acted only as partial agonists of glucagon(19-29). These results indicate that glucagon(19-29), obtained by proteolytic cleavage of glucagon, is likely to be the active peptide involved in the inhibition of the liver Ca2+ pump. We suggest that glucagon may be a precursor of at least one biologically active peptide.\r"

Nearly all techniques sensitive to dynamics have given evidence for intramolecular mobility in proteins: NMR, ESR, Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence quenching, Mossbauer spectroscopy, neutron scattering, measurements of elastic constants and hydrogen-deuterium exchange. The dynamics of proteins has also been approached by theoretical calculations. We report here investigations of the atomic and molecular displacements in hen egg-white lysozyme crystals using a new technique. This technique, based on the X-ray diffuse scattering analysis (scattering out of the Bragg reflections), can yield information on the atomic displacements, provided that they are correlated. Rigid-body molecular displacements, correlated along short rows of aligned molecules in two perpendicular directions, have been detected and analysed (mean square amplitude of the order of 5 X 10(-4) nm2). This technique can be also applied to the detection and analysis of intramolecular displacements.\r"

  ".W": "A basic principle of human memory is that lists that can be organized into memorable 'chunks' are easier to remember. Memory span is limited to a roughly constant number of chunks and is to a large extent independent of the amount of informaton contained in each chunk. Depending on the ingenuity of the code used to integrate discrete items into chunks, one can substantially increase the number of items that can be recalled correctly. Newly developed paradigms for studying memory in non-verbal organisms allow comparison of the abilities of human and non-human subjects to memorize lists. Here I present two types of evidence that pigeons 'chunk' 5-element lists whose components (colours and achromatic geometric forms) are clustered into distinct groups. Those lists were learned twice as rapidly as a homogeneous list of colours or heterogeneous lists in which the elements are not clustered. The pigeons were also tested for knowledge of the order of two elements drawn from the 5-element lists. They responded in the correct order only to those subsets that contained a chunk boundary. Thus chunking can be studied profitably in animal subjects; the cognitive processes that allow an organism to form chunks do no presuppose linguistic competence.\r"

This afferent terminal somatotopic map correlates with the map of the receptive fields of the cells on which they terminate. The location, size and modality of the cutaneous receptive fields of dorsal horn neurons necessarily depend upon the anatomical presence of afferent nerve fibres which deliver information from the periphery, directly or indirectly, to the cells. However the receptive field size and modality of a cell do not depend only on anatomical connections. Excitatory and inhibitory interneurons, descending influences and facilitations or depressions of synaptic contacts can alter receptive field properties. Here we show that prolonged and substantial cutaneous receptive field changes can be produced by brief inputs from peripheral unmyelinated afferent fibres.\r"

We here describe the reciprocal actions of serotonin and the molluscan neuropeptide, FMRFamide, on individual K+ channels in Aplysia sensory neurons. In these cells, serotonin causes prolonged all-or-none closure of a class of background conductance K+ channels (the S channels) through cAMP-dependent protein phosphorylation. Using single-channel recording, we have found that FMRFamide produces two actions on the S channels; it increases the probability of opening of the S channels via a cAMP-independent second-messenger system and it reverses the closures of S channels produced by serotonin or cAMP.\r"

This behaviour, termed inward rectification, permits long depolarizing responses which are of physiological significance for the pumping function of the heart and for fertilization of egg cells. Little is known about the outward currents through the inwardly rectifying K channel, despite their great physiological importance, and the mechanism of inward rectification itself is unknown. We have used improved patch clamp techniques to control the intracellular media, and have recorded the outward whole-cell and single-channel currents. We report here that the channel conductance is ohmic and that the well-known inward rectification of the resting K conductance is caused by rapid closure of the channel accompanied by a voltage-dependent block by intracellular Mg2+ ions at physiological concentrations.\r"

We also test a surface-simulation peptide that was constructed to mimic the combining site of McPC603.

Eight patients underwent operation: clipping for 2 saccular aneurysms, trapping for 1 saccular and 3 fusiform aneurysms, and coating for 2 fusiform or broad-based aneurysms. Microsurgical cerebral revascularization techniques were attempted in 2 cases: after a fusiform aneurysm had been excised, end-to-end anastomosis of the residual two ends of the PCA was performed and, after a giant serpentine aneurysm had been trapped, the superficial temporal artery was anastomosed transcortically to the distal PCA. Two patients died before operation because of rebleeding and vasospasm. Postoperative neurological deficits include contralateral hemiparesis, homonymous hemianopsia, hemihypesthesia, and ipsilateral 3rd nerve palsy. Our results suggest that, despite the good collateral circulation of the PCA, some ischemic events may occur after trapping procedures and that cerebral revascularization techniques may have some benefit in the treatment of unclippable aneurysms in this region.\r"

The diagnosis of SAH rested on a typical history and the demonstration of blood in the cerebrospinal fluid (computed tomography (CT), lumbar puncture). Initial CT and four-vessel angiography were performed in all patients, and five had repeat angiography. Endocrinological assessment was done after the initial angiography, and abnormal findings from this first study were reassessed 3 months later. The follow-up study included a high resolution CT scan of the sellar region. One patient had panhypopituitarism. Insufficient growth hormone secretion alone or combined with a low plasma concentration of estradiol or testosterone was found in another seven patients. The sella was ballooned or enlarged in three patients, and four patients had at follow-up a partly empty sella. A spontaneous development of a partly empty sella from an adenoma with suprasellar extension was observed in the patient with panhypopituitarism. This patient had experienced pituitary apoplexy with resulting SAH. Based on sellar enlargement, an empty sella, and pituitary dysfunction, this pathogenesis was suggested in another three patients. Our findings suggest that hemorrhagic necrosis in a pituitary adenoma may be an important cause of SAH with normal angiography.\r"

A preoperative computed tomographic (CT) scan of the head revealed an enhancing calcified partially cystic right frontal mass that was removed through a right frontotemporal craniotomy. On microscopic examination, the tumor was composed of sheets of neurons in a glial background alternating with highly cellular anaplastic areas. The diagnosis of anaplastic ganglioglioma was made. The child has done well for the 20 months since the operation without any evidence of tumor recurrence on subsequent CT scans. Because of the immaturity of the child's developing central nervous system, we have elected not to initiate radiotherapy at this time. The pertinent literature regarding gangliogliomas is reviewed.\r"

Marked bony callous formation contiguous with the S-1 alar fracture protruded into the canal and was responsible for tethering the S-1 nerve root. A right L-5 hemilaminectomy, an L-4, L-5 and L-5, S-1 medial facetectomy, and foraminotomy facilitated nerve root decompression. Postoperatively, the patient was markedly improved. The authors suggest a more aggressive attitude in the diagnostic, radiographic, and surgical management of sacral fractures now that more specific technical facilities are available to define the precise character of the lesions involved.\r"

Only 1 of the 19 patients with both MSAH and ICH survived. The incidence of cerebral infarction was similar in nonsurvivors (31%) and survivors (29%). In the absence of associated MSAH, IVH, or ICH, cerebral infarction was uncommon (11%). Documented in-hospital rebleeding was uncommon in nonsurvivors (13%) and survivors (2%). Admission neurological status did not predict outcome independent of the extent of the initial bleeding. Comparison of the two groups suggests that the type and extent of initial bleeding are the most important determinants of mortality in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.\r"

We report here an evaluation of high dose naloxone (10 mg/kg) in a model of cord injury in rats using a static load compression technique. After induction of injury at T-12, naloxone (10 mg/kg) was administered by the intraperitoneal route, followed by five additional bolus injections over the course of the next 2 days. Animals were randomly assigned to this treatment regimen (n = 10) or to a saline control group (n = 10). The animals were observed for 4 weeks, with testing of recovery of hind limb motor function (Tarlov score and on an inclined plane). Although there were slight differences in recovery, the overall evaluation showed no statistically significant difference between the naloxone-treated and control groups. The spinal cords of the sacrificed animals were studied morphometrically; there was no statistically significant difference between the residual gray and white matter at the site of cord injury between the treated and control groups. Naloxone did not seem to promote recovery of motor function in this model of spinal cord injury.\r"

  ".U": "87116236\r", 
  ".W": "We previously reported that high dose naloxone (10 mg/kg) failed to promote recovery of motor function after a static load injury of the spinal cord in rats. In the present experiments, using the more traditional dynamic weight drop model, we tested megadose naloxone administered by the intraperitoneal route in 23 rats, including saline controls (Experiment 1). Thirty minutes after a cord injury at T-12, naloxone was given i.p. in a bolus of 100 mg/kg, followed by a continuous i.p. infusion of 50 mg/kg/hour for 23 hours. Again, no benefit was observed; this raised a question regarding naloxone and its absorption and serum levels. In another study, reported separately, we found that naloxone administered by the subcutaneous route affords higher and more sustained serum levels than by i.p. administration. Consequently, in 20 rats (Experiment 2), we repeated the protocol, using subcutaneous naloxone in a bolus dose of 150 mg/kg, followed by continuous infusion of 75 mg/kg/hour for 23 hours; the result was again negative. Morphometric determination of the residual (normal) cross sectional areas of gray and white matter at the epicenter of the cord lesion showed no statistically significant difference between treated and control animals in either Experiment 1 or Experiment 2. In view of the negative findings at high dose (10 mg/kg) and megadose naloxone, it seems that a reasonable next step would be an evaluation of lower doses using a factorial research design, incorporating a range of doses of naloxone in relation to a variety of intensities of cord injury. This question will be addressed in future experiments.\r"

Cerebral fixation was performed on Day 14 after SAH or 15 minutes after HRP injection. The major cerebral arteries from both the nonclot (control) and clot sides and the normal animals were examined with scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM). SEM of the adventitial surfaces of control and normal arteries revealed tunnel-like structures along the longitudinal axis. No vasa vasorum were seen, but adventitial rounded openings were observed, 10 to 35 micron in diameter in vessels of the anterior circulation and up to 80 micron in diameter in the basilar arteries. The stomas, numbering 5 to 10/mm of specimen, appeared to connect the subarachnoid and intraadventitial spaces or pathways. In SAH arteries, the tunica adventitia was coated with cellular remnants of hematoma or dense, well-organized blood clots, the removal of which revealed blocked stomas. TEM showed HRP in the vessel walls after injection into the cisterna magna, but not after injection into the carotid artery. TEM of control arteries revealed Virchow-Robin (intraadventitial) spaces lined by simple planar epithelium-like cells; Virchow-Robin spaces contained sparse nerve fiber bundles and connective tissue fibers. In SAH arteries, these spaces were almost filled with strands of connective tissue and fibroblasts; no nerve fibers were detected. Vasogenic substances probably reach smooth muscle cells via the adventitial stomas. SAH occluding the stomas may block the cerebrospinal fluid circulation, disturbing nutrition of the arterial wall or removal of wastes from it, thereby aggravating vasospasm.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify the regrowth patterns of benign and malignant gliomas, we chose 27 intervals (between two operations or between an operation and autopsy) from 21 patients with pathologically verified recurrent supratentorial gliomas. Serial computed tomographic (CT) scans of these cases were analyzed to determine the doubling time (Td) calculated from the change in volume of enhanced and low density areas, the enhancement effect graded from 0 to 4 according to the Hounsfield number, and the presence of dissemination and contralateral extension. We studied 5 benign gliomas (including 1 case of radiation necrosis), 8 malignant astrocytomas, and 8 glioblastomas. The Td's of enhanced areas on CT scans of benign gliomas, malignant astrocytomas, and glioblastomas were 937 +/- 66.5 days, 65.1 +/- 29.4 days, and 48.1 +/- 20.9 days, respectively. The Td's of low density areas were 895 +/- 130.6 days, 70.8 +/- 22.2 days, and 50.5 +/- 14.7 days. There was a significant correlation between the Td's of the enhanced and low density areas (0.97). The enhancement effect increased at recurrence in 55% of the cases, with an average increase of 1.1 grades. The increase in enhancement effect at recurrence showed a tendency to become smaller as the tumor's degree of anaplasia increased. Radiotherapy was effective in significantly retarding the growth rate of malignant gliomas, whose Td's were doubled. Although the Td's of both enhanced and low density areas of benign gliomas were significantly longer than those of malignant gliomas, there was no significant difference in the Td's of enhanced areas between malignant astrocytomas and glioblastomas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The exposure and operative management of the petrous and upper cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) in 29 patients is detailed. Twenty-seven of these patients had extensive cranial base neoplasms (benign or malignant), 1 had an inflammatory cholesteatoma, and 1 had an aneurysm of the upper cervical ICA immediately proximal to the carotid canal. Preoperative studies useful in the evaluation of these patients included computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, cerebral and cervical angiography, and a balloon occlusion test of the ICA with evaluation of neurological status and of cerebral blood flow. The exposure of the upper cervical and petrous ICA was useful to obtain proximal control of the cavernous ICA, aided in the operative approach to extensive petroclival, intracavernous, and parapharyngeal neoplasms, and enabled the total resection of 23 of 27 such tumors. A subtemporal and preauricular infratemporal fossa approach was most commonly used for the exposure of the artery. Intraoperative arterial management consisted of exposure and decompression only, dissection from encasing neoplasm, resection of the invaded arterial segment and vein graft reconstruction, or intentional arterial occlusion. Vascular complications included 1 stroke due to delayed arterial occlusion, 1 stroke and death due to infection spreading from the nasopharynx with bilateral ICA rupture, and 1 pseudoaneurysm formation secondary to wound infection necessitating postoperative balloon occlusion of the ICA. Nonvascular complications included facial nerve paralysis in 10 patients (usually temporary), glossopharyngeal and vagal paralysis in 13 patients requiring Teflon injection of the vocal cord in 9, temporary difficulties with mastication in 9 patients, and wound infection in 3. The surgical exposure and management of the upper cervical and petrous ICA may permit a total operative resection of extensive cranial base neoplasms and is also an alternative for the management of vascular lesions involving these segments of the artery. With malignant neoplasms extending from the nasopharynx, postoperative infection remains a problem and may best be resolved by the use of a vascularized rectus abdominis muscle flap to reconstruct defects of the nasopharynx. Bilateral ICA encasement by neoplasms is also a major problem to be solved. The value of such an aggressive approach to the management of malignant neoplasms remains to be proven.\r"

Pyogenic abscesses, usually hematogenous, also occurred secondary to osteomyelitis of the skull and chronic otitis media. The fungal abscess developed in a nonimmunocompromised patient with no intercurrent malignancy. Evidence of tuberculosis elsewhere in the body was detected in only 7 patients with tuberculomas. The computed tomographic (CT) image morphology characterizing an abscess or a tuberculoma was present in all except 2 patients with tuberculomas. The fungal abscess resembled a malignant glioma. The only hospital mortality occurred in a deeply unconscious patient with a thalamic pyogenic abscess. A 12-month or longer follow-up in 16 patients showed that 3 continued to be handicapped neurologically, and 2 died 13 and 16 months later, respectively. We conclude that inflammatory lesions at these sites are not uncommon and that CT scans are diagnostic in the great majority. Doubtful diagnosis merits stereotactic aspiration or biopsy of the lesion. Satisfactory results follow adequate medical therapy.\r"

We introduced this procedure in our surgical practice in 1982 for patients with internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms not suitable for direct repair in whom occlusion of the ICA is considered necessary. One patient died because a conventional STA-MCA bypass did not prevent a major stroke caused by a therapeutic ICA occlusion. We are reporting our surgical technique and the immediate and long term clinical and angiographic results in five cases operated on during the period June 19, 1982, through January 19, 1983. The early and late patency rates were good. No neurological complications were observed after the bypass procedure or during a 3-year follow-up period. In our opinion, the use of proximal segments of the MCA as recipient arteries for supratentorial revascularization is a good alternative to the use of cortical surface arteries and, in selected cases, could be the first choice technique.\r"

The tumor was supratentorial in two cases. In one case, a cortically mediated mechanism may have caused the neuralgia, whereas in the remaining two cases distortion and displacement of the brain stem and compression of the contralateral Meckel's cave would explain the trigeminal nerve signs.\r"

Results obtained with slow (1 to 6 seconds) depth electrode stimulation and recording in humans are compared and are used to predict probable developments in the magnetic field.

They appear promising as a test of central nervous system function, and they are sensitive not only to mechanical injury but also to ischemia. In mechanical trauma, the peripheral nerve response is much more sensitive to damage than the cord response, with a lower threshold and an earlier disappearance. We are reporting that the MEP can also be produced in the dog and that, under conditions of cardiac arrest induced by fibrillation, the peripheral nerve response disappears first at about 30 seconds and then the spinal cord response disappears at about 10 to 13 minutes. The late disappearance of the spinal cord response raises serious questions about its role as an adequate injury monitor. The most useful warning feature of the spinal cord response is an increase in amplitude during the critical first 2 minutes of arrest. Latency changes in the cord and peripheral nerve response did not seem as useful as amplitude changes in terms of providing adequate detection of injury. We also evaluated the peripheral nerve signals to determine whether they are partially volume-conducted weak muscle responses, and evidence substantiates their nonmuscle origin.\r"

We have recorded and characterized the motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from 10 normal rats and from 10 rats with the following cord lesions at C-8: 4 animals with complete cord transection and 6 with clip compression injury: 2 at 56.0 g, 2 at 20.0 g, and 2 at 1.5 g. MEPs were elicited by applying constant current anodal stimuli to the sensorimotor cortex with the responses recorded from microelectrodes in the spinal cord at T-10. The MEP consisted of an initial D wave (mean latency, 1.22 +/- 0.09 ms) and 4 subsequent I waves, I1 to I4. The D wave was elicited at stimulation frequencies exceeding 100 Hz, consistent with the hypothesis that it results from direct pyramidal cell excitation. The 56.0-g clip compression injuries and the cord transections abolished the MEP distal to the lesion, whereas the 20.0- and 1.5-g injuries resulted in a latency shift and amplitude decrement of the MEP peaks. These experiments suggest that the recording of MEPs will be an extremely useful and accurate method of monitoring the functional integrity of the cord, of value in patients with cord injury.\r"

Rats, anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride, were subjected to parasagittal craniectomies and midthoracic laminectomies. SSEPs were cortically recorded and CMEPs were transcortically produced using epidural ball and disc electrodes. SSEPs were elicited and CMEPs were recorded via hindlimb percutaneous needle electrodes. After control records, animals were subjected to a 50-g/cm impact to the dorsal cord surface using a modified weight drop technique. Evaluation of neurological injury was performed by SSEP and CMEP analysis and was compared with neurological assessments obtained before injury and 1 hour, 1 week, 3 weeks, and 6 weeks after injury. Neurohistopathological verification of each spinal cord lesion was performed at 6 weeks after injury. Animals subjected to a 50-g/cm cord impact showed no change in SSEP wave forms, but all components of the CMEP were greatly attenuated with this injury. Acutely, either very weak movement or no movement to noxious stimulation was present without vocalization. There was a spectrum of clinical recovery that correlated closely with the return and normalization of the amplitude of the CMEP in 100% of the animals tested. The eventual degree of clinical and CMEP improvement correlated well with the degree of histological damage present. The results of this study suggest that the CMEP is a reliable indicator of the initial degree of loss of neurological motor function in acute blunt spinal cord injury in the rat, as well as an accurate measure of the degree and extent of recovery. The rat model as outlined here is a simple and inexpensive system for evaluation both clinically and electrophysiologically of the degree of motor recovery from spinal cord injury. This model should prove useful in the evaluation of promising pharmacological agents for potential use in the treatment of acute spinal cord injury.\r"

  ".W": "In injury to the spinal cord, motor function is the most critical system affected. The introduction of motor evoked potential (MEP) monitoring techniques over the past 5 years has opened new possibilities for the assessment of motor function. We examined the MEP change in 30 cats that received weight drop injuries to the thoracic spinal cord and correlated it with function. The MEPs were recorded above and below the injury and in the sciatic nerves. In these animals, we found that the peripheral nerve response to the MEP was the most sensitive to injury, disappearing immediately upon weight drop. The MEP at the spinal cord level was somewhat more sensitive to injury than the SSEP at the cord level, and the SSEP at the cortex was the least sensitive to injury. The MEP spinal cord signal below the lesion showed both a latency increase and a substantial amplitude decrease after impact. The latency increase, however, was of relatively small absolute magnitude making the amplitude change easier to monitor. The animals were followed chronically, and 17 of the 30 regained ambulation. In all animals (followed up to 2 months), the peripheral nerve signals returned at or immediately before the time of ambulation. In none of the animals who failed to regain a peripheral nerve response was ambulation attained. This supports a strong correlation of the peripheral nerve response with walking. However, the peripheral nerve response was only a short term predictor. Examination of the spinal cord signal showed that the MEP spinal cord signal below the lesion as a percentage above the lesion was a significant correlate of current ambulation recovery, with a correlation coefficient of 0.55. This suggests that evaluation of the SSEP and MEP spinal cord signals may be able to predict longer term recovery in animals and perhaps humans.\r"

These data indicate that the charge per phase used in most of the extracranial MEP protocols is sufficient to induce neural damage if the stimulation is applied continuously for several hours. However, in most cases dispersion of the stimulus current in the extracranial tissue and skull is probably adequate to attenuate the stimulus charge density at the brain surface to a safe level (less than approximately 40 microC/cm2 X ph). However, the possibility exists that low resistance paths between the stimulating electrode and the brain may give rise to foci of high charge density. The possibility of such focusing may be less with magnetic field than with direct electrical field stimulation. We stress the need for additional animal studies designed to delineate a range of safe stimulus parameters for this particular technique.\r"

The response chosen was that elicited by a corticocortical afferent input, specifically the transcallosal response (TCR). We used ourselves as subjects. The large shock artifacts associated with passing large currents through the head were reduced by: stimulating percutaneously with a focal anode (5 cm2) situated midway between F4 and C4 (i.e., frontal region, standard 10-20 nomenclature) and a medially located, semicircular grounded cathode (26 cm2) no closer than 3 to 4 cm away; and recording with the focal scalp electrode over homologous left frontal cortex vs. two or more reference electrodes interconnected through variable resistors and at least 6 cm away. Transcranial stimulation with pulses of 80 to 140 mA and lasting 100 microseconds elicited a brief diphasic deflection (latency, 2 to 4 ms), followed by an initially positive, often bifid wave with a latency of 9 to 14 ms, lasting 18 to 44 ms and reaching 5 to 10 microV. The initial diphasic deflection greatly increased when the stimulating anode was moved laterally over temporalis muscle, indicating an electromyographic (EMG) origin. The EMG, but not the positive wave, was elicited when the interpolar distance was reduced to 1 cm, which greatly reduced the fraction of current traversing the cortex (epicranial stimulation); furthermore, occluding the circulation to the scalp for 30 minutes by rubber tubing above the zygomas and brows dulled sensation, reduced the EMG, but did not alter the latency or rising phase of the positive wave. Early somatosensory components, if present, were small compared with the positive wave.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Impaired consciousness leading to a general downgrading of clinical status was the predominant clinical finding (93%), but neither this nor other nonspecific signs of increased intracranial pressure were distinguishable from the effects of the precipitating hemorrhage. The computed tomographic signs of acute hydrocephalus are distinctive and consist of selective ballooning of the frontal horns, rostral-caudal enlargement of the cerebral ventricles, and a halo of periventricular hyperdensity (edema) that evolves in sequence with ventricular changes. The treatment of choice is external ventricular drainage, which results in prompt and often dramatic improvement in approximately two-thirds of the patients.\r"

The responses are also facilitated by background activation of the muscles. We are reporting a set of patients studied using electrical and magnetic stimulation transcranially. We observed that the latency of electromyogram activation is much shorter in active than contracting muscles and that the muscle twitch produced by cortical stimulation can exceed the force produced by supramaximal stimulation of the peripheral nerve. Our findings suggest that this may be due to multiple firing of motor neurons. Another observation is that magnetic stimulation is not as subject to a reduction in the response latency with facilitation, and response latencies with magnetic stimulation were 2 ms longer than with electrical stimulation. The implications of these findings are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "We are reporting 98 cases of motor evoked potential (MEP) monitoring performed between 1982 and 1986. These were divided into supratentorial, posterior fossa, and spinal cord categories. We observed in this sample that the peripheral nerve or electromyographic response was substantially more sensitive than the spinal cord response to injury and hypotension during operation and was often present bilaterally. Reversible weakening or loss of the peripheral nerve response was not associated with a deficit. However, weakening of the peripheral nerve response without recovery could warn of a motor defect after operation. The spinal cord responses can change so little in amplitude and latency with injury conditions that their reliable use during operation without accompanying peripheral nerve and muscle response monitoring may be compromised, especially in view of the often difficult recording environment in the operating room. With spinal cord monitoring, the MEP seemed closely correlated with the stresses that we imposed on the cord, as well as with subsequent clinical outcome. In posterior fossa cases, we observed sensitivity of the MEP to manipulation of the nervous system and reliable indication of the outcome in the cases monitored. Supratentorial cases present a more complex environment for monitoring; a potential pitfall is to stimulate an area that produces responses in the peripheral nerves and spinal cord, but that is not being compromised by the injury process. Alternatively, stimulating too large an area of cortex or stimulating with too high a current, which penetrates to white matter below the gray matter, may not show an injury. Although we did not encounter cases where permanent deficits were missed by the motor evoked potential, we were concerned by the appearance of temporary deficits. These may be related to technical limitations of our methods and indicate that monitoring of the supratentorial process requires substantial methodological advance for high reliability. Modulation of the MEP by prior somatosensory evoked potential stimulation seems useful and promising. Cerebellar evoked potential responses were present in humans and were sensitive to injury. Overall, this test is promising.\r"

Optimal responses were obtained through a pericranial cathode consisting of 6 to 12 regularly spaced, interconnected pericranial cathodal discs whose resistance was carefully balanced with that of a stimulating anodal disc placed on the appropriate scalp region. The foci of maximal response for proximal and distal upper limb muscles as well as for lower limb muscles were localized. The scalp to cervical cord central conduction time (CCT) along motor tracts governing the hand muscles was 5.21 +/- 0.42 ms. This index was highly correlated with the subject's height and stable in time when repeatedly tested. Collision between orthodromically and antidromically propagated motor impulses was obtained. Response facilitation was achieved by means of prestimulus voluntary contraction of the target muscle, continuous vibration of its tendon, or scalp stimulation with paired shocks. The presence of a premovement facilitation of MEPs was also demonstrated, as was the presumed presence of transcallosal facilitation. An efferent volley secondary to scalp stimulation was recorded from the nerve trunk. Abnormalities in MEP characteristics as well as in CCTs were found in patients with multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cord compression, and degenerative diseases of the central nervous system.\r"

Four previous brain abscesses complicating the use of halo orthoses have been reported. All cases of abscess have been associated with overlying infection at the site of pin insertion. Our case and at least one of those previously reported may have been related to tightening of the halo pins after placement. Serious spine injuries occur rarely in wrestlers and are associated with the use of illegal holds and maneuvers in which one athlete is thrown to the mat. The pathophysiology and radiographic appearance of a unilateral facet dislocation are reviewed.\r"

A 32-year-old woman who was at 32 weeks of gestation experienced sudden severe headache followed by loss of consciousness. Computed tomography revealed an intracerebral hematoma in the left temporal lobe, and left carotid angiograms revealed moyamoya disease. The patient underwent emergency craniotomy, the hematoma was removed, and encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis was performed. The patient showed good recovery and, 2 months later, delivered a child vaginally without any trouble. Most intracranial hemorrhages during pregnancy result from cerebral aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), and few cases due to moyamoya disease have been reported. It is generally believed that subarachnoid hemorrhage due to cerebral aneurysms is likely to occur during the middle trimester of gestation, with the risk increasing progressively toward the third trimester. This may be explained by the fact that the cardiac output increases rather acutely from the first to the middle trimester. There seems to be no significant correlation between the stage of pregnancy and the occurrence of hemorrhage due to AVM. Most authors think that the operative indications for intracranial hemorrhage during pregnancy should be the same as for the nonpregnant state.\r"

Control angiograms showed spontaneous resolution of the vasospasm and recanalization of the cortical artery. The patient made a complete neurological recovery; he needed only treatment with vasopressin due to transient diabetes insipidus. The risk of vasospasm and brain ischemia should be kept in mind when treating pituitary apoplexy.

All patients presented with the signs and symptoms of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and were in good neurological condition on admission. In all cases, early operation was performed to obliterate aneurysm. Subarachnoid blood clots were extensively removed and cisternal drainage was done. With topical application of povidone-iodine and intravenous administration of antibiotics, cisternal drainage continued for 14 days or more after the onset of SAH in 21 cases. Five patients developed symptomatic vasospasm, which was treated with hypervolemia and hypertension, and three received shunts later for chronic hydrocephalus. The overall result demonstrated that 21 patients were independent and had returned to their previous social lives. Therefore, it was strongly recommended that patients is good neurological condition after SAH secondary to ruptured intracranial aneurysm be treated with early operation, removal of subarachnoid clots, and long term application of cisternal drainage.\r"

Coadministration of VGB resulted in a mean decrease of 20% in phenytoin serum concentration (p less than 0.001). Sixty-six patients with a favorable response to VGB during the single-blind study have been followed for a median of 16.7 months on VGB.

Prior acute or chronic anticonvulsant use (excepting chronic benzodiazepines) did not alter effectiveness or increase side effects. Duration of freedom from seizures following acute therapy was independent of LOR dosage. In patients requiring sequential doses, LOR becomes progressively less effective. Side effects were few and, when present, always associated with a single or first dose in a series. LOR is a safe and effective acute anticonvulsant agent for in-hospital control of SE in the pediatric age group. Tachyphylaxis of anticonvulsant action occurs when serial doses are used.\r"

In search of a morphologic correlate of the transmission failure, we analyzed the densities and diameters of synaptic vesicles in deep and superficial regions of nerve terminals in external intercostal muscles of three FIM patients and three nonweak controls before and after 10-Hz stimulation for 10 minutes. The densities of superficial or deep synaptic vesicles before or after stimulation in FIM were not significantly different from the corresponding control values. The diameters of superficial and deep synaptic vesicles before stimulation were significantly smaller in the three FIM patients than in the three controls. Stimulation in the FIM patients reduced the MEPP amplitude by 51 to 75%, but increased the vesicle diameter in two patients and did not change the vesicle diameter in one patient. Stimulation in the controls reduced the MEPP amplitude by only 16 to 34%, decreased the vesicle diameter in two, and did not change the vesicle diameter in one. Stimulation after treatment with 1 mg/dl hemicholinium markedly reduced the MEPP amplitude in the controls, had no further effect on the transmission defect in FIM, and had no consistent effect on vesicle diameter in FIM or controls. We conclude that synaptic vesicles are abnormally small in rested muscle in FIM, but vesicle size cannot be reliably correlated with the MEPP amplitude in FIM or controls.\r"

We therefore assessed the ability of yohimbine to increase sympathoadrenal discharge and raise blood pressure (BP) in patients with autonomic failure characterized by profound orthostatic hypotension. Yohimbine 5 mg orally in eight seated patients significantly elevated mean systolic BP by 33 mm Hg from 136 +/- 15 (mean +/- SD) to a maximum of 169 +/- 23 mm Hg (p less than 0.01), mean diastolic BP by 16 mm Hg from 77 +/- 9 to a maximum of 93 +/- 15 mm Hg (p less than 0.01), and mean heart rate (HR) by 10 beats per minute (BPM) from 68 +/- 12 to a maximum of 78 +/- 17 BPM (p less than 0.01). Plasma norepinephrine (NE) increased from 104 +/- 71 to a maximum of 196 +/- 182 pg/ml (p less than 0.05), but plasma epinephrine (E) did not increase significantly (31 +/- 18 versus a maximum of 39 +/- 21 pg/ml). In five patients given yohimbine 2.5 mg orally, BP, HR, NE, and E tended to increase, but the changes were not significant. Plasma yohimbine levels correlated significantly with the changes in mean arterial pressure (r = 0.61, p less than 0.01). Yohimbine raises BP and HR in patients with autonomic failure. These effects are dose- and concentration-dependent and mediated through increased sympathetic discharge. Yohimbine may be useful in the treatment of orthostatic hypotension associated with autonomic failure. It is unique among current modes of therapy for this disorder in that it enhances discharge of the patient's own sympathetic system.\r"

  ".W": "From 1967 to 1979, 118 incident cases of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) and 236 age- and sex-matched controls from Rochester, MN, were identified. Medical records on patients and controls for 40 years preceding the diagnosis of IPD were reviewed. The relative risk (RR) for ever-smoked and IPD was not significantly different from unity (RR = 0.7, 95% confidence interval = 0.4 to 1.2). The mean age at diagnosis of IPD was significantly younger (p = 0.007) in the ever-smokers (68.8 years) compared with never-smokers (73.8 years), although this needs to be interpreted cautiously. It is concluded that smoking had no effect on the development of IPD. Within 5 years after the index date, a new diagnosis of dementia was made more often in cases than in controls (p = 0.01). Relative risk of IPD significantly increased when prior diagnosis of psychoneurosis and psychosomatic illness had been made.\r"

Overall benefit waned over the next 3 to 6 months. Oral controlled-release carbidopa/levodopa is capable of reducing fluctuations in plasma levodopa levels and clinical performance in Parkinson's disease.

However, most pathologic studies stress the absence of NFTs in GSS. The nosology of this case is difficult to resolve because of profuse NFTs and morphologic differences between our and comparison Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases, the most prominent being spongiform changes. This case is remarkable because it combines features of a number of CNS degenerative diseases, including multiple system atrophy, AD, spongiform encephalopathies, and cerebrovascular amyloidosis.\r"

While neuronal chromatin was found to be more acid-labile than that of the oligodendrocytes, there were no differences in either cell type between AD and controls. These data support the existence of a macromolecular disturbance (RNA loss) occurring within neostriatal neurons, perhaps related to the extrapyramidal dysfunction of AD, but fail to demonstrate that an alteration in chromatin is responsible for this effect.\r"

They were obtained from 15 nerves in which sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) were absent or not more than 1 microV, but from which motor responses could be elicited. Motor and sensory (SEP-derived) conduction velocity was determined from the difference in response latency with wrist and elbow stimulation. In 11 nerves, afferent conduction velocity was slowed. In 10, there was relatively equal slowing in sensory and motor axons, whereas in 1 there was disproportionate slowing in afferent fibers. In four nerves, afferent conduction velocity was within the normal range despite slowing of motor conduction. We conclude that SEPs may be useful in evaluating peripheral sensory conduction in the absence of SNAPs, but can provide misleadingly normal data, presumably because of central amplification of an attenuated response arising from a few axons that conduct normally.\r"

Recent memory was significantly impaired, but assessment of digit span, reaction time, and distant memory showed no impairment. Physostigmine, an anticholinesterase, restored the P3 and reversed the recent memory impairment. These results strongly suggest a cholinergic role in generation of P3 potential and support the concept that P3 generation is related to memory processes.\r"

Five patients underwent complete callosotomy and one an anterior callosotomy, aged 19 to 24 years, 21 to 53 months (prior to scanning). T1 images showed complete absence of the callosal shadow in five cases and visualization of the genu and splenium in the sixth case. T2-weighted pulse sequence spin-echo MRI showed intense image throughout the region of the entire callosum in the two cases with the longest postoperative course. The two middle cases showed intense T2 signal from the splenium, and the two latest showed no increase in T2 signal. We believe the increase in T2 signal in the transected callosum may represent an in vivo example of anisomorphic gliosis. T1 images demonstrate the anatomic extent of transection, while T2 images demonstrate the chemical and pathophysiologic sequence of transection. Thus, MRI is the imaging test of choice to evaluate callosotomy patients.\r"

Assessing a patient's risk of developing deep venous thrombosis is important for patient selection and in choosing appropriate prophylactic methods. Four hundred eleven patients undergoing major gynecologic surgery were evaluated prospectively. All known variables associated with deep venous thrombosis were recorded. Deep venous thrombosis was diagnosed by 125I fibrinogen leg counting of all patients. Univariate analysis of all variables identified the following to be significantly related (P less than .05) to postoperative deep venous thrombosis: a prior history of deep venous thrombosis, leg edema or venous stasis changes, venous varicosities, degree of preoperative ambulation, type of surgery, nonwhite race, recurrent malignancy, prior pelvic radiation therapy, age above 45 years, excessive body weight, intraoperative blood loss, and duration of anesthesia. A stepwise logistic regression analysis of these variables was performed. The following preoperative prognostic factors remained significant: type of surgery, age, leg edema, nonwhite patients, severity of venous varicosities, prior radiation therapy, and prior history of deep venous thrombosis. Duration of anesthesia was also important when intraoperative factors were considered in the analysis. Using these factors, a prognostic model was created and tested. The model resulted in a degree of concordance of 0.82 and allows one to evaluate the risks of postoperative deep venous thrombosis for an individual patient.\r"

  ".W": "The American Cancer Society recently has suggested changes in the frequency of Papanicolaou smear screening which, if followed, would alter current practice considerably. This study assessed the impact of the Papanicolaou smear screening interval on the prevention of advanced disease. Between July 1, 1980 and June 30, 1984, 264 women were evaluated and treated for primary epithelial carcinoma of the cervix (64% had stage I disease). Ninety-seven women (37%) had had a normal Papanicolaou smear within three years of diagnosis, including 48 women (18%) whose last normal Papanicolaou smear was within a year of diagnosis. The cytologic history was unavailable for 81 women (31%). Patients with a screening interval of greater than six years were more likely to be older, of lower socioeconomic status, and black, as compared with patients in the more frequently screened groups. Patients with a screening interval of 36 months or less were similar to those with a 37- to 72-month interval with respect to age, racial characteristics, and socioeconomic status. In this similar group of patients, a screening interval of 37-72 months was associated with a significantly larger proportion of advanced stage disease than found in more frequently screened patients. A policy of screening more frequently than every three years may therefore lead to increased survival among women who develop cervical cancer despite cytologic screening.\r"

This technique was used in 11 gynecologic oncology patients who required colostomy. Postoperative stomal function was normal in all cases. No patient developed stomal necrosis, peristomal hematoma, or abscess. No delayed complications have been observed. Colostomy creation with the EEA instrument is a safe, simple and rapid procedure. Possible advantages of the stapled colostomy are enhanced blood flow to the stomal site, reduced incidence of peristomal infection, and improved appliance fit.\r"

Histologic confirmation of human papillomavirus infection was required for entry into the study. All patients were evaluated by repeat cytology, colposcopy, endocervical curettage, and colposcopically directed biopsy as indicated at intervals of three to six months. Patients who developed classic features of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia were treated by standard modalities, whereas patients with evidence of human papillomavirus infection without associated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia were not treated. Confirmation of the resolution of human papillomavirus infection required negative cytology and colposcopy on two consecutive evaluations. Of the 45 patients for whom complete follow-up data are available, five (11.1%) had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia at the time of their initial evaluation, 15 (33.3%) progressed to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia over an average of 10.9 months, 18 (40%) resolved over an average of 13.7 months, and seven (15.6%) persisted with neither progression nor resolution for an average of 21 months. These data suggest that about one-third of patients who have histologically confirmed human papillomavirus cervical infection can be expected to develop cervical intraepithelial neoplasia within a year.\r"

For purposes of analysis, fetuses were divided into two groups: those less than 31 weeks, and those of 31 weeks or more. Diameters of the pulmonary artery and aortic outflow region increased with advancing gestational age (P less than .001), while mean and maximal Doppler flow velocities did not change. Transvalve volume flow increased across both regions (pulmonary artery from 381 +/- 12 mL/minute to 530 +/- 13 mL/minute and aortic outflow from 286 +/- 10 mL/minute to 410 +/- 13 mL/minute, P less than .001) with advancing gestation. Pulmonary artery diameters were larger than aortic outflow diameters in both groups (P less than .01), while mean Doppler flow velocities were not significantly different. Maximal Doppler flow velocities were greater in the aorta than in the pulmonary artery (P less than .001), and transvalve flow was greater across the pulmonary artery than the aorta in both groups (P less than .05, ratio 1.3:1). This work demonstrates differences in fetal pulmonary artery and aortic outflow anatomy and physiology that must be considered in evaluating studies of fetal cardiac physiology.\r"

We pair-matched 127 infants of diabetic mothers (diabetic group) with 127 infants of nondiabetic mothers (controls) for the above factors. Diabetic mothers enrolled before nine weeks' gestation were randomly assigned to one of two groups: I. \"strict management,\" to achieve euglycemic (fasting blood glucose less than 80 mg/dL, 1.5-hour-postprandial blood glucose less than 120 mg/dL); II. \"customary management,\" to provide care \"as practiced in the community\" (fasting blood glucose 100 mg/dL or less, postprandial blood glucose less than 140 mg/dL). A group enrolled after the first trimester (III) was managed identically to group II. Infants of diabetic mothers had a rate of RDS of 13.4%, not significantly different from the rate of 15% in controls (P greater than .05). When analyzed by gestational age groups of less than 36, or 36 or more weeks' gestation, there was also no difference in frequency of RDS between the diabetic group and controls. By logistic regression analysis, the presence of RDS in infants of diabetic mothers significantly correlated with lower gestational age (P less than .0001), and delivery by cesarean section not preceded by labor (P less than .01)(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fifty-two patients in labor were allowed to deliver. The remaining 47 were randomly assigned to either prompt delivery (N = 26) or conservative management (N = 21). The overall corrected perinatal survival was excellent (96%). Only one death in the entire series clearly was due to prematurity. Expectant management prolonged gestation greater than one week in only four of 21 patients (19%), and was associated with a significantly increased risk of maternal infections. There were no failed inductions of labor, and 22 of 24 induced patients (92%) delivered vaginally. Neonatal morbidity was similar in each group. These findings in an indigent, largely black population suggest that when pulmonary maturity is present, the maternal risks of conservative management may exceed the potential benefit to the fetus and newborn. The findings of this study may be specific to the population studied, and extrapolation to dissimilar populations may not be warranted.\r"

Bacteroides bivius, one of the most common isolates in these fluids, is found in approximately 20% of cases. To provide further information of the role of B bivius in intraamniotic infection, we measured serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) against B bivius by a micro-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Antigen was prepared from whole cells of a clinical isolate. Amniotic fluid was collected by aspiration of a transcervical pressure catheter, and was cultured for aerobes, anaerobes, and mycoplasmas. Acute and convalescent sera from 47 infected women and 31 controls were assayed to detect serologic response. Patients with intraamniotic infection and B bivius in amniotic fluid culture had significantly greater serologic responses than did infected women without B bivius in amniotic fluid and asymptomatic controls. These data suggest a pathogenic role of B bivius in intraamniotic infection, and imply that it probably plays a frequent role in other obstetric infections.\r"

The true positive rate was highest in serous cystadenocarcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, and dysgerminoma. A tendency to an inverse correlation with differentiation was found. Measurement of the enzyme did not give a useful index of stage of disease, tumor burden, or prognosis. The value of the enzyme as an index of successful therapy was limited because half of the patients lost this marker during progression.

Of the 75 samples adequate for drug testing (30 or more colonies per plate), histologic analysis demonstrated 36 adenocarcinomas, seven adenoacanthomas, ten adenosquamous carcinomas, nine mixed mesodermal sarcomas, seven carcinosarcomas, three papillary adenocarcinomas, and three clear-cell carcinomas. Mixed mesodermal sarcoma specimens demonstrated the most efficient growth, followed by the adenosquamous adenocarcinoma and adenoacanthoma samples. In vitro chemosensitivities were determined by colony inhibition resulting from continuous exposure of tumor cells to known achievable peak plasma and one-tenth peak plasma concentrations of a particular agent. The plating efficiency reflected the clinical virulence by cell type. Thus, we found that malignant endometrial tumors can be cloned in vitro, and the observed chemosensitivities reflect the relative clinical resistance of the tumors to these agents. Based on the high cloning success, this tumor type may be well suited as a model using in vitro soft agar cloning for new drug screening, evaluation of novel drug combinations, and studies of human tumor biology.\r"

Two percent of the cervical patients and none of the endometrial patients had bladder mucosal involvement discovered by using cystoscopy. Ureteral obstruction was seen by the IVP in 9% of the cervical patients and 1% of the endometrial patients. All of the women with cervical carcinoma who had bladder mucosal invasion or ureteral obstruction were already stage III before these tests. The chest x-rays showed a 0.7 and 3% incidence of tumor involvement in cervical and endometrial patients, respectively. The final stage differed from the initial stage in seven of the cervical patients and in two of the endometrial patients, but only in three of these nine were the changes based on the findings of the routine pretreatment evaluation. We conclude that routine cystoscopy, barium enema, and sigmoidoscopy in all patients with early stage cervical or endometrial carcinoma is not necessary, that a routine chest x-ray is still indicated in all patients with these malignancies, and that IVP should be performed routinely in all patients with cervical carcinoma but only if clinically indicated in patients with endometrial carcinoma.\r"

Gonadotropins, testosterone, and androstenedione levels decreased, prolactin did not change, and sex hormone binding globulin increased as the result of the treatment. This led to a net decrease in the calculated free testosterone.\r"

The basal levels of androgen in the first three were variably elevated. In all the members of this family who were tested, the response of 17-hydroxyprogesterone and progesterone to adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation was either normal or of the type seen in heterozygotes for congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Of particular importance is the fact that neither the proband nor her mother or maternal aunt had the type of response seen in homozygotes presenting the attenuated form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. The disorder appears to be a familial condition resulting in excessive levels of adrenal androgens beginning during childhood years, causing hirsutism and amenorrhea and interfering with normal pubertal and adult ovarian function. Glucocorticoid therapy suppresses adrenal androgen levels; in two individuals, conception occurred twice in each during such treatment in otherwise amenorrheic individuals. The pattern of transmission of the disorder appears to be either autosomal or X-linked dominant, and not linked to the homologous leucocytic antibodies (HLA) region of the sixth chromosome.\r"

Ruptured tubal pregnancy was not considered a contraindication to laparoscopic treatment. Four of the six women who were trying to conceive and were followed for longer than six months have had documented intrauterine pregnancies; one woman subsequently developed a contralateral tubal pregnancy which was treated by laparoscopic salpingotomy. Tubal ectopic pregnancy, even in the presence of rupture, can be managed effectively by a variety of laparoscopic techniques with benefits including minimal incision, short hospitalization, early return to full activity, and in many cases, a patent tube.\r"

Reported is a patient with histologically proved acute fatty liver who developed fetal distress during therapy for coagulopathy.

M-mode evaluation revealed fetal bradycardia (70 beats per minute) with atrial and ventricular systole occurring simultaneously, suggesting a nodal rhythm. Real-time examination demonstrated a ventricular septal defect, pericardial effusion, ventricular wall hypertrophy, and a dilated aortic root. Also present were fetal ascites and situs inversus of the stomach. A repeat ultrasound examination revealed fetal death at 16 weeks of gestation. Autopsy confirmed the above structural abnormalities, and also demonstrated bilobed lungs, pulmonary artery and valve hypoplasia, midline small intestine, and asplenia.\r"

After vacuum curettage was performed, repeat scan showed an empty uterus. Anaerobes isolated from the cervix both before chorionic villus sampling and during the infection were also implicated in published reports of patients developing life-threatening complications, but were not treated specifically until after morbid sequelae had occurred. Serious morbidity was avoided in this patient by aggressive management with early anaerobic cover, uterine evacuation despite the presence of a live fetus, and confirmation of complete evacuation by ultrasound.\r"

One hundred fourteen patients with open-angle glaucoma were randomly assigned to one of two groups. In one group (55 patients), filtering surgery was performed without the use of Healon. In the remaining 59 patients, Healon was used to separate the iris from the cleft, the sclera from the sclera and the conjunctiva from the sclera. The surgical procedure used was the Stallard-Worst triangular modification of Cairns' method, combined with removal of the Tenon's capsule. The patients whose operations were performed with the aid of Healon had a higher success rate, as manifested by better and more permanent bleb formation and maintenance, more open clefts, less scarring, less peripheral anterior synechiae formation, and significantly lower long-term intraocular pressure. Moreover, the number of patients requiring supplemental postoperative timolol therapy was significantly smaller in the Healon group (5/59 patients: 8.5%) than in the control group (33/55 patients: 60%). There was a transient delay in the reduction of intraocular pressure following trabeculectomy in the Healon patients which was not observed in control patients. Apart from this, no adverse effects were associated with the use of Healon.\r"

In hypertensive choroidopathy, retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) lesions and serous retinal detachment (RD) were the classic ophthalmoscopic lesions, whereas fluorescein fundus angiography and histopathologic studies revealed marked abnormalities in the choroidal vascular bed, in addition to the changes in the RPE. The RPE lesions could be subdivided into initial acute focal lesions (due to focal RPE infarction), and degenerative lesions, which developed later and were progressive in nature, maximally involving the macular and peripheral regions of the fundus. The RD developed most commonly in the posterior pole and infrequently involved the peripheral retina. The choroidal vascular bed showed impaired circulation and extensive occlusive and ischemic changes. These studies revealed that hypertensive choroidopathy is as important a fundus change as hypertensive retinopathy. The pathogenesis of hypertensive choroidopathy is discussed in detail; the evidence indicates that it is due to choroidal ischemia, and that hypertensive choroidopathy and retinopathy are two independent and unrelated manifestations of renovascular malignant hypertension.\r"

Immune precipitation of radiolabeled VZ proteins by these sera followed by gel fractionation yielded radioimmune precipitation profiles characteristic of a recent zoster reactivation.

The eyes were treated by cryopexy to the avascular retina. Analysis of the visual function and anatomic results in these eyes, five to eight years postoperatively, revealed very good visual function and only a few anatomic abnormalities. Comparison of these eyes with those of two groups of age- and birth-weight-matched preterms (one with less severe ROP, not treated by cryopexy, and the other with no ROP) showed that the degree of myopia was significantly higher in the cryotreated group. Although not statistically significant, there was a higher incidence and a greater degree of astigmatism in this study group.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-four patients (70 eyes, 220 sea fans) with proliferative sickle retinopathy (PSR) received peripheral circumferential retinal scatter photocoagulation (PCRP) to the peripheral zones of retinal capillary nonperfusion. With an average follow-up of 3.3 years, 33% of preexisting sea fans regressed completely, 46% regressed partially, 19% remained stable, and 2% showed progression. De novo neovascularization developed after treatment in only one eye (1.4%). Ninety-five percent of patients treated had a final visual acuity of 20/30 or better and only one patient (2%) developed a nonresolving vitreous hemorrhage requiring vitrectomy surgery. These results confirm the authors' previous report and continue to compare favorably to the natural history of PSR in which de novo lesions developed in 58%, and 12% of eyes ended with a visual acuity of 20/200 or less. PCRP seems preferable to other techniques in reducing the risk of nonresolving vitreous hemorrhage and/or traction retinal detachment, although randomized controlled studies are needed to conclusively assess the safety and efficacy of this strategy in treating PSR.\r"

Light and electron microscopic examination of two additional eyes obtained postmortem from an acute case of Terson's syndrome revealed that the posterior vitreous face was elevated by blood and that the internal limiting membrane of the retina was intact and in its normal position. In two chronic cases, a dome-shaped epiretinal membrane was excised from the macula during vitrectomy. Light and ultrastructural studies demonstrated that the membranes consisted of glial cells and basement membrane material. The dome-shaped structure observed in eyes with Terson's syndrome is due to the formation of a subhyaloid hemorrhage. The partially detached posterior hyaloid face created by this hemorrhage provides a scaffold for cellular proliferation and the development of an elevated epiretinal membrane in long-standing cases. Echographically, this membrane resembles a retinal detachment in B-scans, but can be clearly distinguished from retina with standardized A-scan.\r"

Light microscopy revealed a loss of photoreceptor cells primarily in the peripheral retina and macula, with relative preservation of both rod and cone cells in the equatorial area. Electron microscopy showed abundant lipofuscin-like granules aggregated in the basal portion of the retinal pigment epithelial cells. In the macular area, many retinal pigment epithelial cells were atrophic. The phagocytic capacity of the retinal pigment epithelium appeared to remain intact. The accumulation of lipofuscin-like granules in the retinal pigment epithelium may be one of the significant pathologic changes of this dystrophy.\r"

Accordingly, the authors suggest the use of the term \"Laurence-Moon-Bardet-Biedl phenotype\" until these syndromes can be defined in some other manner. The neuroradiologic studies document atrophy of the cerebellum that accounts for the ataxia. Electroretinograms (ERG) demonstrate the decline in retinal function over a 16-year interval and the delayed cone ERG b-wave implicit time with normal cone amplitudes to 30 Hz white flicker that can exist in the early stage of this disorder.\r"

A critical analysis of the principles of cross cylinder testing reveals several important features which should be understood for the proper use of this device. For example, a rarely discussed shortcoming of the cross cylinder is that it can fail to detect even large amounts of ocular astigmatism in certain situations. A little-known advantage of the cross cylinder, on the other hand, is its use in refining cylinder power at an incorrect axis. This particular property of the cross cylinder is useful when the correcting cylinder axis must be rotated toward 90 degrees, 180 degrees, or toward the old axis. The cross cylinder can be used to determine the optimal cylinder power for this new axis setting. Guidelines are also considered for the appropriate step sizes in axis rotation that should be used in cylinder axis refinement.\r"

Fluorescein angiography has become so important for diagnostic purposes and for laser management that it has become a standard technique in the authors' most carefully performed clinical research studies such as randomized clinical trials. These clinical trials demand fluorescein angiography not only for diagnosis and eligibility of patients, but also to document the adequacy of laser photocoagulation. The use of fluorescein angiography has encouraged the development of newer photographic techniques and has encouraged a commendable level of expertise among photographers. Experience with fluorescein angiography in clinical trials has led to the development of general guidelines for the use of angiography for the management of patients outside the confines of a clinical trial; we emphasize the importance of recent angiography as a general guideline for all patients with macular edema or choroidal neovascularization before consideration of laser photocoagulation.\r"

Its beneficial effect on prolonging survival, however, is countered by its frequent delayed complication of retinal toxicity and severe visual loss, which reportedly occurs in approximately 70% of the patients. Since this complication probably results from increased flow of the drug into the ophthalmic artery, the authors have attempted to infuse BCNU via a small intracarotid catheter advanced beyond the origin of the ophthalmic artery. In a series of nine patients (average follow-ups, 10.7 months), the authors were successful in treating six patients with exclusively supraophthalmic infusions. None of these patients developed any ocular toxicity. From the remaining three patients, two patients received one infraophthalmic infusion with no retinal toxicity. The third patient, however, who received three infraophthalmic infusions, developed ipsilateral retinopathy. These results suggest that retinopathic complications of intracarotid BCNU can be avoided if the infusion catheter is advanced beyond the origin of the ophthalmic artery.\r"

The epithelial cells in these areas contained many vacuolations and a thickened basement membrane. Hemidesmosomes were decreased in number. The tissue lenses had been cut 1.5 mm larger in diameter than the trephined recipient bed into which they were placed. Excess tissue lens material in the central area may have been thrown into folds by mechanical pressure, resulting in the histological changes, clinical signs, and optical distortion that necessitated removal of these grafts. Recently, the surgical technique has been modified, in an attempt to eliminate this problem.\r"

Ptosis is a well-known complication of cataract extraction, but has not been reported following radial keratotomy. Unlike cataract extraction, radial keratotomy does not require anesthetic injections, bridle sutures, or conjunctival flaps. The rigid Knapp eyelid speculum used in these cases remains as the only apparent cause of eyelid trauma and subsequent ptosis. During radial keratotomy, the speculum was opened widely in order to provide good corneal exposure and avoid contact with the diamond knife. Contraction of the orbicularis oculi muscle against the rigid speculum may have traumatized the lid, resulting in a levator aponeurosis disinsertion and subsequent ptosis.\r"

Bacterial keratitis, often recurrent and bilateral, and progressive sterile corneal stromal melting developed in six autoantibody-positive ATD patients. Eight antibody-positive patients had labial salivary or lacrimal gland biopsies, and all showed similar histologic features with marked destruction of the glandular architecture by lymphocytic infiltration. Immunoglobulin and complement were not detected in the glandular tissue. Circumstantial evidence suggests that an abnormal immunologic reaction, possibly related to Epstein-Barr viral (EBV) infection, is the cause of the glandular destruction and tear deficiency.\r"

At least a six-month follow-up was available on 84 patients, of whom four were excluded from the analysis of surgical outcome because they suffered retinal detachments within six months of their filtering surgery. The initial 5-FU procedures on the remaining 80 patients were successful (no further glaucoma surgical procedures were either performed or recommended, and the intraocular pressures [IOPs] were either 21 mmHg or lower with ocular hypotensive medication[s] or 25 mmHg or lower without ocular hypotensive medication) in 33 (68%) of the 48 aphakic eyes with non-neovascular glaucomas, 13 (81%) of the 16 phakic eyes with non-neovascular glaucomas after unsuccessful filtering surgery, and 12 (75%) of the 16 eyes with neovascular glaucoma (NVG). The follow-up on the successful eyes ranged from 6 to 34 months (mean +/- SD = 18.5 +/- 7.5). The visual acuities remained within one line of their preoperative levels or improved in 38 (79%) of the 48 aphakic eyes with non-neovascular glaucoma, 11 (69%) of the 16 phakic eyes with non-neovascular glaucoma after unsuccessful filtering surgery, and 12 (75%) of the 16 eyes with NVG. The initial 5-FU procedures on the 104 eyes were complicated by the following: corneal epithelial defects (50%); conjunctival wound and suture tract leaks (36%; 2% underwent surgical repair); suprachoroidal hemorrhages (9%); retinal detachments (3%); subepithelial corneal scarring (3%); endophthalmitis (2%); and malignant glaucoma (1%). It is the authors' impression that postoperative subconjunctival 5-FU increases the likelihood of achieving IOP control after filtering surgery in eyes with poor surgical prognoses; however, a randomized clinical trial is necessary to confirm this impression.\r"

Superficial lesions consist of isolated multicystic vascular abnormalities of cosmetic significance only. Deep orbital lymphangiomas present as spontaneous, acute proptosis due to retrobulbar hemorrhage. Combined lesions demonstrate both superficial and deep components and are also characterized by spontaneous hemorrhages. Histopathologically, lymphangiomas represent a spectrum of vascular hamartomas with a constellation of features that parallels the clinical progression and histology of similar lesions elsewhere in the head and neck. This may include the presence of diaphanous serous-filled vascular channels, a connective tissue stroma with lymphorrhages, features of old hemorrhage, dysplastic vessels, and random smooth muscle bundles. Both direct and indirect evidence suggests that these lesions are characterized by relative hemodynamic isolation.\r"

A quantitative method to measure the development of drusen is needed for controlled studies of the natural history, prognosis, and treatment of ARM. An objective method is described using computer image analysis of fundus photographs for the detection and measurement of drusen. This technique enables us to measure both the area of drusen in the macula and the changes in the drusen pattern over time. Evaluation of repeated photographs showed reproducibility of 6.1%, whereas the reproducibility of processing photographic duplicates was 2.3%. Digitization with a high-quality linear array solid state camera did not change reproducibility significantly.\r"

  ".W": "Reported are 15 cases of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) complicated by massive subretinal and/or vitreous hemorrhage. Clinicopathologic correlation is presented in four of the seven cases studied histopathologically. Salient histologic findings include: subretinal and subretinal pigment epithelium (sub-RPE) fibrovascular scar in the posterior pole; discontinuities in Bruch's membrane with choroidal neovascularization; extensive hemorrhagic detachment of the RPE and sensory retina; and vitreous hemorrhage. In three cases, a choroidal artery, emerging from breaks in Bruch's membrane, had ruptured walls. The authors have reviewed the previously reported cases of AMD complicated by massive hemorrhage and found that 19% of the patients were taking Coumadin (warfarin) or aspirin treatment when the bleeding occurred. Forty percent had a positive history of systemic hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. Although the occurrence of hypertension is expected in the aged population with AMD, use of anticoagulants or antithrombotics by such patients may predispose them to serious ocular hemorrhagic complications.\r"

  ".W": "A complete analysis of the components of refractive error was performed on ten eyes of five patients with myopia and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). In comparison to an age-matched control group, these eyes exhibited both lenticular and axial myopia. Only the high crystalline lens powers, which ranged from 22.20 to 44.13 diopters (D) (mean value, 31.27 D), were found to be statistically significant. In two patients, only one eye had high myopia. The lens power in these eyes was approximately 11 D more powerful than the lens of the fellow eye. Further investigation into the ocular changes induced by prematurity and abnormal oxygen metabolism is needed to determine the reason for the high degree of lenticular myopia.\r"

One patient with peripheral retinal neovascularization also had rubeosis and neovascular glaucoma. The effects of relative hyperoxia on the retinal microcirculation in retinitis pigmentosa as well as intraocular inflammation may account for such changes. Laser photocoagulation appears effective in preventing vitreous hemorrhage in these patients, but systemic administration of corticosteroids did not cause the new vessels to regress.\r"
