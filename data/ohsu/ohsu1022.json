This CG-like material is estimated to comprise 0.17%, by weight, of the LH and reacts in specific, sequential-type, two-monoclonal antibody, immunoradiometric assays for CG as well as in the carboxyl-tail CG RIA. The CG-like material is not separable from LH by size exclusion or ion exchange chromatography. The LH can be freed of this small contamination of CG-like material by immunopurification employing specific monoclonal antibodies. Sephadex G-100 chromatography shows this material to have a mol wt of 40.0K. Western blot analysis of the LH run under nonreducing conditions, using an anti-CG carboxyl-tail primary antibody, reveals two bands of this CG-like material, one at 60.8K and one at 50.7K. When electrophoresed under reducing conditions, the material reacts with the anti-CG carboxyl-tail antibody at several mol wt, ranging from 10.5-64K.\r"

  ".W": "Bone mineral density (BMD) was studied in young exercising amenorrheic girls to determine if density was compromised and the change related to injury. Ninety-eight volunteers (professional ballet dancers and controls) were studied in a cross-sectional study. Dancers and controls were further subdivided into normally cycling and amenorrheic subjects. Amenorrhea significantly lowered bone density of the spine (P less than 0.0001), wrist (P less than 0.03), and metatarsal (P less than 0.01); effects on the wrist were eliminated by controlling for age while controlling for weight eliminated all effects of amenorrhea at three sites. BMD of the metatarsal, a weight-bearing bone, showed an interaction between amenorrhea and dancing (exercising) P less than 0.035); surprisingly, dancing was associated with a further lowering of bone density. This interaction was eliminated when controlling for age, but not when controlling for weight. With multiple comparisons of the groups, spine, wrist, and metatarsal bone density was significantly lower in amenorrheic dancers when compared to normal dancers (P less than 0.05), even when controlling for age and weight in the metatarsal (P less than 0.05), and age in the spine (P less than 0.05). Estradiol levels correlated with bone density of both the wrist and the spine (r = 0.25, r = 0.23, P less than 0.02). Metatarsal density correlated with estradiol levels only in the dancers (r = 0.34, P less than 0.02). The only variable found to correlate with the occurrence of stress fractures was age of menarche. This was also the only variable of 9 (BMD of the wrist, spine or foot, calories ingested and expended, amount of calcium ingested, involvement in high energy activity, age of menarche or presence of amenorrhea) to predict stress fractures. Thus, BMD is significantly affected by the presence of amenorrhea but the effects are generally weight dependent. The compensatory increase in bone density generally seen in stressed bones, such as the metatarsal in ballet dancers, is deficient in amenorrheic premenopausal women even when controlling for weight but this effect may be age and estrogen dependent. Bone mass may not accumulate in the same manner in adolescents as in the mature women, thus putting them at risk for injury.\r"

To study the precise temporal relationship between GH secretory episodes and cortical activity, GH measurements and electroencephalogram sleep stage recordings were performed every 30 s for 8 h in six young male volunteers fasted for 24 h. GH was measured in two drops of whole blood, which were directly sampled into the assay tube using a continuous blood withdrawal pump and a fraction collector. Concomitant serum sampling during a GH-releasing hormone test (n = 4) revealed a high correlation (r = 0.98) between GH measurements in serum and whole blood. GH pulses were objectively identified with Cluster analysis, and GH secretion rates were calculated with a waveform-independent deconvolution algorithm. When data were analyzed as replicates with 1-min intervals, the nocturnal pulse frequency was 1.2 pulses/h. Elimination of data points demonstrated 43% and 64% reductions in the number of GH pulses detected for 5- and 20-min sampling intervals, respectively. Mean GH concentrations and secretory rates were significantly higher during stage 3 and 4 sleep compared to stage 1, 2, and rapid eye movement sleep. GH secretory rates and peripheral GH concentrations were maximally correlated with sleep stage, with lags of 4.5 and 16 min, respectively, suggesting that maximal GH release occurs within minutes of the onset of stage 3 or 4 sleep. This temporal coincidence between pituitary GH secretion and delta sleep is consistent with cortical control over hypothalamic-pituitary function.\r"

A remarkable increase in serum inhibin was observed from 4 to 38 weeks of pregnancy. The mean serum inhibin level was 1.58 U/mL at 4 weeks. Thereafter, inhibin levels increased progressively with the weeks of pregnancy (r = 0.988; P less than 0.001). In the midterm of pregnancy, serum inhibin was elevated at average levels of 2.84 and 3.84 U/mL at 20 and 28 weeks, respectively. The peak level of inhibin (5.33 U/mL) was obtained at 38 weeks, which was an increase of 237% compared to that at 4 weeks. The average rate of increase in serum inhibin levels was 14.51% every 2-4 weeks (ranging from 8.1-20%). These findings suggest that circulating inhibin is useful marker during human pregnancy.\r"

We have measured the onset and loss of insulin action on glucose transport in adipocytes obtained from obese nondiabetic and obese NIDDM subjects to determine the contributions of obesity and diabetes to these cellular defects in insulin action. Basal and maximally insulin-stimulated rates of 3-O-methylglucose transport in adipocytes from obese and obese NIDDM subjects were reduced to 50% of the values in cells from normal subjects (P less than 0.05). The activation of glucose transport by insulin (4.3 nmol/L) was slower in cells from obese NIDDM patients. Half of the maximal insulin effect (A50) was reached by 23.0 +/- 5.0 min compared to 9.4 +/- 1.1 min in normal cells (P less than 0.05). Conversely, the deactivation of insulin-stimulated glucose transport upon removal of insulin was more rapid in adipocytes from the obese and obese NIDDM subjects. Half of the maximal insulin effect (D50) was lost by 12.4 +/- 1.7 min in obese NIDDM cells and by 8.9 +/- 1.9 min in obese subjects compared to 25.3 +/- 1.9 min in adipocytes from normal subjects (P less than 0.01). In conclusion, 1) basal and insulin-stimulated rates of glucose transport are similarly reduced in adipocytes from obese and obese NIDDM subjects; and 2) adipocytes from obese and obese NIDDM subjects display defects in the kinetics of insulin action, slower activation and accelerated deactivation, that mirror the defects measured in vivo. Both impairments in the kinetics of insulin action may contribute to the insulin resistance in these subject groups.\r"

  ".W": "Extreme pharmacological elevation of the circulating insulin level acutely lowers dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels. To assess whether more physiological elevations in plasma insulin (due to exogenous infusion or endogenous secretion) would have similar effects, we examined the levels of DHEAS, androstenedione, testosterone, and free testosterone before and after euglycemic hyperinsulinemic and hyperglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp studies. Studies were performed in women within 20% of ideal body weight after an overnight fast. Androgen levels were measured before and at the conclusion of studies in which either insulin was infused exogenously at 1 mU/kg.min or endogenous insulin secretion was stimulated for 2 h by elevation of the plasma glucose concentration by 125 mg/dL above basal levels by an exogenous glucose infusion. Basal plasma DHEAS (6.2 +/- 0.5 mumol/L) declined to 5.2 +/- 0.4 mumol/L (P less than 0.001) during the euglycemic insulin clamp, without any significant change in testosterone, free testosterone, or androstenedione. During the hyperglycemic clamp, DHEAS fell from 6.7 +/- 0.5 to 5.1 +/- 0.4 mumol/L (P less than 0.001) in response to endogenous hyperinsulinemia; plasma testosterone, free testosterone, and androstenedione did not change significantly. There was no correlation between the elevation in plasma insulin concentration and the fall in DHEAS during either the euglycemic or hyperglycemic clamps. However, the magnitude of fall of DHEAS was directly correlated with the initial DHEAS level in both the euglycemic (r = 0.51; P less than 0.05) and hyperglycemic (r = 0.75; P less than 0.01) studies. This association of hyperinsulinemia with a reduction of circulating levels of DHEAS, but not other C-19 steroids (e.g. testosterone and androstenedione) may reflect differential mechanisms by which DHEAS levels are regulated and suggests that insulin either inhibits its biosynthesis and/or secretion, or enhances its MCR.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the diagnostic potential of a highly sensitive immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) for LH in children with normal puberty or altered tempo of sexual maturation, we compared serum LH levels by IRMA (LH IRMA) and standard RIA (LH RIA) in children with idiopathic precocious thelarche (IPT; n = 6), idiopathic premature adrenarche (IPA; n = 14), central precocious puberty (CPP; n = 15), and constitutional delay of puberty (DP; n = 15), and 160 control children (79 males and 81 females). Subjects in the latter group were staged, according to their genital or breast development, as early prepubertal (P1E; age, less than 8 yr), late prepubertal (P1L; 8-12 yr), or stage II-V (P2-P5; n = 22-34 for each subgroup). Serum LH IRMA levels in P1E, IPT, and IPA children were either undetectable (95% of subjects less than 0.25 IU/L) or barely detectable (5% of subjects, less than or equal to 0.5 IU/L). Serum LH IRMA levels were greater than 0.5 IU/L in 38% of P1L (mean +/- SD for the group, 1.0 +/- 1.3 IU/L) and 57% of P2 (1.4 +/- 1.3 IU/L); they were greater than 1.0 IU/L in 100% of P3 (2.6 +/- 1.3 IU/L), P4 (3.9 +/- 2 IU/L), and P5 (8.6 +/- 4 IU/L) children. Comparison of serum LH levels between contiguous pubertal stages showed significantly higher LH IRMA concentrations in P3 vs. P1E, P4 vs. P2, P5 vs. P4 (all P less than 0.001), and P3 vs. P1L (P less than 0.05). In contrast, LH RIA values were not significantly different in P1E (2.0 +/- 0.6 IU/L), P1L (2.3 +/- 0.6 IU/L), P2 (2.7 +/- 0.9 IU/L), P3 (3.2 +/- 1.3 IU/L), and P4 (3.7 +/- 2.2 IU/L), although they were higher in P5 (6.8 +/- 4 IU/L) than in P4 (P less than 0.001). From P1E to P5 LH IRMA levels increased 38-fold in females and 21-fold in males, while LH RIA increased 4- and 2.1-fold, respectively. Serum LH IRMA correlated significantly with serum testosterone levels in boys from P1L to P5 (r = 0.76; P less than 0.001), while LH RIA levels did not (r = 0.18). Serum LH IRMA concentrations were above the prepubertal range (greater than 0.5 IU/L) in 67% of children with CPP (group average, 1.8 +/- 1.4 IU/L) and 87% of children with DP (1.6 +/- 1.4 IU/L).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Two genes in the human genome (H1 and H2) code for two polypeptides significantly different in amino acid sequence. The full spectrum of biological activities of these two polypeptides has not been examined, but transcription appears to be limited to the H2 relaxin gene in the human corpus luteum. Relaxin is also synthesized by the human decidua, placental trophoblast, and prostate gland; therefore, the expression of the human relaxin genes in these tissues has been examined using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The mRNA from decidua, placental trophoblast, and prostate was reverse transcribed and then amplified by polymerase chain reaction, using a series of oligonucleotide primers that were specific for but would not distinguish between human H1 and H2 relaxins. Using mRNA from these tissues, two amplified cDNA species were detected, whose identities were confirmed by Southern blots, HpaI and HpaII restriction enzyme analysis, and dideoxy sequencing. We have confirmed that the corpus luteum does not contain detectable H1 relaxin mRNA. However, we demonstrated for the first time relaxin H1 gene expression in the decidua, placental trophoblast, and prostate, and we have also shown that there are marked tissue differences in the relative amounts of expression of the H1 and H2 relaxin mRNA forms. The functional significance is unknown, but if both mRNAs are translated, differential expression of the two genes may result in tissue-specific differences in the production of these relaxins as well as in their binding and actions.\r"

We have examined the developmental pattern of IGF-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1), -2, and -3 in serum by Western ligand blotting, the levels of IGFBP-3, IGF-I, and IGF-II in serum by RIA, and the IGFBP mRNA levels of IGFBP-1, -2, and -3 in the livers of rhesus monkeys from fetal life through adulthood by Northern analysis. The pattern of the serum levels of the IGFBPs reflected the liver mRNA levels of the IGFBPs. The IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2 liver mRNA and serum levels were highest in the fetus and first year of life and were very low after 4 yr of age. Conversely, the IGFBP-3 liver mRNA and serum levels were relatively low early in life and peaked during puberty. The serum levels of IGF-I and IGF-II were strongly correlated with the level of IGFBP-3. We conclude that the developmental pattern of IGFBPs in the rhesus monkey is similar to that in the human, and that serum IGFBP levels are probably regulated by the rate of IGFBP mRNA synthesis.\r"

We studied the responses of three groups of women throughout a control cycle and during the administration of a potent GnRH antagonist, detirelix ([N-Ac-D-Nal(2)1,D-pCl-Phe2,D-Trp3,D-hArg(Et2)6,D-Ala10++ +] GnRH, Syntex Research). Detirelix (10 mg, sc) was administered for 3 consecutive days during the midfollicular phase (n = 4), preovulatory phase (n = 4), and early luteal phase (n = 4). The pituitary response to detirelix was similar throughout the three phases of the menstrual cycle. Immunoreactive LH concentrations decreased to 35% (mean +/- SEM) of pretreatment values within 8 h after the initial injection and remained suppressed for 72 h after discontinuance of treatment. Immunoreactive FSH concentrations decreased to 73 +/- 3% of pretreatment levels within 8 h and returned to baseline within 24 h after the third injection. In contrast, the ovarian response to detirelix varied markedly during different phases of the cycle. Midfollicular phase treatment was associated with a decline in estradiol (E2) levels from pretreatment values of 246 +/- 48 to 81 +/- 15 pmol/L within 24 h of the last injection. Vaginal bleeding ensued in three of four women. Follicular recruitment was then reinitiated, and an ovulatory LH surge occurred 18.2 +/- 2.9 days after the last injection. Similarly, treatment during the early luteal phase produced a decline in E2 concentrations from 286 +/- 29 to 70 +/- 7 pmol/L and a decline in progesterone concentrations from 20 +/- 1.6 to 1.9 +/- 0.3 nmol/L within 24 h after the last injection. Luteolysis was associated with menstrual bleeding in all four women. The subsequent ovulatory LH surge occurred 16.5 +/- 1.0 days after discontinuance of treatment. In contrast, treatment during the preovulatory phase resulted in a decline in E2 concentrations from 844 +/- 66 to 429 +/- 132 pmol/L during the first 48 h of treatment. Gonadotropin and E2 concentrations subsequently recovered from suppression, growth of the dominant follicle resumed, and a LH surge occurred 5.8 +/- 1.4 days after the last injection. These data indicate that the GnRH antagonist detirelix produces rapid and consistent suppression of pituitary gonadotropin secretion. The magnitude of suppression and preferential suppression of LH vs. FSH are similar throughout the cycle. In contrast, the ovarian response to gonadotropin deprivation varies during the menstrual cycle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

They were matched for age, pubertal staging, body mass index, and glycohemoglobin levels. During a 1.7 mU/kg.min hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, the insulin-mediated glucose disposal rate was lower (26.9 +/- 2.1 vs. 47.1 +/- 3.7 mumol/kg.min; P less than 0.001), and GH levels were higher (6.5 +/- 1.2 vs. 2.9 +/- 0.8 micrograms/L; P = 0.03) in females than in males. Plasma glucagon, cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine levels during the clamp were similar in the two sexes, except for pancreatic polypeptide, which showed a tendency to be higher in females (19 +/- 4 vs. 11 +/- 1 pmol/L; P = 0.07). During insulin-induced hypoglycemia, the rate of drop in plasma glucose was faster (0.16 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.11 +/- 0.01 mmol/L.min; P = 0.001), and the rate of glucose recovery was slower in males than in females (0.04 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.06 +/- 0.01 mmol/L.min; P = 0.05). Plasma glucose concentrations were lower in males than in females (glucose nadir, 2.3 +/- 0.2 vs. 3.3 +/- 0.2 mmol/L; P = 0.002; glucose peak, 3.7 +/- 0.2 vs. 5.3 +/- 0.4 mmol/L; P = 0.002), with similar plasma free insulin concentrations. Despite a greater degree of hypoglycemia, GH responses were lower in males than in females. The remaining counterregulatory hormone responses were similar in both sexes. We conclude that there is a distinct sexual dimorphism in insulin sensitivity in adolescents with IDDM. This is likely to be due to sex-related differences in GH levels. Furthermore, male patients with IDDM are apt to develop greater degrees of hypoglycemia accompanied by lower GH responses.\r"

The GnRH antagonist detirelix ([N-Ac-D-Nal(2)1,D-pCl-Phe2,D-Trp3,D-hArg(Et2)6,D-Ala10++ +] GnRH; Syntex Research) was administered to six women by sc injection on alternate days during a 27-day period. Six additional women underwent blood sampling only, without receiving detirelix. Within 8 h after the initial injection of detirelix, mean (+/- SEM) serum LH and FSH concentrations decreased by 74 +/- 2% and 26 +/- 3%, respectively. Mean immunoreactive FSH levels, however, returned to baseline after the first 72 h despite continued administration of detirelix. Mean estradiol (E2) concentrations decreased from 165 +/- 15 to 70 +/- 11 pmol/L in the first 24 h. During the treatment period follicular development was inhibited, and none of the six volunteers showed evidence of ovulation, as assessed by serum progesterone (P) levels. Maximal suppression of serum LH and E2 was observed approximately 24 h after each injection of detirelix. Compared to the control volunteers, those receiving detirelix had significantly lower mean serum LH (P less than 0.001), E2 (P less than 0.001), and P (P less than 0.001) levels during treatment; mean FSH concentrations, however, were not statistically different in the treatment and control groups. Rapid recovery of pituitary-ovarian function occurred after completion of treatment. In all six volunteers receiving detirelix, a LH surge occurred 10-16 days after the final injection, followed by increased P levels (greater than 32 nmol/L), indicating ovulation and a luteal phase of normal duration (12-14 days). Detirelix injections elicited local skin reactions (erythema and pruritus), but no systemic side-effects were observed. Thus, this long-acting GnRH antagonist can rapidly suppress gonadotropin secretion, inhibit follicular development, and prevent ovulation.\r"

We used the vitamin A fat-loading test to label triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles of intestinal origin after ingestion of a high fat mixed meal containing 60 g fat/m2 and 60,000 U vitamin A/m2 in 12 untreated NIDDM subjects with normotriglyceridemia (NTG; triglycerides, less than 1.7 mmol/L), 7 untreated NIDDM subjects with moderate hypertriglyceridemia (HTG; triglycerides, 1.7-4.7 mmol/L), and 8 age- and weight-matched normotriglyceridemic nondiabetic controls. The postprandial triglyceride increment was greater in NIDDM with HTG (P = 0.0001) and correlated strongly in all groups with the fasting triglyceride concentration (r = 0.83; P = 0.0001). Retinyl palmitate measured in whole plasma, an Sf greater than 1000 chylomicron fraction, and an Sf less than 1000 nonchylomicron fraction was also significantly greater in NIDDM with HTG, but did not differ significantly between NIDDM with NTG and controls. In NIDDM with HTG, chylomicrons appeared to be cleared at a slower rate, as evidenced by the significantly later intersection of the chylomicron and nonchylomicron retinyl palmitate response curves (13.7 h in HTG NIDDM vs. 8.5 h in NTG NIDDM vs. 7.3 h in controls; P less than 0.01). Although fasting FFA levels were similar in all three groups, the HTG diabetic subjects had a late postprandial surge in FFAs that lasted for up to 14 h. The postprandial FFA elevation in all groups correlated with the fasting triglyceride concentration (r = 0.57; P less than 0.002) and postprandial triglyceride increment (r = 0.80; P = 0.0001). The fasting core triglyceride content of the HDL particles in NIDDM with HTG was significantly elevated compared to those in NIDDM with NTG and controls (21.0% vs. 14.0% vs. 14.1% respectively; P less than 0.05), and this increased proportionately in all groups after the meal at the expense of cholesteryl ester, the increase correlating with total plasma postprandial triglyceride increment (r = 0.51; P less than 0.01). We conclude that moderate fasting hypertriglyceridemia in NIDDM is predictive of a constellation of postprandial changes in lipids and lipoproteins that may potentiate the already unfavorable atherogenic fasting lipid profile in these subjects.\r"

  ".W": "Ether link cleavage (ELC) of T4 yielding diiodotyrosine (DIT) has recently been shown in vitro to be the major pathway of T4 metabolism in phagocytosing leukocytes. To evaluate this pathway in vivo and the possible clinical relevance of DIT measurements in diseases with increased leukocyte activity, radioimmunological studies on serum levels of DIT and other thyroid parameters were performed in 125 critically ill patients classified into 3 groups with bacterial infections according to the severity of infection and 1 group without infections. While the pattern of iodothyronine and TSH levels typical for severe nonthyroidal disorders, i.e. decreased total T3 and elevated rT3, normal or decreased total T4 and TSH, and normal free T4, was found in all four groups of intensive care patients studied, elevated serum DIT was observed only in those patients whose clinical course was complicated by severe bacterial infections. Serial measurements revealed a close temporal connection between the infection phase and increased DIT levels. Median values and 16th to 84th percentile ranges (in parentheses) of serum DIT (normal range, 0.02-0.55 nmol/L) were as follows: sepsis, 1.38 (0.32-5.14); severe nonsystemic infections such as peritonitis and abscesses, 3.84 (0.24-17.2); moderate infections such as pneumonia and tracheobronchitis, 0.44 (0.18-1.16); and critical illness without infections, 0.14 (0.08-0.30) nmol/L. These elevations of circulating DIT could neither be correlated with changes in renal function nor attributed to drug effects. The results of the present study do not allow any definitive conclusions to be made about the mechanisms underlying the phenomenon of increased serum DIT levels in infections. Apart from this open question, DIT appears to be a relatively specific serum parameter for the presence and course of severe bacterial inflammations. Its measurement could provide useful clinical information, particularly for monitoring the time course of deep-seated infections.\r"

Fibrel treatment was restricted to one or two implants in a maximum of four scars. The scar corrections were evaluated by the physician, the patient, and also via an objective photogrammetric method. At the end of 1 year the percentage of scars with moderate, marked, or complete correction were 65, 63.3, and 85.8% according to physician, patient, and photogrammetric evaluations, respectively. A cohort of 111 patients were followed for up to 2 years and 87 patients were followed up to 5 years postimplantation. The physician and patient evaluations showed 55.1 and 50.6%, respectively, of the scars in the moderate, marked, or complete correction category at the end of 5 years with only one or two treatments. Safety evaluations included tests for antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, and presence of antibodies to Fibrel and their crossreactivity to human collagen I and III. These tests did not show any causal relationship to Fibrel treatments and the patients did not have any untoward immunologic symptoms. The data from these patients demonstrate that one or two Fibrel treatments are effective in maintaining greater than 50% correction of depressed cutaneous scars up to 5 years with negligible adverse sequelae and no untoward immunologic symptoms.\r"

The hair-bearing \"serrated island\" remaining between two parallel rows of round donor sites can be removed and dissected to yield a large number of \"serrated island grafts\" and single-hair grafts. These miniature grafts, along with half grafts from bisected plugs, can be placed, in one or several sessions, into dozens to hundreds of small \"slits\" between the remaining hairs in patients with early or advanced thinning on the crown, vertex, or anterior scalp--hence the name \"slit grafting.\" The versatility of this technique is demonstrated by its value for patients with dark hair and light skin, in repair work, in patients necessitating extensive vertex coverage, or in combination with alopecia reduction and traditional punch grafting. The finely tufted progressive growth from hundreds of these carefully placed slit grafts can thus counteract further hair loss in a variety of different situations.\r"

These tools allow for the rapid fenestration and selective abrasion of large areas of exposed bone; fenestration and abrasion create the multiple bleeding points essential for the production of granulation tissue. The granulation tissue thus produced is allowed to grow out through the holes to cover bone. This procedure can be performed in an outpatient setting, usually without the need for either local or general anesthesia; it is particularly useful for patients considered to be poor risks for general anesthesia. Healing by granulation tissue is a somewhat slow process, but it has a high success rate, causes few complications, and produces very good cosmetic results. Two cases illustrate the method of fenestration of exposed cranial bone to stimulate granulation tissue. Specific instructions describe the needed care of exposed bone.\r"

Atypical reactions can also occur, but their temporal behavior and frequency are unknown. We analyzed 69 bronchospastic reactions after exposure to three types of occupational sensitizers in the laboratory: isocyanates, western red cedar, and IgE sensitizing agents. Graphs of the reactions were presented to three observers in a blind, randomized way. Reactions were defined as follows: (1) typical patterns, that is, isolated immediate, early late, late, and dual, as put forward by Pepys and Hutchcroft, and (2) atypical patterns including progressive (onset, during, or minutes after exposure, progressing to a maximum reaction 5 to 6 hours later) and square waved (similar to a dual reaction but with only partial recovery [less than 10%] between the immediate and late falls in FEV1). Some curves were also analyzed by polynomial regression. The three observers agreed in 59/69 cases (86%), and a consensus was reached after discussion for the remaining subjects. Fifteen of 63 (22%) reactions were atypical. IgE-mediated reactions and reactions to red cedar were, respectively, mainly of the immediate and late types. The distribution of reactions to isocyanates, however, was significantly different (chi-square, 6.1; p = 0.01), the \"progressive\" pattern occurring in 7/23 instances (30%). There was a satisfactory concordance between visual assessment and polynomial fit analysis in distinguishing dual from square-waved reactions. We conclude that isocyanates frequently cause atypical progressive bronchospastic reactions that are rarely observed after exposure to IgE agents and western red cedar.\r"

RAST, and bronchoprovocation tests, of 309 employees working in a reactive-dye industry. Our survey revealed that 78 (25.2%) employees had work-related lower respiratory symptoms associated with or without nasal, skin, or eye symptoms. Among these employees, 38 (48.7%) had nonspecific bronchial reactivity. Thirteen demonstrated immediate (6), dual (6), or late only (1) asthmatic responses after inhalation of four kinds of reactive-dye solutions. Twenty-five employees demonstrated immediate skin responses to black GR dye, and 21 reacted to orange 3R. Fifty-three employees (17%) had specific serum IgE antibody against black GR and orange 3R-human serum albumin conjugate. Specific IgE was detected more frequently in symptomatic employees (30%) and smokers (100%). No association was found between atopy and specific IgE binding. The RAST-inhibition tests of black GR revealed significant inhibitions by black GR-human serum albumin conjugate and minimal inhibitions by unconjugated black GR. Orange 3R RAST-inhibition tests revealed significant inhibitions by conjugated forms of black GR and orange 3R and some inhibitions by two unconjugated dyes, suggesting an immunologic cross-reactivity between these dyes. These findings suggested that reactive dyes could induce immunologic responses, most likely IgE-mediated.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined the possibility that there is cross-desensitization between immunologic and nonimmunologic stimuli that evoke contraction and histamine release (HR) in the isolated guinea pig trachea. Compound 48/80 and D-tubocurarine were found to cause homologous and heterologous desensitization for both contraction and HR from superfused trachea. Specific antigen challenge of trachea obtained from animals sensitized with either IgG1 (ovalbumin [OA]) or IgE (oxazalone-human serum albumin [OX-HSA]) also resulted in homologous desensitization for both contraction and HR. However, in experiments with animals sensitized with both IgG1 and IgE antibodies, prechallenge with OA resulted in cross-desensitization to OX-HSA, whereas the reverse sequence was ineffective in eliciting this phenomenon. This may be related to the type of desensitization produced by each antigen (specific versus nonspecific) or to heterogeneity of mast cells in the tissue. Prechallenge of the trachea with compound 48/80 or D-tubocurarine failed to alter subsequent effects of antigen after active sensitization with OA or passive sensitization with either IgG1 or IgE antibodies. Small but statistically significant decreases in tracheal responses to D-tubocurarine were observed after antigen prechallenge to active both IgG1 and IgE antibodies. This is the first study to demonstrate a cross-desensitization between compound 48/80 and D-tubocurarine and the first to examine cross-desensitization with IgG1 and IgE antibodies in the guinea pig trachea. The overall conclusion is that there is no major overlap in the desensitization mechanisms between immunologic and nonimmunologic stimuli in the guinea pig trachea.\r"

  ".W": "Latex products have recently been identified as the cause of severe intraoperative anaphylactic reactions. We have identified a group of pediatric patients who appear to be at increased risk for such reactions. Fifteen patients with either spina bifida or congenital urologic abnormalities experienced 19 intraoperative anaphylactic reactions. All patients had frequent previous exposures to rubber materials since infancy as part of their management and/or investigative procedures. Seven of 15 patients had a previous history of local skin reactions to rubber. Only four patients were atopic. All patients had undergone multiple (two of 26) operative procedures before their reactions, the onset of which ranged from 40 to 290 minutes after induction of anesthesia. The reactions varied in intensity from urticaria to severe cardiorespiratory collapse. All these patients subsequently had positive allergy skin tests and positive RAST to latex antigen. We conclude that this group is at risk when they are exposed to latex intraoperatively as a result of frequent past exposure to these materials. Allergic evaluation for latex allergy may assist in the preoperative evaluation of similar patients. In sensitized patients, appropriate prophylactic measures, particularly the avoidance of latex, is required.\r"

There was a significant correlation between the baseline plasma PAF levels and the degree of bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine. These findings suggests that PAF may be an important mediator in the pathogenesis of asthma and bronchial hyperresponsiveness.\r"

Four of five patients with reactions had positive cutaneous tests, whereas only one nonreactor had a positive skin test (p less than 0.0002). The same four of five patients with reactions also had positive ELISA results, whereas three nonreactors has positive ELISA results (p less than 0.003). In this group of patients, the positive predictive value of cutaneous testing (80%) is somewhat higher than that of ELISA testing (57%). However, the sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive values are similar. We conclude that cutaneous testing with ETO-HSA probably offers a small advantage over IgE against ETO-HSA as determined by ELISA.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the relationship of the major allergens of birch (Bet v I), alder (Aln g I), hazel (Cor a I), and hornbeam (Car b I) at the nucleic acid level, a cDNA clone coding for the complete Bet v I protein was used for Northern and Southern blot experiments. RNAs were isolated from pollen of birch (Betula verrucosa), alder (Alnus glutinosa), hazel (Corylus avellana), and hornbeam (Carpinus betulus). Hybridization was performed at different stringencies. At high stringency, comparable binding of the complete Bet v I cDNA probe to pollen RNAs from birch, alder, and hazel could be observed, indicating high homology of the mRNAs coding for these allergens. With the 3' and 5' half fragments of the Bet v I cDNA, both probes bound to transcripts of all four tree pollens, but most strongly to birch RNA. In Southern blots, distinct binding patterns of genomic DNA digests of birch, alder, hazel, and hornbeam were observed. Most bands were observed with birch DNA digests and less with alder, whereas in genomic DNA digests of hornbeam and hazel, only one band was observed. The result of these cross-hybridization experiments indicate a high homology at the nucleic acid level of the four major allergens of trees belonging to the order Fagales. The sequence similarity presented here further corroborates earlier observations of immunologic cross-reactivity at the protein level. Therefore, in the case of the major allergens of the Betulaceae, an extract with only one major allergen, preferentially Bet v I, instead of all four major allergens, should be sufficient for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.\r"

  ".W": "Aspergillus-induced diseases usually demonstrate elevated circulating antibodies belonging to different isotypes. The antigens currently used to detect antibodies are crude culture filtrate and mycelial extracts of A. fumigatus (Af). Most Af-associated diseases result from the inhalation of the spores of the organisms present in the environment. However, it is not known whether specific circulating antibodies directed only against spore or mycelia of Af exist in the sera of patients with Af-induced diseases. With colloidal gold we have investigated thin sections of spores and hyphae of Af for their reactivity with Af-specific IgG and IgE antibodies. The results indicate that both spores and hyphae reacted identically with IgG and IgE antibodies from patients. None of the sera from normal control subjects reacted in this system, although low levels of antibodies were detected in the sera by ELISA. Sera from both patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis or aspergilloma reacted with cell envelope antigens, whereas sera from patients with invasive aspergillosis also bound to cell sap. This method therefore demonstrates localization of antigens binding to different isotypes in the sera from different clinical forms of aspergillosis and may be useful in purifying specific antigens for immunodiagnosis.\r"

Cell- and membrane-free lysates from purified human EOs (1 to 20 x 10(5)) caused a dose-dependent release of respiratory glycoconjugates (RGC) from cultured feline tracheal explants. Crude extracts from isolated EO granules also stimulated RGC release, suggesting that a granular protein might be responsible. Three proteins derived from EO granules, EO-derived neurotoxin, EO cationic protein (ECP), and major basic protein (MBP) were separated by sequential sizing and affinity chromatography. ECP (0.025 to 25 micrograms/ml) caused a dose-dependent increase in RGC release from both feline and human airway explants and also stimulated the release of the serous cell-marker, lactoferrin, from human bronchial explants. EO-derived neurotoxin (0.025 to 50 micrograms/ml) failed to affect RGC release, whereas MBP (50 micrograms/ml) significantly inhibited RGC release from feline explants. Thus, ECP stimulates RGC and lactoferrin release from airway explants, whereas MBP inhibits RGC release.\r"

It is not known whether this protection will persist after IT is stopped in patients with remaining venom sensitivity. In 25 adult patients with a previous severe systemic reaction to a Hymenoptera insect sting, 28 in-hospital sting challenges after stopping IT resulted in no systemic reactions. The mean duration of venom IT was 42.8 months (range, 36 to 83 months), and the mean time interval from the time IT was stopped until sting challenge was, in mean, 25.2 months (range, 12 to 36 months). The mean venom-specific IgE after stopping IT was 2.4 PRU/ml (range, 0 to 16.9 PRU/ml), at the day of sting challenge, 2.7 PRU/ml (range, 0 to 22 PRU/ml), and 2 weeks later, 2.4 PRU/ml (range, 0.02 to 27.8 PRU/ml). These changes in IgE were not significant. Venom-specific IgG concentration when IT was stopped was 64 PU/ml (range, 20 to 144 PU/ml), decreasing significantly to the day of sting challenge to 41.1 PU/ml (range, 13 to 84 PU/ml), and 2 weeks later, a significant increase to a mean of 53.5 PU/ml (range, 12 to 117 PU/ml) was found. Our results suggest that venom IT may be stopped after 3 years, regardless of the level of specific antibodies. To confirm this finding, a larger number of patients should be studied.\r"

All patients had tolerated well a honeybee sting during IT and were resubmitted to a sting 1 year after VIT was stopped. At the latter time, 15 patients (17%) developed an SR and 71 did not. There was no difference between the two groups regarding age, sex, IT duration, severity of the SR before treatment, as well as diagnostic tests with HBV (skin tests, RAST, and specific IgG) before the challenge. Patients with a relapse of their allergy had, however, developed allergic SRs to IT injections more frequently than patients with lasting protection (p less than 0.001). SRs to the sting challenge (CH) after IT was stopped occurred more frequently in those patients in whom efficacy of IT had previously been confirmed by lacking responses to a field sting than in patients who had tolerated an intentional CH during the injection period (p less than 0.025). Indeed, the incidence of relapse after venom IT was stopped was only 9.6% in patients who had previously tolerated an intentional CH. It is concluded that well-tolerated HBV IT may be stopped after at least 3 years, provided its efficacy has been documented by a CH without SR.\r"

Dapsone was chosen because it inhibits neutrophil function and possesses anti-inflammatory effects in a variety of disorders. The study group consisted of 10 subjects with stable, steroid-dependent asthma, aged 23 to 80 years, with normal glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase levels. Average daily baseline prednisone dose ranged from 5 to 60 mg. Dapsone, 100 mg, twice daily, by mouth, was started after a 1-month baseline period. Baseline steroid dose, symptom scores, and daily peak flow rates were compared to the latest available 4-week period of dapsone treatment. Average cumulative monthly prednisone dose was reduced from 428 mg to 82 mg (p less than 0.02). Five of 10 patients stopped steroids by month 6 and two additional patients by month 13. Two additional patients demonstrated a coincidental 74% reduction in steroid dose, and one patient demonstrated no response. Clinical parameters remained stable despite steroid reduction. These preliminary data suggest dapsone may have steroid-sparing effects in chronic asthma.\r"

After incubation for 15 minutes to 15 hours, PAF was purified by high-performance liquid chromatography, and newly synthesized PAF was quantified by its radioactivity. PAF stimulated its own synthesis in a dose-related manner with a maximal twofold to threefold increase in synthesis at 10 pM to 100 pM of PAF. Maximal PAF synthesis occurred after incubation for 6 to 8 hours. There was a good correlation (r = 0.95) between PAF quantified by [3H]acetic acid incorporation and by rabbit platelet aggregation bioassay, indicating that the radioactive material is PAF. The protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, did not inhibit delayed PAF synthesis, indicating that delayed PAF synthesis does not require protein synthesis. PAF is metabolized rapidly in vivo. The capacity of PAF to stimulate its own synthesis would result in a prolonged effective half-life in vivo. This prolonged half-life could contribute to the capacity of PAF to induce prolonged inflammatory reactions in vivo.\r"

However, in the group with LIT, the severity of late reaction was unchanged after treatment in spite of the significantly larger doses of allergen administered to provoke the early asthmatic reaction. Neither symptom score, nor drug consumption, nor peak expiratory flow were significantly different in the two groups before and during the treatment period even though both symptom score and drug consumption tended to be reduced after LIT. We conclude that LIT may be an effective and safe alternative to traditional immunotherapy.\r"

The frequency of ovalbumin (OVA)-specific B cells was significantly higher in patients with egg white-allergy than in age-matched nonallergic individuals. These B cells, isolated by the immunomagnetic-beads method, produced anti-OVA antibodies of mostly IgM class when they were transformed by Epstein-Barr virus and cultured for about 2 weeks. Based on a chronologic analysis, the increase of OVA-specific B cells was found to precede the increase of IgG and IgE anti-OVA antibodies in the serum. These observations indicated that OVA-binding B cells in the peripheral blood are already committed to producing IgM antibody and probably are the precursors of antibody-forming cells of the IgG or IgE class.\r"

  ".W": "The heterogeneity of pollen-allergic individuals is well-known but poorly characterized. Twenty-six patients were studied to characterize their immunologic and clinical patterns. Thirteen patients were allergic only to grass pollens, and 13 other patients were allergic to grass-pollen and other pollen species, including Cupressaceae, plane tree, olive, and Parietaria. The IgE response was assessed by the titration of serum total IgE and orchard grass-specific IgE, as well as by IgE immunoblots to orchard-grass pollens. Clinical reactivity was assessed by nasal challenge with orchard-grass pollens before the pollen season and nasal and bronchial symptom-medication scores between April 1 and June 15. Pollen counts were obtained during this period of survey. Polysensitized patients had significantly increased levels of serum total and specific IgE and a greater heterogeneity of IgE immunoblots, suggesting an enhanced qualitative and quantitative IgE immune response. Polysensitized patients had nasal and bronchial symptoms occurring earlier than grass pollen-allergic individuals, confirming the priming effect caused by other plans flowering with an earlier season for both nasal and bronchial mucosa. Alternatively, the early symptoms may be attributable to the tree pollens or might reflect the higher grass-pollen IgE level in the polysensitized group. Bronchial symptoms appeared a few weeks after nasal symptoms. Nasal challenges were similar in both groups, and the severity of nasal symptoms during the season was not significantly different in both groups, suggesting that the intensity of symptoms is not related to the sensitization nor to the IgE immune response of the subjects.\r"

Fallers were more unstable than controls on clinical tests of balance (20% of fallers vs 79.2% of controls were able to stand on one foot (P less than .005), 40% of fallers and 100% of controls were stable while turning in place (P less than .001), postural stress test median score was 12 for fallers and 20 for controls (P less than 0.001). We found prolonged tibialis anterior latency (fallers 158.8 +/- 23.7, controls 143.2 +/- 15.7 milliseconds, P = 0.03), marked losses in ankle strength (dorsiflexion: faller 3.2 +/- 2.9, controls 8.9 +/- 4.2 foot-pounds, P less than 0.001; plantarflexion: fallers 7.9 +/- 5.3, controls 21.4 +/- 11.1 foot-pounds, P less than 0.001), and decreases in range of motion (ankle plantarflexion: fallers 29.2 +/- 7.0, controls 37.8 +/- 12.4 degrees, P = 0.02). Gastrocnemius latency and electromyographic (EMG) measures of sequence showed no differences between fallers and controls. Sequence measures were not symmetric between the lower extremities in either fallers or controls. In this population of persons with unexplained falls who demonstrated substantial impairments in functional balance, effector factors appear more impaired than automatic postural responses. Alternatively, contemporary analysis of automatic postural responses may require further development before it can be useful to study balance problems in older persons.\r"

  ".W": "Malnutrition in the elderly is often unrecognized and untreated. Reduced secretion of growth hormone (GH) has been suggested as a cause of decreased muscle and bone mass with aging. This pilot study characterized the nutritional response of elderly malnourished subjects to recombinant human GH (rhGH). Subjects were included if they were over 60 years of age, if weight was more than 20% below average body weight (ABW), and if serum albumin concentration was less than 3.8 g/dL. Subjects were divided into two groups: one received 100 micrograms/kg rhGH (Protropin, Genentech) intramuscularly (IM) daily for 21 days; the other received a daily control injection of normal saline (Controls -C) (0.1 mL/kg IM) for the same period of time. During the 3-week period, mid-arm muscle circumference (MAMC) increased an average of 0.6 cm in GH patients but fell in C subjects. There was a non-significant trend to a decreased caloric intake in the control group. Weight increased an average of 4.95 lbs (2.2 kg) in the GH treated group, and decreased an average of 4.9 lbs (2.2 kg) in C subjects (P less than 0.05). Urinary nitrogen retention occurred only in the growth hormone treated subjects (P less than 0.05). Somatomedin C (IGF-1) rose significantly in those treated with GH (P less than 0.05), while there was no change in the control group. There was a significant association between weight change and IGF 1 concentration (r = 0.837, P less than 0.05). Neither clinical edema nor hyperglycemia was noted. These findings suggest that GH may be an effective way of maintaining and enhancing weight in malnourished older individuals.\r"

  ".W": "To determine if diabetes in the elderly is associated with increased prevalence of podiatric problems, a random sample of diabetic patients (n = 74) was compared to a group of elderly non-diabetic patients (n = 79). The two groups were comparable in age (range 70-90 years), smoking habits, and consumption of alcohol. The mean duration of diabetes was 14.5 +/- 11.7 years (+/- SD), and mean serum fructosamine level was 3.3 +/- 0.66 mmol/L. The number of medical diagnoses and medications used was significantly higher in the diabetic group. Diabetic patients had modestly higher prevalence of neuropathy, vascular disease, kidney disease, and eye complications. The most common podiatric problem in both groups was elongated toenails. The prevalence of podiatric problems such as cellulitis, amputation, tinea pedia, onychomycosis, calluses, bunions, and hammer toe deformity were not increased in diabetic patients. Active foot ulcers were more common in diabetic patients (13/74 vs 5/79, P less than 0.05). It is concluded that diabetes in the elderly, unlike in young patients, increases the risk of foot problems only marginally.\r"

Diagnoses and severity ratings were based on defined criteria following a mental state examination, a medical and psychiatric history, detailed cognitive testing, and an interview with relatives or other key informants. Fourteen subjects became more severely demented within 2 years. The initial cognitive test battery failed to reveal any differences between respondents whose dementia advanced and those whose condition remained unchanged, but, in the former group, subjects' symptoms had been present for longer, and a greater proportion had been recognised as demented, or possibly demented, by their general practitioners. We suggest that subjects whose dementia progressed had actually been more severely disabled at the time of identification.\r"

The geriatric sample had significantly higher serum folate levels. Psychotic depressives had lower B12 than did non-psychotic depressives. Poorer blood vitamin status was not associated with higher scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale or lower scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination in either age group. The data support the hypothesis that poorer status in certain B vitamins is present in major depression, but blood measures may not reflect central nervous system vitamin function or severity of affective syndromes as measured by the assays and scales in the present study.\r"

  ".W": "Sleep apnea is characterized by transient hypoxemias which are thought to affect mental functioning. Accordingly, speculation and research have focussed on relationships between sleep apnea and dementia. We studied 235 nursing home (ie institutionalized) patients (152 women with a median age of 83.5; 83 men with a median age of 79.7) with portable sleep recording equipment. The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale and the Geriatric Depression Scale were given to each. Seventy percent of the patients had five or more respiratory disturbances per hour of sleep and 96 percent showed some dementia. Sleep apnea was significantly correlated with all subscales on the dementia rating scale. There were trivial differences in dementia ratings between those with mild-moderate apnea and those with no apnea. There were significant differences, however, between the latter two groups and those with severe apnea. In particular, items reflecting attention, initiation and perseveration, conceptualization, and memory tasks on the DRS distinguished between those with and without severe sleep apnea. Among those patients with no depression, all patients with severe sleep apnea were also severely demented. Our data suggest that there is a strong relationship between dementia and sleep apnea when the sleep apnea and dementia are severe. Although causality cannot be inferred from associations, our hypothesis for study is that sleep apnea causes deficits in brain function, possibly due to global effects rather than any particular cortical or subcortical structure.\r"

FTI and FSH were measured in follow-up 42-378 (mean 161) days after the diagnosis of mild hypothyroidism had been made. In 45 patients initial TSH was less than 6.8 microIU/mL; in 23 of these subjects TSH returned to normal during the observation period, whereas in 22 TSH remained elevated. In all 22 residents whose initial TSH was greater than 6.8 microIU/mL, TSH remained elevated at follow-up. In 4 subjects whose initial TSH concentrations ranged from 5.0 to 9.6 microIU/mL, FTI fell below normal 91-141 days after the diagnosis of mild hypothyroidism was made. Clinical progression of the signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism was not detected in the 4 patients who developed hypothyroxinemia. Three demonstrated positive thyroid antibody titers, and 1 had myasthenia gravis. These observations suggest a need for replacement therapy in debilitated patients with mild hypothyroidism and evidence of thyroid autoimmunity.\r"

Families referred 52% of patients, primarily for problems of memory and behavior, whereas social service agencies made 32.9% of all referrals, primarily for bladder control problems or safety-related concerns. Physicians made only 6% of referrals in this setting. Referral source was found not to be associated with any of the seven categories of medical diagnoses resulting from the assessment process and was associated with only two of the functional diagnostic categories. Therapeutic recommendations were also broadly distributed among referral sources, though social service agencies did refer more patients who required urgent nursing home placement, financial representation, or adult protective service involvement. The performance of family referral sources in accurately referring patients with dementia and psychiatric impairment was comparable to that of physicians, though all referral sources frequently missed patients with incontinence. Non-physician referral sources appear to serve as important and quite valid case-finders for outpatient geriatric assessment.\r"

Comparison of these samples to a sample of nursing home admissions has not been studied. This study compares characteristics and lengths of stay among cross-sectional, discharge, and admission samples. All current residents of three nursing homes in February 1987 made up the cross-sectional sample, all admissions in the following year made up the admission sample, and all discharges in the same year made up the discharge sample. The results of comparing these three sampling techniques show that the most striking differences occur between the cross-sectional sample and the admission sample. Persons in the cross-sectional sample tended to have longer nursing home stays as well as less social support and more behavioral and functional problems than persons in the admission sample, who tended to have shorter stays and more acute medical problems. The discharge sample was more similar to the admission sample than it was to the cross-sectional sample; however, some differences were found between the discharge and admission samples. Based on the differences found among the three samples, appropriate uses for each sample are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The induction of skin cancers in mice by chronic UV irradiation is accompanied by a decrease in the numbers of Ia+ and Thy-1+ dendritic cells in the epidermis early in the course of UV irradiation. Subsequently, the number of Ia+ cells, but not Thy-1+ cells, increases until the time of tumor development. To assess the functional significance of these changes in cutaneous immune cells, and to help define the role these cells may play in immune surveillance against skin cancers, we tested the afferent immunologic capability of the skin during the development of UV-B radiation-induced skin cancers. Afferent immune function was measured by testing the Ag-presenting capacity of draining lymph node (DLN) cells from mice sensitized epicutaneously with dinitrofluorobenzene. A reduced contact hypersensitivity response was induced in mice immunized with DLN cells from UV-irradiated mice that had been sensitized with hapten on UV-irradiated skin. This decreased reactivity was present during the entire latent period of tumor development. However, in tumor-bearing mice, the DLN cells from UV-irradiated, sensitized animals exhibited normal Ag-presenting activity. DLN cells from UV-irradiated mice sensitized on ventral, unirradiated skin exhibited normal Ag-presenting activity. The lowest amount of Ag-presenting activity in the draining lymph nodes of UV-irradiated mice correlated temporally with the lowest number of Ia+, adenosine triphosphatase+ dendritic epidermal cells in the UV-irradiated skin. At least during the early part of the tumor latent period, an increase in the number of these cells was paralleled by an increase in the Ag-presenting activity of the DLN cells. In contrast, the number of Thy-1+ dendritic epidermal cells in UV-irradiated skin did not correlate with the Ag-presenting activity. Thus, the decrease in the number of identifiable epidermal Langerhans cells early in the course of chronic UV irradiation correlated with a decrease in Ag-presenting activity after sensitization through the UV-irradiated skin. These studies demonstrate that the afferent arm of the cutaneous immune response is impaired in the site of tumor development throughout the latent period of UV carcinogenesis.\r"

  ".U": "91170704\r", 
  ".W": "Cell-cell adhesion events play critical roles in the sequential migrations and multiple specific cell-cell interactions which B cells undergo during normal development and function. We have observed that mAb to several B cell-associated molecules, including mAb to CD19, CD37, and CD40, induce homotypic aggregation of freshly isolated human B cells. The aggregation of B cells induced by CD40 mAb was due to activation of a cell-cell adhesion system, and not due to agglutination by mAb, because 1) in addition to being energy dependent and cation dependent, the aggregation was blocked by inhibitors of messenger RNA and protein synthesis; and 2) a mouse B cell line transformed with intact human CD40 aggregated in response to CD40 mAb, whereas a line expressing surface CD40, but lacking the cytoplasmic tail and previously shown incapable of transmitting a signal from the cell surface, did not aggregate. The aggregation, although of slow onset, was persistent and of high avidity. In addition, CD40 mAb induced increased surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (CD54), a ligand for CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1), and CD18 mAb blocked aggregation. CD40 mAb also augmented the ability of dense B cells to stimulate the proliferation of allogeneic T cells via a CD18-dependent process. We conclude that signaling through CD40, elicited by cross-linking the CD40 protein on the cell surface, activates the CD18/intercellular adhesion molecule adhesion system; in addition, CD40 cross-linking may activate a second adhesion system since CD40 mAb induced aggregation of the B cell line Ramos, which does not express surface CD18. B cell adhesion may be triggered by signaling through multiple surface proteins, thereby lending specificity of activation to adhesion systems which are broadly expressed.\r"

When lymphocytes were triggered through CD3-Ti, neither IL-1 nor IL-6 nor the combination of both cytokines was capable of inducing a proliferative response, whereas addition of monocytes or IL-2 to such a system mediated DNA synthesis and cellular mitosis. In contrast, in the presence of submitogenic concentrations of mAb directed at CD2, IL-1 and/or IL-6 produced marked comitogenic dose-dependent effects. Moreover, although the action of IL-1 was clearly dependent on expression of the IL-2/IL-2R system, proliferation to CD2 antibody plus IL-6 could not be blocked by mAb directed at the IL-2R and/or IL-4. T cell responsiveness to both IL-1 and IL-6 was facilitated in the presence of CD58-like signals as delivered by human rCD58, SRBC or a mAb (anti-T111A), which binds to an interaction site for CD58 on the human CD2 molecule. These findings indicate that CD2 and its ligand CD58 play an important role in T cell/monocyte interactions during primary immune responses by means of upregulating T cell susceptibility to monocyte-derived cytokines.\r"

Using a panel of such cells, we have examined the ability of distinct APC populations to stimulate proliferation of Th1 and Th2 clones. Both subsets proliferated well in response to OVA in the presence of whole spleen cells. However, purified B cells stimulated optimal proliferation of Th2 clones, whereas adherent cells stimulated optimal proliferation of Th1 clones. The proliferative response of Th2 cells stimulated with spleen cells irradiated with 3300 rad was dramatically less than that observed in response to spleen cells treated with 1000 rad; Th1 clones responded similarly to spleen cells exposed to either irradiation dose. Differential activation of Th1 and Th2 clones did not correlate with MHC-restricting element, or susceptibility to inhibition by mAb directed against CD4 or LFA-1. Lymphokine production by each subset still occurred under conditions of suboptimal proliferation, suggesting that the appropriate Ag processing and presentation events had transpired. The same pattern of response was observed using a specific OVA peptide that does not require processing, suggesting that differential responsiveness of Th1 and Th2 clones to different APC populations is not a result of defective Ag processing. Neither rIL-1 nor rIL-6 restored optimal proliferation of either subset. Our results suggest that unique cofactors are necessary for the optimal proliferation of Th1 and Th2 clones, and that these cofactors are produced by specialized APC populations.\r"

  ".W": "The regulatory role of CR1 and CR2 on B cell activation and proliferation has been investigated by using B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells are clonal expansions of B lymphocytes frozen at specific stages of activation. They displayed two patterns of response upon surface Ig (sIg) cross-linking in terms of in vitro proliferation and intracellular free Ca2+ mobilization: cells from patient F (first pattern) proliferated in the presence of mitogenic anti-mu antibodies, whereas cells from patient A (second pattern) did not respond to sIg cross-linking but proliferated in the presence of low m.w. B cell growth factor and IL-2. Coculture of A or F cells with C3b-bearing SRBC led to a two- to four-fold increase in thymidine incorporation in cultures containing low m.w. B cell growth factor but not in cultures containing rIL-2. This enhanced proliferation was inhibited by F(ab')2 polyclonal rabbit antihuman CR1 antibodies. Only cells which proliferated in the presence of anti-mu (cells F) responded to cross-linking of sIg with a rise in intracellular Ca2+. No increase in calcium mobilization was observed after co-cross-linking of CR1 and sIg on A and F cells with mAb or polyclonal anti-CR1 antibodies. Co-cross-linking of CR2 with sIg only led to an enhanced intracellular Ca2+ rise in F cells but not in A cells. The lack of CR2-mediated synergy in Ca2+ rise in A cells indicates that the synergy occurs only if there is a proper coupling of sIg to phospholipase C. CR1-induced proliferation of B cells does not involve the signaling pathways of sIg. These results provide additional evidences for the role of C3 fragments in modulation of human B cell activation.\r"

  ".U": "91170711\r", 
  ".W": "These studies demonstrate that the murine intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) performs at least two roles in enhancing T cell activation. These two roles are evident in both of our experimental systems: with ICAM-1 expressed on the surface of transfected fibroblast cells, and with purified ICAM-1 immobilized on plastic. First, as has been documented by many investigators, ICAM-1 mediates adhesion between ICAM-1- and lymphocyte function-associated Ag-1 (LFA-1)-bearing cells. This adhesive interaction occurs even in the absence of T cell stimulation, although it is increased by addition of phorbol ester and calcium ionophore. Although ICAM-1 expression does markedly increase intercellular adhesion, the increase is significantly less than the improvement ICAM-1 expression makes in the Ag-presenting ability of MHC class II-transfected fibroblast cells. We have investigated whether this difference is due to LFA-1-mediated signaling, and we present data that demonstrates that although ICAM-1 does not deliver costimulatory signals required for T cell activation, the interaction of LFA-1 with ICAM-1 does synergize with TCR-transduced signals. This synergy is observed for ICAM-1 on live and on chemically fixed accessory cells, and for purified ICAM-1 molecules, but in all cases occurs only when the ICAM-1 and the TCR ligands are on the same surface. Finally, when the ICAM-1 is present on the surface of accessory cells, it enhances T cell activation by changing the Ag dose-dependence of the T cell, but when ICAM-1 and CD3 mAb are co-immobilized, ICAM-1 increases the peak response of the T cell without affecting the dose dependence of the response.\r"

  ".W": "Four different subpopulations (Ly6Cneg, Ly6Clow, Ly6Cint, and Ly6Chi) of CD8+ T cells were arbitrarily defined on the basis of differential expression of Ly6C Ag. By combining the processes of electronic cell sorting and automated cell deposition, small numbers of respective CD8+ T cell subpopulations were directly deposited into tissue culture wells in which mitogen-stimulated responses were studied. Anti-CD3-stimulated proliferation and IL-2 production were the strongest by Ly6Cneg/Ly6Clow T cells, moderate for Ly6Cint T cells, and highly deficient for Ly6Chi T cells. The level of IL-2 production for Ly6Cneg CD8+ T cells was comparable to that of conventional CD4+ Th cells. Allogeneic stimulator cells elicited a strong cytotoxic response by Ly6Cneg + low but not Ly6Chi CD8+ T cells in the absence of added lymphokines. When IL-2 was supplied in excess, anti-CD3 induced comparable levels of cell proliferation and cytotoxic activity in Ly6Cneg, Ly6Clow, Ly6Cint, and Ly6Chi CD8+ T cells whereas alloantigen stimulated an approximate fivefold higher cytotoxic response by Ly6Chi than Ly6Cneg + low CD8+ T cells. Stimulation of co-cultures of B10 (CD8b) Ly6Cneg + low and congenic B10.CD8a Ly6Chi CD8+ T cells in the absence of added lymphokines, followed by selective elimination of activated CD8.1+ (CD8.2+) T cells by anti-CD8.1 (anti-CD8.2) + C treatment, allowed the demonstration that help provided by Ly6Cneg + low T cells can be effectively used by both Ly6Cneg + low and Ly6Chi T cells in anti-CD3 and alloantigen induced proliferative and cytotoxic responses, respectively.\r"

  ".U": "91170713\r", 
  ".W": "The affinity of Ag interaction with a B cell's membrane IgM (mIgM) receptors has long been considered to play a critical role in the in vivo clonal selection of B lymphocytes. This study has examined a possible basis for this affinity selection at the level of Ag induction of sequential B cell activation phenomena, i.e., elevated membrane class II MHC expression (G0* excitation), G1 entry, and S phase entry. Functional experiments with model bivalent Ag, i.e., a group of murine mAb of diverse intrinsic binding affinities for human IgM, revealed that the minimal affinity requisites for inducing the above phenomena vary significantly. At a ligand concentration of 100 micrograms/ml, the induction of increased class II MHC expression, G1 entry, and S phase had minimal affinity thresholds of Ka approximately 0.2 to 2 x 10(6) M-1; approximately 7 x 10(6) M-1; and approximately 1 x 10(8) M-1, respectively. Pulsing studies revealed that whereas high affinity ligand was essential at later periods in the prolonged (greater than 24 h) signaling period that leads to S phase entry, mAb with significantly lower affinity were competent at signaling during the first 24 h. Because all but the lowest affinity ligand (Ka = 2 x 10(5) M-1) could effectively modulate mIgM, and furthermore, because B cells show a substantial increase in surface area during activation, it appears likely that one factor contributing to the higher affinity requirements for induction of late activation phenomena is a progressive decrease in the density of mIgM on the responsive B cells. These studies suggest that whereas only a small proportion of B cells, i.e., those with relatively high affinity for an antigenic epitope, will be triggered to clonally expand on encountering a paucivalent Ag in the absence of T cell help, a much wider spectrum of the B cell repertoire will be triggered to a state of partial activation. How the presence of ancillary T cells and cytokines may facilitate the full clonal expansion of these latter cells is discussed.\r"

Previous work has shown that this defect resides the T cell rather than with the B cells. These experiments test several possible explanations for the lack of IgE production in these mice. SJA/9 mice do not appear to overproduce IFN-gamma or any other antagonist of IL-4 function. Helminth parasite infection induces normal levels of IL-5-dependent eosinophilia, suggesting that there is not a complete absence of a Th2 response in these mice. The defect, however can be explained by a substantial reduction in IL-4 production in vivo and can be corrected by infusion with IL-4. The reason for this lack of IL-4 production is not yet clear and, paradoxically, SJA/9 T cells can be stimulated in vitro to produce IL-4 levels comparable to T cells from other strains.\r"

Three days of pretreatment with 200 micrograms of GK1.5 completely abrogated the primary antibody response to a 3-micrograms dose of a mutant diphtheria toxin conjugated to an anti-transferrin receptor antibody. The same dose and schedule of anti-CD4 antibody significantly reduced and delayed, but did not prevent, the anamnestic antitoxin response in animals that had been previously primed to the immunotoxin. Three daily injections of anti-CD4 antibodies followed by weekly doses of immunotoxin resulted in a 3-wk delay in the development of antitoxin antibodies, and the kinetics of the antitoxin response correlated with the kinetics of recovery of CD4+ T cells in the spleen and lymph nodes. The antitoxin response to repeated doses of immunotoxin was completely abrogated when anti-CD4 antibodies were given every 2 wk throughout the course of immunotoxin treatment. Thus, transient depletion of Th cells during treatment can block the immune response to an immunotoxin. There was no evidence of tolerance induction with this regimen.\r"

  ".U": "91170716\r", 
  ".W": "It is well established that increased numbers of plasma cells occur in the localized tissues of chronic inflammatory diseases such as adult periodontitis, and enzymatic isolation has shown that most B lineage cells produce IgG-subclass with some IgA-subclass responses. It would be of importance to determine if excess production of cytokines in the localized lesion account for these responses and in the present study we have assessed gingival mononuclear cell (GMC) supernatants for cytokines that activate B cells including IL-6R expression and for levels of IL-6 present. Inasmuch as limited numbers (approximately 1 to 3 x 10(6) cells) of GMC were obtained from surgically removed tissues (approximately 400 mg), we have focused on the analysis of IL-6 production by GMC in this study. Further, initial evidence of additional cytokines that are produced by GMC and induce expression of IL-6R on resting B cells has been obtained. The GMC and PBMC from individual patients were cultured in the presence (or absence) of Con A. Higher levels of IL-6 were produced spontaneously by GMC when compared with Con A-stimulated PBMC. When PBMC cultures were supplemented with GMC supernatants obtained from the same patient, high numbers of spot-forming cells (SFC), mainly of IgG followed by IgA isotype, were seen. The induction of SFC by GMC supernatants was inhibited by incubation with a goat anti-human IL-6 antibody. When the effect of GMC supernatants on subclasses of PBMC SFC was determined, the response was IgG1 greater than IgG2 greater than IgG3 = IgG4 and IgA1 greater than IgA2, a pattern remarkably similar to the distribution of plasma cells in the GMC itself. To assess for cytokines in GMC supernatants that mediated B cell activation, supernatants containing anti-IL-6 were cultured with PBMC or purified B cells for 72 h. This treatment induced small proliferative B cell responses and elevated expression of IL-6R on B cells, but did not induce SFC responses. Further, incubation of B cells with GMC supernatants induced resting B cells (G0/G1) to enter the cell cycle (S and G2/M). Addition of human rIL-6 to these cultures on day 3 restored IgG- and IgA-subclass SFC responses by day 7. Cytokine-induced IL-6R expression also occurred in vivo because freshly isolated GMC expressed high levels of this receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In order to characterize the naturally occurring sequence polymorphisms putatively responsible for the differential allorecognition of these class II molecules, we have determined the third and/or second exon nucleotide sequences of HLA-DRB1, -DRB3/4/5, -DQB1, and -DQA1 genes from 35 representative lymphoblastoid cell lines. In some cases, the lack of recognition correlates with the presence of single amino acid substitutions in either the second or third hypervariable region (HVR) of the first domain of these molecules. In other cases, the differentially allorecognized class II molecules have identical second and/or first domain amino acid sequences. These findings indicate that a) class II MHC-alloreactive T cell clones can distinguish between molecules with identical amino acid sequences expressed by B cell lines established from unrelated individuals; b) allorecognition of class II molecules is sensitive to naturally occurring single amino acid substitutions in either the second HVR of class II molecules, which is unavailable to interact with TCR residues, or the third HVR. Our results also suggest that 1) in different B cell lines, identical class II molecules may present different endogenous peptides, which may behave as histocompatibility Ag; 2) the peptide-binding specificity of a class II molecule may be affected by amino acid substitutions in its second HVR (Ag-binding site); and 3) human class II allorecognition may be restricted by epitopes contributed by residues of their third HVR.\r"

  ".W": "The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) promoter and 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) each contain sequence elements that mediate a response to bacterial endotoxin. Although the promoter contains sequences that permit augmented TNF gene transcription in response to LPS, the 3'-UTR contains sequences that normally confer translational repression, but which allow \"derepression\" to occur after cell contact with endotoxin. We now show that both genetic elements act in concert during activation of TNF gene expression in macrophages. In order to do so, we have made use of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter constructs in which the TNF promoter and 3'-UTR are represented either independently or in combination with one another. Suppression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and TNF mRNA synthesis, observed after treatment of the macrophages with dexamethasone, 2-aminopurine, pentoxifylline, or dibutyryl cAMP, has also been studied in detail. Each class of inhibitor suppresses TNF biosynthesis through a separate mechanism. Interestingly, suppression by pentoxifylline is manifested partly (but not entirely) at the level of transcription, and depends upon the presence of both the TNF promoter and 3'-UTR. The data suggest that other sequences within the TNF gene could also be required for the full effect of pentoxifylline, which may act to prevent processing of the primary transcript. The suppressive effect of dexamethasone is manifested both at the level of transcription and at the level of translation, and is mediated both by sequences present in the TNF promoter and by sequences present in the 3'-UTR. Suppression by 2-aminopurine is solely dependent upon promoter sequences.\r"

It has previously been shown that this method of labeling is specific and does not affect the biologic properties of class I MHC Ag. With this labeling it has been possible to demonstrate the constitutive endocytosis of class I MHC by fluorescence microscopy and by measuring the resistance to quenching by crystal violet of the internalized fl-beta 2m molecules. We could also follow the kinetics of beta 2m dissociation from the class I molecules at different pH. At pH 5.5, that is the average pH of endosomes, there is considerable dissociation within 15 to 20 min, that is the average recycling half time of class I MHC containing endosomes in activated T cells. Inasmuch as the process is reversible it is likely that, in the recycling endosomes of T cells, class I MHC molecules undergo conformational changes with beta 2m going off and on and with consequent changes of the peptide binding site. This process might be involved in Ag presentation, but, because it is apparently limited to T cells, it would play a role in the presentation of the cell's own TCR in idiotypic interactions between T cells.\r"

  ".W": "C5 convertase of the alternative complement pathway is a trimolecular complex consisting of two molecules of C3b and one molecule of Bb. We previously proposed a model of the alternative pathway C5 convertase in which the second C3b molecule binds covalently to the first C3b molecule bearing Bb, and the C5 molecule binds to each C3b molecule of the covalently linked C3b dimer, resulting in its appropriate presentation to the catalytic site on Bb. In the present study, we purified the covalently linked C3b dimer and reconstituted the C5 convertase with the C3b dimer and factors B and D to obtain evidence in support of this model. An insoluble glucan, OMZ-176, was incubated with human serum to activate the alternative pathway and to allow formation of the alternative C5 convertase on the surface of the glucan, and the glucan bearing the C5 convertase was then solubilized by incubation with glucosidases. In this way, the covalently linked C3b dimer was obtained in solution without using a detergent. The C3b dimer was then separated from enzymes, C3b monomer, C3b oligomer, and other materials by chromatographies. SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated that the purified C3b dimer had intact alpha'-chains. Alternative pathway C5 convertase was reconstituted when the isolated C3b dimer was incubated with factors B and D. The presence of P enhanced C5 convertase formation threefold. These results support the notions that the formation of the covalently linked C3b dimer is a general phenomenon associated with activation of the alternative pathway and that the C3b dimer acts as a part of the C5 convertase.\r"

The m.w. of the isolated RaRF estimated by glycerol density gradient sedimentation (around 300,000) was the same as that of the active material in mouse serum. As evidenced by gel filtration, the intact RaRF was decomposed into high (higher than 200,000) and low (50,000 to 200,000) m.w. components by treatment with 10% acetonitrile. SDS- and acid/urea-PAGE demonstrated that the high m.w. component was completely dissociated into equimolar quantities of two kinds of 28 kDa polypeptides, P28a and P28b, under reducing conditions, indicating that the association of these polypeptides was stabilized by disulfide bonds. The ability to bind specifically to the Ra determinant was retained in the high m.w. component, although the complement-activating potency was lost. The amino acid compositions of P28a and P28b polypeptides were compared with those of related serum proteins. The P28a and P28b polypeptides were found to have the highest homology to rat mannan-binding protein and mouse and human C1q subcomponent of complement.\r"

Few studies, however, have assessed whether human autoantibodies display patterns of autoantigen recognition similar to those of SLE-prone mice. In previous studies, anti-La antibodies from humans have been shown to bind multiple epitopes on recombinant human La Ag, including immunoreactivity with a large fragment, termed La C, representing the middle portion of the La sequence. We report herein for the first time that MRL-1pr mice also spontaneously produce antibodies to recombinant human La protein and resemble human autoantibodies in their reactivity with La C. To further investigate the fine specificity of this response, we tested for antibody binding to six synthetic La peptides representing sequences within La C. Whereas two of the synthetic La peptides reacted with MRL-1pr sera containing anti-La binding, low reactivity was observed with a large panel of human anti-La sera. Our results therefore show that patterns of La antigen recognition displayed by MRL-1pr antibodies differ from those of human autoantibodies, possibly reflecting differences between mouse and man in the induction of these responses.\r"

  ".W": "The stimulated murine macrophage was found to contain 11 major gangliosides of which 8 were determined to be monosialylated. The thin-layer chromatographic patterns were complicated by the presence of both sialic acid and ceramide fatty acid heterogeneity. N-glycolyl and N-acetylneuraminic acid-containing species were present for each ganglioside characterized. Although C18 sphingosine was the only long chain base detected, ceramide fatty acid ranged from C16 to C24 carbon moieties. Based on gas-liquid chromatographic and antibody analyses, all major tetraosyl structure gangliosides were ganglio series types. Comprising 43 to 60% of thioglycollate-stimulated cells and 60 to 70% of Escherichia coli-activated cells, monosialosyl-gangliotetraosyl ceromides (Gm1 gangliosides) were the major monosialo species of which four were present: sialidase-resistant NeuGc-GM1a and NeuAc-GM1a and sialidase sensitive NeuGc-GM1b and NeuAc-GM1b. Analyses of thioglycollate-elicited murine peritoneal macrophage ganglioside patterns from four strains of mice, including the C3H/HeJ strain, indicated that, in the absence of any expression of a genetic defect, the pattern is conserved. However, when E. coli was used as the activating agent, the normal C3H/HeN macrophage contained little Gm1a with the sialidase-sensitive Gm1b predominant; the converse was true for the congenic endotoxin hyporesponsive C3H/HeJ strain. Therefore, C3H/HeJ mice are not defective in ganglioside metabolism per se but in the processing of an endotoxin stimulus such that one manifestation is an altered macrophage ganglioside pattern deficient in Gm1b.\r"

  ".W": "By activating murine lymphocytes with anti-CD3 antibodies for 1 to 2 days, we generated a subset of activated killer cells, namely CD3-AK-. CD3-AK- mediated the slow lysis (20-h 125I-UdR release assay) of allogeneic P815 but had little effect on syngeneic HFL/b cells. Addition of IL-2 (murine or human) or an IL-2 inducer such as PMA in the assay medium induced the cytolytic activity of CD3-AK- on HFL/b. The activating effect of murine IL-2 and PMA on CD3-AK- was decreased by anti-murine IL-2 mAb. Although anti-murine IL-4 mAb alone did not show any effect, it enhanced the inhibitory effect of anti-IL-2 mAb, suggesting that IL-2 and IL-4 may have a synergistic effect on the cytolytic activity of CD3-AK-. Incubation of CD3-AK- with L-buthionine-(SR)-sulfoximine (BSO), an inhibitor of de novo glutathione (GSH) synthesis, decreased cellular GSH levels and inhibited the cytolytic activity of CD3-AK-, in a concentration-dependent manner. This inhibitory effect of BSO was not primarily due to a general cytotoxic effect and was positively correlated with the requirement for IL-2 for the CD3-AK(-)-mediated killing of the target cells. Incubation of CD3-AK- with GSH or 2-ME, which increased the level of cellular GSH, reversed the inhibitory effect of BSO. These results suggest that cellular GSH may regulate the effect of lymphokine(s) such as IL-2 and thus affect the differentiation of activated primary cytotoxic lymphocytes.\r"

These reagents were used to examine GSH regulation of the proliferation and function of human PBL in response to IL-2 or OKT-3 mAb directed at the CD3 T cell Ag. 2-ME enhanced both IL-2-induced proliferation of PBL and CD3- large granular lymphocytes (LGL) and OKT-3 mAb-induced proliferation of CD3+ T cells. BSO partially suppressed activation-induced proliferation in CD3- LGL and CD3+ T cells and totally inhibited the positive co-proliferative regulation by 2-ME in these cells. By contrast, neither BSO nor 2-ME appeared to affect the activation-dependent differentiation of cytotoxic lymphocytes. The absence of effect of 2-ME or BSO on activation-induced PBL NK activity and T cell cytotoxic potential was supported by their negligible effect on the induction of two different markers of activated cytotoxic lymphocytes, namely pore-forming protein gene expression and benzoyloxycarbonyl-1-L-lysine thiobenzylester-esterase activity. BSO inhibition of CD3- LGL proliferation accounted for the inhibitory effects of BSO on both IFN-gamma production in IL-2-stimulated PBL cultures and IL-2-induced PBL lymphokine activated killer activity. The modulatory effects of 2-ME and BSO on lymphocyte proliferation regardless of phenotype (LGL vs T cell) or stimulation (IL-2, via CD3, lectin, etc.) and the functional differentiation of cytotoxic lymphocytes independent of proliferation suggests that these cells share a common site of GSH regulation close to or at the level of DNA synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "It has been reported that the tumoricidal activity of macrophages (M phi) depends on L-arginine and that L-arginine metabolites such as reactive nitrogen intermediates alter M phi physical capacities. The aim of this report is to investigate the dose-related effect of L-arginine on the expression and retention of M phi tumoricidal activity. Cytotoxicity of M phi activated by IFN-gamma plus LPS was detected in the presence of about 0.1 mM or more of L-arginine. This paralleled the NO2- production in the presence, but not in the absence, of L-arginine. On the other hand, activated M phi were destined to die and lost their tumoricidal activity with time in the presence of 0.3 mM or more L-arginine. They retained, however, considerable activity in the absence or presence of 0.15 mM L-arginine. This retention of M phi cytotoxicity was longer when M phi were preactivated by 100 ng/ml than 10 ng/ml of LPS in combination with IFN-gamma. Addition of indomethacin, an inhibitor of prostaglandin production, did not prevent the decay of M phi cytotoxicity but rather facilitated it even in the absence of L-arginine. Regardless of indomethacin, consecutive stimulation with LPS or LPS plus IFN-gamma during culture was effective in maintaining the tumoricidal activity at a high level. In addition, we found that M phi which had lost tumoricidal activity during culture in L-arginine deficient medium could be reactivated by LPS to attack tumor target cells.\r"

  ".W": "Antibody responses to the 18-kDa protein of Mycobacterium leprae have been analyzed in different strains of mice. High, intermediate, and low responder strains have been identified and these response patterns show clear linkage to genes encoded in the H-2 complex. Three peptides, residues 1-50, 51-100, and 101-148 have been synthesized, as well as a series of 20-mer peptides, which span the entire 18-kDa protein. Repeated immunization of different strains of mice with the 18-kDa protein resulted in IgG responses to epitopes found on all three synthetic peptides. Immunization of BALB/cJ and B10.BR mice, two high responder strains, with 18-kDa protein resulted in high levels of IgG antibody to epitopes found on peptides 1-20, 16-35, 31-50, 46-65, and 76-95. B10.BR mice also contained IgG that bound peptide 61-80 and BALB/cJ mice produced IgG that bound peptide 91-110. Although B10.BR mice produced IgG that bound the 50-mer peptide 101-148, this IgG was not detected by binding to peptides 91-110, 106-125, 121-140, and 131-148. Immunization of B10.BR mice with individual overlapping 20-mer peptides as Ag revealed that peptides 1-20, 16-35, 31-50, and 76-95 elicited high titers of IgG that bound both the immunizing peptide as well as 18-kDa protein. As these peptides induce antibody synthesis they must contain both B cell and T cell epitopes. By contrast, immunization of BALB/cJ mice with the same 20-mer peptides, all of which contain B cell epitopes for this strain, failed to elicit IgG responses with one exception. Peptide 91-110 induced IgG that bound peptide 91-110, but not the intact 18-kDa protein. We conclude that peptides 1-20, 16-35, 31-50, and 76-95 either lack T cell epitopes for BALB/cJ mice, or activate different T cell subpopulations in the two strains. We suggest that the induction of IgG responses to small peptide Ag is an in vivo assay of the activity of Th2 cell subpopulations.\r"

Mice were given i.p. injections of 10(8) A. viscosus T14V cells in saline on days 0 and 14, and IgG anti-type 1 fimbriae in sera obtained on day 26 were measured by ELISA. Segregation analysis of the responses of (BALB/cJ x A/J)F1 x A/J backcross mice suggested polygenic control. Linkage analysis in (BALB/cJ x A/J)F1 x A/J backcross and SWXL recombinant inbred mice suggested control by genes linked with H-2 and with Ly-17 and Akp-1. In several F1 hybrid strains derived from H-2-disparate high and low responder parental strains, low responsiveness was dominant. The F1 derived from the H-2-identical high and low responder strains CBA/J and C3H/HeJ was a low responder, suggesting that dominant low responsiveness was mediated by non-H-2-linked genes. A three-gene model is proposed for regulation of the type 1 fimbriae response, including an MHC-linked gene, a gene linked with Ly-17 and Akp-1 on the telomeric portion of chromosome 1, and a background gene whose linkage is unknown.\r"

  ".W": "The envelope glycoprotein of HIV gp120 is a T cell Ag in experimental animals and in humans infected with HIV or deliberately immunized with gp120 in various forms. Inasmuch as T cell responses result from the interaction of Ag processed and presented by APC with the unprimed T cell repertoire, we have investigated the human T cell repertoire specific for gp120 in seronegative, normal individuals. T cell lines and clones specific for HIV gp120 were generated by repeated in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood T lymphocytes with gp120-pulsed APC, followed by IL-2 expansion. We observed that the T cell response to whole gp120 involved single restricted immunodominant epitopes in gp120 that differ between responding individuals. Focusing of the response to limited regions of gp120 when the whole Ag is used for priming suggests that one or more adjacent epitopes are immunodominant and mask responses to \"immunorecessive\" epitopes. We have been able to generate primary in vitro responses to recessive epitopes by stimulation in vitro with synthetic peptides of gp120. The results indicate that a much broader T repertoire can be detected when individual peptides are used for priming in vitro rather than gp120. This information has important implications for the development of vaccination protocols aimed at eliciting diverse immune responses to \"immunorecessive\" regions of envelope glycoprotein.\r"

  ".W": "Secretory IgA is presumed to be the mediator of mucosal immunity based on many studies that show a correlation between protection and secretory IgA titers; however, a causal relationship has not yet been established. Classically, passive transfer of antibody has been used to demonstrate causality, but the passive transfer of local immunity with physiologically transported IgA has not been previously reported. In this study mice were injected intravenously with polymeric IgA (pIgA), monomeric IgA (mIgA), or IgG1 mAb specific for the H1 hemaglutinin of PR8 influenza virus. pIgA was shown to be specifically transported into nasal secretions relative to the mIg. The transported pIgA was functional, as evidenced by its ability to bind to virus in an ELISA assay and to protect nonimmune mice against intranasal infection with H1N1 but not H3N2 influenza virus. Intravenous injection of similar virus-neutralizing doses of anti-influenza IgG1 mAb did not protect against nasal viral challenge. IgA-mediated protection could be abrogated by the intranasal administration of antiserum against the alpha chain of IgA. These data demonstrate the passive transfer of local immunity by the i.v. administration of pIgA antibody and show that the IgA in secretions can protect against influenza virus infection. This general approach could provide a model for the evaluation of the role of local IgA in host defense against other pathogens.\r"

  ".W": "Expression of human complement receptor 2 (CR2, CD21, C3d,g/EBV receptor) is developmentally restricted on human B lymphocytes to cells of the late-pre and mature stages. CR2 is also a member of the genetically linked regulators of complement activation family found on human chromosome 1q32. Regulators of complement activation proteins are variably expressed in plasma, on cell membranes, and in nonvascular extracellular fluid sites. To begin to understand the mechanisms that control both tissue specific and B cell developmental restriction of CR2 expression, we have cloned and characterized the CR2 promoter upstream of a single apparent transcriptional initiation site. Within this region are sequences with significant similarity to previously characterized TATA, SP1, AP-2, AP-1-like, and Ig enhancer E motif DNA protein binding sites, in addition to direct and inverted repeats. Significant regions of identity are also found between CR2 promoter sequences and those of the CD23 promoter, another protein whose expression is developmentally restricted on B cells. The CR2 promoter will direct transcription of the reporter gene chloramphenicol acyltransferase when transiently transfected into the human Raji B cell line. Therefore, we have identified the promoter for a human B cell protein whose expression is developmentally restricted. Further analysis of this region and the transcriptional regulation of CR2 gene expression should lead to significant insights into the molecular mechanisms by which B cells mature and are activated.\r"

  ".W": "Human papillomaviruses (HPV), and in particular HPV type 16, are etiologic agents in the development of cervical cancer, which is the second most common form of cancer in women worldwide. Mammalian cells are susceptible to transformation in vitro by the E6 and E7 oncogenes derived from the HPV-16 genome. NIH-3T3 cells transfected with the HPV-16 E7 oncogene were found to exhibit cytolytic susceptibility to murine-activated macrophages. In comparison, E6 oncogene-expressing cells were not susceptible to lysis by activated macrophages. The E7 oncoprotein is multifunctional, being capable of complexing with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene (anti-oncogene) product, stimulating DNA synthesis, and causing cell transformation in vitro. Macrophage killing assays performed on cell lines expressing E7 mutants revealed that the ability to complex the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene product and stimulate DNA synthesis did not induce susceptibility to activated macrophages, whereas the ability of E7 to cause transformation was required to induce susceptibility to activated macrophages. These data suggest that cell transformation is a more important prerequisite for inducing susceptibility to activated macrophages than is the loss of tumor suppressor gene function. This study also provides an initial link between HPV-16 oncogene expression and the ability of activated macrophages to selectively recognize and destroy HPV-16-associated neoplastic cells.\r"

The purpose of the current study was to determine whether the presence of single transforming amino acid substitutions can render normal ras protein immunogenic and, thus, a possible target for T cell-mediated tumor therapy. In initial experiments, C57BL/6 mice were immunized with a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 5 through 16 of p21 containing the transforming substitution of arginine for normal glycine at residue 12. The results demonstrated that class II MHC-restricted T cells which were specific for the peptide could be elicited, and that the peptide-induced T cells could specifically recognize the corresponding intact p21 ras protein. Recognition of p21 ras protein by peptide-specific T cells implies that C57BL/6 APC can process the activated ras protein in a fashion that allows presentation of digested protein by class II MHC molecules in a configuration similar to the configuration with synthetic peptide. Evaluation of the immunogenicity of peptides containing alternative transforming amino acid substitutions of ras protein demonstrated that some, but not all, were immunogenic in individual strains of mice. Therefore, although ras protein-specific T cells can be elicited by immunization with synthetic peptides, not all of the potential ras mutations commonly associated with malignancy may be recognizable by T cells from all individuals.\r"

Activated macrophages were highly tumoricidal against syngeneic melanoma cells and secreted high levels of PGE2. Treatment with indomethacin or diclofenac sodium (voltaren) completely inhibited the production and secretion of PGE2 but not the tumoricidal activity of activated macrophages measured either immediately after activation or 1 to 3 days thereafter. Finally, the addition of exogenous PGE2 did not alter the ability of peritoneal exudate macrophages to respond to IFN-gamma or of LPS to produce high levels of tumor cell lysis. Collectively, these results show that PGE2 produced by activated macrophages is not a down-regulator of their tumoricidal activity against adherent tumor cells.\r"

  ".W": "The generation of antibody secretory cells from resting B lymphocytes after immunization with most protein Ag requires B cell signaling by Ag, direct Th cell contact and lymphokines. Previous studies suggest that cell contact-mediated signals may be transduced by Ia after Ia binding by alpha beta TCR and/or CD4. Seemingly inconsistent with this concept are findings that cross-linking of Ia molecules on quiescent B cells leads to cAMP generation that is antagonistic for B cell mitogenesis. Here we show that ligand binding to IL-4 and Ag receptors on quiescent B cells induce transition of these cells into a competent state in which Ia molecules transduce signals via a distinct mechanism. This mechanism involves the tyrosine kinase-dependent activation of phospholipase C leading to Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores and the extracellular space. This competence, which is seen within 4 h of priming, is not simply a function of increased Ia expression by the B cell because the response can be induced by cross-linking of less than 5% of cell surface Ia molecules on primed cells. Finally, cross-linking of Ia molecules leads to more than fivefold greater increase in [Ca2+]i than is induced by membrane Ig ligation. These findings are consistent with alpha beta TCR/CD4 delivery via Ia of proliferative signals mediated by tyrosine kinase activation, phosphoinositide hydrolysis and Ca2+ mobilization.\r"

Intact anti-CD23 mAb or its F(ab')2 fragments inhibit the proliferation of tonsillar B lymphocytes costimulated with either Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (SAC) or anti-IgM and IL-4. The antibody has no effect when IL-2 or LMW-BCGF is used as the second stimulant. The response of IL-4-pretreated B cells (expressing high levels of CD23) to anti-IgM together with IL-2 or B cell-derived B cell growth factor is inhibited by anti-CD23 mAb, indicating that this antibody prevents B cell activation regardless of the B cell activators but provided that the density of CD23 on B cells is sufficient. Anti-CD23 mAb markedly inhibits DNA synthesis only when added during the first 12 h of the culture and has no effect on the ongoing proliferation of CD23-bearing B cell blasts (SAC induced and IL-4 supported or EBV transformed). Monovalent Fab fragments of anti-CD23 mAb are inactive unless they are used in tandem with goat anti-mouse Fab suggesting that the inhibition is due to cross-linking of surface CD23. Most interestingly, polymeric IgE or IgE-immune complexes have the same effect as anti-CD23 and moreover they inhibit IgM production by SAC and IL4-stimulated B cells. The inhibiting effect of IgE or of anti-CD23 mAb is not due to their neutralization of soluble CD23 because these failed to display B cell growth factor activity under various experimental conditions. It is concluded that IgE-immune complexes may regulate activation and differentiation of CD23-bearing surfaceIgM/surfaceIgD precursor B lymphocytes.\r"

L cells expressing Kb or Kbm10 were equally capable of presenting the OVA peptide to Kb-restricted, OVA-specific bulk CTL, whereas L cell clones expressing Kbm8 or Kbm1 showed little to no capacity to present this peptide. L cell transfectants expressing Kbm3 and Kbm23 consistently demonstrated an intermediate to low level of presentation to bulk OVA-specific CTL. Dissection of the Kbm8 mutant revealed that cells expressing Kbm8-22 (Tyr----Phe) and/or Kbm8-24 (Glu----Ser) presented the OVA peptide significantly less well than the Kb-presenting molecule. Presentation of OVA by cells expressing Kbm8-23,30 (Met----Ile) (Asp----Asn), Kbm8-23 (Met----Ile), and Kbm8-30 (Asp----Asn) was equivalent to Kb presentation. Another mutation designated as Kbm5, that has a substitution at position 116 (Tyr----Phe), demonstrated an intermediate to high ability to present OVA258-276 to an OVA-specific CTL line. The Kbm3, Kbm11, and Kbm23 mutants were unable to present the OVA peptide to this same CTL line. Dissection of these mutants showed that the substitution at position 77 (Asp----Ser), which is shared by all three mutants, was responsible for their inability to present the peptide. A second Kb-restricted CTL line was able to recognize OVA in the context of the Asp----Ser substitution at position 77. The results of this analysis suggest that the OVA258-276 peptide interacts with multiple regions within the Ag recognition site of the Kb class I protein.\r"

  ".U": "91170770\r", 
  ".W": "We have developed a simple and adaptable, polyclonal model for B cell nonresponsiveness that is based on the inhibitory activity of anti-Ig as a surrogate for Ag. In our system the induction phase (treatment with anti-Ig) is separated from the challenge phase (Ag or mitogen), so that the critical events in each phase can be evaluated. Our results show that T cell-depleted B cells precultured for 18 to 24 h with rabbit anti-Ig reagents are rendered unresponsive to challenge with either Ag, fluorescein coupled to Brucella abortus (FL-BA), or mitogen (LPS). This state of nonresponsiveness (anergy) is reflected by an inhibition of a prototype response to the fluorescein hapten, as well as total Ig and IgG synthesis, but no reduction in proliferation to LPS. Interestingly, mitogen-induced polyclonal antibody formation was consistently reduced by 90% by treatment with either F(ab')2 or intact IgG anti-Ig. In contrast, the Ag-driven (FL-BA) response of pretreated B cells was inhibited by only 50 to 70%. Moreover, the latter effect usually required pretreatment with intact IgG anti-Ig, a result that suggests the importance of an Fc-dependent negative signal affecting the B cell's response to FL-BA. Furthermore, pretreatment and coculture of B cells with IL-4 blocked the Fc-dependent inhibition of the FL-BA responsiveness. These results, as well as kinetics experiments establishing a 4-h latent period, suggest that simple blocking of surface Ig receptor on target B cells is not responsible for the induction of anergy. Pretreated B cells displayed unique phenotypic changes after treatment with anti-Ig, including a diminution of Thy-1 expression in response to LPS + IL-4, as well as a reduction in membrane IgM and J11d expression (i.e., they were IgMlo, IgDmed, and J11dlo, as recently reported for anergic B cells in transgenic mice). These results suggest that B cell anergy can be induced in mature B cells by both Fc-dependent and Fc-independent processes that lead to unique phenotypic changes and may reflect egress from G0 in the absence of T cell help. The significance of these changes to tolerance mechanisms is discussed.\r"

Blast-1/CD48 is expressed on a wider range of cell types, notably T cells and monocytes, than previously thought, but appears to be restricted to lymphoid and myeloid cells. Resting B and T cells express Blast-1/CD48 molecules at the cell surface; however, they lack the epitope recognized by the 17D6 mAb. Resting B cells express no detectable Blast-1/CD48 mRNA. Induction by EBV infection or stimulation with PMA, IL-4, or PHA results in increased levels of Blast-1/CD48 protein (both 6.28 and 17D6 epitopes) at the cell surface. Detailed analysis of EBV-induced expression revealed that it is due to increased steady-state levels of Blast-1/CD48 mRNA induced by transforming but not nontransforming strains of the virus. Induction by IL-1 beta, ionomycin, or suboptimal levels of PMA plus ionomycin results in increased expression of the 17D6 epitope only. In transfected Cos-7 cells Blast-1/CD48 at the cell surface expresses only the 6.28 epitope, whereas cytoplasmic molecules express both 17D6 and 6.28 epitopes. We suggest that these results are most consistent with the idea that Blast-1/CD48 molecules are complexed at the surface of resting cells and Cos-7 cells, resulting in masking of the 17D6 epitope. Activation causes dissociation of the complex, revealing the 17D6 epitope. The existence of 17D6+6.28- Blast-1/CD48 molecules was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation analysis, which also revealed that, unlike the rest of the molecules, this subset was resistant to digestion with glyosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C.\r"

The proportion of B lymphocytes in the spleen, of T cells and their subsets (CD4+/CD8+) in spleen and thymus, and the histological structure of the involuted organs remained normal. Treatment of hypophysectomized animals with growth hormone (GH) or prolactin (PRL) stimulated the expression of the c-myc proto-oncogene and DNA synthesis and reversed the involution in these organs. Replacement doses of adrenocorticotrophic hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, or thyroid-stimulating hormone had no influence on thymus or spleen size and DNA synthesis. A rapid expression of c-myc was also observed in thymuses and spleens of intact rats after the injection of GH or PRL. In vitro physiological concentrations (2.5 ng/ml) of either ovine or rat PRL or GH stimulated the incorporation of [3H]thymidine by thymus and spleen cells. These results indicate that GH and PRL regulate lymphocyte growth. This regulatory role is likely to serve as the principal mechanism of immunoregulation by these hormones.\r"

EBV-transformed B-cell lines from asymptomatic, HIV seropositive and seronegative control donors were pre-incubated with the peptides. Fresh PBL from 19 (76%) of 25 HIV seropositive donors lysed autologous targets pulsed with at least one of the four peptides. Autologous targets pulsed with two non-immunogenic peptides were not lysed. PBL from none of the eight HIV seronegative controls lysed peptide-preincubated autologous targets. The CTL activity was mediated by T cells, was predominantly MHC class I restricted, and was increased by in vitro restimulation of PBL with the peptides. HLA A-2 was identified as a restricting element for all four peptides in different patients, and for three of the peptides in the same donor. HLA-A1 or -B8 may also present some of the peptides. Thus, the same peptides can be recognized by human Th cells and class I MHC-restricted CTL.\r"

  ".W": "The distribution, biochemical properties, and function of CD39 were characterized with the use of a new mAb termed 400. CD39 is an acidic (isoelectric point, approximately 4.2) glycoprotein of Mr approximately 78,000, containing approximately 24 kDa of N-linked oligosaccharide but no detectable O-linked sugars. CD39 was not expressed by resting blood T, B, or NK cells, neutrophils, or monocytes, but was expressed on activated NK cells, B cells, subsets of T cells, and T cell clones. Furthermore, the pattern of expression of CD39 was distinct from the \"classic\" activation Ag CD25 and CD71, inasmuch as it was expressed long after expression of CD25 and CD71 had returned to basal levels. CD39 was easily detectable on EBV-transformed B cell lines but was absent from pre-B and non-EBV-transformed B cell lines, most myeloid cell lines, and leukemic T cell lines. In lymphoid tissues, germinal center cells expressed little or no CD39, whereas some paracortical lymphocytes and most macrophages and dendritic cells were positive. CD39 was strongly expressed by endothelium in all tissues examined, including skin, and was present on some, but not all, endothelial cell lines propagated in vitro. Interestingly, mAb binding to certain epitopes on CD39 induced rapid homotypic adhesion that appeared to involve LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18), but was morphologically and kinetically distinct from that induced by PMA. Anti-CD39 mAb also induced homotypic adhesion in an CD11/CD18-EBV-transformed B cell line derived from a patient with severe leukocyte adhesion deficiency. This adhesion was unaffected by EDTA, suggesting that this pathway of anti-CD39-induced homotypic adhesion was not mediated by any of the known integrins. These studies suggest that CD39 is involved in the cellular signaling that regulates adhesion.\r"

Like native human AChR, the recombinant human alpha 1-210 protein induced AChR-binding, AChR-modulating, and AChR-blocking autoantibodies in rats when injected once intradermally as an emulsion in CFA, with Bordetella pertussis vaccine as supplementary adjuvant. The minimum dose of recombinant protein required to induce biochemical signs of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG) with 100% incidence was 2.2 micrograms. With 6.6 to 22 micrograms, serum levels of autoantibodies were persistent, and clinically apparent EAMG lasted more than a month. Clinical, electrophysiological, and biochemical indices of EAMG induced by doses of 66 micrograms or more were more uniformly severe and persistent, with 33% fatality. Rats receiving a control extract of E. coli containing plasmid without the alpha 1-210 codon insert, with adjuvants, did not develop autoantibodies or signs of EAMG. This highly reproducible new model of EAMG induced by a recombinant human autoantigen should be valuable for testing Ag-specific immunotherapeutic strategies that might be applicable to treating acquired myasthenia gravis in humans.\r"

Rabbit anti-nucleolin also specifically depleted autoreactive 110K from detergent lysates of human cells. Because nucleolin shares amino acid sequence similarity and/or forms dynamic particles with other prominent autoantigens, the present observation raises the possibility that the nucleolin/anti-nucleolin system may be of special significance for the development of humoral autoreactivity to nuclear Ag.\r"

  ".U": "91170782\r", 
  ".W": "Cross-linking of 125I-IL-4 to the surface of cells expressing IL-4R yields as the major IL-4-binding molecules, polypeptide chains with inferred m.w. of approximately 70,000 (p70) and approximately 120,000 to 140,000 (p120-p140). The demonstration that the functional product of the IL-4R cDNA clone has m.w. of approximately 140,000 and that no p70 product is detected in transfected COS-7 cells has led to an uncertainty regarding the nature of p70. To study this issue, we examined the relationship of the IL-4-binding molecules p120 and p70 and, in parallel, attempted to immunoprecipitate p70 from surface and internally labeled cells using IL-4 and two anti-IL-4R antibodies (M1 and M2), bound to Affigel 10, as ligands. Cross-linked complexes containing 125I-IL-4 and p70 or p120 were isolated and digested with chymotrypsin or with V8 protease. Three distinct IL-4-binding peptides could be compared; these were indistinguishable for cross-linked p70 and p120, strongly implying that p70 and p120 were structurally related. Furthermore, immunoprecipitates made with IL-4 or anti-IL-4R-Affigel did not contain p70. This led us to conclude that p70 is a breakdown product of p120. A second IL-4-binding molecule of 40,000 Da (p40) expressing the M1 and M2 epitopes of the IL-4R was detected and appears to be the product of an mRNA coding for the soluble form of the receptor. mRNA for p40 was detected in both the T cell line CT.4R and the mast cell line CFTL.12 using polymerase chain reaction primers unique to this species of message. Pulse-chase studies of IL-4R in [35S] methionine-labeled cells indicates that p40 is derived from a 42,000-Da precursor that is detectable at the end of the pulse period, and thus, further argue that p40 is an independently translated molecule and not a degradation product of p120. Although p40 has been previously shown to be a soluble, truncated form of the receptor, we failed to observe secretion of p40 into the medium by internally labeled CT.4R cells.\r"

The roles of most of these proteins in the biological responses induced by the IFNs, for example, inhibition of virus replication and inhibition of cell growth, remain largely unknown. Our recent research has focused on the induction and synthesis of an IFN-induced 15-kDa protein. In this report we show that human lymphocytes and monocytes, after treatment with IFN-beta, release into the medium an IFN-induced 15-kDa protein. At 24 h after induction of the 15-kDa protein in lymphocytes or monocytes, more than 50% of the total 15-kDa protein is in the medium. The human monocytic cell line THP-1 also releases 15-kDa protein into the medium after its induction by IFN-beta. An intracellular half-life of 12 h has been calculated for the 15-kDa protein in monocytes and THP-1 cells. The exocellular release of the 15-kDa protein by lymphocytes and monocytes suggests that 1) it may have an intercellular signaling role and 2) it may be an in vivo mediator of some of the biological responses induced by IFN.\r"

The decrease in p55 mRNA is not due to enhanced mRNA metabolism. We conclude that elevated [cAMP]i, acting directly on T cells, inhibits mitogenesis by decreasing IL-2 receptor expression. We discuss the possible physiological relevance for the multiple stages of T cell activation that are sensitive to elevated [cAMP]i.\r"

We have developed two mAb, 4G8 and 2F2, that markedly inhibited IL-3-dependent proliferation whereas only marginally affecting IL-2 or IL-4-induced proliferation. On Western blots, both antibodies identified the same protein, which varied in size from 115 to 145 kDa in six cell lines tested. The 4G8/2F2 Ag was detected at moderate density, on a wide variety of cells including IL-3-dependent cell lines and T lymphocytes. Radioligand binding studies revealed that 4G8, but not 2F2, could inhibit the binding of 125I-IL-3 to the high affinity IL-3R. These data suggest that the mAb 4G8 and 2F2 recognize different epitopes on the same Ag, and suggest furthermore that the inhibition of IL-3-dependent proliferation mediated by 2F2, in particular, does not occur via inhibition of ligand binding. Neither antibody showed an enhanced level of fluorescent staining of Cos 7 cells transfected with the low affinity IL-3R cDNA. In addition, 4G8 did not inhibit IL-3 binding to L cells transfected with the cloned IL-3R or IL-4R despite the fact that 4G8 was expressed on these cells. These data suggest that the 4G8/2F2 Ag is a unique cell surface protein that can interact with the endogenous functional IL-3R.\r"

  ".W": "In this paper we show that TNF-alpha enhances platelet activation. Experiments were performed on a human polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN)-platelet cooperation system in which PMN, stimulated by FMLP, release cathepsin G (Cat.G), a serine proteinase responsible for the activation of nearby platelets. Pretreatment of the mixed cell suspension with 5 ng/ml TNF-alpha resulted in a strong platelet activation (37.7 +/- 3.2% aggregation; 46.0 +/- 14.4% serotonin release) in response to a weak concentration of FMLP (1.25 x 10(-8) M) inducing by itself only 7.7 +/- 4.0% of aggregation and 3.8 +/- 4.1% of serotonin release (mean +/- SD; n = 10). This effect was concentration dependent (maximum between 5 and 10 ng/ml) and was optimal for a brief preincubation time (5 min). Under these experimental conditions the target of TNF-alpha was PMN, as shown by beta-glucuronidase release. The observed potentiation was modified neither by 0.1 mM acetyl salicylic acid (a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor) nor by 0.1 mM BN 52021 (a platelet-activating factor antagonist), while such a phenomenon was fully inhibited by 20 micrograms/ml eglin C, a strong and specific inhibitor of the human granulocytic proteinases, elastase and Cat.G. In fact, full inhibition was also observed with 300 nM alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, a specific inhibitor of Cat.G. This clear-cut evidence of Cat.G involvement was substantiated by the enhancement of Cat.G release from FMLP-activated PMN primed with TNF-alpha. These results demonstrate that the priming of PMN by TNF-alpha may modulate the activation of other inflammatory cells, particularly of platelets. It is hypothesized that this phenomenon could contribute to pulmonary pathologies, and more specifically to the adult respiratory distress syndrome, a disease for which PMN, platelet and TNF-alpha involvement has been proposed.\r"

In this study, we have analyzed the mechanisms by which SE induce IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha production. Treatment of human peripheral blood monocytes with staphylococcal exotoxin B and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 resulted in a biphasic increase of IL-1 beta mRNA that lasted more than 12 h and in a more transient rise in TNF-alpha mRNA. A F(ab) preparation of the anti-HLA DR mAb L243 also caused a significant increase in monokine mRNA levels. Stimulation of a monocytic cell line, THP-1, with staphylococcal exotoxin B and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 induced a rapid rise in IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha mRNA levels. This response peaked at 1 to 3 h poststimulation and remained detectable at 12 h. Nuclear run-on transcription assays demonstrated that SE cause transcriptional activation of the IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha genes. This transcriptional activation did not require de novo protein synthesis as it was not inhibited by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. These results define an important function for Ia molecules as regulators of cytokine gene expression and add to the understanding of the changes in cellular function induced by SE.\r"

Whereas IgG is known to bind to the globular region and not to the collagen-like region (CLR) of C1q, the site of interaction of C1q with CRP has not been defined. CRP-trimers were prepared by cross-linking and found to bind to C1q and to activate the C system. Heat-aggregated IgG (Agg-IgG) did not block the binding of CRP-trimers to C1q, nor did CRP-trimers block binding of Agg-IgG to C1q, suggesting that CRP and IgG bind at different sites. ELISA and Western blot analysis showed that CRP-trimers bound to the CLR, whereas Agg-IgG bound only to the globular region; similarly, anti-CLR mAb inhibited binding of CRP-trimers to C1q whereas anti-globular region mAb did not. Reactivity with CRP-trimers as well as with Agg-IgG was retained after reduction/alkylation and SDS treatment of C1q. A group of 22 anti-CRP mAb directed against at least six distinct native-CRP epitopes and eight distinct neo-CRP epitopes was tested for ability to inhibit the CRP-CLR interaction; one mAb, anti-native CRP mAb 8D8, with strong inhibitory activity was identified. Fab' of 8D8 blocked binding of CRP-trimers to intact C1q as well as CLR, and also inhibited CRP (CRP-trimers and CRP-protamine complexes) induced C activation, but had no effect on C1q binding or C activation by Agg-IgG. These results indicate that a conformation-determined region on CRP binds to a sequence-determined region on the CLR of C1q in an interaction which leads to C activation. Anti-CRP and anti-C1q mAb that specifically inhibit this interaction are described.\r"

Putative T cell (HA 308, 310, 311, 313, and 316) and DR (HA 309, 312, and 317) contact residues of the Ag were identified by the use of single amino acid-substituted analogs that were tested for their T cell-activating and DR-binding capacities. The peptide-DR7-T cell interaction was further characterized by the use of a panel of 13 site-directed DR7 mutant transfectants analyzed for their capacity to present Ag to T cells, and for their purified mutant DR7 molecules to bind HA 307-319 or its single amino acid-substituted analogs. Eight mutants lost their Ag-presenting function, whereas only one had any decrease in peptide binding. Finally, for three of the mutants it was possible to correct the deleterious effects of mutation by using a particular single amino acid-substituted analog of the peptide molecule.

  ".U": "91170792\r", 
  ".W": "The capacity of the human complement regulatory protein CD59 to interact with terminal complement proteins in a species-selective manner was examined. When incorporated into chicken E, CD59 (purified from human E membranes) inhibited the cytolytic activity of the C5b-9 complex in a manner dependent on the species of origin of C8 and C9. Inhibition of C5b-9-mediated hemolysis was maximal when C8 and C9 were derived from human (hu) or baboon serum. By contrast, CD59 showed reduced activity when C8 and C9 were derived from dog or sheep serum, and no activity when C8 and C9 were derived from either rabbit or guinea pig (gp) serum. Similar specificity on the basis of the species of origin of C8 and C9 was also observed for CD59 endogenous to the human E membrane, using functionally blocking antibody against this cell surface protein to selectively abrogate its C5b-9-inhibitory activity. When E bearing human CD59 were exposed to C5b-8hu, CD59 was found to inhibit C5b-9-mediated lysis, regardless of the species of origin of C9, suggesting that the inhibitory function of CD59 can be mediated through recognition of species-specific domains expressed by human C8. Consistent with this interpretation, CD59 was found to bind to C5b-8hu but not to C5b67hu or C5b67huC8gp. Although CD59 failed to inhibit hemolysis mediated by C5b67huC8gpC9gp, its inhibitory function was observed for C5b67huC8gpC9hu, suggesting that, in addition to its interaction with C5b-8hu, CD59 also interacts in a species-selective manner with C9hu incorporated into C5b-9. Consistent with this interpretation, CD59 was found to bind both C5b67huC8gpC9hu and C5b-8huC9gp, but not C5b67huC8gpC9gp. Taken together, these data suggest that the capacity of CD59 to restrict the hemolytic activity of human serum complement involves a species-selective interaction of CD59, which involves binding to both the C8 and C9 components of the membrane attack complex. Although CD59 expresses selectivity for C8 and C9 of human origin, this \"homologous restriction\" is not absolute, and this human complement regulatory protein retains functional activity toward C8 and C9 of some nonprimate species.\r"

RNA blot analysis identified Ddm6 transcripts of appropriate size and a Ddm6 protein was immunoprecipitated from biosynthetically labeled H-2dm6 cells. Interestingly, the Ddm6 protein showed no beta 2m association and was only precipitated by a mAb to the alpha 3 domain. Furthermore, oligosaccharide maturation and low levels of surface expression of Ddm6 molecules were detected. However, the surface Ddm6 was nonfunctional as a target Ag in in vitro cytotoxicity assays, consistent with its original in vivo detection as a loss mutation. Sequence analyses of Ddm6 cDNA identified a single nucleotide base difference from wild-type, resulting in the substitution of a Trp to Arg at position 133.

The alpha 1 domain acceptor site at positions 82 to 84 was eliminated by substituting Gln for Asn at position 82. The beta 1 domain acceptor site at positions 19 to 21 was deleted by substituting Gln for Asn at position 19 or Ala for Thr at position 21. The mutant genes (Ak alpha* or Ak beta*) were transfected either individually (mutants T.19, T.21, and T.82) or together (mutant T.82-21) into class II cell surface negative B lymphoma cell lines. Quantitative immunofluorescence with a panel of Ak beta- or Ak alpha- reactive mAb demonstrated that although the oligosaccharide-deleted Ak alpha Ak beta molecules were serologically wild type, the Ad alpha serologic epitope defined by mAb K24-199 was eliminated in both the T.19 and T.21 Ak beta* Ad alpha molecules. Cloned cell lines expressing the T.19 or T.21 Ak beta* Ak alpha molecules exhibited limited functional Ag presentation defects. Cells expressing the T.82 Ak alpha* Ak beta molecules exhibited defects in Ag presentation function to nine of the ten T hybridomas tested. Surprisingly, cells expressing the mutant T.82-21 class II molecule stimulated a response that was equal to the wild-type response from three of the nine T hybrids and a response that was significantly greater than that of wild-type cells from five of nine T hybridomas. These functional and serological analyses also indicate that some of the observed Ag presentation defects may be due to altered secondary structure caused by either deletion of the oligosaccharide or the amino acid substitution used to delete the N-linked oligosaccharide acceptor site.\r"

  ".W": "Immunofluorescence and flow cytometric techniques have been used to study changes in surface Ag expression and viability that occur during human basophil degranulation. Treatment with polyclonal anti-IgE, FMLP, or the calcium ionophore A23187 induced histamine release, along with rapid and sustained unimodal increases in basophil CD11b mean fluorescence intensity. In contrast, treatment with anti-IgE or FMLP resulted in a decrease in Leu 8 expression. Degranulation did not significantly affect basophil viability (as determined by exclusion of propidium iodide), scatter characteristics, or percentage of identifiable IgE-bearing cells, and an inconsistent association was seen between percent histamine release and reduction in the percent of cells identified by light microscopy after staining with alcian blue. For anti-IgE, dose-dependent changes in CD11b, CD11c, and Leu 8 expression were seen (optimal at 0.1, 0.1, and 1 microgram/ml, respectively), although CD11a expression remained unchanged. Histamine release was optimal at 0.3 microgram/ml anti-IgE, and at superoptimal concentrations, reduced CD11b expression was observed which paralleled decreases in histamine release; reduction of the expression of Leu 8, however, occurred equally at optimal and superoptimal concentrations of anti-IgE. Kinetic analyses of these responses revealed that CD11b up-regulation proceeded more rapidly than histamine release, whereas Leu 8 down-regulation was much slower and did not plateau until 120 min of stimulation. Although changes in CD11b mean fluorescence intensity correlated with the magnitude of histamine release, exposure to stimuli in the absence of calcium (which blocked degranulation) resulted in similar alterations in CD11b and Leu 8, suggesting that degranulation was not required for changes in the surface expression of these adhesion molecules. Interestingly, pretreatment of basophils with drugs that either inhibited or enhanced histamine release (isobutylmethylxanthine and cyclosporin A vs cytochalasin B, respectively) significantly decreased the magnitude of anti-IgE-induced CD11b up-regulation; down-regulation of Leu 8 expression was also partially inhibited by treatment with isobutylmethylaxanthine. These studies demonstrate that activation of human basophils by secretagogues in vitro results in a variety of phenotypic changes including alterations in surface expression of adhesion molecules, and suggest that degranulation in vivo may be accompanied or preceded by changes in adhesion-related functions.\r"

To determine whether these components can be coordinately controlled, we investigated regulation of superoxide generation by physiologically relevant concentrations of a) highly purified serum-derived antichymotrypsin (ACT), b) recombinant, wild-type ACT, c) rACT in which amino acid substitutions were engineered into the reactive center, and d) chymotrypsin/ACT complexes. These proteins and protein complexes inhibited superoxide anion production in neutrophils stimulated by f-Met-Leu-Phe, Con A, or PMA. In contrast, ligand-stimulated degranulation was not inhibited. In addition, using the recombinants and complexes, the region of ACT involved in inhibiting superoxide anion production was shown to be structurally distinct from the reactive center of the protein. The results indicate that functional domains of ACT corresponding to different biological activities can be decoupled and suggest that three species of ACT (intact ACT, a complexed protease/ACT form, and a partially denatured or proteolyzed form of ACT) that can exist in the microenvironment of an activated neutrophil may play an important role in regulating neutrophil function.\r"

  ".U": "91170800\r", 
  ".W": "Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV)-induced demyelinating disease serves as a relevant animal model of human multiple sclerosis. Myelin damage induced by TMEV infection appears to be immune mediated. Disease susceptibility correlates best with the temporal development of chronic, high levels of TMEV-specific, MHC class II-restricted delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses. We have proposed a model wherein these responses result in CNS demyelination via a macrophage-mediated terminal nonspecific bystander response. As virus-specific DTH responses appear to be intimately involved in the pathogenicity of CNS demyelination, it is critical to determine the specificity of these responses so that effector T cells specific for potential pathogenic epitopes can be targeted to serve as the focus of specific immunoregulatory processes. In the current study, the capsid protein specificity of the TMEV-susceptible SJL/J and TMEV-resistant C57BL/6 mouse strains was examined. DTH and Tprlf responses in both infected and immunized SJL/J mice were found to be predominantly directed toward the VP2 capsid protein, specifically to an epitope(s) contained within the N-terminal 150 amino acids of VP2. This same epitope was also found to be dominant in priming SJL/J mice for responses to challenge with intact virions. In contrast, the T cell-mediated responses of TMEV-resistant C57BL/6 mice did not show preferential reactivity towards VP2, because all three major capsid proteins (VP1, VP2, and VP3) elicited responses with essentially equal potency. The relationship of the restricted VP2 T cell epitope to predicted neutralizing antibody sites on the VP2 protein is discussed as is the potential use of this epitope for prevention and/or treatment of TMEV-induced demyelinating disease via the induction of epitope-specific tolerance.\r"

In contrast, the human T cell line, IARC 301, expresses these two genes constitutively and we have previously demonstrated that its growth depends on the autocrine production of this T cell growth factor and high affinity IL-2R. To dissect the molecular basis for the unusual persistent expression of the IL-2 and IL-2-R alpha genes in these IARC 301 T cells, we have analyzed the interactions of constitutively expressed nuclear proteins with the 5' flanking regions of the IL-2 and IL-2-R alpha genes using both DNase I footprinting and gel retardation techniques. We have found that a region in both genes (-276 to -250 for IL-2-R alpha and -203 to -183 for IL-2), which corresponds to a kappa B enhancer element, is specifically protected by nuclear proteins from IARC 301. In agreement with this finding, both the IL-2 and IL-2-R alpha promoters are active in transient transfection assays in IARC 301 cells. In contrast, mutation of the kappa B enhancer results in markedly attenuated activities of both promoters. Two proteins binding the kappa B sequence, NF-kappa B and KBF1, are constitutively expressed in IARC 301 nuclei and induced by PMA and PHA in Jurkat. They bind to the kappa B motifs with different relative affinities that may reflect their different contribution in the expression of various promoters.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanisms whereby RNA leukemia viruses cause T lymphocyte leukemias or lymphomas after a long latent period are not understood. We report here that infection of human T lymphocyte lines with a murine leukemia virus results in up-regulation of a number of lymphocyte-specific cell surface Ag. These proteins include CD2, CD3, CD4, the TCR, and MHC class I Ag. The expression of other cell surface proteins, such as LFA-3, are unaffected by the presence of the retrovirus. This up-regulation occurs at the level of the mRNA transcripts encoding these proteins, and is the result of increased transcription of the respective genes. The increases in transcription are the result of a trans-activation process by the leukemia virus. The transient introduction of chimeric genes consisting of MHC class I gene promoter sequences attached to the reporter gene CAT into human T cells containing murine retrovirus produces stimulated transcription of the reporter gene. Subgenomic portions of the murine leukemia virus containing the long terminal repeats and the 5' untranslated region are sufficient to produce transactivation of the same set of T cell genes as the whole leukemia virus. The finding that murine leukemia viruses enhance transcription and expression of a group of T cell surface proteins, all of which have been reported to be capable of transducing an activating signal to the lymphocyte, may be relevant to the pathophysiologic mechanisms whereby these viruses induce leukemias and lymphomas.\r"

Induced transcription from the hemopoietic growth factor genes is at least partially responsible for their increased expression. We have previously identified a sequence, cytokine (CK)-1, in the granulocyte (G)-CSF gene promoter that responds to TNF-alpha and binds a transcription factor, NF-GMa. We report here that the CK-1 sequence responds in a time- and dose-dependent manner to IL-1 beta and that the mutations which affect NF-GMa binding correlate with decreased transcriptional activity after stimulation with either TNF-alpha or IL-1 beta. The CK-1 sequence also responds to the human T lymphotrophic virus-1 transactivator, tax, so that this promoter element may contribute to the overall response of the G-CSF gene to these various agents. Although NF-GMa binding is seen in a number of cell types, the ability of the G-CSF CK-1 sequence to act as a transcriptional enhancer is specific for fibroblasts and not T cells. Furthermore, we show that an identical sequence in the granulocyte macrophage CSF gene, although apparently binding the same protein in vitro, cannot respond to any of these stimuli in either fibroblasts or T cells. Modification interference experiments, using the CK-1 region in the context of the granulocyte macrophage-CSF and G-CSF genes, indicated that the contact points for NF-GMa differ in each case and suggest that differences in sequences flanking the 10-bp CK-1 region probably leads to an altered DNA:protein conformation, which may explain the differential response of this conserved promoter element.\r"

In vitro studies confirmed previous work showing that antibody bivalency is required to induce modulation in vitro in simple systems. However, in the presence of isolated Kupffer cells, Fc-containing univalent antibodies were found to induce significant antigenic modulation, and the modulation induced by intact IgG was also found to be more rapid and extensive. Fragments that did not contain Fc regions behaved similarly in the presence or absence of Kupffer cells. Further investigations demonstrated that all three classes of human FcR can mediate modulation enhancement, and suggest that the mechanism involves indirect cross-linking of cell surface Ag via the antibody and effector cell FcR. In vivo studies showed that univalent antibody derivatives containing Fc regions did induce antigenic modulation, but that this was significantly reduced in comparison with bivalent antibodies, confirming their potential advantage for immunotherapy.\r"

Unlike young mice that are responders, moderately aged AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b mice, after immunization and secondary in vitro restimulation in bulk culture with AKR/Gross virus induced tumors, can not generate anti-AKR/Gross virus-specific CTL. The mechanism of conversion to nonresponsiveness in moderately aged AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b mice is not understood, but it is correlated with increased expression of endogenous ecotropic viral antigens. Our present investigation focuses on determining the frequency of anti-AKR/Gross virus precursor CTL in AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b mice as a function of age. This was achieved by performing limiting dilution cultures of immune spleen cells obtained from young and moderately aged AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b mice. Although spleen cells obtained from immune moderately aged mice can not differentiate in bulk cultures into anti-AKR/Gross virus-specific CTL, there was no evidence of substantially decreased frequencies of virus-specific precursor CTL, relative to precursor CTL frequencies observed in young responder AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b mice.\r"

  ".W": "Patients undergoing ovulation induction for in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) were monitored daily with serum estradiol-17 beta (E2) and ultrasound. The location of each individual follicle was established by taking ultrasound images through serial sections of the ovary. The diameter of each follicle and the volume of its follicular wall (FW) were determined from ultrasound images using a computer-controlled image analyzer. A total of 44 follicles from nine patients was studied, with an overall fertilization rate of 46% In all patients, serum E2 levels increased prior to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Whereas changes in either the average diameter or the volume of the entire follicle did not identify follicles with fertilizable oocytes, FW volume measurements were predictive. Prior to hCG, FW volume increased 24 +/- 8%/day in follicles with fertilizable oocytes but decreased 3 +/- 6%/day in follicles with nonfertilizable oocytes (P less than 0.05). Three major patterns of follicular development were observed for follicles with nonfertilizable oocytes: slow growing (less than 20% increase in FW volume), nongrowing (no change in the FW volume), and \"degenerating\" (a decrease in the FW volume), suggesting that these follicles are \"postmature.\" These data demonstrate that FW volume measurements made from sequential ultrasound images provide an accurate method to identify those follicles that contain fertilizable oocytes.\r"

Indications of probable psychiatric caseness were obtained using the 60-item General Health Questionnaire. IVF parents' mean scores were similar to those of parents who spontaneously conceived, and both were significantly greater than those who conceived after an infertility workup. Mothers and fathers overall had similar scores, contrary to previous community findings of higher rates of psychiatric disorder among females. The prevalence of probable psychiatric caseness was less for IVF and spontaneously conceiving mothers, but greater for the respective fathers, than in an English community sample and greater than in an Australian community sample. The extent to which the self-reports of current psychiatric disturbance can be ascribed to any preexisting psychopathology is unknown. Indications of increased psychiatric disturbance found in this investigation warrant further prospective investigations, especially of the difficulties of rearing twins when couples are vulnerable in having this degree of psychiatric morbidity.\r"

To assess the chromosomal content of oocytes and embryos, we used the method described by Tarkowski in 1966. Sixty oocytes fron 28 women, aged between 27 and 41 years, were analyzed. Sixty-seven percent were aneuploid; of these, 23.35% were hyperhaploid, 23.35% were hypohaploid, 8.35% were hyperdiploid, 3.35% were diploid, and 8.35% showed premature chromosome condensation. Of 20 preimplantation embryos analyzed, 80% were aneuploid, 10% were diploid, 5% were haploid, and 5% showed structural anomaly. Correlation was found between maternal age and aneuploidy in oocytes and between morphology and genetic balance in preimplantation embryos.\r"

The postthaw survival for mouse preembryos was 88% (3.5 M DMSO) and 93% (4.5 M DMSO), respectively (ns). Blastocyst formation occurred in 88% of the surviving URF preembryos. We also used URF to freeze a small series of human preembryos. Four of the thirty-eight patients became pregnant following transfer of URF preembryos. Two were term pregnancies and two are ongoing. URF is simpler and less expensive than other methods and its use with human preembryos warrants further evaluation.\r"

Although the 200-kcal glucose solution contained one-half the amount of glucose (50 g) compared to the 400-kcal solution (100 g), the blood glucose values obtained during a 2-hr period were only slightly lower with the former solution. This study demonstrates significantly delayed gastric emptying of glucose solutions in normal subjects and a linear pattern of gastric emptying formerly associated only with solid meals.\r"

The admission flow deficits correlated with outcome. The admission and 6-mo scores correlated with clinical conditions at each time. At 2 wk, the flow deficits were smaller and did not correlate with clinical parameters. Nor did the presence or absence of hyperfixation of the radiopharmaceutical. Six months after the infarct, the flow defect had decreased in 9 of 15 patients in whom three serial scans were available, with better clinical improvement than in the remaining six whose flow deficits increased. More patients in the first group had been treated randomly with the calcium-entry blocker flunarizine.

Out of 40 patients, 21 underwent right-sided and 19 left-sided temporal lobectomy. EEG and CT/MRI were primarily used to select the side of surgery. SPECT results correlated with temporal lobectomy in 68% of the patients. After surgical intervention, memory function was tested for both sides. Following left-sided temporal lobectomy, verbal memory was impaired in 8% of the patients, if SPECT agreed with the side selected for surgery, but in 83%, if it diverged from it. In the present study, there was no relationship between SPECT concordance with the side of temporal lobectomy and outcome as to seizure frequency and non-verbal memory. We conclude that preoperative interictal HMPAO/SPECT can contribute to the prediction of postoperative verbal memory function and that this method should be considered for use prior to temporal lobectomy.\r"

We report here its in vivo biodistribution, radiation dosimetry, and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) characteristics in man. Following i.v. administration of 15-25 mCi of the tracer, the maximum uptake of activity in the brain peaked at 1 min p.i. Fifteen minutes p.i., the percentage retained in the brain was 5.2 +/- 1.6, which remained fairly constant over 24 hr. Blood clearance was relatively slow with an apparent affinity of the compound for the cellular fraction of the blood, however, soft-tissue and facial activity cleared at a rate four times faster than that of the brain. SPECT images obtained at 15 min, 1 hr, 3 hr, 7 hr, and 24 hr p.i. showed no redistribution of the tracer within the brain. The dosimetry is favorable for administration of 25-30 mCi of MRP20. Our results indicate that this compound is rapidly extracted and retained by the brain and may be used for SPECT imaging of regional blood flow.\r"

Fourteen patients were studied using 99mTc-RBCs to measure inflow and 133Xe or 127Xe in saline to measure outflow. Tumescence was induced by injecting papaverine intracorporally. Peak corporal rates corrected for outflow (r = 0.88) and uncorrected for outflow (r = 0.91) and change in volume over 2 min centered around peak flow [corrected] (r = 0.96) all correlated with angiography. Outflow measurements did not correlate with intracorporal resistance. Thus, outflow rates alone could not be used to predict venous sinusoidal competence. Normal inflow rate is greater than 20 ml/min; probable normal 12-20; indeterminate inflow 7-12; and abnormal inflow less than 7 ml/min. Technetium-99m radioisotope penile plethysmography and xenon washout can be performed together and both provide a method for simultaneously evaluating the relationship between corporal inflow and outflow rates in patients with erectile dysfunction.\r"

Estimates of cure at doses above 10 mCi were made from the literature. Cure was directly related to dose between 5 and 10 mCi. There was no significant relationship between cure and age (chi-square, p = 0.74), sex (chi-square, p = 0.12), and 24-hr uptake if over 30% (chi-square for slope, p greater than 0.10).

We concluded that the optimal 131I dose for curing hyperthyroidism is approximated by starting with 10 mCi and increasing it for unusually large glands or for special patient circumstances.\r"

The mean +2 s.d. of ratios in Groups 1 and 2 were the same (0.37). In Group 3, 80 subjects (30%) with increased ratios (greater than 0.37) had higher frequencies of prior infarction and multi-vessel disease, more severe left ventricular dysfunction, and 201TI defects than 185 subjects with normal ratios. Subjects with markedly increased ratios (greater than 0.45) had three-vessel disease more frequently than those with slightly or moderately increased ratios (67% versus 14% or 35%). Thus the measurement of lung/heart ratios may provide information regarding the severity of coronary artery disease and should be added to the routine interpretation of exercise ECT.\r"

Baseline studies were obtained only for those patients showing abnormal findings in the provocative study. All patients underwent renal arteriography. Sensitivity and specificity for the detection of renal artery stenosis (RAS) greater than 50% were 89% and 91%, respectively. After Captopril administration, tracer parenchymal transit time increased significantly in ischemic kidneys (334 +/- 93 sec in baseline conditions versus 468 +/- 96 sec after Captopril, p less than 0.001) but not in kidneys with no RAS or RAS less than 50% (243 +/- 46 sec versus 271 +/- 95 sec, p = ns). False-positive responses were mostly bilateral and associated with a marked decrease in blood pressure. Technetium-99m-MAG3 is an effective compound for detecting RAS greater than or equal to 50% with Captopril renal scintigraphy. Performing the provocative test as a first step considerably reduced the number of scintigraphic studies required.\r"

The error can be ascribed to partial inclusion of the atrial activity in the region assigned to the right ventricle. The tricuspid valve plane was found to move by a distance equal to 9%-33% (mean = 20%) of the right ventricular long-axis between systole and diastole. This translational motion was more pronounced with higher EFs.\r"

Twenty-five patients with foregut symptoms were studied and results were compared to 24-hr gastric pH monitoring. Scintigraphy and pH monitoring agreed in 15 out of 25 patients (60%), but no correlation was found with the endoscopic findings. The rationale for this approach is based on pathophysiologic evidence that damage to gastric and/or esophageal mucosa is mainly related to the prolonged contact time with duodenal contents. This technique seems to allow a complete functional evaluation of the esophagogastroduodenal tract without causing adjunctive irradiation or discomfort to the patient.\r"

Desirable characteristics of 201TI scintigraphy including the potential for no thyroid hormone withdrawal, immediate imaging postinjection, and low radiation burden relative to iodine-131 (131I) suggests it is logistically superior to 131I scintigraphy. Fifty-two patients with DTC were evaluated with 201TI and 131I neck and chest images, and serum thyroglobulin measurements. In post-thyroidectomy and pre-131I ablation therapy patients, very little 201TI accumulation was noted within the thyroid bed, with discordantly increased 131I activity and normal serum thyroglobulin measurements. Twenty-nine percent of patients evaluated after 131I ablative therapy had elevated serum thyroglobulin levels and localized neck and chest abnormalities on 201TI scan that were not seen on 131I studies. Our data suggest that 201TI is more sensitive than 131I diagnostic (5 mCi) studies for detection of DTC, while 131I is more sensitive in detecting normal residual thyroid tissue postoperatively.\r"

Simultaneous dual-energy planar images were obtained at 5 min, 3 and 5 hr. All studies were concordantly either positive (8/11) or negative (3/11) by both radionuclides. Exact agreement for segmental uptake was 93%, 94% and 94% for 5-min, 3- and 5-hr images, respectively. Exact agreement for defect reversibility by 3 and 5 hr were 95% and 92%. The initial defect contrasts and myocardial-to-lung ratios were similar by both agents but myocardial-to-liver ratio was lower by [123I]MPDA at 5 min, which became similar to 201Tl at 5 hr. Normal percent myocardial clearances of both agents were comparable and significantly higher than those in defect zones. Thus [123I]MPDA is suitable for myocardial imaging and correlates closely with 201Tl for initial postexercise myocardial uptake and defect reversibility. Defect reversibility appears to result from differential myocardial clearance from normal and ischemic regions.\r"

In normal rats, anti-ACE Mab accumulates specifically in the lung after i.v. injection. Endotoxin injection induces reduction of specific pulmonary uptake of this antibody. Even in non-edematous endotoxemia, the accumulation of anti-ACE Mab antibody (Mab 9B9) decreased from 19.02 to 11.91% of ID/g of tissue without any change in accumulation of control nonspecific IgG. The antibody distribution in other organs and its blood level were almost the same as in the control. In a case of endotoxemia accompanied by increased microvascular permeability, the lung accumulation of Mab 9B9 was reduced to 9.17% of ID/g of tissue, while the accumulation of nonspecific IgG increased to 1.44% versus 0.89% in the control.\r"

Scintigrams were made 1, 4, and 24 hr later; subsequently the mice were killed and the activity in several organs and thighs was determined. The radiopharmaceutical demonstrated a time-dependent accumulation at the site of infection. It was found that vascular permeability or Fc binding alone could not account for the mode of action of HIG. Neither the origin of Ig (human versus murine) nor the total amount of protein (0.01-1.0 mg Ig per mouse) affected the target-to-background (T/B) ratios. Ratios were not different for leukocytopenic animals. A correlation (p less than 0.001) was demonstrated between the number of bacteria at the site of infection and the T/B ratio. This was also found after antibiotic treatment (p less than 0.02).\r"

Rat biodistribution experiments with 67Cu demonstrated retention of i.v. 67Cu-benzyl-TETA-albumin in the blood pool identical to co-injected 125I-albumin. By contrast, i.v. administration of either [67Cu]-Cu-acetate or [67Cu]-Cu-acetate pre-mixed with albumin results in relatively rapid clearance of blood-pool radioactivity as the tracer is excreted into the urine. The 62Cu-benzyl-TETA-albumin radiopharmaceutical was obtained in ca. 17% radiochemical yield (end of synthesis, without decay correction) following a procedure that can be completed in 15-18 min. In PET experiments with a baboon, myocardial blood volume images with 62Cu-benzyl-TETA-albumin were identical to those obtained with C15O. Use of the 62Cu-benzyl-TETA-albumin image for blood-pool subtraction of a 62Cu-PTSM myocardial perfusion image is illustrated. Copper-62-benzyl-TETA-HSA should be a useful, generator-produced radiotracer for the detection of the vascular pool at PET facilities without cyclotrons.\r"

The peptides were radiolabeled with 111In by transchelation and their biodistribution determined in rats at 5, 30, 60 and 120 min after injection. Localization at sites of infection was determined by scintillation camera imaging in animals with deep-thigh infection due to Escherichia coli. Images were recorded from 5 min to 2 hr after injection. All peptides maintained biologic activity (EC50 for O2-production by human PMN's: 3-150 nM) and the ability to bind to the oligopeptide chemoattractant receptor on human PMN's (EC50 for binding: 7.5-50 nM); biologic activity and receptor binding were highly correlated (r = 0.99). For all the peptides, blood clearance was rapid (half-lives: 21.5, 33.1, 31.6, and 28.7 min for P1, P2, P3, and P4, respectively). Biodistributions of the individual peptides were similar with low levels of accumulation in the heart, lung, liver, spleen, and gastrointestinal tract. In the kidney, P1 had much greater accumulation than other organs. All peptides yielded high quality images of the infection sites within 1 hr of injection. This study demonstrates that 111In-labeled chemotactic peptide analogs were effective agents for the external imaging of focal sites of infection.\r"

Transport of NP59 within the cell was indistinguishable from transport of cholesterol. Cholesterol and NP59 transport were under the control of cAMP, however, only cholesterol entered the mitochondria and was converted into progesterone. Thus, internalized NP59 could not be removed from the cell by conversion into steroid hormones. Esterified NP59 was metabolically inert and could not be converted back to free NP59 and free fatty acid. Since NP59 was not a substrate for the cholesteryl ester hydrolase, it became trapped in the cell as NP59 ester.\r"

  ".W": "Neogalactosyl albumin (NGA) is a synthetic ligand to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (hepatic binding protein), which has been proposed as a useful receptor binding radiopharmaceutical for the noninvasive assessment of liver function. We have compared the uptake and intracellular processing of iodine-125- (125I) and technetium-99m- (99mTc) NGA following its administration as a 1-min pulse (147 pmol) to the isolated perfused rat liver. Approximately 40% of a pulse of either 125I- or 99mTc-NGA were taken up first pass by the liver. Of the 125I taken up by the liver, 82% was released after 15-20 min at the sinusoidal pole of the hepatocyte, predominantly as small molecular weight metabolites. A further 8% of the 125I-associated radioactivity was secreted as intact NGA into bile by the non-lysosomal (direct) pathway while 6% remained in the liver 1 hr after the pulse. In contrast, of the 99mTc taken up by the liver, only 4% reappeared in the perfusate while 40% was secreted into bile by the lysosomal (indirect) pathway and 55% remained in the liver 1 hr after the pulse. Since labeled metabolites of 99mTc-NGA do not appear in plasma, this permits kinetic modeling with 99mTc-NGA without correction for labeled metabolites. Thus, 99mTc-NGA is an excellent candidate as a receptor-binding radiopharmaceutical.\r"

No abnormal uptake was seen in the regions of retroperitoneal fibrosis, while there was avid uptake in chest lesions later shown to represent small cell lung carcinoma. Retroperitoneal fibrosis which does not show gallium uptake is most likely mature, with few inflammatory elements. In patients with multiple retroperitoneal and/or mediastinal masses, gallium imaging may be useful in identifying the most active sites of disease for possible biopsy and for subsequent monitoring of response to therapy.\r"

The objective of this study was to implement several reconstruction methods designed for single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using 123I and to evaluate their performance in terms of quantitative accuracy, image artifacts, and noise. The methods consisted of four attenuation and scatter compensation schemes incorporated into both the filtered backprojection/Chang (FBP) and maximum likelihood-expectation maximization (ML-EM) reconstruction algorithms. The methods were evaluated on data acquired of a phantom containing a hot sphere of 123I activity in a lower level background 123I distribution and nonuniform density media. For both reconstruction algorithms, nonuniform attenuation compensation combined with either scatter subtraction or Metz filtering produced images that were quantitatively accurate to within 15% of the true value. The ML-EM algorithm demonstrated quantitative accuracy comparable to FBP and smaller relative noise magnitude for all compensation schemes.\r"

Neurologic manifestations vary in frequency depending upon the overall stage of HIV disease; diagnostic difficulties may be encountered because of HIV's effect on cerebrospinal fluid parameters. The uncertainties of management of neurosyphilis in this setting provide and example of these problems. As is the case with other organ systems, the main goal of neurodiagnostic efforts is to find the increasing number of treatable components of neuropsychiatric dysfunction.\r"

Clinicians must work to overcome long-standing antipathy towards this population in order to provide appropriate care, as well as to develop an understanding of the process of addiction and of the addict as a patient. The use of relationship skills, limit setting, and contingency contracting and an ability to choose and gain access to appropriate and/or available chemical dependency treatment options are important in the care of these patients. Finally, an adequate biomedical knowledge base of the medical complications of IVDUs, as well as the care of drug-related complications and withdrawal and overdose syndromes, is necessary to provide optimal care. In addition, the IVDU may have certain features of HIV-related disease that differ from those of other groups, and the clinician must be familiar with these features. Provision of such care is within the scope of the primary care clinician and can improve patient retention in treatment and the outcomes of such treatment, as well as both patient and clinician satisfaction.\r"

Use of alcohol and crack cocaine can be associated with a higher risk of HIV infection because of decreased risk reduction behaviors.

Controversial issues in the management of HIV illness include: assessment and management of latent syphilis in patients with intercurrent HIV infection; risk assessment and postexposure zidovudine prophylaxis of health care workers after occupational accidents; determination of the risk of reactivation tuberculosis in HIV-infected individuals; and treatment or nontreatment of infections with the Mycobacterium avium complex in symptomatic patients.

With the advent of increasingly effective therapy, including intervention early in the course of infection, there will be a growing need for physicians technically and attitudinally prepared to provide primary care for HIV-infected individuals. For any disease, however, determination of which physicians provide the bulk of care depends on several factors, including the prevalence and chronicity of the disease, the complexity, rate of change, and toxicity of therapy, and the socioeconomic characteristics of patients with the disease. General internists will clearly constitute a large part of the pool of practitioners caring for HIV-infected patients, especially in the earlier stages of infection. It seems reasonable to expect every general internist to be competent in four aspects of HIV care: counseling about transmission and prevention; the proper administration and interpretation of diagnostic tests; monitoring and care of patients in early stages of infection; and recognition of complications of advanced infection for proper management or referral. Academically based generalists will have a major role in research, teaching, and patient care in the AIDS epidemic. The organization and delivery of primary and specialty care for HIV-infected people in future years will continue to evolve with changes in therapy and in the demography of the epidemic.\r"

Clinical trials with zidovudine have demonstrated efficacy and greatly reduced toxicity when the drug is used for asymptomatic HIV-infected persons who have fewer than 500 CD4+ cells/mm3. Also, the optimum dose of zidovudine is lower than previously believed, probably in the range of 300-500 mg daily in oral divided doses. The use of antibiotics to prevent Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is also of clear value for HIV-infected asymptomatic or symptomatic persons with fewer than 200 CD4+ cells/mm3. While aerosolized pentamidine is the only regimen approved for PCP prophylaxis, oral drugs, such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or dapsone, also appear effective. Together, these and similar advances argue for the widespread use of voluntary HIV testing to enable optimum medical monitoring and appropriate intervention. These issues and recommendations for laboratory and clinical monitoring are provided in this review.\r"

The pathologic changes of small-vessel injury, injury mechanism, and the feasibility for early anastomosis of these vessels in the maxillofacial region following high-velocity missile wounds were studied. Dogs' faces were wounded by a steel sphere, weighing 0.7 g and 1.03 g, with an initial velocity of 1,300 m/s or 1,500 m/s. Angiography and high-speed x-ray photography were used to record the effect of injury to blood vessels and other tissues. The pathologic changes in the small blood vessels in the wounds were studied by light microscopy (LM) and electron microscopy (EM). Anastomosis of small vessels in the wound was performed at different times after injury. There were temporary cavity effects and small vascular injury in the wounds. The pathologic changes of the small vessels included microthrombus formation, endothelial loss, breaks in the internal elastic layer, and necrosis. Degeneration of cells was found to end 3 cm from the wound edge. Anastomosis of the vessels performed 3 days after injury provided good short-term patency. These results suggest that the operation for repairing facial defects should be performed 3 days after injury.\r"

  ".W": "Maximum voluntary bite force has been used to evaluate functional changes following orthognathic surgery. It has been proposed by others that maximum voluntary bite force may depend, in part, on sensory input from the dentition. However, results from previous studies have shown contradictory effects of local anesthesia on bite force following anesthetization of the dentition. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of drug-induced local anesthesia on the generation of first molar bite force and electromyographic (EMG) activity in adults. Twenty normal adults (3 women, 17 men) were evaluated. Electromyographic activity was monitored from four muscles of mastication bilaterally, and bite force was concurrently recorded at the right and left first molars. Maximal and submaximal bite forces were then measured after sequential unilateral anesthetization of the right mandible and maxilla with 2% lidocaine containing 1:100,000 epinephrine. No statistically significant differences in bite force or integrated EMG levels were observed between the unanesthetized and anesthetized sides, nor on the anesthetized side at different levels of anesthesia.\r"

A mean inferior displacement of 3.33 mm and anterior displacement of 2.18 mm were observed tomographically after surgery. Postoperatively, a geometric splint was constructed to compensate for the magnitude of condylar displacement and was used to replace the original splint to hold the distal segment in an overcorrected position. Skeletal fixation was maintained for 5 to 6 weeks. Tomographic evaluation of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) during maxillomandibular fixation showed a slight superior (1.03 mm) and posterior (0.51 mm) movement of the condyle in the fossa. After release of fixation and removal of splint, a further superior (2.05 mm) and posterior (1.01 mm) repositioning of the condyle was observed. This later movement correlated with the placement of light class III elastic traction to seat the condyles into the glenoid fossae and establish a class I occlusion. Temporomandibular joint tomograms confirmed complete seating of the condyles in the fossa and lateral cephalograms demonstrated a corresponding change in the position of the mandible to the desired postoperative position. This technique has been effective in preventing postoperative malocclusion resulting from condylar sag.\r"

Only in three joints did arthrography demonstrate the existence of perforation in the posterior attachment that had not been suspected during the clinical examination. Because of the doubtful importance of arthrographic information for the decision-making process, it is suggested that the method be applied only in cases in which clinical examination and plain radiographs have failed to uncover the signs and symptoms indicative of a TMJ disorder.\r"

The animals were divided into three treatment groups (A, B, or C) and treated with conventional treatment (CT), CT plus demineralized bone powder, or CT plus ASBA. In phase II, bone defects were created in the mandibles of 17 New Zealand white rabbits and then grafted with ASBA. Assessment of healing and vascular ingrowth was made at 2-day intervals through 3 weeks postoperatively, and then weekly until termination at 60 days postoperatively. Phase I results showed significantly enhanced healing in the ASBA-treated group when compared with the other treatment methods and healed fracture strength, which was comparable to the nonfractured, contralateral mandibular angle. Phase II results demonstrated vascular structures in the ASBA material by 4 days postoperatively and osteogenesis by 12 days postoperatively.\r"

The agents have similar plasma half-lives, and both are cleared solely by the kidneys. Foscarnet has a low solubility and a high degree of ionization at physiologic pH, requiring it to be administered in higher doses and larger volumes. Both drugs are administered as an initial induction regimen followed by a long-term maintenance regimen. Among patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) who have CMV retinitis, the efficacy of long-term maintenance therapy, as measured by median time to retinitis progression, appears to be similar for the two drugs. The major toxicity of ganciclovir is myelosuppression, with dose-limiting neutropenia occurring in approximately 16% and thrombocytopenia in 5% of AIDS patients. The major toxicity of foscarnet is nephrotoxicity, with dose-limiting toxicity occurring in approximately 10-23% of patients; other effects of foscarnet include hypocalcemia, which may be associated with seizure and arrhythmia. Studies in vitro indicate an additive or synergistic inhibitory effect on CMV when these two drugs are combined, suggesting that lower-dose combination regimens or higher-dose alternating regimens may result in greater efficacy with less toxicity than with either drug alone.\r"

  ".W": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis is the most common cause of blindness in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Ganciclovir, a guanosine nucleoside, has been found to be effective in the short-term treatment of CMV retinitis and in the delay of progression to recurrence of the disease. However, ganciclovir has no intrinsic activity against HIV, and patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome often require treatment with zidovudine, the only currently approved therapy for HIV infection. Both agents have been associated with dose-limiting granulocytopenia in such patients, and death from sepsis in the setting of profound decreases in absolute granulocyte counts has been reported. However, recent investigation suggests that with careful patient selection and monitoring, relatively safe concomitant therapy may be possible. This article reviews the toxicity issues that influence the decision to employ concomitant therapy with ganciclovir and zidovudine. An approach to dosing ganciclovir, including a schema for modifying or interrupting the zidovudine dosage based on hematologic status, is also presented. A prospective study is presently under way to determine whether combined therapy in selected patients leads to prolonged survival and a decreased incidence of recurrence of active CMV retinitis.\r"

In an ongoing randomized, controlled trial, AIDS patients with CMV retinitis are receiving standard ganciclovir therapy or ganciclovir plus recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rHuGM-CSF). rHuGM-CSF is administered by daily subcutaneous injections and is given in ascending doses based on the neutrophil response in the individual patient. Preliminary data obtained from 36 evaluable patients (21 receiving ganciclovir alone, 15 receiving ganciclovir plus rHuGM-CSF) suggest that rHuGM-CSF administration is associated with a trend toward a decrease in the proportion of patients developing an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of less than 750 cells/microliter (40% vs. 59%), in the overall incidence of such neutropenic episodes (20 vs. 68), and in the duration of ganciclovir treatment interruption due to the development of an ANC of less than 500 cells/microliter (5.5 days vs. 10.1 days). rHuGM-CSF administration has been generally well tolerated, and no consistent proliferative effect of this agent on human immunodeficiency virus infection has been observed. Definitive conclusions regarding the coadministration of rHuGM-CSF and ganciclovir await completion of the trial.\r"

All were homosexual men who had CMV on colonic biopsy. CMV colitis was the index diagnosis for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 11 (25%) of the 44 patients. All had diarrhea, but it was intermittent in 13 patients (30%). Bleeding was uncommon, but 35 patients (80%) were febrile (median temperature of 38.9 degrees C). Weight loss was reported by 39 patients (89%), among whom the median loss was 6.8 kg. Endoscopy revealed normal colonic mucosa but CMV on biopsy in 11 patients (25%). Colonoscopic biopsies positive for CMV were found only in the cecum in 7 (39%) of 18 patients. Most patients (54%) had received zidovudine before the diagnosis of CMV colitis. The median time to the development of CMV colitis after the diagnosis of AIDS was 16 months in those patients who had received zidovudine and 3 months in those who had not (p less than 0.02). We conclude that CMV colitis can present early in AIDS and often with such nonspecific signs as fever, intermittent diarrhea, weight loss, and hematochezia. Importantly, it can appear normal on colonoscopy and occurs frequently only in the right colon, necessitating full colonoscopy and multiple biopsies for accurate diagnosis.\r"

Ganciclovir is a guanosine analogue that selectively inhibits CMV DNA polymerase when intracellularly phosphorylated to its active form. In patients with CMV retinitis, induction therapy with ganciclovir results in high rates of clinical and virologic response; maintenance therapy is required to forestall progression of disease. Clinically relevant resistance of CMV to ganciclovir has recently been reported. Decreased phosphorylation of ganciclovir to its active form has been observed in cells infected with resistant strains, suggesting that CMV may encode a ganciclovir-phosphorylating enzyme whose function is deleted by mutation, conferring resistance. Further study is needed to establish the mechanism of resistance and to define the prevalence of resistance in the clinical setting.\r"

  ".W": "It has been suggested that cofactors in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, particularly other viral infections, may accelerate progression to the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). We have shown that in a population of 108 HIV-infected hemophiliacs observed for up to 9 years after the first documented HIV seroconversion, coinfection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) adversely influenced the course of the disease; in particular, logistic regression analysis showed that the age-adjusted relative risk of developing AIDS in CMV-seropositive patients was 2.5 times that in CMV seronegatives (p = 0.02). A number of potential mechanisms for the interaction of HIV and CMV have been proposed. Several groups have reported interaction at a molecular level between HIV and other viruses, including CMV, through transactivation of the HIV genome. Mechanisms by which the two viruses might gain entry to the same cell have been identified in vitro; these include Fc receptor-mediated uptake of antibody-coated HIV by CMV-infected fibroblasts. There is also some evidence that coinfection with HIV and CMV can occur in vivo, within brain cells. Interaction between these two viruses might also occur indirectly through the production of cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor. Identification of cofactors in HIV infection may help in understanding the pathogenesis of AIDS, and may provide an important opportunity for intervention in the progression of the disease, particularly when an infectious agent for which specific therapy is available is identified.\r"

Its effect against CMV in vitro and in vivo suggests its usefulness in other types of CMV infection as well. Investigations of the use of this agent in the treatment of AIDS patients with CMV gastrointestinal disease and in the treatment or prevention of CMV disease in transplant recipients are ongoing. In other studies, issues important to the management of patients receiving ganciclovir therapy are being addressed. Particular objectives include characterizing the scope of ganciclovir resistance in CMV, detailing the prospects for the tolerance of coadministered ganciclovir and zidovudine, and determining the plausibility of enhancing drug delivery through the concomitant use of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and through oral administration of the agent.\r"

The early diagnosis of CMV retinitis depends on patient awareness of often subtle clinical symptoms; screening examinations may be of benefit. Aggressive treatment of the condition is imperative. Ganciclovir administered intravenously has been shown to be effective therapy, but treatment must be continued indefinitely and is associated with a risk of neutropenia. Careful monitoring during treatment is required. Investigational methods of treatment, including intravitreal injection of ganciclovir or use of foscarnet, another antiviral agent, may be of benefit if intravenous ganciclovir therapy must be discontinued.\r"

Basal and thrombin-induced [3H]inositol monophosphate ([3H]IP1), [3H]inositol bisphosphate ([3H]IP2) and [3H]inositol trisphosphate ([3H]IP3) production were measured in [3H]myoinositol-labeled platelets in the presence of lithium chloride and in the presence or absence of test drugs. Desipramine, imipramine, amitriptyline and iprindole inhibited thrombin-stimulated formation of [3H]IP2 and [3H]IP3 in human platelets but had no significant effect on [3H]IP1 formation. In contrast, trazodone, mianserin, cocaine and phenelzine had no effect on inositol phosphate formation in thrombin-stimulated human platelets. The neuroleptics thioridazine and chlorpromazine also decreased thrombin-stimulated [3H]IP2 and [3H]IP3 production but not [3H]IP1 in human platelets, whereas haloperidol had no significant effect.

All of the drugs tested except phenelzine and thioridazine increased the accumulation of [3H]PI, [3H]PIP and [3H]PIP2. Thioridazine increased levels of [3H]PI but decreased the level of [3H]PIP and [3H]PIP2, whereas phenelzine had no effect on [3H]PI, [3H]PIP and [3H]PIP2 interconversion in human platelets.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We performed functional studies on the opossum internal anal sphincter (IAS) smooth muscle strips and receptor binding studies in the IAS smooth muscle membranes to examine the influence of: human calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-(8-37) on the fall in IAS tension caused by human CGRP I and CGRP II and on [125I]human CGRP I binding on the IAS smooth muscle membranes. We also compared the ability of [Tyr0]-rat CGRP 28-37 to displace the radioligand from the IAS membranes to that of human CGRP-(8-37). Human CGRP-(8-37) caused significant and dose-dependent right-ward shifts of the dose-response curves of both CGRP I and CGRP II on the IAS smooth muscle. The specific binding of [125I]human CGRP I to IAS smooth muscle membranes was time- and temperature-dependent. CGRP antagonists human CGRP-(8-37) and [Tyr0]-rat CGRP 28-37 and CGRP I and CGRP II caused dose-dependent displacement of the radioligand. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and calcitonin on the other hand had no significant effect on the radioligand binding. Tachyphylaxis and cross tachyphylaxis to the effects of CGRP I and CGRP II were observed. The CGRP antagonists and CGRP I and CGRP II tachyphylaxis failed to modify the fall in the IAS tension in response to neural stimulation by electrical field stimulation. From these studies we conclude: human CGRP-(8-37) and [Tyr0]-rat CGRP 28-37 may serve as potential antagonists of CGRP action; human CGRP I and CGRP II may act on the same receptor on the IAS smooth muscle; and CGRP may not play a significant role in the IAS relaxation in response to electrical field stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "In the present experiments we have investigated the possible coupling of 5-hydroxytryptamine (HT)3 receptors to the metabolism of phosphatidylinositol (PI) in the rat fronto-cingulate and entorhinal cortices, two brain regions with relatively high density of this receptor subtype. 5-HT dose-dependently increases PI turnover (20-80% increase above basal stimulation), with an EC50 of 0.5 and 0.3 microM for fronto-cingulate and entorhinal cortices, respectively. This effect was blocked by the selective 5-HT3 antagonists, BRL 43694 (granisetron), GR 38032F (ondansetron) and ICS 205-930. The selective 5-HT3 receptor agonists, 2-methyl-serotonin (2-Me-5-HT) and phenylbiguanide (PBG), mimicked the action of 5-HT and dose-dependently produced a significant increase in PI turnover (46-76% of the 5-HT response). The stimulatory action of 2-Me-5-HT and phenylbiguanide was blocked completely by granisetron, ondansetron and ICS 205-930 but not by other receptor antagonists such as (+/-)-pindolol (a beta, 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptor antagonist), methy-sergide (a 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptor antagonist), ritanserin (a 5-HT1C and 5-HT2 receptor antagonist), SR 95103 (gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor antagonist), scopolamine (a muscarinic antagonist), (-)-eticlopride (a D2 receptor antagonist), SCH 23390 (a D1 5-HT2/1C receptor antagonist) and prazosin (an alpha-1 receptor antagonist). In addition, the stimulation of PI turnover by 2-Me-5-HT was antagonized stereospecifically by the 5-HT3 receptor blocker zacopride. Thus, only the active enantiomer (S)-zacopride, but not the less active enantiomer (R)-zacopride, was effective in blocking the 2-Me-5-HT-induced effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effects of LTD4 and LTE4 but not LTC4 can be blocked by the mammalian antagonist L-649,923. Characterization of specific binding sites for [3H]LTC4 on membrane preparations from American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) ventricle was carried out. Binding assays were done in the presence of serine (5 mM) and borate (10 mM) for 30 min at 23 degrees C. Under these conditions, no metabolism of LTC4 to LTD4 occurred. Specific binding of [3H]LTC4 reached steady state within 10 min, remained constant for 60 min, and was reversible with the addition of 1000-fold excess unlabeled LTC4. Scatchard analysis of the binding data indicated a single class of binding sites with a Kd of 33.9 nM and maximal binding capacity of 51.6 pmol/mg of protein. Competition binding studies revealed an order of potency of LTC4 greater than LTD4 greater than LTE4 with Ki values of 47, 11766 and 32248 nM, respectively. Glutathione and hematin had Ki values of 50566 and 6014 nM, respectively, suggesting that the LTC4 receptor is not a site on glutathione transferase. Two mammalian LTD4 antagonists, L-649,923 and LY171883 failed to inhibit specific binding of [3H]LTC4, suggesting that the LTC4 receptor is distinct from the LTD4 receptor. Guanosine-5'-O-3-thiotriphosphate did not affect specific binding of [3H]LTC4 indicating that, like mammalian LTC4 receptors, a Gi protein is not involved in the transduction mechanism. LTC4 acts on bullfrog hearts through specific membrane receptors and is similar to its mammalian counterpart.\r"

  ".W": "In pentobarbital-anesthetized rats, SK&F 87516 (1.25-80 micrograms/kg/min intravenously over 15 min), the fluoro analog of the selective DA-1 dopamine receptor agonist fenoldopam produced dose-related decreases in carotid artery blood pressure that faded during the infusion period. These effects were abolished by SCH 23390, prolonged by ritanserin, but unchanged by bilateral vagotomy, atenolol, ICI 118,551, idazoxan, methylatropine or S-sulpiride. SK&F 87516 also inhibited the hypotensive effects of clonidine and of the DA-1 receptor agonist fenoldopam, but not of acetylcholine. In pithed rats, SK&F 87516 produced a biphasic vasopressor response. The initial phase was enhanced by SCH 23390 and converted to a transient hypotension by idazoxan. The secondary response was inhibited by ritanserin and enalapril. In pithed, but not in intact rats, SK&F 87516 increased plasma renin activity. In intact rats, SK&F 87516 produced dose-related bradycardic effects that were inhibited (50%) by idazoxan, methylatropine or bilateral vagotomy and abolished by chlorisondamine or pithing. In pithed rats pretreated with either saline or idazoxan, SK&F 87516 reduced the tachycardia to electrical stimulation of preganglionic more than that to postganglionic cardioaccelerator nerve fibers. However, it did not modify heart rate increases evoked by intravenous norepinephrine. In conclusion, SK&F 87516 produces hypotension via vascular DA-1 receptor stimulation. The fading of this effect during the infusion of SK&F 87516 may be related to the partial agonist property of this compound at DA-1 receptors and the stimulation of 5-hydroxytryptamine-2 receptors. SK&F 87516 also behaves as a partial agonist at alpha-2 adrenoceptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The whole stomach was perfused at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min with saline (pH 4.5) in the absence of acid secretion, the pH of the perfusate and PD were continuously monitored and the HCO3- output was measured as acid-neutralizing capacity by back-titration of the perfusate to pH 4.5. YM-14673, given intravenously at the doses (0.1-1 mg/kg) that stimulated acid secretion, increased the pH and HCO3- output in a dose-dependent fashion, but did not significantly affect the PD. Prostaglandin E2 (1 mg/kg) elevated the pH and HCO3- output with concomitant decrease in the PD, whereas carbachol (4 micrograms/kg), similar to YM-14673, produced an increase of the pH and HCO3- output with no change in the PD. The net HCO3- output (4.3 +/- 0.3 muEq) induced by 0.3 mg/kg of YM-14673 was about 60 and 150% of that induced by prostaglandin E2 and carbachol, respectively. The increased pH and HCO3- responses caused by YM-14673 were almost completely abolished by vagotomy, significantly inhibited by atropine (0.3 mg/kg, intravenously) and indomethacin (5 mg/kg, subcutaneously) but not affected by pirenzepine (1 mg/kg, intravenously). These results suggest that YM-14673, a thyrotropin-releasing hormone analog, produced vagally mediated HCO3- secretion in the rat stomach, and the mechanism may involve the cholinergic system, which is mediated with muscarinic M2 receptors and interacts with endogenous prostaglandins.\r"

Scatchard analysis of [3H] ryanodine binding indicated an homogenous site with a Kd value of 6.4 nM. The maximum number of ryanodine binding sites was 488 fmol of [3H]ryanodine per milligram of protein. Norepinephrine (NE) or ATP endogenously released after electrical field stimulation (tetrodoxin-sensitive responses), both produced a biphasic contraction of the RVD when the action of the other was blocked. When NE was the agonist (prazosin-sensitive response), the initial transient contraction was suppressed by 30 microM ryanodine whereas the secondary component was abolished by 2 microM nifedipine. When ATP was the agonist (P2 tachyphylaxis-sensitive response), both phases of the contraction were suppressed by 2 microM nifedipine. However, the initial phasic component of the contraction induced by endogenously released ATP was also inhibited by 30 microM ryanodine except at high stimulation frequency (10 Hz). Exogenously added NE and alpha, beta methylene ATP produced concentration-dependent contractions of the RVD. The effect of both agonists was inhibited by 2 microM nifedipine whereas 30 microM ryanodine had little effect except at high concentrations of NE. We conclude that ryanodine binding sites reside in RVD endoplasmic reticulum. There was a lack of uniformity in the effect of ryanodine and nifedipine against alpha adrenoceptor stimulation and purinoceptor stimulation indicating a difference in the stimulation-contraction coupling process between these two modes of stimulation.\r"

Imipramine inhibited the Na+ current with a dissociation constant value of 25 microM at a -130 mV holding potential. At 1 microM, imipramine caused a negative shift of the channel availability curve by 4.0 +/- 1.03 mV with its steepness unaffected. The inactivation time constants were not changed by 30 microM imipramine. Paired pulse experiments revealed that imipramine binds to the inactivated Na+ channels with time constants of 3.7 +/- 0.27 sec at -65 mV and 2.4 +/- 0.58 sec at -20 mV, and that it dissociates from the channels with time constants of 5.9 +/- 1.05 sec at -90 mV and 2.0 +/- 0.87 sec at -130 mV. From these paired pulse experiments, the dissociation constant for the interactions between imipramine and inactivated channels was calculated to be 0.67 microM, a value within its therapeutic plasma concentration. These slow interactions of imipramine with inactivated Na+ channels resulted in a slow onset of the frequency-dependent extrablock in the effects of imipramine on the Na+ current. Consequently, the imipramine-induced extrablock sufficient to terminate re-entrant tachyarrhythmias would not develop shortly after their initiation. Short depolarizations of 1- to 3-msec duration sustained appreciable extra blockage when a high concentration of 10 microM imipramine was used, or they were repeatedly applied at a high frequency. However, access of imipramine to the open channels seems to play a minor role in the drug-channel interactions.\r"

Sensory nerve desensitization with capsaicin greatly reduced and in some cases almost abolished TDI-induced contractions. The neutral endopeptidase inhibitor phosphoramidon significantly increased the contractile response to TDI. Pretreatment with the substance P antagonist (D-Arg1,D-Pro2,D-Trp7,9,Leu11)-substance P greatly reduced TDI-induced contractions. These results suggest that TDI activates the \"efferent\" function of capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves and that neutral endopeptidase may play a role in modulating the response in guinea pigs.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of adolescent morphine exposure on the sexual maturation of male rats, their reproductive capacity and the development of their progeny were examined. Groups of prepubescent male rates (25-27 days of age) were implanted with morphine- or placebo-pellets (one on Day 1, then two pellets on Days 4, 7 and 10); the pellets were not removed to assure the sustained release of morphine for 3 to 4 weeks and to avoid the confounding effects of a precipitated withdrawal syndrome. Groups of animals were sacrificed at weekly intervals through adulthood for an assessment of reproductive endocrine function. A large group, however, was also bred with drug-naive primiparous females at 85 days of age (8 weeks after morphine or placebo pellet implantation), when the acute and chronic effects of morphine on reproductive endocrine parameters had dissipated; their fertility and the development of the male and female progeny was characterized. Our results indicated that morphine exposure during adolescence led to a pronounced inhibition of a number of indices of sexual maturation (e.g., serum testosterone and luteinizing hormone levels and reduced weights of the testes and seminal vesicles). Breeding morphine- and placebo-implanted male rats with drug-naive females resulted in smaller liters derived from morphine-treated fathers when compared to controls, but in all other respects the development of the offspring in the two groups were equivalent. However, upon reaching adulthood, a number of selective endocrine differences were detected in morphine-derived offspring when compared to controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "During reperfusion in the isolated right ventricular wall of the rat after 60 min of ischemia, developed tension and resting tension were 35 +/- 4 and 221 +/- 12%, respectively, of preischemic values. Including 35 microM ouabain in the perfusate before and after ischemia resulted in more severe cardiac dysfunction during reperfusion than in drug-untreated hearts. Introduction of the Na(+)-H+ exchange inhibitor, 5-(N,N-dimethyl)-amiloride (DMA), could effectively protect the right ventricular wall against ischemia-reperfusion dysfunction in the presence or absence of ouabain. The ion content in the right ventricular wall was measured with atomic absorbance spectrophotometry. Before ischemia, Na+,Ca++ and K+ content were 53.4 +/- 6.4, 2.70 +/- 0.22 and 262 +/- 7.7 mumol/g of dry weight tissue, respectively. After 60 min of ischemia and 6 min of reperfusion, Na+,Ca++ and K+ content were 73.4 +/- 7.2, 3.79 +/- 0.31 and 180 +/- 15 mumol/g of dry weight tissue, respectively (P less than .05). Introduction of 20 microM DMA normalized ion content in the muscles which was consistent with the contractile function recovery during reperfusion. The data suggest that a rise in intracellular Na+ in the early stage of reperfusion represents a crucial or primary step for the development of cardiac contractile dysfunction. DMA, which protects against severe reperfusion-induced cardiac contractile dysfunction, appears to act via a normalization of tissue sodium levels. This action is consistent with its proposed role as a blocker of transsarcolemmal Na(+)-H+ exchange.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of chronic lithium (Li) treatment upon the secondary reinforcing effects of opioid agonists and antagonists was examined by use of an unbiased place preference conditioning procedure. Administration of the mu-agonist morphine to control rats resulted in marked preferences for the drug-associated place and a similar effect was observed in response to the psychostimulant d-amphetamine. In contrast, the selective kappa-opioid agonist U-69593 [(5 alpha,7 alpha,8 beta)-(-)-N-methyl-N-(7-1(pyrrolidinyl-1-oxaspirol(4,5) dec-8-yl benzeneacetamide)] and the opioid antagonist naloxone produced dose-related place aversions. Chronic administration of a Li-containing diet, which produced serum levels of 0.56 mmol/l, abolished the place preferences induced by morphine but not d-amphetamine. This treatment abolished the aversive effects of naloxone but did not modify those produced by U-69593. These data and those from a previous place conditioning study indicate that Li can function as an antagonist of mu-opioid receptor ligands in vivo and that this action underlies its motivational effects. Furthermore, the inability of chronic Li treatment to modify either the content or basal release of beta-endorphin in various brain regions suggests that this antagonism is mediated directly at the level of the opioid receptor and/or its transducer systems.\r"

  ".W": "The cardiac glycoside, digoxin, is clinically used to treat fetal tachyarrhythmias and congestive heart failure. The time course of digoxin transfer across the human placenta was studied by dually perfusing an isolated lobule of the human placenta in vitro. Viability of the placental preparation was validated by measuring the rates of glucose and oxygen consumption, lactate production and synthesis of the protein hormone, chorionic gonadotropin. Following administration of 5 ng/ml digoxin to the maternal circulation, digoxin appeared in the fetal circulation within 5 min. The disappearance of digoxin from the maternal circulation was biexponential and best fit a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model. Mean calculated volume of the central compartment (257 +/- 6.3 ml) was consistent with the actual volume of the in vitro maternal circulation (246 +/- 7.4 ml). The half-life of the distribution phase was 9.7 +/- 3.3 min, and half-life of the terminal elimination phase was 362 +/- 83 min. After 30 min of perfusion, the amount of digoxin leaving the maternal circulation and appearing in the fetal circulation was constant at a fetomaternal mass ratio of 0.36 +/- 0.04. This ratio was maintained through to the end of the 3-hr experiment. All of the digoxin leaving the maternal circulation could be accounted for either in the fetal circulation or bound to placental tissue. The time to achieve equal concentrations on both sides of the placenta was estimated to be 268 +/- 34 min. These data are consistent with in vivo data obtained in humans, and support the relevance of using the in vitro placental perfusion model to obtain information regarding placental drug transfer in humans.\r"

The [14C] salicylic acid apparent reabsorptive permeability (P'I-b, 10(-5) cm/s) was measured at 19 degrees C with luminal solutions kept at different pH and bath maintained at pH 7.4. In S2 tubules, P'I-b was 25.0 +/- 3.5 when luminal pH was 6.0; P'I-b decreased to 8.1 +/- 1.4 and to 4.4 +/- 1.2 at a luminal pH of 6.5 and 7.0, respectively. In S3 tubules, P'I-b was 17.6 +/- 2.4, 5.3 +/- 1.1 and 3.4 +/- 1.1 at a luminal pH of 6.0, 6.5 and 7.0, respectively. There was a close correlation between P'I-b and the calculated proportion of nonionized salicylic acid present at each pH, indicating that only the nonionized molecule could diffuse in our conditions. We calculated the apparent permeability of nonionic salicylic acid and found 0.248 +/- 0.032 cm/s for S2 and 0.176 +/- 0.022 cm/s for S3 tubules. These calculated permeabilities were independent of pH.\r"

Single unit extracellular recordings were made of dorsal horn neurons responding to both innocuous and noxious peripheral stimuli. Mixed effects on neuronal responses were seen after intrathecal administration of lower doses of the kappa agonists but with higher doses selective inhibitions of C fiber-evoked responses were produced by either U50488H or U69593 in both the adult (ED50 420 and 250 micrograms, respectively) and pup (ED50 63 and 13 micrograms, respectively). In the adult intrathecal U50488H similarly inhibited the more prolonged nociceptive response evoked by s.c. formalin. Intravenous U50488H (4 mg/kg) also produced a rapid and selective inhibition of nociceptive responses in the adult rat. Intrathecal administration of the nonselective opiate antagonist naloxone reduced the inhibitions mediated by U50488H and U69593 in the pup and the adult. However, intrathecal norbinaltorphimine, a selective kappa antagonist, only prevented the action of the kappa agonists in the pup and not in the adult. Kappa receptors are reported to be sparse in the adult rat spinal cord so developmental changes in this receptor may be responsible for the differential action of norbinaltorphimine in the rat pup and adult.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was designed to assess the relative contribution of postjunctional alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors in neurally evoked cutaneous vasoconstrictor responses in anesthetized cats. Preganglionic stimulation of the thoracic sympathetic nerve trunk produced an intensity-related decrease of digital skin blood flow as measured by laser-Doppler flowmetry. Sympathetic-cholinergic sudomotor (electrodermal) responses were recorded simultaneously as an additional index of neuronal activation. Vasoconstrictor responses were not altered by pretreatment with i.v. propranolol (1 mg/kg) or atropine (1 mg/kg) and were refractory to low doses (2 mg/kg) of hexamethonium. As expected, atropine abolished evoked skin potential responses which were also sensitive only to higher doses (20 mg/kg) of hexamethonium. Pretreatment with either phentolamine (1 mg/kg i.v.), yohimbine (0.5 mg/kg i.v.) or prazosin (0.3 mg/kg i.v.) produced significant reduction of sympathetic vasoconstriction with blockade by phentolamine and yohimbine being far greater than that seen with prazosin. In animals previously given prazosin (0.3 mg/kg), subsequent administration of yohimbine (0.5 mg/kg) almost totally blocked the remaining evoked cutaneous vasoconstriction. These results demonstrate that both alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors are present in the cutaneous bed of the cat with the predominant effect mediated by innervated alpha-2 adrenoceptors.\r"

  ".U": "91171183\r", 
  ".W": "Glutamate stimulated the efflux of dopamine from slices of rat striatum superfused with a Krebs' bicarbonate buffer containing a physiological concentration of Mg++ (1.2 mM). This effect was observed in the presence of high concentrations of glutamate (3-10 mM), but not at lower concentrations (0.01-1 mM). The response was not accompanied by increased lactate dehydrogenase activity, a measure of glutamate neurotoxicity. At 10 mM, glutamate increased dopamine efflux by more than 9-fold. This was reduced to about 34% of the control response by either the competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (100 microM) or the noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist MK 801 [(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenso[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10- imine hydrogen maleate] (1-10 microM), but was unaffected by a kainate/quisqualate receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (10-100 microM). Glutamate-stimulated dopamine efflux also was unaffected by tetrodotoxin (0.5 microM), withdrawal of extracellular Ca++ [and addition of 1 mM ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid] or systemic administration of reserpine (5 mg/kg, 24 hr before the experiment), an inhibitor of the vesicular storage of dopamine. In contrast, nomifensine (10 microM), an inhibitor of high-affinity dopamine transport, reduced glutamate-induced dopamine efflux to 15% of the control response. Moreover, the response to glutamate was blocked by deleting NaCl from the medium. Collectively, these results suggest that, at high concentrations and in the presence of Mg++, glutamate can stimulate the release of dopamine by a mechanism that does not use Ca(++)-dependent exocytosis but instead involves a reversal of the dopamine transport system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Microinjections of serotonin (5-HT) delivered into the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) elicit opposite cardiovascular effects depending on the doses used; blood pressure and heart rate are decreased by low doses but increased by high doses. To examine this apparent contradiction, we compared cardiovascular and sympathetic nerve responses elicited in anesthetized rats by using glass micropipettes to inject 5-HT, the vehicle alone or various 5-HT agonists or antagonists into the NTS. Low (0.2 nmol) 5-HT doses lowered mean arterial pressure, heart rate and renal nerve activity consistently. By contrast, high (2 nmol) doses were relatively ineffective as were similar injections of the vehicle alone or of 5-HT1A or 5-HT2A agonists. Systemic cholinergic blockade with methylatropine abolished the bradycardia produced by low 5-HT doses with little or no effect on attendant depressor and sympathoinhibitory responses. Local blockade induced by injecting the 5-HT1A antagonist, WB4101, into the NTS abolished all 5-HT responses, but that induced with the 5-HT2 antagonist, ketanserin, inhibited the same responses only partially. These results suggest that low 5-HT doses injected into the NTS act mainly on 5-HT1A receptors to cause bradycardia through parasympathetic stimulation and lower blood pressure through sympathetic inhibition.\r"

In the cerebellar, cortical and olfactory bulb membranes, the density of high-affinity binding sites of all these tritiated benzodiazepine (BZ) ligands is almost identical. In contrast, in the striatum, the density of [3H]clonazepam and [3H]zolpidem binding sites is approximately 60 and 30%, respectively, of the density of [3H]diazepam, [3H]flunitrazepam or [3H]flumazenil sites. In spinal cord membranes, the number of high-affinity binding sites of [3H]clonazepam and [3H]zolpidem is less than 20% of the number of binding sites for [3H]diazepam, [3H]flunitrazepam, [3H]flumazenil and [3H]midazolam. Moreover, the displacement of [3H]flunitrazepam from spinal cord membranes by clonazepam and zolpidem was characterized by high IC50 values and Hill slopes significantly less than 1. Because [3H]BZ ligand binding in the spinal cord is enhanced by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), these data suggest that different regions of the rat central nervous system may contain different GABA-BZ receptor subtypes. The different pharmacological properties of clonazepam, diazepam and zolpidem (i.e., regarding their ability to enhance bicuculline seizure threshold, to decrease locomotor activity, to induce ataxia or to elicit anticonflict action) further support the concept that in the rat central nervous system preferential occupancy of heterogeneous GABAA receptors by these drugs can be related to their effects on behavior.\r"

Both spermine and bis-(3-aminopropyl)amine also potentiated the binding at a concentration over 10 microM, with the other polyamines examined being ineffective at similar concentrations. Glycine (Gly) at 10 microM additionally potentiated the binding through accelerating the initial association rate without affecting the binding at equilibrium in the presence of Glu alone, whereas SPD at 1 mM increased both the association rate and steady-state level found in the presence of Glu alone. This potentiation by SPD in the presence of Glu was not only prevented by competitive NMDA antagonists, but also antagonized by antagonists highly selective for strychnine-insensitive binding sites of Gly. Further addition of Gly reversed the inhibition by Gly antagonists without affecting that by NMDA antagonists. The SPD-dependent binding was significantly inhibited by various proteases and phospholipases, but not by glycosidases at the concentrations used. All brain regions examined had similar affinities for [3H]MK-801 with different densities of [3H]MK-801 binding sites when determined in the presence of both Glu and Gly. Further addition of SPD failed to affect either the affinity or density in the cerebellum, with the affinity being increased in the rest parts of rat brain. These results suggest that SPD may elicit a stimulatory action on the binding of [3H]MK-801 to open NMDA channels in a manner dependent on the NMDA recognition sites that absolutely require Gly for activation in the brain. The present findings are also suggestive of heterogeneity of the NMDA receptor complex in terms of the differential sensitivity to potentiation by SPD.\r"

The residual [3H]NMS [( 3H]NMSb) sites were widely distributed throughout rat brain and represented the predominant muscarinic receptor population. The autoradiographic distribution of [3H]NMSb sites did not correspond to that of [3H]pirenzepine or [3H]AF-DX 116, indicating that [3H]NMSb labeled non-M1, non-M2 muscarinic sites. Moreover, the pharmacological profile of [3H]NMSb differed from that of [3H]pirenzepine at M1 sites, and was inconsistent with that of M2 receptor binding sites. Although we were unable to pharmacologically distinguish subpopulations of non-M1, non-M2 binding sites, the anatomical distribution of [3H]NMSb sites corresponded to that of the combined mRNA distributions for m3 and m4.\r"

Concurrent or pretreatment of LDL with the synthetic peroxidase Ebselen and its cofactor glutathione totally prevented Cu+(+)-dependent oxidation, as measured by the formation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and LDL mobility on agarose gels. LDL could be oxidized in the absence of metals with peroxy radicals generated via homolysis of azo compounds. With the azo initiator, 2,2'-azobis-2-amidinopropane hydrochloride, Ebselen plus glutathione prevented lipid oxidation when present during oxidation. However, if LDL were first pretreated with Ebselen plus glutathione and these reagents removed before oxidation, they did not prevent oxidation. Analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography of lipids extracted from Cu+(+)- or azoperoxyl radical-modified lipoproteins indicated that the major lipid oxidation products were derived from linoleate and that Ebselen-glutathione addition reduced linoleate hydroperoxides. Oxidation of LDL by human monocyte-derived macrophages was also prevented by coincubation with Ebselen-glutathione or the antioxidant, probucol. These results demonstrate that initiation of Cu+(+)-dependent oxidation absolutely requires the presence of trace amounts of lipid hydroperoxides in the lipoprotein and that hydroperoxides play a major role in the propagation reactions even in the absence of added transition metals.\r"

These samples were analyzed for amounts of cytochrome P-450 IA2, IIC, IIE1 and IIIA and epoxide hydrolase per unit of microsomal protein using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunochemical staining. For each enzyme the amount of protein detected varied by two orders of magnitude, even within the set of normal liver samples. With respect to the liver samples judged to be normal, the cirrhotic samples showed decreased levels of P-450 IA2 and IIE1 and epoxide hydrolase (P less than .05). The level of P-450 IIIA proteins also appeared lower but the high variance did not allow such a statistically valid conclusion. The liver samples obtained from metastatic cancer patients did not show decreased levels of any of the proteins examined, and levels of P-450 IIC proteins were enhanced in this group compared to the controls. In the samples obtained from patients with other liver diseases, the only major change was a decrease in the level of P-450 IA2. These findings are of use in explaining some of the known effects of hepatic disease on the in vitro and in vivo metabolism of certain drugs.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of a number of purinoceptor agonists and antagonists on norepinephrine (NE) overflow were examined in the electrically field-stimulated rat vas deferens. The P1 receptor agonists adenosine and 2-chloroadenosine and the P2 receptor agonists ATP and beta, gamma-methylene ATP all reduced the overflow of NE, which was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection techniques. The P1 receptor antagonist 8-(p-sulfophenyl)-theophylline (8-SPT) and the P2 receptor desensitizing agent alpha, beta-methylene ATP blocked the inhibitory effects of both P1 and P2 receptor agonists. The pyrimidine nucleotide UTP also inhibited NE overflow and this effect was antagonized by 8-SPT. The adenosine uptake inhibitor S-p-nitrobenzyl-6-thioguanosine potentiated and adenosine deaminase blocked the inhibitory effect of adenosine on NE overflow but neither had any effect on the ability of the adenine nucleotides to inhibit NE overflow. These results indicate that adenine nucleotides can act per se, without conversion to adenosine, on a prejunctional receptor to inhibit the release of NE. Because the effects of the adenine nucleotides are antagonized by 8-SPT, it appears that they act at the same receptor as the adenine nucleosides. UTP apparently acts at this receptor as well. These findings suggest that prejunctional purinoceptors on the sympathetic nerves of the rat vas deferens differ from P1 or P2 receptors as usually defined and thus may represent a unique class of receptor (P3) as has been suggested for the prejunctional receptors of the rat caudal artery.\r"

At doses of L-366,682 or L-366,948 causing approximately 90 to 95% block (approximately the AD95 dose) of OT, the duration of action of the antagonists exceeded 145 min. Both compounds exhibited selectivity in the rat, as a dose of either at 300 micrograms/kg i.v. shifted the dose-response for OT-induced uterine contraction to the right by approximately 5-fold but did not affect the dose-response to prostaglandin F2 alpha. Furthermore, neither compound, at a dose of 3 mg/kg i.v., antagonized the action of arginine vasopressin acting at V-1 (pressor effect in pithed rats) or V-2 (antidiuretic) receptors. In conscious, freely moving, pregnant rhesus monkeys, L-366,948 or L-366,682 given i.v. or s.c. were effective antagonists of uterine contractions elicited by an infusion of OT. OT- or arginine vasopressin-like agonist activity was not observed in any of the in vivo models.

Serosal naloxone decreased DPDPE and DAMGO potencies under basal conditions with Ke values of 11 and 6 nM, respectively. DPDPE- and DAMGO-induced decreases in basal Isc were associated with increases in net Cl absorption; in addition, DAMGO produced an increase in net Na absorption. 8-Bromocyclic AMP (0.3 mM) increased Isc, decreased Gt and inhibited net Na and Cl absorptive fluxes. Selective opiate agonists decreased cyclic AMP-induced elevations in Isc with a rank order of potency (DPDPE, EC50 = 3 nM) of DPDPE greater than DAMGO greater than U-50,488. DPDPE reversed the action of cyclic AMP on Isc and Cl absorption but had no effect on net Na transport.

The pupillary effects of sufentanil were also compared with those of morphine and clonidine, known mydriatics in the cat. Sufentanil (0.3-10 micrograms/kg i.v.) dose-dependently increased pupillary size and decreased light reflex and fluctuations. Naltrexone (10 micrograms/kg i.v.) pretreatment shifted the dose-response curve to the right by a factor of 26 for pupillary size, 9.5 for light reflex and 7.2 for fluctuations (nonvalid bioassay). Equivalent mydriatic doses of sufentanil (1 micrograms/kg), morphine (0.5 mg/kg) and clonidine (10 micrograms/kg) produced divergent effects on the light reflex and fluctuations. At these doses, morphine was more effective than sufentanil in inhibiting fluctuations. Clonidine was a more potent inhibitor of fluctuations but significantly enhanced the light reflex. Sufentanil (compared with morphine in a previous study) was 298 times more potent than morphine as a mydriatic, 100 times more potent in inhibiting the light reflex, and only slightly more potent in inhibiting fluctuations. These results indicate that separate neural mechanisms control the three pupillary components and that mu opioid receptors are more involved in mediating opiate-induced mydriasis than in inhibiting the light reflex and fluctuations in the cat.\r"

  ".U": "91171196\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies strongly suggest that adenosine receptors on juxtaglomerular cells function to restrain the secretion of renin induced by a variety of stimuli. The clinical significance of this is that caffeine, a widely consumed adenosine receptor antagonist, could augment renin release responses to diseases such as renovascular hypertension, liver cirrhosis and heart failure and to therapeutic maneuvers such as salt restriction, diuretics and vasodilators. Caffeine may be particularly troublesome in this regard because this methylxanthine has central nervous system effects and intracellular actions that also might contribute to the overall ability of caffeine to potentiate renin secretion. The purpose of this study was to document the effects of caffeine on renin release responses to a vasodilator and to investigate what mechanisms were responsible for any augmentation of vasodilator-induced renin secretion. Accordingly, we compared the effects of caffeine vs. 1,3-dipropyl-8-p-sulfophenylxanthine (DPSPX; a xanthine that we documented in this study not to significantly enter the brain or penetrate cell membranes) on base-line and hydralazine-induced renin release in both normal and beta adrenoceptor-blocked (propranolol, 15 mg/kg) rats. Both xanthines (at a dose of 10 mg/kg plus 150 micrograms/min) attenuated adenosine-mediated hypotension and bradycardia, and DPSPX was at least as effective as caffeine in antagonizing peripheral adenosine receptors. Caffeine and DPSPX increased base-line plasma renin activity to a similar extent regardless of whether the animals were pretreated with propranolol. In rats with an intact beta adrenergic system, caffeine, but not DPSPX, increased the renin release response to low-dose hydralazine (1 mg/kg). Although both xanthines augmented the renin release response to high-dose hydralazine (10 mg/kg), caffeine was more efficacious in this regard. In beta adrenoceptor-blocked rats, neither caffeine nor DPSPX augmented the renin release response to low-dose hydralazine, whereas both xanthines equally potentiated the renin release response to high-dose hydralazine. These data demonstrate that caffeine increases base-line renin release primarily by blocking peripheral (most likely renal), cell-surface adenosine receptors; however, caffeine potentiates vasodilator-induced renin secretion in part by blocking peripheral (most likely renal), cell-surface adenosine receptors and in part by additional central nervous system and/or intracellular mechanism(s) that involve the beta adrenergic system.\r"

  ".W": "9-Methyl-7-bromoeudistomin D (MBED), a derivative of eudistomin D isolated from a marine tunicate, induced Ca++ release from the heavy fraction of fragmented sarcoplasmic reticulum (HSR) in the same way as that of caffeine, followed by spontaneous Ca++ reuptake in the Ca++ electrode experiment. The rate of 45Ca++ efflux from HSR vesicles was accelerated markedly by MBED or caffeine in a concentration-dependent manner. The 50% effective concentrations of MBED and caffeine were approximately 1 microM and 1 mM, respectively, indicating that MBED is 1000 times more potent than caffeine in HSR. Procaine, ruthenium red or Mg++ caused concentration-dependent inhibition of MBED-triggered Ca++ release from HSR. The bell-shaped profile of Ca++ dependence for MBED is very similar to that of caffeine. The caffeine-produced maximum response of 45Ca++ efflux was increased further by adenosine-5'-(beta, gamma-methyl-ene)triphosphate, whereas that was not changed by MBED. MBED also caused Ca++ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of chemically skinned fibers. These stimulatory effects of MBED on the Ca++ release from skeletal muscle SR were almost indistinguishable from those of caffeine except the difference in potencies. The [3H]ryanodine binding to junctional terminal cisternae membranes was not inhibited by MBED or caffeine. MBED did not cause Ca++ release from the light fraction of fragmented SR and turbidity change of mitochondrial suspension. These observations suggest a most likely idea that MBED binds to the caffeine-binding site in the Ca channel protein and thus produces the potentiation of Ca(++)-induced Ca++ release from SR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In vitro generation of oxygen-free radicals by xanthine oxidase (0.09 u/ml), acting on xanthine (25 microM) as a substrate, increased the permeability of the vesicles to calcium, determined by measuring net efflux of calcium after stopping pump-mediated fluxes, and decreased oxalate-supported calcium uptake and steady-state calcium load with no effect on Ca,Mg-ATPase activity. This effect of oxygen-free radicals was inhibited completely by superoxide dismutase, which eliminated completely superoxide anion radical production and caused an anticipated increase in hydrogen peroxide from the xanthine-xanthine oxidase reaction in our system. The xanthine-xanthine oxidase reaction decreased intravesicular-free calcium. The diminished level of intravesicular-free calcium, which was reflected by the decreased steady-state calcium load induced by oxygen-free radicals, was prevented by specific closure of the SR calcium release channel by ryanodine under established optimal conditions; under the same conditions, ryanodine also prevented superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of calcium uptake induced by oxygen-free radicals in the presence or absence of oxalate. Ryanodine was without effect on Ca,Mg-ATPase activity by itself and had no effect on any of the changes in calcium permeability mediated by the generation of oxygen-free radicals under the experimental conditions used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

SC-46749 is an analog of arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-phenylalanine in which the phenylalanine is replaced by O-methyltyrosine. In this study the biological activities of SC-46749 were examined and its actions compared with the tetrapeptide arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-serine (RGDS), one of the natural sequences on the fibrinogen alpha chain that binds to platelets. In vitro, SC-46749 was more potent than RGDS in inhibiting fibrinogen binding (IC50: SC-46749, 27 microM; RGDS, 47 microM), in preventing ADP-induced aggregation in human platelet-rich plasma (IC50: SC-46749, 32 microM; RGDS, 95 microM) and in inhibiting thrombin-induced aggregation in washed human platelets (IC50: SC-46749, 23 microM; RGDS, 64 microM). In rats, SC-46749 prevented collagen-induced thrombocytopenia with an ED50 of 0.87 mg/kg whereas RGDS did not inhibit the response by 50% at doses up to 10 mg/kg. SC-46749 inhibited thrombus formation in an electrically damaged rat carotid artery in a dose-dependent fashion whereas the effects of RGDS were biphasic. RGDS appeared to delay thrombus formation at lower doses but had no effect at higher doses. When infused in dogs for 15 min, SC-46749 prevented ex vivo collagen-induced aggregation at 4 mg/kg/min. These data demonstrate that SC-46749 is a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation and platelet-dependent thrombus formation.\r"

Two minor metabolites have been previously identified as N-hydroxypentamidine and N,N'-dihydroxypentamidine. In this study, the two major microsomal metabolites have been identified as the 2-pentanol and 3-pentanol analogs of pentamidine [1,5-di(4-amidinophenoxy)-2-pentanol; and 1,5-bis(4-amidinophenoxy)-3-pentanol]. As well, a seventh putative metabolite has been discovered and identified as para-hydroxybenzamidine, a fragment of the original drug. Whereas the cytochromes P-450 have been demonstrated as the enzyme system responsible for pentamidine metabolism, hydroxylation of the drug was not inducible by phenobarbital, beta-naphthoflavone, clofibrate, isosafrole, pregnenolone-16 alpha-carbonitrile, ethanol or pentamidine pretreatment of rats. The kinetics of the production of the two major microsomal metabolites has been determined as Km = 56 +/- 19 microM and Vmax = 126 +/- 21 pmol/min/mg microsomal protein for the 2-pentanol analog, and Km = 28 +/- 0.28 microM and Vmax = 195 +/- 2.4 pmol/min/mg microsomal protein for the 3-pentanol analog. Therefore, the mixed-function oxidases readily convert pentamidine to hydroxylated metabolites, but exactly which isozyme(s) of cytochrome P-450 is responsible is not clear.\r"

  ".W": "Differences in antinociceptive (inhibition of tail-flick response) action of morphine and Tyr-D-Ala2-Gly-NMePhe4-ol5 (DAMGO) were demonstrated by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of these agonists along with intrathecal (i.t.) administration of a variety of antagonists: yohimbine, methysergide, naloxone and nor-binaltorphimine. Intracerebroventricular morphine analgesia was antagonized by either i.t. yohimbine or methysergide, whereas i.c.v. DAMGO analgesia was only antagonized by i.t. methysergide. Thus, for i.c.v. morphine-induced analgesia, descending spinal noradrenergic and serotonergic systems were involved, whereas for DAMGO analgesia, only the serotonergic system was involved. The dose-response curve for i.c.v. morphine reached a plateau at high doses, whereas i.c.v. DAMGO analgesia peaked at 10 ng and then decreased thereafter, producing a bell-shaped dose-response curve. This decrement in analgesic response could be reversed by low doses of i.t. methysergide and i.t. pindolol. It was concluded that activation of serotonin-1 (5-HT1) receptors plays a role in the decrease in analgesia from high doses of DAMGO. Combinations of i.t. morphine with i.t. 5-HT or i.t. clonidine produced additive or greater analgesic responses. Combinations of i.t. DAMGO with i.t. 5-HT or i.t. clonidine produced less than additive interactions. Part of the latter responses appeared to be due to activation of 5-HT1 receptors; blockade of these receptors by pindolol enhanced i.t. DAMGO-induced analgesia. Morphine and DAMGO differ further because i.c.v. morphine activated a descending antianalgesic pathway mediated by spinal dynorphin A(1-17), whereas i.c.v. DAMGO at a high dose did not. Thus, morphine and DAMGO differ in their modes of antinociceptive action as measured by the tail-flick response.\r"

This list included several compounds never studied before at human receptors. Although dissociation was too rapid to measure reliably at this temperature, the Kd's for flunitrazepam were not significantly different when either rapid filtration or centrifugation was used to separate the bound from free radioligand. The most potent compound was triazolam (Kd = 0.54 nM); the least potent, chlordiazepoxide (Kd = 684 nM). The Kd's were significantly lower (about 3- to 7-fold) for several compounds tested at an equilibrium temperature of 0 degrees C compared to those obtained at 37 degrees C. There was a strong correlation for 15 compounds for the log Kd at rat brain receptors (data obtained from the literature) vs. the log Kd for human brain. In addition, the log Kd's of the various benzodiazepines for their receptor were significantly correlated with the log of their minimum daily dosages used to treat patients. Many of the benzodiazepines have clinically important active metabolites that have higher affinity for benzodiazepine binding sites in human brain than their parent compounds. Such data have important implications in the clinical use of these compounds.\r"

No major changes were found in [3H]flunitrazepam or [3H]muscimol binding parameters. Neither the dissociation constant(s) nor the Bmax for either ligand seemed to be modified during aging in hippocampus. Furthermore, the allosteric interaction between the barbiturates binding site and the GABA binding site, determined by pentobarbital stimulation of [3H] muscimol binding, remained unaltered. However, there was a significant increase with aging in the efficacy of the GABA-enhancement of [3H]flunitrazepam binding. On the other hand, we have also detected a significant increase in the proportion of type I benzodiazepine receptor in 24-month-old hippocampal membranes. We propose that the age-related increase in the efficacy of GABA-enhancement of [3H]flunitrazepam binding could be correlated with the increase in the proportion of type I benzodiazepine receptor. Based on these results it is tempting to speculate that the age-dependent modifications on the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor might reflect an age-dependent neuronal degeneration of the hippocampus or the hippocampal formation.\r"

It also has been demonstrated that spinal kappa opioid receptors as well as CRF receptors are involved in the antinociception induced by CRF. In the present study, the role of CRF i.t. in modulating nociception was assessed further using the mouse tail-flick test. In addition, the modulatory effect of i.t. administered CRF on the antinociceptive activity of morphine was studied. Despite its potent and long-lasting antinociceptive effect in the writhing assay, CRF injected i.t. produced no consistent antinociception in the tail-flick test at doses up to 20 times the antinociceptive ED50 of CRF in the writhing test. In contrast, i.t. injection of CRF significantly attenuated the antinociceptive action of s.c. administered morphine. CRF at doses of 0.1 and 0.2 nmol/mouse i.t. increased the antinociceptive ED50 of s.c. morphine by 2- and 4-fold, respectively. The antagonistic action of CRF peaked between 15 min and 1 hr after i.t. injection and was still observable 4 hr after injection, demonstrating a time course similar to that of the antinociceptive effect of CRF in the writhing test. Intrathecal injection of alpha-helical CRF(9-41), a competitive CRF receptor antagonist, was able to inhibit, in a dose-dependent manner, the antagonistic activity of CRF. The antagonistic action of CRF also was attenuated dose-dependently by i.t. injection of nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI), a highly selective kappa opioid receptor antagonist. However, intrathecal injection of (+)-1-nor-BNI, an inactive enantiomer of nor-BNI, did not affect the antagonistic action of CRF. These data suggest that spinal kappa opioid receptors as well as CRF receptors are involved in the antagonistic effect of CRF against morphine antinociception.\r"

However, the evaluation of D40 in the rat has been difficult due to systemic effects. We evaluated the effects of isovolumic hemodilution with D40 on the development of peripheral edema, mean arterial pressure, hematocrit (Hct) and total blood volume in 18 rats, during 30 min or 4 hr i.v. infusions, in animals with and without previous challenge with D40. Reduction of Hct without peripheral edema to a mean of approximately 31% was only achieved in the animals challenged with i.p. D40 24 hr before hemodilution and who received D40 over a period of 4 hr. Infusion of D40 over a period of 30 min was associated with shorter survival time, compared to the 4-hr infusion group (P less than .005). In the pretreated, rapidly infused group, total blood volume per body weight decreased significantly over time (P less than .005) and the mean arterial blood pressure dropped, but not significantly (P less than .07), whereas no change in Hct was detected and there was a trend toward increased peripheral edema, relative to the slowly infused groups. We conclude that reduction of Hct can be achieved successfully with i.p. administration of D40 24 hr before the study combined with infusion of the agent during a 4-hr period, without significant peripheral edema and early hypotension. This procedure should be used to avoid allergic reactions when evaluating hemodilution with D40 in rats.\r"

  ".W": "The basis of extracellular acidosis amelioration of 2-bromohydroquinone (BHQ)-induced renal proximal tubular cell death was determined by comparing the metabolism, uptake and mitochondrial effects of BHQ (0.2 mM) and bromoquinone (BQ) (0.05 mM) on isolated rabbit renal proximal tubules incubated in pH 7.4 and pH 6.4 buffers. Exposure of proximal tubules in pH 7.4 buffer to [14C]BHQ resulted in a time-dependent increase in covalently bound BHQ-equivalents to tubular protein (9 +/- 1 nmol/mg of protein at 1 hr) and a decrease in nystatin-stimulated oxygen consumption (NYS-QO2). In comparison, covalently bound BHQ-equivalents were 0.7 nmol/mg of protein and NYS-QO2 was unaffected in proximal tubules incubated at pH 6.4 for 1 hr. After a 1-hr exposure, tubular content of [14C]BHQ-equivalents was 15 +/- 2 and 9 +/- 1 nmol/mg of protein in tubules incubated at pH 7.4 and 6.4, respectively. Thus, decreased covalent binding of BHQ-equivalents in proximal tubules incubated at pH 6.4 could not be accounted for by limited uptake of BHQ. The lactate dehydrogenase release induced by 0.05 mM BQ was decreased by acidic pH. Similarly, BQ induced an 85% decrease in NYS-QO2 of proximal tubules in pH 7.4 buffer, compared to a 55% inhibition when proximal tubules were incubated at pH 6.4 for 4 hr. Thus, extracellular acidosis ameliorates BHQ toxicity by altering BHQ biotransformation; that is, extracellular acidosis inhibits the oxidation of BHQ to BQ and may promote the reduction of BQ to BHQ.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of acute administration of ethanol on t-[35S]Butylbiclophosphorothionate (35S-TBPS) binding measured ex vivo in unwashed membrane preparations of rat cerebral cortex were investigated. Ethanol, given i.g., decreased in a dose-related (0.5-4 g/kg) and time-dependent manner the binding of 35S-TBPS. This effect was similar to that induced by the administration of diazepam (0.5-4 mg/kg i.p.). Scatchard plot analysis of this radioligand binding revealed that ethanol, differently from diazepam, decreased the apparent affinity of 35S-TBPS recognition sites whereas it failed to change the density of these binding sites. The effect of ethanol on 35S-TBPS binding could not be reversed by the previous administration to rats of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, Ro 15-1788 (ethyl-8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H- imidazo[1,5a][1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate). Vice versa, the benzodiazepine receptor partial inverse agonist, Ro 15-4513 (ethyl-8-azido-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H- imidazo[1,5a][4,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate) (8 mg/kg i.p.), prevented completely ethanol-induced decrease of 35S-TBPS binding. The ability of Ro 15-4513 to prevent the action of ethanol was shared by the anxiogenic and proconvulsant beta-carboline derivatives, FG 7142 (N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide) (12.5 mg/kg i.p.) and ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (0.6 mg/kg i.v.), which, per se, enhanced this parameter. Moreover, ethanol (0.5-4 g/kg) was able to reverse the increase of 35S-TBPS binding elicited by the s.c. injection of isoniazid (350 mg/kg) and to clearly attenuate the severity of tonic-clonic seizures produced by this inhibitor of the GABAergic transmission.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Experiments are performed in tandem with rabbit skeletal SR under identical conditions to allow direct comparisons of the mechanisms by which activators and inhibitors influence the calcium release channel. Ca(++)-induced Ca++ release is demonstrated with both preparations and the cardiac channel is about 1.5-fold more sensitive to activation by Ca++, which is in excellent quantitative agreement with the ability of Ca++ to activate [3H]ryanodine-binding sites. The cardiac and skeletal receptors show major quantitative differences with respect to sensitivity to pharmacologic modulators, cations and pH. The inhibitors ruthenium red, Mg++ and neomycin are significantly more potent in inhibiting the skeletal receptor, whereas the activators daunorubicin and caffeine are significantly more potent towards the cardiac receptor. The ATP analog, beta,gamma-methyleneadenosine 5'-triphosphate, enhances the binding of [3H]ryanodine to the high-affinity site in skeletal SR by a factor of 4 but has a negligible effect on the cardiac receptor, although at suboptimal Ca++ for the binding of ryanodine, beta,gamma-methyleneadenosine 5'-triphosphate activates the cardiac receptor to a greater extent. High levels of salt (1 M NaCl) enhance the rate of [3H]ryanodine association with its binding sites in both preparations, although they selectively reduce the binding-site capacity in skeletal SR due to a failure to maintain a stable equilibrium. Although high- and low-affinity binding of [3H]ryanodine have a similar response to changing pH, the skeletal receptors are significantly more sensitive to pH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The drugs administered were ethanol, propanol, n-butanol, t-butanol, pentanol, diazepam, phenobarbital, pentobarbital, methyprylon and ethchlorvynol, all of which have sedative effects on the central nervous system, and hydralazine, a peripheral vasodilator. All drugs decreased body temperature of both HOT and COLD mice. In mice selected for seven to nine generations, COLD mice were more sensitive than HOT mice to all sedative drugs. The longer-chain alcohols were more potent than ethanol in inducing hypothermia, but the magnitude of the response difference between HOT and COLD mice appeared to be smaller. The difference between HOT and COLD mice in hypothermic sensitivity to an acute dose of ethanol was greater after 11-15 generations of selection than after seven generations. Similarly, the differential effect of the other alcohols, phenobarbital, pentobarbital, and methyprylon, on HOT and COLD mice increased with more generations of selection but to a lesser extent than ethanol. These data demonstrate that selecting for sensitivity to acute ethanol hypothermia has produced mice that are also differentially sensitive to other sedative hypnotic agents. They also support the hypothesis that the drugs used in the present study share a common mechanism of action for inducing hypothermia, which may be regulated by a common set of genes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All of the drugs tested, with the exception of SKF38393 and amphetamine, induced a hypothermic response in HOT and COLD mice. SKF38393 had no effect on body temperature or HT produced by EtOH.

The drug effect studied was the antagonism by metoprolol of terbutaline-induced hypokalemia. By using pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic modeling the pharmacodynamics of racemic metoprolol and the active S-isomer, were quantitated in EMs and PMs in terms of IC50 values, representing metoprolol plasma concentrations resulting in half-maximum receptor occupancy. Six EMs received 0.5 mg of terbutaline s.c. on two different occasions: 1) 1 hr after administration of a placebo and 2) 1 hr after 150 mg of metoprolol p.o. Five PMs were studied according to the same protocol, except for a higher terbutaline dose (0.75 mg) on day 2. Blood samples for the analysis of plasma potassium, terbutaline, metoprolol (racemic, R- and S-isomer), and alpha-hydroxymetoprolol concentrations were taken at regular time intervals, during 8 hr after metoprolol. In PMs, metoprolol increased the terbutaline area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve (+67%). Higher metoprolol/alpha-hydroxymetoprolol ratios in PMs were predictive for higher R-/S-isomer ratios of unchanged drug.

The level of tele-methylhistamine, a major metabolite of HA, was decreased dose-dependently by reserpine (1-5 mg/kg s.c.), whereas the HA level was unaffected. This effect was observed in all brain regions examined. The accumulation of tele-methylhistamine induced by pargyline (65 mg/kg i.p.), an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase, was inhibited to 19% of the control value 24 hr after the treatment with reserpine (5 mg/kg s.c.). However, the HA decrease induced by (S)-alpha-fluoromethylhistidine (50 mg/kg i.p.) a specific inhibitor of histidine decarboxylase, was not significantly affected by pretreatment with reserpine (5 mg/kg s.c.) 1 or 24 hr before. The HA increase induced by metoprine (10 mg/kg i.p.), an inhibitor of histamine-N-methyltransferase, or by L-histidine (0.5-1.5 g/kg i.p.) was inhibited markedly by pretreatment with reserpine. This effect was more marked when reserpine was administered 1 hr than 24 hr before. In addition, the L-histidine-induced increase in HA level was enhanced markedly by the simultaneous administration of metoprine in the control mice but not in the mice treated with reserpine 1 hr before L-histidine injection. From these results the following are suggested. 1) There may be both of reserpine-resistant and reserpine-sensitive HA pools in histaminergic nerve endings. 2) Most of the neuronal HA in the brain may be located in the former pool. 3) However, the capacity of the former pool may be limited and thus most of the increased HA by L-histidine and metoprine may be transferred into the latter pool.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The response could not be elicited by CGS 12066B [7-trifluormethyl-4-(4-methyl-l-piperazonyl)-pyrrolol- [1-2-a] quinoxaline dimaleate], mCPP 1-(3-chlorophenyl)-piperazine-2-HCl, TFMPPm-trifluromethylphenylpiperazine HCl, MK 212 [6-chloro-2-(l-piperzinyl)pyrazine], quipazine and DOI (+-)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl-2-aminopropane HCl, which act in vivo as agonists at 5-HT1B, 5-HT1C and/or 5-HT2 receptors, or by the 5-HT3 agonist, 2-methyl-5-HT. p-chloroamphetamine, which releases endogenous 5-HT, also evoked STFs; in contrast, d-amphetamine, a preferential releaser of catecholamines, was inactive, as were agonists and antagonists at alpha-1, alpha-2, beta-1, beta-2, dopamine D1 and D2 sites. 8-OH-DPAT-elicited STFs were blocked by the 5-HT1/2 antagonist, methiothepin, but not by the 5-HT1C/5-HT2 antagonists, mianserin, ritanserin and ICI 169,369 [2-(2-dimethylaminoetheylthio)-3-phenylquinoline] nor by the 5-HT3 antagonists, GR 38032F [(1,2,3,9-tetrahydro-9-methyl-3-[(2-methyl-1H-imidazol-l-yl)methyl]-4H- carbazol-4-one HCl], ICS 205,930 [(3 alpha-tropanyl)-1H-indol-3-carboxylic acid ester] and MDL 72222 [(1 alpha H, 3 alpha, 5 alpha H)-tripan-3-yl-3,5- dichlorobenzoate]. beta-Blockers with 5-HT1A affinity i.e., (-)-alprenolol, (+/-)-isamoltane and, stereoselectivity, (-)-but not (+)-pindolol, blocked the action of 8-OH-DPAT. Spiperone and spiroxatrine, D2 antagonists with high 5-HT1A affinity, also inhibited 8-OH-DPAT-induced STFs. Selective beta-blockers and D2 antagonists with low 5-HT1A affinity were inactive. 5-HT1A partial agonists, the pyrimidinylpiperazines, buspirone, gepirone and ipsapirone, the halogenated phenylpiperazine, LY 165,163 [1-(2-(4-aminophenyl) ethyl-4-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-piperazine], and the benzodioxane, MDL 72832 [8-(4-(1,4-benzodioxan-2-yl-methylamino)-butyl-8-azaspiro-(4 ,5)-decane- 7,9-dione] did not elicit STFs and antagonized the effect of 8-OH-DPAT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study examined the influence of s.c. administration of 5-hydroxytryptamine (HT)1A agonists upon the antinociceptive action of s.c. injected morphine in tail-flick tests to noxious heat and pressure. The selective 5-HT1A agonist, (+-)-8-hydroxy-diprolaminotetralin HBr (8-OH-DPAT), dose-dependently antagonized morphine-induced antinociception (MIA) without affecting the latency to respond when applied alone. In the presence of increasing doses of 8-OH-DPAT (0.16-0.63 mg/kg), the morphine dose-response curve was shifted progressively in parallel to the right and the maximal effect of morphine was not altered; Schild analysis yielded a slope of close to -1.0. 8-OH-DPAT both prevented and reversed the action of morphine. The action of 8-OH-DPAT was reversible (at 24 hr). In distinction, 8-OH-DPAT neither blocked morphine-induced Straub tail nor precipitated withdrawal in morphine-dependent animals; thus, it lacked opioid-antagonist properties. The antagonism of MIA by 8-OH-DPAT was mimicked by additional drugs acting as high efficacy 5-HT1A agonists: lisuride, 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine hydrogen oxalate, RU 24969 [methoxy-3-(1,2,3.6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl)-1H-indole] and d-lysergic acid diethylamide. In contrast, the 5-HT1B/1C agonist, TFMPP m-trifluromethylphenylpiperazine HCl, and the 5-HT1C/2 agonist, DOI (+-)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl-2-aminopropane HCI, were ineffective. The putative selective 5-HT1A antagonists, BMY 7378 [(8-[-[4-(2-,ethoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-8-azaspirol[4]- decane-7,9-dione-2-HCL] and spiperone, did not reduce MIA. Indeed, BMY 7378 blocked the ability of 8-OH-DPAT to antagonize MIA. Under the present conditions, agonists and antagonists at adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors did not attenuate MIA. These data show that, over a certain range of doses, the systemic administration of 8-OH-DPAT and other high efficacy 5-HT1A agonists functionally antagonizes the antinociceptive action of systemically applied morphine in a competitive-like manner. It is suggested that 5-HT1A receptors play an important role in the modulation of opioidergic antinociceptive mechanisms.\r"

The pyrimidinylpiperazines, buspirone, ipsapirone and gepirone, the halogenated phenylpiperazine, LY 165, 163 [1-(2-(4-aminophenyl)ethyl-4-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-piperazine], the heterobicylic arylpiperazine, (+/-)-flexinoxan, and the benzodiaxane, MDL 728328-[(4-(1,4-benzodioxon-2-ylmethylamino)butyl-8-azasp iro-(4,5)-decane-7,9-dione], exerted little or no effect upon basal latencies. In both mice and rats, each dose-dependently attenuated the antinociceptive action of the mu-opioid, morphine, against heat and pressure. In their presence, the morphine dose-response curve was shifted in parallel to the right with no loss of maximal effect. In mice, Schild analysis of the action of ipsapirone and gepirone yielded slopes of close to -1. In contrast to the partial agonists, the buspirone metabolite, 1-pyrimidinylpiperazine, which lacks 5-HT1A affinity, and the putative 5-HT1A antagonists, methiothepin, spiperone, BMY 7378 [(8-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-8-azaspirol [4]-decane-7,9-dione) 2HCl] and alprenolol, did not reduce the action of morphine. In rats, the antagonistic effect of buspirone, gepirone and ipsapirone could be blocked by BMY 7378.

To investigate possible mechanisms of natural ras resistance, we compared the expression patterns of several genes thought to be involved in ras-induced metastatic progression in LTA (ras-resistant) and NIH 3T3 (ras-sensitive) cells, before and after constitutive expression of transfected T24-H-ras. We examined the expression of the nuclear \"early-response\" genes jun and fos and the \"tumor-suppressor\" retinoblastoma (Rb) gene, as well as genes involved in invasion (major excreted protein [MEP], tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases [TIMP]), and cell adhesion (secreted phosphoprotein 1 [SPP1; also known as osteopontin]). We found distinct differences in both the basal and ras-induced levels of expression of most of these genes in LTA versus NIH 3T3 cells. High levels of MEP and low levels of TIMP were induced in ras-transfected NIH 3T3 cells, whereas LTA cells showed intermediate levels of MEP and high levels of TIMP that were only marginally affected by the expression of transfected ras. Similarly, SPP1 expression was strongly induced by ras in NIH 3T3 cells but was repressed by ras in LTA cells. Enzymogram assays for functional gelatinase activity showed an increase in 67-kd and 62-kd bands in NIH 3T3 cells in the presence of ras. LTA cells showed no gelatinolytic activity in the presence or absence of ras. Data from an in vitro assay for chemoinvasiveness showed a pattern as predicted from the expression of invasion-related genes; chemoinvasiveness in ras-transfected NIH 3T3 was greater than in LTA and ras-transfected LTA cells, which was greater than in NIH 3T3 cells. Differences in expression of the genes examined are believed to contribute to the ras responsiveness of NIH 3T3 cells and the ras resistance of LTA cells.\r"

  ".W": "A sustained release of tamoxifen, which produced decreasing serum levels of this drug (24 to 4 ng/mL) over 6 months, suppressed mammary tumorigenesis in virgin or once pregnant C3H/OUJ female mice. Tamoxifen was consistently more effective than early ovariectomy, which only delayed tumorigenesis. Tamoxifen prevented the stimulatory action of cyclical (alternate-month) progesterone administration on mouse mammary tumorigenesis. However, when tamoxifen treatment (12 months) was stopped, progesterone treatment initiated tumorigenesis. In contrast, when long-term tamoxifen treatment was stopped in mice that had not undergone ovariectomy, and estrous cycle returned, the majority of these mice remained tumor free. A comparison of different durations (3, 6, and 12 months) of tamoxifen treatment of virgin mice, starting at approximately 4 months of age, showed an equivalent effect on mammary tumorigenesis. All virgin mice developed tumors by 18 months of age, whereas 80% of the tamoxifen-treated mice were tumor free. Nevertheless, cyclical progesterone administration caused rapid development of tumors after 3 months of tamoxifen treatment; only 15% of these mice were tumor free at 18 months. Cyclical progesterone administration caused an increase in tumorigenesis after 6 months of tamoxifen treatment; 50% of these mice were tumor free at 18 months of age. These data demonstrate the efficacy of tamoxifen to suppress mouse mammary tumorigenesis and demonstrate that continuous tamoxifen therapy is necessary to prevent the development of tumors by progesterone, a stimulatory hormone.\r"

  ".W": "A test of the anticancer effects of dietary fiber was conducted using the N-nitrosomethylurea (NMU)-induced rat mammary tumor model. Starting 3 days after NMU treatment, four different groups of F344 rats (30 rats in each group) were fed as follows: Group 1 received a high-fat diet; group 2, a high-fat plus fiber diet (soft white wheat bran, 10% wt/wt); group 3, a low-fat diet; and group 4, a low-fat plus fiber diet. The rats remained on these diets for 15 weeks. Tumor incidence in group 1 was 90% compared with 66% in group 2 (P less than .001). Tumor incidence in group 3 was 63% compared with 47% in group 4 (P greater than .4). These results show that supplemental dietary fiber exerts an inhibitory effect on the promotional phase of NMU-induced mammary carcinogenesis in rats when fed a high-fat but not a low-fat diet. To test whether fiber may exert its antipromoting effect by reducing circulating estrogens, serum 17 beta-estradiol was assayed. No changes were observed in serum 17 beta-estradiol levels among the four groups, suggesting that the protective effect of fiber in this animal model is not mediated by a fiber-induced reduction of circulating 17 beta-estradiol.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective cohort study of the incidence of bladder cancer was conducted in response to a union request for an evaluation of a possible excess number of cases of bladder cancer at a chemical plant in western New York State. Workers at the plant were exposed to two potential bladder carcinogens--ortho-toluidine (o-toluidine) and aniline. Incidence rates of bladder cancer among workers at the plant were compared with those of the population of New York State (excluding New York City). Among all 1749 workers at the plant, 13 cases of bladder cancer were observed versus 3.61 expected [standardized incidence ratio (SIR) = 3.60; 90% confidence interval (CI) = 2.13-5.73]. Among the 708 workers who worked in areas in which o-toluidine and aniline were used, 7 cases were observed versus 1.08 expected (SIR = 6.48; 90% CI = 3.04-12.2). Among the 288 maintenance, shipping, and janitorial workers thought to have been possibly exposed, 4 cases were observed versus 1.09 expected (SIR = 3.66; 90% CI = 1.25-8.37). Among the remaining 753 workers who were probably not exposed, 2 bladder cancers were observed versus 1.43 expected (SIR = 1.39; 90% CI = 0.25-4.39). Increased risk of bladder cancer was strongly associated with increased duration of employment in the department where o-toluidine and aniline were used (P less than .001). Among workers with 10 or more years of employment in the department, the SIR was 27.2 (90% CI = 11.8-53.7). o-Toluidine is an animal carcinogen more potent than aniline and is known to produce bladder tumors in rats; hence, it is more likely that o-toluidine is responsible for the observed excess number of cases of bladder cancer, although aniline may have played a role.\r"

  ".W": "Findings from previous studies suggest that differences in socioeconomic status may be responsible for some, if not all, of the elevated incidence of cancer among blacks as compared with whites. Using incidence data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, we tested this hypothesis by correlating black and white cancer incidence rates in three US metropolitan areas between 1978 and 1982 with data from the 1980 census on socioeconomic status within individual census tracts. The study analyzed data on the incidence of cancer at all sites combined (greater than 100 cancer sites) and at seven major sites separately. As in other studies, income and educational levels served as surrogates for socioeconomic status. The present study also used census-tract data on population density as a surrogate factor. Each of these measures of socioeconomic status was analyzed independently. Before correlation with census-tract data, age-adjusted data on cancer incidence showed statistically significant elevated risks among blacks for cancer at all sites combined and at four of the seven separate sites; whites showed an elevated risk for cancer at two sites. Cancer at only one site, the colon, showed no significant association with race. When age-adjusted incidence data were correlated with socioeconomic status, the comparative black-white risks changed: Whites showed an elevated risk of cancer at all sites combined and at three of the seven separate sites; blacks maintained their elevated risk at three sites. These findings suggest that the disproportionate distribution of blacks at lower socioeconomic levels accounts for much of the excess cancer burden among blacks. They also suggest that for both blacks and whites unidentified racial factors, which may be either cultural or genetic and which are not closely linked to socioeconomic status, may play a role in the incidence of some cancers.\r"

  ".W": "Resistance to the nitrogen mustards in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) correlates with an enhanced removal of melphalan-induced DNA interstrand cross-links. This finding suggests that DNA repair enzymes may be involved in this process. The activity of 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase, which can release altered bases, including adducts at the N-7 position of guanine, was increased significantly in lymphocytes from patients with resistant CLL compared with those from untreated CLL patients. Since glycosylase activity varies with cell proliferation, the amount of [3H]thymidine incorporated into DNA was determined and found to be elevated almost threefold in lymphocytes from patients with resistant CLL. The ratio of glycosylase activity to level of thymidine incorporation did not differ between these two groups of patients. Northern blot analysis of ERCC1 gene (a putative DNA repair enzyme involved in nucleotide excision repair) expression in lymphocytes from patients with CLL revealed multiple gene transcripts (1.1, 3.4, and 3.8 kilobases). In addition, analysis of two samples revealed the presence of a 2.6-kilobase transcript. The 2.6-kilobase transcript was recognized by specific RNA probes that hybridize to antisense ERCC1 transcripts. Levels of expression of the 1.1-kilobase protein encoding transcript in lymphocytes from patients with resistant CLL were increased twofold to threefold above those of untreated patients with CLL. These results indicate that increased expression of ERCC1 and increased activity of 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase occur with the development of resistance to the nitrogen mustards in patients with CLL, suggesting a role for enhanced DNA repair in this process.\r"

Human KB carcinoma cell lines expressing different amounts of P-glycoprotein have been selected by use of the monoclonal antibody MRK-16 coupled to magnetic particles. This specific, rapid, and sensitive method allows the selection of viable and clonable drug-resistant cells from various drug-resistant human and murine cell populations. This method may prove useful in isolating drug-resistant cells from tumors with heterogeneous P-glycoprotein expression for further analysis.\r"
