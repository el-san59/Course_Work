None of 21 patients who were treated with aminocaproic acid rebled, while three (23%) of 13 patients who were treated with placebo rebled. This difference was statistically significant. Of the three patients who rebled, two required surgical intervention, with one patient requiring four surgical procedures. Although complications following aminocaproic acid therapy included light-headedness, nausea and vomiting, and systemic hypotension, only one patient was withdrawn from the study because of drug-related adverse reactions. This study strongly confirms that aminocaproic acid therapy significantly reduces the incidence of secondary hemorrhage following traumatic hyphema.\r"

The incidence of epiretinal membranes, seen in the eyes of patients with hemoglobin SC, SS, and SB+ thalassemia, was 3.7%. Most epiretinal membranes were mild, and visual acuity was 20/40 or better in 78.2% of these eyes. Severe macular pucker was occasionally noted following retinal detachment surgery. One patient with SC disease developed a macular epiretinal membrane that led to a macular hole and eventually to macular and extra-macular retinal detachment. Epiretinal membranes are a relatively common cause of maculopathy in patients with sickle cell disease.\r"

This last ratio provided the highest single correlation with visual acuity; next highest were patient age and FAZ grading. Multivariate regression confirmed that these three variables together best predicted visual acuity. Lesser correlations with acuity were obtained with angiographic leakage and fundus photography grading. Cross-correlations among all gradings showed that indicators of breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier, ie, fluorophotometry, angiographic leakage, and retinal thickening, were significantly correlated with each other, whereas FAZ grading was independent of all these factors and correlated only with acuity. By performing vitreous fluorophotometry and fluorescein angiography, it is possible to quantitate two major components of diabetic maculopathy: breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier and macular ischemia, both of which are highly correlated with visual acuity.\r"

Improvements in computer algorithms used to analyze the raw data obtained from the keratoscope photographs have also been made, resulting in increased accuracy. This system allows the ophthalmologist to see the patterns of power distribution on the corneal surface more easily than is possible by visual inspection of keratoscope photographs. Improved corneal topography analysis should find wide clinical application in the study of refractive corneal surgery techniques and in the study of corneal disorders that cause irregular astigmatism.\r"

The laser lesions showed full-thickness involvement as well. These observations emphasize the need for caution with thermal treatment modalities in the air-filled eye. Ophthalmoscopic examination 48 hours following vitrectomy, internal drainage of subretinal fluid, and gas fill of the vitreous cavity for diabetic macular detachment of several months' duration showed the retina to be attached. However, histopathologic examination revealed a thin layer of persistent subretinal fluid, demonstrating that it may take longer than is clinically apparent for true retinal reattachment to occur following gas tamponade of posterior retinal breaks. Prolonged gas tamponade may be necessary before retinal reattachment, with reestablishment of photoreceptor-pigment epithelial adherence, can be expected to help seal unrecognized or untreated posterior retinal breaks.\r"

Both groups of laser lesions showed a similar degree of damage and occlusion in the lamina choriocapillaris and deeper choroidal vessels. The 14-day-old posterior laser lesions showed outer retinal damage, whereas the five-day-old peripheral lesions showed full-thickness retinal involvement, probably because the peripheral retina is approximately half the thickness of the posterior retina.

Bolus administration into the cerebral ventricles or ventriculocisternal perfusion of delta 9-THC did not change IOP or pupil size. In urethane-anesthetized rabbits, IOP and blood pressure were lowered by intravenous administration of delta 9-THC but not by bolus cerebral administration. These observations indicate that the action of cannabinoids on IOP does not originate in the central nervous system. Alteration of blood pressure may be involved in the mechanism of ocular hypotension induced by delta 9-THC.\r"

The IOP was measured with a calibrated pneumatonometer at the same hourly intervals on treatment days as on the baseline days. The IOP at each time of day on treatment days was compared with the average baseline IOP measured at the corresponding time of day.

The sulfur hexafluoride bubble produced corneal edema for as long as the gas was present. With perfluoropropane, corneal edema persisted even after the gas bubble disappeared. In another group of cats, multiple sequential injections of sulfur hexafluoride to maintain a gas bubble of duration comparable with the perfluoropropane bubble also produced edema as long as gas was present. Clinical corneal edema, endothelial fibrin deposition, endothelial opacities, and retrocorneal membrane were observed by slit-lamp and light, scanning, and transmission electron microscopic examinations of the corneas exposed to perfluoropropane but not of those exposed to sulfur hexafluoride. Prolonged corneal endothelial contact by perfluoropropane results in corneal edema due to endothelial dysfunction, which persists in cats probably because feline endothelium is less capable of regeneration than that of rabbit.\r"

Animals were then divided into three groups: group 1 (controls) (ten rabbits [20 eyes]) received no treatment; group 2 (ten rabbits [20 eyes]) received 10 mg/kg/d of tetracycline hydrochloride, given intramuscularly; and group 3 (11 rabbits [22 eyes]) received 50 mg/kg/d. Ulceration occurred in 85% (17/20) of control eyes. The higher dosage of tetracycline was more effective in preventing ulceration than the lower dosage (9.1% vs 55%). Eyes with higher levels of tetracycline in ocular tissues were less likely to ulcerate.\r"

Plasma and aqueous humor samples were assayed for drug content and antifibrinolytic activity. Peak aqueous humor concentrations of aminocaproic acid ranged from 2.5 to 33 mg/dL and varied according to the systemic dose administered. The antifibrinolytic activity paralleled the aminocaproic acid content, with a peak range from 310 to 683 s. These findings indicate a direct relationship between antifibrinolytic activity and the concentration of aminocaproic acid in aqueous humor.\r"

Clinical and laboratory measures of rheumatoid disease activity also were recorded for each patient. Rheumatology fellows viewed 20 randomly chosen video recordings of the patients and made global estimates of the intensity and unpleasantness of pain. Significant positive correlations were found between total pain behavior scores and measures of disease activity. The fellows' estimates of the intensity and unpleasantness of the patients' pain also were significantly and positively correlated with the total pain behavior scores. The behavioral observation method may be useful in the assessment of RA pain and may be included as an objective outcome measure in clinical trials with RA patients.\r"

Together with protein concentrations, these determinations allowed us to calculate: the flux of each marker protein through synovial tissues (mg/minute); the volume of plasma cleared by synovium per unit time (ml/minute); and the fractional extraction per passage through the synovial microcirculation (protein permeance). These measures differed substantially between rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis patient populations and quantified the severity of the microvascular lesion in rheumatoid synovitis.\r"

Large numbers of Mac-1 (Mas 034)-positive, macrophage-like cells were seen both within the thickened synovial lining layer and in the deeper layers of the synovial tissue in all stages of arthritis. Ia-expressing cells were scarce in the lining layer, but occurred in moderate numbers in the deeper layers of synovial tissue.

  ".W": "The Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is a rare neurological disorder which strikes primarily alcoholics and is caused, at least in part, by insufficient bioavailability of thiamin. Because of the low cost of preventing this disease by adding thiamin to alcoholic beverages relative to the cost of the long-term care of patients with the chronic phase of the disease, there has been a need to determine the feasibility of this particular preventive strategy. Recent data demonstrating normal levels of erythrocyte transketolase in patients presenting with Wernicke's encephalopathy has led some to question the link between thiamin deficiency, and the development of the syndrome, despite the fact that virtually all patients with Wernicke's encephalopathy will respond favorably to parenteral thiamin, and the evidence that rats deprived of thiamin develop lesions that are characteristic of the disease. Thiamin is nontoxic, is stable in alcoholic beverages, and is undetectable in beer to professional taste-testers at levels theoretically sufficient to guarantee adequate absorption. Although there is much inter-subject variability it appears that thiamin at therapeutic concentrations can be absorbed by the jejunum in the presence of alcohol. Evidence that patients with the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome have an altered thiamin-requiring isoenzyme and evidence that six patients with Wernicke's encephalopathy failed to respond to oral thiamin has caused some doubt as to whether the target population would be able to benefit from the measure. Other determinants of thiamin utilization, such as folate and magnesium status, also may figure in the etiology of the disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

When affecting the developing myocyte, damage is responsible for the hypotonicity and congestive heart failure of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) infants. To test the hypothesis that ethanol damages myocytes in utero, and determine that damage is not affected by dietary protein manipulations, female Sprague-Dawley rats were fed Leiber-DeCarli diets containing either 10% or 25% protein-derived calories, isocalorically balanced with or without 36% of the total calories containing ethanol. Muscle biopsies from rat pups of the ethanol-fed groups showed disorganized myocyte cytoskeleton: sarcomeric dysplasia with Z-band abnormality, actin in disarray, and granulofilamentous debris. Teratogenic effects of ethanol on myocytes occur in rat pups in utero, supporting the use of this model for studying ethanol effects on the developing cytoskeleton. We report ultrastructural evidence which provides a partial explanation of the mechanism of a well-known clinical phenomenon.\r"

Since this diet was considered to be nutritionally adequate, a concept developed that the observed effects were due to the toxicity of alcohol and its metabolites rather than malnutrition. However, several biologic effects can be attributed to a reduced carbohydrate ingestion that accompanies chronic alcohol consumption.\r"

  ".W": "Examination of the compliance patterns of 84 patients offered supervised disulfiram in aqueous suspension, and for whom adequate supervision by family members, friends or colleagues was possible, showed that 38 took disulfiram regularly and remained abstinent throughout the minimum six-month period for which it was prescribed. Twenty risked drinking alcohol while taking disulfiram, half of whom did not experience a significant reaction on doses of 200-300 mg daily. In nine patients there was a temporary lapse of supervision. Two patients induced vomiting of disulfiram. Four substituted inert medication. Nine dropped out of treatment--usually after separating from their partner--and two refused to start disulfiram. Apart from these 11 patients, attempts to sabotage or evade treatment were not necessarily associated with a poor response. In most cases it was possible to out-manoeuvre the patients by increasing the dosage or modifying the supervision techniques. Awareness of these possible patient responses is essential if the considerable potential of supervised disulfiram is to be maximised.\r"

The paper explores information which was part of a larger study of alcohol use by violent and non-violent offenders. Data were collected by interview from the offenders and correlated with other reports. Earlier findings of the study which have been reported suggested that level of consumption was associated with the type of offence. In this paper a more complex drinking/drinking context and crime relationship is shown to exist. The circumstances at the time of the crime were related more to the level of alcohol consumption than to the violent or non-violent nature of the crime. Type of beverage, companionship and time of day were found to be particularly good indicators of the amount of alcohol consumed.\r"

They showed significant increments of mean systemic arterial, left atrial, and pulmonary arterial pressures; of systemic vascular resistance, heart rate, and pulmonary artery blood flow; and a reduction in aortic blood flow during the induction of brain death. As a result of increased sympathetic nervous system activity, areas of myocardial cell necrosis occurred in 73% of the animals and pulmonary edema in 36%. Group B consisted of five animals that were pretreated with verapamil hydrochloride infused over a period of 30 minutes prior to the induction of brain death (mean dosage, 0.26 mg/kg). Except for a rise in heart rate, no significant changes occurred in systemic or pulmonary hemodynamics, and no myocardial or pulmonary histopathological changes were seen. These findings would indicate that verapamil hydrochloride prevents both the peripheral and central hemodynamic changes that result from increased sympathetic activity associated with the induction of brain death, and thus prevents myocardial structural damage, which may be associated with increased calcium uptake by the myocyte.\r"

  ".W": "Recent evidence suggests that ultimate neurologic injury following cardiac arrest and resuscitation may be largely determined by biochemical events occurring during reperfusion. To test this hypothesis and further characterize the time course of some of these events, we examined tissue samples from the parietal cortex for their total content of calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), sodium (Na), and potassium (K) after 10 minutes, two hours, four hours, and eight hours of reperfusion following a 15-minute cardiac arrest in dogs. After 10 minutes of reperfusion, there were relatively small, but significant, increases in the total tissue content of Ca and Na, as compared to nonischemic controls. All values had returned to normal at two hours and remained normal at four hours of reperfusion. However, at eight hours of reperfusion, Ca and Na content approximately doubled and K content was reduced by half. There were no significant changes at any time in the tissue content of Fe or Mg. We conclude that with between four and eight hours of reperfusion following a 15-minute cardiac arrest, a major defect occurs in many cells of the cortex with respect to their ability to control ionic balances of Ca, Na, and K. This might be explained either by failure of the energy-dependent ionic pumps or by more generalized damage to the membrane permeability barrier by a process such as lipid peroxidation.\r"

The ability of the CPS to supply the oxygen transfer needs of five anesthetized dogs consistently over six hours and the system's effects on hemoglobin concentration, platelet count, and degree of hemolysis were assessed. The animals maintained spontaneous heart beats, pump flows averaged 100 ml/kg/min; mean arterial pressures were maintained at from 114 to 144 mm Hg. Immediate dilution of hemoglobin and platelet levels occurred in the first 30 minutes. Further hemodilution was limited during the first two hours, although three of the animals required transfusions during the six-hour period to maintain their hematocrits. Plasma free hemoglobin did not significantly increase during the six hours. Baseline oxygen consumption data obtained in three animals ranged from 44.5 to 96 (ml oxygen/min/m2). Oxygen and carbon dioxide transfer measurements during the first hour of bypass were not significantly different from measurements during the last hour of perfusion. The study suggests that optimal use of the CPS could supply much if not all of a patient's basal oxygen transfer requirements for at least six hours.\r"

The authors evaluated 100 transfers to their emergency department as to the adequacy of stabilization prior to transport. Problems were identified in the areas of communication (nine cases), oxygenation (two cases), cardiac monitoring (one case), intravenous lines (eight cases), airway (two cases), ventilation (one case), equipment and personnel accompanying the patient (one case), bladder catheterization (four cases), nasogastric suctioning (one case), radiographs (nine cases), and spinal immobilization (seven cases). Because more than one error occurred in some patients, the total number of patients having problems with stabilization was 28. The authors also compared the reimbursement status of transferred patients with that of the region's and emergency department's patient populations. No evidence was found that financially undesirable patients were being preferentially transferred. Thus, even when transfers are not made because of unfavorable reimbursement status, many errors in stabilization occur. A review of the literature shows that inadequacies in stabilization for transfer are widespread. This may be improved through physician education, use of transport teams, and judicious use of interhospital transport. The indications and responsibilities of transfer are discussed.\r"

Cephalometric abnormalities were detected in 18 (67%) of the 27 subjects so analyzed, with five (18%) meeting multiple roentgenographic criteria for abnormality. Frontal and lateral cephalometric abnormalities were found in nearly equal percentages among condylar-only, condylar-body, and noncondylar fracture groups, but abnormalities were most severe in association with the condylar injuries. The single best screening tool for facial abnormality was clinical examination. Frontal cephalometric roentgenograms correlated with clinical findings better than lateral cephalometric roentgenograms. However, roentgenograms alone had a 35% false-positive incidence of abnormality when correlated with the clinical-dental examination. Abnormalities of occlusion and dentition were seen in ten (36%) of the 28 subjects. Pterygoid muscle exercises following prolonged intermittent, nocturnal, intermaxillary fixation are discussed as a possible means to reduce the incidence of these abnormalities as the child matures.\r"

However, three distinct myocutaneous segments, the superior, the lateral island, and the extended island flaps, can be harvested from the trapezius muscle and its overlying skin. Fifty-five patients underwent reconstruction for head and neck defects using 56 trapezius myocutaneous flaps consisting of 28 superior, 24 lateral island, and four extended island flaps. The four vascular supplies of the trapezius muscle are discussed, with emphasis on the variable nature of the transverse cervical and dorsal scapular arteries. Major complications developed in two of 28 superior, five of 24 lateral island, and one of four extended island flaps. The superior flap, although the most dependable, has the most limited range of application. Both the lateral and extended island flaps have a broader range of clinical application, but their usefulness may be limited by previous neck surgery or occult neoplasm in the neck, as well as by the variable vascular supply. Due to the above limitations, 30% of our attempts to utilize the lateral island flap had to be aborted at the time of surgery and an alternate means of reconstruction used. The trapezius myocutaneous flaps are excellent reconstructive tools for selected defects.\r"

Tensile strength measurements and histologic evaluations were made at frequent intervals up to nine weeks after incision. Histologic studies showed no differences in the two groups at any time in the study. Tensile strength of wounds was significantly less two weeks after incision in the Shaw scalpel group, but following that time, the wounds increased in strength, and by seven weeks, the two groups were equal in this respect. Thus, we conclude that the Shaw scalpel wounds in pigs are, ultimately, similar to standard scalpel wounds, although there is a period of diminished tensile strength.\r"

It is characterized by the development of cutaneous malignancies in childhood and by death from the local or systemic complications thereof by the third decade of life. The head and the neck are the most frequently affected areas. Management involves sunlight avoidance and prompt biopsy of any new skin lesion. Due to the chronic nature of the disease, it is necessary to excise the least amount of tissue consistent with tumor removal in order to preserve skin for future procedures. In some patients, radiation therapy and/or certain chemotherapeutic agents are abnormally cytotoxic and must be utilized with caution.\r"

However, new laser-related hazards have been encountered, the most serious of which is fire in the airway. Venturi jet ventilation removes that risk and provides an unobstructed surgical field. Indications and techniques for the use of jet ventilation with carbon dioxide laser surgery remain controversial, particularly whether jet ventilation should be used in papillomatosis or in the severely obstructed airway, and whether proximal and distal catheter techniques are equally safe and effective. We report the successful use of proximal large-bore Venturi jet ventilation in 327 consecutive patients undergoing microlaryngeal laser surgery. The technique is ideal for pediatric patients with subglottic stenosis or recurrent respiratory papillomas and has not caused distal seeding in the latter group. We recommend the use of low-pressure ventilation, even in relatively obstructed airways. The experimental evidence reported here corroborates the clinical viewpoint expressed; the technique is safe, simple, and uncomplicated if used with care.\r"

A total of 120 g of ceforanide was administered over a period of two months. All three patients showed signs of clinical improvement, but only two of three became bacteriologically sterile at the end of two months; one patient relapsed bacteriologically but not clinically, once the drug was discontinued. Second- and third-generation cephalosporins appear to have excellent activity against the causative pathogens of rhinoscleroma. Because of the impracticality of administering these agents parenterally over prolonged periods of time, there is a need for the development of an oral cephalosporin with similar intrinsic activity and beta-lactamase stability. Perhaps the novel beta-lactam antibiotics such as the penems and monobactams, some of which can be administered orally, will answer that need.\r"

At the first follow-up examination, varying degrees of attic retractions were found in 37% of ears and, at the second follow-up examination, in 27% of ears. This general improvement was mainly due to normalization of the slight retractions, whereas the frequency of severe retractions increased. Pathology of the pars tensa of the membranae tympani was found in 57% of ears at the first examination and comprised the following: tympanosclerosis (19%), tympanosclerosis and atrophy (10%), atrophy (22%), atrophy and pexi (3%), and adhesive otitis (3%).

Groups were categorized according to otolaryngologic examination results and pressure-flow measurements. The results clearly demonstrate that size of the airway influences airflow rate when the smallest nasal cross-sectional area is under 0.4 cm2. The data suggest that the nose becomes flow-limiting when it is less than 0.18 cm2. These data support our contention that nasal airway impairment in adults occurs when the airway is less than 0.4 cm2 in size.\r"

  ".W": "Deep, midline cervical cysts clinically diagnosed as thyroglossal duct cysts (TDCs), have been pathologically classified as dermoid cysts because of the presence of skin appendages and a squamous epithelial lining. In 75 midline cervical masses preoperatively diagnosed as TDC, we could classify only 54 as TDC, using the preexisting criteria of squamous or ciliated columnar epithelial lining associated with a tract or thyroid follicles. Eleven cysts were reclassified as dermoid, and six were called \"mixed\" because of features of both dermoid cysts (skin appendages) and TDC (epithelial tract or thyroid follicles). The morphological similarity of all these lesions suggests a common origin, perhaps from totipotential tissue entrapped during the descent of the embryonic thyroglossal duct from the base of the tongue. We conclude that these lesions should be grouped together under the eponym of \"thyroglossal anomalies,\" and that treatment for all should consist of the Sistrunk procedure.\r"

This tumor is generally described as benign with a predilection for middle-aged women. Herein we report the case of an 11-month-old female infant with this condition. The extensiveness of the tumor with intracranial involvement at presentation suggests that the lesion might have been present for some time and raises the question of it being congenital in origin.

Treatment has ranged from analgesia and antibiotics to hyperbaric oxygen treatments to local or extensive sequestrectomies with partial or total mandibulectomy and restoration of tissue losses with unirradiated tissue. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the successful use of a free greater omental flap for immediate treatment of mandibular osteoradionecrosis and concomitant reconstruction. We found the omentum to be an excellent vascular bed that rapidly resolved the osteoradionecrosis and pain, promoted healing, and restored mandibular function with minimal discomfort to the patient.\r"

All patients had normal QRS complexes and T waves in the electrocardiogram before pacing and required atrial stimulation and His bundle recording for diagnostic purposes. Patients were randomised into a study group or a control group. In the eight patients in the study group right ventricular pacing was performed for 12 hours, and was followed by inversion of the T wave in surface leads II, III, aVF, and V2-V5 and lengthening of the QTc interval. The frequency and complexity of ventricular arrhythmias increased after pacing in six patients who had ventricular extrasystoles in the baseline Holter recording. As the configuration of the T wave became normal the frequency of ventricular extrasystoles returned to baseline values. In the control group of eight patients ventricular pacing was not performed after the electrophysiological study and no changes were seen in T wave configuration and in the frequency of spontaneous arrhythmias. These results suggest that the post-pacing repolarisation abnormalities reflect abnormal electrical properties of the ventricle and that in some cases they lead to increased electrical instability.\r"

  ".W": "An evaluation of factors which may influence survival and mode of death was conducted over a three year period in a consecutive series of 50 patients with severe chronic ischaemic cardiac failure for more than three months. At the initial assessment all patients were already receiving intensive medical treatment. During follow up four patients successfully underwent cardiac surgery and medical treatment was modified in most patients, with four patients receiving antiarrhythmic drugs. Twenty six patients died: 17 suddenly within one hour of onset of symptoms and nine of progressive cardiac failure. The mortality by one year was 26% and by two years it was 62%. Comparison of those who survived with those who died within one year of follow up showed that a very low left ventricular ejection fraction, severe ventricular arrhythmias, the presence of gallop rhythm, and New York Heart Association class IV were the variables that predicted mortality. By two years left ventricular ejection fraction, ventricular arrhythmias, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure were the variables that were significantly different in survivors and patients who died. No differences were found in any of the recorded variables between those who died suddenly and those who did not. Thus in patients with chronic ischaemic cardiac failure determination of the left ventricular ejection fraction and the severity of ventricular arrhythmia on the ambulatory electrocardiogram are the best ways to predict prognosis. The presence of gallop rhythm and New York Heart Association class IV status predict early death.\r"

The ability of a symptom limited exercise test to predict the presence of triple vessel disease was assessed in 221 patients three weeks after infarction. Coronary angiography was performed in patients with exercise induced ST segment depression. The presence of ST segment depression alone was poorly indicative of triple vessel disease; however, some specific features of ST segment changes on exercise were of predictive value. Downsloping ST segment configuration alone or horizontal ST segment depression associated with an early onset and a late recovery time after exercise correctly identified 30 (90%) of 33 patients with triple vessel disease whereas it incorrectly identified only 6 (15%) of 39 patients with single and double vessel disease. An abnormal blood pressure response was also predictive. In patients with ST segment depression after infarction triple vessel disease can be detected accurately by a combination of the electrocardiographic and haemodynamic variables attained on exercise.\r"

Collateral development was graded during coronary cineangiography according to the extent of opacification of the collateral and epicardial arteries distal to the site of occlusion (collateral index 0 to 3). Angina was considered to be present before myocardial infarction if it had occurred more than one week before acute myocardial infarction. Collateral channels were visible in only two of 19 patients without angina before infarction and nine of the 18 patients with angina before infarction. The prevalence of angina and the collateral index were not significantly influenced by the extent of coronary vessel disease. It is concluded that myocardial ischaemia is important in promoting collateral development in man as well as in laboratory animals.\r"

The purpose of this study was to investigate the diurnal variation in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure (an indirect measure of left ventricular filling pressure) in six normal subjects, 18 patients with coronary artery disease, five with variant angina, and six with syndrome X. A transducer tipped catheter and a simple recording system were used to record ambulatory pulmonary artery diastolic pressure for 24 hours. Variation in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure was related to the timing of episodes of ST segment depression and elevation by simultaneously recording a frequency modulated electrocardiogram. Episodes of ST segment change occurred predominantly in the early morning (midnight to 6 am) in variant angina (eight out of 14 episodes) whereas in syndrome X all episodes were recorded during the day. In coronary artery disease both painful and painless episodes were distributed throughout the day, with 10 out of 67 episodes occurring between midnight and 6 am. A similar diurnal variation in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure was seen in the groups--that is, values were low during the day and higher at night, with the maximum values between midnight and 6 am. The 24 hour median pulmonary artery diastolic pressure was higher in patients with coronary artery disease than in the control group and those with syndrome X. The finding that pulmonary artery diastolic pressure, and therefore left ventricular end diastolic pressure, is greatest in the early morning may represent the background haemodynamic state in which other factors lead to myocardial ischaemia during these hours.\r"

  ".W": "M mode echocardiography was used in 10 normal subjects to study left ventricular dimension and function variables at identical heart rates during tachycardia induced by supine bicycle exercise or atrial pacing. Echocardiographic data were analysed independently by two observers. The maximum heart rate reached during atrial pacing was lower (mean (1SD) 148 (17) beats/min) than that reached during exercise (mean (1SD) 167 (14) beats/min). The left ventricular end diastolic dimension was greater before supine exercise than before atrial pacing, probably as a result of leg raising. At each graded exercise step the end diastolic dimension remained greater than during atrial pacing and the differences became progressively greater with increasing heart rates. The left ventricular end systolic dimension was not significantly different at each step during the two stresses. During recovery the end systolic dimension was significantly smaller after exercise than at corresponding heart rates induced by atrial pacing. Left ventricular function indices--fractional shortening and peak rates of left ventricular systolic and diastolic dimensional change--were significantly higher during exercise than during atrial pacing and the differences increased with heart rate. It is concluded that the intervention used to change heart rate has an important effect on M mode echocardiographic left ventricular dimensions; indices of left ventricular performance increase progressively during exercise and differ from those measured at the same heart rate during atrial pacing; it is important to consider heart rate, stroke volume, and loading conditions when reference values are used and when the effects of a particular stress are to be interpreted.\r"

The acceleration time of the flow velocity and ventricular systolic time intervals were measured on recordings obtained at the right and left ventricular outflow tract, and the patency of the ductus arteriosus was evaluated by the flow at the pulmonary end of the ductus. The flow velocity pattern of the right ventricular outflow tract changed from a triangular shape with a peak velocity in early systole in the younger age groups to a dome-like contour with a peak velocity in mid-systole; thus the ratio of mean acceleration time to right ventricular ejection time increased with age. The flow velocity pattern of the left ventricular outflow tract was triangular in all age groups, and the ratio of mean acceleration time to left ventricular ejection time showed no significant change with age. The right ventricular pre-ejection period shortened and the right ventricular ejection time lengthened with age; thus the ratio of mean right ventricular pre-ejection period to right ventricular ejection time decreased with age. The left ventricular systolic time intervals showed no significant change with age. The ductus arteriosus was patent in all subjects who were less than 12 hours old but was closed in the older neonates. Pulsed Doppler echocardiography is a valuable method of evaluating pulmonary vascular bed in the early neonatal period.\r"

Damage to the valve leaflet caused by balloon dilatation was probably the result of using a balloon with a diameter that was too large in relation to the aortic valve ring diameter and of shearing forces created in the aortic wall by the contracting ventricle.

In the case of the septal leaflet, the result is exaggerated offsetting of the atrioventricular valves. Thus it might be supposed that in Ebstein's anomaly of the mitral valve, downstream displacement of the aortic (septal) leaflet of the mitral valve could move its attachment beyond that of the tricuspid valve, resulting in reversed offsetting. To examine this hypothesis three patients each with a concordant atrioventricular connection were studied. The first, with Marfan's syndrome and without an abnormal mitral valve, had reversed offsetting shown by echocardiography. The second, without Marfan's syndrome and with Ebstein's anomaly of the mitral valve, showed echocardiographically normal offsetting but a displaced mural leaflet. The third, in whom Ebstein's anomaly of the mitral valve was confirmed at necropsy, showed all the features of the second case, with normal offsetting of the atrioventricular valves. Thus reversed offsetting is not a feature of Ebstein's anomaly of the mitral valve and in the first case this feature was caused by upward displacement of the tricuspid valve secondary to dilation of the aortic root.\r"

In patients with systemic scleroderma natural killer cell activity was significantly decreased compared with the controls. NK cell activity was markedly lowered in patients with diffuse scleroderma and in transitional form acrosclerosis-diffuse scleroderma, and was normal in cases of acrosclerosis and/or CREST syndrome and in cases of prodromal or incipient scleroderma. Antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity of mononuclear cells from the systemic scleroderma patients was within the normal range. The lowered natural killer cell activity correlated with the severity of systemic scleroderma, in terms of the extent of skin and organ involvement.\r"

The skin fibroblasts from the patient were about twice as sensitive to the lethal effects of 254 nm ultraviolet (UV) radiation as those of Group C XP patients, and about twice as resistant as those of typical Group A XP patients. The ability of these fibroblasts to reactivate UV-damage adenovirus 5 was intermediate between those of Group C and typical Group A patients. The patient's cells were assigned to genetic complementation Group A by use of the cell-fusion technique. This is the first case in Japan of a Group A XP patient with mild neurological abnormalities. The mild cutaneous manifestations of this patient may be explained by the residual ability of the cells to repair UV-damaged DNA.\r"

In 49 cases of generalized skin disease (plaque disease +/- tumours; erythroderma) treated with total skin electron beam therapy there was a 24% 5-year disease-free survival; this potential for long-term survival was seen in cases with generalized plaque disease without lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the cases showed a continuously relapsing course. The extent of skin involvement and presence of lymphadenopathy can both be used as known prognostic factors to adopt a logical plan of treatment.\r"

In mice, the number of Langerhans cells reactive with anti-macrophage F4/80 monoclonal antibody steadily declined by approximately 85% within 10 days after irradiation, consistent with previous studies, in which Langerhans cells were identified in epidermal sheets by ATPase activity or presence of Birbeck granules. Remaining Langerhans cells were exceptionally dendritic. Very few Birbeck granule-containing cells were found in murine popliteal lymph nodes before or after irradiation but damaged cells were present in superficial strata of irradiated epidermis. The morphology and number of epidermal F4/80-positive cells approached normal by 15 days after irradiation. In guinea-pigs, gradual suprabasal movement and loss of rounded, ATPase-positive Langerhans cells from the epidermis were detectable from 5 to 20 days after irradiation but the magnitude of the cell loss and redistribution was partially obscured by the simultaneous appearance of clusters of replacement Langerhans cells in the basal layer and by keratinocyte hyperplasia.\r"

In the normal cervix, thymocyte antigen (T6) and adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) demonstrated the largest population of Langerhans' cells. MHC Class II positive cells were equivalent to 60%, and S100 positive cells were equivalent to 35% of T6 or ATPase positive cells. Whereas Langerhans' cells demonstrated by T6, ATPase, and MHC Class II antigen were evenly distributed throughout the epithelium, the S100 positive cells were seen predominantly near lymphocytic aggregates and capillaries. In human papillomavirus infection and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia the numbers of T6, ATPase, or MHC Class II positive Langerhans' cells were reduced by 60% but the S100 positive cells were almost completely depleted. These findings suggested that there were different subpopulations of Langerhans' cells in the cervical epithelium. The depletion of Langerhans' cells, particularly the selective depletion of the S100 positive subpopulation, might cause a localized immunodeficiency that impairs immune surveillance and the cell-mediated immune response to human papillomavirus infection and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.\r"

Comparison of the mean concentrations of LH, cortisol, oestradiol and progesterone did not reveal any statistically significant differences between the PMT and the control groups.

The risk estimate nearly doubled after placental perforation and more than doubled with a bloody tap. It is concluded that for women at relatively low risk of a fetal genetic abnormality, the indication of the amniocentesis should be reconsidered if a placental perforation is unavoidable.\r"

The systolic/diastolic A/B ratio (the ratio of peak systolic to least diastolic flow velocity) for the uteroplacental and fetal umbilical circulation was determined from the artery blood flow velocity-time waveform and used as an index of blood flow resistance. Each patient received a 1 litre intravenous crystalloid infusion before an epidural bupivicaine injection. Both crystalloid infusion and epidural anaesthesia resulted in a significant decrease in the maternal uteroplacental systolic/diastolic (A/B) ratios, associated with a decrease in fetal umbilical artery A/B ratio. This study suggests a beneficial fetal effect from the improved maternal uterine perfusion after epidural anaesthesia.\r"

The outcome was compared with that in 42 patients who were delivered for the same indication, by primary caesarean section, without prior instrumentation. Transient fetal trauma occurred only in the trials of instrumental delivery, and there was no significant difference in immediate neonatal or maternal morbidity. In another group of 61 patients instrumental delivery was attempted without full preparations for possible caesarean section and when unexpected difficulty arose, the forceps or vacuum extractor were abandoned in favour of caesarean section. Within this group of unexpected failures of instrumentation there were significantly more babies with low Apgar scores, delayed onset of respirations or needing intubation. A carefully conducted trial of instrumental delivery is an acceptable alternative to caesarean section for delay in the second stage due to a potentially difficult midcavity arrest.\r"

The anatomy of the anterior segment vessels, and the blood flow within them, has been studied in eight normal subjects. The anterior ciliary arteries feed an anterior episcleral arterial circle that has superficial and deep components. This supplies the anterior conjunctival and episcleral circulations, the limbal arcades, and the iris arterioles. Where the superficial arterial circle is deficient, isolated vessels emerge from the deep segments of the circle to supply the episcleral plexus and conjunctival arterioles. Watershed zones between the anterior and posterior territories of the conjunctival and episcleral circulations overlap. They may fluoresce up to 30 seconds after the anterior ciliary arteries. The scope of this technique and the implications of these findings are discussed.\r"

All were associated with alterations in the retinal nerve fibre layer, either diffuse or focal. The presence of these nerve fibre layer changes raises the question of transsynaptic degeneration and of possible primary or associated disease of other retinal cells than the receptors-namely, bipolar, amacrine, Mueller, or ganglion cells--in these disease of the outer retinal layer. Involvement of the nerve fibre layer also indicates the need to examine patients with defects in the nerve fibre layer by electroretinograms and other tests for outer retinal layer disease when no obvious optic nerve disease is present.\r"

The histopathology was characterised by fascicles of dysplastic spindle cells, neuroid arrangement in loose fibrillary matrix, and peri- and intraneural permeation of the nerve trunks. Despite minimal atypism the neoplasm metastasised and had a fatal outcome. The spindle cell component of the neurotropic melanoma lacked melanogenesis; Fontana stains were negative. As previously demonstrated, the histogenesis of the neurotropic melanoma is possibly a Schwann cell differentiation of the dysplastic atypical melanocytes, as shown by the positive reactions to Bodian's stain.\r"

In optic nerve degeneration a decrease in contrast sensitivity is found at low spatial frequencies. Decreased contrast sensitivity at high spatial frequencies is atypical but occurs in those disorders associated with decreased Snellen visual acuity.

Only patients in the younger age groups with low to moderate refractive errors were included in this study; high myopes and hypermetropes and patients with aphakia and mixed astigmatism were excluded. The degree of agreement for spherical equivalents, sphere components, and cylinder components was analysed separately for both cycloplegic and manifest refractions on the AR and CR. The results showed that the fixation target in the NR-1000F induces significant instrument myopia during manifest refraction in the younger patients with lower refractive errors. We recommend that caution should be exercised in interpreting manifest refractions on the AR, especially in younger patients. A cycloplegic automatic refraction would be acceptably accurate.\r"

The deformation index (DI) of ellipsoidally deformed cells was shown to be a function of beta gamma eta ex(eta ex/eta in)alpha, where gamma eta ex is applied shear stress, eta ex and eta in are external and internal viscosities, respectively, and alpha and beta are adjustable parameters related to the membrane viscoelastic properties. The increase of suspension viscosity at higher hematocrits (Hts) generally enhanced the ellipsoidal deformation of cells, in the same manner as increasing the suspending medium viscosity of a diluted cell suspension. The suppressing effect on cell deformation appeared above a certain Ht. When intact cells were mixed with glutaraldehyde-treated, hardened cells, the ellipsoidal deformation of intact cells was disturbed. The suppression of deformation probably occurred through disturbance of laminar flow-lines around intact cells.\r"

Both the discocyte-echinocyte and discocyte-stomatocyte transformations resulted in an increased resistance to extension. Sodium salicylate-treated erythrocytes could be returned to normal morphology and normal membrane rheology by addition of chlorpromazine.

  ".W": "The possibility has been repeatedly raised that erythropoiesis results from clonal succession--the differentiation of one or a very small number of the most primitive stem cells that are sequentially activated to proliferate forming clones of differentiated cells and then eventually decline, to be replaced by new stem cell clones. We studied this possibility in chimeric mice made by combining embryos from two different strains so that they would have two distinct stem cell populations, each of which produces a different hemoglobin type (d and s). These were compared with F1 hybrids in which every stem cell produces both types. We measured the percentage of type d in seven to ten serial samples of circulating reticulocytes taken at three- to seven-day intervals and found that the variability in percent of this hemoglobin was only slightly higher in the chimeric mice than in F1 controls; SD ranged from 2.7% to 5.5% in the chimeric mice and from 3.4% to 3.9% in the controls. Using the binomial formula, the numbers of new clones formed during the reticulocyte life span, approximately three days, ranged from 33 to 118 in the individual chimeric mice. However, these numbers are underestimates because estimated numbers of clones depend inversely on variabilities, and the calculations did not exclude the contribution of experimental error to the overall variability. Total percentages of type d hemoglobin were also measured in seven to nine successive serial samples at 60- to 136-day intervals. These gave mean values similar to measures of newly synthesized hemoglobin in the same mice, but SD were larger, ranging from 5.3% to 8.4%. This reflects experimental error, both because of excess day-to-day variability found in this type of measurement and because there could not be fewer primitive stem cells activated to form clones of erythrocytes during the 45-day erythrocyte life span than during the three-day life span of reticulocytes. Since most and maybe all of the variation between successive samples in the same chimeric mouse appear to result from experimental error, many or even all of the primitive stem cells may simultaneously contribute to erythropoiesis.\r"

In this report, we describe the culture from normal human bone marrow of unique colonies of morphologically immature cells with scanty, agranular, cytoplasm and a primitive nucleus with nucleoli. These \"blast\" cells demonstrate a significant ability for the generation of secondary colonies of multiple lineages, including additional blast cell colonies. These colonies are detected at various times during the culture period of up to 28 days. Neither the time of appearance in primary culture nor any feature of the morphological appearance of the blast cells is correlated with replating ability or the differentiation pathway followed.

  ".W": "One hundred-nine cases of autoimmune hemolysis were reviewed to determine the frequency of reticulocytopenia, the state of the erythroid marrow in reticulocytopenic cases, and the course of reticulocyte production indices with time and glucocorticoid treatment. The mean hematocrit at presentation was 24 mL/dL, but 30% of cases had an initial hematocrit less than 20 mL/dL. Median reticulocyte percentage at diagnosis was 9%, and median reticulocyte production index was 2.8 times basal. Twenty percent of cases had an initial reticulocyte count less than 4%, and 37% had an initial reticulocyte production index less than 2.0 times basal. These reticulocytopenic patients were nearly evenly distributed between warm and cold antibody-mediated cases and between primary and secondary cases. Fifty-four percent of reticulocytopenic cases had a bone marrow examination during hospitalization. Three-fourths of these marrows showed erythroid hyperplasia, and erythroid hypoplasia was seen in only one case. Eighty-eight cases had serial reticulocyte measurements, and in only 15% of patients did the reticulocyte production index remain less than 2.0 times basal. Thus, in most cases, the initially low reticulocyte production index may represent a lag in marrow responsiveness to hemolytic stress. In cases with persistent reticulocytopenia, ineffective erythropoiesis is suggested by the frequency of marrow erythroid hyperplasia. In the cases that were initially reticulocytopenic and demonstrated an increase in reticulocyte production index, the magnitude of this increase was significantly greater in glucocorticoid-treated patients than in those not so treated, indicating that a glucocorticoid sensitive component exists in the marrow erythropoietic response to hemolysis. Awareness of the frequency of an initial reticulocytopenia in cases of autoimmune hemolysis may be important in initial diagnosis and treatment.\r"

Interference with vitamin K action results in the appearance of abnormal (des-gamma-carboxy) forms of prothrombin in human plasma. Vitamin K-sufficient patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma also secrete significant quantities of abnormal prothrombin; this response has now been studied in a rat model. Normal Buffalo strain rats had 9 micrograms/mL of circulating plasma abnormal prothrombin, whereas Buffalo strain rats carrying the transplantable Morris hepatoma tumor no. 7777 had 33 micrograms/mL at 3 weeks after transplant. Vitamin K-dependent carboxylase activity was normal in the liver of these rats, but very low in the tumor tissue. Rats carrying Morris hepatoma tumors no. 9618A and 5123D did not secrete significant amounts of abnormal prothrombin. Carboxylase activity in these tumors was 15 times that of the 7777 tumor. The data suggest that the secretion of abnormal prothrombin by hepatocellular tumors is the result of normal expression of the prothrombin gene by those tumors and a failure of the tumor to express the carboxylase gene.\r"

Three of these seven had chromosomal abnormalities, including chromosome instability in one and clonal chromosomal abnormalities in two; one of the latter was a t(8;14)(q24;q32). The remaining five showed normal karyotypes. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) titers were elevated in all three patients that exhibited chromosome abnormalities, two of whom later developed malignant lymphoma. A control group of five patients with reactive lymphadenopathy not associated with AIDS failed to reveal chromosomal aberrations, but elevated EBV titers were present in two. These data are consistent with current views on the role of EBV and chromosome change in the development of lymphoma in immunodeficient states and suggest that karyotypically abnormal AIDS-related lymphadenopathy represents a prelymphomatous proliferation.\r"

  ".U": "87129374\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies have demonstrated that significant hematologic improvement occurs in the majority of patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) treated with partially purified or recombinant interferon (IFN). Fifty-three patients received IFN alfa-2b for at least 3 months in a dose of 2 X 10(6) U/m2 subcutaneously thrice weekly. Of the 49 patients evaluable for response (at least 6 months of IFN therapy), there were ten complete responses and 29 partial responses for a total response rate of 80%. The peripheral blood counts and bone marrow continued to improve over the course of a full year of therapy. IFN was well tolerated, with no patients discontinuing therapy because of toxicity. Transient myelosuppression occurred in most patients during the first 1 to 2 months of therapy, occasionally precipitating a transfusion requirement. After IFN treatment was discontinued, there was a marked decrease in normal marrow elements and a relative increase in marrow hairy cells. This was associated with a transient increase in normal elements in the peripheral blood. Only one of 24 patients followed after receiving IFN for a median of 8.5 months (range, 3 to 16 months) has required further therapy. We conclude that low-dose IFN alfa-2b is highly effective in advanced HCL; responding patients should be treated for at least 1 year. The decision to initiate a second course of IFN therapy should be based primarily on peripheral blood counts and the clinical status of the patient rather than on the bone marrow.\r"

  ".U": "87129375\r", 
  ".W": "Human platelets contain tortuous channels in their cytoplasm, the surface-connected or open canalicular system (OCS), that communicate directly with the surrounding medium through openings on the surface membrane. Some workers have suggested that the OCS serves as the egress route for products secreted during the release reaction. Others have proposed alternate secretory pathways. Since bovine platelets lack the OCS found in human cells, the present study has examined the secretory mechanism of these cells to see whether it can shed light on the mystery of human platelet secretion. Bovine platelet granules, in contrast to human granules, are located more peripherally in resting cells (often in contact with the plasma membrane), most do not move centrally following thrombin stimulation as do human platelet granules, and many fuse directly with the external plasma membrane without any intermediate channel. The lack of peripheral location of human granules, their central rather than peripheral movement during secretion, and the presence of extensive channels are all consistent with the larger importance of the secretory channel to human platelets. Thus, though studies of bovine secretion do show that platelets can secrete their granules by direct fusion of granule and surface membranes, other differences from human platelets emphasize that this pathway, although important to bovine platelet secretion, is less important in human platelets. Studies of bovine platelets also show that the OCS is more dynamic than might have been considered from human studies and can form rapidly in response to stimulation. Such newly formed channels are used as a conduit for secretion of granule contents. The finding emphasizes the importance of channels for granule secretion in platelets generally and puts a new perspective on the ability of these cells to form channels rapidly in response to stimulation.\r"

Univariate analysis identified the following characteristics associated with survival: (1) clinical characteristics: age, race, sex, performance status, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly; (2) hematologic parameters: WBC count, absolute lymphocyte and granulocyte counts, hemoglobin level, and platelet count; and (3) biochemical parameters: serum albumin, calcium, uric acid, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, BUN, and creatinine. Multivariate regression analysis in a randomly selected training subset of 217 patients demonstrated that the combination of uric acid, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, external lymphadenopathy, and age had the strongest predictive relation to survival time. The resulting model was validated in the remaining independent subset of 108 patients and led to classification of patients into low, intermediate, and high-risk groups with five-year survival rates of 75%, 59%, and 14%, respectively, and with distinctively different annual mortality rates (P less than .01). Both the regression model and Rai staging were highly effective in identifying risk groups among the entire patient population (P less than 0.001). Overall the regression model was superior to Rai staging in defining prognostic risk groups. In addition, it was able to separate patients into significantly different risk categories within each Rai stage, thus improving on the prognostic prediction of individual patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.\r"

In our experiments we have sequenced the various events that occur during the functional differentiation of the normal human neutrophil and have also examined some of the functional properties in relationship to surface markers and biochemical events. Granulocytes were obtained from the bone marrow and blood of hematologically normal individuals. Cells were separated into different stages of maturation by their physical properties using counterflow centrifugal elutriation and density gradient separation. Three cell fractions were obtained that were enriched for either immature myeloid cells, band neutrophils, or segmented neutrophils. Since the enriched fractions were not entirely pure, methodologies for functional assays were chosen that allowed cytologic evaluation of the functional capacity of each cell type. The criteria used to classify the stages of differentiation included both morphology by light microscopy and DNA labeling with tritiated thymidine. Various neutrophilic properties were studied: Fc receptors, complement receptors (CR1, CR3), phagocytosis of both live and dead opsonized Staphylococcus aureus, microbial killing of S aureus, NBT dye reduction after cellular stimulation with endotoxin, and chemotaxis. Our results indicate that the functional properties of the neutrophil appear in a distinct order. The sequence for the functional differentiation of the human neutrophil appears to be the following: Fc receptors----immune phagocytosis----complement receptors----oxygen-independent microbial killing----oxygen-dependent microbial killing----chemotaxis.\r"

Basal F-actin content in neonate cord blood neutrophils is higher than that of adults. The elevation is intrinsic to the cell and not related to parturition because basal F-actin content of neonatal cells obtained by venipuncture (days 1 to 8 of age) is also elevated (38 +/- 10, N = 15) when compared to adults (21 +/- 7.0, N = 27). The rate of N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP)-induced actin polymerization is similar in adult and neonatal neutrophils and is maximal by 30 to 45 seconds at 25 degrees C. Adult, neonatal cord, and neonatal venipuncture neutrophils increase F-actin content to a similar extent following 0.5 mumol/L fMLP activation (52 +/- 18, N = 27; 58.7 +/- 18, N = 18; 51.5 +/- 7.0, N = 15, respectively). However, the relative increase in F-actin content following fMLP activation is much greater in adult (2.37-fold) than neonatal neutrophils (1.28-fold). This difference is due to the elevated basal F-actin content of neonatal cells. Comparison of distribution of F-actin content among basal, neonatal neutrophils reveals two subpopulations of neutrophils with respect to F-actin content--approximately 25% with F-actin content similar to that of adult neutrophils and 75% with F-actin content greater than that of adult cells. Following fMLP activation, the subpopulations disappear. The results suggest that abnormalities in microfilamentous cytoskeletal organization of neonatal cells may, in part, be responsible for decreased chemotactic response of neonatal neutrophils.\r"

The present study thus examined the ability of RGDS peptides to inhibit platelet interactions with a plasmic degradation product of fibrinogen (8D-50) that resembles an intermediate fragment X. Gel-filtered, human blood platelets suspended in 0.01 mol/L HEPES-buffered modified Tyrode's solution, pH 7.5, were stimulated with 20 mumol/L adenosine diphosphate and the binding of 125I-labeled 8D-50 or intact fibrinogen (0.01 to 0.6 mg/mL) assessed in the presence of 0 to 117 mumol/L RGDS. The data revealed that RGDS decreased the apparent affinity of 8D-50 and intact fibrinogen for platelets but did not affect the maximum number of binding sites. RGDS thus appears to be a competitive inhibitor not only of intact fibrinogen (Ki = 12 +/- 2 mumol/L) but also of 8D-50 (Ki = 15 +/- 3 mumol/L) (mean +/- SD, n = 3).\r"

However, their replating efficiencies were low, and we were unable to grow colonies from adult marrow cells. We report here a consistent method of growth and identification of human blast cell colonies that are supported by low serum culture and by delayed addition of medium conditioned by a T lymphoblast cell line, C5MJ. Nonadherent mononuclear cord blood and bone marrow cells were prepared by use of Ficoll-Paque and overnight adherence to plastic. Bone marrow cells were further enriched for progenitors by panning with monoclonal anti-My-10 antibody. Cells were plated in methylcellulose culture containing 2% fetal calf serum and supplemented with bovine serum albumin, lecithin, cholesterol, and transferrin. On day 14 of culture, concentrated C5MJ-conditioned medium was carefully added to each dish. Blast cell colonies consisting of 18 to 100 cells were detected on days 21 to 28. Forty percent to 75% of the blast cell colonies in individual samples yielded secondary colonies upon replating (positive colonies). The replating efficiency of the positive colonies ranged from 3% to 100%. The largest secondary colony contained 7,800 cells. In addition to single-lineage colonies, multilineage colonies revealing two to five lineage combinations were seen. These results suggest that human primitive progenitors are dormant in cell cycle and that they survive in the absence of colony-stimulating factors. Human blast cell colonies may provide a unique population of progenitors for studies of the early process of human hemopoiesis.\r"

The younger patients more often experienced an acute arthritis with sacroiliitis resembling a reactive disease. Bone scanning was more sensitive than radiographs, particularly in detecting acute sacroiliitis and hip involvement. The lumbar spine was the most frequently involved site although no part of the spine was spared. Extensive destruction of a vertebral body with little involvement of the adjacent vertebrae, lower lumbar spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis, and discitis with calcification were striking radiological findings hitherto undescribed in brucellosis. Computerized axial tomography (CAT) scanning revealed vertebral-arch destruction in three cases of spondylolisthesis. Circumferential sclerosis of the vertebral bodies was another CAT-scan finding.\r"

Patients were assessed at regular intervals using a number of clinical and biochemical tests designed to detect specific antirheumatic activity. There were significant improvements in clinical and laboratory variables with both regimens consistent with second-line activity. Improvements were greater and more numerous with combination therapy. At the end of the trial period, there were nine 'responders' in the SASP/DPA group but only six in the SASP group. Neither efficacy nor toxicity could be related to patient acetylator status. Nausea and dyspepsia were frequent problems with both treatment regimens but dysgeusia and thrombocytopenia were confined to the SASP/DPA group. Study withdrawals were twice as common with combination therapy. These results suggest that a combination of SASP and DPA is more potent than SASP alone but at the expense of poorer patient tolerance.\r"

Microwaves have a wavelength of around 10 cm and are therefore able to penetrate clinically useful depths of up to 4 cm directly measuring tissue thermal radiation. A microwave detector was applied to the study of joint inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis and in a normal control group. Fifty-two knees were scanned using the detector and a microwave thermographic index was calculated for each knee. A strong correlation was found between the microwave thermographic index, and the clinical and laboratory parameters measured. This technique was found to be reproducible, quick, simple to use at the bedside without a controlled environment and, since it measures internally emitted radiation, is inherently safe.\r"

Measurements were performed by an independent assessor on admission, at discharge and six months after discharge. Results showed that passive stretching resulted in a significant increase in the range of all movements of the hip joints except flexion during the physiotherapy course. Follow-up at 6 months in seven patients suggested that this increase in range of movement could be maintained by patients who had been performing the stretching exercises regularly. We suggest that the inclusion of passive stretching of the hip joint in the treatment of patients with ankylosing spondylitis will increase the range of movement and thus improve function and influence posture.\r"

  ".U": "87129899\r", 
  ".W": "The current recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP), published in 1977, identify two types of effect against which protection is required. \"Stochastic\" effects are those for which the probability of an effect occurring, rather than its severity, is regarded as a function of dose without threshold, whereas \"non-stochastic\" effects are those for which the severity varies with the dose and for which a threshold may occur. The system of dose limitation recommended by the ICRP is based on the prevention of non-stochastic effects and limitation of the probability of stochastic effects to levels deemed to be acceptable. The prevention of non-stochastic effects is achieved by setting dose-equivalent limits at values such that no threshold dose would be reached, even following exposure for the whole of a lifetime or for the total period of a working life. The limitation of stochastic effects is achieved by keeping all justifiable exposures as low as is reasonably achievable, economic and social factors being taken into account, subject to the constraint that reductions in collective exposure do not cause unacceptably large individual exposures. The formulation of a quantitative system of dose limitation based on these principles requires that judgments be made on several factors including: relationships between radiation dose and the induction of deleterious effects for a variety of endpoints and radiation types; acceptable levels of risk for radiation workers and members of the public; and methods of assessing whether the cost of introducing protective measures is justified by the reduction in radiation detriment which they will provide. In the case of patients deliberately exposed to ionising radiations, the objectives of radiation protection differ somewhat from those applying to radiation workers and members of the public. For patients, risks and benefits relate to the same person and upper limits on acceptable risks may differ grossly from those appropriate to normal individuals. For these reasons, and because of its historical relationship with the International Congress of Radiology, the ICRP has given special consideration to radiation protection in medicine and has published reports on protection of the patient in diagnostic radiology and in radiation therapy.\r"

The practical outcome in terms of regulations and codes of practice is described in general terms and specific examples are taken from the regulations and codes, showing how the principal aspects of ICRP recommendations bearing on radiation risks have been incorporated. It is argued that the value of ICRP recommendations to the drafter of legislation is their general acceptability, giving a firm basis for requirements, against which too frequent and too positive detailed recommendations provide an unfortunate offset.\r"

The total neurological morbidity of 132 examinations carried out with non-ionic contrast medium (iohexol) was slightly lower than that of 98 examinations carried out with ionic contrast medium (meglumine and sodium iothalamate) but the difference was not statistically significant. However, the morbidity of 185 examinations performed by an experienced vascular radiologist was significantly lower (p less than 0.025) than the morbidity of 45 examinations performed by a series of radiologists in training and the mean time required for the procedure was 18 min longer in the latter group (p less than 0.001). These findings suggest that the neurological morbidity of arch and carotid arteriography in patients with cerebrovascular disease depends largely upon catheter technique and will not be significantly reduced by the use of non-ionic contrast medium.\r"

  ".W": "The appearance of non-hepatic uptake in 99Tcm-colloid images is an important indicator of poor liver function. We undertook this study to evaluate the ability of experienced observers to assess liver function from radionuclide images. A simple model was used to simulate the changing distribution of 99Tcm-colloid in the liver, spleen and bone marrow as the liver function and mass were varied. Suitable images of these three organs were isolated from real studies and used as \"templates\" to create realistic simulated 99Tcm-colloid images, with the count densities of liver, spleen and bone marrow determined by the model. These images were presented in random order to several observers, who were asked to assess liver function. Comparison of the estimated with the true function shows that visual assessment is systematically inaccurate, with underestimation of poor function and overestimation of good function. It is also imprecise, especially for livers with only midly impaired function. Observers were also affected by changing liver mass and were more likely to judge small livers to be abnormal. We suggest that objective assessment using a quantitative technique should be used as an adjunct to visual inspection for the evaluation of liver function.\r"

  ".W": "The accuracy (proximity to the true value) and precision (reproducibility) of relaxation times derived from nuclear magnetic resonance images were investigated. Two methods of deriving relaxation times were considered. A patient scanning protocol in which the minimum number of scans necessary for the calculation (three) were performed. Calculated T1 and T2 images were then formed. An animal (cat) protocol in which many more scans were performed. The data were read from the display and fitted by computer to the theoretical curves. The accuracy of the measurements was determined by an empirical method. A series of bottles with different concentrations of MnCl2 and CuSO4 in water were prepared and their relaxation times determined using the imager as a simple pulsed spectrometer. These values were compared with those derived from images. Over the normal range of tissue values (T1 less than 700 ms, T2 less than 200 ms) the animal protocol gave values of T1 up to 1% shorter than the true values. The T2 values were up to 5% shorter. Patient protocol values were up to 7% shorter for T1 and up to 20% shorter for T2. There was some difference between results for MnCl2 and for CuSO4 (particularly for patient T2s), suggesting that the results depend to a small extent on the T1/T2 ratio. The precision of the values was investigated by considering the standard deviations (SDs) of brain tissue measurements over populations of cats (animal protocols) and normal control subjects and multiple sclerosis patients (patient protocols). These were compared with the SDs of measurements of calibration bottles scanned with the patients. Standard deviations of 3% for T1 and 6% for T2 were found over 19 cats using the animal protocols; SDs of 7% for T1 and 14% for T2 were found over 15 normal control subjects using the patient protocols. Standard deviations of bottle measurements were similar to these figures. There are also variations between different subjects and different regions of the brain. There was no significant change between readings on the same patient in follow-up studies. Other sources of variation in the measurements made with the patient protocols were investigated by scanning phantoms. Noise in T1 and T2 images is about 2%. Spatial non-uniformity within slices is about 1% for T1 and 10% for T2. Non-uniformity between slices in multislice sets is 4% for T1 and 14% for T2. There is no long-term variation in measured values over 9 months; short-term variation is approximately 1%.\r"

Frequencies by type, age and sex and values of the main technical parameters of radiological examinations are presented. Organ doses, effective dose equivalents and risk estimates are given for 14 selected examinations. The annual per-capita effective dose equivalent and the genetically significant dose are estimated at 0.848 mSv and 0.253 mSv, respectively. From these values, collective risks have been predicted by using the risk factors given in the International Commission on Radiological Protection Publication 26. The results indicate that 14 persons risk induced malignancies and 2.5 persons risk genetic detriment.\r"

The patients with a gastric ulcer were divided into high, body and prepyloric, according to the site of the ulcer. Both high and body gastric ulcers secreted significantly less than the controls, and the duodenal ulcer patients secreted significantly more. However, the patients with gastric ulcer were older and lighter than the controls and, since these factors are known to influence maximal gastric secretion, the controls and patients with duodenal ulcer were standardized to the mean weight (and age, for the controls) of the gastric ulcer group. After this standardization, there was no significant difference in secretion between the patients with body ulcers and normal controls. Pyloric loss was a similar percentage of maximal gastric secretion in all groups, but duodenogastric reflux was higher in the gastric ulcer group compared to the controls. The mean volume of duodenogastric reflux was greatest in the patients with a prepyloric gastric ulcer. It is commonly accepted that hyposecretion in patients with a gastric ulcer is due to gastritis consequent upon increased duodenogastric reflux. However, in this study, no gastric hyposecretion was evident in the body and prepyloric gastric ulcer groups, both of whom had greater than normal levels of duodenogastric reflux.\r"

Since then it has been employed for the treatment of cancers of the hypopharynx, cervical oesophagus and larynx. Results of recent reports showed a wide variability. Our previous report of 157 such operations gave a significant morbidity and overall hospital mortality rate of 31 per cent. In the 6-year period between 1980 and 1985, 91 patients underwent this operation. The morbidity and mortality rates gradually decreased to 30 and 5 per cent respectively. Changes in the indications for the operation resulted in a reduction in the number of procedures performed in recent years. Resection of the oesophagus for cancers of the pharyngolaryngeal region is indicated only when there is actual oesophageal involvement, and would be the prime indication of pharyngogastric anastomosis.\r"

Removal of the arrow, after full visualization with repair where possible, was performed in all cases with two deaths and little morbidity. Most of the 13 patients arrived in a stable condition, withstood surgery well and made a rapid recovery (average stay in hospital 20 days). Unstable presentations included 2 cases of mild shock, one with early cardiac tamponade and one case of acute aortic incompetence.

The complications were empyema (40), osteomyelitis of the rib (2), wound infection (2), pneumothorax (1), neuralgia (1) and chest pain (4). All cases were further complicated by underlying pulmonary infection and often by delay in presentation. Fifteen cases were seen in the first year (1983-84) and forty-five in the second (1984-85). A more aggressive surgical approach was adopted in the second year (21 thoracotomies with 17 decortications compared with 1 thoracoplasty in the first year). However, this course of events was accompanied by an increase in mortality from 0 to 5. Although there were a number of contributory factors, lesser surgical procedures, such as open pleural drainage, are recommended for the sicker patients.\r"

There were no significant differences in the plasma chloroquine levels of all groups, and the chloroquine concentrations reached suppressive levels for at least 3 days (greater than 0.1 nmol/ml). Oral administration was well tolerated in both patients and controls. In all areas where the Plasmodium strains are still sensitive to chloroquine and where parenteral chloroquine may not be easily available, oral chloroquine represents a cheap, easy and safe alternative for postoperative prophylactic malaria suppression. It can be applied after abdominal non-bowel-resective emergency surgery.\r"

The mucosal pH could be related to the dose of pentagastrin by a hyperbolic curve. With intact vagus ED50 averaged 0.67 micrograms kg-1 h-1 of pentagastrin and maximum effect corresponded to an average pH of 1.9. Immediately after truncal vagotomy there was a significant shift of the curve to the right corresponding to an average ED50 of 3.77 micrograms kg-1 h-1, an effect that could be described as that of a competitive inhibitor. Two weeks after vagotomy the value of ED50 had returned to the prevagotomy level. The high ED50 immediately after vagotomy is ascribed to the sudden fall in the subthreshold release of acetylcholine previously supplied by the intact vagus. The return to the low ED50 2 weeks later could be explained by denervation supersensitivity. The relation between the curves before and immediately after vagotomy suggests that the dose of the agonist be as low as possible, when testing the completeness of a vagotomy intra-operatively.\r"

Three (10.7 per cent) patients had limb amputation attributable to delayed vascular repair, crush injury and sepsis. End-to-end arterial repair following blunt trauma resulted in early failure with thrombosis in two patients. Autogenous vein grafting was used in 12 patients and is advocated in all blunt popliteal arterial injuries. Routine repair of associated venous injuries and liberal criteria for early fasciotomy were used. Exoskeletal fixation or skeletal traction for compound and comminuted fractures is recommended for simplicity of application and wound management. The significant functional orthopaedic disability following blunt arterial trauma at the knee is emphasized.\r"

Nasal carriers of the organism may be especially liable to this complication. In contrast, although S. aureus was not infrequently found in deep granulating wounds, there was no clear evidence of harm resulting in the 50 laparotomy wounds and 150 pilonidal sinus excisions studied. The susceptibility of superficial wounds to the infection is ascribed to friction from dressings. Deep granulating wounds are occasionally affected similarly when the cavity has filled.\r"

The number of major amputations has increased relative to arterial reconstructions. Our audit methods over the 10 years included the use of punch cards, two different computer programs, and a simple weekly audit of cases. The relative merits of these methods are compared. Numbers of procedures performed in Oxford were compared with expected figures calculated from the Hospital In-patient Enquiry, the Lothian audit, and the Vascular Surgical Society survey. In general the calculated and actual numbers are similar. Difficulties in finding comparable operation categories and the totally inadequate classification of nationally collected data highlight the need for improved audit in vascular surgery.\r"

Only one patient was successfully treated: her condition was markedly improved with pimozide after benztropine mesylate, clonazepam and amantadine hydrochloride had failed to help. Patients who did not respond to drug therapy were offered the option of undergoing eyebrow-eyelid muscle stripping surgery. The six patients who underwent surgery showed considerable improvement; however, side effects such as frontal anesthesia, exposure keratitis, lagophthalmus, scarring and eyelid malposition occurred, and three of the six had residual spasm. At this point type A botulinum toxin became available. A total of 27 patients (26 who did not respond to drug therapy, including the 3 with residual spasm after surgery, and 1 previously untreated patient) received type A botulinum toxin injections. Most experienced rapid relief from their spasms. The beneficial effects lasted weeks to months, and there were no major side effects. Treatment with type A botulinum toxin appears to be a safe and effective means of temporarily relieving blepharospasm. The long-term results with repeated injections are yet to be determined.\r"

Type A people have been characterized as hard-driving, competitive, aggressive and hurried. A number of investigators have attempted to correlate these facets of type A behaviour with increased risks of CAD. However, there have been conflicting results, primarily owing to differences in methods and CAD outcomes and inconsistencies associated with measuring the type A behaviour pattern. As a result, researchers have begun to focus on subcomponents of the type A behaviour pattern, particularly hostility and anger, that appear to be more reliable predictors of CAD outcome. A reconceptualization of the type A behaviour pattern is required.\r"

  ".W": "The response of asthmatic airways to irritant stimuli is twofold: bronchoconstriction and airway inflammation. The inevitable mechanical consequence of bronchoconstriction is hyperinflation of the lungs, a phenomenon that produces characteristic clinical and radiologic signs. Hyperinflation helps to maintain airway patency at the expense of increased respiratory muscle work. Airway inflammation accounts in large part for the increased ventilatory drive of asthmatic patients, which results in alveolar hyperventilation and dyspnea. The resultant respiratory alkalosis further compromises tissue oxygen delivery both by cerebral vasoconstriction and by the leftward shift of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve. Optimal correction of hypoxia in the hyperventilating asthmatic patient requires delivery of oxygen at a high flow rate. Failure of patients with asthma to respond to simple bronchodilator therapy indicates the presence of continuing inflammatory activity and hence the need for anti-inflammatory therapy and frequency monitoring.\r"

For both sexes the incidence of hypertension rose with increasing age. The incidence was higher among men than among women until age 50, after which it was similar for the two sexes. Obesity was positively associated with incidence for both sexes. In men this association diminished significantly with increasing age. The similar trend in women fell just short of statistical significance. In men but not women heavy alcohol consumption was positively related to the incidence of hypertension. However, the broad definition of this variable may have obscured a relation in women. Among men the effect of obesity on the incidence of hypertension was less for heavy drinkers than for light drinkers. Smoking was not related to the incidence of hypertension in either sex.\r"

The results closely resemble those of studies performed in the United States: the choice of a nonurban practice location is significantly more likely if the physicians and their spouses have nonurban backgrounds and if the physicians have had a nonurban preceptorship during undergraduate medical education. In this study practitioners who were male and whose fathers were farmers or health care professionals were also more likely to practise in nonurban areas. These findings will help in making physician distribution more equitable.\r"

Of the 346 children studied, 12.1% were found to be iron deficient. The overall prevalence rate of thalassemia minor was 6.7%. Among the 166 children aged 6 to 12 months, more of those who were breast-fed for at least 2 months than of those who were bottle-fed were iron deficient (27.0% v. 7.0%; p less than 0.001). This difference persisted after controlling for the effect of iron-fortified formula. No such difference was found among those older than 12 months. The observed prevalence of iron deficiency was closer to the rate reported for black children than to that reported for white children in the United States. The findings stress the importance of conducting further studies of iron deficiency among Chinese subpopulations in North America.\r"

There was considerable variation in the total curriculum time devoted to family medicine and in the content of and support for an undergraduate curriculum in family medicine across the country. In order to achieve nationally acceptable standards and greater continuity between undergraduate and postgraduate training, the College of Family Physicians of Canada and the Association of Canadian Medical Colleges should develop objectives and program requirements.\r"
