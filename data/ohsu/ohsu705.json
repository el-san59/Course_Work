Visual recovery was maintained in all patients during a follow-up period of 6 to 18 months (average, 11 months). Seven patients had experienced a previous NAION in the eye that was not operated on that did not improve spontaneously. Surprisingly, 2 of these 7 eyes with long-standing decreased vision demonstrated some visual improvement after surgery on the contralateral, acutely affected eye. Spontaneous visual improvement did not occur in an age- and sex-matched control group of 12 patients with similar entry-level visual acuity and field loss. Only 1 of 3 patients with sudden, nonprogressive visual loss secondary to NAION improved after surgery. In a control group with nonprogressive NAION, 2 of 15 eyes (14 patients) demonstrated spontaneous improvement. Optic nerve sheath decompression improves visual loss due to progressive NAION, a disorder without any previously effective therapy. However, for acute, nonprogressive NAION, surgery for a small number of patients did not improve the natural history of the disease.\r"

We found a much more significant correlation between the response and the amount the muscles were recessed from the insertion than from the corneoscleral limbus. Using partial correlation coefficients, we found that when we corrected for the amount of recession from the insertion, there was not a significant correlation between the response to surgery and the amount the muscles were recessed from the corneoscleral limbus. This suggests that the apparent correlation between the response to surgery and the amount of recession from the corneoscleral limbus simply reflects that the greater the recession from the corneoscleral limbus, the farther the muscle is likely to end up posterior to the insertion.\r"

All but one of the patients had bilateral cytomegalovirus retinitis and none were able to tolerate therapy with systemically administered ganciclovir because of myelosuppression in six patients and hepatotoxicity in one patient. Intravitreal ganciclovir therapy was discontinued in two patients within the initial 2-week induction phase because of severe intractable thrombocytopenia in one patient and retinal detachment in the other. The retinal detachment could not be conclusively attributed to the injections and was probably a secondary complication of cytomegalovirus retinitis. The remaining five patients were treated weekly, with the course of therapy ranging from a minimum of 14 weeks (18 injections) to a maximum of 56 weeks (58 injections). The patients were followed up for an average of 23.5 weeks. All eyes responded to intravitreal therapy initially, while the six untreated control eyes with cytomegalovirus retinitis all demonstrated progression of disease. Two eyes relapsed while receiving intravitreal doses of 200 micrograms of ganciclovir sodium and were subsequently treated with 300 micrograms of ganciclovir sodium per injection. One eye responded to this regimen, while in the other one the disease progressed. In the long-term treatment group, one eye developed Staphylococcus epidermidis endophthalmitis, which was treated with vitrectomy and intravitreal and systemic antibiotics.\r"

One eye of each patient underwent surgical goniotomy under general anesthesia, and the other was treated by neodymium-YAG laser goniotomy under oral chloral hydrate sedation (average energy, 76.6 mJ). Mean pretreatment intraocular pressure in the surgical goniotomy group was 28.4 mm Hg and in the laser goniotomy group it was 29.5 mm Hg, decreasing to 23.6 and 23.1 mm Hg, respectively, following treatment. There was a strong positive correlation (r = .81) between the percent of intraocular pressure change after laser treatment (mean, -14.4%) and that after surgery (mean, -14.3%). Our preliminary results indicate that neodymium-YAG laser goniotomy is an effective, noninvasive alternative to surgical goniotomy.\r"

The number of microaneurysms in color stereoscopic fundus photographs of seven standard fields was counted in the eyes of diabetic persons (n = 236) who had only microaneurysms in photographs at the baseline examination. If only one eye was involved (n = 121), the mean number of microaneurysms was 2.3; with bilateral involvement (n = 115), the mean was 9.3 in the more involved eye. The number of microaneurysms at the baseline examination was positively associated with significant progression of retinopathy. This relationship remained after controlling for the level of glycosylated hemoglobin. These data suggest that the number of microaneurysms at baseline is an important predictor of progression of diabetic retinopathy. Microaneurysm counts may prove to be a useful early end point in clinical trials.\r"

The average size of the 95% confidence intervals for individual depth measurements for healthy subjects and those with elevated IOPs were 166 and 232 microns in the optic nerve head and 205 and 261 microns in the peripapillary retina, respectively. Variability was significantly less for healthy subjects than for those with elevated IOPs. Variability was significantly greater for depth measurements in the peripapillary retina than for measurements in the optic head. Knowledge about variability of individual depth measurements is useful for proper interpretation of computerized topographic mapping to detect retinal nerve fiber damage.\r"

All the corneas reepithelialized; no subsequent recurrent erosions occurred. All seven corneas that received an ablation of less than 50 microns were clear centrally at 8 weeks. At an ablation depth of approximately 100 microns, opacification and scarring were observed biomicroscopically and histopathologically in two specimens. No evidence of new collagen formation or epithelial hyperplasia was found in any of the seven corneas that remained clear. Stromal remodeling was observed in the two corneas that exhibited scarring.\r"

Due essentially to amitotic cell division, a multinuclear cell population, mainly binuclear, appeared and increased to a number of 3999 +/- 746 and 3,129 +/- 877 on the sixth and seventh days, respectively, after scraping. Thus, mitotic and amitotic cell division is an integral part of the posttraumatic regeneration process of the corneal endothelium of cats.\r"

Using 2- to 3-week-old cultures, certain glutamate antagonists, anesthetics, calcium blockers, and thiopental sodium were screened for their effect in protecting cells from hypoxia. The most remarkable effect was noted with thiopental. Quantitative measurements showed a significant increase in the percent of cells surviving after exposure to hypoxia in the presence of 100 mumol/L of thiopental sodium compared with control hypoxic cultures--82% vs 59% at 48 hours. A dose-response curve demonstrated maximal effect at 50 mumol/L of thiopental sodium, with toxic effects noted at 200 mumol/L of thiopental sodium. Our results show that thiopental reduces hypoxia-induced damage to retinal cells in culture.\r"

The practices and behaviors associated with an increased risk of trachoma were studied in central Tanzania, where a stratified random cluster sample of 8409 people was examined. Data were collected on family and individual characteristics and behaviors and on trachoma status. Overall, 60% of the children aged 1 to 7 years had active inflammatory trachoma, and 10% of those aged 60 years or older had trichiasis. Regression analysis showed that active inflammatory trachoma in children was associated with the characteristics of the more traditional families and several measures of poor personal hygiene. Two important risk factors for severe inflammatory trachoma were poor facial cleanliness in children (odds ratio of 1.7 [1.17, 2.50]) and household fly density (odds ratio of 1.63 [1.17, 2.29]). Both factors are potentially amenable to intervention. These data suggest that an intervention strategy aimed at these hygiene measures would provide an effective method of controlling trachoma in this region, and a similar approach may be useful in other areas.\r"

These 7 sera inhibited not only IL-1 alpha-induced endothelial cell adherence to neutrophils, but also IL-1 beta-induced endothelial cell adherence, although to a lesser extent. These sera showed no influence on tumor necrosis factor-induced endothelial cell adherence. No inhibitory activity was found in 40 sera from normal control subjects. Studies to further examine these effects included gel filtration analysis of 2 of the RA sera. The inhibitory activity was eluted near Mr 158 kd and above Mr 250 kd. Analysis by protein A affinity chromatography showed that IL-1-inhibitory activity was present in protein A-binding fractions. Purified IgG (by DE-52 column chromatography) from RA patients was found to be as potent an inhibitor as the protein A-binding fractions, which suggests that the major inhibitory activity in RA sera is attributable to IgG molecules. These purified IgG molecules also inhibited IL-1-induced proliferation of mouse thymocytes but did not influence IL-2-dependent proliferation of the CTLL-2 murine T cell line. The 7 patients whose sera showed IL-1-inhibitory activity had mild RA and low titers of rheumatoid factor. The findings, taken together, suggest a possible regulatory role of IL-1-inhibitory IgG in RA disease activity.\r"

  ".W": "We studied nursing home residents to validate the method used in national surveys for estimating the prevalence of arthritis, and to examine the impact of arthritis on institutionalization and on the physical function of residents. Five homes were studied using a 3-phase approach. Directors of nursing in each home classified residents (n = 629) with respect to the presence of arthritis and senile dementia. The presence of osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis and their impacts on a resident's initial placement were separately assessed by a physician through a chart review of a stratified subsample. The physician also rated a resident's likelihood of returning to community living. Finally, the functional impact of arthritis was assessed by a physical therapist. The nurses' estimate of the prevalence of arthritis in this population was 23.33%, while the physician estimate was 23.03%. These results are consistent with the 24.6% prevalence found in a 1977 national survey. Arthritis itself was a major cause of nursing home placement in 15% of all residents without dementia. Among those without dementia who also had arthritis, arthritis was a major cause of institutionalization in 31%. None of the residents without dementia showed substantial potential for reintegration into the community. Controlling for age, residents with arthritis had more pain, were more likely to require assistance in functional tasks, and were more likely to use a wheelchair daily than were their fellow residents. Nevertheless, our results suggest that arthritis, despite its impact on function, in and of itself is not a major cause of nursing home placement or ongoing institutionalization.\r"

The purified Ki antigen gave a single polypeptide with an MW of 32,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and it specifically reacted with anti-Ki antibody by immunoblotting. The isoelectric point of the Ki antigen was found by isoelectric focusing to be 4.3. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the purified Ki antigen was established, and the clinical significance of the anti-Ki antibody in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was studied. Thirty of 140 patients with SLE (21.4%) had anti-Ki antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, whereas 11 (7.9%) were positive by double immunodiffusion. Analysis of clinical and serologic data on patients with SLE suggested a higher prevalence of central nervous system involvement in patients with anti-Ki antibody.\r"

Of the 3 groups of sera studied, those containing anti-Ro (SS-A) alone had the highest degree of reactivity with human Ro (SS-A) after absorption with bovine spleen extract, followed, in descending order, by sera containing anti-Ro (SS-A) and anti-La (SS-B), and sera containing anti-Ro (SS-A) and anti-nuclear RNP. The groups of sera could be distinguished on this basis. Sera with anti-Ro (SS-A) and anti-nuclear RNP could also be distinguished from the other 2 types of sera by their uniform and preferential reactivity with the 60-kd red blood cell Ro (SS-A), by Western blot analysis. These findings indicate that there are both qualitative and quantitative differences, associated with the presence of other autoantibodies, in the fine specificity of anti-Ro (SS-A) sera.\r"

All 6 patients who developed hematologic toxicity were folate deficient, and 4 of 6 had marked macrocytosis. Furthermore, the mean MCV of the patients who developed toxicity was significantly higher than that of the controls without toxicity (P less than 0.02). This difference in MCV was associated with an increased probability of developing toxicity with time (P less than 0.005). These results suggest that sustained elevation in the MCV may be a predictor of impending hematologic toxicity due to folate depletion.\r"

Ischemia was induced by a combination of hypovolemia and intracardiac injection of a cold potassiumchloride solution. To validate the model; survival rate and histological damage were assessed after ischemic periods ranging from 5 to 20 minutes. A 6-minute cardiac arrest period was withheld for further therapeutic investigations. In one group (n = 12), flunarizine was administered successively in doses of 0.5 mg/kg intravenous at 5 minutes, 10 mg/kg intraperitoneal at 1 hour, and 20 mg/kg orally at 16 and 24 hours after recirculation. The second group (n = 13) received only the vehicle. Flunarizine, although not affecting mortality; significantly reduced the mean number of ischemic neurons in CA1 hippocampus from 83% in the control to 44% in the drug-treated series (P = 0.014). The results are indicative of the usefulness of this cardiac arrest model to study morphologic aspects of cerebral injury. The results obtained with flunarizine show the effectiveness of this drug even when it is administered after a severe ischemic insult such as global complete ischemia.\r"

This study evaluated the accuracy of Chemstrip bG (Bio-Dynamics, Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN), Dextrostix (Ames, Miles Laboratories, Elkhart, IN), Glucostix (Ames), and Visidex II (Ames) as compared with hospital laboratory values in an emergency department (ED) setting. Blood samples from 96 ED patients were tested for glucose concentration by each of the four strips and by the hospital laboratory. Each strip was evaluated for sensitivity, specificity, correlation coefficient (r), 95% confidence intervals, and kappa statistic (kappa, a measure of agreement between nonparametric data) using laboratory values as reference. In addition, six observers scored each strip for ease of interpretation using an ordinal scale of 1 (poor) to 4 (excellent). From the samples, no patients were hypoglycemic (less than or equal to 60 mg/dL), 83 were euglycemic (greater than 60 and less than 160 mg/dL), and 13 were hyperglycemic (greater than or equal to 160 mg/dL). Results suggest that over the range of glucose concentration sampled, there is good to excellent correlation with laboratory values for all strips except Dextrostix. The lower r value for Dextrostix is in part artifact due to limitation of its range of measurement to less than or equal to 250 mg/dL. Decreased accuracy for all strips in the hyperglycemic range may have been attributable to small sample size. Chemstrip bG and Visidex II were found to be subjectively easier to interpret.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Quantitative serum toxic screening (TS) was performed for 164 (93%) of these patients; positive results were noted for 133 patients (81%). Six classes of drugs (ethanol, benzodiazepines, salicylates, acetaminophen, barbiturates, and tricyclic antidepressants) were responsible for nearly 70% of all drug detections and were associated with 80% of all admissions in this patient sample. Only two patients (1%) had drug-specific treatment initiated because of TS results. In 12 patients (7%), TS confirmed substances for which specific treatments had been initiated on clinical grounds. Four patients (2%) had drug-specific treatment discontinued because of TS results. Thirty-two patients (19%) were admitted to a medical service; however, only seven patients (4%) were admitted primarily because of TS results. All other patients were admitted because of clinical abnormalities that required inpatient care. It is concluded that only a few drugs are responsible for most drug overdoses. Moreover, TS results rarely change the treatment or disposition of overdose patients; these decisions are typically based on clinical parameters.\r"

The purpose of this study was to document whether patients with ruptured ectopic pregnancy manifest a tachycardic response to hypotension and to define the relationship between hemodynamic response and blood loss resulting from hemoperitoneum. A retrospective chart review of 154 patients with documented ectopic pregnancy identified 20 (13.0%) hypotensive patients (systolic blood pressure less than or equal to 90 mm Hg). Eleven (55%) patients were not tachycardic (pulse rate less than 100 beats/min) and nine (45%) patients were tachycardic. The quantity of hemoperitoneum varied widely in each group and did not correlate with the hemodynamic response. These results support the proposed theory that hemoperitoneum may trigger a parasympathetic reflex, resulting in a pulse rate inappropriate for the degree of hypotension. A vasovagal reflex may play a role in those patients without significant hemoperitoneum. The diagnosis of hypovolemic shock must be considered when hypotension is present without tachycardia.\r"

  ".W": "In order to characterize the decrease in blood pressure that occurs in the emergency department (ED) setting in cases of nonemergent hypertension before beginning pharmacological therapy, 94 consecutive cases of hypertension seen at the University of Illinois Hospital were reviewed. Each patient in the analysis had a triage blood pressure recorded by the nursing staff and second blood pressure reading taken between 10 minutes and 2 hours after the triage pressure before pharmacological therapy was begun. Patients with diastolic pressures less than 90 mm Hg were excluded, as were patients with acute end-organ pathology secondary to hypertension. In the remaining 54 cases, the mean arterial pressure fell by 6% (P less than .003), the systolic pressure fell by 6% (P less than .022), and the diastolic pressure fell by 6.4% (P less than .003), suggesting that in nonemergent hypertension, a significant decrease in blood pressure occurs in the ED before pharmacological therapy is begun. The blood pressure decrease was not statistically different when sex and age were considered, but when patients were grouped into those with diastolic pressures between 90 mm Hg and 114 mm Hg and those with diastolic pressures greater than or equal to 115 mm Hg, there was a statistically significant decrease in systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures only in patients with diastolic pressures greater than or equal to 115 mm Hg. Our findings suggest that patients with nonemergent hypertension do not always require immediate and aggressive pharmacological intervention in the ED setting and are best observed for a short period and then reassessed before beginning pharmacological therapy.\r"

We reported on ACTGs in which mesh tubes were fabricated from ultra-fine polyester fibers (UFPF) and used as a framework. Antithrombogenicity was established using an original heparinization method, with a 50% patency 1 month postimplantation. Early failure of these grafts was caused mainly by loss of antithrombogenicity before development of endothelialization on the inner surface. In this study, higher concentrations of heparin were used for in situ heparinization of the grafts before implantation in combination with antiplatelet therapy (cilostazol, OPC-13013 for the first month after substitution for canine carotid arteries. As a result, more complete healing of the grafts was attained, with a patency rate of 63% at 1 month, when small doses of antiplatelet agents were used. More intensive antiplatelet therapy resulted in impairment of graft healing, causing hematomas around the grafts. Thus, optimal doses of antiplatelet agents remain uncertain.\r"

Repeated studies were performed in five patients. By visual analysis, 71% (5/7) of the imagings (7 images/5 patients) showed PD at early study 1-3 months after surgery, 9% (1/11) at intermediate study at 6-46 months (mean 21 mon) (11 images/10 patients) and 0% at late study at 81-132 months (3 images/3 patients). Quantitative analysis was made using relative ratio of radioactivity at the graft area to the area of the brachiocephalic artery (platelet accumulation index or PAI). The PAI was 1.85 +/- 0.47 (mean +/- SD) at early study, 1.51 +/- 0.23 at intermediate, and 1.36 +/- 0.37 at late study (NS). There was no significant difference in the late pressure gradients across the conduit (16-68 mon postoperatively) between the two groups with (n = 3) and without (n = 5) PD at the early stage (1-18 mon postoperatively, n = 8). The result may indicate that PD to the valved conduit in the right ventricular (RV) outflow tract occurs early postoperatively (mostly within 3 mon). The relationship of the PD detected by this method to late obstruction was not clarified in this study.\r"

To investigate this problem, the authors have developed angioscopy for examination and detection of occlusion developing to allow early use of transluminal balloon angioplasty (PTA) or laser angioplasty and prevent occlusions. The authors have examined 27 patients using a 2.7 mm diameter Olympus flexible angioscope and 9F sheath, following-up with a 4 mm balloon catheter (BARD) or SLT Nd-YAG laser. PTA was performed for 25 cases, with 19 demonstrating after one session patency lasting 9 months to date. Three cases revealed restenosis and have each received three PTA sessions. Laser angioplasty was performed in one case of 15 cm chronic occlusion, with subsequent PTA successfully enabling hemodialysis. Angioscopically, the authors were able to observe the various rest-forms within the shunt and detected the mural thrombus attached to the punctured pore. Both circumferential and valvular stenoses were observed. Initially after laser angioplasty, rough irregularity and a mural thrombus in the vessel was observed, but 2 months later, the vessel lumen had become smooth, probably due to intimal growth. Thrombus is acute stenosed cases were clearly observed. Angioplasty enabled new observations in the A-V fistulae, which allows investigation of the mechanism of stenosis or occlusion and enables an extended use of the hemodialysis blood access.\r"

ABO and HLA-A-B compatibilities were determined but not considered. Saphenous veins were cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen for variable periods (1-6 mo), so that there was the opportunity to choose the most suitable in dimension. In February, 1989, a total of 13 patients retained a well-functioning access site, whereas three had died from causes unrelated to CSVA. Because rejection of venous allografts still is debated among angiologists, recipient T lymphocyte subsets (CD3-CD4-CD8 and CD4/8) were examined, as were lymphocytotoxic antibodies, before and on days 15 and 30 after implantation. No evidence of immunologic activation was found. Moreover, in 10 of 16 patients the surgeons subcutaneously implanted a fragment of CSVA, and an immunohistochemical study was carried out using an alkaline phosphatase-antialkaline phosphatase (APAAP) technique and a panel of monoclonal antibodies. Minimal infiltration of the outer layer of adventitia was found, mainly caused by monocyte macrophages (Leu M3+) with few T lymphocytes (CD3+). The authors conclude that rejection is not a major cause of failure in CSVA in dialysis patients.\r"

The authors developed a small-caliber xenograft using new technology and evaluated the potential application for aortocoronary bypass grafting. Fresh sheep carotid artery with an internal diameter of 3 mm was obtained, and cross-linked with hydrophilic polyepoxy compounds. A 6 cm segment of the graft was then used between the aorta and the left circumflex coronary artery without cardiopulmonary bypass in 17 dogs. Sodium heparin was given during the surgery, but no anticoagulant was used thereafter. After the surgery, the dogs were randomly assigned to two groups according to the observation period. In 11 animals (Group 1), the observation period was up to 24 hr, at which time the grafts were evaluated; the patency rate was 72.7%. The patent grafts were clean and without thrombi. At the distal anastomotic lines of the occluded grafts, a thrombus was observed and a technical error was highly suspected. In six dogs (Group 2), angiography was performed to confirm graft patency between 2 and 3 weeks. The patency rate was 50% during the mean observation period of 17.5 days. One graft was evaluated at postoperative day 23. It was patent and soft, and the inner surface was shiny and smooth. Microscopic observation showed nice healing characteristics. These results indicate that it is possible for this new graft to be used for aortocoronary bypass grafting.\r"

Two weeks after implantation, many colonies of endothelial cells with openings of capillary blood vessels were noted, even in the middle portion of the grafts. Numerous fibroblasts and capillary blood vessels were also observed in the synthetic walls. These results suggest that UFPF vascular grafts provide a suitable microenvironment for infiltration and proliferation of fibroblasts, which are accompanied by the capillary formation as nutrient supply; these capillaries provide multiple sources of endothelial coverage on the luminal surface. It is expected that the new, highly porous vascular grafts may have rich endothelialization capability and stable healing properties in humans.\r"

Aspirin is used frequently as an antiplatelet agent to minimize this risk. Although the inhibitory effect of aspirin on human platelets has been clearly established, preliminary studies to examine this effect on bovine platelets revealed a minimal inhibition of platelet function in vivo as well as in vitro. Because a considerable amount of implant research is carried out in bovine models, it was considered important to evaluate carefully the antiplatelet effect of aspirin on bovine platelets. To evaluate the effect of aspirin, experiments were conducted on human and bovine blood in vitro as well as after the administration of aspirin up to 4,000 mg/day (p.o.) in calves and 2,500 mg/day in humans. Appropriate amounts of buffered aspirin were added to heparinized or citrated blood incubated for 25 min and centrifuged to obtain platelet rich plasma (PRP). An aliquot of PRP was then challenged by a predetermined concentration of ADP (an aggregating agent) or collagen to evaluate platelet aggregation and release reaction. After aspirin was administered in vivo, blood was drawn from the animal at predetermined intervals to evaluate platelet function. In human blood, the inhibitory effect of aspirin was discernable at 80 mg/L in vitro and 2,500 mg/day when ingested orally. Under identical experimental conditions, no inhibition of bovine platelet aggregation was observed using dosages of aspirin up to 1,000 mg/L in vitro or 4,000 mg/day in vivo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The welding was a success in 92% (22/24) of the peripheral artery and 83% (5/6) of the coronary artery procedures. The early patency rate was 100%. The anastomotic sites were strong enough to withstand high pressure (more than 300 mmHg of arterial pressure). Histologic examination was performed on days 0 and 3, 1 week, 3 weeks, or more than 1 month postoperatively to compare the progression of healing. The laser welded sites had a smooth external surface and minimal damage of the internal layer, with minimal inflammatory response and no pathologic granulation. The welded sites fused strongly after 1 postoperative week. In conclusion, an Nd-YAG laser, using a contact method, could successfully weld peripheral and coronary arteries to biologic vascular grafts.\r"

No bleeding complications were encountered at any time. Complications of PTFE-sil vs. PTFE were as follows: thrombosis 36.6% vs. 28.5%; infection 13.3% vs. 11.4%; seroma 3% vs. 0%; steal 3% vs. 0%; pseudoaneurysm 0% vs. 17.1%; one year primary patency 63% vs. 66%; secondary patency 75% vs. 67%.

The purpose of this study was to compare the in vitro and in vivo performance of a new glutaraldehyde stabilized, narrow diameter (4 mm), vascular prosthesis fashioned from bovine ureters (Flonova) with the saphenous vein and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) prostheses. The methods used for the comparative in vitro analysis of the bovine ureter and saphenous vein were modifications of tests recommended by the American National Standards for Vascular Prostheses. Blood compatibility was evaluated by measuring platelet consumption in an artificial circulation, and heparin uptake was quantified using tritiated heparin. The results indicate that the bovine ureter grafts have an adequate degree of mural integrity and hemocompatible properties comparable to saphenous vein. The in vivo patency in a canine bilateral femoral interposition model was 62.5% (10/16) for the bovine ureters and 43.75% (7/16) for PTFE. Bovine ureter grafts appear to have an excellent potential for use in narrow diameter peripheral and coronary arterial bypass procedures and warrant further investigation.\r"

  ".W": "Past attempts at artificial continence using a wide range of surgical procedures and devices have met with only limited success because of excessive rates of infection, rejection, incomplete continence, and technical difficulty. Presented here is a model of artificial continence using a lumen-occluding Teflon loop powered by the rectus abdominus muscle and activated by an implantable pulse generator. Eight female mongrel dogs underwent laparotomy with creation of a Brooke ileostomy and insertion of a hand-tooled Teflon band around the ileum. The free ends of the loop were sutured, under tension, to the posterior rectus sheath creating extrinsic compression of the bowel by the tightened loop. After denervation of the rectus, stimulating electrodes were implanted and connected to a transcutaneously activated pulse generator (Medtronic SE-4). Stimulation caused contraction of the muscle segment. As the free ends of the prosthetic sling approach each other, the occlusive band loosens, resulting in free drainage of intestinal contents and reduction in intraluminal pressure of the proximal ileum. Withdrawal of current allows for relaxation and return of the muscle to its resting length; this reoccludes the bowel. At 2 weeks, all dogs were continent to solid matter and all but two were continent to liquids. Two dogs developed wound infections requiring drainage. Signal attenuation across the skin resulted in total uncontrollable continence in two dogs because of an inability to transfer sufficient current to the muscle. Direct probe stimulation by an external pulse generator resulted in drainage in these dogs. Necropsy showed no evidence of bowel ischemia in any of the specimens examined at 2 weeks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "An artificial esophagus was fabricated from a collagen-coated silicone tube 5 cm long, with an inner diameter of 2.5 cm and a wall thickness of 1 mm. The outer surface was coated with dry collagen to 5 mm thickness. The bilayered prosthesis was anastomosed to the cervical esophagus of adult mongrel dogs that were fed only by intravenous hyperalimentation (IVH) with 80 cal/kg/day and 60 ml water/kg/day for 3 weeks after the operation. Once the dogs began to consume food orally, the artificial esophagus dropped spontaneously into the stomach and formation of the neoesophagus was complete. Macroscopically, the neoesophagus showed no evidence of leakage or inflammation and had a smooth internal surface, but it developed slight segmental narrowing. Microscopically, layers of stratified squamous epithelium covered the neoesophagus within 3 to 4 weeks. The most characteristic feature of the artificial esophagus was that the replacement prosthesis did not remain in the esophagus after healing. Esophageal epithelization extended into the collagen layer coating the silicone tube and a new esophageal lumen was regenerated, thereby decreasing the chance of infection and leakage. However, neoesophageal stenosis was observed when the silicone tube was removed.\r"

A 49-year-old, 75 kg patient received a J-7-70 TAH as a bridge to transplant. During bicycle exercise, the TAH heart rate, drive pressures, percent systole, and vacuum were unchanged. Cardiac output was measured by analysis of diastolic air exhaust. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was measured via a radial artery catheter. Daily recordings of hemodynamics were made from TAH day 35 to 56 at rest, cycling with zero resistance, 18 watts resistance, return to zero resistance, and at rest. Values were as follows: baseline MAP, 75.7 +/- 9.7; LCO, 6.4 +/- 0.2; RCO, 6.8 +/- 0.2. For zero watts resistance MAP was 92.2 +/- 7.2*; LCO, 7.1 +/- 0.2*; RCO, 7.8 +/- 0.3*. For eighteen watts resistance MAP was 101.3 +/- 6.2*; LCO, 7.6 +/- 0.3*; RCO, 8.4 +/- 0.4*. For zero watts resistance MAP was 98.5 +/- 4.9*; LCO, 7.2 +/- 0.4*; RCO, 8.0 +/- 0.4*. The postexercise MAP was 86.4 +/- 4.1*; LCO, 6.2 +/- 0.2; RCO, 6.9 +/- 0.2. For all but baseline and postexercise MAPs, the average response was over a 4 minute interval. The starred values were significant compared to baseline p less than 0.05. Exercise resulted in an autoregulated change in TAH CO in man. Increasing the work of exercise produced an increased CO, reflecting changes in venous return. A TAH patient can exercise for more than 30 minutes with an autoregulated CO and no deleterious effects.\r"

  ".W": "The pulsatile nature of an implanted total artificial heart (TAH) may have several deleterious effects. To define the level of TAH impact, acceleration was measured and compared with that of the natural heart in a series of in vivo and in vitro experiments. In TAH implantations in calves, miniature accelerometers were incorporated onto the housing of a Utah-100 left ventricle. Identical accelerometers were glued to felt pledgets to obtain measurement of radial cardiac acceleration when sewn to the epicardial surface of the natural heart. Measurement of natural and artificial heart acceleration was made both intraoperatively and postoperatively in several animals. Many pumping conditions were also investigated with a similarly instrumented UVAD 85 left ventricle during in vitro testing. The peak natural heart acceleration measured was nearly 2 g both intraoperatively and at rest. Treadmill exercise or epinephrine infusion produced twice the resting peak acceleration value of the natural heart. Artificial heart peak acceleration as great as +/- 100 g was found intraoperatively and postoperatively. Peak TAH acceleration could be reduced by allowing the ventricle to fill fully prior to the start of the next systole, by allowing the ventricle to fully eject prior to the next diastole, or by using a ventricular pressurization waveform that has a smooth contour with a sinusoidal-like profile. The ability to lower TAH acceleration may lead to a reduction in undesirable consequences of TAH implantation.\r"

The platelet count decreased during the first 10-30 weeks, but returned to preoperative levels by week 35. Platelet survival in 4 calves in stable condition was normal, and the leukocyte count and absolute neutrophil count were within normal limits. At autopsy, thrombotic complications and organ infarction were noted in 13 calves, and major septic complications were documented in 10 animals. The authors' observations indicate that thromboembolism and infection are major complications of long-term use of the PAH.\r"

A prospective evaluation of a strategy based on enoximone (E) given IV, in addition to sympathomimetic drugs, permitting to buy time, and delay by hours or days the decisions, has been performed from 1985 to 1988. Thirty-four patients in cardiogenic shock with hemodynamical criteria for TAH implantation have been included: Cl was 1.8 +/- 0.2 L/min/m2 PCWP 29 +/- 7 mmHg, diuresis less than 20 ml/hr. The protocol permitted to postpone decisions of implantation in 30 cases. The 4 unresponsive patients were implanted immediately with TAH (3) or VAD (1). Three were transplanted, two successfully. For 30, time given permitted discovery of hidden contraindications to transplantation in 17 patients. In 13, indication for transplantation was confirmed and performed in 11 within 6 hrs to 8 days (survival 64%). In two, sudden deterioration led to an unsuccessful TAH implantation. Multifactorial analysis showed that a 50% rise in Cl together with a 50% drop in PCWP, a 50% drop in PVR 30 min after IV E has a high predictive value of survival. These data suggest that enoximone IV bolus given in addition to maximal sympathomimetics to patients in cardiogenic shock reduces by 88% the need for TAH or VAD. It also permits a better selection of the candidates.\r"

When hypotension occurred, the cardiac output dropped sharply, and there were concomitant sudden decreases in the mean pulmonary arterial pressure and the mean right atrial pressure. These are attributed to a decrease in venous return. Since there was no recognizable change in blood volume when the blood pressure fell sharply, decrease in the venous return is considered to be caused by relocation of circulating blood, possibly associated with a sudden decrease in venous tone.\r"

The authors found that the urea gradient-induced transcellular water shift is only a very small fraction of VE, even with high urea clearance and short hemodialysis time. The net water shift was small because the urea and nonurea transcellular osmolar gradients were of similar magnitudes but in offsetting directions.\r"

Mean amount of ultrafiltrate in all patients was 3,400 ml. Mean decrease in blood volume by 20% was generally tolerated without a decrease in blood pressure. Irrespective of the different modes of ultrafiltration, a decrease in blood volume was dependent only on the amount of ultrafiltered fluid. A constant, low ultrafiltration rate was not superior to a high ultrafiltration rate. In stable dialysis patients, decrease in blood volume is dependent only on the amount of ultrafiltrate. Up to a 20% decrease in blood volume, fluid can be removed from the patient even at a rate of 2,000 ml/hr.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the ability to provide short hemodialysis (less than 9 hr per week) without the requirement for costly ultra-high efficiency dialyzers and ultrafiltration control delivery systems, 69 patients maintained on chronic hemodialysis were studied. Standard dialysis was delivered with bicarbonate dialysate, Baxter CF 1211 dialyzers, QB = 300 ml/min, mean time 215 min. The mean KT/V was 1.16. Hemodialysis prescription was changed to maintain the KT/V unchanged. Time was decreased by increasing urea clearance by increasing the QB (400 ml/min in 65 patients, 350 ml/min in 4 patients) and employing the Baxter CF 2308 dialyzer. This produced an increase in urea clearance from 192 ml/min to 256 ml/min, and a decrease in duration of dialysis to 164 min. The CF 2308 dialyzer has an ultrafiltration coefficient of 4 ml/mmHg/hr, which is easily managed without ultrafiltration control equipment. Patients were in the study group for a mean of 176.5 days. The short period of time caused no significant change in blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, potassium, bicarbonate, calcium, phosphorus, hematocrit, or symptomatic hypotension and vomiting. Patient acceptance of the change in hemodialysis time was excellent. Hemodialysis times similar to those reported by others with large experience in shortening hemodialysis time can be achieved in many instances with standard hemodialysis equipment.\r"

The authors have shown that hemodialysis patients with longer months on dialysis tend to have lower total cholesterol (TC) levels. This study extends data to examine lipid disturbances in 53 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and 126 hemodialysis patients using multivariate analysis. Longitudinal values after 9-10 months were measured in 16 CAPD patients and 52 hemodialysis patients. Analysis of covariance for all patients demonstrated an inverse correlation of TC (p = 0.003), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (p = 0.01), and apolipoprotein A-I levels (p less than 0.02) with months on dialysis. In addition, the TC level was higher in women (p less than 0.001) and CAPD patients (p less than 0.001), and correlated with age (p = 0.02) and albumin (p less than 0.001). HDL cholesterol was higher in blacks (p less than 0.001) but was not affected by gender, dialysis modality, age, or albumin. Diabetic status, serum parathyroid hormone, and blood pressure were not significant variables for TC or HDL-C. The atherogenic risk indicators, TC/HDL cholesterol (p less than 0.001) and apolipoprotein B (p less than 0.02) were higher in whites than in blacks. Longitudinal study revealed lower TC levels in individual hemodialysis patients (p less than 10(-6) by paired t-test), the fall being greater for patients with fewer total months on dialysis (p less than 0.04, by analysis of covariance). CAPD patients had no change in TC by paired t-test.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In an attempt to overcome these problems, a simple 70 mm3 displacement pusher plate, low pressure, pneumatically driven TAH was developed for temporary use. For optimal anatomic fit, easy implantation, and better flow patterns, the 5.7 X 10.7 cm total artificial heart (1) TAH was made of two essentially flat pumps integrated into a single unit. This single package approach avoids the dead space that occurs between the two pieces of conventional TAH and thus minimizes overall volume. It was designed to be positioned in the pericardial sac in a fashion similar to the natural ventricles and, based upon previous anatomic studies, fit in the average sized adult patient. In contrast to conventional free diaphragm pumps, the diaphragms of this TAH are supported by pusher plates that have a unique guide mechanism at the center to ensure a linear-controlled diaphragm motion and consequent uniform blood flow distribution. The guide of each pusher plate nests into the other, resulting in minimal thickness of the package. By using a simple displacement transducer, reliable output monitoring, with the possibility of selection of various pumping modes and adjustment of stroke volume, is possible. The authors anticipate this efficient and practical TAH to be a suitable temporary heart replacement device.\r"

They now report on the technical details of a 1 year clinical experience. Seventeen patients underwent 188 treatments. Hemoaccess was provided by antecubital veins (147 Rx), femoral catheters (37 Rx), or an a-v fistula (3 Rx). Blood flows ranged from 75 to 100 ml/min. Net plasma removed per treatment was 3,231 +/- 53 ml (mean +/- SE, n = 188). Mean plasma removal rate per treatment was 40.2 +/- 0.6 ml/min; mean treatment time was 83 +/- 2 min. Platelet counts before and after treatment revealed a 15 +/- 4% decline (n = 46 Rx). Despite filtration fractions up to 86% there was no evidence of significant membrane plugging or hemolysis. For semiselective removal of cholesterol, the rotating filter was used in a cascade system with a secondary filter. Eighty percent of processed plasma was returned to the patient, but the treatment time was prolonged by 37% and the total cholesterol removed was 26% less when compared with the single pass system. The authors conclude that an inexpensive rotating filter can provide a highly efficient plasma exchange. The inherent efficiency of this system must be considered when evaluating its use with secondary filtration techniques.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the effects of neutrophil depletion on reperfusion arrhythmias using a leukocyte removal filter (LRF), the authors examined several cardiovascular variables in three patients with myocardial infarction who underwent successful thrombolytic therapy with LRF compared with control patients without LRF. Coronary angiography performed within 4 hr of onset revealed total occlusion in the proximal segment of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, without collaterals, in all patients. Thrombolysis was performed by intracoronary administration of urokinase (10,000 IU/ml, 1,000,000 IU total) mixed with filtered autologous blood. LRF was composed of a nonwoven polyester fabric (1.8 microns, 4.6 g). Removal rates of leukocytes and platelets by LRF were 98-100% and 98%, respectively. Average duration of the ischemic episodes, maximum ST segment elevation, and integral of T segment depression did not differ in the two groups. However, the frequency of ventricular premature beats (VPB) during the first 30 min after reperfusion were significantly lower in the LRF treatment group (3.8%) compared with the control group (10.7%). Segmental shortening, measured by echocardiography one hour after recanalization, exhibited higher values in the LRF treated patients than control patients, without significant difference. Data suggested that LRF is effective in reducing reperfusion arrhythmias during intracoronary thrombolysis and activated neutrophils may play an important role in stunned myocardium.\r"

An acellular matrix made of human saphenous vein was cross-linked with a polyepoxy compound to give controlled biodegradability, hydrophilicity, and antithrombogenic properties. Four millimeter internal diameter (ID) grafts, enveloped with a polyester mesh tube of 10 mm ID were implanted in 15 puppies. The diameter of the graft grew to 9.5 mm after 1 year from the original 4 mm, and remained stable for 2 years and 7 months of observation. The newly formed neointima reinforced with polyester mesh was composed of smooth muscle cells covered with endothelial cells. The original vein graft was completely absorbed, and there were no degenerative changes such as calcification or aneurysmal dilatation. The graft maintained the expected size.\r"

It offers the same accuracy in estimating the protamine dose as that of the conventional titration method, but allows the processing time to be shortened to within 5 min. In a similar manner, the colorimetric assay can also be employed with a heparin titration procedure to quickly assess the heparin dose required for protamine reversal. This would allow physicians to exercise a quick and accurate heparin back-titration to patients who are overdosed with protamine.\r"

Six calves received an infusion of isoproterenol, a beta agonist, and three calves received propranolol, a beta antagonist. The isoproterenol was resumed after beta blockade. Isoproterenol alone caused a significant increase in CO, an effect that was attenuated but not eliminated with beta blockade. Both isoproterenol and propranolol decreased AoP, but only isoproterenol increased preload. Beta receptors play a significant role in decreasing venous capacitance with increased preload and CO, independent of the myocardium.\r"

Evaluation of polyneuropathy (PN) by CPT correlates with nerve conduction testing (NCT). CPT is convenient, painless, and may be performed during HD. Early detection of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), a complication of uremia, permits curative intervention. Utility of CPT and NCT measurements in detecting CTS in 29 stable HD patients were evaluated. Reproducibility of seven CPT determinations over 4 weeks was determined in each of 9 HD patients. The coefficient of variation for repeated 2000 Hz CPT measures was 6%. PN was detected by CPT in 92% of the patients and by NCT in 79% (r = 0.79, p less than 0.001). In 38% of the hands there was a CPT impairment in both the median and ulnar nerves (n), of which 25% were symptomatic for CTS. CPTs consistent with CTS (sufficiently greater impairment of the median vs ulnar n) were observed in 31% of the hands with combined median and ulnar n CPT abnormalities, and 11% were identified with CTS by NCT. The unique ability of the CPT exam to quantify hyperesthesia may account for its superior CTS detection sensitivity. These findings demonstrate that repeated CPT determinations are consistent and are diagnostic for CTS.\r"

This is seen as an important step toward a completely implantable ventricular assist system and total artificial heart. The TETS converts an external 12 volt DC source via inductive coupling to a regulated 14 volt output voltage for use by the motor controller. A maximum output power of 70 watts is available. In calf experiments, the TETS output power averaged between 8 and 12 watts. The motor controller was not implanted in these experiments, awaiting further development of the miniaturized electronics. The TETS output was returned percutaneously to the external motor controller, allowing the TETS output to be monitored directly. System efficiency, from DC source to DC output, and including losses in 12 feet of cable, ranged from 55% to 70%, depending upon supply voltage, motor load, and degree of coil coupling. The subcutaneous coil was well tolerated, demonstrating only temporary, mild, superficial induration.\r"

The importance of understanding the factors that affect human endothelial cell behavior is highlighted by failure of vascular prosthetic grafts to endothelialize when implanted in man. In the present study, endothelial cells isolated from microvasculature are used for their ability to be easily selected from human adult fat, their proliferative capacity, and for their immunologic properties relevant to human pathology: allograft implantation, vessel injury or atherosclerosis. The system described provides a tool for assessing the individual roles of shear stress in modulating endothelial cell morphology and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen expression. Using indirect immunofluorescent staining, initial results showed a homogenous increase of class I and appearance of class II expression after an exposure for 30 hr to physiologic arterial values. Significantly increased staining intensity was observed following exposure to supraphysiologic values. Moreover, precoating of substrate with fibronectin instead of poly-L-Lysine enhanced MHC straining intensity. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed the activated morphology of stained cells. This provides a model to study involvement of MHC expression in endothelial cell activation under physical constraints. It may contribute to the development of biomaterial for implantation.\r"

The valve seat has 12 spokes to hold the membrane, and is made of solution-cast polyurethane coated with segmented polyurethane or Cardiothane. The flexible membrane is 200 microns thick, and made of segmented polyurethane or Cardiothane by a casting method. The valves were built into a sac type blood pump. In mock circulation tests, this jellyfish valve revealed performance superior to Bjork-Shiley (B-S) valves. No stagnation point was observed in the flow visualization study, and durability testing is ongoing beyond 7.5 months. The valves were used in animal artificial heart experiments for up to 112 days with good performance. No thrombi were formed on the valve membrane or around the spokes. Although a ring thrombus was observed behind the valve, it would be prevented by perfect adhesion of the valve seat to the blood pump. The plasma free hemoglobin level was less than 2 mg/dl during these experiments. These results suggest that a jellyfish valve (Model-1) is useful in ventricular assist devices, and in short-term bridge use of a total artificial heart.\r"

Since the opening resistance was somewhat high, valves that are bistable were developed, which means they may be open or closed. These valves have lower opening resistance, and regurgitation is similar to that of mechanical valves. Eight calves have been implanted with a new, soft total artificial heart (TAH). Seven had bistable leaflet valves; the eighth had mechanical (Bicer) valves in the inflow position. Four of the calves were sacrificed after 22 to 43 days. At autopsy, the number of thromboemboli found, particularly in the kidneys, was low compared with previous experiments. None of these animals received anticoagulants other than the heparin given during heart/lung bypass.\r"

One hundred eighty-eight valves were implanted on 166 patients before December 1985: 149 patients were discharged and are recalled annually. Follow up is 99% complete. In October 1988, mean follow up was 3.5 years (3-5.5). Total patients times years is 582. Sixty-two percent of the patients are asymptomatic, 58% in sinus rhythm. Forty-seven percent do not receive any anticoagulant therapy. The linearized rates of thromboembolism (1.2% per patient-year) and endocarditis (0.17 per patient-yr) is minimal. Seven patients only had valve dysfunction requiring explantation (1.2% per patient-yr). At 5 years, freedom of structural deterioration is 95.2% +/- 2.1. Single cusp tear at a stent post is the most frequent lesion (86%) as calcifications are observed in three only (major in two, microscopical in one). Histology does not permit to ascertain whether the tear is due to tissue fatigue or abrasion. Moderate microscopic architectural disruption of the valvular tissue is observed. Composite indices of all valve mortality and morbidity show at 5 years a 89.7% +/- 2.9 freedom of events. These data, associated to the high mechanical and optimal clinical characteristics of the valve, published previously, confirm the satisfactory performances of the valve at 5 years.\r"

The mean number of cystic radiolucent lesions in carpal bones of the 21 patients with CTS was significantly greater than that in the 43 patients without CTS. On tomograms, cystic radiolucent lesions of carpal bones had interconnections with joint spaces. Inflammatory fibrous granulation tissue, with or without amyloid deposits, was found in the cystic lesions. It was concluded that cystic radiolucent lesions in carpal bones of patients on HD was related to CTS, and that synovitis and subsequent chronic inflammation were responsible. Thus, amyloid deposits did not trigger the formation of such lesions.\r"

The authors also carried out dialysis experiments at 310K to obtain solute permeability for H32PO4(2-), overall mass transfer coefficient for HPO4(2-), and pure water permeability. This study demonstrates that permeability to inorganic phosphate ion does not vary with zeta potential for cellulosic membranes, but polymethylmethacrylate membranes with highly negative zeta potentials may suppress phosphate removal from patients on hemodialysis.\r"

  ".W": "With increasing recognition of problems regarding the use of aluminum hydroxide as a phosphate binder, calcium carbonate has become the medication of choice. Use of calcium has, however, frequently been associated with development of hypercalcemia. At this institution, calcium carbonate powder as a phosphate binder, examination of its efficacy, and the frequency of hypercalcemia with its use were of great interest. Calcium carbonate powder (CalCarb-HD, 2.4 gms elemental calcium/packet) (CalCarb-HD, Lafayette Pharmacal Inc., Fort Worth, TX) was used in the study. Twenty-one end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients (17 hemodialysis and 4 chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis) were chosen and converted from their previous binder (primarily, calcium carbonate tablets) to calcium powder. The dosage was adjusted to keep phosphorus levels at 3.5 to 5.5 mg/dl and calcium less than 11.5 mg/dl. At 2 months, the average calcium level in the 16 patients remaining in the study was 9.2 mg/dl, and the average phosphorus level was 5.2 mg/dl with an average calcium dose of 1.4 packets/day. By 7 months, the 8 patients remaining in the study had an average calcium level of 9.9 mg/dl with an average phosphorus level of 5.5 mg/dl; average calcium dose was 1.8 packets/day. Total episodes of hypercalcemia (calcium greater than 11.5 mg/dl) were two. Calcium carbonate powder appears to be an effective phosphate binder in the ESRD population. The relatively few episodes of hypercalcemia may be related to possible enhanced bioavailability of the compound secondary to its powdered form.\r"

In the early dialytic phases, aberrations were more evident, with low kinetic volume (VK) values and kinetic clearance (KK) values double those obtained by dialysate collection (KDC). Over the whole session, both VDC and VK were underestimated (9.9 and 8.2%), compared with anthropometric data (VA). In 3 patients, the comparison of VA and VDC, and the behavior of effective body water clearance (KE), agreed with the hypothesis of dialysis-induced catabolism. Both disequilibrium and hypercatabolism can affect the reliability of the single-pool urea kinetic model; because of overlap, their effects are difficult to separate, and became particularly important in high-efficiency dialysis. A modified model, using V and CtET as input is suggested in order to establish the most appropriate dialysis prescription for uremia therapy.\r"

Using the endotoxin obtained and Escherichia coli J-5 as the antigen, the endotoxin antibody was measured in the serum of long-term hemodialysis patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA). It was found that the percentage of endotoxin antibody-positive patients was significantly higher in hemodialysis patients when compared with healthy controls. It was also significantly higher in hemodialysis patients using synthetic polymer membrane dialyzers compared with those using cuprophan membrane dialyzers. These results suggest that endotoxin antibody detected in hemodialysis patients was derived from the dialysate, and that the dialysate must be kept bacteria free, especially in patients using high-flux, highly permeable membrane dialyzers.\r"

NMC was obtained by grafting polyethylene-glycol (PEG) chains to the membrane surface of ordinary cellulose (OC), and it was expected that the random movement of PEG chains would prevent blood cells and large plasma proteins from coming into contact with the membrane surface, resulting in improving the biocompatibility and thrombogenicity of the membrane. Surface characteristics of NMC were rendered anionic and hydrophilic, however, the activations of complement and platelet systems were clearly suppressed in NMC. Minimum heparin requirement for hemodialysis was significantly lower with NMC than with OC dialyzer. No significant difference in solute and water removal was observed between the two dialyzers. These results indicate that NMC can provide increased biocompatibility and antithrombogenic effect while retaining the essential dialysis efficiency of OC.\r"

  ".W": "Based on an empiric analysis of urea kinetic modeling equations, three formulas were derived for use at the bedside: (F1) Ob.t = 14.W.(K.t/V); (F2) target R = e-K.t/V + 0.03 + UF/W; (F3) K.t/V = -In (R - 0.03 - UF/W); where Qb = blood flow (ml/min); t = session length (h); R = post/pre BUN; UF = ultrafiltrate volume (L/session); and W = postdialysis weight (kg). When a particular K.t/V is desired, F1 is used to estimate Qb for a given W and t. Qb, t, and/or dialyzer type are then adjusted until R = target R calculated by F2 (based on target K.t/V, UF, and W). F3 estimates delivered K.t/V from R, UF, and W. These formulas were validated against 336 conventional 3-point modeling sessions in 256 patients. The multiplier \"14\" in F1 actually averaged 12.5 +/- 2.8, the large standard deviation suggesting that use of F1 would often result in K.t/V values substantially above or below the target K.t/V. The main causes of error were unusual V/W or K/Qb. On the other hand, F2 and F3 were highly accurate: target R estimated by F2 predicted actual R (at a given K.t/V, UF, and W) very well (% error = 0.65 +/- 2.3); K.t/V estimated by F3 predicted actual K.t/V (% error = 0.74 +/- 2.7). The results suggest that attainment of a target R (F2) will ensure that the target K.t/V is being delivered; F3 is useful to estimate K.t/V.F1 is an initial estimate only of the dialysis Rx; it must be followed by adjustment of t, Qb, or dialyzer until target R (from F2) is attained.\r"

This study was undertaken to use an animal model of nondiet-induced hyperlipidemia in the homozygous Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbit (WHHL) to evaluate the effect of plasma cholesterol lowering on the progression of atherosclerosis, and to correlate plasma cholesterol levels with the amount of atherosclerotic plaque. Studies were carried out on ten homozygous WHHL rabbits divided into two groups: lipid lowering (treated) and control (nontreated). Lipid lowering was accomplished by thermofiltration (on-line plasma membrane filtration at 39 degrees C for removal of VLDL and LDL). The treated group had a significantly lower mean plasma level of total cholesterol over the course of the study than the nontreated group (293 vs. 655 mg/dl, p = 0.004). The amount of aortic atherosclerotic plaque in the treated group was also significantly lower than that in the control group (16.9 vs. 44.2%, p = 0.003). Microscopically, thickness measurements of the atherosclerotic lesions revealed that the control group had a thicker intima than the treated group. This study convincingly demonstrated the slowing or interdiction of progression of atherosclerotic lesions with lowering of the plasma total cholesterol level by thermofiltration.\r"

A decrease in LDL levels correlates with a reduction in atherosclerosis. Drug therapy and diet have been moderately successful in lowering cholesterol levels, but require significant periods of treatment. Furthermore, a patient with genetically high LDL levels, as in familial hypercholesterolemia, may need a more rapid and reliable method of decreasing serum LDL. The present study was designed to test a device which can rapidly remove LDL from the circulation. The device consists of a filter cartridge filled with semipermeable hollow fibers which have a proprietary acidic polymer (pap) immobilized on the blood/plasma contacting surfaces; this polymer has been reported to selectively bind LDL cholesterol. The device was evaluated in a hypercholesterolemic rabbit model. Reductions in LDL serum concentration, ranging from 1.4-25.3%, occurred in 6/6 studies. All animals survived the procedure. Autopsy results at 10 days showed normal histology. Binding of other proteins (HDL, albumin) were minimal and no hemolysis was observed. Results of this preliminary study demonstrate the feasibility of reducing serum LDL levels with a hollow fiber device.\r"

This study indicated that the adhesion of three cellular systems to proteins such as fibronectin and fibrinogen proceeds via the RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) ligand-receptor interaction, in which the RGD tripeptidyl sequence is the minimal amino acid sequence common to adhesive proteins. This was evident from the dose-dependent inhibitory effect of RGD-containing peptide on cellular adhesion. Additional supporting evidence was the presence of PLT and WBC receptors, which molecularly recognize RGD, verified by fluorescein-labelled RGD-containing peptide. The adhesion of vascular endothelial cells was also predominantly controlled by the ligand-receptor mechanism, and participation of complement activation on WBC adhesion was demonstrated as well. The adhesion of WBCs on surface hydroxyl group-bearing polymers proceeded via the CR3 receptor-C3b ligand interaction, in which activated complement factor C3b is chemically fixed upon complement activation. Thus, the molecular understanding of cellular adhesion mechanisms provide the basis of biocompatibility for implantation and extracorporeal circulation, as well as molecular design of artificial and bioartificial organs.\r"

Fluorescent microbeads (phi 2.02 m) were used in the evaluation of phagocytosis, and phycoerythrin conjugated Leu11c and Leu15 monoclonals identified Fc-gamma and C3bi receptors respectively. The percentage of positive cells and mean receptor density on PMN surfaces were calculated for each antibody before and after the procedures. Fc-gamma receptor expression was reduced overall in HD and PE cases, but unaffected after EC even with specific paraprotein removal. C3bi receptor was normally expressed on PMNs before and after EC, but receptor density on the cell surface increased, and phagocytosis was qualitatively and quantitatively depressed after EC. The resulting effect of EC on PMNs was therefore a temporary increase in C3bi receptor density after the procedure, which was independent of HD or PE technique, of the primary disease, and of the quality of the PE reinfusion solutions, suggesting a procedure-related effect, and a down-regulation of PMN phagocytic activity. Both effects may be related to membrane biocompatibility.\r"

Ten nonheparinized dogs (18-25 kg) had both femoral arteries catherized with 10 cm of CPC and HBPC (5 Fr.) 24 hr postinjection of 300-420 microcuries of In-PLT, and imaged for 3 hr with a gamma camera. Regional platelet deposition on three segments of catheters and the puncture site was determined. Catheters were harvested and radioactivity on the catheter segments (proximal: PROX, middle: MID, distal: DIST and puncture site: PS) of both was determined. From the platelet count in blood, and radioactivity in blood and segments of catheters, adjacent artery, and area of artery and catheter, the platelet-density [X10(3) (mean +/- S.D.)] on catheter and artery was calculated and tabulated. Proximal values were cath (CPC), 1289 +/- 1125; artery, 1355 +/- 587; cath (HBPC), 125 +/- 113; artery, 1149 +/- 1620. The middle values were cath (CPC), 1102 +/- 1109; artery, 1512 +/- 625; cath (HBPC), 132 +/- 108; artery, 1011 +/- 942. Distal values were cath (CPC), 780 +/- 584; artery, 132 +/- 108; cath (HBPC), 227 +/- 194; artery, 1457 +/- 1309. The puncture site values were cath (CPC), 106 +/- 382; artery, 1011 +/- 942; cath (HBPC), 164 +/- 135; artery, 1498 +/- 1240. The large standard deviation in retained platelets is due to embolization. The platelet-density and regional counts on catheter segments were lower with HBPC than CPC, as was the rate of platelet-deposition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Aortic LVAD cannulae were implanted through the chest wall in two calves, and each calf received a series of LVADs, each operating 1-4 days. Blood samples from the LVADs underwent CPF through 20 mu pore filters at 20 mm Hg to produce estimates of occlusive BME concentration. Laser (He-Ne) light was directed through the outflow cannula, and the differentially-scattered light was detected for computer estimation of microemboli size, volume, and frequency. Blood chemistry and coagulation parameters were also analyzed. Removed LVADs were examined with polar coordinate mapping of accumulated perivalvular thrombi. One ventricle produced significantly greater CPF results, LSMD results, and Factor XII levels. During the use of that ventricle, the CPF results increased slowly with time after LVAD connection, while the LSMD results and Factor XII levels increased immediately after connection, followed by a later decrease. This contrast is explainable in terms of the dynamic development of BME strength. The calf model appears useful for the study of thrombogenesis, and the CPF and LSMD methods of BME analysis complement each other, and other measurements.\r"

Although all patients were given heparin, a decrease in antithrombin III (ATIII) and progressive increase in thrombin-ATIII complex (TAT) and fibrinopeptide A (FPA) levels were noted during cardiopulmonary bypass, which indicated that heparinization did not completely inhibit the formation of thrombin and its function. C1-inactivator (INA) resistant fibrinolytic activity increased markedly during CPB, in parallel with the change of tissue plasminogen activator antigen (t-PA;Ag), which indicates that fibrinolytic activity during CPB is mainly of extrinsic origin caused by t-PA. Protein C antigen (PC;Ag), protein S antigen (PS;Ag), and thrombomodulin antigen (TM;Ag) were all decreased significantly during CPB. This is considered to reflect the activation and consumption of the PC-TM system in response to generated thrombin. Furthermore, enhancement of the extrinsic fibrinolytic system is easily explained by the action of activated PC, which counteracts plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), to cause enhancement of t-PA activity.\r"

Digital subtraction angiography was done every 4 weeks to examine the restenosis rate and major side branch patency. Restenosis rates within IVEPs with gaps were significantly lower than in stents without gaps in both normal and atherosclerotic rabbits.

Studies reported from this laboratory in the past have shown that certain surfaces pretreated with albumin-Immunoglobulin G (alb-IgG) become relatively more hemocompatible (reduced platelet adhesion, minimal thrombus). However, absorbed proteins, including alb-IgG, desorb rapidly when exposed to circulating blood. Therefore, efforts were made to immobilize alb-IgG on glass or Biomer as follows: a 2 mg/ml solution of IgG was crosslinked with glutaraldehyde on the test surface. Crosslinked IgG was then treated with mercaptoethanol to reduce the disulfide bonds, followed by incubation with albumin previously reduced with mercaptoethanol under conditions that allowed reassociation of disulfide bridges between albumin and crosslinked IgG. Alb-IgG immobilized at the test surface following this method was found to remain at the interface when the surface was exposed to blood in vitro for up to 7 days under static conditions. Glass or Biomer surfaces with crosslinked Alb-IgG showed considerable reduction in the adhesion of 111In-platelets and adsorption of 125I-fibrinogen when test surfaces were analyzed in a flow chamber. Under identical experimental conditions, surfaces with crosslinked albumin alone were not effective in reducing the adhesion of platelets. Crosslinked IgG or immobilization of IgG on crosslinked albumin following the above methods rendered the surfaces more thrombogenic. It was noted, however, that crosslinked proteins on Biomer were dislodged rapidly in areas with turbulent flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In an animal study, 20 CUFPs and 18 GA control grafts were implanted as patches in the right ventricular outflow tract in 38 dogs. In the CUFP at 28 days after implantation, a thin neointima, which was almost endothelialized, had been formed. Fibroblasts and vasa vasorum were seen inside both the neointima and the graft wall. At 168 days, transmission electron microscopy revealed smooth muscle-like cells in the neointima, with endothelialization. The CUFP at 486 days had maintained a white, shiny, smooth, thin, and uniform neointima with endothelialization. Neither ulcer nor thrombus formation was seen on the surface, while in the GA graft at 353 days, no endothelialization was noticed in the center and almost no fibroblasts had infiltrated into the graft wall. From these results, the CUFP should be an ideal candidate for cardiac wall substitution.\r"

  ".W": "A left ventricular assist device (VAD) with a smooth surface of segmented polyurethane was implanted in five goats for 10-55 days, and plasma levels of fibrinogen (Fg), prekallikrein (PK), fibrinogen, fibrin degradation products (FDP), antithrombin III (AT III), prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), platelet (Pl) count, and platelet aggregation (PlAg) induced by adenosine diphosphate were measured during the experiment. Heparin was administered during surgery and no systemic antithrombotic therapy was given thereafter. Before the third postoperative day (POD), plasma levels of Fg and PK were at their lowest, and increased afterward. Between the second and fifth POD PT and PTT increased to 130-160%, and returned to normal gradually. Plasma FDP appeared on the second POD and reached peak values of 10-40 micrograms/ml on the sixth POD. Platelet and AT III levels showed no uniform tendency, but the rate of PlAg decreased to levels of 6-77% before the fifth POD and remained low at approximately 80%, influenced by the pumping even after the 25th POD. In summary, VADs themselves activated coagulation and induced consumption coagulopathy to some degree. However, most of the parameters returned to normal within 2 weeks.\r"

Important features of this pump are its 1) driveability by the standard, easily available intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) console; 2) gelatin coated internal surface for blood compatibility; 3) essentially flat disc shape, 3 cm thick and 11 cm in diameter, for optimal anatomic fit; and 4) unique pusher plate guide mechanism to ensure linear motion without deflections of the diaphragm, and consequent uniform flow distribution into the pump. The guide telescopes into itself to avoid a housing protrusion for easy implantability; this controlled movement also provides a number of performance, control, and diagnostic benefits. The pump's 60 ml displacement gives up to 4.7 L/min at 80 bpm and 6.7 L/min at 120 bpm outputs in a mock loop. This VAD has been implanted in two calves for 43 to 84 days, continuously driven by a Datascope IABP console. An average 5 L/min pump output has been observed in both synchronous and fixed rate modes. No anticoagulation was required. We expect extensive clinical use of this VAD, based on its reliability, low cost, and simplicity.\r"

The system is now undergoing chronic in vivo evaluation. Cumulative animal testing of VAD, VVC, and BST subsystems are 12.1, 4.9, and 43 years, respectively. The longest implants were 279 days for the VAD, 767 days for the VVC, and 1,148 days for the BST. A chronic implant of the total system was electively terminated at 260 days. The LVAS was powered via the BST. Continuously monitored hemodynamic and pump parameters have demonstrated normal hemodynamics and LVAS operation. Periodic VVC determinations suggest a 0.8 ml/day diffusive gas loss. Tether-free operation has been demonstrated with an Ag-Zn battery backpack. The animal was healthy and free of infection as indicated by routine hematologic, biochemical and serum enzyme determinations. Hemolysis is minimal (plasma free hemoglobin less than 5 mg%). Pump output ranged from 7 to 8 L/min. Severe valve calcification was the reason for elective termination at 260 days. This preclinical in vivo experience, and in vitro reliability studies, demonstrate efficacy of the total system.\r"

  ".U": "90089128\r", 
  ".W": "Skeletal muscle (SM) can be used for long-term circulatory assist. To generate contractions of appropriate duration and strength, SM requires bursts of electrical pulse trains. Presently, the implantable pulse train stimulator for SM assist is unable, at different heart rates, to adjust pulse burst duration or delay time, adversely affecting timing of counterpulsation. A prototype implantable microprocessor based stimulator (Medtronic Prometheus) has been developed to address this issue. The purpose of this study was to test this generator in an acute dog model. A dual chambered counterpulsation device was connected to the aorta in six dogs, using the latissimus dorsi to power the pump. The generator was connected by sensing/stimulating leads to the heart/left thoracodorsal nerve, programmed to give bursts of 2 V, 30 Hz, and pulse widths of 180 microsecs. Burst delay and duration was set as a fixed percent of the R-R interval of the EKG. The baseline aortic pressures ranged from 75/33 to 118/87 mmHg. During counterpulsation, diastolic pressure increased from 17 to 50 mmHg (30-111% increase). With changing heart rates, the pulse generator spontaneously readjusted its burst delay and duration, maintaining optimal diastolic counterpulsation without systolic interference. We conclude that this new pulse generator can stimulate SM for counterpulsation at varying heart rates, and is suitable for implantation in chronic studies.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of a new external immobilization device (Immobilizer) on wound healing characteristics at the catheter exit site. Sixteen Tenckhoff catheters were surgically implanted in four Yucatan micropigs (two catheters per flank). Immobilization devices were placed on one catheter on each side of each animal; the other catheter was allowed free movement. The devices were changed daily, and exit sites were examined for wound healing progress and infection. Fourteen days following implantation the animals were sacrificed, and the catheter exit sites explanted for histologic examination. The results of this study suggest that immobilization of catheters with this device improves wound healing at the exit site, as evidenced by decreased (p less than 0.05) marsupialization/epidermal down-growth (nonimmobilized 2.9 mm vs. immobilized 1.6 mm), and an increased (p less than 0.05) macrophage/epithelioid cell/giant cell response within the exit tract or in the Dacron cuff (granulomatous response histology score of 2.3 for immobilized vs. a histology score of 1.6 for nonimmobilized). Thus, use of this device may help reduce catheter exit site problems in CAPD patients.\r"

Because previous studies showed that interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) is able to increase in vitro the number of PM0 IgG FcR in CAPD patients with relapsing bacterial peritonitis, the authors studied the in vivo effects of IP administration of IFN-alpha (1,000 IU daily in the overnight exchange for 12 months) on: PM0 superoxide generation; PM0 bacterial killing; PM0 IgG FcR; the number of bacteria in the PM0 cytoplasm; and peritonitis relapses in these patients. By the 10th day, IFN-alpha induced a progressive rise in all of the previously depressed PM0 functions tested, the disappearance of bacteria from the PM0 cytoplasm, and no further episodes of bacterial peritonitis were detected during 12 months. These data indicate that IFN-alpha may represent a useful tool for preventing infections in CAPD patients with relapsing bacterial peritonitis.\r"

The velocity measurements were made using a seeded blood analog fluid that matched the kinematic viscosity of blood and the refractive index of plexiglas. At each location, 250 instantaneous velocity realizations were collected at eight instances during the pump cycle. The data were filtered and averaged to calculate mean (ensemble averaged) velocities. The results indicate that the largest mean velocities are created during systole in the VADs outlet tract, and during diastole in the major orifice of the mitral valve. A single vortex centered roughly about the axis of the cylindrical portion of the pump is created during early diastole. This vortex, which persists into early systole, provides good washing of the VAD walls. However, it does appear to impede the flow entering the VAD through the minor orifice of the mitral valve. High velocities also occur during diastole along the minor orifice wall of the outlet tract and are directed into the chamber. These retrograde velocities suggest the presence of a regurgitant jet near the wall of the prosthetic valve.\r"

An external ring permits adequate interface between the cannula and the endocardial surface of the atrium. A compliant external segment on the inflow cannula, free of any spiral spring, allows adjustment of vacuum to optimal values, thus avoiding inflow obstruction. The cannula has been tested during 1 to 5 days of left ventricular bypass in calves (n = 15). A Symbion AVAD, Utah 85 VAD, or Centrimed pumps were used. Adequate heparinization was maintained throughout. Paracorporeal flow was 0.045 L min-1 kg-1. In vivo evaluation was made by hemodynamic studies and the incidence of thromboembolism. The cardiac cavities, cannulae, and peripheral vessels were carefully searched for thrombi and emboli at autopsy.

The system was implanted in three goats and a maximum pump flow of 4.2 L/min was obtained against a mean afterload of 100 mmHg, and 3.2 L/min against 130 mmHg. These evaluations have proven that the system can maintain stable hemodynamics under various conditions.\r"

The hearts were subjected to either 20 min of global ischemia (IS), with a subsequent 80 min of reperfusion under CPB, or regional IS under LHB. Instantaneous LV pressure-volume data acquisitions were repeated during transient (15 sec) acute volume loading without terminating bypass. The relationship between the stroke work (SW), determined as the area of the pressure-volume loop, and the end-diastolic volume (EDV), were highly linear at every study point (mean: r = 0.956-0.986 in Group 1, r = 0.974-0.987 in Group 2). The slopes of SW and EDV (preload recruitable stroke work: PRSW) significantly decreased after IS, in both Group 1 and Group 2. In conclusion, measurement of PRSW without terminating bypass seemed to be useful in evaluating LV systolic function in patients under AC.\r"

This acute study was conducted in three anesthetized calves (weighing 84.3 +/- 14.3 kg) to evaluate the mechanisms involved in the dissipation of heat to the lung tissue. The heaters were placed in contact with the left lung surface and skeletal muscle tissue. Compared to the muscle tissue, heat flux to the lung was approximately three times higher for the same surface temperatures. For a constant heat flux, lung interface temperature tended to vary inversely with the cardiac output and ventilatory flow. This preliminary study demonstrated that the level of heat generated by the thermal LVAS can be effectively dissipated to the lung, with the convection mechanisms of airflow and blood flow playing a major role.\r"

Pulsatile ventricular assist devices were implanted in eight anesthetized, fully hemodynamically instrumented animals. After baseline measurement of TTI, heart rate, cardiac output, mean aortic and left atrial pressures, pulsatile left atrial to aortic bypass was instituted. Measurements were then continuously recorded during both left atrial pulsatile synchronous (LAPS) and asynchronous (LAPAS) bypass periods of pumping. Heart rate and mean aortic pressure were controlled throughout the experiment. TTI = 1819 +/- 95 mmHg-sec (control); 987 +/- 127 mmHg-sec (LAPAS); and 763 +/- 89 mmHg-sec (LAPS). The results indicate TTI, and therefore MVO2, is reduced significantly from control levels by either LAPS or LAPAS bypass. However, R-wave synchronization (counterpulsation) offers no further benefit in reducing TTI over the less complex LAPAS or full-to-empty mode pumping.\r"

To compare effects of DMVA and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), 13 swine were supported by DMVA or CPB during 4 hours of ventricular fibrillation. Hearts were then rapidly excised and sectioned into right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) free wall slabs and subjected to total normothermic ischemia. Time to peak ischemic contracture (TIC) of LV endocardium (endo), LV epicardium (epi) and RV were determined using Millar needle transducers. Mean TIC was compared between DMVA (n = 6), CPB (n = 7), and control (n = 18). Significant decreases in LV endo TIC were found after DMVA (53.3 +/- 3.3 min) and CPB (56.2 +/- 2.4 min) compared with control (62.5 +/- 1.0), p less than 0.05. Myocardial blood flow was measured using microspheres during normal sinus rhythm and after 2 and 4 hr of circulatory support. Nonsignificant decreases in endo flow occurred during CPB and DMVA compared with control. LV endo adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels (mumol/g dry weight) were significantly decreased after DMVA (9.0 +/- 2.5) and CPB (4.0 +/- 2.7) compared with control (17.8 +/- 0.6), p less than 0.05. Although CPB maintained mean arterial pressure by increased pump flows (mean, 129 ml/kg/min) and LV intracavitary pressures were kept below 5 mmHg with LV venting, resulting endo flows and ATP levels were decreased. DMVA generated decreased cardiac outputs (mean, 67 ml/kg/min) under these vasodilated states, yet maintained endo flow and ATP levels as well as CPB. These experimental data show that different mechanisms of myocardial perfusion and metabolism result from CPB and DMVA.\r"

The left and right sides are alternately pumped, with concurrent filling of one pump and ejection from the other. A small hydraulic fluid chamber is used to compensate for the higher left sided flow. This chamber is incorporated into the left inflow of the TAH, with the flexing bladder in contact with atrial blood, and the hydraulic fluid communicates with the right sided hydraulic chamber. The volume of hydraulic fluid that enters and exits the latter chamber constitutes a corresponding reduction in the right sided blood chamber stroke volume. Placement of this compensation chamber in the left side inflow provides a negative feedback of the right sided flow, based on the left atrial pressure (LAP). Higher LAP (indicating too much right sided flow) leads to higher fluid flow to and from the compensation chamber and a lower right sided blood flow and vice versa. The hydraulic flow resistance can be preadjusted to yield a 15% flow difference at an LAP of 15 mmHg.\r"

Various modifications and constructive steps of the spindle pump were necessary to keep stress on blood components within adequate limits.

Finite permeability dictates the need for a means to detect the remaining air volume and a refill port for gas addition. X-ray studies were used to detect radiopaque chamber markers in cadavers. Tangential X-ray cinematography enabled detection of chamber volumes less than 100 ml and diaphragm center deflection predicted volume to within +/- 6 ml of the actual volume. An electrically driven left ventricular assist pump (90 cc) was used to evaluate motor current (MC) and intracompliance pressure (IP) as indicators of low compliance volume. Peak MC was a function of both hemodynamic output power and compliance volume. Thus, if the peak current for a given hemodynamic output is known, variances may be indicative of low compliance volumes. The cyclic minimum IP vs. volume was +1, -3, and -13 mmHg for compliance volumes of 120, 90, and 80 cc, respectively. Ejection velocity did not significantly affect IP. In conclusion, X-ray studies and MC are useful as noninvasive means of assessing the need for compliance refill. IP, though measured invasively, is the most sensitive volume-dependent parameter.\r"

In five rabbits, motion signals were picked up from the intact side by miniature strain gauges and channeled by means of an electronic circuit to electrodes placed around nerve pedicles previously implanted into the paralyzed side. An analog current produced in response to muscular contraction (afferent limb) resulted in graded and sustained contraction of the reinnervated side (efferent limb). In six animals, the tension of reinnervated strap muscles could be adjusted by varying the pulse width (0.1-10 msec) of a constant (0.5 mA) current applied to the nerve pedicles. Contraction (strain-gauge compression) of the intact face was followed by reciprocal graded relaxation of the reinnervated straps. Conversely, facial relaxation (elongation) induced graded strap contraction. An agonist-antagonist relationship was, thus, created between the two effectors. This approach may allow the paralyzed face to be electrically reanimated from the intact side in a symmetrical fashion closer to the physiologic state.\r"

Depending upon size and material, ENE tolerates anodic and cathodic impulses of up to 1 msec and 8 mA (peak current). ENEs were used during clinical application in four paraplegic patients (16 channel implants) for stimulation of lower extremities, and in nine quadruplegic patients (eight channel implants) for diaphragm pacing, for a total observation time of 37 patient years.

We eliminated the requirement for C3 by modifying the algorithm to generate a periodic solution to the equations describing C1 and C2 (2-BUN). During 156 consecutive dialyses in 37 patients there were no differences in V or G by the two methods: V = 38.3 +/- 1.3 L, G = 6.35 +/- 0.22 mg/min (2-BUN); V = 37.9 +/- 1.3 L, G = 6.08 +/- 0.23 mg/min (3-BUN). Theoretic analysis showed that transient departure from a constant protein intake produces greater errors in average G determined by the 3-BUN model than by the 2-BUN model. We compared predicted predialysis BUN values to measured predialysis BUN (mg/dl) at two days, one week and two months following the modeled dialysis. The 2-BUN method accurately predicted C3 in 156 studies: r = 0.90, mean error 6.8 +/- 6.0% (SD). Prediction of predialysis BUN at one week was less accurate for both methods: mean error 10.4 +/- 7.1% (2-BUN), 16.0 +/- 10.7% (3-BUN). At 2 months, the correlation between measured and calculated predialysis BUN fell to 0.59 (2-BUN) and 0.65 (3-BUN). Deviations from predicted BUN increased with time regardless of the model; no clear advantage of either method was seen at longer time intervals. Computer CPU time required to calculate V and G remained under 1 sec for the 2-BUN method.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Viscosity was determined pre- and postdialysis using cone-plate viscometry. Predialysis values for hematocrit and whole blood viscosity increased significantly over a 12 week period in the EPO but not the placebo treated group; plasma viscosity did not change in either group. Whole blood viscosity measured before and after a single HD session during week 12 revealed a significant rise. This change, expressed as a percent of the predialysis values, was similar in the two groups. Thus, the rise in whole blood viscosity seen in EPO treated patients is a result of the increase in erythrocyte concentration and not a result of an effect of EPO on plasma. In addition, EPO does not seem to alter the acute effect of HD on blood viscosity.\r"

This study describes a two site procedure performed at the beginning of a hemodialysis session. Blood samples are drawn from the arterial side of the hemodialysis access immediately prior to hemodialysis (AIPD), and from the same arterial line (A+5) and venous line (V+5) when maximal blood flows are reached 5 min after starting hemodialysis. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is measured in these samples, and the results entered into the formula AIPD - A+5/AIPD - V+5 X 100% to calculate the percent recirculation. Percent recirculation calculated by this method compared favorably with, and may hold several advantages over conventional techniques.\r"

  ".W": "The formula -In (R - 0.03 - UF/W), where R is the ratio of the postdialysis to predialysis plasma urea nitrogen level, UF the ultrafiltrate volume per session, and W the postdialysis weight, has been shown by us to estimate K.t/V accurately. We audited the amount of dialysis being administered in a moderate size outpatient unit in which urea kinetic modeling was not being done and in which 4 hr dialysis at a 250 or 300 ml/min blood flow rate was routinely prescribed. R was determined once per month on each of six successive months, and standard three point urea kinetic modeling was done on all patients once. R was quite reproducible in each patient, with a coefficient of variation of 6.6% +/- 3.2 standard deviation (SD). The R:UF:W-derived K.t/V averaged 0.91 +/- 0.19; the R:UF:W-derived K.t/V correlated with the modeled K.t/V (r = 0.98), with a mean percent error of only 0.12% +/- 3.6. A negative correlation (r = -0.56) was present between the R:UF:W-derived K.t/V and postdialysis weight; 9 of 40 patients had K.t/V values below 0.8 and 7 of these 9 weighed more than 85 kg. In 13 other patients, K.t/V was between 0.8 and 0.9. After inclusion of residual renal function (Kru) to calculate KT, KT was still below 0.9 in 19 patients. The main cause of underdialysis was inadequate prescription. The results suggest that monthly monitoring of R, with inclusion of UF and W to estimate K.t/V, is one useful quality assurance tool to assess the amount of dialysis being administered.\r"

  ".U": "90089165\r", 
  ".W": "Endotoxins, or fragments thereof, can reach the blood stream of dialysis patients, transported by diffusion and connection across the intact high-flux membrane. This transfer depends upon the phenomenon of back filtration. Back filtration generally occurs under conventional high-flux dialysis conditions with membranes having an ultrafiltration coefficient in blood (UF-C) above 20 ml/hr/m2/mmHg. The clinical consequences of back filtration vary from center to center depending primarily on the quality of dialysate. We therefore surveyed the bacterial and endotoxin levels of purified water and effluent dialysate in a cross section of dialysis centers in the central United States. Using a high recovery medium, we found that 53% of the centers had bacterial counts above the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instruments standard in water (20% cfu/ml) and 35% above the standard in dialysate (2,100 cfu/ml). Endotoxin concentrations higher than 5.0 EU/ml in both water and dialysate were found in 4% and 11.8% of the centers, respectively. Since high-flux membranes are believed to be of benefit for long-term dialysis patients, manufacturers will have to offer dialysate preparation systems with additional safety features. The proper membrane design will be a key to the success of such systems.\r"

TMP was applied on either the apical or basal aspect of the polarized cell layer, while the fluid compartments on both sides of the membrane were perfused with tissue culture medium in a miniature flow chamber. The cell monolayer did not allow filtration in the apical to basal direction when positive TMP up to 30 mmHg was applied on the apical side. Application of positive TMP on the basal side led to measurable ultrafiltration. The hydraulic permeability, L(p), of the cell-seeded membranes was found to be increasing with time, reaching a steady state value after 60 min. There was a strong positive correlation between L(p) and applied TMP. For a constant TMP, L(p) was found to be independent of the shear rate between 2.6 and 10.5 sec-1. When positive pressure was changed abruptly back from the basal to apical site, the ultrafiltration rate decreased to zero within seconds. Morphologic studies suggest that the tight junctions between cells were broken by TMP applied on the basolateral aspect of the cell monolayer. It is concluded that, basolateral TMP may be used to control water flux in a bioartificial kidney.\r"

If ultrafiltration is stopped, blood volume increases until equilibrium is obtained. The amount of refilling is proportional to the ultrafiltration rate [2.5%/(L/hr)]. The decrease of blood volume after re-equilibration depends upon the ultrafiltered amount and the degree of overhydration. The mean decrease of blood volume per liter of ultrafiltrate was found to be 5.5% for an average overhydration of 3 L.\r"

  ".W": "Hemodialysis patients display increased oxidative damage to red blood cell (RBC) membranes, characterized by elevated levels of malonyldialdehyde (MDA), a short chain aldehyde produced by the oxidation of the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the RBC membranes. This is the result of a metabolic blockage of the pentose-phosphate shunt in uremic patients, which causes reduced detoxification of highly oxidative free radicals. The oxidative damage induces increased RBC rigidity and decreased RBC deformability, therefore favoring hemolysis. The aim of this work was to determine if a functioning renal graft would restore normal erythrocyte metabolism, reducing the oxidative damage. To this end, we have determined RBC MDA concentrations in 20 hemodialysis (HD) patients (RBC MDA 18.22 +/- 4.36 micrograms/ml packed RBC), 20 renal transplant (T) patients with well functioning grafts (serum creatinine less than 2 mg%) (RBC MDA 1.2 +/- 0.4 micrograms/ml packed RBC) (T vs. HD P less than 0.005) and 20 healthy controls (HC) (RBC MDA 1.44 +/- 0.6 micrograms/ml packed RBC) (HC vs. HD P less than 0.005; HC vs. T NS). Our findings show that a well-functioning renal graft restores normal RBC metabolism and eliminates the oxidative damage induced by uremia.\r"

Of 265 patients who underwent orthotopic transplantation, four received mechanical support for acute perioperative donor heart failure. In two patients with reactive pulmonary hypertension, right heart bypass (RHB) with a centrifugal pump was used for 53 and 36 hr, respectively. One patient who experienced biventricular donor heart failure was supported for three days with an intraarterial, transvalvular, axial-flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD). Circulation was supported effectively with the LVAD, despite an initial absence of right ventricular function. The fourth patient, who had signs of heart failure, received intraaortic balloon pump support for 24 hr after transplantation. All four patients were weaned from circulatory support, and heart function was restored in each; the mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 63% (range from 57 to 71%). One patient died of fungal infection 14 days after being weaned from pump support, another died of lymphoma two months after support was discontinued, and the remaining two patients are well 9 and 18 months after transplantation. In cases of acute donor heart dysfunction, temporary mechanical assistance is a reliable option for supporting the circulation during heart recovery.\r"

The VAS was used in 85 adults and 7 children with acute, severe heart failure. Forty-eight patients were weaned from VAS, and 21 were long-term survivors. Heparin was not used when BF was above 2.0 L/min in an adult sized pump, and 0.8 in a pediatric one. Thrombus formation was noticed in the groove around the valve in eight cases, and in the pump in eight. Pump-originated serious complications were not seen. Hematologic and biochemical findings revealed that the VAS did not directly affect the major organs. The control-drive unit, including the automatic BF control system, functioned accurately, with less manpower, securing reliable control over the circulation. Two major causes of death were irreversible heart failure, and multiple organ failure, which resulted from delayed application. In conclusion, the NCVC-type VAS has been found effective and reliable, less thrombogenic, and requiring less manpower for its clinical use.\r"

Pneumatically driven LVADs were used on a total of 13 postoperative cases for 18 hours to 70 days (mean, 9.9 days). The RVF, which was defined as increased right atrial pressure (RAP greater than or equal to 20 mmHg) during LVAD pumping, were experienced in four cases (two ischemic, two valvular). Duration of the RVF ranged from 3 hours to 8 days (mean, 3.0 days) and the maximum RAP ranged 22-30 mmHg (mean, 27 mmHg). The effects of LVAD pumping on the RV function were delineated during serial pump on-pump off studies in two cases with RVF and three cases without RVF, in relation to off/on ratio of the systolic aortic pressure (AOP off/on), which worked as an indicative parameter of myocardial recovery. Each pair of on/off data were assigned to four groups according to AOP off/on and complication with RVF, and mean percentage changes of mRAP and PAP were compared. The RAP of RVF cases were significantly increased by 16% with the LVAD pumping when the AOP off/on was below 0.7, whereas PAP invariably decreased in most cases. The results indicated that the LVAD suppressed the RV function before the myocardial recovery and when the heart was complicated with RVF.\r"

Electron microscopic observation of transverse sections of the reconstructed vessel wall showed a four-layered structure: monolayered endothelial cells as an intima; an artificial basement membrane composed of a collagen fiber matrix complexed with dermatan sulfate; a medial composed of smooth muscle cells embedded in collagen fiber nets; and an open-cell structured microporous compliant artificial graft as a structural matrix. The tissue-engineered structure, with a complete and morphologically intact lumen covered with endothelial cells, imparts biologic function.

FHHH treated grafts contained 27 +/- 16 times more radioactivity per mm2 than IIA, Fn treated prostheses 12 +/- 8 times more, and untreated PTFE 4 +/- 3 times more. FHHH was significantly more radioactive than Fn alone (p less than or equal to 0.03). Platelet aggregation in response to either Fn or HBGF was studied in vitro. Aggregation was not activated by either Fn (1-100 micrograms/100 microliters) or HBGF (25-2,500 ng/100 microliters). These data suggest that Fn and HBGF promote platelet adhesion but not aggregation.\r"

PP was repeated two to three times per week using plasma exchange (PE) with fresh frozen plasma as a substitution fluid in all eight cases and direct hemoperfusion (DHP) in two cases. PE effectively decreased serum bilirubin and/or improved hepatic encephalopathy in six of eight patients and prolonged survival time (p less than 0.05, chi-square test). DHP was not effective. Liver failure following the resection of damaged liver differs from acute liver failure in both the condition itself and the reaction to PP. Fractionation of serum bilirubin using high performance liquid chromatography showed differences in the ratio of delta bilirubin in one survivor versus two who died and was effective in selecting a patient who would respond to PE. In conclusion, PE is effective in prolonging survival time after liver failure in hepatectomized patients compared to conventional therapy.\r"

The concentration of hepatocytes in the gel varied from 1.9 X 10(9) to 1.7 X 10(10) cells/L gel. Entrapping hepatocytes within hydrogel kept the hepatocytes viable, and results of in vitro experiments showed ammonium metabolism and urea synthesis. The results of ex vivo perfusion experiments using cats with acute hepatic insufficiency indicated that this module had the ability to replace liver function in vivo.\r"

Cryoglobulin removal from cryoglobulinemic plasma is particularly amenable to membrane filtration in the cold (cryofiltration). Temperature effects on filtration were studied in vitro using a large pore (nominal average size, 3 microns), low surface area (0.14 m2) filter. Plasmas with high concentrations of cryoprecipitable proteins (CPP; greater than 1.1 micrograms/ml) and immune complexes (IC; greater than 400 U/ml) were obtained from consenting cryoglobulinemic patients by plasma exchange. Removals of IC and CPP were highly temperature dependent, and high ratios of IC, CPP, and albumin removal were achieved (e.g., sieving coefficient [SC] = 0.05 and 0.91 for CPP, and SC = 0.94 and 0.95 for albumin at 4 degrees C and 23 degrees C, respectively). Clinically required volumes of plasma (greater than 2L) were processable. Cryofiltration with this new, high performance cryoglobulin filter is selective and may substantially reduce the clinical need for plasma replacement products.\r"

The sodium chromate induced reversible hepatic sinusoidal block with consequent portal venous congestion and stasis, which was demonstrable on histologic sections. Concurrently the ultrafiltration rate, and ultrafiltration coefficient each doubled after chromium even though the dialysate reabsorptive rate increased and the absorptive diffusion of glucose was at least as high as in control dialyses. Chromium induced significant increases in mass transfer coefficients of urea, potassium and phosphate and in protein clearance. These data suggest that splanchnic volume is an important determinant of peritoneal transfer functions and that the hepatic capillaries may contribute appreciably to transfer ordinarily ascribed to peritoneal capillaries alone.\r"

Chronic complement activation has been suggested as a cause of such phenomena, resulting from either uremia, the indwelling peritoneal catheter, and/or dialysis fluid stimulation. The presence of complement activation products in peritoneal dialysis effluent was assessed by longitudinal measurement of C3bi in eight patients over a 6 to 8 month period, while peritoneal polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) and monocyte CR3 and C5a receptor expression was quantitated by flow cytometry. In six of eight patients, C3bi levels were stable over time and usually measured less than 5 micrograms/ml. Two other patients showed periodic elevation of C3bi, which was not associated temporally with peritonitis. Further study is required to identify the origin of such activated complement components within the peritoneal cavity. However, no correlation was found between dialysate C3bi levels and peritoneal PMN or monocyte expression of CR3 or C5a receptors. Furthermore, the incidence of peritonitis for the two individuals with elevated C3bi was discordant (1 episode/8 patient months vs. 0 episodes/32 patient months), suggesting little or no relationship between these parameters.\r"

The bottom and sleeve are made into one unit with a preembedded sponge saturated with 10% povidone-iodine for disinfection and protection. Safedap was introduced to 23 patients who were observed for a period of 293 patient months. Sixteen patients used a standard spike and functioned as controls. Peritonitis rates were 1/73.3 patient months in Safedap (4 episodes in 3 patients) and 1/30.1 patient months in controls (10 episodes in 7 patients; p less than 0.05). Using life table analysis, the probability of a control being peritonitis free at 12 months was 0.63 versus 0.95 in those using Safedap (p less than 0.05). By allowing completion of bag exchanges safely and rapidly, Safedap is effective in reducing the occurrence rate of peritonitis.\r"

A simple increase in plasma oxalate levels did not cause deposits in the heart, nor did elevated values of plasma ionized calcium appear to be important in chronic renal failure. Following heterotopic cardiac transplantation, a much larger deposition of crystals was identified in the heart allograft that was histologically damaged by rejection. These findings suggest that the state of the local tissue is a very important factor in the deposition of oxalate crystals.\r"

The authors sought to reduce heparin dosage using AN-69 dialyzers at blood flows of 400 to 600 ml/min. Over a 90 day period, 2228 HDs were performed: 1531 (69%) with AN-69, 528 (24%) with regenerated cellulose (RC), and 169 (8%) with cellulose acetate (CA) dialyzers. Two hundred and eighty-three HDs were performed without systemic heparin; blood compartments were prerinsed with 2,000 U heparin in 1,000 ml of 0.9% saline. Saline flushes were used in cases of rising venous drip chamber pressures or visible clotting. Incidence of clotting overall in AN-69 HDs was 0.52% (8/1531), 2.8% (15/528) with RC, and 11.2% (19/169) with CA. In heparin-free HDs, incidence with AN-69 was 1.3% (3/230), 28.6% with RC (4/14), and 25.6% with CA (10/39). AN-69 remained less thrombogenic when HDs were stratified by blood flow rate and vascular access was used. Urea clearance was no different in conventional and heparin-free treatments. Blood flow rates of 400 ml/min or higher had an independent antithrombogenic effect. It was concluded that the combination of high blood flow with AN-69 membrane allows marked reduction of HD heparin dose and safe routine use of heparin-free HD.\r"

Helium-neon and helium-cadmium laser lights emitted from one of these optic fibers into the test solution at wavelengths of 543 and 442 nm for vitamin B12 and cytochrome-C, respectively, were caught by the other optic fiber and detected with a silicon photodiode. The solute permeability for cytochrome-C obtained by this method was almost in agreement with that for beta-2-microglobulin by the radioisotope method. This study demonstrates the usefulness of light from a laser traveling along quartz optic fibers in determining the solute permeability of hollow-fiber dialysis membranes.\r"

Such problems are minimized with the use of the Hemopump, a recently developed intraarterial LVAD. This 7 mm transvalvular axial flow blood pump is percutaneously powered by an external console with a flexible drive cable. Since April 1988, we have used the device effectively in 12 patients. Indications for device application included postcardiotomy shock in eight patients, acute allograft rejection in two, severe allograft failure in one, and acute myocardial infarction in one. The Hemopump was inserted from the femoral approach in eight patients, the ascending aorta in three, and the abdominal aorta in one. During the first 12 hr of support, cardiac index (CI) ranged from 1.14-2.98 L/min/m2, and pump flow was 3.0 to 3.6 L/min. As the patients' hearts recovered, the pump speed was gradually reduced. Circulatory support ranged from 26 to 139 hr; 10 of 12 patients were successfully weaned. The mean CI before device removal was 2.74 +/- 0.4 L/min/m2, and the pump flow was 2.14 +/- 0.69 L/min. No device-related infections or thromboembolic episodes occurred. Plasma-free hemoglobin remained within acceptable levels during pumping. Six patients survived more than 30 days after pump removal. Thus, the Hemopump can provide safe, stable, temporary circulatory support and can be expeditiously applied with minimal complications.\r"

Hemodynamic effects of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) on a HF after Fontan's procedure model, and those of a right ventricular assist device (RVAD) on right HF with pulmonary hypertension model, were investigated in acute experiments with four and five dogs, respectively. In the former, the pressure gradient across the lung and cardiac output (CO) increased with an LVAD; right atrial pressure decreased and CO increased with an RVAD in the latter. The pump was implanted as an LVAD in 8 young goats, 9-22 kg in weight, for 4-10 weeks and favorable in vivo performance was demonstrated. The VAD system was applied as an LVAD to two postcardiotomy patients, a 12 kg boy with a ventricular septal defect, and a 13 kg boy with an endocardial cushion defect. In these cases, CO was well maintained at the level of 2.5-4.1 L/min/m2 for three and seven days, respectively, and the pump was removed. In conclusion, this VAD will become a promising circulatory support system for pediatric uses.\r"

The LVAD, developed by Thermo Cardiosystems Inc. (Woburn, MA), has uniquely textured blood contacting surfaces and requires only minimal antithrombotic therapy. It has been used at the Texas Heart Institute as a bridge to transplantation in 11 patients, including 2 who are currently receiving support. Four patients required extended LVAD support (35-132 days); of those, three are doing well at 1.5, 8.5, and 13 months, respectively, after transplantation, and one died of liver failure 49 days after transplantation. The LVAD was operated in a fixed-rate mode to maintain pump flows at 4-8 L/min, resulting in stabilization of hemodynamic and secondary organ function in all patients. Blood chemistry and hematologic values returned to normal during LVAD support in three of four patients. Postoperative anticoagulation was gradually reduced over the course of the trials. The two most recent patients (35 and 132 days) received only oral dipyridamole (75 mg X 3/day) and aspirin (80 mg/day) after the early recovery period (four-six days), resulting in normal prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times. Plasma hemoglobin levels remained within acceptable limits, and there was no evidence of thromboembolism. Blood contacting surfaces were coated with a thin, adherent, biologically derived lining. The initial results indicate that the intracorporeal LVAD, with textured blood contacting surfaces, can effectively support the failing heart for extended periods (greater than 30 days) with minimal antithrombotic therapy.\r"

Of the 27 patients supported longer than 4 days, nine patients had visible thrombi. In this group of 27 patients, 19 received VAD support pending myocardial recovery, and anticoagulation consisted of dextran (4-15 days) and heparin during the weaning phase (1-2 days). The other eight patients had VADs implanted as bridges to cardiac transplantation. These patients also received dextran postoperatively (1-5 days), but were switched to a regimen of oral warfarin and dipyridamole. Duration of support for the nine patients in whom thrombi were found ranged from 4-27 days (mean, 12 days). The etiology of thrombus was probably related to mechanical problems in four patients, inadequate anticoagulation in two patients, sepsis in two patients, and unknown causes in one patient. Four of these patients suffered cerebral or peripheral injuries, which were probably embolic in two, and possibly embolic in two. One of these four patients survived, and two patients with thrombi but no emboli survived. One patient suffered a stroke, but no evidence of thrombi was found. Our incidence of thrombus with this VAD was 17%. Thrombi were related to inadequate anticoagulation, interrupted flow, or sepsis, but not to duration of support.\r"

One hundred forty (66%) of 268 patients wished for a transplant, while 71 (34%) did not wish to have one; the wish was not known in 57 (22%) of the patients. Sixty-five percent of the women and 67% of the men wanted to be transplanted. The wish for transplantation was negatively correlated with age. Thus, 78% of the patients below 50 years of age wished for a transplant, versus only 37% of those more than 70. Center patients wished more often for a transplant than patients on self dialysis (68% vs. 59%), but the difference was not significantly different except in patients over the age of 50. The chance of fulfillment (the % transplanted over the % of those who wished to have a transplant) declined with age. While 90% of the patients below age 50 who wished for a transplant could expect to receive one, only 41% of the patients over age 70 who wished for one could expect to receive one. Older patients were also less often asked about their wish. While the wish for a transplant was known in more than 90% of the patients under 50 years of age, it was known in less than one half of those over 70. This investigation shows that the wish for renal transplantation is related to age and mode of dialysis, but not sex. Old patients are often not asked about their preference for mode of treatment.\r"

The analysis showed a linear relationship between percent change in body surface (y) and fractional dialyzer (x) heat loss, such that y = -25 - 44X, p less than 0.001. Thus, when X = 0, surface heat loss decreases 25% and core temperature (T) rises, and X must equal 45% of heat production to stabilize core T during HD. A three compartment model predicts that skin clothing insulation will have to increase 2.5 times to avoid thermal discomfort when X = 45% of heat production. A theoretic mechanism for decreased symptomatic hypotension resulting from stabilization of core T is proposed.\r"

The present study was undertaken to examine this possibility in an experimental setting. Ten 5/6 nephrectomized rats were given daily subcutaneous injections of 5 mg sodium oxalate and allowed free access to saccharin sweetened water containing 2 mg/ml sodium oxalate. Six other 5/6 nephrectomized rats were controls. In addition, eight healthy rats received 10 mg sodium oxalate for 30 days. The earlier appearance and severe degree of tubular dilatation in oxalate-treated 5/6 nephrectomized compared with untreated 5/6 nephrectomized rats and the presence of renal tubular dilatation with oxalate deposits in normal rats treated with oxalate sodium are likely to be due to tubular obstruction or stenosis caused by oxalate deposition. In conclusion, oxalate deposits in the renal tubules seem to be an important factor in the formation of acquired renal cysts in chronic renal failure.\r"

Chronic uremia was induced by electrocoagulation of the right renal cortex and left nephrectomy. The mice were then fed either normal rodent chow or a saturated fat and cholesterol-enriched diet for 6 weeks. None of the A/J mice developed atherosclerosis, whereas the aortas of chow-fed uremic C57BL/6J mice were found to contain a number of fatty lesions, the severity of which was increased by a high fat diet. Uremia had different effects on serum cholesterol, triglycerides, and lipoproteins in the two strains. The results suggest that the resistance of A/J mice to uremia-induced atherosclerosis may be attributed to their ability to maintain high serum HDL-cholesterol levels and/or low serum triglyceride levels. The results further indicate that the development of atherosclerotic lesions in uremic mice is both genetically determined and affected by diet.\r"

In vivo experiments with dogs showed that the filter not only removed more than 80% of the anticoagulant activity of heparin, but also caused no clinically significant hemodynamic response. In addition, the protamine filter also significantly attenuated both the thrombocytopenic and granulocytopenic responses associated with the use of protamine. Moreover, the use of immobilized protamine considerably reduced activation of the blood complement system by free protamine.\r"

Macroaggregated albumin microspheres labeled with technetium 99m were injected through the perfusion cannula before termination of ECMO to determine percent of blood flow by measuring radioactivity from the microspheres lodged in specific organs. The control group (Group 2) consisted of three animals not on bypass; injections were made through a catheter placed in the left ventricle. Relative coronary blood flow from the perfusion cannula was significantly less than relative coronary blood flow in the control group, possibly because of cannula location. Renal flow from the perfusion cannula also was decreased. Contrary to observations in rabbits, cerebral perfusion did not decrease in the bypass group despite ligation of the carotid artery and the external jugular vein. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in the relative blood flow to other organs. The authors conclude that ECMO may significantly alter myocardial and renal perfusion, with minimal effects to other organs.\r"

In two patients, no ECMO support was used, whereas two of the remaining five patients were maintained on low flow (1.5 L/min) during the procedure and three patients were maintained with higher flows (average 3.0 L/min). All patients were removed from cardiopulmonary support with satisfactory hemodynamics and maintained on i.v. heparin for 12-48 hours. In six patients groin hematomas developed, in four deep venous thrombosis developed, and in one patient arterial occlusion after percutaneous cannulation developed. One patient died of retroperitoneal hemorrhage unrelated to the ECMO cannulation site. Six patients survived.

The logical sequence behind the molecular design of an artificial matrix that mimics natural adhesive proteins, such as fibronectin, is based on the fact that an RGD tripeptidyl amino sequence is the minimal common adhesion site of adhesive proteins. Activation of surface hydroxyl groups by carbonyl diimidazole successfully incorporated GRGDSP (Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro) onto PVA films. The resultant film surface was found to be bioactive, molecularly recognizing the adhesive receptor of bovine endothelial cells. Thus, the artificial matrix mimics active adhesion sites and serves as a novel artificial matrix that may be useful for cell culture, tissue-compatible implants, and hybrid artificial organs.\r"

  ".W": "During the development of cardiovascular devices, it is necessary to evaluate their performance in vitro under experimental conditions that closely resemble their use in vivo. Therefore, an in vitro test model was developed to evaluate the performance of cardiovascular devices with blood. The in vitro test model consists of a pneumatically driven 50 cc polyurethane ventricle with either mechanical or experimental polyurethane tricuspid semilunar valves, connected to a horseshoe-shaped blood reservoir. A sampling port permits frequent removal of blood for hematologic evaluation. All the couplings are of the quick connect type to facilitate assembly and exchange of parts. The total volume of blood in the test model is approximately 1.4 L, and experiments are conducted in the absence of an air-blood interface. Except for mechanical valves and the chosen test interface, the entire blood contacting surface consists of polyurethane. Fresh bovine heparinized blood is used for the experiments. After filling the reservoir and the ventricle with blood, the concentration of heparin is adjusted with protamine to an APTT level of three times normal (80-100 sec). Once this level of anticoagulation is achieved, the blood is circulated for the next 2-3 hr at the desired test parameters (beats/min, cardiac output, etc.). A number of hematologic parameters are monitored during the test, including APTT, PT, plasma free hemoglobin and ADP-induced platelet aggregation. With the help of this model a number of devices, including experimental polyurethane tricuspid semilunar valves, Silastic tube valves, valves with heparin coated leaflets, and small (50 cc) experimental ventricles have been studied.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In cardiovascular applications of polymeric materials, emphasis is placed on elastomers having extended flexure lifetimes (i.e., fatigue life). The effect of surface integrity on the performance properties of Biomer (Ethicon, Inc, Somerville, NJ) a segmented polyurethane used in many blood contacting devices, is being investigated using uniaxial tensile tests in air at room temperature, and biaxial fatigue tests in deionized water at body temperature. Tensile tests were done using ASTM-D-882: Standard Test Methods for Tensile Properties of Thin Plastic Sheeting. No significant differences were noted in the stress-strain curves for specimens with various surface finishes. Fatigue tests were performed using an apparatus developed to allow for the exposure of thin-sheet polymer specimens to fluid at body temperature, while being biaxially strained. Because no standard test method was available, a test protocol was developed with reference to ASTM-D-671-78: Standard Test Methods for the Flexural Fatigue of Plastics by Constant Amplitude of Force. Stress versus life cycle data for specimens with differing surface finishes are being collected. Results to date suggest fatigue life of thin flexing membranes will decrease with increasing order of surface roughness, and fatigue properties are more sensitive to effects of changes in surface integrity than tensile properties measured by monotonic loading.\r"

The authors show that its high filtration velocity (about 0.5-0.6 cm/min) is due to the presence of Taylor vortices in the blood-filled annular gap, which greatly increase the shear rates, but not radial migration of formed elements under centrifugal forces. The variation of filtrate velocity with transmembrane pressure (ptm) markedly depends upon the type of membrane. With a 0.8 micron polycarbonate membrane and bovine blood at 40% hematocrit, the filtration velocity reaches a peak equal to 0.6 cm/min at 3,000 rpm, then decreases to 80 mmHg, reaching a plateau of 0.35 cm/min independent of ptm. With a nylon membrane of 0.5 micron pores under the same conditions, the filtration velocity does not present a peak, but rises continuously to reach a 90 mmHg plateau equal to 0.5 cm/min. Similar behavior, but with lower plateaus, is also obtained with polycarbonate membranes at pore sizes below 0.4 microns. At 3,000 rpm, hemolysis occurs if ptm exceeds 750 mmHg, far above the operating range.\r"

The red blood cell membrane permeability to uric acid increased substantially during storage, whereas trends in creatinine permeability were less clear and suggested possible differences between solute efflux and influx experiments. These results provide important insights into the physical and biochemical changes that occur in the red blood cell membrane during storage and also have important implications for analyses of solute removal in hemodialysis.\r"

Marked reduction in mechanical failure for the Utah-100 TAH is attributed to progressive component redesign, material selection, and more stringent quality control criteria.\r"

There was a transient rise in total white blood cell counts and a transient fall in the hematocrit following the procedures in each group. Absolute numbers of neutrophils in the TAH group declined to near or below preoperative levels by the end of the 1 month study period. There was a transient increase in chemotactic response of isolated neutrophils to bovine C5a immediately following CPB and increased hydrogen peroxide production on postoperative day 3. Hydrogen peroxide levels were elevated in the TAH animals from postoperative day 14 to the end of the study period. Serum immunoglobulin levels of IgG, IgM, and IgA did not change significantly during the study period in the TAH group. IgG levels were elevated after week 3 in the CPB group.\r"

The possibility of microbes being introduced on the device was investigated by conducting a gross microbial assay, pre- and poststerilization, and following explant retrieval. Culture samples were obtained from the housing, base, and blood-contacting diaphragm of Utah-100 artificial ventricles. Additional samples were obtained from atrial sewing cuffs, outflow grafts, drive lines, and percutaneous leads, along with reference control samples prior to ethylene oxide sterilization (ETO). Culturing was repeated poststerilization and at device explant retrieval. Positive bacterial and fungal cultures were found in 24% of the presterilization samples; in the poststerilization samples, positive cultures were found in 6%. Following device explant retrieval, 84% of the cultures were positive. The reference control samples were positive in a limited number of the poststerilization samples. There was no correspondence of the species of micro-organisms found at the same location for each sampling condition. These data demonstrate that the surfaces of the TAH can become contaminated during fabrication. The presence of microbial activity poststerilization raises the possibility of inadequacy of the ETO protocol used with these devices, or contamination of the surgical field. Hearts at explant retrieval had cultures positive for microbes differing from those identified prior to implantation. This finding suggests that device-associated micro-organism colonization occurs through a source other than manufacturing or surgical contamination.\r"

  ".W": "By fixing the function of one ventricle, a total right heart bypass model can clarify the function and regulatory mechanism of the natural heart, and the etiology of abnormal hemodynamics in TAH animals such as increased CVP blood pressure and hepatic congestion. The pulmonary artery of a right heart bypass in a goat was clamped proximally; the pulmonary circulation was thus supplied entirely by the artificial heart and the systemic circulation by the natural heart. This model enabled studies of long-term effects of an artificial right heart on systemic circulation at a right heart output of 80-100 ml/kg/min; the response of the natural left heart to changes in output of the right heart; and the response of the natural left heart and artificial right heart to treadmill exercise. It was found that only slight increase in CVP or no increase in blood pressure was observed during the experiment (112 days); a rapid increase in output of the RAH resulted in an increase in left atrial pressure, stroke volume and output of the left ventricle, and a decrease in its heart rate at rest; and significant increase in both artificial right heart and natural left heart output and heart rates were observed during treadmill exercise, despite the marked decrease in left atrial pressure. The above results suggest that the increase in CVP and blood pressure in total artificial heart animals are not due to factors involving the artificial right heart, and that although left ventricular function acts in accordance with Starling's law at rest, this is no longer true during treadmill exercise.\r"

We present, for the first time, preliminary studies on the residence time distribution (RTD) of a ventricle as a function of type and orientation of valves (Bjork-Shiley and polyurethane valves). We constructed an open loop mock circulation system which simulates the flow and pressure through the left ventricle, and a drive triggered injection unit which can inject a chemical tracer or radioisotope during one diastolic filling phase. RTD studies were done using a Tc-99m radionuclide tracer and a chemical tracer. A scintillation camera clearly showed the influence of backflow through the artificial heart valves, and the intraventricular washout. Results indicate that 42% of the fluid elements are expelled at the end of the first ventricular beat, i.e., 58% of blood elements stayed behind to experience the second beat; 36% of blood elements expelled in the second beat belonged to those in the first diastole; 17% in the third beat; and 5% in a subsequent number of beats. The RTD was found to vary with the position of the Bjork-Shiley (BS) valves.\r"

  ".W": "The long range goal is the development of a clinically useful, implantable, skeletal muscle powered cardiac assist device (MCAD). To accomplish this goal, two criteria must be met: good anatomic fit, and antithrombogenicity. Because of the relative locations of the latissimus dorsi (LD) muscle and aorta, there are two possible port arrangements: \"crisscrossed\" (C design), in which the ports are crossed to anastomotic sites, and \"prong\" shaped (P design), in which no crossover takes place. The purpose of this paper is to determine which of these designs is best from a fluid dynamic perspective, and hence has the best possibility for low thrombogenicity. Flow visualization (FV) techniques were used during two pumping conditions in a mock loop: worst case (MCAD off) and best case (MCAD driven optimally). Results of the MCAD off tests showed that both designs required immediate actuation (for example, an IABP console). However, FV studies under optimal conditions indicated superiority of the C design, most likely due to kinetic energy-induced rotary motion combined with a minimal interport distance. It is concluded that the C design provides ideal flow dynamics, even in valveless pumps, and also has application to valved devices.\r"

  ".W": "Current circulatory assist methods, such as intra-aortic balloon pumping (IABP), are not always adequate to save acute circulatory failure patients. Therefore, a stronger, percutaneously accessible method is required. We found that the combination of IABP and CP generated a profound circulatory assist effect, and we have consequently developed a new assist system in this study. A sac type blood pump with a volume of 20 ml and a single port without a valve, was developed for CP. In the mock circulatory test, a 20 ml stroke volume was obtained using a cannula with a 5 mm diameter under the following driving conditions: air pressure = 200/-100 mmHg; S/D = 50%; pulse rate = 100 bpm. In vivo experiments were performed using four mongrel dogs with body weights of 12-20 kg. A cannula for CP was inserted via the brachial artery or subclavian artery into the aortic root. The pump flow (PF), coronary artery flow (CF), renal arterial flow (RF), and aortic pressure (AP) were measured, and the combined effects of IABP and CP were compared with their individual effects. In the most effective case, a marked increase in diastolic AP (60%), cardiac output (40%), and CF (100%) was obtained by the combination of IABP and CP, which produced a remarkable effect compared with the single use of IABP and CP. There was no negative effect on RF by this assist method. As this new circulatory support system has many circulatory assist effects, and is percutaneously accessible, it will be available for clinical use.\r"

To evaluate the clinical efficacy of transesophageal color Doppler echocardiography (TEE) in management of patients during MAC, we examined 37 pts (32, intra-aortic balloon pumping = IABP; 4, left ventricular assist device = LVAD; 1, right VAD = RVAD) by TEE. In the other 3 pts, thoracic aneurysms (AN) (2, dissecting An; 1, true AN) were detected by TEE, which were contraindications to safe introduction of IABPs. In 29 pts on IABPs, 2 pts with LVADs, and in 1 pt with a RVAD, patients were safely weaned from MACs with confirmation of full recovery of cardiac function by TEE. However, repeat introduction of IABP support was needed in 2 pts due to severe residual mitral regurgitation, even after initial success; these became the cause of late multiple organ failure. In one pt with a LVAD, a detrimental right to left shunt through the patent foramen ovale, which resulted in severe desaturation of the arterial blood oxygenation, was detected by TEE. Left main coronary flow was measured by TEE and found to increase by 55% on IABP and by 67% on a LVAD. In conclusion, TEE is the only currently available diagnostic tool for total evaluation of cardiac function in an intensive care unit, which can provide very important information for management of patients on MACs.\r"

Our experience promoted a review of the technical aspects of PCPB was needed for a successful outcome in these high-risk patients. All patients were treated with IV amnestics while awake in the catheter laboratory. Early in the experience, 20F arterial and venous cannulas were inserted via a 2 cm cutdown in the right groin; now 17F arterial and 20F venous cannulas are placed via a Seldinger technique using fluoroscopy. Traversement of the iliac vein is enhanced by a roll under the buttocks. If the artery is calcified, a cutdown, vessel loops, and direct repair are employed to assure post-PCPB patency. Total flows of 6L/min are easily achieved with nonreservoir centrifugal pump bypass. If flow or pressures fall, 200 cc of blood or crystalloid rapidly improves venous drainage and flows and unlike during reservoir bypass, alpha agonists are only rarely necessary; CaCl often produces nausea in these patients. PCWP's are brought to 0-5 mm Hg. Due to the 1,500 cc priming volume, on-pump transfusion is often required. Two patients were successfully transported to the OR on PCPB for treatment of catheter failures. With attention to technical details, percutaneous bypass supported PTCA or PV is an important new therapy for high risk patients.\r"

Understanding the anatomic constraints imposed by the abdominal viscera in LVAD placement is crucial, because improper placement can result in compression or obstruction of adjacent structures. Anatomic compatibility was assessed in four men (age 22-48 years) who were supported by the LVAD for over 1 month (range 35-132 days). The pump was intraperitoneally placed in the left upper quadrant. Radiographic techniques were employed, including CT scanning (with patients supine) and contrast imaging (patients in anatomical position), and the pump and conduits appeared to be properly positioned, with minimal compression of the body of the stomach, and no obstruction of adjacent organs. Three patients returned to a solid food diet and exercised daily by stationary cycling and walking. No signs of migration or erosion of the pump were present at the time of LVAD removal and cardiac transplantation. Successful clinical experience with short-term use of the LVAD suggests that the electrically actuated device can be well tolerated in patients requiring permanent left ventricular assistance.\r"

Multivariate regression analysis of the device parameters demonstrated that device flow, and estimated outlet pressure, were the most significant independent variables for predicting changes in motor power. Weighted least-square curvefit, using the product of these two variables, showed that changes in energy consumption can be well predicted for the ventricular assist device (r2 = 0.732). However, by applying the same model to the total artificial heart (ETAH), less favorable results were achieved (r2 = 0.422). In this model, device flow seemed to be more important in predicting energy consumption for the ETAH compared to the ELVAD. Therefore, changing the model by using flow to the third order significantly improved the fit (r2 = 0.6706) for the ETAH, and could compensate in part for the greater variability of the values and increased number of outliers in this group.\r"

The abnormal reaction of the skin to light usually occurs during the period of the systemic administration of the drug, but may with some drugs persist for longer, even for months. Chronic photosensitivity, i.e. 'persistent light reaction' of some years duration, continuing after the withdrawal of the primary cause, has so far only been reliably reported when the initial exposure of the skin to the photoactive substance has been by external contact and not following ingestion. A suggestion that photosensitivity could persist for a period of years as a sequel of initial benoxaprofen-induced photosensitivity was studied in a group of 42 subjects said to be affected in this way. The results failed to confirm the presence of persistent photosensitivity. It appeared that the probable explanation for the episodic abnormal reactions to light over the years since 1982 was the systemic administration of other photoactive drugs including a series of NSAIDs.\r"

HNK-1+ (Leu 7) cells were present in a wide range of malignant, pre-malignant and inflammatory disorders. Cells positive for the more specific NK cell antigens CD16 (Leu 11)/NKH-1 (Leu 19) had a distribution mainly restricted to cases of squamous cell carcinoma (five of nine) and keratacanthoma (three of seven). The variability in distribution between the different antibodies suggests that the majority of cutaneous HNK-1+ cells are not NK cells, but represent cross-reacting T lymphocytes. The qualitatively distinct distribution of CD16+ and NKH-1+ cells around some cases of squamous cell carcinoma and keratoacanthoma is of interest but their absence from a number of such cases calls into question a specific effector role for natural killer cells in these squamoproliferative tumours.\r"

  ".W": "Two monoclonal antibodies, K20 and 4B4, assigned to the CDw29 cluster of differentiation antigens, were shown to react with basal keratinocytes (BK). The aim of this study was to identify the antigens recognized by K20 and 4B4 on epidermal cells, and to determine whether they were identical to those found on lymphocytes. Basal keratinocyte-enriched cell suspensions were labelled with 125I and then 1% NP40 cell lysates were used for immunoprecipitation. Under reducing conditions, K20 and 4B4 immunoprecipitated from basal keratinocytes a broad MW 105,000 band and proteins of MW 145,000, 90,000 and 80,000. Under non-reducing conditions, each band was shifted down by approximately 5000 MW. Metabolic labelling studies demonstrated that the MW 145,000 and 105,000 subunits were synthesized by basal keratinocytes. On lymphoid cells, K20 and 4B4 are known to precipitate glycoprotein complexes made of a broad MW 130,000 protein band (beta subunit) associated with a protein of MW 150,000 (alpha subunit) and proteins of MW 90,000 and 80,000 expressed in very low amounts. The MW 145,000 and 105,000 bands immunoprecipitated by K20 from basal keratinocytes correspond to the alpha and beta subunits present on lymphoid cells. It has recently been demonstrated that K20 recognizes the common beta subunit of the very late antigens family (VLA) and that 4B4 defines the helper-inducer subset of T lymphocytes. The present investigation provides evidence that basal keratinocytes share antigens of the VLA family with lymphoid cells and that they play an important role in the immune response in the skin-immune system.\r"

With an increase in the severity of xerosis the SC showed a decrease in hydration and in its extractable amino acid content. There was a significant correlation between the hydration state and amino acid content of the SC. Although there was a significant correlation between the amino acid content of the lower leg SC and that of the forearm SC in the same subject, the former was generally lower, corresponding to the greater incidence of xerosis on the lower leg. These results suggest that a decreased amount of amino acids may be the result of low profilaggrin biosynthesis in the epidermis and that this is involved in the pathogenesis of these xerotic skin conditions. Clinical improvement of the xerosis following treatment with a urea-containing cream was not accompanied by any significant change in the amino acid content of the SC.\r"

Four-hundred and eight of the 492 who completed 6 months' treatment showed over 50% improvement and 247 of the 279 patients treated for a subsequent 6 months with benzoyl peroxide alone, continued to do well. Another subgroup of 174 patients, was continued for 6 months with systemic antibiotic and 5% benozyl peroxide. No significant benefit was gained, however, by maintaining successfully treated patients on a further 6 months of systemic antibiotics. Of the 84 patients who did less well, 18 were given alternative treatment (Diane, isotretinoin). The other 60, subsequently referred to as slow responders, were continued on antibiotics (erythromycin, 31; minocin, 29; cotrimoxazole, 4; trimethoprim, 2) and benzoyl peroxide. Those prescribed minocycline for the second 6 months appeared to have greater benefit (64%) than those receiving erythromycin (57%). This level of improvement was still lower than that seen in those who responded well within 6 months (78%). Of the risk factors analysed, the poorest response occurred in males with truncal acne. Age at presentation, duration and severity did not adversely affect therapeutic outcome. Side-effects were minimal.\r"

Treatment was discontinued in 33 patients (39%), due to an inadequate response or significant relapse during treatment and because of adverse reactions (19%). Four (4.7%) patients on hydroxyurea developed actinic psoriasis. Significant haematological abnormalities occurred in 30 patients (35%), but these became normal following a reduction in the dose of hydroxyurea or temporarily stopping the drug. In only six was it considered necessary to discontinue treatment because of bone marrow suppression. Our experience suggests that hydroxyurea is an effective long-term treatment for psoriasis that is refractory to conventional topical therapy and that the incidence of serious adverse effects compares favourably with other cytotoxic drugs.\r"

Comparison with data from other centres suggests that exposure to ultraviolet light is a major aetiological factor in the speed of development of skin cancer. As the incidence of new cases rose progressively with time in our patients, it would seem that skin cancer is likely to become a major clinical problem as more patients enjoy prolonged survival after renal transplantation. Preventative and screening measures should be taken by transplant units both in the UK and in other countries with similar temperate climates.\r"

In this paper 828 servicemen killed and injured by explosions in Northern Ireland have been studied, using data stored in the Hostile Action Casualty System (HACS). Because of the nature of the conflict in Northern Ireland, the magnitude of each explosion and the distance of the victims from it are quite accurately known. The overpressure (blast loading) to which the victim was exposed can be estimated from the information on the HACS forms and standard tables, giving overpressures for a given change at a known distance. Using the HACS data, the numbers of injuries due to overpressure (primary blast injury), missiles energized by the blast (secondary injury), displacement of the victim by the blast wind (tertiary injury) and flash burn can be determined. Of the 828 servicemen involved in explosions, 216 were killed, most of them before any treatment could be instituted. Of the servicemen in the survey, 90 per cent were wearing body armour. Although body armour affords considerable protection from secondary missiles, it is unlikely to reduce the number of deaths due to primary blast injury.\r"

The mean interval between primary anastomosis and false aneurysm repair was 6 years (range from 2 weeks to 16 years). Twenty-two (63 per cent) false aneurysms had occurred after previous aortobifemoral bypass grafting for occlusive aortoiliac disease. Seven (20 per cent) presented as acute surgical emergencies. Review of the records of the initial operations revealed that superficial wound infections with positive bacteriological cultures had been present in eight cases (23 per cent) and a further two (6 per cent) had lymph fistulae. Thirty-two false aneurysms were repaired, by simple reanastomosis in 14 cases, interposition grafting in 17 cases and in one case by complete revision to an aortobifemoral bypass graft. The risk of a further operative repair was less (P less than 0.05) following interposition grafting, than after simple revision. False aneurysm repairs, when compared with primary reconstructions done during the same period, were associated with more superficial wound infections (37 versus 10 per cent) and more explorations for haemorrhage within 30 days (19 versus 7 per cent).\r"

After inhalation of 24 per cent oxygen, a statistically significant (P less than 0.025) increase in chest Ptc,O2 was achieved (63(20)mmHg), but the increase in Ptc,O2 (43(19)mmHg) at the medial lower limb site was not statistically significant. Inhalation of 40 per cent oxygen resulted in significant increases at both sites (chest: 83(23)mmHg, P less than 0.01; limb: 53(26)mmHg, P less than 0.05). Ptc,O2 in the limb at this concentration of inhaled oxygen was equal to the initial chest level. Increasing the oxygen concentration to 60 per cent and then to 100 per cent produced further significant (P less than 0.001) increases in Ptc,O2 at both sites. The use of continuous oxygen inhalation during acute ischaemia may improve tissue nutrition before, during and after definitive treatment.\r"

Based on experience with 54 primary or secondary focal liver tumours, a simple morphological classification has been found to be reasonably predictive of resectability. All tumours were classified before operation using computed tomography, ultrasound and angiography; 38 patients underwent laparotomy. Dependent, 'hanging' tumours (n = 7) were resected in six cases, expansively growing 'pushing' tumours (n = 19) were resected in 18 cases, and infiltrating, 'invasive' tumours (n = 17) were not resected because of involvement with major vascular structures. Eleven small tumours (less than 5 cm) were not classifiable by this system. This simple classification may be a useful clinical concept in preoperative assessment of resectability of focal liver lesions. Hanging tumours should always be resected, and large expansile tumours are generally resectable despite their size. Invasive tumours can only be resected in exceptional cases.\r"

Thirty-five patients who had had cholecystectomy without drainage underwent 99mTc-labelled dimethylphenylcarbamoylmethyliminodiacetic acid (HIDA) and ultrasound scans the morning after surgery. Biliary leaks detected by positive HIDA scans occurred in 11 patients. Subhepatic fluid collections were seen on 20 ultrasound scans. There was no relation between biliary leaks and subhepatic collections. Many of the collections were not seen on the HIDA scan, suggesting that they contained blood and not bile. Many of the patients with bile leaks showed no fluid collection. Clinical complications were few and evenly distributed between those with positive and negative scans. We conclude that bile leaks are not an occasional event but occur after 31 per cent of undrained cholecystectomies and that these bile leaks remain clinically unimportant.\r"

The clinical course was determined in relation to patients with and without a history of previous appendicectomy. There was no difference in the incidence of previous appendicectomy between patients with carcinoma of the caecum and an age and sex matched control group. The presence of synchronous carcinomas and/or adenomas was unrelated to previous appendicectomy. Ten patients presented with appendicitis and 11 with a mucocele of the appendix as the first sign of carcinoma of the caecum. Previous appendicectomy was associated with a higher incidence of local fixity, invasion of the abdominal wall, metastatic spread and poor differentiation. These differences were reflected in a significantly lower resection rate for carcinomas in patients who had previously undergone appendicectomy. The survival of patients who had previously had appendicectomy was significantly reduced. Four independent prognostic factors for survival were identified using multivariate discriminant analysis. These were Dukes' classification, local invasion, tumour differentiation and previous appendicectomy. Local recurrence was more common in patients who had previously had appendicectomy and was often in the old appendicectomy wound itself. Appendicectomy does not increase the risk of carcinogenesis in the caecum. In this study a history of appendicectomy was an independent risk factor for survival and significantly worsened the prognosis for patients who subsequently developed carcinoma of the caecum.\r"

Furthermore, bowel frequency fell: 58 per cent had more than four bowel movements before operation compared with 19 per cent after operation. However, 60 per cent of patients still claimed urgency, 76 per cent still leaked faeces and 52 per cent continued to wear pads after the operation. Maximum resting anal pressure and maximum squeeze pressure did not change significantly after operation either in patients whose bowel control was improved or in those who were not. The results indicate that the quality of continence after postanal repair is poor.\r"

  ".W": "The surgical treatment of faecal incontinence has been traditionally divided into sphincteroplasty for sphincter disruption and postanal repair for idiopathic cases. However, many studies have failed to show a correlation between outcome and change in the anorectal angle. This study was carried out to determine the effectiveness of anterior sphincteroplasty and levatorplasty in the treatment of faecal incontinence, regardless of aetiology. Thirty consecutive patients underwent surgery, 14 with traumatic sphincter injuries and 16 with idiopathic faecal incontinence. A satisfactory clinical result was obtained in ten (71 per cent) patients in the traumatic group and in ten (62 per cent) in the idiopathic group. This was associated with a significant increase in maximum voluntary contraction pressure in the traumatic group and in those patients who had a good result in the idiopathic group (traumatic: preoperative median 80 cmH2O (range 50-115 cmH2O) versus postoperative 115 cmH2O (75-290 cmH2O), P less than 0.005; idiopathic: preoperative 105 cmH2O (45-190 cmH2O) versus postoperative 120 cmH2O (45-230 cmH2O), P less than 0.05; Wilcoxon paired signed ranks test). There was also significant improvement in anal sensation in the upper anal canal in both groups (traumatic: preoperative mean 17 mA versus postoperative 11 mA, P less than 0.05; idiopathic: preoperative 24 mA versus postoperative 9 mA, P less than 0.02). The anorectal angle increased in the idiopathic group at rest (preoperative median 105 degrees (range 86-152 degrees) versus postoperative 118 degrees (95-180 degrees), P less than 0.05). In conclusion, the type of approach (anterior or posterior) and the anorectal angle are irrelevant to the outcome of surgery for idiopathic faecal incontinence. Success appears to be related more to improved sphincter pressure and anal sensation.\r"

Of 55 patients who had a potentially curative anterior resection with follow-up of at least 2 years, one developed local recurrence. Five per cent of patients had significant continence problems. Low anterior resection for carcinoma is associated with low perioperative morbidity, satisfactory functional results and acceptable local recurrence rates.\r"

Lesions included chronic intersphincteric abscess (eight patients), anal fistula (seven patients) and chronic intersphincteric abscess and fistula (five patients). Anal fissure occurred in 15 patients, anal ulcer in three, skin tags in six, haemorrhoids in two and Kaposi's sarcoma in one. Eight patients were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody negative, four were asymptomatic HIV antibody positive, 12 had symptomatic HIV infection using the Centers for Disease Control classification and in ten patients HIV status was unknown. Irrespective of the type of surgery performed, healing occurred within 6 weeks of operation in all HIV antibody negative patients, all asymptomatic HIV antibody positive and in only one of nine patients with symptomatic HIV infection. Eight of nine patients with symptomatic HIV infection failed to heal by this time (X2 = 8.98, P less than 0.05). These findings suggest that the prevalence of anorectal sepsis in homosexual men is high and that symptomatic HIV infection is an important determinant of progress after surgery.\r"

At 6 weeks, scissor excision completely cleared the warts from 16 of 18 patients (89 per cent) compared with 15 of 19 patients (79 per cent) treated with podophyllin. Following complete clearance by surgery, two patients had recurrent warts at 18 weeks and a further single patient at 42 weeks, giving a cumulative recurrence rate of 19 per cent. In contrast, five of 15 patients whose warts were cleared by podophyllin had recurrent warts at 18 weeks and a further four at 42 weeks representing a cumulative recurrence rate of 60 per cent (X2 = 3.95, d.f. = 1, P = 0.05). At 42 weeks six patients (32 per cent) were free of disease in the podophyllin group compared with 13 (72 per cent) in the scissor excision group (X2 = 4.6, d.f. = 1, P = 0.03). Scissor excision is therefore preferable to podophyllin application in the treatment of perianal condylomata acuminata.\r"

  ".W": "Damage sustained by an ischaemic kidney is reduced by cooling the organ. For this reason kidneys are rapidly cooled during the retrieval operation and preserved at low temperature before implantation. When the kidney is removed from cold storage for implantation into the recipient it gradually rewarms (second warm ischaemic time) and a prolonged second warm ischaemic time has been shown to be a cause of acute tubular necrosis following transplantation. The temperature rise in a kidney during implantation has been poorly investigated and little work to minimize that rise has been carried out. This study investigates, in an animal model, the changes that occur in the core temperature of kidneys during the second warm ischaemic time. A jacket has been designed which greatly reduces the rate of kidney rewarming during simulated operative conditions. Kidneys unprotected by the test system showed a rapid rise in temperature from a mean of 1 degrees C to a mean of 20 degrees C after 45 min, compared with those kidneys placed in the protective jacket in which the temperature rose to a mean of only 8 degrees C in the same time. The jacket is not bulky and is simple to use. Maintaining a low kidney core temperature during the second warm ischaemic time will reduce injury to the kidney and should be part of routine clinical practice.\r"

  ".W": "In an audit of 1190 emergency admissions with abdominal pain (1166 patients) in a general surgical unit, the diagnosis was non-specific abdominal pain (NSAP) in 415 (35 per cent), acute appendicitis in 200 (17 per cent) and intestinal obstruction in 176 (15 per cent). The largest number of admissions occurred in the age groups 10-29 years (31 per cent) and 60-79 years (29 per cent). Surgical operations were performed in 551 patients (47 per cent) and there was a 16 per cent incidence of unnecessary appendicectomy (22 per cent in the age group 20-29 years). Fifty-one deaths resulted in a 30-day hospital mortality rate of 4.4 per cent and a perioperative mortality rate of 8 per cent. The mortality rate increased significantly in patients aged greater than or equal to 60 years, and patients aged 80-89 years had a perioperative mortality rate of 20 per cent. The causes of perioperative death included laparotomy for inoperable disease (28 per cent), ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (23 per cent), perforated peptic ulcer (16 per cent) and colonic resections (14 per cent). The perioperative mortality rates for ruptured aneurysm and perforated ulcer were 71 and 23 per cent respectively. The duration of inpatient stay increased significantly with the age of the patients, including those with NSAP. The results of the study indicate a need to review the methods of management of ruptured aortic aneurysm and perforated peptic ulcer, the methods of diagnosis of appendicitis, particularly in young females, and the factors that determine the duration of stay of patients suffering from NSAP.\r"

In a 7-year period, there were five patients who had documented pancreatitis out of a total of 488 renal homograft recipients, an incidence of 1 per cent. Two cases occurred in patients with an orthotopic transplant, one of them as a result of surgical injury of the pancreas and the other as a consequence of cytomegalovirus infection. The third case was an acute pancreatitis of hypercalcaemic origin, the fourth patient developed postoperative pancreatitis and acute acalculous cholecystitis, and the fifth had acute pancreatitis and sepsis associated with cytomegalovirus infection. Three patients died as a direct result of the complication. The mean incidence and mean mortality rate of post-transplantation pancreatitis, as determined from our review of the literature of the last 15 years, are 2.3 and 61.3 per cent, respectively; these are similar to the figures found up to 1970 of 1.7 and 52.2 per cent. A multiplicity of factors present in the uraemic patient may be responsible for the continued frequency of post-transplant pancreatitis despite advances in surgical technique and immunosuppressive therapy.\r"

Eleven patients died during the study period (6.7 per cent), none of the deaths being attributable to biliary tract disease. The overall incidence of retained calculus was 2.4 per cent (four patients), but no cases of retained calculi were recorded in the last 4 years of the study; in this period, with the advent of choledochoscopy and fluoroscopic cholangiography, the incidence of the supraduodenal compared with the transduodenal approach to the common bile duct increased significantly (P less than 0.001). Twenty-two of 56 patients (39 per cent) followed up for 5 years remained or became symptomatic after surgery, the majority of whom had underlying conditions unrelated to disease of the biliary or pancreatic tree. This specific follow-up clinic has been of value in the long-term audit of patients undergoing bile duct surgery for choledocholithiasis and it has verified that a change of policy from transduodenal to supraduodenal choledochotomy with preservation of the sphincter, and use of the choledochoscope and fluorocholangiography, produce better results.\r"

In type II lesions a cholecystobiliary fistula is present with erosion of less than one-third of the circumference of the bile duct. In type III lesions the fistula involves up to two-thirds of the duct circumference and in type IV lesions there is complete destruction of the bile duct. A total of 219 patients were identified with these lesions from 17,395 patients with benign biliary tract diseases undergoing surgery. The incidence of type I lesions was 11 per cent, type II 41 per cent, type III 44 per cent and type IV 4 per cent. The majority had obstructive jaundice. In type I lesions, cholecystectomy plus choledochostomy is effective. In type II lesions, suture of the fistula with absorbable material or choledochoplasty with the remnant of gallbladder can be performed. In type III lesions suture is not indicated and choledochoplasty is recommended. In type IV lesions, bilioenteric anastomosis is preferred. Operative mortality rate increases according to the severity of the lesion, as does postoperative morbidity. During cholecystectomy, partial resection is recommended in order to extract the stones, visualize the common bile duct and define the type and location of the fistula. T tubes should be placed distal to the fistula.\r"

  ".W": "Administration of a long active analogue of somatostatin, SMS 201-995 (2 micrograms subcutaneously twice a day) for 3 weeks after intraportal administration of Walker cells significantly inhibited their growth and development in the liver. This was not due to a direct cytotoxic effect of the analogue on Walker cells whose growth was stimulated in vitro. Furthermore, SMS 201-995 had no effect on the growth of Walker cells implanted into the thigh of rats suggesting that the inhibitory action of the analogue could be confined to tumour cells growing in the liver. Further studies suggested that the inhibitory effect of SMS 201-995 on the growth of Walker cells in the liver could be related to a marked stimulation of the hepatic reticuloendothelial system, by a reduction in portal venous flow in the early stages of treatment or by a combination of these effects. Further studies are required to delineate more precisely the mechanism whereby SMS 201-995 inhibits the growth of hepatic tumour derived from intraportal administration of Walker cells.\r"

Although the prognosis in these patients is unfavourable, two had a survival period of 24 and 32 months and two were still alive 27 months after contralateral groin dissection. In order to determine possible pathways of dissemination, lymphoscintigraphic studies of the leg were performed in another 16 melanoma patients who in the past had undergone a groin dissection. In 13 of them uptake in the contralateral inguinal lymph nodes was detected, indicating that groin dissection can lead to a different lymphatic flow pattern, which is often directed to the contralateral groin. Contralateral lymph node involvement may be an expression of regional disease. In such patients a contralateral groin dissection is advocated.\r"

Night evacuation was significantly reduced in the stapled group compared with a similar group of patients who had undergone S ileal pouch formation, mucosal proctectomy and manual transanal anastomosis, but this was the only parameter of function to show a difference. A stapled pouch-anal anastomosis may be superior to the conventional procedure but it still may lead to internal anal sphincter damage which cannot be due to mucosectomy or prolonged anal retraction.\r"

The group has been followed from diagnosis for a mean period of 14.9 years. The overall operation rate was 76 per cent. Prolonged spontaneous or drug induced remission occurred at all sites: right-sided disease (11 per cent), extensive colonic disease (21 per cent) and left-sided disease (38 per cent). The cumulative reoperation rates at 5 and 10 years after right hemicolectomy were 26 and 46 per cent, after colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis 46 and 60 per cent, and after panproctocolectomy 10 and 21 per cent, respectively. There was a twofold excess mortality rate from related Crohn's disease deaths during the period of review, but the mortality rate has fallen with time. There have only been 11 related deaths in the last decade, of which eight were probably unavoidable. The current status of most patients is good, although treatment has included a permanent stoma in less than half (41 per cent) the patients still under review. Currently all but 14 patients are well and symptom-free and only 16 are receiving specific medical treatment. Until the aetiology of Crohn's colitis is understood, if medical treatment has failed to resolve symptoms, appropriate surgical treatment in experienced hands is an effective way of restoring patients with chronic persistent symptoms to good health.\r"

The neoanal sphincter was fashioned from a transposed gracilis muscle and was activated electrically by an implanted stimulator. A period of chronic low frequency stimulation altered the muscle characteristics and enabled the neosphincter to contract continually without fatigue. Complete continence was achieved by the neosphincter gripping a Silastic plug inserted within the efferent spout of the pouch. The patient was able to void completely when the stimulator was switched off and the plug removed.\r"

The canal is closed by a connective tissue septum which is too weak to prevent a herniation alongside the vessels. The functional closure of the canal was investigated by artificial augmentation of the intraluminal pressure of the vein in five specimens and by computed tomographic (CT) scanning during a Valsalva manoeuvre in ten normal persons. In the abdomen the intraluminal and extraluminal pressures are raised in parallel, with no consequence for the diameter of the vessels. In the area of the lacuna vasorum the intravenous pressure is conveyed down to the first competent valve which is located 0.5 cm distal to the inguinal ligament, while the extraluminal pressure is reduced to normal. At each rise of the intra-abdominal pressure the vein will therefore bulge and exactly fill the empty space of the femoral canal thus preventing herniations by an on-demand mechanism. By CT scanning it was found that the vein in the femoral canal increased its diameter 2.5-3.0 times during the Valsalva manoeuvre.\r"

Actuarial 5-year overall survival was 75 per cent for patients with low or intermediate grade tumours, and 38 per cent for those with high grade tumours (log rank test, P less than 0.05). Five-year local recurrence rates were 32 per cent for low or intermediate grade tumours, and 48 per cent for high grade tumours (log rank test, not significant). Multivariate analysis of the following risk factors for overall survival was performed: age, sex, tumour site, diameter, grade, inadequate surgical margins and local recurrence. Age over 55 years and high tumour grade emerged as independent prognostic variables for survival. Forequarter or hindquarter amputations were undertaken in seven of the 55 patients for local recurrence following previous limb-conserving surgery and radiotherapy. Local failure was not always salvaged by major amputation; satisfactory proximal tumour clearance was achieved in only two of seven patients undergoing major amputation; four of the seven patients developed stump recurrence, three of whom died with uncontrolled local disease. Meticulous attention to surgical and radiotherapeutic technique is required to minimize the incidence of local recurrence while maintaining satisfactory limb function.\r"

Daily intraperitoneal injections of 4 mg quinidine produced a significant reduction of neurological deficits in EAN rats, whereas verapamil had no effect. In contrast, both drugs inhibited the in vitro proliferative response of regional lymph node cells to specific antigens of bovine peripheral myelin and purified protein derivative of tuberculin in a similar dose-dependent manner. Quinidine-treated EAN rats revealed considerably less inflammatory infiltration in target tissue than untreated EAN rats, shown immunohistochemically. Single injections of ion channel blockers into EAN rats did not improve nerve cell functions as measured by electrophysiological recordings of sciatic nerve. It is concluded that the dominant effect of quinidine in vivo is attributed to a reduction of the demyelinating autoimmune process. Hence ion channel blocking drugs can exert immunomodulatory effects, which may have implications for their clinical application.\r"

Three parameters often considered are the attack rate, the first interattack interval and the rate at which disability develops in the early years of the disease. We have recorded the time to reach successive levels of disability defined by the Kurtzke Disability Status Scale (DSS) in 1,099 MS patients followed at University Hospital, London, Canada between 1972 and 1984. Our population is particularly suitable because of its size, the high degree of ascertainment of cases in the community, and the regular follow-up provided. Life table analysis was used to compare survival in patients stratified according to the above three parameters using DSS 6 as end point. Significant differences were evident in the survival distributions. Despite the extensive interindividual variation in the rate at which disability developed, the early course of MS may be useful in determining the relative risk of rapid progression.\r"

The prevalence rate was 0.88 per 10(5) population, which is of the same order as in other Oriental populations but much lower than in Caucasoid populations. Comparisons with major Oriental and Caucasian series showed essentially the same clinical picture with only minor variations. In one autopsy case, the lesions were found mainly in the optic nerves and spinal cord, with marked softening in addition to the classical demyelination features. In contrast to findings in Caucasians, the detection rate of oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid was low (33% in CDMS patients) and there was no association with human leucocyte antigens. The possible implications of these findings on the pathogenesis of MS are discussed.\r"

When asked to mark the centre of a horizontal line, these patients place the mark to the right of the true midpoint. It has been considered that they neglect the left part of the line and bisect the perceived line segment. We investigated the eye-fixation patterns of hemianopic patients with or without unilateral spatial neglect during the bisection of lines, using an eye camera. Hemianopic patients without unilateral spatial neglect saw the whole lines, searching to the endpoint on the hemianopic side, and bisected it correctly. In contrast, left hemianopics with unilateral spatial neglect never searched to the left hemianopic side. Once they fixated a certain point on the right part of the line, they persisted with this point and marked the subjective midpoint there. Taking left homonymous hemianopia into account, the subjective midpoint appeared to be marked, not at the centre of the line segment perceived in the seeing right visual field, but at the leftmost point of it. However, they could appreciate the deviation of the subjective midpoint in the right visual field when forced to fixate the left endpoint of the line. These findings suggest that the left hemisphere has the ability to estimate the midpoint of the line through the right visual field and that visuospatial disorder in the line bisection test is attributable to the pathological change in the right hemisphere. The results are interpreted to mean that left hemianopic patients with unilateral spatial neglect see a totalized image of a line extending equally to either side of the point where they are going to mark the subjective midpoint. We considered that the right hemisphere completes the line, using the visual input relating to the right part of the line perceived by the left hemisphere.\r"

The present study used a nonverbal analogue of the verbal temporal ordering task to examine whether the deficit in recency discrimination of the PD patients transcended material-specific bounds or was specific to verbal material. The nonverbal task was administered to the patients with PD, patients with AD and normal control subjects studied with the verbal task. The results showed that the retention functions for the recognition of verbal and nonverbal material differed qualitatively from each other and this difference was present in all three subject groups. For verbal and nonverbal recency discrimination and verbal content recognition, performance declined with increasing retention intervals; for nonverbal content recognition, however, performance was essentially unchanging across retention intervals. As on the verbal test, recency discrimination on the nonverbal test was impaired in both patient groups. In contrast to the results with the verbal task, both groups were impaired on content recognition. The patterns of impairment, however, differed between the two patient groups in a parallel way to those of the verbal task: performance of the AD group was impaired at the longest retention intervals but not at the shortest intervals, whereas the performance of the PD group was impaired at the shortest but not at the longest intervals. This deficit in nonverbal short-term recognition memory was present even in PD patients who scored within the normal range on a quantitative test of dementia. These results show that deficits in recency discrimination and short-term memory processing in PD extend to nonverbal as well as verbal material and imply bilateral frontal lobe dysfunction in the genesis of these deficits.\r"

Knowledge of the relative conduction velocities of muscle and cutaneous afferents is important for the interpretation of reflex studies, evoked potentials and other aspects of motor control. To rectify this deficiency, the conduction velocities of the fastest muscle and cutaneous afferents were determined for the median, ulnar and tibial nerves of normal subjects. Low-threshold muscle afferents innervating abductor pollicis brevis, abductor digiti minimi and abductor hallucis were stimulated selectively through a microelectrode inserted percutaneously at the motor point. Low-threshold cutaneous afferents were stimulated with ring electrodes around the proximal phalanx of digits II or V for the upper limb and digit II for the lower limb. Compound action potentials were recorded with bipolar near-nerve electrodes at two sites in the proximal limb segment and conduction velocities of the fastest afferents in the neural volley calculated. The mean conduction velocities of the muscle and cutaneous afferents were, respectively, 74.7 +/- 6.5 m.s-1 and 80.3 +/- 6.7 m.s-1 for the median nerve, 67.5 +/- 10.2 m.s-1 and 67.5 +/- 10.5 m.s-1 for the ulnar nerve, and 54.7 +/- 3.4 m.s-1 and 52.8 +/- 3.2 m.s-1 for the tibial nerve. For upper and lower limb nerves the conduction velocities of low-threshold muscle and cutaneous afferents were not significantly different when measured over the same proximal segment.\r"

  ".U": "90090014\r", 
  ".W": "In previous studies we have shown that hemichorea can be induced in the conscious monkey by localized injection of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) antagonists into the contralateral lentiform complex. It has been argued that the primary site of drug action in inducing chorea is the lateral segment of the globus pallidus. In the present study, the neural mechanisms which underlie this experimental dyskinesia were investigated by two separate approaches. First, the efferent projections of the lentiform complex were mapped using neuroanatomical tracing techniques. This involved injecting horseradish peroxide into sites which had previously given chorea when injected with the GABA antagonist bicuculline. Secondly, the 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) metabolic mapping technique was applied to animals during active dyskinesia. This procedure permitted the autoradiographic measurement of local cerebral glucose uptake which was used as an index of regional synaptic activity. In both instances, the strongest labelling was seen in the dorsolateral region of the subthalamic nucleus. On the basis of this finding it is suggested that the pallidosubthalamic pathway plays a crucial role in the mediation of experimentally-induced chorea. Specifically, the pallidosubthalamic pathway arising from the lateral pallidal segment is abnormally overactive, which causes physiological inhibition of the subthalamic nucleus. The pattern of 2-DG uptake in the medial segment of the globus pallidus and thalamus was similar to that seen in animals with experimentally-induced ballism. This similarity is interpreted as suggesting that a common neural mechanism underlies both experimentally-induced chorea and ballism.\r"

Kanji (ideogram or morphogram) can be compared with orthographically irregular or ambiguous words in some European languages, since it is impossible to write Kanji characters unless each one of them is learned and memorized. In contrast, Kana (phonogram or syllabogram) words are comparable with orthographically regular words or nonsense words, because the Kana writing system depends on strict phonological rules (almost one-to-one correspondence between syllable and syllabogram). We conclude that 'lexical agraphia' reported in European languages can also be observed in the Japanese language where it is expressed as 'pure agraphia for Kanji'. 'Lexical agraphia' is a useful concept with general application regardless of language system.\r"

During several courses of treatment a progressive increase of the CMAPs occurred and in 5 patients a correlation between the CMAPs of the abductor pollicis brevis muscle and grasp force could be demonstrated. In 2 patients, increase in strength was correlated with shortening of the distal motor latency; no significant relationships were found between strength and conduction velocity. Different patterns in the distribution of conduction failure were observed. In 2 patients, lesions were distributed along the length of the motor fibres, whereas the sensory system was spared. In another 2 patients the lesions, most likely demyelinating, were localized distally and included the sensory system. The 4 remaining patients were more difficult to classify, but individually showed greater resemblance to one or other of the two described patterns. Different patterns of conduction failure may reflect different pathogenetic mechanisms.\r"

The effect of instructional and stimulus conditions used to elicit saccades was examined using 3 experimental paradigms. Eye movements directly elicited by a novel peripheral target were unimpaired in patients with PD as compared with control subjects. Saccades to a remembered target location, however, were dysmetric in the PD group and showed a characteristic multistepping pattern. The PD impairment was not caused by a loss of information on target location since their final eye position was close to the target at all eccentricities. Peak velocity, duration, and latency did not distinguish between PD patients and controls. These results support the view that for saccades which are not directly elicited by a visual target there is a neural pathway that can be distinguished from structures involved in the generation of visually elicited (or 'reflexive') saccades. The finding that in PD saccades to a remembered target are selectively impaired suggests that structures in the basal ganglia play a crucial role in this alternative pathway.\r"

The patient picked up and used irrelevant objects not only when place directly in front of him--the procedure developed by Lhermitte--but also when he had been instructed to carry out other tasks and his attention had not been directed to the objects. The behaviour occurred most frequently in the brief intervals between tasks, and more often when auditory-verbal rather than visuomotor tasks were being performed. The results are interpreted within an information-processing model of frontal lobe function. A differentiation is made between two forms of utilization behaviour--an 'incidental' form, as exhibited by the patient, and an 'induced' form where it occurs only when Lhermitte's procedure is adopted.\r"

  ".W": "Somatosensory and motor disturbances of hand function were examined in 9 patients with parietal lobe lesions. A quantitative score was used for the elaboration of sensorimotor profiles displaying the relative degree of functional impairment. In patients with anterior parietal lobe lesions somaesthesis was clearly more disturbed than motor function. Simple aspects of somaesthesis (surface sensibility, two-point discrimination, position sense) were disturbed to about the same degree as complex somatosensory (tactile recognition) tasks. On the other hand, patients with lesions of the posterior parietal lobe showed preferential impairment of complex somatosensory and motor functions (exploratory and manipulative finger movements). In 4 patients, analysis of motor behaviour by means of an optoelectronic system showed that reaching, formation of hand aperture and target acquisition were less disturbed than manipulative behaviour. Finger movement trajectories during dynamic digital palpation of objects were grossly deranged in the patients with posterior parietal damage. The temporal characteristics of the finger movements during active touch were completely destroyed. This leads to a breakdown of the finely tuned digital scanning process required for the sequential sampling of mechanoreceptive information. Remarkably, these patients could produce the exploratory finger movements imitatively. The motor disability of the parietal hand does not lie in the loss of the kinetic memory to perform these movements, but in the loss of their evocation by appropriate sensory stimuli. This deficit is not due to a lack of somatosensory information because that may be relatively well preserved. It is concluded that the motor disturbance in posterior parietal lobe disease lies essentially in the conception and execution of the spatiotemporal movement patterns necessary to bring those receptors into action which would normally provide the information about tactile objects. This illustrates the intricate mutual dependence of the spatiotemporal organization of receptor activation by movement and of the formation of movement trajectories on the basis of adequate sensory processing.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-three patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and 1 patient with isolated optic neuritis (mean age 37.5 yrs, average duration of disease 10 yrs) were tested with auditory and visual cognitive event-related potentials (ERPs) using an oddball paradigm. The results were compared with data from 19 age-matched healthy controls. All patients had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) head scans and 19 had comprehensive neuropsychological testing. The stimulus-related components of the ERPs were normal for nearly all patients, but 10 showed abnormalities of the later cognitive-related components and another 3 had waveforms in which the cognitive components could not be identified. These abnormalities were found mainly for the auditory test. Of these 13 patients, 11 had significantly prolonged reaction times (RT) or reduced target recognition performance. Five of 8 MS patients with normal IQ and memory function tests had abnormal ERPs with the reverse being true for 4 of 10 patients. Patients with abnormal ERPs showed a higher MRI cerebral lesion score and had a longer duration of illness and greater physical disability than patients with normal ERPs. It is concluded that the generation of ERPs is in part dependent on the integrity of cerebral white matter and that ERPs may indicate subtle degrees of cognitive dysfunction not always detected by standard tests of intellect.\r"
