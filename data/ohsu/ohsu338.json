  ".W": "The pathologic features, clinical presentation and natural history of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) developing in the noncirrhotic liver were studied in 61 patients against a background of 63 patients seen concurrently with HCC complicating cirrhosis. Noncirrhotic HCC had a bimodal age distribution, with females predominating the first age-clustering (10-50 years) and males predominating the second age-clustering (50-90 years). Cirrhotic HCC had a unimodal age distribution (40-90 years) with male dominance throughout. Estrogen exposure was noted in 57% of the noncirrhotic HCC women overall and in 80% of those in the younger age-clustering. The majority of noncirrhotic HCC presented with a single hepatic mass or a dominant primary with satellite lesions in contrast to the usual multinodular or diffuse disease seen with cirrhosis. Twenty-nine noncirrhotic patients survived complete resection of disease limited to the liver and exhibited a median survival of 2.7 years with a 5-year survival of 25%. Low histologic grade, minimal necrosis, and the absence of hemoperitoneum, hepatomegaly, and adjacent organ involvement were all favorable prognostic variable. Patients with metastatic or locally unresectable noncirrhotic HCC had a median survival of 9 months, and 24% survived in excess of 2 years. This survival experience is significantly more favorable than cirrhotic HCC patients, who had only a 1.2-month median and a 3% 2-year survival. Low histologic grade, mild mitotic activity and the presence of some fibrosis within the specimen were associated with a favorable outcome in advanced noncirrhotic HCC. The favorable prognosis and heterogeneous composition of the noncirrhotic, when compared to the cirrhotic HCC cohort, may be important considerations in the design and evaluation of future clinical trials.\r"

  ".W": "Clinical and histologic findings in 163 patients with localized soft tissue sarcoma (STS) in the extremities and trunk were reviewed. There were 91 male patients and 72 female patients ranging in age from 2 to 84 years (median, 46 years). The histologic status of the tumors was as follows: low grade, 29 cases; intermediate grade, 52 cases; and high grade, 82 cases. The primary tumors were treated by intralesional excision (two cases), marginal (88), wide local (52), or amputation (21). Subsequent adjuvant therapy was given to 61 patients; 17 had radiotherapy (RT), 27 had chemotherapy (CH), and 17 had combined RT and CH. The overall survival (P less than 0.1) and disease-free survival (P less than 0.001) were better in the group that received multimodal treatment (radical surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy) than in the group treated only by surgery. This suggests the favorable role of adjuvant therapy. The univariate and the Cox multivariate analysis for prognosis revealed that sex, tumor-related symptoms, tumor size, tumor depth, and histologic grade were the significant factors. Among the treatment schemes, adjuvant chemotherapy was the only one that affected survival, especially for the intermediate-grade tumors. Initial surgical treatment (marginal versus wide local excision) significantly contributed to the local control of the primary tumors.\r"

We investigated the extent to which the diet and cancer hypothesis was supported by data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program on multiple primary associations. Cancers of the colon/rectum and prostate in men, and those of the breast, colon/rectum, and uterine corpus in women, were hypothesized a priori to be diet-related cancers. Of the eight multiple primary associations among diet-related cancers that were possible in men and women, relative risks (RR) of a second diet-related primary cancer developing after a first diet-related primary ranged from 1.06 to 1.43. The lower bound of the 99% confidence intervals (CI) for five of these associations exceeded 1.00, and fell between 0.95 and 0.99 for the other three associations. The observed multiple primary associations were compatible with the existence of common etiologic dietary elements. However, hormonal, immunologic, and medical care factors shared by these malignancies must be considered as alternative explanations for these findings.\r"

Rhinomanometric measurements, a clinical examination of the exterior of the nose, and rhinoscopy were performed. These same examinations had been carried out preoperatively and the results recorded preoperatively. The results of the preoperative rhinomanometry were not known to the surgeon and the indication for surgery was based on clinical examination alone. At follow-up the patients also answered a questionnaire. According to the findings at rhinomanometry 52 of the 57 patients had a better airway after the operation. In 11 patients who subjectively did not consider the nasal airway to have been improved by the operation, an allergy or vasomotor rhinitis was found and in some cases the results of preoperative rhinomanometry (total nasal resistance) were normal. To measure the error of the method, a separate series of duplicate measurements was performed on 50 subjects. The standard deviation of the difference between duplicate measurements was found to be 15% of the mean value and the error of the method was considered small enough to justify rhinomanometry as a method for interindividual comparisons, provided the laboratory standard is well known.\r"

Benzalkonium chloride induced severe inflammatory changes and markedly increased the thickness measurements and meatal mitotic index. Cerumol also increased the thickness measurements and the mitotic index; there was additionally low grade chronic inflammation in the dermis. Prophylene glycol increased the mitotic index and thickness measurements though no signs of inflammation were seen. Other compounds did not produce significant changes except that hydrocortisone reduced the mitotic index. Contact dermatitis to benzalkonium chloride may be important in persistent ear disease. Cerumenolytic agents ought not to be used for prolonged periods or as prophylaxis.\r"

The protocol was applied retrospectively from the records of 64 patients with proven acoustic neuromas and found to predict correctly the presence of a tumour in 97% of cases. It is concluded that this combination of investigations constitutes an effective method of screening patients in whom an acoustic neuroma confined to the 8th nerve is suspected. The great importance of early diagnosis is that the operative mortality and morbidity is much less when the tumour removed is small.\r"

The patients' average age was 59 years (range, 25-86 years), and the average follow-up period was 2.8 years (range, two to six years). The preoperative hip score averaged 45.5 (range, 10.0-80.7) and the postoperative hip score averaged 82.5 (range, 43.0-100.0). Complications included dislocation (4.0%), infection (4.0%, one recurrence from a previously infected hip and one acute hematogenous infection), and a 4.0% revision rate for loose femoral component. Another patient had a revision for a loose acetabular component. All parameters of hip function (i.e., pain, limp, activities of daily living, use of support, and distance walked) improved with time. Femoral component loosening is classified into four types based on the severity of loosening and instability. In Type I there is minimal endosteal or inner cortical bone loss, i.e., loosening from the cement-metal-bone interface or a broken stem (seven hips). In Type II there is proximal canal enlargement with cortical thinning of 50% or more and sometimes a lateral wall defect with an intact circumferential wall (23 hips). In Type III there is a posteromedial wall defect involving the lesser trochanter (23 hips). In Type IV there is total proximal circumferential bone loss in varying distances below the lesser trochanter (three hips). The Harris hip scores for the four groups were 93.0, 83.0, 80.0, and 78.0, respectively.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with failed cemented total hip replacements develop minor to massive bone loss. In nearly all cases, the quality of the endosteal surface has been converted to a sclerotic tube. Because of the bone loss and the change in character of the remaining bone stock with which to form an interface with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), the microinterlock necessary for long-term interface stability cannot be achieved. Moreover, the first failure leads to the production of cement particles that incite a histiocytic osteolytic response. The difficulty in achieving interfacial stability in the revision setting is borne out in the published clinical results of cemented revision total hip arthroplasties showing failure rates ranging from 17% to 60.3%. Porous-surfaced prostheses have been introduced to permit biologic fixation as an alternative to cement fixation of each implant component. The good midterm clinical results and the lack of catastrophic bone loss when failure does occur have given impetus to the application of this technology to the revision situation. The preliminary clinical experience with cementless revision arthroplasty has yielded favorable results. The authors have fully developed the rationale against the use of PMMA in revision total hip replacements and for the cementless approach with porous-surfaced metal prostheses and bone grafts. The latter appear as a viable approach to a growing clinical problem.\r"

In the face of this variability, line-to-line or surface-to-surface contact is not expected between cementless implants and much of the endosteal surface. It also is apparent that changes in implant design are still needed if the normal biomechanics of the hip joint are to be restored in each patient and if component fixation is to be optimized. Most cementless components aim to achieve proximal load transfer to the femoral canal. However, increasing clinical evidence suggests that distal filling of the femur also is necessary to minimize the incidence of postoperative symptoms, particularly in revision procedures. If this is indeed the case, more accommodating designs of femoral components are needed that will enable proximal and distal fitting at the femoral canal so that stable fixation may be achieved regardless of variations in bone geometry.\r"

In practice, functionally stable total hip components rely to some extent on both macroscopic and microscopic interaction with the adjacent skeletal structures. Clearly, there is an interdependency between macroscopic and microscopic implant fixation such that they rarely occur in isolation. Both modes of implant fixation are dependent upon the materials chosen for implant construction. The materials used in implant fixation include metals, polymers, and ceramics. Implant fixation has used each of these materials in smooth, textured, and porous surface conditions. The utility of these materials for implant fixation is judged on their biocompatibility, durability, and reception to incorporation by specific tissue types.\r"

  ".W": "The host response to porous-coated prostheses appears favorable; there is little evidence of any adverse tissue response or significant osteoclastic activity except in grossly loose specimens. While the nature of retrieval specimens makes any statistical correlation problematic, some generalizations can be made. Femoral hip prostheses are most likely to present bone ingrowth along the lateral quadrant of their porous coating. The frequency of bone ingrowth of femoral components was nearly twice that of acetabular devices. Pore size, geometry, and porous-coating composition did not appear to influence the appearance of bone and fibrous tissue ingrowth. Direct bonding of bone to the uncoated portion of the prosthesis was rarely seen and occurred only in closest proximity to the porous-coated regions. Indications of pain and looseness are evidence that fibrous tissue ingrowth alone is not always sufficient to ensure stability. Additionally, some bone-ingrown prostheses were retrieved because of pain, which leads to the conclusion that local bone ingrowth cannot ensure a general freedom from pain, especially with partially coated prostheses. Bone and fibrous tissue response to the porous coatings generally consists of interdigitation, while the response to uncoated regions is fibrous tissue encapsulation. Burnishing the distal tips of many of the partially coated femoral prostheses is an indication of relative motion in that region, which may be a potential source of pain.\r"

  ".W": "As strategies are considered for improving fixation of femoral components in total hip arthroplasty (THA), one is challenged to exceed the standard set by contemporary cement procedures. However, despite the improved ten- to 15-year clinical results anticipated with current cementing techniques, the limited fatigue strength of polymethylmethacrylate warrants continued investigation of alternative systems, particularly for younger patients and in revision arthroplasty. Design considerations for femoral stems for cementless THA include (1) initial mechanical stability afforded by the stem shape, (2) strength and stiffness of the stem, and (3) surface features relating to biocompatibility and attachment to bone. In one approach a fit-and-fill algorithm has been implemented to design stems that maximize contact between prosthesis and cortex in priority areas to achieve stability. Titanium is recommended for the fabrication of such stems because of its corrosion resistance, its biocompatibility, and its modulus, which is lower than that of cobalt-chromium alloy. Long-term fixation of these implants will be dependent upon the maintenance of normal strain patterns in the host bone. Achievement of this goal will require additional strategies that combine optimal fit and optimal material properties of the prosthesis.\r"

  ".W": "The rectangular cross section of a straight-stem prosthesis makes a primary stable, rotation-safe fixation possible that is independent of the individual form of the femur. Due to the curvature of the femur, a three-dimensional large-area anchorage is achieved along the entire prosthesis length in the corticalis as well as in the spongiosa. The titanium-aluminum-niobium alloy is extremely biocompatible and enables the fast ongrowth of newly formed osseous tissue to act as secondary stabilization. Pathohistologic examinations on the prostheses of deceased patients show that this osseointegration leads to a complete osseous ingrowth of the implant. The average surface roughness of 3-5 microns, with which the entire prosthesis length is structured, supports this osseointegration. This microroughness is, therefore, totally sufficient for the primary and secondary stabilization of the implant. The osseous fixation of the prosthesis over the entire stem length guarantees a physiologic and functional load transmission to the surrounding femoral bone, thus avoiding stress shielding. The combination of a ceramic ball head with a polyethylene cup results in less wear than is the case with the customary metal-polyethylene combination and, thus, prolongs the life span of artificial hip joints. Good results in the future can only be expected in osseointegrated implants with minimal wear of the synthetic material.\r"

Application of the porous polymer coating to the metallic substrate reduces metal ion release; the polymer coating does not affect the mechanical properties of the device. Porous polytetrafluoroethylene-carbon fiber composite, (PCFC), porous polyethylene, and porous polysulfone are undergoing investigation for this application. However, the low strength of the PCFC makes its use for this application questionable. Recently reported unfavorable clinical results (i.e., a high incidence of pain) have led to the discontinuation of one trial of porous polyethylene. Clinical investigation of porous polysulfone-coated titanium alloy devices are in progress. Animal studies have shown bone ingrowth into porous polyethylene and porous polysulfone implants in cortical and cancellous bone and in canine femoral stems coated with these materials. Pull-out testing of porous polysulfone implants revealed that the strength of the porous material was higher than the strength of surrounding bone. Less cortical bone loss was found around porous polysulfone-coated canine stems than was reported for fully coated porous metallic prostheses, presumably because of the lower stiffness.\r"

A wide range of crystalline and structural forms can be constituted from reactions between calcium oxide and phosphorous pentoxide. These ceramics can be made in at least eight crystallographic forms with multiple opportunities to introduce other elements or structural defects. Microstructures and densities also can be varied to provide properties from relatively stable to completely biodegradable. One limitation has been the relatively low shear and fatigue strengths of the calcium phosphate-based ceramics. Although experimental for human orthopedic applications at this time, coatings are now in clinical trials using a range of substances, and active research is continuing on combinations of ceramics with higher strengths, cermets, and composites.\r"

  ".W": "Composite materials, which can be very strong while having a low modulus of elasticity, are being studied because such materials have potential to be made into isoelastic hip prostheses. Composites intended for medical applications incorporate carbon or polyamide as a fiber component, while polysulfone, polyetheretherketone, or polyethylene is used as a matrix component. Mechanical properties (especially the modulus of elasticity) are emphasized because of the desire to match those properties of the proximal femur. Many of the variables that affect the mechanical properties of these materials are explained. The application of stress to different fiber orientations demonstrates the mechanical properties of the composite, and this is proved mathematically. It is shown that in composites with fibers oriented in the same direction, the modulus of elasticity in the direction of the fibers generally approaches that of the fibers as the amount of matrix decreases. Perpendicular to the fibers, the modulus of elasticity of the composite is only slightly greater than that of the matrix material. For isotropic chopped-fiber composites, the modulus of elasticity approaches that of the matrix as the fiber content decreases; at high-fiber content, the modulus is significantly less than that of oriented long-fiber composites. In general, the modulus of elasticity and fiber content have a linear relationship. Composites have fatigue properties that vary with direction and approach ultimate strength in tension but are lower in compression. The fatigue properties of proposed composites are discussed. Abrasion as a cause of stress concentration sites and wear particles is considered.\r"

The implant was designed to have strength and elastic properties commensurate with the proximal canine femur. The implant geometry was such that the naturally occurring internal cancellous structures of the proximal femur would be preserved and participate in load transfer from the implant to the bone. Animals were killed at one, five, ten, 16, and 24 months. At necropsy all the femoral stems were well fixed and functioning. All implants maintained their structural integrity. Radiographs and computed tomography scans showed a constructive bone remodeling response. Histologic analysis revealed a benign host tissue response, with few inflammatory cells observed. Both bone and fibrous tissue were observed at the implant-host tissue interface. Implants fabricated from carbon/polysulfone composites have the potential for use in load-bearing applications. An implant with appropriate elastic properties provides the opportunity for the natural bone remodeling response to enhance implant stability. Naturally occurring internal cancellous structures can be utilized for load transfer by femoral components. Press-fit devices with no physical or chemical bone-bonding mechanisms can attain long-term successful functional performance.\r"

The reported European studies with cementless acetabular implants and the relatively short-term American studies suggest that loosening is not a problem with any of the designs in clinical use. This point of view is reminiscent of that regarding cemented acetabular components prior to the realization that cemented acetabular failure was a delayed long-term phenomenon. Cementless acetabular components are principally of two types, threaded and porous coated. Prior to this study, there was little clinical or experimental evidence to indicate which design gains superior fixation and which is most likely to maintain long-term fixation and durability. Fixation of threaded and porous-coated components was evaluated mechanically and histologically in dogs after weight-bearing periods of two and six months. The threaded specimens were significantly looser than the porous-coated specimens at both two and six months. There was a trend toward loosening of both types of components with time. Fibrous tissue alone appeared to invest all of the threaded components, whereas bone and fibrous-tissue ingrowth appeared to incorporate the porous components. The mineral apposition rate for the components was not significantly different between the two components or between different regions in the specimens.\r"

This study focused the wave at a composite bone-cement (polymethylmethacrylate) interface and evaluated the effects both quantitatively and qualitatively. Six matched sets of dog femora were selected. The intramedullary canals were packed uniformly with cement. One of the set was randomly selected for treatment with impulses while the other served as the control. The bone was then sectioned transversely into discs, and scanning electron microscopy and mechanical push-out studies were performed. The results indicated that the ECSWL does have a loosening effect on the bone-cement interface. Using a paired Student's t-test, the shear strength was significantly less in the treated group than in the control (p less than 0.003). Microscopically, the treated specimens revealed relative sparing of the surrounding bone. At the bone-cement interface, however, microfractures, loose bodies, and widening were seen. Revision total arthroplasty has a significant morbidity, which can be partially attributed to cement extraction. The results of this study indicate that the ECSWL may be a useful adjunct in revision surgery by facilitating the extraction of polymethylmethacrylate and thereby reducing the morbidity.\r"

Absolute indications for angiography include absent pulses, signs and symptoms of ischemia, a bruit, and a posterior knee dislocation; decreased pulses, a significant hematoma, and proximity of the fracture fragment are relative indications. Controversial issues in the management of combined orthopedic and vascular injuries include the use of internal versus external fixation, the use of prosthetic versus autogenous material, and the need for venous reconstruction. Popliteal artery trauma is still associated with a high limb loss rate, and careful evaluation of knee injuries is necessary. Vascular compromise may also complicate joint replacement surgery.

Comparable amounts of BMP/NCP alone and fibrin alone were implanted as controls. New bone yields were measured by random point analysis using a video camera and computer system and by ash weight measurement. Histologic examinations, beginning as early as three to seven days postimplantation, showed more extensive proliferation of mesenchymal cells in response to the composite than to lyophilized BMP alone. Correlated microradiographic and histologic observations showed that the composite also produced larger volumes of new bone than the BMP control group. The composite produced approximately three times more bone than BMP alone, and the difference was consistent and statistically significant. Lyophilized pellets of a composite of fibrin and BMP, prepared as volume control implants, also showed more new bone formation than the BMP alone, but the differences were less than with the wet clot composites. The relatively high yields of new bone from both wet clot and lyophilized composites suggest that the fibrin clot may perform an immunochemical function and act as a distributor of BMP. A human fibrin delivery system for BMP warrants further investigation for reconstructive orthopedic operations.\r"

The early results of a series of 75 sockets show no loss of fixation, mild to major resorption of non-contained bone graft, and favorable roentgenographic appearance of contained bone graft. In bone-grafted regions, a high percentage of lucencies at the graft-porous interface implies a lack of bone ingrowth.

Although the causes of the failed cemented total hip arthroplasty are many, they tend to follow characteristic patterns. The proximal femur can be exposed through an extensive muscle split incision, which offers a complete circumferential view of the femur. The cement removal is enhanced by controlled perforation using high-speed drills. Classification of bony deficits of the proximal femur can be divided into Type I, including intact cortex and medullary content; Type II, in which there is intact cortex but deficient medullary content; and Type III, in which deficits of both the cortex and medullary canal are present. Prosthetic selection is based on residual bone stock. In general, cementless fixation is advocated, with distal fixation using long-stem devices. Augmentation of bone deficits requires the use of segmental prosthetic replacement or fresh-frozen allografts. One hundred sixty patients were followed for two to six years. Satisfactory results have occurred in over 90% of the patients; better results are anticipated in patients with minimal bone deficits. Aseptic loosening requiring rerevision has occurred in 5% of the patient population. Understanding the dynamics of failure and the residual bone deficits allows one to manage the failed cemented total hip arthroplasty with greater efficiency and predictability.\r"

  ".W": "Intraoperative fractures of the proximal femur occurred in 40 (38 patients) of 630 (6.3%) biological ingrowth total hip arthroplasties performed between January 1984 and July 1986. Twenty-three of these fractures occurred during 131 revision arthroplasties (17.6%) and 17 during 499 primary arthroplasties (3.5%). All but two of the fractures were recognized during surgery. Thirty-seven were treated with either Parham bands or cerclage wires. Bone graft was added to the fracture site in 31 fractures. All of the fractures healed. Three of the patients failed to achieve stable fixation and have required revision surgery. An additional patient has thigh pain with 2 mm of subsidence noted with serial roentgenographs. Femoral fractures can be prevented by preoperative templating of roentgenograms containing markers to measure magnification, routine overreaming of the femoral canal when implanting long-stemmed prostheses, and prophylactically applying wires or bands to femurs requiring the removal of screws.\r"

There were 213 cases involving cemented implant failures and 71 involving cementless ones. Considered as salvage procedures, these revisions provided a satisfactory result in about 70% of the reviewed patients after five years. A biologic fixation by bony ingrowth can be expected under certain conditions from decorticated living bone, a tight mechanical fitting, and a retentive corrugated surface of the implant. A prosthetic reimplantation, safely done without cement, appears more economical for the bone stock and prevents the long-term complications related with cement. Bone grafts are often required but cannot ensure the incoming osteogenic fixation of the implant. Long-term results and complications mandate harmless extractability of the revisional implant, a forged stem, an easy exchange of the plastic liner (in a two-part acetabular component), and an updated low-friction system (high-density polyethylene wear being a potential long-term problem).\r"

Based upon promising early results in primary THA, porous-surfaced implants designed for bone ingrowth fixation are being increasingly used in hopes of more successfully achieving these goals than has been the case using cement. One hundred and sixty such revisions were followed for a mean of 4.4 years, with specific reference to implant fixation. Roentgenographic evaluation of implant fixation suggested four categories of femoral and acetabular components: (1) bone ingrown, (2) stable fibrous encapsulation, (3) questionable, with signs of impending instability, or (4) definitely unstable implant migration, indicative of the need for rerevision. Not surprisingly, success in achieving and maintaining stable implant fixation following revision THA is dependent upon component design, surgical technique, and preexistent bone stock damage. This classification according to bone stock damage should be borne in mind when critically evaluating the results from various revision series.\r"

In both the DS child and the DS adult, the cervical spine may be an area of significant potential problems. In all cases any complaints of cervical pain or historical/clinical findings suggestive of neurologic involvement should initiate evaluation of the cervical spine. Baseline radiographic studies of the cervical spine are indicated in all DS children older than 5 years of age and should be considered in all DS adults, particularly those 30 years of age and older.\r"

In prior studies, OH-DMI plasma levels were not related to response, but in these fixed-dose protocols the effects of OH-DMI are easily obscured by the higher concentrations of the parent drug. We hypothesized that in this study a contribution of OH-DMI to response might become apparent because DMI levels were relatively constant. Inpatients with nonpsychotic, unipolar DSM-III major depression who remained depressed (Hamilton score greater than 18) after 1 week of hospitalization without medication received a 4-week DMI trial. Twenty-four-hour drug plasma levels were used to adjust dose to reach a target DMI steady-state plasma level. Twenty-seven patients completed the trial. On every measure of response, total drug levels (DMI + OH-DMI) were more strongly correlated with outcome than were DMI levels alone. With multiple regression, both DMI and OH-DMI levels were independently and significantly associated with response. These findings suggest that OH-DMI has antidepressant activity.\r"

A larger clearance and volume of distribution at steady state for total and unbound oxaprozin occurred in the patients on hemodialysis. The elimination half-lives were not different. The mean total AUC, peak concentration, average steady-state plasma concentration, and trough concentration for total and unbound oxaprozin were decreased in the patients on hemodialysis. These differences are consistent with impaired absorption of oxaprozin in patients on hemodialysis. The higher dose-averaged unbound fraction of oxaprozin in plasma in patients on hemodialysis may be caused by endogenous binding inhibitors. Because clearance was not reduced in patients on hemodialysis, the dose of oxaprozin may not need to be reduced when albumin levels are normal.\r"

  ".W": "Platelet aggregation in vivo occurs through the combined effects of many agonists. Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation but its antiaggregate effects can be overcome by the synergistic action of sodium arachidonate (AA) plus platelet activating factor (PAF). We tested the effect of a calcium entry-blocking agent, diltiazem, on AA-PAF-induced platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma from seven healthy volunteers. The studies were done before and after aspirin (100 mg/day) administration for 7 to 10 days. Stimulation of platelet was done in vitro by AA, PAF, or both. Before aspirin treatment, diltiazem (2 micrograms/ml) added in vitro to the platelet-rich plasma inhibited platelet aggregation induced by AA (0.75 mmol/L) by 50%. When PAF was used the inhibition of aggregation was obtained at a lower concentration of diltiazem (0.4 to 1 microgram/ml). After aspirin treatment, AA-induced aggregation was inhibited, and PAF alone (30 nmol/L) produced a first-wave aggregation followed by complete disaggregation. When AA and PAF were added together a full aggregation of postaspirin treatment platelets was obtained. Diltiazem added in vitro at the clinically attainable concentration of 0.1 microgram/ml produced a complete inhibition of this AA-PAF synergism on platelet aggregation. These results suggest that administration of a combination of low-dose aspirin and diltiazem may be of greater benefit than aspirin alone for prophylaxis of cardiovascular diseases where platelets are involved in the pathogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Ongoing interest in the improvement of pain management with opioid analgesics had led to the investigation of sublingual opioid absorption. The present report determined the percent absorption of selected opioid analgesics from the oral cavity of normal subjects under conditions of controlled pH and swallowing when a 1.0 ml aliquot of the test drug was placed under the tongue for a 10-minute period. Compared with morphine sulfate at pH 6.5 (18% absorption), buprenorphine (55%), fentanyl (51%), and methadone (34%) were absorbed to a significantly greater extent (p less than 0.05), whereas levorphanol, hydromorphone, oxycodone, heroin, and the opioid antagonist naloxone were not. Overall, lipophilic drugs were better absorbed than were hydrophilic drugs. Plasma morphine concentration-time profiles indicate that the apparent sublingual bioavailability of morphine is only 9.0% +/- 11.9% (SD) of that after intramuscular administration. In the same subjects the estimated sublingual absorption was 22.4% +/- 9.2% (SD), indicating that the sublingual absorption method may overestimate apparent bioavailability. When the oral cavity was buffered to pH 8.5, methadone absorption was increased to 75%. Thus, an alkaline pH microenvironment that favors the unionized fraction of opioids increased sublingual drug absorption. Although absorption was found to be independent of drug concentration, it was contact time dependent for methadone and fentanyl but not for buprenorphine. These results indicate that although the sublingual absorption and apparent sublingual bioavailability of morphine are poor, the sublingual absorption of methadone, fentanyl, and buprenorphine under controlled conditions is relatively high.\r"

A preliminary assignment of an antimode for this population sample is proposed, located within the region of LMR 0.65 to 0.85 vs LMR of 1.3 for white subjects, and results in five poor metabolizers (PMs) (5.2%). This is in contrast to the absence of PMs (0/210) we have reported for the Cuna Amerindians. The microevolution of the sparteine route, corresponding to a tenfold change in the frequency of PMs, is likely to have occurred within their genetic divergence time. These observations of the divergence of a metabolic route of therapeutic importance and the proposal of a time frame for its microevolution constitute the first cases in the literature.\r"

To define the influence of severe hypoproteinaemia on kidney function, we studied the effect of an intravenous infusion of an isotonic saline load (133 mmol of sodium), as 1 litre of Ringer lactate solution, on sodium excretion and renal haemodynamics in conscious dogs before and after reduction of plasma protein from 68 +/- 3 to 36 +/- 2 g/l by repeated plasmapheresis and a low protein diet. 3. During hypoproteinaemia, 2 days after a period of plasmapheresis, glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow were lower than in the control study. After the sodium load, both rose to values nearly identical with the pre-infusion levels found in normoproteinaemia, the filtration fraction remaining unchanged. This contrasted with the rise in filtration fraction after expansion in normoproteinaemia, where filtration fraction increased from 32 to 39% due to a rise in glomerular filtration rate. 4. After expansion, natriuresis rose to similar levels in normoproteinaemia (0.18 +/- 0.06 mmol/min) and hypoproteinaemia (0.20 +/- 0.06 mmol/min), and increments in fractional excretion of sodium, potassium and chloride were also similar. However, baseline excretion was higher in the hypoproteinaemic dogs due to their overhydrated condition in this period immediately after plasmapheresis. 5. The fractional excretion of lithium, an alleged marker of proximal tubular sodium reabsorption, rose to comparable levels. 6. Hence, both the increase in filtration and decrease in reabsorption of sodium after an isotonic saline load are not affected by severe reduction in plasma protein concentration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "1. The activity of alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT; EC 2.6.1.44) has been measured in the unfractionated livers of 20 patients with primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1), three patients with other forms of primary hyperoxaluria and one PH1 heterozygote. The subcellular distribution of AGT activity was examined in four of the PH1 livers and in the liver of the PH1 heterozygote. 2. The mean AGT activity in the unfractionated PH1 livers was 12.6% of the mean control value. The activities of other aminotransferases and the peroxisomal marker enzymes were normal. When corrected for cross-over from glutamate:glyoxylate aminotransferase (GGT; EC 2.6.1.4), the mean AGT activity in the PH1 livers was reduced to 3.3% of the control values. 3. The livers from a patient with primary hyperoxaluria type 2 (D-glycerate dehydrogenase deficiency) and one with an undefined form of primary hyperoxaluria (possibly oxalate hyperabsorption) had normal AGT levels. The livers of a very mild PH1-type variant and a PH1 heterozygote had intermediate levels of AGT activity. 4. Subcellular fractionation of four PH1 livers by sucrose gradient isopycnic centrifugation demonstrated a complete absence of peroxisomal AGT activity. The subcellular distribution of the residual AGT activity was very similar to that of GGT activity (i.e. mainly cytosolic with a small amount mitochondrial). There were no alterations in the subcellular distributions of any of the peroxisomal marker enzymes. The subcellular distribution of AGT activity in the PH1 heterozygote liver was similar to that of the control (i.e. mainly peroxisomal).\r"

  ".W": "1. In order to explain the vulnerability of medullary thick ascending limb of Henle's loop (mTAL) during hypoxia, adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) content was measured in isolated rat mTAL cells during control conditions and chemically induced hypoxia and compared with those in medullary collecting duct (MCD) cells. 2. Basal ATP levels in mTAL and MCD were estimated as 3.6 and 2.1 mmol/l, respectively. Antimycin A (5 mumol/l) decreased the ATP content by 41% of the control value in the mTAL cells, but failed to reduce that of the MCD cells. Administration of sodium cyanide (5 mmol/l) drastically depleted ATP in the mTAL cells within 5 min (2-3% of control). On the other hand, ATP levels in MCD cells were sustained for at least 60 min after cyanide administration (64% of control). 3. When tubules were made permeable to sodium by the addition of nystatin, the effects of chemical hypoxia on the cell ATP levels were intensified in both segments, and this was partially blocked by pretreatment with ouabain, or by lowering the sodium concentration of the medium. 4. Higher doses of nystatin in mTAL caused a reduction in ATP levels even under control conditions, but its effect was prevented in low sodium medium. 5. The present study suggests that cell ATP levels can be altered by sodium, potassium-dependent adenosine triphosphatase activity, and that due to their high sodium-transporting activity, mTAL cells are more sensitive to reductions in ATP levels during hypoxia than are MCD cells.\r"

The test material elicited moderate to severe irritation when diluted in mineral oil to concentrations of 15-25% and minimal irritation at concentrations of 1-3%. Both tests clearly indicated that 3,4,5-trichloropyridazine was a contact sensitizer to guinea pigs, although the response was stronger in the maximization test.

The patients, 4 men and 1 woman, were 24-52 years old when examined. They had been working in dye houses or textile plants, and had been exposed to reactive dyes for 8 months to 4 years before symptoms developed. Only 1 of the patients has been able to continue in the same occupation. On patch testing, the 4 patients with eczema reacted positively to 9 commercial dye powders. 2 patients reacted to the same dye, Remazol Schwarz B. On scratch and/or prick testing, the 2 patients who also had respiratory symptoms and/or urticaria reacted positively to the same dyes as on patch testing. The 5th patient, who had urticaria and respiratory symptoms, reacted positively to a dye, Remazol Gold Gelb RNL, but the patch test with that dye was negative. None of the patients was patch-test-positive to para-phenylenediamine (PPD) or to textile dye allergens in a series of organic dyes. Thus, the series of organic dyes has little value in the screening of allergy to reactive dyes. A 1% pet. dilution of commercial dye powder for patch testing and the same concentration in distilled water for prick testing seem to be suitable for the screening of allergy to reactive dyes.\r"

  ".W": "Prevalence of gestational diabetes was investigated in 693 pregnant patients between the 24th and 28th wk of gestation. A glucose screening test (GST) was performed with a 50-g glucose load, followed by a blood sample 1 h later. Patients with glucose levels greater than 140 mg/dl 1 h after the GST were scheduled for a full oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). One hundred seven patients had an abnormal GST, and 30 patients (4.3%) were diagnosed as having gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The percentage of GDM increased significantly when glucose levels were greater than 180 mg/dl to a maximum of 84.61% when glucose levels were greater than 200 mg/dl. Also, patient age was directly related to GDM, which increased in incidence to 20% when patients greater than 26 yr had an abnormal GST. After delivery, newborn weights were compared between those born to mothers with GDM (n = 30) and those born to mothers with an abnormal GST (n = 77). Patients with an abnormal GST and normal OGTT had 12 (15.58%) macrosomic and 2 premature newborns. However, patients with GDM had 5 (16.66%) macrosomic and no premature newborns. Patients with a normal GST had 7.33% of the macrosomic newborns. There was no perinatal mortality in newborns of GDM mothers; only 1 of the 5 macrosomic newborns presented transient hypoglycemia. Evaluation of 26 GDM patients was possible after delivery, disclosing 3 (11.53%) with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and 5 (19.23%) with impaired glucose tolerance. These results showed 4.3% undetected GDM in our population and no differences in the proportion of macrosomic newborns between those born to mothers with GDM and those born to mothers with an abnormal GST.\r"

Fructosamine results showed a trimodal frequency distribution, with cutting points corresponding to 5th and 95th percentile values. Forty-two diabetic individuals had levels that exceeded the 95th percentile. These individuals had more severe metabolic abnormalities, characterized by lower plasma C-peptide and elevated fasting plasma glucose concentrations. Mean fructosamine values also showed a significant increase with age and a highly significant age-ethnic interaction that paralleled the higher frequency of diabetes in older age groups and among elderly Maori people. However, as a screening method in the general population, fructosamine measurement was diagnostically deficient because of a weak correlation with serum albumin. Arithmetic correction for albumin concentration in the sample did not increase the diagnostic usefulness of the test.\r"

The study was based on a common protocol, standardized examination procedures, and centralized laboratory methods. Patients were chosen from a pool of diabetic Swiss with diabetes greater than or equal to 1 yr. After selection, the participants were classified into groups according to age at diabetes onset (greater than 30 or less than 30 yr) and insulin treatment status. Several variables thought to be related to retinopathy incidence were analyzed at the initial examinations: onset of diabetes before age 30, duration of disease, fasting plasma glucose, blood pressure, and insulin therapy. Follow-up examination of 358 of 458 survivors, with a diabetes duration that averaged 20 yr, showed retinopathy significantly and independently associated with initial fasting plasma glucose, systolic blood pressure, and insulin use but not with diabetes duration. Lower rates of retinopathy development were observed during the follow-up period in diabetic patients on antihypertensive therapy at the baseline examination, suggesting that not only lower fasting plasma glucose and systolic blood pressure levels but also blood pressure therapy itself decreases the incidence of retinopathy.\r"

Data are presented documenting that glucose intolerance is also a risk factor for total mortality, as well as for cancer and cardiovascular morality. The Kaunas-Rotterdam Intervention Study, which documented glucose tolerance and mortality in a cohort of men, shows a linear increase in total mortality with increasing blood glucose levels. By use of multiple logistic regressions, glucose was shown to be a significant risk factor (c = .2534, t = 4.0) for total mortality. A paradigm is presented in which diabetes is placed as a disease and glucose intolerance as a risk factor within the total scheme for the development of noncommunicable diseases. The WHO action plan for integrated programs in noncommunicable diseases is discussed. The program expands on the experience gained by WHO investigators in community programs and proposes a cooperative effort globally in community-based programming.\r"

There is increasing evidence that these diseases are a consequence of life-style change, and they have a number of risk factors in common. Primary prevention of both insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and NIDDM has become increasingly important because of their significant morbidity and mortality and the human and economic costs associated with diabetes and its complications. Prevention of the two major forms of diabetes, IDDM and NIDDM, are quite separate issues. The former appears to be an autoimmune disorder, whereas the latter should be considered along with other life-style-related noncommunicable diseases. The primary prevention of NIDDM appears to offer the greatest promise of success. The uncertainty that still exists as to the role of obesity and other risk factors in the development of NIDDM gives support to a multiple-risk-factor intervention approach (through a healthy life-style strategy) for NIDDM prevention.\r"

The results showed that the educational program had reached greater than or equal to 1 staff member in 86% of the 104 primary health-care centers (PHCCs). Several organizational changes had taken place as a result of the program. The 10 \"best\" PHCCs were compared with a random sample of the centers with regard to patient outcomes. Patients from the 10 best centers had gotten a more comprehensive education, were more knowledgeable about foot care, tested glucose more often, and used less medication. The metabolic control was the same for both groups of patients. The PHCC staffs reported the following roadblocks to change: lack of knowledge of diabetes care, insufficient cooperation between staff members, poor contact with specialists, and absence of guidelines for diabetes care. The staffs in the best centers spent twice as much time in staff meetings and continuing education as those from the random sample of centers. The findings led us to formulate a new strategy for the program. The main objective of the new approach is to create organizational changes within the centers. Thus, local knowledge and creativity can be utilized. Preliminary data demonstrate that 84% of the locally developed plans for reorganization of diabetes care had been accomplished within 1 yr.\r"

  ".W": "The National Diabetes Advisory Board recommends that diabetes prevention and control programs focus on the preventable complications of diabetes, i.e., visual impairment, lower-extremity problems, renal problems, ketoacidosis, and adverse outcomes of pregnancy. The Florida Diabetes Control Program chose to focus its efforts on the first three of these complications at the federal- and state-funded primary-care programs in Florida because these programs had access to targeted, public-sector patients and because of fiscal restraints that make the care provider the logical source of entry to the health-care system. This study sought to document the current level of care for complications of diabetes in primary-care settings, provide state-of-the-art professional education along with patient education, and evaluate changes in practice habits. Three intervention and three control primary-care centers were selected. Medical records in each center were reviewed over a 2-yr period. At intervention sites, retinopathy referrals increased from 9 to 43% (P less than .001), urinalyses increased from 69 to 94% (P less than .001), and examinations of lower extremities increased from 66 to 94% (P less than .001). There were no such changes in the control sites. Hypertension was diagnosed in nearly two-thirds of patients, and a last blood pressure of greater than 140 mmHg systolic or greater than 90 mmHg diastolic was present in 64% of the intervention group at yr 1 and declined to 56% at yr 2 (P less than .05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Efforts to standardize criteria and methods for evaluating these programs are relatively recent. Without such standardization, evaluation of the impact of many programs and comparisons among programs have not been possible. We review the suitability of available data sources for monitoring adverse outcomes of pregnancy in women with diabetes in light of epidemiological considerations relevant to selection of indicators of program impact. This article is intended to be a resource to help evaluate in a standardized fashion the impact of programs at a regional, state, or local level. We conclude that primary data (information collected by programs themselves) collected in a standardized manner are necessary for evaluation of programs for diabetes in pregnancy. Secondary data sources alone are of limited value for monitoring outcomes because of underreporting of maternal diabetes, especially in the absence of identified complications. Ultimately, the ability to rigorously assess the impact of efforts to improve outcomes of diabetes in pregnancy may depend on the creation of comprehensive statewide systems to identify women of childbearing age who have diabetes.\r"

Thus, patients could theoretically measure their blood glucose and mail their reacted test strips to their physicians for reanalysis. To test the stability of reacted Chemstrip bG blood glucose measurements, 268 Chemstrip bG test strips were reacted with blood obtained from 67 insulin-dependent diabetic patients, stored in desiccator vials, and read daily for 5 consecutive days with an Accu-Chek II blood glucose meter. Although Chemstrip bG blood glucose values significantly correlated with initial reference Beckman glucose analyzer glucose determinations for all 5 days, a steady significant decay in blood glucose readings over time was observed, and clinically accurate strip readings declined from 94% to 68%. Because this decay appeared consistent, correction factors were calculated with regression analyses. The correction factor for day 5 Accu-Chek II readings reduced measurement error by 77%. When applied to a different validation sample, this correction factor decreased day 5 error by 73%. Hence, it seems that correction factors may be applied to delayed readings of Chemstrips obtained with Accu-Chek II that would correct for the observed reduction in blood glucose readings. From these results, we conclude that delayed readings of Chemstrip bG test strips with the Accu-Chek II are not sufficiently accurate for clinical decision making or research purposes unless mathematically corrected.\r"

The products were compared on a milligram-equivalent (adjusted) basis. Following completion of blood sampling, patients were crossed-over to the alternate product. There was no washout between treatments. After nine doses of the alternate test medications, blood sampling was repeated. Differences in AUCSS, CSSav, CSSmax, tmax, and intradose peak/trough ratios were not statistically significant. Within-group variability in AUCSS, CSSav CSSmax, and tmax was greater with product B, but this trend did not reach statistical significance. Antiarrhythmic efficacy was not significantly different between the two treatments. Although the greater bioequivalence, lesser variability, and the greater number of tablet dosage sizes would favor product A, patients stabilized on a particular brand of sustained-release procainamide should not be switched to another product without careful monitoring. One patient in this study developed nonsustained ventricular tachycardia with low procainamide plasma concentrations after being switched from product A to product B.\r"

We surveyed 135 emergency department nursing directors across the country to assess the methods of and persons responsible for documentation during CPR. Ninety-five (70 percent) completed surveys were returned, showing that documentations was usually done by a nurse (81 percent), by a nurse and pharmacist (9 percent), by a pharmacist (7 percent), or by others (ward clerks, paramedics, or physicians) (3 percent). CPR flowsheets (83 percent), nurses' notes (7 percent), or other methods (10 percent) including notes on paper towels and blackboards are used to record such information in the emergency department. Most respondents were fairly confident (49 percent) or very confident (48 percent) that they could recreate the resuscitative sequence from the information recorded; 2 percent did not have confidence in the reproducibility of the data. Respondents felt that cardiac rhythms (83 percent), drugs and dosages administered (34 percent), and temporal sequence of events (33 percent) could be more accurately recorded during CPR. A majority of respondents (57 percent) felt that an automated recording system would be useful. We conclude that there appears to be considerable variability in the method of documentation of events during CPR in emergency departments throughout the country. Future efforts in emergency care should include the involvement of pharmacists in the development and implementation of a uniform database for use by field and hospital personnel during CPR.\r"

The preferred method I involves directly calculating variances from the rows and columns of the tabular data, where the rows are repetitive treatments in the same subject and the mean variance represents intrasubject variance; a column represents different subjects' results on a given treatment and the mean of the column variances represents intersubject variance. Problems in attempting to use components of variance are discussed. Intrasubject coefficients of variation of digoxin renal clearance averaged 23.8 percent by method I and ranged from 15.2 to 28.6 percent.

The only apparent clinical complication of endotracheal drug administration was transient coughing. The addition of endotracheal aminoglycosides to intravenous antibiotics may be useful in pediatric patients with unresponsive (or other difficult-to-treat) pneumonitis caused by resistant microorganisms. The potential contribution of endotracheal aminoglycosides to the serum level and/or disposition profile must be recognized, and therapeutic drug monitoring guided accordingly when this route of administration is used.\r"

One liter of only cimetidine HCl 1200 mg in D5W and one liter of only aminophylline 500 mg in D5W served as controls. Samples drawn from the five admixtures and immediately frozen were analyzed for cimetidine and theophylline content at times 0, 1, 6, 24, and 48 hours using high-performance liquid chromatography. Chemical stability of each drug was assessed relative to its time-zero concentration. Samples were also drawn from each test and control solution at every time interval to assess the pH. Admixtures were stored at room temperature out of direct sunlight for the duration of the study, and were visually inspected for color change, turbidity, cloudiness, and precipitation. Recovery of cimetidine and theophylline at all test intervals, pH assessments, and visual inspections of the admixtures showed that cimetidine HCl and aminophylline are both chemically stable and physically compatible for 48 hours at room temperature in one liter of D5W.\r"

Fifty percent (15 of 30) of serum drug levels measured were subtherapeutic; the remaining levels were in the normal therapeutic range. Based on this sample data, it could be concluded that a minimum of 32 percent and as many as 68 percent of serum drug levels would be subtherapeutic following drug analysis in similar nursing home populations. Of 12 consultations, recommendations for seven (58 percent) were accepted by the subject's primary care physicians. Four of the consultations (33 percent) resulted in dosage modifications.

Approximately one half of the institutions reported a peak therapeutic range of 30-40 mg/L at 30 minutes following end of infusion. A great majority of institutions were consistent in recommended trough range, with 48 of 55 reporting 5-10 mg/L. Although there is some consistency among at least half of the hospitals, there is a great deal of variability among the other half in peak monitoring guidelines.\r"

The process of manuscript evaluation by an editor-selected reviewer (\"peers\" or \"referees\") is termed \"peer review.\" One issue involving the peer-review process is the use of blind versus nonblind referees. The purpose of this survey was to determine the percentage of a select group of medicine-related journals that blind their reviewers. We surveyed 114 English language journals. Journal editors were sent a survey that asked two questions: (1) are the referees who review your manuscripts blinded to the identity of the authors? and (2) is the editor blinded to the identity of the authors until after the review of the manuscripts is complete? Ninety-six of 114 (84.2 percent) surveys were returned. Ten journals published invited manuscripts only and were excluded from the survey. Only 18.6 percent (16 of 86) of the journals currently blind referees. None of the journals' editors were blind to the identity of the manuscripts' authors.\r"

Recent reports have emphasized that the standard regimens of 2.5 mg/kg q8-12h produce steady-state trough serum concentrations greater than 2 micrograms/ml in up to 91 percent of preterm infants of less than 35 weeks' gestation. A new dosing schedule based on postconceptional age (PCA) was developed to provide a better guideline for initiating and maintaining gentamicin therapy in neonates: PCA greater than 34 weeks, 2.5 mg/kg iv q12h; PCA 28-34 weeks, 2.5 mg/kg iv q16h; PCA less than 28 weeks, 2.5 mg/kg iv q24h. The new dosing schedule reduced the number of neonates with elevated trough concentrations (greater than 2 micrograms/ml) from 68.4 percent to 33-40 percent. Pharmacokinetic parameters for gentamicin in the various PCA groups were determined. Volume of distribution was constant across age groups (0.5 +/- 0.09 L/kg). Elimination rate constants (kel), half-lives, and clearance rates (Cl) ranged from 0.069 +/- 0.02 to 0.14 +/- 0.04 h-1, 10.71 +/- 2.92 to 6.04 +/- 1.24 h, and 0.58 +/- 0.25 to 0.93 +/- 0.24 ml/kg/min, respectively. Significant relationships were found between kel and Cl and patient age and weight; significant correlations were found between actual and estimated (based on PCA and weight) kel and Cl. Variability in kel and Cl estimated was considerable in spite of the correlations. The observed variability stresses again the need for pharmacokinetic monitoring of gentamicin therapy in neonates.\r"

The pHi of these cells was measured in acidic medium (pH 6.5) using the equilibrium distribution of 14C-labeled 5,5'-dimethyl-oxazolidine-2,4-dione. The estimated pHi in 10 separate experiments was 7.30 +/- 0.01 (mean +/- SE). The pHi declined to 6.87 +/- 0.02 when equimolar concentrations of choline+ replaced Na+ in the incubation medium, but was restored when cells were placed in a medium containing 50 mM Na+. The necessity for external Na+ to maintain pHi, when cells are exposed to acidic solutions, is consistent with a Na+/H+ antiport system in these cells. This is further supported by the observation that pHi decreased to 6.70 +/- 0.01 when amiloride, an inhibitor of Na+/H+ exchange, was added, and that this agent prevented the recovery of pHi in Na+-depleted cells after addition of Na+ to the medium. This report also provides additional information concerning the relationship between H+ and I- uptake and suggests that there are two I- transport systems: one that is Na+-dependent, 4,4'-diisothiocyano 2,2'-disulfonic acid stilbene-sensitive, and not associated with intracellular acidification, and the other operative at an external pH of 6.5 and associated with intracellular acidification.\r"

In addition, the effects of DEX on the structural development of the fetal lung tissue was investigated using morphometric techniques. We observed that DEX had a biphasic effect on the accumulation of SP-A and its mRNA; at concentrations of 10(-10) and 10(-9) M, a stimulatory effect was observed, while at concentrations of 10(-8) M or greater, the glucocorticoid was markedly inhibitory. The inhibitory effect of DEX (10(-7) M) was evident at all time points of incubation and was apparent within 24 h of its addition to the medium at any time during the culture period. In addition, DEX (10(-7) M) antagonized the stimulatory effects of (Bu)2cAMP on the accumulation of SP-A and its mRNA. DEX also had pronounced effects on the morphological development of human fetal lung tissue. At a concentration of 10(-7) M or greater, DEX caused a marked reduction of alveolar lumen size compared to that of fetal lung explants maintained in control medium. A biphasic effect of DEX on the volume density of type II cells in fetal lung explants was observed; at a concentration of 10(-10) M, DEX significantly increased the volume density of type II cells, whereas at a concentration of 10(-7) M or more, the glucocorticoid significantly reduced the volume density of type II cells compared to that of control explants. These findings suggest that synthetic glucocorticoids at concentrations of 10(-10) and 10(-9) M are stimulatory whereas elevated levels are inhibitory of SP-A synthesis and morphological development of the human fetal lung.\r"

To help determine the physiological significance of this structural variant of PRL, we have measured glycosylated PRL (G-PRL) in the plasma of growing pigs from birth to 1 yr of age. An immunoblotting method developed originally for human plasma was used. With some modifications, the method could detect G-PRL in as little as 0.2 ml porcine plasma. Concanavalin-A affinity chromatography confirmed the glycoprotein nature of the plasma G-PRL band. Quantitative estimates of the immunoblotting results revealed marked differences with age in the secretion of the two monomeric forms of PRL. G-PRL concentrations averaged 138% higher than those of non-G-PRL between birth and 2 months of age, but lower thereafter. Chronologically, both forms displayed similar patterns between birth and 2 months, the concentration remaining unchanged or decreasing slightly. After 2 months, however, concentrations of non-G-PRL increased markedly; the increase was characterized by great fluctuations. G-PRL concentrations, on the other hand, increased only moderately, but the increase was consistent until the end of the study period. The results demonstrate the circulating nature of G-PRL in the pig and suggest that the variant may play a physiological role in the growth and development of the animal.\r"

Immature rats were treated with four daily sc injections of 100 micrograms hydroxytamoxifen [TAM(OH)], 5 micrograms estradiol (E2), or oil. On day 5 the rats were injected iv with 1 microgram of the synthetic progestin [3H]Org 2058, and 1 h later uteri were excised, weighed, and processed for thaw-mount autoradiography. Treatment with TAM(OH) or E2 resulted in uterine weight gain, which was greater in animals treated with E2. E2 treatment resulted in cellular hypertrophy in all tissue compartments, especially in the luminal epithelium and myometrium, but TAM(OH) treatment resulted in hypertrophy of only the luminal epithelium. Treatment with TAM(OH) or E2 changed the pattern and intensity of nuclear binding of [3H]Org 2058 from that in oil-treated controls. E2 increased progestin binding in stroma and myometrium and decreased it in luminal epithelium. TAM(OH), similarly, decreased progestin binding in the luminal epithelium and increased it, albeit less than E2, in the myometrium, but left it unchanged in the stroma. The results indicate that E2 and TAM(OH) differentially effect progestin binding among the uterine tissue compartments.\r"

ACTH secretion increased to 142.2% of the control value after 2 days of salt loading, but decreased to 73.4% of the control levels after 4 days. After 9 days, ACTH secretion was still low; however, by 12 days, plasma ACTH levels in salt-loaded mice were not significantly different from control levels. POMC mRNA levels in the anterior lobe increased to 205.0% of the control value after 2 days of salt loading, continued to be high after 4 days, but returned to control levels by 9 days. However, POMC biosynthesis was not altered under these conditions during the entire period of salt loading. Thus, POMC mRNA levels and biosynthesis were modulated differently in the intermediate and anterior lobes of the mouse pituitary gland during salt loading.\r"

  ".W": "Estrogen binding was compared in cell nuclear KCl extracts from microdissected brain regions of gonadectomized-adrenalectomized male and female rats treated with a near-saturating dose of 17 beta-estradiol. Injection of 3.6 or 36.0 micrograms 17 beta-estradiol/kg BW, iv, 1 h before death resulted in a higher level of estrogen binding in the periventricular preoptic area (PVPOA), medial preoptic area, and ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMN) of the female than in comparable tissue samples from the male. No significant sex differences in nuclear estrogen binding were observed in the arcuate-median eminence region, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, or corticomedial amygdala. Scatchard analysis of saturation binding data revealed that the sex differences in cell nuclear estrogen binding in the PVPOA, medial preoptic area, and VMN reflect a difference in binding capacity rather than binding affinity. These in vitro biochemical findings were confirmed by autoradiographic studies. Gonadectomized-adrenalectomized animals were injected with 125I-labeled 11 beta-methoxy-16 alpha-iodoestradiol (2.0 micrograms/kg BW). Thin frozen sections (10 microns) through the preoptic area and hypothalamus were thaw-mounted onto microscope slides, then exposed against LKB Ultrofilm for 21 days. The autoradiographic images exhibited similar silver distributions and densities in males and females in the arcuate-median eminence region bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and amygdala. However, 11 beta-[125I]methoxy-16 alpha-iodoestradiol uptake was lower in males than in females in the PVPOA and VMN. These results suggest that sex differences in responsiveness to estrogen stimulation in the rat may be due in part to sex differences in estrogen-binding capacity in specific regions of the hypothalamus that play important roles in the control of pituitary function and reproductive behaviors.\r"

  ".W": "Recent reports have suggested that the action of calcitriol is much more rapid than previously thought. It is thus possible that some actions do not depend on de novo protein synthesis. A precise microdensitometric technique has been used to characterize the time course of the intestinal brush border alkaline phosphatase (AP) response of rat duodenal villi to the administration of calcitriol as AP activity has been shown to be dependent on the vitamin D status of the animal. The technique enables AP activity to be determined in situ without tissue disruption. After ip administration of 200 ng calcitriol to vitamin D-deficient male Wistar AF rats, a biphasic AP response was observed with an early peak within 1 h (0.068 +/- 0.011 vs. 0.101 +/- 0.003 integrated extinction (IE) min.micron 3 X 10(3), P less than 0.05) and a second at between 6 and 8 h (0.088 +/- 0.005 vs. 0.172 +/- 0.003 IE/min.micron 3 X 10(3), P less than 0.001). In a further experiment, the early response to calcitriol was reexamined with observations at 0, 10, 30, 45, and 60 min after administration of either calcitriol or vehicle (n = 5 pairs per time point). AP activity was significantly increased in the calcitriol group compared with the vehicle-treated group as early as 10 min after administration (0.132 +/- 0.003 vs. 0.151 +/- 0.005 IE/min.micron 3 X 10(3), P less than 0.02) and reached a peak 45 min after administration at which time AP activity was equal to that found in normal vitamin D-replete animals (0.193 +/- 0.003 vs. 0.192 +/- 0.002 IE/min.micron (3) X 10(3), P greater than 0.5). The speed of this response indicates it to be unlikely to depend on de novo protein synthesis.\r"

Autoradiography of photoaffinity-labeled M2R membrane protein, after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, revealed the specific labeling of two separate bands with an apparent molecular mass of 43 and 46 kilodaltons, respectively. Photoaffinity labeling of both bands was of near-equal intensity and could be inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, by the addition of unlabeled beta-MSH before photolysis. In addition, agents known to inhibit the binding of beta-MSH to its cellular receptor, such as EGTA, GTP, guanosine 5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate, and a synthetic analog of the calmodulin-binding domain of myosin light chain kinase-M5, were all found to specifically inhibit the labeling of these two protein bands by the azido derivative of [125I]iodo-beta-MSH. In contrast, addition of a nonrelated peptide, vasoactive intestinal peptide, had no effect upon the labeling of these melanotropin-binding proteins. On the basis of these results we suggest that the two proteins may function as the binding domain(s) of the cellular receptor for melanotropins, or may represent entire receptor moieties themselves.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the mechanism by which T3 in plasma enters hepatic cells, we measured rate constants for the uptake of unbound (free) T3 by the perfused rat liver, for the hepatic uptake of T3 from serum, and for the spontaneous dissociation of T3 from its plasma binding proteins. Quantitative autoradiography of liver lobules after perfusion with [125I]T3 in protein-free buffer indicated a high apparent rate constant for removal of T3 from the sinusoids; its minimum estimate was 2.4 +/- 0.2 sec-1. The single pass extraction of T3 in human serum by the perfused rat liver was 31.6 +/- 4.5% at the supraphysiological flow rate of 3 ml/min/g liver (sinusoidal transit time, approximately 3 sec). Sixty percent of the T3 in this serum dissociated spontaneously from its binding proteins in 3 sec, as determined by a rapid filtration assay. Based on these data, we conclude that the pool of free T3 in plasma turns over very rapidly in vivo and probably accounts for the entire hepatic uptake of T3 from plasma. Using additional data on the rate constant for cellular metabolism of T3 obtained from values reported in the literature, a previously published general mathematical model of ligand transport was applied to all of these data, yielding the following conclusions for the physiological state. 1) Metabolism, not uptake, is rate limiting to removal of T3 from plasma by the liver. 2) Intracellular T3 is in virtual equilibrium with the free T3 pool in plasma. 3) Intracellular T3 concentrations reflect the concentration of free T3 in plasma, as predicted by the free hormone hypothesis. It is shown mathematically that these conclusions are independent of whether a gradient exists between extra- and intracellular T3 concentrations, and that they would still hold even if the tissue uptake of T3 occurred by a mechanism that acted directly on the plasma protein-bound pool of T3.\r"

In this study, we have examined the effects of glucose on the protooncogene expressioN and cell growth using a clonal strain of RIN cell, RINr, under serum-free and glucose-free conditions. After 24 h pretreatment, cells were treated with different concentrations of glucose for up to 24 h and then subjected to RNA analysis. Agarose gel electrophoresis of total RNA extracts of RINr cells, followed by hybridization with v-myc DNA yielded a 2.4 kilobase c-myc messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts. After 24 h pretreatment with serum-free and glucose-free medium, RINr cells expressed a low level of c-myc mRNA transcripts. An increase in c-myc transcripts was detectable within 30 min of D-glucose (200 mg/dl) addition, reaching a maximum of 10-fold within 2 h. Glucose stimulated the steady state of c-myc mRNA transcripts in a dose-responsive manner without any change of gamma-actin mRNA levels after 2 h of treatment. The level of c-myc transcripts then declined as the cells proceeded through G1 to the cycle. [3H]Thymidine uptake into DNA was dramatically increased after 24 h of glucose addition, suggesting that glucose itself stimulates DNA synthesis in RINr cells. These results indicate that glucose-induced proliferation of RINr cells is associated with the stimulation of c-myc gene expression.\r"

  ".W": "Calmodulin is a substrate for the insulin receptor kinase. The time sequence of events resulting in insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of calmodulin was analyzed at a number of different insulin concentrations using partially purified solubilized insulin receptor preparations from rat adipocytes. The respective insulin concentrations needed to reach half-maximal binding, phosphorylation of the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor, and phosphorylation of calmodulin were 4.5 X 10(-10), 4.3 X 10(-10), and 3.9 X 10(-10) M, respectively. At all insulin concentrations, the time to reach 50% of the maximum (defined as the value obtained at 60 min) occurred in the sequence: insulin binding less than beta-subunit phosphorylation less than calmodulin phosphorylation. Insulin binding and beta-subunit phosphorylation occurred almost immediately, whereas there was a lag phase preceding calmodulin phosphorylation. Although stoichiometry was generally low under routine assay conditions (0.01-0.10 mol phosphate/mol calmodulin), it could be increased 4.3 +/- 0.5-fold (n = 5) by pretreating the calmodulin with 0.1 N NaOH. Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of calmodulin was exclusively on tyrosine residues. The calmodulin molecule in animals contains only two tyrosine residues, located at positions 99 and 138. The amount of phosphate incorporation into a semisynthetic calmodulin (VU1) which contains only one of these tyrosine residues (tyrosine-138) was half that obtained with porcine or chicken calmodulin. Therefore, insulin, via its receptor kinase, stimulates the phosphorylation of calmodulin; calmodulin can be phosphorylated on both tyrosine residues 99 and 138.\r"

Time courses for in vitro autophosphorylation were determined, and times to reach half-maximal (t1/2 max) and maximal (tmax) 32P incorporation were compared. Insulin receptors from rat muscle, liver, and fat had a t1/2 max of 7-10 min and a tmax of 60 min; human-derived insulin receptors had a t1/2 max in excess of 30 min and a tmax of 120 min. A spectrum of autophosphorylation time courses was present in human tissues; placenta-derived receptors exhibited a t1/2 max of 13 min while receptors from monocytes and fibroblasts had t1/2 max values of 60 and 80 min, respectively. The ATP Km for autophosphorylation of human-derived receptors was 5-fold greater than that of rat-derived receptors (266 +/- 27 vs. 48 +/- 8 microM, respectively). In contrast, when the receptors were first maximally prephosphorylated, the ATP Km values for substrate phosphorylation of human- and rat-derived receptors were equivalent (12.5 and 11.4 microM). Kact values for Mn were comparable in both human- and rat-derived adipocyte receptors. In addition to the functional differences between species, the apparent mol wt of the beta-subunit of rat-derived receptors (96,000) was consistently greater than that of human-derived receptor beta-subunits (93,000). In contrast to these in vitro findings, the ability of insulin to stimulate receptor kinase activity in isolated adipocytes was rapid, with a maximal effect by seconds. This was comparable for both rat and human tissues, suggesting that the in vitro autophosphorylation differences may not govern kinase activity in vivo.\r"

The Ka values obtained ranged between 2.4 x 10(6) and 1.0 x 10(10) for intact hLH and between 2.3 x 10(6) and 7.5 x 10(8) liters/M for the free alpha- and beta-subunits, indicating that, in general, the antibodies showed higher avidity for the intact hormone. Six MAB recognized both the intact and free alpha-subunit of hLH, cross-reacted with intact hCG, hFSH, and hTSH, and thus appeared to be alpha-directed. Four MAB were beta-directed, recognizing both intact hLH and its free beta-subunit. One of these beta-directed MABs also cross-reacted with intact hCG, hFSH, and hTSH, while two others recognized both intact and free beta-subunits of hLH and hCG. The fourth beta-directed MAB was quite specific for intact hLH and its beta-subunit. The remaining four MABs recognized epitopes only on the intact hormone; three recognized intact hLH and hCG, and the fourth was specific for intact hLH. Their paratopic relationships tested in competitive binding studies resulted in either mutual competition or complementarity, sometimes with cooperativity. Biointerference, defined as the ability to inhibit hLH-induced testosterone biosynthesis in dispersed rat Leydig cells, indicated that three of the alpha- and one of the beta-directed antibodies neutralized the biological response of hLH in this bioassay in a dose-responsive manner. Their ability to inhibit hLH bioactivity largely paralleled their affinity constants. Our data have allowed us to establish a tentative topographic relationship of epitopes to the biological region of the molecule of hLH, foreshadowing (in additive binding studies) some of the possible combinations of antibodies that might allow us to design two- or multiple-site immunometric assays in which measurement of immunoactive LH reflects biological activity. In addition, these studies suggest that both the alpha- and beta-subunits participate in LH receptor binding and/or biological activity.\r"

Southern blot analysis of InR1-G9 DNA demonstrated that glucagon gene sequences are not amplified, yet appear to be hypomethylated compared to hamster liver or kidney DNA. Northern blot analysis of RNA from InR1-G9 cells detected a single glucagon mRNA species of 1300 basepairs. Phorbol esters and sodium butyrate, agents that increase glucagon gene transcription in RIN1056A cells, have no effect on glucagon mRNA levels in InR1-G9 cells. Posttranslational processing of proglucagon, as analyzed by gel filtration chromatography and RIA, resulted in the liberation of glucagon, glucagon-like peptide I, and glucagon-like peptide II, partially mimicking the processing of proglucagon in pancreas and intestine, yet differing from that previously observed in RIN1056A cells. Secretion of glucagon and the glucagon-like peptides was stimulated 3-fold after 1-h incubations with phorbol esters. These observations suggest that the determinants of glucagon gene expression and the posttranslational processing of proglucagon are highly cell specific and provide a new model for the study of proglucagon biosynthesis.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies from our laboratory indicate that high density lipoproteins (HDL) and apolipoproteins-AI, -AII, and -CI stimulate the release of human placental lactogen (hPL) from human placental explants and trophoblast cells. However, the intracellular mechanisms by which HDL stimulate hPL release are unknown. Since earlier investigations from our laboratory indicated that pharmacological agents that increase intracellular cAMP levels [such as (Bu)2cAMP, isobutylmethylxanthine, and cholera toxin] also stimulate hPL release, we have performed studies to determine whether the stimulation of hPL release by HDL may be mediated by cAMP. Exposure of an enriched fraction of enzymatically dispersed hPL-producing cells to HDL (10-1500 micrograms/ml) for 0.5 h resulted in a significant dose-dependent stimulation of both cAMP production and hPL release. The half-maximal effective HDL dose for cAMP production and hPL release was 60-100 micrograms/ml. When perifused trophoblast cells were exposed to HDL (150 micrograms/ml) for 25 min, the increase in cAMP production preceded the increase in hPL release. The increase in cAMP production occurred during the first 5 min of exposure to HDL and reached a maximum (12.1 +/- 1.6-fold greater than base-line levels) 10 min after exposure. The increase in hPL release occurred about 10 min after the initial increase in cAMP production, reaching a maximum (9.7 +/- 1.4-fold greater than base-line levels) 15 min after exposure to HDL. HDL (300 micrograms/ml) also stimulated a 2.7-fold (P less than 0.001) increase in adenylate cyclase activity in placental plasma membranes, a magnitude of stimulation comparable to that caused by epinephrine (1 mM). Apolipoprotein-AII stimulated cAMP formation and hPL release in trophoblast cells with a pattern identical to that of HDL. These results, the first to demonstrate an effect of HDL on adenylate cyclase activity and cAMP production, strongly suggest a role for cAMP as a second messenger in HDL-stimulated hPL release.\r"

  ".W": "Ketoconazole and RU 486 are both antagonists of glucocorticoid hormone action at the target cell level. Both inhibit the binding of agonists to the receptor, although RU 486 is many-fold more potent. As reported here, ketoconazole, like all naturally occurring steroidal antiglucocorticoids, enhances the rate at which agonists dissociate from the glucocorticoid receptor. This indicates that this antiglucocorticoid interacts with the receptor at a site other than the agonist-binding site. RU 486, on the other hand, does not accelerate dissociation, suggesting that it does not interact with the putative allosteric regulatory site on the glucocorticoid receptor. Combining these findings with previous reports leads to the hypothesis that glucocorticoid antagonists can be divided into two classes: those that act through a second regulatory site on the glucocorticoid receptor and those that act by direct competition with agonists at the agonist-binding site.\r"

  ".U": "88328942\r", 
  ".W": "We have characterized the insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGF-BP) produced by neonatal human skin fibroblasts in monolayer culture using antibodies specific for the acid-stable subunit of the 150K GH-dependent IGF-BP complex, BP-53, and the amniotic fluid IGF-BP, BP-28. Fibroblasts produced 65.3 +/- 10.4 ng/ml.72 h (SE; n = 6) immunoreactive BP-53 in serum-free medium; this was stimulated by increasing fetal bovine serum in the medium up to 385.3 +/- 49.0 ng/ml.72 h at 10% serum. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) also caused dose-dependent stimulation of BP-53 production, with a maximal effect (3-fold increase) at 30 ng/ml EGF. No immunoreactive BP-28 production was detectable in the presence or absence of serum or EGF. Neutral gel chromatography of serum-free medium revealed a peak of immunoreactive BP-53 at about 50K, with a smaller species at 20-30 K. Serum- and EGF-stimulated cells produced higher levels of about 50K BP-53, and an additional peak of immunoreactivity at 150K was present in serum-stimulated, but not EGF-stimulated, samples. Comparison of IGF-I and IGF-II binding by fibroblast BP-53 revealed slightly higher IGF-II than IGF-I binding, and association constants of 3-4 x 10(10) liter/mol for both IGFs, similar to BP-53 from human plasma. Affinity labeling of acid-stripped medium followed by nonreduced sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed specifically cross-linked IGF-binding species of 60K (identical to labeled plasma BP-53), 42K, and 37K. Only the 60K and 42K complexes were precipitable by antiserum to plasma BP-53, and none was precipitable by anti-BP-28 serum, suggesting that the 37K band might represent a third class of IGF-BP. We conclude that neonatal skin fibroblasts produce no BP-28, but do produce two IGF-BPs immunologically homologous to human plasma BP-53, one of which shows size and IGF-binding characteristics identical to the plasma protein.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of thyroid hormone on the levels of protein inhibitors for Ca2+-dependent proteinase were studied in rat brain. Four different inhibitory proteins (I, II, III, and IV) were isolated from immature (7-day-old) rat brain. The molecular weights of these inhibitory proteins, which were estimated by gel-exclusion chromatography on Sephacryl S-200 column, were approximately 280,000 (I), 70,000 (II), 50,000 (III), and 35,000 (IV). All of these inhibitory proteins were decreased by thyroidectomy. Four-day T4 administration (100 micrograms/kg daily) to thyroidectomized-immature animals restored proteins I, II, and IV. However, protein III was not recovered with the same treatment of the rats. In mature rats (40-day-old), four different inhibitory proteins were identified in the brain. The molecular weights were identical to those obtained in immature rat brain. As observed in immature rats, all of these inhibitory proteins were decreased by thyroidectomy. In contrast to the results obtained in immature animals, however, inhibitory protein III, as well as I, II, and IV, was restored by T4 administration (100 micrograms/kg daily) to thyroidectomized mature rats. The results suggested that thyroid hormone increases protein inhibitors for Ca2+-dependent proteinase in brain, and that irreversible decrease in one of the inhibitors is induced by thyroid hormone deficiency in immature animals. The phenomenon may be related to the neonatal hypothyroidism-induced irreversible damage to the central nervous system in patients with cretinism.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of short term (1-month) and life-long 60% ad libitum food restriction on the adrenocortical response to restraint stress were compared in young and aged Fischer 344 rats. In rats restricted for 1 month (study 1), the adrenocortical response differed as a function of age. In 8-month-old animals, the initial steep rise in corticosterone in response to stress was of similar magnitude in ad libitum and restricted animals. In 23-month-old animals the corticosterone response was severely blunted in restricted animals. In life-long restricted animals (study 2), the corticosterone response to restraint stress was tested at 8, 16, and 24 months of age. The general pattern of response to stress in these animals was similar to that in study 1. The 16- and 24-month-old animals showed the same blunted response to stress found in the 23-month-old animals restricted for only 1 month, suggesting that the severe restriction per se and not life-long food restriction blunted the response to stress in aged animals. The similarity between the response to stress in study 1 and study 2 was evident even though animals were tested in one case before feeding when corticosterone levels were high, and in the other 4-5 h after feeding when corticosterone levels were lower. In study 3 it was found that in food-restricted young rats, the mean corticosterone level over a 24-h period was significantly elevated above that in ad libitum fed young rats. In aged rats, however, except before daily feeding, corticosterone levels of food-restricted rats remained significantly below those of ad libitum fed animals, whose levels were, in turn, significantly elevated compared to those of ad libitum fed young rats. These findings suggest that in aged animals severe food restriction reduces basal corticosterone levels, adrenal responsiveness to stress, and adrenal size and has the potential to protect against the consequences of high corticosterone levels in aging.\r"

  ".W": "A protein (ib), which we have detected previously in peptide hormone or cAMP-stimulated corpus luteum cells, is shown to be a phosphoprotein and to be posttranslationally converted into a more acidic phosphoprotein (ia). Phosphorylation is demonstrated by two types of experiments, both using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. In the first type, gels from [35S]methionine-labeled solubilized cell extracts are compared to gels from such extracts treated with alkaline phosphatase. This in vitro phosphatase treatment converts protein ib quantitatively into protein pb, which is synthesized in vivo only in unstimulated cells. Similarly, ia is converted into pa, the posttranslational product of pb. The second type of experiment demonstrates 32P label incorporation into proteins with the same electrophoretic mobilities as proteins ib and ia. Limited proteolytic digestion of all four proteins from phosphatase-treated and untreated corpus luteum cells shows that the newly detected acidic products, ia and pa, give rise to cleavage patterns similar to those of ib and pb. Further, these patterns resemble those produced by all four such proteins from the adrenal. These findings suggest that in both stimulated corpus luteum and adrenal, a similar protein ib, which accumulates with kinetics and stimulant dose response paralleling those of steroid hormone biosynthesis, is phosphorylated during its synthesis and is degraded by conversion to another phosphoprotein (ia).\r"

In the present study we administered bovine PRL (bPRL) or bovine GH (bGH) at a physiologic rate to hypophysectomized female rats for 2-3 days, and observed that bPRL caused a small (16%) increase (P less than 0.01), and bGH a 36% increase (P less than 0.01), in hepatic carnitine, bPRL decreased serum carnitine by 24% (P less than 0.05), and bPRL and bGH each increased the liver/serum carnitine ratio by 58% (P less than 0.01), suggesting that these hormones enhance the active uptake of carnitine from plasma. bPRL and bGH, alone or in combination, did not affect the carnitine content of cardiac or skeletal muscle, but in combination they increased the heart/serum and muscle/serum carnitine ratios by 45-76% (P less than 0.01), thus allowing maintenance of normal cardiac and skeletal muscle carnitine despite a decreased plasma level. In hypophysectomized male rats, bPRL did not affect liver or epididymal carnitine. We hypothesize that PRL and GH may play a role in the regulation of the carnitine concentration of female liver by enhancing hepatic uptake of carnitine from plasma, and through this mechanism may affect hepatic fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis. The effect of lactogenic and somatogenic hormones on hepatic carnitine and ketogenesis could be of particular physiological importance in late pregnancy and during lactation.\r"

Although these cells grow in the absence of TSH, when incubated for 2 days in serum-free medium containing purified human or bovine TSH, there was a significant increase in cellular DNA content. The stimulatory effect was observed at concentrations as low as 0.5 microU/ml, which produced a significant increase in DNA content, and was maximal with 5 microU/ml. This effect was still present after 6 days of incubation. Electron microscopy performed by an unbiased observer on cells incubated in the presence of TSH showed an increase in the calculated size of the cells and the nucleus which was significant at 0.1 microU/ml and maximal at 1 microU/ml. Stimulation of 125I organification and hormone production was observed at TSH concentrations as low as 1 microU/ml and was maximal at 10 microU/ml. However, neither TSH (1-50 microU/ml) nor forskolin (10(-6) M) stimulated cAMP production. These data suggest that these cells lack a functional adenylate cyclase pathway and that growth and iodide organification are mediated by other second messenger systems. Such a cell line could yield new insights into the mechanisms of TSH action and may provide a sensitive bioassay for TSH and other thyrotropic factors.\r"

  ".W": "The primary cell type of the intermediate lobe (IL) of the rat pituitary is a polyhedral secretory cell with a smooth ovoid nucleus. The results of this study demonstrate, however, that IL melanotropes are a heterogeneous cell population. Melanotropes differed in the tinctorial properties of their cytoplasm; some cells appeared distinctly darker, others lighter, and cells staining in intermediate shades were also found. Electron microscopical morphometry revealed that darkly staining melanotropes have a denser cytosol and contain a greater amount of rough endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and secretory vesicles than light cells. In addition, in situ hybridization studies, using a POMC probe, showed that POMC mRNA was distributed unevenly among melanotropes in a pattern comparable to the distribution of light and dark cells. These studies further demonstrated that dopaminergic drug treatments, which are known to alter the secretion of POMC-related peptides from the IL, produced parallel changes in both the histological staining properties and the amount of POMC mRNA per cell. Haloperidol treatment dramatically increased the number of dark melanotropes and the amount of POMC mRNA in each cell and eliminated the cellular heterogeneity in both staining properties and the distribution of POMC mRNA. After bromocriptine treatment the number of light melanotropes increased, and each cell contained reduced levels of POMC mRNA. These findings indicate that individual melanotropes maintain different levels of biosynthetic activity and that treatments that alter the secretion of POMC peptides affect both the rate of POMC synthesis in individual melanotropes and the cellular heterogeneity of the IL.\r"

Inasmuch as the production of LLF is dependent on PRL, we decided to determine whether it could influence the release of the hormone by dissociated pituitary cells in culture. This was accomplished by measuring PRL release with a reverse hemolytic plaque assay and PRL gene expression with a DNA probe complementary to PRL mRNA. Treatment of pituitary cells from day 10 lactating rats with liver slice incubates from the same type of animal caused a 35.3 +/- 4.3% increase in PRL release during a 3-h incubation. Likewise, the same dose of LLF activity markedly increased (3.5-fold) the steady state levels of PRL mRNA. The responses were reasonably specific for PRL, since neither GH plaque development nor gene expression was affected by identical treatment. Taken together these results demonstrate that LLF can act directly at the pituitary level to exert positive feedback effects on both PRL release and gene expression.\r"

The maximal effect of carbachol was considerably greater than that of TSH and norepinephrine. Carbachol stimulation of [3H]inositol phosphates (InsPs) was present by 5 min of incubation, while that of TSH required at least 30 min. Neither the basal level of [3H]InsPs nor the stimulation by carbachol (1 microM) or norepinephrine (500 microM) was affected by forskolin (10 microM) or cAMP analogs [8-bromo-cAMP or (Bu)2-cAMP; 1 mM]. A maximal amount of TSH (250 mU/ml) had ergistic effects on submaximal carbachol (1 microM)- and additive effects on maximal norepinephrine (500 microM)-induced accumulation of [3H]InsPs. Since not all of the effects of TSH on the thyroid can be explained by activation of the adenylate cyclase system, these data indicate that TSH may also regulate thyroid function through the polyphosphatidylinositol phosphate pathway. In addition, stimulation of the adenylate cyclase-cAMP system does not modify the effects of carbachol or norepinephrine on [3H]InsPs accumulation in dog thyroid slices.\r"

Infusion of antiserum to bovine FGF into the renal artery of kidneys bearing such transplants significantly retarded their growth, and differentiation of all tissues of endodermal and some of those of mesodermal origin was completely suppressed; differentiation of other tissues of mesodermal origin was partially inhibited. Infusion of nonimmune serum had no such effects. Infusion of recombinant bovine FGF into the renal artery stimulated growth of embryo transplants on the infused kidney, but not of those under the renal capsule of the contralateral kidney, and it did not affect growth of the infused kidney itself. These results suggest that FGF may be important for growth and differentiation of endodermal and some mesodermal tissues of mammalian embryos.\r"

The results of this study indicate that in the fetal guinea pig, the amniotic sac is a site for AVP metabolism. When fetal plasma, urine, and amniotic fluid were fractionated on HPLC, AVP was identified only in fetal plasma and urine. In addition, when AVP and inulin were injected into the amniotic sac in vivo during the last week of gestation, the AVP to inulin ratio decreased (P less than 0.05) over a 2-h period, indicating a swallowing-independent disappearance of AVP. Furthermore, when tritiated AVP was similarly injected, the radioactivity to inulin ratio remained constant, suggesting that AVP was not diffusing out of the amniotic sac. Two hours after the injection into the amniotic sac, amniotic fluid was collected and fractionated by HPLC, and only 42% of the total radioactivity was intact AVP. The remainder was identified in two other products (M1 and M2). Tritiated AVP incubated with amniotic fluid and amnionic membrane in vitro produced both M1 and M2. Tritiated AVP incubated with amnionic membrane in artificial amniotic solution produced only M1. Tritiated AVP incubated in only amniotic fluid produced M2, with only slight M1 production. Thus, neither metabolite was necessary for the production of the other; M1 was amnionic membrane dependent, and M2 was amniotic fluid dependent. In conclusion, the amniotic sac may play a role in the clearance of AVP from the fetal system.\r"

Prolonged exposure of cells (20 h) to TBkAb followed by antigen-antibody dissociation by an acid wash step was required to induce refractoriness to subsequent stimulation of cAMP accumulation with TSH and TSAb. Cycloheximide prevented this desensitization effect. The cAMP response to forskolin was not reduced in cells pretreated by TBkAb and was increased in cells desensitized by TSH or TSAb. The pattern of the TSH dose-response curves suggested that desensitization by TSH or TSAb involved only a postreceptor mechanism but both receptor and postreceptor phenomena in the case of TBkAb. In conclusion, like TSH or TSAb, TBkAb may induce a homologous desensitization in human thyroid cells which is not mediated by cAMP.\r"

The protein is homogeneous according to two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels, shows a molecular weight of 8200 and is therefore referred to as 8.2 K.

  ".W": "Receptors for insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) in rat brain were visualized using autoradiography with [125I]IGF-I. The binding of the labeled peptide was competed for fully by high concentrations of unlabeled IGF-I. At intermediate concentrations of unlabeled peptide the binding of [125I]IGF-I was competed for by unlabeled IGF-I more effectively than by IGF-II or insulin, which is typical of receptors for IGF-I. Essentially every brain section shows specific binding of IGF-I, and the pattern of binding of IGF-I to its receptors correlated well with the cytoarchitectonic structures. In parallel studies we showed that [125I]IGF-II was bound to tissue sections of rat brain and that the binding was competed for by an excess of unlabeled IGF-II. However, intermediate concentrations of unlabeled peptides gave inconclusive results. To confirm that the binding of [125I]IGF-II was to IGF-II receptors, we showed that antibodies specific for the IGF-II receptor inhibited the binding of labeled IGF-II. Furthermore, the binding of the antibody to regions of the brain section, visualized by the application of [125I]protein-A, gave patterns indistinguishable from those obtained with [125I]IGF-II alone. Again, the binding was very widely distributed throughout the central nervous system, and the patterns of distribution corresponded well to the underlying neural structures. Densitometric analysis of the receptors enabled us to compare the distribution of IGF-I receptors with that of IGF-II receptors as well as retrospectively with that of insulin receptors.\r"

  ".W": "To characterize the plasma PRL pattern in adult male rats and elucidate the modulatory effects of testosterone on this circulating PRL pattern, serial blood samples were obtained from both intact rats and rats orchidectomized and given various doses of testosterone via sustained release polydimethylsiloxane implants. Adult male rats were equipped with chronic indwelling jugular catheters. One week later the animals were orchidectomized and given either empty (12-mm) or testosterone-filled polydimethylsiloxane implants measuring 3, 5, or 12 mm that maintain plasma testosterone at 0%, 20%, 30%, or 60%, respectively, of those concentrations found in normal animals. Plasma samples for PRL RIA were obtained every 5-10 min for 3 h, before (intact control) and 3, 6, 9, 15, 21, and 28 days after orchidectomy and testosterone replacement. The plasma PRL pattern in intact animals was pulsatile; on the average, three or four pulses per 3 h, with amplitudes of 3.6 ng/ml on a 2.7 ng/ml nadir, were seen. After orchidectomy PRL pulse nadir, peak, and amplitude were rapidly attenuated. These parameters stabilized between days 6 and 15 at levels approximately 40% of those recorded in intact rats. In contrast, PRL pulse frequency remained in the control range for the first 9 days after orchidectomy. Thereafter, pulse frequency accelerated and reached stable plateau levels by day 15 at 145% of the values seen before orchidectomy. The administration of 3-mm testosterone implants completely prevented the effects of orchidectomy on PRL pulse nadir, peak, and amplitude, but only partially prevented the postorchidectomy rise in pulse frequency. Although the two larger implants (5 and 12 mm) had no further effect on pulse nadir, peak, and amplitude over that seen with the 3-mm implant, only the 12-mm implant completely prevented the acceleration in PRL pulse frequency accompanying orchidectomy. These results indicate that testosterone is intimately involved in regulation of the circulating PRL pattern and that this steroid has effects on the neuroendocrine system controlling PRL pulse frequency independent of those regulating pulse nadir, peak, and amplitude.\r"

  ".W": "The insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II), and glycoproteins containing mannose 6-phosphate (M6P), bind to two different sites of the same receptor molecule (Morgan et al, Nature 329:301, 1987). To study the interactions between the two ligands on their common receptor in intact cells, we examined the effect of free M6P on IGF-II binding and endocytosis in the IM9 human lymphoblastoid cell line. M6P, up to a 3 mM concentration, had no effect on the binding of IGF-II to the cell surface receptor of intact IM9 cells at 4 degrees C. By contrast, when IM9 cells were incubated with 125I-IGF-II at 37 degrees C, 1mM M6P increased cell-associated radioactivity by twofold. The increase was resistant to acid wash at 4 degrees C, and therefore assumed to represent endocytosed IGF-II. Acid-washable radioactivity was no different, confirming that, in intact cells, M6P does not affect IGF-II surface binding. In addition, preincubation of cells with M6P at 37 degrees C for up to 3 hours did not change the abundance of receptor on the cell surface, as measured by a subsequent 4 degrees C binding assay. We conclude that M6P causes a shift of IGF-II-occupied receptors form the cell surface to intracellular locations without affecting surface binding of this ligand in IM9 cells. The effect could be produced by the binding of M6P itself, or by the displacement of endogenous phosphomannosylated ligands.\r"

Previously published studies have consistently shown elevations of GnRH content in the preoptic area (POA) and hypothalamus starting with the appearance of GnRH immunoreactivity around fetal day 12-14 until stabilization around the time of puberty. In the present studies, irNPY content of male and female rat hypothalami and POA was examined during days 0 to 36 of postnatal development. Hypothalamic irNPY content rose steadily from 4.54 +/- 0.19 ng/fragment (males) and 2.72 +/- 0.55 ng/fragment (females) at birth to 34.14 +/- 3.94 ng/fragment (males) and 46.79 +/- 6.16 ng/fragment (females) at day 36, corresponding approximately to the time of vaginal opening. A similar elevation of irNPY content was observed in the POA. At day 0, POA content was 1.91 +/- 0.18 ng/fragment (males) and 2.02 +/- 0.25 ng/fragment (females) and progressively increased to 42.26 +/- 3.94 ng/fragment and 41.33 +/- 3.72 ng/fragment by postnatal day 36. In subsequent investigations, hypophysial-portal and peripheral plasma irNPY was determined around the time of vaginal opening, revealing a surge in portal levels of irNPY which preceded the prepubertal LH surge. The progressive postnatal increase in hypothalamic and POA irNPY content culminating in a prepubertal surge of irNPY secretion into the hypophysial-portal circulation suggests involvement of this neuropeptide in reproductive development and the onset of puberty.\r"

  ".W": "Offspring of women with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) have a lower risk of developing IDDM than offspring of men with IDDM (1). To determine whether the risk of diabetes in offspring of diabetic mothers has changed after dramatic improvements in perinatal survival of these infants, we undertook a follow-up study of 1602 pregnancies of 739 women with IDDM who were patients at the Joslin Diabetes Center. Improvements in perinatal survival were abrupt rather than gradual. During the two decades before 1961, perinatal mortality was stable around 23%. After a sudden drop in 1961, it stabilized around 14% until 1975, when it was brought down to 4%, where it has remained. Of the 1391 offspring who survived the neonatal period, IDDM has developed in 21, a cumulative risk of 2.1 +/- 0.5% (SE) by age 20 yr. This is one-third the risk previously reported for offspring of fathers with IDDM and is independent of the calendar time of the births (1). The risk of diabetes in offspring of diabetic mothers is increased in young mothers and is otherwise independent of risk factors for perinatal mortality in this series. We conclude that there is no evidence that selective loss of diabetes-susceptible fetuses in perinatal deaths is a mechanism for the lower incidence of IDDM in the offspring of mothers with IDDM than in those of fathers with IDDM. The principal alternative mechanism is that exposure in utero to an affected mother can protect a fetus from developing IDDM later in life. Induction of immunologic tolerance to the autoantigens of the beta-cells is a plausible mechanism for this protective effect.\r"

Control and streptozocin-induced diabetic (STZ-D) rats were treated daily for 6 wk with high-dose L-carnitine (3 g.kg-1.day-1 i.p.). STZ-D results in loss of body weight and hypoinsulinemia. These effects were not altered by L-carnitine treatment. Myocardial free-carnitine levels were decreased in the untreated diabetic rats. L-Carnitine treatment of the diabetic rats increased myocardial free-carnitine levels, which were comparable with those of control rats. Six weeks after STZ administration, hearts from untreated diabetic animals exhibited depressed left ventricular developed pressure, cardiac contractility, and ventricular relaxation rates compared with control animals. However, this depression was not seen in the L-carnitine-treated diabetic animals. L-Carnitine treatment of diabetic rats significantly reduced plasma glucose and lipid levels but had no effect on control rats. Furthermore, thyroid hormone levels were higher in the L-carnitine-treated diabetic rats than in the untreated diabetic group. The data suggest that high-dose L-carnitine treatment may reduce the severity of diabetes and result in improved cardiac performance.\r"

These data can be used in estimating disease frequency from primary care encounter data. The experience with age/sex registries in the Ambulatory Sentinel Practice Network (ASPN) has identified three major sources of error when registry data are used to estimate disease rates: (1) studies using medical encounter data exclude those individuals who do not seek medical care, (2) visitation is not random and is a function of variables in addition to disease incidence, and (3) encounter data from primary care practices are incomplete due to reporting problems and patient-initiated visits to other health care providers. Despite these limitations, age/sex registries can provide a practical tool for estimating disease rates in appropriate settings, assessing the generalizability of results, and assessing the feasibility of studies in practice based research. Further research about age/sex registries is needed to improve disease rate estimation as well as to better define methods. An age/sex registry enumerates a population by age and sex categories. Such a registry of the patients cared for by a medical practice represents a useful tool for practice based research. This paper briefly reviews the background of age/sex registries in North America, describes the experience of the Ambulatory Sentinel Practice Network with age/sex registries, identifies problems in using age/sex registries to provide denominator data for disease frequency estimation, and explores other uses for age/sex registry data.\r"

Seventy percent of these errors came from five of the 34 participating practices. Sixty-six percent of the records were error-free. Seventy-seven percent of the errors were associated with problems with methods and clustered into three categories: gravidity, gestational age, and dilation and curettage (D&C).

PID, as diagnosed by the clinicians in ASPN, was less severe than other published clinical descriptions of PID. Fewer patients had fever, palpable adnexal masses, and extensive tenderness than reported in other series. Although 43% of patients met published recommendations for hospitalization, the clinicians hospitalized only 9% on the initial visit, similar to the hospitalization rate by office gynecologists in a national study. Whether this management represented optimal care in the primary care setting is unknown. If office based physicians in the United States admitted to the hospital all PID patients who met current recommendations for hospitalization, the added annual cost could exceed $1.2 billion. Given both the serious clinical consequences of PID and the enormous financial implications of different clinical strategies, there is a compelling need to investigate the diagnosis and management of PID in primary care.\r"

  ".W": "Lipocytes and transitional cells in alcoholic liver disease were analyzed by quantitative morphometry in liver biopsy specimens of 17 alcoholic patients. In fatty livers, 93% of the perisinusoidal cells were lipocytes with a volume of lipid droplets occupying more than 20% of the individual cell volume. In fatty livers with perivenular fibrosis, 83% of the cells were lipocytes and 17% were transitional cells with lipid droplets of less than 20% of the cell volume. In cirrhosis, 45% of the cells were lipocytes and 55% of the cells were transitional cells. Thus, the process of hepatic fibrosis was associated with a shift from lipocytes to transitional cells. The percentage of transitional cells (expressed as total perisinusoidal cells) was 5.1% in fatty livers, 16.5% in fatty livers with perivenular fibrosis (not significantly different when compared to fatty livers) and 59.7% in cirrhotic livers (p less than 0.025) when compared to fatty livers or fatty livers with perivenular fibrosis). The number of transitional cells per 100 hepatocytes was estimated to be 0.5 in fatty livers, 1.3 in fatty livers with perivenular fibrosis and 2.1 in cirrhotic livers. The appearance of transitional cells was associated with a corresponding decrease in the number of lipocytes, supporting the hypothesis that transitional cells were derived from lipocytes. In comparison to lipocytes, the surface area of transitional cells (as measured by digitized morphometry) was 30 to 46% smaller (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The aromatic amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine in cirrhotics were elevated to the same extent in plasma and in muscle water. Branched-chain amino acids were uniformly reduced in plasma, but in muscle water only valine was significantly lower (222 +/- 92 mumoles per kg intracellular water vs. 368 +/- 82, p less than 0.001), while isoleucine (142 +/- 63 vs. 103 +/- 30), leucine (223 +/- 88 vs. 226 +/- 36) and branched-chain amino acids as a whole (589 +/- 186 vs. 681 +/- 88) were normal or elevated with an increased muscle:plasma ratio (3.12 +/- 2.03 vs. 1.41 +/- 0.37, p less than 0.05 for isoleucine; 3.00 +/- 1.28 vs. 1.85 +/- 0.27, p less than 0.025 for leucine; 2.24 +/- 0.64 vs. 1.69 +/- 0.13, p less than 0.05 for total branched-chain amino acids. Our data show that, in cirrhosis, plasma concentrations of branched-chain amino acids do not reflect their levels in muscle cellular water; only the intracellular pool of valine is severely depleted. This suggests that higher amounts of valine supplementation may be useful in nutritional treatment of liver cirrhosis. The elevated muscle:plasma gradients for branched-chain amino acids may result from abnormalities in their transport through muscle-plasma membrane.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Liposomal N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine-glycerol dipalmitate was 16-fold more potent than liposomal N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine and 2,400-fold more potent than N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine in inducing Kupffer cell tumoricidal activity in vitro. A single i.v. injection of liposomes containing N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine-glycerol dipalmitate was capable of inducing Kupffer cell tumoricidal activity as measured against B16-melanoma cells after Kupffer cell isolation. Maximal cytotoxic activity was obtained with 1 microgram muramyl dipeptide-glycerol dipalmitate encapsulated within liposomes: doses of 10 or 100 micrograms inhibited tumoricidal activity. Kupffer cells from mice treated with liposomes containing N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine-glycerol dipalmitate remained cytotoxic for at least 6 days after injection. Liposomal N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine was significantly less potent than liposomal N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine-glycerol dipalmitate in inducing Kupffer cell tumoricidal activity in situ. N-Acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine was capable of inducing Kupffer cell tumoricidal activity in vitro: its failure to induce tumoricidal activity in situ at doses of 1,000 micrograms demonstrates the utility of liposomal carriers for the in vivo activation of Kupffer cells by muramyl dipeptides.\r"

In the present studies, we show that phenobarbital also induces an accumulation of activated macrophages in the livers of treated rats. These macrophages are larger and more stellate than resident Kupffer cells and are highly vacuolated. In addition, macrophages isolated from livers of phenobarbital-treated rats display increased phagocytosis of sheep red blood cells, chemotaxis toward the complement fragment C5a and enhanced production of hydrogen peroxide. Biologically active mediators released by activated macrophages have been implicated in tumor promotion as well as in the regulation of cytochrome P-450-mediated drug biotransformation. We propose that the activated macrophages that accumulate in the liver following phenobarbital treatment may contribute, at least in part, to the biological responses to this drug.\r"

A similar disease is observed after ingestion of drugs which inhibit hepatic mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation and in subjects with various inborn defects in this metabolic pathway. We therefore determined the effects of tetracycline on the mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids in mice and in man. In vitro, addition of tetracycline 0.25, 0.5, 1 or 2 mM inhibited by 15, 38, 56 and 65%, respectively, the formation of beta-oxidation products during incubation of palmitic acid with mouse liver mitochondria and the various cofactors necessary for beta-oxidation. Inhibition was reversible. Inhibition appeared even greater with human liver mitochondria. Tricarboxylic acid cycle activity, assessed by the in vitro formation of [14C]CO2 from [1-14C]acetylcoenzyme A by mouse liver mitochondria, was inhibited by 25, 32 and 43%, respectively, in the presence of 0.5, 1 or 2 mM of tetracycline. In vivo, administration of tetracycline, 0.25 or 1 mmole per kg, inhibited by 53 and 84%, respectively, the exhalation of [14C]CO2 during the first 3 hours following the administration of a tracer dose of [U-14C]palmitic acid. Administration of tetracycline, 0.0625, 0.25 or 1 mmole per kg, 6 hr before the measurement, increased hepatic triglycerides by 100, 170 and 250%, respectively. After 1 mmole per kg, accumulation of hepatic triglycerides was maximum at 24 hr, reaching 9-fold the control value; liver histology showed microvesicular steatosis at 6 and 24 hr. We conclude that tetracycline inhibits the mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids in mice and in man.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In order to study the relationship between amiodarone-induced hepatic phospholipidosis and liver disease, liver biopsies obtained from 13 patients treated with amiodarone for 4 months to 15 years were investigated by light and electron microscopy. Light microscopy showed pseudoalcoholic liver lesions that were probably related to amiodarone in four cases, various alterations (i.e. cirrhosis, three cases; steatosis and fibrosis, two cases; chronic venous congestion, one case; acute hepatitis, one case) that could be explained by another cause than amiodarone in seven cases and normal liver in two cases. In all cases, electron microscopy showed intralysosomal myelin figures suggestive of phospholipidosis. These myelin figures were associated with intralysosomal electron-dense deposits. In the four cases in which analysis by electron microprobe was performed, it demonstrated large amounts of iodine in the electron-dense deposit-containing lysosomes, indicating the accumulation of amiodarone. These results show that hepatic phospholipidosis is constantly observed in amiodarone-treated patients, whether or not pseudoalcoholic liver lesions are present. This phospholipidosis, which could be only a morphological marker of intrahepatic accumulation of the drug, should not therefore be considered grounds for attributing liver disease to the drug.\r"

The present study was designed primarily to investigate the biliary excretion of organic bile constituents following administration of the manganese-bilirubin combination. Experiments in hyperbilirubinemic Gunn rats were also performed to determine whether the unconjugated or the conjugated form of bilirubin is involved in this cholestatic interaction. Male Sprague-Dawley rats and male homozygous Gunn rats were given the following (i.v.): (a) manganese (4.5 mg per kg); (b) unconjugated bilirubin (25 mg per kg); (c) bilirubin ditaurate (38 mg per kg); (d) manganese-unconjugated bilirubin, or (e) manganese-bilirubin ditaurate. Bile flow was measured and bile was analyzed for manganese, total bilirubin, bile salts, cholesterol and phospholipid content. The results show that: (i) manganese-unconjugated bilirubin treatment caused about a 50% reduction in bile flow in Sprague-Dawley rats, whereas in Gunn rats the manganese-bilirubin ditaurate treatment resulted in about a 75% reduction, and (ii) in both strains, bile salt excretion was not appreciably modified during the cholestatic phase, as biliary bile salt concentration increased. The results suggest that although important differences regarding the form of bilirubin apparently exist, unconjugated bilirubin could be implicated in the cholestatic interaction in both strains of rats. Manganese-bilirubin-induced cholestasis is not related to a defect in bile salt excretion. The latter supports our contention that diminished canalicular membrane permeability to water is likely to be a key factor in this form of experimental cholestasis.\r"

The volume of the liver was evaluated by ultrasonography. All subjects had normal routine liver function tests and no history of liver disease. Galactose elimination progressively decreased from 3.05 +/- 0.58 (S.D.) mmoles per min in younger subjects to 1.83 +/- 0.24 mmoles per min in subjects over 81 (p less than 0.00003), without any change in the apparent volume of distribution of the sugar. Similarly, the estimated volume of the liver decreased from 110 +/- 14 units to 75 +/- 13 units with increasing age (p less than 0.0002). Both galactose elimination capacity and the estimated liver volume inversely correlated with age (r = -0.728 and r = -0.579, respectively) whereas a positive correlation was observed between galactose elimination and the estimated liver volume (r = 0.520). Part correlation analysis confirmed that age, when entered in a multiple regression already containing body weight and estimated liver volume as independent variables, had a significant effect on liver function, whereas no significant independent effect of liver volume was present. Both age and body weight had a significant independent effect on the estimated liver volume. The maximum functional capacity of the liver, measured by galactose elimination, is reduced in the elderly. Although several factors may play a role, our data suggest that aging is associated with a slight decline in the intrinsic metabolic activity of the hepatic parenchyma.\r"

Assessment was made of their mental state, number connection test, venous blood ammonia, electroencephalography and visual evoked potentials with both pattern reversal and flash stimuli. Because of considerable inter- and intraindividual variation in waveform, visual evoked potentials from flash stimuli were considered unreliable. In pattern reversal visual evoked potentials, the latency of the N1 and P1 waves was significantly longer (p less than 0.05) in patients than in controls; however, the wave latencies did not correlate with the mental state score. The mental state score correlated with the number connection test (r = 0.69, p less than 0.001), asterixis (r = 0.36, p less than 0.05), electroencephalography mean dominant frequency (r = 0.44, p less than 0.01) and blood ammonia (r = 0.60, p less than 0.01). In 14 patients studied sequentially, change in the mental state score correlated with change in the number connection test (r = 0.80, p less than 0.01) and asterixis (r = 0.75, p less than 0.01) but not with change in the electroencephalography, blood ammonia or visual evoked potential wave latencies. Although visual evoked potentials are abnormal in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and encephalopathy, they are less accurate in assessing the level of consciousness than simple bedside evaluation with a number connection test.\r"

Soft tissue infections were the most common source of bacteremia, followed by pneumonia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and urinary tract infection. Gram positive organisms were isolated in 69% of cases, and Gram negative ones in 31%. In nine patients, no source of bacteremia was detected. Leukocytosis occurred in 59% of patients and bandemia in only 41%. Although appropriate antibiotic therapy was begun in all cases on admission, 17 patients (33%) died in the hospital. Of 38 clinical parameters evaluated, multivariate analysis revealed that the three variables contributing the most independent information toward predicting in-hospital mortality were the absence of a history of fever, an elevated serum creatinine and marked leukocytosis. Improved understanding of the pathophysiologic relationship between these parameters and patient outcome may enable us to improve the therapy of bacteremic patients with chronic liver disease.\r"

As ketanserin has alpha 1-adrenoceptor-blocking properties in addition to its serotonin-blocking effects, we sought to define further the mechanism of ketanserin's portal pressure-lowering effect. We attempted to determine whether the portal pressure-reducing effect of ketanserin was due to the unspecific effect of arterial blood pressure reduction mediated by alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade or to serotonin receptor-blocking properties of ketanserin. The hemodynamic action of prazosin and alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist and ketanserin were compared in portal hypertensive rats in which the arterial pressure was equally reduced by both agents. The portal pressure was significantly lower in the ketanserin-treated group (11.3 +/- 0.4 mm Hg) when compared to the saline-treated group (13.6 +/- 0.7 mm Hg). The portal pressure was not significantly lower in the prazosin-treated group when compared to the saline-treated group (12.3 +/- 0.5 vs. 13.6 +/- 0.7 mm Hg, respectively). The same relationship held true for portal venous inflow and cardiac output. For each measurement, results in the ketanserin group were significantly lower when compared to the saline-treated group. These data in the prazosin-treated group were similar to data in the saline-treated group. The differences between the effect of ketanserin and prazosin were obtained despite similar blood pressure decreases. Ketanserin produced an 18% decrease and prazosin a 14% decrease in blood pressure when values were compared to their preinjection baselines.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We examined the prevalence of serum anti-delta antibody among 769 intravenous drug abusers in Taiwan. delta infection was found extremely common in the HBsAg-positive carriers with drug abuse, because 128 (85%) of 151 carriers were positive for anti-delta. However, most of antibody titers were low (less than 1:5,000). By molecular hybridization, delta RNA genomes were detectable in only five (4%) of 128 asymptomatic carriers positive for anti-delta. The results suggested that most of them had previous, instead of ongoing, delta infection. We also studied the serum markers reflecting hepatitis B virus replication in these carriers and a control group. Hepatitis B e antigen was positive in only 12 (10%) of 115 anti-delta positive carriers in contrast to 22 (23%) of 95 age- and sex-matched HBsAg-positive, anti-delta negative volunteers donating blood (p less than 0.025). Furthermore, in contrast to the close association between HBeAg and hepatitis B virus DNA generally present in HBsAg carriers (concordance in this series: 79%), among the 12 HBeAg-positive subjects of the delta infected group, only two, or 17%, had serum hepatitis B virus DNA (p less than 0.003). Such suppressing effects did not require a simultaneous presence of the delta agent, as shown by the lack of delta RNA genomes in the serum by sensitive assay. We conclude that although delta superinfection is common in the asymptomatic HBsAg carriers with intravenous drug abuse in the nonendemic area of Taiwan, continuous delta activities are uncommon in them. In addition, the previous delta infection probably exerts effective suppression on the hepatitis B virus replication in these HBsAg carriers.\r"

  ".U": "88329951\r", 
  ".W": "To evaluate the profile of hepatitis D virus replication and the corresponding immunoresponse after acute hepatitis D virus infection, sera from 50 patients with acute hepatitis D (36 with acute hepatitis B virus-hepatitis D virus coinfection and 14 HBsAg carriers with hepatitis D virus superinfection) were investigated for the presence of hepatitis D virus RNA and other serological hepatitis D virus markers. During the first week after onset of symptoms, hepatitis D virus RNA was detected by spot hybridization with a similar frequency among patients with coinfection (64%) and those with superinfection (71%). The presence of hepatitis D virus RNA in the first serum sample correlated with that of circulating hepatitis D antigen in both groups of patients. The presence of hepatitis D virus RNA was transient and its clearance paralleled that of serum hepatitis D antigen among patients with coinfection, so that 1 month after the onset of symptoms serum hepatitis D virus RNA was no longer detectable in any of these patients. Conversely, serum hepatitis D virus RNA was still present in 78% of those with superinfection, all of whom developed chronic liver disease, thus suggesting that the persistence of hepatitis D virus RNA in the serum for more than 4 weeks might indicate progression to chronicity. In nine of the 14 patients (64%) with hepatitis D virus superinfection progressing to chronicity, hepatitis D virus RNA was persistently detected throughout the follow-up, whereas in five patients it was detected occasionally. In four superinfected patients hepatitis D virus RNA and hepatitis B virus DNA were detected simultaneously in serial samples, thus suggesting that, at least during early stages of chronic hepatitis D virus infection, both viruses may replicate at the same time.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-one asymptomatic Chinese hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carrier children (34 boys, 17 girls), age 1 to 15 years (median: 10 years), were prospectively followed for up to 4 years (median: 30 months) to determine the natural evolution of clinical, biochemical and virological features during the early phase of chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Hepatomegaly was the only abnormal finding on examination, being present in five children initially and four at follow-up. Serum ALT levels were normal in 80% of the children at presentation and remained within the normal range during the study in 60%. Fluctuations in ALT levels were mild. In four of 12 instances, transient elevations in ALT levels were associated with a fall in serum hepatitis B virus DNA levels. At presentation, 43 (84%) children were hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive; only two (7%) cleared HBeAg on follow-up. None of the eight children who were initially positive for the antibody to HBeAg reverted back to HBeAg positivity. All the children remained HBsAg positive. In this study, we demonstrated that chronic hepatitis B virus infection in asymptomatic Chinese children is usually associated with a mild and stable liver disease despite high levels of hepatitis B virus replication. This may reflect an immunological tolerance to the hepatitis B virus induced by early exposure to the virus and accounts for the persistently high levels of hepatitis B virus replication on follow-up.\r"

  ".W": "To assess extent of hepatic involvement in measles, we evaluated prospectively 144 patients (ages 0.2 to 43 years) during an outbreak. Liver function parameters (AST, ALT, serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and bilirubin) were determined on presentation and at 2 and 4 weeks. The study comprised 52 pediatric (less than or equal to 14 years) and 92 adult patients. Liver dysfunction was evident quite often (56 to 66%) in adult patients. However, in the pediatric age group, these abnormalities were less frequent and less extensive. Moreover, a significant correlation was noted between age and each of the following parameters: AST (r = 0.61), ALT (r = 0.56) and serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (r = 0.39). In all subjects all parameters normalized after 2 to 4 weeks. The data presented suggest that hepatic dysfunction in measles is probably not rare and is more frequent and more extensive in adults. However, these abnormalities seem to be subclinical, self-limited and probably with no long-term sequelae.\r"

An excerpt from a transcript of one nurse's thinking aloud while making a triage decision is presented to illustrate the types of knowledge and cognitive processes that can be elicited and revealed by using this strategy. Potential educational benefits are identified, along with suggestions for implementing thinking aloud as an instructional method.\r"

Group A (n = 13) used a self-directed learning package and group B (n = 11) attended a lecture. Data were collected during an 8-week orientation. During week 2 the knowledge pretest was administered, the demographic data questionnaire was completed, and group A was given the self-directed learning package. During week 6 group A completed the self-directed learning package and group B attended the lecture. During week 8 the knowledge and performance simulation posttests were administered, and the study time questionnaire was completed. A paired t test revealed a difference in pretest and posttest knowledge in all participants, t (23) = 6.6, p less than 0.001, indicating that learning occurred among all participants. ANCOVA showed no significant differences between groups in knowledge and performance. A t test showed no significant differences in total study time between the two groups. Group A reported significantly (p less than 0.001) greater at-home study time than group B. Results of this study indicate that nurse orientees' knowledge and performance may be similar with the use of either lecture or self-directed learning package.\r"

Variables studied included syringe size, change of needles after drawing medication into the syringe, use of an air bubble, and type of sponge (dry or alcohol) applied to the site after injection. The sample included 50 medical-surgical patients aged 23 to 88 years. Each subject received two injections by the same investigator using two different techniques. Sites were inspected and bruises and induration measured 52 hours after each injection. To compare the size of bruises and indurations, the data were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney U-Wilcoxon rank sum test, which showed a 0.003 level of significance for bruises and a 0.02 level of significance for induration. To compare the number of subjects in whom bruises and indurations developed, the data were analyzed by the chi-square test, which showed a 0.0458 level of significance for induration but only a 0.1371 level of significance for bruising.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Data were collected from 56 subjects randomly selected from 255 young women. Systolic (S1), fourth phase diastolic (D4), and fifth phase diastolic (D5) values were the dependent variables. Three research hypotheses were tested. Data were analyzed by using a one-tailed t test for dependent means. Hypotheses 1 and 2 predicted that use of the bell would result in higher S1 and D4 readings, respectively, than use of the diaphragm. Hypothesis 1 was supported whereas hypothesis 2 was not. Hypothesis 3, which stated that using the bell would produce a lower D5 reading than using the diaphragm, was supported. Implications of these findings as well as suggestions for future research are discussed.\r"

This method allows self-administration of small, frequent doses of an analgesic agent to maintain a state of constant pain control. We studied the relative efficacy of PCA compared with intermittent analgesic dosing in 16 male patients requiring posterolateral thoracotomy. Eight patients received intermittent doses of buprenorphine hydrochloride (0.3 mg intramuscularly every 3 to 6 hours), and eight patients were allowed to self-activate a PCA device according to a designed protocol. In the patients using PCA, a significant reduction in the postoperative pulmonary complication rate, as evidenced by radiographic findings, was noted. In addition, significantly less medication was used and postoperative fever was substantially reduced in the PCA group. We believe PCA to be a safe, effective, and beneficial pain management modality that deserves attention in the postoperative period.\r"

Five alert and oriented patients with pulmonary disease that was restrictive, obstructive, or both, who were receiving mechanical ventilation, participated in this descriptive study. At 4-hour intervals and at complaint of dyspnea, patients quantified the severity of their dyspnea using the visual analogue and modified Borg scales. At each measurement of dyspnea, nurses observed concomitant physiologic and environmental variables. A moderate correlation (r = 0.51, p less than 0.001) was found between the number of events and activities occurring in the intensive care unit environment and the occurrence and severity of dyspnea. The visual analogue scale and modified Borg scale measures of dyspnea were highly correlated (r = 0.92, p less than 0.001) and may be useful tools for assessing dyspnea in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation.\r"

  ".W": "Closed system suctioning (CSS) is a method of removing secretions from the tracheobronchial tree of patients with mechanical ventilation without disconnecting the mechanical ventilator. The putative benefits of CSS include the maintenance of positive pressure ventilation, oxygen supply, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). However, some evidence indicates that negative airway pressure may develop during CSS if inappropriate ventilator settings are selected. The purpose of this in vitro, descriptive study was to delineate the airway pressures obtained during CSS with use of different ventilators and combinations of ventilator settings. Each ventilator was connected to a Vent Aid Training Test Lung and set at a ventilatory rate of 12/min and a tidal volume of 800 ml. For each ventilator, CSS was performed at peak inspiratory flow rates of 25, 40, 50, and 60 L/min, at sensitivities of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 cm H2O, with and without PEEP of 10 cm H2O, and in modes of intermittent mandatory ventilation, assist control, and control. Airway pressure was measured at the Y-connector of the ventilator tubing. Two CSS trials were performed at each ventilator setting with the Ballard Trach Care System, a 14F in-line suction catheter, at a flow rate of 20 L/min for 10 seconds. During each suctioning trial, the peak positive and negative airway pressures were recorded. The negative airway pressure was above -10 cm H2O in most situations. In the control mode at all flow rates with or without PEEP, the Bennett MA1 and the Bourns-Bear 1 and 2 produced sustained peak negative airway pressure of less than -50 cm H2O.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Little is known about the specific strategies used by people with asthma to control symptoms and abort asthma attacks. The purpose of this study was to identify self-care strategies used to control asthma symptoms and to determine the effect of peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) information on selection of self-care strategies. Thirty adult subjects with asthma were randomly assigned to either a control or an experimental group; 28 completed the study. All subjects recorded episodes of dyspnea, wheezing, and chest tightness and self-care actions in an asthma symptom diary. The experimental group recorded PEFR at the beginning and end of each symptom episode. Reported strategies were categorized into problem-focused, emotion-focused, or mixed self-care strategies. The experimental group, with access to PEFR information, used medication significantly less often than the control group. The experimental group also reported fewer and less frequent uses of alternative nondrug strategies.\r"

There was no significant difference among the three groups for state anxiety scores or physiologic parameters. Because no differences were found, analyses were conducted of the groups combined. Significant improvement in all of the physiologic parameters was found to have occurred.

Hierarchical multiple regressions confirmed these results once variance in burnout linked with life stressors and other occupational stressors was accounted for. Furthermore, an interaction term, noise-induced stress X intrinsic sensitivity to noise in the person, did not account for significant variance in burnout once independent variance linked with noise-induced stress was identified. That is, nurses with intrinsic sensitivity to noise were no more at risk for burnout linked with noise-induced stress than were less sensitive nurses. This result is discussed as evidence that there are exceptionally high levels of noise in critical care units. The critical care unit noises that are most distressing to nurses are identified and discussed in terms of stress theory.\r"

Interview transcriptions underwent content analysis. Parental needs were categorized as physical, psychologic, or sociologic in origin. Finer subcategorizations of need areas were identified. The majority of parental needs were psychologic. Subcategories identified most frequently were \"visit or stay with the child\" and \"child-related information.\" The specific needs most often identified were to be with the child in the PICU and to receive frequent, accurate and truthful information about the child's condition.

For the patients who were less than ten years old at the onset of the disease, there was no difference in the results of the two procedures, even when the results were analyzed according to age. However, the center-edge angle, neck-shaft angle, lengths of the limbs, range of abduction, and total range of motion were closer to normal after an innominate osteotomy. There was no difference in the ratings when the results of the two operations were compared according to the several parameters that have been proved to be associated with the long-term outcome for hips in patients who have Legg-Calve-Perthes disease. However, the innominate osteotomy seemed to be the better procedure when involvement of the growth plate was likely to cause coxa vara or a substantial discrepancy in the lengths of the limbs.

No revisions have been performed for aseptic loosening of the prosthesis, but six hips have shown radiographic evidence of loosening. Inadequate medialization of the acetabular component increased the incidence of loosening substantially, but variations in the thickness of the cement, in the volume of cement used, and in the extent of acetabular coverage were not found to be associated with radiographic evidence of loosening. We concluded that the addition of a large, solid, superolateral bone graft above a cemented acetabular component does not decrease the likelihood of loosening and may increase it.\r"

  ".W": "From 1979 to 1984, eighty patients (119 knees) were arbitrarily selected for treatment with knee arthroplasty in which a posterior cruciate-substituting replacement was used. The average age of the forty-nine women and thirty-one men was 66.9 years (range, twenty-two to eighty-four years). Sixty-one right and fifty-eight left knees were operated on, and bilateral replacement was performed in thirty-nine of the eighty patients. The diagnosis was osteoarthritis in fifty-eight patients (eighty-eight knees), rheumatoid arthritis in fourteen patients (twenty-two knees), osteonecrosis in three patients (four knees), and traumatic arthritis secondary to a fracture of the tibia or femur in five patients (five knees). The average preoperative score on The Hospital for Special Surgery knee-rating scale was 47.5 points, and the average range of motion preoperatively was 88 degrees (range, 30 to 140 degrees). Of the 119 knees, eighty-seven had a varus alignment (maximum, 35 degrees) before knee replacement. After follow-up of two to eight years, the average score on The Hospital for Special Surgery scale was 90 points, and the average range of motion was 107 degrees. Of the 119 knees, 83 per cent were rated as excellent; 15 per cent, as good; none, as fair; and 2 per cent, as poor. Radiolucencies of one millimeter were present in 76 per cent of the knees; of two millimeters, in 7 per cent; and of three millimeters, in 3 per cent. No statistically significant correlation between radiolucencies and the clinical result was found. The results in knees of patients who had rheumatoid arthritis were not as good as those in knees of patients who had other diagnoses (F = 11.44). Our experience suggested that the posterior cruciate-substituting design provides more motion than do the cruciate-sacrificing surface-replacement designs, with no deleterious effects. The rate of infection (1.6 per cent) after these procedures, which were carried out in a standard operating theater with vertical airflow, was equivalent to that in other published series in which rooms with laminar airflow were used. Patients who had a bilateral procedure did as well as those who had a unilateral replacement, but they required approximately 3.5 more units of blood.\r"

For all of the patients, the average rating for pain improved from 3 points preoperatively to 8 points postoperatively, and the average rating for function improved from 3 to 7 points. The ranges of abduction and of external rotation improved substantially in the shoulders that were affected by osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or osteonecrosis. Ten patients were treated with a hooded glenoid component, designed to improve stability in shoulders in which the rotator cuff is deficient. In these shoulders, both the rating for pain and the rating for function improved, although the range of motion did not. Complications that required revision of the arthroplasty developed in five shoulders in which a regular component had been implanted and in two that had a hooded glenoid component. A radiolucent line developed at the bone-cement interface of the glenoid component in fifty-three shoulders, but only two revisions were done for loosening of the glenoid component.\r"

Mechanical non-destructive cyclical testing in axial compression, rotation, and flexion was performed on each spinal segment after stabilization was accomplished. The three anterior-stabilization constructs that were compared were: (1) iliac strut grafting, (2) polymethylmethacrylate and anterior Harrington-rod instrumentation (the technique of Siegal and Siegal), and (3) the Kaneda anterior device. After anterior iliac-crest strut grafting, four types of posterior instrumentation were also tested sequentially: (1) Harrington distraction rods, (2) Luque rectangular instrumentation, (3) Cotrel-Dubousset transpedicular instrumentation, and (4) Steffee transpedicular screws and plates. Rotation, torque, axial displacement, and axial loads were measured during loading across the whole spinal segment between the grip points. Using an anterior extensometer, intervertebral displacement at the second, third, and fourth lumbar levels, and thus across the corpectomy defect at the third lumbar level, was recorded \"on line\" during testing in flexion and axial load. By recording the intervertebral displacement, the efficacy of each spinal construct in minimizing motion across the corpectomy defect could be quantified. The value for one-way analysis of variance for axial intervertebral displacement across the site of the third lumbar corpectomy was F = 10.5, p less than 0.001. The value for one-way analysis of variance for flexural intervertebral displacement across the corpectomy defect was F = 21.1, p less than 0.001. Homogeneous subsets of rigidity for torsional stiffness revealed that the least rigid constructs were iliac grafting alone, Harrington-rod instrumentation, and Luque rectangular instrumentation. The most rigid constructs were the anterior Kaneda device, transpedicular Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation, and Steffee screws and plates. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: After corpectomy, spinal reconstructive surgery can restore axial, torsional, and flexural rigidity to normal levels. These experimental conclusions applied to the acute restoration of stability, rather than to rigidity after long-term cyclical loading. Using the most rigid anterior system, the Kaneda device, the fixation extended only one vertebral level cephalad and one level caudad to the corpectomy defect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

After a minimum follow-up of one year, four patients could not walk and fourteen were dependent on orthoses. In nine patients, the lesions produced fixed skeletal deformities that caused severe malum perforans, which in three patients was so severe that a below-the-knee amputation had to be done. In patients who had bilateral lesions, when the extremity that was initially involved was prevented from bearing weight, involvement of the contralateral limb became evident after an average of 4.5 months, compared with an average of twelve months in the patients who were allowed weight-bearing on the extremity that was initially involved. Our current treatment protocol is non-weight-bearing immobilization of the involved extremity, and we recommend prophylactic immobilization of the contralateral extremity with a protective cast or orthosis. All of the patients who had this treatment regimen could walk; in contrast, of the eleven patients who were not so treated, four could not walk.\r"

Thus, the implant was loose and motion was present between it and the femur in each animal. Five dogs had a revision to a prosthesis with a porous polysulfone-coated stem. This prosthesis was not cemented in place. One dog was killed before the revision for the purpose of histological examination. Although bone was present in the porous surface of all five stems at the revision, the amount was scant in three. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A model is described for the study of cemented hip-replacement prostheses that have failed. Although variable amounts of ingrowth of bone were observed after the revision to the porous-coated prostheses without bone cement, further study is needed to determine whether adequate ingrowth of bone occurs in this model.\r"

The healing response was then examined using histology and autoradiography with 35SO4 at intervals from one week to six months. The defects that had been filled with a fibrin clot healed through a proliferation of fibrous connective tissue that eventually modulated into fibrocartilaginous tissue. The fibrin clot appeared to act as a chemotactic and mitogenic stimulus for reparative cells and to provide a scaffolding for the reparative process. The origin of these reparative cells was not determined in this study, but they were thought to arise from the synovial membrane as well as the adjacent meniscal tissue. Control defects remained empty. While the reparative tissue was grossly and histologically different from the normal adjacent meniscal tissue, it was morphologically similar to the reparative tissue that was previously observed in the vascular area of the meniscus. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The ability of an exogenous fibrin clot to stimulate and support a reparative response in the avascular portion of the meniscus may represent a potential method of avascular meniscal repair.\r"

There were fourteen palsies of the fifth and sixth cervical nerves; eight of the fifth, sixth, and seventh cervical nerves; and one of the entire brachial plexus. Two patients were lost to follow-up shortly after birth. Of the remaining nineteen patients (twenty-one palsies), fifteen (seventeen palsies) had full recovery at an average of three months (range, two weeks to twelve months), and four (four palsies) had residual paralysis of the upper extremity at more than twenty-six months.

Although a lesion in the anterior one-third of the undersurface of the acromion was always associated with a tear of the cuff, the reverse was not true. We concluded that the pathogenesis of most of the tears probably is a degenerative process.\r"

In burn patients with carbon monoxide poisoning the value of HBO also is unproved. This review of the clinical course of ten such patients showed major complications during the course of treatment: two patients suffered from eustachian tube occlusion, two patients had episodes of aspiration, one patient had seizure activity, and severe hypocalcemia developed in another. Progressive hypovolemia was seen in three patients; respiratory acidosis was evident in four. There were three episodes of cardiac dysrhythmia. Seven of the ten patients survived. The authors state that the efficacy of HBO in carbon monoxide poisoning must be studied further. Based on their experience and a review of the literature, they contend that important delayed neurologic sequelae are rare, and further, that they occur and resolve with or without HBO. Multicenter randomized clinical trials with controlled follow-up are needed to assess the actual incidence of neuropsychiatric sequelae and to evaluate the efficacy of HBO.\r"

Another possible factor that has been largely unexplored is the role of the calcium ion--the other principal ionic species with which the skin is in contact. Much has been written about its role in membrane transport and other physiologic processes.\r"

Since limited objective quantitative information is available on the incidence of contractures after thermal injury, or on the factors that predispose individuals to their development, a review of all patients seen from July 1980 through January 1986 for surgical correction of burn wound contractures was conducted. Among the 53 patients selected for study, the incidence of contractures was higher in the pediatric patients, 7.8%, than in the adult patients, 2.0% (P less than 0.001), although burn wound size was comparable in these two groups. There was a direct relationship between wound size and number of contractures per patient (P = 0.003). The majority of contractures occurred at the hand, head, neck, and axilla. Surgical release of contractures of these central body regions (P = 0.056) and of fascially excised burns (P = 0.04), yielded the poorest operative results. Patient age and race, type of operation performed, and timing of surgery did not affect the operative results.\r"

In the first part of the study, 27 patients with burns of various degrees were tested to determine if the peripheral lymphocytes stimulated in vitro for mitotic division would contain micronuclei--a type of chromosomal aberration inducible by many genotoxic substances. Data showed that the frequency of micronuclei did not increase with burn injury but did correlate with age. Therefore, it is suggested that in cases of radiation injuries combined with burns, the pathologic process related to the latter type of injury does not influence the differential diagnostic value of the micronucleus test. In the second part of the study, the validity of this hypothesis was tested in guinea pigs exposed to various doses of gamma-radiation (between 0.5 and 4.0 Gy) and then inflicted with thermal burns. The results confirmed that when radiation injuries and thermal burns coexist, the micronucleus test is a reliable biologic indicator of radiation injury.\r"

Pulmonary arterial size was angiographically assessed before and after the operation. No enlargement of the artery was observed, even after the procedure, confirming the importance of preoperative pulmonary arterial size. All three cases with preoperative PAa/N-RPAa of more than 0.5 survived the operation, whereas two of the remaining three cases (less than 0.5) died due to low cardiac output. The only survivor in the latter group had previously received Glenn's anastomosis. Hemodynamic study was done simultaneously, and a significant exponential correlation was obtained between preoperative PAa/N-RPAa and perioperative post-repair right atrial pressure (p less than 0.025). It was concluded that the selection criterion based on pulmonary arterial size could be expanded to a PAa/N-RPAa value of 0.5 when no Glenn's anastomosis had previously been done and the rudimentary right ventricle was not to be utilized. The exponential curve is useful for postoperative care in Fontan's operation, since it indicates the central venous pressure necessary to sustain the circulation at a level corresponding to the preoperative pulmonary arterial size.\r"

Follow-up lasted from 1 to 60 months, with a mean of 25.6 +/- 12.3 in group A and 20.4 +/- 11.9 in group B. Early and late mortality were low: 1/40 and 2/39 (2.5 and 5.1%) in group A and 4/116 and 9/112 (3.4 and 8.0%) in group B (p = NS): only two deaths, one in each group, were prosthesis-related. Actuarial survival was comparable: 91.2% (CL: 96.3-86.1%) in group A and 78.0% (CL: 87.6-68.4%) in group B, as were probability of being event-free and alive, non-reoperated and with few or no symptoms [group A: 61.7% (CL: 72.4-51.0%) and 77.4% (CL: 85.9-68.9%) respectively; group B: 78.8% (CL: 83.4-74.2%) and 61.1% (CL: 85.9-68.9%) respectively].

Lower limb nerves were stimulated and SEPs recorded at spinal and cortical level. Progressive changes of cortical SEPs until their disappearance were observed. In operations on the thoracic aorta, the spinal response was essentially unmodified, so that the observed alterations reflected true dysfunction of the spinal cord. The only patient who developed an intraoperative anterior spinal infarct had the longest period of absent SEPs and a striking latency prolongation when they returned. Postoperative recordings were absolutely normal. When the abdominal aorta was occluded, SEP alterations involved both cortical and spinal responses, so that it is difficult to distinguish between the relative roles of peripheral nerve and spinal cord ischemia. These findings indicate that SEPs can be reliably applied to spinal cord monitoring in the course of aortic surgery, even though they are mainly conducted in the posterior cord tracts.\r"

Seven of the 33 coilings (21%) were hemodynamically significant with the head in the normal position. A change in perfusion pressure when the head was turned was seen in 16 of 50 rotation studies (32%). There was a reduction in pressure in 11 instances and increase in five. In a control group of 24 subjects with normal angiograms, 18 of 48 studies (37%) showed a change in perfusion pressure with the head turned. Carotid coiling can be hemodynamically significant. Rotation of the head can compromise the carotid circulation whether coiling is present or not. OPG proved to be a simple means of evaluating the hemodynamic significance of carotid coiling and the effects of head rotation on the carotid circulation.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred and fifty nine patients underwent surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) from 1975 to 1985. Of these, a tube graft was inserted in 86 patients (55.1%). Immediate and late results of these 86 patients were evaluated retrospectively as to the effect of concomitant common iliac artery (CIA) disease on early and late results. There were 77 males and nine females aged 35-91 (average 70.7) years. Surgery was elective in 44 patients (51.2%), and as an emergency due to expanding, ruptured or thrombosed AAA in 42 patients (48.8%). The CIAs showed unilateral or bilateral aneurysmal dilatation or atherosclerotic changes in 47 patients (54.7%). At the time of surgery additional bypass grafting from the tube graft to one femoral artery was performed in four patients, and patch angioplasty to the CIA in one. Operative mortality was 4.6% (two patients) in the elective group, and 45.2% (19 patients) in the emergency operations. Follow-up was 94% complete for a mean of 4.1 (range 0.5-10) years). Late mortality for the whole series was 20.0% (12 patients). Only one patient died of a cause related to the AAA operation. All but one of the 48 late survivors are free of any peripheral vascular problems. We conclude that tube graft replacement of AAA is a good choice even in the presence of some degree of CIA atherosclerosis or aneurysmal dilatation.\r"

Best results are seen following early surgery with the balloon catheter but, in the clinical absence of tissue necrosis, late embolectomy is worthwhile. Atrial fibrillation and post-myocardial thrombus are the major sources of emboli, but tumour and septic emboli do occur and histological and bacteriological examination of retrieved material is essential. Patients who have sustained myocardial infarction have an increased risk of embolism in the first two weeks and despite modern therapy its incidence remains unchanged. Distinguishing true embolism from acute arterial thrombosis is a continuing problem and different surgical regimes for the two conditions are discussed. Embolectomy following anticoagulation has a high limb salvage rate and a low mortality; anti-coagulation as an adjuvant to surgery also improves prognosis for these patients who have lower amputation rates than those not anticoagulated.\r"

The healing process and neo-intima formation after implantation of this type of prosthesis was followed with light- and scanning electron microscopy. A total of 18 prostheses, which had been implanted for 1, 3, 6, 9 or 20 weeks were studied. Endothelial like cells invaded the prosthesis over the anastomoses, starting the first week after implantation. The growth zones advanced steadily, and prostheses measuring 3 cm in length were completely endothelialized by 20 weeks after implantation, a mean growth rate of the endothelial like cells of 0.09 mm/day. Subsequently, fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells grew between the neoendothelial layer and the prosthetic inner surface, forming a new multi-layered neo-intima. Cellular elements of the neo-intima were firmly anchored onto the inner wall of the prosthesis by cells with extending cytoplasmic protrusions between the fibers of the prosthetic wall. Since in this type of fibrous polyurethane prosthesis, endothelial like cells continually grew until a new lining was formed, apparently facilitated by the fibrous structure of the wall, further investigations are indicated for progression toward clinical implantation of this type of prosthesis.\r"

The specific purpose of this study is the evaluation of ankle Pressure Index (P.I.) and Pulse Volume Recorder (P.V.R.) wave amplitude changes after 5 and 10 minutes of external bypass compression by body weight, lying on the side of the reconstruction. Eight patients with axillo-femoral bypass (mean follow-up 15.5 months) have been evaluated. The external body weight compression caused important changes of graft haemodynamics: (1) decrease in ankle Pressure Index at 5 min (p less than 0.005) or 10 min (p less than 0.0005); (2) decrease in P.V.R. wave amplitude at 5 min (p less than 0.005) and 10 min (p less than 0.025).\r"
