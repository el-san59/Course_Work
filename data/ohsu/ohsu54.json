  ".W": "The effect of neuropeptide Y on the motor activity of the circular and longitudinal muscle of the guinea pig small intestine was investigated. Neuropeptide Y (0.3-30 nM) inhibited, in a concentration-dependent manner, the ascending enteric reflex contraction of the circular muscle; both the cholinergic and noncholinergic component of the ascending enteric reflex were suppressed. Neuropeptide Y also blocked nerve-mediated phasic contractions of the circular muscle, induced by dimethylphenylpiperazinium or ceruletide, and abolished the peristaltic movements of the small intestine. Nerve-mediated cholinergic and noncholinergic contractions of the longitudinal muscle, induced by electrical field stimulation, were only slightly depressed by neuropeptide Y. Further analysis showed that neuropeptide Y did not act directly on intestinal muscle but interrupted excitatory pathways of the enteric nervous system. The effect of neuropeptide Y did not involve activation of alpha-adrenoceptors, opioid receptors, or P1 purinoceptors or the release of endogenous factors stimulating these receptors. These findings suggest a possible physiologic role of neuropeptide Y as a nonnoradrenergic inhibitory transmitter involved in the enteric nervous control of intestinal circular muscle activity.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine the intrinsic functions of the feline pylorus in vitro. The myoelectric and pressure characteristics of the intact pylorus, antrum, and duodenum, free of extrinsic hormonal or neural influences, were studied in an in vitro bath that allowed separation of the bathing medium surrounding the different bowel segments. Basal recordings revealed a zone of tonic high pressure of 28.4 +/- 3.5 mmHg (mean +/- SEM) at the pylorus. The basal slow wave frequencies in the pylorus and duodenum were 2.8 +/- 1.4 and 12.6 +/- 0.6 cycles/min, respectively. Spontaneous action potential-associated phasic contractions of the pylorus were noted in 38% of preparations. Enteric nerve stimulation with direct electric current (10 Hz, 1 ms, 10-50 V) applied proximal to the pylorus gave relaxation of the pylorus at the lower voltages and rebound excitation at higher voltages. Electrical stimulation distal to the pylorus yielded phasic contractile pyloric response during the entire stimulus. The duodenal instillation of 0.5 N HCl produced action potential-associated phasic contractions of the pylorus and duodenum but not the antrum. Pyloric responses to electrical stimulation or acidification were abolished by tetrodotoxin (10(-5) M). Bethanechol (10(-6) M) or substance P (10(-7) M) produced a contractile response at the site of stimulation but this response was not transmitted to include adjacent bowel segments. These studies suggest that the pyloric sphincter with its intrinsic reflex properties can be studied in vitro.\r"

Hydrochloric acid (200 mM, 30 min in vivo; 10 mM, 10 min in vitro) caused a uniform damage of the mucosa confined to the villi. After demarcation and detachment of the necrotic tissue the defect was bridged by the remaining viable epithelial cells, resulting in a reduction of villus height. This process of mucosal repair proceeded continuously, so that 9 h after acid damage only 33% of villi in the proximal duodenum and 41% in the distal duodenum remained not fully restored, at both luminal pH 7 and luminal pH 3. The difference is due to the higher acid susceptibility of the distal duodenum. In vitro, most of the mucosal surface was reconstituted 5 h after acid injury, at both luminal pH 7.4 and luminal pH 3. The potential difference declined and reversed after mucosal damage; restitution to original values was only observed at luminal pH 7 in vivo and luminal pH 7.4 in vitro.\r"

Sodium-dependent D-glucose transport was examined in brush-border membrane vesicles derived from the proximal small bowel mucosa of male Sprague-Dawley rats 2 and 6 wk after a 66% distal jejunoileal resection or jejunoileal transection. Kinetic characteristics for the low-affinity, high-capacity system and high-affinity, low-capacity system were defined with rapid filtration under conditions of a zero-trans, 100 mM cis-NaSCN gradient. Mucosal weight, protein, and deoxyribonucleic acid content were increased in the residual intestinal segment compared to transected controls and morphometric studies revealed increased villus and crypt heights as well as an increased mitotic index. Postresection mean kinetic parameters for D-glucose transport at 2 wk (low-affinity system: Km, 177.5 +/- 45.1 microM; Vmax, 3.73 +/- 0.99 nmol X mg protein-1 X min-1; and high-affinity system: Km, 6.2 +/- 1.9 microM; Vmax, 0.12 +/- 0.06 nmol X mg protein-1 X min-1) and 6 wk (low-affinity system: Km, 267.8 +/- 83.1 microM; Vmax, 0.06 +/- 0.01 nmol X mg protein-1 X min-1; and high-affinity system: Km, 6.5 +/- 1.1 microM; Vmax, 0.06 +/- 0.01 nmol X mg protein-1 X min-1) were similar to values post-transection at 2 wk (low-affinity system: Km, 280.4 +/- 53.7 microM; Vmax, 3.05 +/- 0.32 nmol X mg protein-1 X min-1; and high-affinity system: Km, 9.1 +/- 1.3 microM; Vmax, 0.17 +/- 0.01 nmol X mg protein-1 X min-1) and 6 wk (low-affinity system: Km, 271.7 +/- 17.5 microM; Vmax, 4.69 +/- 0.23 nmol X protein-1 X min-1; and high-affinity system: Km, 10.6 +/- 4.2 microM; Vmax, 0.16 +/- 0.09 nmol X mg protein-1 X min-1). These kinetic data suggest that the hyperplastic response in adapting proximal small bowel after distal resection is accompanied by a persistence of the membrane functional characteristics for both sodium-dependent D-glucose transport systems despite an altered pattern of enterocyte proliferation and differentiation.\r"

Twenty-four-hour pH profiles were measured while the subjects were ambulatory using a combined glass electrode connected to a portable recorder. In 8 of the smoking volunteers, swallowing frequency and salivary secretion were measured, both when smoking and when not. Smokers had more reflux episodes than nonsmokers [median per hour 2.8 (range 0.4-7.1) for the upright body position and 0.5 (range 0.0-1.7) for the supine body position vs. 1.4 (range 0.0-2.1) upright and 0.0 (range 0.0-0.7) supine, p less than 0.01], but the total time of exposure of the esophageal mucosa to acid was affected neither by the status of being a smoker nor by actual smoking. Nasopharyngeal intubation with the pH electrode did not affect the swallowing frequency, but it increased salivary secretion two-to threefold for a period of 4 h. Six hours after introduction of the pH electrode and later, salivary flow was similar to baseline. It is concluded that smoking and nasopharyngeal intubation does not adversely affect the results of 24-h pH-metry.\r"

  ".W": "Sulfasalazine suppresses mucosal injury in patients with ulcerative colitis, but the mechanism of its therapeutic action is uncertain. In the present study, we examined the mechanism of the protective action of sulfasalazine in a rat model in which colonic epithelial cell loss and subsequent increases in epithelial proliferative activity were induced by intracolonic instillation of sodium deoxycholate. Sulfasalazine or its therapeutically active metabolite 5-aminosalicylic acid suppressed the loss of deoxyribonucleic acid into the colonic lumen and the subsequent increases in mucosal ornithine decarboxylase activity and tritiated thymidine incorporation into deoxyribonucleic acid induced by sodium deoxycholate. Sulfasalazine and 5-aminosalicylic acid also blocked xanthine-xanthine oxidase-induced loss of deoxyribonucleic acid and the subsequent proliferative response. In vitro sodium deoxycholate increased reactive oxygen formation by colonic mucosal scrapings or isolated crypt epithelium. These actions of sodium deoxycholate on reactive oxygen formation were blocked by sulfasalazine or 5-aminosalicylic acid. Sulfapyridine, a therapeutically inactive metabolite of sulfasalazine, had no effect on sodium deoxycholate-induced increases in surface cell sloughing, ornithine decarboxylase, tritiated thymidine incorporation into deoxyribonucleic acid, chemiluminescence, or superoxide production. The ability of sulfasalazine and 5-aminosalicylic acid to scavenge reactive oxygen may play a role in their therapeutic effects of inflammatory bowel disease.\r"

Both systems view the procedure on a monitor. The systems were \"bench\" tested in an electronics laboratory to objectively compare resolution, brightness (luminosity), and color intensity (chroma). Clinical comparison was performed in 619 patients. Both video endoscopy systems provided significant advantages over fiberoptic endoscopes in therapeutic procedures, teaching, and documentation. The direct video system provided the best overall video image; the indirect system had a slightly diminished resolution and luminosity in both the \"bench\" test and clinical evaluation.\r"

The response rate was 61% overall and 100% from New York and San Francisco. Our results revealed a broad spectrum of perceived risk and precautions. Seventy-three percent of respondents believed that endoscopy places personnel at risk for contracting AIDS. At 35% of institutions endoscopic procedures are exclusively or frequently performed at the bedside of the patient with AIDS. At 46% of institutions procedures on patients with AIDS are performed with instruments used only in these patients. Endoscopic equipment used in patients with AIDS is gas sterilized at 85% of institutions. One third of respondents noted reluctance of personnel to participate in endoscopy for patients with AIDS. Reluctance was related to the respondent's perception of risk and did not differ among nurses, fellows, attendings, and gastrointestinal assistants. These data indicate that concern regarding transmission of the AIDS virus during endoscopy has resulted in costly and inefficient endoscopic practices.\r"

Although S. newport was never recovered from the four colonoscopes used during the outbreak, cultures of one of the colonic biopsy forceps grew S. newport. Contamination of the equipment most likely occurred during colonoscopy of the index patient. Inadequate disinfection of the equipment allowed the organism to survive and possibly to cross-contaminate other colonoscopes, and the organism was then transmitted to other patients by use of the contaminated colonoscopes or the contaminated biopsy forceps. Implemented control measures terminated the outbreak.\r"

Hypertension in the elderly, either systolic or diastolic, increases the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as much as it does for younger patients. Three large, controlled clinical trials have shown that diuretic-based stepped care therapy will reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality for patients 60 years of age and older who have diastolic hypertension. In general, elderly patients tolerate antihypertensive drugs as well as younger patients do, and they are as compliant as younger patients. As yet, there is no evidence from controlled trials that drug treatment reduces the risk for patients with isolated systolic hypertension.\r"

Comparison was made with a group of patients with normal hepatic function. Elimination half-lives after the intravenous dose were slightly prolonged in the cirrhotics (n = 10; 4.2 +/- 0.6 h) compared with the control (n = 8; 2.7 +/- 0.2 h: p less than 0.05) and NCLD (n = 8; 3.2 +/- 0.5 h) groups. There was no significant difference in meptazinol plasma clearance between the groups (cirrhotics = 72 +/- 8 l/h; NCLD = 89 +/- 9 l/h; control = 83 +/- 10 l/h). After the oral dose, seven of 15 cirrhotic patients vomited but only one patient in each of the other groups was unable to tolerate the drug (p = 0.06). This may be explained by very much higher peak meptazinol concentrations in the cirrhotic (n = 8; 184 +/- 37 ng/ml, p less than 0.01) and NCLD (n = 8; 131 +/- 38 ng/ml, p less than 0.05) patients than those of the controls (n = 7; 53 +/- 12 ng/ml) reflecting a mean four-fold and two-fold increase in oral bioavailability respectively (cirrhotics: n = 8; 27.9 +/- 5.3%: p less than 0.001; NCLD: n = 7; 13.7 +/- 3.9% p less than 0.05; controls: n = 7; 6.5 +/- 1.3%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the present study we have compared the colonic metabolism of the two sugars using an in vitro faecal incubation system. Both sugars were readily metabolised by faecal bacteria producing volatile fatty acids and the metabolism was inhibited by neomycin. The effect of lactitol and lactulose on terminal ileal and colonic pH was monitored in six normal subjects using a radiotelemetry technique. Both sugars significantly lowered right colonic pH (basal -6.51 +/- 0.48 vs lactitol -5.63 +/- 0.50; lactulose -5.18 +/- 0.82, p less than 0.05). The pH of rest of the colon and terminal ileum was unaffected. Neomycin given concurrently with lactulose abolished acidification of right colon. As lactitol and lactulose have similar effects within the colon, lactitol would appear to have a role in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy. As neomycin antagonises the effect of lactulose in the colon, its concurrent use may be less effective in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy.\r"

In cirrhotics, mean (+/- SD) wedged hepatic (25.8 +/- 6.4 mmHg), intrahepatic (24.5 +/- 6.2 mmHg) and intrasplenic (25.0 +/- 5.6 mmHg) pressures correlated significantly (p less than 0.001) with intravariceal (25.2 +/- 6.7) pressure measurements. In patients with NCPF, mean (+/- SD) wedged hepatic (9.1 +/- 3.7 mmHg) and intraphepatic (15.4 +/- 5.8 mmHg) pressures were significantly (p less than 0.01) lower than the intrasplenic (24.5 +/- 4.2 mmHg) and intravariceal (23.96 +/- 5.6 mmHg) pressures. Two independent pressure gradients, one between intrasplenic and intrahepatic pressure (8.9 +/- 6.5 mmHg) and another between intrahepatic and wedged hepatic venous pressure (6.2 +/- 5.6 mmHg) were seen in non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis patients, indicating the likelihood of both pre- and perisinusoidal resistance to flow of portal venous blood in these patients. A highly significant (p less than 0.001) correlation between intravariceal and intrasplenic pressures was found in patients with cirrhosis of liver (r = 0.93), as well as in patients with non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis (r = 0.85). No correlation was found between the size of oesophageal varices and wedged hepatic and intrahepatic pressures. Patients with grade 4 varices had significantly higher intravariceal (p less than 0.01) and intrasplenic (p less than 0.05) pressure than patients with grade 2 varices.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The technique was effective--only two stones could not be shattered. Electrohydraulic lithotripsy power requirement correlated with mechanical strength of stones, but not with biochemical composition. A trend toward higher power requirement was recorded with larger stones and stones over 2 cm in diameter could not be fragmented. Safety studies indicated that electrohydraulic lithotripsy was safe, provided the probe tip was not in contact with the bile duct wall. In vivo studies did not show any late effects after 10 days. Electrohydraulic lithotripsy is likely to be useful in the management of biliary calculi.\r"

  ".W": "Oesophageal motor responses to intraluminal distension were studied manometrically in 16 healthy volunteers and in nine patients with disordered swallowing, who had prolonged oesophageal clearance without structural abnormality. In the normal subjects distension was associated with an increased number of secondary contractions above the balloon, decrease of all contractile activity below the balloon and was accompanied by an aborally propulsive force which occurred independently of the perception of discomfort. Cholinergic blockade abolished the proximal distension induced contractile response, but did not affect primary peristalsis. Despite normal sensory thresholds, proximal excitatory responses to distension were absent in six and distal inhibition was absent in seven patients. These results show that the normal human oesophagus responds to distension with a proximal enhancement of propulsive motor activity, mediated through a cholinergic pathway. This may be defective in some patients with disordered oesophageal transit. Investigation of the motor responses to intraluminal distension may thus be a useful adjunct to standard manometry for studying patients with suspected oesophageal clearance dysfunction and might allow identification of disordered enteric nervous control.\r"

Before vagotomy gastric acid output in response to modified sham feeding was significantly higher than basal acid secretion in all subjects tested and reached about 45% of the pentagastrin maximum. No difference in the increase in acid response, or in the pancreatic polypeptide response to modified sham feeding was found between patients with high and low basal secretion. Plasma gastrin concentration was unaltered by modified sham feeding before and after truncal vagotomy or parietal cell vagotomy, although after vagotomy it tended to reach higher values than before this procedure. After truncal vagotomy, basal pancreatic polypeptide concentration was decreased and modified sham feeding-induced pancreatic polypeptide increment was completely eliminated. Four weeks after parietal cell vagotomy, the modified sham feeding-induced increment in plasma pancreatic polypeptide was significantly decreased and observed only in seven of 12 patients. Four to five years after parietal cell vagotomy all subjects responded to modified sham feeding with pancreatic polypeptide increment similar to that before vagotomy and in three of 12 patients acid response to modified sham feeding was seen. This study indicates that truncal vagotomy eliminates gastric acid and plasma pancreatic polypeptide responses to vagal excitation while parietal cell vagotomy abolishes gastric acid response and reduces temporarily the pancreatic polypeptide response to modified sham feeding (possibly because of transient impairment of the vagal innervation of the pancreas).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In smokers, basal serum amylase and immunoreactive pancreatic elastase 2 (IRE2) concentrations were about 100% and 25% higher respectively, than in the non-smokers, whereas, no differences were observed in basal immunoreactive cationic trypsinogen (IRCT) concentrations and in acid phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase activities between the two groups. Furthermore, a single injection of secretin to cigarette smokers significantly increased serum amylase, IRCT and IRE2 by 155%, 200%, and 100%, respectively when compared with their corresponding basal levels. No such increment was observed in the non-smokers. In addition, there were no significant differences in serum trypsin or elastase inhibitory capacity or immunoreactive alpha 1-protease inhibitor and alpha 2-macroglobulin levels between smokers and non-smokers. The levels and inhibitory capacity of these protease inhibitors was also not affected by secretin injection. These data suggest that cigarette smoking enhances the responsiveness of the exocrine pancreas to a physiological stimulus such as secretin, with resultant substantial increase in the concentrations of pancreatic hydrolases in blood.\r"

It is of value for the management of patients with ulcerative colitis but may be associated with increasing diarrhoea in a few. This study examines the effect of 5-ASA and ADS on small intestinal transport systems of the rat. Krebs-Ringer-bicarbonate solution was circulated through the lumen of a jejunal segment and the appearance of fluid, glucose and lactate on the serosal surface was shown to be linear over a two hour period. Addition of 5-ASA (10 mmol/l) or ADS (5 mmol/l and 10 mmol/l) caused a significant inhibition both of fluid transport (p less than 0.001), and of the appearance of glucose (p less than 0.001) and lactate (p less than 0.001 for 5 mmol/l and 10 mmol/l ADS, p less than 0.01 for 10 mmol/l 5-ASA). The uptake of glucose by rings of rat jejunum was shown to be markedly reduced by ADS. Experiments substituting glucose with either sucrose of 2-aminoisobutyric acid showed that ADS (5 mmol/l, 10 mmol/l) also inhibited the serosal appearance of fructose and the amino acid. These results show that 5-ASA and ADS, at concentrations which could be expected in the jejunum of patients receiving therapeutic doses, are able to inhibit small intestinal transport systems. The resulting increase in load on the diseased colon could be important for the pathogenesis of diarrhoea.\r"

The rectal volume required to cause the desire to defecate and the maximum tolerated volume were lower in the elderly, but the corresponding rectal pressures were similar, indicating the sensations were mediated by tension, or pressure receptors. Rectal contractions were generated at similar degrees of rectal distension. A lower proportion of elderly, compared with young subjects could defecate a sphere 18 mm in diameter within 20 seconds. The degree of perineal descent was greater in the elderly female subjects compared with the young women, although there was no difference in this measurement between men. The anorectal angle was similar in young and old. The changes in anorectal function in the elderly would tend to make them more susceptible to faecal incontinence.\r"

The blood flow volume was measured in 20 patients with liver disease using an ultrasonic duplex system (Toshiba SAL50A/SDL-01A). The portal venous pressure was also measured via a 3F catheter using a transducer. The catheter was placed in position by substituting it for a 25-gauge needle that had been inserted into the portal vein under ultrasonic guidance percutaneously and transhepatically. Splenic arterial occlusion caused a drop in splenic venous blood flow from 708 +/- 487 to 241 +/- 155 ml per min, in portal venous blood flow from 993 +/- 439 to 807 +/- 419 ml per min and in portal venous pressure from 17.4 +/- 7.2 to 14.4 +/- 6.1 mm Hg. The latter two reductions were less than expected from the decrease in the splenic venous blood flow volume. This phenomenon was caused by an increase in the mesenteric venous blood flow from 475 +/- 126 to 630 +/- 270 mm per min. This increase may be due to a compensatory mechanism under the control of a regulatory loop in the liver or portal vein, and there seems to be a relationship between splenic and intestinal circulation in portal hypertension that maintains hepatic circulation.\r"

The permeability-surface area products to the diffusion-limited tracers, sucrose and methylaminoisobutyric acid, were determined as a measure of blood-brain barrier permeability. Animals were examined 24, 36 and 42 hr after injection, at times when they were stuporous, but not comatose. No significant elevations of the permeability-surface area products for either compound were detected in clinically affected experimental animals when compared to controls. Our results indicate there is no generalized increase in brain vascular permeability during hepatic insufficiency in precomatose animals.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic significance of functional changes in the liver during progression of cirrhosis. Liver function was quantitated weekly by the aminopyrine breath test (measuring microsomal function) and the galactose breath test (measuring cytosolic function) in rats made cirrhotic by bile duct ligation (n = 14) and in sham-surgery controls (n = 9). Nine rats died spontaneously of cirrhosis. Both the aminopyrine breath test and galactose breath test were sensitive (89%) predictors of death within 1 week, but the galactose breath test was more specific (83%). Morphometric measurements of livers from surviving cirrhotic animals and controls (n = 5 each) showed that mean hepatocyte mass was maintained in the cirrhotic livers [cirrhosis (17.0 +/- 2.0) vs. controls (13.9 +/- 0.9 gm)]. The galactose breath test was also maintained, whereas the aminopyrine breath test was significantly decreased in the surviving cirrhotics. The galactose breath test, but not the aminopyrine breath test, correlated with hepatocyte mass (r = 0.67). The aminopyrine breath test correlated with microsomal aminopyrine N-demethylase activity (r = 0.78). Serial use of quantitative liver tests allows prediction of time of death from cirrhosis in this model.\r"

Results were compared with those in 10 patients with biopsy-proven chronic active hepatitis with bridging and/or cirrhosis and in 22 healthy subjects. The aminopyrine breath test results in the 10 cholestatic patients with cirrhosis were not significantly different from the results in precirrhotic cholestatic patients (mean +/- S.D., 11.2 +/- 5.0 vs. 11.6 +/- 2.8% dose per 2 hr, p greater than 0.05) or healthy subjects (11.5 +/- 2.9% dose per 2 hr). In contrast, the results in the patients with chronic hepatitis were markedly depressed (3.2 +/- 1.9% dose per 2 hr, p less than 0.05). The aminopyrine breath test results did not correlate with results of conventional liver function tests in the cholestatic patients. These results demonstrate that the aminopyrine breath test is not clinically useful in identifying the presence of cirrhosis in patients with cholestatic liver disease, and provide further evidence that decreased microsomal enzyme function is a late feature of cholestatic liver disease.\r"

Experiments were designed to determine whether acetaldehyde, the first metabolite of ethanol oxidation, mediated the ethanol-induced secretory defect in rats with normal and stimulated (inflammation-induced) rates of hepatic protein secretion. This study used cyanamide, an aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor, to correlate enhanced acetaldehyde levels with an increased ethanol-induced inhibition of hepatic protein secretion. Inflammation was induced by turpentine 24 hr prior to cyanamide (5 mg per kg body weight) or saline pretreatment. Nonfasted rats were intragastrically gavaged with ethanol (4 to 6 gm per kg body weight) or isocaloric glucose 1 hr following pretreatment. [3H]Fucose and/or [14C]leucine were injected intravenously 2 hr following intubation. With elevated levels of acetaldehyde, the ethanol-induced impairment of secretion of labeled proteins and their parallel retention in the liver were markedly potentiated. During inflammation, this inhibition of secretion by ethanol was maintained and further increased with cyanamide pretreatment. These results indicate that the ethanol-induced impairment of hepatic glycoprotein secretion is mediated by acetaldehyde in both normal and inflammation-stimulated animals.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic ethanol feeding increases hepatic turnover and sinusoidal efflux of glutathione in rats. The present study was performed to determine whether the observed increase in glutathione efflux was due to increased extrahepatic requirements for glutathione. The concentration and disposition of plasma glutathione were determined in rats fed liquid diets containing 36% of calories as ethanol or pair-fed an isocaloric mixture with carbohydrate replacing ethanol calories for 5 to 8 weeks. The half-life and plasma clearance of [35S]glutathione were found to be similar in ethanol-fed and control rats and in rats withdrawn 24 hr from ethanol. Uptakes of the sulfur moiety of [35S]glutathione by kidney, jejunal mucosa, liver, lung, spleen, muscle and heart were also unchanged by ethanol feeding. The plasma glutathione concentration was significantly higher in ethanol-withdrawn rats 22.30 +/- 3.06 nmoles per ml (p less than 0.05) compared to pair-fed controls (13.51 +/- 2.04), while rats continuing to drink ethanol had intermediate levels (16.96 +/- 2.22). Plasma cysteine levels were slightly, but not significantly, higher in ethanol-fed rats. These findings suggest that increased sinusoidal efflux of glutathione in ethanol-fed rats is due to a direct effect of ethanol on hepatic glutathione transport and not due to an alteration in extrahepatic disposition of glutathione. In order to characterize further the effects of ethanol feeding on glutathione-dependent detoxification, activities of glutathione S-transferase, glutathione reductase and gamma-glutamyltransferase were determined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Primary monolayer cultures of rat hepatocytes at confluence were exposed to an exogenously added source of superoxide, and its influence on collagen synthesis was examined. Superoxide was generated by the addition of dihydroxyfumarate to the culture medium. Exposure of hepatocytes to dihydroxyfumarate greatly stimulated the activity of prolyl hydroxylase and the synthesis of collagen. A significant increase in prolyl hydroxylase activity was observed with 5 micrograms per ml dihydroxyfumarate in 24 hr relative to that in the untreated cultures. Maximum stimulation of greater than 3-fold compared to the control value was elicited by 25 micrograms per ml dihydroxyfumarate. When scavengers of superoxide such as superoxide dismutase and Cu(Lys)2 were added in the medium, the increase in prolyl hydroxylase activity induced by dihydroxyfumarate was nearly abolished. Experiments with actinomycin D indicated that synthesis of new RNA was involved in the stimulation of prolyl hydroxylase activity. Analysis of collagen synthesis in cultures exposed to dihydroxyfumarate also showed a marked increase compared to that of the untreated cultures. The presence of superoxide dismutase in the medium significantly reduced the increase in collagen synthesis. Our results indicate that superoxide mediates the stimulation of collagen synthesis in hepatocytes. These findings may provide a possible explanation for excess collagen formation during induced liver fibrosis.\r"

We have measured the activities of carnitine acetyltransferase and fatty acylCoA oxidase, and the amount of 60 and 80 kD polypeptides as biochemical markers of the peroxisomal function; laurate hydroxylase and cytochrome P-450 as markers of the endoplasmic reticulum; and carnitine palmitoyltransferase as a marker of mitochondria in primary cultures of hepatocytes. Ciprofibrate (0.01 to 0.3 mM) and clofibric acid (0.1 to 3 mM) produced similar changes in several components of cultured hepatocytes within 72 hr. Increases of protein (18 and 11%), carnitine palmitoyltransferase (23 and 97%), cytochrome P-450 (37 and 49%), carnitine acetyltransferase (484 and 614%), fatty acylCoA oxidase (529 and 931%) and laurate hydroxylase (624 and 671%) were obtained in hepatocytes after a 72-hr exposure to 0.1 mM ciprofibrate and 1.0 mM clofibric acid, respectively. In cultured hepatocytes, ciprofibrate was about 30-fold more active than clofibric acid for the stimulation of carnitine acetyltransferase, laurate hydroxylase and fatty acylCoA oxidase activities. Ciprofibrate was also more potent than clofibric acid as an inducer of the 60 and 80 kD proteins in hepatocytes. The maximal drug-induced increases in carnitine acetyltransferase activity were not additive, and the induction of carnitine acetyltransferase by ciprofibrate was blocked by addition (1 micrograms per ml) of cycloheximide or actinomycin D. Changes in protein and RNA synthesis preceded the drug-induced increases of carnitine acetyltransferase activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have been using oral zinc as another approach to the therapy for Wilson's disease, with copper balance studies as the key initial assessment of the adequacy of a given dose or regimen of zinc therapy. We earlier reported that an intensive regimen of zinc (zinc taken every 4 hr) was effective in controlling copper balance. We have now shown with balance studies that a simplified zinc therapy regimen of 50 mg zinc taken 3 times per day is effective in controlling copper balance. Preliminary work presented here with other simplified regimens also indicate their effectiveness. These studies increase the data base, in terms of copper balance, for zinc therapy of Wilson's disease, and expand the dose range and regimens of zinc which have been shown to control copper balance.\r"

  ".W": "Rabbits fed a diet rich in oleic acid develop gallstones consisting of calcium salts of (5 alpha)-glyco-allodeoxycholic acid. To study the metabolic pathway of oleic acid, we followed the changes in plasma, hepatic and biliary lipids in this animal model. In addition, to also determine the role played by intestinal microflora on biliary lipid metabolism, we added kanamycin to the oleic acid diet. Oleic acid-fed rabbits rapidly developed hypercholesterolemia. This was associated with an increase in liver 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity, accumulation of cholesterol as well as cholestanol in the liver and progressive saturation of cholesterol in bile. [14C]oleic acid fed orally to rabbits was recovered in liver extracts as both cholesterol and cholestanol. With oleic acid feeding, there was a progressive increase in glyco-allodeoxycholic acid culminating in the formation of gallstones. Kanamycin supplement to the oleic acid diet resulted in the same changes in plasma and hepatic sterol metabolism compared with oleic acid-fed rabbits. There was, however, a striking difference in the biliary bile acid profile. Kanamycin supplementation dramatically reduced the proportion of 5 alpha-dihydroxy bile acids, increased the proportion of 5 beta-trihydroxy bile acids and completely abolished gallstone formation. We postulate that, in the rabbit, oleic acid is used as a carbon source for cholesterol synthesis, and a high oleic acid diet increases hepatic cholesterogenesis. Hepatic cholesterol is then metabolized to form cholestanol, followed by (5 alpha)-glyco-allocholic acid which is secreted into bile and transformed by gut bacteria to form (5 alpha)-allodeoxycholic acid. Kanamycin abolished gallstone formation by inhibiting intestinal bacterial dehydroxylation.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of sulfation of common bile acids on the formation of bile was investigated in male rats by infusing them with the sulfate esters of cholic, chenodeoxycholic, deoxycholic, lithocholic or dehydrocholic acid in four step-wise, increasing doses. Each dose was infused for 30 min and bile collected every 10 min. Control studies were performed by using either albumin solution (the bile acid carrier) or corresponding nonsulfated bile acids at concentrations similar to those of the sulfated products. The secretion of sulfated bile acids was slower and less than that of nonsulfated bile acids, demonstrating transport maximum kinetics rather than the secretory rate maximum characteristic of nonsulfated bile acids. Sulfation significantly increased bile salt-independent bile flow and the choleretic potency of the bile acids tested. With the exception of deoxycholic acid, which had a slight stimulatory effect, bile acid sulfation generally prevented a rise in bile acid-dependent phospholipid and cholesterol secretion. In fact, it reduced biliary phospholipid and cholesterol secretion associated with the secretion of endogenous bile acids. These data are in agreement with the physicochemical properties of sulfated bile acids. They indicate that sulfation prevents the cholestatic action of nonsulfated bile acids, perhaps by increasing bile flow via a high choleretic potential and/or by stimulating bile acid-independent bile flow. The effect of sulfated bile acids on the secretion of biliary phospholipids may protect the canalicular membrane from the detergent properties of bile acids and may thus block the cholestasis which results from high, nonsulfated bile acid concentrations.\r"

KMCH-1 cells produced tumors several months after subcutaneous and intraperitoneal transplantations into athymic nude mice. Histologically, the subcutaneous tumors were poorly differentiated adrenocarcinoma, while intraperitoneal tumors were moderately to well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. Hepatocellular carcinoma components were not observed. Thus, KMCH-1 cells demonstrate the feature of cholangiocellular carcinoma in vitro and in vivo. This KMCH-1 cell line is the first established combined hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma cell line and may contribute to further investigation of combined hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma.\r"

Patients with acute hepatitis B and those with acute hepatitis B virus-hepatitis delta virus coinfection did not differ significantly with respect to the serological profile of hepatitis B virus DNA and final clinical outcome. Within the group of HBsAg carriers with hepatitis delta virus superinfection, all patients who were initially negative for hepatitis B virus DNA developed chronic hepatitis delta virus infection, whereas 3 of the 4 patients with active hepatitis B virus infection at the time of superinfection showed transient inhibition of hepatitis B virus replication followed by termination of hepatitis delta virus infection in two patients.

In 25 healthy subjects, arterial pressure, heart rate, and muscle sympathetic nerve activity were measured with microelectrodes inserted percutaneously into a peroneal muscle nerve fascicle in the leg during immersion of the hand in ice water for 2 minutes. Arterial pressure rose steadily during the first and second minutes of the cold pressor test. Muscle sympathetic activity (burst frequency X amplitude) did not increase in the first 30 seconds of the test but increased from 230 +/- 27 to 386 +/- 52 units (mean +/- SE, p less than 0.05) by the end of the first minute of the test and to 574 +/- 73 (p less than 0.01) during the second minute. In contrast, heart rate increased maximally during the first 30 seconds of the cold pressor test and returned to control during the second minute. The increases in heart rate were abolished by beta-adrenergic blockade. The increases in muscle sympathetic activity during the cold pressor test were correlated with the increases in both mean arterial pressure (r = 0.86, p less than 0.01) and peripheral venous norepinephrine (r = 0.72, p less than 0.05); however, large changes in nerve traffic were associated with small changes in plasma norepinephrine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A randomized, double-blind clinical trial was used to assess blood pressure response to orally administered potassium, 120 mEq/day, and to placebo in 101 adults with mild hypertension. Blood pressure was measured with a random-zero sphygmomanometer every 2 weeks of this 8-week trial. Systolic blood pressure in the potassium-treated group decreased by 6.4 +/- 13.7 (SD) mm Hg (p less than or equal to 0.025) compared with 0.11 +/- 13.0 mm Hg in the placebo-treated group (p = 0.96). Diastolic blood pressure in the potassium-treated group decreased by 4.1 +/- 8.3 mm Hg (p less than or equal to 0.05) compared with a 1.6 +/- 6.5 mm Hg decrease in placebo-treated subjects (p = 0.09). Baseline blood pressure of potassium-treated subjects was unexpectedly higher than that of controls. After correcting for baseline variation, blood pressure still decreased 3.4/1.8 mm Hg more in potassium recipients than in placebo recipients (p = 0.14 and 0.24, respectively). Blood pressure decreased by 19/13 mm Hg in five blacks taking potassium versus a 1/0 mm Hg increase in seven blacks taking placebo. Compliance with the potassium regimen was 91.5% by pill count; only one subject discontinued treatment because of side effects. In conclusion, 120 mEq/day of microencapsulated potassium chloride was well tolerated in adults with mild hypertension. An antihypertensive effect of potassium cannot be ruled out despite the fact that there was no statistically significant difference between potassium-treated and placebo-treated subjects after adjustment for differences in baseline blood pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Li+-Na+ countertransport activity was positively and significantly correlated with subject-determined home systolic blood pressure (r = 0.31, p less than 0.02) and with directly measured systolic (r = 0.29, p less than 0.02) and diastolic (r = 0.27, p less than 0.03) blood pressures in the hemodynamic laboratory, independent of potential confounding variables. Analysis of the hemodynamic determinants of blood pressure revealed a significant positive correlation of countertransport with vascular resistance (r = 0.30, p less than 0.02) but not with cardiac output or cardiac index. High red blood cell Na+-K+ cotransport activity was not independently associated with hypertension or with a characteristic hemodynamic pattern but was related to decreased venous compliance. Red blood cell Li+-Na+ countertransport deserves further study as a marker for the genetic substrate of human essential hypertension. Red cell Na+-K+ cotransport may be altered secondarily by factors related to high blood pressure and seems to be a valid marker for abnormalities of the venous system in hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the mechanism of blunted sympathetic reflex responses in early renovascular hypertension, we measured inotropic and chronotropic responses of the heart to beta-adrenergic stimulation in vivo and myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor number and adenylate cyclase activity in 10 dogs during an early stage of one-kidney renal hypertension. Mean aortic pressure was higher in the hypertensive dogs (152 +/- 4 mm Hg) than in eight sham-operated dogs (122 +/- 1 mm Hg; p less than 0.001), but heart rate, cardiac output, and left atrial pressure did not differ between the two groups. Blood pressure reduction with a direct-acting vasodilator, pinacidil, resulted in marked increases in heart rate (+97 +/- 12 beats/min) and rate of change of left ventricular pressure (dP/dt; +1447 +/- 367 mm Hg/sec) in normotensive dogs but only blunted heart rate (+54 +/- 12 beats/min) and minimal left ventricular dP/dt (+376 +/- 264 mm Hg/sec) responses in hypertensive dogs. In contrast, intravenously administered isoproterenol produced similar increases in heart rate and left ventricular dP/dt in the two groups. These two groups also did not differ in either left ventricular beta-adrenergic receptor number and affinity or basal, isoproterenol-stimulated, and fluoride-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. Thus, despite blunted reflex responses to blood pressure reduction, hypertensive dogs showed neither reduction in chronotropic and inotropic responses to direct beta-adrenergic stimulation nor beta-adrenergic desensitization of the myocardium, as assessed by beta-adrenergic receptor number and adenylate cyclase activity. Blunted reflex responses in this model of early hypertension must be due to factors operating at some locus other than the beta-adrenergic receptor-adenylate cyclase complex.\r"

  ".W": "We recently reported that the vagal cardiopulmonary baroreceptor reflex inhibition of renal nerve traffic is impaired in rabbits with renal hypertension. The purpose of this study was to determine if the locus of the abnormality is mainly in the brain or in the afferent limb of the reflex. Experiments were done in alpha-chloralose-anesthetized rabbits with (n = 10) or without (n = 10) hypertension induced 6 to 8 weeks before study by wrapping the left kidney in cellophane followed by removal of the right kidney. The left side of the chest was opened, and a pericardial cradle was made. Nicotine was applied to the epicardial surface of the heart in concentrations of 10 to 500 micrograms/ml, and changes in arterial pressure and renal nerve traffic were measured. Dose-dependent decreases in traffic and arterial pressure resulted that were significantly smaller in hypertensive than in normotensive rabbits. After sinoaortic baroreceptor denervation, a similar impairment in the responses of hypertensive rabbits was observed. Vagotomy nearly abolished the responses of the renal nerves to epicardial nicotine. The responses of the lumbar sympathetic nerves to epicardial nicotine also were impaired in renal hypertensive (n = 8) compared with normotensive rabbits (n = 8). If the behavior and number of chemically sensitive endings are assumed to be unaltered in hypertension, then these findings are explained best by an abnormality in the central nervous system. These results support the view that the previously reported impairment in the vagal cardiopulmonary baroreceptor reflex control of renal nerve traffic is due mainly to a central abnormality, although they do not exclude an abnormality in the afferent limb of the reflex.\r"

Weanling (4-week-old) male and female SHRSP and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) received either the antihypertensive combination treatment of hydralazine plus hydrochlorothiazide in drinking water or tap water alone (controls) for 15 weeks. Whereas the antihypertensive combination prevented the development of hypertension in treated SHRSP (SHRSP-T), blood pressure remained unchanged in treated WKY (WKY-T). Femoral arterial smooth muscle responsiveness to KCl, norepinephrine, and calcium (in the presence of either 40 mM KCl or 1 microM norepinephrine) was not altered in SHRSP when compared with WKY. A significant increase in the sensitivity of femoral arteries to KCl and calcium (in the presence of 40 mM KCl) was seen, however, in SHRSP-T and WKY-T. An increased sensitivity to norepinephrine and calcium (in the presence of 1 microM norepinephrine) was seen only in SHRSP-T. Isoproterenol-induced relaxation was significantly attenuated in both SHRSP and SHRSP-T. Relaxation induced by sodium nitroprusside and calcium (membrane stabilization) was not different between the four groups. These results show that femoral arterial smooth muscle responsiveness to vasoconstrictor stimuli is not altered in SHRSP but that beta-adrenergic-mediated relaxation is attenuated. Antihypertensive treatment resulted in an enhanced responsiveness to these vasoconstrictor stimuli but had no effect on the relaxation properties of femoral arterial smooth muscle.\r"

Monitors recorded hydrostatic pressures simultaneously in the arterial, venous and filtrate lines during varying plasma or blood flow rates and predilution (vs postdilution) replacement fluid flow rates. Similar hydrostatic pressure monitoring was carried out during multiple maneuvers to generate suction on the filtrate side of the hemofilter (Amicon D-20's and Renaflo's). With a plasma flow (Qp) of 100 cc/min and predilution replacement fluid infusion rate of 500 cc/hr, the arterial pressure was 5% greater than during postdilution (p less than 0.05). With a blood flow (Qb) of 50 cc/min, predilution fluid replacement rates of 500 and 1000 cc/hr, and vacuum suction applied to the filtrate compartment, the arterial pressure was 33% lower than during postdilution fluid replacement (p less than 0.03). Nonetheless, the ultrafiltration rate (UFR) was 10 to 30% higher (p less than 0.03). At many other combinations of Qp, Qb and replacement rates and modes, there were no significant changes in arterial pressure. Despite these arterial pressure changes, greater than 70% of the transmembrane hydrostatic pressure (TMP) was due to the negative pressure induced by filtrate suction (gravity, Gomco, wall suction, IMED). The actual pressure in the filtrate compartment measured during Gomco or wall suction was 3/4 of that stated by their gauges, presumably due to leakage. Maximum wall suction never generated TMP's greater than 150 mmHg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The S80-T lead had a significantly lower implantation threshold. The differences between the two leads in sensing properties, in current flow at threshold voltage and at the output of the generator were not significant at implantation. The 412-S lead had a higher impedance measurement than the S-80-T at implantation but this was mainly due to the resistance differences of the conductors rather than to electrode-patient interactions. A subgroup of 20 patients had chronic threshold measurements. The S 80-T lead had a significantly lower chronic voltage threshold. However because the acute and chronic differences are small we conclude that, although these differences are statistically significant, they are not clinically significant. Both can justifiably be termed 'high-performance' leads.\r"

  ".W": "The transient ventilatory responses to hypercapnia were studied in nine healthy preterm infants. We administered 4% CO2 in air for at least 7 min during quiet sleep and measured frequency (f), inspiratory time (TI), expiratory time (TE), tidal volume (VT), and minute ventilation (VI). Frequency increased over the first 2 min of CO2 inhalation (P less than 0.05) and then decreased to control values (P less than 0.05). This response was secondary to changes in TE, which decreased over the first 2 min (P less than 0.05) and then returned to control values, whereas TI did not change. The late increase in TE was associated with an increased percent of breaths exhibiting retardation of expiratory flow (braking) (P less than 0.05). These breaths had longer TE than the breaths without braking (P less than 0.05). Exponential curves made to fit the increases in VI and VT revealed that only 67% of the infants reached 90% of steady state for both VI and VT over the 7-min study period. The time to 90% of steady state was always shorter for VI than VT (P less than 0.05) due to the transient changes in f. The results indicate that the transient changes of f in response to hypercapnia are secondary to changes in TE, which appear unique to human infants. We speculate that the expiratory braking that develops during the course of CO2 inhalation increases lung volume, resulting in prolongation of TE via mechanoreceptor-mediated reflexes.\r"

Four Korean women divers wearing wet suits were immersed to the neck in water of critical temperature (Tcw) while resting for 3 h or exercising (2-3 met on a bicycle ergometer) for 2 h. During immersion both rectal (Tre) and skin temperatures and O2 consumption (VO2) were measured, from which heat production (M = 4.83 VO2), skin heat loss (Hsk = 0.92 M +/- heat store change based on delta Tre), and thermal insulation were calculated. The average Tcw of the subjects with wet suits was 16.5 +/- 1.2 degrees C (SE), which was 12.3 degrees C lower than that of the same subjects with swim suits (28.8 +/- 0.4 degrees C). During the 3rd h of immersion, Tre and mean skin temperatures (Tsk) averaged 37.3 +/- 0.1 and 28.0 +/- 0.5 degrees C, and skin heat loss per unit surface area 42.3 +/- 2.66 kcal X m-2 X h. The calculated body insulation [Ibody = Tre - Tsk/Hsk] and the total shell insulation [Itotal = (Tre - TW)/Hsk] were 0.23 +/- 0.02 and 0.5 +/- 0.04 degrees C X kcal-1 X m2 X h, respectively. During immersion exercise, both Itotal and Ibody declined exponentially as the exercise intensity increased. Surprisingly, the insulation due to wet suit (Isuit = Itotal - Ibody) also decreased with exercise intensity, from 0.28 degrees C X kcal-1 X m2 X h at rest to 0.12 degrees C X kcal-1 X m2 X h at exercise levels of 2-3 met.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Rcoll was 0.50 +/- 0.11 cmH2O X ml-1 X min (SE) in young sheep and decreased significantly to 0.05 +/- 0.02 and 0.02 +/- 0.01 cmH2O X ml-1 X min in mature and old sheep, respectively. Tcoll was 34.4 +/- 7.9 (SE) s in young sheep and decreased to 5.7 +/- 0.9 and 10.2 +/- 3.1 s in mature and old sheep, respectively. We conclude that a marked decrease in Rcoll and Tcoll occurs between birth and maturity but changes little with further aging. In the young an increased resistance and time constant of collateral airflow may accentuate ventilation perfusion imbalance and impair the removal of secretions in disease states.\r"

This produced corresponding mean preductal arterial O2 tension (PaO2) values of 25.2 +/- 1.1 (control), 20.1 +/- 1.0 (mild hypoxia), 17.8 +/- 0.9 (moderate hypoxia), and 16.8 +/- 1.4 Torr (severe hypoxia). These were associated with mean arterial O2 contents (CaO2) of 7.18 +/- 0.44, 5.19 +/- 0.34, 4.24 +/- 0.33, and 3.27 +/- 0.20 ml/dl, respectively. The most severe hypoxia was associated with metabolic acidosis and fetal bradycardia. Hypoxia did not reduce significantly the incidence of low-voltage electrocortical activity. The incidence of breathing and rapid eye movements was not affected by mild hypoxia; however, the incidence of both was significantly reduced during moderate and severe hypoxia. It is concluded that 1) acute reductions in the mean PaO2 of 5.9 +/- 0.6 Torr and CaO2 of 2.00 +/- 0.23 ml/dl are critical in that greater reductions inhibit fetal eye and breathing activity and 2) hypoxia probably inhibits eye and breathing movements by altering sleep state.\r"

The reactive hyperemic blood flow response (RHBF) was also evaluated pre- and posttraining in both forearms of each subject to determine whether maximal vasodilatory capacity would be enhanced. In addition, maximal O2 consumption (VO2max) was measured. We found that chronic handgrip work led to an increase in work-related blood flow (before, 22.4; after, 32.1; P less than 0.05); a drop in work-related minimal resistance (R) (before, 6.4; after, 4.1; P less than 0.05). RHBF rose in the chronically exercised extremity by 30% (before, 33.5; after, 43.7; P less than 0.05) as minimal R fell (before, 3.2; after, 2.2; P less than 0.05). RHBF and R in the unstimulated dominant forearm remained unchanged (blood flow: before, 33.5; after, 31.0; NS; R before, 3.2; after, 3.2; NS). VO2max (ml X kg-1 X min-1) did not change (before, 35.7; after, 34.0). These findings show that localized skeletal muscle forearm work is associated with a localized increase in vasodilation (RHBF). Thus the vascular system appears to be an independent integral partner in the training process.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the mechanism of the bone marrow-induced pulmonary edema in the isolated Ringer-perfused rabbit lung. Bone marrow administration (0.2 ml/kg body wt) increased pulmonary arterial pressure, capillary pressure, arterial resistance, and venous resistance within 2-4 min. Bone marrow also produced marked increases in lung wet weight and the capillary filtration coefficient but at later time points (90-120 min) during the perfusion. Only the triglyceride-containing lipid component of the bone marrow produced increases in pulmonary hemodynamics, lung wet weight, and the capillary filtration coefficient comparable to those observed after bone marrow. Bone marrow and the lipid component of bone marrow both produced increases in venous effluent lipoprotein lipase activity (the enzyme responsible for hydrolysis of triglycerides to free fatty acids). Bone marrow also stimulated the production of thromboxane B2 but not 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha in the perfused lung. Both meclofenamate (1 microM), a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, and U-60,257 (10 microM), a lipoxygenase inhibitor, attenuated the bone marrow-induced pulmonary hemodynamic response, whereas only U-60,257 attenuated the increases in lung wet weight and the capillary filtration coefficient. In conclusion, pulmonary embolization induced by bone marrow results in increases in lung weight and the capillary filtration coefficient in the isolated Ringer-perfused rabbit lung. Pulmonary vasoconstriction is partially dependent on arachidonic acid metabolites but appears to be independent of circulating blood-formed elements. The lipid component of bone marrow or products derived from this component (e.g., free fatty acids and lipoxygenase products) may mediate the bone marrow-induced pulmonary edema.\r"

The luminal-to-abluminal flux of 125I-albumin across cultured pulmonary endothelium was expressed as a clearance rate equal to the permeability-surface area product. After clearance rate measurement for a 30-min base-line period, a test agent was added to the luminal side, and the clearance rate was remeasured during a 30-min experimental period. In control studies the base-line clearance rate was 0.343 +/- 0.017 microliter/min. After correction for the diffusional resistances of the filter and unstirred layers, the calculated permeability of the endothelial monolayer was 1.2 X 10(-5) cm/s. When culture medium was the test agent, the experimental clearance rate was unchanged from the base-line value. After addition of 4 mM oleic acid to the luminal chamber, the clearance rate was 0.528 +/- 0.017 microliter/min compared with a base-line value of 0.330 +/- 0.008 microliter/min (P less than 0.005). This method allows the calculation of endothelial permeability with correction for unstirred layers and the use of each monolayer as its own control.\r"

At mid-FP and at mid-LP, seven eumenorrheic young women [means +/- SE; chronological age, 21.1 +/- 0.6 yr; O2 uptake (VO2) peak, 43.7 +/- 2.0 ml X kg-1 X min-1; body fat, 19.2 +/- 2.0%] were subjected to a 90-min bicycle exercise period at an intensity representing 63% of their measured VO2 peak. Venous blood samples obtained before and during exercise were analyzed for levels of substrates (glucose, lactate, free fatty acids, glycerol) and hormones (luteinizing hormone, progesterone, estradiol, insulin, glucagon, cortisol, catecholamines). Contrary to FP, a significant (P less than 0.01) decrease in blood glucose concentration was observed after 70 and 90 min of exercise during LP. Significant phase differences were also observed for blood lactate (highest in FP), cortisol (highest in LP), and progesterone (highest in LP). Although not significantly different, tendencies for menstrual phase dissociations were noticed for some of the other measured variables. Hence, a menstrual phase dissociation in circulating glucose level, unmasked by a prolonged exercise performed after a 24-h carbohydrate-poor diet, suggests to the authors a specific metabolic involvement for gonadotrophic and/or gonadal hormones.\r"

Whether this fall is due to an increase in red blood cell concentration (Hct) or to an increase in arterial O2 content (Cao2) is controversial. We examined the independent effects of Hct and Cao2 on CBF as Hct was raised from 30 to 55% in anesthetized 1- to 7-day-old sheep. CBF was measured by the radiolabeled microsphere technique before and after isovolemic exchange transfusion with either oxyhemoglobin-containing erythrocytes (in 5 control animals) or with methemoglobin-containing erythrocytes (in 9 experimental animals). Following exchange transfusion in the control animals, Hct rose (30 +/- 1 vs. 55 +/- 1%, mean +/- SE), Cao2 increased (15.1 +/- 0.8 vs. 26.7 +/- 0.9 vol%), and CBF fell (66 +/- 9 vs. 35 +/- 5 ml X min-1 X 100 g-1). Because the fall in CBF was proportionate to the rise in Cao2, cerebral O2 transport (CBF X Cao2) was unchanged. Following exchange transfusion in the experimental animals, Hct rose (32 +/- 1 vs. 55 +/- 1%) but Cao2 did not change. Nevertheless, CBF still fell (73 +/- 4 vs. 48 +/- 2 ml X min-1 X 100 g-1) and, as a result, cerebral O2 transport also fell. The latter cannot be attributed to a fall in cerebral O2 uptake, as cerebral O2 uptake was unaffected during each of these conditions. Comparison of the two groups of animals showed that approximately 60% of the fall in CBF may be attributed to the increase in red cell concentration alone. It is probable that this effect is due largely to changes in blood viscosity.\r"

  ".W": "Diaphragmatic fatigue has been defined in terms of the failure of the muscle to continue to generate a given level of tension. Appropriate shortening of the diaphragm is, however, just as important for adequate ventilation. In this study we have examined in vitro the contractile properties of the rat diaphragm under afterloaded isotonic conditions and the effect of fatigue on the ability of the diaphragm to shorten. Shortening of the muscle strips was found to depend on size of afterload, frequency of stimulation, duration of stimulation, and initial length of the muscle. The afterloaded isotonic length-tension relationship coincided with the relationship between length and active isometric tension only for relatively small afterloads. Fatigue of the muscle strips, induced by isometric or afterloaded isotonic contractions, was associated with a decline in the extent of shortening as well as a decrease in active isometric tension. Ability to shorten and ability to develop isometric tension did not decrease to the same extent under all conditions. We conclude that active shortening, as well as active isometric tension, is decreased by muscular fatigue and that changes in these properties can be different depending on experimental conditions. The results suggest that the definition of diaphragmatic fatigue should be expanded to include the ability of the muscle to shorten by an appropriate amount. The results also suggest that measurement of isometric performance may not provide a complete estimate of the overall performance of the fatigued diaphragm.\r"

In quiet sleep, EEV during breathing was 10.8 +/- 3.6 (SD) ml greater than the minimum volume reached during unobstructed apneas. In active sleep, no decrease in EEV was observed during 28 of 35 unobstructed apneas. Breaths during quiet sleep had a variable extent of expiratory airflow retardation (braking), and inspiratory interruption occurred at substantial expiratory flow rates. During active sleep, the expiratory flow-volume curve was nearly linear, proceeding nearly to the volume axis at zero flow, and diaphragm EMG activity terminated near the peak of mechanical inspiration. Expiratory duration (TE) and inspiratory duration (TI) were significantly shortened in quiet sleep vs. active sleep although tidal volume was not significantly different. In quiet sleep, diaphragmatic braking activity and shortened TE combined to maintain EEV during breathing substantially above relaxation volume. In active sleep, reduced expiratory braking and prolongation of TE resulted in an EEV that was close to relaxation volume. We conclude that breathing strategy to regulate EEV in premature infants appears to be strongly influenced by sleep state.\r"

Volume history effects were quantitated as an M-to-P ratio of Vmax at 30% vital capacity (M/P V30). Although M/P V30 was variable among patients at base line, there was a uniform increase in M/P V30 during constriction and a consistent decrease below base line after dilation. Blunting of induced obstruction with beta-agonists also diminished the increase in M/P V30. Antimuscarinics, despite equivalent bronchodilation, failed to alter the degree of obstruction induced by cold air or the increase in M/P V30 seen during obstruction. The level of airway tone, as indicated by specific resistance, related directly to the M/P V30. We conclude that the response of the asthmatic lung to a deep inhalation is relatively predictable when acute changes in airway tone are produced.\r"

  ".W": "Using in vivo microscopy, we made direct measurements of pulmonary capillary transit time by determining the time required for fluorescent dye to pass from an arteriole to a venule on the dependent surface of the dog lung. Concurrently, in the same animals, pulmonary capillary transit time was measured indirectly in the entire lung using the diffusing capacity method (capillary blood volume divided by cardiac output). Transit times by each method were the same in a group of five dogs [direct: 1.75 +/- 0.27 (SE) s; indirect: 1.85 +/- 0.33 s; P = 0.7]. The similarity of these transit times is important, because the widely used indirect determinations based on diffusing capacity are now shown to coincide with direct measurements and also because it demonstrates that measurements of capillary transit times on the surface of the dependent lung bear a useful relationship to measurements on the capillaries in the rest of the lung.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the role of the upper airway in the regulation of the pattern of breathing in six adult dogs during wakefulness and sleep. The dogs breathed through a fenestrated endotracheal tube inserted through a tracheostomy. The tube was modified to allow airflow to be directed either through the nose or through the tracheostomy. When airflow was diverted from nose to tracheostomy there was an abrupt increase in the rate of expiratory airflow, resulting in prolongation of the end-expiratory pause but no change in overall expiratory duration or respiratory frequency. Furthermore, electromyogram recordings from implanted diaphragmatic and laryngeal muscle electrodes did not show any changes that could be interpreted as an attempt to delay expiratory airflow or increase end-expiratory lung volume. The effects of switching from nose to tracheostomy breathing could be reversed by adding a resistance to the endotracheal tube so as to approximate upper airway resistance. The findings indicate that under normal conditions in the adult dog upper airway receptors play little role in regulation of respiratory pattern and that the upper airway exerts little influence on the maintenance of end-expiratory lung volume.\r"

At these flow rates inflow and left atrial pressures averaged 41.9 +/- 1.3 and 2.5 +/- 0.5 (SE) mmHg, respectively. PM was 30.9 +/- 1.6 mmHg, and EFP was 32.3 +/- 1.9 mmHg with no significant difference between the two measurements by paired t test. The results indicate that the arterial occlusion technique yields a pressure that is equivalent to EFP even during very high pulmonary blood flow where the longitudinal distribution of resistance is quite different from that obtained during normal flow.\r"

  ".W": "Twelve stable adult asthmatics slowly inhaled boluses of He at 20, 40, or 60% vital capacity (VC); these volumes were achieved either by expiring from total lung capacity (TLC) or by inspiring from residual volume (RV). Inspirations were continued to TLC and then were followed by slow expirations to RV while expired He was measured as a function of expired volume. At 20% VC slopes of alveolar plateaus (phase III) were positive, at 40% VC they were flat, and at 60% VC they were negative; at 20 and 60% VC the slopes were steeper than those in normals. When boluses were administered at 40 and 60% VC, He washout curves were independent of lung volume history. However at 20% VC the slope of phase III was significantly less positive when boluses were given after inspiration from RV than after expiration from TLC. In eight subjects, who were given inhaled beta-agonists, slopes of all He washouts decreased and became independent of volume history at 20% VC. We conclude that in asthmatics at low lung volumes the airways that determine ventilation distribution behave as though they have less hysteresis than the lung parenchyma probably due to increased airway tone.\r"

After training to run on a treadmill with hindlimbs only, 20 dogs were anesthetized and instrumented using sterile surgical techniques. To chronically record heart rate and arterial blood pressure, the aorta was cannulated via the omocervical artery. To test the intactness of descending spinal sympathetic pathways, reflex pressor responses to baroreceptor hypotension were produced by bilateral carotid arterial occlusion using pneumatic vessel occluders placed around the common carotid arteries. To generate transient ischemic exercise (120 s), a pneumatic occluder was placed around the left iliac artery. Eight to 10 days after instrumentation, blood pressure and heart rate were monitored at rest and during hindlimb running with and without simultaneous iliac arterial occlusion. The modest pressor response and tachycardia elicited by hindlimb exercise were markedly augmented by simultaneous hindlimb ischemia (i.e., iliac arterial occlusion). Lesion placement in the dorsolateral sulcus area and the dorsolateral funiculus at L2 significantly reduced the blood pressure and heart rate responses to simultaneous exercise occlusion. The cardiovascular responses to nonischemic exercise and bilateral carotid arterial occlusion were not altered by such spinal sections. It is concluded that in the dog the ascending spinal pathways mediating cardiovascular responses to ischemic exercise are located in the lateral funiculus, including the dorsolateral sulcus area and dorsolateral funiculus.\r"

  ".W": "The segmental distribution of vascular resistances and compliances were evaluated in isolated blood perfused lung lobes using arterial, venous, and double-occlusion pressures and were compared with filtration midpoint capillary pressures (Pc,f). We separated total vascular resistance (RT) and compliance (CT) into large artery (Ra, Ca), large vein (Rv, Cv), and microvascular compartments (Rmc, Cmc) at base-line and increased vascular pressures and during infusions of histamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. In control lobes, double-occlusion pressure (Pdo) closely approximated Pc,f at all vascular pressures. Pre- and postcapillary resistance were approximately equal when referenced to either Pc,f or Pdo. Although Rmc comprised 42% of RT and Cmc constituted 76% of CT, a twofold increase in base-line Pc,f caused RT to decrease to 67% and Rmc/RT to 29% of control values, whereas CT decreased to 87% and Cmc/CT decreased to 88% of control values over the same Pc,f range. Mean static CT was 2.25 +/- 0.09 ml X cmH2O-1. 100 g-1, whereas dynamic CT was 1.54 +/- 0.08 ml X cmH2O-1. 100 g-1, or only 68% of static vascular compliance. Drug infusions increased mean RT from 4.2- to 5.3-fold and significantly decreased both static and dynamic CT. Although all vascular segments were constricted, histamine affected primarily large veins, serotonin increased Ra greater than Rv, and norepinephrine constricted upstream and downstream vessels about equally. Increased Pc,f in the presence of these drugs decreased RT significantly in every case primarily through attenuation of the drug vasoconstrictor effect on Rmc and decreased CT primarily due to a decrease in Cmc, but increased Cmc/(Ca + Cv). Thus the microvascular compartment appears to be the major site of both fluid filtration and vascular compliance and contributes significantly to total vascular resistance. Drug infusions constricted large and small vessel compartments as defined here, but increased Pc,f attenuated microvascular vasoconstriction and to a lesser extent large vessel vasoconstriction resulting in a reduced microvascular resistance in both drug-treated and control lobes. This effect can be attributed to recruitment and/or distension of microvessels and distension of larger vessels.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that dopamine accumulated in the carotid body limits hyperventilation during acclimatization to sustained hypoxia, we administered the dopamine antagonist droperidol to mice undergoing acclimatization to an inspired O2 fraction (FIo2) of 0.1. Twelve mice were exposed to hypoxia for 10 days and ventilation in 10% O2 and in 7% CO2 in air were measured daily by a plethysmographic method. Under both conditions ventilation increased during acclimatization to hypoxia: ventilation in 10% O2 increased from 39.4 +/- 3.8 (mean +/- SE) ml/min before exposure to sustained hypoxia to 72.2 +/- 4.2 ml/min after 3 days of continuous hypoxia, and ventilation in 7% CO2 in air at the same time increased from 113.2 +/- 5.4 ml/min to 140.0 +/- 5.6 ml/min. Twelve mice were exposed to FIo2 of 0.1 for 10 days and received droperidol (300 micrograms/kg intraperitoneally) before exposure to sustained hypoxia and on the 2nd, 4th, and 8th days of continuous hypoxia. Before exposure to sustained hypoxia, droperidol increased ventilation in 10% O2 from 40.1 +/- 2.5 ml/min to 72.5 +/- 5.2 ml/min, but after 2, 4, and 8 days of continuous hypoxia droperidol caused an acute fall in ventilation (ventilation in 10% O2 after droperidol on day 2: 49.1 +/- 3.1 ml/min, on day 4: 44.4 +/- 3.7 ml/min, and on day 8: 27.8 +/- 3.4 ml/min). Two days after the animals were returned to room air, ventilation in 10% O2 again increased in response to droperidol. We conclude that dopamine in the carotid body does not limit ventilatory responses to hypoxia during acclimatization to sustained hypoxia.\r"

Seven females and four males trained 6 days/wk for 7 wk alternating days of continuous cycling (40 min) and interval running (five 5-min bouts). The NH3 content of blood was determined before and during cycle ergometer (CE) exercise (4 min) at power outputs (PO) of 119, 172, and 241 W pretraining and of 163, 230, and 271 W posttraining. These PO for each occasion represent relative work loads of approximately 65, 90, and 115% of peak CE maximum O2 uptake (PCE VO2), respectively. Training increased (P less than 0.05) PCE VO2 approximately 32% (2.72 +/- 0.25 to 3.56 +/- 0.29 l/min or 38.5 +/- 1.9 to 51.2 +/- 2.3 ml X kg-1 X min-1). Both pre- and posttraining the NH3 content of blood increased (P less than 0.05) with increasing intensity of exercise. Training did not influence the measure of these responses during exercise at the same relative intensity. During exercise at the same absolute PO, approximately 168 or 235 W, however, increases in blood NH3 were less (P less than 0.05) after training. The results indicate that the magnitude of increase in blood NH3 during exercise is determined by the energy requirement of the absolute work load, relative to an individual's aerobic power.\r"

Spatial and lateral R-wave amplitudes were derived from the orthogonal Frank (XYZ) lead system. The exercise group significantly increased maximal O2 consumption (0.17 l/min), whereas controls decreased significantly (0.12 l/min, P less than 0.01 between groups). No significant changes in electrocardiographic R-wave voltage measurements occurred within or between groups during the year. It is concluded that exercise training does not result in increases in R-wave voltage in patients with coronary artery disease.\r"

Rats were killed at one of three time points: immediately after the exercise bout, and at 1 or 4 h later. Males had significantly higher resting muscle glycogen levels (P less than 0.05). Exercise resulted in significant glycogen depletion in both sexes (P less than 0.01). Males utilized approximately 50% more glycogen during the exercise bout than females (P less than 0.05). During the food-restricted 4-h recovery period, muscle glycogen was repleted significantly during the 1st h (P less than 0.05). Liver glycogen was not depleted as a result of the exercise bout, but fell during the first h of recovery (P less than 0.05) and remained low during the subsequent 3 h. The greater glycogen utilization in red and white fast-twitch muscle during exercise by males could represent a true sex difference but could also be attributable in part to the males having performed more work as a result of 20% greater body mass. We conclude that no sex difference was observed in the rates of muscle glycogen repletion after exercise or in liver glycogen metabolism during and after exercise, and rapid postexercise muscle glycogen repletion occurred at a time of accelerated liver glycogen depletion.\r"

It is therefore important to know whether stimulation produces any deleterious effects in the long term. Hemidiaphragm muscles of four dogs were examined after chronic stimulation for 1 yr at either 2 or 4 Hz. The stimulated hemidiaphragms appeared normal on gross inspection and were still contracting vigorously. By histochemical and immunohistochemical criteria, they had acquired a uniformly type I character, in contrast to the mixed fiber type composition of the unstimulated hemidiaphragms. This transformation was also reflected in their complement of myosin isozymes. There was some enzymatic evidence of an associated shift towards aerobic pathways of energy generation. Histological examination revealed no evidence of degenerative changes. Trends, observed in the shorter term (6-8 wk), toward a decrease in fiber area and an increase in connective tissue showed no further progression at 1 yr. Thus hemidiaphragm muscle stimulated at frequencies at or above the normal heart rate does not appear to undergo adverse long-term changes that would constrain its use in a myocardial assist role.\r"

The large number of experimental samples (greater than 650) and concomitant collection of blood and urine aliquots along with data on body weights gave us the opportunity to assess and quantitate the sensitivity of commonly used criteria of hypohydration. Urine aliquots for all test days were initially categorized by specific gravity (SG) greater than or equal to 1.03 (n = 124) or less than 1.03 (n = 540). Creatinine levels were elevated (P less than 0.001) in the concentrated urine samples, but a decreased trend in sodium-to-potassium ratios in these samples failed to achieve statistical significance (P greater than 0.05). However, when individuals with high SG urine were subclassified by a criterion of weight loss greater than 3% from original body weight, then creatinine concentrations were elevated (P = 0.05), whereas sodium-to-potassium ratios were decreased (P = 0.05) when subjects also with high SG but weight loss less than 3% were compared. Because of the moderate altitude (2,000 m) of the field site and the time of sojourn (44 days), there occurred a slight, but significant (P less than 0.001), erythropoietic response. Hematocrit and serum osmolality were not significantly different when examined by the criteria of high or low SG urine and weight loss greater than or less than 3% original body weight.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fatigue was induced by repeatedly generating transdiaphragmatic pressures (Pdi) of either 50 or 75% maximum Pdi (Pdimax) until approximately 10 min after the target Pdi could no longer be reached (Tlim). Maximal bilateral shocks delivered periodically to the phrenic nerves elicited Pdi twitches between breaths (Tr) and superimposed on the voluntary contractions (Ts). The ratio [1 - Ts/Tr], which provides an index of the degree of central nervous system muscle activation, increased as fatigue developed. However, superimposed twitches were still detectable at and beyond Tlim when all contractions involved maximal efforts. They were not seen in maximal contractions of the unfatigued muscle. Initially, the diaphragm electromyogram increased, but then declined. No impairment of neuromuscular transmission was seen. We conclude that at and beyond Tlim about one-half of the reduction in Pdimax resulted from reduced central motor drive; the remainder resulted from peripheral muscle contractile failure. No fatigue was evident during 50% Pdimax dynamic contractions.\r"

The animals received tranexamic acid (100 mg) to suppress fibrinolysis and were then challenged with an intravenous infusion of alpha-thrombin (80 U/kg). Control-thrombin challenged sheep were compared with the CVF-treated sheep challenged with the same thrombin dosage. CVF treatment (187 U X kg-1 X day-1 for 4 days) decreased the total hemolytic complement activity by 45% of control. Thrombin infusion in control sheep increased the mean pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), and lymph protein clearance (pulmonary lymph flow X lymph-to-plasma protein concentration ratio, Clym). Thrombin infusion in CVF-treated sheep produced smaller increments in Ppa, PVR, and Clym. Pulmonary lymph obtained from control-thrombin and CVF-thrombin sheep induced migration of granulocytes obtained from normal unchallenged sheep. The granulocytes obtained from CVF-treated sheep responded relatively less to the migratory and O-2-generating stimuli (i.e., zymosan-treated serum, pulmonary lymph from sheep after thrombin challenge, and plasma from sheep after CVF treatment) compared with normal granulocytes. The attenuation of the thrombin-induced increases in Ppa, PVR, and lung transvascular fluid and protein exchange by CVF treatment may be the result of impaired function of granulocytes.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of these studies was to determine the reflex responses of the cardiovascular system and central inspiratory activity caused by pulmonary vascular congestion. We used a canine preparation in which the left lung was isolated in situ and could be exposed to a variety of stimuli, including distension of the pulmonary capillaries with blood, without direct mechanical or chemical alterations on the circulation. We found that lung expansion to 30 cmH2O and stimulation of nerve endings of the left lung with capsaicin caused pronounced transient reflex bradycardia (-30 to -50 beats/min) and hypotension (-25 to -40 mmHg) and caused reflex cessation of inspiratory activity. Pressurizing the left pulmonary vessels by injecting blood in volumes sufficient to raise pulmonary transcapillary pressures to 30 mmHg caused no changes in heart rate, systemic arterial pressure, or inspiratory muscle activity. These results lead us to conclude that pulmonary vascular congestion does not stimulate pulmonary C-fibers or any other nerve endings to such a degree as to cause detectable changes in blood pressure, heart rate, or central inspiratory activity. Morphometric analysis revealed distended capillaries engorged with blood, but the alveolar wall surface area was not increased which raises the possibility that expansion of the alveolar membrane may be needed to mechanically initiate the C-fiber reflex.\r"

Experiments were carried out over a range of conditions that would prevail in the central to lower airways during high-frequency ventilation at moderate frequency (5 Hz) and tidal volume (15-80 ml). Gas transport coefficients resulting from oscillation of three different resident-trace gas pairs were measured using a new analytic technique. This technique allowed rapid determination of the transport coefficient distribution along the entire network. Results demonstrate a small but significant influence attributable to changes in gas properties that is similar to that found in a straight tube and indicate that augmented dispersion is an important mechanism of axial transport. Gas transport coefficients were found to be unaffected by changes in flow waveform symmetry, suggesting that previously reported improvements in gas exchange associated with decreasing inspiratory to expiratory time ratios are not due to a change in local conditions such as asymmetry in the velocity profile.\r"

A heat stress test (HST) was attempted approximately 2-wk pre- and 48-h postinfusion during the late spring months. After 30 min of rest in a 20 degrees C antechamber, the HST consisted of a 120-min exposure (2 repeats of 15 min rest and 45 min treadmill walking) in a hot (35 degrees C, 45% rh) environment while euhydrated. Erythrocyte volume (RCV, 51Cr) and plasma volume (PV, 125I) were measured 24 h before each HST, and maximal O2 uptake (VO2max) was measured 24 h after each HST. Generally, no significant effects were found for the saline group. For the reinfusion group, RCV (11%, P less than 0.01) and VO2max (11%, P less than 0.05) increased after infusion, and the following observations were made: 1) the increased RCV was associated with a reduction in PV to maintain the same blood volume as during the preinfusion measurements; 2) polycythemia reduced total circulating protein but did not alter F-cell ratio, plasma osmolality, plasma protein content, or plasma lactate at rest or during exercise-heat stress; 3) polycythemia did not change the volume of fluid entering the intravascular space from rest to exercise-heat stress; and 4) polycythemia tended to reduce the rate of heat storage during exercise-heat stress.\r"

  ".W": "The electrical activity of the triangularis sterni (transversus thoracis) muscle was studied in supine humans during resting breathing and a variety of respiratory and nonrespiratory maneuvers known to bring the abdominal muscles into action. Twelve normal subjects, of whom seven were uninformed and untrained, were investigated. The electromyogram of the triangularis sterni was recorded using a concentric needle electrode, and it was compared with the electromyograms of the abdominal (external oblique and rectus abdominis) muscles. The triangularis sterni was usually silent during resting breathing. In contrast, the muscle was invariably activated during expiration from functional residual capacity, expulsive maneuvers, \"belly-in\" isovolume maneuvers, static head flexion and trunk rotation, and spontaneous events such as speech, coughing, and laughter. When three trained subjects expired voluntarily with considerable recruitment of the triangularis sterni and no abdominal muscle activity, rib cage volume decreased and abdominal volume increased. These results indicate that unlike in the dog, spontaneous quiet expiration in supine humans is essentially a passive process; the human triangularis sterni, however, is a primary muscle of expiration; and its neural activation is largely coupled with that of the abdominals. The triangularis sterni probably contributes to the deflation of the rib cage during active expiration.\r"

The additional thermal loads, which were applied via two climatic boxes, produced measurable effects on sweat rate when applied to one leg only. In comparison to the experiment 1, experiment 2 brought about a significant reduction of local evaporation on the left leg. With antisymmetric thermal loads on both legs (experiment 3), which did not influence the overall thermal balance, there was no significant influence on local evaporation, although significant changes of local temperatures were measured. It is suggested that the well-known regulatory models, declaring local, mean skin, and core temperatures as local evaporation drive should be supplemented with an important additional feature: local control of evaporation by local skin temperature may be blocked by an overall thermal balance.\r"

In each intact and denervated state, sequential breaths were analyzed at 10-min intervals up to 80 min. Individual breath frequency (f), tidal volume (VT), and ventilation (V = f X VT) were determined. In individual cats, sympathectomy or deafferentation could cause significant increases or decreases in ventilation or no change. Thus the range of spontaneous variability in breath V as well as minute ventilation (VE), averaged for the group, were not consistently altered in the same direction by either sympathectomy or deafferentation of the carotid bifurcations. Interestingly, in most cats after both sympathectomy (5 of 6) and deafferentation (4 of 6), VT increased and f decreased relative to V. Despite this, after sinus nerve section in two cats arterial PO2 decreased and arterial PCO2 tended to increase relative to VE, suggesting possible effects of deafferentation on ventilation-perfusion balance. Sympathectomy also affected timing such that inspiratory time began to exceed 0.5 of the breath duration at a lower breath f; this effect of sympathectomy was reversed to intact values by subsequent sinus deafferentation. Thus, in eupneic awake cats, sympathetics normally suppress reflex modulation of central timing from carotid chemoreceptors and/or baroreceptors.\r"

Electrical stimulation (0.2 ms, 0.01-10 mA, 2 Hz) of the right C5 phrenic rootlet during inspiration consistently elicited a transient reduction in the phrenic motor discharge. This attenuation occurred bilaterally with an onset latency of 8-12 ms and a duration of 8-30 ms. Section of the ipsilateral C4-C6 dorsal roots abolished the response to stimulation, thereby confirming the involvement of phrenic nerve afferent activity. Stimulation of the left C5 phrenic rootlet or the right thoracic phrenic nerve usually elicited similar inhibitory responses. The difference in onset latency of responses to cervical vs. thoracic phrenic nerve stimulation indicates activation of group III afferents with a peripheral conduction velocity of approximately 10 m/s. A much shorter latency response (5 ms) was evoked ipsilaterally by thoracic phrenic nerve stimulation. Section of either the C5 or C6 dorsal root altered the ipsilateral response so that it resembled the longer latency contralateral response. The low-stimulus threshold and short latency for the ipsilateral response to thoracic phrenic nerve stimulation suggest that it involves larger diameter fibers. Decerebration, decerebellation, and transection of the dorsal columns at C2 do not abolish the inhibitory phrenic-to-phrenic reflex.\r"

Extracellular recordings of neuronal responses to vagal nerve and cervical phrenic nerve stimulation (CPNS) indicated that about one-fourth of the DRG respiratory-modulated neurons were excited by phrenic nerve afferents with an onset latency of approximately 20 ms. In addition, non-respiratory-modulated neurons within the DRG were recruited by CPNS. Although some convergence of vagal and phrenic afferent input was observed, most neurons were affected by only one type of afferent. In contrast to the DRG, only 3 out of 28 VRG respiratory-modulated neurons responded to CPNS. A second study determined that most of these neuronal responses were due to activation of diaphragmatic afferents since 90% of the DRG units activated by CPNS were also excited at a longer latency by thoracic phrenic nerve stimulation. The difference in onset latency of neuronal excitation indicates an afferent peripheral conduction velocity of about 10 m/s, which suggests that they are predominately small myelinated fibers (group III) making paucisynaptic connections with DRG neurons. Decerebration, decerebellation, and bilateral transection of the dorsal columns at C2 do not abolish the neuronal responses to cervical PNS.\r"

  ".W": "Acclimation of rock pigeon (Columba livia) to high ambient temperature (Ta) 50 degrees C from the time of hatching resulted in a well-developed cutaneous evaporative cooling mechanism (CECM), which became the dominant mechanism for heat dissipation. After the age of 15 days and in adults, acclimated pigeons exposed to 48-60 degrees C Ta could regulate normal body temperature (Tb) without employing either panting or gular fluttering. Respiration rate varied between 36 +/- 12 (SD) and 35 +/- 14 breaths/min at moderate and at extreme high Ta's, respectively. During thermal stress (42, 45, and 47 degrees C) imposed in a metabolic chamber, nonpanting pigeons' heat balance was achieved by adjusting low-level heat production (46.2 +/- 6.8 W/m2) and by use of an efficient CECM that dissipated 145% of the metabolic heat. Tb was regulated between 40.7 +/- 0.5 and 41.8 +/- 0.4 degrees C over a wide range of Ta's (20-56 degrees C). The respiratory evaporative cooling mechanism (RECM) was effective since hatching. The CECM developed approximately 24 h later during the ontogeny of the altricial nestling pigeon. This trait, which exists in many bird species and may be a recent development, possibly evolved as an adaptation to hot environments. In the present study we have brought evidence for a multitrait physiological adaptation that takes preeminence in adjusting the processes involved in maintaining heat balance. This integrative complex creates a powerful, efficient tool for contending with the most extreme thermal conditions.\r"

  ".W": "Mucus transport by two-phase gas-liquid flow mechanism was investigated with in vitro flow models under asymmetric periodic airflow conditions with nine different liquid solutions with rheological properties similar to human sputum. The flow model was made with 1.0-cm-ID glass tube and positioned either vertically or horizontally. With a constant supply of the test liquids into the model tube (0.5 ml/min), the liquid layer transport speed (LLTS) as well as the mean liquid layer thickness at steady-state condition (hs) was measured in conjunction with various airflow patterns of different expiratory and inspiratory flow rate, breathing frequency (f), and tidal volume (VT). The flow patterns were maintained within the range of normal breathing. In the horizontal tube model, LLTS ranged from 1.14 +/- 0.02 to 3.39 +/- 0.04 cm/min at the peak expiratory flow rate (VEp) of 30-60 l/min. The inspiratory flow rate, as well as f and VT did not affect LLTS. However, LLTS increased with increasing VEp, and at the same VEp LLTS was higher with viscoelastic than with viscous liquid. In the vertical tube model, the upward transport of mucus could not be achieved at VEp lower than 30 l/min particularly with low viscosity and low elasticity fluid. However, at high values of VEp, LLTS was comparable to that in the horizontal tube model with viscoelastic fluid, whereas LLTS of viscous liquid showed 26-40% lower than that in the horizontal tube model. The value of hs was 5-20% of the tube diameter at VEp of 30-60 l/min in both models. These results indicate that effective mucus clearance can be achieved by two-phase gas-liquid flow mechanism in patients with excessive bronchial secretions with biased tidal breathing favoring the expiratory flow and that the clearance can be further promoted by changing rheological properties of mucus.\r"

Results showed a small but significant increase in the percent resorptions in the pressure group and also a decrease in crown-rump length and placental weight. None of these changes were related to the stage of gestation in which the mice were exposed. No teratogenic effects of pressure were seen. We conclude that exposure to 50 ATA He-O2 during pregnancy in mice produces a small nonselective effect on fetal growth and development but does not affect any specific event taking place during these stages of embryogenesis.\r"

After a 12-h fast, subjects ingested 45 g of liquid carbohydrate (LCHO), solid carbohydrate confectionery bar (SCHO), or placebo (P) 5 min before exercise. An additional trial was performed in which a high-CHO meal (200 g) taken 4 h before exercise was combined with a confectionery bar feeding (M + SCHO) immediately before the activity. At 10 min of exercise, serum glucose values were elevated by 18 and 24% during SCHO and LCHO, respectively, compared with P. At 0 and 45 min no significant differences were observed in muscle glycogen concentration or total use between the four trials. Total work produced during the final 15 min of exercise was significantly greater (P less than 0.05) during M + SCHO (194,735 +/- 9,448 N X m), compared with all other trials and significantly greater (P less than 0.05) during LCHO and SCHO (175,204 +/- 11,780 and 176,013 +/- 10,465 N X m, respectively) than trial P (159,143 +/- 11,407 N X m).

The oxidative enzyme activities were 100% greater in T than in U, and VO2 max was 50% higher. A greater proportion of ATP regeneration occurred through oxidative processes in T than in U (smaller leg lactate release and smaller muscle lactate accumulation). The respiratory exchange ratio together with the local leg respiratory quotient indicated a greater contribution of fat to oxidative metabolism in T than U (53 vs. 33%). No difference, however, in the ratio of plasma free fatty acid extraction to O2 extraction by the working legs was found between T and U. Thus it could be calculated that a greater fraction of fat oxidation would have been covered by intramuscular triglycerides in T than in U (34 vs. 15%, P less than 0.05). T in comparison to U were further characterized by a smaller glycogen breakdown and a smaller glucose uptake, which may have been one contributing factor that prevented the blood glucose level from falling in T. The greater leg muscle citrate concentration in T could have been one factor mediating a lower carbohydrate utilization as a response to an increase in the relative proportion of fat oxidation.\r"

  ".W": "The first fifty kinematic rotating-hinge total knee arthroplasties that were done at the Mayo Clinic were reviewed. The indication for use of this prosthesis was either ligamentous instability or loss of bone, or both. At a mean length of follow-up of fifty months (range, twenty-nine to seventy-nine months), the clinical results of thirty-eight knees in thirty-six patients were evaluated. Fifteen of the thirty-eight knees had had a primary arthroplasty and twenty-three had had a revision arthroplasty using the kinematic rotating-hinge prosthesis. Using the knee-rating score of The Hospital for Special Surgery, there were fourteen excellent, twelve good, five fair, and five poor results. For two knees there was inadequate information to calculate a knee-rating score. Lucent lines that were more than one millimeter in width were seen with 25 per cent of the femoral and 50 per cent of the tibial components. Progression of lucent lines was observed in thirteen knees, and five knees showed probable radiographic loosening. The high incidence of complications was distressing, with a 16 per cent rate of sepsis, a 22 per cent rate of patellar instability, and a 6 per cent rate of breakage of the implant. In our opinion, this implant should be used only in knees in which there is functional absence of a collateral ligament that cannot be managed by soft-tissue reconstruction.\r"

Analysis of the amount of the initial loss of vertebral body and of the final angle of the gibbus deformity at six years showed a correlation coefficient of 0.83. Using the formula y = a + bx, the final angle of the gibbus deformity was predictable with 90 per cent accuracy in the patients who were not treated surgically. The ability to predict the final angle of the gibbus deformity allows the surgeon to select the patients who will require radical resection and bone-grafting to prevent a severe kyphosis.\r"

A review of the literature indicates that more than 25 per cent of patients had delayed healing, additional surgery, or persistent drainage after resection arthroplasty. Under these circumstances, muscle flaps may help provide definitive closure, cessation of drainage, and functional recovery of the extremity as well as a reduction in the length and cost of hospitalization. The successful use of a vastus lateralis flap in seven patients is described. The specific advantages are: the flap has a consistent reliably identified vascular pedicle which permits a wide arc of rotation; sufficient muscle volume enables large open wounds to be filled; the structural integrity of the muscle is not violated by previous operations; and no important functional deficit is attributable to the procedure.\r"

The study showed a close relationship between the location of the pain and the position of the protrusion of the disc. The degree of limitation of straight-leg raising was also found to have a direct relationship to the size and position of the protrusion and to its relationship to the spinal nerve. The protrusions were classified into three types according to position in relation to the dura mater and to the pattern of pain that was induced by passive straight-leg raising. On straight-leg raising, central protrusions tended to cause pain in the back, lateral protrusions caused pain in the lower extremity, and intermediate protrusions caused both. On this basis, the distribution of pain on straight-leg raising allowed an accurate prediction of the location of the lesion in 100 (88.5 per cent) of the 113 patients.\r"

These were assessed at a minimum of three years after the revision, with an average length of follow-up of sixty-one months. Eighteen (55 per cent) of the elbows had a good result and fifteen (45 per cent) had a poor result. The poor results were due to infection in three elbows, loosening of the prosthesis in six, inadequate motion in two, continued pain in two, and prosthetic failure in two. Additional surgical revision with another implant was done in the fifteen elbows that initially had a poor result. Eventually the result was good in twenty-four elbows. The three elbows that became infected after surgical revision had a resection arthroplasty and all were rated as having a fair result. The data from this study indicated that reimplantation is a viable option for the revision of a failed total elbow arthroplasty, although more than one revision may be required. They also suggested that young patients who have post-traumatic arthritis should not undergo a total joint replacement, and that revision procedures should be performed in settings that can offer several surgical options and by surgeons who have had experience with these options. Alternatives to reimplantation as a revision procedure should be considered in selected patients.\r"

Fourteen feet had resection of the coalition when the symptoms were not relieved by immobilization in a cast.

Eighty-nine fractures in eighty-eight patients were treated with no immobilization postoperatively. Three patients were lost to follow-up. Eighty-five of the remaining eighty-six fractures healed, the average time to clinical union being 7.2 weeks. Non-union of one fracture occurred and there were no infections or malunions. Six of the nine preoperative and two postoperative radial-nerve palsies were lesions in continuity and healed spontaneously. The remaining three radial nerves that had been severed by a missile needed further attention. One of the nails backed out in eight patients, requiring revision in five. The average lack of complete extension of the elbow was 4 degrees and flexion of the elbow was 132 degrees. Abduction of the shoulder averaged 91 degrees; external rotation, 54 degrees; and internal rotation, 68 degrees. We conclude that closed intramedullary Ender nailing can be performed safely and effectively in selected fractures of the humeral shaft. However, only fractures that are recalcitrant to closed reduction and immobilization or fractures in the non-compliant patient should be considered for this form of operative treatment.\r"

This method has several advantages over the more commonly used lateral plate for the fixation of this type of fracture, including dissection of a smaller area and less operative time, minimum bending of the plate, and no potential for penetration of a screw into the joint. The system can also be applied without insertion of a screw into the distal fragment. This prompted us to compare the biomechanical properties of fixation with the antiglide and lateral plating systems. Short oblique fractures of the distal part of the fibula were produced mechanically in cadaveric legs by supination and external rotation of the foot. The torque that was necessary to produce the fracture in each of twenty-four fibulae was recorded. After fracture, each fibula was reduced anatomically and fixed internally with a lateral plate or antiglide plate applied posteriorly. The strength of fixation was measured by restressing the legs until failure of fixation occurred. The stiffness of the fixation system and the amount of energy required to produce failure of fixation were also calculated. The system using the lateral plate for fixation failed when the torque reached an average of 64.3 per cent of the torque that produced the fracture.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All of the surgically treated elbows showed complete rupture or avulsion of both the medial and lateral collateral ligaments, and in about half of these patients the muscle origins were found to be torn from the humeral epicondyles. At follow-up, both groups showed generally good results; the differences were not statistically significant. There was no evidence that the results of surgical repair of the ligaments were any better than those of non-surgical treatment.\r"

The subjects were divided according to their body weight into lean (body mass index, less than 25) and obese (body mass index, greater than 29.5) groups. In lean subjects, infusion of 0.5 mg/h beta-endorphin caused significant increases in peripheral plasma glucose and glucagon levels, but no change in plasma insulin. In obese subjects, there was an immediate marked increase in both plasma insulin and glucagon concentrations during the beta-endorphin infusion, but the plasma glucose response was lower than that of lean subjects. In lean diabetic patients, beta-endorphin produced significant simultaneous increments in both insulin and glucagon concentrations and significantly decreased plasma glucose levels. These hormonal responses to beta-endorphin were amplified in the obese diabetic patients. There was a significant correlation (r = 0.61; P less than 0.01) between fasting plasma glucose levels and the integrated insulin area in response to beta-endorphin. The infusion of a lower dose of beta-endorphin (0.05 mg/h) in diabetic patients produced similar increments in both insulin and glucagon levels and also decreased plasma glucose concentration. These results indicate that beta-endorphin may have important glucoregulatory effects in man depending on the dose administered, the presence of obesity, and the prevailing plasma glucose concentration.\r"

Whereas [3H]OT was found to bind to a single class of sites with high affinity [Kd, 1.5 +/- 0.4 (+/- SEM) nM] and low capacity [maximum binding (Bmax), 34 +/- 6 fmol/mg protein], [3H]LVP bound to two classes of sites, one with high affinity (Kd, 2.2 +/- 0.1 nM) and low capacity (Bmax, 198 +/- 7 fmol/mg protein) and another with low affinity (Kd, 655 +/- 209 nM) and high capacity (Bmax, 5794 +/- 1616 fmol/mg protein). The binding of the labeled peptides also displayed a marked difference in sensitivity to Mg2+ and guanine nucleotides. These differences in binding characteristics as well as the differences in potency of analogs in competing for [3H]OT and [3H]LVP binding indicate the presence of distinct receptors for OT and vasopressin in human myometrium. Pharmacological characterization of the high affinity binding sites for [3H]LVP indicated that these are of the V1 subtype. Although, as suggested by others, vasopressin and OT can bind to the same sites, the presence of distinct receptors for both peptides provides an explanation for the previously reported difference in myometrial responsiveness to OT and vasopressin.\r"

  ".W": "Elderly humans demonstrate decreased responsiveness in several hormone-receptor systems, including adrenergic receptors. Studies of the beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) system have shown that reduced beta-adrenergic sensitivity in the elderly may be due to reduced beta-AR affinity for agonists. To determine the mechanisms underlying altered alpha-adrenergic sensitivity in the elderly, we assessed the relationships between age and platelet membrane alpha 2-adrenergic receptor (alpha 2-AR)-binding properties, receptor-linked adenylate cyclase (AC) activity, and the affinity of the alpha 2-AR-AC complex for agonists in 18 young (mean age, 24 yr; range 19-34) and 13 elderly (mean age, 69 yr; range, 63-85) normal subjects. In platelet membrane preparations from elderly compared to young subjects, we found similar antagonist-binding properties and similar activity of the catalytic unit of platelet AC, as indicated by the cAMP response to sodium fluoride stimulation. However, mean epinephrine-mediated inhibition of sodium fluoride-stimulated platelet AC activity was less in the elderly [20 +/- 4% (+/- SEM) vs. 31 +/- 2% inhibition; P less than 0.005). In addition, platelet alpha 2-AR affinity for agonist was lower in the elderly, as indicated by the higher concentration of epinephrine needed to inhibit 50% of specific [3H]yohimbine binding (IC50, 3.2 +/- 0.6 vs. 1.4 +/- 0.3 microM; P less than 0.02). These data provide evidence that platelet membranes from elderly humans have decreased responsiveness to alpha-adrenergic stimulation, which can be attributed to reduced alpha 2-AR-AC affinity for agonists. Similarly to reported age-related alterations in beta-adrenergic receptor function, these results suggest that there is also functional uncoupling of the alpha 2-AR-AC complex in elderly humans.\r"

This maturational process generally begins several years before activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (gonadarche). To study further the relationship between adrenarche and gonadarche, we examined adrenarche in patients with precocious puberty and in patients with isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Plasma dehydroepiandrosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, androstenedione, and cortisol were measured basally and during an infusion of ACTH in 50 children with precocious puberty, 5 patients with isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, 7 preadrenarchal children with constitutional short stature, 44 normal pubertal children, and 40 normal adults. Children with precocious puberty did not have a corresponding advance in the timing of adrenarche. Their basal and ACTH-stimulated adrenal androgen levels were markedly lower than those of normal children matched for pubertal stage (P less than 0.05) and were only slightly greater than those reported for normal children of the same age. Similarly, patients with isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and delayed puberty had no corresponding delay of adrenarche. Their adrenal androgen levels were appropriate for chronological age. Thus, these data provide further support for the hypothesis that adrenarche and gonadarche are independent maturational events controlled by separate mechanisms.\r"

NPY was present in high concentrations in the majority of the pheochromocytomas, but was absent in 3 tumors. Similar concentrations of NPY were measured using N- and C-terminal-directed antisera, and there was a good correlation between the concentrations of NPY immunoreactivity and CPON immunoreactivity in the same extracts. Gel permeation chromatography revealed that the separate peptides NPY and CPON were the major products. No significant amounts of a large mol wt precursor containing both immunoreactivities was found. Among the other tumors, 6 of 22 carcinoid tumors, 2 of 2 somatostatinomas, and 3 of 18 insulinomas contained detectable amounts of NPY. Plasma NPY concentrations were very low in normal subjects, and extraction and a 10-fold concentration step were necessary to establish the normal range (0.35-1.25 pmol/L). Plasma NPY concentrations were detectable in unextracted plasma (10 pmol/L) in 50% of patients with pheochromocytomas, but no correlation was found between plasma NPY concentrations and either plasma norepinephrine or epinephrine concentrations. These results indicate that 1) NPY and CPON are present in most, but not all, pheochromocytomas and ganglioneuroblastomas; 2) secretion of NPY immunoreactivity may be independent of that of catecholamines; 3) CPON immunoreactivity is present in plasma of patients with pheochromocytoma; 4) the majority of NPY and CPON immunoreactivities appears to be in the form of the separate free peptide, and there is very little precursor containing both immunoreactivities expressed in these tumors; and 5) NPY immunoreactivity is present in a variety of other endocrine tumors.\r"

We studied the in vitro status of adrenergic receptors controlling lipolysis (beta 1) and antilipolysis (alpha 2) in small fragments of adipose tissue from abdominal and gluteal sc depots of six obese women and six obese men. Lipolysis rate was measured by a double isotope technique which detects changes in the specific activity of fatty acids esterified to newly synthesized triglycerides. The lipolytic response to the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol was significantly greater in abdominal compared to gluteal adipose tissue in both sexes. There was, however, no significant sex-related difference in response to isoproterenol within sites. When tissue from both sites was exposed to the mixed alpha/beta-adrenergic agonist norepinephrine there was a significantly greater lipolytic response in abdominal tissue. Within-site by sex analysis indicated no significant difference in the lipolytic response of gluteal tissue to norepinephrine, but a greater response of abdominal tissue in women. Given the apparently equal degree of beta responsiveness in abdominal tissue of both sexes, the norepinephrine data suggest that men have more abdominal alpha 2 receptor function (antilipolysis) than women. This difference may partially explain the greater tendency for men to accumulate adipose tissue in the abdominal region.\r"

Nine type I diabetic patients, aged 18-32 yr, who had been diabetic for 4-23 yr and had reduced nerve conduction velocities received CSII for 4 weeks and subsequently ICT for up to 26 weeks. Motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities (MNCV and SNCV) and heart rate variations during deep breathing (E/I ratio), during lying and standing (30/15 ratio), and during the Valsalva maneuver (Valsalva ratio) were measured before CSII and at intervals of 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, and 26 weeks. During CSII, MNCV and SNCV increased significantly (P less than 0.01), the E/I ratio improved in seven patients (P less than 0.05), the Valsalva ratio increased in eight patients (P less than 0.01), and the 30/15 ratio increased in five patients. The E/I ratio increased significantly earlier than the Valsalva ratio (P less than 0.025). During ICT, nerve conduction velocity slightly, though not significantly, decreased, and the results of the cardiovascular reflex tests also gradually declined. The hemoglobin A1 concentration before initiation of CSII and the diminution of the hemoglobin A1 concentration during CSII therapy were inversely correlated to the increase in MNCV (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.05, respectively). In conclusion, CSII improved peripheral and autonomic nervous system function, but the improvement diminished somewhat during ICT.\r"

This study was conducted to determine the quantity of cortisol associated with erythrocytes under physiological conditions and to assess the potential availability of that cortisol for tissue uptake. The erythrocyte-associated cortisol was determined from the volume of plasma measured using [125I]human serum albumin, the concentration of cortisol in plasma, and the total concentration of cortisol in blood. The plasma unbound cortisol fraction was determined by ultrafiltration and was used to calculate a partitioning coefficient that describes the distribution of cortisol between erythrocyte-associated and plasma unbound components. The cortisol partitioning coefficient (erythrocyte-associated cortisol concentration divided by plasma unbound cortisol concentration) did not vary significantly over a wide range of cortisol levels, nor was it affected by the presence or absence of corticosteroid-binding globulin. The cortisol partitioning coefficient in six normal men averaged 2.62 +/- 0.16 (mean +/- SD). Computer analysis of the distribution of cortisol among blood components indicated that at all cortisol levels, the proportion of blood cortisol associated with erythrocytes would exceed that which is plasma unbound or albumin-bound. The rate of dissociation of cortisol from erythrocytes was measured to determine if the kinetics of dissociation would be consistent with the tissue availability of erythrocyte-associated cortisol. Indeed, the half-time of dissociation was extremely rapid (less than 2.3 s). These results indicate that erythrocyte-associated cortisol is a substantial component of blood cortisol and that erythrocytes may serve as a major conduit for the transport of cortisol to the tissues.\r"

In more than 60 patients treated since 1961, the remission rate was 25% in the first 2 yr. This report looks at these same patients again, followed for an additional 5 yr. Survival analysis methods applied to the follow-up data on 63 children confirm our original statistical findings and suggest a continuing remission rate of 25% every 2.1 +/- 0.4 (+/- SE) yr regardless of the duration of previous therapy. The median time to remission was 4.3 +/- 1.5 yr, and 75% of patients are predicted to be in remission in 10.9 +/- 2.3 yr. Of 36 patients who went into remission, defined by their being euthyroid for 1 yr after cessation of therapy, 1 relapsed, and 2 developed spontaneous hypothyroidism; the remainder are euthyroid 1-11.7 yr after therapy was discontinued. Of 14 who switched from medical therapy, 2 of 7 treated surgically and 4 of 7 treated with 131I are hypothyroid. Only 1 patient had a significant adverse reaction to both methimazole and propylthiouracil. While medical therapy may have some direct effect on the autoimmune response in hyperthyroidism, its role in affecting the time to ultimate remission is unknown. These data, however, describe the course of children so treated and allow us to present therapeutic options initially or during treatment based on statistically derived probabilities of outcome.\r"

To investigate the effects of a low fat diet on estrogen metabolism, six normal young women were studied while eating a Western-style high fat diet and again after 2 months of consuming a defined low fat diet. Both studies involved the simultaneous administration of [3H]estradiol [( 3H]E2) orally and [14C]E2 iv and the subsequent collection of multiple blood samples and urine for 96 h. The blood samples were analyzed for radioactivity as estrone (E1), E2, their glucuronides, and E1 sulfate. An aliquot of the pooled 96-h urine was analyzed for radioactivity as the glucuronides and sulfates of E1, E2, estriol, 16 alpha-hydroxyestrone (16 alpha-OHE1), and the catechol estrogens, i.e. 2-hydroxy and 2-methoxy metabolites of E1 and E2. The low fat diet resulted in a consistent and significant (P less than 0.05) decrease in urinary excretion of both 16-hydroxylated metabolites, estriol and 16 alpha-OHE1, expressed as a percentage of administered dose of [3H]E2 and [14C]E2, and an increase in the excretion of the catechol estrogens. These changes in metabolite excretion were not, however, mirrored by changes in the MCRs or conversion ratios of either [3H]E2 or [14C]E2. Thus, while neither the clearance of E2 from the blood nor its absorption from the intestinal tract was altered by a relatively short term decrease in dietary fat, there was a shift in the pattern of urinary metabolites away from the purported carcinogenic estrogen (16 alpha-OHE1) and toward the less active catechol estrogens. This may represent an important mechanism whereby low fat diets decrease the risk of breast cancer.\r"

These cells were exposed in vivo to human menopausal gonadotropin and hCG gonadotropin with or without clomiphene citrate. Steroid production rates were compared between cells cultured in control medium and those cultured in medium containing a nonaromatizable androgen [dihydrotestosterone (DHT)] or an aromatizable androgen [androstenedione (A'D)]. Some cultures received A'D from 3-12 days; other cultures received DHT alone for 3, 6, or 9 days before the addition of A'D for 3 days. The effect on steroid production during the culture interval before the addition of A'D also was evaluated. Exposure to A'D increased estrogen production over 50-fold compared with that in control cells or those treated with DHT (P less than 0.001). DHT also failed to alter estrogen production when A'D was added to cultures. Furthermore, the delay in introducing A'D to the cultures for up to 9 days did not decrease subsequent estrogen production compared with that in cultures continually exposed to A'D or DHT plus A'D. Progesterone production was substantial for at least 12 days of culture and was unaffected by the presence of androgen. These results do not confirm previous studies using murine or porcine granulosa cells, which suggested that androgen receptor-dependent mechanisms were involved in increasing estrogen and/or progesterone production in vitro. Rather, they indicate that androgen may not be required to maintain aromatase capability per se in human granulosa-luteal cells previously exposed to ovulation-inducing quantities of gonadotropin.\r"

The blood production rates (PR) were calculated as the product of the MCR and the 24-h integrated serum concentrations (IC). The mean MCR and PR of A and DHEA were significantly higher in the obese women than in the normal weight women. There was, however, no difference in the mean IC of each androgen in the 2 groups. The MCR and PR of A and DHEA were each correlated with the body mass index (BMI; kilograms per m2). The MCR and PR of A and the MCR of DHEA were also correlated with the ratio of waist circumference to hip circumference (WHR). However, the PR of DHEA was not correlated with WHR. There was no correlation between the IC of either androgen and BMI or WHR. However, partial correlation analysis revealed that correction of the BMI for WHR resulted in a significant negative correlation between BMI and IC of A. We conclude that the MCR and PR of A and DHEA were increased in obese nonhirsute eumenorrheic women; there was a strong correlation between BMI and the MCR and PR of A and DHEA; upper segment obesity, as measured by WHR, was correlated with the MCR and PR of A and the MCR of DHEA, but not with the PR of DHEA; and circulating DHEA and A were maintained at normal levels in the obese eumenorrheic women despite an increase in the MCR, which suggests that a servo-mechanism is operative which registers the body size and adjusts the PR according to the MCR.\r"

From age 13 yr to adulthood, a dramatic rise of testosterone was observed while there was no marked change in dihydrotestosterone or androstane-3 alpha,17 beta-diol.

A further rise of both 5 alpha-reduced steroid glucuronides occurred when testosterone levels increased during puberty. Our data indicate that 5 alpha-reduced steroid glucuronides are good markers of peripheral transformation of adrenal and testicular C-19 steroids. In addition, since 5 alpha-reduced steroid glucuronides are detected before puberty, there must be a peripheral conversion of adrenal C-19 steroids into testosterone during prepubertal development.\r"

Stromal and epithelial cells was isolated by collagenase and hyaluronidase digestion of endometrial tissue. The synthesis of proteins released into the cell culture medium was assayed by [35S]methionine incorporation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by fluorography. The relative proportions of individual proteins secreted by stromal and epithelial cells varied. However, 29K, 128K, and 150K proteins were more abundant in media from epithelial cell cultures, whereas 60K and 70K proteins were more abundant in media from stromal cell cultures. More proteins were secreted by cells obtained in the luteal phase than by those obtained in the proliferative phase. R5020 consistently stimulated the synthesis of a minor protein of 51,000 mol wt secreted by both epithelial and stromal cells. Physiological concentrations of dexamethasone, dihydrotestosterone, or estradiol did not stimulate synthesis of the 51K protein. The effect of R5020 was concentration dependent; maximal synthesis occurred with 10 nM R5020 and 4 days of treatment. This 51K protein is different from the estrogen-regulated 52K protein of breast cancers. These results indicate that cultured endometrial cells can synthesize and release a variety of proteins in vitro. One of them, the 51K protein, is a marker of responsiveness to progestin.\r"

With the objective of predicting outcome, serum hCG titers were determined in serial samples from 48 women with clinical pregnancy (conception where fetal sac demonstrated by ultrasound). Although the mean hCG levels were lower at 8-14, 15-21, 22-28 and 29-35 days post-ET in the 18 women who eventually aborted, 0.18 (range 0.01-0.49), 1.5 (0.05-4.7), 6.4 (0.68-27), and 15 nmol/L (0.35-59), respectively, than in the 30 women whose pregnancy went to term, 0.48 (0.01-5.5), 2.2 (0.33-20), 10 (0.46-25), and 116 nmol/L (0.76-335) respectively, the ranges overlapped significantly, limiting the use of serum hCG in prediction. In earlier studies, the free beta-subunit of hCG was demonstrated in the serum of women with natural fertilization pregnancy, 2-6 weeks post ovulation. We used the RIA with 1E5 free beta-subunit monoclonal antibody to measure this component in the IVF serial blood samples. Of the 30 women who had pregnancies that went to term, samples from 28 were positive for this marker by 28 days post-ET (0.02-3.0 nmol/L). In 18 women who aborted, however, only 1 had a detectable serum hCG free beta-subunit level by 28 days post-ET. We conclude that a detectable serum hCG free beta-subunit level by 28 days post-ET may indicate normal term pregnancy outcome.\r"

However, despite the broad clinical application of this radionuclide, very little is known about the mechanism by which 99mTcO4- enters a cell. We report evidence here that 99mTcO4- shares the Na+/K+/Cl- co-transport system localized to the basolateral membrane of rat parotid acinar cells. 99mTcO4- uptake by these cells was quite rapid (t1/2 approximately 30 s), was completely inhibited by the loop diuretics furosemide and bumetanide, and was markedly dependent on the presence of Na+, K+, and Cl- in the extracellular medium. Relative to uptake measured in the presence of physiological extracellular salt concentrations (Hanks' salts), 99mTcO4- uptake was inhibited 80% by sodium replacement and 50% by potassium replacement. When Cl- was replaced with the physiologically inert anion gluconate a threefold stimulation in 99mTcO4- uptake resulted. These observations provide strong evidence that 99mTcO4- can substitute for Cl- as a substrate for the Na+/K+/Cl- co-transporter and indicate that 99mTcO4- uptake by salivary glands (e.g., as seen with salivary scintiscans), and possibly by a variety of other tissues, reflects the functional activity of this co-transport mechanism.\r"

To determine whether one class of fibroblast-inhibitory factors, the interferons (IFNs), plays a role in terminating fibrosis by acting as persistent fibroblast deactivators, we inhibited (40-60%) the growth and collagen production of normal dermal fibroblasts and hypercollagen-producing scleroderma fibroblasts by short-term exposure to IFN-alpha, beta, or gamma. During subsequent subculture in the absence of IFNs, the growth and collagen production of normal fibroblasts and the growth of scleroderma fibroblasts increased to untreated control levels after two to three passages. In contrast, collagen production by scleroderma fibroblasts remained inhibited for at least five passages (18 cell doublings) and was not further suppressed by subsequent IFN exposure. These data suggest that IFNs may help terminate fibrosis by suppressing persistently activated fibroblast functions.\r"

A mouse model is provided by hemizygotes for mutant alleles at the X-linked mottled locus. Herein we test the possibility that the primary defect in both species is in metallothionein gene regulation. We show that metallothionein-I messenger RNA (mRNA) (mouse) and metallothionein-II mRNA (human) are elevated in mutant fibroblasts. However, comparable dose-response curves in mutant and control cells are generated when mouse metallothionein-I mRNA concentrations are measured in cells exposed to varying concentrations of cadmium or copper (metallothionein inducers). Furthermore, when mutant and control cells are grown to achieve overlapping intracellular copper concentrations in the two cell types, metallothionein-I (mouse) and metallothionein-II (human) mRNA levels are proportional to the intracellular copper concentrations. Finally, in paired determinations in blotchy hemizygote and littermate kidneys containing comparable copper levels, metallothionein-I mRNA contents are very similar. The observations suggest that elevated intracellular copper in these mutants induces metallothionein synthesis by normal regulatory mechanisms.\r"

Experiments were designed in an animal model to determine whether ethanol alters selectively the absorption of riboflavin and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), the predominant dietary form of the vitamin. Rats received by gavage a liver homogenate to which either [14C]riboflavin or [14C]FAD was added with either ethanol or isocaloric sucrose solutions. Ethanol markedly diminished the bioavailability of [14C]FAD to a greater degree than that of [14C]riboflavin. Corroboration of an ethanol-impaired intraluminal hydrolysis of FAD was provided by using everted jejunal segments and measuring mucosal uptake of [14C]riboflavin together with nonradiolabeled FAD. In subsequent studies with mucosal cell extracts, ethanol markedly inhibited activities of FAD pyrophosphatase and flavin mononucleotide (FMN) phosphatase. These findings suggest that dietary sources of riboflavin (FMN and FAD) are not absorbed as well in the presence of ethanol than are vitamin preparations containing riboflavin, which is utilized more readily.\r"

BCKAD is rate-limiting for branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism by muscle; its activity is modulated by phosphorylation-dephosphorylation. In rats fed an adequate protein (25% casein) diet, BCKAD was approximately 2% active postabsorptively and increased to 10% or 16% active after a 25% or 50% protein meal, respectively. Prolonged feeding of a 50% protein diet increased postabsorptive BCKAD activity to 7% with further increases to 40% active postprandially. On a low protein (9% casein) diet BCKAD remained approximately 2% active regardless of meal-feeding. Dose-dependent activation of BCKAD by intravenous leucine in postabsorptive rats was blunted by a low protein diet. We conclude that excesses of dietary protein enhance the capacity of skeletal muscle to oxidize BCAA, muscle conserves BCAA when protein intake is inadequate, and skeletal muscle may play an important role in whole-body BCAA homeostasis.\r"

After 125I-G-actin (nanomole) injection, plasma disappearance paralleled that of DBP and DBP-actin. All injected actin was associated with DBP, without evidence of free actin, actin-gelsolin complexes or actin oligomers. Tissue appearances of 125I-apo-DBP (apo) or holo-DBP were similar, with highest accumulations in perfused liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle. Although more complex phenomena (plasma entry of F-actin and intracellular actin binding proteins) would occur in vivo after cell lysis, our results suggest a role for DBP in the sequestration and disposition of actin monomers in the circulation.\r"

Surfactant treatment decreased both the endothelial and epithelial leaks, and the combination of surfactant and corticosteroid treatments decreased endothelial leaks to 29% of control values and increased compliance more than either treatment alone. The 48-h corticosteroid treatment did not increase alveolar surfactant pool sizes. Corticosteroids significantly changed lung protein leaks independently of surfactant, and improved the response of the preterm lung to surfactant treatments.\r"

Unpurified TSH in serum showed no stimulation of cyclic AMP production in cultured FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells, but after immunopurification showed potent stimulatory activity. Immunoaffinity purification permitted up to 400-fold concentration of serum TSH, allowing bioactivity measurements even in certain normal sera. The limit of detection in the FRTL-5 bioassay was 10 microU of human TSH per 0.5 ml incubate, and half-maximal responses for standard human TSH was 102 +/- 26 (+/- SE) microU/0.5 ml. Immunoaffinity-purified serum TSH varied in bioactivity-to-immunoactivity (B/I) ratios from less than 0.25 to 1.21 among four euthyroid subjects and eight primary hypothyroid patients. An inverse correlation was found between B/I ratios of immunopurified basal TSH and the serum-free T4 (r = -0.7237, P less than 0.01), T4 (r = -0.6650, P less than 0.05), and T3 (r = -0.6382, P less than 0.05). B/I ratios of immunopurified TSH from three hypothyroid patients before and after acute stimulation by thyrotropin-releasing hormone showed no significant change, despite major changes in serum TSH. In summary, the present study shows an inverse relationship between the metabolic status of an individual and the intrinsic bioactivity of TSH.\r"

Carriers' normal immune function would be expected if all their T cells were derived from precursors whose X chromosome bearing the XSCID mutation was inactivated early in embryogenesis. Using somatic cell hybridization to separate the active and inactive X chromosomes and restriction fragment length polymorphisms to distinguish them, we have determined the lymphocyte X inactivation pattern in XSCID carriers and their female relatives. In the T cells of three carriers, the X chromosome bearing the XSCID mutation was consistently inactive. Nonrandom X inactivation was also found in the T cells of one at-risk female, while two others had normal, random X inactivation. This method constitutes a generally applicable carrier test for XSCID.\r"

Rats underwent either transmural infarction by left coronary ligation or sham operation. Both infarct and sham rats were randomized to methylprednisolone 50 mg/kg i.p. X 4 or saline treatment within 24 h after operation. Sacrifice occurred before (3 d) or after (7 d) collagen deposition typically begins. Despite similar infarct size, infarct wall thickness was 1.35 +/- 0.08 mm in the saline and 0.99 +/- 0.12 mm in the methylprednisolone group (P less than 0.001) at 3 d. This decrease in wall thickness was explained by a decrease in the number of myocytes across the infarct wall (r = 0.99; P less than 0.001), suggesting that steroids promote myocyte slippage. Furthermore, methylprednisolone caused no further infarct thinning or cavity dilatation beyond 3 d. Thus, high-dose methylprednisolone given within 24 h after transmural infarction worsens infarct expansion before collagen is laid down by promoting the slippage of necrotic myocytes.\r"

  ".W": "A single infusion of phospholipid liposomes promptly and persistently abolished the ability of hypercholesterolemic rabbit plasma to cause cholesteryl ester loading in cultured macrophages. This phospholipid enrichment of plasma caused moderate stimulation of cellular cholesterol efflux and, unexpectedly, almost complete inhibition of cellular uptake of beta-very low density lipoprotein (beta-VLDL), the major cholesteryl ester-rich particle in hypercholesterolemic rabbit plasma. Cell viability and LDL receptor activity were unaffected. Incubation of liposomes with beta-VLDL resulted in transfer of apolipoprotein-E (apoE) to the liposomes; reisolated apoE-phospholipid liposomes then competed efficiently for cellular apoprotein receptors. Thus, a major mechanism by which phospholipid infusions result in diminished accumulation of cholesteryl ester in cultured macrophages is by blocking cellular uptake of beta-VLDL. The liposomes deplete beta-VLDL of apoE, then compete for receptor-mediated uptake. These results suggest a novel mechanism contributing to the known antiatherogenic effect of phospholipid infusions: infused liposomes acquire apoE, then block uptake of atherogenic lipoproteins by arterial wall macrophages.\r"

  ".W": "Infection of normal individuals with human parvovirus (B19) results in a mild disease (erythema infectiosum) but gives rise to aplastic crises in patients with chronic hemolytic anemias. The effects of this disease on hemopoiesis were investigated following intranasal inoculation of the virus into three volunteers. A typical disease ensued with a viremia peaking at 9 d. Marrow morphology 6 d after inoculation appeared normal but at 10 d there was a severe loss of erythroid precursors followed by a 1-2-g drop in hemoglobin, and an increase in serum immunoreactive erythropoietin. Erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E) from the peripheral blood were considerably reduced, starting at the time of viremia and persisting for 4-8 d depending on the individual. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM) were also affected but the loss started 2 d later. Both CFU-GM and BFU-E showed a sharp overshoot at recovery. In the marrow, BFU-E and CFU-E were reduced at 6 and 10 d in the individual having the longest period of peripheral progenitor loss. In contrast, there was an increase in BFU-E and CFU-E in the subject with least change in peripheral progenitors. In the third subject, with an intermediate picture, there was a loss at 6 d but an increase at 10 d of erythroid progenitors. It is suggested that the architecture of the marrow might partially isolate progenitors from high titers of virus in the serum and individual variation in this respect might give the results observed.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin resistance is characteristic of the diabetic state. To define the role of hyperglycemia in generation of the insulin resistance, we examined the effect of phlorizin treatment on tissue sensitivity to insulin in partially pancreatectomized rats. Five groups were studied: group I, sham-operated controls; group II, partially pancreatectomized diabetic rats with moderate glucose intolerance; group III, diabetic rats treated with phlorizin to normalize glucose tolerance; group IV, phlorizin-treated controls; and group V, phlorizin-treated diabetic rats restudied after discontinuation of phlorizin. Insulin sensitivity was assessed with the euglyemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique in awake, unstressed rats. Insulin-mediated glucose metabolism was reduced by approximately 30% (P less than 0.001) in diabetic rats. Phlorizin treatment of diabetic rats completely normalized insulin sensitivity but had no effect on insulin action in controls. Discontinuation of phlorizin in phlorizin-treated diabetic rats resulted in the reemergence of insulin resistance. These data demonstrate that a reduction of beta-cell mass leads to the development of insulin resistance, and correction of hyperglycemia with phlorizin, without change in insulin levels, normalizes insulin sensitivity. These results provide the first in vivo evidence that hyperglycemia per se can lead to the development of insulin resistance.\r"

Using a radioimmunoassay method, we determined the concentration of URO decarboxylase protein in erythrocytes from a patient with mild HEP and found that the enzyme protein concentration had markedly decreased to less than 7% of the normal controls. This finding, however, was in contrast to the enzyme activity in the patient's erythrocytes, which was 16% of normal control levels and different from previously reported HEP cases in that erythrocytes in our patient contained disproportionately elevated URO decarboxylase activity in comparison to its immunoreactive material. Our findings suggests the possibility of a mutant isozyme in this patient that is not immunoreactive with an antibody raised against the normal enzyme.\r"

We report three patients with the common (palpable purpura) form of the disease, limited to the skin, and successfully treated with moderate doses of dapsone (100-150 mg daily). Although the natural course of leukocytoclastic vasculitis is highly unpredictable, the prompt disappearance of new lesion formation after initiation of treatment and the rapid recurrence of lesions after therapy is discontinued (both often within 4 to 8 days after the critical dose level is reached) reflect drug efficacy. We believe that dapsone deserves wider evaluation as a therapeutic agent for chronic or recurrent cases of the common form of leukocytoclastic vasculitis.\r"

Skin biopsy specimens taken from a sun-exposed site were assessed by light microscopy, electron microscopy, and direct immunofluorescence. Three patients allowed comparative studies to be done on a biopsy specimen from non-sun-exposed skin. Light microscopy findings, including special stains, were not diagnostic of amiodarone-associated cutaneous changes. Electron microscopy, however, displayed distinctive intracytoplasmic inclusions in many cell types, some of which have not been reported previously. These inclusions represent phospholipid membranes associated with amiodarone or its metabolites as the result of a drug-induced lipidosis. Previous reports had postulated the inclusions were lipofuscin. Sun exposure may accelerate the formation of these intracellular deposits because they are more prominent in sun-exposed skin. Four of the above five cases, plus two additional patients, had symptoms compatible with a photosensitivity. Porphyrin assays were normal. Of the six patients phototested, three showed acute reactions to ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB) and significant delayed reactions to UVA and/or UVB. The patients who had normal phototesting were on the drug for shorter periods than those with positive tests.\r"

An inert Teflon membrane with a mesh opening of 74 mu was used for measuring the rate of release. Involved psoriatic and uninvolved human skin collected from the same subjects were used for the permeation study. The permeation of danthron and dianthrone, the major degradation products of anthralin, was also studied with the use of microemulsion gels of 1% danthron and 1% dianthrone, which were prepared in the same way as 1% Westragel. The penetrating anthralin, danthron, and dianthrone were stabilized by a modified receptor fluid, and sample solutions were analyzed by a high-power liquid chromatography method. Involved psoriatic skin was found to be much more permeable to anthralin than was uninvolved psoriatic skin. The slow permeation rate of anthralin, danthron, and dianthrone through normal skin and uninvolved skin indicates that the stratum corneum is the rate-limiting barrier. In involved psoriatic skin, the release rate of anthralin from the topical product becomes the rate-determining step. Large individual variations were found in the permeation of anthralin through involved psoriatic skin, suggesting that the permeation rate of anthralin also may depend on the disease state of psoriatic patients. The anthralin molecule, possessing both hydrophilic and lipophilic centers, diffused significantly faster than did danthron and dianthrone. Westragel, 1%, showed the highest diffusion rate as well as the highest driving force when compared to other commercial 1% anthralin products. This suggests that 1% Westragel may be an optimal design, especially for short-contact anthralin therapy.\r"

Sweat output was measured by use of Persprint paper and the data were quantified by an image analysis computer. The data clearly demonstrate the efficacy of the Drionic unit at all treatment locations in the great majority of subjects. One month posttreatment follow-up showed a statistically significant continued sweat inhibition at the palmar sites. Side effects were common, but none was severe enough to necessitate discontinuation of treatment. Based on the results of this study, we conclude that the Drionic unit appears to have a definite place in the treatment of hyperhidrosis.\r"

  ".W": "A genetic concept is advanced to explain the origin of several sporadic syndromes characterized by a mosaic distribution of skin defects. It is postulated that these disorders are due to the action of a lethal gene surviving by mosaicism. The presence of the mutation in the zygote will lead to death of the embryo at an early stage of development. Cells bearing the mutation can survive only in a mosaic state, in close proximity with normal cells. The mosaic may arise either from a gametic half chromatid mutation or from an early somatic mutation. This concept of origin is proposed to apply to the Schimmelpenning-Feuerstein-Mims syndrome, the McCune-Albright syndrome, the Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, the Sturge-Weber syndrome, and neurocutaneous melanosis. Moreover, this etiologic hypothesis may apply to two other birth defects that have recently been delineated, the Proteus syndrome (partial gigantism of hands or feet, hemihypertrophy, macrocephaly, linear papillomatous epidermal nevus, subcutaneous hemangiomas and lipomas, accelerated growth, and visceral anomalies), and the Delleman-Oorthuys syndrome (orbital cyst, porencephaly, periorbital appendages, and focal aplasia of the skin.\r"
