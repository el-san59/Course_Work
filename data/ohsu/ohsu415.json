  ".W": "We have developed a water-sealed infant calorimeter (IC) system which uses the techniques of closed-circuit spirometry to measure oxygen consumption (VO2) in premature and full-term infants. Carbon dioxide production (VCO2) is simultaneously calculated from the effluent mixed expired CO2 and the circulating flowrate. Respiratory Quotient (RQ) and Energy Expenditure (EE) are then calculated from the primary data. Measurement of VO2, VCO2, and calculation of RQ were +/- 5.0% of predicted values determined by burning ethyl alcohol or volume extraction and CO2 infusion in our bench model. Measurement in 11 premature infants produced mean values for VO2 and VCO2 of 8.5 +/- 2.5 ml/min/kg and 8.5 +/- 2.4 ml/min/kg, respectively. This system is noninvasive, does not interfere with infant tube feedings or iv infusions, and permits safe, long-term monitoring of the infant's metabolic activity. It allows a more exact matching or oral or intravenous feedings to the actual energy expenditure of the infants, and offers potential advantages for the nutritional management of sick infants.\r"

This investigation had a 3-fold purpose: to determine if and to what extent fiber-supplementation changes the chemical composition of stool relative to a fiber-free formula (Ensure); to establish the clinical tolerance of the two new formulas; and to quantify the effects of soy polysaccharide on nutrient bioavailability. The study was conducted in two consecutive phases: A (n = 6 subjects; random assignment to either Ensure or Susta II for 1-2 weeks followed by isocaloric cross-over to the alternate formula for an equal period of time) and B (n = 8 subjects evaluated as in phase A except Enrich replaced Ensure). Each balance week consisted of clinical/subjective monitoring, evaluation of stool composition (H2O and dry weight), apparent nutrient absorption (energy, fat, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Zn, Na, and Cl), and metabolic balance (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, and Cl). Relative to the fiber-free formula the two fiber-supplemented solutions produced increases in fecal N, fat, H2O, and minerals of variable magnitude; there were corresponding reductions in net absorption of organic compounds and minerals. The additional minerals added to the fiber-supplemented formulas and the minimal effects on N absorption preserved balance; the retention of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, and Cl were similar for all three formulas. No adverse clinical effects of the fiber-supplemented formulas were noted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Forty patients with normal gastrointestinal function requiring enteral nutrition were randomized to receive nasogastrically 2-liter/day of polymeric diet (2000 kcal, 12 g N) either from a presterilized 2-liter PVC bag (Express EFI Ltd, UK) or from two 1-liter rigid plastic containers filled with cans of Clinifeed 400 (Roussel Laboratories Ltd, UK). The actual volumes of feed infused were monitored in patients fed for 5 days or more. Both nursing and dietetic staff preferred the 2-liter bags which were more convenient to prepare and use. Significantly larger quantities of prescribed diet were delivered from the 2-liter bags than from the 1-liter containers (p less than 0.001). It was concluded that the 2-liter bag system was potentially more convenient and nutritionally efficacious than 1-liter containers. Although the incidence of microbial contamination associated with the 2-liter bags was low, measures to maintain the sterility of this system may need to be more stringent.\r"

In 15 Sprague-Dawley rats, net transmucosal water flux and net transmucosal and capillary albumin clearances were monitored in jejunal loops before and during intravenous infusion (2.5 ml/min/kg) of Tyrodes solution. This procedure resulted in a 60% reduction in plasma protein concentration and net water secretion into the bowel lumen. Luminal perfusion with the peptide-based formula did not modify the magnitude of the reduction in plasma protein concentration, yet dramatically reduced transmucosal and transcapillary albumin clearances (p less than 0.05). In addition, a net absorptive water flux was maintained with the peptide-based formula during volume expansion despite hypoproteinemia. The response to luminal perfusion with the intact protein formula were not different from controls. The results of this study are consistent with previous observations that enteral feeding with a peptide-based formula significantly attenuates the diarrhea associated with acute hypoalbuminemia in the critically ill patient.\r"

  ".W": "The possibility that hypercalciuria could cause calcium stone formation through a mechanism other than by increasing urinary saturation of stone-forming calcium salts was explored. The effect of increasing calcium concentration on the inhibitor activity against the spontaneous precipitation of calcium oxalate was examined in whole urine (in the presence of naturally occurring inhibitors) and in synthetic media (with added inhibitors). In 11 patients with calcium nephrolithiasis, the induced hypercalciuria from calcium supplementation (600 mg/day) caused a significant fall in the urinary inhibitory activity against calcium oxalate precipitation, as shown by a decline in the formation product ratio from 12.6 +/- 1.1 SEM to 9.6 +/- 1.4 (P less than 0.005). In order to more fully explore this observation, the effect of increasing calcium concentration on the inhibitory activities of citrate (2 mM), chondroitin sulfate (0.05 mg/liter) and a heterogeneous group of naturally-occurring urinary inhibitors (1.0 mg/liter) against calcium oxalate precipitation was examined in vitro in synthetic solutions. The inhibitory actions of both citrate and chondroitin sulfate were significantly attenuated by increasing calcium concentration from 0.25 mM to 6.0 mM (P less than 0.01). However, raising the calcium concentration in synthetic media containing a mixture of partially purified urinary inhibitors produced a significant rise in the urinary inhibitory activity of this macromolecular mixture (P less than 0.01). We conclude that hypercalciuria can attenuate the inhibitory activities of citrate and chondroitin sulfate against calcium oxalate precipitation while at the same time accentuating the inhibitory activity of naturally-occurring urinary inhibitors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The data are fit to two models that predict that the mass removed depends either linearly or logarithmically on fluence. Although the data are best fit by a linear dependence upon fluence, plasma formation at high fluences prohibited obtaining data over a wide enough fluence range to differentiate unambiguously between the two models. Ablation efficiency, ablation thresholds, and the optical penetration depth at 10.6 micron were obtained from the measurements.\r"

  ".W": "The enterococci, members of the group D streptococci and the predominant aerobic streptococci of the gastrointestinal and female genital tracts, have long been recognized as significant pathogens in infective endocarditis. Over the past 2 decades, enterococci have become increasingly important nosocomial pathogens, related to their intrinsic resistance to many antibiotics, especially the cephalosporins, and the greatly increased use of antimicrobial therapy in hospitals. Recent reports have documented an alarming increase in the frequency of high-level resistance to aminoglyclosides, and strains resistant to ampicillin by production of a beta-lactamase and to vancomycin have now been encountered. We have reviewed the clinical features and course of 153 cases of enterococcal bacteremia occurring in a university hospital over the 14-year period, 1970 to 1983, 1) to understand better the importance of enterococci as human pathogens, 2) to identify the clinical features of enterococcal bacteremia, 3) to isolate those findings that help to identify associated endocarditis, and 4) to develop guidelines for more effective antimicrobial therapy of bacteremic enterococcal infections. The annual incidence of enterococcal bacteremia in our center rose three-fold over the period reviewed. In 65 cases (42%), bacteremia was polymicrobial, caused by Enterococcus and at least 1 other microorganism, usually an aerobic gram-negative bacillus. Most bacteremias were nosocomial and derived from infections of the urinary tract (29 cases), intravenous catheters (24 cases), intra-abdominal infections or surgical wounds (46 cases), burn wounds (25 cases), or cholangitis (21 cases); only 1 case originated from a pneumonia. Endocarditis was identified in association with 12 of 35 community-acquired bacteremias, but only 1 of 118 bacteremias acquired in the hospital (P less than .001). Endocarditis was also significantly associated with pre-existent valvular heart disease and cryptogenic bacteremia, and was negatively associated with polymicrobial enterococcal bacteremia (no endocarditis in 65 cases, P less than .001). Isolated enterococcal bacteremia produced an indolent infection rarely associated with shock (3 of 64 cases evaluated, all cases due to valve destruction by endocarditis); conversely, with polymicrobial enterococcal bacteremia, primarily with gram-negative bacilli, shock or disseminated intravascular coagulation developed in 50% of cases (P less than .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Among these, neurofibromatosis 1 (von Recklinghausen's disease or peripheral neurofibromatosis) and neurofibromatosis 2 (central or bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis) have been established as distinct disorders. We studied 15 affected male and 8 affected female members of one large kindred with neurofibromatosis 2. None of the patients met the diagnostic criteria for neurofibromatosis 1. Between the ages of 15 and 53 years, the patients had multiple central nervous system tumors of various types--mainly, bilateral acoustic neuromas. Two or more tumors eventually developed in 20 of the patients; 9 had evidence of only bilateral acoustic neuromas. Meningiomas and ependymomas were more common among the young patients; those who initially presented with acoustic neuromas were nearly a decade older. Intracranial nontumoral calcifications were present in most patients and were also found in symptom-free children. The presence of such lesions is probably a prodromic feature of neurofibromatosis 2. Simultaneous analysis of D22S1 and IGLV DNA markers for coinheritance with neurofibromatosis 2 indicates that the locus for the disease is near the center of the long arm of chromosome 22 (22q11.1----22q13.1). The eventual isolation of this disease gene may reveal a cause of the most common intracranial tumors in humans.\r"

It has been postulated that we cannot see single photons because of a retinal noise arising from randomly occurring thermal isomerizations. Direct recordings have since demonstrated the existence of electrical 'dark' rod events indistinguishable from photoisomerization signals. Their mean rate of occurrence is roughly consistent with the 'dark light' in psychophysical threshold experiments, and their thermal parameters justify an identification with thermal isomerizations. In the retina of amphibians, a small proportion of sensitive ganglion cells have a performance-limiting noise that is low enough to be well accounted for by these events. Here we study the performance of dark-adapted toads and frogs and show that the performance limit of visually guided behaviour is also set by thermal isomerizations. As visual sensitivity limited by thermal events should rise when the temperature falls, poikilothermous vertebrates living at low temperatures should then reach light sensitivities unattainable by mammals and birds with optical factors equal. Comparison of different species at different temperatures shows a correlation between absolute threshold intensities and estimated thermal isomerization rates in the retina.\r"

It occurs in the mammalian brain, mainly in axons, and is a component of the neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer's disease. Tau was recently sequenced, but there remains a short-age of structural data on the protein. We have now prepared paracrystals of tau suitable for electron microscopy and image processing. They show distinct transverse banding and polarity, indicating that the protein subunits are aligned with the same orientations. In contrast to other paracrystals, those of tau protein can stretch or contract continuously by more than three-fold; the axial repeats range from 22 to 68 nm. After scaling to a common period, the density distributions are closely superimposable. This suggests that tau is an elastic molecule.\r"

Step regression analysis showed that 34% of the variance in symptom severity was explained by four variables: PMS in the patient's mother, low level of exercise, younger age, and more children. These significant relationships with severity of PMS have not previously been identified and suggest a role of familial and daily stress factors in this complex syndrome.\r"

All but two of the culture-positive patients admitted sexual activity before the abuse, and it is likely that most of the infections were acquired during this previous sexual activity. Concomitant infection with N gonorrhoeae was found in seven adolescents positive for C trachomatis. No adolescents in this study exhibited a positive VDRL. Victims of abuse should be tested for both gonococcal and chlamydial infection. These data show that if antibiotic prophylaxis is used for the sexually abused adolescent, it should be directed against both C trachomatis and N gonorrhoeae.\r"

Seven of the eight infants displayed an episode of one or more of the following symptoms: apnea, bradycardia, temperature instability and hepatosplenomegaly. These episodes were temporally related to recovery of M. pachydermatis from clinical specimens. The seven symptomatic infants had received multiple antibiotics as well as long term hyperalimentation, including lipids, by infusion through deep vein catheters; the single asymptomatic infant did not.

The wild-type (with Asp-189 in the mature trypsin sequence) and mutant (Ser-189) trypsinogens were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity, activated by enterokinase, and tested with a series of fluorogenic tetrapeptide substrates with the general formula succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Xaa-AMC, where AMC is 7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin and Xaa is Lys, Arg, Tyr, Phe, Leu, or Trp. As compared to [Asp189]trypsin, the activity of [Ser189]trypsin on lysyl and arginyl substrates decreased by about 5 orders of magnitude while its Km values increased only 2- to 6-fold. In contrast, [Ser189]trypsin was 10-50 times more active on the less preferred, chymotrypsin-type substrates (tyrosyl, phenylalanyl, leucyl, and tryptophanyl). The activity of [Ser189]trypsin on lysyl substrate was about 100-fold greater at pH 10.5 than at pH 7.0, indicating that the unprotonated lysine is preferred. Assuming the reaction mechanisms of the wild-type and mutant enzymes to be the same, we calculated the changes in the transition-state energies for various enzyme-substrate pairs to reflect electrostatic and hydrogen-bond interactions. The relative binding energies (E) in the transition state are as follows: EII greater than EPP greater than EPA greater than EIP approximately equal to EIA, where I = ionic, P = nonionic but polar, and A = apolar residues in the binding pocket. These side-chain interactions become prominent during the transition of the Michaelis complex to the tetrahedral transition-state complex.\r"

  ".W": "The activation of Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaM-KII) by Ca2+/CaM results in autophosphorylation and the generation of Ca2+/CaM-independent enzyme activity. We postulated that CaM binding and subsequent autophosphorylation alters the conformation of CaM-KII and exposes its substrate-binding and catalytic site(s). Previous peptide mapping studies on CaM-KII demonstrated the close proximity of CaM-binding and autophosphorylation domains. Analyses of the deduced amino acid sequences encoding CaM-KII have allowed the identification of its CaM-binding domain and have revealed two consensus phosphorylation sites that flank this regulatory domain. We report herein the distinct properties of two synthetic peptides modeled after the CaM-binding domain of CaM-KII. The first peptide binds CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner and is an antagonist of CaM-KII activation (IC50 approximately equal to 75 nM). It does not, however, inhibit CaM-KII activity. A second peptide containing the same CaM-binding domain plus a putative autophosphorylation sequence at its N terminus displayed bifunctional regulatory properties. In addition to being a CaM antagonist, the latter was a potent inhibitor of Ca2+/CaM-independent kinase activity (IC50 approximately equal to 2 microM). We suggest that this bifunctional peptide represents an active site-directed inhibitory element of CaM-KII. The separation of CaM antagonist and active site-directed inhibitory properties of this peptide distinguishes CaM-KII from other CaM-dependent enzymes in which bifunctional regulatory properties appear to reside in the same peptide domain. These results indicate that the definition of site-directed inhibitory peptides should, in some cases, be expanded to include bona fide phosphorylation sites.\r"

The oligonucleotides studied were directed against different regions of mouse alpha- or beta-globin mRNAs. Freshly prepared reticulocyte lysates were found to contain 1-2% of the level of RNase H in nucleated cells. This level of activity was sufficient to cleave nearly 100% of the targeted mRNA at the site of hybridization with a complementary oligodeoxynucleotide in 1 hr under conditions of active translation. Using poly(rA).oligo(dT) as a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme, hybrid arrest by oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to the sequence spanning the initiation codon or to a sequence in the coding region was found to be due entirely to cleavage of mRNA by RNase H. Hybridization of oligodeoxynucleotides adjacent to the cap site of beta-globin mRNA, but not the alpha-globin mRNA, also inhibited protein synthesis directly. Even in this case, however, cleavage of the mRNA by RNase H was the predominant pathway of inhibition.\r"

In studies of the molecular mechanisms by which these cells are regulated by IFN-gamma, the transcriptional activation of an IFN-gamma-inducible gene, gamma.1, in human macrophage-like cell lines was examined. Transcription of this gene is rapidly induced by 0.1-1 unit of IFN-gamma. In addition, gamma.1 transcription is efficiently induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, which is known to activate protein kinase C (PKC). Both stimulators of gamma.1 transcription induce the translocation of PKC from the cytosol of a membrane fraction. Two selective inhibitors of PKC, H7 and sphingosine, suppressed not only the induction of gamma.1 mRNA but transcription of HLA-DR by IFN-gamma as well. These findings establish that PKC plays a significant role in the signal transduction pathway leading to transcriptional activation of some IFN-gamma-regulated genes of cells of the mononuclear phagocyte lineage.\r"

Contrary to previously proposed models regarding its function, we conclude that the L3T4 molecule is involved at some stage of the lytic interaction between the class I-specific L3T4+ effector cell and its target cell by a mechanism for which there is not an obligatory requirement for H-2 class II antigen expression by the target cell. L3T4 may be an early component of the system that transduces the activation signal from the T-cell receptor complex to the cytoplasm, a cell-surface receptor for a yet undefined natural ligand that delivers a negative signal to the killer T cell, or it may modulate the avidity of the antigen-specific T-cell receptor through a direct physical association with it.\r"

  ".W": "Phagocytic cells, such as macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, produce a \"respiratory burst\" in which oxygen is reduced to superoxide and other active oxygen species responsible for many of the microbicidal, tumoricidal, and inflammatory activities of these cells. Interferon gamma has been shown to augment phagocyte superoxide production, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect have remained unknown. Recently a key component of the oxidase, phagocyte cytochrome b, has been characterized as a heterodimer of a 91-kDa glycoprotein and a 22-kDa polypeptide. The present studies examined the effects of human recombinant interferon gamma on the expression of the genes for these components of the cytochrome b. In vitro treatment with interferon gamma substantially increases the level of phagocyte cytochrome b heavy chain gene transcripts in normal polymorphonuclear leukocytes, normal monocyte-derived macrophages, and the monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1. Light chain gene transcripts are less affected. In monocyte-derived macrophages and THP-1 cells, the enhanced expression of the heavy chain gene appears in large part attributable to increased rates of transcription. Treatment of monocyte-derived macrophages with human recombinant interferon alpha (a down-regulator of the respiratory burst) decreased the heavy chain transcript levels; interferon beta produced no detectable change. These findings demonstrate the responsiveness of one essential component of the phagocyte oxidase system to activation by interferon gamma and provide a rationale for its use to augment phagocytic function in chronic granulomatous disease.\r"

The positive regulation of CRH by glucocorticoids suggests that the rise in CRH preceding parturition could result from the previously described rise in fetal glucocorticoids. Furthermore, this increase in placental CRH could stimulate, via adrenocorticotropic hormone, a further rise in fetal glucocorticoids, completing a positive feedback loop that would be terminated by delivery.\r"

The alpha- and beta 1-interferon genes have been assigned to this chromosome region (9p21-22). We now present evidence of the homozygous deletion of the interferon genes in neoplastic hematopoietic cell lines and primary leukemia cells in the presence or absence of chromosomal deletions that are detectable at the level of the light microscope. In these cell lines, the deletion of the interferon genes is accompanied by a deficiency of 5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (EC 2.4.2.28), an enzyme of purine metabolism. These homozygous deletions may be associated with the loss of a tumor-suppressor gene that is involved in the development of these neoplasias. The relevant genes may be either the interferon genes themselves or a gene that has a tumor-suppressor function and is closely linked to them.\r"

An example is anti-Sm sera, which recognize proteins associated with small nuclear RNA molecules [small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) particles]. In this paper anti-Sm sera were used to probe immunoblots of various rat tissues. A previously unidentified Mr 28,000 polypeptide was recognized by these anti-Sm sera. This polypeptide, referred to as \"N,\" is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, being most abundant in rat brain, less so in heart, and undetectable in the other tissues examined. Immunoprecipitation experiments using antibodies directed against the cap structure of small nuclear RNAs have demonstrated that N is a snRNP-associated polypeptide. Anti-Sm serum was also used to isolate a partial cDNA clone (lambda rb91) from a rat brain phage lambda gt11 cDNA expression library. On RNA blots, the 450-base-pair cDNA insert of this clone hybridized to a 1600-nucleotide mRNA species with an identical tissue distribution to N, suggesting that lambda rb91 encodes at least part of N. A longer cDNA clone was obtained by rescreening the library with lambda rb91. In vitro transcription and subsequent translation of this subcloned, longer insert (pGMA2) resulted in a protein product with the same electrophoretic and immunological properties as N, confirming that pGMA2 encodes N. The tissue distribution of N and the involvement of snRNP particles in nuclear pre-mRNA processing may imply a role for N in tissue-specific pre-mRNA splicing.\r"

Indications for percutaneous gastrostomy included severe injury to the central nervous system (nine patients), malignancy (seven patients), failure to thrive (four patients), degenerative central nervous system disease (one patient), and miscellaneous conditions (three patients). All procedures were performed under local anesthesia and sedation. An antegrade approach is described for percutaneous gastrostomy and percutaneous gastrojejunostomy placement. No major complication occurred, and only three skin infections have been encountered. The children were evaluated and followed up by a nutritional support team. Early experience with percutaneous gastrostomy and percutaneous gastrojejunostomy in the pediatric population suggests that the technique is safe and applicable to children of all ages and sizes. In particular, the antegrade approach appears to be an acceptable solution for enteric alimentation.\r"

A chimeric alpha i/alpha s cDNA was constructed that encodes a polypeptide composed of the amino terminal 60% of an alpha i chain and the carboxyl terminal 40% of alpha s. The cDNA was introduced via a retroviral vector into S49 cyc- cells, which lack endogenous alpha s. Although less than half of the hybrid alpha chain is derived from alpha s, its ability to mediate beta-adrenoceptor stimulation of adenylyl cyclase matched that of the normal alpha s polypeptide expressed from the same retroviral vector in cyc- cells. This result indicates that carboxyl terminal amino acid sequences of alpha s contain the structural features that are required for specificity of interactions with the effector enzyme, adenylyl cyclase, as well as with the hormone receptor.\r"

Single lesions were noted in 32 patients. Multiple lesions were identified in 14 patients. Seven had normal scans. In 23 patients small focal areas of increased signal on T2-weighted scans within the brain were though to represent heterotopias. Eight patients had chiasmal gliomas and two had optic nerve gliomas. Nine patients had parenchymal gliomas, two had ischemic changes, and one had a colloid cyst. Extraaxial lesions included acoustic neuromas (five patients), meningiomas (four), trigeminal neurofibromas (one), and dysplasia of a sphenoid wing (two). Of the 30 asymptomatic patients referred for screening, lesions were found in 23. MR was found to be an excellent method of imaging known disease and of detecting lesions in asymptomatic patients. Because of the large number of asymptomatic lesions detected in this population, a screening MR study is recommended in patients with neurofibromatosis.\r"

Definitive evaluation has been limited because most randomized trials have had relatively small sample sizes. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis and combined the results of 17 trials. We assessed exercise test duration as the primary end point. At 3 to 4 hours after patch application, there was a 77-second increase in exercise duration (p = 0.02) for a 5 mg/24 hour dose and a 114-second increase in exercise duration (p = 0.001) for a 10 mg/24 hour dose. At 24 hours, however, the 29-second increase in exercise duration for a 10 mg/24 hour dose was not significant (p greater than 0.1), despite persistent decreases in systolic blood pressure, an increase in heart rate, and a \"therapeutic\" plasma nitroglycerin concentration. The findings indicate that the 10 mg/24 hour dose is not efficacious at 24 hours after application and support the hypothesis that nitroglycerin's effect on exercise performance is attenuated by nitrate tolerance even though hemodynamic effects and adequate blood levels persist.\r"

To determine the effect of inhibiting prostaglandin production on the response to nitroglycerin, either placebo or aspirin (650 mg) was administered 1 hour prior to the administration of nitroglycerin (432 micrograms) sublingually to 40 healthy volunteers in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over study. Prior to nitroglycerin administration, blood pressure and pulse rate were determined noninvasively every 2 minutes until stable conditions were reached, and then after nitroglycerin administration determinations were made every 1 minute for the first 10 minutes, every 2 minutes for the next 10 minutes, and every 5 minutes until 30 minutes had elapsed. At peak response in the placebo study, nitroglycerin lowered systolic pressure from 117 +/- 10 to 111 +/- 10 mm Hg (p less than 0.0001). Unexpectedly, nitroglycerin increased diastolic pressure from 75 +/- 8 to 80 +/- 7 mm Hg (p less than 0.005), thus reducing pulse pressure significantly. Pulse rate after nitroglycerin increased from 72 +/- 11 to 85 +/- 14 (p less than 0.001). Aspirin slightly modified the pattern of response at 1 minute but altered neither the peak hemodynamic responses nor the areas under the time-pressure and time-pulse curves. Thus nitroglycerin-induced prostaglandin production does not play a major role in the systemic hemodynamic response to nitroglycerin in vivo.\r"

We have tested hemodynamics in our laboratory by using a cost-effective, powerful microcomputer-based portable noninvasive technique, which makes possible the ensemble averaging of impedance cardiographic waveforms. In conjunction with physiologic maneuvers, the technique has been implemented at our institution and has provided helpful information in our experience in evaluating volume overload, hypertension, hypotension, shock, and heart failure. It is hoped that this noninvasive, relatively cost-effective approach will be more widely appreciated in the future, given the economic realities of medicine today.\r"

The HindIII fragment detected by the JH probe includes a highly polymorphic region 5' to the Ig heavy chain locus, and hence variant germline bands may be seen on autoradiography that can be mistaken for Ig gene rearrangements. The use of several different restriction enzymes and the analysis of the constitutional DNA allows a clear distinction to be made between somatic gene rearrangements and DNA polymorphisms.\r"

There was a moderate correlation (r = 0.73, slope = 0.221, intercept = 1.005, n = 57 pairs) in the two assays of plasma plasminogen before the administration of streptokinase. After streptokinase, however, the correlation of the two assays was poor (r = 0.28, slope = 0.03, y-intercept = 0.003, n = 57 pairs). The decrease in plasma plasminogen by the fluorogenic synthetic substrate assay after streptokinase averaged 95 +/- 5%, with little variation between doses. In contrast, the percentage decrease in plasma plasminogen after streptokinase by the radial immunodiffusion assay averaged only 30 +/- 11%. The percentage change in plasma plasminogen by the two assays is significantly different (P = 0.001). The discrepancy in the percentage change in plasma plasminogen after streptokinase as measured by the fluorogenic synthetic substrate assay and the radial immunodiffusion assay can be explained by a lack of specificity for the antibody to plasminogen in the radial immunodiffusion kit. Antigen-antibody precipitin rings were observed after incubation of antibody with a mixture presumed to contain plasmin, plasmin-alpha 2 antiplasmin complexes, and plasmin-fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products. Based on these data, the fluorogenic synthetic substrate assay for plasma plasminogen is a superior means of following plasminogen depletion in response to thrombolytic therapy after streptokinase treatment for acute myocardial infarction.\r"

Eighty-three Group A streptococci, 77 beta-hemolytic non-Group A streptococci, 74 enterococci, 56 nonenterococcal non-beta-hemolytic streptococci, 1 Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 1 Aerococcus were tested. Compared with results obtained with reference methods (bile esculin agar and 6.5% [w/v] sodium chloride for identification of enterococci, and latex agglutination tests by Streptex [Burroughs Wellcome, NC] for grouping of beta-hemolytic streptococci) both the Identicult-AE and MInitek systems were 100% sensitive and specific for identification of both enterococci and Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci. Advantages of the Identicult-AE system compared with Minitek were the use of a smaller inoculum for which subculture was not necessary, incubation at room temperature rather than at 37 degrees C, and lower cost. Both PYRase kits tested, and in particular the Identicult-AE system, were very easy to use and should be considered as rapid, reliable, and cost-effective alternative methods for the presumptive identification of Group A streptococci and enterococci in the clinical laboratory.\r"

Three hundred ninety-six patients with anovulatory infertility had ovulation induction with human menopausal gonadotropin throughout 1822 treatment cycles; 54 cycles (3%) were complicated by ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Early follicular serum estradiol and prolactin levels were higher in this group than in controls: 75.5 versus 46.2 pg/ml and 18.5 versus 11.7 ng/ml, respectively (p less than 0.01). On the day of human chorionic gonadotropin administration (day 0) the mean serum estradiol level was 1047 +/- 381 in the group with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and 719 +/- 339 pg/ml in controls (p less than 0.0001). In all follicular sizes and in all grades of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome there was a tendency for more recruited follicles, with significantly more small follicles (12 to 14 mm) present on day 0 in all grades of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome than in controls. Stepwise logistic regression performed on 22 variables identified a high-risk group for this syndrome; the major features are illustrated by young, lean patients who, after relatively few ampules of human menopausal gonadotropin, develop high estradiol levels and multiple small follicles.\r"

One hundred nine women participated over a 26-month interval. Treatment groups did not differ significantly in terms of gestational age at membrane rupture, gestational age at delivery, birth weight, maternal or fetal infectious morbidity, respiratory distress syndrome, necrotizing enterocolitis, or perinatal mortality. Prolongation of intrauterine time after the onset of uterine contractions was seen in women receiving tocolysis (105.2 +/- 157 hours versus 62.1 +/- 77 hours, p = 0.06). This prolongation was not associated with a significant reduction in the total cost per surviving infant (tocolysis, $38,593 +/- $40,887 versus bed rest, $43,158 +/- $37,116; p = 0.445). The cost difference was artifactual. The number of very premature infants born (less than 28 weeks' gestation) was unequal in the two groups (12 in the bed rest group and 5 in the tocolysis group) and skewed the results. Before 28 weeks' gestation tocolysis was associated with a significant increase in intrauterine time after the onset of regular contractions (p = 0.05). However, there was no identifiable perinatal benefit garnered from the additional 5 days. After 28 weeks there were no significant differences between treatment groups in terms of intrauterine time after the onset of regular contractions and total cost per surviving infant. Because tocolysis does not improve perinatal outcome and can itself be associated with major maternal morbidity, it should be avoided after 28 weeks' gestation. Before 28 weeks' gestation tocolysis may greatly increase intrauterine time, but the benefit of this prolongation is not clear.\r"

Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels in normal pregnant women showed a gradual increase as pregnancy advanced, but the mean (+/- SD) concentrations in women in each trimester (34.8 +/- 14.7 pg/ml in the first trimester, n = 35; 38.7 +/- 12.2 pg/ml in the second trimester, n = 34; and 43.1 +/- 20.0 pg/ml in the third trimester, n = 71) did not differ statistically from the mean plasma atrial natriuretic peptide level in nonpregnant women (38.2 +/- 13.6 pg/ml, n = 44). In contrast, plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels were elevated in 9 of the 12 women who had hypertension. The mean plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration in these patients (162 +/- 95.2 pg/ml) was significantly (p less than 0.01) higher than in normal pregnant women and in nonpregnant controls. On the other hand, 11 pregnant women with proteinuria or edema but without hypertension had normal plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels. These results suggest that plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels are normal in women during uncomplicated pregnancy, while the levels are elevated in pregnancy complicated by hypertension. Increased atrial natriuretic peptide secretion in the latter condition may reflect a mechanism of compensation that operates in response to water and sodium retention.\r"

The histopathology of senile plaques was studied using double-labeling immunohistochemistry and lectin histochemistry with thioflavin S fluorescent microscopy in 9 cases of Alzheimer's disease, 2 nondemented elderly individuals, and 3 individuals with non-Alzheimer primary degenerative dementias. Every plaque that was visualized with thioflavin also had amyloid, but not all thioflavin-positive plaques contained neurites that could be recognized with specific monoclonal antibodies to paired helical filament, tau, or neurofilament epitopes. Some neurofilament-positive neurites were not visualized with thioflavin, but almost all tau-positive neurites were colabeled with thioflavin. Microglia were associated with most plaques. Most plaques were also surrounded by fibrous astrocytes. These results suggest that amyloid may be the common feature that defines senile plaques, but that other elements may be more specific for Alzheimer's disease, because extensive neuritic degeneration was seen only in Alzheimer brains and not in either nondemented elderly individuals with senile plaques or in non-Alzheimer dementia cases.\r"

Fifty percent of these patients were found to have cervical esophageal webs that were resected at operation. The association of Zenker's diverticulum and esophageal webs is new. The present study demonstrates that it is not a rare relationship and that these webs can cause postoperative problems. We utilized the technique of open diverticulectomy and found that it facilitates cricopharyngeal myotomy and allowed intraoperative inspection of the esophageal lumen, thereby patients with coexisting intraesophageal pathologic abnormalities could be identified. This procedure can be performed within very acceptable limits of morbidity, as demonstrated in our study, although it is not recommended for surgeons who do not regularly operate on the esophagus. Surgeons should consider this technical approach to Zenker's diverticulum when the presence of cervical webs is known or suspected preoperatively. Cervical esophageal webs are a potential source of postoperative dysphagia. They should therefore be excised when encountered intraoperatively. The actual incidence of cervical esophageal webs and their potential role in the pathogenesis of cricopharyngeal muscle hypertrophy and Zenker's diverticulum will require additional study.\r"

  ".W": "Clinical reports, as well as animal studies, have described cardiovascular and sympathetic stimulation after the administration of naloxone (NX) to reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression. This investigation examines the effect of PaCO2 on hemodynamic and adrenergic responses to NX, by means of 24 experiments carried out in six dogs. Each dog underwent NX reversal of fentanyl (FEN) at three different PaCO2 levels: 20, 35, and 60 mm Hg. In a final series of six experiments, the dogs were exposed to increasing PaCO2 after autonomic block by total spinal anesthesia and vagotomy. During enflurane anesthesia, 50 micrograms/kg FEN decreased mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and plasma concentrations of norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (EPI) significantly. NX 0.4 mg promptly returned HR and MAP to baseline or above in all experiments; catecholamine (CA) levels increased only in hypercapnic dogs. Increases in HR were the same in all series. MAP, EPI, and NE levels were significantly greater than pre-FEN baseline values only in hypercapnic dogs 1 minute after NX and were also significantly higher in hypercapnic than in hypocapnic dogs at this time. NE levels were greater in hypercapnic dogs at all time periods after NX. In blocked dogs, neither F nor NX had any effects on hemodynamic functions or plasma CA levels; the institution of hypercapnia caused significant decreases in HR, MAP, and systemic vascular resistance. This direct circulatory depressant action of an elevated PCO2 may have attenuated the indirectly mediated excitatory hemodynamic effects of NX in intact dogs, thus explaining the relatively greater effect of hypercapnia on adrenergic than on hemodynamic responses to reversal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The potential impact of COBRA is staggering and must be confronted. The ultimate scope and effects will take shape quickly. Federal regulations will provide some of the rules, but the most important definitions under the law will develop in court. Because of a lack of understanding hospitals may not have been in compliance with COBRA's strict terms since August 1986 and may only become educated on COBRA through the legal process. Currently, one COBRA lawsuit has been filed in the Chicago court system, and at least one physician group in California has paid a $25,000 fine for COBRA violations. Litigation in the initial phase of COBRA is likely as most hospitals continue to be unaware of the implications of COBRA legislation. EDs, emergency medical services programs, and interhospital transport programs must begin an immediate effort to examine and develop policies to comply with COBRA. Without an effective educational, compliance, and risk management effort, any emergency medical services program or hospital may become a defendant under COBRA legislation. Delays in understanding and implementing the requirements of COBRA may adversely affect the health care system rather than improve it.\r"

Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test, we measured the level of soluble Tac peptide, one chain of the human interleukin-2 receptor, in the serum of 50 patients with adult T-cell leukemia (38 Japanese and 12 American patients), 8 patients with other hematologic malignancies, 8 asymptomatic HTLV-I-antibody-positive carriers, and 17 normal controls. The serum level of soluble Tac peptide (geometric mean U/mL, 95% CI) was elevated at presentation in all patients with adult T-cell leukemia (16,461; 819 to 330,896) when compared with normal controls (238; 112 to 502), patients with other hematologic malignancies (1302; 475 to 3569), and healthy HTLV-I antibody-positive carriers (490; 115 to 2086). The highest levels were seen in patients (n = 33) with acute (32,154; 2587 to 399,598) compared with chronic (5464; 661 to 45,156) disease (n = 14). Serum levels of Tac peptide also tended to be more elevated in patients with adult T-cell leukemia with hypercalcemia (32,072; 2461 to 417,908) compared with normocalcemic patients (13,885; 496 to 388,436). Serial measurements of soluble Tac peptide levels in serum were done in four patients with adult T-cell leukemia during chemotherapy and the levels reflected disease activity. These observations suggest that the measurement of soluble Tac peptide levels in patients with adult T-cell leukemia is useful as a noninvasive measure of tumor burden and will help in the diagnosis of the disease and management of these patients.\r"

Electrophoretic separation of purified LPSs from the three isolates showed similar LPS banding patterns. Analysis of the Western blots of these LPSs from the three isolates with O-antigen-specific monoclonal antibody indicated that the ladder pattern consisted of doublet bands, which presumably reflected a modification of core or lipid A; the level of one of the bands in the doublet was in much lower amounts in the isolate from the tolA mutant than in that from the parent or revertant. Results of competitive displacement experiments, in which the cationic spin probe 4-dodecyldimethylammonium-1-oxyl-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine bromide was displaced from its LPS-binding site by polycations, revealed that the tolA mutant had a much higher affinity for gentamicin, polymyxin, Ca2+, and Mg2+ than did the parent or revertant. The order of affinity for all samples was polymyxin B much greater than gentamicin C much greater than Ca2+ greater than Mg2+. Both gentamicin and polymyxin induced rigidification of all of the LPS samples, but for the sample from the tolA mutant, rigidification occurred at substantially lower concentrations. Dansyl polymyxin titration experiments with intact cells demonstrated that the increased affinity of the LPS from the tolA mutant for polycations was reflected in an increase in the affinity of binding to the cell. Together these data suggest that the tolA mutant is supersusceptible to aminoglycosides by virtue of an LPS change which increases the binding affinity of the LPS for polycations, including gentamicin.\r"

A total of 39 isolates of P. aeruginosa reported to have this resistance pattern were retested by the standard National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards disk diffusion procedure; 30 strains (77%) were confirmed to be ArGrTs. These 30 isolates were further examined for susceptibility to those aminoglycosides by agar dilution and broth micro- and macrodilution methods. Only 27, 27, and 23% of the isolates appeared to be ArGrTs by agar, broth microdilution, and broth macrodilution testing, respectively. Most of the remaining isolates were resistant to all three aminoglycosides when tested by broth dilution and resistant only to gentamicin when tested by agar dilution. The percentages of strains resistant to any particular aminoglycoside by agar dilution, broth microdilution, and broth macrodilution, respectively, were 43, 80, and 70 for amikacin, 97, 93, and 100 for gentamicin, 100, 100, and 100 for netilmicin, 30, 87, and 93 for sisomicin, and 13, 57, and 50 for tobramycin. These results indicate that strains showing the unusual aminoglycoside antibiogram are less susceptible to aminoglycosides in general and should probably be considered borderline resistant to all aminoglycosides. The efficacy of aminoglycosides in the treatment of infections produced by these strains is unknown.\r"

E1040 was at least as resistant as ceftazidime and cefmenoxime to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases and showed high affinities for penicillin-binding protein 3 of both Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa.\r"

The resistant strains did not produce detectable beta-lactamase activity, otherwise modify penicillin G, or bind less total penicillin. Penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 3 of the six resistant isolates tested uniformly bound less penicillin G in comparison to the same PBP of four susceptible isolates. Reflecting the reduced binding affinity of PBP 3 of the two resistant strains tested, the amount of 3H-labeled penicillin G required for half-maximal binding was increased in comparison with that of PBP 3 of the two susceptible isolates. We conclude that the mechanism of resistance in these meningococci relatively resistant to penicillin G was decreased affinity of PBP 3.\r"

Four days after the induction of infection, animals were given either a single dose of gentamicin or two daily injections for 7 days. The treated animals were evaluated from 1 h to 6 months posttreatment. After a single injection, limited pharmacokinetic variations were observed, whereas after 14 injections infected kidneys demonstrated significantly higher concentrations and a more extended renal elimination phase of the antibiotic. Analysis of the area under the curve of the concentration in kidney versus time showed more marked renal accumulation by the infected and long-term treated animals than by normal animals or those receiving only one injection of aminoglycoside. Renal function remained normal in both the infected and normal animals treated with this aminoglycoside. These results demonstrate that S. faecalis pyelonephritis disturbs the renal handling of gentamicin and may increase the susceptibility of the kidney to aminoglycosides.\r"

In the neurohypophysis, nerve fibers and pituicytes were immunopositive. Most pituitary adenomas, including null cell adenomas, immunostained with SYP. The presence of SYP could not be correlated with hormone content, cytoplasmic granularity, and clinical symptoms. Neuron-specific enolase was expressed with SYP in most adenomas, whereas chromogranin was present only in a few tumors. Although SYP cannot be used as a general marker to identify specifically pituitary cells or adenomas, its demonstration may be helpful in immunocytochemical characterization of some null cell adenomas.\r"

The repair of hyaline membrane disease occurred by two processes; expansion of atelectatic alveoli and absorption of the hyaline membrane. Regenerative type II pneumocytes containing numerous organelles and lamellar inclusion bodies could be seen three days following birth. Disaturated phosphatidylcholine content also increased three days after birth. Absorption of the hyaline membrane occurred on part of several types of cells such as intra-alveolar macrophages and spindle-shaped cells appearing below or above the hyaline membrane. Intra-alveolar macrophages showed positive immunoreactivity with lysozyme and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin antisera. The spindle-shaped cells indicated negative immunoreactivity with these antisera, though some of them showed positive immunoreactivity with surfactant apoprotein or factor VIII-related antigen antisera. It thus appears that cells of different origin may possibly participate in the absorption of hyaline membrane.\r"

Soluble IL-2R have also been detected circulating in vivo at low levels in the serum of healthy individuals, and at abnormal levels in a variety of diseases, particularly those where immune dysfunction is thought to play an important role. We therefore evaluated serum IL-2R levels in 77 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and compared them with levels in 46 age-matched healthy controls. Nineteen additional RA patients with concurrently obtained sera and synovial fluid (SF) samples were compared with 14 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip. The serum IL-2R levels were significantly elevated in RA patients, compared with the control groups (P less than 0.0001). Serum IL-2R levels in the RA patients did not correlate with disease activity as determined by a variety of clinical and laboratory parameters. RA SF IL-2R levels were significantly higher than corresponding RA serum IL-2R levels (P = 0.0001). No such difference was noted in the osteoarthritis group, where serum and SF IL-2R levels were comparable with serum levels in healthy controls. These findings support the hypothesis that in vivo lymphocyte activation plays an important role in RA; moreover, soluble IL-2R measurement in serum and SF may be a very useful way to identify patients at risk for, or manifesting, a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory arthropathy.\r"

Crystals were seen in fluids from all 3 groups; pyrophosphate predominated in the pyrophosphate arthropathy group and alizarin red-positive particles in the idiopathic disease group. Collagenase and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase levels were estimated in SF after gel filtration. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase activity was detected in all fluids, but tended to be highest in the RA group. Collagenase activity was detected in 3 RA fluids only. In no sample was collagenase found in an active form. These findings support the clinical concept of an aggressive destructive process which sometimes occurs in the shoulder joints of elderly women. Because we were not able to detect free collagenase in SF from any of the patients with idiopathic shoulder disease, the data suggest that high levels of active collagenase are not characteristic of this group of patients.\r"

  ".W": "PEPSCAN analysis, performed using 536 overlapping nonapeptides derived from the HTLV-III B nucleotide sequence of the region encoding the external envelope protein of 120 kDa (gp120), identified in the V3 region of gp120 a major binding site for antibodies of HIV-1-infected humans. The minimal amino acid sequence of this antibody binding site was demonstrated by multiple length scanning to be five to eight amino acids in length: (G)PGRAF(VT), i.e. amino acids 312-319. A peptide (Neu 21) containing this binding site for human antibodies (KSIRIQRGPGRAFVTIG) was synthesized and shown to induce HTLV-III B cell fusion-inhibiting antibodies in rabbits and mice. Antibodies binding to this HTLV-III B/LAV-1-specific peptide were shown to be primarily of the IgG 1 subclass, appeared within 6 months after HIV-1 antibody seroconversion in six out of 14 men studied, and persisted throughout the follow-up period of 10-24 months. The other eight seroconverting men did not develop antibodies to Neu 21 during the observation period. The appearance of antibodies to Neu 21 paralleled the capacity of the serum to inhibit HTLV-III B in cell fusion. HIV-1-infected men with Kaposi's sarcoma exhibited a similar frequency of antibodies to the synthetic peptide Neu 21 (14 out of 39, 36%) as asymptomatic HIV-1-infected men (112 out of 319, 35%). Adults with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia had a significantly lower frequency (11 out of 78, 14%) of antibodies to Neu 21. Similarly, a low prevalence of antibodies to Neu 21 (8 out of 43, 19%) was observed among symptomatic HIV-1-infected children.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the possible involvement in the interaction between HIV gp110 and its CD4 receptor of epitopes different from the currently known binding site(s) of the molecule. Four monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to gp110 were used (Genetic Systems Corporation, Seattle, Washington, USA): one (110-1) recognized a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal part of gp110 (494-517); the other three (110-3, 110-4, 110-5) recognized the same peptide located at position 308-328. HIV or purified gp110 obtained from a vaccinia recombinant (Transgene S.A., Strasbourg, France) were pre-incubated with the MAb prior to addition to CD4+ cells. Specific binding of viral particles or of the soluble molecule was then determined by flow cytometer analysis, compared with that of control preparations where the MAb was added after HIV or gp 110 had been allowed to bind CD4+ cells. Significant inhibition of HIV binding was noted with the three MAbs to peptide (308-328), but not with 110-1. At the molecular level, these same MAbs decreased the affinity of interaction between CD4 and soluble gp110, although they could still label the latter molecule after it had bound to CD4+ cells. Therefore, steric hindrance may account for neutralization of HIV binding by antibodies that are actually directed to epitopes topographically distinct from the site of binding of gp110 to CD4.\r"

As already reported, all the MAbs specifically labelled follicular dendritic cells (FDC) in lymph nodes from HIV-infected patients with lymphadenopathy, and cells of microglial nodules in the brain from patients with AIDS-related encephalopathy. However, cross-reactivity with normal uninfected tissues was also observed: epithelial cells of the skin, the thymus and tonsils with CVK, and astrocytes in the brain of 49-6 and 63-FH2. Such cross-reactivities suggest that 'molecular mimicry' could exist between p18 of HIV and normal constituents of human cells. This phenomenon could be relevant for the diagnostic use of anti-p18 MAbs on pathological specimens, and it could be of importance in the pathophysiology of HIV infection.\r"

Using the monoclonal antibody (MAb) D44, the CD8+ T cells can be further subdivided into two functional subsets of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL; CD8+, D44+) and suppressor T cells (CD8+, D44-). A dual fluorescence analysis of alveolar and peripheral lymphocytes has been used in HIV-positive patients without lung infections or tumors to reveal a dramatic increase in alveolar T8 lymphocytes (83%), compared to peripheral values (52%), which was mainly composed (89%) of CD8+ D44+ CTLs. Functional studies confirmed the cytolytic activity of these phenotypically defined alveolar CTLs on autologous alveolar macrophages used as target cells, excluding a natural killer-like activity. An immuno-enzyme analysis concomitantly revealed the co-expression of the p18 HIV antigen and the CD4 molecule on the autologous alveolar macrophages. These data suggest that CTL alveolitis occurs during HIV infection and is directed against HIV-infected alveolar macrophages which are presumably the targets of the locally recruited lung CTLs.\r"

Because NF-kappa B is also expressed in resting B cells we suggested that B cells might provide an optimal intracellular environment for HIV-1 transcription. Using a transient transfection assay, we show that the HIV-1 LTR is indeed more efficiently transcribed in the B cell line Raji than in the T cell line Jurkat, and that this effect maps to the transcriptional enhancer (NF-kappa B binding site) of the LTR. Furthermore, we show that Raji cells which have been rendered CD4-positive by gene transfection are susceptible to HIV-1 infection, and that viral gene expression and replication are more efficient in these CD4-positive B cells than in CD4-positive T cells. These findings demonstrate the crucial role of the transcriptional enhancer in regulating HIV-1 expression and, since receptors for HIV-1 are expressed by some Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive B cells, they also suggest that HIV-1 replication could occur in EBV-positive B cells in vivo.\r"

Three hundred sera from West African subjects, attending an outward clinic in Bissau for examination of suspected tuberculosis, were tested by these two assays as well as by a commercially available anti-HIV-2 ELISA (ELAVIA II). Fifty of these sera were positive in all three ELISAs as well as in Western blot tests against HTLV-IV. Thirty-eight of these positive sera were also tested by an anti-HIV-2 Western blot kit (LAV-Blot II) with positive results. The ELISAs based on SBL-6669 and HTLV-IV antigens had a specificity of 99.6% (one false positive among 250 negative sera) whereas the specificity of ELAVIA II was 94.6% using the recommended cut-off value and 98.4% using a higher cut-off value. Another 58 sera from West African patients, clinically suspected of having AIDS or HIV-related disease, were tested for HIV-2/HTLV-IV antibodies by Western blot and by ELISA against SBL-6669 and HTLV-IV antigens; all of the 30 sera which were positive by Western blot were found to be positive in both ELISAs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of the 138 HIV-seropositive couples in whom both members were tested, 124 (90%) were sexual unions between two antibody-positive partners, illustrating the high efficiency of the heterosexual transmission of HIV. A comparison of these 124 couples with 150 HIV-seronegative couples showed that, in the husbands, seropositivity is significantly associated with sexual contacts with prostitutes and history of sexually transmitted disease (STD) within the past 2 years. Seropositive wives were less likely to be in their first marriage and reported more episodes of STD than seronegative ones. Seropositive couples were similar to seronegatives in their history of blood transfusion, male circumcision and overall use of contraception but not in their use of oral contraceptive pills, which was more frequent; they were more often in polygamous unions. Discriminant analysis showed that STD, sexual contacts with prostitutes and the number of previous unions are the most powerful independent variables associated with the seropositivity of the couples. Most of the risk factors for the couples were the risk factors for the husband, suggesting that in most cases the husband acquired the HIV infection and passed it to his wife.\r"

The rate of spread of HIV was estimated by fitting different survival curves to interval-censored serological data using maximum likelihood techniques. The curves were compared using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to select that which best describes the data. The best was found to be a log-logistic model, which suggested that between 1978 and 1981 the virus spread rapidly, infecting 44% of the then uninfected cohort members. More recently the rate of spread has declined, with an additional 32% of the cohort becoming infected between 1981 and 1987.\r"

The viral gene expression of HIV-2 as well as SIV can be stimulated by T cell activators, such as mitogens and phorbol esters. HIV-2 and SIV display a much broader transactivation response specificity than does HIV-1. The LTR-directed gene expression of HIV-2/SIV is not only transactivated by their own tat gene and by HIV-1 tat gene but also by factors in human T cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type I (HTLV-I) and simian virus 40 (SV40) infected cells, involving HTLV-I tat gene and SV40 T antigens, respectively. HIV-1 LTR-directed gene expression is much less transactivated by HIV-2/SIV tat genes and by factors in HTLV-I- and SV40-infected cells. Immune activation and heterologous transactivation of the LTR-directed gene expression may be relevant to the latency of virus infection and progression toward the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\r"

  ".W": "Alfentanil was administered, together with midazolam, as part of a total i.v. anaesthetic technique. The pharmacokinetics of alfentanil were determined in 10 female patients undergoing lower abdominal surgery. The dose regimen of alfentanil, based on simulation studies, consisted of a two-stage infusion following an initial bolus dose. The kinetics of alfentanil were described by a linear two-compartment open model. The total plasma clearance ranged between 93 and 431 ml min-1 (mean 249 ml min-1). The apparent volume of distribution at steady-state ranged between 0.27 and 0.64 litre kg-1 (mean 0.44 litre kg-1). The apparent volume of distribution (Vd beta) was 0.58 litre kg-1, resulting in a terminal half-life of 112 min. Alfentanil concentrations at the time of extubation and postoperative analgesic requirements were also monitored. Good correlation between respiratory depression and plasma alfentanil concentration was found. Neither lower abdominal surgery nor the simultaneous administration of midazolam seemed to affect the kinetics of alfentanil as compared with results from studies in healthy volunteers. The short half-life of alfentanil, resulting from a small volume of distribution, makes it suitable as part of a total i.v. technique. Consideration must be paid, however, to interindividual differences in the pharmacodynamic response and in plasma clearance.\r"

At the various measuring stages there were no major changes in mean arterial pressure or heart rate. Arterial oxygen tensions and saturation increased (P less than 0.01) and the arterial to end-tidal carbon dioxide difference (PaCO2-PE'CO2) was significantly reduced (P less than 0.001) after completion of the shunt procedure. There was a significant increase in mean Qp/Qsmod after chest closure (P less than 0.001), which was seen to correlate well with early clinical outcome. Two patients who did not demonstrate any increase in Qp/Qsmod over the course of the procedure had failed shunts. The limitations of use of the Qp/Qsmod are discussed. A modified Qp/Qs ratio of less than unity after surgery is strongly indicative of inadequate palliation.\r"

To study the effect of tissue storage in K-Sol at room temperature we preserved rabbit corneas in K-Sol and M-K medium for three or seven days at 25 degrees C. All of the corneal endothelial sheets were intact after three days. At seven days the change in pH of the K-Sol medium was less than that of M-K medium. Corneas preserved in M-K medium showed swelling of mitochondria and a decrease in the number of cytoplasmic organelles. Corneas preserved in K-Sol had organised cytoplasmic organelles and nuclei. Scanning electron micrographs revealed well preserved endothelial sheets. Corneas stored in the two media showed no significant difference in thickness. A pair of human corneas preserved in K-Sol at room temperature for six days maintained about 95% of the endothelial sheet in good condition. Small separations were observed between some of the endothelial cells. However, even in these areas, the cytoplasmic organelles were well preserved. It appeared that K-Sol is more stable than M-K medium at room temperature, and that both rabbit and human corneas can be preserved in good condition in K-Sol for at least six days at 25 degrees C.\r"

In all, 82 per cent were referrals from other units and 85 per cent of referrals had failure of one or more organ systems on admission. There were intra-abdominal abscesses in 41 per cent of patients and 37 per cent had an enterocutaneous fistula. The diet included polysaccharides, medium chain triglycerides and protein hydrolysates, mixed with a high-viscosity tapioca suspension. An elemental diet was used initially in 15 per cent of patients. Thirty-three patients had an interruption of the gastrointestinal tract by a temporary enterostomy. Chyme was re-infused into the distal intestine in 20 cases. 'Zero-time' was taken as the time of operation or, for referred patients treated conservatively, the date of admission. CEN was commenced at a mean of 14 days from zero-time. Total parenteral nutrition could be discontinued at a mean of 36 days and exclusive oral alimentation was resumed at a mean of 87 days. Patients with small bowel longer than 80 cm attained enteral autonomy earlier than patients with a shorter length. Mean faecal volume did not increase following institution of CEN, suggesting tolerance to the high-viscosity diet. In cases with re-infusion of enteric content, the distal circuit (length of distal small intestine 46 cm) was able to absorb 70 per cent of the volume re-infused (mean volume 2700 ml). Body weight and nutritional markers increased significantly during the course of CEN. This study suggests that enteral autonomy can be attained early in the short bowel syndrome, even under challenging conditions. Elemental formulae do not appear to offer a benefit over polymeric diets.\r"

This may be because the cytotoxic capacity of LAK cells from such patients is suboptimal. In this study we have sought to augment this activity by stimulating the lymphocytes with recombinant human interferon-gamma (r-HuIFN-gamma) in addition to interleukin 2 or by depleting the lymphocytes of adherent suppressive mononuclear cells. Both procedures augment LAK activity in gastrointestinal cancer patients but adherent cell depletion results in fewer cells being available for adoptive cellular immunotherapy. No further augmentation of LAK activity of adherent cell depleted cells could be accomplished by addition of r-HuIFN-gamma. Co-stimulation of unfractionated peripheral lymphocytes with r-HuIFN-gamma is the preferable procedure for the generation of LAK cells for adoptive cellular immunotherapy in patients suffering from gastrointestinal cancer.\r"

The histology of ovaries from 23 women treated with Zoladex has been compared with the ovaries from 34 patients who, before the clinical trial of Zoladex, underwent surgical oophorectomy as primary therapy. Both groups show similar follicular phase development. Only 13 per cent of the Zoladex group developed corpora lutea while 58 per cent showed evidence of luteinization in the primary oophorectomy group (P less than 0.01). Non-neoplastic follicular cysts were seen more often in the ovaries of the Zoladex treated patients than in the primary oophorectomy group (P less than 0.05). Zoladex appears to arrest not folliculogenesis but follicular maturation with inhibition of ovulation, the follicles subsequently undergoing atresia with follicular cyst formation.\r"

The receptor content of breast cancers from 83 premenopausal women was also determined in relation to when during the menstrual cycle excision was performed. In the normal premenopausal women oestrogen receptors were detected in the nuclei of epithelial cells in 21 out 68 (31%) assessable samples. All 21 of these samples were obtained from the 35 women who were studied during the first half of their menstrual cycle (days 28 to 14). None of the 33 samples obtained during the second half of the cycle contained oestrogen receptors. Samples were assessable in eight of the postmenopausal women, six giving a positive result for oestrogen receptor. Fifty one of the 83 carcinomas were positive for oestrogen receptor, 24 having been excised during the first half of the cycle and 27 during the second half. Production of oestrogen receptor protein is suppressed at the time of ovulation in the normal breast epithelium of premenopausal women. In contrast, breast carcinoma cells either synthesise this protein continuously throughout the cycle or fail to express it despite fluctuations of serum hormone concentrations.\r"

Group 1 comprised 10 patients with normal urinary albumin excretion (less than 30 mg/24 h), group 2 comprised 10 with incipient diabetic nephropathy (urinary albumin excretion 30-300 mg/24 h, and group 3 comprised 10 with clinical diabetic nephropathy (urinary albumin excretion greater than 300 mg/24 h). Ten non-diabetic subjects matched for sex, age, and physical activity served as controls. Oxygen uptake was similar in the four groups at rest and during a 75 W workload. Maximal oxygen uptake was also similar in the control subjects and group 1 (median 41.7, (range 29.1-53.0) ml/kg/min v 38.5 (26.6-59.2) ml/kg/min, respectively), but was significantly lower in group 2 (27.7 (13.9-44.3) ml/kg/min) and group 3 (22.6-36.7) ml/kg/min). The difference in maximal oxygen uptake between groups 1 and 2 was 10.8 ml/kg/min (95% confidence interval 3.6 to 23.4 ml/kg/min) and between groups 1 and 3, 11.7 ml/kg/min (4.9 to 22.5 ml/kg/min). These differences were not explained by differences in metabolic control or the degree of autonomic neuropathy. Thus the insulin dependent diabetics with only slightly increased urinary albumin excretion had an appreciably impaired aerobic work capacity which could not be explained by autonomic neuropathy or the duration of diabetes. Whether the reduced capacity is due to widespread microangiopathy or another pathological process affecting the myocardium remains to be established.\r"

During 1982-4, 488 infants with primary congenital hypothyroidism were detected by the 25 regional screening laboratories in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. In addition, one infant had signs of cretinism at birth and was investigated before the screening test was done and four infants were known to have been missed by the screening programme; among these four infants the initial thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations were normal in two with inherited defects of synthesis of thyroxine, not measured in one, and false negative in one. The overall incidence of primary hypothyroidism was 1:3937 births (boys 1:6640, girls 1:2756). The incidence seemed to be reduced in infants born to black mothers (two cases only) and increased in those born to Asian mothers (61 cases). Congenital anomalies other than those of the thyroid glands were reported in 36 children (7%), and 15 (3%) died from various causes before the age of 4. Infants who were considered to show unequivocal evidence of hypothyroidism started treatment at a median age of 17 days (5th and 95th centiles 10 and 42 days) compared with a median age of 14 days (5th and 95th centiles 9 and 21 days) for infants with classic phenylketonuria also detected by national screening.\r"

Many of the aids that the elderly had were faulty, including half of the walking aids and 15% of hearing aids, reading spectacles, and dentures, and up to half of the aids were not used. Yet despite this underuse there were many disabled elderly people who required aids for the bath and toilet. When screening of elderly people is carried out in general practice assessment of aids and adaptations should be included to see that they are provided where needed, are used, and are adequately maintained.\r"

The study was population based with nearly 3000 cases covering about 30 million child years at risk. When survival during the three decades 1954-63, 1964-73, and 1974-83 was compared striking improvements were observed. For all childhood cancer five year survival increased from 21% in the first decade to 49% in the third decade. During the first and third decades five year survival rates for acute lymphocytic leukaemia increased from 2% to 47%, Hodgkin's disease from 44% to 91%, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma from 18% to 45%, Wilms's tumour from 31% to 85%, and germ cell tumours from 10% to 64%. Twenty patients developed second primary tumours, but otherwise there were few late deaths. Less than 1% of children who survived without a relapse for 10 years subsequently died of their initial cancer. Survival from childhood cancer is no longer rare, and people who have been cured of cancer during childhood should be accepted as normal members of society.\r"

Altogether 371 patients with kala-azar were randomised to receive sodium stibogluconate intramuscularly at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight/day for 20 or 40 days (groups A and A1, respectively), 15 mg/kg body weight/day for 20 or 40 days (groups B and B1, respectively), or 20 mg/kg body weight/day for 20 or 40 days (groups C and C1, respectively). Patients were examined blind before and at the end of treatment and every month for six months. The number of patients who were apparently cured--that is, those whose temperature had returned to normal at the end of their regimen of treatment--was 45 (78%) in group A, 53 (87%) in group A1, 50 (81%) in group B, 60 (95%) in group B1, 58 (92%) in group C, and 62 (97%) in group C1. At six months 62 patients (97%) in group C1, 51 (81%) in group C, 54 (86%) in group B1, 42 (68%) in group B, 45 (74%) in group A1, and 33 (57%) in group A had not relapsed and were cured as confirmed by a bone marrow aspirate free of parasites. The differences between groups C1 and C, B1 and B, and A1 and A were significant. Logistic regression of the proportion cured with the dose and length of treatment showed that both factors were significant in improving the rate of cure; the highest dose for the longer time (group C1) had the best rate of cure. One patient in group C1, 12 in group C, nine in group B1, 18 in group B, 15 in group A1, and 23 in group A were cured with extended courses of 20 mg sodium stibogluconate. One patient in each of groups C1, B, A1, and A became unresponsive to antimony and were cured with pentamidine. One patient in each of groups C1, B, and A became unresponsive to both antimony and pentamidine. The patients tolerated the longer duration of treatment safely, and side effects were minor. Sodium stibogluconate should be given intramuscularly in the dosage of 20 mg/kg for at least 40 days, when patients should be assessed for further treatment if necessary. Such a regimen should achieve the highest rate of cure with low toxicity and low rates of relapse and unresponsiveness.\r"

Thirty four patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension and seemingly normal renal function and 22 healthy controls were given infusions of amino acids to investigate whether renal functional reserve is reduced in essential hypertension and to detect patients at risk of renal damage. Although basal creatinine clearance increased after the infusion of amino acids in the controls (mean 27.9 ml/min; 95% confidence interval 18.2 to 37.6), the overall change was lower in the patients (mean 13.4 ml/min; 8.3 to 18.5), 11 of the 34 showing no increase at all. In these 11 non-responders the mean systolic blood pressure was higher than that in the 23 others (178.5 mmHg v 157 mmHg, respectively). Mean urinary albumin excretion was abnormal in the patients (93.3 mg/24 h; 44.2 to 142.4); eight of the 11 non-responders had an albumin excretion above the normal range (greater than 20 mg/24 h). In the 11 patients without renal functional reserve a positive correlation was found between basal creatinine clearance and albumin excretion (r = 0.695). As consumed renal reserve and albuminuria are markers of glomerular hyperfiltration studying renal function before and after infusion of amino acids can detect hypertensive patients at risk of progressive renal damage.\r"

Little work has been done, however, to find out how general practitioners respond to such measures. The response of general practitioners to professional and economic incentives was examined in relation to the location of the practice and the characteristics of the practitioners in seven different areas of England. The areas represented urban, rural, affluent, and deprived communities. The overall response rate was 74%, but the response varied among the areas, being poorest (64%) in an inner city area. Practices were subdivided as innovative, traditional, or intermediate, according to whether they employed a nurse and participated in the cost rent scheme and the vocational training scheme. Innovative practices were defined as fulfilling two of these criteria and traditional practices as fulfilling none; the remainder were classed as intermediate. The results showed that these three types of practice had distinct strategies that were related to financial constraints and the local population. Innovative practices had more partners and were often located in rural or affluent suburban areas; traditional practices had fewer partners and were more common in urban and working class areas. Innovative practices seemed to be in the best position to increase their services, and hence their incomes, in response to the recent proposals in the white paper. Practices in areas of developmental difficulty (predominantly urban but not necessarily inner city areas) had been less able to respond to existing incentives and had a smaller margin available for developing their services. In view of the effect of local constraints of economics and population on the strategy of practices, concentrating resources for primary care in local budgets for working class and urban areas may be preferable to extending the system of charging fees for services provided by family doctors.\r"

  ".W": "Maurice Ravel had been subject to psychiatric disorder for many years when signs of organic brain disease appeared at the age of 52. Aphasia, apraxia, agraphia, and alexia became established some five years later. Musical creativity was lost. Alajouanine diagnosed cerebral atrophy with bilateral ventricular enlargement. Though Ravel's condition deteriorated progressively, generalised dementia was not apparent. He died in December 1937, after a craniotomy performed by Clovis Vincent, possibly from a subdural haematoma. Vincent's operative findings are described here. The likely cause of Ravel's illness was a restricted form of cerebral degeneration.\r"

  ".W": "Several oncogenes seem to encode certain growth factors that may play a part in regulating cell growth in tumours. To assess whether such factors are synthesised endogenously by tumour cells the amounts of messenger RNA for several growth factors known to be synthesised by cancer cells of the breast in vitro were examined in biopsy specimens from 52 malignant and 15 non-malignant tumours of the breast and four samples of normal breast. Transforming growth factor beta messenger RNA was significantly more abundant in breast cancers (32 of 42 (76%) having appreciable amounts) than non-malignant breast tissue (five of 13 (38%) having similar amounts). Transcripts for both transforming growth factor alpha and its receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor, were found more commonly in carcinomas that were negative for oestrogen receptor (64% and 87%, respectively) than in those that were positive (27% and 30%, respectively). Insulin-like growth factor II messenger RNA was present in all 15 samples of non-malignant tissue but was found (in considerably lower amounts) in only 11 of 21 (52%) carcinomas. Epidermal growth factor receptor was also found in all non-malignant breast tissues, compared with 19 of 45 (42%) carcinomas. Platelet derived growth factor A and B chain transcripts coexisted in all normal and benign tissue and most carcinomas. This differing pattern of expression growth factors in tissue from malignant tumours compared with benign tumours and normal breast tissue suggests that some growth factors, particularly transforming growth factors alpha and beta, may have an important role in controlling growth of human breast cancers, particularly those that are hormone independent.\r"

The clinical features were compatible with reactive arthritis but were atypical in several respects: the joint symptoms were generally severe, persistent, and unresponsive to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The onset of arthritis was associated with various infections, none of which are known to be associated with the development of reactive arthritis. HLA typing was performed for three patients, all of whom were positive for HLA-B27. HIV was isolated from the synovial fluid of one patient. No patient had AIDS before developing arthritis, but four progressed to having AIDS after a mean of 7.5 months, and two died. Arthritis resolved in only one patient. The possibility of HIV infection should be considered in all patients with conditions suggesting reactive arthritis. Synovitis in patients with severe immunodeficiency has important pathogenetic implications.\r"

Complement C4 and Bf allotypes were determined in 26 patients who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for persistent generalised lymphadenopathy due to HIV, 72 homosexuals who were negative for antibody to HIV, and 185 control subjects drawn from the local population. HLA-A, B, and DR were also typed and the phenotypes examined for the presence of supratypes and C4BQ0. Eleven patients (42%) had C4B null alleles compared with only 13 (18%) homosexuals who were negative for antibody and 28 (15%) controls. From estimates of gene frequencies the difference between the patients with lymphadenopathy and the controls was significant after conservative correction. In the patients only a minority (six) of the C4B null alleles were contained within ancestral haplotypes. Together with the fact that C4 null alleles result in partial deficiency of C4, this finding suggests that products of complement genes are important in infection with HIV or its consequences, or both. A role is proposed for complement and Fc receptors.\r"

Twelve of 110 patients with normal or slightly increased amounts of parenchymal fibronectin in the initial biopsy specimen developed cirrhosis, whereas eight out of 27 patients with moderately increased amounts and three out of five with significantly increased amounts later developed the disease (p less than 0.005). Semiquantitative assessment of the amount of parenchymal fibronectin at an early stage of alcoholic liver disease is of definite predictive value for the development of cirrhosis.\r"

Emergency endoscopy in 961 patients admitted for upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage identified 68 patients with actively bleeding ulcers. These 68 patients were randomised to receive either endoscopic injection of adrenaline or no endoscopic treatment. After endoscopy both groups were managed in an identical manner, and strict criteria for emergency operation were adhered to in both groups. Bleeding was initially controlled in all 34 patients assigned to the treatment group. Significantly fewer patients in the treatment group than in the control group needed emergency operations (five v 14, respectively). In addition, in the treatment group the median transfusion requirement was significantly less (three v five units of blood) and the median hospital stay shorter (six v eight days). No complications were observed with the injection of adrenaline, and the rate of healing of ulcers in those attending for endoscopy six weeks after discharge was similar in both groups (81% (17 out of 21 patients) in the treatment group v 79% (11 out of 14) in the control group). Injection of adrenaline is effective in stopping bleeding from actively bleeding ulcers.\r"

Altogether 157 out of 194 admissions (81%) were studied. The patients (16 of whom had been admitted twice and one three times) were interviewed at home about two weeks after discharge, and their hospital records were reviewed. When interviewed an appreciable proportion of patients said that their asthma had been poorly controlled after their discharge from the hospital: 54 reported regular sleep disturbance due to wheeze, 78 tightness of the chest in the morning, and 77 wheeze after climbing one flight of stairs. Patients had been described on admission as having had symptoms of deteriorating asthma for a median of three days. Closer questioning of 71 patients, however, elicited that 50 had had regular symptoms indicating poor control for weeks or months. Most patients did not know how their drugs worked, and many did not have an appropriate plan of action in the event of a further attack. In all the cases studied 114 patients were treated with oral corticosteroids, only 70 had had their previous maintenance treatment increased at the time of discharge, and 107 had a follow up appointment booked for an average of three and a half weeks after discharge. These findings show that undersupervision and undertreatment of patients with asthma are common and not confined to those dying of the condition.\r"

Of those, 198 (66%) would not give topical treatment when the tympanic membrane was perforated. Only 41 (14%) would give topical treatment in cases of discharging grommets. Although there is a theoretical risk of ototoxicity to aminoglycosides in topical preparations, this is the most effective medical treatment and is the standard teaching advocated in specialist textbooks and practised by otolaryngologists. The results of the survey suggest that there is undue concern about possible ototoxicity and a degree of confusion in the management of this common clinical condition.\r"

Most of these changes occurred at a relatively early stage. There was a shift of choices towards general practice, and to a lesser extent other specialties, predominantly from medicine, surgery, and paediatrics. Great importance was attached to self evaluation of aptitude and ability as a factor in determining the choice of career and also to awareness of promotion prospects and difficulties. The absence of or failure of careers advice to influence choice of career was notable as was the little importance attached to financial circumstances. Domestic circumstances were an important determinant, particularly for general practice and for women doctors. Among those who qualified in 1980 and 1983, at the preregistration stage, domestic circumstances were less important than they were for slightly older doctors, but undergraduate experience had a greater influence. Contact with a particular teacher or department was not, however, a notable element in this.\r"

(c) Each health centre should have defined target groups for immunisation and child health clinic enrollment. (d) An accurate and meaningful reporting system is essential. (e) Each health centre should receive regular feedback on its achievements. Immunisation coverage in the province, as judged by the proportion of children under 1 year of age receiving their second dose of triple antigen, improved from 57-67% in 1980-2 to 89-94% in 1983-4. Immunisation is the most cost effective preventive activity undertaken in child health care. The application of these guiding principles would be relevant in the United Kingdom.\r"

  ".W": "In summary, evidence from human populations has shown that smokeless tobacco users have risks of cancer several times higher than that of nonsmokers. Smokeless tobacco is very strongly related to cancers of the cheek and gums, locations typically in direct contact with the tobacco. The association is evident in studies in the US and Scandinavia and also in Asia, where the chewing of quids containing tobacco and other ingredients is strongly related to the region's high rates of oral cancer. Reports on health effects date back to the 18th century and the evidence is consistent, with most investigators reporting positive findings. Dose-response relationships--increasing risk with increasing use--are also evident in several studies. Finally, preliminary work on cancers in other anatomic sites suggests that smokeless tobacco may also be related to other upper digestive tract cancers. With the exception of one group of medical scientists who described the relationship as only an \"association,\" expert consensus conferences and committees in both the US and France have agreed that the evidence from clinical, epidemiologic, and carcinogenesis studies supports a causal relationship between the use of smokeless tobacco and oral cancer in humans. These expert groups include the International Agency for Research on Cancer (1984), the National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference on the Health Implications of Smokeless Tobacco Use (1986), and the Surgeon General's Advisory Committee on the Health Consequences of Using Smokeless Tobacco (1986).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Data from the few studies performed to date suggest that smokeless tobacco users develop a dependency similar to that for cigarette smokers. Effective treatment strategies to help smokeless tobacco users quit need to be developed. Smokeless tobacco use in young people also poses a concern for later development of dependence on cigarettes. The health hazards known to be caused by cigarette smoking and suspected to be related to chronic nicotine exposure are expected to be a hazard of habitual use of smokeless tobacco. A major concern in young males is accelerated coronary artery disease. Information about the potential health hazards of nicotine, as well as oral pathology, may be incorporated into educational programs to help discourage the use of smokeless tobacco, with a resultant decrease in the associated cancer risk.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the hemodynamic responses to three doses of atrial natriuretic factor [human atrial natriuretic factor-(99-126)] (ANF) in nephrectomized rabbits anesthetized with ketamine and acepromazine. The influence of the different doses of the peptide on the hemodynamic consequences produced by acute volume expansion (0.9% NaCl, 1.4 ml/kg/min for 60 minutes) was also studied. All three dosages of ANF (0.001, 0.01, and 0.2 micrograms/kg/min for 20 minutes) significantly reduced blood pressure. With the lowest dose, the hypotensive effect was associated with reduction in systemic vascular resistance and no significant change in heart rate, stroke volume, central venous pressure, and hematocrit. In contrast, the intermediate and high doses, which resulted in markedly higher plasma levels, caused a significant decrease in heart rate, central venous pressure, and stroke volume; a slight rise in hematocrit; and no change in systemic vascular resistance. Volume expansion produced by saline infusion in an additional group of nephrectomized rabbits increased central venous pressure and decreased hematocrit. When ANF infusion was associated to volume expansion, each dosage of ANF was able to reduce the rise in central venous pressure, while only the higher dosage attenuated the progressive fall in hematocrit caused by volume expansion. Plasma volume, measured at the end of volume expansion was lower in the group treated with the highest dose of ANF than in the control animals (28.2 +/- 9 vs. 35.1 +/- 3 ml/kg, p less than 0.05). We conclude that 1) ANF induces significant hemodynamic effects independently from its renal action.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The cremaster skeletal muscle of anesthetized rats was denervated and extended with intact circulation into a tissue bath. Intravital microscopy was used to measure microvessel diameter at three different anatomical levels within the microcirculation: large distributing arterioles (x control diameter = 100 +/- 7 micron), large capacitance venules (147 +/- 8 micron), and small terminal arterioles (17 +/- 1 micron). Norepinephrine (NE) was added to the cremaster bath to produce intermediate reductions in diameter of large arterioles and venules (55% and 38% of maximum constriction, respectively). In the presence of NE tone, bath-added atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) produced concentration-dependent dilation of both arterioles and venules. Arteriolar IC25 = 18 pmol and IC50 = 1.2 X 10(-10) M; venules exhibited similar sensitivity. However, the highest ANF concentration examined (10(-7) M) only reversed NE-induced tone by 70%. In a second large vessel group ANF completely reversed constriction induced by the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist, phenylephrine, in the presence of 5 X 10(-7) M yohimbine. However, vessels constricted with the alpha 2-receptor agonist UK-14,304 (in the presence of 10(-8) M prazosin) were insensitive to ANF. A third group of terminal arterioles, which possess considerable spontaneous \"intrinsic\" tone, were studied in the absence of alpha-receptor agonists. Significant dilation occurred at greater than 10(-7) M, and the maximal response was only 25% of complete dilation with adenosine. These data indicate that ANF exhibits a high potency and selectivity for reversal of alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated constriction of large arterioles and venules. Constriction produced by alpha 2-adrenoceptor occupation or by nonadrenergic \"intrinsic\" mechanisms appears to be insensitive to ANF. We propose that the ability of ANF to reduce microvascular resistance depends on the relative contribution of alpha 1-, alpha 2-, and intrinsic vasoconstrictor components to the prevailing level of smooth muscle tone. Differences in these components among regional circulations and between arterial and venous smooth muscle may contribute to the systemic hemodynamic pattern produced by ANF.\r"

  ".W": "To study the relation between plasma atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and cardiac pressures, we measured plasma ANF in 24 patients with mitral stenosis 30 minutes before and 20 minutes after balloon mitral valvulotomy. All patients were without physical signs of congestive heart failure. Normal sinus rhythm was present in 15 (group 1), whereas the other nine (group 2) had permanent atrial fibrillation. There were no significant differences between groups for basal mean pressures in right atrium (RA), left atrium (LA), and pulmonary artery (PA). Valvulotomy resulted in a fall in both groups (p less than 0.001) in LA and PA mean pressures, whereas heart rate, cardiac index, and RA and aorta (AO) pressures did not change significantly. Basal ANF was not different in either group in RA (240 +/- 43 vs. 266 +/- 35 pg/ml) or AO (441 +/- 92 vs. 643 +/- 70 pg/ml) but tended to be higher in group 2 in LA (428 +/- 88 vs. 682 +/- 84 pg/ml; p = 0.059) and PA (488 +/- 93 vs. 759 +/- 92 pg/ml; p = 0.057). Plasma ANF was the highest in PA, and about 50% ANF was extracted in the systemic circulation. After valvulotomy, plasma ANF was greater (p less than 0.05) in group 2 (372 +/- 90, 755 +/- 152, 805 +/- 134, and 707 +/- 144 pg/ml) than in group 1 (206 +/- 36, 386 +/- 47, 429 +/- 66, and 421 +/- 49 pg/ml), regardless of the site of blood collection (RA, LA, PA, and AO, respectively). PA ANF was correlated with LA pressure (p less than 0.05) in group 1 before as well as after valvulotomy, whereas there was no such correlation in group 2. Cyclic GMP (cGMP) in LA was correlated (p less than 0.01) with PA ANF in group 1, and LA cGMP (10.0 +/- 1.2 and 9.1 +/- 1.8 pmol/ml in groups 1 and 2, respectively) was higher (p less than 0.05) than PA cGMP (9.1 +/- 1.0 and 8.0 +/- 1.5 pmol/ml in groups 1 and 2, respectively) before valvulotomy, which suggests the presence of ANF receptors in the pulmonary circulation. Taken together, these results indicate that in patients in sinus rhythm with mitral stenosis, there is an increase in ANF secretion depending on LA pressure. ANF secretion is also high in patients with mitral stenosis and atrial fibrillation but does not respond appropriately to changes in LA pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Using the coronary artery ligation model of heart failure in the rat, we have measured changes in vasoactive hormone secretion and related these changes to salt and water status during a 1-month period. When compared with controls, rats with infarction had a marked rise in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (294 +/- 59 vs. 79 +/- 10 pg/ml, p less than 0.001) although there was no increase in total exchangeable body sodium. Plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentrations were the same for both rats with infarction and controls. Similarly, there were no significant differences in plasma arginine vasopressin, plasma osmolality, or plasma sodium concentration in rats with infarction. Ventricular norepinephrine levels were reduced in animals with infarction (p less than 0.01). Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels were raised in this model of chronic left ventricular failure. However, there was no salt retention and little stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system or vasopressin. The results suggest that high circulating atrial natriuretic peptide levels may prevent or limit salt and water retention, either directly or indirectly, by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.\r"

Effective vascular stiffness (a reciprocal of effective vascular compliance) as a variable of integrated venous tone was 0.30 +/- 0.01 mm Hg.kg/ml (n = 35) and was augmented up to twofold by diclofenac (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg i.v.), ibuprofen (6 and 60 mg/kg), or indomethacin (5 mg/kg) parallel to augmentations in central venous pressure, while the rise in arterial pressure was less than half of the increase induced by equivenoconstrictor dosages of norepinephrine. After preconstriction by indomethacin or diclofenac, nitroglycerin (1.5 micrograms/kg/min) lowered effective vascular stiffness (by 24 +/- 2% or 23 +/- 5%, respectively), similarly as during preconstriction by norepinephrine (by 24 +/- 4%). Long-term cyclooxygenase inhibition (diclofenac 2 x 1 mg/kg/day for 4 days) did not modify arterial pressure, heart rate, or hematocrit levels in conscious dogs at rest, but it lowered plasma volume to 52.5 +/- 1.9 ml/kg (sham treatment: 59.1 +/- 1.6 ml/kg, p less than 0.05, n = 4). In conclusion, venoconstriction by clinical dosages of cyclooxygenase inhibitors does not interfere with the venodilator action of nitroglycerin and is compensated chronically by adjustments of plasma volume.\r"

In five cases of nephrosis, the mean value of DLIS in diuresis was significantly higher than during other stages (p less than 0.05). It was also higher than the levels recorded for six patients with nephritis (p less than 0.05). The presence of DLIS in the urine followed a similar pattern. The positive correlation between urine DLIS and ouabain-like substance (OLS) corrected by creatinine was observed for one month after the onset of nephrosis. The present study indicates the presence of DLIS in the serum and urine from patients with nephrosis which have the binding activity to the ouabain receptor. DLIS may be involved in natriuresis and may regulate active sodium transport in nephrotic children.\r"

The two youngest patients (11 days and 2.4 months) diverged clearly from the others. Their mean plasma clearance of morphine was 5.2 ml/min/kg and volume of the central compartment was 0.36 L/kg. In the other patients the clearance ranged from 25.8 to 75.6 ml/min/kg and volume of central compartment from 0.67 to 2.07 L/kg, respectively. The mean analgetic concentration of morphine was 26.2 micrograms/L in the youngest group and 3.8 micrograms/L in the other patients. The effect of morphine on respiration was similar in all groups and did not differ from that of adults. The respiratory depressant effect of morphine in the two youngest patients was not analyzed.\r"

To assess the ability of the atria to maintain elevated plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), the temporal changes in plasma ANP concentrations were studied in seven chloralose-anaesthetized dogs during 4 h of sustained rapid cardiac pacing. 2. Heart rate increased from 124 +/- 26 (mean +/- SEM) to 278 +/- 28 beats/min for the 4 h duration of rapid cardiac pacing. Mean pulmonary wedge pressure increased from 3.6 +/- 1.8 to 17.4 +/- 7.1 mmHg at 30 min (P less than 0.01) and mean right atrial pressure rose from -1.7 +/- 1.9 to 2.0 +/- 2.8 mmHg at 30 min (P less than 0.01). Both remained constant at these elevated pressures for the entire 240 min of rapid pacing. 3. Arterial ANP concentrations increased in all dogs from 87 +/- 11 to a maximum of 1263 +/- 592 pmol/l at 30 min (P less than 0.01), falling to 411 +/- 42 pmol/l after 60 min and to 146 +/- 70 pmol/l after 240 min of rapid continuous pacing (P less than 0.01 compared with 30 min). Coronary sinus ANP concentrations showed a similar pattern, rising from 241 +/- 79 to a maximum of 1837 +/- 203 pmol/l after 30 min (P less than 0.01). These peak values likewise were not sustained, falling to 962 +/- 198 pmol/l after 60 min and 297 +/- 41 pmol/l after 240 min of rapid pacing (P less than 0.01 compared with 30 min). 4. It is concluded that atria are unable to maintain the peak concentrations of ANP reached after 30 min of rapid pacing despite persistently elevated atrial pressures.\r"

The relationships between the haemodynamic, renal and endocrine changes induced by rapid ventricular pacing were studied in ten chloralose-anaesthetized dogs paced from the right ventricular apex for 60 min at 250 beats/min. 2. Pacing increased mean right atrial and mean pulmonary wedge pressure (P less than 0.05), and decreased cardiac output and mean arterial pressure (P less than 0.05). 3. Coronary sinus atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentrations were approximately fourfold greater than arterial concentrations; both increased markedly during pacing (P less than 0.01). Plasma concentrations of arginine vasopressin and plasma renin activity did not change significantly. 4. Urine flow and free water clearance increased during the latter 30 min of pacing (P less than 0.05). There was no significant change in sodium clearance despite high sustained concentrations of ANP. 5. Without the availability of specific inhibitors of ANP release or action, we are unable to exclude the possibility that ANP may have prevented sodium clearance from otherwise decreasing during rapid ventricular pacing. Nevertheless, the dissociation between elevated ANP concentrations and natriuresis in this study indicates that a rise in ANP concentrations per se is not sufficient to produce a natriuresis.\r"

Cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography and other non-invasive methods, and the potential of peripheral venous concentrations of immunoreactive atrial natriuretic peptide (IrANP), noradrenaline and adrenaline in revealing cardiac dysfunction was investigated. 3. Concentrations of venous IrANP and noradrenaline were both significantly, but weakly, related to the degree of dyspnoea and to pulmonary congestion. 4. IrANP, but not catecholamines, was also related to other indices of heart failure. The correlations were, however, due solely to increased immunoreactivity in men with severe dyspnoea; in most subjects with mild to moderate dyspnoea the level of IrANP was similar to that of the controls. 5. It is concluded that, in a population sample, the peripheral venous level of IrANP is more closely related to cardiac function than are catecholamines. Yet, the level of IrANP is not a very sensitive marker of cardiac dysfunction, suggesting that stimulation of alpha-human atrial natriuretic peptide release is a late phenomenon in the development of cardiac failure.\r"

To investigate whether the impaired renal PG synthesis in these patients is related to a PG precursor fatty acid deficiency, serum levels of linoleic and arachidonic acids and the urinary excretion of PGE2, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and thromboxane B2 (TxB2) were measured in 10 normal subjects, 17 non-azotaemic cirrhotic patients with ascites and 10 cirrhotic patients with ascites and FRF. 2. Serum linoleic acid levels were similar in the three groups studied. Both groups of cirrhotic patients showed lower arachidonic acid levels than normal subjects; however, non-azotaemic cirrhotic patients and patients with FRF did not differ in relation to serum arachidonic acid. 3. Non-azotaemic cirrhotic patients had higher urinary PGE2, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and TxB2 excretion than normal subjects and cirrhotic patients with FRF. Patients with FRF showed similar urinary PGE2 and TxB2 and lower urinary 6-keto-PGF1 alpha than normal subjects. In all cirrhotic patients no significant correlation was found between serum linoleic and arachidonic acid levels and urinary PGs. 4. In seven patients with FRF an acute intravenous infusion of linoleic acid induced a marked increase in serum levels of this fatty acid. However, no increase in serum arachidonic acid levels and urinary PG excretion and no improvement in renal function was observed. 5. This study suggests that an arachidonic acid deficiency is present in cirrhotic patients with ascites but that this abnormality is not a major determinant of renal function and PG production in these patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To examine the effect of charge and molecular size on the renal handling of immunoglobulin light chain, three different human light chains were purified, iodinated and characterized with regard to molecular weight and isoelectric point. The molecular weights were similar, whereas the isoelectric points ranged from markedly cationic to markedly anionic. 2. Renal handling of the light chains was determined in vivo in the Munich-Wistar rat and in vitro in the isolated perfused rat kidney. 3. Significant restriction to the transglomerular passage of all three light chains was evident in the intact kidney, with the most anionic light chain being restricted most while the cationic light chain was restricted least. The charge dependence of filtration of these naturally occurring proteins was, however, much less pronounced than has previously been reported for the synthetic dextrans. 4. Tubular reabsorption of the three light chains was quite variable in the intact kidney and did not appear to be related to molecular charge. In the isolated perfused kidney, once account had been taken of the abnormally high rate of filtration of these proteins, the reabsorption of the three light chains was strikingly similar to that seen in vivo. 5. With these three purified human light chains no marked influence of charge (pI) has been demonstrated in vivo or in vitro, for glomerular restriction or renal tubular reabsorption. Some other properties of human myeloma light chains may determine their renal handling and nephrotoxicity.\r"

The fractional clearance of lithium (FCLi) has been validated in the rat under controlled experimental conditions as a reliable indicator of sodium and water handling in the proximal tubule. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate some key methodological aspects related to the use of the FCLi in clinical and epidemiological investigation. 2. FCLi was determined in healthy normotensive, or in some cases, in borderline/mild essential hypertensive subjects, by a morning urine collection obtained between 09.00 and 13.00 hours after a 300 mg oral lithium carbonate load (= 8.1 mmol of elemental lithium). 3. The ratio of intra-individual to inter-individual variance of FCLi, measured in free-living subjects on unrestricted diet, was shown to be low enough (0.33) to allow adequate characterization of individuals in a population with a single measurement, or at most with two (compared with at least four measurements needed to characterize the fractional excretion of sodium). 4. The remarkable influence of dietary sodium intake on FCLi, demonstrated under metabolic ward conditions, might explain a major portion of the observed intra-individual variability. 5. At the dosage employed in the present study, oral lithium administration did not affect the renal handling of sodium, potassium or calcium. Likewise, it did not induce any change in a series of 17 metabolic parameters and indicators of renal and liver function. 6. It is concluded that the FCLi may be a safe and useful tool for the clinical and epidemiological investigation of renal sodium and water handling. The possibility of a confounding effect of dietary sodium intake, however, should be kept in mind.\r"

Rats with infarction receiving a normal salt intake did not retain sodium when compared with sham-operated controls. Rats receiving a low salt diet had a 10% decrease in body sodium (P less than 0.01). The decrease was the same in rats with infarction as in controls. 3. Plasma ANP was similar in control rats irrespective of salt status. Plasma ANP levels were markedly elevated in rats with infarction irrespective of salt status (P less than 0.01). 4. The rise in plasma ANP was correlated with cardiac hypertrophy and infarct size in animals fed both normal and low salt diets. However, there was no relationship between plasma ANP and exchangeable body sodium. 5. These results suggest that in this model of heart failure plasma ANP is raised by increased left atrial stretch in proportion to the severity of left ventricular dysfunction. In contrast, plasma ANP concentrations do not appear to be elevated as a consequence of increased right atrial pressure caused by sodium retention and expanded extracellular volume.\r"

Hemodynamically similar levels of PHN were generated in 18 newborn piglets (six through group B beta-hemolytic Streptococci infusion; six through hypoxia; six through hypercarbia) and O2 transport was studied. At 60 min VO2 was similar in all groups, although DO2 was different (10.7 +/- 6.7, 7.2 +/- 1.6, and 21.7 +/- 8.9 ml/kg.min, in the septic, hypoxic, and hypercarbic groups, respectively). Extraction efficiency varied in an inverse fashion (43 +/- 12%, 72 +/- 12%, and 27 +/- 16%, in the septic, hypoxic, and hypercarbic groups, respectively). Supply dependency and a critical DO2 were observed in the septic and hypoxic PHN groups (18.4 and 12.2 ml/kg.min, respectively). Both of these were elevated as compared to healthy adult levels. Hypercarbic pulmonary hypertension was supply independent at the levels studied; however, DO2 remained elevated in these animals and may never have reached the critical DO2 level.\r"

The animals were bled to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 50 mm Hg and maintained for one hour. Then, vasopressors were administered to maintain the MAP above 100 mm Hg. After the infusion of dopamine, the renal tissue oxygen tension (PrO2) was elevated for 20 min and tissue CO2 tension (PrCO2) decreased for 70 min. Neither PrO2 nor PrCO2 returned to the control levels. When epinephrine was infused, there was an initial slight transient rise in PrO2, which decreased gradually while PrCO2 decreased for 30 min and then gradually rose. When norepinephrine was infused, there was also an initial slight transient elevation in PrO2 which then decreased, while PrCO2 decreased transiently and then rose rapidly. These results suggest that although dopamine was the most useful vasopressor for improving renal tissue gas exchange during hemorrhagic shock, it did not restore completely oxygen delivery.\r"

Fifty-five patients with chronic lung disease and resting hypoxemia were studied. More than 80 percent of patients with a resting PaO2 of 7.33 kPa (55 mm Hg) or less had a cutaneous oximetry SaO2 greater than 85 percent. These patients would not have met the guidelines for long-term oxygen therapy if the cutaneous oximetry measurements were used instead of direct PaO2 measurements. Substituting a threshold criterion of 88 percent instead of 85 percent resulted in fewer patients being denied oxygen therapy but also included patients with PaO2 values greater than 7.33 kPa (55 mm Hg). We conclude that cutaneous oximetry cannot be substituted equivalently for PaO2 measurements in prescribing long-term oxygen therapy.\r"

Of 58 patients whose chief complaints were unrelated to pulmonary tuberculosis, the CXR suggested tuberculosis in 52 cases (90 percent). In 45 cases, the emergency room physician failed to elicit the patient's respiratory symptoms and did not consider tuberculosis as a diagnostic possibility. In 18 individuals, the diagnosis was missed in the emergency room because of failure to obtain a CXR. Among patients whose roentgenograms showed cavitation or extensive alveolar infiltrate, sputum smears showed AFB in 98 percent of cases. If alveolar infiltrate was absent, or if the roentgenographic pattern was not that of adult reactivation disease, sputum smears revealed AFB in only one half of the cases. We conclude that routine admission CXRs are useful in hospitals serving populations where tuberculosis is still common, and the probability of detecting AFB on sputum smear is greatly influenced by the roentgenographic findings.\r"

The dominant pathogens are Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which persist in the patient's respiratory tract. Current explanations of the chronicity of the infections in the apparently immunocompetent host are based on defective opsonophagocytosis. This may be caused by (1) bacterial exopolysaccharide production, leading to cryptic infection types; (2) cleavage of immunoglobulin, complement, and surface receptors on immunocompetent cells by host proteases; and (3) a change from opsonic to nonopsonic antibody isotypes. Continuous antigenic stimulation of the immune system leads to local immune complex formation and a high chronic hypersensitivity reaction as well as to temporary immune unresponsiveness. Progressive tissue damage caused by lysosomal enzymes and oxygen radicals from polymorphonuclear leukocytes is thought to be ultimately responsible for respiratory failure and death in CF. Besides antibiotic treatment, anti-inflammatory therapy is therefore currently considered beneficial.\r"

The main criterion for assessing the results of antimicrobial therapy in CF is therefore clinical improvement. The use of clinical scoring systems and double-blind design in therapeutic trials can reduce bias in evaluation of outcome. Assessment of the contribution of antibiotic therapy to the outcome requires greater knowledge of the role of bacterial infection in the pathogenesis of pulmonary exacerbations and could be improved by the development of quantifiable markers in respiratory secretions for inflammation.\r"

Cultures of these cells can be prepared at a purity of 85% by a method that is widely used to prepare the same cells from postnatal rats. The fetal cells are identical in appearance to postnatal Sertoli cells. Fetal Sertoli cells round up in response to (Bu)2cAMP, but not in response to FSH. Protein synthesis in the cells is not stimulated by (Bu)2cAMP or FSH. However, incorporation of [35S]methionine into secreted proteins appearing in the incubation medium is stimulated by the cyclic nucleotide, but not by FSH. Reproducible patterns for the incorporation of [35S]methionine into cellular and secreted proteins are presented as autoradiograms of one- and two-dimensional electrophoretograms. These autoradiograms show that the response of secreted proteins to (Bu)2cAMP is a general one; most or all proteins participate in the response. No clear differences were observed in the nature of the proteins synthesized when cells from fetal rats of 15, 18, and 21 days of age were compared. Fetal Sertoli cells produced approximately 2 nmol lactate/10(6) cells.h, which is approximately one fifth of the amount produced by postnatal cells. Lactate production was increased by the addition of FSH or (Bu)2cAMP to the medium. Fetal Sertoli cells also synthesize androgen-binding protein, and this activity is not increased by either FSH or (Bu)2cAMP.\r"

  ".W": "Exposure of FRTL-5 thyroid cells to ATP (1 microM to 1 mM) resulted in the stimulation of I- efflux in association with the induction of inositol trisphosphate production and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. Nonhydrolyzable ATP derivatives, ADP and GTP, were also as effective in magnitude as ATP, whereas neither AMP nor adenosine exerted significant effect on I- efflux, suggesting a P2-purinergic receptor-mediated activation of I- efflux. Treatment of the cells with the islet-activating protein (IAP) pertussis toxin, which ADP-ribosylated a 41,000 mol wt membrane protein, effectively suppressed the phosphoinositide response to ATP in addition to ATP-dependent I- efflux at agonist concentrations below 10 microM. In contrast, the I- efflux stimulated by TSH, A23187, or phorbol myristate acetate was insusceptible to IAP. The IAP substrate, probably GTP-binding protein, is hence proposed to mediate the activation of P2-purinergic receptor-linked phospholipase-C in FRTL-5 cells. However, the responses to ATP, its nonhydrolyzable derivatives, or ADP at the higher agonist concentrations, especially above 100 microM, were only partially inhibited by IAP, even though the IAP substrate was totally ADP ribosylated by the toxin. The responses to GTP in the whole concentration range tested were not influenced by IAP treatment. Thus, signals arising from the P2-receptor might be transduced to phospholipase-C by two different pathways, i.e. IAP-sensitive and insensitive ones, and result in the stimulation of I- efflux.\r"

  ".U": "88283509\r", 
  ".W": "In the present work the molecular mechanisms of glucagon-induced desensitization of adenylate cyclase in cultured Sertoli cells have been studied in both whole cells and in a cell-free system. 1) Pretreatment of both whole Sertoli cells and membranes with glucagon induces a time- and dose-dependent desensitization of adenylate cyclase response that is primarily homologous and similar in the two systems. The component of heterologous desensitization, estimated by the reduced responsiveness to other hormones and NaF, accounted for only 12-20% loss of glucagon-responsive adenylate cyclase activity (P less than 0.01). 2) Glucagon-induced desensitization is ATP-dependent. Half maximal desensitization was achieved between 0.1 and 0.2 mM of ATP. 3) The typical time lag in the maximal activation of adenylate cyclase by GMPP(NH)P in the absence of hormone reappeared upon desensitization in spite of the presence of glucagon. The lag, however, was eliminated by FSH, showing that the homologous desensitization is due to a receptor-specific alteration. 4) The heterologous component of glucagon-induced desensitization is largely cAMP/protein kinase dependent. cAMP/protein kinase-induced desensitization was heterologous and caused approximately 30% loss of both hormonal and fluoride-stimulated enzyme activity. 5) Glucagon-induced desensitization is not due to altered activity of Ni since it proceeded equally well in membranes of cells pretreated with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml) which eliminates Ni-mediated effects. It is concluded that glucagon induces both homologous and heterologous desensitization of the Sertoli cell adenylate cyclase. The locus of homologous desensitization appears to be at the level of the receptor and most probably involves a cAMP-independent phosphorylation reaction, whereas the heterologous desensitization appears to be cAMP-mediated and at least involves impaired functional activity of the Ns component.\r"

To investigate the role of placental GHRH, we measured it in human and rat placenta of different gestational stages, using specific RIA systems. GHRH and somatostatin contents in median eminence, pituitary GH contents, and plasma GHRH levels were also quantified in rats. Immunoreactive GHRH was detectable in rat placenta [13 days of gestation, 1.4 +/- 0.4 (+/- SD); 16 days, 1.4 +/- 0.2; 20 days, 1.7 +/- 0.4 ng/g] but not in human placenta (less than 0.06 ng/g in both full-term and mid-term placenta). GHRH concentrations in rat placenta did not change significantly during pregnancy, but total contents increased progressively in relation to placental growth. GHRH and somatostatin contents in median eminence of pregnant rats were not different from those of control female rats. In contrast, rat pituitary GH contents in pregnant rats were significantly lower than those of control female rats. Immunoreactive GHRH was not detectable in plasma of either pregnant rats or nonpregnant rats. Molecular sieve chromatography revealed two peaks of immunoreactive GHRH in rat placental extracts: a major peak eluted in the position of synthetic rat GHRH and a minor peak in the higher molecular weight region. In contrast, a single peak in the position of rat GHRH was observed in rat median eminence extracts. Detection of immunoreactive GHRH in rat placenta but not in human may suggest that the mechanism of GHRH gene expression in placenta is species specific. Failure of detection of immunoreactive GHRH in rat maternal circulation suggests that placental GHRH may not affect the maternal hypothalamic pituitary axis. Presence of high molecular weight materials of immunoreactive GHRH in rat placenta but not in median eminence suggests that posttranslational processing of the GHRH precursor molecule may be different in the two organs. Placental GHRH may have a paracrine function or may be secreted into fetal circulation and contribute to fetal growth.\r"

Plasma GH levels were measured 7 days postoperatively every 20 min in conscious animals with indwelling iv cannulae. Median eminence SRIF was markedly reduced 8 days postoperatively in both AHD and MPO rats, as determined by immunohistochemistry and RIA (P less than 0.01). Although GRF immunoreactivity in the median eminence of AHD and MPO animals appeared well preserved immunocytochemically, hypothalamic GRF content by RIA was significantly decreased at 8 days (P less than 0.01). Spontaneous GH secretion was pulsatile in sham-operated animals. In contrast, basal GH levels in AHD and MPO animals were markedly elevated (P less than 0.01), and secretory pulses were absent. Intravenous injection of specific anti-GRF serum into MPO animals decreased the elevated plasma GH levels (P less than 0.01), indicating increased hypothalamic GRF secretion. GRF release from hypothalamic median eminence-arcuate nucleus complexes in vitro was significantly greater in AHD and MPO animals than in control animals 4 and 8 days postoperatively in response to 30 mM K+ (P less than 0.01), but not under basal conditions. These results suggest that hypothalamic medial preoptic area somatostatinergic neurons play a tonic inhibitory role in the regulation of GRF release and that GH hypersecretion observed after MPO and AHD is attributable to changes in both SRIF and GRF.\r"

  ".W": "The steroid hormones, progesterone (P4) and cortisol (F), have different biological activities but are both bound to human corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG) with similar affinity. This study examines the effect of physiological concentrations of FFA on the binding of these steroids to purified CBG and to the serum of pregnant women. It also analyzes the influence of the FFA environment on the immunological behavior of CBG. Unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) had a dose-dependent inhibitory effect (P less than 0.001) on steroid binding to CBG which was offset by saturated fatty acid-induced potentiation of binding (P less than 0.01) when both were present with CBG. UFAs inhibited P4 binding more than F binding. Comparable results were obtained with pregnant serum or with pure CBG. UFAs seemed able, depending on their concentration, to promote different molecular states of CBG, some with enhanced F binding and significantly reduced P4 binding, and others in which both P4 and F binding was markedly reduced. Scatchard analysis of steroid binding to purified CBG indicated that the UFAs influenced the association constant (Ka) and the number of binding sites (n) for F and P4 binding differently. Low concentrations (less than 16 microM) of arachidonic acid (C20:4) slightly potentiated F binding, with no change in Ka and a 1.6-fold increase in n; this concentration of C20:4 reduced n for P4 binding by 40% and did not affect Ka. Higher C20:4 concentrations (greater than 32 microM), reduced the Ka for F binding but did not apparently change n; for P4 binding, Ka was sharply reduced and n increased. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) for both F and P4 binding varied nonlinearly and differently with increasing C20:4 concentration. Immunoelectrophoresis and immunoautoradiography showed a reduction, or loss, of CBG immunoreactivity in the presence of UFA. The extent of these changes varied with the concentration and class of the UFA. These results indicate that FFA induce conformational changes in CBG which may modulate its activity and so influence the role of this protein in both the endocrine and immune systems.\r"

  ".U": "88283532\r", 
  ".W": "The effect of testosterone on the induction of Sertoli cell ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity was investigated in highly purified cultures derived from testes of 20-day-old rats. Sertoli cell cultures were maintained in serum-free Ham's F-10 medium, with refeeding on days 2 and 4. Before refeeding on day 4, ODC activity was 7.4 U (1 U = 1 pmol 14CO2 released/mg protein.60 min at 37 C). After a medium change, ODC activity increased (41.6 U at 10 h; 180.0 U at 24 h) and then returned to near-basal activity (26.3 U) after 48 h. Simultaneous addition of testosterone (150 ng/ml; 5.2 X 10(-7) M) with the day 4 medium change suppressed the increase in ODC induction (7.53 U at 10 h, 91.6 U at 24 h). Addition of testosterone 24 h before refeeding resulted in greater inhibition of ODC induction (6.9 U at 10 h; 45.4 U at 24 h) than when added simultaneously. Other androgens, 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone, androsterone, and 5 alpha-androstane-3 alpha,17 beta-diol, also suppressed induction of ODC, whereas 17 beta-estradiol was ineffective, illustrating the steroid specificity of the effect. Coadministration of the antiandrogens hydroxyflutamide or cyproterone acetate partially blocked the testosterone effect. Induction of ODC activity by ovine FSH (10 ng/ml) was also suppressed when Sertoli cells were cultured in the presence of testosterone (150 ng/ml) from the time of isolation. However, induction of ODC activity by (BU)2cAMP was uncompromised by testosterone. These results suggest that testosterone may repress ODC activity and, hence, polyamine biosynthesis in the Sertoli cell, but that cAMP, acting through the trophic hormone FSH, can overcome this suppression of putrescine biosynthesis. Intratesticular and hypophyseal modulation of polyamine biosynthesis may influence not only cellular processes in the Sertoli cell itself but also its role in spermatogenesis.\r"

Dopamine synthesis in vitro in TIDA neurons was estimated by 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) accumulation in the median eminence after incubation of slices with a DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor. The enkephalin agonist [D-Ala2]Met-enkephalinamide (ENKamide) decreased the rate of basal DOPA accumulation in the median eminence portion of hypothalamic slices from ovariectomized rats at concentrations over 2 microM. The inhibitory action of ENKamide was more pronounced in hypothalamic slices from haloperidol-treated rats in which basal DOPA accumulation in the median eminence was stimulated by increased PRL secretion. In contrast, ENKamide decreased neither the rate of depolarization- induced CA2+-dependent DOPA accumulation nor the rate of (Bu)2cAMP- or forskolin-induced DOPA accumulation in the median eminence of normal or haloperidol-treated rats. The rank order of the potencies of enkephalins and their analogs for inhibition of DOPA accumulation in the median eminence was similar to that of their binding capacities for opioid receptors. ENKamide inhibited basal DOPA accumulation even when hypothalamic slices were incubated in Ca2+-free medium to which tetrodotoxin was added or when the median eminence was incubated alone without the remainder of the hypothalamic slice. These results suggest that enkephalin, by acting directly on axon terminals of TIDA neurons in the median eminence, inhibits basal dopamine synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "Earlier studies demonstrated that the 20K-dalton variant of human GH (hGH), which differs from hGH by deletion of the amino acid residues 32-46, has decreased insulin-like activity. The current study assessed whether a peptide representing this deleted region could enhance insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in the intact rat and if this effect was localized in liver and/or muscle. Peptides hGH-(32-46) and rat GH-(32-45) were used in these studies. Assessment of the action of a peptide was done by determining its effect on the steady state serum glucose (SSSG) concentration during an insulin suppression test. Glucose was infused alone and with two rates of infusion of insulin. The data indicated that neither of the GH peptides affected SSSG in the absence of exogenously administered insulin or at low (40 microU/ml) serum levels of insulin, but when serum insulin was increased to 77 microU/ml, a significant (P less than 0.05) decrease in SSSG was produced by the peptides. In subsequent studies isolated liver and hind limb skeletal muscle were perfused with a solution of hGH-(32-46). Basal glucose release from the liver was suppressed by both hGH-(32-46) and insulin alone, and this decrease was not enhanced by combining insulin with hGH-(32-46). Glucose uptake by skeletal muscle, expressed as a metabolic clearance constant (k), was enhanced by infusion of insulin and further increased with added peptide. Basal uptake was 6.67 microliter/min.g muscle; uptake was 8.17 microliter/min.g (P less than 0.01) after addition of 128 microU/ml insulin. This increased still farther to 9.24 microliter/min.g (P less than 0.05) when peptide was administered with insulin. These findings suggest that GH peptides independently suppress glucose outflow from the liver and potentiate insulin action by facilitating glucose uptake by peripheral tissues.\r"

To determine if the cells surrounding the granulosa cells generate TGF beta-like activity, which influences the growth and differentiation of granulosa cells, we cultured rat ovarian thecal/interstitial cells under serum-free conditions and collected their secretion products. Conditioned medium generated by primary cultures of thecal/interstitial cells over a 6-day collection period stimulated DNA synthesis, suggesting the presence of TGF beta-like bioactivity. At the onset of the collection period extracts of cultured cells contained undetectable levels of TGF beta-like activity, suggesting that the factor was produced and released by thecal/interstitial cells. FSH augmented the actions of both TGF beta and conditioned medium on DNA synthesis. Using an independent assay that relies on the response of the aromatase complex we showed that TGF beta and conditioned medium had parallel effects; TGF beta and conditioned medium alone did not influence the basal levels of aromatase activity, but both treatments augmented FSH-induced aromatase activity. Treatment of the conditioned medium with heat, acid, or alkali resulted in an increase in TGF beta-like bioactivity, suggesting that the TGF beta-like factor could be activated under these conditions. A commercially available antibody known to neutralize the bioactivity of TGF beta blocked the actions of TGF beta on DNA synthesis and blocked the growth-promoting activity of conditioned medium in a dose-dependent manner. Fractionation of the proteins in conditioned medium by elution through a Sephadex G-75 (superfine) column under acidic conditions showed that the growth-promoting activity and the aromatase activator eluted in fractions containing proteins with mol wt 25K. Standard TGF beta eluted in the same fractions. In summary, rat thecal/interstitial cells in culture secrete a TGF beta-like factor. The TGF beta-like factor may act together with FSH to promote growth and activate the aromatase complex of granulosa cells developing in the intrafollicular lumen in close association with the oocyte.\r"

  ".W": "Studies were done to assess the contribution of alpha-tocopherol to the regional differences in microsomal lipid peroxidation (LP) and steroid metabolism in the guinea pig adrenal cortex. In normal guinea pigs, ferrous ion (Fe2+)- and ascorbic acid-induced LP are far greater in microsomal preparations from the inner adrenal zone (zona reticularis) than in those from the outer zones (zona fasciculata plus zona glomerulosa). The amounts of unsaturated fatty acids, substrates for LP, are similar in the two zones, but alpha-tocopherol concentrations are 4-5 times greater in outer than inner zone microsomes. Tocopherol depletion by dietary deprivation had little effect on LP in vitro in inner zone microsomes, but substantially increased LP in outer zone preparations. As a result, tocopherol deficiency eliminated the zonal differences in microsomal LP. Unsaturated FFA concentrations were lower in tocopherol-deficient microsomal preparations than in those from tocopherol-sufficient animals, suggesting peroxidative losses in vivo. Tocopherol deficiency decreased steroid C-17,20 lyase activity in outer zone microsomes, but had no effect on activity in inner zone preparations, eliminating the normal zonal difference in activity (outer greater than inner). The results indicate that alpha-tocopherol is a major determinant of adrenal LP and is responsible for the regional differences in microsomal LP in guinea pig adrenal cortex; the effects of ascorbic acid on LP in each zone are also affected by alpha-tocopherol. alpha-Tocopherol may influence the functional zonation of the adrenal cortex by selectively protecting outer zone steroidogenic enzymes from oxidative degradation.\r"

The first effect of corticosteroids is to induce a reversible growth inhibition, which is probably permissive for the following cytolysis. Distinct mechanisms for the two effects are likely. Since dilution of S49.1 lymphoma cultures resulted in a drastic reduction of the proliferation rate, which could be overcome by the addition of conditioned medium, the proliferation appears to depend on the presence of autocrine growth factors. Therefore, the cytostatic effect of corticosteroids could possibly be attributable to an interference with the production of endogenous growth factors. Analysis of the growth-promoting activity in culture supernatant showed that the critical growth factor in diluted cultures is an arachidonic acid metabolite, the leukotriene B4. The role of leukotriene B4 in S49.1 cell proliferation received further support from the finding that while nordihydroguaiaretic acid, an inhibitor of the lipoxygenase pathway which is necessary for leukotriene formation blocked lymphoma multiplication, indomethacin, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase activity, did not affect proliferation. Quantitation of the leukotriene B4 content of dexamethasone-treated vs. untreated cultures revealed an almost complete inhibition of leukotriene production, pointing to the significance of this mechanism for the glucocorticoid-induced lymphoma growth inhibition. Moreover, these findings offer a new approach to increase the therapeutic effectiveness of glucocorticoid therapy of steroid-sensitive leukemias and lymphomas.\r"

Fertilization rates in the whole group studied were significantly related to percentage normal morphology, concentration of sperm inseminated and cause of infertility. However, with normal morphology less than 30%, the proportion of sperm with normal intact acrosomes in the insemination medium was the only significant factor related to fertilization rate in the logistic regression analysis. Thus, assessment of acrosomes may be of clinical value for predicting the fertility of men with poor sperm morphology.\r"

Eighty consecutive new patients underwent a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulation test on the morning of cycle day 3. All patients underwent the same stimulation protocol consisting of a combination of FSH and human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG). Paired discriminant analysis of FSH0 (at 0 minutes from GnRH injection) and LH0 revealed seven distinct groups of patients with statistically significant differences among the means: groups 1, 2, and 3 (26.25%) with higher means FSH0:LH0; group 4 (40%) with mean FSH0:LH0 (both levels less than 10 mIU/ml) of 1:1, and groups 5, 6, and 7 (33.75%) with higher mean LH0:FSH0. Canonical discriminant analysis of both basal and stimulated serum FSH and LH levels confirmed the seven groups and did not add to the information from analysis of FSH0 and LH0 only. Serum estradiol (E2) response during stimulation, as well as the number of preovulatory oocytes aspirated and transferred, was highest in the groups with a higher mean LH0:FSH0, intermediate in the group with mean FSH0:LH0 of 1:1, and lowest in the group with a higher mean FSH0:LH0. No pregnancy occurred in the higher FSH:LH groups. It is concluded that basal serum gonadotropin levels can distinguish different populations of IVF patients who tend to behave differently in terms of E2 response, oocytes obtained and transferred, and pregnancy rates and outcome.\r"

This study evaluated LH pulsatility in patients with idiopathic normogonadotropic oligospermia (INO) and normal men before and after clomiphene citrate (CC) administration. INO patients evidenced a lower mean LH levels (P less than 0.001), a higher mean pulse frequency (P less than 0.05) and similar pulse amplitude than normal men. CC induced in normal men a higher LH and testosterone (T) increments and increased pulse amplitude only in normal men. Estradiol (E2) showed no difference in either group. Patients with INO might evidence a hypothalamic disorder that may alter pulsatile GnRH secretion. A different response to CC in patients with INO seems to lend support to a primary hypothalamic lesion. A probable gonadotropin imbalance might alter intratesticular concentrations of T and E2 and be the cause of spermatogenic failure.\r"

If, however, the synthesis of endogenous prostaglandin was inhibited by indomethacin, the topical application of 75% ethanol resulted in complete superficial mucosal microcirculatory stasis in the majority of rats. In indomethacin-pretreated rats, Rioprostil, a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analogue, reversed this effect of topical ethanol. The degree of ethanol-induced histologic gastric mucosal damage was inversely correlated with time to complete stasis. Ethanol injury studies under various conditions revealed that laparotomy stimulated a gastric protective mechanism that persisted for between 1 and 2 h and that was blocked by indomethacin. In conclusion, (a) laparotomy stimulates a gastric mucosal protective mechanism that probably is mediated by prostaglandin synthesis, and (b) cessation of mucosal blood flow appears to be an important early step in ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury, and maintenance of mucosal blood flow by endogenous or exogenous prostaglandin may play a major role in prostaglandin protection.\r"

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of luminal perfusion with N-formyl methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP), a bacterial product that attracts and activates granulocytes, on mucosal permeability in different regions of the rat small intestine and colon. Mucosal permeability was measured using blood-to-lumen clearance of 51Cr-ethylenediamine-tetraacetate during luminal perfusion with FMLP (10(-3) to 10(-8) M) dissolved in Tyrode's solution. Of the bowel segments studied, mucosal permeability was significantly increased by FMLP only in the distal 10 cm of ileum. The minimal FMLP concentration required to increase mucosal permeability was 10(-6) M. The increased mucosal permeability induced by FMLP could be prevented by depletion of circulating granulocytes with antineutrophil serum. The greater sensitivity of the distal ileum to FMLP did not correlate with a higher tissue myeloperoxidase activity, but it was associated with a higher basal ethylenediaminetetraacetate clearance. These observations indicate that a high basal mucosal permeability to solutes the size of FMLP (5-6 A radius), rather than a greater number of resident granulocytes in the lamina propria, predisposes the terminal ileum to the inflammatory actions of FMLP.\r"

  ".U": "88284193\r", 
  ".W": "Some, but not all, studies have suggested that high-fat diets promote colon carcinogenesis, possibly by stimulating the proliferative activity of colonic epithelium. Both the increase in colonic excretion of bile salts and of fatty acids that occur with an increase in fat ingestion have been implicated as stimuli of epithelial proliferative activity. In this study, we examined the role of activation of protein kinase C in fatty acid-induced stimulation of colonic epithelial proliferation in the rat. Intracolonic instillation of arachidonate, linoleate, or oleate at concentrations that did not induce surface cell injury or loss increased colonic mucosal ornithine decarboxylase activity and stimulated incorporation of [3H]thymidine into mucosal deoxyribonucleic acid. The saturated fatty acid palmitate was without effect. Arachidonate, linoleate, and oleate each induced the translocation of protein kinase C activity from the soluble fraction to the membrane fraction of colonic mucosa, an index of enzyme activation. The translocation of protein kinase C induced by unsaturated fatty acids occurred both in vivo after intracolonic instillation of these agents and in vitro upon incubation of isolated colonic crypt epithelium with fatty acids. The effects of the unsaturated fatty acids on both enzyme translocation and colonic epithelial proliferative activity were suppressed by 1-(5-isoquinolinyl)-2-methylpiperazine, an inhibitor of protein kinase C activity. Unsaturated fatty acids directly stimulated soluble colonic mucosal protein kinase C activity when added to the enzyme assay mixture. This action was blocked by 1-(5-isoquinolinyl)-2-methylpiperazine. However, unsaturated fatty acids also increased the breakdown of polyphosphoinositides when added to isolated colonic epithelium. The increase in polyphosphoinositide breakdown resulted in release of diacylglycerol, an endogenous activator of protein kinase C. Thus, unsaturated fatty acids may activate protein kinase C of colonic epithelium through either a direct intracellular effect or through an action on the cell membrane. The results support a role for protein kinase C in the stimulation of colonic epithelial proliferation by unsaturated fatty acids.\r"

  ".W": "After massive small bowel resection, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is prescribed to maintain nutritional status. However, TPN reduces the mass of the remaining intestinal mucosa, whereas adaptation to small bowel resection is associated with increased mucosal mass. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have been shown to stimulate mucosal cell mitotic activity. This study determined whether the addition of SCFAs to TPN following small bowel resection would prevent intestinal mucosal atrophy produced by TPN. Adult rats underwent an 80% small bowel resection and then received either standard TPN or TPN supplemented with SCFAs (sodium acetate, propionate, and butyrate). After 1 wk, jejunal and ileal mucosal weights, deoxyribonucleic acid, ribonucleic acid, and protein contents were measured and compared with the parameters obtained at the time of resection. Animals receiving TPN showed significant loss of jejunal mucosal weight, deoxyribonucleic acid, ribonucleic acid, and protein and ileal mucosal weight and deoxyribonucleic acid after small bowel resection, whereas animals receiving SCFA-supplemented TPN showed no significant change in the jejunal mucosal parameters and a significant increase in ileal mucosal protein. These data demonstrate that SCFA-supplemented TPN reduces the mucosal atrophy associated with TPN after massive bowel resection and thys may facilitate adaptation to small bowel resection.\r"

  ".W": "The ratio of the serum aspartate to alanine amino-transferase levels (AST/ALT) is often used as a clue to the etiology of the underlying liver disease. This ratio is usually greater than 2.0 in alcoholic liver disease and less than 1.0 in patients with chronic hepatitis and chronic cholestatic syndromes. We analyzed the AST/ALT ratio in 177 patients with various forms of nonalcoholic chronic liver disease who underwent medical evaluation and percutaneous liver biopsy. In the majority of cases of chronic viral hepatitis, the AST/ALT ratio was less than 1.0. However, there was a statistically significant correlation between the AST/ALT ratio and the presence of cirrhosis. Among 100 patients with chronic type B hepatitis, the mean AST/ALT ratio was 0.59 in those without cirrhosis and 1.02 in those with cirrhosis. Furthermore, the AST/ALT ratio often rose to greater than 1.0 when cirrhosis first became manifest. Thus, the finding of an AST/ALT ratio of greater than 1.0 in a patient with nonalcoholic liver disease should suggest the presence of cirrhosis. In addition, the use of the AST/ALT ratio as a means of separating alcoholic and nonalcoholic liver disease must be tempered with the knowledge that this ratio may be less helpful in the presence of cirrhosis.\r"

  ".U": "88284205\r", 
  ".W": "Human atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) levels were measured before and after peritoneovenous shunt implantation in 10 cirrhotic patients with ascites, in whom sodium retention is a major clinical problem. The mean preoperative plasma level of ANF was 82 ng/L (normal range, 5-80 ng/L). Peritoneovenous shunting resulted in a significant rise in plasma ANF to 308 ng/L (p less than 0.0025) immediately after operation. This was followed by a constant fall until the seventh postoperative day, when mean plasma ANF was still significantly elevated (149 ng/L) compared with the preoperative value (p less than 0.01). Three months after shunt implantation mean plasma ANF had returned to the preoperative level (75 ng/L). Mean sodium excretion increased from 2.6 mEq/h preoperatively to 10.2 mEq/h at the second postoperative day (p less than 0.025). No direct relationship was noted between changes in plasma ANF level and changes in urinary sodium excretion after shunt implantation. These data demonstrate an intact ANF release response to intravascular volume expansion in cirrhotic patients with ascites, but exclude ANF as the diminished natriuretic factor as proposed by the overflow theory of ascites formation. Sodium excretion and fluid retention seem to be the result of vascular underfill and fluid maldistribution, and hormonal changes are likely to be secondary to them.\r"
