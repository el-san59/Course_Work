To better understand this behavior and to treat the disease more effectively, the medical records of 16 patients treated for this disease over a 12-year period were reviewed. Thirteen patients had head and neck lesions, the ear being a common site. The average thickness of the lesions was 5.75 mm. Six (46.2%) of 13 patients had local recurrence of disease. Only two patients (15.4%) developed regional node metastases. None of the patients with clinically NO desmoplastic melanoma were found to have positive nodes after elective neck dissection, regardless of the thickness of the primary lesion. Wide excision of the primary lesion with frozen section control of surgical margins and careful examination for the presence of perineural invasion is important in determining the extent of surgical resection.\r"

The image is usually interpreted subjectively, and in the present study a histogram of left ventricular phase values was used to make interpretation more objective. The left ventricular ejection fraction and the standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis of the phase histogram were measured at rest, during isometric exercise, and during the final two stages of maximal dynamic exercise in 25 controls and 27 patients with coronary artery disease without previous infarction. The ejection fraction and the standard deviation of the phase had the same predictive accuracy for the presence of disease when measured during the penultimate stage of dynamic exercise (89%) as during the final stage, but their accuracy was lower during maximal exercise (77%) because of motion artefact at high exercise levels. Skewness and kurtosis of the histogram were of no value for the detection of disease, and isometric exercise was of only limited value. It is concluded that the phase histogram provides an objective measurement of the synchronicity of left ventricular contraction and can increase sensitivity for the detection of abnormality. Data should be acquired at all stages of dynamic exercise, and the penultimate stage should be used if there is any doubt about the validity of the final stage.\r"

Cardiac catheterisation has been the reference standard for diagnosis but even this does not always permit an accurate distinction. A Summagraphics digitiser and Prime 750 computer system were used to digitise the echocardiograms of 15 patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy, 10 with constrictive pericarditis and a group of 20 age and sex matched normal subjects of similar age and sex distribution. Compared with controls, patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy showed a significant reduction in the following variables (a) decreased fractional shortening, (b) decreased peak left ventricular filling and emptying rates, (c) decreased percentage posterior wall thickening, and (d) decreased peak left ventricular posterior wall thickening and thinning rates. Whereas patients with constrictive pericarditis only had significantly reduced peak left ventricular filling and posterior wall thinning rates and significantly increased posterior wall thinning rate. When patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy were compared with those with constrictive pericarditis the significant differences were: (a) decreased peak left ventricular emptying rate, (b) decreased percentage posterior wall thickening, and (c) decreased peak left ventricular posterior wall thickening and thinning rates. Digitisation of M mode echocardiograms, with particular attention to posterior wall function, may be a useful adjunct to cardiac catheterisation in distinguishing restrictive cardiomyopathy from constrictive pericarditis.\r"

A single R-wave-synchronised 250 or 150 J cathodal shock was delivered at each site. One patient had mildly symptomatic episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia during the first four days after the shock--there were no other complications. At discharge none of the patients was taking antiarrhythmic drugs. They were followed for 8-20 months (mean 14). Ablation abolished five of the 11 ventricular tachycardias. There was no recurrence in three of the eight patients. In two patients identical ventricular tachycardias recurred because the identification of the arrhythmogenic site was incorrect.\r"

Pacing with a short or long atrioventricular interval gave similar maximum heart rates, oxygen uptake at the anaerobic threshold, end tidal pressure of carbon dioxide or oxygen pulse (a measure of stroke volume). Pacing with either a short or long atrioventricular interval produced a significantly higher oxygen consumption and anaerobic threshold and less lactate production than VVI pacing. During exercise a short atrioventricular interval does not provide a better cardiopulmonary performance than a long atrioventricular interval.\r"

The findings were analysed in relation to the state of the cardiovascular system of these patients. Cyanosis was present in 10 (13.5%) patients. The causes of cyanosis included residual interatrial shunt (six patients), acquired pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas (three patients) and acquired systemic-to-pulmonary vein communication (one patient). Signs of chronic fluid retention were detected in six (8%) patients. In four of them the fluid retention was related to conduit obstruction and in the remaining two it was secondary to severe subaortic stenosis in one and atrioventricular valvar regurgitation in the other. Organic heart murmurs were heard in 29 (39%) patients. The aetiologies of these murmurs were multiple. They included aortic valve regurgitation (eight patients), subaortic stenosis (seven patients), atrioventricular valvar regurgitation (five patients), pulmonary valve regurgitation (five patients), residual Blalock-Taussig shunt (two patients), residual ventricular septal defect (two patients), residual communication in the main pulmonary artery which had been ligated but not divided (one patient), and left ventricular to right atrial shunting (one patient). Cardiac rhythm disturbances of varying aetiology were noted in 23 (31.1%) patients. Sixteen (21%) had supraventricular arrhythmias and seven (9.5%) had conduction abnormalities. The present review suggests that among survivors of the Fontan type of operation abnormal cardiac signs are indicators of residua or sequelae or both of the native cardiovascular anomalies or surgical procedures.\r"

In two patients recurrent pseudoaneurysms developed after cardiac surgery, three had acute rupture after myocardial infarction, two were the result of stab wounds, one was a late rupture of a true left ventricular aneurysm, one developed after surgical resection of a true left ventricular aneurysm, and two as a consequence of left ventricular venting. In all 11 cases the diagnosis was confirmed by angiographic or surgical information or both. The diagnosis was suspected clinically in only four cases. Cross sectional echocardiography alone confirmed the diagnosis in five cases. Neither pulsed wave Doppler nor continuous wave Doppler established the diagnosis when they were used without colour flow imaging in five and three cases respectively. In all 11 cases colour flow imaging showed flow in and out of the pericardial cavity at the defect site as well as the abnormal flow within the pseudoaneurysm. Subsequent use of pulsed Doppler showed a consistent \"to and fro\" flow pattern across the myocardial defect with characteristic respiratory variation of the peak systolic velocity. This unique intrapericardial flow pattern is diagnostic of a pseudoaneurysm. Colour flow imaging is a valuable addition to cross sectional and Doppler echocardiography, and is the best technique for detecting left ventricular pseudoaneurysms.\r"

Venous blood samples were collected for up to 180 min, and plasma concentrations of morphine, morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G), and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) assayed by a differential radioimmunoassay technique. There were no differences between groups with respect to the elimination half-life (awake group: 207 min; anaesthetized group: 153 min), volume of distribution at steady state (awake: 147 litre; anaesthetized: 128 litre), or clearance (awake: 587 ml min-1; anaesthetized: 766 ml min-1). Peak concentrations of M3G were similar in the two groups, but the peak concentration of M6G was greater in the anaesthetized patients. The AUC for M3G and M6G (0-180 min) also were greater in the anaesthetized patients, presumably as a result of decreases in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate during halothane anaesthesia.\r"

The lower neck flexion is 35 degrees and extension of the plane of the face 15 degrees, each angle measured relative to horizontal. Initially, the standard was derived from a review of the literature, then validated in a study of the intubating practices of 10 senior anaesthetists. A more detailed study of 10 normal volunteers confirmed reproducibility and, for nine patients with a history of difficult direct laryngoscopy, the standard was shown to be appropriate.\r"

Eight patients breathed either nitrous oxide or isoflurane at 0.6 MAC for three consecutive 10-min periods following intubation and before surgery. The amplitudes of Pa and Nb were significantly less for isoflurane with respect to the same MAC fraction of nitrous oxide in all periods, but for both agents the amplitudes were significantly greater in the 10 min following intubation than in subsequent periods, presumably as a result of stimulation.\r"

There was no significant difference between the groups in their hormonal response to the procedure, both groups showing a peroperative reduction in plasma cortisol concentration from an initially high value, and the SST was within accepted normal limits for both groups. It was concluded that patients susceptible to MH have normal adrenal cortical reserve and responded normally to the psychological and surgical stress encountered during this study.\r"

Although a variable phenotype makes accurate diagnosis on the basis of clinical manifestations difficult in some patients, study of cellular sensitivity to the clastogenic effect of DNA cross-linking agents such as diepoxybutane (DEB) has been used to facilitate the diagnosis. Data from DEB-induced chromosomal breakage studies of 328 peripheral blood specimens from patients considered at risk for FA were analyzed using a stepwise multivariate logistic regression, in order to determine which method of representing the data best discriminated between DEB-sensitive (DEB+) and DEB-insensitive (DEB-) cases. Similar methods were applied to the data from the International Fanconi Anemia Registry (IFAR) to determine whether DEB+ and DEB- cases may be considered as distinct clinical entities, and if so, which variables provide the best discrimination between the two groups. We conclude that hypersensitivity to the clastogenic effect of DEB is a useful discriminator for FA. A simplified scoring method for classifying patients on the basis of eight clinical manifestations that are the best predictors for FA is presented. Our data indicate that the clinical diversity in FA is more widespread than previously recognized.\r"

As analyzed by computer program, the observed data fit a two-receptor site model, with p less than .05. High-affinity binding concentrations of rTNF caused the differentiation of both cell lines, whereas low-affinity binding concentrations abolished this effect in a concentration-dependent manner. Thus, the type of biologic response elicited with rTNF in these cells is a function of the concentration at which the factor is applied. If generally applicable, this bimodal effect may require consideration when rTNF is to be used therapeutically.\r"

In the present study, we examined the effects of tiazofurin on mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cell differentiation and protooncogene expression. Tiazofurin induced hemoglobin production in MEL cells in a concentration-dependent manner, as measured by an increase in benzidine staining. Northern blot analysis of MEL cells treated with 7 mumol/L tiazofurin demonstrated accumulation of both alpha- and beta-globin RNA transcripts. This induction of differentiation was blocked by the presence of exogenous guanosine (100 mumol/L). In contrast to the down-regulation of c-myc and c-myb RNA in MEL cells induced by dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA), there was no detectable change in levels of these transcripts after tiazofurin treatment. Furthermore, MEL cells induced by tiazofurin did not commit to terminal differentiation. These results suggest a role for guanine nucleotides, at least in part, in the regulation of MEL cell differentiation.\r"

In the case of hemophilia resulting from a missing clotting factor, the required gene could be introduced into any cell as long as active factor reached the circulation. We previously showed that retroviral vectors can efficiently transfer genes into normal skin fibroblasts and that the infected cells can produce high levels of a therapeutic product in vitro. In the current study, we examined the ability of skin fibroblasts to secrete active clotting factor after infection with different retroviral vectors encoding human clotting factor IX. Normal human fibroblasts infected with one vector secreted greater than 3 micrograms factor IX/10(6) cells/24 h. Of this protein, greater than 70% was structurally and functionally indistinguishable from human factor IX derived from normal plasma. This suggests that infected autologous fibroblasts might provide therapeutic levels of factor IX if transplanted into patients suffering from hemophilia B. By transplanting normal diploid fibroblasts infected with the factor IX vectors, we showed that human factor IX can be produced and is circulated at readily detectable levels in rats and mice.\r"

APC:inhibitor complexes gave two major bands reacting with antiprotein C antibodies when immunoblotted on nondenaturing gels, and additional minor bands that varied between serum and plasma. Formation of one of the two major bands of APC:inhibitor complex, but not the other, was stimulated by heparin and only this band reacted with antibodies to the previously described APC inhibitor that is here designated PCI-1. Plasma immunodepleted of PCI-1 formed complexes with APC as visualized with antiprotein C but not anti-PCI-1 antibodies, and exhibited heparin-independent inhibition of APC activity, providing evidence for the existence of a second major physiologic APC inhibitor, PCI-2. Formation of APC:PCI-2 complexes in PCI-1-depleted plasma paralleled inhibition of APC amidolytic activity. PCI-2 was separated from PCI-1 and partially purified using column chromatography. PCI-2 formed inactive complexes of approximately 110,000 molecular weight (mol wt) with APC suggesting PCI-2 has an approximate mol wt of 50,000. Thus, inhibition of APC in plasma involves two major distinct 50,000 mol wt inhibitors, the heparin-dependent PCI-1 and the heparin-independent PCI-2.\r"

In 24 normal plasmas, no detectable APC:PCI complexes were observed (less than 5%). Patients with higher levels of complexes had more abnormal coagulation test data for DIC. The major band of APC complexes detected by anti-protein C antibodies did not react with antibodies to the heparin-dependent protein C inhibitor (PCI-1) previously described. Rather, APC was complexed with another recently described plasma protein C inhibitor, PCI-2. Immunoblotting studies for protein S, the cofactor for APC, revealed that the majority of the DIC patient plasmas contained a higher than normal proportion of protein S in cleaved form, suggesting that protein S may have been proteolytically inactivated. Protein S total antigen levels were also found to be low in DIC patients, excluding those with malignancy. These studies support the hypothesis that the protein C pathway is activated during DIC.\r"

C5b-9 assembly on the platelet surface resulted in the release of dense granule adenosine triphosphate (ATP) accompanied by a decrease in sample turbidity, but no detectable cell lysis. Inhibition of cellular protein kinase C completely blocked the C5b-9 initiated release of ATP, confirming the secretory nature of this response. Addition of fibrinogen (up to 1 mg/mL) had no effect on either the release of ATP or the decreased turbidity observed for C5b-9 cells. Addition of the peptides Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) and fibrinogen gamma-chain carboxyl-terminal (gamma 397-411) at concentrations sufficient to completely block fibrinogen binding to GP IIb-IIIa had no effect on either C5b-9 induced dense granule secretion or the associated turbidity change. Microscopic examination and electronic particle counting of the stirred platelet suspensions confirmed that no aggregation of C5b-9 platelets occurred even when these cells were stirred in the presence of fibrinogen. The capacity of the C5b-9 proteins to initiate platelet secretion without activation of cell surface glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa suggests a mechanism for intravascular dissemination of activated platelets during complement activation in vivo.\r"

Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent \"sandwich\" assays specific for C1s-C1-and kallikrein-C1-inhibitor complexes respectively, we found that there was a modest increase in plasma levels of each complex after clinical cardiopulmonary bypass was completed. The increased concentration of enzyme-inhibitor complexes reverted to baseline within 24 hours. Since these complexes are cleared in vivo, we measured their formation by assaying their plasma levels during in vitro simulated extracorporeal circulation. Over a period of two hours, C1s-C1-inhibitor complexes rose from a baseline of 2 +/- 1 nmol/L to 21 +/- 2 nmol/L, and kallikrein-C1-inhibitor complexes rose from 2 +/- 1 nmol/L to 25 +/- 5 nmol/L. However, there was no evidence of either in vivo or in vitro plasmin-alpha 2-plasmin-inhibitor complex formation.

On incubation of platelets with 125I-thrombin, this platelet protein forms complexes with 125I-thrombin that are found both in the incubation medium and, as demonstrated here, associated with purified platelet plasma membranes. The present results indicate that interaction with the platelet surface may modulate the conformation and function of this platelet form of protease nexin I (PNIp) because: (a) an antibody against protease nexin I inhibited released PNIp, but not platelet-bound PNIp from complexing 125I-thrombin, and (b) whereas PNIp extracted from platelets bound both thrombin and urokinase, platelet-bound PNIp bound only thrombin. In experiments using several different platelet isolation methods, PNIp accounted for a large fraction of the rapid high affinity binding of 125I-thrombin to platelets. However, platelets isolated and maintained in the presence of metabolic inhibitors failed to take added thrombin into 125I-thrombin-PNIp complexes. This finding suggests that PNIp is released from inside platelets during activation, and thus does not function to transmit the primary activating signal that is generated by thrombin binding to platelets.\r"

Laboratory measurements of total protein S antigen in affected families have indicated that heterozygotes, ie, individuals carrying both a normal and a defective protein S gene, are severely at risk of developing venous thrombosis at a young age. The recent isolation of protein S cDNA has enabled us to start a search for genetic defects in the protein S gene of heterozygotes. Using Southern blotting on probands of six unrelated families with hereditary protein S deficiency, one proband was found to have a grossly abnormal gene pattern. The abnormality appears to involve at least the deletion of the middle portion of the protein S coding sequence. Family analysis showed that the defect cosegregates with the protein S deficiency. These data agree with the notion that hereditary thrombophilia associated with protein S deficiency is indeed directly the result of a defect in the protein S gene.\r"

Quantitative analysis of L3 in 12 infants and 91 older children with non-T ALL indicated lack of expression of polypeptide L3 in leukemic cells of infants which, in most cases, expressed HLA-DR and CD19 and lacked CD10. Quantitative analysis of L3 in relation to cell surface marker expression revealed that L3 was limited in its occurrence to non-T ALL and was not coordinately expressed with any of the surface markers included in the study. Among patients in the HLA-DR-positive, CD19-positive, and CD10-negative group, different levels of polypeptide L3 were observed between infants and older children. These results indicate differences in leukemic cell constituents between infants and older children with ALL and an otherwise similar cell surface marker phenotype.\r"

  ".W": "Morphologically distinct lymphoid cells with homogeneous, condensed chromatin and scant cytoplasm can be observed in large numbers in the bone marrow of children with a variety of hematologic and nonhematologic disorders. In some patients, these cells may account for greater than 50% of the bone marrow cells, creating a picture that can be confused with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or metastatic tumor. Although originally called hematogones (HGs), a variety of other names have been proposed for these unique cells. The clinical significance of expanded HGs has not been resolved, and the biologic features of these cells are incompletely described. In this study, we correlate the clinical, morphologic, cytochemical, flow cytometric, molecular, and cytogenetic properties of bone marrow samples from 12 children with substantial numbers of HGs (range 8% to 55% of bone marrow cells). Diagnoses in these patients included anemia, four; neutropenia, one; anemia and neutropenia, one; idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, two; retinoblastoma, two; Ewing's sarcoma, one; and germ cell tumor, one. Flow cytometric analyses of bone marrow cells demonstrated a spectrum extending from early B-cell precursors (CD10+, CD19+, TdT+, HLA-Dr+) to mature surface immunoglobulin-bearing B cells in these patients, corroborating our morphologic impression of HGs, intermediate forms, and mature lymphocytes. DNA content was normal, and no clonal abnormality was identified by either cytogenetic or immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement studies. Follow-up ranged from 3 months to 3 years. None of the patients has developed acute leukemia or bone marrow involvement by solid tumor. The possible role of HGs in immune recovery and hematopoiesis is presented.\r"

The antibody, NC-2, is of the IgG1 subclass and precipitates a 50-Kd protein from 125I-labeled HL-60 cells. The antigen is insensitive to treatment with trypsin, papain, or neuraminidase. NC-2 did not react with a number of established human cell lines, including Daudi, Molt-4, K562, U937, KG-1, CEM, Raji, and Gash-P. Neutrophils and monocytelike cells derived from HL-60 cells that were induced to differentiate continued to express the antigen. NC-2 reacted with all peripheral-blood cells except erythrocytes from eight (5%) of 150 normal individuals tested. Bone marrow samples from patients with myelogenous leukemias were more frequently reactive with NC-2 than were those from normal individuals (12/33 v 1/10). Family studies indicated that the antigen was inherited in an autosomal-dominant manner. These findings suggest that the expression of the above alloantigen is associated with an increased incidence of leukemia.\r"

SpT, in turn, are connected into a two-dimensional network by the linkage of distal ends of SpT to protein 4.1 and actin. With the micropipette technique, we determined the membrane viscoelastic properties of RBCs from a subset of patients with hereditary elliptocytosis (HE); these RBCs exhibit membrane skeletal instability, defective SpD self-association, and a molecular defect in the alpha I domain of spectrin, which is involved in the SpD-SpD contact (HE SpD alpha-SpD). The elastic modulus and viscosity of the membrane were significantly higher for the HE RBCs than for the control cells. Incubation of normal cells with N-ethyl-maleimide (NEM) produced a similar defective SpD self-association and a significant increase in the viscoelastic parameters of the membrane. The data provide evidence that the mode of assembly of membrane spectrin in the cytoskeletal protein network plays a major role in determining the rheologic behavior of erythrocyte membrane.\r"

The present study demonstrates that the serum antigen recognized by A3D8 antibody also resides on a protein similar in size to the protein present in erythrocyte membranes. Studies using chromatographically purified protein have further shown that this antigen shares many epitopes with that present in RBCs and is therefore likely to be extremely homologous or identical to the erythrocyte In(Lu)-related p80.\r"

In nine patients, we detected the compound heterozygous state for the -87 promoter mutation and the codon 39 nonsense mutation; in one patient, we detected the combination of the codon 39 nonsense mutation and beta + IVS-1 nt 6 mutation. These patients were either nontransfusion dependent for survival or became transfusion dependent later. We did not detect the -87 promoter mutation in any of 115 thalassemia major patients originating from the same part of Sardinia, investigated as controls. Heterozygotes for the -87 promoter mutation showed statistically higher hemoglobin (Hb) levels and larger and better hemoglobinized RBCs as compared with heterozygotes for the codon 39 nonsense mutation. From these data, we conclude that the -87 promoter mutation is a mild thalassemia allele, able to produce a phenotype of intermediate severity even in combination with a beta degree-thalassemia mutant. The coinheritance of alpha-thalassemia or the -++-- 5' subhaplotype in several cases may have contributed to development of the mild clinical picture. Characterization of the beta-thalassemia mutation in combination with alpha-globin mapping and haplotype analysis may allow a better estimate of the probability of a given clinical phenotype, thus permitting more accurate counseling.\r"

Statistical analysis of the association between thromboembolic disease and protein-C deficiency was strongly positive chi 2 = 24.95, P less than .0001 with n = 184), indicating that heterozygous protein-C deficiency is an important independent risk factor for the development of thrombotic manifestations in this pedigree. However, the absence of thromboembolic manifestations in many of the protein-C deficient family members to date indicates that other, as yet undefined, factors must play an important role in the clinical expression of this disorder.\r"

A point mutation that resulted in the substitution of a glutamine (CAG) for an arginine (CGG) at amino acid 180 was found in exon VI of the factor IX gene (G----A at nucleotide 20519). This mutation alters the carboxy terminal cleavage site for the activation peptide at Arg180-Val181. The arginine residue at the activation peptide cleavage site is conserved in mouse, canine, bovine, and human factor IX, suggesting that the arginine at amino acid 180 is important for normal cleavage. Sequencing of all of the coding regions of factor IXHilo revealed no other mutations. We have also shown that the point mutation in exon VI creates a new Dde I restriction site, which, in combination with the enzymatic DNA amplification technique, provides a quick, reliable, and sensitive method for carrier detection and antenatal diagnosis in affected kindreds. This is the first report of the molecular defect in a hemophilia Bm patient with a markedly prolonged ox brain prothrombin time.\r"

This prompted us to investigate whether human endothelial cells treated with endotoxin could promote the generation of fibrin when exposed to human flowing blood. For this purpose we used a parallel-plate perfusion chamber in which confluent cultured endothelial cells from human umbilical veins were exposed for five minutes to directly drawn human nonanticoagulated blood, at wall shear rates of 100, 650, and 2600 sec-1. Fibrin deposition was assessed by morphometry. No fibrin deposition occurred on normal endothelial cells. In contrast, cells incubated with endotoxin for 4 or 18 hours induced fibrin deposition, but only at a shear rate of 100 sec-1. Since some extracellular matrix was exposed between the cells, we investigated whether extracellular matrix played a role in fibrin formation. When the endothelial cells incubated or not with endotoxin were removed by EDTA, the exposed extracellular matrix perfused with blood at 100 sec-1 supported platelet and fibrin deposition in both cases. This suggests that the effect of endotoxin on endothelial cells was not due to extracellular matrix alteration but only to cellular activation or secretion of procoagulant substances. We conclude that human endothelial cells treated with endotoxin can trigger fibrin formation and deposition at their surface when exposed to flowing blood at low shear rate.\r"

The antimicrobial peptides termed defensins, comprising 30% of normal primary granule proteins, have also been shown to be markedly deficient in SGD. The present study was undertaken to correlate these findings with ultrastructural morphometric analysis and peroxidase cytochemistry. Peroxidase-positive, rim-stained, large, defensin-rich dense granules, previously described as a subpopulation of azurophil or primary granules in normal neutrophils, were markedly decreased in a patient with SGD. Morphometric studies of peroxidase-positive granules indicated an average peroxidase-positive granule area (all profiles) in the patient of 0.019 +/- 0.017 micron 2 (mean +/- SD, n = 941) compared to control values from normal neutrophils of two volunteers of 0.049 +/- 0.033 micron 2 (n = 896) and 0.050 +/- 0.039 micron 2 (n = 873) (P less than 0.001 between patient and control samples). Granule histograms showed a single peak of small peroxidase-positive granules, whereas control samples contained more prominent subpopulations of larger peroxidase-positive granules. The total number of peroxidase-positive granules per 100 micron 2 of cytoplasm in the patient was 255 +/- 124 (mean +/- SD, n = 15 cell profiles), which was similar to control values of 266 +/- 63 and 212 +/- 109. Thus, the defensin deficiency in SGD is associated with a decrease in size rather than number of peroxidase-positive granules; suggesting that defensins contribute to normal peroxidase-positive granule size and that SGD is a more global granule deficiency than originally thought.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A third chromosome carried the determinant for a nondeletional hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin seen in a Chinese subject, and the fourth was a normal chromosome from a Yugoslavian subject. Twenty-one differences were observed when a comparison was made with the published sequence; no differences were seen between the sequences of the four different samples except for an additional mutation in the Chinese.

A large number of low molecular weight species were measured simultaneously in addition to triglycerides and glycoproteins. Large variations were found between individuals in any one disease group, and there was no measurable correlation between disease state and levels of any low molecular weight component. However, patients with traumatic effusions had high levels of saturated triglycerides, while those with OA had low levels. The chain length of the triglycerides found in OA synovial fluid appears to be shorter than that for the other groups. In RA the composition of triglycerides appears normal, while the overall level is slightly above normal. In a separate study, serial samples of synovial fluid drawn from the knees of two arthritic patients were examined, and the concentrations of glycoprotein, triglycerides and creatinine were found to show a reasonable correlation with each other and with systemic measures of disease activity. These data suggest the potential of synovial fluid triglycerides and creatinine as inflammatory markers.\r"

Fenestrated capillaries appear to be a general feature of synovium, rather than a specific feature of joint tissue.\r"

The results indicate that in inflamed, but not normal joints, a peak of radioactivity is detectable within 9 seconds of injection and suggest that the rate of accumulation of radioactivity over the joint may be a more sensitive indicator of inflammatory activity than measurement at a fixed time. Clearance from the circulation and tissue distribution of the three radioactive preparations were also measured.\r"

The 24-hour creatinine clearance and urinary protein excretion were measured serially for a median period of 6 years. No significant differences were observed in the initial or maximum proteinuria, the duration of the proteinuria or in the initial or latest creatinine clearances between the groups of patients. These results indicate that penicillamine or gold treatment may be continued for short periods under close supervision despite moderate proteinuria without causing permanent renal damage. As several alternative non-nephrotoxic agents are available for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, continued treatment with penicillamine or gold despite proteinuria is seldom indicated.\r"

  ".W": "Between January 1973 and January 1988, 188 patients with unilateral iliac artery occlusion were treated at The Middlesex and University College Hospitals, 185 for primary disease and three for blockage of a previous aortobifemoral graft. In the early part of the series, a variety of operations, including aortofemoral and iliofemoral bypass, and endarteriectomy, was used. Femorofemoral bypass was at first reserved for patients who were considered unfit for major surgery, but the results seemed so good that it was adopted as the procedure of choice. Latterly, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty became available, and the role of this is discussed. Over the 15-year period, 150 patients underwent femorofemoral bypass (all but two receiving a prosthetic graft). Of these, 90 per cent had disabling claudication and 8 per cent had critical ischaemia. There were six early deaths (within 30 days of operation) and five late deaths, and two surviving amputees; nine patients could not be traced. The remaining 128 patients have been assessed at intervals of from 3 to 92 months, both clinically and with Doppler studies. The cumulative patency was 86 per cent at 13 years, and all of these patients experienced subjective and haemodynamic improvement in the recipient limb. Eight grafts occluded in the early postoperative phase. In five patients there was deterioration in the donor limb; it is postulated that the effect was due to causes other than the operation. There were two serious postoperative complications due to technical error, one of which led to early above-knee amputation. These are presented in detail. In the light of this experience, the advantages and indications for femorofemoral bypass and the results to be expected from it have become clarified, and the technique standardized so that errors can be avoided. We suggest that femorofemoral bypass is now the operation of choice for unilateral iliac artery occlusion.\r"

Patients with a positive cardiac history were more likely to have a LVEF of less than or equal to 45 per cent (P less than 0.001). The operative mortality rate was 4 per cent. Each of three patients who died had a LVEF less than or equal to 35 per cent and developed cardiac failure which led to renal failure. Five other patients developed cardiac failure manifested by acute pulmonary oedema during the early postoperative period. There was no statistically significant association between a positive cardiac history and the occurrence of postoperative cardiac failure or death. However, patients with a LVEF of less than or equal to 45 per cent were more likely to develop postoperative cardiac failure (P = 0.004) while patients with a LVEF of less than or equal to 35 per cent had a greater chance of dying (P less than 0.001). No patient died with a LVEF greater than 35 per cent. Preoperative evaluation of LVEF can select patients at high risk of cardiac death from repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm. Such patients could be followed conservatively if they remain asymptomatic and the aneurysm does not enlarge. If operation is considered mandatory, patients with a low LVEF should receive intensive perioperative monitoring with enhancement of ventricular performance.\r"

  ".W": "A study of plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) levels and their relation to changes in arterial pressure was undertaken in 13 patients undergoing open heart surgery. Seven of the patients received high doses of intravenous morphine (1 or 2 mg/kg) as part of their anaesthetic, whereas the other six did not. Increases in the AVP levels during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) were significant in both groups, but were significantly greater in the patients not receiving morphine (median 86.1 fmol/ml) than in those who did (47.5 fmol/ml). In both groups there was a linear correlation between the natural logarithm of the plasma AVP level and the percentage fall in the mean arterial pressure, although the slope of the relationship was significantly less in the group receiving morphine than in the group not receiving morphine. These results indicate that in patients undergoing cardiac surgery the neuroendocrine reflex control of plasma AVP levels in relation to changes in arterial pressure is intact, but that the sensitivity of the reflex (i.e. the increase in plasma AVP level for a given fall in arterial pressure) is reduced by the administration of high doses of intravenous morphine.\r"

Varicose veins had a lower breaking strength and breaking energy than normal veins. Elastic stiffness was less in normals (tan theta = 41 (24] than in varicose veins (tan theta = 55 (18); P less than 0.01). There was no difference in viscoelastic behaviour between samples taken above, at, or below the valve leaflet insertion. In normals, perivalvular vein wall exhibited a 50 per cent lower breaking strength and elastic stiffness than vein from other sites. Collagen content was significantly higher in normal vein specimens in all sites examined (mean collagen content = 70 (21) micrograms/mg, versus 51 (20) micrograms/mg for varicose veins; P less than 0.001). We conclude that significant structural changes are seen in varicose veins. In normal veins, the perivalvular vein wall has distinct viscoelastic features when compared with vein wall from other sites. This difference was not found in veins which became varicose.\r"

  ".W": "A study is described in which the normal toes of 50 patients with unilateral ingrowing toenails were compared with those of 50 healthy subjects matched for age and sex. Twenty-one potential risk factors were compared between the groups. All measurements on patients were derived from unaffected toes in order to avoid anatomical distortion due to the disease process. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences between the groups for three anatomical measures, namely nail fold width (P less than 0.001), medial rotation (eversion) of the great toe (P less than 0.02) and nail thickness (P less than 0.03). Possible discriminating variables were assessed using linear discriminant function analysis and a mathematical equation was derived based on these three factors. This equation was found to possess a potentially high predictive value in that it correctly classified 86 per cent of the patients and 77 per cent of the controls. A further group of 62 unselected patients presenting with unilateral onychocryptosis and 35 unaffected controls were assessed for these three parameters. Of these, 80 per cent of controls and 85 per cent of patients could be classified correctly by the equation. It is thus proposed that, in the majority of subjects with onychocryptosis, a discrete anatomical predisposition exists and that the other factors act only as triggers in the development of the condition. This study provides a rationale for less traumatic surgical approaches to ingrown nail than nail avulsion, with or without nail bed ablation and may also provide a means of identifying high-risk groups.\r"

Examination revealed anatomical problems such as: recurrent fistula (two), massive urethral diverticulum (one), absent vagina (one), and a missed urogenital sinus (one). Preliminary electromyography showed the external sphincter to be displaced from the anus in nine patients. Posterior sagittal anorectoplasty, with correction of anatomical defects and precise reconstruction of bowel within the sphincters, was carried out after the formation of a loop colostomy. No postoperative complications were observed. Contrast studies confirmed healed suture lines before stoma closure. Follow-up, between 4 and 46 months, revealed good faecal control in only two patients, with a significant improvement in two others. The rest remained incontinent although sensation was improved. These disappointing results, at variance with other published reports, lead us to conclude that posterior sagittal anorectoplasty, when used as a secondary procedure, is good for correcting anatomical defects but not for improving faecal continence.\r"

We studied eight patients and carried out immunohistochemical studies to determine whether particular functional profiles might be indicators of a malignant association. One patient presented with synchronous carcinoma and two developed carcinomas 3 and 10 years after excision of Paget's disease. Five patients underwent wide local excision and have not developed cancer (median follow-up 6 years, range 5-13 years). However, four patients developed recurrent Paget's disease. Immunohistochemical studies showed that in general Paget cells stained positively with CAM 5.2 (a cytokeratin marker), gross cystic disease fluid protein (a marker for apocrine cells), human milk fat globule glycoprotein (HMFG 1 and 2) and carcinoembryonic antigen but negatively for PR3A5 (a marker for colonic goblet cells). Three cases had a staining profile which was quite different from that usually observed and these were associated with malignancy. One showed an antigenic profile more typical of a large bowel carcinoma. Paget's disease of the anus appears to run one of two clinical courses: to develop malignancy; or to recur locally, often on repeated occasions. Wide local excision is the treatment of choice but long-term follow-up is necessary because of the cancer risk. An immunohistochemical staining pattern which is different from usual may indicate a higher malignant risk and/or identify some cases of Paget's disease as representing a downward 'pagetoid' extension from a anorectal adenocarcinoma rather than a true epidermotropic apocrine neoplasm of the perianal skin.\r"

The prolapse was successfully controlled in all cases and six of nine patients were rendered continent. Physiological studies in patients were compared with age- and sex-matched controls. Preoperative anal pressures were significantly lower than in controls at rest (R), during maximum pelvic floor contraction (Sq) and attempted defaecation (St) (R, P less than 0.005; Sq, P less than 0.005; St, P less than 0.005). Anorectal angles were significantly more obtuse in patients than in controls (R, P less than 0.05; St, P less than 0.025). None of these parameters changed significantly after abdominal rectopexy. Median rectal emptying significantly decreased after operation (preoperative 83 per cent/min; postoperative, 58 per cent/min, P less than 0.05). Median perineal descent during attempted defaecation also significantly decreased after operation (preoperative, 8.5 cm; postoperative, 7.1 cm; P less than 0.025). Parameters which predicted return of continence included: delayed leakage during the saline infusion test (P less than 0.025), a narrow anorectal angle during pelvic floor contraction (P less than 0.025), minimal pelvic floor descent during contraction (P less than 0.05), and a long anal canal at rest (P less than 0.05) and during pelvic floor contraction (P less than 0.025).\r"

The median 95 per cent confidence interval for length of the pressure zone was 4 mm; for resting pressure it was 15 mmHg and for squeeze pressure it was 48 mmHg. Day-to-day variation did not exceed the intraindividual variation. Constant recording with the catheter fixed in the high pressure zone revealed slow waves and ultraslow waves with amplitudes of 6-24 mmHg which could account for most of the intraindividual variation. No sex difference was found in the length of the high pressure zone whereas resting pressure and squeeze pressure were higher in men than in women. Although a tendency towards a decrease in the length of the high pressure zone, resting pressure and squeeze pressure was observed with increasing age, no significant age-related difference could be demonstrated.\r"

A good correlation was found for all three parameters (Spearman correlation coefficient rs: sphincter length = 0.86, MRP = 0.86 and MVC = 0.94, P less than 0.001). Repeat studies in 15 patients showed excellent reproducibility (rs: sphincter length = 0.97, MRP = 0.96 and MVC = 0.97, P less than 0.001). Air-filled microballoon manometry gives results similar to a water-filled microballoon system and has many advantages.\r"

The functional results of 48 patients with W reservoirs was assessed. The mean number of evacuations per 24 h (+/- s.d.) was 3.8 +/- 0.2. Sixty-five per cent of patients did not evacuate at all, or rarely, at night and none evacuated more than once at night. Forty-four per cent of patients took antidiarrhoeal agents. Continence was normal in 50 per cent of patients. Minor leakage occurred in 46 per cent of cases, frequent leakage in 4 per cent and incontinence in none. Sexual function in 29 men was normal.

This study analyses our experience with 206 cases of thyroid cancer from an endemic goiterous area. There were 100 males and 106 females; patients presented at an earlier age with a short history. Thyroid cancers demonstrated an aggressive biological behaviour with an advanced stage at presentation (overt cancers in 51 per cent) and a relentless course with a mortality rate of 24.2 per cent for the well-differentiated tumours. Near-total thyroidectomy was performed in 126 patients. Multicentric foci of tumour were seen in 17.2 per cent of the well-differentiated cancers and 25.2 per cent of the cases of well-differentiated cancers who underwent near-total thyroidectomy developed loco-regional recurrence. Hemithyroidectomy was performed in 35 patients who refused completion total thyroidectomy at a second stage; 16.7 per cent of these patients developed a recurrence in the remaining contralateral lobe. Thus in our patients from an endemic goiterous area, near-total thyroidectomy is the treatment of choice particularly because of the frequent occurrence of follicular and anaplastic cancers (in 44.2 per cent) and because the course of the disease is more virulent.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between location and extent of lesion on CT scan and limitation in spontaneous speech was examined. The severity of spontaneous speech ranged from cases with no speech or only verbal stereotypies (first major group) to those with reduced, hesitant, poorly articulated, agrammatic speech (nonfluent Broca's aphasia, second major group). CT scan analysis revealed no single neuroanatomical area that contained an extensive lesion which could be used to discriminate the most severe cases from the least severe. The two groups were separable, however, on the basis of the CT scan when the extent of the lesion in two subcortical white matter areas were combined: (1) the most medial and rostral portion of the subcallosal fasciculus plus (2) the periventricular white matter near the body of the lateral ventricle, deep to the lower motor/sensory cortex area for the mouth. The most rostral portion of the medial subcallosal fasciculus, located in the lateral angle of the frontal horn (extremely deep to Broca's area), contains projections from the cingulate gyrus (area 24) and the supplementary motor area, to the caudate nucleus. We suggest that one explanation for the more severe limitation in spontaneous speech in the first group is the extensive white matter lesion in these two subcortical pathways had interrupted a large number of connections for (1) initiation and preparation of speech movements, and limbic aspects of speech (lesions in the medial subcallosal fasciculus), and (2) motor execution and sensory feedback for spontaneous speech (lesions in periventricular white matter deep to the motor/sensory cortex area for the mouth). Extensive lesion in only one of these two white matter pathway areas, alone was not sufficient to produce long-lasting severe limitation in spontaneous speech and could not be used to discriminate the two groups on the basis of the CT scans. The patients with less severe limitation in spontaneous speech (nonfluent Broca's aphasia) had less extensive lesion within these two white matter areas combined, and had interrupted a smaller number of these subcortical connections. The sites of the lesions in subcortical white matter in CT scans in Broca's original case who could only produce a verbal stereotypy are similar to those in our first group with the most severe limitation in spontaneous speech. The presence or absence of hemiplegia was not related to severity or recovery of spontaneous speech. Careful examination of lesion extent in these two areas of subcortical white matter on CT scanning appears to be relevant in predicting potential for recovery of spontaneous speech in some stroke patients.\r"

In contrast, subjects with mixed cerebral dominance for language/handedness exhibited no left/right difference in the incidence of eye deviation. The results are consistent with right cerebral dominance for attentional/intentional mechanisms directed at external space. Further analysis suggests that the cerebral asymmetry for gaze may be due to an evolutionary loss of attentional/intentional mechanisms by the left cerebral hemisphere as language function developed.\r"

  ".W": "After unilateral cerebral hemisphere stroke, resulting in contralateral arm symptoms but largely sparing higher cerebral function, ipsilateral arm function is generally considered to be unaffected. In this study, 8 subjects with acute unilateral cerebral infarction (confirmed by CT scan) and primarily motor deficits underwent 11 computerized and 6 clinical assessments between 11 days and 12 months poststroke, and were compared with 12 normal subjects. Computerized tests comprised 3 pursuit tracking tasks (preview-random, step and a combination of these), designed to measure different aspects of integrated sensory-motor (S-M) function, and 12 tasks aimed at breaking tracking into various sensory, perceptual and motor components (joint movement sense, visual resolution, object perception, static and dynamic visuospatial perception, range of movement, grip and arm strength, reaction time, speed, static and dynamic steadiness). The asymptomatic arm was impaired on all but one of the computerized tests throughout the 12-month period, although to a lesser degree than the symptomatic arm. Grip strength was marginally impaired initially. Incomplete neurological recovery was seen in the asymptomatic arm for all functions except strength, speed and steadiness, possibly indicating their resistance to improvement. Clinical assessment detected no asymptomatic arm impairment and only a mild transient deficit of higher mental function. Our data suggest that (1) all cerebral hemisphere areas involved in S-M functions can exert some degree of bilateral motor control; (2) ipsilateral influence is never greater than contralateral influence, and is usually considerably less; and (3) the proportion of ipsilateral to contralateral control is closely related to the degree of continuous sensory feedback required by the particular task. The mechanism and degree of ipsilateral dysfunction can be explained by a 3-tier cerebral model of S-M integration comprising a lower level of functions with high contralateral specificity (somatosensory and motor), a middle level of non-limb-specific partially lateralized functions (ideomotor praxis and visuospatial perception) and an upper level of global mental activities (intellect, alertness, etc.).\r"

  ".W": "The outcome of multiple sclerosis (MS), assessed according to the Kurtzke Disability Status Scale (DSS), was reviewed in 1,099 consecutive patients followed in London, Canada, between 1972 and 1984. A geographically based subgroup of 196 patients representing 90% of Middlesex County MS patients as well as a group of 197 patients seen from onset of disease were separately analysed. The clinical course was progressive from onset in 33% of the total population and in 28% of the Middlesex County subgroup. Of those with duration of 6-10 yrs, 30-40% with initially remitting disease developed progressive MS. The cross-sectional distribution of disability was bimodal with peaks at DSS 1 (no disability) and DSS 6 (assistance required for walking). Actuarial analysis showed that the median time to reach DSS 6 from onset of MS was 14.97 +/- 0.31 yrs in the total population and 9.42 +/- 0.44 yrs in the \"seen from onset' subgroup. Survival was minimally altered; 87% of patients followed up to 40 yrs were still alive, although ascertainment of cases with this duration of MS was incomplete. Data describing the rate at which disability develops after the onset of a progressive phase of MS are also presented. The implications of these data in planning and interpretation of clinical therapeutic trials are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Prolonged high-frequency stimulation of cutaneous nerves can result in paraesthesiae that begin 20 to 30 s after the end of the train and last for 5 to 10 min. In the present experiments the effects of such stimulation on the excitability of human cutaneous afferents and on their refractory and supernormal periods were measured to determine whether these changes could explain the postactivation paraesthesiae. Attention was focused on the axons of lowest threshold (1.0-1.5 T) in the compound sensory action potential evoked by stimulating the digital nerves of the index or middle fingers. Repetitive activation produced two opposing effects on the excitability of low-threshold cutaneous afferents. Following stimulus trains of short duration (1-5 min) the dominant effect was a long-lasting decrease in excitability, such that the amplitude of a test afferent volley was always less than before stimulation. With these trains, no subject experienced paraesthesiae. For 10 min after stimulus trains lasting longer than 7 to 12 min the dominant effect was an increase in excitability such that the amplitude of the test volley was greater than before stimulation. Within this interval, following such trains, subjects experienced paraesthesiae. The extent and duration of supernormality induced by a supramaximal conditioning stimulus were greatly increased by stimulation for 1 min. Following stimulation for 10 min, the degree of supernormality of the enhanced test volley was much the same as before stimulation, but was inappropriately high for the size of the test volley. The sum total of the excitability change and the change in supernormality resulted in a larger potential after stimulation, whether the train lasted 1 min or 10 min. It is concluded that the postactivation changes in axonal excitability could predispose the most excitable axons to generate ectopic impulses and, thereby, to produce paraesthesiae.\r"

  ".U": "89135478\r", 
  ".W": "A new psychoacoustic pattern discrimination test (PPDT) has been validated for the diagnosis of telencephalic hearing disorders. In this test, regular sequences of noise bursts or click trains are presented dichotically, and randomly occurring monaural changes in intensity or click pattern have to be discriminated. The PPDT was administered to 48 control subjects and to 62 patients with circumscribed cerebrovascular lesions. Involvement of telencephalic auditory structures (TAS) was assessed from CT scans. Abnormality in the PPDT was highly correlated with the incidence of a TAS lesion. The most prominent abnormality consisted of an increased error rate (missed discriminations) on the ear contralateral to the TAS lesion, comparable to the ear effect described for former dichotic tests. In normals, no ear dominance, which might have confounded the interpretation of lesion effects in patients, was observed for our test material. Also, the influence of peripheral hearing loss on test results was small. Criteria for the clinical evaluation of the PPDT were developed and yielded a good sensitivity (76.1%) when related to the CT scan data. Abnormality in the PPDT was also confirmed by reduced auditory evoked dipole source potentials in the lesioned hemisphere. Disturbances in auditory language comprehension in aphasic patients were not significantly related to a positive PPDT result, but a questionnaire about hearing difficulties revealed a close association of PPDT abnormality and auditory perceptual disturbances. These occurred only in difficult hearing environments, for example, the cocktail party situation. It must be concluded that unilateral TAS lesions lead to auditory perceptual impairment and communication problems, which should be given adequate attention during neuropsychological rehabilitation.\r"

Sciatic nerve sheath in vitro biosynthesis of 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha (6KPGF1 alpha; the stable metabolite of prostacyclin) was significantly reduced but not in acute experimental diabetes. Nerves with reduced 6KPGF1 alpha had an excessive response to arachidonic acid stimulation. We suggest that the reduced endogenous biosynthesis of prostacyclin is due to reduced substrate availability, possibly due to the reduced noradrenaline. The implications of these findings on the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy are discussed. Neuropathy was found to involve all fibre populations studied (motor, sensory and sympathetic) and progressed with duration of diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "A clinicopathological study on X-linked recessive bulbospinal neuronopathy was undertaken on 9 cases, with morphological observations on 3 autopsied cases and sural nerve biopsies from 6 patients. Both lower motor and primary sensory neurons were involved. Lower motor neurons were markedly depleted through all spinal segments and in brainstem motor nuclei except for the third, fourth and sixth cranial nerves. Primary sensory neurons were less severely affected. A quantitative study of primary sensory axons at several levels in the peripheral nervous system suggested that a distally accentuated axonopathy was the salient pathological process. Segmental demyelination and remyelination clustered on individual fibres, and g ratios (axon diameter: total fibre diameter) in the sural nerve showed an increased scatter in some cases. Evidence of regeneration was inconspicuous. Unmyelinated fibres were well preserved throughout all the nerves examined. Neurons in the Onufrowicz nuclei, in the intermediolateral columns and in Clarke's columns of the spinal cord were generally well preserved. These observations indicate that a lower motor and primary sensory neuronopathy is a major neurological manifestation in this disease.\r"

  ".W": "The average Bereitschaftspotential (BP) preceding a rapid, self-paced voluntary extension movement of the index finger was recorded from 6 scalp locations in 14 patients with Parkinson's disease who had been withdrawn from their normal drug therapy for at least 12 h before testing. The amplitude of the potential was measured at the peak negativity (N1) and 650 ms prior to this (NS1), and compared with that recorded in a group of 12 age-matched control subjects. The N1 amplitude was the same as in the normals, but the NS1 component was smaller in the patients, especially in midline leads. As a result, the rise in the BP between the peak NS1 and N1 component (termed NS2) was larger in the patient group. The NS1 component of the BP is thought to reflect preparatory activity in the supplementary motor area (SMA) of cortex. Since the basal ganglia provide a major source of afferent input to SMA, the reduction in NS1 in the patients probably results from inadequate basal ganglia activation of SMA. The larger NS2 component may reflect extra activity in other brain areas to compensate for the reduced SMA activity.\r"

Neuropathology was variable, ranging from rare isolated CMV inclusions in brain without associated inflammation or necrosis, to severe necrotizing ependymitis and meningoencephalitis. In 1 patient, CMV had produced a necrotizing meningoradiculitis which presented clinically as ascending paralysis. In the brains and spinal cords of 6 patients, evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of neural parenchyma was seen in close proximity to CMV infection. Both viruses individually or together were associated with low grade (microglial nodule) encephalitis. In retrospect, the diagnosis of CMV had been a difficult one to make clinically in neurologically impaired patients with AIDS. The results suggest that CMV may also localize in the nervous system without significant clinical sequelae. Imaging studies and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid revealed abnormalities in many patients, but none of them (short of culture of CMV itself in two cases) appeared to be specific to this neurological complication of the immunodeficiency.\r"

  ".W": "The patterns of electromyographic (EMG) activity in spastic-paretic and contralateral elbow muscles of 10 hemiparetic human subjects were compared during a sequence of graded voluntary isometric contractions against 4 different-sized loads. These loads were orientated successively at 8 different angles over a 360 degree range, referenced to a plane at the wrist orthogonal to the long axis of the forearm. Comparisons of EMG activity recorded from normal and paretic limbs revealed that there were marked differences in the torque angles which evoked significant EMG activity, in the angular range of EMG, in the angle of peak EMG, and in the scaling of EMG magnitude with increasing isometric loads. In severely impaired limbs, there was a marked shift in both the peak EMG angle and the angular domain of EMG activity for both biceps and triceps muscle groups, away from the normal elbow flexion-extension axis towards external humeral rotation and shoulder girdle elevation. The extent of the disturbance in the spatial patterns of EMG activity was closely correlated with the clinical severity of the spastic-paretic disability, which was quantified using a functional scale patterned after that described by Fugl Meyer et al. (1975). The observed patterns of EMG activity in paretic flexor muscles do not conform with established synergistic patterns, such as might be released by excitation of the flexor reflex in a normal limb. Possible origins for the anomalous EMG patterns are discussed.\r"

Fifteen of the patients complained of symptoms suggestive of GER: radiologic investigation of the upper gastrointestinal tract revealed hiatus hernia and GER in four, hiatus hernia alone in three, GER alone in two, decreased esophageal peristalsis in one and normal findings in four. Fibreoptic bronchoscopy in the four former smokers and one nonsmoker showed diffuse mucosal erythema. A chest x-ray film in one patient showed an infiltrate at the base of the right lung; transbronchial biopsy revealed vegetable material, which confirmed pulmonary aspiration. A 3-month course of medical antireflux treatment (dietary and lifestyle changes, elevation of the head of the bed and administration of cimetidine, antacid and metoclopramide) relieved the chronic cough in 14 of the 20 patients. Of the remaining patients one was lost to follow-up and five had GER confirmed by means of esophagoscopy, esophageal motility testing and long-term intraesophageal pH monitoring; four of the five patients underwent fundoplication and were asymptomatic 3 months after surgery. Antireflux therapy should be considered in patients with chronic cough when other causes have been ruled out, even if there are no GER symptoms. If the treatment fails, full investigation for GER is recommended; if GER is confirmed, surgery should be considered.\r"

Twenty-one patients ranging in age from 60 to 81 years (median, 66 years) were treated using either a 4- or 5-day course of high-dose cytosine arabinoside, 3 g/m2 intravenously (IV) every 12 hours; followed by daunorubicin, 45 mg/m2/d IV bolus for 3 consecutive days. Thirteen patients were entered at the first dose level (a 4-day course or eight doses of cytosine arabinoside), whereas eight patients underwent therapy at the second dose level (a 5-day course or ten doses). Patients who achieved a complete remission received a repeat course of high-dose cytosine arabinoside and daunorubicin within 4 weeks of attaining remission. Seven patients had an antecedant history of a myelodysplastic syndrome. Infection was the major complication experienced by this elderly patient group, and included ten episodes of bacteremia or fungemia (four of which were fatal) and five cases of pneumonia (one fatality). Nine of the 21 patients (three of 13 at the first dose level and six of eight at the second dose level) achieved a complete remission. Median remission duration was 9 months (range, 4-19+ months). Although high-dose cytosine arabinoside plus daunorubicin was an effective antileukemic therapy, it is too toxic to recommend for most elderly leukemic patients.\r"

  ".W": "The toxicity of MOPP chemotherapy, including nausea, vomiting, hair loss, and neuropathy, can limit patient compliance. Alternative regimens employing oral alkylating agents and vinblastine have been designed to ameliorate these toxicities. The authors reviewed their experience in 24 patients with advanced-stage Hodgkin's disease who were treated with chlorambucil, vinblastine, procarbazine, and prednisone (ChlVPP). Complete responses were obtained in 92% (11/12) of previously untreated patients and in 92% (11/12) of patients who relapsed after radiation (10/10) or chemotherapy (one of two). Overall, relapse-free survival is 82% with a median duration of follow-up of 5.5 years. Toxicity was minimal with myelosuppression being the dose-limiting toxicity. Severe nausea and vomiting occurred in only two patients and was considered secondary to procarbazine. Mild nausea occurred in six other patients. Minimal alopecia was seen in three patients and only two patients developed a mild peripheral neuropathy. The authors conclude that ChlVPP appears as effective as MOPP chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease in comparable presentations but is a less toxic regimen. Thus, it may be useful in situations where poor compliance and patient acceptance may compromise optimal dose and frequency of drug administration.\r"

  ".W": "Because of reported synergism between 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin (CDDP) in L1210 leukemic mice and activity of this combination in clinical studies, a trial was initiated in previously untreated patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma. Cisplatin at 20 mg/m2 and 5-FU as a continuous infusion at 1000 mg/m2 were both administered for 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks. Forty-one patients were treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and 46 were treated by the Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) physicians. A 50% reduction in measurable disease was seen in 12 of 35 (34%) MSKCC patients and in nine of 41 (22%) of the CCOP patients with 95% confidence intervals of 0.18 to 0.50 and 0.10 to 0.35 in the two groups, respectively. The predominant toxicities were as follows: nausea and vomiting, 32%; mucositis, 26%; leukocyte counts less than 2000 cells/mm3, 17%; platelet counts less than 25,000 cells/mm3, 8%; and severe neurotoxicity, 5%. Dose attenuation was similar in the two groups. The median survival was 16.4 months for the MSKCC group and 9.6 months for the CCOP group (P = 0.0003). Although the baseline characteristics (age, sex, performance status, and baseline lactic dehydrogenase [LDH] and alkaline phosphatase) were similar, on further examination differences between the two groups were evident. In the MSKCC group, 14% of patients with liver metastases had greater than 50% of their liver involved with tumor whereas this occurred in 41% of the CCOP group (P = 0.03). The LDH values greater than 500 U/l were observed in 10% of patients in the MSKCC group and in 37% of the patients in the CCOP group (P = 0.007). Characteristics which reflect the bulk of disease, such as the percent of liver involvement, need to be analyzed in order to evaluate purported survival differences in randomized and nonrandomized trials of colorectal carcinoma.\r"

Fifty-one patients received the standard cytotoxic chemotherapy and 49 received tamoxifen as well. No significant difference in overall or progression-free survival between these two patient groups was observed. Cytosol steroid receptor determinations were performed on tumor samples from 72 patients. No correlation was evident between therapy and cytosol estrogen and progestin receptor content of the tumors.

Pirarubicin was given intravenously at the rate of 5 mg per minute, at doses ranging from 35 to 70 mg/m2 once every 21 days. On clinical evaluation, one patient had complete response lasting 4 months. On second-look laparotomy residual tumor was found and she was labelled a partial responder and changed to alternate chemotherapy. Another patient had a partial response of recurrent chest wall tumors lasting 11 months. A third patient had a partial response lasting 4+ months of a pleural-based tumor and resolution of pleural effusion. After the fifth course of chemotherapy, he developed severe granulocytopenia, pseudomonas sepsis, shock, and renal failure. Despite recovery of blood counts to normal within 3 days, renal failure proved fatal. Autopsy revealed only fibrosis and no gross or microscopic evidence of malignant mesothelioma. A fourth patient had improvement in evaluable disease lasting about 4 months; and the remaining four had stable disease for at least 2 months each. The authors conclude that, whenever feasible, noninvasive clinical assessment of tumor response should be supplemented by surgical-pathologic evaluation. Pirarubicin is active in malignant mesothelioma. This is the first report documenting complete tumor eradication after chemotherapy in an adult with malignant mesothelioma.\r"

Six patients demonstrated complete response (CR) of the intracranial masses at the time of repeat computed tomography (CT) scan, whereas one attained a partial response (PR). Two of the CR patients died of multiple opportunistic infections, two experienced relapse of lymphoma, and died at 7 and 16 months from diagnosis, and two were alive without evidence of disease at 8 and 14 months from diagnosis. The median survival of the whole group was 5.5 months (range, 2 to 16 months). Patients with AIDS-related primary CNS lymphoma may respond to radiation treatment; however, response duration is usually short, and survival is influenced by refractory disease or systemic opportunistic infections.\r"

Radiation-induced cellular changes of which nuclear atypia was most pronounced. The tumor invasion pattern remained unchanged but the number of mitoses decreased. The lymphocytic infiltration increased at the beginning of the therapy (from 10-30 Gy) but decreased at the end of radiotherapy. The amount of neutrofils and the keratinization pattern remained almost unchanged at the light microscopic level, but intracellular filaments and desmosomes slightly increased in electron microscopic study. The changes in nuclear morphologic features pointing in a more undifferentiated direction are considered to be due to cell damage rather than to the more aggressive behavior of the tumor cells. This is in agreement with the decrease of mitoses which is due to radiation-induced arrest of tumor cells to the G2 phase. These changes might be related to the disappearance of tumors during irradiation. The leukocyte compartment seen in the samples might take part in the destruction of the tumor cells and in the removal of the cell debris.\r"

Serum NSE decreased and increased paralleling tumor regression and progression, respectively, except when brain metastases were present. Alterations of s-TK, in contrast, did not usually mirror the course of disease. During initial chemotherapy (CT) a transitory increase of serum levels was observed for both NSE and TK. Monitoring, based on daily blood samples, showed comparable peaks only for s-TK during the following CT cycles, whereas s-NSE was within the normal range even when tumor mass was still present. Those subsequent s-TK peaks under CT may be due to tumor cell lysis as a result of CT indicating the efficacy of treatment by this way. Rapidly proliferating tissues such as bone marrow or bowel mucosa, however, have also to be considered as possible sources of s-TK.\r"

The authors studied retrospectively if this NS grading has an independent prognostic value in 90 NS patients, diagnosed in ten hospitals in the southeastern part of the Netherlands (1972-1983). In this study there is no significant difference in sex, age, B-symptoms, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), stage, positive laparotomy, involvement of mediastinum or spleen, lymphocyte count, and percentage of complete remissions between the NS subgroups. Multivariate analysis suggests that the subclassification of NS in Grades 1 and 2 is a prognostic factor in survival independent of age, stage and ESR. This finding and the high relative frequency of NS makes application of this NS subdivision probably clinically useful to identify patients for a risk-adapted therapy.\r"

Its main importance is its distinction from angiosarcoma; however, the clinicopathologic spectrum of PHMS remains incompletely described. We report two new cases and describe our findings in 200 consecutive breast specimens evaluated for the presence of PHMS. The first patient presented with peau-de-orange change in the overlying breast skin, thus mimicking inflammatory breast carcinoma. Furthermore, this patient's PHMS lesion had been diagnosed and treated inappropriately as a low-grade angiosarcoma. The second case showed the more typical, fibroadenoma-like presentation of PHMS. In addition, PHMS changes occur commonly in routine breast biopsy specimens. In fact, our review of 200 consecutive breast specimens showed PHMS in at least one microscopic focus in 23% of cases. The PHMS changes occurred in younger patients than the control population and were associated with fibrocystic changes, in fibroadenomas, in gynecomastia, in normal breast tissue, and in sclerosing lobular hyperplasia. Ultrastructural and immunohistochemical studies of one case showed that the capillary-like spaces were either acellular or lined by fibroblasts. Pseudoangiomatous hyperplasia of mammary stroma represents a clinicopathologic spectrum, extending from focal, insignificant microscopic changes to cases where PHMS produces a breast mass. Increased awareness of PHMS and its clinicopathologic spectrum will allow its differentiation from other vascular tumors of the breast, especially low-grade angiosarcoma.\r"

Recently DNA ploidy pattern, as detected by DNA flow cytometry has also been shown to be predictive. In this study DNA flow cytometry was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue from 50 patients with Stage I renal cell carcinoma for whom long-term follow-up data were available. Two were eliminated for technical reasons. Of the 48 evaluable tumors, 25 (52%) were diploid, 19 (40%) were nondiploid, and in four, (8%) the ploidy was uncertain. The ploidy pattern was statistically significantly associated with nuclear grade (P less than 0.02), and primary tumor size (P less than 0.05) but did not correlate with cell type, microscopic growth pattern, or the presence or absence of mitotic activity. In the group as a whole, ten patients (21%) died of renal cell carcinoma, seven of 19 (37%) with nondiploid tumor patterns, and two of 25 (8%) with a diploid pattern (P less than 0.03). One of four patients (25%) with tumors of uncertain ploidy also died. However, only two factors, nuclear grade and primary tumor size, were independent predictors of outcome. For Stage I renal cell carcinoma, ploidy can significantly predict patient outcome and correlates with nuclear grade and tumor size, but is not an independent predictive variable.\r"

In the current study, a retrospective study was performed to compare the relationship between the quantity of five major gangliosides of human melanoma (GM3, GM2, GD3, GD2, and alkali-labile ganglioside) and nine clinical factors (sex, age, site, stage, tumor size, pigmentation, histopathologic type of primary tumor, chemosensitivity, and prognosis). Melanoma specimens studied were obtained from patients of our clinic and included 52 biopsy specimens and 28 cultured cell lines. Analysis of melanoma biopsy specimens have shown a differential ganglioside expression among different sites of tumor, pigmentation, and histopathologic types. Results of cultured melanoma cell lines differed from those of biopsy specimens, but ganglioside expression also differed among the site of tumor, tumor size, histopathologic types, and chemosensitivity. GM3 positively correlated with a good prognosis in both biopsy and cultured melanomas.\r"

The relapse was treated with pulse doses of prednisone alone with complete resolution of his polyneuropathy and skin changes. This was accompanied by a fall in his IgA levels and improvement of his polycythemia.\r"

Twenty-seven patients with familial MTC were diagnosed from clinical symptoms and 36 by screening. In both the sporadic group and the symptomatic familial group, approximately 80% of the patients had palpable thyroid tumors. Lymph node metastases were present in 44% of the sporadic group and in 37% of the group with symptomatic familial MTC, and distant metastases in approximately 20% of the patients in each of these groups. The patients detected by screening differed significantly from the two groups of symptomatic cases by having a lower frequency of palpable thyroid lesions (50%), smaller tumors, and lower frequencies of cervical lymph node metastases (14%) and distant metastases (0%). Multivariate analyses revealed no significant differences between sporadic cases and symptomatic familial cases regarding tumor size or stage. Large tumors (greater than 3 cm) were more frequently accompanied by palpable cervical lymph nodes and were associated with an approximately four times higher risk of distant metastases than tumors smaller than 1 cm. Women had significantly smaller tumors and a more favorable stage distribution than age-related men.\r"

For this review, the diagnosis of IBC was made on the basis of either clinical or histopathologic criteria. Fifteen factors of potential prognostic significance were evaluated, by both univariate and multivariate analysis. For relapse-free survival, univariate analysis suggested prognostic value for initial tumor size, discrete versus diffuse tumor mass, adjuvant chemotherapy, and mastectomy. In the multivariate analysis, the independent prognostic factors, in order of significance, were mastectomy, diffuse versus discrete tumor mass, and race (marginal). For survival, univariate analysis suggested prognostic value for initial tumor size, diffuse versus discrete tumor mass, nodal stage, year of treatment, adjuvant chemotherapy, and mastectomy. In the multivariate analysis, the prognostic factors in order of significance were mastectomy and chemotherapy (marginal). The diagnostic selection group showed no prognostic value, suggesting that either clinical or histopathologic criteria justify the diagnosis of IBC. Our results appear to support a role for surgery as part of the combined modality approach to this disease.\r"

  ".U": "89136138\r", 
  ".W": "The androgenic steroid hormone testosterone induced an early (less than 30-60 seconds) stimulation of endocytosis, hexose transport, and amino acid transport, monitored by the temperature-sensitive uptake of horseradish peroxidase, 2-deoxyglucose, and alpha-aminoisobutyrate, respectively, in rat ventricle cubes and acutely isolated ventricular myocytes. This stimulation was time- and concentration-dependent and was maximal at 10(-9) to 10(-8) M testosterone, consistent with androgen-receptor mediation. EGTA (2.5 mM), La3+ (1 mM), and verapamil (100 microM) ablated the hormonal response. The calcium ionophore A23187 (10 microM) induced an acute stimulation of endocytosis, amino acid transport, and hexose transport which was not further increased by testosterone (10(-8) M), suggesting a common effector pathway. Testosterone (10(-8) M) also evoked a rapid (less than 30 seconds) stimulation of 45Ca influx and efflux. Testosterone (10(-8) M) induced a rapid (less than 5 seconds) transient increase in ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity peaking (twofold to threefold) at 60 seconds, and an early (15 seconds) transient accumulation of polyamines peaking at 60 seconds in isolated myocytes. The specific, irreversible ODC inhibitor alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO, 5-10 mM) blocked the testosterone-evoked increase in ODC activity and polyamine levels and the stimulation of Ca2+ fluxes, endocytosis, hexose transport, and amino acid transport. Putrescine (0.5-1 mM), the ODC product, reversed DFMO inhibition and restored the increase in polyamines, 45Ca fluxes, and Ca2+-dependent membrane transport processes. These results demonstrate that rapid, transient ODC-regulated polyamine synthesis is essential for androgenic stimulation of Ca2+ fluxes and membrane transport processes in ventricular myocytes. These findings support a model for signal transduction in which newly synthesized polyamines serve as intracellular messengers to regulate transmembrane Ca2+ movements, Ca2+-dependent membrane transport functions, and other Ca2+- and polyamine-sensitive processes in cardiac myocytes.\r"

This system permitted real-time monitoring of the area enclosed by the edges of valve leaflets and by the juncture of the valve leaflet and the cardiac wall in situ, without artificial constraint to the valve motion. Right atrial and right ventricular pressures were measured with two catheter-tipped micromanometers. During control state, tricuspid valve orifice area (TOA) increased up to its peak [1.38 +/- 0.26 cm2 (mean +/- SD)] coincidently with either atrial systole or rapid ventricular filling. Atrial contraction evoked distinct presystolic tricuspid anulus narrowing with concomitant slow TOA reduction. This slow TOA reduction began 30.0 +/- 16.1 msec before systolic atrioventricular pressure crossover, and the following rapid TOA decrease was completed 38.7 +/- 12.2 msec after systolic atrioventricular pressure crossover. TOA began to increase 48.4 +/- 30.4 msec before diastolic atrioventricular pressure crossover at the end portion of the isovolumic relaxation phase, opposing residual transvalvular pressure gradient (3.33 +/- 1.79 mm Hg). The slow presystolic TOA decrease was considered to be a reflection of the presystolic anulus narrowing caused by atrial systole. An isolated atrial contraction induced by administering 1 mg acetylcholine chloride into the atrioventricular node artery or by vagus nerve stimulation could produce complete valve closure. Even in an isolated atrial contraction, the inflection point that marks the boundary between slow \"atriogenic\" closure presumably due to anulus narrowing and rapid closure presumably due to hemodynamic force was easily identified.\r"

Effective refractory periods (ERP) basal and apical to MI were determined in the baseline state and during neural stimulation before and after preconditioning occlusions and 20, 60, 120, and 180 minutes after sustained occlusion by ligature ligation of diagonal branches of the left anterior descending coronary artery. In 10 control dogs with transmural MI, ERP shortening induced by bilateral ansae subclaviae stimulation (4-msec pulses, 2-4 Hz and 2-4 mA) was unchanged at basal sites but was attenuated at apical sites. Four of 40 apical test sites exhibited efferent sympathetic denervation (less than or equal to 2 msec shortening) 20 minutes after sustained occlusion. Thirteen of 40 apical sites became denervated during a 3-hour period. In 10 preconditioned dogs, ERP shortening at apical sites was unchanged after preconditioning occlusions and during the first 60 minutes of sustained ischemia but was attenuated at 120 minutes. Three of 40 apical test sites became denervated during a 3-hour period. The cumulative percentage of denervated apical test sites was significantly less in the preconditioned group compared with the control group (p = 0.006) despite a comparable degree of subepicardial involvement in the MI (8.2 +/- 1.0% vs. 8.4 +/- 1.4%, the ratio to the left ventricular circumference, mean +/- SEM). In 11 control dogs tested for efferent vagal response after MI, ERP prolongation induced by bilateral vagal stimulation (4-msec pulses, 20 Hz with current strength 0.05 mA greater than that required to produce asystole) was unchanged at basal sites, but was attenuated at apical sites, and five of 44 test sites exhibited denervation (less than or equal to 1 msec prolongation) 20 minutes after sustained coronary occlusion. Fourteen of 40 apical sites became denervated during a 3-hour period. In 10 preconditioned dogs, vagally induced ERP prolongation was unchanged both at basal and apical sites, and none of 36 apical test sites exhibited denervation after preconditioning and during a 3-hour period of sustained coronary occlusion (p less than 0.001 vs. control group) despite a comparable degree of subendocardial involvement in the MI (11.8 +/- 0.8% vs. 11.9 +/- 1.3%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89136141\r", 
  ".W": "A model of one-dimensional action potential propagation was used to compare activation times and recovery times measured from simulated unipolar and bipolar electrograms with the activation and recovery times measured from simulated transmembrane action potentials. Theory predicts that the intrinsic deflection--the time of the maximum negative slope of the unipolar electrogram QRS complex--corresponds to the time of maximum positive slope of action potential depolarization. Similarly, the time of the maximum positive slope of the unipolar electrogram T wave corresponds to the time of maximum negative slope of action potential repolarization. This study showed that the difference between the unipolar electrogram activation time and the action potential activation time and the difference between the unipolar electrogram recovery time and the action potential recovery time were small during ideal conditions of uniform propagation in a long cable. Nonideal conditions, however, were associated with activation time differences in excess of 1.8 msec and recovery time differences in excess of 30 msec (243 msec in certain conditions). Nonideal conditions that had a major influence were changes in activation sequence, propagation in a short cable, and propagation through regions of nonuniform coupling resistance and/or nonuniform membrane properties. Nonideal conditions that had a smaller influence were variations in distance from the measurement site to the simulated tissue surface, nonzero reference potentials, and the addition of distant events. Recovery time differences were more sensitive to the nonideal conditions than were activation time differences, and both depended on the action potential shape. When distant events significantly contributed to the unipolar electrogram waveform, the time differences when bipolar electrograms were used were less than those when unipolar electrograms were used; however, under other conditions, the time differences were comparable. Results showed that activation times and especially recovery times measured from electrograms can be greatly affected by conditions independent of changes in the underlying action potential waveforms.\r"

  ".U": "89136142\r", 
  ".W": "The present study investigates the mechanism of endothelium-dependent relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Melittin, a polypeptide found in honeybee venom and a known activator of phospholipase A2, induced transient, endothelium-dependent relaxations of rat thoracic aortae contracted with norepinephrine. Higher concentrations of melittin induced relaxations followed by contractions. Prior incubation of melittin with trypsin abolished the changes in relaxation and contraction due to melittin. Melittin (10 micrograms/ml)-induced relaxations were associated with transiently elevated levels of cyclic GMP with a peak increase of 30-fold, which occurred 30 seconds after melittin exposure. Melittin (10 micrograms/ml) elevated cyclic AMP levels less than twofold and this effect was variable. A lower concentration of melittin (1 microgram/ml) elevated cyclic GMP levels approximately twofold, while exposure to 1 microgram/ml melittin in the presence of the cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, M&B 22948 (1 mM), increased cyclic GMP levels fivefold. Removal of the endothelium prevented the increased levels of cyclic GMP and cyclic AMP due to melittin. Exposure to the guanylate cyclase inhibitor, methylene blue, prevented the increased levels of cyclic GMP. Methylene blue, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, and the phospholipase A2 inhibitor, parabromophenacyl bromide, inhibited melittin-induced relaxations, while the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, was without effect. Arachidonic acid increased cyclic AMP levels but had no effect on cyclic GMP levels in the presence or absence of indomethacin. Relaxations to melittin, and to the endothelium-dependent vasodilators acetylcholine, trypsin, histamine, and the Ca2+ ionophore A23187, and/or the associated increased cyclic GMP levels, were reduced following exposure to melittin. Prior exposure to polyarginine (10 micrograms/ml), which induced endothelium-dependent relaxations that were prevented by methylene blue, also inhibited relaxations to the endothelium-dependent vasodilators. In contrast, relaxations to sodium nitroprusside were potentiated in tissues previously exposed to melittin. Removal of the endothelium by rubbing the intimal surface also potentiated relaxations to sodium nitroprusside. Scanning electron micrographs of the intimal surface demonstrated that melittin and polyarginine greatly damaged the endothelial cells. The present results suggest that polycation containing peptides induce endothelium-dependent relaxation through elevation of cyclic GMP levels within the smooth muscle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89136149\r", 
  ".W": "Oxygen withdrawal from myocardial cells leads to changes of the transmembrane action potential (mainly action potential shortening), to cellular uncoupling, and to changes of vascular permeability. This study was aimed at the simultaneous measurement of electrical activity and passive electrical properties (extracellular and intracellular longitudinal resistance) in arterially perfused rabbit papillary muscles under different conditions of changed oxygen supply. These included 1) complete anoxia (erythrocyte-free perfusate), 2) hypoxia (PO2 between 23-28 mm Hg, erythrocytes present) in the presence and absence of glucose, and 3) normoxia with erythrocyte-free perfusate. Similarly to myocardial ischemia, rapid cellular uncoupling occurred only after an initial stable period of approximately 17 minutes, and it required complete anoxia. The marked shortening of the action potential developed before cellular uncoupling. In six out of eight experiments, the fibers were inexcitable when uncoupling started. In severe hypoxia, no significant change of internal longitudinal resistance was observed over 35-40 minutes. The time course of the extracellular longitudinal resistance was different from the change in intracellular resistance: A marked decrease occurred almost immediately after the onset of oxygen withdrawal. This decrease was followed by a small increase in conduction velocity, which was most likely due to a change in the interstitial compartment (edema). It was observed during anoxic as well as during hypoxic perfusion. We conclude that 1) cellular uncoupling in arterially perfused tissue requires almost complete oxygen lack and occurs with a delay of more than 10 minutes, 2) marked action potential shortening precedes uncoupling, and therefore can not simply be attributed to an increase in free, intracellular calcium, and 3) vascular endothelial function is more sensitive to oxygen withdrawal than the myocyte.\r"

  ".W": "Neonatal ventricular myocytes that were incubated in a well-defined serum-free medium containing 50 mM KCl did not contract and maintained stable cell size, as assessed by the protein/DNA ratio. The present study utilized KCl-arrested cells to examine the effect of constant rates of synchronous contraction in normal [K+]o (4 mM) as a physiological stimulus for myocyte growth. Cell growth increased following the onset of contraction when measured over 3 days. The rate of protein synthesis was accelerated in parallel by contraction, but the rate of protein degradation remained similar to rates in noncontracting cells. The capacity for protein synthesis was estimated by total RNA content and was increased in contracting as compared with KCl-arrested cells. This increase was accompanied by faster rates of RNA synthesis as determined from the incorporation of [3H]uridine into RNA and the specific activity of the cellular UTP pool. The rate of RNA degradation was accelerated during contraction but the difference between the rates of RNA synthesis and degradation resulted in net RNA accumulation of 49% after 3 days. These data demonstrated that 1) contractile activity stimulated myocyte growth through an increased capacity for protein synthesis and 2) the increased capacity for protein synthesis involved acceleration of the rate of RNA synthesis. Since enhancement of protein synthetic capacity is a common feature of myocyte hypertrophy in vivo and in vitro, this model can be used to examine the regulation of ribosome synthesis during hypertrophic growth.\r"

  ".W": "Studies of the stellate ganglion and middle cervical ganglion indicate that sympathetic efferent nerve activity can be modified by peripheral excitatory inputs and that these neural connections may function as pathways for a peripheral reflex at the level of the thoracic sympathetic ganglia. This excitatory synaptic input could have a soma in either the central or the peripheral nervous system. A study was designed to determine whether chronic decentralization (3 weeks) of the stellate ganglion in cats would 1) abolish sympathetic cardiac afferent nerve activity recorded at the stellate cardiac nerve and 2) abolish local thoracic reflexes that are generated by stimulation of peripheral nerves. The ansae subclaviae, T3 and T4 rami, and stellate ganglion were also examined by electron microscopy for the extent of Wallerian degeneration. Afferent cardiac activation of the axon collaterals arising from cell bodies located in the dorsal root ganglia was abolished due to degeneration. However, sympathetic afferent nerve activity from the left ventricular receptors was still present and was recorded from the stellate cardiac nerve in all cats. Cardiac receptors were sensitive to mechanical distortion, increases in the left ventricular pressure, and epicardial application of veratrine hydrochloride. These data imply that 1) cardiovascular afferent input to the stellate ganglion persists following chronic decentralization and 2) the sensory neurons are located in the peripheral sympathetic nervous system. Thus, we find that regulation of the heart occurs in part via thoracic ganglia, independently of the central nervous system.\r"

Anesthetized, open-chest dogs were subjected to left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) stenosis that produced significant epicardial S-T segment elevation (12 mV) only when superimposed on atrial pacing. Regional myocardial blood flow was determined using radioactive microspheres, and O2 consumption was determined by measuring O2 saturation of venous blood draining the ischemic region. The dogs were treated with saline or 0.2 mg/kg + 0.2 mg/kg/hr SQ 29,548, and the effect on ischemia was determined during 5-minute pacing-induced ischemic episodes at 10, 40, and 70 minutes postdrug or saline treatment. SQ 29,548 significantly reduced S-T elevation at 40 and 70 minutes postdrug compared with saline values and at all times measured compared with its paired predrug pace+stenosis values. SQ 29,548 reduced S-T elevation approximately 45% compared with its paired predrug values at 70 minutes. SQ 29,548 resulted in a significantly higher subendocardial-to-subepicardial flow ratio (0.70 +/- 0.10, p less than 0.05) compared with saline-treated animals (0.42 +/- 0.06), with an overall increase of flow to the ischemic region of approximately 40%. This increased flow was matched by a proportional increase in O2 consumption without a change in O2 extraction. The O2 supply/consumption balance was also unchanged by SQ 29,548 implying that despite the increase in blood flow, the ischemic region was still flow-limited.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Shortening of the cardiac action potential during ischemia and anoxia is likely to contribute to the decline in contractility that occurs under such conditions. It has been hypothesized that a decrease in the intracellular ATP concentration ([ATP]i) underlies the changes in the action potential. The recently discovered potassium channel activated at low ATP concentrations might provide the link between action potential shortening and low [ATP]i. However, it has yet to be shown that [ATP]i falls to the range required for channel activation at the time when action potential shortening occurs. We have measured action potentials and [ATP]i simultaneously in isolated ferret hearts during inhibition of both oxidative phosphorylation and anaerobic glycolysis (metabolic blockade). Metabolic blockade caused a rapid decline in cardiac contractility, accompanied by a rapid fall in action potential duration. [ATP]i fell only slightly and remained well above the range where activation of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel would be expected to occur. Moreover, reintroduction of glucose to the perfusate led to a substantial recovery in both contraction and in action potential duration, again in the absence of any great change in [ATP]i. These results suggest that the action potential shortening observed in metabolic blockade cannot be explained by the simple hypothesis of K+ channel opening as a consequence of a decrease in bulk [ATP]i unless the Km for suppression of channel activity by ATP is very much higher in intact cells than in any of the patch configurations studied. An alternative explanation is that the channel may be regulated under these conditions by mechanisms other than a change in [ATP]i.\r"

  ".W": "Static muscular contraction in anesthetized animals has been firmly established to reflexly increase arterial pressure. Although group III and IV muscle afferents are known to be responsible for this reflex pressor response, there is no evidence that the stimulation of muscle mechanoreceptors, many of which are supplied by group III fibers, plays a role in causing this contraction-induced reflex effect. To provide this evidence, we recorded renal sympathetic nerve activity in chloralose-anesthetized cats while contracting the triceps surae muscles. We found that static contraction tripled renal nerve activity within three seconds of its onset, an increase that was abolished by cutting the L6 and S2 dorsal roots. On average, the contraction-induced increase in renal nerve activity was observed 0.8 +/- 0.1 seconds after the onset of this maneuver. In addition, intermittent tetanic contractions synchronized renal nerve discharge so that a burst of activity was evoked by each contraction. A similarly synchronized renal nerve discharge was evoked in paralyzed cats by electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve at five times motor threshold, a current intensity that activates group III afferents. We conclude that, in anesthetized animal preparations, mechanoreceptors with group III afferents contribute to the reflex stimulation of renal sympathetic outflow evoked by muscular contraction.\r"

  ".U": "89136158\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies have revealed that the regional accumulation of ischemic metabolites including hydrogen ion (H+) and PCO2 diminish after repeated occlusions. We postulated that this diminution reflects a blunted metabolic response that is related to the severity of ischemic injury and, hence, may be most pronounced in subendocardial (ENDO) regions. To investigate this hypothesis, the left anterior descending coronary artery was serially occluded three times in 51 dogs for a period of either 3 minutes (n = 15), 5 minutes (n = 18), or 15 minutes (n = 18). Each occlusion was separated by 45 minutes of reperfusion. Myocardial [H+] was measured in the endomyocardium and in the epimyocardium of the ischemic anterior wall by use of miniature pH glass electrodes. Accumulation of H+ during occlusion (delta [H+]) in the ENDO region was significantly less during the second occlusion when compared with the first occlusion (3-minute occlusions: 28.2 +/- 3.7 nM/l vs. 39.4 +/- 5.4 nM/l, p less than 0.002; 5-minute occlusions: 49.8 +/- 5.0 nM/l vs. 72.1 +/- 6.5 nM/l, p less than 0.0002; 15-minute occlusions: 132.3 +/- 14.6 nM/l vs. 225.6 +/- 27.7 nM/l, p less than 0.0003). A similar trend was noted for delta [H+] in the subepicardial (EPI) regions. During occlusion, the rise in [H+] occurred sooner, and delta [H+] was consistently greater in the ENDO when compared with the EPI regions (p less than 0.05). Regional myocardial blood flow did not change during the three occlusions, indicating that the diminution in H+ accumulation stemmed from a decrease in H+ production and not from an increase in collateral flow. The decrement in H+ accumulation between the first and second occlusions (delta [H+]1-delta [H+]2) 1) was greater in the ENDO than in the EPI regions (p less than 0.05); 2) correlated with the duration of occlusion (ENDO: r = 0.66, p less than 0.001; EPI: r = 0.82, p less than 0.0001); and 3) was related to the impairment of anterior wall systolic shortening after the first reperfusion period. These findings suggest that the diminution in H+ production that follows serial coronary occlusions reflects a blunted metabolic response that is related to both the duration of ischemia and the degree of systolic dysfunction. Moreover, though attenuation of ischemic metabolite production occurs transmurally, it is most pronounced in the deep ENDO regions.\r"

The arrhythmia was cured in two patients and suppressed during a 1-month period in the third until new collateral blood supply to the arrhythmogenic area developed and ventricular tachycardia recurred. The procedure was then repeated successfully. After administration of ethanol in the high interventricular septum, one patient developed temporary complete atrioventricular block and a pacemaker was implanted. No other complications occurred. We observed that in patients with ventricular tachycardia after myocardial infarction, it is possible to identify and catheterize small coronary arteries responsible for blood supply to the site of origin or pathway of ventricular tachycardia. After careful transcoronary mapping with saline, chemical ablation can prevent further episodes of the arrhythmia in selected patients.\r"

  ".W": "Severe heart failure is associated with a reduction in myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor density and an impaired contractile response to catecholamine stimulation. Metoprolol was administered during a 6-month period to 14 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy to examine its effects on these abnormalities. The mean daily dose of metoprolol for the group was 105 mg (range, 75-150 mg). Myocardial beta-receptor density, resting hemodynamic output, and peak left ventricular dP/dt response to dobutamine infusions were compared in 9, 14, and 7 patients, respectively, before and after 6 months of metoprolol therapy while the patients were on therapy. The second hemodynamic study was performed 1-2 hours after the morning dose of metoprolol had been given. Myocardial beta-receptor density increased from 39 +/- 7 to 80 +/- 12 fmol/mg (p less than 0.05). Resting hemodynamic output showed a rise in stroke work index from 27 +/- 4 to 43 +/- 3 g/m/m2, p less than 0.05, and ejection fraction rose from 0.26 +/- 0.03 to 0.39 +/- 0.03 after 6 months of metoprolol therapy, p less than 0.05. Before metoprolol therapy, dobutamine caused a 21 +/- 4% increase in peak positive left ventricular dP/dt; during metoprolol therapy, the same dobutamine infusion rate increased peak positive dP/dt by 74 +/- 18% (p less than 0.05). Thus, long-term metoprolol therapy is associated with an increase in myocardial beta-receptor density, significant improvement in resting hemodynamic output, and improved contractile response to catecholamine stimulation. These changes indicate a restoration of beta-adrenergic sensitivity associated with metoprolol therapy, possibly related to the observed up-regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors.\r"

Many recent studies indicate that neutrophils may be involved in the genesis and propagation of myocardial ischemia. To characterize neutrophil function in ischemic heart disease, neutrophil chemotaxis, leukotriene B4 (LTB4) generation, and elastase release in plasma were measured in 20 patients with stable angina, 17 patients with unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and 20 age-matched control subjects. Neutrophils from patients with stable angina exhibited markedly increased chemotactic activity and LTB4 generation as compared with the age-matched control subjects (p less than 0.01). Neutrophils of nine of 17 patients with unstable angina or AMI clumped spontaneously ex vivo and exhibited marked pseudopod formation and granule extrusion on electron microscopy. Subsequent chemotactic activity and LTB4 generation by neutrophils from these patients was less than in patients with stable angina, suggesting previous in vivo activation. Plasma levels of peptide B beta, a product of fibrin degradation by human neutrophil elastase, were approximately 15-fold higher (p less than 0.001) in patients with unstable angina or AMI (588 +/- 171 pmol/l, mean +/- SEM) compared with those in patients with stable angina (37 +/- 25 pmol/l) or control subjects (40 +/- 22 pmol/l), confirming intense in vivo neutrophil activation. Our study shows enhanced neutrophil function in patients with ischemic heart disease. The increased neutrophil chemotactic activity and LTB4 generation may be markers of stable angina pectoris. Intense neutrophil activation in unstable angina or AMI, as manifested by morphologic changes in neutrophils and elastase release, may relate to ongoing in vivo cellular activation.\r"

However, the routinely used dose of dipyridamole (0.56 mg/kg IV over 4 min) does not always result in maximal coronary dilation. The addition of isometric handgrip during dipyridamole coronary dilation has been reported to substantially increase coronary blood flow over dipyridamole alone. We compared the coronary vasodilation resulting from infusion of the standard dose of dipyridamole with that resulting from a maximally dilating dose of intracoronary papaverine in 12 patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries. We also assessed the effect on coronary blood flow velocity of the addition of isometric handgrip during dipyridamole coronary dilation. Changes in coronary blood flow velocity were measured with a 3F coronary Doppler catheter. The coronary flow reserve (peak/resting coronary flow velocity ratio) after dipyridamole (3.7 +/- 1.2 [mean +/- SD] was less than that seen after papaverine (4.4 +/- 0.5, p less than 0.05), and the coronary vascular resistance index during dipyridamole coronary vasodilation (0.28 +/- 0.09) was greater than during papaverine (0.22 +/- 0.03, p less than 0.05). The dipyridamole coronary flow reserve was less than 3.0 in four subjects and was 2.0 or less in two subjects. The addition of isometric handgrip to dipyridamole coronary vasodilation produced an 8% increase in mean heart rate and a 17% increase in mean arterial pressure, but coronary flow reserve was unchanged (3.8 +/- 1.1 before handgrip vs. 4.0 +/- 1.1 with handgrip). Quantitative angiography in six patients revealed no change in coronary caliber with the addition of handgrip.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Seven patients who did not improve and were not surgical candidates died 3.8 +/- 1.2 months after PMV. Nine patients who were surgical candidates underwent elective MVR at 4 +/- 0.9 months after PMV. Repeat cardiac catheterization demonstrated restenosis in only one of 27 patients (4%) with a score of 8 or less. Mitral valve area after PMV was 1.9 +/- 0.1 cm2 and at follow-up was 2 +/- 0.1 cm2 (NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Little is known about this condition in the elderly, although it is assumed to be part of a single disease. Accordingly, we studied 28 patients who were 65 years of age and older (mean age, 72 +/- 6.4 years) who were diagnosed as having hypertrophic cardiomyopathy by M-mode, two-dimensional, and Doppler echocardiography and compared them with a group of 28 consecutive patients with this disease who were younger than 40 years of age (mean age, 26 +/- 9.5 years). No clinically detectable differences existed between the two groups, except for an increased incidence of mild hypertension in the elderly. Echocardiography in both groups showed hypertrophy with a small left ventricular cavity, and Doppler outflow tract velocity or cardiac catheterization in most patients showed systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve or a systolic outflow tract gradient or both. Significant differences existed between both groups, however, concerning left ventricular size and shape. The elderly group had a predominantly ovoid cavity contour with normal septal curvature. In contrast, in the young group, a markedly abnormal cardiac shape predominated (p less than 0.0001) with a crescent-shaped left ventricular cavity and a reversed curvature of the interventricular septum. The right ventricular free wall was prominent by echocardiography in the young compared with the elderly group (p less than 0.001). Apart from a more frequent history of mild hypertension in the elderly, likely related to age, these findings show that hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, when present in the elderly, has similar clinical features to that in the young.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In all patients, anginal attacks associated with ischemic ST segment changes on the electrocardiogram were repeatedly induced by hyperventilation. The study was performed in the early morning successively for 3 days. On days 1 and 3 (control studies), 50 minutes before the hyperventilation test, a 5% glucose solution was infused as a placebo. On day 2 (magnesium study), 50 minutes before the hyperventilation test, magnesium sulfate (0.27 mM/kg body wt) was infused during a 20-minute period. During the control studies, anginal attack was induced by hyperventilation in all 20 patients, whereas during the magnesium study, anginal attack was induced by hyperventilation in only six (30%) of the 20 patients (p less than 0.001 vs. control studies). The changes in arterial blood pH and PCO2 caused by hyperventilation were not significant between the control study and the magnesium study. Mean serum magnesium concentration increased from 2.2 +/- 0.2 to 6.0 +/- 0.5 mg/dl immediately after infusing magnesium and was 4.5 +/- 0.6 mg/dl before the hyperventilation test during the magnesium study. We conclude that magnesium suppresses anginal attacks induced by hyperventilation in patients with variant angina.\r"

The effects of intravenous perfluorochemicals (Fluosol-DA) on infarct size, ventricular contractility, and neutrophil function were assessed in an occlusion-reperfusion canine model. Closed-chest dogs were subjected to 90 minutes of left anterior descending artery occlusion followed by 24 hours of reperfusion. Animals were randomized to receive either Fluosol-DA (FDA, n = 8) or Ringer's lactate (CONT, n = 10) intravenously over 30 minutes just before left anterior descending artery reperfusion. Neutrophil demargination and infiltration into the myocardium were assessed in vivo with In111. Neutrophil chemotaxis, superoxide radical production, and lysozyme degranulation were evaluated ex vivo at baseline, 1 hour after occlusion, and 1 hour after reperfusion. Perfluorochemicals significantly reduced infarct size expressed as percent of area at risk (FDA, 7 +/- 4%; CONT, 24 +/- 6%; p less than 0.01). This was associated with positive wall motion in the jeopardized zone of Fluosol-DA animals compared with dyskinesis in control animals (FDA, +4.4 +/- 2.1%; CONT, -1.1 +/- 1.5%; p less than 0.05). Electron microscopy showed reduced neutrophil and erythrocyte plugging of capillaries with relative preservation of endothelial cells in the Fluosol-DA animals. Myocardial blood flow was greater in the ischemic endocardium of Fluosol-DA animals 1 hour after reperfusion (FDA, 1.23 +/- 0.21; CONT, 0.62 +/- 0.08 ml/g/min; p less than 0.01). Neutrophil demargination and infiltration into the ischemic myocardium was reduced in the animals treated with Fluosol-DA. (FDA, 2.5 +/- 0.7 x 10(3); CONT, 14.1 +/- 2.7 x 10(3) neutrophils/g; p less than 0.01). Neutrophil chemotaxis and lysozyme release were also markedly suppressed in the Fluosol-DA groups ex vivo. These results show that intravenous Fluosol-DA significantly reduces reperfusion injury with greater salvage of myocardium and improved left ventricular function. The chief mechanism of action of Fluosol-DA appears to be the suppression of neutrophil function.\r"

Fifty-five animals (mean weight, 33.9 kg) were randomized to one of six heparin dosages: heparin boluses of 35, 50, 100, 150, 200, or 250 units/kg followed by a continuous infusion of 35, 50, 100, 150, 200, or 250 units/kg/hr, respectively. Another five pigs received a bolus of 1 mg/kg hirudin (recombinant desulphatohirudin), a specific thrombin inhibitor, followed by an infusion of 1 mg/kg/hr. Bilateral carotid angioplasty was performed in all pigs 20 minutes after starting the infusion; they were sacrificed 57 +/- 12 minutes after the procedure. Deep medial arterial injury was present in approximately 75% of the dilated segments, and subendothelial injury in the remaining 25%. Mean log of number of platelets and molecules of fibrinogen per centimeter squared of deep injury in segments from all the animals treated with heparin were 4.74 +/- 1.03 and 5.02 +/- 0.64, respectively. A regression analysis showed an inverse correlation of the log of platelet deposition with the heparin group (r = -0.56, p = 0.0001) with administered total units of heparin (r = -0.55, p = 0.0003) and with mean plasma heparin concentration (r = -0.55, p = 0.0004) in deeply injured arteries. Similar inverse relations were obtained for fibrinogen. In contrast, the deposition of platelets and fibrinogen in subendothelial injury was very low and independent of the heparin administered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89136181\r", 
  ".W": "Early afterdepolarization (EAD)-induced triggered activity is thought to contribute to the cardiac arrhythmogenic effects of several class I antiarrhythmic agents. The combination of quinidine therapy, bradycardia, and hypokalemia is known to predispose to torsade de pointes, which is a form of atypical polymorphous ventricular tachycardia commonly associated with long QT intervals. Recent clinical reports have shown suppression of quinidine-induced torsade de pointes with intravenous administration of magnesium sulfate. To provide further understanding of these relations, we used standard microelectrode techniques to examine the time course of quinidine-induced action potential prolongation, EAD, and triggered activity development and the dependence of these changes on [K+]0, [Mg2+]0, and stimulation frequency in isolated Purkinje fiber preparations exposed to low concentrations of the drug. At slow stimulation rates, the quinidine-induced increase of action potential duration was slow to develop and failed to reach a steady state after 3 hours of exposure to the drug. EAD and EAD-induced triggered activity generally became apparent 70-90 minutes after adding the drug. Quinidine produced triggered activity in 10 of 22 preparations superfused with Tyrode's solution containing normal [K+]0 (3.5-4.0 mM) and in six other preparations when [K+]0 was reduced. In the presence of normal [K+]0, two types of EAD and triggered activity were distinguished. In four of 10 preparations, this activity arose from phase 2 of the action potential; in eight of 10, it was associated with phase 3; and in two experiments, both types were present in the same preparation. The incidence of both forms of triggered responses depended greatly on the rate of stimulation. Triggered activity arising from phase 3 was always manifest at rates considerably slower than those giving rise to phase 2 activity. Both forms of triggered activity were sensitive to changes in the extracellular concentration of potassium and magnesium. Lower-than-normal levels of these electrolytes facilitated the manifestation of triggered activity, whereas elevated levels suppressed or caused a shift in the frequency-dependence of the activity. Phase 2, but not phase 3, EADs were abolished in response to increased [Mg2+]0. The data show a clear congruity between the conditions that predispose to torsade de pointes in the clinic and the conditions under which quinidine may induce triggered activity and marked action potential prolongation in isolated Purkinje fibers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In normal isolated, perfused canine ventricles, increased ventricular volume leads to shortening of refractoriness. To test the hypothesis that myocardium within an infarction zone is more susceptible to volume-induced changes in refractoriness than is normal myocardium, we measured strength-interval curves at low and high end-diastolic volumes at control and infarcted sites in 14 isolated, blood perfused, canine hearts with chronic (greater than 25 days) infarctions. In addition, the effect of volume load on inducing ventricular arrhythmias was studied at one to six sites in 11 hearts. Differences in refractoriness and inducibility at low (22 +/- 5 ml) and high (48 +/- 6 ml) end-diastolic volumes were compared. At control sites, volume load reduced the absolute refractory period from 178 +/- 16.5 to 175 +/- 16.7 msec (p less than 0.05), but no significant change in the relative refractory period occurred. At infarcted sites, the change in refractoriness with volume load was greater, and the absolute refractory period decreased from 171.5 +/- 21 to 160.6 +/- 26.3 msec (p less than 0.01), and the relative refractory period decreased from 180.1 +/- 22.1 to 169.9 +/- 26 msec (p = 0.05). This differential effect of volume load on refractoriness led to an increased dispersion of overall refractoriness at high volume. Infarcted sites showing the largest changes in refractoriness were characterized by patchy scars extending at least to the midmyocardium, whereas sites located within areas of transmural scar, endocardial scar, or rare microfoci of fibrosis showed no increased sensitivity to volume load. Of eight hearts in which no tachyarrhythmias were inducible during programmed electrical stimulation at low volume, four had tachyarrhythmias induced at high volume. Sites of stimulation associated with a conversion from noninducible to inducible tachyarrhythmias showed a larger degree of shortening of refractoriness (change in absolute refractory period: 24.7 +/- 16.5 vs. 3.9 +/- 6.5 msec, p less than 0.05). These data indicate that volume loading may have electrophysiologic significance and that it may be of greater functional importance under pathologic conditions.\r"

  ".W": "In monkeys with early and advanced atherosclerosis, we examined responses to the three major vasoactive agonists that are released when platelets aggregate. Measurements were obtained in normal cynomolgus monkeys and in monkeys fed an atherogenic diet for 4 +/- 1, 9 +/- 1, and 19 +/- 1 months (mean +/- SEM). Morphometry of femoral and iliac arteries indicated that 4 months of atherogenic diet produced only slight intimal thickening, 9 months produced early lesions, and 19 months produced approximately 5-10 fold greater intimal proliferation than did 9 months of atherogenic diet. Serotonin and adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP), which are endothelium-dependent agonists, and adenosine and phenylephrine, which are endothelium-independent agonists, were injected intra-arterially into the perfused hind limb. Thromboxane A2 analogue U46619 also was studied. Vasoconstrictor responses to serotonin were potentiated, and vasodilator responses to ADP were impaired by early and advanced atherosclerosis. In contrast, vasoconstrictor responses to phenylephrine and vasodilator responses to adenosine were similar in all groups. Vasoconstrictor responses to U46619 were potentiated by advanced atherosclerosis. Thus, vascular responses to serotonin, ADP, and thromboxane A2 are altered by atherosclerosis in a direction that would favor vasoconstriction when platelets aggregate. Furthermore, because responses to endothelium-dependent agonists are altered, these data suggest that endothelium is dysfunctional in early atherosclerosis. These findings may explain, in part, the propensity for exaggerated vasoconstriction even in arteries with minimal atherosclerotic lesions.\r"

  ".W": "Measurement of left ventricular (LV) mass by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is accurate in normal hearts. Because determination of mass by MRI does not require assumptions about ventricular shape, this method may be well suited for evaluating hearts distorted by infarction. To test this hypothesis, gated MRI was performed in 15 dogs before and after acute myocardial infarction. The LV mass of each dog was calculated from five short-axis images acquired at end systole, when shape distortion is greatest, at end diastole, and also from slices at varying phases of the cycle with a multiphase mode that required only one acquisition. Correlation was excellent between actual mass and end-systolic mass before infarction (p less than 0.001, r = 0.98, and SEE = 5.1 g) and after infarction (p less than 0.001, r = 0.97, and SEE = 6.6 g). Likewise, values correlated closely at end diastole before (p less than 0.001, r = 0.96, and SEE = 6.7 g) and after infarction (p less than 0.001, r = 0.94, and SEE = 8.7 g). Surprisingly, measurements of mass by a multiphase mode were also very accurate before (p less than 0.001, r = 0.98, and SEE = 5.1 g) and after (p less than 0.001, r = 0.95, and SEE = 6.49 g) infarction. Therefore, at the same phase and at multiphases of the cardiac cycle, MRI permits accurate determination of LV mass in distorted hearts.\r"

The history and physical examination should be directed to the principal target organs, including the optic fundi, central nervous system, heart, and kidneys. Laboratory evaluation should include urinalysis, ECG, and determinations of blood hemoglobin/hematocrit, creatinine, potassium, glucose, and cholesterol, including HDL fraction. This information will alert the physician to the possibility of curable forms of hypertension such as coarctation of the aorta, pheochromocytoma, primary aldosteronism, and renovascular hypertension.

The procedures considered in the study were humeral head and total shoulder replacement. Use of an intraoperative autotransfusion device was associated with fewer units of transfused banked blood and similar or smaller drops in hematocrit. While shoulder surgery can involve substantial blood loss, the authors recommend intraoperative autologous transfusion for revision of failed shoulder surgery, arthrodesis, joint replacement, or repairs of massive cuff tears when mobilization and tendon transfers are anticipated. The risk of disease transmission through banked blood, especially of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and hepatitis viruses, has increased the need for a heightened awareness and use of alternative blood sources such as IAT.\r"

Mechanical failure was evaluated using survivorship analysis on all arthroplasties performed at the authors' institution by the Orthopedic Service from March 1971 until September 1983. Failure was defined as the necessity for replacement of one or more components for any reason other than infection. The failure rate was approximately 1.7% per year and, at 12 years, 20% of the hips had failed. Variables evaluated as potential risk factors for arthroplasty revision included weight, gender, age, surgeon, preoperative functional status, prosthetic type, and diagnosis. A Cox proportional hazard analysis indicated that weight (p less than 0.015) and age (p = 0.087) are important determinants of hip failure. The use of regression trees identified subsets of patients at differing risks for failure. Patients who weighed less than 75.22 kg had the best outcome with a 90% survival to 12 years. Patients weighing more than 75.22 kg are at varying risk depending on their age. These data define a subset of special-risk patients not previously described. Patients weighing more than 75.22 kg who were older than 75.4 years had a revision rate of 73% by eight years.\r"

Relatively small (15 degrees or less) amounts of femoral rotation can cause significant changes in proximal femoral dimensions on supine AP hip roentgenograms, and the magnitude of these changes increases with rotation. Fifteen degrees of rotation can change it by almost 3 mm. These changes are comparable to the medullary canal expansion of a normal adult femur over a five- to ten-year period. These changes in measured proximal femoral dimensions with rotation necessitate either an improved roentgenographic technique or precise rotational matching of standard supine roentgenograms to obtain accurate measurements of their changes over time.\r"

Indications for this technique include pain, swelling, stiffness, instability, hemarthrosis, and locking of the ankle. The anteromedial, anterolateral, and posterolateral portals are most commonly used. The use of a short, 30 degrees oblique arthroscope, with an ankle holder and distractor, permits visualization of the entire joint. Operative treatment is facilitated by small joint shavers, burrs, knives, and baskets. Intraarticular problems such as chondromalacia, osteophytes, loose bodies, synovitis, osteoarthritis, fracture, and instability all can be addressed arthroscopically. Prior to this technique, the cause of chronic ankle pain was poorly understood. Now, lateral ankle impingement is a well-recognized entity that responds well to arthroscopic treatment. Ankle arthroscopy provides a safe, effective method of diagnosis and treatment with few complications. Further advances in equipment and technique should expand indications for this procedure.\r"

The natural course and rationale of treating this diabetic arthropathy is presented, based on the literature and the authors' experience with eight cases. Appropriate management depends on the acuteness of the injury, the degree of deformity, and the degree of bone fragmentation. If the injury is acute and alignment is acceptable, immobilization and protective weight bearing may prevent progression of the neuropathic joint destruction. If dislocation is acute with marked deformity but there is little fragmentation and the foot has intact circulation, reduction and surgical arthrodesis may be indicated. If dislocation is chronic, with bone fragmentation and severe deformity, proper management consists of wearing custom-molded shoes with stiff rocker-bottom soles. Patellar tendon weight-bearing braces may be added if needed. For patients in this last category, surgical treatment is recommended as a last resort only if soft-tissue breakdown cannot be prevented by appropriate footwear and bracing alone.\r"

Values were obtained from the forearm: (1) intact and with both bones fractured; (2) without fixation; (3) with a fracture brace; (4) with Rush pins; and (5) with a combination of Rush pins and a fracture brace. A brace was ineffectual in reducing fracture site motion when the wrist was rotated to specified angles compared to fracture site motion for the forearm with no fixation treatment rotated to the same angles. When loading to specific torque levels, however, the brace reduced fracture site motion to one-half the motion with no fixation treatment. Under both loading conditions, Rush pin fixation significantly and markedly reduced the fracture site motion (to approximately one-eighth of the motion with no fixation treatment), whereas a brace in conjunction with Rush pins did not significantly further reduce the fracture site motion. The radius showed more motion at fracture site than the ulna.\r"

Hip fractures rarely recurred in the same hips. Patients with previous cervical hip fractures, unlike those with previous trochanteric fractures, had a predominance of subsequent fractures distal to the hip ipsilaterally. Those with previous femoral shaft fractures were more likely to have subsequent fractures ipsilaterally. Both femoral shaft and patellar fractures were more often seen on the side of previous lower extremity fractures. Patients with previous tibial fractures had more subsequent fractures of the femur and tibia ipsilaterally, and their present tibial fractures were more frequently ipsilateral when these fracture types had occurred in the past. Some of these shifts from the equal distribution of fractures between the two sides may be due to posttraumatic osteopenia.\r"

Treatment is usually surgical resection, but there is a small risk of local recurrence and metastasis. Cytogenetic analyses were performed on giant-cell bone tumors of six consecutive patients. Chromosomally abnormal clones were found in three of the tumors, but no two patients had the same chromosome abnormality. Thus, there was no correlation between any specific chromosome change and the clinical behavior or histology of giant-cell bone tumors. However, all of the tumors had a significantly higher incidence of nonclonal chromosome abnormalities than is encountered in cultures of normal cells. The most common nonclonal abnormalities involved unusual telomere-to-telomere chromosome translocations. These findings suggest that the cells in these tumors are chromosomally unstable. The telomeres most frequently involved were on the long arm of chromosomes 19 and 20.\r"

Three mechanisms have been demonstrated to be effective means of controlling the injury problem: (1) persuading persons at risk of injury to alter their behavior; (2) requiring individual behavior changes by law or administrative rule; and (3) providing automatic protection by product and environmental design. Specific strategies for implementing injury-prevention programs by the orthopedic surgeon are physician education, patient education, and public education.\r"

Correlation of the standard roentgenographic, computed tomographic, and clinical orthopedic examinations revealed that pelvic stability was accurately evaluated on the standard pelvic roentgenograms in 88% of cases. Disruptions were stable in 70%, unstable in 18%, and suspect in 12% of patients, for whom adjunct roentgenographic and clinical examinations were required. Determination of pelvic stability in the manner described allows immediate identification of patients with a stable or unstable pelvic injury, as well as identification of those with indeterminate stability requiring further clinical or roentgenologic evaluation. Immediate recognition of pelvic instability on standard pelvic roentgenograms obviates the need for additional diagnostic studies that unnecessarily delay the institution of emergency therapeutic measures designed to control associated hemorrhage.\r"

Using the slit catheter device, compartmental pressures in excess of 30-35 mmHg in a normally perfused patient suggest the need for open compartment fasciotomy. Chronic compartment syndromes require dynamic pressure measurements for an accurate diagnosis. The most important parameters are elevated postexercise pressures and delayed restoration of normal compartmental pressures. Subcutaneous fasciotomy may be sufficient in accurately diagnosed cases of chronic compartment syndrome.\r"

Since it has been shown that PTH activates phospholipid inositol metabolism, we investigated whether PTH influences protein kinase-C (PKC) activity in rat osteosarcoma (ROS) cells 17/2.8 that contain a large number of PTH receptor. Incubation of ROS cells with PTH or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 1-30 min caused a rapid and transient decrease in PKC activity in the cytosol, which was associated with a transient increase in PKC activity in the membrane fraction. After 1, 5, 15, and 30 min of incubation with PTH, cytosolic PKC activity decreased to 57%, 74%, 84%, and 93% of the control value, whereas membrane PKC activity increased to 156%, 122%, 111%, and 106% of the control value, respectively. After PMA treatment for 1, 5, 15, and 30 min, cytosolic PKC activity decreased by 81%, 74%, 63%, and 44%, whereas membrane-bound PKC activity increased by 83%, 44%, 28%, and 17%, respectively. The effects of PTH and PMA on PKC were dose dependent, with ED50 values of 0.3 nM PTH and 4 nM PMA. Chronic treatment of ROS cells for 3 days with PMA caused depletion of total PKC activity in cytosolic and membrane fractions to less than 10% of that in control cells. Conversely, chronic treatment of ROS cells with PTH did not deplete PKC. In addition, chronic treatment of ROS cells with PTH inhibited the responsiveness of PKC activity to subsequent acute PTH challenge, but not to acute PMA challenge, suggesting specific desensitization of this response by PTH. Activation of cytosolic PKC by diolein, phosphatidylserine, and calcium caused phosphorylation of many cytosolic proteins, including those having apparent mol wt of 39K, 35K, 33K, 25K, 19K, and 16K. Pretreatment of ROS cells with PTH resulted in a transient decrease in the phosphorylation of these cytosolic proteins by PKC. This decrease in cytosolic protein phosphorylation by treatment with PTH is temporally associated with PTH-stimulated translocation of PKC activity from the cytosol to the membranes. These data suggest a potential role for PKC in the mechanism of action of PTH in ROS cells.\r"

Under the trophic stimulation of elevated plasma TSH concentrations, the thyroid remnant responds with an increase in hormone synthesis and secretion and, in addition, increases in mass. We have examined the alterations in thyroid blood flow which accompany increased secretion and growth after hemithyroidectomy (HTX) in male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-220 g). At various times after surgical HTX (1, 2, and 3 weeks), blood samples for the determination of plasma hormone concentrations were obtained and tissue blood flows were determined using 15 +/- 5 microns diameter 141Ce-labeled microspheres in a modification of the reference sample microsphere technique. The microspheres were injected directly into the left cardiac ventricle via a 23-gauge needle passed through the chest wall while a reference blood sample was collected. After the animals were killed, tissues were cleaned and weighed, then tissue and reference blood sample radioactivities were determined. In addition, thyroidal immunoreactive vasoactive intestinal peptide was measured after acetic acid (0.67 N) extraction. After HTX, plasma TSH concentrations were significantly elevated. The plasma concentrations of T4 and T3 fell, but by less than the expected 50%. The mass of the remaining thyroid lobe increased progressively over the 3 weeks post thyroidectomy, reaching approximately 70% of the total thyroid gland weight of sham-operated controls. Thyroid blood flow per gram of tissue was significantly elevated at all times post HTX. HTX did not induce any alterations in thyroidal immunoreactive vasoactive intestinal peptide concentration. Thus, after HTX, the well documented compensatory alterations in thyroid remnant growth and secretion were accompanied by a prompt and striking increase in thyroid blood flow.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the role of thyroid hormone in the postnatal development of Ca2+ transport activity of sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal muscle (m. gastrocnemius-plantaris). With a Ca2+-stat method using the fluorescent dye fura 2 as Ca2+ indicator, we determined the oxalate-supported maximal Ca2+ uptake activity of sarcoplasmic reticulum in whole muscle homogenates from neonatal rats. Expressed per g tissue wet wt, the activity increased nearly 10-fold during the first 8 weeks after birth, following which time a plateau was reached. This development was absent in hypothyroid pups, in which the level of Ca2+ uptake activity remained constant at 10% of the normal adult value for at least 8 weeks. When the mothers were given 0.05% propylthiouracil in the drinking water 1 week before parturition, these pups ceased to grow after 4 weeks, had a reduced muscle protein content and a characteristic cretinous appearance. The effects of hypothyroidism could be reversed by T3 treatment (0.5 micrograms/100 g BW, daily) starting 1 or 6 weeks after birth. Treatment with bovine GH (0.1 or 0.5 IU/100 g BW; daily) starting on day 5 stimulated body growth, particularly of muscle, but was without effect on the failing development of Ca2+ uptake activity. The postnatal rise in citrate synthase and succinate dehydrogenase activities was impaired in the hypothyroid group, but lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase activities rose continuously, although at a reduced rate. T3 treatment also reversed these effects of propylthiouracil. At the higher dosage used bovine GH appeared to stimulate the accumulation of creatine kinase. We conclude that the failing postnatal development of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ transport activity in hypothyroidism is not secondary to the absence of GH, nor is it part of a general, indiscriminate effect, but, rather, that it indicates an absolute requirement of thyroid hormone for this particular aspect of muscle differentiation.\r"

IGF-1 from adult sheep is identical to human and bovine IGF-I, except for substitution in the sheep of Ala at residue 66 for Pro in the human and bovine polypeptides. IGF-II from adult sheep differs from bovine IGF-II also by a single amino acid, with residue 62 being Ala in ovine and Thr in bovine IGF-2. The first 10 amino-terminal residues of fetal sheep plasma IGF-I and 92% of the amino acids of fetal IGF-II were identified and found to be the same as those of the corresponding IGFs isolated from adult sheep. Ovine IGF-I was virtually equipotent with human IGF-I in growth-related bioassays and in a RIA for human and bovine IGF-I and inhibited the binding of radiolabeled human IGF-I to type I IGF receptors and to a pure IGF-binding protein. Ovine and bovine IGF-II were also found to be similar to each other in biological and immunochemical activities, and in their binding to type I and II IGF receptors and IGF-binding protein. As observed with human and bovine IGF-I and IGF-II, ovine IGF-I bound slightly better to type I IGF receptors than ovine IGF-II, but bound very poorly to type II IGF receptors. This study shows that IGFs from sheep are very similar to those of human and bovine in structure and activity and defines sensitive radioligand assays specific for ovine IGF-I and ovine IGF-II.\r"

  ".W": "Previously we have established that abnormal regulation of renal 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD)-1 alpha-hydroxylase in Hyp mice involves the PTH-adenylate cyclase component of enzyme activation. However, it remains unknown if the muted effects of PTH result from 1) abnormal second messenger production or 2) an intracellular defect limiting enzyme activation. To distinguish between these possibilities, we compared cAMP stimulation of renal 25OHD-1 alpha-hydroxylase in normal, phosphate-depleted normal, and Hyp mice. Administration of N6-monobutyryl cAMP iv (200 mg/kg/day) increased enzyme activity in normal (4.1 +/- 1.7 vs. 40.7 +/- 7.0 fmol/mg kidney.min) and phosphate-depleted mice (13.3 +/- 1.8 vs. 78.2 +/- 10.4) to a level significantly greater than that achieved in Hyp mice (7.4 +/- 1.1 vs. 22.7 +/- 3.6). Moreover, similar to our observations after PTH stimulation, the apparent abnormal cAMP effect did not result from an altered time course of enzyme activation or a rightward shift in the dose response. Collectively, these data indicate that abnormal regulation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D production in Hyp mice results from aberrant intracellular regulation of 25OHD-1 alpha-hydroxylase, a defect probably related to deranged phosphate transport in the renal tubule.\r"

Progesterone and PG secretion were measured on days 1, 11, and 18 of hCG-induced pseudopregnancy. The mean progesterone secretion increased significantly from days 1 to 11, and then decreased significantly by day 18. PG secretion was inversely correlated with progesterone secretion, suggesting that PG might inhibit progesterone secretion. To test this hypothesis, indomethacin, an inhibitor of PG secretion, was administered to intact rabbits from days 11-18 of pseudopregnancy and/or on day 18 ovaries were perfused in vitro with indomethacin. Indomethacin administered in vivo, in vitro, or both in vivo and in vitro significantly reduced PG secretion compared to that in controls, but did not affect progesterone secretion. In addition, perfusion of ovaries in vitro with PGF2 alpha did not alter progesterone secretion on either day 11 or day 18. Thus, although there is an inverse relationship between progesterone and PG secretion during pseudopregnancy, PGF2 alpha alone had no effect on progesterone secretion. These results question the hypothesis that PGF2 alpha alone is the luteolytic factor.\r"

In this study we report the isolation and characterization of a subclone of the MA-10 Leydig tumor cell line. Whereas there was no difference in basal steroid production between the clone (MA-10 LP) and the parent stock (MA-10), MA-10 LP produces very low levels of progesterone after stimulation by hCG or (Bu)2cAMP. In both cell populations, hCG stimulation resulted in the accumulation of comparable amounts of cAMP in the presence of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, and similar levels of cAMP were measured at 30 min without inhibitor. Measurement of cholesterol side-chain cleavage activity using two separate methods demonstrated that the low steroid production in MA-10 LP could not be accounted for by a decrease in the activity of this enzyme complex. Additionally, no difference in 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity could be demonstrated between the two cell populations. Since the lesion that attenuates the ability of MA-10 to synthesize progesterone is somewhere after the production of cAMP and before cholesterol side-chain cleavage activity, this system may provide a useful model for understanding the regulatory mechanisms controlling steroid biosynthesis in Leydig cells.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanisms by which central or systemic administration of galanin stimulates GH secretion were investigated in either conscious or urethane-anesthetized male rats. Intracerebroventricular injection of synthetic porcine galanin, a 29-amino acid gut-brain peptide (0.12, 0.6, and 3 nmol/rat), resulted in a dose-related increase in plasma GH. The plasma GH level was increased by an N-terminal galanin fragment [galanin-(1-19)], but not by C-terminal fragments [galanin-(2-29) and -(21-29)]. Intravenous injection or infusion of galanin (0.6 and 3 nmol/100 g BW) also raised plasma GH. The plasma GH increase induced by galanin was inhibited by pretreatment with rabbit antiserum specific for rat GRF. Pretreatment with yohimbine or phenoxybenzamine, alpha-adrenergic blockers, or picrotoxin, a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) antagonist, blunted the plasma GH increase induced by intracerebroventricular injection of galanin. On the other hand, the plasma GH increase induced by iv injection of galanin was suppressed by picrotoxin, but not by phenoxybenzamine. These findings suggest that 1) both central and systemic administration of galanin stimulate GH secretion in the rat; 2) the N-terminal structure of galanin is required to stimulate GH secretion; 3) the stimulating effect of galanin is mediated, at least in part, by hypothalamic GRF; and 4) central alpha-adrenergic and GABAergic mechanisms may be involved in GH release induced by central administration of galanin, whereas systemic injection of galanin stimulates GH release predominantly through GABAergic mechanisms in the rat.\r"

Previous experiments have suggested that this protein is related to the human androgen receptor and may be a proteolytic fragment of the intact protein. In the present study the biochemical properties of the covalently radiolabeled protein were compared to those of the classically defined human androgen receptor radiolabeled noncovalently with [3H]dihydrotestosterone. The radiolabeled proteins were indistinguishable by gel filtration chromatography, sucrose density gradient centrifugation analysis, chromatofocusing, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Both ligands labeled a protein with an apparent Stokes radius of 4.4 nm under high salt conditions. Analysis on sucrose density gradients showed peaks of 4.6S and 9.2S with either ligand. The protein radiolabeled with either ligand chromatofocused as two isoforms, a predominant form with a pI of about 5.4 and a minor isoform with a pI of about 4.5. Both radiolabeled proteins were found to have a high degree of hydrophobicity and eluted identically from a phenyl-Sepharose column. While the radiolabeled proteins were qualitatively indistinguishable, significantly more radiolabeled protein was quantitated using the affinity ligand. These data suggest that the affinity ligand may recognize precursor or degraded forms of the receptor that do not bind the natural ligand or that assays based on the use of noncovalent ligands could underestimate the receptor content of target cells.\r"

To explore the mechanism(s) regulating the peak release of relaxin and secretion of progesterone by aging corpora lutea and to examine the direct effect of purified porcine (p) PRL on such corpora lutea, hypophysial stalk transection (HST), hypophysectomy (HYPOX) with or without PRL replacement, and sham operation control (SOC) were conducted on day 110 (estrus = day 0) on purebred Yorkshire gilts that were hysterectomized on days 6-8. The pPRL (0.5 mg every 6 h daily) or PBS (0.5 ml every 6 h daily) was given iv from days 110-120. HYPOX + pPRL, HYPOX + PBS, HST + PBS, and SOC + PBS formed four experimental groups. Peak relaxin concentrations in peripheral plasma (mean values ranged from 22-24 ng/ml) occurred on about day 113 for all groups [113.4 +/- 0.3 days (+/- SE)] regardless of the different surgical interventions. After peak release, relaxin decreased steadily in the HYPOX + PBS group, falling to less than 1.0 ng/ml by 6 days later, whereas relaxin in other groups remained elevated (approximately 7 ng/ml). In the HYPOX plus PBS group, progesterone decreased abruptly, remaining below 1 ng/ml from 1 week onward, lower (P less than 0.01) than that in controls (approximately 19 ng/ml); in the HYPOX + pPRL group, progesterone levels (approximately 17 ng/ml) remained similar (P greater than 0.05) to those in controls (approximately 19 ng/ml) and the HST + PBS group (approximately 15 ng/ml). These results clearly reveal that the pituitary gland plays no direct role in regulating the timed peak release of relaxin from aging corpora lutea in hysterectomized gilts and that the peak release of relaxin on about day 113 is preprogrammed and inherent within such aging luteal cells. This study provides strong evidence that purified pPRL maintains both relaxin and progesterone secretion as well as the morphology of aging corpora lutea for at least 10 days after hypophysectomy in hysterectomized gilts.\r"

  ".U": "89136906\r", 
  ".W": "Aging is characterized by a decreased secretion of thyroid hormones in rats associated with unchanged plasma TSH suggestive of impairments in the hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid axis. Since it is known that pituitary T3 is more determinant on TSH secretion than plasma T3, we measured in young (4 months) and old (26 months) male rats the concentration of T3 in the anterior pituitary gland and found that it was similar in young and old animals despite the low circulating levels of thyroid hormones. This was suggestive of age-related differences in the intrapituitary T4 to T3 conversion. We therefore determined the activity of 5'-deiodinase (5'-D, type I and type II) in the adenohypophysis and investigated possible age-related changes in this enzyme activity in peripheral tissues by its determination in the thyroid gland and liver (type I) of young and old rats. Intrapituitary 5'-D activity was increased in old compared to young rats (type I 5'-D: 4.59 +/- 0.13 vs. 2.92 +/- 0.33 pmol rT3/h x mg protein; type II: 0.54 +/- 0.5 vs. 0.21 +/- 0.03 pmol rT3/h x mg protein; P less than 0.001). In contrast, in the thyroid gland and in the liver, type I 5'-D was reduced with age (4.7 +/- 0.6 vs. 7.4 +/- 0.8 and 3.1 +/- 0.4 vs. 5.6 +/- 0.5 nmol rT3/h x mg protein, respectively; P less than 0.01). These data are illustrative of age-related changes in the activity of 5'-D, different according to the tissues in agreement with the known tissue-specific regulation of the 5'-Ds. The reduced activity of 5'-D in the thyroid and liver of old rats is indicative of an impaired thyroid hormones disposal in peripheral tissues with age. In contrast, in the adenohypophysis of old rats, the increase in the activity of 5'-D is similar to that reported in hypothyroid animals and suggests the development with age of an adaptative mechanism in the presence of low circulating thyroid hormones; this mechanism leads to unchanged intrapituitary concentration of T3 and consequently to unaltered plasma levels of TSH in old rats.\r"

  ".W": "Testosterone is secreted by the fetal testis during gestation, and this is thought to influence certain aspects of the brain's subsequent development. To study this action at the neuronal level, nine macaque fetuses were injected with 250 microCi [3H]testosterone via the umbilical vein at about 120 days gestation. After 60 min, samples of brain and peripheral tissue were studied by autoradiography or HPLC. Purified nuclear pellets were prepared, and radioactivity in ether extracts was fractionated by HPLC and identified by coelution with internal standard steroids. Concentrations of radioactivity were significantly higher (P less than 0.05) in the hypothalamus-preoptic area than in amygdala, hippocampus, midbrain, and cerebral and cerebellar cortexes, and most of the radioactivity (75%) in the hypothalamus-preoptic area coeluted with 17 beta-estradiol. Radioactivity coeluting with 17 beta-estradiol was also detected in nuclear fractions from amygdala (44%). In contrast, 80% of the radioactivity extracted from pituitary gland nuclei coeluted with testosterone. Most of the neurons labeled in autoradiograms were located in the hypothalamus and preoptic area, fewer were found in the amygdala, and labeling in the frontal or motor cortex did not exceed chance levels. Results suggested that aromatization and, consequently, estrogen receptors play a role in the effects of testosterone on the hypothalamus and amygdala of the primate fetus at this stage of development.\r"

We purified the resultant peptides on HPLC columns, determined their amino acid sequences and the locations of [125I]T4 and [125I]T3 residues, and compared them with established sequences from humans, cows, rabbits, rats, and guinea pigs. We found five major T4 peptides, three of which were homologous with the major hormonogenic sites A, B, and D of mammalian Tg. Site A, the highly conserved major T4 site in mammals, had substitutions in three residues near the T4 residue and had much less of Tg's newly synthesized T4 than is found in mammalian Tg (25% in turtle vs. 44% in rabbit). Site B contained correspondingly more of Tg's new T4 (42% vs. 24% in rabbit). Turtle Tg contained little [125I]T3, and we did not find site C (Ser-T3/T4-Ser, the major T3 site in guinea pig and rabbit) in turtles, but did find Val-T4, a possible homolog. Site D was quantitatively less important than in mammals. The fifth turtle hormonogenic site, containing 12% of Tg's newly formed T4, had a tyrosyl residue substituted for the phenylalanine at residue 632 in the human sequence. We conclude that Tg's major hormonogenic sites are generally conserved across a considerable evolutionary distance, but that differences in primary structure occur and may contribute to changes in priority of hormone synthesis among these sites.\r"

  ".U": "89136910\r", 
  ".W": "At 90 days gestation a uniquely fetal-type and an adult-type corticotroph have been observed in the fetal sheep pars distalis (term approximately 147 days). Between 90 and 130 days gestation the fetal type is predominant, and its numbers decline toward term. In this study the effect of the endogenous cortisol surge on the change in the population of corticotrophs in the pars distalis was investigated in sheep fetuses after bilateral adrenalectomy at 120 days gestation or after an infusion of 2 mg cortisol/day between 109 and 115 days gestation. The total proportion of corticotrophs, expressed as a percentage, decreased significantly (P less than 0.01) from 115 days in saline-infused controls (21.09 +/- 1.10%) and 135 days in intact controls (14.59 +/- 1.12%). The percentage of adult-type corticotrophs increased significantly (P less than 0.01) from 5.65 +/- 0.77 at 115 days, to 11.93 +/- 1.41 at 135 days. The percentage of fetal-type corticotrophs decreased significantly (P less than 0.001) from 14.91 +/- 0.35 at 115 days to 2.33 +/- 0.48 at 135 days. A small proportion of ACTH-immunoreactive cells could not be defined as either adult- or fetal-type corticotrophs. These changes in the corticotroph population had not occurred at 135 days in fetuses that had been adrenalectomized at 120 days; the percentage of corticotrophs relative to unstained cells (21.70 +/- 0.46%), the percentage of adult-type corticotrophs (6.42 +/- 0.29%), and the percentage of fetal-type corticotrophs (14.65 +/- 0.49%) were similar to those in 115-day-old fetuses, indicating that the normal change in the corticotroph population between 115 and 135 days gestation was dependent upon the presence of the fetal adrenal. In fetuses exposed to exogenous cortisol between 109 and 115 days gestation, the percentage of corticotrophs relative to unstained cells (16.53 +/- 1.68%), the percentage of adult-type corticotrophs (12.40 +/- 1.34%), and the percentage of fetal-type corticotrophs (3.78 +/- 0.58%) were similar to those at 135 days. This indicates that a short period of increased fetal plasma cortisol can bring about premature maturation of the corticotrophs in the fetal sheep pars distalis. We have also described an ACTH-immunoreactive cell which has characteristics of both an adult- and a fetal-type corticotroph. Its morphological appearance suggests that it may be a transitional stage from the fetal- to the adult-type corticotroph.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

To analyze the role played by tissue monodeiodination in this state, circulating levels of thyronines as well as hepatic and mammary 5'-monodeiodinative activity (5'MA) were assessed during lactation in rats. Results show that the serum iodothyronine changes that accompany lactation are associated with a significant decrease in hepatic 5'MA and a simultaneous increase in mammary 5'MA. These changes begin within the first postpartum day, are proportional to lactation intensity (litter size), and disappear 48 h after either precocious (1st postpartum day) or natural (21st postpartum day) weaning. These data demonstrate that the compartmentalized change in energy expenditure characteristic of lactation is accompanied by organ-specific and opposite adjustments in hepatic and mammary monodeiodinative pathways.\r"

  ".U": "89136913\r", 
  ".W": "Gonadal involvement in the control of fetal LH secretion was examined by studying LH pulsatility in 12 chronically catheterized male (9 castrate and 3 sham-control) and 12 female (8 castrate and 4 sham-control) ovine fetuses operated upon in utero at 106-116 days gestation (term = 147 days). Fetuses were studied longitudinally over a 2- to 30-day period in castrates and over a 2- to 37-day period in controls. LH pulsatility was determined from blood samples obtained every 15 min over a standard 3-h observation period and assayed for LH by RIA (NIH LH S16 standard). In female fetuses there was no significant difference in LH pulse frequency between castrates (25 pulses in 32 periods; 1 pulse/3.8 h of observation) compared to controls (15 pulses in 15 periods; 1 pulse/3.0 h). LH pulse frequency was similar in the sham-castrate males (11 pulses in 17 periods; 1 pulse/4.6 h). In contrast, LH pulse frequency was significantly higher in the castrate male group (90 pulses in 42 periods; 1 pulse/1.4 h) compared to that in each of the other 3 groups (P less than 0.005). LH pulse frequency did not vary with gestational age in castrate and control females or in control males. In castrate males, however, LH pulse frequency declined significantly (P less than 0.005) with advancing gestation from 80 pulses in 32 periods (1 pulse/1.2 h) before 130 days compared to 10 pulses in 10 periods (1 pulse/3.0 h) after 130 days. Thus, LH pulse frequency was indistinguishable in castrate vs. eugonadal males after 130 days. The absence of a castration effect on LH pulsatility in male fetuses older than 130 days was confirmed in an additional group of 8 male fetuses (5 castrate and 3 sham-controls) operated upon at 121-130 days gestation and studied over a 2- to 20-day period. Overall, LH pulse amplitude was similar in male [4.7 +/- 0.5 ng/ml (+/- SE)] and female (3.9 +/- 0.5 ng/ml) fetuses and did not vary as a function of gonadal status or gestational age. The postcastration increment in LH pulse frequency in the castrate male fetus from 108-130 days gestation delineates a role of the fetal testis in feedback regulation of LH secretion at this stage of development. The absence of a postcastration rise in LH pulse frequency in the castrate female indicates that the fetal ovary does not play a similar role.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In the present study the heterogeneity of POMC mRNA content in dispersed rat pituitary cells has been investigated. Acutely dispersed cells from adult male rat anterior or neurointermediate lobe tissues were adhered to poly-L-lysine-coated coverslips. The cells were fixed and then hybridized with 35S-labeled POMC or 1B15 (cyclophilin) cRNA. Parallel studies measuring constitutively expressed cellular 1B15 mRNA content were undertaken to ensure that the apparent single cell differences in POMC mRNA were not inherent to the in situ hybridization procedure. When classified by image analysis, extensive differences in silver grain densities were seen over POMC mRNA-containing cells from both lobes. To determine if mRNA in polysomal configurations was less accessable for hybridization with probes than naked mRNA, cells were preincubated with pactamycin, a potent inhibitor of ribosomal initiation of protein synthesis. Pactamycin had no effect on these results. Thus, there appears to be large differences in POMC mRNA content between individual pituitary cells expressing the same gene product.\r"

Lithium significantly inhibited T3 and T4 release from TSH-stimulated mouse thyroids. This inhibitory effect on thyroid hormone release was dependent on the concentration of lithium. Under continuous stimulation with TSH and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, both cAMP release and cAMP content were significantly decreased by lithium. In addition, we studied the effect of lithium on (Bu)2cAMP-stimulated thyroid hormone release. T3 and T4 release was stimulated by (Bu)2cAMP in a similar way to TSH. Lithium significantly inhibited (Bu)2 cAMP-stimulated T3 and T4 release from perifused mouse thyroids. These results suggest that lithium inhibits the action of TSH in the thyroid gland by both suppression of cAMP production and inhibition at a step beyond cAMP generation.\r"

  ".W": "Traditionally, aromatase has been quantified as aromatase activity according to its ability to produce estrogen from androgen. We have developed a quantitative assay based on the protein mass of catalytically active aromatase cytochrome P-450. A solid phase sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for aromatase cytochrome P-450 has been devised using mouse monoclonal antibody (MAb3-2C2) and rabbit polyclonal antiserum (PAb R-8-2). Two rabbit antisera (PAb R-8-1 and R-8-2) were raised by immunization against human placental aromatase cytochrome P-450 which had been isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography of MAb3-2C2-coupled to Sepharose 4B resin. Both antisera were capable of suppressing human placental aromatase activity with IC50 values of 0.6 and 0.8 microliter/ml incubate, respectively, and showed monospecific to aromatase cytochrome P-450 in the Western blot analyses. Solubilized human placental microsomal samples were incubated in microtiter wells precoated with MAb3-2C2. The unbound proteins were washed out, and the aromatase cytochrome P-450 bound with the MAb3-2C2 in the wells was then reacted with PAb R-8-2, the binding of which was subsequently probed with goat antirabbit immunoglobulin G antibody alkaline phosphatase conjugate. Immunoaffinity-purified aromatase cytochrome P-450 of human placental microsomes was used for the standard, with the current assay detection limit at 1 ng/ml. There was a positive correlation between aromatase activity and the immunoreactive aromatase cytochrome P-450 level in solubilized microsomal samples after preincubation at 22 and 37 C, indicating that the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measures the level of aromatase cytochrome P-450 that has catalytic activity. The mean level of aromatase cytochrome P-450 in solubilized human term placental microsomes was 16.4 +/- 10.3 (+/- SD) micrograms/ml, corresponding to 0.38 +/- 0.19% of the original microsomes. The mean specific activity of aromatization of the solubilized samples was 0.650 +/- 0.163 nmol estrogen formed/min.mg protein. These results indicate that aromatase in the solubilized placental microsomal fraction has catalytic ability of 5.3 +/- 1.6 min-1 based on the immunoassayable cytochrome P-450.\r"

The mice bearing TNF-producing tumors were significantly hypercalcuric compared to mice bearing control tumors, but urinary cAMP excretion was unchanged. Mice bearing Chinese hamster ovary cell tumors containing the empty vector did not demonstrate hypercalcemia or increased bone resorption. This model system using transfected cells to continuously produce cytokines in vivo is more analogous to the pathophysiological conditions present in patients than intermittent injections and can produce much longer exposures than infusion pumps. Such model systems should allow a better understanding of the role of factors involved in humoral hypercalcemia.\r"

The objectives of the present experiments were to characterize the following aspects of PYY metabolism: the distribution of PYY in the canine gastrointestinal tract, the release of PYY in response to oral ingestion of a mixed meal or intraduodenal (ID) administration of oleic acid, the effect of ileocolectomy on the release of PYY in response to ID administration of oleic acid when transit of chyme to the distal ileum and colon is prevented, the effect of interruption of intramural neural pathways of the small bowel on the release of PYY, and the effect of iv cholecystokinin on the release of PYY. The results of these experiments demonstrate that PYY immunoreactivity is distributed primarily in the terminal ileum, colon, and rectum. Circulating levels of PYY increase significantly (P less than 0.05) within 10-30 min after ingestion of a meal or to ID administration of a fatty acid. Complete interruption of the flow of chyme to the site of PYY-containing cells (i.e. ileum-colon) did not block the release of PYY; however, ileocolectomy abolished the release of PYY in response to ID administration of oleic acid. Severance of intramural neural pathways along the small bowel did not alter the release of PYY in response to an oral meal. Intravenous administration of graded doses of cholecystokinin stimulated the release of PYY in a dose-related manner. The results of these experiments indicate that the release of PYY from the distal ileum and colon is controlled, at least in part, by an extramural neural, endocrine, or a combination of both types of mechanisms which originate in the foregut.\r"

  ".W": "The role of the pituitary gland in the regulation of the plasma concentrations of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) in the late gestation sheep fetus has been examined. Singleton sheep fetuses were either hypophysectomized or sham-operated between days 110-120 of gestation. Blood samples were then collected via carotid cannulae at least three times weekly for the remainder of gestation. In some hypophysectomized fetuses T4 was administered (100 g/day) to overcome the hypothyroidism caused by hypophysectomy. Blood samples were also obtained from lambs during the perinatal period, neonatal lambs within 1-10 days after birth, and pregnant and nonpregnant adult ewes. All plasma samples were subjected to Sephadex G-50 gel filtration under acidic conditions (pH 2.3) to eliminate IGF-binding protein activity. The fractions containing the free IGF peptides were collected and assayed for IGF-I by heterologous RIA, and IGF-II by a homologous RRA. Plasma concentrations of IGF-I and IGF-II did not change with advancing gestational age in any fetal group and were not affected by the prolonged gestation that results from hypophysectomy. The mean plasma IGF-I and IGF-II concentrations in the sham fetuses were 112 +/- 8 and 1340 +/- 112 ng/ml, respectively. Hypophysectomy without thyroid hormone replacement resulted in a significant decrease in plasma IGF-I concentrations to 50 +/- 5 ng/ml, whereas IGF-II concentrations were not affected (1096 +/- 124 ng/ml). IGF-I concentrations in the hypophysectomized fetuses that received T4 were significantly increased (67 +/- 6.0 ng/ml) compared to those in the hypophysectomized fetuses that did not receive T4. The IGF-II concentrations in the hypophysectomized fetuses that received T4 were similar to those in the sham-operated fetuses (1120 +/- 112 ng/ml). At term IGF-I concentrations were increased (180 +/- 21 ng/ml) and IGF-II concentrations were decreased (264 +/- 25 ng/ml) compared to fetal values. Plasma IGF-I concentrations in the prepubertal lamb were similar to the fetal values. Pregnancy in the adult ewe was associated with a significant increase in IGF-II, but had no effect on IGF-I plasma concentrations. These data show that circulating IGF-I concentrations in the fetal lamb are under some pituitary and thyroid control, whereas IGF-II concentrations are independently of pituitary or thyroid status. We confirm, using a homologous assay, that fetal IGF-II concentrations are high and then decrease at term. These data also support the concept that a pregnancy-related factor may regulate plasma IGF-II concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

PAF-induced PRL release was dose dependent, with threshold stimulation at 1 nM and maximal stimulation at 100 nM. Stimulation occurred as early as 1 min of incubation and persisted for 2 h. The action of PAF on PRL release is consistent with a receptor-mediated mechanism based on the observations that the action of PAF is blocked by dopamine agonists and the PAF receptor antagonists L 652731 and SRI 63072. The structural analogs 1-O-alkyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, which lack the biological activity of PAF, are not able to stimulate PRL release over the dose range 0.2-2 microM. In addition, the PAF precursor lyso PAF and diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (phosphatidylcholine) were ineffective in stimulating PRL release. PAF induced the secretion of PRL and GH but not that of LH or TSH from hemipituitaries in short term incubations. PAF did not effect PRL release from GH3 cells. In conclusion, these data indicate that PAF stimulates PRL release from primary cultures of rat anterior pituitary cells in a dose-related, rapid, and specific manner.\r"

  ".W": "In this study we have attempted to determine which of the secreted 24K isoforms was responsible for autocrine regulation of PRL secretion by comparing the isoforms synthesized and secreted by normal cells, which do autoregulate, with those synthesized and secreted by GH3 cells, which do not normally autoregulate. Comparable numbers of cells were washed free of serum and then extracted into Tris-buffered saline by sonication and detergent treatment. Proteins present in these cell extracts and in samples of culture medium were then precipitated with cold acetone (-20 C; 48 h) and subsequently dissolved in urea-lysis buffer for 2-dimensional (2-D) electrophoresis. The 2-D patterns for normal cells showed four 24K PRL isoforms inside the cells and three 24K PRL isoforms (designated 2, 3, and 3') secreted into the medium. The 2-D patterns for GH3 cells showed very little intracellular storage of PRL, but what was present was identified as 24K PRL isoform 2. The GH3 cells secreted large amounts of only 24K PRL isoform 2. Preparations of PRL containing only isoforms 1,2, and 3 (at a total radioimmunoassayable concentration of 5 micrograms/ml PRL) were capable of inducing autoregulation in GH3 cells, as evidence by decreased secretion of prelabeled intracellular PRL. Initiation of autoregulation in GH3 cells caused granulation and the intracellular production of isoform 3. Since a) a preparation containing isoforms 1, 2, and 3 was found to induce autoregulation in GH3 cells, b) isoform 1 is not a secreted form, and c) isoform 2 does not cause autoregulation (at least in GH3 cells), it is deduced that isoform 3 is an autocrine form of PRL. Since initiation of autoregulation in GH3 cells caused those cells to produce isoform 3, it is further deduced that the autoregulatory defect in GH3 cells lies in the actual lack of production of isoform 3 and not in an inherent inability of these cells to produce isoform 3.\r"

  ".W": "Thymocytes are known to possess receptors for glucocorticoids (GC) as well as for alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3]. We have now investigated the distribution of the receptors for GC and 1,25-(OH)2D3 in rat thymocytes and compared the effects of the two steroid hormones on short term primary cultures of these cells. We report that in thymic cells, as in other tissues, 1,25-(OH)2D3 and GC bind specifically to distinct receptor molecules which exhibit sedimentation coefficients of 3.3S and 3.7S, respectively. Furthermore, the thymocytes that express the 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor belong to a different and distinct subpopulation than the cells that express the glucocorticoid receptor. Specifically, by separating the thymocytes into two subsets by means of agglutination with the lectin peanut agglutinin (PNA), we have determined that the 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor-positive cells belong to the PNA-negative medullary mature subset, whereas the GC receptor-positive cells belong to the PNA-positive cortical immature subset of thymocytes. Finally, we have compared the effects of the two steroid hormones on primary cultures of each of the two subsets as well as on unseparated thymocytes and found that GC act on PNA-positive cells to induce cell lysis; this leads to an enrichment in 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor-positive thymocytes, as indicated by an apparent increase (6-fold) in the 1,25-(OH)2D3 binding in the cells surviving at the end of the culture. In contrast, we found that 1,25-(OH)2D3 acts on the PNA-negative cells to decrease the rate of cell lysis. These data indicates that the target cells for GC and 1,25-(OH)2D3 in the thymus are distinct and that these two hormones exert a different regulatory influence on the gland.\r"

The Mabs were further characterized in terms of their cross-reactivity with human placental lactogen, human PRL, with recombinant hGH molecules (MetLeu8hGH, Met14hGH), and with fragments derived from enzymatic or chemical digestion of hGH. These studies provided information on the antigenic sites that are shared with human placental lactogen and on the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the hGH molecule. Based upon these findings, we tentatively suggest the epitope model for hGH comprising at least 10 antigenic sites (epitopes) which may be grouped into five antigenic regions.\r"

One form, G1-hPRL, was only slightly retarded by Con-A; the other, G2-hPRL, was adsorbed by Con-A and could be eluted with methyl-D-manno-pyranoside, an indication of differing carbohydrate units in the two G-PRLs. Differences in type of glycosylation were also indicated by HPLC peptide mapping of tryptic digests of the two forms. The elution time for the tryptic peptide carrying the asparagine-linked carbohydrate unit varied for the two G-PRLs. The results point to the asparagine at position 31 as being the site of attachment of the carbohydrate. The carbohydrate structure influenced the crop sac-stimulating activity of the G-hPRLs. G1-hPRL had only about one fourth the activity of the reference standard (nonglycosylated ovine PRL, 35 IU/mg). The form that bound to Con-A, G2-hPRL, was equipotent to the reference standard. Because glycosylated forms have varying biological activities and are major components of circulating PRL, the physiological significance of serum concentrations of PRL measured by RIA will have to be reevaluated.\r"

Fluorescence polarization studies conducted 24 h after sc injection of PGF2 alpha revealed a marked and significant increase in the polarization parameter, which is suggestive of reduced plasma membrane fluidity. At the same time, there was a decrease in hCG binding and a significant increase in apparent phospholipase-A2 activity during incubation of dispersed rat luteal cells. Each of these changes was attenuated when the animals were pretreated with PRL 30 min before PGF2 alpha. The decrease in plasma progesterone caused by PGF2 alpha treatment was also inhibited by PRL. PGF2 alpha also stimulated a significant polarization increase in dispersed cells prepared from ovaries removed 1 h after injection of this luteolytic agent, although this effect could not be demonstrated in plasma membrane samples. These results indicate that PRL and PGF2 alpha affect the same membrane pathway in the rat corpus luteum and that this pathway appears to be closely coupled to luteal cell function.\r"

[3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA and cell counts were used as measures of cell proliferation. The percentage of cells that stained for alkaline phosphatase was used as a measure of differentiation. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) enhanced mouse osteoblastic cell proliferation in a dose dependent manner over a wide range of doses (10(-8) to 10(-11) molar), and was maximally active at 10(-9) M. DHT also stimulated proliferation in human osteoblast cell cultures and in cultures of the human osteosarcoma cell line, TE89. Testosterone, fluoxymesterone (a synthetic androgenic steroid) and methenolone (an anabolic steroid) were also mitogenic in the mouse bone cell system. The mitogenic effect of DHT on bone cells was inhibited by antiandrogens (hydroxyflutamide and cyproterone acetate) which compete for binding to the androgen receptor. In addition to effects on cell proliferation, DHT increased the percentage of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) positive cells in all three bone cell systems tested, and this effect was inhibited by antiandrogens. We conclude that androgens can stimulate human and murine osteoblastic cell proliferation in vitro, and induce expression of the osteoblast-line differentiation marker ALP, presumably by an androgen receptor mediated mechanism.\r"

When exposed to normal medium Ca2+ (1.0 mM), 1,25-(OH)2D3 increased calbindin-D28K mRNA, as measured by Northern analysis, by 4-10 fold over basal levels by 12 to 24 h after addition of hormone. In the presence of 0.5 mM Ca2+, 1,25-(OH)2D3 induced calbindin-D28K mRNA by only 2 fold, whereas, when cells were exposed to 2 mM Ca2+, the induction was 10-15 fold. This calcium modulation of 1,25-(OH)2D3 induction was also observed at the level of calbindin-D28K protein concentrations as measured by radioimmunoassay. The alterations in medium Ca2+ were not associated with any change in the rate of total RNA or protein synthesis. These studies suggest that both Ca2+ and 1,25-(OH)2D3 participate in the regulation of calbindin-D28K gene expression in the kidney.\r"

B (50, 100 and 500 micrograms/rat) and F (1 mg/rat) were found to possess no intrinsic antinatriuretic activity which is represented by a decrease in the Na+ to creatinine ratio; while only B (500 micrograms/rat) demonstrated kaliuretic effects as indicated by an increase in K+ to creatinine ratios. B and F showed very significant antinatriuretic and kaliuretic properties following pretreatment with CS (2.5 mg/rat). CS alone was not found to be antinatriuretic at this dosage. Further experiments demonstrated that lower dosages of CS (500 and 1,000 micrograms/rat) also cause B to exhibit Na+ retaining and K+ excreting properties. Thus, we have demonstrated that pretreatment with CS can confer mineralocorticoid-like activity upon the glucocorticoids B and F.\r"

Bladders from control rats, animals subjected to 4-5 wk streptozocin-induced diabetes, and rats subjected to equivalent diuresis produced by 5% sucrose feeding were studied with an in vitro whole-bladder preparation and neurochemical measurements. The diuretic group was used to distinguish alterations produced by metabolic effects on nerve and muscle from those induced by prolonged periods of excessive diuresis. Diuresis alone explains many of the diabetes-induced effects, including decreased norepinephrine levels, postsynaptic supersensitivity for sympathetic regulation of bladder storage, decreased responsiveness to parasympathetic regulation of emptying, and enhanced prostaglandin F2 alpha-induced contraction. Other diabetes-induced effects were not observed in the diuretic controls and are presumed to result from metabolic alterations associated with diabetes. These effects were decreases in norepinephrine uptake and in choline acetyltransferase activity, both markers of nerve terminal function. Thus, diuretic and metabolic factors appear to contribute to the early signs of parasympathetic and sympathetic neuropathy. In contrast, we found no evidence for loss of sensory nerve function in the diabetic bladder, at least at the organ level, because no diabetes- or diuresis-induced changes were observed in responsiveness to substance P or capsaicin.\r"

  ".W": "The best evidence that viruses have a causative role in the pathogenesis of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus comes from experiments in mice infected with encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus. When SJL/J male mice were inoculated with a highly diabetogenic EMC-D virus, diabetes developed in 95% of the animals. In contrast, none of the mice inoculated with a nondiabetogenic EMC-B virus became diabetic. Tissue culture experiments showed that EMC-B induces considerable amounts of interferon, whereas EMC-D does not. Despite these differences, EMC-D and EMC-B could not be distinguished antigenically by a sensitive plaque-neutralization assay. Furthermore, the buoyant density in CsCl density gradients and the capsid proteins of these two variants on polyacrylamide gels could not be distinguished. Molecular-hybridization studies with radiolabeled DNA complementary to EMC-D and EMC-B RNAs failed to distinguish them. Determination of complete nucleotide sequences of EMC-D and EMC-B revealed that EMC-D (7829 bases) differs from EMC-B (7825 bases) by only 14 nucleotides. The differences consist of two deletions of five nucleotides, one base insertion, and eight point mutations. The first deletion of three nucleotides and the second deletion of two nucleotides are located in the 5'-poly(C) tract and the 3'-end polyadenylation site, respectively. One base insertion in EMC-B occurs in the 5'-noncoding region. The eight point mutations are located in the polyprotein-coding region. Two of them are silent, whereas the other six mutations, one located on the L gene and five on the VP1 gene, introduce amino acid changes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Untreated streptozocin-induced diabetic (STZ-D) rats have previously been shown to have significantly increased hypothalamic concentrations of neuropeptide Y (NPY), a regulatory peptide that powerfully stimulates eating and drinking and inhibits secretion of several pituitary hormones when injected centrally. Tissue NPY concentrations have been measured by radioimmunoassay in selected hypothalamic regions microdissected from fresh, unfixed brain slices to localize diabetes-associated NPY changes precisely within the hypothalamus. Significant (35-200%) increases in NPY concentrations (P less than .01 vs. matched nondiabetic controls) were found in specific hypothalamic regions between 3 and 14 wk after induction of STZ-D. These regions included the paraventricular and ventromedial nuclei and lateral hypothalamic area, major appetite-regulating areas that are sensitive to the hyperphagic and polydipsic actions of NPY. Increased NPYergic activity in these areas may, at least partly, drive the increased eating and drinking characteristic of STZ-D. NPY concentrations were also increased in the arcuate nucleus and medial preoptic area. Because both of these regions are important in modulating pituitary hormone secretion, local NPY increases may be involved in the impaired secretion of luteinizing hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, growth hormone, and prolactin known to occur in STZ-D. Our finding of NPY increases in specific hypothalamic nuclei associated with functional changes found in STZ-D suggests that this peptide may have a role in the altered metabolic and neuroendocrine regulation of the syndrome.\r"

Thirty-day mortality was greater in the diabetic group (27 vs. 17%). However, diabetic patients were older and had more cardiovascular disease before MI. Analyses accounting for such baseline risk revealed a complex effect of diabetes. The relative risk (RR) of dying from MI due to diabetes was greatest among patients with lowest baseline risk (RR 7.3) and least among those at highest baseline risk (RR 0.83). These effects were most striking with transmural MI, which was highly lethal for those with diabetes. Analyses with pulmonary edema as the endpoint support the significant risk conferred by diabetes and its interaction with baseline risk. Diabetes is a risk factor for poor outcome after MI, particularly among patients whose pre-MI cardiovascular status otherwise appears normal.\r"

Eleven of 54 (20%) weaned NOD mice had CIAA levels above the range (greater than 39 nU/ml) of 81 control mice. The group of NOD mice that progressed to diabetes had a significantly higher level of CIAAs than NOD mice that did not progress to diabetes (NOD mice progressing to diabetes: CIAA 63 +/- 12 nU/ml; NOD mice not progressing to diabetes: CIAA 8 +/- 4 nU/ml; P less than .02).

  ".W": "Hypertriglyceridemic patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) have an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and acute pancreatitis. To examine the potential of hypolipidemic drugs for therapy of lipoprotein abnormalities in NIDDM, 10 patients maintaining marked (plasma triglycerides greater than 500 mg/dl) and 6 with moderate (plasma triglycerides 250-500 mg/dl) hypertriglyceridemia, despite good glycemic control, were studied in two phases. In the first phase, gemfibrozil alone (600 mg twice daily) was compared with a placebo, and in the second phase a combination of gemfibrozil and lovastatin (20 mg twice daily) was compared with gemfibrozil alone in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. In markedly hypertriglyceridemic patients, gemfibrozil reduced plasma triglycerides by 52% and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-chol) by 55% and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 23% compared with a placebo. However, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-chol) levels increased (42%), and LDL apolipoprotein B (apoB) levels remained unchanged. Addition of lovastatin to gemfibrozil effectively reduced total cholesterol (25%), LDL-chol (30%), and LDL-apoB (19%). Lovastatin further reduced plasma triglycerides (11%) and VLDL-chol (27%). However, in moderately hypertriglyceridemic patients, gemfibrozil or the combination therapy did not seem to offer benefits over the previously reported study with lovastatin alone. Glycemic control was maintained throughout the study. In conclusion, the beneficial effects of the combination therapy on lipoprotein levels in markedly hypertriglyceridemic NIDDM patients could decrease the risk of development of both acute pancreatitis and CHD.\r"

  ".W": "Sciatic nerve from the Wistar fatty diabetic (FD) rat, a prospective model for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, was investigated to determine the content of carbohydrates and to measure the incorporation of 32P into phosphoinositides and proteins. This strain has been shown to develop structural abnormalities in nerves and to exhibit reduced conduction velocity. Males became diabetic between the ages of 8 and 10 wk and were maintained together with lean sibling controls until the animals were either 22 or 44 wk old. Throughout this period, FD rats displayed moderate hyperglycemia. The carbohydrate profile of FD rat sciatic nerve exhibited modest increases in glucose, fructose, and sorbitol levels and significantly reduced myo-inositol concentrations, which were comparable at both ages. When nerves from 22-wk-old animals were incubated with [32P]orthophosphate and incorporation of radioactivity into phospholipids was measured, an increase in isotope uptake into phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate in the distal portions of tissue from the FD rat was observed. This effect was more pronounced in nerves from 44-wk-old rats. Phosphorylation of the major myelin protein P0 was 70% higher in the most distal portion of FD sciatic nerve from 22-wk-old animals. A comparable rise in phosphorylation of P0 as well as the large (P1) and small (Pr) myelin basic proteins occurred in nerves from 44-wk-old rats. In these animals, an approximately 50% decrease in the uptake of 32P into P0 and P1 in the most proximal region of FD nerve was also apparent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These injuries among the elderly lead to permanent change in health care status in over 40% of such accidents, and their prevention could significantly reduce morbidity associated with aging. Recommendations to promote burn prevention include reducing the temperature of hot water at the tap, introducing self-extinguishing cigarettes, and placing smoke detectors in all residences.\r"

Mitral insufficiency is found with increasing frequency and is often due to a calcified mitral valve annulus. Mitral valve prolapse, once thought to be a disease found in younger patients, is being diagnosed more and more in the elderly and is a significant cause of mitral regurgitation.

To assess this hypothesis, the hemodynamic effects of acute changes in the balance between the production of O2 radicals and availability of antioxidant enzymes were studied in the isolated perfused rat lung. Intravascular generation of O2 radicals, by administration of xanthine-xanthine oxidase, decreased the pulmonary vascular pressor response to alveolar hypoxia (-55 +/- 5%) and angiotensin II (-58 +/- 10%, P less than 0.01 for each) in isolated perfused rat lungs without increasing the lung wet-to-dry weight ratio. Decreases in pulmonary vascular reactivity were inhibited by pretreatment of the lung with desferrioxamine or a mixture of catalase and superoxide dismutase. Catalase and superoxide dismutase preserved the hypoxic pressor response whether given in liposomes or in dissolved form. Superoxide dismutase administered free in solution, or combined with catalase in liposomes, increased the normoxic pulmonary arterial pressure and enhanced vascular reactivity to angiotensin II and hypoxia. Lungs treated with antioxidant enzymes in liposomes had 50% higher lung catalase levels than control lungs (P less than 0.05). These findings demonstrate that exogenous partially reduced O2 species can decrease pulmonary vascular reactivity and suggest that endogenous radicals, superoxide radical in particular, might be important in modulating pulmonary vascular tone.\r"

  ".W": "We determined the relationship of diaphragmatic contraction rate to diaphragmatic blood flow (Qdi), metabolism, and contractility in nine open-chested mechanically ventilated newborn lambs. The diaphragm was paced for 15 min at slow (20/min) and fast (100/min) contraction rates each followed by a 30-min rest period. There was a mild reduction in transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) during the slow contraction period accompanied by a shift to the right of the curve relating stimulation frequency (10-100 Hz) to Pdi. Pdi returned to control at the start of the fast contraction period, but then fell by 30% within 2 min with continued fast contraction rates. The frequency-Pdi curve was significantly shifted to the right. Qdi, O2 transport, and O2 consumption increased during slow contraction and to an even greater extent during fast contraction. Fractional O2 extraction reached an apparent maximum during slow contraction. Lactate efflux from the right phrenic vein during slow contraction remained unchanged from control. During fast contraction lactate efflux rose proportionately more than did O2 consumption. We conclude that the energy demands at fast rates of diaphragmatic contraction in newborn lambs cannot be met by aerobic metabolism alone despite increasing O2 transport to the diaphragm.\r"

  ".W": "The inspiratory phase of coughs often consists of large inspired volumes and increased motor discharge to the costal diaphragm. Furthermore, diaphragm electrical activity may persist into the early expiratory portion of coughs. To examine the role of other inspiratory muscles during coughing, electromyograms (EMG) recorded from the crural diaphragm (Dcr) and parasternal intercostal (PSIC) muscles were compared to EMG of the costal diaphragm (Dco) in anesthetized cats. Tracheal or laryngeal stimulation typically produced a series of coughs, with variable increases in peak inspiratory EMGs of all three muscles. On average, peak inspiratory EMG of Dco increased to 346 +/- 60% of control (P less than 0.001), Dcr to 514 +/- 82% of control (P less than 0.0002), and PSIC to 574 +/- 61% of control (P less than 0.0005). Augmentations of Dcr and PSIC EMG were both significantly greater than of Dco EMG (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.002, respectively). In most animals, EMG of Dco correlated significantly with EMG of Dcr and of PSIC during different size coughs. Electrical activity of all three muscles persisted into the expiratory portions of many (but not all) coughs. The duration of expiratory activity lasted on average 0.17 +/- 0.03 s for Dco, 0.25 +/- 0.06 s for Dcr, and 0.31 +/- 0.09 s for PSIC. These results suggest that multiple respiratory muscles are recruited during inspiration of coughs, and that the persistence of electrical activity into expiration of coughs is not unique to the costal diaphragm.\r"

The effect of chronic training on gravimetric, mineral, physical, and histological parameters of normal bone was also examined. Fifty-six adult female Long-Evans rats were divided into four groups: sedentary (C) and exercising controls (E) and sedentary (O) and exercising osteoporotics (EO). Exercising animals ran 4 h/wk for 1 yr. Two percent NH4Cl added to drinking water induced osteoporosis as shown by significantly lower femoral density and breaking strength and histomorphometrically quantified tibial trabecular bone volume but a normal mineral-to-matrix ratio in the O rats. The development of high-turnover osteoporosis in O rats was confirmed by significantly higher alkaline phosphatase activity (P less than 0.05), urinary hydroxyproline content (P less than 0.01), resorption surfaces (P less than 0.01), and histological parameters of bone formation (P less than 0.01). Exercise prevented all these biochemical, biophysical, and histological abnormalities in the EO group. Exercise had no influence on the density of normal femurs but tended to increase their breaking strength (by 11%) compared with femurs of C rats (P = 0.11).\r"

For the other glycolytic intermediates studied (glucose 1-phosphate, glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, and pyruvate) only the increase in glucose 1-phosphate, glucose 6-phosphate, and fructose 6-phosphate were blunted (P less than 0.05) at 282 Torr. The reduction in muscle glycogen concentration during exercise was similar (P less than 0.05) for all environmental conditions. Although exercise resulted in reductions (P less than 0.05) in ATP and creatine phosphate averaging 30 and 51%, respectively, the magnitude of the change was not dependent on the degree of hypobaria. Inosine monophosphate was elevated (P less than 0.05) approximately 11-fold with exercise at both SL-1 and SL-2. These findings support the hypothesis that the lower lactate concentration observed at 282 Torr after exhaustive exercise is due to a reduction in anaerobic glycolysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Acute and chronic pulmonary and systemic hemodynamic responses to arginine vasopressin (AVP) were examined in 4-wk hypoxia-adapted and air control rats. AVP, administered intravenously as bolus injections or sustained infusions, produced major dose-dependent V1-receptor-mediated reductions in mean pulmonary arterial pressure in hypoxia-adapted rats. These effects were comparable in pentobarbital-anesthetized, thoracotomized animals and in conscious, intact rats. Chronic infusions of AVP induced a sustained reduction in mean pulmonary arterial pressure and partially prevented the development of pulmonary hypertension without changing systemic arterial pressure. AVP induced significant decreases in cardiac output in both groups; the cardiac output response was not significantly different in hypoxia-adapted and air control animals. AVP induced almost no change in MPAP in air control rats. Furthermore the systemic pressor effects of AVP were significantly blunted in hypoxia-adapted rats compared with air controls. We conclude that the pulmonary depressor and blunted systemic pressor effects of AVP observed in hypoxia-adapted rats may be related to release of a vasodilator, such as endothelium-derived relaxing factor, vasodilator prostaglandins, or atrial natriuretic peptides. Further study is needed to elucidate these mechanisms and assess the usefulness of AVP and/or its analogues in the treatment and prevention of hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of O2 tension on force in precontracted isolated pulmonary arterial smooth muscle from calf lungs was characterized to investigate the mechanism of O2 tension sensing. These arteries display a decrease in force with increasing O2 tension that is antagonized via inhibition of soluble guanylate cyclase activation by 10 microM methylene blue or inactivation of catalase by pretreatment with 50 mM 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole for 30 min. O2 tension-dependent relaxation is associated with an increase in intracellular H2O2 metabolism through catalase (detected as the peroxide-dependent inactivation of tissue catalase activity by aminotriazole) and cyclic guanosine 5'-monophosphate (cGMP), known mediators of relaxation in calf pulmonary arteries. Thus a recently reconstructed mechanism of activation of soluble guanylate cyclase involving the metabolism of H2O2 by catalase appears to function as an O2 tension sensor in pulmonary arteries.\r"

  ".W": "Bronchial hyperresponsiveness can be produced experimentally after inhalation of numerous nonimmunospecific stimuli; our objective was to determine whether acrolein, a component of cigarette smoke, could increase bronchial reactivity to intravenously administered acetylcholine in guinea pigs. Bronchial responsiveness was assessed twice before and 1, 2, 6, and 24 h after exposures to less than or equal to 0.01 (sham), 0.31, 0.67, 0.94, or 1.26 parts per million for 2 h (5-7 guinea pigs/group). To examine the possible relationships of responsiveness to inflammatory mediator release and cellular infiltration, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in another 30 guinea pigs before (control) and 0, 1, 2, 6, or 24 h after exposures. Pulmonary resistance was increased immediately after exposure (5 min) and returned to control values within 30-60 min. Increased bronchial responsiveness was evident within 1 h and became maximal 2-4 h after exposure. The acetylcholine dose necessary to double resistance decreased from 104.2 +/- 7.3 to 79.6 +/- 15.9 at 1 h and was 32.5 +/- 7.9 at 2 h and 32.8 +/- 7.6 micrograms.kg-1 at 6 h. Increases in two eicosanoids, thromboxane B2 (from 167 +/- 21 to 314 +/- 77 pg/ml) and prostaglandin F2 alpha (from 98 +/- 20 to 285 +/- 62 pg/ml) occurred immediately after exposure, whereas an influx of neutrophils occurred 24 h later (from 2.2 +/- 1.2 to 11.3 +/- 3.6%). These temporal relationships suggest that neutrophil infiltration may be a sufficient but not a necessary condition for the onset of bronchial hyperresponsiveness and that injury to cells normally present in the lung are responsible for the mediators thought to influence bronchial responsiveness.\r"

  ".W": "A model of shock was developed in anesthetized dogs by limiting venous return with a balloon inflated in the right atrium. The change in ventilation (VE) in response to a sustained decrease in arterial pressure (Pa) to 50-60 Torr was studied by recording transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) and diaphragm (Edi) and parasternal intercostal (Eic) electrical activity. Four dogs died of cardiac arrest after 20-60 min. In 11 dogs, VE, after an initial increase, decreased progressively until apnea occurred after 103 +/- 24 min, after 60% reductions in breathing frequency, Pdi, and Eic and a 30% fall in Edi. No decrease in diaphragm contractility was found in response to artificial phrenic nerve stimulation. The cardiocirculatory function deteriorated during shock until it became irreversible at apneic time. No recovery from apnea occurred without a recovery of Pa. We conclude that the fall in VE and ensuing apnea in this model resulted from a decrease in central respiratory neural output associated with a progressive deterioration of the cardiocirculatory function.\r"

  ".W": "To gain further insights into the mechanisms regulating skeletal muscle glycogenolysis during exercise, glycogen, phosphorylase, and adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) were determined in fast-twitch white (FTW) and fast-twitch red (FTR) muscle from groups of rats that ran for 0, 5, 10, 15, or 30 min at either 15 or 30 m/min. Glycogen degradation demonstrated an intensity and duration response in both fiber types. cAMP increased in both fiber types by 5 min and remained elevated at all times measured. FTW muscle cAMP levels were independent of both intensity and duration of exercise. FTR muscle cAMP levels were higher from 10 to 30 min at the 30-m/min intensity compared with the 15-m/min intensity. The ratio of the activity of phosphorylase in the presence of 2 mM AMP X 100 (phosphorylase a%) remained elevated at 20-22% independent of intensity and duration in FTW muscle; however, phosphorylase a% demonstrated an intensity and duration effect in FTR muscle. Glycogenolytic rates decreased with time, even though both cAMP and phosphorylase a% remained elevated in both fiber types. These data suggest that cAMP and phosphorylase a activation can be maintained during exercise in skeletal muscle but indicate a dissociation of these factors from glycogenolysis.\r"

  ".W": "The hemodynamic response to maximal exercise was determined in rats that were subjected to high-intensity sprint training (HIST) and rats that served as sedentary controls. Training consisted of five 1-min bouts of treadmill running at work loads (15% grade, 97 m/min) in excess of the animals' maximal O2 uptake (VO2max) interspersed with 90 s of rest. Training was performed 6 days/wk for 6 wk. After the training regimen, all rats were acutely instrumented with catheters in the right carotid artery and right ventricle. O2 uptakes, hemodynamic parameters, arterial and mixed venous O2 concentrations, blood gases, and acid-base status were determined at rest and during submaximal and maximal exercise. Results demonstrated that VO2max of HIST rats was significantly greater than that found for sedentary control rats. This increase in VO2max was due to an increase in maximal cardiac output (Qmax), since maximal arteriovenous O2 difference was similar between trained and sedentary rats. The increase in Qmax was due to an increase in maximal stroke volume (SVmax), because maximal heart rate in trained rats was similar to that in sedentary control rats. Citrate synthase and phosphofructokinase activities measured in the white gastrocnemius, plantaris, and soleus muscles of trained and sedentary rats were similar. These results suggest that the increase in VO2max produced with HIST in rats is strongly linked to an increase in central cardiac function as indicated by an increase in Qmax and SVmax.\r"

  ".W": "The pattern of abdominal muscle use during breathing in unanesthetized dogs is unknown. Therefore, we have recorded the electromyograms of the rectus abdominis, external oblique, and transversus abdominis in eight conscious animals breathing quietly in the sitting, standing, and prone postures. During quiet breathing in the sitting posture, all animals invariably had a large amount of phasic expiratory activity in the transversus abdominis. In contrast, only four animals showed some expiratory activity in the external oblique, and only one animal had expiratory activity in the rectus abdominis. A similar pattern was observed when the animals were standing or lying prone, although the amount of expiratory activity was less in this posture. Bilateral cervical vagotomy in four animals did not affect the degree of transversus abdominis expiratory activation or the influence of posture. We conclude that in conscious dogs 1) the abdominal muscles play an important role during breathing and make spontaneous quiet expiration a very active process, 2) the transversus abdominis is the primary respiratory muscle of the abdomen, and 3) unlike in anesthetized animals, extrapulmonary receptors play a major role in promoting abdominal expiratory contraction.\r"
