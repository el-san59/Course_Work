  ".W": "A patient with an abdominal mass was found to have a Wilms' tumor. Light microscopic examination showed that, in addition to blastema, stroma, and tubules, the tumor contained an unusually large number of glomeruli. Glomerular basement membranes stained positively by immunohistochemistry for laminin, collagen type IV, fibronectin, and Goodpasture antigen. Staining for Goodpasture antigen was seen only after acid-urea treatment, which was similar to findings in fetal and infant glomeruli. Glomerular cells stained positively for actin, myosin, and desmin, but there was no staining for factor VIII or Ulex europaeus agglutinin I, indicating an absence of endothelial cells. These findings were supported by electron microscopy, which showed basement membrane material, visceral epithelial cells, and mesenchymal cells (presumably primitive mesangial cells) in glomeruli, but no patent capillaries or capillary endothelium. Hence, the glomeruli in this case of Wilms' tumor were immature and also showed aberrant glomerulogenesis.\r"

Natural killer (NK) cells and fibronectin were chosen as immunostaining markers to demonstrate the antitumor effects. Immunocytochemical staining was performed by the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method. These investigations demonstrated that (1) local administration of OK-432 seems to promote a marked induction of NK cells and fibroblasts around or entering into the cancerous lesions and (2) the cancer cell-killing effect of NK cells and the fibronectin-enriched stromal reaction augmented by the injection of OK-432 suggest at least the possibility of protection against neoplastic growth with invasion and the spread of distant or nodal metastases of solid carcinomas.\r"

All 17 nonchondroid chordomas stained for cytokeratin, and most (16) stained for epithelial membrane antigen. In contrast, two chondroid chordomas failed to stain for either cytokeratin or epithelial membrane antigen, while one of them did stain for both antigens. Sixteen of the 20 chordomas (80%) stained for S100 protein, including all three chondroid chordomas. Vimentin was found in six (30%), and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin in 16 chordomas (80%). Carcinoembryonic antigen and lysozyme were each found in two specimens (10%). While these findings basically agree with the immunohistochemical studies of other investigators, there are a few discrepancies. Most significant is the lack of epithelial markers in two of three chondroid chordomas located at the base of the skull. Possible reasons for the discrepancies are discussed.\r"

Thus, oxygen radical scavengers could protect kidneys after warm ischemia and long hypothermic perfusion. Porcine kidneys were incubated at 37 degrees C for 45 minutes, placed on a pulsatile perfusion apparatus at 7 degrees C for 48 hours, and then autografted to iliac vessels. Superoxide dismutase (10 mg) and catalase (10 mg) in 10 mL of phosphate-buffered saline solution were infused into the renal artery during a three-minute interval before reperfusion. The kidneys treated with the superoxide dismutase-catalase solution had significantly improved function compared with controls receiving only phosphate-buffered saline solution. The mean (+/- SEM) serum creatinine level on postoperative day 5 was 510 +/- 100 mumol/L (5.75 +/- 1.12 mg/dL) (n = 12) vs the control value of 840 +/- 90 mumol/L (9.54 +/- 1.01 mg/dL) (n = 11). There was more extensive cellular damage in the control kidneys. This demonstrates the efficacy of oxygen radical scavengers in protecting pig kidneys after warm ischemia and prolonged preservation.\r"

Twenty-seven of these patients met the following criteria for eligibility in the study: (1) roentgenographic documentation of an AAA larger than 3 cm, (2) at least two serial ultrasound size determinations over a minimum six-month interval, and (3) a documented medication history. Of these 27 patients, 12 received long-term beta-blockade, while 15 received no beta-blockade. The two groups were comparable with respect to age, sex, initial aneurysm size, mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and duration of follow-up (mean, 34 months). Among patients with beta-blockade, the mean growth rate was 0.17 cm/y. The rate for the controls was 0.44 cm/y. One patient of 12 (8%) in the beta-blocker group had a rate that exceeded the mean for the overall group compared with eight patients of 15 (53%) in the group with no beta-blockade. This difference was statistically significant. Thus, beta-blockade may be associated with a decreased AAA growth rate in this small, retrospective study.\r"

Our study of 29 patients selected for this technique affirms the value and the safety of this method, especially as surgical experience has grown and localization studies have improved. During the latter 24 months of our study, 11 (30%) of 36 operations were performed using local anesthesia by one of us. A success rate in ten of 11 cases was achieved, with one patient requiring a second exploration for adenomatous hyperplasia while under local anesthesia.\r"

These patients had advanced secondary complications, including blindness, vascular disease, and disabling neuropathy. Average posttransplant hospitalization and charges were 17.7 days and $42,780 compared with 11.2 days and $29,000 for patients who received renal allografts alone. Following transplantation, blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin A levels promptly returned to normal in all patients. Two patients subsequently died, one after five months of a cytomegalovirus infection and one after seven months of a ruptured bladder. After a mean of 11.6 months of follow-up, ten patients (83%) remained independent of insulin and dialysis. The success of pancreas transplantation in diabetics with advanced complications now approaches that of other organ allografts. It therefore appears reasonable to recommend transplantation for diabetics with less severe secondary complications, since these candidates are most likely to realize the potential benefits of long-term normoglycemia.\r"

During the past ten years we have treated 18 patients who had pheochromocytoma. Biochemical diagnosis was made in all patients by measurement of 24-hour urinary total catecholamine excretion or by epinephrine-norepinephrine fractionation. Determination of epinephrine-norepinephrine ratios was instrumental in making the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma in two patients in whom total catecholamine levels were normal. Localization of the pheochromocytoma in the most recently treated cases was accomplished by ultrasound, computed tomography, or iodine I 131 iobenguane (iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine) scanning. Nine patients in the series were prepared for surgery with phenoxybenzamine hydrochloride and six with prazosin hydrochloride. Preoperative total alpha-adrenergic blockade with phenoxybenzamine offered no advantage over selective blockade with prazosin in terms of perioperative fluid requirements or intraoperative hemodynamic stability.\r"

Fever is a nearly constant finding, but headache may not be prominent. Periorbital edema, chemosis, proptosis, and limitation of extraocular movements (especially lateral gaze) develop in almost all recognized cases. Involvement of the opposite eye frequently appears within two days following the onset of unilateral signs. Although computed tomography may be helpful, magnetic resonance imaging is probably the diagnostic procedure of choice. Treatment includes appropriate antibiotics and, oftentimes, surgical drainage of the primary focus of infection. Less than half of the patients recover completely; the mortality rate is approximately 30%.\r"

However, there is very little information with respect to the significance of these autoantibodies or any definitive evidence that the antigens involved represent the mitochondrial autoantigens (M2 complex) described in PBC. We have cloned and sequenced a rat complementary DNA which encodes for all the epitopes recognized by autoantibodies to the major, or 70-kd, mitochondrial autoantigen in patients with PBC. Using this recombinant fused autoantigen, as well as by immunoblotting with human placental mitochondria, we tested for antimitochondrial antibody specificity in sera from 250 patients with systemic sclerosis. Nineteen sera (7.6%), including those from patients with CREST (calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, telangiectasias) and diffuse scleroderma, had reactivity with human placental mitochondria proteins by immunoblot testing. All 19 sera reacted with the M2 complex. All sera that reacted with the 70-kd protein likewise reacted with the recombinant cloned autoantigen. The predominant autoantibody isotype to the 70-kd protein was IgG3. Interestingly, the 70-kd protein is 11% proline, an amino acid which is frequently preceded by hydrophobic amino acids.\r"

  ".W": "One of the most important biochemical pathways in the organism is the biosynthesis of methionine from the methylation of homocysteine. Two different reactions are responsible for this methylation, one utilizing N5-methyltetra-hydrofolate as a methylating agent and the other using betaine as the methyl donor. This paper reviews some recent findings in this laboratory, which demonstrate that ethanol-feeding to rats impairs the folate-induced reaction. Our findings also show that this impairment is compensated for through the adaptive increase in the enzyme using betaine in the biosynthesis of methionine. Further studies indicate that the mechanism of action in the impairment may occur through the formation of individual adducts between the folate-induced enzyme (methionine synthetase), its essential cofactors and acetaldehyde, a metabolic product of ethanol. These findings suggest a basis for why rats are more resistant to alcoholic liver injury than humans and may offer a means of protecting against alcoholic liver injury in man.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-eight patients treated by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase had serial cytogenetic studies of marrow performed at intervals after transplant. Twenty patients received marrow cells from donors of opposite sex. Ph+ marrow metaphases were identified in 24 of 48 (50%) of patients after BMT; they were first seen early (within 1 year) in 16 cases and late (greater than 1 year after BMT) in eight cases. Ph-positivity after BMT occurred more commonly in recipients of T-depleted than nondepleted marrow (19 of 28 v 5 of 20). In 4 cases the Ph+ metaphases were found only transiently after BMT; in 11 cases the Ph+ metaphases have persisted but hematologic relapse has not ensued; in 9 cases the finding of Ph+ metaphases coincided with or preceded hematologic relapse. Chromosomes in cells of donor origin had morphological abnormalities in two cases. No relapses were identified in cells of donor origin. Our data suggest that the relationship between cells of recipient and donor origin is complex: cure of leukemia may depend on factors that operate for some months or years after BMT.\r"

  ".W": "Peripheral blood T cell subsets were evaluated in 11 patients during the reconstitution phase after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and compared with 11 age-matched controls. The proportion of cells coexpressing Leu7 and CD11b (C3bi receptor) markers was determined within the CD4+ (T-helper) and the CD8+ (T-suppressor) subsets by two-color immunofluorescence analysis. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells reached normal or near-normal values within the first year posttransplant. In contrast to normal controls, however, most of the cells in both subsets coexpressed the Leu7 and CD11b markers. T cells with such phenotype display the morphological features of granular lymphocytes (GLs) and a functional inability to produce interleukin 2 (IL 2). These T cell imbalances were not related to graft v host disease (GvHD) or to clinically detectable virus infections and may account for some defects of cellular and humoral immunity that occur after bone marrow transplantation.\r"

Introduction of a retroviral vector containing a 1.6 kilobase (kb) pair human CSF-1 cDNA into these cells abrogated their growth factor dependence but did not render the cells tumorigenic in nude mice. The infected macrophages contained multiple copies of the vector provirus, expressed both membrane-bound and secreted forms of CSF-1, and exhibited constitutive down modulation of the murine CSF-1 receptor. Because insertion of the v-fms gene has previously been shown to abrogate factor dependence and induce tumorigenicity in BAC1.2F5 macrophages, the failure of these cells to express a fully transformed phenotype after persistent stimulation by endogenous CSF-1 suggests that the v-fms and c-fms gene products provide different signals for cell proliferation.\r"

Recipients of T depleted marrow from a mismatched donor were at particularly high risk of this complication. Six of 25 (24%) recipients of mismatched T depleted bone marrow developed BLPD. In contrast, none of 47 matched T depleted transplants, one of ten (10%) who received non-depleted marrow from an unrelated donor, and only one of 424 matched non-depleted transplants were associated with BLPD. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) specific serology and DNA hybridization studies demonstrating five to 50 copies of EBV genome/cell in involved tissues implicate this virus as an associated etiologic agent. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and cytogenetic analysis of involved tissue demonstrated donor origin (five of seven) or host origin (two of seven). Histologic appearance was similar to EBV-induced polymorphic B cell proliferations described following solid organ transplantation, or which occur de novo in primary immunodeficiency. Six of seven patients with adequate tissue available for study were found to have monoclonal proliferations by: in situ immunofluorescence (six of seven), and/or immunoglobulin gene rearrangement, (four of six). Cytogenetic analysis of involved tissues from four patients showed a normal karyotype, whereas two had multiple clonal chromosomal abnormalities. Seven patients died despite aggressive attempts at therapy with combinations of antiviral, immunologic, and chemotherapeutic agents.\r"

Cultured human endothelial cells contain 58 +/- 11 ng (n = 16) high-mol wt kininogen/10(6) cells as determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) specific for high-mol wt kininogen. High-mol wt kininogen was isolated from cultured human endothelial cells by immunoaffinity chromatography. Nonreduced sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) demonstrated that endothelial cell high-mol wt kininogen consisted of five protein bands with mol wts of 95,000, 85,000, 65,000, 46,000, and 30,000 daltons. Immunoblotting of the endothelial cell high-mol wt kininogen by using specific antisera against the heavy and light chain indicated that the 95,000-, 85,000-, and 65,000-dalton bands consisted of the heavy and light chain whereas the 46,000- and 30,000-dalton bands reacted only with the anti-light chain antiserum. Immunoprecipitation studies performed with lysed, metabolically labeled endothelial cells and monospecific antisera directed against high-mol wt kininogen suggested that high-mol wt kininogen is not synthesized by the endothelial cells. Endothelial cells cultured in high-mol wt kininogen-free medium did not contain high-mol wt kininogen. These studies indicate that endothelial cell high-mol wt kininogen was proteolytically cleaved in the culture medium and subsequently internalized by the endothelial cells. Binding and internalization studies performed with 125I-labeled, proteolytically cleaved, high-mol wt kininogen showed that endothelial cells can indeed bind and internalize proteolytically cleaved high-mol wt kininogen in a specific and saturable way.\r"

A monoclonal antibody (MoAb, 60B8), reactive with the particulate of the differentiated cells but not of the untreated cells, was isolated. The antigen recognized by the MoAb became apparent two days after VD3 treatment, and its concentration increased and peaked on day 6. Human neutrophils, followed by monocytes and differentiated HL-60 cells, showed the greatest abundance of the antigen. Monocytes cultured for eight days in vitro lost the antigen. No 60B8 antigen was seen in other blood cells. The MoAb precipitated two polypeptides with an apparent molecular weight (mol wt) of 15,000 (15 k) and 13 k in the detergent-solubilized, 35S-methionine-labeled lysate of the differentiated HL-60 cells. Double-sandwich type enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) devised for the quantitative assay of 60B8 antigen indicated that some 2% to 5% of neutrophil protein was 60B8 antigen. This antigen was not exposed on the neutrophil cell surface, since the cells were not stained immunofluorescently with either mono- or polyclonal antibody, unless they had become permeable. The neutrophil membrane and the granules were separated on the Percoll density gradient, and the antigen was found localized in the plasma membrane-rich fraction. These findings suggested that 60B8 antigen is a novel differentiation antigen for phagocytic cells.\r"

  ".W": "To study the digestion pattern of human high-molecular weight (mol wt) kininogen (HMWK) in plasma during contact activation we have prepared monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to the light-chain (LC) and the heavy-chain moiety of HMWK. One MoAb from each set was purified, and neither MoAb inhibited the clotting activity of HMWK. In enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblotting experiments neither antibody bound to kininogen-deficient plasma. Digestion of purified HMWK with plasma kallikrein yielded, on reduced sodium dodecyl sulfate gels, two LC forms, at 62 and 49 kd, respectively. Digestion of HMWK with tissue kallikrein (TK) yielded mainly the 62-kd form. In immunoblot analyses of these digests, the anti-LC MoAb detected products at 62 and 49 kd respectively. With plasma kallikrein, the 62-kd species slowly shifted to 49 kd, and with TK, the 62-kd species accumulated with time. Anti-LC MoAb was also used as a probe in immunoblotting experiments to study the digestion pattern of HMWK in whole plasma activated with kaolin or dextran sulfate. In activated normal pooled plasma (NHP) and factor XI-deficient plasma, native HMWK (mol wt, 115 kd) was cleaved within five to ten minutes, and two LC forms at 62 and 49 kd were detected. In kaolin-activated prekallikrein (PK)-deficient plasma, the disappearance of the 115-kd form was relatively slow, and only the 62-kd form of LC was seen. HMWK was not cleaved when factor XII-deficient plasma was incubated with kaolin. LC-dependent coagulant activity paralleled the presence of LC bands seen in the immunoblots, and lower-mol wt fragments of LC were not identified. These data indicate that in activated NHP two forms of LC of HMWK (62 and 49 kd) are formed sequentially. Further, the LC-dependent coagulant activity remains detectable long enough to suggest that proteolytic inactivation of LC is too slow to be an important control mechanism.\r"

All but two patients who survived at least 30 days showed durable engraftment. Six patients survive 17+ to 36+ months following transplantation. Severe acute GVHD was seen in 47% of the patients; however, no direct correlation between GVHD and the degree of mismatching could be determined. Fatal infections were seen in 29 patients, and in the majority the infection occurred after the granulocyte count had risen to greater than 500 cells/microL. We conclude that the problems encountered in this pilot study can potentially be solved, and that further studies with this type of marrow grafting are warranted.\r"

In order to test this hypothesis, 54 patients with hematologic malignancy or marrow aplasia were entered on a prospective randomized trial using cotton-wool filtration as a method of leukocyte depletion of red cell and platelet concentrates. Forty patients were considered evaluable; 20 patients received filtered products and 20 patients in the control group received standard unfiltered products. The filter was 99% efficient in removal of leukocytes (average number of WBC/platelet product, 6 X 10(6)). Platelet loss by this technique was 8%. Alloimmunization was assessed by detection of de novo formed lymphocytotoxic and platelet specific antibodies by microcytotoxicity test, Staph A protein radioimmunoassay, and solid phase red cell adherence test. In the group receiving filtered products, three of 20 (15%) patients developed lymphocytotoxic antibodies while ten of 20 (50%) patients in the control group developed cytotoxic antibodies (P = .01 by actuarial methods). Platelet antibodies were detected in seven of ten alloimmunized patients in the control group and three of three patients in the study group. Clinical evidence of refractoriness was seen in three of 20 patients in the filtered group and ten of 20 in the control group (P = .01 by actuarial methods). The cost of filtration was a fraction of the cost of a plateletpheresis product. Filtration appears to be an effective and economical method for reducing alloimmunization and clinical refractoriness to random donor platelets in patient receiving long-term transfusion support.\r"

  ".W": "The in vitro growth of Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites was assayed in mutant red cells deficient in either diphosphoglycerate mutase (DPGM) or phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK). In addition, cDNA probes developed for human DNA sequences coding for these enzymes were used to examine the parasite genome by means of restriction endonuclease digestion and Southern blot analysis of parasite DNA. In both types of enzymopathic red cells, parasite growth was normal. In infected DPGM deficient red cells, no DPGM activity could be detected, and in normal red cells, DPGM activity declined slightly in a manner suggestive of parasite catabolism of host protein. However, in infected PGK deficient red cells, there was a 100-fold increase in PGK activity, and in normal red cells, a threefold increase in PGK activity was observed. Parasite PGK could be recovered from isolated parasites, and a marked increase in heat instability of parasite PGK as compared with the host cell enzyme was noted. Neither cDNA probe was found to cross-react with DNA sequences in the parasite genome. It is concluded that the parasite has no requirement for DPGM, and probably has no gene for this enzyme. On the other hand, the parasite does require PGK, (an adenosine triphosphate [ATP] generating enzyme) and synthesizes its own enzyme, which must have been encoded in the parasite genome. The parasite PGK gene most likely lacks sufficient homology to be detected by a human cDNA probe. Enzymopathic red cells are useful tools for elucidating the glycolytic enzymology of parasites and their co-evolution with their human hosts.\r"

This pulse-generated runoff (PGR) system generates blood flow in patent calf arteries by means of a pulsatile cuff even if the existing Doppler signal is inaudible. PGR was compared with pre-operative arteriography in 95 ischaemic limbs and both were compared with the peripheral resistance measured at operation in 62 limbs. There was a highly significant correlation between the PGR and arteriogram scores (rs = 0.74, P less than 0.001) but PGR tended to detect more patent vessels than arteriography. The peripheral resistance correlated better with PGR than arteriography (rs = -0.71 and -0.54 respectively, P less than 0.001). PGR is a simple, non-invasive method of determining calf and foot vessel patency pre-operatively.\r"

Forty-five consecutive patients with a fractured hip entered the study. Twenty-one were randomized to prophylactic treatment with dextran 70 (group 1) and twenty-four patients received dextran 70 and DHE (group 2). Both regimens were initiated pre-operatively and the surgical and postoperative procedures were the same in the two groups. On the first and fourth postoperative day, Tc-plasmin scintigraphy of the lower extremities and pulmonary ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy were performed to detect any deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary emboli. A total of 19 per cent of group 1 patients developed DVT and so did 25 per cent in group 2; this difference was not statistically significant. Of the detected DVT, 60 per cent were subclinical, and 7 per cent of the patients had minor pulmonary emboli, all of which were symptomless. No therapeutic difference could be demonstrated between the two regimens. A recent report claiming that adding DHE to the prophylactic administration of dextran 70 considerably reduces the incidence of postoperative DVT in emergency hip surgery is questioned.\r"

HIV-1 preferentially infects T lymphocytes by binding to a membrane receptor protein, CD4, associated with helper function. The virus can also attack macrophages and, possibly, other cells such as neuronal cells, colonic epithelial cells and B lymphocytes. Infection of macrophages or monocytes may be involved in neurologic disease. Knowledge about HIV-1 has rapidly increased, and investigators have characterized its structure, ways in which it infects cells, replicates and is cytopathic for certain cells, and how the immune system responds to it. The ideal vaccine would prevent adsorption of the virus into the cell, but it is difficult to develop stable resistance because the virus has many antigenic patterns and mutates frequently. The results of vaccine trials in animals have not been promising, but work is being done with monoclonal antibodies. Antiviral therapies being investigated include those to prevent virus binding and entry, to inhibit reverse transcription, to inhibit the virus's life cycle and to restore immune competence in immunocompromised patients.\r"

A review of hospital medical charts, the patient lists of the Medical Genetics and Myelomeningocele clinics at Alberta Children's Hospital and data from the Canadian Congenital Anomalies Surveillance System revealed the annual birth prevalence rate of neural tube defects in southern Alberta in 1970-81 to be 1.62/1000 total births. This figure suggests southern Alberta to be a low-frequency area. There was no significant variation in the annual rates of spina bifida, encephalocele or all neural tube defects combined over the study period. A significant linear decline in the frequency of births of anencephalic infants, however, was noted (p = 0.025). Information on the total reproductive history of the mothers revealed that the empiric risk of recurrence of a neural tube defect was 2.2%, and the risk to all siblings was estimated to be 2.3%. In future prevalence studies multiple sources of case ascertainment should be used, including data on pregnancies terminated because of a fetal neural tube defect.\r"

Seventy patients (5.4%) were diagnosed after they were 80 years old. Thirty-four patients had low-grade NHL, eight had intermediate grade, and 28 had high-grade NHL. The majority of them were classified as Stage I (n = 24) or II (n = 18), and the rest as Stage III (n = 16) or IV (n = 12). Treatment varied with grade of NHL, tumoral extension, and performance status. Forty-seven patients were given chemotherapy, 37 radiotherapy, and six patients had surgery. Overall, treatment was considered to be optimal in 12 patients, good in 34 patients, and limited in 24 patients. Toxicity was minimal in 62 patients, treatment-limiting in two patients, and lethal in six patients. Thirty-seven patients achieved a complete remission (CR), 21 a partial remission, five experienced stabilization, and seven failed to respond. For all patients, the median survival (MS) was 18 months. In contrast to younger patients, malignancy grade had no significant influence. The only significant parameter is CR (P = 0.02). In conclusion, very old patients must be treated correctly but carefully. Better tolerated treatments are needed to improve results that are neither very poor nor as good as in younger patients.\r"

Further research is needed to determine the role of ambulatory monitoring in the detection of hypertension, in the assessment of cardiovascular symptoms, and in the definition and treatment of labile hypertension. Because this technique has been developed subsequent to the research that underlies our current understanding of the effect of hypertension and the treatment of hypertension on cardiovascular disease, further prospective studies are needed to confirm its value in predicting hypertensive complications. A growing body of evidence indicates that ambulatory blood pressure may be a much more powerful predictor of cardiovascular risk than conventional blood pressure measurements.\r"

Regional abnormalities in the circulation of skeletal muscle may further compromise nutritive blood flow to muscle. As a result, the patient experiences a sense of fatigue during physical activity. Dyspnea, or an abnormal awareness of breathing, may also accompany exercise in these patients. This sense of breathlessness may be due to an abnormally elevated work of breathing secondary to decreased pulmonary compliance, a heightened chemical drive to ventilation, and a possible imbalance in the O2 supply and demand of the respiratory muscles. The ambulatory monitoring of physical activity in patients with chronic cardiac failure has not been systematically examined. Potential monitoring techniques that may provide accurate and reproducible results regarding the exercise response in these patients include the thoracic impedance principle to measure minute ventilation and portable O2 uptake sensors.\r"

Conventional Holter-type AEM devices do not allow for patient or physician intervention during acute myocardial ischemia. Considerable cost and time are required to analyze ST-segment data of prolonged monitoring periods from these tape-recorded signals, and human error and fatigue play an important role in diminishing accuracy of ST-segment interpretation. Automated analysis is done with computer and technician interaction but the accuracy and validation of the various systems for ST-segment analysis from tape recordings requires further detailed study. Newer, real-time ambulatory ECG analyzers are designed for prolonged monitoring periods and directed toward ST-segment analysis. Some devices also alert the patient to an acute ischemic or arrhythmic event allowing for intervention immediately. Some real-time systems have undergone some very encouraging validation studies. These recent studies suggest excellent sensitivity and specificity for detection of ischemic-type ST-segment depression. However, more work is needed before the accuracy of other such devices is known with certainty. As the central goal of therapy for patients with coronary artery disease evolves from simply controlling angina to reduction or elimination of ischemic episodes and their consequences, use of AEM devices will play an increasingly important role in management of these patients.\r"

  ".W": "TTEM as a means for ambulatory arrhythmia detection and management of cardiac patients has demonstrated the potential for considerable clinical utility. Because it is easy to use, relatively inexpensive, and highly effective in aiding in the diagnosis of various cardiac arrhythmias, it may be a preferred mode of surveillance for a number of cardiac patients of all ages. TTEM is presently used most widely for pacemaker followup. TTEM can be used alone and in conjunction with Holter monitoring in the management of cardiac arrhythmias, and has lately become a recognized tool in the followup of patients with ischemic heart disease, especially post-myocardial infarction patients. It is important to emphasize that TTEM is only one part of an overall approach to ambulatory monitoring that also includes Holter monitoring and exercise testing. It must be noted, however, that the studies comparing the efficacy of TTEM with that of other surveillance methods are few and consist of only a relatively small number of patients. Therefore, it would be premature to draw conclusions regarding the ultimate role of TTEM and its comparative value in the routine management of most cardiac arrhythmia problems. However, available data do support an increasing role for these systems in the future.\r"

To establish the role of mesangial prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in the modulation of contractile responses, we studied the effects of the stable thromboxane A2/endoperoxide analogue U-46619 on cultured rat mesangial cells preincubated with 1) four structurally unrelated, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, indomethacin, acetylsalicylic acid, meclofenamate, and piroxicam, to inhibit the synthesis of PGE2, the major mesangial metabolite of arachidonic acid; 2) exogenous PGE2 and the stable analogue of PGI2, iloprost; and 3) indomethacin in the presence of exogenous PGE2. Computer-assisted image analysis microscopy demonstrated enhancement of spontaneous and agonist-induced contraction by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in individual cells grown on a glass substrate, from 37.2 +/- 7.3% to a maximum of 75.5 +/- 6.4% of the cells with piroxicam, at 1 microM U-46619. PGE2 and iloprost dose-dependently inhibited U-46619-induced contraction, to 5.0 +/- 2.8% and 12.5 +/- 4.7% of the cells, respectively, at 1 microM U-46619. PGE2 also completely reversed the effects of indomethacin. Both PGE2 and iloprost dose-dependently stimulated intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation during 3-minute incubations, an effect that was blocked by the inhibitor of adenylate cyclase, 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine. The latter reversed the inhibitory action of PGE2, enhancing spontaneous and agonist-induced contractility, thus indicating a modulatory role of cAMP. We conclude that endogenous arachidonate metabolism regulates mesangial cell contraction through elevation of intracellular cAMP.\r"

  ".W": "The spiral orientation of left ventricular (LV) fibers suggests that twisting about the ventricular long axis of the apex with respect to the base, i.e., torsional deformation, may be characteristic of LV contraction. To demonstrate this twisting motion, 10 orthotopic human cardiac allograft recipients were studied with biplane cineradiography of tantalum helices implanted within the LV midwall at 12 specific sites. Counterclockwise twisting about the LV long axis (as reviewed from apex to base) accompanied ventricular ejection in all patients. Torsional deformation angles, measured relative to a reference minor axis at the base, were substantially smaller in the anteroapical wall, as compared with counterparts in the apical third of the inferior and lateral walls (anterior = 13.3 +/- 6.0 degrees, inferior = 18.7 +/- 6.3 degrees, and lateral = 23.4 +/- 10.7 degrees). Torsional angles at the midventricular level were roughly half as much and exhibited similar regional variabilities (anterior = 7.6 +/- 3.3 degrees, inferior = 9.0 +/- 3.3 degrees, lateral = 10.7 +/- 5.2 degrees, and septal = 8.8 +/- 3.8 degrees). Comparison of control beats and the initial beat after abrupt cessation of rapid atrial pacing (126 +/- 10 beats/min) with return to the control heart rate (96 +/- 9 beats/min) permitted the mild positive inotropic effect of tachycardia to be assessed at similar levels of ventricular load. Torsional deformation of the anteroapical and inferoapical sites increased significantly (p less than 0.05) over control values to 15.6 +/- 7.5 degrees and 21.2 +/- 5.5 degrees, respectively. In contrast, torsional deformation of the lateral wall was essentially unchanged. These data provide direct evidence for torsional deformation of the left ventricle in humans, demonstrate that torsion of the LV chamber is nonuniform, and suggest a dependence of LV torsion upon contractile strength that is attenuated in the lateral wall.\r"

Filtered and unfiltered intra-atrial electrograms were analyzed in eight patients who received procainamide (50 mg/min iv, up to 1000 mg) during 11 episodes of atrial fibrillation. Continuous recordings were made before, during, and after the infusion. The recordings were digitized, divided into 4.27 sec segments, and analyzed for atrial rate, median frequency and amplitude probability density function. Significant differences were noted before and after infusion of procainamide for atrial rate (498 +/- 97 vs 356 +/- 146 beats/min; p less than .005), median frequency (5.50 +/- 1.22 vs 4.24 +/- 0.99 Hz; p less than .0005), and density (58.3 +/- 13.9% vs 69.1 +/- 15.0%; p less than .005). Pre- and postprocainamide values were compared with published criteria for detection of atrial fibrillation. Before procainamide, only 2.3%, 5.7%, and 3.4% of the data segments failed to meet criteria for atrial fibrillation by rate, frequency content, and density, respectively. In contrast, after procainamide, 50%, 36.4%, and 28.4% of the data segments failed to meet these same criteria, despite electrograms still meeting morphologic criteria for atrial fibrillation. Thus procainamide resulted in changes sufficient to cause failure of published criteria for detection of atrial fibrillation. These findings have broad implications for the function of antitachycardia devices in patients receiving antiarrhythmic drug therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of the study was to examine whether the prolonged administration of the beta 1-adrenoceptor partial agonist xamoterol could improve left ventricular diastolic function and affect the global remodeling process of the left ventricle after anterior myocardial infarction. In 22 patients with anterior myocardial infarction and single-vessel disease, left ventricular angiography (+ Millar) was performed under basal conditions 1 to 2 months after the acute myocardial infarction. Eight patients were then treated for 3 months with placebo and 14 were treated with xamoterol (200 mg bid) and a second left ventricular angiographic study was performed. Angiograms were digitized frame by frame to derive the diastolic pressure-volume relationship and to compute wall stress. An index of elastic myocardial stiffness was computed at a constant stress of 30 kdynes/cm2 before and after treatment. To evaluate changes in left ventricular shape, segmental areas in anterior and inferior segments were computed and compared at end-diastole and end-systole. After xamoterol, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and mean diastolic wall stress decreased (from 24 +/- 5 to 15 +/- 5 mm Hg and from 57 +/- 32 to 38 +/- 22 kdynes/cm2, respectively; both p less than .01 vs baseline and vs placebo). These changes were accompanied by a downward shift in the diastolic pressure-volume relationship and by a decrease in the index of myocardial stiffness from 526 +/- 270 to 371 +/- 194 kdynes/cm2 (p less than .02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We treated 9 patients who had AGN with moderate to severe hypertension and suppressed plasma renin activity with 25-50 mg of captopril per os every 6-8 hours. Control of blood pressure was achieved in 1-2 hours and maintained thereafter. Captopril therapy was associated with an increase in plasma renin activity, a decrease in plasma aldosterone and an increase in the urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 and kallikrein, independent of changes in urine output. Creatinine clearance increased 39.6 +/- SE 15.2% with captopril and decreased in the postcaptopril period, suggesting that captopril exerted a reversible effect on glomerular filtration rate, possibly modifying intrarenal vasoconstriction. Our study shows that rapid control of hypertension in AGN may be obtained with oral inhibition of the angiotension converting enzyme. Stimulation of PGE2 and kinins, as well as angiotensin II blockade appear to contribute to the hypotensive effect of the drug; by inference, the suppressed activity of vasodilator systems seems to play a significant role in the hypertension of AGN.\r"

We identified 22 patients (9.8%) with PTE from among 225 renal transplant recipients followed for an average of 5.5 years. To characterize possible predisposing factors and to study the clinical significance of PTE, these patients were compared with a control group matched for age, race, sex and etiology of renal failure. Plasma volume (PV) and red blood cell mass (RBCM) were measured in the majority of patients with PTE. Peripheral serum erythropoietin (Ep) levels were determined in the majority of patients in the control and PTE groups. PTE occurred an average of 11.4 months after transplantation. Risk factors for the development of PTE were pretransplant hypertension, retention of native kidneys, higher pretransplant hematocrit, and diuretic use for treatment of post transplant hypertension. Ep levels in the PTE and control groups were not significantly different. Twenty of the 22 patients with PTE were receiving concurrent diuretic therapy, and hematocrits fell to normal levels in all of these patients following cessation or dose reduction of diuretic. No other treatment of PTE was utilized, excluding the phlebotomy of a single unit of blood from one patient. No thromboembolic complications were noted during the follow-up period. We conclude that PTE is frequently induced by overzealous diuretic therapy for treatment of post-transplant hypertension. Discontinuation or reduction of diuretic therapy results in resolution of PTE in nearly all patients. From this experience we have developed an algorithm for the investigation and management of PTE.\r"

  ".W": "In summary, accurate identification of fetal growth disorders remains a difficult clinical challenge. Many diagnostic parameters have been devised to diagnose these conditions, however, no single test alone allows a confident antenatal diagnosis of IUGR or macrosomia to be established. Until new criteria or new methods such as Doppler analysis of umbilical artery flow permit a more accurate prediction of growth disturbances, multiple parameters should be monitored. Evaluation of the amniotic fluid volume, BPD, FL, AC, and EFW should be included in all studies. In high risk cases (unexplained oligohydramnios, previous history of growth retardation, poor nutritional status, abnormal sonographic parameters, maternal obesity, diabetes mellitus, etc.) additional measurements such as the HC/AC ratio and the FL/AC ratio should also be evaluated. Similarly, evaluation of suspected excessive fetal growth requires careful evaluation of AC measurements. Patients with suspected growth disorders should be reevaluated with serial scans at 2 to 3 weeks intervals. Careful monitoring of fetuses with suspected IUGR and macrosomia may decrease much of the morbidity and mortality associated with these conditions.\r"

  ".W": "This article has detailed the common prenatal sonographic findings that have been detected in fetuses with Down syndrome, trisomy 13, trisomy 18, Turner syndrome, and triploidy. It should be noted that not all fetuses with these five chromosomal abnormalities will have sonographically detectable malformations and that some may not be easily recognizable even at birth. It is crucial that the approach to the patient with a sonographically detected fetal malformation be thorough, systematic, and expeditious. The first step is to attempt to accurately define the abnormality. Next, syndromes with which this malformation are associated should be researched and a differential diagnosis constructed. Based on this differential, accompanying findings with which this abnormality is often associated should be looked for sonographically. A detailed history including pedigree information, possible teratogen exposure, consanguinity, and ancestry is imperative. In some cases a Mendelian disorder may be identified by obtaining a thorough prenatal genetic history. In virtually all cases of prenatally detected fetal malformations, chromosome analysis is indicated. Amniocentesis is the most common means of fetal chromosome analysis, but usually takes at least 2 weeks for results. In cases where the gestation is approaching the legal limit for elective termination, rapid karyotyping by percutaneous umbilical cord sampling should be considered and referral to a center familiar with this procedure is suggested. Chromosome analysis from fetal blood takes approximately 3 days to accomplish. Alternatively, rapid karyotyping by transabdominal chorionic villus biopsy may also be accomplished and has been performed as late as 37 weeks gestation. This procedure may be especially advantageous in cases where oligohydramnios is present. If a chromosomal abnormality is identified, genetic counseling should be arranged to discuss prognosis, cause, recurrence risks and to help the parents through this difficult time. If applicable, the option of pregnancy termination should be offered. Not all parents faced with a chromosomally abnormal fetus will wish to terminate their pregnancy and others may be too late in gestation to consider this option. In these cases, discussions with other families raising similarly affected children, social workers, clergy, psychiatrists, and geneticists may be helpful to the parents. Late pregnancy prenatal cytogenetic diagnosis may be beneficial both to the parents in helping prepare them psychologically and emotionally for an adverse outcome and in guiding obstetric management.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Neoplasms of thymic T-cell derivation include two closely related malignancies: T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. The recognition of these tumors as distinct biologic entities dates back to the early 1970s, when patients with these diseases were found to have tumor cells that formed spontaneous rosettes with sheep erythrocytes. In the last decade, however, the growth of new technologies and availability of new reagents has enabled us to characterize this group of diseases with more precision. When studied with a panel of monoclonal antibodies, there is tremendous phenotypic diversity in the types of T-cell leukemias that are encountered. In spite of this diversity, a few general facts have become apparent. To a first approximation, thymic T-cell malignancies can be related to stages of normal T-cell development. Surprisingly, in spite of the overall similarity between T-ALL and T-lymphoblastic lymphoma, the antigenic phenotypes encountered suggest a biologic difference between these two diseases. Although there is not currently any single reagent that permits recognition of T-ALL or lymphoblastic lymphoma in all cases, a combination of technologic approaches using conventional morphology and histochemistry, immunologic studies, and, in some cases, newer genetic studies should permit great precision in the definition of this disease. The clinical picture of T-cell ALL or lymphoblastic lymphoma has traditionally been one of a poor prognosis disease with high WBC count, bulky adenopathy, and mediastinal mass. Although encountering this clinical presentation should suggest the T-cell phenotype, not all patients with T-cell leukemia will fit this stereotype. Clinical studies have also served to provide support for the expanding biologic definition of T-cell neoplasia, particularly insofar as it has been demonstrated that patients with T antigen-positive but E rosette-negative ALL behave like other patients with T-cell disease. In short, patients with thymic T-cell malignancies not only have distinctive biologic characteristics to their blasts, but also have a distinctive pattern of clinical presentation, response to therapy, and sites of relapse. These differences have prompted the search for specific therapies and also directed approaches to understanding the variable clinical outcome of patients with these malignancies.\r"

  ".W": "The identification of ALL immunophenotypes with distinctive clinical features and prognostic significance indicates the importance of these studies in the evaluation of ALL patients for both clinical and research purposes. For differential diagnosis, the expression of pan-B-cell or pan-T-cell lymphoid antigens and the absence of myeloid/monocyte antigens represent the most useful markers for distinguishing ALL from AML. However, the increasing appreciation of large numbers of patients with clinically significant mixed lymphoid-myeloid phenotypes suggests that rigid classification of acute leukemias into exclusive lymphoid and myeloid categories may be somewhat artificial. In adult ALL, patients with My+ phenotypes (B+sIg-T-My+ and B-sIg-T-My+) have a lower incidence of complete remission and shorter survival times than do patients with My- marker profiles. Preliminary studies in childhood ALL also suggest a correlation between myeloid antigen expression and poor prognostic factors. In addition, children with sIg+ \"B-cell,\" cIg+ \"pre-B-cell,\" and T-cell ALL phenotypes have shorter disease-free survival times than do patients with more common \"early pre-B\" (B+cIg-sIg-T-) marker profiles. Application of immunologic markers in concert with cytogenetic and gene rearrangement studies has led to the identification of novel subgroups of leukemia with distinct clinical characteristics. Future studies incorporating a multiparameter diagnostic approach including immunophenotyping, gene rearrangement studies, and karyotypic analyses should further our understanding of the heterogeneity of acute leukemias, guide the development of new therapeutic strategies, and provide for more clinically relevant classification of these disorders.\r"

It can, in most cases, be diagnosed correctly on the basis of a bone marrow biopsy specimen, and the diagnosis is supported by the demonstration of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity in the leukemic cells. Nevertheless, as outlined, rare \"variant\" cases may pose diagnostic problems, and other lymphoproliferative disorders may have features that closely mimic those of HCL. In virtually all cases of HCL, the hairy cells are of B-cell lineage, representing a relatively mature B cell that is closely related to plasma cells. Treatment of HCL with splenectomy, IFN-alpha, or 2' deoxycorformycin has led to excellent responses in most cases. Much of the progress in our understanding of the nature of this rare leukemia has been made possible through the cooperation of community physicians with referral institutions, or groups of institutions, that are interested in studying HCL. Despite the remarkable advances in the treatment of this disorder over the last 5 years, and the ready availability of IFN-alpha, much remains to be learned regarding the biology of hairy cells, and further advances in therapy still must be made. The needed information can be obtained only through continued referral of patients to centers with expertise and an interest in HCL.\r"

Stained slides can be kept at room temperature for prolonged periods of time without loss of label. Surface or cytoplasmic determinants can be stained with the APAAP method.

  ".W": "Although mononuclear cell surface markers are primarily used to determine the lineage and stage of differentiation of leukemias and lymphomas, they can also be helpful in discriminating between some cases of neoplastic and reactive conditions. Peripheral blood lymphocytosis secondary to infection most often shows increased numbers of activated T cells of the suppressor/cytotoxic subset. A few exceptions, such as in pertussis, show predominantly T-helper cells. Although persistent B-cell lymphocytosis is most often associated with neoplastic conditions, B-cell predominant reactive conditions may also occur. Lack of light chain restrictions on B-cell membranes suggests non-neoplastic disorders. Reactive lymphadenopathy most often shows a predominance of T cells with normal to increased T-helper/T-suppressor cell ratios. In addition, normal ratios of kappa/lambda light chain surface immunoglobulin usually occur on B cells of reactive lymph nodes. Benign lymphocytic infiltrates in skin most often show a predominance of activated T-helper cells. Distinguishing reactive from neoplastic dermal infiltrates by mononuclear cell markers can be extremely difficult and may require DNA genotypic analysis. Mononuclear cell markers applied to bone marrow in patients treated for leukemia and other disorders must also be interpreted with caution. The presence of CD10 antigen (CALLA) may herald recurrence of leukemia; however, this determinant is not leukemia-specific and may be found on normal cells. Similarly, lymphoid cells bearing TdT often represent recurrent leukemia, and they must be differentiated from immature nonmalignant TdT-positive cells. Immunologic surface markers must be interpreted together with a careful review of the morphology of the tissues.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The elucidation of the spread of HTLV-I through high-risk groups and the finite but real incidence of HTLV-I seropositivity in normal blood donor populations in the United States indicates that blood and blood products should be screened for this infectious agent. Because of the ability of the provirus to exist in a quiescent state and the long lag time between exposure and seroconversion, it may be necessary to screen potential blood donors for integrated sequences by gene amplification methodologies in addition to standard serologic testing to protect the blood supply. The detection of the HTLV-I virus often requires multiple modes of testing, even in ATL patients. We have characterized by gene amplification several HTLV-I positive lymphoma patients who were seronegative. We have also identified by radioimmunoprecipitation assays intravenous drugs abusers who have antibody solely to the nuclear pX gene product and who do not, therefore, test positive in an ELISA assay prepared from purified virion proteins. All HTLV-I positive patients need to be counseled about the biohazard status of their body fluids. The fact tha only 1 to 2 per cent of HTLV-I infected persons have any diagnosable disease, coupled with the knowledge that the mean time for the onset of clinical manifestations is some 20 to 30 years following conversion to seropositivity, indicates that this is not a virulent pathogen or a highly transforming virus. These epidemiologic data support the notion of HTLV-I's role as a mitogen or first lesion in a multistep pathway to malignancy. These data are also consistent with the idea of rare random cis-activation of one of many cellular oncogenes following a fortuitous integration event.\r"

  ".W": "From this review of the natural history of EBV infection in humans, it is clear that the virus has evolved to a symbiotic state with humans. Once individuals are infected, EBV establishes a permanent infection that is maintained at a low level by replication of the virus in the oropharyngeal region with subsequent seeding of circulating B-lymphocytes. Individuals with normal immune systems are able to control the pronounced proliferative potential of EBV-infected cells and thus prevent the emergence of lymphoproliferations. Disease states result when the immune system is altered by other infections, developmental conditions, immunosuppressive agents, or debilitating circumstances such as cancer or starvation. In some cases, localized lymphoproliferations resembling large-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas can result that are monoclonal by immunoglobulin gene rearrangement studies. Remarkably, many of the localized masses will regress if the immunosuppressive agents or condition can be ameliorated in these individuals. In patients with hereditary immune deficiencies, these localized masses can progress to a fatal disease without further cytogenetic events. Burkitt's lymphoma, which is associated with EBV infection, appears to result when EBV-driven lymphoproliferations undergo cytogenetic translocations involving predominantly chromosome 8. Most of the conditions that are associated with EBV can be diagnosed by accurate application of EBV-serology, examination of peripheral blood films, a careful history and physical examination, and, in some cases, more sophisticated techniques such as the establishment of lymphoblastoid cell lines, EBNA staining, DNA probes, and pedigree analysis.\r"

  ".U": "88195419\r", 
  ".W": "Using the opiate receptor antagonist naloxone, we tested the hypothesis that endorphins act on opiate receptors to cause cardiovascular depression in primate shock. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac output, and left ventricular contractility (LV dP/dtmax) were measured in 34 anesthetized cynomolgus monkeys. Hemorrhagic shock was induced by bleeding into a heparinized reservoir to achieve (t = 0) and maintain MAP at 45 mm Hg. At t = 60 min, the reservoir was clamped and the animals were treated with 2 mg/kg plus 2 mg/kg.h naloxone (n = 5) or 0.9% NaCl as a control (n = 5). There were no significant differences in the cardiovascular responses to naloxone and saline when acid-base balance and core body temperature were not controlled. Pressor responses to naloxone, however, were present in proportion to arterial pH and body temperature. When these factors were controlled, naloxone (n = 6) significantly increased MAP and LV dP/dtmax by 48% and 83%, respectively, whereas saline (n = 6) had no significant effect. Blood was reinfused at t = 120 min, and survival rate at 72 h was significantly (p = .01) higher with naloxone (3/6) than saline controls (0/6). In the endotoxic shock model, cynomolgus monkeys were treated with 2 mg/kg plus 2 mg/kg.h naloxone (n = 6) or 0.9% NaCl (n = 6) when MAP reached 75 mm Hg or its nadir 60 to 90 min after Escherichia coli endotoxin, 5 mg/kg iv. Naloxone significantly increased MAP and LV dP/dtmax by 24% and 22%, respectively, whereas saline had no effect. Survival rate at 48 h was significantly (p = .01) higher with naloxone (6/6) than saline (1/6). Plasma beta-endorphin and beta-lipotropin concentrations rose three to five-fold in both shock models and were not affected by treatment. We conclude that endorphins are activated in primate shock and act on opiate receptors to contribute to the cardiovascular depression found with hemorrhage and endotoxemia.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have suggested that oxygen uptake (VO2) may be dependent on oxygen delivery (QO2) at most levels of QO2 in patients with the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); however, the adequacy of substrate delivery in patients with non-ARDS respiratory failure is unclear. The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship between VO2 and QO2 in a group of critically ill patients (n = 10) with non-ARDS respiratory failure (ie, cardiac pulmonary edema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], or pneumonia). For comparison, these relationships were also examined in a group of patients (n = 6) with ARDS. The data indicate that VO2 is dependent on QO2 in both patients with ARDS and non-ARDS respiratory failure. In contrast, regional venous oxygen tension differences varied considerably between the two groups of patients, indicating differences in local adaptations to critical reductions in QO2. Finally, over a similar range of QO2, oxygen extraction was greater in patients with ARDS compared to patients with non-ARDS respiratory failure (r = -0.67 and slope = -0.62 vs r = -0.45 and slope = -0.35; p less than 0.05). These data suggest that a linear relationship between VO2 and QO2 is not unique to patients with ARDS and may not predict regional adaptations to critical reductions in substrate availability.\r"

PEEP is thought to increase PaO2 by alveolar recruitment, which in turn, has been hypothesized to play a decisive role in pulmonary recovery. One hundred and eighteen patients were followed prospectively, and after development of decreased PaO2, randomized to receive recruitive PEEP (determined by blood gas criteria) or supportive PEEP (the minimal PEEP required to maintain PaO2 above 60 mm Hg on .5 inspired O2 fraction (FIO2). No prognostic factors were significantly different between the two groups. Recruitive PEEP application in 22 patients yielded a significantly increased incidence of hypotension (55 percent), pneumothorax (20 percent), and death during treatment (27 percent) when compared to the 28 supportive PEEP patients who had no hypotension or pneumothorax and only one death during treatment (4 percent). After PEEP treatment, deaths in each group were similar (19 percent and 15 percent, respectively). We find no evidence that PEEP treatment promotes beneficial outcomes and conclude that recruitment attempts may be harmful.\r"

Because of the progression of the disease and complications after operation, there were many inevaluable cases in this study. However, analysis revealed there was no bias caused by a greater number of unfavorable patients being selectively included in inevaluable cases in the postoperative irradiation only group. Our data question the value of preoperative irradiation being performed in addition to resection plus postoperative irradiation.\r"

The recognition of APT in patients receiving the drug early in the course of the disease will likely preclude the development of a permanent loss of pulmonary function in these patients. It is important for the clinician to individualize both the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to the patient receiving amiodarone who is thought to have pulmonary toxicity secondary to the drug. Several diagnostic and therapeutic decisions are available, and it is important to constantly reevaluate the risk-benefit ratios of the decision making process. Future studies may improve insight into the assessment of APT and may permit the clinician to diagnose this toxicity at an earlier and potentially more reversible stage of the disease process.\r"

Although virus-associated changes are many, we have at present no evidence to show that respiratory viruses cause intrinsic abnormalities in airway smooth muscle function. Rather, respiratory viruses influence bronchial smooth muscle function through a variety of other means: epithelial injury, PMN-dependent inflammation, and greater mediator release. These observations suggest that a common pathway to development of airway hyperreactivity during respiratory viral illnesses is to enhance those factors which participate in the inflammatory response. When the target of this enhanced inflammatory response becomes the airway, greater bronchial reactivity and obstruction result. Although many questions remain to be answered, we feel that future studies to evaluate the biology of respiratory virus effects on mechanisms of airway responsiveness will lead to a greater understanding of asthma pathogenesis.\r"

The APRV corrected respiratory acidosis without significantly effecting arterial blood oxygenation, venous admixture, cardiovascular function, or tissue oxygen utilization. Application of CPPV precipitated marked depressions in blood pressure, stroke volume, and cardiac output. A concomitant decrease in venous admixture did not compensate for these adverse cardiovascular effects. Deterioration of tissue oxygen delivery resulted in oxygen supply-demand imbalance during CPPV. The results of this experimental study indicate that if ventilatory augmentation of subjects who require CPAP is desired, APRV will enhance alveolar ventilation without compromising circulatory function and tissue oxygen balance, whereas CPPV will impair cardiovascular function significantly.\r"

Subsequent examinations included repeat FOB (five), open lung biopsy (five), needle aspiration (two), and autopsy (nine), establishing 49 diagnoses. Specific pathogens were identified in 45 instances, neoplasm in two, and idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis in two. Bronchoalveolar lavage alone yielded diagnoses in 63 percent and transbronchial biopsy and bronchial washings/brushings in 46 and 43 percent, respectively. Transbronchial biopsy suggested idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis in 17 instances, but four had spontaneous clearing, and open lung biopsy or autopsy showed alternative diagnoses (particularly CMV and Aspergillus) in 11. The main complication of FOB was moderate (25 to 100 ml) hemorrhage after transbronchial biopsy (10 percent); no severe episodes occurred despite elevated pulmonary vascular pressures. In this population of immunocompromised hosts: (1) bronchoalveolar lavage is the most sensitive bronchoscopic technique for detecting infection; (2) transbronchial biopsy is not useful in detecting CMV or Aspergillus infection; (3) pulmonary hypertension is associated with some risk of moderate but not severe hemorrhage after transbronchial biopsy.\r"

There was a relationship between body weight and anthropometric parameters of nutritional status (triceps skinfold thickness [r = 0.67; p less than 0.005], midarm muscle circumference (r = 0.53; p less than 0.005), but body weight did not correlate with daily caloric intake, serum albumin, transferrin, or blood lymphocyte count. None of these measurements of nutritional status correlated with any measure of RM strength or endurance. In a randomized observer-blinded crossover trial, patients were allocated to one of two groups. In the first eight weeks of the study, group A received nutritional supplementation, and patients in group B were control subjects. In the second eight weeks, patients in group A were control subjects, and group B received supplement. Mean daily caloric intake and body weight increased in both groups while receiving supplement (both p less than 0.05). Calories provided by the supplement were frequently substituted for normal dietary calories. Any increases in RM performance in the group receiving supplement were matched by increases (due to learning) in controls. We conclude that oral dietary supplements have no important effects on RM performance in ambulatory patients with COPD.\r"

Both groups showed a significant reduction in their oral steroid requirements during the study, with a 34 percent reduction in the lower dose group and a 57 percent reduction in the high dose BDP group while maintaining good symptomatic control of asthma; there was an associated improvement in baseline serum cortisol levels. Over the same period, the pulmonary function of the lower dose group showed significant worsening relative to that of the group receiving the high dose BDP which improved. There was no increase in dysphonia or oropharyngeal candidiasis among those using the concentrated BDP. We conclude that high dose concentrated BDP appears to be a safe medication in long-term steroid-dependent asthma, and is effective in reducing dependence on the use of oral corticosteroid with associated improvement both in pulmonary and adrenal function.\r"

A double-blind controlled study design was used, and the patients were randomly allocated to treatment with either omeprazole 40 mg once daily or ranitidine 150 mg twice daily. Endoscopy was performed prior to inclusion into the study, after four weeks and, if unhealed, again after eight weeks. Healing of esophagitis was defined as complete disappearance of all esophageal ulcerations. Symptoms were recorded before entry, after four weeks, and again after eight weeks in unhealed patients. Fifty-one patients were included in the per-protocol analysis at day 29, and 50 patients at day 57. The healing rate after four weeks of treatment was 22 of 26 patients (85%) treated with omeprazole and 10 of 25 patients (40%) treated with ranitidine (P less than 0.001). The corresponding figures after eight weeks were 24 of 25 (96%), and 13 of 25 (52%) (P less than 0.001). These results were confirmed in the intent-to-treat analysis. Patients treated with omeprazole showed a significantly faster and more profound relief in heartburn than patients treated with ranitidine: 85% had no heartburn after four weeks of treatment with omeprazole compared to 24% in patients treated with ranitidine (P = 0.00007). The percentage of patients who were free of all reflux symptoms was significantly greater in the omeprazole-treated group as compared to the ranitidine-treated group (62% and 12% respectively; P = 0.0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

For this, isotopic techniques and manometric methods were used. We confirm that nifedipine 30 mg per os does not modify gastric emptying of liquids or solids. By contrast, antral motility was significantly inhibited (P less than 0.05) and duodenal motility increased. These results could be interpreted as (1) gastroduodenal motility changes are not severe enough to alter emptying or (2) isotopic techniques are not sensitive enough to detect subtle changes in gastric emptying.\r"

Real-time ultrasonography and intestinal manometry were performed by different investigators and continued until at least two consecutive spontaneous phase III activities of migrating motor complexes were observed. The results show a cyclic variation of gallbladder volume, which reached its minimum value before the end of phase II in the proximal duodenum and its maximum in early phase II, 25 min after the beginning of phase III. These results suggest that there is a relationship between the cyclic gallbladder volume changes, which occur during fasting in humans, and with the various phases of duodenal migrating motor complex.\r"

The bile-to-serum (BS) ratio of the concentrations of albumin and IgG increased with the increase in total serum bilirubin. This indicates that the permeability from blood to bile increases with the degree of biliary obstruction, and the blood-bile barrier function breaks down. The BS ratios of IgA and IgM, which are selectively secreted into bile, did not show a significant correlation with total serum bilirubin. The index of the BS ratio to the BS ratio of albumin (BS/BS-Alb index) of IgA and IgM was significantly larger than that of IgG. This indicates that the selective transport of IgA and IgM into bile is present even in patients with obstructive jaundice. Since the BS/BS-Alb index of C3 is larger than that of IgG, and the SGOT correlated directly with the BS ratio of C3, some of the C3 in bile may come from damaged hepatocytes.\r"

No significant correlations between the two existed, unless placebo data were included in the analysis. Correlations were stronger with suppression of total 24-hr rather than nocturnal acidity. Using Williams' method for assessing trends, it was found that an increase in antisecretory effect is not associated with a concomitant increase in healing rates. Duration of medical treatment is the single most important factor in healing of benign gastric ulcer; healing rates for all drug regimens and placebo show a consistent increase with prolongation of treatment.\r"

The World Health Organization (WHO) classification of lung cancer identifies four major types: squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma. These tumors are commonly divided into two groups based on differences in their biology and treatment: small cell (SCLC) and non-small cell carcinomas (NSCLC). This review analyzes NSCLC with a strong emphasis on the practical aspects of treatment. We give recommendations about smoking cessation and early diagnosis through screening of high-risk individuals. We review contemporary diagnostic and staging techniques in the context of the new international TNM system of staging. Subsequent discussions of treatment are based on this new staging system. We stress the pivotal role of surgery for the management of local disease, and in addition present the potential contributions of newer radiation therapy techniques. We examine chemotherapy in detail, including a review of the comparative activity of the available cytotoxic agents against NSCLC, the relative contribution of combination chemotherapy, and the role of surgical adjuvant treatment with either chemotherapy or immunotherapy. We advise that patients with NSCLC be treated under the aegis of modern clinical trials of new therapy whenever possible. When this is not possible, we recommend an individualized approach based on such factors as the patient's age, general state of health, cardiopulmonary status, psychosocial status, and personal system of values.\r"

  ".W": "Magnesium is an important element for health and disease. Magnesium, the second most abundant intracellular cation, has been identified as a cofactor in over 300 enzymatic reactions involving energy metabolism and protein and nucleic acid synthesis. Approximately half of the total magnesium in the body is present in soft tissue, and the other half in bone. Less than 1% of the total body magnesium is present in blood. Nonetheless, the majority of our experimental information comes from determination of magnesium in serum and red blood cells. At present, we have little information about equilibrium among and state of magnesium within body pools. Magnesium is absorbed uniformly from the small intestine and the serum concentration controlled by excretion from the kidney. The clinical laboratory evaluation of magnesium status is primarily limited to the serum magnesium concentration, 24-hour urinary excretion, and percent retention following parenteral magnesium. However, results for these tests do not necessarily correlate with intracellular magnesium. Thus, there is no readily available test to determine intracellular/total body magnesium status. Magnesium deficiency may cause weakness, tremors, seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, hypokalemia, and hypocalcemia. The causes of hypomagnesemia are reduced intake (poor nutrition or IV fluids without magnesium), reduced absorption (chronic diarrhea, malabsorption, or bypass/resection of bowel), redistribution (exchange transfusion or acute pancreatitis), and increased excretion (medication, alcoholism, diabetes mellitus, renal tubular disorders, hypercalcemia, hyperthyroidism, aldosteronism, stress, or excessive lactation). A large segment of the U.S. population may have an inadequate intake of magnesium and may have a chronic latent magnesium deficiency that has been linked to atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, hypertension, cancer, kidney stones, premenstrual syndrome, and psychiatric disorders. Hypermagnesemia is primarily seen in acute and chronic renal failure, and is treated effectively by dialysis.\r"

  ".W": "The studies described in this paper were undertaken to characterize the insulin receptors present in the plasma membranes and Golgi fractions of fetal rat liver and to determine their subcellular distribution after the administration of exogenous insulin. Purification patterns of both types of liver membranes from fetal and adult rats were similar, as verified by morphological and biochemical approaches. In both groups insulin binding was significantly greater in plasma membranes than in Golgi fractions. However, in plasma membranes insulin binding was similar in both groups, while in Golgi fractions it was greater in fetal than in adult rats, although the difference was not statistically significant. The modifications in insulin binding reflect changes in the number of receptors, but not in the affinity constants. The time courses of insulin association and dissociation from liver membranes were unaffected by development. Degradation of insulin by liver membranes was lower in fetal than in adult rats, although this does not seem to be responsible for the differences observed in binding. No significant differences in the degradation of insulin receptors between different groups of liver membranes were found. The effects of a single injection of insulin on the subcellular distribution of insulin receptors in liver were examined. Insulin administration to adult rats resulted in a marked decrease in insulin binding in liver plasma membranes but a significant increase in Golgi fractions, occurring within 1.5 min. By contrast, in 21-day-old fetuses insulin injection slightly increased insulin binding to liver plasma membranes at 15 min, while in Golgi fractions an increase in insulin binding was only observed 30 min after insulin injection. These findings suggest that the slow ligand-induced translocation of the insulin receptor from the cell surface to Golgi fractions in the fetus might explain the absence of insulin receptor down-regulation in fetal hepatocytes.\r"

  ".W": "This report has investigated desensitization of pancreatic B cell secretion, or diminution of the insulin response to chronic stimulation. Freshly isolated rat islets were continuously challenged with various secretagogues over 24 h either in batch incubation or in a computer-controlled, flow-through perifusion system. At various glucose concentrations, secretion rose to a peak level in the third hour, then dropped to a new desensitized secretory level which was 25% or less than that of the maximum rate. The amount of insulin secreted was glucose dependent although secretory kinetics were independent of the amount of hormone secreted. At all glucose concentrations the reduction in islet insulin content was not great enough to account for the observed degree of desensitization. Furthermore at hour 20, islets responded vigorously to an alternate stimulus, indicating insulin stores and islet secretory machinery were still capable of being stimulated. Addition of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine or forskolin did not prevent glucose-induced desensitization. Insulin secretion desensitized similarly to nonglucose (alpha-ketoisocaproic acid) and nonfuel (phorbol ester) stimuli. Glucose potentiation of a terminal KIC response, although demonstrable after 20 h of chronic glucose, was diminished somewhat compared to that after 3 h of chronic glucose. Delaying glucose stimulation by 6 h reduced insulin secretion, yet desensitization persisted. Although insulin secretion entrained to a glucose signal which oscillated from 1.3-12.7 mM in sine wave pulses of 90-min frequency, desensitization was not prevented. Thus, desensitization occurred in response to glucose, nonglucose, and nonfuel stimuli and despite delayed or oscillating signals. We conclude that exhaustion of a finite insulin compartment is not the underlying defect in desensitized secretion and suggest that metabolic feedback or recruitment of multiple heterogeneous compartments may explain this phenomenon.\r"

  ".W": "The cyclostomes represent the first class of vertebrate in evolution to develop an endocrine pancreas. Two peptides with somatostatin-like immunoreactivity were isolated from the islet organ of one such cyclostome, the Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa). The primary structure of the more abundant peptide was established as: Ala-Val-Glu-Arg-Pro5-Arg-Gln-Asp-Gly-Gln10-Val-His-Glu-Pro- Pro15-Gly-Arg-Glu-Arg-Lys20-Ala-Gly-Cys-Lys-Asn25-Phe- Phe-Trp-Lys-Thr30-Phe-Thr-Ser-Cys. The second peptide, comprising 27% of the total immunoreactivity in the islet extract, was identical to mammalian somatostatin-14. The pathway of posttranslational processing of prosomatostatin in the hagfish islet differs markedly from the pathway in the higher vertebrates. In the mammalian pancreas, prosomatostatin is cleaved at the site of the single arginyl residue (corresponding to position 6 in hagfish somatostatin-34) and at the arginine-lysine site (corresponding to positions 19 and 20 in the hagfish peptide) to generate somatostatin-14 and somatostatin-28(1-12)-peptide. In the hagfish islet, Arg6 is not used as a cleavage site and cleavage at Arg19-Lys20 represents only a minor pathway of processing. The data provide further evidence of the strong evolutionary pressure to conserve the complete amino acid sequence of somatostatin-14.\r"

Both LHRH-like and GAP-like immunoreactivities (LHRH-LI and GAP-LI) were quantitated in these regions in intact male rats and male rats orchidectomized for 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 14, or 40 days.

One day after orchidectomy, a small decrease in GAP-LI and an increase in LHRH-LI were evident in extracts of the preopticanterior hypothalamic area which resulted in a significant decrease in the GAP/LHRH molar ratio. A similar selective decrease in GAP-LI and in the GAP/LHRH molar ratio was also observed in extracts of the HYP, but not until 2 days after orchidectomy. The GAP/LHRH ratio in both regions gradually returned to that of the intact controls. In both the HYP and median eminence, GAP-LI and LHRH-LI gradually declined in parallel through 14 days after orchidectomy. The gradual loss of immunoreactivity in these regions was evident by both RIA quantification and immunocytochemistry. These observations suggest that 1) production and processing of both LHRH and its prohormone are affected by testicular factors, 2) that divergent enzyme and/or transport systems, regulating LHRH and GAP processing, may exist at the level of the perikarya, and 3) long term orchidectomy results in decreased biosynthesis of the prohormone and/or in parallel increases in LHRH and GAP degradation or transport.\r"

  ".W": "It is the objective of the in vitro studies reported herein to further evaluate the role of insulin in the regulation of ovarian androgen biosynthesis, to assess its dose requirements, and to elucidate the cellular mechanism(s) underlying its high dose action. To this end, use was made of recently developed primary culture systems of ovarian androgen-producing cells, the differentiation of which is subject to regulation by gonadotropic and insulinotropic signaling. Treatment of collagenase-processed whole ovarian dispersates or highly enriched (greater than 90%) thecal-interstitial cells from immature rats with insulin (1 microgram/ml) or hCG (1 ng/ml), resulted in 1.5- and 2.6-fold increments in the accumulation of androsterone (3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-androstan-17-one), the main androgenic steroid identified in culture medium by HPLC. However, combined treatment with both agents unmasked a synergistic interaction resulting in 5.7-fold amplification of hCG action, the increase in androsterone accumulation representing enhanced biosynthesis rather than diminished degradation. Unaccounted for by cellular growth and independent of the cellular density of plating (1 X 10(4)-1 X 10(6) viable cells/culture) or the hCG dose (0.1-10 ng/ml) employed, the insulin effect proved time and dose dependent with a minimal time requirement of 72 h. [125I-TyrA14]Iodoinsulin binding to untreated highly enriched thecal-interstitial cells proved highly specific, saturable, and reversible, displaying a single class (Hill coefficient = 0.93 +/- 0.07) of high affinity (Kd = 1.7 X 10(-10) M), low capacity (4746 +/- 283 sites/cell) binding sites. Treatment with physiological concentrations (10 ng/ml) of insulin produced limited, albeit measureable, down-regulation of the insulin receptor. In contrast, provision of relatively high concentrations (1 microgram/ml) of insulin resulted (despite marked adsorption/degradation) in substantial (greater than 60%) down-regulation of the insulin receptor, but not the type I insulin-like growth factor receptor, the ligand of which has also been shown to amplify hCG-supported androgen biosynthesis. These findings suggest that the thecal-interstitial cell is a site of insulin reception and action, that physiological concentrations of insulin are capable of participating in the regulation of ovarian androgen biosynthesis, and that this effect is probably mediated via high affinity insulin receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The role of insulin during GH-stimulated adipogenesis of 3T3-F442A fibroblasts was investigated. Adipogenesis in defined medium (DM), as quantified by the level of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, revealed that there existed a strict requirement for both insulin and GH during adipogenesis. The concentration of insulin required to elicit half-maximal adipogenesis was approximately 20 nM. Insulin-like growth factor I was less effective than insulin in promoting adipogenesis, indicating that insulin action during differentiation was most likely mediated through the insulin receptor. Cellular viability was not compromised by the absence of insulin, as judged by colony-forming efficiency or trypan blue exclusion. Deletion of insulin from DM supplemented with 1 nM recombinant human GH reduced glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity to uninduced levels. Removal of other individual DM constituents did not have this effect. The growth factors fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and bombesin did not substitute for insulin during GH-stimulated adipogenesis. The characteristic increase in cell number observed during serum-based differentiation, reflecting clonal expansion of young adipocytes, did not occur in DM supplemented with insulin, and insulin-like growth factor I were necessary for this event. These results suggest that insulin functions in concert with GH as a coinducer of the differentiating signals.\r"

Incubation of PC12 cells for 2-3 days in low (0.3%) serum medium decreased [3H]thymidine incorporation into PC12 cell DNA to approximately 30% of that in control (15% serum) medium. Incubation of the cells in low serum medium also slowed the growth of the cultures and increased the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Addition of insulin to cells in low serum medium increased [3H]thymidine incorporation into the cells, increased the number of cells in PC12 cultures, and decreased the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. IGF-I and IGF-II also increased [3H]thymidine incorporation into PC12 cells incubated in low serum medium. IGF-I (EC50, approximately 0.3 nM) was a more potent stimulus of [3H]thymidine incorporation than was insulin (EC50, approximately 3.5 nM). These data suggest that insulin and IGFs are growth factors for PC12 cells, and that the growth-promoting effects of these agents may be mediated by a type I IGF receptor on PC12 cells.\r"

  ".W": "Mouse pancreatic islets were used to investigate the mechanisms and functional significance of the B cell membrane depolarization by acetylcholine (ACh). At low glucose (3mM), ACh (20 microM) increased 22Na+ influx, and slightly depolarized the B cell membrane but did not induce electrical activity or stimulate 45Ca2+ influx. ACh also accelerated 86Rb+ and 45Ca2+ efflux and barely affected basal insulin release. At a stimulatory concentration of glucose (10 mM), ACh stimulated 22Na+ influx, depolarized the B cell membrane, increased glucose-induced electrical activity, and stimulated 45Ca2+ influx. ACh also accelerated 86Rb+ and 45Ca2+ efflux and strongly potentiated insulin release. Omission of extracellular Ca2+ did not impair ACh stimulation of 22Na+ influx or 86Rb+ efflux, slightly modified the acceleration of 45Ca2+ efflux, and almost completely suppressed the increase in insulin release. Na+ omission (with N-methyl-D-glucamine as substitute) prevented the B cell membrane depolarization and the stimulation of 45Ca2+ influx, largely inhibited the acceleration of 86Rb+ efflux and insulin release, and suppressed the late phase of 45Ca2+ efflux otherwise produced by ACh. On the other hand, ACh stimulation of 3H efflux from islets prelabeled with myo-[2-3H]inositol was not affected by Na+ omission. All effects of ACh were blocked by atropine and unaffected by nicotinic antagonists. It is concluded that activation of muscarinic receptors depolarized the B cell membrane by increasing its permeability to Na+. When the membrane is already depolarized by glucose, this further depolarization augments Ca2+ influx and, hence, potentiates insulin release.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously shown that extracellular copper (Cu) amplifies prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) stimulation of LHRH release from explants of the median eminence area (MEA) of adult male rats, and that amplification is a post-PGE2 receptor event involving the adenylate cyclase system. We addressed the question: Is the process of Cu-amplified PGE2 stimulation of LHRH release regulated by ovarian steroids and, if so, is the regulatory steroid estrogen and/or progesterone? Immature female rats (30-32 days old) were ovariectomized and 6 days later treated with a combination of these steroids: E, sc implant of 17 beta-estradiol in a Silastic capsule for 3 days; EEi, E plus im injection of 17 beta-estradiol (2 micrograms/rat) 24 h before killing; and P, either im injection of 0.08 mg/kg progesterone 1 h before killing or 10(-9) M P included in the incubation buffer starting 1 h before Cu/PGE2 exposure. Controls were treated with the vehicle. MEAs were incubated for 5 min with 150 microM Cu, for 15 min with 10 microM PGE2, and then for 45 min with buffer (Cu/PGE2); LHRH release into the medium was measured by RIA. Cu/PGE2-stimulated LHRH release from MEA of intact rats was about 10 times greater than basal release. Ovariectomy led to a 50% reduction in Cu/PGE2-stimulated release [sham, 20.6 +/- 2.0 (mean +/- SE); ovariectomized, 9.4 +/- 1.8], pg/30 mm/MEA; and neither E, EEi, nor P significantly altered this response. In contrast, administration of P to either E- or EEi-primed rats augmented Cu/PGE2 stimulation of LHRH release 3.5-fold (E vs. EP or EEi vs. EEiP); however, P did not augment stimulation of LHRH release by Cu alone or PGE2 alone. Also, inclusion of P in the incubation buffer was as effective as in vivo P in augmenting Cu/PGE2 stimulation of LHRH release from the MEA of EEi-primed rats. On the other hand, in vitro P by itself did not alter LHRH release. These effects of P on the response of the MEA to Cu/PGE2 were not accompanied by a significant increase in the MEA content of LHRH. The process of Cu/PGE2 stimulation of LHRH release is regulated by ovarian steroids, so that ovariectomy leads to a marked reduction of the response of the MEA to Cu/PGE2, and P augments this response in an estrogen-dependent manner. Moreover, it is the secretory process elicited by the combined effects of Cu and PGE2 that is augmented by P.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In view of evidence that neuropeptide Y (NPY) stimulates the release and potentiates the action of LHRH on LH secretion, the present studies investigated age-related changes in the concentrations of NPY in individual hypothalamic nuclei and in the ability of hypothalamic tissues to release NPY in vitro. Compared with tissues of 2.5-month-old male rats, medial basal hypothalamic tissues of 13-month-old rats released significantly less NPY in response to K+ depolarization. In contrast, K+-evoked LHRH release from the same tissues was unimpaired. Aged male rats also exhibited markedly reduced concentrations of NPY in the median eminence and in the arcuate, medial preoptic, suprachiasmatic, paraventricular, dorsomedial, and ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei, which are sites of NPY perikarya and nerve terminal networks. These neurochemical changes occurred in association with decreased serum testosterone and LH levels. These findings demonstrate a widespread age-related decline in NPY levels and release in the hypothalamus, which may be responsible for the reduction in testosterone secretion and may contribute to the decline in reproductive function in aged male rats.\r"

  ".W": "Vanadate has been shown to have a number of insulin-like effects in various cells, including isolated rat adipocytes. In the present study we compared the activities of vanadate and insulin in isolated fat cells using a number of different assays of insulin-like activity. Both insulin and vanadate stimulated [2-3H]glucose incorporation into fat cell lipid in a dose-dependent manner, but the maximal effect of vanadate was markedly greater than that of insulin. At 10(-2) M vanadate the effect was 3-4 times as great as the maximal effect of insulin. This effect was dependent on specific glucose transport. Combinations of insulin and vanadate were not more effective than vanadate alone. Vanadate also produced antilipolysis with an effect somewhat greater than that of insulin. Using [U-14C]glucose both vanadate and insulin stimulated 14CO2 production and [14C]glucose incorporation into lipid, and again the effect of vanadate was greater than that of insulin. Vanadate had a greater effect on 14CO2 production than on [14C]glucose incorporation into lipid. When [1-14C]glucose was used vanadate again had a significantly greater effect on 14CO2 production than did insulin, but when [6-14C]glucose was used the effects of vanadate and insulin were equal. These results demonstrate that vanadate has insulin-like effects in isolated fat cells, but it selectively stimulates certain pathways to a greater extent than does insulin. The greater effect of vanadate than insulin appears to be primarily on the pentose phosphate shunt, suggesting that this agent may be useful for examination of this intracellular pathway in fat cells.\r"

The average percentage of large mammotrophs in fraction I was 86 +/- (SE) 2%, the percentage of intermediate-sized mammotrophs in fraction II was 86 +/- 4%, and the percentage of small mammotrophs in fraction III was 72 +/- 3%. By electron microscopy, cells in fractions I and II contained cytoplasmic secretory granules, whereas those in fraction III were either sparsely granulated or agranular. Cells retained their morphology after culture. Biological (B) and immunological (I) assays of PRL released into the medium after 24-h culture both showed that fraction I and II cells released more hormone than fraction III cells. The B/I ratios of released PRL were consistently greater than 1. Analysis of the separated mammotrophs by flow cytometry indicated major differences in light scatter profiles, both before and after culture. Since these differences have been shown to reflect secretory granule content, changes in perpendicular light scatter after culture were interpreted to indicate that small mammotrophs accumulated granules, whereas some of the large mammotrophs lost granules. Results from a cell blot assay indicated that fraction I and II cells secreted more hormone than fraction III cells. This same rank order was found when live cells were stained and analyzed for surface PRL. However, the reverse plaque assay yielded different information, viz. more plaques were found around fraction III cells than in fraction I or II cells. Finally, PRL contained in alkaline extracts of fraction I, II, and III cells was analyzed by Western blotting after electrophoresis under nondenaturing, denaturing, or denaturing and reducing conditions. Fraction III cells contained a prominent and unique PRL variant that had low mobility in native gels and an apparent mol wt in the range of 10-14K. After 24 h the culture medium from fraction III cells also contained this low mol wt variant. Our data indicate considerable heterogeneity in form and function within the mammotroph population of diethylstilbestrol-induced prolactinomas.\r"

As IVF has become more widely available and the need for the cryopreservation of human embryos has become apparent, pressure for technical development has increased. The ideal method would be simple, inexpensive, and effective. The most effective method for cryopreservation of early human embryos, such as those at the 1-cell pronuclear stage and up to the 4-cell stage, now appears to be stepwise cooling in 1,2-propanediol with sucrose in plastic ministraws. The preferred method for intermediate stage embryos uses DMSO with cooling and thawing at slow rates in a programmed biologic freezer. For the human blastocyst, slow cooling in glycerol and rapid thawing is the only method reported with survival rates comparable to those achieved for intermediate stage embryos using DMSO. The rates of survival from freezing and thawing blastocysts are not sufficiently high, however, to justify the losses associated with prolonged in vitro incubation. Even at the current level of technical achievement, cryopreservation of human embryos provides the clearest opportunity to improve the clinical results obtained with IVF. Research now underway in the modification of methods for vitrification and ultrarapid freezing holds promise for both simplification of technology and improvement of outcome. In view of legal and ethical considerations involved in embryo preservation, the desirability of ova preservation is widely accepted. Although a small number of human unfertilized mature ova have been cryopreserved using various methods, success rates are still low. Methods for the cryopreservation of eggs should be developed, but these methods probably should be proved by animal experiments to be safe, especially with regard to genetic damage, before a policy of transfer of embryos derived from frozen-thawed human ova is applied on a large scale.\r"

A gestational sac was seen 34.8 +/- 2.2 days from the last menstrual period (LMP), at which time the hCG was 1398 +/- 155 mIU/ml of the International Reference Preparations (IRP) or 914 +/- 106 mIU/ml of the Second International Standard (second IS). A fetal pole was seen 40.3 +/- 3.4 days from the LMP when the hCG was 5113 +/- 298 mIU/ml of the IRP or 3783 +/- 683 mIU/ml of the second IS. Fetal heart motion was detected 46.9 +/- 6.0 days from the LMP when the hCG was 17,208 +/- 3772 mIU/ml of the IRP or 13178 +/- 2898 mIU/ml of the second IS.

  ".W": "Over 700 alleged OC/drug interactions were reported for antituberculous drugs, other antibiotics, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and analgesics. Fewer than ten reports of OC/drug interactions were found involving antihistamines, thyroid hormone, vitamin C, antacids, ulcer medication, or diuretics. These may represent a set of OC/drug interaction problems that need to brought into medical awareness. Pregnancy is the first event reported when OCs appear to interact with another drug. However, menstrual disturbances are reported more often. BTB is the most frequently reported menstrual disturbance: it has been considered a warning signal that OC efficacy may be compromised. In such circumstances, contraceptive backup may be warranted. Reports of interference with OC efficacy have been most common for drugs used to treat tuberculosis, epilepsy, and depression, so patients and their physicians should be aware of potential problems. However, the average woman is more likely to encounter antibiotics, analgesics, and antihistamines, and current package inserts contain appropriate warnings. In recent years, prescriptions for low-estrogen OCs have outnumbered those for high-dose preparations. Many physicians became concerned that there was an increased risk of OC drug failure with the low-dose products. The database does not seem to suggest that this has happened. The dose of estrogen is not correlated with total adverse experience reports, time of appearances of the first adverse experience reports, or rate of reporting of the interactions. Likewise, reports of potential interactions with menstrual disturbances are not correlated with lower estrogen doses in OCs. There is, however, an association between low-estrogen OCs and recently reported pregnancies attributed to OC/drug interactions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These steroids have substantial effects on lipids and lipoproteins that appear to be primarily related to chemical structure of the compound, dosage, and a patient's hormonal status. Although the mechanisms by which alterations in lipid and lipoproteins affect atherogenesis are not fully understood, epidemiologic studies clearly associate alterations with risk of coronary heart disease. Attention to these alterations by progestins and estrogens, as well as further research on how these steroids may exert other cardiovascular effects, is important because atherosclerotic heart disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality for women as they age.\r"

  ".U": "88196624\r", 
  ".W": "Since their discovery in pancreatic beta-cells, ATP-sensitive K+ channels in the cell membrane have been thought to mediate glucose-induced beta-cell depolarization, which is required for triggering the voltage-dependent Ca2+ uptake subserving insulin release. The theory is that metabolism of glucose (and other fuel molecules) increases intracellular ATP or possibly other metabolites that diffuse to the membrane and inhibit the opening of ATP-sensitive K+ channels. This slows the efflux of positively charged K+ and depolarizes the cell. A recurrent source of confusion regarding this idea stems from the early observation that these channels are so exquisitely sensitive to intracellular ATP that channel opening is predicted to be approximately 99% inhibited under physiological conditions. To account for this apparent discrepancy, various mechanisms have been proposed that might render the channels less sensitive to intracellular ATP. We use a simple mathematical model to demonstrate that there is no major discrepancy and that, in fact, given the electrophysiological mechanisms existing in the beta-cell, the extreme sensitivity of the channels to ATP is appropriate and even mandatory for their physiological function.\r"

  ".W": "Protein kinase C (PKC) has been suggested as a mediator of insulin's effect on glucose transport, and PKC-mediated modulation of tyrosine kinase activity in the insulin receptor has been implicated in regulating the insulin sensitivity of tissues. Because skeletal muscle is a major target of insulin action, we examined the effects of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-rac-glycerol, and dioctanoyl diacylglycerol, known activators of PKC, on glucose metabolism in rat skeletal muscles. In contrast to results reported for other tissues, incubation of muscles with PKC activators produced only small increases in glucose transport and had minimal effects on the ability of insulin to stimulate transport. However, TPA treatment of muscles produced a significant decrease in basal glycogen synthesis. Incubation of muscles with TPA did not affect insulin binding or the tyrosine kinase activity of partially purified insulin receptors measured under basal conditions or after stimulation by insulin in situ or in vitro. Our findings do not support activation of PKC as a major mechanism for regulating glucose uptake or insulin receptor activity in skeletal muscle. However, the data do not rule out the possibility that glucose transport in skeletal muscle may respond to physiological activators of PKC.\r"

L-[1-14C]leucine was included in the meal to trace the entry and oxidation of the dietary leucine. Total (meal + endogenous) entry of leucine into the circulation was estimated with a constant infusion of [2H3]leucine. Postabsorptive and meal-related increases in the plasma leucine concentration were greater (P less than .05) in the insulin-insufficient IDDM than in the normal subjects but returned to near-normal values with CSII. Baseline leucine flux was approximately 40% greater in the insulin-insufficient IDDM than in normal subjects (2.17 +/- 0.17 vs. 1.55 +/- 0.15 mumol.kg-1.min-1, respectively; .05 less than P less than .01) but were near normal during CSII treatment (1.85 +/- 0.25 mumol.kg-1.min-1).

In the first experiment, diabetes-prone (DP) and diabetes-resistant (DR) BB/Wor rats were irradiated and reconstituted with bone marrow to create both reciprocal (DP donor----DR host; DR donor----DP host) and syngeneic (DR----DR; DP----DP) histocompatible chimeras. Both susceptibility and resistance to subsequent spontaneous diabetes in these chimeras were found to be a function of the type of donor bone marrow transplanted and not the genetic background of the host. In a second experiment, rats from three strains that share the RT1u major histocompatibility complex haplotype of the BB/Wor and rats from three non-RT1u strains were lethally irradiated and reconstituted with DP BB/Wor bone marrow. To rapidly induce diabetes and/or insulitis, they were then injected with mitogen-activated spleen cells from acutely diabetic DP BB/Wor donors, with standard passive-transfer methods. Diabetes and pancreatic insulitis were observed in RT1u recipients, whereas non-RT1u rats developed insulitis but not diabetes. The data suggest that predisposition to spontaneous diabetes in BB rats resides in bone marrow cells.\r"

During the two infusion periods, the overall mean levels of preprandial blood glucose (116 +/- 6 SC vs. 114 +/- 5 mg/dl IV) and glycosylated hemoglobin (6.1 +/- 2 SC vs. 5.9 +/- 2% IV) were virtually identical, but there were more hypoglycemic episodes and greater variability of preprandial blood glucose levels during SC than with IV. During the last 30 min of the hypoglycemic clamps, the mean levels of epinephrine and cortisol were significantly lower after 3 mo of SC (epinephrine, 268 +/- 80 pg/ml; cortisol, 14 +/- 1 microgram/dl) than with both CT (epinephrine 485 +/- 80 pg/ml; cortisol, 20 +/- 2 micrograms/dl) and IV (epinephrine, 443 +/- 62 pg/ml; cortisol, 19 +/- 2 micrograms/dl)(P less than .05). The mean growth hormone level was significantly (P less than .05) lower after SC (37 +/- 9 ng/ml) than after IV (79 +/- 12 ng/ml), but it did not reach statistical significance compared with CT (66 +/- 12 ng/ml). The mean glucagon, dopamine, and norepinephrine levels during the same period of hypoglycemia were not different when all treatment regimens were compared.

Insulin activity was assessed in terms of insulin's effects on lowering of blood glucose and nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), release of adrenaline (epinephrine) from the adrenal medulla, and the elevation of urinary catecholamines. Insulin alone produced a 60-70% fall in blood glucose and NEFA, 70% depletion of adrenal epinephrine, a 10-fold increase in urinary epinephrine, and a 2-fold elevation of adrenal dopamine. Concurrent administration of hydrochloride salts completely abolished all clinical manifestations that usually accompany insulin injection. Serum glucose and NEFA remained unchanged, the fall in adrenal epinephrine was blocked, and the increase in urinary catecholamines was abolished. These data suggest that certain hydrochloride salts possess an anti-insulin property. They decrease tissue responsiveness to insulin, thus rendering its action ineffective. The implication of these findings on the treatment of diabetic subjects requiring insulin therapy is discussed.\r"

Glucose usage by the intact cells qualitatively reflected the glucose phosphorylation found in the cell-free extracts.

  ".W": "Although non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is well recognized to be an inherited disease, the genetic lesion responsible remains to be determined. Several pedigrees have been reported in which defects of the insulin gene result in glucose intolerance or diabetes in affected members, but the role of insulin gene mutations in NIDDM is unknown. To evaluate this role, we ascertained 23 Caucasian pedigrees for a diabetic individual with at least one diabetic family member, sampled the unaffected individuals by a 75-g glucose tolerance test, and prepared leukocyte DNA on all family members. Included in the pedigrees ascertained were those with both predominantly lean and predominantly obese diabetic members and four pedigrees included as insulin-dependent diabetic individual. Insulin gene involvement was evaluated via previously described restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms (RFLPs) for the insulin gene and the nearby c-Ha-Ras oncogene (HRAS). Combination of these RFLPs resulted in the ability to trace the insulin alleles in all pedigrees studied. Analysis of individual pedigrees for sharing of insulin alleles was possible in 12 pedigrees, and lack of linkage was demonstrated in 6 of them. Neither linkage nor lack of linkage could be proved in the remaining pedigrees. Analysis of the pooled pedigree data failed to demonstrate linkage under several models, including autosomal-dominant and -recessive inheritance with different sporadic frequencies of diabetes and different prevalence figures. These results show that mutations of the insulin gene and the immediately surrounding area, including regulatory regions of the insulin gene, are unlikely to account for a significant subset of NIDDM in Caucasian individuals.\r"

Within 3 wk of onset of streptozocin-induced diabetes, immunodetectable levels of RLM3 and RLM5 were decreased by 85 and greater than 95%, respectively. Insulin treatment for 1 wk reversed the decline in these isozymes and restored RLM3 to 60% and RLM5 to 53% of levels found in the untreated rat. After a 2nd wk of therapy, these levels were returned to 86 and 92%, respectively. In contrast, the levels of RLM5b and RLM6 were elevated in diabetes 1.7- and 8-fold, respectively. Insulin treatment for 1 wk only slightly decreased the levels of RLM5b but completely reduced RLM6 levels to those seen in age-matched untreated rats. After the 2nd wk of insulin treatment, the level of RLM5b was almost completely restored to normal, with no additional change in the RLM6 level. The level of a fifth enzyme, RLM5a, was not markedly altered by diabetes or by insulin treatment. The results suggest there are at least three types of responses by constituents of the cytochrome P-450 population to diabetes: no change in the microsomal content, a rapid increase when insulin level declines and restoration when insulin is supplied, and a rapid decline when insulin level declines and a restoration by insulin treatment.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is characterized by day-long hypoinsulinemia, we measured 24-h serum profiles for glucose, insulin, and C-peptide by use of a constant-rate blood-withdrawal technique in diabetic and control subjects fed isocaloric meals. When only lean subjects were considered, diabetic subjects (relative body weight 0.99 +/- 0.3) and control subjects (relative body weight 0.95 +/- 0.03) had similar 24-h integrated serum insulin concentrations (13.4 +/- 2.5 vs. 16.1 +/- 2.0 microU/ml, P NS) due to the offsetting effects of increased basal levels and decreased postprandial responses in NIDDM. In contrast, both basal and meal-stimulated insulin levels were decreased in obese NIDDM subjects (relative body weight 1.39 +/- 0.07) compared with obese control subjects (relative body weight 1.60 +/- 0.08), resulting in a 61% reduction in the 24-h integrated insulin value (18.7 +/- 1.5 vs. 48.4 +/- 13.7 microU/ml). Thus, the capacity to increase 24-h integrated serum insulin as a function of relative body weight was impaired in NIDDM subjects (r = 0.27, P NS) compared with control subjects (r = .70, P less than .01). In contrast, 24-h integrated C-peptide was decreased (P less than .01) in both lean (0.92 +/- 0.13 pM/ml) and obese (1.52 +/- 0.19 pM/ml) NIDDM patients compared with the respective control groups (1.50 +/- 0.13 and 3.03 +/- 0.44 pM/ml). The molar ratio of 24-h integrated C-peptide to insulin was diminished in lean but not obese NIDDM compared with control subjects. A 3-wk period of intensive insulin therapy led to normalization of the mean 24-h integrated insulin (but not integrated serum C-peptide) value in NIDDM compared with a control group that had an identical mean relative body weight. The 24-h urinary C-peptide measured on the same day as the serum profile was correlated (P less than .01) with both the 24-h integrated serum insulin (r = .69) and C-peptide (r = .67) concentrations in control subjects but not in NIDDM subjects (r = .20 and .04, respectively, P NS). Additionally, the urinary clearance of C-peptide was increased in NIDDM (38.1 +/- 7.8 vs. 20.4 +/- 1.7 ml/min in control subjects, P less than .05) and varied with treatment status (26.0 +/- 4.6 ml/min after insulin therapy).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Three of the four dogs required daily insulin injections to control these catabolic manifestations. There was no evidence of spontaneous improvement of the severe diabetic state during the 39-69 days of observation after discontinuation of intravenous glucose infusion. Impairment of intravenous glucose tolerance, loss of the insulin response to glucose and arginine, fasting hyperglucagonemia, exaggerated glucagon responsiveness to arginine, and a significant reduction in sensitivity to insulin were characteristic of all diabetic dogs. Morphometric analysis of the endocrine pancreas revealed a profound reduction in the number and size of identifiable islets of the hyperglycemic dogs compared with islets from their own pancreases resected months earlier and with those from pancreatic remnants of eight subtotally depancreatized control dogs that had not been subjected to chronic hyperglycemic clamping. The reduction in number and size of islets of the hyperglycemic dogs was largely the consequence of depletion of insulin-containing cells and was similar to that of dogs with long-standing alloxan-induced diabetes. In the eight control dogs, clinical evidence of diabetes did not develop during a follow-up period of 193-296 days. In this group, there was no evidence of diminution of intravenous glucose tolerance, of the insulin response to glucose or arginine, or of insulin sensitivity as determined by an acute hyperinsulinemic hyperglycemic clamp. The number and size of islets and number of beta-cells in pancreatic remnants from these dogs did not differ morphometrically from those of the pancreatic segment that had been resected. We conclude that in subtotally depancreatized but nondiabetic dogs, maintenance of constant hyperglycemia of greater than or equal to 250 mg/dl by means of intravenous glucose infusion causes a severe, persistent, and often insulin-requiring diabetic state that does not occur in the absence of the hyperglycemia.\r"

Herein, we report that beta-cells have two capillary faces. When viewed in cross section, 8-10 beta-cells form a tubelike structure around a central capillary. The outer side of each beta-cell also abuts a capillary. A clear polarity of secretory granules was seen on the ultrastructural level when the beta-cells were partially degranulated by prior in vivo treatment with glyburide. Of the remaining granules, 75.7 +/- 1.7% were accumulated in the apical portion of the cell, even though this portion was only 50.4 +/- 3.2% of the cytoplasm. beta-Cells around a particular cross-sectioned capillary shared the same orientation of granular accumulation.

  ".W": "Chicken embryos are a suitable model for studying the role of insulin, insulin-like growth factors I and II (IGF-I and IGF-II), and their receptors in embryogenesis. We show that plasma membranes from heart, liver, and limb buds, as reported earlier for brain, each have a distinct developmental profile for insulin receptors and type I IGF receptors. In heart and limb buds, IGF binding is higher than insulin binding, but in liver, insulin receptors dominate. Expression of these receptors is, therefore, developmentally regulated and tissue specific. The wide distribution of high-affinity receptors capable of mediating insulin and IGF actions in early organogenesis further supports the possible importance of this family of peptides for differentiation and growth in vertebrates. In all chicken embryo tissues studied, both IGF-I and IGF-II appeared to bind to a type I IGF receptor. We have not detected a receptor with the peptide binding and structural characteristics of the mammalian type II IGF receptor. The type II receptor was absent in embryos, liver from newly hatched chicks, and adipocytes from older chicks, which suggests that the chicken may lack this subtype of IGF receptor.\r"

  ".U": "88196646\r", 
  ".W": "With biochemical and enzymatic treatment of frozen sections of pancreas, we have previously shown that cytoplasmic islet cell antibodies (ICAs) react with carbohydrate determinants of islet cell glycoconjugates. As a first step toward purifying these glycoconjugates, human pancreas tissue was extracted in a mixture of chloroform and methanol, and the glycolipids were obtained by effecting a Folch partition. The protein pellet, lipid fraction, and glycolipid fraction so obtained were assessed for their ability to block the binding of ICAs to frozen sections of human pancreas, the effect being quantitated with a photometer. Only the glycolipid extract could block ICA binding, and blocking was dose dependent. Subfractionation of the glycolipid extract by hydrophobic interaction on C18 cartridges demonstrated that blocking activity resided in the fraction bound and eluted with methanol, consistent with the autoantigen being a glycolipid. Furthermore, the binding of an anti-islet cell ganglioside monoclonal antibody, 3G5, could be blocked with these extracts, whereas the binding of an anti-islet cell protein monoclonal antibody, 4F2, was unaffected. The major gangliosides of the pancreas were seen to be GM3 and GD3 by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). Fractions scraped and eluted from TLC plates were tested for their ability to block ICA binding to pancreatic sections. Neither GM3- nor GD3-containing fractions could block ICA binding; however, a fraction containing minor pancreatic gangliosides (including GM2) of monosialoganglioside mobility was a potent inhibitor of ICA binding to pancreas sections. TLC of a chloroform-methanol extract of human islets demonstrated that islets differentially express monosialogangliosides (especially GM2).\r"

The gene, which is approximately 35,000 base pairs, is interrupted by nine intervening sequences or introns. The sequence of the HepG2 glucose-transporter protein predicted from the gene sequence differs from that determined from the published cDNA sequence in having Leu rather than Phe at position 152. In addition, there are several other nucleotide differences between the gene and cDNA sequences in both the coding region and 3'-untranslated region that do not alter the amino acid sequence of the protein. The sequence of the promoter and the site of transcription initiation have also been determined. The promoter region includes a TATA motif and two binding sites for the transcription factor Spl as well as a sequence that is found in the promoter region of several phorbol ester-inducible genes.\r"

  ".U": "88196677\r", 
  ".W": "Rapidly rising malpractice premiums have profoundly altered patterns of obstetrical practice. In the summer of 1986, the state of Washington enacted major tort reform legislation intended to stabilize the costs of liability insurance. Following passage of the legislation, we surveyed obstetricians, family physicians, and midwives in the state to assess the likely impact of tort reform on future practice patterns. Largely because of malpractice concerns, 40% of family physicians, 15% of obstetricians, and 27% of midwives had discontinued obstetrical practice. Although obstetrical participation has decreased most dramatically for family physicians, the mean number of deliveries per physician has increased to the extent that the proportion of deliveries attended by family physicians has remained stable at about 30%. However, as fewer family physicians practice obstetrics, the availability of care has diminished in rural areas. The passage of tort reform legislation has induced one-third of those respondents currently practicing obstetrics to at least temporarily continue to practice obstetrics. Despite tort reform, however, the majority of respondents either do not provide or ration care to the medically indigent. The major deleterious social impact of the professional liability problem is reduced access to care in rural areas and a severe curtailment of care to the medically indigent. Tort reform alone will not solve these problems.\r"

The study population was low risk overall, with a perinatal mortality rate of 11 per 1000 and a primary cesarean section rate of 9.7%. The predictive ability of the scores was tested for individual outcomes as well as for a \"combined measure\" designed to group outcomes of clinical interest. Outcome variables examined included labor arrests, need for augmentation of labor, fetal heartrate abnormalities during labor, selection of or transfer to a more intensive level of care, indicated forceps delivery, cesarean section, resuscitation, Apgar scores, permanent injury, and perinatal deaths. Along with expected differences in sensitivity and specificity, there were differences among the three scores in performance as measured by positive and negative predictive value. Goodwin's system performed somewhat better overall. All three systems performed better in multiparous than in primiparous patients, but primiparas experienced more adverse outcomes.\r"

  ".W": "Five cases of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma of the liver are reported. This unusual type of vascular tumor is often difficult to diagnose; its angiogenic nature is not overt at the radiologic level and may be overlooked by conventional histologic examination. At imaging procedures, epithelioid hemangioendothelioma of the liver presents as multiple focal hypovascular areas, disseminated in both lobes. The combination of these imaging abnormalities with a peculiar set of demographic and clinical features, including young age, good general condition, and progressive course, is suggestive. However, the final diagnosis can be established only by histologic examination of appropriate material collected by guided liver biopsies and may be helped by immunohistochemistry and ultrastructural examination. The accurate diagnosis of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma of the liver is of clinical and therapeutic relevance. In view of its favorable clinical course, orthotopic liver transplantation may be considered for the treatment of this tumor when intrahepatic dissemination contraindicates partial hepatectomy and extrahepatic extension, excluded by exploratory laparotomy, is absent.\r"

We report 4 representative cases and review 91 additional cases from the literature. The ulcers arose in esophagus, hiatus hernias, abdominal stomach, and near anastomoses, and the predominant predisposing factor was previous surgery to the esophagogastric region. Whereas penetrating esophageal ulcers had a slightly better prognosis than gastric lesions, the principal determinant of clinical presentation, findings, and prognosis was the site of cardiac involvement. The clinicopathological features of pericardial, atrial, and ventricular involvement are distinct. We evaluate the different implications of these features for diagnosis, management, and prognosis and make some tentative recommendations regarding diagnostic procedures and treatment. Early diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention are critical to successful treatment of this entity, which may present with predominantly cardiac or gastrointestinal symptomatology.\r"

These problems can be managed by awareness of the risks and prophylactic intervention rather than by desperate steps when acute problems occur in treatment. Airway obstruction is the major problem in managing patients with such deformities in the preoperative period, at the time of intubation, during the operation, and in the early postoperative period. Congenital craniofacial problems that may lead to airway difficulties are extremely rare, and for physicians to gain sufficient experience to prevent morbidity, these patients should be referred to regional centers, where at least two or three such operations are performed per week.\r"

The hemodynamic effects of wound excision to fascia have been studied in eight patients with second- and third-degree burns ranging from 42% to 70% total body surface area (TBSA) undergoing debridement and skin-grafting procedures. The study was performed on the 4th to the 51st postburn day when all patients were in a hyperdynamic state. Serial hemodynamic measurements, including arterial and mixed-venous blood O2 saturation and content, were made before induction of anesthesia, during surgery both before and after wound excision, and in the recovery room a few hours after surgery. During anesthesia, the elevated CO decreased probably as a consequence of decreased metabolic requirements, but no further hemodynamic change was observed following wound excision. The size of burn wound excised to fascia averaged 24% TBSA and ranged from one-third to more than one-half of the initial burn. With discontinuation of anesthesia, CO rose rapidly above preoperative values, apparently to meet a similar increase in oxygen consumption. The excision of large areas of burned tissue did not attenuate the hyperdynamic circulation in burned patients, at least during and immediately after surgery. The data suggest that the elevated blood flow in the burn wound does not play a significant role in the pathogenesis of the hyperdynamic state.\r"

From 1978 to 1986, halo traction was used as an immobilizing device and as a protective frame for 31 patients with burns to the head (n = 8), face (n = 24), and neck (n = 28). The patients ranged in age from 8 months to 80 years (mean = 16 years) and had second- and third-degree burns covering a total body surface area of 8% to 75% (mean = 28%). The halo was used for an average of eight days (range one to 19 days) and served to immobilize and protect areas of fresh skin grafts, as well as to elevate and protect scalp donor sites (n = 10). Traction was initially used in patients who were confused and uncooperative, and in patients whose burns involved the neck to provide extension for prophylaxis against contractures. Treatment side effects included intermittent headache and backache, the latter occurring especially in the patients subjected to hyperextension. Eight patients (26%) complained of discomfort, which was reduced with adequate analgesia, sedation, and emotional support. The halo had to be removed from one patient after one day because of a loose pin, and in another patient after eight days because of the development of cellulitis at a pin site. Halo immobilization was used successfully to minimize graft loss in 30 of 31 patients.\r"

Since insulin has an essential growth-promoting influence in the fetus, these experiments were designed to determine whether GH can function as a growth factor with insulin-releasing activity by stimulating insulin gene expression during embryogenesis. Pancreatic islets were isolated from human fetuses (n = 36) of 18-22 weeks gestational age. Insulin gene expression was quantified by measuring insulin mRNA by blot hybridization analysis using a [32P] cDNA probe encoding human insulin. We found that by 48 h of culture insulin gene expression was stimulated by 1.25 micrograms recombinant human GH/mL medium to 216% of the control value (n = 2). Insulin secretory capacity was expressed as a fractional stimulation ratio (FSR = F2/F1) of insulin release rates during two successive 1-h static incubations. After 48 h of culture 1.25 micrograms/mL GH stimulated the FSR value to 273% of the control value (n = 5). We conclude that recombinant human GH significantly enhances the steady state level of insulin mRNA concurrent with an increase in insulin secretory capacity, hence providing evidence for a regulatory function of GH on insulin gene expression during fetal development.\r"

Insulin binding to erythrocytes, cultured lymphocytes, and fibroblasts from the patient were decreased to less than 20% of normal, whereas insulin-like growth factor I binding to fibroblasts was normal. Antiinsulin receptor antibody binding to cultured lymphocytes was also decreased to 20% of normal, indicating a decreased concentration of insulin receptors on the cell surface. The ability of insulin to stimulate D-[14C]glucose uptake was decreased to 35% of normal in the patient's fibroblasts, and the dose-response curve was shifted to the right. With time, the insulin resistance fluctuated from near normal (fasting insulin, 244.0 pmol/L) to severe resistance (fasting insulin, 5740-9328 pmol/L), and an insulin tolerance test revealed amelioration of insulin resistance during remission. However, insulin binding to erythrocytes and adipocytes was decreased persistently to 20% of normal. These results indicate that the patient had a primary defect in her insulin receptors, i.e. decreased insulin receptor concentration. The variable degree of insulin resistance was possibly due to variable receptor function in the signal transmission process.\r"

High concentrations of immunoreactive (IR) CRH have been recently demonstrated in maternal plasma during pregnancy. To determine if the human placenta secretes CRH and POMC-derived peptides, we developed an in vitro human placental fragment perifusion system. The perifused tissue released IR-CRH and POMC-derived peptides at a constant rate for at least 5 h. The mean IR-CRH concentration in the effluent (under basal conditions) was 158 +/- 26 (+/- SD) pg (34.5 +/- 5.8 fmol)/5-min fraction.g tissue. IR-alpha MSH, IR-beta-endorphin, and IR-ACTH were also released into the perifusion medium; the mean concentration of alpha MSH released was 24.6 +/- 8 pg (14.8 +/- 4.8 fmol)/fraction.g, that of ACTH was 2.9 +/- 1.9 pg (0.65 +/- 0.43 fmol)/fraction.g, and that of beta-endorphin was 12.9 +/- 6 pg (3.8 +/- 1.7 fmol)/fraction.g. We examined the effects of human CRH, oxytocin, vasopressin, and dexamethasone on placental POMC peptide secretion. Five-minute pulses of 10(-8) or 10(-6) mol/L human CRH or oxytocin produced an immediate and dose-dependent increase in all POMC peptides in the effluent. A 5-min pulse of 10(-8) or 10(-6) mol/L vasopressin had no effect. A continuous 4-h exposure to 10(-6) mol/L dexamethasone had no effect on either basal IR-CRH or POMC-derived peptide or their KCl-induced release. In conclusion, we found that 1) human placenta releases IR-CRH and POMC-derived peptides in vitro; this phenomenon seems to be independent of glucocorticoid control; 2) placental CRH may have a paracrine effect on placental POMC peptide release in addition to its possible action on maternal pituitary hormone release; and 3) oxytocin, but not vasopressin, stimulates placental POMC peptide release.\r"

Weight loss of 15.4 +/- 2.0 kg (mean +/- SE) resulted in decreased fasting insulin [20.2 +/- 2.5 to 9.8 +/- 2.5 microU/mL (145 +/- 18 to 70 +/- 18 pmol/L); P less than 0.02] and C-peptide (850 +/- 80 to 630 +/- 110 pmol/L; P less than 0.05) levels. The plasma glucose response to oral glucose and iv glucagon was improved with unchanged peripheral insulin levels. When plasma glucose levels were matched to those before weight loss, peripheral serum insulin and plasma C-peptide responses to iv glucagon were increased and similar to those in obese nondiabetic subjects studied at euglycemia. The total insulin response (area under the curve) to iv glucagon was reduced 30% (P less than 0.005), while the total C-peptide response area did not change after weight loss. At matched hyperglycemia, the total response area was enhanced 72% for insulin (P less than 0.002) and 64% for C-peptide (P less than 0.001). Incremental (above basal) response areas after weight loss did not change for insulin, but increased 66% for C-peptide (P less than 0.05). The incremental areas were augmented nearly 2-fold (196%) for insulin (P less than 0.01) and 1.7-fold (173%) for C-peptide (P less than 0.01) when assessed at matched hyperglycemia. Both basal (7.3 +/- 0.5 to 14.1 +/- 1.8; P less than 0.01) and total stimulated (6.1 +/- 0.4 to 8.8 +/- 1.4; P less than 0.05) C-peptide to insulin molar ratios increased after weight loss. We conclude that after weight loss in noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, 1) insulin secretion is decreased in the basal state but increased after stimulation; 2) changes in insulin secretion are reflected by peripheral levels of C-peptide but not insulin, due in part to enhanced hepatic insulin extraction; and 3) at matched levels of hyperglycemia insulin secretion is markedly increased and similar to that in obese nondiabetic subjects studied at euglycemia.\r"

[125I]Insulin binding varied widely and did not correlate with fasting plasma immunoreactive insulin levels or insulin sensitivity, as assessed by the ED50 values of insulin stimulation of glucose transport or insulin inhibition of lipolysis in isolated abdominal wall adipocytes obtained by biopsy from the patients. In contrast there was a significant correlation between loss of stimulation of autophosphorylation in solubilized receptors and loss of insulin sensitivity for both stimulation of glucose transport (r = -0.59; P less than 0.005) and inhibition of lipolysis (r = -0.54; P less than 0.01). There was also a significant inverse correlation between insulin's ability to stimulate receptor autophosphorylation and in vivo insulin resistance, as assessed by fasting plasma insulin levels (r = -0.46; P less than 0.05). These data indicate a significant correlation between changes in sensitivity of glucose transport and antilipolysis to insulin and receptor kinase activity in those patients and suggest that defective coupling of insulin binding to insulin action at the level of phosphorylation of the insulin receptor may cause the insulin resistance in this group of patients.\r"

The overall pattern showed agreement between the grading (by previously accepted methods) of asphyxia in the perinatal period and our new biochemical approach. The association with handicap at one year of age following asphyxia was complex. This biochemical technique could be used to exclude postasphyxial damage as a cause of clinical disturbances and to select a small group (0.1% of all births) who require further investigation for rarer disorders which may also cause long term handicap.\r"

In general, argentaffin staining and immunological detection of 5HT failed to pick up tumours derived from the foregut of type B or type D morphology. Argentaffin negative tumours usually showed only focal immunoreactivity for 5HT. If immunological detection of 5HT is used alone as a marker for carcinoid tumours problems arise in the differentiation of carcinoid tumours from adenocarcinomas which may also contain 5HT. These results were compared with those culled from other reported techniques used as an aid to the diagnosis of carcinoid tumours.\r"

There were striking differences between the lectin binding characteristics of the different cell types in the normal pancreas. Acinar cells were uniformly positive for binding with wheat germ agglutinin and soy bean agglutinin while islet cells were usually negative for these lectins. Ulex europaeus I lectin however, was found not to be specific for endothelium, showing positivity also for acinar and ductal tissue. Griffonia simplicifolia II lectin was found to be highly specific for ductal epithelium, and because of this was tested in a hamster pancreatic cancer model where it was not specific for ductal epithelium, reflecting differing carbohydrate expression in the hamster pancreas. Pancreatic carcinomas and chronic pancreatitis bound all five lectins without any qualitative distinction from each other or from normal pancreatic tissue, but there was increased intensity of peanut agglutinin binding to secreted mucins in pancreatic carcinoma, which may be of potential use in radiolabelled lectin scanning.\r"

Diabetic patients had a higher prevalence of renal failure, proteinuria, retinopathy, neuropathy, and infections than did other nursing home residents. Macroangiopathic disease tended to be equally common in both age groups. Diabetic nursing home residents had higher body weights compared to nondiabetic nursing home residents. Surprisingly, however, 21% of nursing home diabetics were greater than 20% below average body weight (compared to 24.5% of other nursing home residents), suggesting that undernutrition is a major problem in diabetic patients in a nursing home setting. Overall, the diabetic nursing home patients had better blood glucose control than younger ambulatory diabetic patients (mean age 66.2 +/- 4.7 years). The glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1) level in those on oral agents was 8.9% +/- 0.7% for nursing home patients compared to 11.8% +/- 0.7% in ambulatory patients (P less than 0.01). The HbA1 in insulin-treated patients was similarly lower in nursing home diabetics (9.6% +/- 0.4% vs 11.8% +/- 0.7, P less than 0.05). There were only two mild hypoglycemic episodes in nursing home patients over 6-month observation period, whereas 12 ambulatory patients reported hypoglycemic episodes during the same period of time. We conclude that although the diabetic nursing home patients are sicker than the ambulatory diabetics, it is possible to achieve a fair blood glucose control in nursing home patients without a significant risk of recurrent hypoglycemia.\r"

Haloperidol, thioridazine, and flurazepam were the most frequently prescribed drugs of those examined. The study also investigated the relationship of demographic and institutional variables to the probability of drug administration and the amount administered. These variables were most strongly related to the probability of antipsychotic, antiparkinson, and antimanic (lithium) administration. The association of these variables with the amount of drug administered was strongest for antimanic and antipsychotic medications, particularly the latter. In all analyses, the addition of institutional variables increased goodness of fit minimally over that produced by demographic variables alone. This finding supports the conclusion that the prescription of psychotropic medication is more influenced by individual patient characteristics than by the nature of the institutional setting in which the patient resides.\r"

This review stresses the particular features of coronary disease in the aged and contrasts them with features more readily recognized in younger patients. Changes in the development of angina pectoris, heart failure, and the diagnosis of myocardial infarction vary significantly in the elderly population.

  ".W": "An hypothesis is presented which emphasizes the key role of specific trophic factor-receptor interactions in the development of the brain. We postulate that very early in development neurons become dependent on external factors (mainly neuropeptides) for guidance and survival. These requirements are the key to the selection process which results in the creation of a functional nervous system. These specific localized trophic factor requirements are postulated to persist throughout life. Disruptions in specific trophic factor-receptor systems are postulated to be responsible for a variety of age-related neurodegenerative diseases. The implications of recent animal and human transplant experiments in the context of the theoretical framework discussed above are profound. It would appear that the mature mammalian brain possesses an exquisite ability to regenerate specific connections to replace those lost due to death or injury to nerve cells. Unfortunately, it does not contain a population of undifferentiated stem cells to supply the necessary healthy neurons. The reason for this appears obvious based on the theoretical considerations given above, that the specific trophic factor-receptor interactions needed to produce a functional brain circuitry are necessarily stringently selective. Therefore, a significant stem cell population does not survive. However, if an appropriate stem cell population, ie, a fetal transplant, is provided, the brain will \"heal itself\" according to the program outlined above. In the future it may be technically feasible to perform genetic testing of newborns to determine to which genetic neurological diseases they are susceptible and at an appropriate time provide the appropriate fetal transplant. Obviously, society will have to deal with the profound ethical questions this technology will raise.\r"

No routine, noninvasive laboratory test can confirm the diagnosis. Renal arteriography is the procedure of choice after excretory urograms have ruled out an obstructive uropathy. Early assessment of kidney viability is important. The endpoints of emergency treatment are to decrease symptoms, decrease diastolic blood pressure to less than or equal to 105 mm Hg, and to maintain urine output at greater than 50 mL/h. Restoration of a lower blood pressure must not be so prompt that renal perfusion decreases too rapidly. Definitive surgical treatment versus medical management of the renal artery occlusion remains a controversial topic. Where surgery is not feasible, medical management consists of streptokinase acutely followed by heparin and then chronic coumarin therapy.\r"

  ".U": "88198913\r", 
  ".W": "Atrial flutter is a supraventricular tachydysrhythmia believed to arise from electrophysiologic disturbances in the atria. It tends to be an unstable rhythm and is usually associated with intrinsic cardiac or pulmonary disease or adverse extrinsic influences on the heart. It is due to either a reentry mechanism or an increased atrial automaticity. Atrial depolarization is regular at a rate of 260 to 340 beats per minute. With a normal atrioventricular (AV) node there is usually a physiologic second-degree block with resultant 2:1 conduction. Higher degrees of AV block can occur in patients with AV nodal disease, increased vagal tone, or when certain drugs are in use. One-to-one conduction may occur in patients with accessory AV nodal pathways. In this situation, serious adverse effects are often seen, including palpitations, dizziness, syncope, angina, and dyspnea. Electrical cardioversion is the safest and most reliable way of terminating atrial flutter and its use should not be delayed in an unstable patient. In the nonemergent situation a variety of medications alone or in combination can be used to convert the rhythm or slow ventricular response.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, it has been demonstrated that lymphocyte function-associated Ag (LFA-3) is a natural ligand for CD2 and that this receptor-ligand interaction functions in cell-cell adhesion. In this report, we demonstrate that LFA-3 plays a role in T cell activation. L cells were transfected with human genomic DNA and sorted for expression of LFA-3. We demonstrate that LFA-3+ L cells, together with anti-CD3 mAb or with suboptimal doses of PHA, stimulate proliferation of human peripheral blood T cells. Furthermore, thymocyte proliferation was induced by LFA-3+ L cells and suboptimal doses of PHA. Proliferation was inhibited by mAb directed against either CD2 or LFA-3. Stimulation of thymocytes by the combination of PHA and LFA-3+ L cells resulted in the increased expression of the IL-2R, as well as of the surface Ag 4F2, transferrin receptor, and HLA-DR. These data support the conclusion that LFA-3 plays a role in CD2-dependent T cell activation. LFA-3 is widely distributed and is expressed on all APC and target cells. Thus, the ability of the CD2/LFA-3 interaction to costimulate with an anti-CD3 mAb suggests that the CD2/LFA-3 interaction may be involved not only in an Ag-independent alternate pathway of T cell activation but also in Ag-specific T cell activation.\r"

  ".W": "Mice given multiple doses of sublethal irradiation to both the thymus and the peripheral lymphoid tissues showed major transient, and some persistent disruptions in general thymic architecture and in thymic stromal components. At 2 wk after total lymphoid irradiation (TLI), the thymus lacked identifiable medullary regions by immunohistochemical analyses. Medullary stromal cells expression MHC Ag or a medullary epithelial cell Ag, as well as medullary macrophages, were undetectable. Instead, the processes of cortical epithelial cells were observed throughout the entire thymus. Strikingly, thymocyte subsets with mature phenotypes (CD4+CD8- and CD4-CD8+) were present in the apparent absence of a medulla. This early, gross effect was rapidly reversed such that by 1 to 2 mo after TLI, medullary areas with MHC Ag-positive cells were evident. However, abnormalities in a subset of medullary stromal cells appeared to be more persistent. Medullary epithelial cells, identified by the MD1 mAb, were greatly reduced in number and abnormally organized for at least 4 mo after TLI. In addition, macrophages containing endogenous peroxidase activity, normally abundant in medullary regions, were undetectable at all times examined after TLI. Therefore, this irradiation regimen induced both transient and long term effects in the thymus, primarily in medullary regions. These results suggest that TLI may be used as an experimental tool for studying the impact of selective depletion of medullary stromal cells on the development of specific T cell functions.\r"

Two were KLH-dependent both in terms of their own proliferative response and in terms of their help for that of B cells. The other two were autoreactive and helped B cells proliferate independently of the presence of Ag. Both primed and unprimed B cells proliferated to some extent when helped by the KLH-reactive clones in the presence of high concentrations of either KLH or TNP-KLH. Much higher proliferation was, however, induced when primed, but not unprimed, B cells were exposed to the T cells in the presence of low concentrations of TNP-KLH but not KLH, i.e., under conditions favoring direct, cognate interaction between the T and B cells. Only modest IgM, and no IgG or IgA plaque-forming cell (PFC) responses were generated by TNP-primed B cells upon interaction with either autoreactive T cells in the absence of Ag or KLH-reactive T cells in the presence of high concentrations of KLH. For high IgM responses as well as for the appearance of IgG and IgA PFC responses, TNP-KLH was required whatever the source of the T cell help. The isotype ratios depended on the TNP-KLH concentration; IgA responses were highest and IgM responses lowest at the lowest TNP-KLH concentrations suggesting that the precursors of the IgA PFC have higher average affinity for TNP than the precursors of IgM PFC. Overall, the results are compatible with the idea that the precursors of IgA and IgG PFC and many of the precursors of IgM PFC in the long term primed B cell populations used in these experiments require engagement of their Ag-receptors before they express sufficient class II Ag and/or receptors for \"switch\" and differentiation factors for cognate interaction with T cells leading to PFC responses.\r"

The pathogenesis involves autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta-cells. In the present study, inoculation of diabetes-prone BB rats at 30 days of age with a lymphotropic variant of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus significantly reduced the incidence of diabetes. Such virus-inoculated, diabetes-free rats had normal levels of pancreatic insulin and little or no mononuclear cell infiltration in the islets. Virus was recovered from lymphocytes by cocultivation with permissive cells. In contrast, virus was not detected in a wide variety of organs, indicating that infection in BB rats was primarily lymphotropic. PBL analyzed by FACS and monoclonal markers showed a marked reduction of pan-T. Th, and T suppressor/cytotoxic lymphocyte subsets restricted to 4 and 7 days after infection when compared with numbers of lymphocytes in uninoculated diabetes-prone rats. To prevent IDDM, replicating virus was required, because the expected incidence of IDDM in diabetes prone rats inoculated with UV-inactivated virus was equivalent to that of untreated animals. These results suggest that a virus can suppress the autoimmune response that would otherwise have caused IDDM and may be useful as a probe in dissecting the molecular basis of this autoimmune disorder.\r"

Because immune responsiveness has not been defined in this strain, a study was designed to assay primary splenic plaque-forming cell (PFC) responses to thymus-dependent (TD) and thymus-independent (TI) Ag. Initial surveys of PN mice inoculated with the TD Ag SRBC showed adequate production of IgM PFC, but small numbers of IgG PFC were developed with polyspecific antiserum. In contrast, H-2-compatible DBA/1 control mice gave the expected responses to SRBC (IgG plaques elevated twofold compared with IgM plaques). PN mice had the usual responses to Ag that are largely TI; both PN and DBA/1 mice had active IgM and modest IgG responses to TNP-LPS and TNP-Ficoll. Additional experiments determined that PN mice had similar patterns of defective IgG responses to several different TD Ag (SRBC, horse RBC, and DNP-keyhole limpet hemocyanin). In each instance, the usual predominance of IgG1 plaques was absent, and total numbers of plaques developed with antisera specific for IgG isotypes were suppressed. Defective PN IgG production was evident as early as 3 wk of age, was not influenced by aging to 43 wk, and was not corrected by increasing the antigenic challenge 10-fold. PN spleen cells treated with monoclonal anti-Thy-1.2 and C were injected with pools of DBA/1 T cells into 850-rad irradiated (DBA/1 x PN)F1 hybrids. These recipients expressed low IgG1 responses to SRBC, suggesting that the B cell-containing fraction that was not lysed by anti-Thy-1.2 transferred the PN defect. PN mice, which do not respond to TD Ag with active IgG production, contradict the proposal that autoimmunity is associated with hyper-responsiveness to TD and TI Ag.\r"

  ".W": "Vitiligo is a human disorder which destroys pigment cells in the skin, ears, eyes, and meningeal tissues and has often been associated with a variety of autoimmune disorders. The C57BL/Ler-vit/vit mouse is a mutant strain that exhibits a loss of epidermal pigment cells and a selective cell-mediated immune deficiency to epicutaneous-administered allergens. This observation is consistent with that observed in humans with vitiligo, who also exhibit loss of contact hypersensitivity (CHS), that appears to be associated with loss of pigment cells from the epidermis. Other cellular immune parameters such as delayed type hypersensitivity and antibody generation to both particulate and soluble Ag are normal or even hyperimmune in the vit/vit mice compared with congenic C57BL/6 controls. Cyclophosphamide treatment could reconstitute CHS responsiveness of the vit/vit mice to the allergen dinitrofluorobenzene. Further, this loss of CHS responsiveness to dinitrofluorobenzene could be restored with skin transplants from normal pigmented C57BL/6 mice to vit/vit mice. Normal C57BL/6 mice bearing white skin grafts from vit/vit mice did not contact sensitize. We suggest that this vit/vit mouse strain may serve as an excellent system to investigate various aspects of other contact hypersensitivity reactions as well as vitiligo.\r"

  ".W": "Although administration of rIL-2 post-T depleted allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (TD-BMT) offers the prospect of augmenting immune reconstitution and thereby reducing the risks of infection and relapse, it has been unclear what direct or indirect effects this agent would have on the regenerating myeloid system. We find that addition of 200 IU or rIL-2 to patient lymphocytes obtained within 6 wk of TD-BMT results in a substantial (2 to 3 log) increase in INF-gamma secretion and the production of TNF. Cytokines present in supernatants obtained from IL-2-stimulated patient lymphocytes have two contrasting effects on myeloid cells from normal donors and from marrow recipients. They prime granulocytes for enhanced oxidative metabolism as measured by ability to generate chemiluminescence in response to FMLP, whereas IL-2 added directly to neutrophils has no effect. However, these IL-2-induced cytokines also act to inhibit myeloid progenitor growth and reduce granulocyte macrophage (GM) colony formation by a mean of 53%. Preincubation of supernatants with anti-IFN-gamma antibody partially abrogates both enhancement of granulocyte chemiluminescence and suppression of marrow CFU-GM. Addition of IL-2 directly to recipient marrow also produces inhibition, leading to a 25% reduction of GM-colony growth. This effect is not due to direct interaction between myeloid progenitor cells and IL-2, because it is completely abrogated by removal of CD8 and Leu-7+ lymphocytes from the marrow. Although the suppressive effects on marrow growth in vitro are of particular concern after BMT, the potential of IL-2 to promote granulocyte function, immune reconstitution, and anti-leukemic activity after TD-BMT justify further consideration of IL-2 therapy in this setting.\r"

  ".W": "The recombinant cytokines IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha stimulate several macrophage-mediated functions important in host defense. However, systemic administration of cytokines may be limited by significant host toxicity. We investigated whether aerosolized cytokines can stimulate alveolar macrophage and blood monocyte function, and whether they induce an inflammatory response in the lungs of normal rats. We found that aerosolized murine rIFN-gamma or recombinant human TNF-alpha increased IL-1 production by both alveolar macrophages and blood monocytes for at least 5 days after administration. Furthermore, murine rIFN-gamma increased the expression of Ia Ag on alveolar macrophages and human rTNF-alpha increased alveolar macrophage- and blood monocyte-mediated tumor lysis. Sequential aerosolization of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha significantly increased both IL-1 release and Ia expression compared to either cytokine administered alone. Aerosolized human rTNF-alpha achieved lung levels comparable to those produced by an i.v. TNF-alpha dose reported to cause diffuse organ injury and death in rats. However, plasma TNF-alpha levels were several thousand-fold lower after aerosol administration. Aerosolized cytokines did not induce lung edema or an inflammatory cell infiltrate within the airways or alveoli. Aerosolized human rTNF-alpha alone, or murine rIFN-gamma and human rTNF-alpha, induced margination of leukocytes in pulmonary blood vessels 1 day after aerosolization, and a few small foci of pulmonary hemorrhage 5 days later. We conclude that aerosol administration of IFN-gamma or TNF-alpha enhances both pulmonary and systemic monocyte function, and that the combination of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha produce additive or synergistic effects. Aerosolized cytokines induce only a minimal pulmonary inflammatory response. Aerosolized TNF-alpha produces high cytokine levels in the lung but very low uptake into the circulation.\r"

The reactivity of two anti-B27 mAb (B27M1 and B27M2) with envelope proteins of Shigella flexneri isolated from Reiter's syndrome patients was studied by Western blot analysis. Proteins with an apparent Mr of approximately 36 and 23 kDa reacted with both mAb in ascites. mAb against related HLA class I Ag B7 and B40 did not react with the 23 kDa protein. Relatively high concentrations of antibody were required for reactivity, suggesting a low affinity interaction. Additional evidence for cross-reactive epitopes was obtained by ELISA against whole envelope and by using unsolubilized envelope to inhibit binding of M1 and M2 to B27-positive cell lines, as measured by quantitative flow microfluorimetry. The presence of cross-reactive proteins was not related to the presence of the intact virulence-associated plasmid or the invasive phenotype. Two Shigella sonnei isolates not implicated as causative agents of Reiter's syndrome or reactive arthritis showed a similar pattern of cross-reactivity. These results indicate that cross-reactive epitopes may be present on \"arthritogenic\" bacteria, but their presence is not a unique feature of such strains and is not the sole factor in induction of arthritis in B27-positive individuals.\r"

  ".W": "Guinea pig platelets reportedly contain receptors specific for the anaphylatoxin C3a based on both ligand-binding studies and functional responses. A portion of the human 125I-C3a that binds to guinea pig platelets is competitively displaced by excess unlabeled C3a; however, the majority of ligand uptake was nonspecific. Uptake of 125I-C3a by guinea pig platelets is maximal in 1 min, and stimulation of guinea pig platelets by thrombin, ADP, or the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 showed little influence on binding of the ligand. Scatchard analysis indicated that approximately 1200 binding sites for C3a exist per cell with an estimated Kd of 8 x 10(-10) M. Human C3a des Arg also binds to guinea pig platelets, but Scatchard analysis indicated that no specific binding occurred. Because the ligand-binding studies were complicated by high levels of nonspecific uptake, we attempted to chemically cross-link the C3a molecule to a specific component on the platelet surface. Cross-linkage of 125I-C3a to guinea pig platelets with bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate revealed radioactive complexes at 105,000 and 115,000 m.w. on SDS-PAGE gels by autoradiographic analysis. In the presence of excess unlabeled C3a, complex formation was inhibited. No cross-linkage could be demonstrated between the inactive 125I-C3a des Arg and the putative C3a-R on guinea pig platelets. Human C3a, but not C3a des Arg induces serotonin release and aggregation of the guinea pig platelets. Human C3a was unable to induce either serotonin release or promote aggregation of human platelets. Uptake of human 125I-C3a by human platelets was not saturable, and Scatchard analysis was inconclusive. Attempts to cross-link 125I-C3a to components on the surface of human platelets also failed to reveal a ligand-receptor complex. Therefore, we conclude that guinea pig platelets have specific surface receptors to C3a and that human platelets appear devoid of receptors to the anaphylatoxin.\r"

Rabbit anti-idiotypic sera were raised against Hed 10 and ADP 1. By affinity chromatography it was shown that at least 20 to 30% of DNA-binding antibodies contained these idiotypes. The sera were also used to evaluate idiotypic cross-reactivity among 26 diverse, predominantly anti-nucleic acid, murine mAb. Each serum bound directly to several mAb and in addition inhibited the binding of several antibodies to their appropriate Ag. The anti-Hed 10 serum detected an idiotype which was restricted to antibodies that bound to poly(dT) and/or poly(ADP-ribose). The anti-ADP 1 serum detected a more widely distributed idiotype contained in antibodies which bound to a variety of nucleic acids. Although both sera bound directly to Hed 10, only the anti-Hed 10 serum could compete for the binding of Hed 10 to poly(dT). On the other hand, both sera could compete for the binding of ADP 1 to poly(ADP-ribose) as well as bind directly to ADP 1. In addition anti-ADP 1 serum appeared to enhance, rather than inhibit, the binding of one mAb to native calf thymus DNA and poly[d(AT)] but had no effect on the binding to several ssDNA. These results demonstrate that many antibodies which recognize DNA and poly(ADP-ribose) have shared idiotypes. This may be of relevance to the development of autoimmunity because poly(ADP-ribose) is ubiquitous and immunogenic.\r"

  ".W": "Sequential precipitation analysis of BALB/c Ag revealed two distinct antigenic forms of the Ld molecule distinguished by their reactivity with mAb 30-5-7. A similar analysis of Ag from the Ld transfectant T1.1.1 confirmed that both forms of Ld are products of the Ld gene. The 30-5-7+ form of Ld was found to be capable of association with beta-2 microglobulin (beta 2m) but could also exist as a free H chain, whereas the 30-5-7- form of Ld was incapable of beta 2m association. Unexpectedly, this latter form of Ld showed oligosaccharide maturation as well as cell surface expression, although less efficiently than the 30-5-7+ form of Ld. Pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that these two forms of Ld do not share a precursor-product relationship, but rather their distinguishing structures are fixed during de novo synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum and remain constant throughout maturation and expression. Thus, beta 2m association is not an absolute requirement for intracellular transport and expression on the plasma membrane even in beta 2m+ cell types. Furthermore, in the context of other recent studies of Ld and Db, our results suggest that beta 2m plays a key role in folding the outer domains of class I molecules during de novo synthesis. It is speculated that beta 2m may provide a support structure analogous to a class II second domain, on which the class I binding site can be properly formed.\r"

This chemotaxin was purified to apparent homogeneity by sequential Gel G-75 permeation chromatography, wide pore reversed phase (RP-8) HPLC, size exclusion HPLC, and reversed phase (RP-18) HPLC. Additional characterization of this lymphocyte-derived neutrophil-activating peptide (LYNAP) resulted in a single peak upon reversed phase HPLC and size exclusion HPLC. SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions revealed a single line at 10 kDa. LYNAP stimulated neutrophil chemotaxis (ED50 of 3 +/- 3 ng/ml), chemokinesis (ED50 of 2 +/- 2 ng/ml), and caused degranulation of cytochalasin B pretreated human neutrophils (ED50 of 20 ng/ml). In purified human monocytes, chemotactic responses to LYNAP at doses up to 100 ng/ml were absent, indicating nonidentity with a lymphocyte-derived monocyte chemotactic factor previously described by other workers. LYNAP shows biochemical and biologic similarities to a recently detected monocyte-derived neutrophil-activating peptide (MONAP). Moreover, desensitization experiments revealed cross-deactivation between LYNAP and MONAP, not, however, between these two chemotactic peptides and other well characterized polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotaxins, e.g., C5a, FMLP, leukotriene B4, or platelet-activating factor. This finding points toward structure identity or homology of both chemotaxins, MONAP and LYNAP.\r"

The changes in the right-angle light scatter of the cell suspensions were also examined. GM-CSF was found not to affect the resting levels of calcium or the internal pH of the cells. However, pre-incubation of the neutrophils with the growth factor resulted in an increase in the magnitude of the calcium transients that follow the stimulation of the cells with chemotactic factors as well as a profound depression of the cell alkalinization that is induced by fMet-Leu-Phe, leukotriene B4, and platelet-activating factor, as well as by phorbol esters. The rapid cytoplasmic acidification elicited by these agents was apparently magnified. GM-CSF did not directly affect the Na+/H+ antiport as GM-CSF-treated cells were as capable as untreated cells of recovering from an acid load. The right-angle light scatter responses of the cells to the chemotactic factors were found not to be affected by GM-CSF. These results provide an initial description of the effects of GM-CSF on the cellular physiology of the neutrophils and insights into the mechanism of action of this factor as well as into the excitation-response coupling sequence activated by chemotactic factors.\r"

In the present study we investigated whether human B and T lymphocytes recognize these conserved regions. The more amino-terminal region, 190.L (corresponding to residues 188-363 of the encoded protein sequence) reacted preferentially with sera from donors living in a malaria-endemic area. Also, EBV-transformed B cells, from a healthy donor living in a malaria-mesoendemic area, were fused with a human-mouse hybrid line (SPM4-0), yielding two hybridomas whose products recognized both 190.L and the fusion protein 190.N, but not the 190.M polypeptide. A large number of p190-specific T cell clones were obtained from PBMC of a noninfected donor, after in vitro stimulation with the recombinant fusion protein 190.N. The clones reacted with intact, parasite-derived p190, as well as either 190.L or 190.M. Four clones that recognized the more amino-terminal fragment also responded to infected E. According to these results the more amino-terminal conserved sequences of p190 have the requisites to be immunogenic in humans.\r"

When purified Leu-11+7-NK, Leu-11-7+, and Leu-11-7-T cells were cultured with rIL 2 (500 U/ml) for 6 days in a medium supplemented with 10% FCS, Leu-11+7-NK cells responded at the maximum level and Leu-11-7+ cells responded moderately as shown by both cell-proliferation response and cytotoxic activity generated. On the other hand, Leu-11-7-T cells did not respond at all to rIL-2. However, when Leu-11-7-T cells were cultured with rIL-2 in a medium supplemented with 10% autologous serum, they showed considerable responsiveness to rIL-2. In addition, much greater response to Leu-11-7-T cells were produced by the addition of monocytes. Monocyte cytokines, neither IL 1, IFN-gamma, TNF, nor their combination were able to substitute for monocytes in the induction culture. In contrast, the response level of Leu-11+7- NK cells remained unchanged irrespective of supplementation with autologous serum to medium or the addition of monocytes to the culture. These results indicated that culture conditions in the experiments significantly affected the results as to determination of lymphokine-activated killer cell precursors, especially the result pertaining to the conversion of T lymphocytes to lymphokine-activated killer cells. Under appropriate conditions, not only NK cells but also T cells are important precursors of lymphokine-activated killer cells.\r"

The mAb B5-5 is specific for low m.w. components on nearly all sheep thymocytes and peripheral T and B lymphocytes but does not label immature B cells in Peyer's patches or germinal centers. After cross-linking of target structures either directly by plastic-bound mAb or indirectly using anti-Ig reagents, peripheral T cells, but not thymocytes or peripheral B cells, were activated. IL-2 was secreted by T cells after cross-linking and activation was strongly augmented in the presence of PMA. The addition of soluble B5-5 mAb to mitogen-stimulated cultures of sheep lymphocytes resulted in a suppression of PHA responses and augmentation of PWM responses and had a variable effect on Con A responses but had no effect on LPS- or protein A-induced proliferation. When added to alloantigen-stimulated cultures, B5-5 augmented the proliferative response. The B5-5 membrane component consists of 14- to 19-kDa glycoproteins but the banding patterns obtained during SDS-PAGE analysis of 125I-labeled Ag differed between thymocytes, peripheral T cells, and peripheral B cells. On the basis of its range of expression on lymphoid cells and known biochemical and functional properties, we conclude that the B5-5 component on sheep lymphocytes is different from T cell activation Ag in other species.\r"

  ".W": "Splenocyte populations from whole body-irradiated recipients of mixed T cell-depleted (TCD) syngeneic and allogeneic (complete H-2 disparity) bone marrow, or of TCD syngeneic marrow alone, contain cells with the ability to suppress the generation of cell-mediated lympholysis responses in vitro. This activity, which is present by 8 days after bone marrow transplantation and persists for several weeks, has been analyzed for possible veto-like or other specificity. Although reproducible patterns of suppression were observed, depending both on host strain and on the genetic combination of the response examined, the overall suppression in vitro most closely resembles that which has been ascribed to \"natural suppressor\" cells in other systems. The suppression appears to be mediated by a non-T cell, non-B cell, nonadherent, asialo GM1-negative population. Cold target inhibition and CTL activity of chimeric cells have been ruled out as factors contributing to the observed suppression. Significantly, in mixed chimeras, suppression was found to be mediated exclusively by cells which were syngeneic to the recipient in both recipient strains tested. The rapid development of this suppressive activity may explain the resistance to graft-vs-host disease conferred on whole body-irradiated mice by the addition of TCD syngeneic marrow to an allogeneic graft-vs-host disease-producing inoculum.\r"

  ".W": "To explore the relationship between CD4 and CD3/Ti on the T cell surface, we have studied a panel of Ag-specific Th cell lines and clones, as well as resting and mitogen-activated CD4+ cells. Our results show that exposure of Th cells to their specific antigenic stimuli, but not to irrelevant stimuli, induced the rapid disappearance of approximately 20 to 35% of CD3 and CD4 molecules. The modulation of these molecules was detected in less than 1 h, became maximal at 12 h, and recovered thereafter in parallel. Treatment of Th cells with anti-CD4 antibody prevented Ag-induced modulation of CD3, and treatment with anti-CD3 blocked modulation of CD4. In the absence of Ag, treatment of these cells with an antibody (WT-31) directed at a conformational determinant within CD3/Ti or with the combination of anti-CD3 antibody and goat anti-mouse Ig, also resulted in significant modulation of CD4. Similar treatment of PHA-activated CD4+ T cells with anti-CD3/Ti antibodies also induced CD4 modulation; however, the same antibodies failed to affect CD4 expression on fresh resting T cells. These results indicate that on activated, but not resting T cells, CD4 molecules can be physically associated with CD3/Ti. We postulate that this association is essential for efficient Th cell activation, and further that the ability of anti-CD4 antibodies to inhibit helper functions is due to their prevention of CD4-CD3/Ti interaction on the T cell surface.\r"

  ".W": "MRL-lpr/lpr mice develop massive lymphadenopathy and autoimmunity. There is evidence that both migration and local proliferation contribute to the accumulation of Ly-2-, L3T4-, 6B2+ T cells in the peripheral lymph node (PLN). Mel-14 is an antibody which binds to the lymphocyte lymph node homing receptor (gp90Mel-14) and can block migration of lymphocytes to the PLN. Treatment of mice from birth to 11 wk of age with Mel-14 and another rat IgG2a mAb, 6B2, resulted in reduction (10- to 20-fold) in lymphadenopathy. Mel-14, but not 6B2, preferentially reduced the percentages of Thy-1+, 6B2+ lymphocytes in the lymph node. Treatment with a third antibody, anti-Ly-1, had no effect on lymphadenopathy. Mel-14 treatment resulted in diversion of the Ly-2-, L3T4-, 6B2+, gp90Mel-14 cells to the spleen and consequently induced marked splenomegaly. Thymocytes from MRL-lpr/lpr and MRL-+/+ mice were analyzed by two-color flow cytometry analysis after depletion of Ly-2+ and L3T4+ T cells. There was no difference in the percent of Ly-2-, L3T4-, 6B2+, gp90Mel-14 positive thymocytes comparing these two strains. Mel-14 treatment did not alter Ig levels or autoantibody production. These studies suggest Mel-14 reduced lymphadenopathy by interfering with homing to PLN, whereas 6B2 may have interfered with marrow production of precursor cells or killed 6B2+ cells after they exited the marrow. The data are consistent with the idea that lymphadenopathy occurs in MRL-lpr/lpr mice due to increased homing gp90-Mel-14 T cells to the PLN and that gp90Mel-14 is a necessary receptor for the abnormal 6B2+ T cells.\r"

Nanogram quantities of either mrIL-1 alpha or mrIL-1 beta induced an acute transient arthritis. Arthritis induced by i.a. mrIL-1 developed more rapidly and was more severe in ankles previously injured by i.a. injection of group A streptococcal peptidoglycan-polysaccharide (PG-APS) fragments. In addition, a protracted pain response, as judged by severe limping, occurred 60 to 90 min after mrIL-1 injection into joints previously injured by PG-APS or 4 to 6 h after mrIL-1 injection into naive joints. The severity of arthritis was related to the mrIL-1 dose. Arthropathic activity of mrIL-1 alpha was neutralized by goat anti-mouse IL-1 alpha IgG, and the activity of both the alpha and beta preparations was heat labile. Repeated episodes of acute inflammation were induced by repeated i.a. injection of mrIL-1. In naive ankles this led to chronic synovitis without histologic evidence of erosions. However, in joints previously injured by PG-APS, repeated mrIL-1 injection induced a more severe chronic synovitis with a 50% incidence of early pannus formation and limited marginal erosions of cartilage and subchondral bone. Thus, mrIL-1 induces an acute exacerbation of arthritis in joints previously injured by PG-APS and repeated exposure of these joints to mrIL-1 promotes chronic erosive synovitis. These studies provide evidence for an in vivo function of IL-1 and are consistent with its role as one of the mediators in the local regulation of inflammation in recurrences of arthritis induced by bacterial cell wall polymers.\r"

After the addition of antibody MN41, neutrophils did not aggregate in response to a chemoattractant, FMLP. Blockade of preexisting surface gp165/95 by mAb MN41, followed by removal of the excess antibody from the mixture, was used to show that the molecules of gp165/95 newly expressed in response to stimulation by a chemoattractant were incapable of effectively mediating the induced cell-cell interactions of aggregation. Flow cytometry studies confirmed that binding of unlabeled antibody MN41 did not block further increases in surface expression of gp165/95 after stimulation with FMLP. These data suggest that molecules of gp165/95 exhibit two functionally distinct forms, one, present on the surface of freshly isolated neutrophils, that becomes competent to mediate the aggregation response upon activation by a stimulus and a second form that can be translocated to the cell surface by the stimulus but is greatly diminished if not lacking in the ability to participate in that aggregation event.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of Lps on the resistance of mice to gram-negative infection was compared in two genetically different backgrounds; C3H and C57BL. To mimic the natural sequence of pathogenetic events, infection was induced via a mucosal surface (intravesically), with Escherichia coli which remained at the mucosal site and Salmonella typhimurium which invaded to e.g., livers and spleens. Susceptibility was assessed as the bacterial persistence in kidneys, bladders, livers, and spleens at various times after infection. The initial clearance of both bacterial species from the mucosal site was significantly impaired in Lpsd mice both in the C3H and C57BL backgrounds. In the C57BL mice, additional unknown determinants conferred increased resistance to mucosal infection compared to the C3H mouse. For S. typhimurium, these resistance factors and alleles at the Lps locus dominated over Ity as determinants of resistance to mucosal infection. The Itys genotype conferred a significant increase in the susceptibility only to systemic infection, especially in the Lpsd, Itys mice. These results demonstrate an important difference between the genetic determinants of host resistance at mucosal and systemic sites, and emphasize the role of LPS induced host defense mechanisms for bacterial clearance from mucosal surfaces.\r"

S. pyogenes was chosen because it commonly causes natural infections and has well-characterized polysaccharide and protein Ag. In children over the age of 2 yr it was found that the maturation of antibody responses to the polysaccharide Ag of S. pyogenes (A-CHO) appeared to occur in parallel with, or even earlier, than the responses to streptococcal protein Ag. When antibodies to group A carbohydrate (A-CHO) were studied in detail, qualitative differences between the antibodies of children and adults were demonstrated. Although anti-A-CHO antibodies of adults were strikingly restricted to the IgG2 subclass, those of children were found in both the IgG1 and IgG2 subclasses. In addition, the clonal diversity of IgG antibodies to A-CHO increased with age, and additional clonotypes were detectable in convalescent sera of some subjects of all ages after infection. Two cases with major additional clonotypes after group A streptococcal infection were studied in detail. In these two cases the additional clonotypes belonged to a different IgG subclass than the previously dominant clonotypes, and the expression of the additional major clonotypes occurred in both IgG1 and IgG2 subclasses.\r"

Although skin is always exposed to external antigens, the role of local immune defenses involving sIgA in the skin has not been adequately studied. In order to evaluate the presence of sIgA in sweat, we have measured the concentration of sIgA in human sweat by enzyme immunoassay and have localized the components of sIgA in the sweat glands of human axillary skin. The concentration of sIgA in sweat was found to be 10 times higher in men than in women (13.0 +/- 0.9 micrograms/ml versus 1.6 +/- 0.9 micrograms/ml). Secretory component (SC) was localized immunohistochemically in protein synthetic organelles, such as the perinuclear spaces and Golgi complex, in cytoplasmic vesicles, and along the external surface membranes of mucous cells on the terminal segment of eccrine sweat glands. IgA and J chain were present in plasma cells in the protein synthetic organelles. The luminal aspects of eccrine sweat ducts also strongly express SC, as well as IgA and J chain. Neither SC, IgA, or J chain were identified in epithelial cells of apocrine sweat glands. These findings are consistent with the theory that J chain complexed with dimeric IgA is synthesized in plasma cells and is transported by SC-mediated endocytosis transfer across mucous cells of eccrine sweat glands and thus into sweat.\r"

Limiting dilution microculture was utilized in order to determine the precursor frequency of Con A-responsive Thy-1+ DEC in suspensions of AKR/J epidermal cells as well as whether these several functional activities all reside within a single Thy-1+ DEC precursor. Precursor frequency analysis of cultures established with limiting numbers of FACS-purified Thy-1+ DEC, irradiated syngeneic splenic filler cells and exogenous IL-2 indicated that approximately 20% of Thy-1+ DEC proliferated in response to Con A. Parallel microcultures in which purified Thy-1+ DEC were plated at a density of 0.5 cells/well were used to establish clones. Twenty clones were characterized phenotypically, and ten of these were also tested for their capacities to proliferate in response to Con A or IL-2, to secrete IL-2-like growth factors, and to exhibit cytotoxicity. All clones were Thy-1+ and L3T4-, but while most were also Lyt-2-, several contained 3%-18% dull Lyt-2+ cells. Functional studies revealed that each clone displayed all of the above functional activities, albeit with substantial quantitative variation. Clones with the highest cytotoxic activity had relatively low responsiveness to Con A or IL-2 and included all clones containing dull Lyt-2+ cells; conversely, clones with the highest proliferative responses had relatively low cytotoxic activity and were all Lyt-2-. This degree of functional and phenotypic heterogeneity among cloned Thy-1+ DEC may reflect their particular states of activation or differentiation; whether it reflects the biologically relevant in vivo activities of these cells must still be determined.\r"

  ".W": "Laminin, a glycoprotein of approximately 900,000 daltons, is a major component of the basement membrane that separates the epidermis from dermis in human skin. Previous studies have shown that keratinocytes and other epithelial cells synthesize laminin and utilize it for attachment to other extracellular matrices such as heparan sulfate proteoglycan and basement membrane collagen. The relationships between phenotypically normal mesenchymal cells and laminin have been much less emphasized in the literature. In this study, we have used antibodies that specifically label the A and B chains of laminin (but not fibronectin or other unrelated proteins) by Western blot analysis to immunoprecipitate biosynthetically derived laminin from [35S] methionine labeled cultures of neonatal and adult human skin fibroblasts. To be sure that the precipitated bands were laminin and not fibronectin, which has a molecular size very close to that of the laminin B chains, experiments were performed in which fibronectin was removed from the radiolabeled proteins by first immunoprecipitating with antifibronectin antibody and then sequentially immunoprecipitating laminin from the fibronectin-depleted supernates with antilaminin antibody. These experiments definitively demonstrate that human dermal fibroblasts synthesize and secrete laminin.\r"

The purpose of this study was to investigate the details of the biologic effects of Sr2+ on human keratinocyte growth, cell cycle, viability, and differentiation and to compare these effects with Sr2+ effects on cultured skin melanocytes. Cultured keratinocytes stimulated with 1.0-3.0 mM Sr2+ showed higher viability and almost a twofold increase in cell number compared with those grown in a standard calcium concentration. Time course studies revealed that 2.0 mM Sr2+ had no effects on growth of cultured melanocytes or fibroblasts. Sr2+ increased the percentage of cultured keratinocytes in G2/M phase, with a decrease in cells in G0/G1 phase. This effect of Sr2+ on the cell cycle was not seen in cultured melanocytes or fibroblasts. A 2 mM concentration of Sr2+ produced an increase in low-density keratinocytes separated by a Percoll gradient. In addition, increased expression of human fibronectin was observed in the cytoplasm and on cell membranes of keratinocytes cultured in Sr2+. Sr2+ can be of practical benefit in the culture of human keratinocytes in serum-free medium, increasing the viability and proliferative rate and producing a more uniform population of basaloid cells with increased expression of cell surface fibronectin.\r"

It behaves as a monofunctional agent with respect to DNA photoaddition. It does not photoinduce cross-links in DNA in vitro or in Chinese hamster cells in vivo. This behavior may explain the low photogenotoxicity in yeast and the lack of phototoxic erythemal response when treating vitiligo with khellin.\r"

  ".W": "In normal epidermis there is a balance between the rate of cell division and the rate of terminal differentiation. This can be perturbed by injuries such as wounding or tape-stripping, but is reestablished during recovery. The aim of the studies described in this report was to assess whether cultures of human keratinocytes could be used as an experimental model for investigating the mechanism by which epidermal homeostasis is established and maintained. The suprabasal layers were stripped from confluent keratinocyte cultures by incubation in low-calcium medium (0.1 mM calcium ions). After return to normal medium (2 mM calcium ions), the basal layer regenerated a stratified culture of approximately the same thickness as controls. The kinetics of proliferation and terminal differentiation were monitored by measuring the total number of cells and proportion of involucrin-positive cells at intervals before, during, and after stripping. During recovery the proportion of cells expressing involucrin, assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, rapidly returned to control levels, but the total number of cells per dish rose more slowly and often failed to reach control values. Thus, terminal differentiation was initially stimulated at the expense of proliferation. Our in vitro model of epidermal regeneration should provide a useful complement to intact skin and animal models for analyzing epidermal homeostasis.\r"

The latter antigen may represent a marker to monitor susceptibility of melanoma cells to modulation by IFN-gamma, because it is highly susceptible to induction by IFN-gamma. In primary melanomas 44%, 29%, 10%, and 55% of the lesions tested were evidently stained by anti HLA-DR, DQ, DP, and 96-K MAA monoclonal antibodies, respectively. A statistically significant association (P less than 0.01) was demonstrated between the degree of intratumoral lymphocytic infiltrate and the expression of HLA-DR and HLA-DQ antigens. In addition, a high degree of concordance in the reactivity pattern of individual lesions stained for HLA-DR antigens and for the 96-K MAA was found. In metastases 64%, 33%, 47%, and 100% of the lesions tested were evidently stained by anti HLA-DR, DQ, DP, and 96-K MAA monoclonal antibodies, respectively. This study indicates that HLA-DR and HLA-DP antigens are expressed in a higher percentage of metastatic than of primary melanomas and that there is no marked difference in the expression of HLA-DQ antigens between primary and metastatic melanomas. The data suggest that the regulatory mechanisms which control the expression of HLA-DR and DP antigens in primary and metastatic melanoma lesions are different. Locally produced IFN-gamma may play a role in the regulation of HLA Class II antigens in primary melanomas.\r"

Because neonatal human shigellosis is uncommon, we used the animal model for obtaining MVMs from rabbits of different ages to determine the presence of toxin receptors and Gb3 and to measure the fluid secretory response to toxin in ligated ileal loops. A single class of MVM receptors for 125I-labeled shigella toxin, first detected at 20 d of age, reached adult levels by 24 d (n = 1.7-23.8 X 10(10)/micrograms of protein; K = 1.1-3.8 X 10(9) M-1). Binding was specific for toxin subunit B. A toxin binding MVM glycolipid, identified as Gb3, was detected in animals greater than or equal to 16 d of age by high-performance thin-layer chromatography and autoradiography. Fluid secretion in response to shigella toxin in ligated small bowel loops occurred in temporal relation to the appearance of Gb3, a result thus indicating the involvement of Gb3 in mediating the toxin effects.\r"

Indigenous gram-negative enteric bacilli translocated in large numbers to the MLN, whereas gram-positive bacteria translocated at intermediate levels and obligately anaerobic bacteria at only very low levels. Our results suggest that enteric bacilli such as Escherichia coli, Proteus, and Enterobacter are associated with a higher incidence of bacteremia in debilitated patients, because these bacteria translocate more efficiently from the GI tract than do other bacteria, especially obligate anaerobes.\r"

Infected infants' serum IgM reactivity to treponemal antigens differed from that of control infants born to normal, serofast, and biologic false-positive mothers. Each of the infected infants' sera exhibited IgM reactions to the 47- and 37-kilodalton (kDa) proteins of T. pallidum. Although rheumatoid factor was detected in the sera of half of the infected infants, removing this factor did not alter the pattern of IgM blots. IgG reactions in infants were almost exclusively of the IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses and mirrored those of the mother, except for IgG1 and IgG3 reactions to the 83-kDa treponemal protein, which were unique to infants' sera. Our results suggest that the findings of IgM antibody directed against the 47- or 37-kDa antigens of T. pallidum may help to diagnose congenital syphilis at birth.\r"

  ".W": "In previous studies, we have demonstrated that tetanus toxin (TT) inhibits macrophage (MO) lysozyme secretion and that the inhibition of secretion was not directly linked to perturbation of cytosolic calcium homeostasis. Because MO secretion in response to phorbol myristate acetate, a stimulus that activates protein kinase C (PKC), was inhibited by TT, we examined whether TT might interfere with PKC activity. We report that MOs treated with TT have diminished PKC activity. Purified TT as well as commercial TT diminished PKC activity, whereas heated TT and supernatant from which TT had been removed had no effect on PKC activity. We further examined PKC activity in homogenates of brain and spinal cord from mice manifesting generalized tetanus. Spinal cord cytosolic PKC activity (pmol/mg of protein per min) was depressed in TT-intoxicated mice (87.3 +/- 25) compared with controls (182.6 +/- 47; P less than .02, n = 7). In contrast, cytosolic protein kinase A activity was similar in control- and TT-treated MOs and mice. These results provide the first evidence that PKC activity is diminished during TT intoxication.\r"
