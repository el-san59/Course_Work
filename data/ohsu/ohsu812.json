  ".W": "In 15 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and in 12 age- and sex-matched normal subjects, we evaluated inspiratory muscle strength and respiratory control system. Inspiratory muscle strength was assessed by measuring maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP). Respiratory drive was assessed by evaluating surface electromyographic activity of the diaphragm (EMGd) during both room-air breathing and hypercapnic rebreathing. Compared to the predicted value (mean +/- 1.65 SD), MIP was significantly reduced in nine patients (60%). All told, we noticed a significant inverse relationship in the patients between MIP and duration of steroid therapy (p less than 0.01). During room-air breathing, both EMGd and mouth occlusion pressure (P0.1), expressed both in actual values and as percentage of MIP, were significantly greater in patients than in the normal control group (p less than 0.001 for both). Both EMGd and P0.1 (%MIP) response slopes to CO2 were significantly greater in patients than in the normal control group (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.001, respectively) and significantly related to the functional stage of disease. During quiet breathing and for a PETCO2 of 60 mm Hg, both EMGd (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05, respectively) and P0.1 (%MIP) (p less than 0.01 and p = 0.001, respectively) were inversely related to MIP. These results indicate that RA patients may exhibit inspiratory muscle weakness and increased respiratory drive. Steroid myopathy and rheumatoid myositis could explain the reduction in MIP, whereas neural afferents arising from respiratory muscle, lung, or joint receptors could be involved in the observed increase in neural drive.\r"

  ".U": "90343134\r", 
  ".W": "Arousal from sleep in response to asphyxia can be a lifesaving event. However, the mechanisms responsible for this important arousal response are uncertain. A unifying hypothesis is that arousal results from the increased respiratory effort that occurs as a result of ventilatory stimulation. If this is true, the magnitude of this effort during the breaths immediately preceding arousal from sleep should be similar regardless of the stimulus. Therefore, the negative inspiratory pleural pressure during the breaths preceding arousal would be similar, whether stimulated by added inspiratory resistive load, hypoxia, or hypercapnia. To test this hypothesis, we studied eight young, healthy men during full-night sleep studies. We measured their electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), electrooculography (EOG), inspired ventilation (VI), end tidal PCO2 (PETCO2), O2 saturation, and esophageal pressure (esophageal balloon) while inducing arousal from non-REM sleep using (1) a 30-cm H2O/L/s added resistive load, (2) progressive hypoxia, and (3) progressive hyperoxic hypercapnia. All subjects were eventually aroused following the addition of the 30-cm H2O/L/s added load and during progressive hypercapnia. However, only six of the eight men were aroused when the O2 saturation was reduced to a minimum of 70%. For each stimulus, arousal occurred at very different levels of ventilation and arterial chemistry (SaO2 and CO2). However, ventilatory effort for each subject was similar at the point of arousal regardless of the stimulus. The peak-negative esophageal pressure for the single inspiration preceding arousal (for the six subjects arousing with all three stimuli) was 16.8 +/- 1.4 cm H2O for added resistive load, 15.0 +/- 2.4 cm H2O for hypoxia, and 14.7 +/- 2.1 cm H2O for hypercapnia. We conclude that increasing ventilatory effort may be the stimulus to arousal from sleep independent of the source of this rising drive to breathe.\r"

  ".W": "The ventilatory response to hypercapnic progressive hypoxia and the breathing pattern during steady-state hypercapnic hypoxia were compared before and after intravenous infusion of 3 mg of naloxone in a relatively large number of healthy adults (n = 21). In addition, the withdrawal response from hypercapnic hypoxia (modified transient O2 test) was measured to investigate the possible role of endogenous opioids in the peripheral chemoreceptors. The average ventilatory response (delta VE/delta SaO2) increased significantly from 0.51 +/- SD 0.26 to 0.65 +/- 0.42 L/min/% (p less than 0.05) after naloxone infusion, whereas there were no significant changes between two tests with normal saline in the control study (n = 7). Because there was considerable interindividual variation in the response to naloxone administration, we selected \"high responders\" (n = 8) who showed larger increases with naloxone than the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the change with the second saline in the control study. They showed greater delta VE/delta SaO2 (p less than 0.01), respiratory frequency (p less than 0.01), and mean inspiratory flow (p less than 0.01) during hypercapnic hypoxia before naloxone infusion than did the other subjects. There was no significant change in the withdrawal response before and after naloxone infusion, even in such high responders. We conclude that endogenous opioids participate in the control of breathing in normal adults during hypercapnic hypoxia. This may be particularly true for those subjects who exhibit greater chemosensitivity to hypercapnic hypoxia. Endogenous opioids appear to act centrally rather than peripherally.\r"

However, the high cardiac output of cirrhosis generally prevents or minimizes the appearance of a severe degree of arterial hypoxemia. Propranolol has been used to reduce cardiac output and portal pressure in these patients. We wondered whether it might alter arterial oxygenation and reduce O2 transport to tissues. We studied eight patients (three women) 54 +/- 3 (SEM) yr of age before and after intravenous propranolol (0.1 mg/kg followed by 2 mg/h). Cardiac output (QT) fell from 7.8 +/- 0.7 to 6.0 +/- 0.7 L/min (p less than 0.05), and portal pressure was reduced (22 +/- 2 to 19 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.01). Arterial PO2 did not change (88 +/- 4 to 89 +/- 5 mm Hg) because the fall in mixed venous PO2 (43 +/- 1 to 40 +/- 1 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) that followed the lower QT was counterbalanced by a lower intrapulmonary shunt (multiple inert gas technique) (4 +/- 2 to 2 +/- 1%, p less than 0.05) and a shift of the VA/Q distributions toward a higher VA/Q ratio. Paralleling the fall in QT, oxygen transport to tissues (QO2) was reduced (19 +/- 2 to 14 +/- 1 ml/min/kg, p less than 0.01). However, O2 uptake (VO2) remained constant (3.4 +/- 0.2 to 3.6 +/- 0.2 ml/min/kg) because O2 extraction by the tissues increased appropriately (22 +/- 2 to 28 +/- 1%, p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To clarify the effect of ventilation on the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), we examined the effect of reducing rate and tidal volume on oleic acid-induced low-pressure pulmonary edema in dogs, hypothesizing that hypopnea would reduce lung edema. We placed the experimental animals on venous-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for CO2 clearance and oxygenation 1 h after the injury. This allowed reduction of the ventilatory rate from 17.2 +/- 4.8 to 3.3 +/- 0.8 breaths/min and tidal volume from 20 to 16 ml/kg, effectively resting the injured lung. After 5 h of hypopnea there was no reduction in edema by gravimetric or extravascular thermal volume measurements. The ECMO-facilitated hypopnea reduced airway pressure and pulmonary artery pressure while improving arterial oxygen saturation but increased venous admixture. These results suggest that there may be a supportive role for ECMO-assisted hypopnea, but there was no direct beneficial effect of hypopnea on edema.\r"

These investigations were carried out routinely at 3 and 6 months and then annually after transplantation as well as on clinical suspicion of acute lung rejection or infection. A total of 61 transbronchial biopsies and concurrent lung function and chest radiographs were obtained. Of the biopsies, 30 (49.2%) showed histologic evidence of lung rejection, 12 (19.7%) demonstrated various opportunistic infections, and 19 (31.1%) were normal. Compared to during episodes of normal biopsies, FEV1 decreased significantly with lung rejection (p less than 0.001) and with infection (p less than 0.01). Vital capacity (VC) and DLCO also fell with these acute lung complications. Using histologic diagnosis as a standard, lung function testing had a sensitivity of 86% in detecting lung rejection in the first 3 months postoperation and 75% in the subsequent period. Its sensitivity for detecting lung infection was 75%. Although not distinguishing between these two complications, lung function had a specificity of 84% for detecting occurrence of an acute lung complication. Chest radiographs, although of similar sensitivity in the first 3 months postsurgery, had a sensitivity of only 19% for rejection in subsequent months and 58% for infection. Its specificity was 100%. Lung function testing changes in a predictable fashion with lung rejection and infection, offers an improvement over chest radiographs, and provides a quantitative measurement to aid the decision of when to undertake transbronchial lung biopsy.\r"

  ".U": "90343141\r", 
  ".W": "The causes for the development of right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) in emphysema are not fully understood. In the 1960s, studies of RVH in association with emphysema found no correlation between the extent of tissue damage in the lung and the RV weight. This was thought to disprove the theory that the RVH was due to an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance secondary to capillary destruction. In the present study, the development of RVH was investigated in tight-skin (tsk) mice with genetic emphysema. RVH started to develop in mature to senescent animals between 8 and 16 months of age and progressed thereafter. At 24 months of age, RV weight and the ratios RV/body weight and RV/LV + S weight were, respectively, 52, 96, and 60% greater than in control (pa) mice. At this time blood gas analysis revealed hypoxemia in tsk but not in pa mice. The mean linear intercept of tsk mice was 83% larger and the surface area of the walls of distal air spaces per unit lung volume was 40% smaller than in pa mice. There was a strong correlation between the severity of emphysema, assessed by both techniques, and the RV/LV + S ratio (p less than 0.001 for both). No muscularized arterioles were seen in the tsk mice, and the medial thickness of muscular arteries was almost identical in the two groups. This demonstrates that in emphysema, RVH can develop in the absence of pulmonary vascular changes and is probably due to tissue (and thus capillary) destruction.\r"

A randomized double-blind crossover design was used with 2-wk run-in and washout periods, when ipratropium bromide was substituted for inhaled beta-agonists. Dose response curves (DRC) to cumulative doubling doses of inhaled terbutaline (125 to 4,000 micrograms) were constructed after each treatment period, and baseline spirometry, finger tremor (Tr), plasma potassium (K), plasma cAMP, and ECG (HR and T wave) were measured at each dose step of the DRC. Daily PEFR measurements (A.M. and P.M.) and Holter ECG were performed during run-in and treatment periods. Baseline values for FEV1 were not significantly different during run-in, treatment, or washout periods. There were dose-related increases in FEV1 (p less than 0.0001) with no significant differences between DRC after treatment with HDT compared with those with LDT: delta FEV1 max, 0.46 +/- 0.14 L, 15.5 +/- 3.7% predicted (HDT); 0.50 +/- 0.11 L, 16.0 +/- 3.1% predicted (LDT).

Acid aerosols had mass median aerodynamic diameters near 0.5 microns with geometric standard deviations near 1.9. Temperature was 21 degrees C, and relative humidity was near 50%. Subjects were exposed with unencumbered oronasal breathing for 30 min at rest plus 10 min at moderate exercise (ventilation rate approximately 20 L/min/m2 of body surface). A subgroup (21 subjects) were exposed similarly to clean air and to \"high\" acid (134 +/- 20 micrograms/m3) with 100% oral breathing. Increased symptoms and bronchoconstriction were found after exercise under all exposure conditions. For the group, symptom and lung function responses were not statistically different during control and during acid exposures with unencumbered breathing or with oral breathing. By contrast, other investigators have reported statistically significant lung function disturbances in groups of young asthmatics exposed similarly with oral breathing. A minority of our subjects showed possibly meaningful excess bronchoconstriction with \"high\" acid exposure relative to control with both routes of breathing. This could be the result of chance, or it could suggest the existence of an acid-sensitive subpopulation of young asthmatics.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine whether non-EIB-producing exercise with the legs or arms could produce refractoriness to a standard treadmill challenge. Eight asthmatic subjects with EIB completed three sessions consisting of two exercise challenges separated by a 30-min rest. In all sessions, the second challenge was done on a treadmill while breathing dry air. Conditions for Challenge 1 were the following: Session A = treadmill, dry air; Session B = treadmill, humid air; Session C = arm cranking, humid air. All three conditions produced a significant degree of refractoriness. There was a tendency for the percent protection index to be greater for Session A; however, no significant differences were found among the three sessions. Therefore, it can be concluded that although both exercise and bronchoconstriction may play a role in producing the refractory period, neither severe bronchoconstriction nor intense exercise with the same muscle groups are required to produce refractoriness.\r"

Of the 14 infants evaluated at 6 months, 7 had elevated histamine levels along with histories of recurrent wheezing after AB.

High performance liquid chromatography showed that most of the IL-1 beta was associated with a molecular weight peak of 17 to 18 kD. Pulmonary inflammation reflected by the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) in the sample correlated significantly with the IL-1 concentration.\r"

  ".W": "The frequency of community-acquired pneumonia coupled with its mortality rate of 10 to 25% is of growing concern to clinicians. A prospective study of 67 patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia was carried out to determine the causative agents, the impact fore-knowledge of the etiology has on the outcome, the value of clinical and radiologic criteria in predicting the evolution, and the efficacy of empirical therapy. The study group included 45 men and 22 women (mean age: 56.8 +/- 16.6 yr), and 46.2% suffered from a concurrent debilitating disease. The cause of pneumonia was diagnosed in 32 cases, and the most common pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (37.5%), Legionella pneumophila (21.8%), and gram-negative bacilli (25.0%). The fact that fungal infections were present in three patients and Pneumocystis carinii in one are worthy of note. The overall death rate was 20.8%. A fatal outcome was related to the age of the patient (p less than 0.05), the presence of debilitating disease (p = 0.026), and septic shock (p = 0.0009). Diagnosis of the causative agents did not aid in increasing the survival rate, but it did allow for better patient management. Most of the patients (85.1%) initiated on treatment with erythromycin plus tobramycin recovered, but only 68.4% of the subjects commenced on treatment with other therapeutics survived. Furthermore, it was necessary to modify the therapy of a greater percentage of the latter group (p less than 0.025). Gram-negative bacillary pneumonia was a frequent finding among the patients who did not recover, making empirical treatment with erythromycin plus third generation cephalosporins most advisable for severe cases of community-acquired pneumonia.\r"

  ".W": "The inhibitory effects of the specific platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonist WEB 2086 on the in vivo PAF- and antigen-induced respiratory, circulatory, and hematologic alterations in the rabbit were investigated. WEB 2086 (600 micrograms/kg) given 5 min before challenge with 0.6 micrograms/kg of PAF completely inhibited the PAF-induced bronchoconstriction, period of rapid, shallow breathing, bradycardia, increase in right ventricular pressure, and hypotension. The PAF-induced thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and basopenia were also prevented by WEB 2086 pretreatment. In contrast, the inhibitory effects of WEB 2086 on IgE anaphylaxis were much more limited. No significant inhibition of the responses in tidal volume, breathing frequency, hypotension, or bradycardia was observed in sensitized rabbits pretreated with 1 or 6 mg/kg of WEB 2086. However, WEB 2086 significantly inhibited the increase in total pulmonary resistance. Although the peak changes in dynamic lung compliance and right ventricular pressure were not or were only slightly inhibited by WEB 2086, a more rapid recovery to baseline was observed in rabbits receiving the PAF antagonist. No significant inhibition of the thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and basopenia accompanying antigen challenge was observed in WEB 2086-pretreated rabbits. Pretreatment with the PAF antagonist prevented anaphylactic lethality. Thus, PAF appears to play a role in the lethality and the maximum increase in total pulmonary resistance of IgE systemic anaphylaxis but does not appear to be a major mediator of the other physiologic alterations, including systemic hypotension.\r"

  ".W": "We used cultured rabbit tracheal epithelium to determine the effect of mammalian-derived tachykinin on airway ciliary activity and its modulation by neutral endopeptidase EC 3.4.24.11 (NEP). Neurokinin A (NKA) caused dose-dependent increases in ciliary beat frequency (CBF), as measured by a photoelectric method, with the maximal increase from the baseline 15.7 +/- 1.7% (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.01), whereas substance P (SP) had no effect. The NKA-induced increase in CBF was not inhibited by phentolamine, propranolol, or atropine, but it was abolished by the tachykinin antagonist [D-Pro2, D-Trp7,9]SP. Pretreatment of tissue with thiorphan (10(-5) M), a NEP inhibitor, had little effect on CBF responses to NKA; however, it significantly potentiated the responses to SP (14.9 +/- 3.0%, p less than 0.01). Other peptidase inhibitors, including captopril, bestatin, and leupeptin, did not alter the tachykinin-induced CBF response, suggesting that angiotensin converting enzyme, aminopeptidases, and serine proteinases do not modulate ciliary activity in response to tachykinins. These results suggest that NKA increases CBF by acting directly on tachykinin receptors and that NEP may play a role in modulating the tachykinin-induced stimulatory effects on CBF.\r"

GAGPS, used as a paradigmatic sulfated polysaccharide, was a potent inhibitor of elastolysis in vitro. GAGPS given intratracheally prevented acute injury and emphysema in hamsters when administered up to 8 h before HLE insufflation. The results suggest that sulfated polysaccharides may be potent inhibitors of HLE-mediated lung injury.\r"

The TLC of animals with HMD was only one-third that of healthy premature monkeys over the first 3 h of life (p less than 0.01). At 3.5 h, lung tissue was rapidly frozen in situ during lung inflation to TLC. Samples of frozen lung tissue were freeze dried, embedded, sectioned, and examined by point counting. Animals with HMD had alveolar saccules filled with the residue of proteinaceous fluid, but little alveolar collapse was noted. The proportion of points falling on empty alveolar spaces was 74% in the healthy animals but only 18% in animals with HMD (p less than 0.01); there was a 70-fold increase in the residue present in alveoli of animals with HMD (p less than 0.05). In a separate experiment, rapid serial measurements of TLC by N2-washout showed that healthy premature monkeys, but not those with HMD, have a steady increase in TLC during the first few minutes of life, presumably due to clearance of lung liquid. Although the initial cause of reduced TLC in HMD appears to be inadequate clearance of fetal lung liquid, by 3 h of age proteinaceous alveolar edema is primarily responsible.\r"

  ".U": "90343157\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of percutaneous transcatheter embolization on pulmonary function and exercise capacity were assessed in 15 patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVM). Vital capacity (VC), FEV1, DLCO, SaO2, exercise performance, and right-to-left shunt (100% oxygen method) were measured before and 2 to 6 months after treatment. Surgical correction had been attempted in 9 patients prior to referral, and 11 had associated hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Lung function tests before intervention showed normal VC and FEV1/VC ratios, reduced DLCO (mean 71% predicted, range 36 to 123%), a resting supine SaO2 of 86% (range 67 to 95%) and mean shunt fraction of 33% (range 15 to 47%). Despite further marked falls in SaO2 on exertion, exercise capacity was well preserved. Following steel coil embolization of all PAVM with a feed vessel internal diameter greater than 3 mm (one to four sessions per patient), mean shunt fraction improved from 33 to 19% and resting SaO2 from 86 to 92% with no change in VC. A consistent improvement in diffusing capacity was seen only in patients with coexisting HHT. Exercise capacity increased in the majority (unchanged in 6), and SaO2 during maximal exercise improved in all except one patient. There were no long-term complications following embolization. These findings indicate that embolization of all macroscopic PAVM, undertaken primarily to reduce the risk of paradoxical embolization, is safe and results in substantial improvements in resting and exercise SaO2 without evidence of loss of normal lung. The right-to-left shunts remaining following embolization may reflect the presence of numerous microscopic PAVM in these patients.\r"

The arteries were enlarged due to eosinophilic infiltration in the vessel walls, and the adjacent lymphatics were dilated. This observation suggests that HRCT scans may be of value in the evaluation of pulmonary vasculitis because these findings are distinct from those of other diffuse lung lesions.\r"

Two patients had prolonged inflammatory pulmonary injury associated with fever, hypoxemia, hemoptysis, respiratory failure, and diffuse alveolar infiltrates. Lung tissue specimens from both patients revealed diffuse alveolar damage, alveolar hemorrhage, and interstitial and intraalveolar inflammatory cell infiltration notable for the prominence of eosinophils. Immunofluorescent staining performed on one of the biopsy specimens showed a striking deposition of IgE in both lymphocytes and alveolar macrophages. Both patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids and rapidly improved. In contrast, two patients presented acutely with diffuse pulmonary alveolar infiltrates associated with dyspnea and hypoxemia, but without fever, and within 36 h of discontinuing cocaine their pulmonary infiltrates and symptoms had spontaneously resolved. Our report further supports the finding that an acute pulmonary syndrome can occur after inhalation of freebase cocaine. Furthermore, the lung injury may respond to systemic corticosteroid therapy when it is associated with a prominent inflammatory cell infiltration.\r"

DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, crossover design. SETTING: Exercise laboratory with an environmentally controlled exposure. PATIENTS: Forty-one nonsmokers with documented coronary artery disease. INTERVENTION: On day 1, a training session with no exposure, the baseline carboxyhemoglobin level was measured, and a supine bicycle exercise test was done. On days 2 to 4, patients were exposed to room air, 100 ppm carbon monoxide (target, 4% carboxyhemoglobin) or 200 ppm carbon monoxide (target, 6% carboxyhemoglobin), and they then did supine bicycle exercise with radionuclide ventriculography. Ambulatory electrocardiogram recordings were made during the 4 consecutive days to determine the frequency of ventricular premature depolarization (VPD) at various intervals. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The frequency of single VPD/h was significantly greater on the 6% carboxyhemoglobin day than on the room air day during the exercise period (167.72 +/- 37.99 for 6% carboxyhemoglobin compared with 127.32 +/- 28.22 for room air, P = 0.03). During exercise, the frequency of multiple VPD/h was greater on the 6% carboxyhemoglobin day compared with room air (9.59 +/- 3.70 on the 6% carboxyhemoglobin compared with 3.18 +/- 1.67 on room air, P = 0.02). Patients who developed increased single VPD during exercise on the 6% carboxyhemoglobin day were significantly older than those who had no increased arrhythmia, whereas patients who developed complex arrhythmias were also older and, in addition, exercised longer and had a higher peak workload during exercise. CONCLUSION: The number and complexity of ventricular arrhythmias increases significantly during exercise after carbon monoxide exposure producing 6% carboxyhemoglobin compared with room air but not after exposure producing 4% carboxyhemoglobin.\r"

DESIGN: Evaluation of a large cohort of patients with systemic sclerosis and renal crisis who were followed prospectively. SETTING: University scleroderma center. PATIENTS: One hundred and eight patients who had scleroderma renal crisis between 1972 and 1987. INTERVENTION: ACE inhibitors. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Therapy with ACE inhibitors has dramatically improved the survival of patients with scleroderma renal crisis (1-year survival, 15% without and 76% with ACE inhibitors; P less than 0.001). However, 24 (44%) of 55 patients with scleroderma renal crisis who were treated with ACE inhibitors died early or required permanent dialysis. Older age, male sex, an initial serum creatinine level of more than 270 mumol/L, inadequately controlled blood pressure, and congestive heart failure were associated with these poor outcomes, but only older age and congestive heart failure were significant in a multivariate logistic regression analysis. Eleven of twenty patients (55%) who survived dialysis more than 3 months and continued to receive therapy with ACE inhibitors were able to discontinue dialysis after 3 to 15 months compared with 0 of 15 dialysis patients who did not receive ACE-inhibitor therapy (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with systemic sclerosis who develop hypertension should be treated with an ACE inhibitor. Improved survival and successful discontinuation of dialysis are possible when ACE inhibitors are used to treat scleroderma renal crisis.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of combination drug therapy for disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). DESIGN: Prospective, nonrandomized, before-after comparison. SETTING: Outpatient clinics at three university medical centers. PATIENTS: Seventeen patients with at least two consecutive blood cultures positive for M. avium complex who had not been previously treated with antituberculous medications. Fifteen of the seventeen patients completed at least 4 weeks of treatment. INTERVENTION: Patients received daily intravenous amikacin (7.5 mg/kg body weight) for the first 4 weeks plus the following oral medications for at least 12 weeks: ciprofloxacin, 750 mg twice daily; ethambutol, 1000 mg daily; and rifampin, 600 mg daily. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The baseline geometric mean colony count from blood cultures decreased from 537/mL to 14/mL (P less than 0.001) after 4 weeks of therapy. The microbiologic suppression was sustained while on treatment and was associated with a decrease in systemic symptoms related to M. avium complex infection. Premature withdrawal from treatment (less than 12 weeks) occurred in 7 of 17 patients. The commonest reasons for early withdrawal were gastrointestinal intolerance and hepatic toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Mycobacterial load and systemic symptoms in patients with AIDS and disseminated M. avium complex infection can be effectively reduced by a regimen containing amikacin, ethambutol, rifampin, and ciprofloxacin.\r"

  ".W": "Four women with multicentric angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia had a distinct clinical syndrome characterized by peripheral neuropathy, pseudotumor cerebri, IgA dysproteinemia, and thrombocytosis. The nodes displayed typical morphologic changes of the plasma cell variant of multicentric angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia. The pathologic changes are morphologically distinct from angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy with dysproteinemia although clinical similarities do exist. In these four cases, the lymphadenopathy was usually bulky and multicentric. There was frequent splenic involvement. The neuropathies were severe and disabling. Clinical courses have been variable with some responses to therapy with steroids and alkylating agents. No neoplastic transformations have occurred. Multicentric angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia may represent a reactive lesion in which the antigenic stimulus is unknown but results in follicular hyperplasia, angiogenesis, and the systemic manifestations of hyperimmune stimulation. We believe this clinical syndrome may represent a distinct variant of multicentric angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia, and it requires close observation for neoplastic transformation and other complications of its multisystem nature.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective survey using identity-unlinked consecutive sampling during a 6-week period in 1988. SETTING: Inner-city teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Sequential sample of 2544 adult patients with sufficient excess sera for analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-eight (1.1%) (95% CI, 0.7% to 1.5%) serum samples were seropositive for HTLV I-II whereas 152 (6.0%) (CI, 5.1% to 6.9%) were seropositive for HIV-1. The age distribution of HTLV I-II was similar to the study population while HIV-1 was concentrated among younger (25 to 44 years) age groups (P less than 0.05). Only 16 (57.1%) HTLV I-II infected patients had identified risk factors; 11 were intravenous drug users, 4 received transfusions, and 1 had heterosexual exposure to a high-risk partner. None of 39 identified homosexual men had HTLV I-II antibodies although 29 (74.3%) were HIV-1 seropositive. CONCLUSION: HTLV I-II infection may be more prevalent among certain segments of the U.S. population than previously realized and appears to have a different demographic distribution than HIV-1 infection. Although HTLV I-II may represent a nosocomial risk to health care providers, the risk of occupational transmission is probably less than for hepatitis B virus and even HIV-1. Adherence to universal precautions should minimize the risk.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-six cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome from 1981 to 1986 were retrospectively reviewed to determine the scope of clinical presentation and the unique complications of the illness. The diagnosis was confirmed by detection of Hantaan virus antibody in 25 cases and by characteristic autopsy findings in 1 case. The illness could be classified into three distinct clinical subgroups. Fever was universally present. Two patients presented with intractable shock and diffuse hemorrhage and died within 6 days from multi-organ system failure, mimicking the clinical picture of overwhelming sepsis. Eighteen patients presented with acute renal failure with an illness lasting a mean of 21 days (range, 10 to 36 days). Resolution of thrombocytopenia heralded recovery of renal function. At discharge, the serum creatinine level was normal in 13 patients; 5 patients had evidence of minimal renal dysfunction. Acute pulmonary edema requiring hemodialysis and retroperitoneal hemorrhage were the major complications in this subgroup. Six patients had an undifferentiated febrile illness with normal renal function. Fever, thrombocytopenia, abnormal urinalysis, hypertransaminasemia, and a benign clinical course characterized the third clinical pattern. The recent availability of serodiagnostic methods to detect Hantavirus group antibody facilitates the diagnosis of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. Application of this test in the described clinical settings will identify unsuspected cases, broaden the knowledge of the geographic distribution of Hantavirus infection, and increase physician awareness of its protean manifestations.\r"

DESIGN: Mailed survey. PARTICIPANTS: A random sample of 700 members of the American College of Physicians who were identified as practicing nephrologists; 516 (74%) responded. RESULTS: Acute peritoneal dialysis, acute hemodialysis, continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration, and percutaneous renal biopsy were done by 95%, 97%, 87%, and 91% of the respondents, respectively. Except for hemofiltration, procedures were learned by most respondents during fellowship training. Compared with general internists, fewer nephrologists did most of the 19 general procedures included in the survey. The number of nephrology procedures done during the past year varied considerably among respondents, as did the minimum number of procedures they recommended for achieving and maintaining competence. Neither the variation in number of procedures done nor recommendations regarding certification were explained by differences in practice characteristics. Median recommendations remained relatively constant among subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly all nephrologists do the four nephrology procedures included in the survey. Their opinions about the training needed for competence help to better define requirements for training programs. More attention should be focused on training and certifying practicing nephrologists in procedures learned after formal fellowship training.\r"

The only cause of failure was recurrence in the neck and distant metastasis in 15% of patients. Comparisons were made of effectiveness of treatment with regard to local and neck failure, voices retained, frequency of retreatment, and determinate survival to the alternate treatment programs. No differences were found in regard to survival with any of the contemporary programs. There are differences in terms of retreatment frequency, voice preservation, and cause of failure between programs. Conservation surgery is preserving voices today. Combined therapy seems of little value in the early cancers.\r"

The location of the needle as well as the effect of injection is monitored by means of a fiberscope connected to a television camera and screen. The preoperative and postoperative vocal function was multidimensionally evaluated with the use of a test battery consisting of the maximum phonation time (MPT), mean airflow rate (MFRc), fundamental frequency (F0) range and sound pressure level (SPL) range of phonation, pitch perturbation quotient (PPQ), amplitude perturbation quotient (APQ), and normalized noise energy (NNEa). In the majority of the patients, MPT, F0 range, and SPL range increased and MFRc, PPQ, APQ, and NNEa decreased postoperatively. In the overall evaluation based on the test values of these parameters, the result was excellent for 16 procedures, good for 16, fair for 7, and poor for 5. The most frequent cause of failure was an insufficient amount injected.\r"

The mortality rate was 1.2% (five deaths); while major, nonfatal medical complications occurred in 6.3% (24 of 384 patients)--seven strokes, three myocardial infarctions, two pulmonary emboli, and 12 respiratory failures requiring mechanical ventilation. Elderly patients did not experience more frequent or more severe medical complications, and the overall pattern of complications was different from that of other surgical specialties. Only specific cardiovascular and pulmonary risk factors were associated with these complications. We conclude that medical complications are a significant cause of morbidity in total laryngectomy; a focused preanesthetic risk factor analysis by a medical team familiar with head and neck cancer patients assures prompt identification and management of these complications.\r"

The children took part in a prospective study from birth to the age of 3 years. The antibody response to the rubella vaccine was significantly lower in the children with rAOM. The responses to tetanus and to diphtheria did not differ between children with and without rAOM. Thus, the results indicate that in addition to the known lack of antibodies against pneumococcal polysaccharide antigens, a lower antibody response against at least one protein antigen may exist in otitis-prone children.\r"

The keratinizing squamous epithelial cells of the TM appeared hypertrophic, whereas hyperplasia, characterizing a nontreated healing TM perforation, was less prominent. The connective tissue layer of the CORT-treated TM was invaded by abundant inflammatory cells, mainly polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Also, when applied to an intact TM, CORT caused hypertrophy of the epidermal cells and an inflammatory reaction within the TM.\r"

  ".W": "The in vivo effect of histamine on mucociliary activity in the rabbit maxillary sinus was investigated by injecting histamine into the maxillary artery and recording the responses with a photoelectric technique. Histamine stimulated the mucociliary activity dose-dependently in the dose range 10 to 1,000 micrograms/kg. The maximum response was 31.6% +/- 3.7% at a dose of 50 micrograms/kg. The histamine-induced stimulation of the mucociliary activity was characterized by a short latency with a peak response within 1 to 2 minutes and a slow decline lasting about 5 minutes. The response displayed tachyphylaxis. Cholinergic blockade with atropine did not affect the response to histamine. Blockade of H1 receptors with pyrilamine abolished the response to histamine, whereas blockade of H2 receptors with cimetidine was without effect. The H2 agonist dimaprit failed to stimulate the mucociliary activity. It is concluded that histamine stimulates the mucociliary activity in the rabbit maxillary sinus via H1 receptors.\r"

In this study, 65 basal cell carcinomas were treated in one of two dosing schedules with intralesional sustained release interferon alfa-2b (10 million IU per injection). Thirty-three patients received a single injection and 32 patients received one injection per week for 3 weeks. At study week 16, 80% of evaluable tumors treated with three injections and 52% treated with one injection were cured histologically. Two patients discontinued injections because of side effects. A sustained-release protamine zinc preparation of interferon alfa-2b shows promise as a practical, effective, and cosmetically elegant treatment for basal cell carcinoma.\r"

Complications were as follows: profuse eruption, 6; hemorrhagic eruption, 1; hepatitis, 5; and pulmonary involvement, 1; 1 patient developed an intravascular disseminated coagulation and died of varicella. Three patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, having a history of varicella, presented with an atypical form of varicella with a small number of disseminated cutaneous poxlike lesions; 1 of these patients experienced three relapses of atypical varicella. Assay of serum antibodies to varicella zoster virus showed that, while typical varicella was the primary varicella zoster virus infection, atypical varicella was a reactivation of varicella zoster virus infection. Acyclovir was given to 11 patients and vidarabine to 1 patient. The one patient who died and the one who suffered a relapse had received acyclovir. Thus, varicella in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus may be complicated and even lethal. Atypical forms of varicella could be, as is the case with herpes zoster, a reactivation of endogenous varicella zoster virus.\r"

We used a sib pair analysis comparing the HLA haplotypes in affected siblings of these families. Haplotype sharing was analyzed in 15 sib pairs; expected frequencies of haplotype sharing were estimated as 25% for HLA identity and 50% for haplotype identity. All sib pairs shared at least one haplotype and 13 of the 15 were HLA identical, compared with the expected frequency of four. These results suggest that at least one, and probably more, HLA-linked genes are implicated in the development of psoriasis.\r"

In patients with diabetes mellitus, balanitis occurred with a prevalence of 34.8% in the uncircumcised population, compared with 0% in the circumcised population. Balanitis did occur with increased frequency in the diabetic population (16%), regardless of circumcision status, compared with the nondiabetic population (5.8%). Of 63 circumcisions performed at our institution between 1987 and 1989, 28.6% were for the treatment of balanitis; 44.4%, for phimosis (which was probably induced by chronic balanitis); 19% in preparation for placement of penile prostheses; and 8% for miscellaneous reasons. No complications of circumcision were reported. In this group of patients, balanitis was more frequent in diabetic than in nondiabetic uncircumcised men (50% vs 15.4%).\r"

The development of acyclovir-resistant varicella-zoster virus during therapy was suspected clinically in the first patient and documented in vitro in the second patient. The inability to mount an effective cell-mediated immune response contributed to the prolonged course of cutaneous zoster in our patients. The hyperkeratotic nature of the skin lesions may reflect their chronic nature. Treatment with inadequate doses of acyclovir, allowing viral persistence and the selection of resistant strains of virus, may also be implicated. We recommend prolonged high-dose intravenous acyclovir therapy in the initial management of herpes zoster in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\r"

Histologically, all patients showed distinctive changes of spongiotic inflammation of the nail matrix. The cause and pathogenesis of these changes are still unknown. We suggest the concept that they represent a subgroup of endogenous eczema with a predilection for the nail matrix. A second, and less likely, hypothesis is that these lesions represent an autoimmunologic response to the nail matrix.\r"

However, a combination of mechanical and microbiological factors may be involved, with follicular occlusion leading to yeast overgrowth and folliculitis. Scanning electron microscopy was used to investigate this hypothesis. Skin biopsy specimens obtained from patients with Pityrosporum folliculitis were examined by scanning electron microscopy before and after oral ketoconazole therapy. Patients with active disease showed occlusion of noninflamed follicles, which resolved after ketoconazole treatment. Follicular occlusion was not present in biopsy specimens obtained from unaffected controls nor was it related to the presence of P orbiculare. These findings suggest that follicular occlusion may be a primary event in the development of this folliculitis, with yeast overgrowth a secondary occurrence. The beneficial effect of ketoconazole in this disease may be due to direct effects on the follicle.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1958 and 1977, 170 children aged 10 years or less underwent total repair of tetralogy of Fallot at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. Follow-up data were obtained on 128 (90%) of the 143 who survived the operation at 10 to 28 years postoperatively (mean follow-up, 18 years). All patients completed an extensive questionnaire, and 59 returned for a thorough evaluation consisting of a history and physical examination, electrocardiogram, 24-hour Holter monitoring, exercise stress testing, pulmonary function testing, and two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography. Late survival was excellent with only two of four known late deaths due to cardiac-related causes and with all 59 patients in New York Heart Association class I or II. None had cyanosis or clubbing. Normal sinus rhythm was present in 90%. One patient had complete heart block, and 75% had right bundle-branch block on the electrocardiogram. Right ventricular function was normal by echocardiography in 78%. Residual mild to moderate pulmonary stenosis was noted by Doppler study in 8 patients. Pulmonary regurgitation was present in 78%, but in only 11 patients was it graded as moderate and in none was it severe. Stress testing documented the excellent functional status of most patients, with 92% of predicted exercise time and 94% of maximum heart rate being attained. In the few who had impaired cardiac performance, this correlated best with moderate pulmonary regurgitation. Although the overall late functional status of patients undergoing repair in the first decade of life was very good, these patients need continued follow-up to assess the severity of pulmonary regurgitation and the need of possible intervention.\r"

Forty patients underwent this treatment between May 1982 and September 1989. The patients ranged in age from 10 months to 78 years. Of the 20 patients who underwent treatment of pneumothorax, 9 had cystic fibrosis, 7 had severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 2 had spontaneous pneumothoraces, and 2 had postoperative parenchymal bronchopleural fistulas. Nineteen patients (95%) had successful treatment. Of the 20 patients who underwent treatment of chronic effusions, 14 had malignant etiologies, 3 had chylothoraces, and 3 had other miscellaneous effusions. Eighteen patients (90%) in this group had successful treatment. There were two hospital deaths related to the underlying disease processes after the pleural space problems were successfully treated. This study suggests that proper selection of patients and full exploitation of the capabilities of thoracoscopy and talc poudrage will result in effective treatment with low morbidity and mortality.\r"

Four patients had subvalvar stenosis complicating double-outlet right ventricle. There were 33 male and 12 female patients. Mean age at operation was 7.1 +/- 4.3 years (range, 6 months to 21 years). Local resection of the fibrous membrane was performed in 26 patients. Local resection was combined with myectomy in 18 patients. Aortoventriculoplasty (modified Konno procedure) was required at operation in 3 patients. There were three perioperative deaths at initial operation and two deaths at the time of reoperation. Follow-up ranges from 1 month to 17 years (average follow-up, 47.0 months). Reoperation for recurrent obstruction has been required in 12 patients (27%), and 3 patients have required a second reoperation. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation was present in 17 patients. Subaortic stenosis is a spectrum of anatomical derangements ranging from a discrete fibrous membrane to a long, tortuous fibrous tunnel with aortic annulus hypoplasia. Successful removal of a discrete fibrous membrane can be followed later by recurrent stenosis necessitating myectomy or aortoventriculoplasty. Correction of subvalvar aortic stenosis can be followed by recurrent stenosis necessitating reoperation as long as 17 years after the initial procedure.\r"

  ".W": "Extended preservation of the heart-lung block for 12 hours in a bovine model of heart-lung transplantation was achieved using donor core cooling, static hypothermic storage, and reperfusion on cardiopulmonary bypass with leukocyte-depleted (LD) blood. Orthotopic heart-lung transplantation was performed with (n = 4, LD group) or without (n = 4, control group) LD blood during cardiopulmonary bypass. Postoperative measurements of cardiopulmonary function were made at 2, 4, and 6 hours after reperfusion. Only 2 animals (50%) of the control group survived more than 2 hours, whereas all animals in the LD group survived the study period. Arterial oxygen tension on 100% oxygen was 535.63 +/- 64.96 mm Hg and 146.45 +/- 90.9 mm Hg in the LD and control groups, respectively, at 2 hours (p less than 0.5) and 524.3 +/- 73.32 and 147.9 +/- 255.67 mm Hg at 6 hours. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure-to-systemic pressure ratio was 0.49 +/- 0.08 and 0.62 +/- 0.35 at 2 and 6 hours in the LD group. Extravascular lung water was 17.81 +/- 0.02 mL/kg (control group) and 11.28 +/- 9.15 mL/kg (LD group) at 2 hours. At reperfusion, the mean neutrophil count was 27 +/- 27 and 764 +/- 635 x 10(9)/L in the LD and control groups, respectively. This novel approach of leukocyte depletion during reperfusion after heart-lung preservation resulted in excellent cardiac and pulmonary protection.\r"

  ".W": "Recognition that many patients with benign sclerosing mediastinitis have smoldering disease responsible for failure of surgical procedures or for development of collateral circulation in patients with superior vena caval obstruction has markedly improved management of these difficult patients. Histoplasmosis complement fixation titers have been used to detect unsuspected subacute disease and to follow the therapeutic adjunctive management with ketoconazole, an oral antifungal agent. Twenty-two patients with benign sclerosing mediastinitis demonstrated a variety of symptoms relating to the area of compression: superior vena cava, 13; esophagus, 3; pulmonary artery and pericardium, 3; and trachea, 3. Histoplasmosis was documented in 12 patients. Operation is used initially for diagnosis, to rule out carcinoma, and to treat the complications: superior vena caval reconstruction, 6; tracheal decompression, 2; right middle lobectomy, 1; esophageal decompression, 2; division of tracheoesophageal fistula, 1; and release of pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade, 1. Postcardiotomy syndrome occurred in 1 patient and wound infection in another. No deaths resulted. In 6 cases of histoplasmosis, symptoms recurred in 100% of patients and were successfully managed with ketoconazole treatment, and then clinical progress was monitored with serial histoplasmosis complement fixation studies. One patient had four superior vena caval reconstructions at an outside hospital, each 1 year apart, with symptoms recurring each time. With ketoconazole therapy alone, she has been asymptomatic for more than 2 years. Vigorous search for a fungal cause may even obviate the necessity for surgical intervention. If an operation is necessary, preoperative and postoperative use of ketoconazole has assured success.\r"

Thus, on occasion, we have liberalized our donor criteria to meet the demand. We have recently transplanted 16 potentially infected donor hearts into critically ill recipients. Of these 16 donors, 7 had multiple positive blood cultures as follows: Streptococcus pneumoniae (3), Staphylococcus aureus (2), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), and Enterobacter sp (1). Seven other donors were accepted despite high fevers (rectal temperature greater than 38.9 degrees C), leukocytosis (greater than 18 x 10(9)/L [greater than 18,000 cells/microL]), and pulmonary infiltrates with positive sputa (Enterobacter [3], Klebsiella pneumoniae [2], and Staphylococcus [2]). Two other donors with hepatitis B surface antigen positivity were deemed at high risk but were used because the recipients were in immediate need. Early mortality (less than or equal to 30 days) among the recipients was 3/16 (18.7%) with 1 patient dying of uncontrolled allograft rejection, 1 of hepatic failure, and 1 of Pseudomonas septicemia. Late mortality (greater than 30 days after operation) occurred in 6 patients: 2 patients died of hepatic failure, 3 died of graft atherosclerosis, and 1 died of iatrogenic hemorrhage after a liver biopsy. Only 1 patient died of infection unrelated to that of the donor, and the other patients had no infectious complications resulting from the organisms identified in their respective donors. Use of potentially infected donor hearts resulted in surprisingly few infectious complications in this group of recipients. This practice can be safe and should be considered when other options are unavailable.\r"

  ".W": "From 1981 to 1989, 60 patients more than 80 years of age were referred for operation for severe calcific aortic stenosis. All patients were symptomatic: 13 in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II, 28 in class III, and 19 in class IV. The preoperative mean cardiothoracic ratio was 0.58 +/- 0.09; the mean valve area, 0.52 +/- 0.14 cm2; and the mean aortic valve gradient, 62 +/- 18 mm Hg. Left ventricular function was impaired in 30 patients (ejection fraction less than 0.40). Coronary arteriography was performed in 10 patients. Aortic replacement used bioprosthesis in all 60 patients associated with aortocoronary bypass (in 5) and mitral valve replacement (in 1). One-month mortality rate was 28% (17 patients) due to cardiac failure (in 9), pulmonary complications (in 6), and neurological complications (in 2). Early mortality was not correlated with preoperative angina, cardiothoracic ratio, associated operation, and cross-clamping time. It was not obviously correlated with preoperative functional class but correlated positively with urgent operations and with left ventricular function (40% mortality in patients with ejection fraction less than 0.40 versus 16% mortality in others). Hospital morbidity was 68%. Mean hospitalization was 15 +/- 7 days. There were four late deaths. Thirty-nine patients are long-term survivors (3 months to 7 years): 27 in class I, 10 in class II, and 2 in class III due to primary valve failure. The actuarial survival probability is 65% at 1 year and 61% at 5 years. In summary, the good long-term quality of life justifies the high postoperative risk in octogenarians. Early operation before cardiac function impairment improves the results.\r"

Ten baboons were subjected to 90-minute cardiopulmonary bypass conducted at 28 degrees C. Hemodynamic measurements were made before and after the bypass procedure, and biopsies for high-energy phosphate determinations were performed at different time intervals during and after bypass. The results showed improved maintenance of myocardial contractility (measured with the regional end-systolic pressure-length relationship) with the oxygenated crystalloid solution. Expressed as a percentage of values before bypass, contractility after bypass averaged 81.69% +/- 4.81% and 80.47% +/- 10.05%, respectively, after 10 and 20 minutes using the oxygenated crystalloid cardioplegia. For blood cardioplegia, the corresponding values were 71.9% +/- 8.73% and 64.99% +/- 8.60% (mean +/- standard error of the mean). The 10- and 20-minute postbypass values between the two groups differed significantly (t test, Welch modification: p = 0.0464 and p = 0.0342). Myocardial adenosine triphosphate level was higher immediately after induction of cardiac arrest when blood cardioplegia was used (blood cardioplegia, 6.82 mol.g wet wt-1; crystalloid cardioplegia, 4.95 mol.g wet wt-1; p = 0.0314), but values subsequently equalized.\r"

To assess myocardial injury during ischemia, hemodynamic measurements were conducted at weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass and a postoperative assay of creatine kinase isoenzyme MB was performed. In 22 infants with retrograde coronary sinus perfusion, the initial cardioplegic infusion was performed through the aortic root and additional infusion was repeated every 30 minutes by retrograde coronary sinus perfusion. The other 11 infants received additional solution by antegrade selective coronary artery perfusion. The aortic cross-clamp time in the retrograde coronary sinus perfusion group was significantly shorter than that in the antegrade selective coronary perfusion group (128 +/- 19 versus 143 +/- 21 minutes, p less than 0.05). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of postoperative hemodynamic variables and enzyme indexes. Eight neonates in the retrograde coronary sinus perfusion group also exhibited enzymatic and hemodynamic indexes similar to those of older infants. These results suggested that retroperfusion of cardioplegic solution was a safe and useful means of myocardial protection in infants and neonates because of the simplification of the operative procedure and the avoidance of traumatic injury to the coronary ostia.\r"

There were no instances of early or late death. Neuromuscular function improved, and clinical myasthenic symptoms stabilized in almost all patients except 2 patients in stage III and 1 patient in stage IVa, who had an exacerbation of the myasthenic symptoms associated with recurrence of thymoma. All the recurrent tumors were on the pleura and could be resected. The suspected cause of recurrence is either dissemination of tumor cells as a result of operative manipulation or undetected disseminated foci that existed at the time of the first operation. The resections of the recurrent invasive thymomas localized on the pleura were easily performed and improved the myasthenic symptoms.\r"

These factors were observed and recorded in 50 coronary bypass operations and 17 valve replacements. There was a high risk of glove penetrations (one to two per team member per operation) and of skin punctures, lacerations, or eye splashes (from 0.4 to 1.5 instances per operation).

  ".W": "The effects of stimulating the right atrial ventral ganglionated plexus on ventricular performance during atrial tachycardia was studied in 8 lightly sedated (pentobarbital, 2.5 mg/kg intravenously) dogs with sterile pericarditis. Atrial arrhythmias were induced by electrical stimulation (10 V, 4 ms, 100 Hz) of the right atrium through previously inserted temporary bipolar pacemaker wires. Various types of supraventricular tachycardias were produced. Atrial fibrillation was produced in 3 dogs, atrial tachycardia in all 8 dogs, different atrioventricular nodal ectopic rhythms in 6 dogs, and atrial flutter in 1 dog. These arrhythmias were associated with irregular ventricular contractions that resulted in low ventricular pressures during many cardiac cycles such that low or no aortic pressure was generated. Right atrial ventral ganglionated plexus stimulation induced slowing of ventricular rate so that every ventricular contraction resulted in aortic pressure generation, thus increasing mean aortic pressure. Responses elicited by atrial ganglionated plexus stimulation were eliminated after atropine administration. We conclude that electrical stimulation of the right atrial ventral ganglionated plexus results in slowing of ventricular contractile rate during supraventricular tachycardia, presumably by activating efferent vagal neuronal elements, thereby improving ventricular performance. If applicable in humans, this technique may be of use in management of postoperative atrial arrhythmias after cardiac operations.\r"

Between 1975 and 1983 at Parkland Memorial Hospital, the complication of systemic arterial air embolism developed in 9 patients with penetrating lung injury (six gunshots and three stabbings). Eight patients were either in profound shock or experienced cardiac arrest and all were intubated and on positive-pressure ventilation, frequently on a manual resuscitator bag before or at the time of diagnosis. The diagnosis was made by direct visualization of air in the coronary vessels in all 9 patients, and in 3 air was also aspirated from the left ventricular apex and aortic root. In addition, 5 patients had clinically significant hemoptysis. At operation, only an isolated injury to the lung was found in 7 of the 9 patients. Arterial air embolism is a highly lethal complication; 6 of our patients died, a mortality rate of 66%. Thus, it clearly behooves us to be more alert to the possible occurrence of this complication among all victims of penetrating chest trauma. We must accept that systemic arterial air embolism is an established complication of penetrating lung injury and must recognize that it occurs much more frequently than has been previously reported. Prompt diagnosis coupled with aggressive efforts at cardiopulmonary resuscitation is crucial for successful management of patients with air embolism.\r"

Therefore, the effect of 0, 0.6, 1.2, 1.8, and 2.4 mmol/L calcium in modified St. Thomas cardioplegia was evaluated in isolated working hearts of 7- to 10-day-old rabbits. Functional recovery was determined by comparing aortic flow, developed pressure, and first derivative of left ventricular pressure (dP/dt) before and after 1 hour of normothermic (37 degrees C) ischemia. As percentages of baseline values, recovery of developed pressure and dP/dt averaged 10% +/- 1% (mean +/- standard error of the mean) and 10% +/- 1% with 0 mmol/L, 46% +/- 7% and 44% +/- 8% with 0.6 mmol/L, 79% +/- 2% and 76% +/- 2% with 1.2 mmol/L, 67% +/- 2% and 61% +/- 5% with 1.8 mmol/L, and 65% +/- 5% and 65% +/- 7% with 2.4 mmol/L calcium, respectively. Significant improvement in recovery of developed pressure and dP/dt was detected when the calcium concentration was increased from 0 to 0.6 mmol/L and from 0.6 to 1.2 mmol/L, but the groups with 1.2, 1.8, and 2.4 mmol/L did not differ from one another significantly in terms of developed pressure and dP/dt recovery. There was no recovery of aortic flow when 0 mmol/L calcium was used; at calcium concentrations of 0.6, 1.2, 1.8, and 2.4 mmol/L, recovery of aortic flow averaged 16% +/- 7%, 63% +/- 10%, 23% +/- 10%, and 36% +/- 11% of baseline values, respectively. Recovery of aortic flow with 1.2 mmol/L calcium was significantly higher than at concentrations of 0.6 and 1.8 mmol/L.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary function testing was conducted consecutively in 29 healthy men (age range, 42 to 71 years) undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting. Lung volumes, expiratory flow rates, diffusing capacity, and blood gases were determined before operation, at discharge (8.7 +/- 1.9 days), and at 3 months postoperatively. In addition, peak expiratory flow rate was measured immediately after extubation (21.4 +/- 2.7 hours). Fifteen patients had smoked within the past year, but none had a history of pulmonary impairment. Twenty-two patients had internal mammary artery (IMA) dissection. Operation and recovery were uneventful in all cases. After extubation, peak expiratory flow rate was decreased by 65%. At discharge, lung volumes were decreased by 19% to 33% below preoperative values and expiratory flow rates were decreased by 33% to 37% below preoperative values. Some minor changes were detected at 3 months. Further analysis of these changes according to smoking history, age, preoperative weight, dissection of IMA, and aortic cross-clamp time showed that only IMA dissection affected the postextubation changes in peak expiratory flow rate (p less than 0.0001), whereas the decreases in functional residual capacity and expiratory reserve volume at discharge were affected by IMA dissection (p less than 0.05) and age (p = 0.01). Thus, median sternotomy is associated with severe but short-term pulmonary dysfunction; IMA dissection has a significant adverse effect on these changes.\r"

  ".W": "Between March 1986 and September 1988, 38 patients underwent extended aortic resection (aortic valve, ascending aorta, and arch) for acute type-A aortic dissection with aortic valve insufficiency; deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest were used. All patients were operated on within 17 hours of the onset of symptoms. In the first 24 patients, operation was performed by the \"inclusion technique.\" In the last 14 patients, the \"excision technique\" was used: the ascending aorta and arch was excised, and the aorta was transected at the beginning of the descending thoracic tract. Excision and transection were considered essential to prevent back flow from the false lumen, which is the main source of bleeding, and to allow all anastomoses to be constructed beyond the limits of dissection. The only anastomosis to the dissected aorta was at the distal end of the graft. One of the 14 patients died (7.1%). One patient was reopened for bleeding: blood was issuing from the attachment of the carotid trunks, and the defect was repaired by interposing a bifurcated Dacron graft between the arch graft and the carotid arteries. Extended aortic excision meets the principle of either eliminating as far as possible the diseased aorta or controlling intraoperative and postoperative bleeding. An operation of great magnitude can be considered a life-saving procedure when compared with the high risk of acute type-A aortic dissection.\r"

At 10 weeks after operation, animals were anesthetized and instrumented for study. No changes in baseline pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, cardiac output, or pulmonary vascular resistance were observed. With diversion of the entire cardiac output to the left lung or lobe, however, the group with reimplanted lobes had a significantly higher pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance than the other groups. This may result from chronic denervation of the pulmonary vasculature and receptor upregulation.\r"

Results showed an adequate consistency of prosthesis, adequate tolerance without producing tracheal stenoses, and impermeability to air, allowing a correct invasion by granulation tissue. This process was faster than any found in any other porous tracheal implant so far tested. We proved that epithelialization results from capillary invasion through the prosthetic pores and from growth from both tracheal ends. We conclude that this prosthetic material can be useful in repairing tracheal defects and may be the optimal tracheal graft for humans.\r"

  ".W": "More physicians are assuming salaried positions within large health care organizations. In this report, we discuss the influence of such organizational changes on physician behavior in one large health care system--the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) system--which employs more than 14,000 physicians. Conflicting pressures on these physicians in VA facilities affiliated with academic medical centers include differences between professional and organizational needs plus differences between the roles of the VA hospital and of the affiliate academic medical center. An analysis of these issues, based on organizational theory, suggests that these clashes are consequences of fundamental differences between the parties involved. Because the outcome of the conflicts may be fatal to the organizations, they must be managed, not ignored. This involves recognizing the existence and the nature of the differences as well as actively sharing the responsibilities and the issues usually charged to one of the two conflicting groups to form a conjoint organization between the \"two sides of the street.\"\r"

To determine whether such random samples represent an individual's true lipoprotein status, we measured fasting total serum cholesterol and lipoproteins, on a weekly basis for 4 weeks, in 20 subjects ages 22 to 63 years. Duplicate samples were tested by two standardized laboratories, each on five consecutive days. Variations of more than +/- 20% in the serum levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were seen in 75%, 95%, and 65% of the subjects, respectively. On retesting, 40% of the subjects moved in or out of one \"risk category\"; and in 10% two categories, from \"desirable\" to \"high risk,\" or vice versa. These data demonstrate that random testing may fall to detect wide fluctuations in the levels of serum lipoproteins, and therefore result in erroneous risk assignment or therapeutic intervention.\r"

  ".W": "The National Cholesterol Education Program has recently published guidelines for the assessment of cardiovascular risk and goals for laboratory accuracy. To test the impact of biologic and analytic variability on the ability of a single lipid measurement to assess risk accurately, lipids were measured on three occasions in 51 volunteers. Notable day-to-day variability of total cholesterol (5%), triglyceride (20%), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (10%), and calculated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (8%) levels was found. Analytic variability contributed significantly to total variability of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and calculated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Confidence intervals constructed around National Cholesterol Education Program cutoff points suggested that classification was reliable from a single measurement if total cholesterol value was below 4.78 (less than 185 mg/dL), between 5.56 and 5.81 (215 and 225 mg/dL), or above 6.59 mmol/L (greater than 225 mg/dL). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol value classification from a single measurement was only accurate at below 3.00 (greater than 116 mg/dL) or above 4.50 mmol/L (greater than 174 mg/dL). This study documents significant day-to-day variability of serum lipids and suggests that patients near the National Cholesterol Education Program cutoff points may require repeated measurements to assign risk accurately.\r"

We looked for the presence of GER and reflux injury in a series of 20 patients with lower esophageal ring and dysphagia, using a 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring and upper endoscopy with biopsy. Abnormal GER was documented in 13 of the patients (65%), 10 of whom had erosive reflux changes in the distal esophagus. Seven patients (35%) showed no evidence of pathologic GER or reflux esophagitis. All patients also underwent esophageal manometry. Nonspecific esophageal body motor dysfunction may have contributed to dysphagia in five patients, two of whom had no evidence of abnormal GER. We conclude that GER disease is a frequent cause of the gradually progressive ring stricturing and dysphagia seen in patients with lower esophageal ring. Antireflux therapy, as an adjunct to esophageal dilatation, may be appropriate for many symptomatic lower esophageal ring patients.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether chronic inflammatory arthritis may respond to antibiotic therapy (implying a bacterial origin), we conducted a placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Sixty patients with inflammatory arthritis and antibody titers to Borrelia burgdorferi 1:64 or more were randomized to receive placebo (n = 20) or 2 g/d of ceftriaxone intravenously (n = 40) for 2 weeks. Two of 20 placebo- and 19 of 40 antibiotic-treated patients improved. At 1 month, the placebo-treated patients could elect to receive ceftriaxone. Altogether, 58 patients were treated with ceftriaxone and followed up for 13 to 24 months. Improvement was noted in 27 of the 58 antibiotic-treated patients. Patients with a wide diversity of inflammatory arthritis were studied. Response to ceftriaxone was seen in all groups, including 5 of 12 with rheumatoid arthritis, 5 of 8 with psoriatic arthritis, 3 of 5 with vasculitis, and 14 of 33 with less well-differentiated chronic inflammatory arthritis. In 16 of the 27 who responded to the antibiotic, the arthritis worsened 6 to 18 months after the initial response to ceftriaxone. Previous improvement of arthritis after oral antibiotic was a better predictor of response to ceftriaxone than either duration of disease or Lyme antibody titer. Side effects to ceftriaxone were frequent and included diarrhea (29/60) and acute allergic reactions (9/58). We conclude that some patients may have an occult bacterial infection underlying their chronic inflammatory arthritis, and may respond to antibiotic therapy. The response to ceftriaxone in patients with even weakly reactive Lyme titers encourages further prospective placebo-controlled studies of antibiotics in various subsets of chronic arthritis.\r"

Each symptom was present in at least 10% of patients, with the most prevalent symptoms being fatigue (33%) and back pain (32%). Patients were clustered into three groups: (1) 140 were asymptomatic or monosymptomatic, (2) 135 reported 2 or 3 symptoms, and (3) 135 had 4 or more symptoms. The majority (77%) of these symptoms had been previously reported to a physician. Whereas 80% of patients with pain syndromes and gastrointestinal complaints had obtained some therapeutic benefit, only 39% of the individuals with fatigue, dyspnea, dizziness, insomnia, sexual dysfunction, depression, and anxiety reported any relief. Better therapy is needed for these common outpatient complaints.\r"

Weight reduction was achieved by behavior modification, medication, or their combination and was associated with significant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The weight reduction method was less important than the amount of weight lost in determining reductions in blood pressure. The greatest reductions in weight and blood pressure occurred during the first half of weight loss, suggesting that even brief treatment (ie, 8 to 10 weeks) may benefit obese, hypertensive patients. Despite repeated measurements, 36 patients who failed to lose weight showed no decrease in blood pressure. Although blood pressure rose during follow-up in patients who regained weight, it remained below baseline levels. These findings provide further support for weight reduction in the control of hypertension.\r"

No generally accepted criteria currently exist to assess the decision-making capacity of these elders. In this study, three hypothetical clinical vignettes were developed to assess treatment decision-making capacity in 25 presumably competent, medically ill, nondistressed, hospitalized elders and 25 healthy, age- and education-matched controls. The patients' understanding of the vignettes was evaluated and compared with their understanding of a standard consent form; with their performance on a mini-mental state examination; and with physician judgements about their decisional capacity. Vignette results indicate a significant difference between study and control groups in understanding of key treatment issues. Healthy controls demonstrated a better understanding of these issues. Twenty-eight percent of the patients had significant decisional impairments by vignette assessment but were not identified by mental status scores or physician judgments. Results suggest that presumably competent, medically ill elders may be at risk for developing decisional impairments during hospitalization for acute illness. Obtaining informed consent directly from many of these patients may not be feasible.\r"

In two of these cases, status seizures were stopped by intravenous pyridoxine administration, but the patients remained comatose for prolonged periods. The comas were immediately reversed by the administration of additional pyridoxine. In the third case, the patient's lethargy was treated by intravenous pyridoxine on presentation and was followed by immediate awakening. Pyridoxine is effective in treating not only isoniazid-induced seizures, but also the mental status changes associated with this overdose.

At initial examination, 18 eyes (40%) showed vitreous separation from the fovea, and 10 (22%) developed vitreous separation during follow-up. None of these 28 eyes progressed to a fully developed macular hole during follow-up. Moreover, the macular disease was apparently improved in 23 (82%) of these eyes. However, of the remaining 27 eyes without vitreous separation from the fovea, 10 eyes (37%) progressed to a fully developed macular hole. We speculate that early-stage macular hole could be reversed by spontaneous vitreous separation from the fovea, and this chance may be greater than the risk of true macular hole formation.\r"

Compared with placebo, PGF2 alpha-IE reduced the intraocular pressure of these timolol-treated eyes significantly. The absolute difference in mean change between PGF2 alpha-IE and placebo groups was 4.5 mm Hg with a 95% confidence interval of 3.1 to 6.6 mm Hg, corresponding to a mean reduction of initial intraocular pressure of 17.4% in eyes treated with PGF2 alpha-IE. Conjunctival or episcleral hyperemia was seen in all eyes treated with PGF2 alpha-IE for up to 4 hours but not in eyes treated with timolol and placebo, and aqueous flare was not observed in any eye. Thirteen of 15 patients treated with PGF2 alpha-IE, compared with only 3 of 15 who received placebo, reported mild to moderate subjective discomfort in the treated eye in the form of a foreign-body sensation that lasted for up to 2 hours. These results demonstrate that PGF2 alpha-IE, in a dose that has previously been shown to reduce intraocular pressure in normotensive volunteers or in patients with glaucoma who are taking no other medications, also significantly reduces the intraocular pressure of patients with glaucoma whose pressures are not adequately controlled on a twice-daily regimen of timolol.\r"

The proportion of peripheral retinal nonperfusion was derived from fluorescein angiographic frames covering 180 degrees of the temporal periphery. The extent of peripheral retinal capillary nonperfusion was greater in patients with peripheral retinal neovascularization compared with those without neovascularization. Reductions in electroretinogram a- and b-wave amplitudes were found in patients with and without neovascularization. However, such reductions were of greater frequency and magnitude in patients with neovascularization. Electroretinogram abnormalities were restricted to reductions in amplitude; implicit times were generally normal. In terms of the variables of the b-wave luminance-response function, abnormalities were restricted to reductions in the amplitude variable Rmax; values of logK and n were generally within the normal range. Across all patients, there was a significant negative correlation between electroretinogram amplitude measures and capillary nonperfusion, indicating that the electroretinogram provides information about the functional consequences of peripheral capillary nonperfusion in sickle cell retinopathy.\r"

Dermal hyperpigmentation in the combined distribution of the ophthalmic and maxillary divisions of the trigeminal nerve and hyperpigmentation of the nasal or buccal mucosa were closely associated with ocular involvement.

Associated ocular findings included elevated intraocular pressure with or without glaucoma (10.3%), uveitis (2.6%), cataract (1%), asymmetric cupping of the optic nerve head unassociated with glaucoma (9.8%), and orbital melanoma (0.5%). The most serious complication of oculodermal melanocytosis is malignant transformation, while glaucoma appears to be the more common one. Patients with oculodermal melanocytosis and ocular hyperpigmentation should be followed up at regular intervals for the development of either of these complications.\r"

Epidemiological evaluation revealed the toxic endothelial cell destruction syndrome to be linked with the 10-fold increase of a detergent solution in the ultrasonic bath for cleaning the surgical instruments.\r"

There were substantial and statistically significant intraocular pressure rises in the sulcus-fixated group starting at 1 and 2 hours after YAG capsulotomy, and peaking at 3 hours (mean rise, 7.83 mm Hg). There were no such peaks of intraocular pressure rise among bag-fixated cases (mean change, -0.32 mm Hg at 3 hours). There was a weak but significant (r = -.18) correlation between the change 1 hour after YAG capsulotomy in intraocular pressure and percent of enclosure of the intraocular lens optic among bag-fixated cases. Higher proportions (fourfold to fivefold) of cases with sulcus-fixated lenses had significant flare and particulate matter in the anterior chamber, compared with bag-fixated cases.\r"

Histologic examination of the mass revealed a pigmented spindle-cell neoplasm. On electron microscopy, the presence of premelanosomes and the absence of basal lamina supported the diagnosis of melanoma. Malignant transformation of a preexisting nevus is postulated since perineural foci of benign dendritic melanocytes were seen within the melanoma. There has been no recurrence or metastasis in a 2-year follow-up. Of 30 primary orbital melanomas reviewed, 12 (40%) were associated with periorbital pigmentary disorders, such as oculodermal melanocytosis, blue nevus, and ocular melanocytosis. Our case is unique since the pigmentary lesions were limited to the orbital tissues.\r"

Ocular retinoblastoma and central nervous system tumors are observed in a line of mice formed by the transgenic expression of SV40 T-antigen. An oncogenic protein known to bind to the retinoblastoma gene product (p105-Rb) is specifically expressed within retinal cells in this model. All animals that carry this genetic alteration develop multifocal retinal tumors. Midbrain tumors are observed in 15% of ocular tumor-bearing animals, and these arise ventral to the cerebral aqueduct at the level of the pineal gland. Both ocular and central nervous system neoplasms are heritable in heterozygous offspring through 10 sequential generations of breeding. Retinal tumors display the gross appearance, invasive properties, light and electron microscopic features, and immunohistochemical staining characteristics of human retinoblastoma. The light and electron microscopic characteristics as well as immunocytochemical features of undifferentiated midline central nervous system neoplasms further correlate with human trilateral retinoblastoma. We postulate an alternative mechanism of retinoblastoma tumorigenesis that involves functional inactivation of retinoblastoma protein locally in the face of an intact retinoblastoma gene locus.\r"

In rabbits treated and followed up for 6 weeks there was a decrease in intraocular pressure during the observation period (P less than .05, paired Student's t test). The gross and light microscopic examination revealed focal atrophy and fibrosis of the ciliary processes, with pigment-laden macrophages on the ciliary processes and in the outflow pathways. Higher energy levels caused lens capsule damage and vitritis.

Exposure of proliferating human retinal pigment epithelial cells to the immunotoxin (0.1 to 10,000 ng/mL) caused a statistically significant (P less than .0001) decrease in the number of cells. This inhibitory effect was induced after an exposure to the immunotoxin as short as 5 minutes and was maximal after 24 hours of exposure. The diminution in cell number was dose dependent over the range from 0.1 to 100 ng/mL. Monoclonal antibody alone, recombinant ricin A chain alone, or an irrelevant immunotoxin, MOP21C monoclonal antibody-recombinant ricin A, did not diminish the number of cells. There was a marked decrease in DNA synthesis measured by nuclear tritiated thymidine incorporation that accompanied the immunotoxin-mediated decrease in cell number. Viable cells remaining after exposure to the immunotoxin (0.1 to 10,000 ng/mL) were morphologically abnormal; typically the cells had elongated spindle-shaped processes and had lost their normal cuboidal appearance. In contrast, cell number was not decreased in confluent human retinal pigment epithelial cells after treatment with maximal doses of immunotoxin. Morphologic changes similar to those seen in proliferating cells were observed in confluent cells exposed to more than 100 ng/mL of immunotoxin. The effect of the immunotoxin was species specific because large doses of immunotoxin did not reduce the number of viable cells in proliferating or confluent pig retinal pigment epithelial cells or cause observable morphologic changes in this cell type. Our results indicate that the immunotoxin selectively inhibited proliferating retinal pigment epithelial cells by receptor-mediated internalization of the antitransferrin receptor monoclonal antibody-recombinant ricin A chain conjugate.\r"

The procedure, which we term endonasal laser dacryocystorhinostomy, is described. Cadaver specimens were examined postoperatively. Laser rhinostomies were found to involve the posteroinferior portion of the lacrimal sac fossa. Tissues surrounding the fistula site showed no signs of damage. We report on the first patient to undergo endonasal laser dacryocystorhinostomy for the treatment of nasolacrimal duct obstruction, with 10 months of follow-up. We believe endonasal laser dacryocystorhinostomy offers the following advantages over standard external dacryocystorhinostomy: (1) Tissue injury is limited to the discrete fistula site. (2) The cutaneous scar and cosmetic blemish of an external dissection are eliminated. (3) Excellent hemostasis is maintained. (4) Minimal operative and postoperative morbidity permits outpatient surgery, with faster resumption of normal daily activities and increased cost-effectiveness. (5) Patients prefer endonasal laser dacryocystorhinostomy to external dacryocystorhinostomy.\r"

To estimate the predictive validity of the National Medical Examination (NME), an investigation of the postgraduate competence of a sample of the participating examinees was conducted in 1984. The sample consisted of 1,717 of the 4,995 graduates from 13 medical colleges who had taken the initial NME. Their scores on the NME and the ratings given them by directors of postgraduate programs in nine aspects of clinical competence were compared by frequency distribution and product-moment correlation coefficients. Scores on the NME were consistent with measures of postgraduate clinical competence and, as a whole, correlated significantly with the ratings of clinical competence, supporting the use of the score on the NME as a predictor of postgraduate clinical competence. However, the extent of the relationship between the NME score and postgraduate clinical competence varied according to the specialty program of postgraduate medical training.\r"

Approximately 100 Canadian graduates took the examination each year; by 1988 the number of osteopathic graduates taking it was 102, double the number participating in 1984. Nearly all the Canadian graduates attended university or university-affiliated residencies, whereas half of the osteopathic graduates attended non-university-affiliated programs. For their overall clinical competence and for the eight components of clinical competence, the Canadian graduates were rated highest, followed by the U.S., osteopathic, and foreign graduates. The Canadians' average examination scores were also highest. The authors discuss the relatively low level of performance of the osteopathic graduates, but conclude that these graduates appear to be an untapped source of talented physicians for internal medicine residencies. The limitations of studying self-selected groups of candidates are also discussed.\r"

However, at PSU a research project is a curriculum requirement for students who did not do medical research prior to entering medical school. Questionnaires were sent to all graduates from the classes of 1980, 1981, and 1982. A total of 567 graduates completed the questionnaires, an overall response rate of approximately 76%. Medical school research experience was reported by 83% (183) of the PSU graduates, 34% (52) of the UCONN graduates, and 28% (54) of the UMASS graduates. When compared on a school-by-school basis, the graduates from the three schools did not differ with respect to residency specialty training, fellowship training, academic appointments, career practice choices, or postgraduate research involvement. However, when all the graduates studied were examined as a single group, medical school research experience was found to be strongly associated with postgraduate research involvement.\r"

Sodium was measured by ion specific electrode and dopamine by HPLC with electrochemical detection (using epinine as an internal standard). In several groups salt loading studies were also carried out. The five ethnic groups differed substantially with regard to the correlation between their urinary sodium and dopamine outputs. Three groups (whites, Thais and Zimbabweans) showed a strong positive correlation (P less than .001) and this may reflect their traditionally salt rich diet. In two groups (Ghanaians and Iranians) there was no correlation and this may reflect a salt scarce environment. Taken together with our previously reported studies showing that normotensive Ghanaians do not mobilize dopamine on salt loading, this would suggest that certain ethnic groups are predisposed to develop hypertension on salt loading--that is, they are 'salt sensitive.' This genetic trait may have passed from the West Coast of Africa, with the slaves, to America and the Caribbean. Other workers have reported deficiencies in vasodilator systems in the American black, such as dopamine, kallikrein and the renal prostaglandins. These defects may lead to the nosologic entity of 'low renin' hypertension, well described in American blacks, and could open up avenues of therapy based either on DA1 activators (such as fenoldopam) or on renal prodrugs (such as gludopa).\r"

  ".W": "Sodium loading reduces aldosterone responses to angiotensin II (AII) when compared to the sodium restricted state. Recent investigations suggest that dopamine inhibits the aldosterone secretion and may contribute to the alteration in aldosterone response to AII with sodium intake, since administration of the dopamine antagonist, metoclopramide, enhances the aldosterone responses to AII on a high but not a low salt diet. Nonmodulating hypertension is characterized, in part, by a decreased aldosterone response to AII, raising the possibility that an increased dopaminergic inhibition of aldosterone secretion underlies the adrenal defect in nonmodulating hypertension. To assess this possibility, 69 patients with hypertension were characterized in relationship to their modulation status on a low sodium intake. Dopamine levels were significantly higher (P less than .05) in nonmodulators. To assess the physiologic relevance of these findings, the aldosterone response to AII infusion was assessed before and during administration of the dopamine antagonist, metoclopramide, in 13 patients. The adrenal response to AII did not change after metoclopramide in either hypertensive subgroup. Thus, it is unlikely that the adrenal defect is due to the increase in dopamine levels observed in nonmodulators. In the next study, the impact of dietary sodium intake on urinary dopamine levels was compared in normotensive and hypertensive subjects characterized as modulators and nonmodulators. Both modulators and normotensive subjects demonstrated an increase in urinary dopamine excretion in response to a high sodium intake--a feature that was not observed in the nonmodulators. Thus, the sodium retaining tendency of nonmodulators may reflect, at least in part, a reduction in intrarenal dopamine production in response to a sodium load.\r"

  ".W": "In order to investigate whether dopamine receptors are involved in the acute natriuretic effects of calcium channel blockade, experiments were carried out in humans with uncomplicated essential hypertension. In 8 hypertensives 5 mg intravenous nicardipine produced a large decrease in blood pressure and renal vascular resistance, a slight but significant increase in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and marked natriuresis. When a second identical experiment was performed in the same subjects with the addition of 10 mg metoclopramide as dopamine blocker, changes in sodium excretion and vascular resistance were the same, but GFR did not increase during nicardipine. In a second set of experiments (n = 5) the same design was used, but nicardipine was infused at a dose of 0.01 mg/kg, ie, seven times less than in previous experiments. Under these conditions, blood pressure, renal vascular resistance and GFR did not change, but significant natriuresis occurred. Natriuresis was almost completely prevented by metoclopramide. In 5 additional hypertensives, metoclopramide alone was infused and 0.01 mg/kg nicardipine was added to the infusion. No change in any parameter was observed. Our findings suggest that the dopaminergic system participates in maintaining or increasing GFR during blood pressure reduction by calcium antagonists, although renal vasodilation and natriuresis are largely independent of dopamine receptor activity. In addition, when low doses of calcium antagonists produce natriuresis in the absence of renal or systemic hemodynamic changes (direct tubular effect), dopamine blockade is able to blunt this effect. This indicates a modulation by dopaminergic receptors of the direct tubular action of calcium antagonists.\r"

The specific binding was about 50% of total. To investigate whether DA2 binding sites found on pheochromocytoma cells might modulate catecholamine (CA) release, we studied the effects of oral bromocriptine (2.5 mg) on circulating CA of 5 patients with pheochromocytoma. In these patients bromocriptine caused a decrease in blood pressure (P less than .05) but no significant change in plasma CA. Our study shows the presence of DA2 binding sites on tumoral chromaffin tissue. As bromocriptine, a DA2 receptor agonist, was not able to modify tumor CA secretion, the functional role, if any, played by these binding sites on tumor secretion is still to be clarified.\r"

We also performed experiments to determine the possible contribution of renal dopamine (DA) and DA receptors in the natriuretic response to acute sodium loading. Fenoldopam (0.5 microgram/kg/min) produced significant increases in urine output (UV) and urinary sodium excretion (UNaV) without altering mean blood pressure (MBP), renal blood flow (RBF) or heart rate (HR), suggesting a direct tubular site of action. This renal response to fenoldopam was completely abolished in the presence of the selective DA-1 receptor antagonist, SCH 23390. Isotonic NaCl loading (5% body weight for 1 h) enhanced urinary DA excretion (UDA V) which correlated significantly with the increase in UNa V. Pretreatment with selective DA-1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 resulted in significant attenuation of the increase in UNa V whereas the increase in UDA V was unaltered. Pretreatment with selective DA-2 receptor antagonist domperidone did not alter the increase in UNa V during isotonic NaCl loading. These results suggest that renal tubules are endowed with DA-1 receptors activation which results in diuresis and natriuresis. Furthermore, activation of these DA-1 receptors but not DA-2 receptors by endogenous DA contributes to the natriuretic response to isotonic saline loading.\r"

Dopamine is synthesized from L-DOPA in the proximal tubule and presumably secreted as an autocrine/paracrine substance to stimulate DA-1 receptors localized on proximal tubular cells. We have previously reported the presence of DA-1 receptors in renal cortical homogenates and on the isolated proximal tubule of the rat and rabbit, consistent with the dopamine autocrine/paracrine model. We have localized DA-1 receptors in the proximal straight tubule of the rabbit, and in the cortical collecting duct of the rabbit and rat, but not in the distal collecting tubule or the cortical thick ascending loop of Henle. The presence of functional DA-1 receptors has been substantiated by the coexistence of DA-1 agonist-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in the same nephron segments in which DA-r receptors have been found. Increased concentrations of intrarenal dopamine induced by dopamine-beta-hydroxylase inhibition with SKF-102698 caused a down regulation of proximal tubular DA-1 receptors and almost complete ablation of DA-1 agonist stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. Thus, dopamine may play a role in the regulation of DA-1 receptors and their linkage with adenylate cyclase. Since alterations in the renal dopaminergic system have been measured in some forms of experimental hypertension, we studied DA-1 receptors and their coupling to adenylate cyclase in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The majority, 596 persons (77.4%), experienced a fall from their chairs or tipped over. Of 85 deaths (11%) caused by environmental factors, stairs were implicated in 51 (60.0%). Of 48 fatal burns (6.2%), 27 (57.3%) were related to smoking. Asphyxia owing to restraints occurred in 44 persons (5.7%) of all ages and caused 10 of the 17 deaths (58.8%) among persons 1-20 yr old. Wheelchair-related accidental death is uncommon (about 0.2% of serious accidents per year), but some types of accidents appear to be preventable.\r"

Lesions to 12 of the 37 brain sites investigated (anterior pretectal area, subthalamus, posterolateral hypothalamus, frontocingulate cortex, anterior thalamus, mediodorsal thalamus, ventromedial thalamus, parafascicular nucleus, mamillary bodies, cerebellum, olfactory bulb, and ventromedial hypothalamus) retarded puzzle-box learning. This study, combined with earlier investigation of 11 additional brain sites, show that 21 of the 48 total brain structures are involved in motor skill learning. These findings suggest that motor skill learning requires the integrity of a nonspecific mechanism and several specific mechanisms, such as vestibular-proprioceptive-kinesthetic discrimination mechanism and probably also response flexibility, visuospatial attentional, visual discrimination and place learning mechanisms.\r"

The lumbrical latency at 12 cm and the APB at 8 cm were found to be similar at less than 4.3 ms. Amplitudes to the lumbrical were 0.6-8 mV compared with 4-13.6 mV for the APB. Three patients who had an abnormal sensory study, yet normal motor values to the APB, were found to have abnormal lumbrical latencies. This is an additional technique that could be useful for individuals suspected of carpal tunnel syndrome who have normal latencies and amplitudes to the APB.\r"

Injury or entrapment of the deep peroneal sensory nerve is part of the differential diagnosis; however, no technique studying the deep peroneal sensory conduction velocity has been described. We describe a technique that is simple and reproducible with averaging. We electrophysiologically studied the deep peroneal sensory nerve in 40 neurologically healthy adult subjects. The latency to onset of the sensory action potential was 2.9 +/- 0.4 ms (range = 2.1-3.6 ms). The latency to the peak of the sensory action potential was 3.6 +/- 0.4 ms (range = 2.7-4.2 ms). The conduction velocity was 42 +/- 5 m/s (range = 33-53 m/s). The amplitude was 3.4 +/- 1.2 microV (range = 1.6-6.6 microV). We conclude that the deep peroneal sensory nerve is readily accessible for electrophysiologic evaluation. It may be of value in diagnosing deep peroneal nerve pathology.\r"

The objective of this study was to analyze the occurrence of pain in patients treated with one of the three exercise programs commonly used in the rehabilitation of hemiplegia: 1) range of motion by the therapist, 2) skate board and 3) overhead pulley. Of the 48 hemiplegic patients evaluated, 28 were assigned to one of the three exercise groups. Comparing the number of patients who developed pain in each group, there was a significant difference, with 8% of the patients in the range of motion by the therapist group, 12% of the patients in the skate board group and 62% of the patients in the overhead pulley group developing pain (chi 2 = 8.44) (P = 0.014). The three groups did not differ in the side of involvement (P = 0.57), extent of hemiplegia (P = 0.25) or presence of subluxation (P = 0.84). Use of overhead pulley has the highest risk of developing shoulder pain and should be avoided during rehabilitation of stroke patients.\r"

Ten intact medium-sized acoustic neurinomas were studied by means of classic staining procedures and an immunohistochemical technique using monoclonal mouse antibodies to human neurofilaments. Our observations indicate that the cochlear nerve is histologically involved in the tumoral process in those cases in which macroscopically visible adherences between the cochlear nerve and the tumor are present. We were not able to discern a clear cleavage plane. Six of the 10 specimens showed tumoral invasion of the cochlear nerve. Several therapeutic attitudes are discussed in view of these observations and reports from the international literature. In conclusion, the principle of hearing preservation surgery is rejected in favor of total tumor removal in every case in which surgery is indicated.\r"

Histologic sections of 20 temporal bones from children younger than 2 years were examined to determine the diameter of the facial nerve and fallopian canal at the meatal foramen and in the labyrinthine segment. No statistically significant difference in the nerve/canal ratios in these areas was found. Comparisons were made with similar data from 10 adult temporal bones. The nerve/canal ratios in the labyrinthine portion were similar in both age groups; however, the ratio at the meatal foramen was significantly smaller in children. This may be due, in part, to growth of the vertical crest, which was found to increase considerably in length and width by adulthood. These results suggest that the facial nerve is not as tightly contained at the meatal foramen in children and provides a possible explanation for the relative infrequency of Bell's palsy in this age group.\r"

Thresholds were achieved at lower current settings, the resultant compound action potential exhibited a greater amplitude, and masseter muscle excitation was more evident following stimulation over the buccal region. The use of concurrent facial- and masseter-evoked electromyographic monitoring allows more sensitive detection of masseter excitation and a more accurate determination of the current level necessary for supramaximal stimulation.\r"

The three main types of procedure were castellated laryngotracheoplasty, anterior cartilage rib grafting, and anterior and posterior cricoid cuts with or without grafting. All cases but 1 (44/45) of congenital subglottic stenosis have been successfully decannulated, 7 requiring a second procedure.

Doses ranging from 30 micrograms/m2 to 500 micrograms/m2 were administered as subcutaneous bolus injection daily for 15 days. A dose-dependent increase in platelet counts ranging from 1.3-fold at 60 micrograms/m2 to 1.9-fold at 250 micrograms/m2 was induced by rhIL-3 in 15 of 18 evaluable patients with normal hematopoiesis. An increase in reticulocyte counts was observed in 14 patients. The blood leukocyte counts dose dependently increased 1.4- to 3.0-fold. In patients with bone marrow failure, platelet counts increased by a mean of sixfold (range, 1.3-fold to 14.3-fold) in five of eight evaluable patients. Reticulocyte counts increased 4.4-fold in six patients, and neutrophil counts increased by a mean of 3.1-fold in all eight patients. Platelet transfusions could be discontinued after treatment with rhIL-3 in two of three transfusion-dependent patients. Only mild side effects, mainly fever, headache, and flushing, were observed. These results indicate that rhIL-3 functions as a multilineage hematopoietin in vivo in patients with normal bone marrow function and in patients with secondary bone marrow failure.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously reported that 20 hours' preincubation of human bone marrow cells with interleukin-1 beta (IL-1) can protect early progenitor cells from 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC) cytotoxicity. Since tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) shares many of the biologic properties of IL-1, we have compared the protective effects of TNF alpha with IL-1 against 4-HC. Incubation of human bone marrow mononuclear cells or an enriched progenitor population for 20 hours with either TNF alpha or IL-1 resulted in the survival of an increased number of single- and mixed-lineage colonies, including replatable blast cell colonies, while only rare colonies were seen in the control group. Antibodies to TNF alpha completely abolished the protection observed with IL-1, while antibodies to IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta decreased but did not abolish the protection seen with TNF alpha. Combinations of low doses of TNF alpha and IL-1 showed synergy in their protective effects. Furthermore, no protection was observed by IL-1, IL-1 bone-marrow-conditioned medium (IL-1-BMCM), or TNF alpha for HL-60, K562, KG1, KG1a, and DU.528 leukemic-cell lines or primary acute myelogenous leukemic (AML) blast cells from the lethal effects of 4-HC. In the case of HL-60 and KG1a cell lines, TNF alpha preincubation resulted in increased cytotoxicity. Furthermore, preincubation of a mixture of AML cells and normal bone-marrow cells with IL-1 + TNF alpha before 4-HC resulted in the protection of normal but not leukemic progenitors. These results suggest that TNF alpha is necessary for the protection of normal, early, human hematopoietic progenitors from 4-HC, while IL-1 is not mandatory but will synergize with TNF alpha to offer increased protection. In addition, no protection from 4-HC is observed by TNF alpha, IL-1, or IL-1-BMCM for primary leukemic blast cells or leukemic cell lines.\r"

  ".W": "The modal DNA content of normal marrow megakaryocytes from species so far examined usually has been reported to be 16N. In this report we describe an exception in the C3H mouse whose megakaryocytes have a modal DNA content of 32N. Female C3H/HEN mice had an average DNA content distribution of 14% 8N, 37% 16N, 43% 32N, and 6% 64N. Male C3H/HEN mice had somewhat higher proportions of 32N and 64N megakaryocytes (average DNA content distribution of 12% 8N, 29% 16N, 47% 32N, and 12% 64N) than females. All 11 other mouse strains examined had 16N as the modal megakaryocyte DNA content, although the proportions in the various polyploid DNA classes showed some strain variation. Megakaryocyte size was similar among all 12 strains evaluated, and mean platelet volume (MPV) of C3H/HEN mice differed from only 1 of the other 4 strains analyzed. Platelet counts of C3H/HEN mice were similar to those of six, and slightly but significantly lower than those of five other mouse strains examined. Compared with megakaryocyte concentrations of other mouse strains studied, that of C3H/HEN mice was similar to seven, somewhat higher than one, and slightly lower than three strains. Offspring from reciprocal matings of C57BL/6 and C3H/HEN mice had megakaryocyte DNA distributions intermediate between those of the parent strains, suggesting that a higher gene dosage of some component is responsible for the right-shifted megakaryocyte DNA content distribution phenotype of C3H mice. The proportions of 32N and 64N megakaryocytes increased in C3H/HEN mice in response to acute thrombocytopenia, as did those of CBA/CAJ mice used as a comparative strain. In summary, megakaryocytes of the C3H mouse have a higher average DNA content but similar platelet count, MPV, and megakaryocyte size and concentration as those of most other mouse strains. These results suggest that the number of platelets produced per unit of C3H megakaryocyte DNA is less than that for other mice.\r"

  ".W": "Despite significant progress in elucidating the biochemistry of the hemostatic mechanism, the process of blood coagulation in vivo remains poorly understood. Factor IX is a vitamin K-dependent glycoprotein that can be activated by factor XIa or the factor VII-tissue factor complex in vitro. To investigate the role of these two pathways in factor IX activation in humans, we have developed a sensitive procedure for quantifying the peptide that is liberated with the generation of factor IXa. The antibody population used for the immunoassay was raised in rabbits and chromatographed on a factor IX-agarose immunoadsorbent to obtain antibody populations with minimal intrinsic reactivity toward factor IX. We determined that the mean level of the factor IX activation peptide (FIXP) in normal individuals under the age of 40 years was 203 pmol/L and that levels increased significantly with advancing age. The mean concentration of FIXP was markedly reduced to 22.7 pmol/L in nine patients with hereditary factor VII deficiency (factor VII coagulant activity less than 7%) but was not significantly different from normal controls in nine subjects with factor XI deficiency (factor XI coagulant activity less than 8%). These data indicate that factor IXa generation in vivo results mainly from the activity of the tissue factor mechanism rather than the contact system (factor XII, prekallikrein, high molecular-weight kininogen, factor XI). Our results may also help to explain the absence of a bleeding diathesis in many patients with deficiencies of the contact factors of coagulation.\r"

  ".U": "90345028\r", 
  ".W": "Acetylcholinesterase is a key enzyme in cholinergic neurotransmission for hydrolyzing acetylcholine and has been shown to possess arylacylamidase activity in addition to esterase activity. The enzyme is found at various loci, where its functional significance remains to be clarified, and it exists in multiple molecular forms. Sheep platelets have been shown to exhibit acetylcholinesterase activity associated with plasma membrane (Bp), endoplasmic reticulum (Cp), mitochondria granules (Dp), and soluble (As) fractions. These activities show differences in some physicochemical and kinetic properties. The soluble acetylcholinesterase is the most thermostable, and the enzyme from the Cp fractions shows the lowest affinity for the acetylthiocholine substrate and the strongest inhibition by fluoride. In all cases a noncompetitive inhibition of the enzyme by this ion is found. When membrane-bound acetylcholinesterases were assayed at temperatures between 12 degrees C and 33 degrees C, the Arrhenius plots of all activities exhibited a break point at about 17 degrees C. This discontinuity was abolished by addition of detergent to the assay medium (0.02% Triton X-100, final concentration). Their Hill coefficients were calculated in the presence of fluoride, showing unitary values in all cases, which points to a noncooperative effect and nonallosteric behavior in the particulate enzyme. These results suggest that the sheep platelet acetylcholinesterase associated with membrane-bound systems is modulated by the physical state of its environment, despite the fact that the enzyme might be lipid- or nonlipid-dependent.\r"

At birth, affected mice are pale with intradermal petechiae and bruises on exposed surfaces. Central nervous system (CNS) bleeding occurs in 22% of the mice. Gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhaging and splenomegaly are noted in moribund mice at autopsy. Of the 291 mice studied, 113 mice survived the initial crisis and entered a spontaneous remission period lasting from day 16 to day 27. A second crisis period ensued, and all but 22 mice died by 45 days. Mice in crisis show significantly decreased platelets, erythrocytes, and leukocytes and increased reticulocytes when compared to normal littermates. During remission all parameters are significantly improved or revert to normal values. Neither splenomegaly nor internal bleeding are observed during remission. A platelet-specific antibody is present in the plasma of mutant mice during crisis. The symptoms (severe bleeding, anemia, low-platelet counts) and platelet-specific antibody production are transferred to lethally irradiated normal mice through spleen cell transplantation. Splenectomy of mice in remission significantly increases survival. Exploitation of the features common to both scat/scat mice and patients with some forms of autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura will undoubtedly prove useful in defining common pathways of disease development and in testing potential therapeutic measures.\r"

  ".W": "We analyzed the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) beta chain (p70-75) on various leukemic cells from 44 patients by flow cytometric analysis using the IL-2R beta chain-specific monoclonal antibody (MoAb), designated Mik-beta 1, which has been recently developed. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated the expression of the IL-2R beta chain on granular lymphocytes (GLs) from all eight patients with granular lymphocyte proliferative disorders (GLPDs), on adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells from all three patients with ATL, and on T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells from one of three patients with T-ALL. Although GLs from all the GLPD patients expressed the IL-2R beta chain alone and not the IL-2R alpha chain (Tac-antigen: p55), ATL and T-ALL cells expressing the beta chain coexpressed the alpha chain. In two of seven patients with common ALL (cALL) and in both patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the leukemic cells expressed the alpha chain alone. Neither the alpha chain nor the beta chain was expressed on leukemic cells from the remaining 28 patients, including all 18 patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, five of seven patients with cALL, all three patients with multiple myeloma, and two of three patients with T-ALL. These results indicate that three different forms of IL-2R chain expression exist on leukemic cells: the alpha chain alone; the beta chain alone; and both the alpha and beta chains. To examine whether the results obtained by flow cytometric analysis actually reflect functional aspects of the expressed IL-2Rs, we studied the specific binding of 125I-labeled IL-2 (125I-IL-2) to leukemic cells in 18 of the 44 patients. In addition, we performed 125I-IL-2 crosslinking studies in seven patients. The results of IL-2R expression of both 125I-IL-2 binding assay and crosslinking studies were in agreement with those obtained by flow cytometric analysis. These results indicate that flow cytometric analysis using MoAbs, anti-Tac, and Mik-beta 1 is useful for detecting the expression of the IL-2R chains.\r"

  ".W": "Indirect immunofluorescence staining with monoclonal antibody (MoAb) CL203.4 of malignant cells from 269 patients with hematologic malignancies showed a heterogeneous expression of CD54/intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). This marker was expressed by malignant cells of 57 out of 118 patients with myeloid malignancies and 69 out of 135 with B-lymphoid malignancies. On the other hand, CD54 was not detected on malignant cells of 16 patients with T-lymphoid malignancies. In myeloid malignancies, CD54 is preferentially expressed by \"stem cell-derived\" malignancies, being detectable on blast cells from almost all patients affected by chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast phase or myelodysplastic syndromes and by only 34% of patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The expression of CD54 did not correlate with any specific myeloid FAB subtype, although three cases of highly undifferentiated AML (FAB MO) displayed maximal levels of the antigen. The expression of CD54 in AML was significantly associated with that of CD34 and HLA-DR antigens. In B-lymphoid malignancies, CD54 expression appears to correlate with the differentiation stage of malignant cells, since B-origin acute lymphoblastic leukemias and conventional B-chronic lymphocytic leukemias (B-CLL; ie, \"dim SIg\" CLL) expressed lower levels of CD54 than more mature lymphoproliferative disorders (\"bright SIg\" CLL, prolymphocytic leukemias, and lymphoplasmacytic tumors). \"High-grade\" B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (B-NHL) express in general a higher level of CD54 than \"low-grade\" ones. This finding in conjunction with the expression of CD54 in all 17 patients with \"bright SIg\" CLL investigated (characterized by marked organomegaly and poor prognosis) suggest that the differential expression of CD54 in lymphoproliferative disorders may also relate to their degree of malignancy.\r"

The cell line L428, representing an in vitro counterpart of Hodgkin and Sternberg-Reed cells, could be shown to release a factor capable of suppressing the binding of sheep red blood cells (SRBC) to normal peripheral-blood T lymphocytes or to a T-cell line (L735). At maximally effective concentrations, RIF (rosette inhibiting factor) inhibited T lymphocyte rosetting by approximately 40% (mean from 184 healthy controls). The diminished E rosetting of T lymphocytes from Hodgkin's patients was not further suppressed by added RIF. This factor inhibited binding of SRBC to their target cells at 37 degrees C but not at 4 degrees C. The factor could be stored lyophilized at -20 degrees C and was stable at 56 degrees C (30 minutes). RIF was inactive below pH 6 and above pH 9 or after trypsin digestion. Purification by affinity, ion exchange, and molecular sieve chromatography showed activity peaks at 12.5 Kd, 25 Kd, 50 Kd, and 100 Kd.\r"

In this study we show that tuftsin, a natural stimulator of many functions of monocytes and macrophages, also stimulates a potent PCA in mixed mononuclear cells and monocytes, and a mild PCA in lymphocytes and cell lines of monocytic origin (U937 and THP). No activity was generated by several lymphoid cell lines and HL-60 cells. The PCA resembled TF in that it accelerated clotting through the extrinsic coagulation pathway and was inhibited by concanavalin-A and by monoclonal anti-TF antibodies. The induction of TF-like activity by tuftsin was dose- and time-dependent. It was located in the cell membrane and did not require T cells for expression. Generation of TF-like activity was prevented by actinomycin D, while cytarabine had no effect on this process, suggesting that expression of the activity depends on protein synthesis. Studies with various tuftsin analogs suggest that tuftsin stimulates generation of TF-like activity, as well as other functions of monocytes via the same receptors. The results with the monocytic cell lines show that tuftsin affects mainly mature cells. The induction of TF-like activity in mononuclear cells by tuftsin constitutes an important link between mononuclear cells and the immune and coagulation systems. It may play a major role in the pathogenesis of thromboembolism and fibrin deposition in various inflammatory and immunologic disorders.\r"

Unambiguous determination of carrier status in related females in informative families will also be possible. In addition, we have identified an apparently unique small deletion in the X-CGD gene in a family affected by this disease, members of which are not informative for either polymorphism.

  ".W": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are thought to play a role in the aging process as well as in a number of human diseases states. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), an enzyme that scavenges the superoxide anion (O2-) is constitutively expressed in leukocytes and other tissues. When assayed in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL), constitutive SOD activity shows little variation among individuals of different ages. We have found that significant induction of SOD activity occurs in PBL incubated in vitro with paraquat, an agent known to cause intracellular O2- production. This induction was found to be highly age dependent; lymphocytes from 36 healthy subjects aged 20 to 40 years showed an increase of 85% +/- 10%, versus an increase of only 8% +/- 1% for lymphocytes from 30 healthy subjects aged 65 to 79 years (P less than 10(-4)). Forty subjects, aged 67 to 73 years, who were healthy at the time of assay of leukocyte SOD induction were followed up 5 years later. Nineteen of these subjects had died; all 19 had shown SOD induction of less than 10% (range, 0% to 7%; mean, 2.4%). In contrast, of the 21 survivors (range, 2.5% to 50%; mean, 21%), 12 had shown SOD induction greater than 10%, and 7 had shown SOD induction greater than or equal to 35% (P less than 10(-3)). Thirteen of the 19 deaths were attributable to malignancy or cerebrocardiovascular disease. Preservation of leukocyte SOD inducibility appears to correlate with longevity in elderly individuals and may be of value in predicting resistance to malignancy or fetal cardiovascular events.\r"

However, glycophorin A from En (a+) Wr (a+b-) red cells has an amino acid sequence identical to that of glycophorin A from Wr (b+) erythrocytes. Evidence has suggested that the Wrb antigen may require the interaction of glycophorin A with either a lipid moiety or with another erythrocyte-integral membrane protein, band 3. We have investigated the role of band 3 in Wrb expression using murine monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) with Wrb specificity. These antibodies reacted by radioimmunoassay (RIA) only with cells expressing both glycophorin A and band 3. In immunoprecipitation studies, Wrb antibodies immunoprecipitated both band 3 and glycophorin A, while antibodies specific for band 3 or glycophorin precipitated only the protein with which they were reactive. These data strongly suggest that band 3 is the other membrane component necessary for expression of Wrb and that band 3 and glycophorin A are closely associated in the erythrocyte membrane.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated whether the platelet-membrane surface carries IgG allotypic antigens and whether these determinants may be important in platelet transfusion therapy. Using a hemagglutination inhibition assay, we showed that the G1m IgG allotypes (a, x, f) and K1m and K3m light-chain allotypes are expressed on the surface of platelets, whereas G3m allotype antigenic determinants were not detectable. In 146 multitransfused thrombocytopenic patients, 35 (24%) patients were found to have antiallotypic antibodies. To study the effect of antiallotypic antibodies on platelet transfusion outcome, patients received platelet transfusions from donors, either positive or negative for the IgG allotype to which patients were immunized. Of the 19 antigen-positive and 19 antigen-negative platelet transfusions given, respectively, the mean platelet count increments at 1 hour were 8,402 +/- 6,402 +/- 6,721 (1 SD) and 9,799 +/- 5,559 (1 SD) P less than .2. Transfusion reactions were not more common when antigen-positive platelet transfusions were given. Despite the presence of IgG allotypic determinants on platelets, allotypic antibodies do not decrease platelet transfusion recovery. Furthermore, passive administration of plasma containing IgG allotypes to patients with antiallotypic antibodies does not lead to innocent bystander-mediated platelet destruction.\r"

  ".U": "90345093\r", 
  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine the frequency of an abnormal bleeding time in patients with cirrhosis and to relate this to known factors that affect primary haemostasis and to the severity of liver disease. DESIGN--Prospective clinical and laboratory study in patients admitted for complications or investigations of liver disease. SETTING--Royal Free Hospital hepatobiliary and liver transplantation unit. SUBJECTS--100 Consecutive inpatients aged 17-74 with various forms of cirrhosis, including alcoholic, biliary, autoimmune, viral, and cryptogenic. At least 10 days had elapsed since any episodes of bleeding, resolution of sepsis, or alcohol intake. No patient was taking any drug known to affect primary haemostasis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Bleeding time as measured with the Simplate double blade template device. A bleeding time longer than 10 minutes was considered abnormal. Other measures were platelet count, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, packed cell volume, and blood urea, serum bilirubin, and serum albumin concentrations, all measured on each subject at the same time by standard laboratory methods. RESULTS--A weak but significant correlation existed between the bleeding time and the platelet count (rs = 0.483; p less than 0.001). There were significantly lower platelet counts, longer prothrombin times, and higher blood urea and serum bilirubin concentrations in the 42 patients with bleeding times of 10 minutes or more compared with the 58 patients with bleeding times less than 10 minutes. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the bilirubin concentration as well as the platelet count was independently correlated with the bleeding time. The combination of a platelet count greater than 80 x 10(9)/l and a prothrombin time less than 17 seconds (usually taken as safe limits for performing routine liver biopsy) did not predict a normal bleeding time. Ten of 39 patients fulfilling these criteria had a prolonged bleeding time. CONCLUSIONS--Prolonged bleeding time is common in patients with cirrhosis, even in those with prothrombin times and platelet counts within \"safe limits\" for invasive procedures. The severity of liver disease as assessed by the bilirubin concentration plays an important part in determining the bleeding time in cirrhosis. The bleeding time should be measured when assessing patients for invasive procedures who have a raised bilirubin concentration or poor hepatic function, even if the platelet count and prothrombin time are considered adequate.\r"

DESIGN--Nine year retrospective study. SETTING--Cambridge and King's College Hospital liver transplant programme. SUBJECTS--24 Patients (three women, 21 men) with alcoholic cirrhosis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Survival, rehabilitation, and clinical and laboratory evidence of a return to harmful drinking after transplantation. RESULTS--15 Patients were selected for transplantation because of repeated admission to hospital for the complications of advanced portal hypertension despite abstinence, and six because they had a hepatocellular carcinoma superimposed on alcoholic cirrhosis. Three patients who were not abstinent received transplants. The one year survival rate was 66%, and of the 18 patients surviving at least three months, 17 had been rehabilitated. In three patients laboratory variables and histological examination of the liver suggested a return to drinking, though they did not admit to taking alcohol. These patients represented the only cases in the series that were not abstinent before transplantation. CONCLUSIONS--The survival and rehabilitation of patients who received transplants for alcoholic cirrhosis compared favourably with those of patients who received transplants for cirrhosis of other aetiology. The criteria for selection for liver transplantation in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis should include recurrent complications related to severe portal hypertension despite maximum medical treatment in addition to a minimum period of six months of abstinence before transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVES--To determine whether among people aged 65 and over those who died at advanced old age spent more of their last year of life in hospital than those who died younger, and whether the increase in longevity in the elderly between 1976 and 1985 was accompanied by increased time spent in hospital in the last year of life. DESIGN--Linkage of death records to abstracts of records of hospital inpatient care in the preceding year of patients' lives. SETTING--Six health districts in England covered by the Oxford record linkage study. RESULTS--People who died at advanced ages (85 and over) were less likely than people who died at younger ages (65-84) to have been admitted to hospital in the last year of life. Once admitted the very old tended to spend longer in hospital than others. The mean total time spent in hospital by the elderly in the year before death (based on all deaths including those among people not admitted at all) showed no appreciable change over time. The median time in hospital based on all deaths increased by about three days between 1976 and 1985. During that time there was a gain in life expectancy in the population of about one year from the age of 65. CONCLUSION--The gain in life expectancy in this population was not at the expense of any substantial increase in time spent in hospital in the final year of life.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective study of patients attending an urban centre group practice. SETTING--Urban health centre group practice with five doctors and 12,000 patients in an area of high (greater than 20%) unemployment and social deprivation. PATIENTS--All attenders at the open access surgery and one in four consecutive attenders by appointment, selected sequentially from the first three appointments, during 10 days in January 1989. Patients participating in the pilot study, reattending during the study period, or attending antenatal clinics were excluded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Patients' attitude to making appointments and reasons for attending, including perception of urgency, with respect to sociodemographic and psychosocial data obtained from a self completed questionnaire before the consultation. Doctors' diagnosis and perception of urgency obtained from a separate questionnaire. RESULTS--86% (141/172) Of patients attending without appointments and 96% (139/145) with appointments responded to the questionnaire. The need for consultation was considered to be \"very urgent\" or \"fairly urgent\" in significantly more of the open access group than the appointments group (89%, 124/139 v 66%, 91/138; chi 2 = 27.04, df = 3; p less than 0.001), although the doctors did not share the same views. Significantly more patients had self limiting conditions of recent onset in the open access than in the appointments group (75%, 101/135 v 48%, 59/123: p less than 0.001). Overall, open access attendance was significantly linked with social support (39%, 48/124 v 26%, 32/123; p less than 0.05) and with marital separations or intentions to separate (10%, 9/87 v 0/92; 47%, 32/87 v 22%, 20/92 respectively; both p less than 0.001), but the doctors recorded significantly fewer psychological and social problems in these patients (p less than 0.05). Although almost half those in the appointments group considered that making appointments was inconvenient, more of those in the open access group agreed with this view (47%, 60/129 v 61%, 80/131). CONCLUSIONS--There was an important link between social support problems and a negative attitude to making appointments. In our previous experience encouraging patients to make appointments has been unsuccessful; practices serving areas with a high prevalence of social deprivation providing a mixed open access and appointments system may better serve patients' needs.\r"

DESIGN--Data from postal questionnaire on morbidity after childbirth sent to women who had delivered in one maternity hospital between 1978 and 1985 were linked to maternity case notes for each woman. SETTING--Maternity hospital in Birmingham. SUBJECTS--11,701 Women who had delivered their most recent baby at the maternity hospital during the defined period and who returned their completed questionnaires. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS--Of the 1634 women who reported backache, 1132 (69%) had had it for over a year. A significant association was found between backache and epidural anaesthesia (relative risk = 1.8); 903 of 4766 women (18.9%) who had had epidural anaesthesia reported this symptom, compared with 731 of the 6935 women (10.5%) who had not had epidural anaesthesia. This association was consistent in both \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" deliveries, the only exception being after an elective caesarean section when no excess backache occurred after epidural anaesthesia. CONCLUSIONS--The relation between backache and epidural anaesthesia is probably causal. It seems to result from a combination of effective analgesia and stressed posture during labour. Further investigations on the mechanisms causing backache after epidural anaesthesia are required.\r"

The 5-year relative survival rate of patients with a tumour of the colon, irrespective of histopathological diagnosis, was 62.0 per cent below the age of 40 years and 44.4 per cent in those 40 years of age or older (P less than 0.05). The corresponding figures for patients with a tumour of the rectum were 46.6 per cent and 39.1 per cent, respectively. When the relative survival was analysed separately for patients with a histopathologically demonstrated adenocarcinoma, the 5-year survival rate among patients with a cancer of the colon was 50.9 per cent in patients below 40 years of age and 48.6 per cent in those 40 years of age or older. In patients with adenocarcinoma of the rectum, the 5-year relative survival rate was 41.1 per cent in patients younger than 40 years of age and 40.7 per cent in patients 40 years of age or older. Thus, patients below the age of 40 years with an adenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum as a group appear to have the same or even a better prognosis than older patients if all tumours are considered, irrespective of histopathological diagnosis.\r"

Between 1948 and 1983, 4250 patients underwent surgery for rectal carcinoma at St. Mark's Hospital, London. From these, 250 patients were selected who had undergone curative anterior resection of a Dukes' C adenocarcinoma and their records were examined. In 150 (60 per cent) the inferior mesenteric artery was ligated above the origin of the left colic artery. The outcome was analysed using the Dukes', Gastrointestinal Tumour Study Group and Astler-Coller classifications, either alone or in combination. Tumour differentiation and extent of local invasion were also considered. Despite this detailed analysis, no improved survival was seen in patients when the inferior mesenteric artery was ligated above the origin of the left colic artery.\r"

Univariate analysis showed an association between perioperative transfusion with plasma and the earlier recurrence of tumour. Allowing for possible confounding factors the relative risk of recurrence for patients receiving plasma was 2.44 (95 per cent confidence interval = 1.10-5.46, P = 0.041) and for patients receiving whole blood or plasma, it was 2.39 (95 per cent confidence interval = 1.19-4.83, P = 0.021). The risk of recurrence for those receiving a transfusion of plasma was, therefore, more than twice that of those not given it. We were unable to demonstrate an independent harmful effect of transfusion with packed cells. These data suggest that the plasma protein, rather than the cellular component of whole blood, mediates the accelerated tumour recurrence.\r"

Three of the patients had an anterior or total pelvic exenteration with continent urinary diversion by the Mitrofanoff technique. Two of the patients had complete vaginal reconstruction and one patient had after-loading catheters inserted for postoperative interstitial irradiation. The patients were in hospital for 42, 28, 21, 17 and 15 days respectively. The longest stays were associated with training for self-catheterization of the continent urinary diversion. Median follow-up was 9 months. One patient developed two perineal recurrences at 16 months which were resected, and she remains disease-free 6 months later.\r"

Thirty-seven patients were identified and invited to attend for follow-up. Twenty-seven (73 per cent) were examined and included in the survey. Mean age at survey was 7.8 years (range 1.6-17.6 years) and mean duration since operation was 6.3 years. Necrotizing enterocolitis and intussusception were the commonest indications for operation. As judged by height, weight and skin fold thickness, all patients were well nourished. Seven (26 per cent) had loose stools, five had chronic folic acid deficiency and one was vitamin B12 deficient. We conclude that resection of the ileocaecal region is well tolerated in childhood and does not affect growth. Loose stools are directly related to the length of ileal resection.\r"

  ".W": "Injuries to the intestine and mesentery are often found in patients undergoing laparotomy for blunt abdominal trauma. Although treatment of perforations is relatively straightforward, the same is not true for contusions. Few guidelines exist at present to aid the surgeon in deciding which injuries require resection in order to avoid the complications of delayed perforation and late stricture formation. The natural history of these non-perforating intestinal and mesenteric injuries has been examined in an experimental model to identify possible criteria on which future management can be based. In the immediate postinjury period peristalsis and local mesenteric pulsation were absent in the majority of injuries which went on to full recovery and these observations are thus of little predictive value in predicting outcome. The initial size of contusion (length of contusion along longitudinal axis of bowel) relative to bowel wall circumference (BWC) was related to complications as follows: contusion less than BWC (n = 47)--one complication; contusion greater than BWC (n = 8)--three complications (P = 0.02). Similarly, six mesenteric injuries which produced an initial ischaemia (assessed by fluorescein) less than twice the BWC did not result in any complications, compared with four complications which occurred in ten cases when the initial ischaemia was greater than twice the BWC. These results go some way towards providing a better understanding of these injuries and in turn may help the emergency surgeon in deciding which injuries require resection.\r"

Of the patients 22 (20 per cent), eight of whom were considered to have peritoneal penetration, underwent conservative management. None required delayed laparotomy. Eight patients (7 per cent) died, all deaths occurring in the positive laparotomy group. The incidence of significant intra-abdominal injury if the peritoneal cavity had been penetrated was 89 per cent.

The operative mortality rate for patients presenting with rest pain or ulceration/gangrene was 6 per cent. Cumulative 5-year survival and limb salvage were 44 per cent and 86 per cent respectively. Graft occlusion was the principal cause of worsening symptoms during follow-up (5-year primary patency of 68 per cent) and accounted for all major amputations of the operated limb. Axillounifemoral grafts had a significantly worse 5-year patency (50 per cent) than axillobifemoral grafts (80 per cent, P less than 0.05) and three of five patients who developed worsening symptoms in the non-operated limb died or required a major limb amputation as a consequence. Axillofemoral bypass is a valuable alternative to major aortic reconstruction in elderly patients and allows a greater proportion to be offered reconstruction than would otherwise be possible.\r"

There is no contribution by blood vessels that pass through the soleus muscle. When a posterior flap for below-knee amputation is constructed the soleus muscle should be completely excised.\r"

When considered as single factors, female (versus male), one lymph node involved (versus more than one node involved) and site of metastasis in the groin or axilla (versus the neck) were found to have significantly favourable effects on prognosis with 5-year survival rates of 82 per cent (25 per cent), 82 per cent (27 per cent) and 80 per cent (11 per cent) respectively. However, at multifactorial analysis only the site of cervical metastases maintained a significant influence on survival (P = 0.005). As survival in this series is comparable with, or even better than, that of adequately treated patients with lymph node metastasis from a known primary melanoma, a radical node dissection is essential also in these patients.\r"

At the time of discharge a low-fat diet (50 g/day) was prescribed. Six months after surgery, mean faecal fat excretion decreased further to 8.3 g/day (P less than 0.01) and all patients but one gained weight, reaching 93 per cent of the usual mean body-weight with normalized nutritional parameters.

The mammographic abnormality was missed in 14 (2.7 per cent) cases or only partly excised in 13 (2.5 per cent). Overall 144 (28.0 per cent) localization biopsies were malignant. The mammographic abnormality was not visualized on the specimen radiograph more frequently in women aged under 55 years, in women with dense breast (Wolfe grade DM or DY) or in those whose mammographic abnormality contained only microcalcification. The 27 women in whom the mammographic abnormality was not visible on the specimen radiograph underwent repeat mammography 2 months later. Only two women required a further localization biopsy and the mammographic abnormality was recovered in the first piece of tissue excised. Women with a carcinoma underwent mastectomy or wide local excision, and residual carcinoma at the localization biopsy site was found in 64 (44.4 per cent) cases. Oestrogen receptor analysis by ligand binding assay was possible in only 71 (49.3 per cent) carcinomas. If the specimen radiograph does not show the mammographic abnormality within pieces of tissue excised and there is no palpable nodule it may be best to conclude the biopsy. In this series these missed lesions were usually benign. Only rarely is a second localization biopsy required and this is performed without difficulty.\r"

The patients were divided into two groups: those operated on from September 1981 to March 1985 (n = 58) and those operated on from April 1985 to December 1988 (n = 105). There was an increase in the number of relatively small hepatocellular carcinomas in 1987-88. Differences in the incidence of accompanying liver cirrhosis (72 versus 62 per cent) were not statistically significant; however, values of the indocyanine green test (21.5 versus 17.0 per cent, P less than 0.01) aided in strict patient selection. In more recent years, initial hepatic hilar dissection for control of vascular structures was undertaken and an ultrasonic dissector was used in about three-quarters of these patients. Consequently, the mean estimated blood loss (2500 versus 1300 ml, P less than 0.001) and mean intraoperative blood replacement (2200 versus 560 ml, P less than 0.001) were significantly less than in the earlier period. Among the 58 patients treated in the early period, hospital morbidity and mortality rates were 52 and 29 per cent respectively. In contrast, the rates were 23.8 and 1.9 per cent respectively among the 105 patients operated on during the recent period (P less than 0.01). The decline in hospital mortality is attributed to the careful selection of patients, use of modern tools, and a diminished blood loss.\r"

  ".W": "Data on all discharges from hospitals in Scotland have been recorded since 1961 as the Scottish Hospital In-Patient Statistics and examination of these data has permitted analysis of the incidence and mortality trends from acute pancreatitis. The number of discharges recorded has increased 11-fold in males from 69 patients/year in 1961 to 750 patients/year in 1985, and fourfold in females from 112 patients/year to 484 patients/year respectively. This increase has occurred particularly amongst young and middle-aged males (20-59 years) and in elderly females (over 60 years), the most marked increases occurring in the health boards of the 'central belt' area of Scotland. Mortality rate did not show a corresponding change, increasing only two-fold in males from 15 patients/year to 30 patients/year and in females from 29 patients/year to 37 patients/year. As a consequence the case mortality rate has fallen from 17.8 per cent over the period 1961-65 to 5.6 per cent over the period 1981-85. An apparent increase in the incidence of acute pancreatitis may be inferred from these data, much of which is thought to be due to improved accuracy in diagnosis.\r"

From the reviewed case notes, 27 of these patients presented with recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis which disappeared after cholecystectomy (follow-up 65.1 months). A microscopic study revealed frank cholesterolosis in all cases with a pseudopolyp transformation of the mucosa, some polyps reaching a diameter of 2 mm. We postulate that the mechanism could be temporary impaction of cholesterolosis polyps at the sphincter of Oddi and suggest that patients with recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis and negative aetiological investigation must be considered as at high risk of having gallbladder cholesterolosis and that they could benefit from cholecystectomy.\r"

Early experience with eight patients treated by a variety of procedures including direct suture and flap techniques led to disappointingly high morbidity and mortality rates. Since 1986 a standardized surgical approach has been used in four patients without complications or mortality. Essential to management are preoperative diagnosis by ultrasonography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and classification of the Mirizzi syndrome into two types as proposed by McSherry. Mirizzi type I consists of an extrinsic compression of the hepatic duct by a calculus impacted in the cystic duct or in Hartmann's pouch. This is treated by cholecystectomy with or without common bile duct exploration. In the more difficult Mirizzi type II, the stone has eroded into the hepatic duct causing a cholecystcholedochal fistula. This is treated by partial cholecystectomy and a cholecystcholedochoduodenostomy. This management strategy prevents inadvertent bile duct injury and has yielded satisfactory results.\r"

There were no false positive diagnoses of malignancy. The accuracy of Tru-Cut biopsy was 98 per cent for the diagnosis of malignancy and 94 per cent for the diagnosis of sarcoma. Tumour subtype was correctly specified in 85 per cent of sarcomas and tumour grade in 88 per cent. Tru-Cut biopsy should replace open biopsy as the primary means of diagnosis of soft tissue tumours unless a satisfactory tissue sample cannot be obtained.\r"

  ".W": "We have retrospectively reviewed the case notes of 208 patients undergoing either cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenectomy with a view to determining the factors that predispose to complications and local recurrence. The most frequent complications were wound infection, seroma formation, paraesthesiae and lymphoedema. The main predisposing factor for complications was anatomical site; wound complications occur with twice the frequency in the inguinal lymphadenectomy group than in the two other sites. Preresection biopsy was also associated with an almost twofold increase in complications, while fine needle aspiration cytology was not. The two major factors influencing the incidence of local recurrence were the stage of the disease process and the use of preresection biopsy. There was a steady increase in the incidence of local recurrence with increasing stage of regional disease. In addition, local recurrence was almost twice as common in patients who had undergone biopsy before resection when compared with patients who either did not have tissue sampling before resection or had fine needle aspiration cytology alone. We conclude that fine needle aspiration cytology is safe and the investigation of choice in patients undergoing lymphadenectomy. In contrast, preresection biopsy should be avoided as it promotes both complications and local recurrence. In addition, wound complications and lymphoedema are frequent following lymphadenectomy, especially following inguinal dissection.\r"

By contrast, a defunctioning colostomy causes distal hypoplasia, and fewer tumours develop. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 160) were used to study adaptation (assessed by a stathmokinetic technique) and carcinogenesis (induced by azoxymethane) at an end-to-end anastomosis that was raised in either functioning or defunctioned left colon. Controls had no procedure and other rats had proximal colostomy alone. Defunction had a profound antitropic effect on the colon, reducing bowel length and weight and crypt cell production rate (CCPR) by 22-56 per cent. Anastomotic CCPR was increased by a factor of 2.6 over controls: mean(s.e.m.) values of 12.71(2.85) versus 4.87(0.41) cells/crypt/h (P less than 0.01), but defunction reduced this by 76 per cent to a mean(s.e.m.) value of 3.00(0.52) cells/crypt/h below that in the intact colon. In the left colon, 39-50 per cent of tumours were sited at the anastomosis. Compared with controls there were 77 per cent fewer tumours in defunctioned colon, but they still favoured the site of anastomosis. Neoplasms at the colostomy site accounted for 74-77 per cent of all right-sided tumours. Anastomosis and defunction have powerful but contrasting effects on colonic adaptation and carcinogenesis; when combined they tend to cancel each other out.\r"

This experimental study has investigated the effects of gastric operations on colonic cell proliferation, bile acid excretion and carcinogenesis. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 105) underwent sham operation, Polya partial gastrectomy or vagotomy and pyloroplasty. The carcinogen azoxymethane was administered weekly for 6 weeks thereafter (total dose 60 mg kg-1). When the animals were killed 24 weeks after operation, colons were examined for mucosal mass, crypt cell production rate (CCPR) and tumour yield; faeces were assayed for contents of neutral steroids and bile acids (both total and individual). Morphometric indices and mucosal DNA content were similar in all three groups. Polya gastrectomy reduced: (1) CCPR throughout the colon (by 42-65 per cent, P less than 0.002); (2) the number of rats with colorectal tumours (26 per cent versus 63 per cent, P less than 0.05); (3) faecal levels of neutral steroids and bile acids, notably hyodeoxycholic acid (P less than 0.01). Although vagotomy and pyloroplasty increased caecal CCPR, there were no consistent differences in faecal steroids and no alteration in tumour yield after the operation. These results fail to support clinical studies suggesting that gastric surgery predisposes to colonic carcinogenesis. Indeed, Polya partial gastrectomy exerts a protective effect, probably by inhibiting colonic cell proliferation.\r"

Thermographic resolution (Th) and the difference in temperature between the tumour and a similar zone in the contralateral breast (delta 2) were compared. Thermograms were class Th1 (with a similar thermal pattern in both breasts without hypervascularization or hot points) and Th2 (with hypervascularization or a hot area with a thermal difference with the same area in the opposite breast (delta 2) of less than 2 degrees C) in most (95.7 per cent) of the patients with fibroadenoma and were class Th5 (having one or more pathological sign) in 85 per cent of the patients with phylloides tumours. Patients with phylloides tumours had a mean delta 2 of 2.99 degrees C whereas most of the patients with a fibroadenoma showed no difference in temperature. Their mean delta 2 was 0.2 degrees C (P less than 0.0005). We conclude that thermography helps in differential diagnosis between a fibroadenoma and a phylloides tumour.\r"

We examined the influence of glucagon on whole body and forearm muscle protein kinetics, determined by L-[1-13C, 15N]leucine, in two matched groups of healthy fasting subjects. In one study somatostatin alone was infused continuously (0.12 mg h-1) and in another with glucagon (0.04 mg h-1) to generate insulin resistance. Somatostatin infusion increased leucine oxidation (P less than 0.05) and reduced the negative protein balance (P less than 0.01) across the forearm; the 15 per cent decrease in protein breakdown was not significant. Whole body leucine kinetics showed increased flux (P less than 0.05) and synthesis (P less than 0.01) but reduced oxidation (P less than 0.05). Hyperglucagonaemia caused a threefold enhancement of leucine oxidation (P less than 0.02), while the negative protein balance further increased (P less than 0.05) across the forearm. Whole body leucine flux was unchanged; oxidation increased (P less than 0.01) and synthesis decreased (P less than 0.01). These studies confirm that physiological hyperglucagonaemia during insulin resistance is catabolic in the short-term and indicates, for the first time, that glucagon may influence muscle protein metabolism acutely in man. We suggest that therapeutic manoeuvres designed to reduce glucagon levels after surgery may ameliorate protein kinetic abnormalities.\r"

Percutaneous muscle biopsies were taken and protein synthesis was determined from the total concentration and size distribution of ribosomes. The subjective feeling of fatigue was estimated using a visual analogue scale. The nitrogen balance was calculated at 20 days following surgery. The mean (s.e.m.) total concentration of ribosomes per milligram of DNA decreased by 27.5(6.6) per cent (P less than 0.01), 44.5(6.5) per cent (P less than 0.001), 48.3(8.9) per cent (P less than 0.001) and 45.0(8.2) per cent (P less than 0.01) on days 3, 10, 20 and 30, respectively. By 30 days after surgery no sign of restoration of normality was seen. The relative proportion of polyribosomes had decreased by 20.4(6.4) per cent (P less than 0.05) on the third postoperative day and by 20.4(3.9) per cent (P less than 0.01) on the tenth postoperative day and was restored to the preoperative level by day 20. The subjective fatigue score increased after operation and five of nine patients had not regained their preoperative scores 30 days after surgery. The daily nitrogen balance was negative for 5 days. The cumulated nitrogen losses were not restored until after 18 days following surgery. Elective abdominal surgery caused a sustained depression of protein synthesis for over 30 days, a longer period than previously presumed. These results show that long-term follow-up is required when the effect of different postoperative nutritional regimens are to be evaluated.\r"

In contrast with normal rectum, the ileal pouch exhibited pronounced motility, and pouch contractions were frequent even at a high distension pressure. The presence of high pressure motility was associated with a poor functional outcome. The threshold pressure and threshold volume for eliciting first sensation of filling and urge to defaecate were significantly higher in the ileal pouch. The pressure threshold levels were not related to the functional outcome. Sphincter inhibition on pouch distension reappeared in 25 per cent of the patients. The distension pressure required to elicit the inhibition was considerably higher than in the control subjects. The functional result was similar irrespective of whether sphincter inhibition was present or not. The motor and sensory function of this artificial setting appear to be controlled by nervous mechanisms that are different from those in the healthy anorectum.\r"

Clinical history and physical examination suggested cardiac complications in nine patients (17 per cent). Electrocardiogram was abnormal, but usually not diagnostic, in 17 (31 per cent). Routine two dimensional Doppler echocardiography revealed abnormalities in 17 (31 per cent). Ten patients (19 per cent) had valvular or septal defects. Other abnormalities included pericardial effusion, ventricular and septal dysfunction, and ventricular dilatation. Although it is impossible to determine how many of these abnormalities were post-traumatic, it seems that the incidence of late sequelae of cardiac injuries is high, and it is recommended that routine late follow-up of these patients should be done. Assessment should include routine echocardiograms.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-four patients have undergone abdominocervical oesophagectomy for oesophageal carcinoma as an alternative to a conventional transthoracic approach. Their median age was 69 years, with a range of 38-90 years, and 39 per cent of patients had chronic cardiorespiratory disease. Lymph node metastases were found in 80 per cent of patients and transmural tumour spread in 91 per cent. Median duration of operation was 2.2 h (range 1.75-6.0 h), and median transfusion requirement was 2.5 units (range 0-8 units). Respiratory complications were common (41 per cent) and caused all six postoperative deaths (11 per cent). Other complications were atrial fibrillation (26 per cent), transient recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (11 per cent), cardiac failure (2 per cent), stroke (2 per cent), subphrenic abscess (2 per cent) and empyema (2 per cent). There were two anastomotic leaks (4 per cent), clinically manifest as temporary salivary fistulae. There have been 32 deaths from recurrent carcinoma, with a median duration of survival of 14 months (range 4-53 months). Fifteen patients are still alive, with a median survival of 16.5 months (range 3-49 months); the current 3-year survival rate is 10 per cent. All patients resumed normal swallowing after operation, but 11 of them developed anastomotic strictures requiring a median of three dilatations. Avoidance of formal thoracotomy by the abdominocervical approach may allow more rapid oesophagectomy without increasing the risk of postoperative death and gives a quality of palliation at least equivalent to that of conventional transthoracic oesophageal excision.\r"
