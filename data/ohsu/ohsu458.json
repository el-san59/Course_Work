The mechanism of genetic transfer of this archaebacterium was studied by using the immobile plasmids pHV2 and pHV11 as cytoplasmic markers. It was found that the cytoplasms of the parental types do not mix during the mating process, that each parental type can serve both as a donor and as a recipient, and that cytoplasmic bridges, with dimensions of up to 2 micrometers long and 0.1 micrometer in diameter, were formed between the parental types. These bridges appear to be used for the transfer of DNA from one cell to another. If so, this archaebacterial mating system is different from both eubacterial conjugation and eukaryotic sexual cell fusion.\r"

They were divided into two comparable groups--one receiving pethidine and the other epidural analgesia. Both groups had much the same temperatures at the beginning of labour and before any analgesic administration. The mean temperature in the pethidine group remained constant during labour, whereas in the epidural analgesia group it showed a significant rise after only 6 hours of labour. This rise was not related to any clinical evidence of infection. Patients receiving epidural analgesia during labour are at increased risk of developing pyrexia. This pyrexia may be the result of vascular and thermoregulatory modifications induced by epidural analgesia.\r"

  ".W": "Radioisotope penile plethysmography is a nuclear medicine technique which assists in the evaluation of patients with erectile dysfunction. This technique attempts to noninvasively quantitate penile corpora cavernosal blood flow during early penile tumescence using technetium-99m-labeled red blood cells. Penile images and counts were acquired in a steady-state blood-pool phase prior to and after the administration of intracorporal papaverine. Penile counts, images, and time-activity curves were computer analyzed in order to determine peak corporal flow and volume changes. Peak corporal flow rates were compared to arterial integrity (determined by angiography) and venosinusoidal corporal leak (determined by cavernosometry). Peak corporal flow correlated well with arterial integrity (r = 0.91) but did not correlate with venosinusoidal leak parameters (r = 0.01). This report focuses on the methodology and the assumptions which form the foundation of this technique. The strong correlation of peak corporal flow and angiography suggests that radioisotope penile plethysmography could prove useful in the evaluation of arterial inflow disorders in patients with erectile dysfunction.\r"

Previously published standards either were based on small samples, data several decades old or characteristics of subpopulations in the United States or they were not specific for type of birth and sex. We compared the data for live births in 1972 with those in 1986 to develop current Canadian standards for type of birth (singleton or twin) and sex. We found that the 10th, 50th and 90th percentile figures for weight were slightly higher in 1986 than in 1972 for term deliveries (at 37 weeks' gestation or later), but the figures were virtually unchanged for preterm deliveries. The availability of reliable population-based standards should enhance the clinician's ability to identify true cases of retardation or acceleration of intrauterine growth.\r"

We reviewed our experience with 100 consecutive patients, all of whom had 5-year follow-up, to see if this held true for head and neck cancer. The detailed report covers site and stage. In summary, however, the recurrence rate for all cancers of the larynx was 14% for those who did not receive blood and 65% for those who did. For cancer of the oral cavity, pharynx, and nose or sinus, the recurrence rate was 31% without transfusions and 71% with transfusions. It would appear that the use of blood transfusions somehow adversely affects the patient's survival. Further study needs to be done to elucidate the mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "Cigarette smoking has been causally linked to atherosclerotic heart disease. The mechanism by which cigarette smoking causes heart disease has not, however, been determined. Nicotine has been shown to lead to increases in plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine following smoking. Catecholamines have been shown to lead to increases in blood glucose. This paper demonstrates that cigarette smoking is associated with increases in average blood glucose as measured by glycosylated hemoglobin levels in smokers compared with nonsmokers. Fifteen nondiabetic smokers had an average glycosylated hemoglobin of 6.82% (SD = 1.06%), which is higher than the 5.63% (SD = .49%, t = 3.98, P less than .001) found for 23 nonsmokers. The average glycosylated hemoglobin level of the smokers is in the range found for patients with well-controlled diabetes. These data suggest that elevated blood glucose may contribute to atherogenesis in cigarette smokers.\r"

Twenty-three healthy volunteers, 9 men and 14 women, with an age range of 19-28 yr, were studied. After an overnight fast, the subjects ingested 10 g of lactulose in 150 ml of water while breath hydrogen concentrations were analyzed at 15-min intervals. On separate days, in random sequence, subjects either sat in a chair or walked on a treadmill for 60 min. Mean transit time was 55 +/- 8 min when resting and 89 +/- 4 min when exercising (p less than 0.001). In conclusion, light aerobic exercise prolonged the mouth-to-cecum transit time. On the basis of this observation, exercise as a causative factor in runner's diarrhea and its value in the management of chronic constipation may be questioned.\r"

Twenty-two patients were missing the ipsilateral renal unit. Contralateral abnormalities occurred in seven (33%) of these 22 patients also. The absence of the vas deferens is a significant anomaly, and examination for the presence of the ipsilateral renal unit is mandatory.\r"

Our report summarizes the theoretical and experimental considerations, including the hemodynamic effects and biologic behavior of the graft, associated with this technique. We present a detailed review of the literature regarding the clinical efficacy of patch angioplasty in carotid endarterectomy, including the early results, the late results, and the incidence and nature of carotid restenosis. We address concerns about the use of patch angioplasty, including the duration of cross-clamping, potential problems with the graft and suture-line disruption, and graft atherogenesis. We conclude that most recent literature indicates that patch angioplasty decreases acute complications (notably carotid occlusion) after carotid endarterectomy and prevents or delays carotid restenosis. As pressure increases to achieve a minimal rate of perioperative morbidity, many surgeons are expected to adopt patch angioplasty in more of their cases. However, in the absence of conclusive results from a prospective randomized study, opinion will continue to be divided regarding the routine versus the selective use of patch grafting in carotid endarterectomy. We present criteria for randomized trials of this technique.\r"

In a summary of current practices affecting the care of dying patients, we give particular emphasis to changes that have become commonplace since the early 1980s. Implementation of accepted policies has been deficient in certain areas, including the initiation of timely discussions with patients about dying, the solicitation and execution in advance of their directives for terminal care, the education of medical students and residents, and the formulation of institutional guidelines. The appropriate and, if necessary, aggressive use of pain-relieving substances is recommended, even when such use may result in shortened life. We emphasize the value of a sensitive approach to care--one that is adjusted continually to suit the changing needs of the patient as death approaches. Possible settings for death are reviewed, including the home, the hospital, the intensive care unit, and the nursing home. Finally, we consider the physician's response to the dying patient who is rational and desires suicide or euthanasia.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of oral pentoxifylline, administered 1,200 mg/day (400 mg slow-release tablets tid) through six weeks, was studied in 10 patients with established deep venous incompetence and persisting venous ulcers. The following parameters were used for verification of the therapeutic result: venous patency (VP) and valvular competence (VC) assessed by means of Doppler ultrasound; venous refilling time (VRT) assessed by photoplethysmography; skin blood flow (SBF) at rest and after tiptoeing exercise, as well as skin perfusion pressure (SPP), both assessed by means of 99mtechnetium clearance technique. Finally, photo documentation of the tissue lesion was obtained, using a two-dimensional (max and min diameter = Dmax, Dmin) metered scale photo. There was an overall good response to the treatment, the studied parameters showing the following changes: VP and VC remained unchanged; VRT improved in 8 patients, SBF increased in 10; SPP slightly improved in 5; and Dmax and Dmin in all 10 patients. Removal or substantial diminution of the ulcers was obtained in 8 patients. These findings indicate that oral administration of pentoxifylline over a period of six weeks supports the conservative treatment and improves considerably the condition of patients with persisting venous ulcers.\r"

Ten (32%) of the patients had elevated CA 125, one (4%) had elevated CEA, and none had elevated CA 15-3, AFP or beta 2-microglobulin. Compared to patients with normal CA 125, patients with elevated CA 125 were older, more often users of intrauterine contraceptive devices, had longer duration of symptoms, higher erythrocyte sedimentation rates, and more often had an adnexal mass on pelvic examination. There was a correlation between CA 125 levels and the severity of adnexal inflammation as defined by laparoscopy. Isolation of specific micro-organisms from the upper genital tract was not associated with elevated CA 125. In most women serum levels of CA 125 decreased during treatment. PID should be considered as a major cause of positive CA 125 findings among young women.\r"

  ".W": "To assess whether a rigorous clinical classification, based on computerised tomography, of patients with cerebral ischaemia would identify subgroups at higher or lower risk with respect to cigarette smoking habits, a case-control study was carried out on 422 cases of first-episode cerebral ischaemia matched for age and sex with 422 community-based neighbourhood controls. Patients with ischaemic stroke due to extracranial or intracranial vascular disease were at higher risk from smoking than has previously been reported for stroke (relative risk 5.7, 95% confidence interval 2.8, 12.0) whereas those with stroke due to cardiac emboli had no excess risk associated with smoking (relative risk 0.4 [0.1, 1.8]). After cessation of smoking, the relative risk declined gradually over 10 years, at the end of which time a significant risk was still evident. This finding may imply that the risk incurred by smoking is due mainly to atheroma formation, rather than transient haematological effects. Exposure to smoking by a spouse was an independent risk factor for the whole group of cerebral ischaemia patients (relative risk 1.7 [1.1, 2.6]), but this was not so for smoking by either parent (relative risk 1.2 [0.8, 1.8]). These findings suggest that smoking is a more potent risk factor for the most common form of ischaemic stroke than has previously been appreciated. The persistent nature of the risk even after cessation of smoking and the possible risk associated with passive exposure strengthens public health arguments against smoking.\r"

Four of these patients had multiple lesions, and three patients with lesions had no neurologic symptoms. The findings suggest an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance in this unique case of familial cerebral arteriovenous malformation.\r"

Best corrected acuity was at least 20/20 in 90% of eyes before surgery. At five years, 85% retained at least 20/20 best corrected acuity. Although some patients still have shown refractive and visual acuity changes through five years after surgery, the overall group has been stable.\r"

To determine its presence or absence in the lungs of patients with asthma, we examined lung tissue obtained at autopsy or lobectomy from five patients with asthma and nine without asthma. The avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex technique was used to stain tissue for immunoreactivity to VIP. At least 80 tissue sections from each patient were examined microscopically; the airway diameter ranged from 100 microns to 1.2 cm. Immunoreactive VIP was seen within nerves in more than 92 percent of the sections from the lungs of patients without asthma. No VIP was seen in any of 468 sections we could evaluate that were obtained from the lungs of patients with asthma. As a control for the nonspecific destruction of neuropeptides, immunostaining for substance P was also carried out. Abundant amounts of this neuropeptide were seen within nerves in tissue from the lungs of all patients. We conclude that in patients with asthma there is a loss of VIP from the pulmonary nerve fibers that may diminish neurogenically mediated bronchodilation. Whether this loss is a cause or a result of asthma is unclear.\r"

  ".W": "The static elastic properties of arterial tree (abdominal aorta and common carotid artery) were studied in 19 normal subjects and in 49 patients with myocardial infarction with an ultrasonic phase-locked echo-tracking system that allows continuous transcutaneous measurement of the arterial diameter. The stiffness index beta, which represented the mechanical properties in the arterial wall, was calculated from the relation between systemic blood pressure and the diameter of the artery. Patients with myocardial infarction underwent coronary angiography in their convalescent period to determine involved vessels. In 11 patients, coronary artery was patent; 15 patients had one-vessel disease, 12 had two-vessel disease, and the remaining 11 patients had three-vessel disease. In normal subjects, increasing age was associated with an increase in arterial stiffness. An average value of the stiffness index of the abdominal aorta was 8.58 +/- 3.02 (mean +/- SD) and that of common carotid artery was 9.17 +/- 2.22. In patients with three-vessel disease, these values were significantly higher (22.37 +/- 4.29 in abdominal aorta and 13.17 +/- 4.56 in common carotid artery) than those in normal subjects. Stiffness index of patients with two- or one-vessel disease was also increased but lower than those in patients with three-vessel disease (p less than 0.05). Forty-four of 49 patients with infarction had an arterial stiffness index of abdominal aorta higher than the 95% confidence limits of the normal data (p less than 0.05). Twenty-eight patients were outside the nomogram of common carotid artery (p less than 0.05). The mechanical properties of these elastic arteries provided sufficiently reliable information on changes caused by atherosclerosis.\r"

The diagnosis of stroke and the type of stroke were obtained from death certificates. Using proportional-hazards regression to control for age, cigarette smoking, diastolic blood pressure, and race or ethnic group, we found that the six-year risk of death from intracranial hemorrhage (International Classification of Diseases, ninth edition [ICD-9], categories 431 and 432) was three times higher in men with serum cholesterol levels under 4.14 mmol per liter (160 mg per deciliter) than in those with higher cholesterol levels (P = 0.05 by omnibus test across five cholesterol levels). On the other hand, a positive association was observed between the serum cholesterol level and death from nonhemorrhagic stroke (P = 0.007). The inverse association of the serum cholesterol level with the risk of death from intracranial hemorrhage was confined to men with diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg, in whom death from intracranial hemorrhage is relatively common. We conclude that there is an inverse relation between the serum cholesterol level and the risk of death from hemorrhagic stroke in middle-aged American men, but that its public health impact is overwhelmed by the positive association of higher serum cholesterol levels with death from nonhemorrhagic stroke and total cardiovascular disease (ICD-9 categories 390 through 459).\r"

Decision analysis is a new mathematical tool that allows physicians to compare options in such patients. With the use of a simple office computer, a software program was devised to compare surgical versus conservative options in a hypothetical 25-year-old man. The computer model weighs the important considerations of patient age, mortality and morbidity rates of the physician performing the surgery, rebleeding from the arteriovenous malformation, and patient desires, using the Markov process. When mortality and morbidity rates are reasonable, the mathematical process supports surgical intervention in the hypothetical patient. Patient guidelines for older patients and future plans for the model using grading systems are discussed.\r"

Its purposes were to determine the specialty interests of the 1987 cohort as these 11,264 students proceeded through medical school and to compare their evolving specialty plans with those of the 10,321 US medical school seniors in 1983. As the 1987 cohort advanced through medical school, they became increasingly interested in general and subspecialty internal medicine, psychiatry, obstetrics and gynecology, anesthesia, radiology and rehabilitation medicine and less interested in family practice, general surgery, pathology, and public health. Compared with the 1983 cohort, 1987 seniors were significantly less likely to choose general internal medicine and more likely to choose internal medicine and pediatric subspecialties. Similar proportions of each cohort of seniors chose family practice. Between 1983 and 1987, men's interest in pediatrics, general surgery, and obstetrics and gynecology declined, while their interest in the surgical subspecialties, anesthesia, and rehabilitation medicine increased.\r"

Preterm labor in singleton and twin gestations was preceded by significant increases in pre-labor contraction frequency (P less than .01). However, in triplets, preterm labor was not preceded by increased pre-labor contractions. Triplet and twin gestations with term labor were associated with higher baseline contraction frequencies than were high-risk singleton gestations with term labor (P less than .05). Fetal number had no impact on pre-labor contraction intensity, although triplet gestations had a significantly greater proportion of uterine activity occupied by low-amplitude, high-frequency contractility.\r"

  ".W": "Six patients with chronic relapsing diarrhoea caused by Clostridium difficile were treated with rectal instillation of homologous faeces (one patient) or a mixture of ten different facultatively aerobic and anaerobic bacteria diluted in sterile saline (five patients). The mixture led to a prompt loss of Cl difficile and its toxin from the stools and to bowel colonisation by Bacteroides sp, which had not been present in pre-treatment stool samples. Strains of Escherichia coli, Cl bifermentans, and Peptostreptococcus productus in the mixture inhibited the in-vitro growth of Cl difficile, which in turn inhibited the growth of Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides vulgatus, and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. The finding that Bacteroides sp had been absent during the patients' illness but was present after recovery suggests that the absence of Bacteroides sp may result in chronic relapsing Cl difficile diarrhoea, and that its presence may prevent colonisation by Cl difficile.\r"

SETTING: Large metropolitan hospital where 20% of all patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in Los Angeles are treated. PATIENTS: Twenty-six inpatients with bronchoscopy-proven Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and AIDS. Outpatients included 10 persons seropositive for HIV, 10 with AIDS-related complex, and 10 with AIDS. MAIN RESULTS: There were 19 survivors and 7 nonsurvivors of P. carinii infection. Serum triiodothyronine (T3) values generally remained normal until hospitalization, with nonsurvivors having lower values than survivors (0.56 +/- 0.1 nmol/L compared with 1.3 +/- 0.1 nmol/L, P less than 0.002, respectively). Reverse triiodothyronine (rT3) levels were low in persons with AIDS-related complex (0.21 +/- 0.02 nmol/L, P less than 0.001) and in AIDS outpatients (0.17 +/- 0.02 nmol/L, P less than 0.001). Normalization of rT3 occurred after patients were hospitalized (0.28 +/- 0.01 nmol/L). Serum thyroxine-binding globulin values rose with progression of HIV infection (seropositive, 369.7 +/- 18.1 nmol/L, P less than 0.005; AIDS-related complex, 419.1 +/- 37.0 nmol/L, P less than 0.005; AIDS, 423.3 +/- 31.9 nmol/L, P less than 0.005; survivors, 476.3 +/- 24.6 nmol/L, P less than 0.001), whereas nonsurvivors had normal values. All values are compared with normal values (T3, 2.3 +/- 0.04 nmol/L; rT3, 0.28 +/- 0.01 nmol/L; thyroxine-binding globulin, 288.2 +/- 6.9 nmol/L). CONCLUSIONS: Infection with HIV produces unique alterations in thyroid function. A progressive decline in rT3 and elevation in thyroxine-binding globulin accompany advancing HIV infection. The persistence of a normal T3 despite progression of HIV infection may contribute to weight loss. A low serum T3 on admission correlates with mortality.\r"

Membranes purified from animals with histologically confirmed acute hepatitis, active or persistent chronic hepatitis and the virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma were evaluated for the virus surface antigen contents, treated with agents eluting plasma membrane-bound antigen to test the extent of the antigen-membrane associations and incubated with purified, particulate woodchuck hepatitis virus surface antigen to determine membrane potential for the antigen adsorption. Hepatocyte plasma membranes originating from woodchucks chronically infected with the virus showed the highest quantities of the incorporated virus surface antigen among membranes studied, the behavior of bound antigen as an integral and a peripheral membrane protein and the resistance to bind an exogenous antigen. Similar properties were expressed by plasma membranes prepared from hepatocytes of nontumor parenchyma displaying chronic active hepatitis of a woodchuck hepatitis virus carrier with hepatoma. Furthermore, plasma membranes originating from animals with active or persistent chronic hepatitis demonstrated identical properties, implicating that histologic activity of the chronic liver inflammatory process is not dependent on the quantity of the virus surface antigen insertion into the membrane. In contrast, hepatocyte plasma membranes from animals with acute hepatitis showed significantly lower antigen quantities, presence of the antigen specificity exclusively behaving as an integral membrane protein and noticeable ability to bind an exogenous surface antigen of the virus. Comparable, but not identical, features were observed for hepatocyte membranes purified from nodules of hepatocellular carcinoma, suggesting that neoplastic transformation of infected hepatocytes is associated with loss of the membrane-bound antigen and with simultaneous, partial recovery of the membrane potential for the antigen binding. Comparative analysis of the properties on the woodchuck hepatitis virus surface antigen incorporation into hepatocyte plasma membranes in studied cases indicated that sustained infection with woodchuck hepatitis virus leads to an increase in the quantity of the membrane-incorporated antigen and to the appearance of the virus surface antigen specificity behaving as a peripheral membrane protein. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the extent and the character of the antigen interaction with hepatocyte plasma membranes undergoes significant variations in the natural course of hepadna viral infect\r"

To investigate further the association between noncircumcision and urinary tract infections, a case-control study was performed of infant boys who had a catheterized or suprapubic urine culture done as part of an acute illness visit. Cases (n = 36) were those infants who had a positive culture (greater than 105 organisms per milliliter); controls (n = 76) had a negative culture (less than 103 organisms per milliliter). There were no significant differences found in the two groups in age, ethnic group, and type of medical insurance. All of the cases were uncircumcised, vs 32% of controls. The data were analyzed separately by age, ethnic group, type of insurance, and method of culture, and in all groups the cases were significantly more likely to be uncircumcised. Of the 31 cases who underwent roentgenographic investigations, 8 had abnormal findings. Noncircumcision seems to be a highly significant risk factor for urinary tract infection in infants up to 12 months of age, affects infants regardless of race and socioeconomic status, and is associated with anatomic abnormalities in 26% of cases.\r"

To investigate the effect of dietary potassium restriction on blood pressure, we used a randomized crossover design to study 10 healthy, normotensive men randomly assigned to isocaloric diets (each lasting nine days) providing either low (10 mmol per day) or normal (90 mmol per day) amounts of potassium, while sodium intake was maintained at the subjects' usual levels (120 to 200 mmol per day). With the low-potassium diet, plasma potassium levels declined from 3.8 to 3.2 mmol per liter (P less than 0.001), but plasma sodium and chloride levels were unchanged. The average daily excretion of urinary sodium (+/- SEM) on the low-potassium diet was significantly lower than that with the normal-potassium diet (10 +/- 10 vs. 144 +/- 10 mmol; P less than 0.001). The mean arterial pressure did not change significantly during normal potassium intake, but it increased over the nine days of the low-potassium diet from 90.9 +/- 2.2 to 95.0 +/- 2.2 mm Hg (P less than 0.05). Both mean arterial (P less than 0.01) and diastolic (P less than 0.005) pressures were significantly higher after the low-potassium diet than after the normal-potassium diet. Potassium depletion suppressed plasma aldosterone levels but had no effect on plasma renin activity or on arginine vasopressin or catecholamine levels. A saline infusion further increased the mean arterial pressure in the potassium-depleted subjects but had no effect in the control group (P less than 0.05). We conclude that short-term potassium depletion increases blood pressure in healthy, normotensive men and permits further increases in blood pressure after saline loading. We found no evidence that the hypertensive effect of potassium depletion resulted from changes in either renal hemodynamics or circulating levels of vasoactive hormones.\r"

At present time, blepharoplasty in the Oriental eye is the most common aesthetic procedure performed in Korea and Japan. The objective should not be the caucasianization of the Oriental eye, where desired modifications are usually quite subtle. Generally, patients prefer more defined and invaginated folds, but not necessarily a very high fold, since the latter will often look unnatural or overdone in the Oriental face. We have found several different types of eyelids in the Oriental population. The purpose of this presentation is to present our nonincision technique to create aesthetically pleasing supratarsal folds. Seven-hundred and sixty-two patients were reviewed. We have found that our single-suture method is very reliable and allows the construction of a more even, smooth, and symmetrical fold.\r"

All of the patients were female, and their mean age at the time of diagnosis was 57.4 +/- 11 (SD) (range 47 to 71) years. They had received NSAIDs for an average of 6.9 +/- 6.4 (range, 3 to 18) months before developing proteinuria. The presenting 24-hour urine protein was 11.3 +/- 10.2 (range, 2.1 to 24) g and all patients were hypoalbuminemic (serum albumin less than 3.5 g/dL) with edema. Two patients presented with acute renal insufficiency (serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.3 mg/dL). Histologically, three patients had MCG associated with interstitial nephritis, and two had no evidence of interstitial disease. All five patients achieved a complete remission after discontinuing the NSAIDs. The remission occurred within 15 days for 80% of patients. A mean follow-up of 6.4 +/- 3.9 (range, 1.3 to 10.5) years was obtained on the patients. At the time of last follow-up, all patients had remained in complete remission, and all patients had normal renal function. Our experience confirms that MCG may present with or without interstitial nephritis. Once the NSAID is discontinued, a complete remission can be expected.\r"

Sixty-seven percent (8 of the 12 eyes) not receiving an implant achieved this level. The authors' results and current literature suggest that absolute control, preoperatively and postoperatively, of all uveitis inflammation and careful selection of patients as lens implant candidates are crucial for successful cataract surgery in uveitis patients. Complete removal of lens cortex and placement of an all-PMMA posterior chamber lens within the capsular bag are also believed to be important.\r"

Decompression procedures were attempted in 31 instances of sigmoid volvulus in 27 patients and were successful 25 times (81 percent). Seven patients with sigmoid volvulus did not undergo surgery and of those, two died of unrelated causes, one was lost to follow-up, one was well, and three had recurrent volvulus. Twenty-four operations were performed on 23 patients and there were three deaths (13 percent mortality). There was one recurrence in two patients who underwent simple detorsion. Chronic large-bowel motility disturbances were a persistent problem in 9 of 20 (45 percent) surgical survivors. Among 27 instances of cecal volvulus, one was reduced by contrast enema and ten endoscopic attempts at decompression were unsuccessful. Twenty-six operations were done and there were four operative deaths (15 percent mortality). There were no recurrences. Large-bowel motility disorders were noted in follow-up in 3 of 22 patients (14 percent). Overall there were 10 deaths in 58 patients for a 17 percent mortality rate. These data support the importance of endoscopic decompression for sigmoid volvulus but not for cecal volvulus. Definitive treatment of both forms of volvulus should include assessment of colonic motility.\r"

Neurological and neuropsychological abnormalities differentiated the groups, with the high violence group evidencing more abnormalities than the other two groups in the area of integrative sensory and motor functions.

  ".U": "89314097\r", 
  ".W": "Osteitis fibrosa, a frequent complication of chronic renal failure, is characterized by increased rates of bone formation and bone resorption due to increased secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Effective treatment with oral calcitriol is often impossible in patients with osteitis fibrosa, because low doses may cause hypercalcemia. Because short-term infusions of intravenous calcitriol are capable of suppressing the secretion of parathyroid hormone in patients with uremia without causing hypercalcemia, we evaluated the effectiveness of long-term intermittent calcitriol infusions (1.0 to 2.5 micrograms three times weekly, during dialysis) in treating severe osteitis fibrosa in 12 consecutive patients on hemodialysis whose disease was refractory to conventional therapy. After a mean (+/- SE) treatment period of 11.5 +/- 1.4 months, the mean bone-formation rate declined from 1642 +/- 277 to 676 +/- 106 microns 2 per square millimeter per day (P less than 0.01) in the 11 patients who successfully completed the study. Similar reductions occurred in the osteoblastic osteoid (18 +/- 3 to 9 +/- 2 percent; P less than 0.01) and the degree of marrow fibrosis (6.2 +/- 1.7 to 3.5 +/- 1.3 percent; P = 0.01). Concomitant serum biochemical changes included increased calcium levels (2.55 +/- 0.03 to 2.67 +/- 0.05 mmol per liter; P less than 0.01), decreased alkaline phosphatase levels (489 +/- 77 to 184 +/- 32 U per liter; P less than 0.001), and decreased levels of PTH (amino-terminal, 172 +/- 34 to 69 +/- 16 ng per liter in five patients, P less than 0.03; and carboxy-terminal, 1468 +/- 467 to 1083 +/- 402 ml-eq per liter in six patients, P not significant). Although the majority of the patients had transient episodes of asymptomatic hypercalcemia, this complication could be quickly reversed by temporarily halting treatment or decreasing the dose of calcitriol. We conclude that long-term intermittent infusions of intravenous calcitriol are effective in ameliorating osteitis fibrosa in patients on dialysis. Patients whose osteitis fibrosa is refractory to oral calcitriol and who are candidates for parathyroidectomy should be considered first for intravenous calcitriol therapy.\r"

Our analysis reveals that (1) some specialties are heavily overrepresented in the surplus-lines pool, (2) physicians aged 45 to 54 years are also overrepresented, (3) board certification is seen as frequently in the surplus-lines group as in the US physician population, and (4) the percentage of foreign medical graduates in the surplus-lines pool is virtually the same as that in the US physician population. A model of the actuarial process by which claims data can lead to termination of standard coverage suggests that disproportionate representation of high-risk specialties is not simply a function of a high average claims rate. We also show that, in contrast to joint underwriting associations, surplus-lines companies impose high premiums, large deductibles, and restrictions on practice, all of which are likely to reduce the frequency of negligent behavior.\r"

At 20 days following implantation of the device, extracellular concentrations of dopamine within the striatum reached micromolar levels, over 200-fold greater than control values. Release of dopamine was shown to be stable and maintained for the 2-month duration of the experiment. Histological examination confirmed the biocompatible nature of the implant.

Recent research has shown prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors to be effective in relieving the pain associated with ureteral colic. Our prospective, controlled, double-blind, randomized study was designed to test the efficacy of indomethacin in the prophylactic treatment of pain after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. Patients undergoing extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy were randomized into 2 groups. Group 1 received 100 mg. indomethacin suppositories twice daily and group 2 received placebo suppositories. After extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy 2 analgesics were available to the patients: oral co-dydramol or intramuscular pethidine was offered in the normal manner by the nursing staff. The pre-extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy x-ray was used to make a quantitative estimate of the total stone burden in each patient. The post-extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy analgesic requirement was used to compare the 2 groups. Of 112 patients recruited to the study 55 received indomethacin and 57 received placebo. The request for analgesia in the 2 groups was not different (28 of 55 and 33 of 57, respectively). However, in the indomethacin group only 6 patients required pethidine (10 doses), compared to 18 (41 doses) in the placebo group. This difference is statistically significant (p less than 0.01). There was no difference between the 2 groups in the occurrence of ureteral steinstrasse. Indomethacin has been shown to be effective in the prophylactic treatment of ureteral colic after lithotripsy.\r"

It is believed that, left unchecked, a subgroup of patients with panic attacks will consistently develop agoraphobia. However, to date, there are no means for early identification of this at-risk group. This study analyzed patients with panic attacks and phobic avoidance behaviors by using population-based, survey-collected data. Path analysis was used to determine relations among panic symptoms, phobic behaviors, panic-phobic lag times, and measures of pervasiveness and severity of fears and panic. Panic-related chest pain, dyspnea, trembling, and fear were important factors in the development, pervasiveness, and severity of situational fears and anticipatory anxiety. However, full-blown agoraphobia was only related to the presence of anticipatory anxiety and the pervasiveness of phobic avoidance behaviors. Although the age-of-onset of panic and phobic avoidance was unrelated to other factors, lag times were dependent upon panic symptomatology and the presence of depression. These findings suggest that patients with panic attacks who are at risk for agoraphobia can be identified by the nature of their panic symptoms, and perhaps, through early treatment, the development of phobic avoidance can be averted.\r"

They were part of an early cohort of 39 children with non-B-cell, non-T-cell ALL without central nervous system (CNS) involvement, treated regardless of initial leukocyte count with intrathecal chemotherapy for CNS prophylaxis. Although the optic nerve is a known site of relapse in patients with systemic and meningeal ALL, it has not been reported to occur in otherwise relapse-free patients. Early diagnosis and treatment prevented blindness and allowed for long-term survival (57+, 49+, and 97+ months, respectively) and possibly cure. Since these patients were treated in a new manner and exhibited a new pattern of relapse, their clinical courses were reviewed. Features considered worrisome, but not diagnostic of CNS leukemia may be of greater import when intrathecal medications are utilized as primary CNS prophylaxis. An expanded definition of CNS leukemia may be necessary.\r"

Control subjects were siblings and age-matched, unrelated children. Serum zinc, copper, and measures of immune system competence were tested at 3- or 6-month intervals. Parents kept daily logs of clinical symptoms such as cough and diarrhea and of physician visits. Mean serum zinc concentrations increased to about 150% of baseline during zinc supplementation, but we found no effect on serum levels of copper, immunoglobulins, or complement; on lymphocyte number or subset distribution; or on in vitro response to mitogens. Children with Down syndrome who were receiving zinc had a trend toward fewer days or episodes of cough and fever but no change in other clinical variables. Long-term, low-dose oral zinc supplementation to improve depressed immune response or to decrease infections in children with Down syndrome cannot be recommended.\r"

SO2 was then measured in 350 patients in the recovery room after a variety of surgical and anaesthetic procedures. Only 1.1% of patients who received additional oxygen following general anaesthesia exhibited an SO2 below 90%, compared to 16.7% of similar cases who did not receive additional oxygen. Administration of additional oxygen raised the SO2 above 90% in all the latter cases. In only 55.3% of those who did not receive additional oxygen was the SO2 above 94%, compared to 86.7% of normal volunteers and 73.9% of patients who received additional oxygen. This study reiterates the need to administer supplemental oxygen to all patients in the recovery room, unless facilities are available to measure SO2.

Our study consisted of a 20-month retrospective review of 244 charts beginning January 1986. Twelve patients were excluded for drug overdose, family request, or unavailable data. Of the remaining 232 patients, 51 had a rhythm and pulse on arrival at the emergency department. The record of each of the remaining 181 patients was analyzed for age, sex, location, witness, CPR initiator, advanced life support unit response time, initial field rhythm, and initial ECG rhythm. Outcome alternatives were dead in emergency department or hospital admission. All hospitalized patients were further evaluated for survival to discharge and neurologic status at discharge. Ten of the 181 patients (6%) who failed prehospital resuscitation survived to hospitalization, and one (0.6%) was discharged neurologically intact. Survival to hospital admission did not correlate with any of the variables studied except gender. The one patient who survived a failed prehospital resuscitation was not endotracheally intubated in the field. Our data support the practice of pronouncing adult nontraumatic cardiac arrest victims who fail to respond to advanced cardiac life support efforts in the field as dead at the scene.\r"

  ".W": "During the first 6 months of legislatively mandated premarital testing for human immunodeficiency virus in Illinois, 8 of 70,846 applicants for marriage licenses were found to be seropositive, yielding a seroprevalence of 0.011%. The total cost of the testing program for 6 months is estimated at $2.5 million or $312,000 per seropositive individual identified. Half of the reported seropositive individuals reported a history of risk behavior. During the same period, the number of marriage licenses issued in Illinois decreased by 22.5%, while the number of licenses issued to Illinois residents in surrounding states increased significantly. We conclude that mandatory premarital testing is not a cost-effective method for the control of human immunodeficiency virus infection.\r"

Ten patients (24%) had severe and generalized intellectual dysfunction, while lesser or no cognitive impairment characterized the remaining patients. Degree of intellectual impairment was not related to neuromuscular status or sex. Patients with severe intellectual disturbance had significantly earlier onset of both myotonia and weakness and were more likely to inherit the disease from their mother. Magnetic resonance imaging findings indicated that while degree of cerebral atrophy was not related to severity of intellectual impairment, skull thickness, focal white matter lesions, and anterior temporal lobe abnormalities were significantly more common in patients with severely disturbed intellect. This study reports a number of previously unreported cerebral magnetic resonance imaging findings associated with intellectual impairment in myotonic dystrophy, but the etiology of these changes awaits neuropathologic examination.\r"

To remedy this, we propose a new advance care document: the Medical Directive. The Medical Directive delineates four paradigmatic scenarios, defined by prognosis and disability of incompetent patients. In each scenario, patients are to indicate their preferences regarding specific life-sustaining interventions. The Medical Directive also provides for the designation of a proxy to make decisions in circumstances where the patient's preferences are uncertain. Finally, there is a section for a statement of wishes regarding organ donation. The Medical Directive provides an opportunity for significant improvement in the documentation of patients' preferences regarding life-sustaining care in states of incompetence. As an expression of a patient's wishes, the Medical Directive should be honored by courts and should facilitate physician-patient discussions of critical and terminal care options.\r"

This prospective evaluation of cardiorespiratory pattern in 32 cocaine-exposed and 18 methadone-exposed infants was therefore performed to further evaluate the effects of intrauterine exposure. The two groups were similar in maternal age, race, and cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana use and in gestational age, sex, and birth weight. Apnea density and episodes of periodic breathing exceeded the 95th percentile for normal infants in 12 (38%) of 32 of cocaine-exposed infants vs only 1 (6%) of 18 opiate-exposed infants. Five cocaine-exposed but no opiate-exposed infants had apnea of infancy, and all 5 of these infants had an abnormal cardiorespiratory pattern. In all 13 infants with an abnormal cardiorespiratory pattern, theophylline treatment resulted in normalization of the respiratory pattern and was associated with absence of any (further) clinical events. In summary, infants prenatally exposed to cocaine have a higher incidence of cardiorespiratory pattern abnormalities than do infants with methadone or no prenatal drug exposure.\r"

Investigation revealed poor food-handling practices and illness among the kitchen staff. Elevated bacterial counts and Escherichia coli were found in 15 of 24 samples of food tested, and Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 2 pastry samples. Culture of 14 stool samples for bacteria yielded Clostridium perfringens in 1 sample from a staff member and coagulase-positive S. aureus in 2 samples from staff members and 3 from guests. All of the S. aureus isolates were nonenterotoxigenic and had three different phage patterns. Electron microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy revealed the prototype Norwalk virus in five (56%) of nine stool samples; four samples were from guests, and one was from a kitchen employee. The employee had had diarrhea 24 hours before the first outbreak and was thus believed to be the source of the virus infection, possibly through food handling. This is the first report of Norwalk virus isolation and the first of foodborne Norwalk virus transmission in Canada. A review of foodborne Norwalk virus infections is presented.\r"

There was a statistically significant difference in the change in IOP at 90 minutes when comparing coffee to tea (P = 0.003) and no significant difference for 30 and 60 minutes. Although there was a statistically significant difference in IOP at 90 minutes between coffee and tea drinkers, the change was not clinically significant.\r"

Two types of inflammation were observed: an acute inflammation resembling an infectious enterocolitis and a chronic inflammation. In idiopathic reactive arthritis both types of inflammation were equally present, whereas chronic inflammation predominated in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. In 32% of patients with chronic inflammation, the lesions particularly resembled early Crohn's disease. Repeat ileocolonscopy on 19 patients demonstrated a parallel evolution of joint symptoms and histologic lesions. All patients with acute inflammation went into clinical and histologic remission, whereas lesions persisted in patients with Crohn-like inflammation. In patients with chronic inflammation, remission and persistence were observed equally. This study identified a group of patients with seronegative spondylarthropathy which, even in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms, showed evidence of gut inflammation, probably inducing an increased gut permeability with transgression of the oral tolerance and absorption of provocative antigens into the circulation. It is also possible that both diseases reflect a common underlying process.\r"

Paradoxical sebaceous gland atrophy and down-sized hair follicles in psoriasis may be due to possible inhibiting effects of yet unidentified factors produced by the epidermal lesion.\r"

  ".W": "Critical care clinicians are often frustrated when blood pressure values derived via direct monitoring methods (i.e., arterial lines) do not \"correlate\" with values obtained via indirect methods (e.g., auscultatory). Precious time has been spent attempting to troubleshoot monitoring systems and ascertain why these discrepancies exist. Greater insight into the intricacies of blood pressure monitoring reveals that both direct and indirect methods are subject to many external and physiologic influences that have the ability to significantly affect the value ultimately accepted as the \"true\" blood pressure. Direct blood pressure monitoring is influenced by normal physiologic changes in the pressure pulse configuration as it travels to the periphery, as well as by properties of the external monitoring system. Indirect monitoring is also influenced by a variety of factors, and may be unreliable in the very clinical situations where it is used the most. Finally, the relationship between blood pressure and blood flow, particularly in critically ill patients, suggests that it is unreasonable to expect that pressures obtained by direct monitoring methods will be the same as those derived by indirect methods that are flow dependent.\r"

  ".W": "Hospitals' patterns of ancillary service use were examined to determine whether new technologies replace older, more outmoded technologies, and to explore the factors associated with adoption of newer services and abandonment of older services. Annual inpatient use of five pairs of ancillary services was measured for 1978 through 1980 at 63 hospitals in five regions. The diagnostic test pairs consisted of one well-established diagnostic test and one newer service that could largely substitute for the older one and included (1) oral cholecystogram and gallbladder ultrasound; (2) brain scan and computed tomographic head scan; (3) skull roentgenogram and brain scan; (4) bone survey and bone scan; and (5) blood type/cross and type/screen. Use of gallbladder ultrasound increased significantly after its adoption, with small decreases in the use of oral cholecystogram, its paired test. For the other newer tests examined, increased use was not accompanied by significantly decreased use of the paired older service. The strongest predictors of change in patterns of test use were hospital size, number of residencies, occupancy, urban location, and the proportion of specialists on staff. We conclude that diffusion of new diagnostic services occurs gradually and often without concomitant decrease in older, outmoded services; new services generally seem to complement rather than substitute for older ones. Larger hospitals with a greater teaching commitment make a faster transition to the use of new technologies and the abandonment of older ones.\r"

Fifty-three of these women were not taking prednisone at the time of conception. Disease activity was scored in 4 ways: global assessment, prednisone therapy, cumulative number of organ systems with abnormalities, and display of abnormalities of each organ system. No patient received prophylactic therapy to prevent disease exacerbation. Thrombocytopenia, proteinuria, and hypocomplementemia were the most common abnormalities and were usually attributable to the pregnancy complications of preeclampsia and anticardiolipin antibody syndrome rather than to SLE. If all possible abnormalities were attributed to SLE, disease exacerbation occurred in less than 25% of all patients; if only SLE-specific abnormalities were counted, disease exacerbation occurred in less than 13%. Worsening of SLE is uncommon in pregnancy, and prophylactic prednisone therapy is unnecessary.\r"

The ratio of urinary 6 beta-OH-cortisol/17-OH-corticosteroids declined by greater than 50% and the urinary excretion of 6 beta-OH-prednisolone decreased more than twofold in all subjects. The decline of the activity of the 6 beta-hydroxylase was associated with impaired metabolic and renal clearances of total and unbound prednisolone. The ratios of the AUCs of prednisolone/prednisone after oral prednisone and intravenous prednisolone were independent of the administration of ketoconazole, suggesting that the enzymes responsible for the interconversion of prednisolone in equilibrium prednisone were not affected by ketoconazole. Thus ketoconazole inhibits 6 beta-hydroxylase and increases the exposure of the body to the biologically active unbound prednisolone after oral prednisone or intravenous prednisolone.\r"

This phenomenon varies among ventilators and underscores the importance of understanding technical differences between them. Appropriate ventilator selection is as important as mode selection when attempting to wean patients with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\r"

This improvement persisted even after 8 months when there was some return of the previous allodynia and vasomotor signs (to involve a smaller area than previously). The case would appear to have implications for a recently proposed hypothesis concerning the mechanism of pain in causalgia.\r"

There was a probable, though not significant, dose response relationship between the amount of iron excreted and the dose administered. The amount of iron excreted was 10%-15% of that obtained using the same dosage of deferoxamine given by the subcutaneous route over the same time period. Hourly administration was more effective than less frequent administration. Addition of taurodeoxycholate to deferoxamine did not increase its absorption as measured by the levels of iron excretion. Side effects were few and consisted mainly of mild nasal irritation and a bad taste in the mouth. Nasal administration of deferoxamine may be a useful adjunct to iron chelation in patients receiving chronic transfusion therapy, particularly in those who are noncompliant with parenteral means of administration.\r"

The patients were randomly allocated to 3 groups; the catheters were removed either immediately after the bladder was emptied, or 24 or 48 h later; 17 patients urinated satisfactorily after removal of the catheter. Re-establishment of micturition was not associated with the length of history or severity of symptoms of prostatism, with age or the presence of urinary tract infection. The mean retained volume of urine in patients with a satisfactory result was 786 ml and 1069 ml in the failures. Of the 34 patients with retained volumes of less than 900 ml, 15 were successful in re-establishing micturition compared with 2 of 26 of those with retained volumes greater than 900 ml. The time of catheter removal was not important. The 17 successful patients were reviewed 6 months later. None reported further urinary retention; 6 had required prostatectomy for severe symptoms, 6 had minor symptoms and 5 were symptomless. It was concluded that a trial without a catheter is worthwhile, since 11 of 60 patients had not required surgery, but it should be avoided in patients with a residual volume exceeding 900 ml.\r"

  ".W": "Severely injured patients frequently require endotracheal intubation, either by the nasotracheal (NT) or orotracheal (OT) route, for airway control and/or ventilatory support. If intubation is required for more than two to four weeks, an elective tracheostomy is usually indicated. Transferring these patients to the operating room is difficult, and it impairs their continued monitoring and care. Over a period of 48 months at our institution, 74 patients had tracheostomy done in the intensive care unit (ICU) by a surgical resident (PG2 level) assisted by a chief resident or attending faculty member. Local anesthesia was supplemented with intravenous sedatives, and operating room technique was used, with complete surgical instrument pack and adequate lighting. There were no deaths from the procedure. There were no complications specifically attributed to the performance of tracheostomy in the ICU, though one patient each suffered tracheitis, tracheostomy tube dislodgement, and tracheomalacia. Tracheostomy in the ICU avoids the risks of moving these patients with all their monitoring and infusion lines, and saves operating room time and charges. Trained surgical personnel using adequate instruments and lighting can safely perform a tracheostomy in the intensive care unit.\r"

We checked pleural plaques on chest x-ray films of these 71 cases and compared the exact plaque at autopsy. By the criteria of Askergren and Szamosi, we classified these into three groups (probable, definite, definite with calcification). This classification is consistent with the pleural plaques found at autopsy. Cases whose pleural plaques were definite (thick) had many more asbestos bodies than indefinite cases. As for occupational histories, there were 23 cases who worked in Japanese Naval shipyards before and during World War II, 14 others in various shipyards, and 14 others who also had a history of asbestos exposure. These 51 patients died more than 30 years after the first asbestos exposure. Twenty had no definite asbestos exposure.\r"

There are limited kinetic data after oral administration of ritodrine in pregnancy. The purpose of the present study was to compare ritodrine kinetics in pregnant and nonpregnant women, evaluate the effect of feeding on ritodrine absorption in pregnant women, and determine if the plasma concentration of ritodrine is proportional to the dose administered in nonpregnant women. Plasma concentrations after a single 20 mg dose of ritodrine were significantly greater in fasting nonpregnant women than in fasting pregnant women. The area under the concentration time curve was 1372 +/- 385 and 1001 +/- 257 ng/ml/min, respectively. In pregnant women ingesting 20 mg of ritodrine, plasma concentrations were not significantly different in the fed or fasted state; plasma concentrations peaked at 11 ng/ml and were less than 3 ng/ml within 4 hours. In nonpregnant subjects the concentration of ritodrine in plasma was proportional to the dose. After ingestion of 10, 20, or 30 mg of ritodrine, the area under the curve was 751 +/- 253, 1372 +/- 385, and 2148 +/- 571 ng/ml/min, respectively. These data indicate that ritodrine concentrations in pregnant women after a 20 mg oral dose are low. Increases in dosage will probably result in proportional increases in plasma concentration. The maximal dose of ritodrine recommended for prevention of recurrent preterm labor should be increased.\r"

Additionally, seven subjects with a history of recurrent wheezing after resolution of airway obstruction had a significantly higher mean level (3500 (1400)) during attacks of airway obstruction than those without (600 (100)).

Ductal adenocarcinoma is the dominating pancreatic tumor. Although its morphology is well known, our knowledge of its biology is limited. A grading system is presented for a better individual characterization of ductal adenocarcinoma. The tumor's poor prognosis is due to an early spread to retroperitoneal tissues. This most likely accounts for tumor recurrence so frequently seen after \"curative\" resection. Tumors other than ductal adenocarcinoma comprise only a minority of pancreatic neoplasms but must not be neglected because of their particular biological features.\r"

While carefully performed real-time US is an excellent technique for determining the level and etiology of bile duct obstruction, it is of more limited value for diagnosis of tumors in the body and tail of the gland, and is less accurate than IBD CT for assessment of tumor resectability. Thus, most patients require IBD CT for accurate, nonoperative staging. ERCP and angiography continue to be useful adjunctive procedures for evaluation of patients with suspected pancreatic carcinoma, particularly for evaluation of equivocal CT or US findings. An isolated pancreatic mass, that is, a mass with no ancillary CT or US findings of carcinoma (local extension, distant metastases), is a non-specific finding and requires further evaluation with either ERCP or angiography, and perhaps most importantly, with FNAB. Other neoplasms may mimic pancreatic ductal carcinoma, particularly islet cell carcinoma and lymphoma. Pancreatitis also can result in a focal pancreatic mass, simulating a neoplasm. These diseases usually respond to therapy and thus it is essential to confirm the radiologic diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma with biopsy, particularly if surgery is not planned or if chemoradiation therapy is anticipated.\r"

In a large number of cases, the imaging procedures can differentiate microcystic adenoma from mucinous cystadenoma, the more frequently encountered lesions. A well-defined mass with innumerable small cysts producing a honeycomb appearance with central stellate septae is suggestive of microcystic adenoma. A well-defined multilocular mass containing thin, straight or curvilinear septae with papillary projections and local thickening is suggestive of mucinous cystadenoma. 2. No sonographic or CT finding allows the differentiation between mucinous cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma, however; the imaging features depend on the grade of malignancy. 3. Thus, in the majority of cases of cystic lesions, fine needle aspiration with appropriate stains is recommended.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic pancreatitis is a slowly progressive disease. Initially, only focal changes occur, but diffuse structural abnormalities accompanied by various degrees of functional impairment are seen in the late stage. Morphological abnormalities in chronic pancreatitis can now be detected with high accuracy by several imaging methods. The most sensitive method is ERP, which is able to detect slight ductal changes at an early stage. High-resolution US has become a valid alternative to CT for the visualization of parenchymal abnormalities. However, CT is more accurate than US in detecting small cysts and calcifications. By comparing ductal abnormalities (ERP) and parenchymal lesions (CT, US) with pancreatic function impairment, it has become quite clear that the morphofunctional correlation is tight only in the \"late\" or severe stages of chronic pancreatitis. In \"early\" or \"moderate\" stages of chronic pancreatitis, correlation of the degree of morphological abnormalities and pancreatic dysfunction is frequently poor. Studies comparing the value of the different imaging methods with pancreatic function tests in the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis have found ERP and the duodenal intubation SC test to have the highest diagnostic accuracies. Correlation between the degree of ductal abnormalities (ERP) and pancreatic dysfunction in the SC test, and between the degree of parenchymal abnormalities (CT and US) and the SC test both proved significant. However, prediction of exocrine function based on morphological alterations, or vice versa, is not possible. The value of combining function testing with imaging is enhancement of the diagnostic accuracy in the presence of only \"mild\" morphologic abnormalities detected with the imaging techniques. In advanced stages of chronic pancreatitis, function testing is a valid complementary tool to characterize the clinical stage of the disease and may have an impact on therapeutic decisions in patients with advanced stages of chronic pancreatitis. Invasive function testing (SC test) can be replaced by oral pancreatic function tests, which yield equivalent results or clinical decisions.\r"

  ".W": "Hemorrhage is one of the most life-threatening complications of pancreatitis. It is usually due to erosion of a major pancreatic or peripancreatic vessel with massive bleeding into the gastrointestinal tract or abdominal cavity, or to formation and subsequent rupture of an arterial pseudoaneurysm. In addition, the inflammatory process of pancreatitis may cause thrombosis of the portal vein or its main tributaries, the splenic and superior mesenteric veins, resulting in compartmental portal hypertension with gastric, mesenteric, or colonic varices. Variceal hemorrhage is not an uncommon vascular complication of pancreatitis. The use of the newer, noninvasive imaging modalities of US, duplex Doppler US, and bolus-dynamic CT; earlier use of diagnostic and therapeutic angiography; and a more aggressive surgical approach have led to significant reductions in morbidity and mortality rates for patients with vascular complications secondary to pancreatitis. The radiologic diagnosis of vascular complications can be accomplished with US, CT, and angiography. US and CT may show formation of arterial pseudoaneurysms, evidence of hemorrhage into a pancreatic pseudocyst or fluid collection, or portal venous thrombosis with development of varices. The presence of flow in a pseudoaneurysm, or absence of flow due to portal venous thrombosis, can be confirmed by contrast-enhanced dynamic CT or duplex Doppler US. Angiography should be utilized in all patients, if possible, to show the precise site and source of bleeding. Although active bleeding can be diagnosed only by detection of contrast extravasation, the source of bleeding often can be identified by demonstration of an underlying vascular abnormality, such as a pseudoaneurysm or varices. Patients who are hemodynamically stable and who have angiographic evidence of bleeding can be treated with transcatheter embolization. This may result in permanent control of the bleeding, providing definitive treatment, or temporary control, thus allowing surgery to be performed on an elective or semi-emergent basis. Patients who are unstable or who have vascular involvement that is not amenable to transcatheter embolization should have emergency surgery. Preoperative angiography should be performed prior to surgery, if possible. Angiography can show the surgeon the exact vessel involved, as well as the surrounding vascular anatomy, thus facilitating the surgical approach. In selected patients, occlusion balloon catheters can be employed to obtain hemostasis during or after pancreatic surgery.\r"

Radiologic assessment of these complications is based on judicious use of ultrasound, computed tomography, and direct cholangiography. The typical imaging finding of common bile duct stenosis due to chronic pancreatitis is gradual tapered narrowing of the intrapancreatic common bile duct, which can be portrayed by carefully accomplished computed tomography, and ultrasound as well as cholangiography. When combined with clinical assessment, imaging tests can help determine strategies for treatment, which include traditional operations as well as transhepatic, endoscopic, or percutaneous interventions.\r"

  ".U": "89060821\r", 
  ".W": "Somatostatin is a peptide synthesized in many tissues that can act as a neurotransmitter, a systemic hormone, or a local hormone, and inhibits the secretion of hormones or other cell products. A long-acting synthetic analogue of somatostatin (SMS 201-995) has been developed which when administered subcutaneously has a biologic half-life of 90 to 120 minutes and can be administered 2 or 3 times per day. SMS 201-995 can lower plasma concentrations of growth hormone and somatomedin-C in patients with pituitary acromegaly, but no controlled trials to assess symptomatic response or change in tumor size have been done. In patients with pituitary thyrotropin-producing pituitary tumors, SMS 201-995 has been remarkably effective in producing biochemical and clinical responses and is the drug of first choice in this syndrome when tumor resection is not possible. In patients with the carcinoid syndrome, SMS 201-995 effectively reduces diarrhea, is the best available drug for treatment of carcinoid flush (effective in approximately 90% of cases), and is useful in treating carcinoid crisis. Eighty-five percent of patients with pancreatic islet cell tumors that produce vasoactive intestinal peptide will respond to SMS 201-995 with a reduction in diarrhea that often has been resistant to all other therapy. SMS 201-995 may also be useful in treating the symptoms in some patients with glucagonomas, growth hormone releasing hormone-producing tumors and insulinomas. Whether SMS 201-995 has a significant effect on gut neuroendocrine tumor growth remains uncertain. Certain nonmalignant diseases of the gut respond to somatostatin, including secretory diarrhea and fistulas of unknown cause. In general, SMS 201-995 has proved safe with few significant side effects, but whether the long-term use of the drug will result in an iatrogenic form of the somatostatinoma syndrome is uncertain.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To assess the current status of high-dose chemotherapy with autologous marrow transplantation in hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. DATA IDENTIFICATION: Studies reported between 1978 and May 1988 were identified through computer searches using Medline and Cancerline and through extensive manual searching of bibliographies of identified books and articles. STUDY SELECTION: More than 160 studies that contained adequate response, toxicity, or survival data were selected for analysis, including peer-reviewed articles, book chapters, and proceedings of meetings. The most current or complete references were used for series reported more than once. DATA ANALYSIS: Information abstracted included regimen used, number of patients, response rates, disease-free and overall survival, and toxicities. A meta-analysis of the pooled data was done. RESULTS OF DATA ANALYSIS: For many tumor types, autologous marrow transplantation offers higher response rates than standard approaches. For leukemias and lymphomas, response rates of 60% to 80% may be achieved with the potential for cure. With solid tumors, response rates range from 30% in gliomas, 50% in melanomas and colon cancer, more than 60% in lung cancer, and 80% in breast cancer. Although responses tend to be short-lived, long-term survival can occasionally be seen. CONCLUSIONS: Results with autologous marrow transplantation can be improved through systematically developed, carefully designed clinical trials that may be facilitated by collaborative research. Studies should focus on disease-directed drug combinations, several courses of high-dose therapy, treatment at a time of lower tumor burden, and reducing toxicity with hematopoietic growth factors.\r"

DATA IDENTIFICATION: We discuss the rapidly evolving new knowledge in this field after analyzing the literature in English published since 1979. STUDY SELECTION: We reviewed 117 articles on recurring chest pain and paid specific attention to the following nine controversial issues: the potential mechanisms of esophageal pain, the differentiation of cardiac and esophageal causes, the evaluation of new esophageal motility disorders, the use of esophageal tests in evaluating noncardiac chest pain, the usefulness of techniques for prolonged monitoring of intraesophageal pressure and pH, the relation of psychologic abnormalities to esophageal motility disorders, the possible mechanisms for decreased visceral pain thresholds in these patients, the relation of esophageal chest pain to the irritable bowel syndrome, and the appropriate therapies for these patients. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: Through our review of the literature, we identified areas of concordance and disagreement. These areas are discussed and an overall perspective is provided. CONCLUSIONS: Continuing attempts to develop rational diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to patients with noncardiac chest pain should include a multidisciplinary approach involving basic scientists, gastroenterologists, psychologists, and other clinical experts in the field of pain research.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of a geriatric consultation team on the functional status of hospitalized elderly patients. DESIGN: Randomized controlled clinical trial. SETTING: University-affiliated referral Veterans Administration Medical Center. PATIENTS: One hundred and seventy-eight hospitalized elderly men 75 years or older admitted to medical, surgical, and psychiatry services, but excluding patients admitted to intensive care units. INTERVENTION: Eighty-eight intervention group patients received multidimensional evaluation by an interdisciplinary geriatric consultation team composed of a faculty geriatrician, geriatrics fellow, geriatric clinical nurse specialist, and a social worker trained in geriatrics. Results of the evaluation, including problem identification and recommendations, were given to the patients' physicians. Ninety control group patients received only usual care. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Intervention and control groups were comparable initially. The major outcome variable was the Index of Independence in the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) (Katz). Thirty-nine percent of the total study population was functionally independent on admission, 27% required assistance with one to three ADL, 22% required assistance with four to six ADL, and 12% were completely dependent. Many patients remained unchanged from admission to discharge: intervention group, 38%; control group, 39%. In the intervention group, 34% improved and 28% declined; in the control group, 26% improved and 36% declined. Although these changes reflected a trend toward greater improvement in the intervention group, the results were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Among elderly patients entering an acute-care hospital, approximately 60% had some degree of, and one third had serious functional disability. Such patients are at risk for further decline during hospitalization. A geriatric consultation team was unable to alter the degree of functional decline. Geriatric units or consultation teams may have to offer direct preventive or restorative services in addition to advice if improvements are to be made.\r"

  ".W": "The liver is the main site of iron accumulation and pathologic sequelae in hereditary hemochromatosis. Whether this is a result solely of inappropriately increased absorption of iron by the gastrointestinal tract or a more generalized regulatory failure of iron balance is unknown. Using immunohistochemical techniques, we have examined the effects of therapeutic changes in liver iron stores on the expression of the hepatic transferrin receptor in hereditary hemochromatosis. Ten patients with untreated hereditary hemochromatosis had no detectable staining for transferrin receptor in their liver biopsies. All had increased hepatic ferritin (mean = 19.9 micrograms per mg protein, range = 1 to 31.7 micrograms per mg protein) and hepatic iron levels (mean = 36.2 micrograms per mg protein, range = 3.6 to 69.9 micrograms per mg protein). In contrast, hepatocyte transferrin receptor was detected in seven patients in whom hepatic iron stores were markedly depleted by venesection (hepatic ferritin mean = 0.32 microgram per mg protein, range = 0.16 to 0.53 microgram per mg protein; hepatic iron mean = 0.98 microgram per mg protein, range = 0.3 to 2.1 micrograms per mg protein). Sequential data from one patient confirmed the reexpression of receptor in response to therapeutic iron depletion, whereas data from another patient studied during treatment illustrated a reciprocal relationship between liver tissue distribution of iron and expression of transferrin receptor. The finding that appropriate physiologic regulation of the hepatic transferrin receptor operates in hereditary hemochromatosis does not support the concept of a generalized defect in receptor-mediated uptake of transferrin-bound iron.\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred ninety patients (203 men, 87 women), age 7 to 74 years (mean: 39.1 years), with chronic hepatitis B virus infection, were prospectively followed for a period of 1 to 4 years to determine the value of alpha-fetoprotein monitoring in the early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma. At presentation, 66% of the patients were asymptomatic, 19% had chronic hepatitis and 15% had established cirrhosis. Forty-four (15%) patients had elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels on one or more occasions during the study period. Twenty patients with normal alpha-fetoprotein levels at presentation developed elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels during the course of follow-up, whereas 24 patients had elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels at presentation. Six (14%) of these 44 patients (five men and one woman), age 23 to 66 years, had persistent or progressive increase in alpha-fetoprotein levels and were confirmed to have hepatocellular carcinoma. In four patients, the alpha-fetoprotein levels were below 500 ng per ml at the time of tumor localization. Only three patients had resectable tumors. All six patients would have been missed if alpha-fetoprotein screening was restricted to men above the age of 40 with cirrhosis and anti-HBe. Of the remaining 38 patients, elevation in alpha-fetoprotein levels in 18 patients was associated with exacerbations of the underlying liver disease and/or significant changes in level of hepatitis B virus replication, but in 20 patients, no apparent cause could be identified. The elevation in AFP levels exceeded 200 ng per ml in 26% and persisted beyond 6 months in 15% of these patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
