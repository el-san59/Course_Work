  ".W": "Orthotopic implantation of human colon carcinoma cells is useful for studying the behavior of metastatic subpopulations. We observed that the parental line and variants of human colon carcinoma KM12 cells were all tumorigenic following implantation into the subcutis or cecal wall of BALB/c nude mice. Their ability to metastasize to distant organ sites varied, however, with the site of growth. Subcutaneous (SC) tumors did not produce visceral metastases, whereas cecal tumors metastasized to the regional mesenteric lymph nodes and to the liver. To examine the influence of organ environment on the extracellular matrix-degrading activity of the tumors, we inoculated human colon carcinoma cells into the subcutis or cecal wall and after 7 weeks isolated and cultured the tumors in serum-free medium. The conditioned media of SC tumors contained very low levels of type IV collagenase (gelatinase) and heparanase (heparan sulfate-specific endo-beta-D-glucuronidase), whereas the media of the cecal wall tumors contained high levels of both. Zymograms of the media revealed that the intracecal human colon carcinomas secreted more than three times the amount of latent and active forms of 92-kd type IV collagenase than did the SC tumors. Moreover, only the conditioned media of intracecal tumors contained latent and active forms of 64-kd type IV collagenase. Histochemical analysis using rabbit antiserum raised against the synthetic peptides of 72-kd procollagenase type IV showed type IV collagenase in the intracecal tumors; human colon carcinoma growing SC, however, were not stained significantly. These results suggest that factors in the organ environment may affect production and secretion of tumor extracellular matrix-degrading enzymes, and these factors may modify the metastatic behavior of human colon carcinoma cells in nude mice.\r"

  ".W": "In an effort to test clinically the hypothesis that the duration of cellular exposure to etoposide (VP-16) and cisplatin (CDDP) is an important determinant of cytotoxicity, we performed a phase III randomized trial comparing an outpatient bolus regimen of combined VP-16 and CDDP with a sequential infusion over 72 hours of these same two drugs. All patients had stage IV non-small cell lung cancer, and survival was the primary end point. Of 113 patients randomly allocated to the study, 108 were assessable for response, survival, and toxicity. A major response was observed in 20 (37%) of 54 patients on the bolus regimen and in 16 (30%) of 54 patients receiving infusion therapy. The median time to progression was 61 and 88 days for bolus and infusion therapy, respectively. The median survival time was 148 and 157 days, respectively (P = .71). Study results were not consistent with the possibility that infusion therapy could be associated with a 50% improvement in median survival, i.e. from 5 months to 7 1/2 months. Toxicity was primarily myelosuppression and was significantly greater with the infusion regimen. We conclude that infusion therapy as tested in this protocol with VP-16 and CDDP does not offer any advantage in response rate, time to disease progression, or survival as compared with bolus therapy. In addition, infusion therapy is associated with a greater degree of neutropenia and more treatment-related deaths.\r"

  ".W": "Cells from a radiation-induced fibrosarcoma (RIF-1) are exceedingly resistant to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in vitro. We tested whether the addition of mild hyperthermia (42.5 degrees C, 30 minutes) could enhance TNF-alpha activity against RIF-1 tumors growing in syngeneic hosts (C3H mice). TNF-alpha was administered intratumorally. Tumor cell killing essentially was not measurable following TNF-alpha, hyperthermia, or a combination of the two. Single-modality treatments also had no effect on tumor growth delay or on the x-ray dose (given 24 hours after the primary treatment) required to sterilize 50% of the tumors. The combination of TNF-alpha and hyperthermia, however, resulted in a marked increase in tumor doubling time and a highly significant reduction in the x-ray dose required to sterilize the tumors. Syngeneic lymph nodal lymphocytes and blood leukocytes did not appear to mediate the action of TNF-alpha on RIF-1 cells in vitro. Necrosis and hemorrhage were the most prominent histopathological alterations in the treated tumors. Electron microscopic studies 6 hours after therapy showed increased damage to capillary endothelial cells and accumulation of neutrophils in the capillaries of tumors treated with TNF-alpha with or without heat, suggesting that neutrophils may mediate the endothelial cell injury. These observations indicate a greater than additive tumoricidal effect of TNF-alpha with hyperthermia. Furthermore, they support the concept that the interaction between the two agents damages the vasculature, compromising the microcirculation and ultimately causing ischemic tumor necrosis.\r"

Families were categorized into four groups based on the histologic type of breast cancer in the probands:ductal cancer, lobular cancer, adenocarcinoma, and medullary cancer. The ductal cancer sample was further split into a premenopausal-proband and a postmenopausal-proband subset. Results for six complex segregation analyses are presented; the findings suggest heterogeneity in the transmission of breast cancer. For all analyses, there was no evidence for a multifactorial component in the mixed model, ie, a major locus plus other transmission, genetic and/or cultural. Interpretation of the medullary cancer, adenocarcinoma, and lobular cancer analyses does not permit discrimination among the major locus models. Segregation of breast cancer in the entire ductal sample was consistent with autosomal recessive transmission. In the ductal subanalyses, a recessive gene was sufficient to explain the breast cancer distribution when the proband had postmenopausal breast cancer. In contrast, when the proband had premenopausal breast cancer, the transmission model was consistent with a dominant major gene, with sporadic cases of disease.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have shown a survival benefit for patients with recurrent glioblastomas treated with stereotactic brachytherapy. On the basis of these encouraging results, we began a prospective study in 1987 to evaluate the use of brachytherapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Patients were considered eligible for this study if they met the following criteria: Karnofsky performance status 70% or greater; tumor size not greater than 5 cm in any dimension; a radiographically well delineated, supratentorial lesion not involving the ependymal surfaces; and pathologically confirmed glioblastoma. We treated 35 such patients between 1987 and 1990 with stereotactic brachytherapy as part of their initial therapy. The treatment protocol involved surgery, partial brain external-beam radiotherapy (59.4 Gy in 33 fractions), and stereotactic brachytherapy with temporary high-activity iodine 125 sources giving an additional 50 Gy to the tumor bed. Chemotherapy was not used in the initial management of these 35 patients. To compare our results with those obtained in a matched control group, we identified 40 patients with glioblastoma treated with surgery and external radiotherapy, with or without chemotherapy, between 1977 and 1986 at our institution. These patients had clinical and radiographic characteristics that would have made them eligible for the brachytherapy protocol. Survival rates at 1 and 2 years after diagnosis were 87% and 57%, respectively, for patients receiving brachytherapy versus 40% and 12.5%, respectively, for the controls (P less than .001). We conclude that stereotactic brachytherapy improves the survival of patients with glioblastoma when it can be incorporated into the initial treatment approach. Unfortunately, only about one in four patients with glioblastoma are suitable candidates for brachytherapy at the time of initial presentation.\r"

Material with identical chromatographic and molecular weight characteristics was also present in the serum of patients with clinical cancer cachexia but absent from normal serum, even under conditions of starvation. The MAC16 lipid factor, when injected into animals bearing the non-cachexia-inducing tumor MAC13, was capable of inducing weight loss without a significant reduction in food intake. Similar lipolytic material, although in lower concentration, was also found in the MAC13 tumor extracts. These findings suggest that cachexia may arise from the enhanced expression of a lipolytic factor associated with tumor cells.\r"

  ".U": "91066362\r", 
  ".W": "Hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA; NSC 95580) is a potent polar-planar differentiating agent of leukemia and solid tumor cell lines in vitro at clinically achievable concentrations. HMBA is currently being studied in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. Previous phase I trials have demonstrated that HMBA produces hematologic toxicity in morphologically normal bone marrows of patients with solid tumors. Because of concern that HMBA may produce more severe myelotoxicity in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome since these patients have limited hematopoietic reserves, we studied the effects of HMBA on myelodysplastic and normal hematopoietic progenitors in vitro. HMBA concentrations that are optimal for differentiation in vitro (2 to 5 mmol/L) and HMBA concentrations that are being achieved in clinical trials (1 to 2 mmol/L) inhibited the growth of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units and erythroid burst-forming units from all 15 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and all 4 normal subjects, HMBA did not induce proliferation of myelodysplastic or normal progenitors at any concentration; rather, it produced nearly identical inhibition of normal and myelodysplastic hematopoietic progenitors. HMBA also produced quantitatively similar inhibition of clonogenic leukemic growth of two myeloid leukemia cell lines. For a differentiating agent to be effective, it will likely have to either produce both differentiation and proliferation of abnormal hematopoietic progenitors or show selective inhibitory effects on abnormal as compared with normal progenitors. Although the mechanisms responsible for the antiproliferative effects of HMBA cannot be determined from this study, similar inhibitory effects of HMBA on normal and abnormal hematopoietic progenitors suggest that HMBA may be of limited utility in producing and sustaining elevations of peripheral blood cell counts in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.\r"

In this study, the direct cytotoxic effect of FUdR was measured on ten metastatic and two primary-site colorectal carcinomas in a primary culture assay system. Overall, clinically achievable concentrations of FUdR (0.4 to 4 microM) induced partial cell kill in 75% of tumors, including a greater than 50% reduction in viable tumor cell number in only two tumors and less than 50% in the remaining seven. Total cell kill was not observed in any tumor. Three tumors were resistant to these FUdR concentrations. Tumor sensitivity correlated with the size of the tumor growth fraction. Increasing the exposure time to FUdR from 3 to 7 days approximately doubled the magnitude of the response. 5-Flurouracil and cisplatin, at clinically achievable concentrations, were more toxic to metastatic tumor cells than FUdR. Because of the limited chemosensitivity of metastatic colorectal tumor cells to FUdR in vitro, we postulate that other mechanisms besides direct cytotoxicity contribute to the clinical efficacy of FUdR in vivo.\r"

Only 5 patients underwent resection of locally recurrent esophagogastric (EG) adenocarcinoma during this period. No squamous carcinoma recurrences were resected. One patient is well 15 months later while another died at 18 months of other causes without recurrence. Recurrence after re-resection occurred at 8, 11, and 24 months in the 3 other patients.

Over the past two decades, the modified neck dissection has been effectively utilized for conservation of function and cosmesis while achieving the same oncologic goals. However, there are several instances where the above standard procedures are not adequate for resection of malignant tumors. Although there is a definite trend toward conservation procedures, extended neck dissection is often necessary especially in patients with N2 and N3 disease. Apart from the standard structures removed in radical neck dissection, the other structures removed in extended neck dissection include skin, the digastric muscle, hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve, sympathetic chain, ramus mandibularis, carotid artery, tracheo-esophageal nodes, etc. Over the past seven years, we have performed 40 extended neck dissections. All the patients had N2 or N3 disease in the neck. Nine patients had unknown primaries. Thirteen patients had their primary tumors in the oral cavity and 11 in the laryngopharynx. Five patients had primary tumor in the salivary glands and two patients had metastatic melanoma. Patients who underwent extensive skin excision had pectoralis myocutaneous flap reconstruction. All patients received postoperative radiation therapy. One patient died of cardiac problems 4 weeks after operation. Local control was achieved in 70%. The most difficult region for local control was the disease behind the mastoid process, and the most difficult problems were patients with involvement of the subdermal lymphatics. Our data suggests that there are definite situations where extended neck dissection is indicated with satisfactory local control of the nodal disease.\r"

These data suggest that Leu-7+ cells might be related to the defense mechanism of regional lymph nodes against tumor.\r"

On each day, two mice were sacrificed and sections were examined with autoradiography (ARG), immunoperoxidase methods (IMP), and routine stains. Mean probe counts showed increasing tumor to background ratios and ARG demonstrated a progressive increase in radionuclide in the tumors. The distribution of 125I was primarily around the vascular spaces on day 1, but by day 3 and progressively it appeared in tumor gland lumina and necrotic areas. A regional correlation was shown between radionuclide in vascular spaces and its sequestration in tumor elements.\r"

Nevertheless, it represents the second most common type of hospital-acquired infection and results in increased morbidity and mortality. As with all nosocomial infections, the rate of surgical wound infection increases with age. Patients over 65 years of age run an approximately 15% risk of surgical wound infection. Two-thirds of patients with invasive cancer other than non-melanotic skin cancer are aged 65 years and over. Over half of them are treated surgically for their cancer. Cancer and other chronic diseases have been cited as possible causes of the increased risk of nosocomial infection among the elderly. Using the Foothills Hospital Wound Study Data Base as the sampling frame, we conducted a case-control study of surgical wound infection and cancer among the elderly. Cancer was found not to be a risk factor for surgical wound infection. The results are discussed in relation to the role of immunity in both disorders.\r"

Median survival for the 56 patients diagnosed during life was 106 days. Only 11 patients lived longer than one year. Two patients were long survivors and presumed cured, one living 27 years after diagnosis and surgical treatment and the other 19 years. Cox regression model showed young age at diagnosis and low stage of disease at diagnosis to be significant predictors of long survival. White patients survived nearly twice as long as black patients but the difference was not significant. Gender and year of diagnosis did not appear to be important determinants of survival. Pathologic material was still available for one of the two long survivors and the histology was that of fibrolamellar carcinoma of young adults.\r"

All the patients were black and the commonest sites were the ileum (28.1%), rectosigmoid and rectum (21.9%), and the appendix and lung (15.6% each). Metastasis correlated with site, size, and depth of the primary tumor and occurred in 12 patients (38%), most frequently to the regional lymph nodes and liver. Carcinoid syndrome developed in 12.5% (3 F, 1 M). Surgical resection for cure or palliation was the mainstay of treatment. Overall 5 year survival rate was 66%, and for those with metastases was 0%. The poorer survival rates are probably related to the socioeconomic status of our patient population. The only observed racial difference compared to other series is the preponderance of males, and the disproportionately higher ratio of females with the carcinoid syndrome.\r"

The etiology of the pericardial effusion was definitely malignant, by cytology/histology in 13 patients (62%), and suspected malignant by cytology in 2 patients (9%). One patient (5%) with definitely nonmalignant pericardial effusion by cytology was found to be histologically positive at autopsy. In 5 patients (24%) there was no histological/cytological evidence of malignancy; radiation pericarditis could be the etiology in 4 of these 5 patients. The median time from the diagnosis of breast cancer to the development of symptomatic pericardial effusion was 60 months (range: 1-219 months). Ten patients developed cardiac tamponade; they were treated by either pericardiocentesis or pericardiectomy. The mean survival of patients with negative cytology/histology was 12 months; patients with suspicious cytology had a mean survival of 9 months; patients with malignant effusion, treated by pericardiectomy, had a mean survival of 22.3 months, while patients with malignant pericardial effusion, who were not subjected to surgery, had a mean survival of 4.7 months, only. It is concluded that the etiology of symptomatic pericardial effusion in breast cancer patients is not always malignant, which emphasizes the role of fluid cytology in establishing definite diagnosis. The survival probability is a function of the extent of extracardiac disease; among patients with malignant pericardial effusion those selected for pericardiectomy have a longer than average survival.\r"

Kredel, who first voiced the concept of the operation in 1950, referred to it as halfectomy. Demonstration of his cadaver studies established the feasibility of the operation. Amputation is effected through the lower lumbar area of the body. Necessary life functions are preserved in the upper torso. Kredel envisioned hemicorporectomy as a curative operation for locally advanced cancer, limited to the pelvis, not encompassable by standard operative intervention. Additional indications are intractable decubitus ulcers with malignant change, particularly in paraplegics; pelvic organs, and bone infection with nonhealing fistulae; and crushing trauma to the pelvis. The first hemicorporectomy operation was reported in 1960. Thirty-four operations have been recorded in the world literature. Two heretofore unreported cases are added, raising the total to 36. Review of these 36 cases confirms the conviction that hemicorporectomy is a humane and ethical alternative to the suffering encumbered by advancing, painful, malodorous malignant disease not treatable by conventional means. While cure rates are not substantial, the best results are reported in paraplegics with intractable decubitus ulcers with or without malignancy. Rehabilitation is prolonged and costly. Most survivors have been restored to preoperative occupations or other gainful employment.\r"

He demonstrated the characteristics of a Marfanoid habitus and had mucosal neuromas of the lips, tongue, eyelids, and cornea. The enlarged right thyroid lobe showed an increased thallium-201 chloride uptake, and the serum calcitonin level was markedly raised. A total thyroidectomy was performed. Histopathological examination showed an infiltrating medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (MCT) and metastatic spread to supraclavicular lymph nodes. Special stains, immunocytochemistry, and electron microscopy revealed mucin-containing follicular structures lined by calcitonin-positive and thyroglobulin-negative tumour cells. Ultrastructurally the mucosal neuromas consisted of proliferating perineurial and Schwann cells. The serum calcitonin level fell below 300 pmol/L, and his stools returned to normal postoperatively. Because the incidence of MCT in MEN-IIb is virtually 100%, a total thyroidectomy in high risk patients--even before clinical evidence of malignant tumours--may be the only hope of cure.\r"

All isolates from the children with cerebral malaria were able to form rosettes, whereas those from children with mild forms of the disease did not form rosettes, or had a significantly lower rosetting rate. Plasma of children with cerebral malaria lacked anti-rosetting activity, whereas plasma of children with mild disease could often disrupt rosettes in vitro. A monoclonal antibody to P falciparum histidine rich protein (PfHRP1/KP/KAHRP) disrupted rosettes of many of the isolates in vitro indicating that the rosetting ligand is relatively conserved compared with ligands associated with endothelial cytoadherence. The findings strongly support the hypothesis that erythrocyte rosetting contributes to the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria and suggest that anti-rosetting antibodies protect against cerebral disease.\r"

An excess risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) was found for wards which are farthest from large urban centres. The excess was greatest for wards of higher socioeconomic status and for children aged 1-7 years (the childhood peak), for which a two-fold excess was seen. These findings in general support the hypothesis that childhood leukaemia has an infectious aetiology.\r"

There was a generalised effacement of the glomerular epithelial cells onto the basement membrane. The filtration slits that remained were narrowed. The picture was similar to that seen in minimal-change nephrotic syndrome--but none of the children had albuminuria. The degree of effacement was statistically related to treatment with gentamicin. The findings suggest that there is a defect in the anionic charge of the glomerular basement membrane in oedematous malnutrition, that the membrane charge is more easily neutralised by cations such as gentamicin, and that, because proteinuria is not a feature of oedematous malnutrition, the proteinuria in other conditions associated with glomerular epithelial cell effacement (eg, minimal-change nephrotic syndrome) is due to something more complex than simple loss of charge.\r"

Since pregnancy testing during mass distribution campaigns is not feasible, the safety of ivermectin in pregnancy must be established. During a 3-year study, ivermectin was distributed to the population of a rubber plantation (14,000 people) in Liberia. Only 31% of women were aware of their pregnancy status during the first month; it was calculated that about half of women in the first trimester of pregnancy are likely to be treated inadvertently. 203 children born to women inadvertently treated during pregnancy were identified. In this limited sample, there was no significant difference in birth defects between treated and untreated mothers in the same population or compared with a reference population. Children of treated and untreated mothers showed no difference in developmental status or disease patterns. Further surveillance is necessary; however, since no major effects of ivermectin on pregnancy outcome were detected, there seems no need to change existing strategies of ivermectin distribution.\r"

Psychophysical experiments have, however, revealed mechanisms selectively responsive to light modulated in three 'cardinal directions' in colour space. The responses of these mechanisms are determined by algebraic sums of the excitations of the cones. One of these mechanisms is responsive to changes in luminance, its spectral sensitivity being that of the sum of the L and M cones. The other two respond best to isoluminant changes in light. The responses of one of these mechanisms are determined by the difference in the excitations of the L and M cones, and those of the other one determined by the difference between the excitation of the S cones on the one hand and the excitations of the L and M cones on the other. We have obtained quite surprising results concerning the role of these mechanisms in the perception of motion. Drifting gratings modulated along different cardinal directions appear to slip with respect to one another. In contrast, when the directions of the modulations are rotated by 45 degrees in colour space, the gratings cohere. Our results are consistent with the notion that information about movement is analysed within mechanisms maximally responsive along the cardinal directions.\r"

  ".W": "The putative oncogene bcl-2 is juxtaposed to the immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) locus by the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation typical of human follicular B-cell lymphomas. The bcl-2 gene product is not altered by the translocation, but its expression is deregulated, presumably by the Igh enhancer E mu. Constitutive bcl-2 expression seems to augment cell survival, as infection with a bcl-2 retrovirus enables certain growth factor-dependent mouse cell lines to maintain viability when deprived of factor. Furthermore, high levels of the bcl-2 product can protect human B and T lymphoblasts under stress and thereby confer a growth advantage. Mice expressing a bcl-2 transgene controlled by the Igh enhancer accumulate small non-cycling B cells which survive unusually well in vitro but do not show a propensity for spontaneous tumorigenesis. In contrast, an analogous myc transgene, designed to mimic the myc-Igh translocation product typical of Burkitt's lymphoma and rodent plasmacytoma, promotes B lymphoid cell proliferation and predisposes mice to malignancy in pre-B and B lymphoid cells. Previous experiments have suggested that bcl-2 can cooperate with deregulated myc to improve in vitro growth of pre-B and B cells. Here we describe a marked synergy between bcl-2 and myc in doubly transgenic mice. E mu-bcl-2/myc mice show hyperproliferation of pre-B and B cells and develop tumours much faster than E mu-myc mice. Suprisingly, the tumours derive from a cell with the hallmarks of a primitive haemopoietic cell, perhaps a lymphoid-committed stem cell.\r"

The bcl-2 immunoglobulin fusion gene is markedly deregulated resulting in inappropriately elevated levels of bcl-2 RNA and protein. Transgenic mice bearing a bcl-2 immunoglobulin minigene demonstrate a polyclonal expansion of resting yet responsive IgM-IgD B cells which display prolonged cell survival but no increase in cell cycling. Moreover, deregulated bcl-2 extends the survival of certain haematopoietic cell lines following growth-factor deprivation. By using immunolocalization studies we now demonstrate that Bcl-2 is an integral inner mitochondrial membrane protein of relative molecular mass 25,000 (25k). Overexpression of Bcl-2 blocks the apoptotic death of a pro-B-lymphocyte cell line. Thus, Bcl-2 is unique among proto-oncogenes, being localized to mitochondria and interfering with programmed cell death independent of promoting cell division.\r"

  ".W": "Photosynthesis is the hallmark of plant life and is the only plastid metabolic process known to be controlled by plastid genes. The complete loss of photosynthetic ability, however, has occurred on several independent occasions in parasitic flowering plants. Some of these plants are known to lack chlorophyll and certain photosynthetic enzymes, but it is not known to what extent changes have occurred in the genes encoding the photosynthetic apparatus or whether the plants even maintain a plastid genome. Here we report that the nonphotosynthetic root parasite Epifagus virginiana has a plastid chromosome only 71 kilobases in size, far smaller than any previously characterized land plant plastid genome. The Epifagus plastid genome has lost most, if not all, of the 30 or more chloroplast genes for photosynthesis and most of a large family of plastid genes, the ndh genes, whose products may be involved in a plastid respiratory chain. The extensive changes in Epifagus plastid gene content must have occurred in a relatively short time (5-50 x 10(6) yr), because Striga asiatica, a related photosynthetic parasite, has a typical complement of chloroplast genes for photosynthesis and chlororespiration. The plastid genome of Epifagus has retained transcribed ribosomal RNA and ribosomal protein genes, suggesting that it expresses one or more gene products for plastid functions not related to photosynthesis.\r"

As GroEL is isolated and functions as a 20-25S tetradecameric particle (GroELp), the question arises--what is the mechanism of its own assembly?

The resulting series of less supercoiled plasmids is stabilized by RNA-DNA hybrids formed by the nascent RNA transcripts, which remain base-paired with their DNA templates.\r"

Although it is known that the virion uses a basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor to penetrate vascular cells, it is not known how the viral particle recognizes and binds to this cell surface protein. Here we report that an immunoreactive basic FGF-like protein is associated with the viral particle and that this association appears responsible for viral uptake. Accordingly, HSV-1 infection of Swiss 3T3 cells stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of the specific substrate that characterizes the initial cellular response to basic FGF. Antibodies to basic FGF prevent this phosphorylation and inhibit HSV-1 uptake. Because no basic FGF sequence is found in the HSV-1 genome, a model for the infection for some target cells is presented whereby the viral particle uses host cell-derived basic FGF to ensure subsequent infectivity of newly replicated virus.\r"

  ".W": "Organelle transport along microtubules is believed to be mediated by organelle-associated force-generating molecules. Two classes of microtubule-based organelle motors have been identified: kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein. To correlate the mechanochemical basis of force generation with the in vivo behaviour of organelles, it is important to quantify the force needed to propel an organelle along microtubules and to determine the force generated by a single motor molecule. Measurements of force generation are possible under selected conditions in vitro, but are much more difficult using intact or reactivated cells. Here we combine a useful model system for the study of organelle transport, the giant amoeba Reticulomyxa, with a novel technique for the non-invasive manipulation of and force application to subcellular components, which is based on a gradient-force optical trap, also referred to as 'optical tweezers'. We demonstrate the feasibility of using controlled manipulation of actively translocating organelles to measure direct force. We have determined the force driving a single organelle along microtubules, allowing us to estimate the force generated by a single motor to be 2.6 x 10(-7) dynes.\r"

It is not known whether transporters on intracellular membranes are target sites for second messengers. Here we present direct evidence that a chloride conductance in endocytic vesicles from rabbit proximal tubule is activated by phosphorylation through a cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. To measure chloride transport, endocytic vesicles were labelled in vivo with a Cl(-)-sensitive fluorescent indicator6-8. It was found that labelled endosomes contained an inward proton pump and a chloride conductance, but no ion-coupled chloride transport, and that the chloride conductance was regulated by protein kinase A. These results, taken together with measurements of chloride effects on ATP-dependent acidification, suggest that endosomal pH can be controlled by phosphorylation of a stilbene-sensitive conductive chloride transporter.\r"

The non-obese diabetic mouse is a good spontaneous animal model of the human disease, with IDDM developing in 50-80% of female mice by the age of 6 months. The disease can be transferred by splenic T cells from diabetic donors and is prevented by T-cell depletion. The mechanism(s) by which the beta cell is specifically destroyed is not known, but T cells and macrophages have both been implicated, based on the presence of macrophages in the infiltrated islet and the ability of chronic silica treatment to prevent disease. The monoclonal antibody 5C6 is specific for the myelomonocytic adhesion-promoting type-3 complement receptor (CR3 or CD11b/CD18) and does not bind to T cells. Here we show that blockade of macrophage CR3 in vivo prevents intra-islet infiltration by both macrophages and T cells and inhibits development of IDDM. We conclude that both T cells and macrophages have an essential role in the onset of IDDM.\r"

  ".U": "91066948\r", 
  ".W": "The pronounced response by mouse T cells to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens of the same species is characterized by a relatively large fraction of responding cells. Responses to MHC class I allelles of other species are, however, generally much weaker. T lymphocytes are positively selected on thymic MHC antigens, resulting in a T-cell repertoire with strong alloreactivity. This has been explained in terms of a mouse T-cell repertoire that is not efficiently selected for recognition of HLA molecules owing to the absence of HLA in mice. Here we show that mice transgenic for HLA mount a T-cell response against allogeneic HLA that is no better than in normal mice. We decided instead to test whether the mouse accessory molecule Lyt-2 on cytotoxic T lymphocytes could interact efficiently with the alpha 3 domain of HLA. To do this, we replaced the alpha 3 domain of HLA-B27 by a murine alpha 3 domain in a gene construct used to produce transgenic mice, and then used the spleen cells from these mice to stimulate normal mouse T cells. Under these conditions cytotoxic T lymphocytes were generated with the same frequency against xenogeneic HLA-B27 determinants as against allogeneic mouse class I antigens. These findings indicate that the normally weak xeno-MHC response is due to the inefficient interaction of the murine Lyt-2 accessory molecule with HLA class I, and not to limitations of the mouse T-cell repertoire.\r"

  ".W": "The symbiotic bacterium Rhizobium meliloti stimulates alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) roots to undergo morphogenesis and form nitrogen-fixing nodules. It has been proposed that the bacterial genes nodABC, common to all Rhizobium, are required for synthesis of an oligosaccharide factor, which is converted to a sulphated form (NodRm-1) by the products of the R. meliloti-specific genes nodH and nodQ1-5; NodRm-1 elicits host-specific plant responses. Previously we have shown that the nodP gene is homologous to a segment of the Escherichia coli genome; when we cloned this E. coli fragment we found that it mapped near 59 minutes, corresponding to the cysDNC locus. The genes cysD and cysN encode proteins that catalyse the synthesis of adenosine 5'-phosphosulphate, the first step in the activation of inorganic sulphate. Here we demonstrate that nodP and nodQ correspond to cysD and cysN, and that their proteins have ATP sulphurylase activity both in vivo and in vitro. We propose that nodP and nodQ synthesize an activated sulphate that is an intermediate in the formation of the alfalfa-specific sulphated nodRm-1 factor.\r"

Here we describe two classes of activating mutations in the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR). A single point mutation in the exoplasmic domain enables it to induce hormone-independent cell growth and tumorigenesis after expression in nontumorigenic, interleukin-3-dependent haematopoietic cells. A C-terminal truncation in the cytoplasmic domain of the EPOR renders the receptor hyperresponsive to erythropoietin, but is insufficient to induce hormone-independent growth or tumorigenicity. The activating point mutation retards intracellular transport and turnover of the receptor. These alterations in metabolism and tumorigenicity caused by the EPOR with activating point mutations are similar to those observed in erythropoietin-independent activation of the wild type EPOR by association with gp55, the Friend spleen focus-forming virus glycoprotein.\r"

  ".W": "Specific genes can be inactivated or mutated in the mouse germ line. The phenotypic consequences of the mutation can provide pivotal information on the function of the gene in development and maintenance of the mammalian organism. The procedure entails homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells, which, on fusion to recipient blastocysts, give rise to chimaeric mice that can transmit the mutant gene to their offspring. Inbreeding can then yield mice carrying the mutation in both alleles allowing the phenotypic analysis of recessive mutations. In addition to mice lacking a particular gene function, cell lines carrying null alleles of normally expressed genes can be instrumental in assessing the function of the gene. These cell lines can either be obtained from homozygous animals or, should the mutation be lethal early in embryonic development, be generated by consecutive inactivation of both alleles by homologous recombination in cultured cells. Here we illustrate the feasibility of this latter approach by the efficient consecutive inactivation of both alleles of the pim-1 proto-oncogene in embryonic stem cells.\r"

  ".U": "91066953\r", 
  ".W": "Several invertebrate species possess haemoglobins in which each polypeptide contains multiple haem-binding domains, possibly reflecting the fusion of multiple monomeric globin transcriptional units at the gene level. We have now analysed the transcript of such a polymeric globin gene from the brine shrimp Artemia, which expresses three polymeric haemoglobins, each of relative molecular mass 260,000 (Mr 260K). These are formed by the variable association of two different subunit types, alpha and beta (refs 2,3). Haemoglobins I and III are homodimers of alpha and beta subunit types, respectively, and haemoglobin II is a heterodimer (alpha beta). The individual globin chains are of similar size (Mr 130K), but the exact nature of the differences between the two subunit types is unclear. Analysis of complementary DNA clones encoding one of the subunits of the Artemia dimeric haemoglobin showed that the globin messenger RNA encodes nine myoglobin-like domains, connected by linking peptides. The residues in the linkers are characteristic of those found generally in such protein linkers, and include turn-promoting amino acids. Each domain also contains the conserved residues that are required for functional haem-binding, and from analysis of the sequences it was predicted that they all can adopt the classic myoglobin-like fold. Analysis of the derived amino-acid sequences indicated that the individual domains are duplicated monomers that fused to form the polymeric globin some 200 Myr ago. The fusion of multiple transcriptional units for the evolution of a polymeric globin gene may have been a general mechanism for the appearance of such polymeric haemoglobins in invertebrates.\r"

In all cases, the anterior chamber reformed within 24 hours after the symblepharon ring was used. Advantages of using the ring are: (a) it permits testing of visual acuity, tonometry, and intraocular examination without removing it; (b) it does not require suturing to the conjunctiva; (c) it does not disturb the corneal epithelium; (d) it may be available at institutions lacking other shells; and (e) it is cost-effective.\r"

Such detachments can occur because: 1) the scleral buckle is not properly positioned beneath the original break; 2) the buckle is not high enough; 3) the break is elevated off the buckle due to progressive vitreous traction; 4) there are new breaks; and 5) chorioretinal adhesion is insufficient. Techniques that may be useful for reattaching the retina in these cases include: 1) adding scleral buckling material to augment the original buckle; 2) modifying the existing buckle without adding new material; 3) replacing the original buckle with other material; 4) re-treating inadequately closed breaks; and 5) combinations of these four techniques. Vitrectomy may be avoided in many cases.\r"

Electroretinography data showed some variations, but no toxicity at the highest dose (320 micrograms). When efficacy was evaluated in vitro against Candida albicans, the minimal inhibitory concentration was 2.50 micrograms/mL, using Sabouraud's broth or M3 medium. The minimal fungicidal concentration was 5 micrograms/mL with Sabouraud's broth, and 10 micrograms/mL with M3 medium.

Although there were nine microperforations in group 1 and none in group 2, the postoperative refractions and uncorrected visual acuities were similar in both groups.

I refer to this participation as \"participatory communication.\" It is based on two fundamental tenets: 1) Everyone in a community has some special knowledge to contribute to the development of the health of that community; and 2) No person is superior to another. Subsequent to sociological and anthropological studies of communities in the Southern Sudan by the Norwegian Church Aid, the Norwegian Association of the Blind and Partially-Sighted conducted village workshops based on this concept.\r"

Problems with lens decentration, tilt, or scleral suture-related infections were minimal. Glaucoma was the msot common cause of decreased vision in patients with 10 or more months' follow-up.

Autogenous fascia lata can be harvested with scissors through a 15-mm incision parallel to relaxed skin-tension lines, placed over the middle of the iliotibial tract. Lacrimal bypass operations can be performed well and with good cosmesis through a 12 to 15-mm skin wound if the above principles are followed.\r"

  ".W": "In a previous study, allodynia to cold and vibratory stimuli was found in the finger stumps of 24 patients with amputations, control values being obtained from fingers of the intact contralateral hand. When treated with regional intravenous guanethidine block (RGB), some of the patients only had short-lasting relief of symptoms, whereas others experienced a more long-lasting beneficial effect. In the present long-term follow-up study the patients were re-examined 6 years after the RGB treatment. The aim was to investigate whether the earlier symptoms and signs persisted, and whether there were any differences in these respects, between patients with long-lasting (group 1) and short-lasting relief of symptoms after RGB (group 2). All 24 patients were asked to answer a questionnaire concerning their clinical symptoms. In addition, 14 of them visited the laboratory for determination of thermal and vibration-induced pain thresholds. Comparisons were made with values obtained at the first examination before RGB treatment and with values from 14 healthy subjects tested in a similar way on 2 occasions with an interval of 8 years. Twenty of 23 patients reported that cold exposure still evoked stump pain. However, the threshold measurements showed that with time the patients had become more tolerant to thermal stimuli not only in the injured but also in the uninjured hand. A rise in pain threshold was also observed when vibration-induced pain was tested in the injured hand. There was no significant difference between groups 1 and 2. Similar changes in pain thresholds with time were not observed in the group of healthy control subjects.\r"

Standard measures of pain, illness intrusiveness, and quality of life were obtained on 2 occasions, each 6 weeks apart, from 100 end-stage renal disease patients. The impact of recurrent muscle cramps on perceptions of illness intrusiveness was conditional upon the occurrence of headache symptoms. Perceptions of illness intrusiveness were significantly higher when both muscle cramp and headache symptoms occurred during one or more assessment intervals as compared to when muscle cramps or headaches, only, occurred. Illness-related concerns and general feelings of pessimism were also significantly higher among patients who experienced recurrent episodes of muscle cramp. Although no direct relations were observed between pain and other quality of life indicators, previous research has documented a relation between illness intrusiveness and quality of life. Recurrent pain problems, thus, appear to contribute to increased illness intrusiveness and to reduced quality of life in end-stage renal disease patients.\r"

The subscale structure of the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC) was factorially replicated in our sample. Three unique MHLC profile clusters were identified for both males and females. Among men, cluster assignment was related to age only. The younger male patients reported a stronger internal attributional style. Older male patients relied more heavily on both chance and powerful other factors. Among women, cluster assignment was related to the use of coping strategies. For example, patients with high internal scores only, reflecting a strong internal orientation towards self-management of health care needs, were more likely to utilize Information-Seeking, Self-Blame, and Threat Minimization coping strategies than patients with high scores on both the Internal and Powerful Other factors. It appears that the presence of both Internal and Powerful Other health attributional styles is associated with less frequent use of cognitive self-management techniques. In understanding the LOC scores it is important to rely on pattern analysis of scores. Implications for clinical treatment are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Evaluation of pain in neonates is difficult due to their limited means of communication. The aim was to determine whether behavioural reactions of cry and facial activity provoked by an invasive procedure could be discriminated from responses to non-invasive tactile events. Thirty-six healthy full-term infants (mean age 2.2 h) received 3 procedures in counterbalanced order: intramuscular injection, application of triple dye to the umbilical stub, and rubbing thigh with alcohol. Significant effects of procedure were found for total face activity and latency to face movement. A cluster of facial actions comprised of brow bulging, eyes squeezed shut, deepening of the naso-labial furrow and open mouth was associated most frequently with the invasive procedure. Comparisons between the 2 non-invasive procedures showed more facial activity to thigh swabbing and least to application of triple dye to the umbilical cord. Acoustic analysis of cry showed statistically significant differences across procedures only for latency to cry and cry duration for the group as a whole. However, babies who cried to two procedures showed higher pitch and greater intensity to the injection. There were no significant differences in melody, dysphonation, or jitter. Methodological difficulties for investigators in this area were examined, including criteria for the selection of cries for analysis, and the logical and statistical challenges of contrasting cries induced by different conditions when some babies do not always cry. It was concluded that facial expression, in combination with short latency to onset of cry and long duration of first cry cycle typifies reaction to acute invasive procedures.\r"

  ".W": "The possible role of the anterolateral columns (ALCs) and dorsolateral funiculi (DLF) in pain mechanisms was examined from the effects of lesions in these tracts (alone or combined) on tests for chronic deafferentation pain (autotomy) in rats. Spinal lesions alone (i.e., without denervation) in either ALC or DLF or combined DLF-ALC did not lead to any form of self-mutilation behavior. Cervical surgery, without spinal lesion, followed by limb denervation (sham) resulted in similar autotomy characteristics to those observed following limb denervation alone (control). Both results were considered as one set of controls. ALC lesions simultaneous with, or 1-2 weeks prior to limb denervation (ipsilaterally or contralaterally) produced significant delay in onset of autotomy and decrease in percentage of rats showing this behavior. DLF lesions followed by limb denervation produced significant acceleration of onset of autotomy and increase in percentage of rats showing this behavior. Combined DLF-ALC lesions with limb denervation produced intermediate effects between those observed following either ALC or DLF lesions alone. These results give further support to the concept that autotomy is related to rostral transmission of nociceptive information and that a spino-bulbo-spinal inhibitory loop involving the DLF and ALC is triggered by chronic deafferentation pain.\r"

Sheep with foot rot were used to investigate the effect of chronic pain on some receptors thought to be involved in spinal nociceptive processing systems (alpha 2 adrenoceptor and mu and delta opioid receptors). Saturation binding studies showed a variable distribution of [3H] clonidine (alpha 2 adrenoceptor agonist) in the spinal cord of normal sheep. The number of receptors (Bmax) present in areas thought to be involved in nociceptive processing, laminae I and II and lamina X, increased to 131% and 169% of control sheep values respectively in animals exposed to chronic pain. The affinity of the receptors (KD), however, remained unchanged at approximately 2 nM. There was less [3H]DAGO (mu opioid agonist) and [3H]DPDPE (delta opioid agonist) binding in the sheep spinal cord. Both opioid receptor types being mainly located in the superficial dorsal horn. The [3H]DPDPE binding was unchanged in the sheep with foot rot, whilst the number (Bmax), but not the affinity, of the [3H]DAGO binding sites increased in laminae I and II in lame animals to 130% of the control sheep values. Hence, in animals in chronic pain, the number of alpha 2 adrenoceptors and mu opioid receptors increased mainly in areas of the sheep spinal cord associated with nociception.\r"

Chronic (28 day) subcutaneous infusion of clomipramine (CMI) via an Alzet minipump attenuated both central M-and DADLE-induced analgesia by day 15; attenuation persisted for the duration of the infusion (day 29). Within 7 days following removal of the pump, antinociceptive responses to M and DADLE returned to near pre-CMI levels. Our results indicate a similarity between M and DADLE with regard to attenuation of their antinociceptive action by chronic CMI. This attenuation may be due to decreased mu opioid receptor sensitivity or density resulting from chronic tricyclic antidepressant administration.\r"

Both inhibition and facilitation of the TF reflex were produced by electrical stimulation at identical sites in the NGC/NGC alpha; glutamate microinjection only inhibited the TF reflex. The chronaxie of stimulation for inhibition of the TF reflex was 169 +/- 28 microseconds. Inhibition of the TF reflex by stimulation was produced throughout the NGC and NGC alpha; intensities of stimulation for inhibition were least in the ventral NGC and in the NGC alpha. At threshold intensities of stimulation, inhibition of the TF reflex did not outlast the period of stimulation. Facilitation of the TF reflex was produced at many of the same sites at which stimulation inhibited the TF reflex, but always at lesser intensities of stimulation (mean, 10 microA vs. 43 microA for inhibition, n = 25). Stimulation in the NGC/NGC alpha at threshold intensities for facilitation or inhibition of the TF reflex did not significantly affect blood pressure. Strength-duration characterization of electrical stimulation and microinjection of glutamate into identical sites in the NGC and NGC alpha suggest that descending inhibition of the TF reflex results from activation of cell bodies in the NGC and NGC alpha.\r"

  ".W": "Transcutaneous cranial electrical stimulation (TCES) with high frequency (166 kHz) intermittent current (100 Hz: Limoge current) has been used for several years in cardiac, thoracic, abdominal, urological and micro-surgery. The main benefits are a reduced requirement for analgesic drugs, especially opiates, and a long-lasting postoperative analgesia. We have confirmed these clinical observations in rats using the tail-flick latency (TFL) test to measure pain threshold. TCES was not found to modify the pain threshold in drug-free rats, but it potentiated morphine-induced analgesia (systemic injection). To obtain a maximal effect, the stimulation must be initiated 3 h before the drug injection and be maintained throughout the duration of its pharmacological action. TCES potentitation was found to depend on the dose of the drug, the intensity of the current and the polarity of electrodes. These findings were confirmed by blind tests of the efficiency of TCES on several opiate analgesic drugs currently used in human surgery (morphine, fentanyl, alfentanil and dextromoramide). The analgesic effect of these 4 opiates (TFL as % of baseline without or with TCES) were respectively: 174%, 306%; 176%, 336%; 160%, 215%; and 267%, 392%. The results were obtained not only after systemic opiate treatment, but also after intracerebroventricular injection of morphine (10 micrograms; analgesic effect 152%, 207% with TCES) suggesting that TCES potentiation of opiate-induced analgesia is centrally mediated.\r"

Like other hyperalgesic mediators, dibutyryl-cAMP, when applied to the paws, caused an acute effect but did not produce persistent hypersensitivity. The persistent hypersensitive state was not affected by a typical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (indomethacin), was temporarily inhibited by a centrally acting analgesic (morphine), was partially inhibited by a protein synthesis inhibitor (cycloheximide) and abolished by a single dose of peripherally acting analgesics such as dipyrone or N-methyl morphine. Once the residual hypersensitivity had been abolished with dipyrone or N-methyl morphine, a small dose of prostaglandin E2, dopamine or Interleukin-1 beta, which in normal animals causes a mild and short lived effect, restored the persistent hypersensitive state. This ability to restore the persistent effect was not observed with intraplantar administration of dibutyryl-cAMP. Our results suggest the existence of a peripheral trace of inflammatory pain, a phenomenon which may be associated with stimulation of neuronal adenylate cyclase and protein synthesis. This concept may explain part of the puzzle of chronic inflammatory pain and lead to the development of new analgesics.\r"

A model for the effective use of a warning signal in coping with pain posited that a person needs enough time to be able to react and should possess the skills necessary to utilize the time effectively. It was felt that a very short warning period, e.g., 5 sec, could not be long enough, while a 180 sec warning period would in and of itself become aversive. Reactions to electric shock were obtained from 36 paid, volunteer subjects who were each tested on a within-subject, counterbalanced order at 4 different warning periods: 5, 30, 60, and 180 sec. The subjects were divided into 3 groups: (1) the experimental group was provided with a pretested self-instructional booklet to learn a variety of pain control techniques; (2) the placebo group was provided with a self-instructional booklet on citizenship; (3) the control group waited quietly for 13 min. No significant results were obtained for the different pain-coping conditions. Significant differences, however, were obtained for the various warning periods. Maximum skin resistance changes, higher ratings of pain and of anxiety were obtained for the 60 and 180 compared to the 5 and 30 sec warning periods. Maximum heart rate was obtained for the 30 sec warning. Results were discussed in terms of the psychological meaning of the various measures as well as their clinical implications.\r"

  ".W": "US infant mortality continued to decline slowly and the provisional 1989 rate, 9.7 per 1000 live births, was the lowest ever recorded. Final 1988 data showed no change in cause of death distribution or in the wide discrepancy between white and black infant mortality. State rates varied from 6.8 in Vermont to 12.6 in Georgia. Worldwide, the US rate of 10.0 was bettered by 21 other countries, with Japan lowest at 4.8. Births increased in number and rate, because of a higher fertility rate and more women in the childbearing years. The birth rate to mothers 17 years of age and younger increased again. The proportion of women who had no or inadequate prenatal care was essentially unchanged. Deaths, crude death rate, and age-adjusted death rate decreased. The excess of births over deaths added almost 1.9 million persons to the US population, the highest rate of natural increase since 1971. The marriage rate was essentially unchanged, whereas the divorce rate decreased slightly, to the lowest level since 1973. With the exception of human immunodeficiency virus infection, homicide, and pulmonary malignancies, rates for most causes of death declined from 1988 to 1989. In comparison with 1940, most declines were substantial, led by pneumonia, down about 80%, and perinatal conditions, down about 75%. The only large-scale increases among major causes in the half century were in two diseases related to cigarette smoking: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, up eightfold, and respiratory cancer, up almost sixfold. Death rates from all other cancers, as a group, decreased by some 20% and from cardiovascular diseases by some 60%.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether the tetracaine component traditionally used in tetracaine-adrenaline-cocaine (TAC) is necessary to obtain effective topical anesthesia, a prospective study was performed to compare TAC and adrenaline-cocaine preparations for the repair of facial lacerations in children. Physicians were \"blind\" to which preparation was being used. Of 55 patients studied, 24 received TAC (103 sutures placed) and 31 received adrenaline-cocaine (151 sutures placed). The anesthetic efficacy of each preparation was approximately 95%; there were no adverse reactions related to administration of either medication or complications of wound healing noted in either group. The tetracaine component of TAC is superfluous for obtaining topical anesthesia of minor dermal lacerations of the face in children. The TAC formulation can be simplified by omitting tetracaine without compromising anesthetic efficacy.\r"

  ".W": "Homeless children in families are increasing in numbers across the country and have been noted to have frequent health problems. The health status of homeless children was assessed on multiple dimensions through parental report in a survey conducted with 196 homeless families in 10 shelters in Los Angeles and 194 housed poor families after March 1987 through January 1988. During the month before the survey, the homeless and housed poor children experienced high rates of illness symptoms, disability, and bed days. Homeless and housed poor children were frequently rated by their parents to be in fair or poor health (17% vs 13%, P = .14). Homeless children, however, were reported to have more behavior problems and school failure [30% vs 18%, P = .06] than housed poor children. Homeless children also had high rates of other health problems such as developmental delay (9%) and overweight (13%). The diets of homeless children were frequently imbalanced, dependent on food from \"fast-food\" restaurants, and characterized by repeated periods of deprivation. Family problems were more common among homeless families, especially among single-parent homeless families compared with single-parent housed families (spousal abuse, 68% vs 41%, P less than .01; parental drug and alcohol abuse, 60% vs 39%, P less than .01). It is concluded that homeless children have significant child behavior and developmental problems and disorders of nutrition and growth, which are associated with multiple risk factors in their environment.\r"

Fifty-seven percent of varicella admissions occurred in the most junior military members, aged 17 to 20. More than half of the total varicella admissions occurred in personnel with less than a year of military service. Multivariate analysis of the navy data confirmed increasing time-related trends of risk, suggesting a national temporal trend of increased varicella susceptibility in US teenagers and young adults. Administering a safe and effective varicella vaccine to army and navy recruits could prevent more than 7260 hospital-bed days during the first year of use.\r"

The sequencing of breast-feeding and diarrheal morbidity events was carefully examined in a longitudinal analysis which allowed for the examination of age-specific effects of feeding patterns. Because the work controlled for a wide range of environmental causes of diarrhea, the results can be generalized to other populations with some confidence. The addition to the breast-milk diet of even water, teas, and other nonnutritive liquids doubled or tripled the likelihood of diarrhea. Supplementation of breast-feeding with additional nutritive foods or liquids further increased significantly the risk of diarrhea; most benefits of breast-feeding alone or in combination with nutritive foods/liquids became small during the second half of infancy. Benefits of breast-feeding were slightly greater in urban environments.\r"

The superwarfarins are used widely in the United States as rodenticides and are effective against warfarin-resistant strains of rats. A chronic accidental ingestion of one of these products, brodifacoum, by a 7-year-old child who had bleeding and laboratory evidence suggestive of a vitamin K-related coagulopathy is reported. The bleeding manifestations were severe and prolonged, requiring 13 months for normalization of coagulation times. With a negative history of ingestion and despite clinical suspicion, documentation of superwarfarin poisoning was hampered by the lack of readily available assays for these compounds, even from the manufacturers. Brodifacoum was also identified in rat feces from the family home. This finding raises the concern of poisoning not only from ingestion of brodifacoum particles themselves, but also from a fecal-oral route. A review of the literature is presented and the implications of this case for the practicing physician are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Marfan syndrome is infrequently diagnosed early in infancy. The experience of the authors with 22 severely affected infants diagnosed as having Marfan syndrome in the first 3 months of life is described and the literature on 32 additional infants with Marfan syndrome is reviewed. It was found that serious cardiac pathology (82% of the patients described in the article, 94% of those described in the literature) may be present at birth, and that congenital contractures (64% of our cases, 47% of literature cases) are often an associated finding. Other useful clinical findings included arachnodactyly, dolichocephaly, a characteristic facies, a high-arched palate, micrognathia, hyperextensible joints, pes planus, anterior chest deformity, iridodenesis, megalocornea, and dislocated lenses. Echocardiography was useful as a noninvasive method for defining the extent of cardiovascular involvement and following its course. Characteristic cardiac findings in early life included mitral valve prolapse, valvular regurgitation, and aortic root dilation. Cardiac function ranged from normal to poor, with a tendency to worsen. Of the 22 cases 3 infants died during the first year of life. Morbidity and mortality may be high when Marfan syndrome is diagnosed during infancy, and prompt recognition of this phenotype can facilitate management and counseling. Most such severe cases appear to be due to a sporadic mutation in a single germ cell of one parent. Many familial cases may have milder manifestations, be more difficult to detect during infancy, and have a better prognosis.\r"

A total of 3998 students (69%) in a rural midwestern community in grades 7 to 12 participated in the study. Almost 20% of the students reported some form of physical and/or sexual abuse, with more girls than boys reporting sexual abuse (chi 2 = 48.5, P less than .001). Some problem behaviors (alcohol use) and emotions (trouble sleeping, difficulty with anger) were common among all adolescents and some were strongly associated with a history of abuse (especially, considering or attempting suicide, running away, laxative use, and vomiting to lose weight). Higher emotional and behavioral risk scores among abused students were confirmed. The effects of physical and sexual abuse on risk scores were independent and additive; no interaction was observed. An interaction of gender and sexual abuse on problem behavior was observed, with problem behavior being significantly greater among sexually abused boys. The results confirm increased risk of problem behaviors and negative feelings among abused adolescents when compared with nonabused peers, and better define influences of gender and abuse type on emotional and behavioral risks.\r"

  ".W": "The capacity for greater fat absorption relative to carbohydrate absorption in protracted diarrhea of infancy was studied in a developed and a developing country (Buffalo, NY, and Bangkok, Thailand). Fifty patients with protracted diarrhea in the first year of life (defined as liquid stools of more than 20 mL/kg per day with more than a 14-day duration) were randomly assigned to receive either a standard semielemental diet (Pregestimil) or a high-fat semielemental diet that contained 40% more fat. The increased fat was largely in the form of medium-chain triglycerides, with the new diet providing 60% of the fat as medium-chain triglycerides compared with 40% in the standard diet. Tolerance to both diets was good in both studies. Both groups showed adequate weight gain and an improvement in anthropometric and biochemical parameters. The patients receiving the high-fat diet showed no initial weight loss, however, and their weight gain was initiated earlier. Cumulative weight gain was also higher in the group receiving the high-fat semielemental diet. Fecal fat analyses were performed after 1 week of therapy. There was no difference observed in the coefficient of fat absorption between the groups receiving the two formulas, indicating that infants with protracted diarrhea may be able to tolerate a higher fat intake than is normally provided. As carbohydrate intolerance is known to be a complicating factor when using semielemental enteral feeds for infants with protracted diarrhea, a higher-fat semielemental diet may be the most appropriate way to provide adequate caloric intake.\r"

The two groups of infants had similar birth weights (900 to 1500 g) and gestational ages (26 to 32 weeks). The study was initiated at a mean age of 19 days when the infants tolerated full feeding volumes and lasted for a mean time of 28 days. Mean protein intake values were 2.1 +/- 0.3 and 3.6 +/- 0.3 g/kg per day (mean +/- SD) and weight gain values were 26.6 +/- 7.4 and 35.1 +/- 3.6 g/day in the protein-unenriched and the protein-enriched groups of infants, respectively. Human milk protein enrichment resulted in significantly increased concentrations of all plasma amino acids except serine, taurine, and histidine. Most urine amino acid concentrations correlated with protein intake and with the plasma concentrations, suggesting that the effects of protein quality and quantity can be evaluated by measuring urinary amino acid concentrations alone, thereby making such studies less invasive. Infants fed protein-unenriched human milk had growth rates below the estimated intrauterine rate as well as low plasma and urine amino acid concentrations, indicating suboptimal protein intake levels. When the plasma concentrations of the essential amino acids in the protein-enriched infants from the present study were compared with concentrations found in the literature in fetal and umbilical cord plasma, both were found to be much higher.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Significant positive correlations were found between mean protein intake and concentrations of 7 of the plasma proteins studied (transthyretin, retinol-binding protein, and transferrin: P less than .001; vitamin D-binding protein and apolipoprotein B: P less than .01; albumin and apolipoprotein A I: P less than .05). A weak negative correlation with mean protein intake was seen for the plasma level of orosomucoid, whereas no significant correlations were found for the plasma concentrations of fibronectin and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin. Protein intake, not energy intake, constituted the main contribution to the changes in the concentrations of transthyretin, retinol-binding protein, and transferrin. The levels of plasma transthyretin and transferrin were also strongly correlated with weight and length growth of the infants during the study as well as with other indicators of protein nutritional status such as preprandial concentrations of plasma amino acids and serum and urine urea. These data indicate that of the 11 plasma proteins studied, transthyretin, transferrin, and retinol-binding protein are the most suitable to evaluate protein nutritional status in very low birth weight infants.\r"

Improvement with medication on the Conners Hyperactivity Index was observed in 75% of subjects. Significant increases in work output, on-task behavior, and attentional skills were associated with methylphenidate. However, gains in measures of attention were not associated with improvement in learning, as measured by a paired associate learning task. Additionally, no significant increases in appropriate social interactions during free play were associated with methylphenidate. The results suggest that mentally retarded children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder respond to methylphenidate at similar rates and in similar domains to that of the nonretarded population.\r"

However, only a few reports on a small number of children have appeared in the literature. From March 1988 to March 1989, 11 children and adolescents were treated with IL-2. They included 1 patient with hepatocellular carcinoma, 1 with hepatoblastoma, 6 with childhood atopic dermatitis, and 3 with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. The dosages ranged from 10,000 to 50,000 U/kg every 8 hours by intravenous drip. The following side effects were observed: anorexia, fever, and chillness (100%), general malaise (82%), irritability (64%), diarrhea (100%), nausea and vomiting (73%), weight gain (82%), edema (82%), abdominal distension (73%), oliguria (82%), cough (91%), dyspnea (27%), pleural effusion (40%), hypotension (82%), skin eruption (82%), oral ulcer (18%), enlarged liver (73%) liver function abnormalities (82%), renal function impairment (36%), electrolyte imbalance (73%), anemia (91%), thrombocytopenia (54%), leukopenia (18%), and eosinophilia (73%). Immunologically, numbers of natural killer cells were increased and natural killer and lymphokine-activated killer cell activities were augmented after IL-2 treatment. There was a tendency for serum levels of IL-2 and receptor IL-2 to decrease, especially in patients with atopic eczema. Ten patients (91%) completed one course (9 to 12 days) of therapy, and the remaining patient interrupted the treatment because of intolerable adverse effects. Clinically, complete remission for 3 months was obtained in 1 juvenile rheumatoid arthritis patient, transient improvement (2 to 6 weeks) in all atopic dermatitis patients, minor response in the hepatoblastoma patient, and no response in the patient with hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "During a recent 5-year period, 74 patients younger than 6 months of age were diagnosed with coarctation of the aorta. Coarctation was correctly diagnosed in only 22% of patients prior to referral despite readily apparent femoral pulse abnormalities in 86%. Infants whose symptoms were detected between 5 and 14 days of age were significantly more ill than infants outside this age range and had a high mortality rate (25%). The number of associated cardiac defects was not related to the severity of clinical illness in this group, suggesting that closure of the ductus arteriosus is the primary determinate of disease severity. Observations in two patients suggested that a detectable pulse discrepancy occurs between 3 and 5 days postnatally. Upper extremity hypertension was found commonly in infants after 5 days of age despite the presence of congestive heart failure. Earlier detection of coarctation in the newborn requires a diligent cardiovascular and peripheral pulse examination between 3 and 7 days of life, upper extremity and lower extremity blood pressure measurement, and a high index of suspicion.\r"

  ".W": "In this report, an 11-year-old boy with diffuse tendinous and tuberous xanthomatosis and a plasma sterol concentration of 555 mg/dL, consisting primarily of cholesterol, is described. Three months after changing from an unrestricted diet to a cholesterol-lowering diet, his plasma sterol concentration decreased to 221 mg/dL. Because of the degree and rapidity of his response to diet, sitosterolemia was suspected. According to results of capillary gas-liquid chromatography of his plasma sterols, there was a sitosterol concentration of 31.3 mg/dL (normal less than 1.0 mg/dL), establishing the diagnosis of sitosterolemia. Addition of cholestyramine therapy (8 g/d) to a low sterol diet further lowered his plasma sterol concentration to 173 mg/dL and led to complete regression of all tuberous xanthomata. Tendinous xanthomata regressed at a slower rate. These findings show that the diagnosis of sitosterolemia should be suspected in severely hypercholesterolemic children (total cholesterol greater than 400 mg/dL) whose plasma cholesterol level is highly responsive to dietary manipulation. The rapid and sustained lowering of plasma cholesterol and regression of xanthomata after treatment with diet and cholestyramine suggest that sitosterolemia is a treatable cause of premature atherosclerosis.\r"

Gel-shift assays (using the DNA fragment -212 to -88) revealed that the transcriptional factor Sp1 could bind to this region of the 5-lipoxygenase promoter.

With such a supercoiling assay, an activity capable of ATP-dependent, positive supercoiling of DNA in the presence of bacterial DNA topoisomerase I was found in 7S particles prepared from Xenopus laevis oocytes but not in purified transcription factor IIIA. The positive supercoils accumulated during the reaction are strained, as evidenced by their sensitivity to eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase I. Purification of this activity led to the identification of a DNA-dependent ATPase. Molar excess of transcription factor IIIA or spermidine was found to strongly stimulate the supercoiling reaction of the purified ATPase. These results suggest that this DNA-dependent ATPase can interact with and translocate along closed-circular duplex DNA, producing local alterations in the supercoiled state of the DNA template in a manner analogous to that of simian virus 40 large tumor antigen.\r"

Yeast appear to have diverged considerably earlier. It is argued that previous analyses indicating that D. discoideum diverged before yeast were misleading because of the nature of the small ribosomal subunit rRNA sequences used in these studies.

  ".W": "The human immunodeficiency viruses (HIVs) types 1 and 2 have similar genetic organization but differ significantly in nucleic acid sequence. Although infection by either agent leads to symptoms of immunodeficiency, recent studies suggest potential differences in the time course and severity of these diseases. In this report, the transcriptional regulation and induction of these retroviruses were analyzed. We report that the regulation of HIV-2 differs from that of HIV-1: a distinct T-cell activation pathway, triggering of the CD3 component of the T-cell receptor complex, stimulates HIV-2 but not HIV-1 gene expression. The response to T-cell receptor stimulation in HIV-2 is mediated partly by an upstream regulatory element, termed CD3R, which is recognized by a sequence-specific DNA binding protein, NF-CD3R. Jurkat T leukemia cell lines containing HIV-2 provirus also showed increased viral replication after stimulation of the T-cell receptor complex, in contrast to HIV-1. These findings suggest that transcriptional regulation and induction of HIV-2 differ from HIV-1 and raise the possibility that different cofactors contribute to the activation of HIV-1- and HIV-2-associated AIDS.\r"

We have found that a single point mutation within the ATP-binding pocket of the tyrosine kinase domain in this truncated molecule can increase the ability of this oncogene to induce anchorage-independent growth of fibroblasts in vitro and fibrosarcoma formation in vivo. Associated with this increased transforming potential is a corresponding increase in the kinase activity of the mutant erbB protein product. The mutation, which converts a valine to isoleucine at position 157 of the insertionally activated c-erbB product, is at a residue that is highly conserved within the protein kinase family. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a point mutation in the ATP-binding pocket that activates a tyrosine kinase.\r"

Proteolytic fragments generated by various endoproteases were probed by immunoprecipitation with several sequence-specific antibodies to determine the site of labeling within the primary structure of alpha 1. These results restrict the site of photolabeling by [N-methyl-3H]LU49888 to the region between Glu-1349 and Trp-1391. This segment of alpha 1 contains transmembrane helix S6 of domain IV and the beginning of the long intracellular C-terminal tail. Because of the phenylalkylamine receptor site is only accessible from the intracellular side of the Ca2+ channel, we propose that the intracellular end of helix IVS6 and the adjacent intracellular amino acid residues play an essential role in formation of the phenylalkylamine receptor site. The action of the phenylalkylamines as open-channel blockers suggests that this region may also contribute to formation of the intracellular opening of the transmembrane pore of the Ca2+ channel.\r"

It is well established that substratum has a dramatic effect on morphology and function of mammary cells. The molecular mechanisms that regulate the ECM- and hormone-dependent gene expression, however, have not been resolved. To address this question, a subpopulation (designated CID 9) of the mouse mammary epithelial cell strain COMMA-1D has been developed in which more than 35% of the cells express beta-casein, form alveoli-like structures when plated onto a reconstituted basement membrane, and secrete beta-casein unidirectionally into a lumen. These cells were stably transfected with a series of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) fusion genes to study transcriptional regulation of the bovine beta-casein gene. The expression of CAT in these lines demonstrated a striking matrix and hormone dependency (greater than 150-fold induction in some cases). This regulation occurred primarily at the transcriptional level and was dependent on the length of the 5' flanking region of the beta-casein promotor. Both matrix and hormonal control of transcription occurred within at least the first 1790 base pairs upstream and/or 42 base pairs downstream of the transcriptional initiation site. The ECM effect was independent of glucocorticoid stimulation. However, prolactin was essential and hydrocortisone further increased CAT expression. Endogenous beta-casein expression in these lines was similar to that of the parent CID 9 cells. Our data indicate the existence of matrix-dependent elements that regulate transcription.\r"

These long inverted repeats (LIRs) occur within the alpha and beta origins of replication and are essential for origin function. In this study, primer-extension analysis of DNA modified in vivo by dimethyl sulfate or KMnO4 revealed that both alpha and beta LIRs acquire similar structural distortions of the DNA helix in a functional R6K replicon. These distortions were not seen in plasmids containing isolated LIR sequences. In the functional replicon, the dimethyl sulfate and KMnO4 hyperreactive sites appear on complementary strands and are located to one side of an internal palindromic sequence within the LIRs. This asymmetry coincides with the primary direction of DNA replication from alpha and beta origins in vivo. We also observed two intermediate structures when certain R6K cis- or trans-acting elements are missing. Sequences near the alpha origin are required for generation of the dimethyl sulfate hyperreactive sites, whereas sequences near the beta origin are responsible for the appearance of KMnO4 hyperreactive sites. We suggest that these structures represent a hierarchy that leads to a \"locked\" preinitiation complex, which functions to synchronize and determine the direction of replication from the alpha and beta replication origins in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "91067660\r", 
  ".W": "The src genes of four natural isolates of avian sarcoma viruses differ from cellular proto-src in two genetic substitutions: the promoter of the cellular gene is replaced by a retroviral counterpart, and at least six codons from the 3' terminus are replaced by retroviral or heterologous cell-derived elements. Since virus constructs with a complete proto-src coding region failed to transform avian cells but acquired transforming function by point mutations of various codons, it has been proposed that point mutation is sufficient to convert proto-src to a transforming gene. However, promoter substitution is sufficient to convert two other proto-onc genes, proto-ras and proto-myc, to retroviral transforming genes. In view of this, we have reexamined whether promoter substitution, point mutation, or both are necessary to convert proto-src into a retroviral transforming gene. It was found that a recombinant virus (RpSV), in which the src gene of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) was replaced by the complete coding region of proto-src, transformed quail and chicken embryo cells. The oncogene of RpSV differs from the src gene of RSV in three genetic properties: (i) it is weaker--e.g., transformed cells are flatter; (ii) it is slower--e.g., focus formation takes 9 to 12 days compared to 4 days for RSV; and (iii) its host range is narrower than that of RSV--e.g., only subsets of heterogeneous embryo cells are transformed by RpSV even after weeks or months. Replacement of the proto-src 3' terminus of RpSV by that of src from RSV generates a recombinant virus (RpvSV) that equals RSV in transforming function. It is concluded that a retroviral promoter, naturally substituted via illegitimate recombination with retroviruses, is sufficient to convert at least three proto-onc genes, src, myc, and ras, to retroviral transforming genes.\r"

The receptor gene is located on human chromosome 8. The human receptors expressed in CHO-K1 cells mediated endocytosis of modified low density lipoproteins. Two mRNAs, 4.0 and 3.2 kilobases, have been detected in human liver, placenta, and brain.

Diverse opinion are held as to why the index yields unclear results when applied instead to the polypeptide sequences of the T-cell antigen receptor. We show that a simple modification enhances the resolving power of the index by increasing the weight on the frequency distribution of the amino acids in the formula. Application of the improved index to T-cell receptor beta chains highlights four unambiguous hypervariable regions, three of which are positioned similar to immunoglobulin complementarity-determining regions along the chain. In a Fab-like three-dimensional model of the T-cell receptor, the four hypervariable regions coincide with the four loops on the surface of the domain and form a contiguous area available for binding.\r"

In this report, we have used polysome profile analysis, peptide quantitation, and immunocytochemistry to show that proenkephalin products are synthesized during spermatogenesis and are retained within spermatozoa of humans, hamsters, rats, and sheep. We further show that these peptides are stored in the sperm acrosome and are depleted from sperm following the acrosome reaction, an exocytotic event required for fertilization. Proenkephalin products thus may serve a dual function as sperm acrosomal factors released during the fertilization process as well as intratesticular regulators secreted by spermatogenic cells.\r"

In the latter assay recombinant yeast TFIID, expressed in and purified from bacteria, was sufficient to prevent nucleosome assembly-mediated repression and to mediate transcriptional enhancement of the adenovirus major late promoter by the gene-specific activator USF. In contrast, recombinant yeast TFIID was unable to mediate activation by USF in the system reconstituted only with purified general factors. Under the same conditions a partially purified natural yeast TFIID was able to mediate activation by both USF and Sp1 (assayed with the human immunodeficiency virus promoter), but to a lesser extent than observed with a partially purified natural human TFIID. The implications of these findings are discussed with respect to the structure of the yeast and human TATA factors and the possible involvement either of specific TFIID modifications or of coactivators.\r"

Using a reconstituted in vitro system comprised of purified RNA polymerase II, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, and TFIIF, we found that TFIIG was essential for specific initiation from all class II genes tested. In this system TFIIA could partially replace TFIIG; however, even at saturating concentrations of TFIIA, addition of TFIIG further stimulated transcription. Since the chromatographic properties of TFIIG differed significantly from those of TFIIA, we concluded that TFIIA and TFIIG are distinct but functionally related transcription factors. Heparin challenge assays showed that TFIIG is required for the assembly of a functional preinitiation complex. However, it must act after template commitment by TFIID, since this step did not require, and was unaffected by, either TFIIG or TFIIA.\r"

TFIIE-alpha had an independent TFIIE activity whereas TFIIE-beta had no activity alone but enhanced the activity of TFIIE-alpha. In conjunction with gel filtration studies, which indicated a molecular mass of approximately 180 kDa for the native protein, these results suggested that TFIIE is a heterotetramer containing two alpha and two beta polypeptides. Functional studies with the purified TFIIE demonstrated that it is a general initiation factor, required for all of the genes tested, but it failed to show any DNA-dependent ATPase activity.\r"

Both basal and induced transcription of the metallothionein gene require TFIID and a functional TATA binding site. Crude human and mouse TFIID fractions, prepared from mammalian cells, respond to stimulation by ACE1. In contrast, human and yeast TFIID proteins expressed from the cloned genes do not respond to ACE1, except in the presence of wheat germ or yeast total cell extracts.

We have created a transgenic mouse strain that carries the activated v-Ha-ras oncogene fused to the promoter of the mouse embryonic alpha-like, zeta-globin gene. Unexpectedly, these animals developed papillomas at areas of epidermal abrasion and, because abrasion can also serve as a tumor-promoting event in mutagen-treated mouse skin, we tested these mice for their ability to respond to phorbol ester application. Within 6 weeks virtually all treated carrier mice had developed multiple papillomas, some of which went on to develop squamous cell carcinomas and, more frequently, underlying sarcomas. We conclude that the oncogene \"preinitiates\" carrier mice, replacing the initiation/mutagenesis step and immediately sensitizing them to the action of tumor promoters. In addition, treatment of the mice with retinoic acid dramatically delays, reduces, and often completely inhibits the appearance of promoter-induced papillomas. This strain has use in screening tumor promoters and for assessing antitumor and antiproliferative agents.\r"

Transgenic tobacco plants which expressed luciferase uniformly in all areas of the leaf, and assays for luciferin, demonstrated that luciferin rapidly penetrates all regions of a tobacco leaf in at least two dimensions. Depending on the test gene structure or, presumably, on the transferred DNA (T-DNA) insertional context, other transgenic plants were obtained that expressed luciferase with a wide range of nonuniform patterns from nominally the same cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. For instance, the veins can be dark, while only the interveinal regions of the leaf lamina glow, or only the small capillary veins glow, or only the major veins glow. Local and/or systemic induction in response to wounding was also demonstrated.\r"

More than 30 yr ago it was suggested that the large amounts of DNA in purulent secretions contribute to its viscosity and that bovine pancreatic DNase I could reduce the viscosity. To evaluate the potential clinical utility of recombinant human DNase I (rhDNase) in the treatment of cystic fibrosis, we have cloned, sequenced, and expressed rhDNase. Catalytic amounts of rhDNase greatly reduce the viscosity of purulent cystic fibrosis sputum, transforming it within minutes from a nonflowing viscous gel to a flowing liquid. The reduction in viscosity is associated with a decrease in size of DNA in the sputum. Inhalation of a rhDNase aerosol may be a simple direct approach that will help individuals with cystic fibrosis and other patients with pneumonia or bronchitis to clear their airways of purulent secretions.\r"

Each of 11 cytological characteristics of breast fine-needle aspirates reported to differ between benign and malignant samples was graded 1 to 10 at the time of sample collection. Nine characteristics were found to differ significantly between benign and malignant samples. Mathematically, these values for each sample were represented by a point in a nine-dimensional space of real variables. Benign points were separated from malignant ones by planes determined by linear programming. Correct separation was accomplished in 369 of 370 samples (201 benign and 169 malignant). In the one misclassified malignant case, the fine-needle aspirate cytology was so definitely benign and the cytology of the excised cancer so definitely malignant that we believe the tumor was missed on aspiration. Our mathematical method is applicable to other medical diagnostic and decision-making problems.\r"

These cells were labeled with [3H]inositol and the incorporation of radioactivity into inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate [Ins(1,4,5)P3] was analyzed and found to be higher than in control cells. In contrast, the total mass of Ins(1,4,5)P3, as assessed with an assay using a specific Ins(1,4,5)P3-binding protein, was not significantly different between control and Dd-ras-Thr12 cells. Cells were labeled with [3H]inositol and the incorporation of radioactivity in all inositol metabolites was analyzed. Increased levels of radioactivity were observed for phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PtdInsP), phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PtdInsP2), Ins(1,4,5)P3, inositol 1,4-bisphosphate, inositol 4,5-bisphosphate, and inositol 4-monophosphate in Dd-ras-Thr12 cells relative to control cells. Decreased levels were found for phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) and inositol 1-monophosphate. Calculations on the substrate/product relationships [i.e., Ins(1,4,5)P3/PtdInsP2] demonstrate that the observed differences are due only to the increased conversion of PtdIns to PtdInsP; other enzyme reactions, including phospholipase C, are not significantly different between the cell lines. The activity of PtdIns kinase in vitro is not different between Dd-ras-Thr12 and control cells, suggesting that either the regulation of this enzyme is altered or that the translocation of substrate from the endoplasmic reticulum to the kinase in the plasma membrane is modified. The results suggest multiple metabolic compartments of Ins(1,4,5)P3 in Dictyostelium cells. In Dd-ras-Thr12 transformants the increased conversion of PtdIns to PtdInsP leads to increased levels of Ins(1,4,5)P3 in the compartment with a high metabolic turnover. This Ins(1,4,5)P3 compartment is suggested to be involved in the regulation of cytosolic Ca2+ levels.\r"

Replacement of this region by related sequences obtained from the dl-587rev retrovirus results in MESV, a modified PCMV virus that confers G418 resistance to fibroblasts and ES cells with similar efficiencies.

Mutators with high rates of A.T----T.A transversions were identified using a screening technique that relied upon the reversion of an altered lacZ gene back to wild-type via a specific A.T----T.A transversion. Among the mutators collected, one class mapped to a previously unidentified locus that we designate mutA. Analysis of reverse mutations in lacZ and forward nonsense mutations in lacI showed that the mutA strain has higher levels of A.T----T.A and G.C----T.A transversions, and to a lesser degree A.T----C.G transversions. The mutA locus maps very near to, but is separable from, mutL, at about 95 min on the E. coli chromosome. Both its mutagenic specificity and complementation experiments confirmed that mutA is distinct from mutL and from a nearby mutator locus, miaA. The phenotype of a mutA mutL double mutator strain suggests that the mutA gene product prevents some replication errors. Another mutator, designated mutC, maps very near uvrC, at 42 min, but is distinguishable from uvrC, which has no mutator effects. The specificity of reversion of lacZ mutations in a mutC strain is identical to that in a mutA strain. Also, the behavior of a mutC mutS double mutant is identical to that of a mutA mutL double mutant. It is likely that mutA and mutC are components of the same error-avoidance system.\r"

Characterization of the mRNA encoding MCAD in a Dutch MCAD-deficient patient revealed an A----G change at nucleotide position 985 of the MCAD mRNA coding region. This point mutation results in the substitution of a glutamic acid for a lysine at amino acid position 304 of the mature protein. The single base change was not found in any wild-type MCAD mRNAs. A mutant allele-specific oligonucleotide probe was used in a hybridization analysis of amplified genomic DNA of MCAD-deficient family members, a carrier, and normal individuals. The hybridization analysis specifically identified individuals who were heterozygotes or homozygotes. In addition to the point mutation, a significant proportion of the index patient's MCAD mRNA contained a variety of deletions and insertions as a result of exon skipping and intron retention. The missplicing occurred in multiple regions throughout the MCAD mRNA. Analysis of the patient's MCAD gene in the regions where the missplicing occurred most frequently did not reveal a mutation in the splicing acceptor or donor sites. Therefore, the molecular characterization of this family revealed a crucial point mutation in the MCAD gene and an unusual abnormality in MCAD pre-mRNA splicing.\r"

We find that blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in kitten visual cortex disrupts this process of binocular competition.

  ".W": "We have constructed an opal suppressor system in Escherichia coli to complement an existing amber suppressor system to study the structural basis of tRNA acceptor identity, particularly the role of middle anticodon nucleotide at position 35. The opal suppressor tRNA contains a UCA anticodon and the mRNA of the suppressed protein (which is easily purified and sequenced) contains a UGA nonsense triplet. Opal suppressor tRNAs of two tRNA(Arg) isoacceptor sequences each gave arginine in the suppressed protein, while the corresponding amber suppressors with U35 in their CUA anticodons each gave arginine plus a second amino acid in the suppressed protein. Since C35 but not U35 is present in the anticodon of wild-type tRNA(Arg) molecules, while the first anticodon position contains either C34 or U34, these results establish that C35 contributes to tRNA(Arg) acceptor identity. Initial characterizations of opal suppressor tRNA(Arg) mutants by suppression efficiency measurements suggest that the fourth nucleotide from the 3' end of tRNA(Arg) (A73 or G73 in different isoacceptors) also contributes to tRNA(Arg) acceptor identity. Wild-type and mutant versions of opal and amber tRNA(Lys) suppressors were examined, revealing that U35 and A73 are important determinants of tRNA(Lys) acceptor identity. Several possibilities are discussed for the general significance of having tRNA acceptor identity in the same positions in different tRNA acceptor types, as exemplified by positions 35 and 73 in tRNA(Arg) and tRNA(Lys).\r"

We report here the sequence of one of its AFGP genes. The structural gene contains 46 tandemly repeated segments, each encoding one AFGP peptide plus a 3-amino acid spacer. Most of the repeats (44/46) code for peptides of AFGP 8; the remaining 2 code for peptides of AFGP 7. At least 2 of the 3 amino acids in the spacers could act as substrate for chymotrypsin-like proteases. The nucleotide sequence between the translation initiation codon (ATG) and the first AFGP-coding segment is G + T-rich and encodes a presumptive 37-residue signal peptide of unusual sequence. Primer extension establishes the transcription start site at nucleotide 43 upstream from ATG. CAAT and TATA boxes begin at nucleotides 53 and 49, respectively, upstream from the transcription start site. The polyadenylylation signal, AATAAA, is located approximately 240 nucleotides downstream from the termination codon. A mRNA (approximately 3 kilobases) was found that matches the size of this AFGP gene. Thus, this AFGP gene encodes a secreted, high-copy-number polyprotein that is processed posttranslationally to produce active AFGPs.\r"

As murine cells do not replicate SV40 DNA, it was of interest to determine how p53 from permissive human cells functions. Recombinant baculoviruses encoding either the wild-type form of human p53 or a mutant p53 cloned from a human tumor cell line were constructed, and p53 proteins were purified from infected insect cells. Surprisingly, we found that wild-type human p53 was as inhibitory to the ability of T antigen to mediate replication of an SV40 origin-containing (ori DNA) plasmid in vitro as was murine p53. Wild-type human p53 also blocked the DNA unwinding activity of T antigen, as did its murine counterpart. In contrast to murine and wild-type human p53, the mutant human p53 did not block ori DNA replication or DNA unwinding. Murine p53 formed a complex with mutant human p53 in vivo. Furthermore, mutant human p53 reduced the inhibition of SV40 ori DNA replication by murine p53 in vitro. These results provide a model for the way in which mutant p53 proteins can affect normal functions of p53.\r"

Hebbian and non-Hebbian types of LTP appear to be present in layer II entorhinal cortex cells as demonstrated using two protocols: (i) tetanic stimulation of the piriform-entorhinal cortex afferent pathway to generate homosynaptic potentiation and (ii) postsynaptic subthreshold rhythmic membrane potential manipulation not paired to presynaptic activation, which gives rise to non-Hebbian LTP. The induction and the expression of both types of LTP were found to be dependent on activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors as shown by their sensitivity to the receptor agonist D-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate. This is in contrast to LTP in the hippocampus [Zalutsky, R. A. & Nicoll, R. A. (1990) Science 248, 1619-1624], where LTP is expressed by quisqualate receptors. Since, in the entorhinal cortex, LTP is linked to a selective increase of the N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor-mediated synaptic responses, this enhancement is most likely due to postsynaptic factors.\r"

Possible multiple Ca2+ stores and multiple receptor regulation of the same store have been reported. Here we report the presence of at least two independent intracellular Ca2+ stores in the sea urchin egg, which are released during fertilization. Ca2+ release from one store is mediated by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and is sensitive to low molecular weight heparin. The other store is heparin insensitive and independent of IP3 regulation, but the regulatory factor remains unidentified. A transient increase in Ca2+ in heparin-loaded eggs is observed during fertilization, which suggests that IP3-independent Ca2+ release mediates the production of IP3 and release of the IP3-dependent store. Experiments presented here do not support the idea of sperm receptor coupling to inositol phospholipid hydrolysis through a GTP-binding protein mediating the fertilization response.\r"

Polyclonal antibody 7493, which is directed against purified sodium channels from rat brain, specifically recognizes a 260-kDa protein corresponding to the alpha subunit of the sodium channel in immunoblots of crude glycoproteins from rat sciatic nerve. Electron microscopic localization of sodium channel immunoreactivity within adult rat sciatic nerves reveals heavy staining of the axon membrane at the node of Ranvier, in contrast to the internodal axon membrane, which does not stain. Schwann cells including perinodal processes also exhibit antibody 7493 immunoreactivity, localized within both the cytoplasm and the plasmalemma of the Schwann cell. To examine further the possibility that sodium channels are localized within Schwann cell cytoplasm, [3H]STX binding was studied in cultured rabbit Schwann cells, both intact and after homogenization. Saturable binding of STX was significantly higher in homogenized Schwann cells (410 +/- 37 fmol/mg of protein) than in intact Schwann cells (214 +/- 21 fmol/mg of protein). Moreover, the equilibrium dissociation constant was higher for homogenized preparations (1.77 +/- 0.37 nM) than for intact Schwann cells (1.06 +/- 0.29 nM). These data suggest the presence of an intracellular pool of sodium channels or channel precursors in Schwann cells.\r"

  ".U": "91067693\r", 
  ".W": "Transcriptional activation by steroid hormones is often associated with the appearance of a DNase I hypersensitive site resulting from a local alteration of the nucleoprotein structure of the promoter. For the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat, a viral promoter under glucocorticoid control, a model has been proposed: the appearance of the hormonodependent DNase I hypersensitive site reflects the displacement of a single precisely positioned nucleosome associated with the glucocorticoid responsive elements. To determine if such a mechanism is of general relevance in transcriptional activation by steroid hormones, we have investigated the nucleosomal organization of the rat tyrosine aminotransferase promoter over a 1-kilobase region that contains the glucocorticoid regulatory target. This region displays a hormonodependent DNase I hypersensitive site. In the absence of hormone, micrococcal nuclease digestion of nuclei demonstrates the presence of positioned nucleosomes, with cutting sites centered around positions -3080, -2900, -2700, -2800, -2255, and -2040. Treatment of the cells with dexamethasone induces a disruption of the chromatin structure over a relatively short stretch of DNA (approximately positions -2400 to -2650) that overlaps two nucleosomes. These observations suggest a strong similarity in the role of chromatin structure in glucocorticoid-dependent transcriptional activation of mouse mammary tumor virus and tyrosine aminotransferase promoters.\r"

  ".U": "91067694\r", 
  ".W": "Many signal-transduction processes in higher plant cells have been suggested to be triggered by signal-induced opening of Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane. However, direct evidence for activation of plasma-membrane Ca2+ channels by physiological signals in higher plants has not yet been obtained. In this context, several lines of evidence suggest that Ca2+ flux into the cytosol of guard cells is a major factor in the induction of stomatal closing by abscisic acid (ABA). ABA closes stomatal pores, thereby reducing transpirational loss of water by plants under drought conditions. To directly investigate initial events in ABA-induced signal transduction in guard cells, we devised an experimental approach that allows simultaneous photometric measurements of cytosolic Ca2+ and patch-clamp recordings of ion currents across the plasma membrane of single Vicia faba guard cells. Using this approach, we found that the resting cytosolic Ca2+ concentration was 0.19 +/- 0.09 microM (n = 19). In responsive guard cells, external exposure to ABA produced transient repetitive increases in the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration. These Ca2+ transients were accompanied by concomitantly occurring increases in an inward-directed ion current. Depolarization of the membrane terminated both repetitive elevations in cytosolic Ca2+ and inward-directed ion currents, suggesting that ABA-mediated Ca2+ transients were produced by passive influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular space through Ca2(+)-permeable channels. Detailed voltage-clamp measurements revealed that ABA-activated ion currents could be reversed by depolarizations more positive than -10 mV. Interestingly, reversal potentials of ABA-induced currents show that these currents are not highly Ca2(+)-selective, thereby permitting permeation of both Ca2+ and K+. These results provide direct evidence for ABA activation of Ca2(+)-permeable ion channels in the plasma membrane of guard cells. ABA-activated ion channels allow repetitive elevations in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, which, in turn, can modulate cellular responses promoting stomatal closure.\r"

Differences in regulation were observed (i) after serum levels were reduced, (ii) when serum levels were returned to initial high levels, and (iii) while protein synthesis was inhibited. After reduction of serum levels, the binding activity was unstable in nontransformed BALB/c 3T3 clone A31 cells but was significantly more stable in benzo[a]pyrene-transformed BALB/c 3T3 cells. After serum concentration was returned to high levels, the kinetic pattern of the binding activity differed between nontransformed and transformed cells. While protein synthesis was inhibited, the binding activity was unstable in nontransformed cells and stable in transformed cells. Partial inhibition of protein synthesis--a more stringent condition to test instability--prevented the induction of the binding activity in nontransformed cells. Previously, the labile protein hypothesis set forth the criterion that a protein regulating the onset of DNA synthesis should be unstable in nontransformed cells and stable in transformed cells. The DNA binding activity described here satisfies this criterion.\r"

To investigate this issue, we recently cloned a cDNA encoding an insulin-like peptide (ILP) from a primitive chordate species, amphioxus (Branchiostoma californiensis). The deduced sequence of amphioxus preproILP indicates that it is a hybrid molecule containing features characteristic of both insulin and IGF. Like proinsulin, amphioxus proILP contains a C-peptide, which is flanked by paired basic residues and is probably removed by proteolysis. However, proILP also contains an extended carboxyl-terminal peptide region that can be divided into D and E domains similar to those of proIGF. Sequence comparisons show that the amphioxus ILP A and B domains are equally homologous to those of human insulin and IGF-I and -II. Based on these results and the exon-intron organization of the amphioxus ILP gene, we propose that IGF emerged at a very early stage in vertebrate evolution from an ancestral insulin-type gene.\r"

In contrast, V(D)J recombination is reduced 5- to 8-fold in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or to the calcium ionophore A23187. The effect of cAMP agonists on recombination appears to reflect an increase in cellular recombination activity, as indicated by the caffeine-induced rise in the level of mRNA from the recombination-activating genes RAG1 and RAG2.

  ".U": "91067699\r", 
  ".W": "The factors involved in the establishment of persistent hepadnavirus infection are poorly understood. Recent findings demonstrate that the sequence of the genome of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is variable in infected individuals and that, in some cases, virus mutants predominate. Our objectives in the present study were to analyze the variability of woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) genomes in an infected animal and to determine whether sequence heterogeneity played a critical role in the ability of WHV to induce chronic infection. We cloned and determined the complete nucleotide sequence of three supercoiled genomes from an animal that became infected after inoculation with a standardized WHV serum pool (i.e., the WHV7 virus pool). We found that there were four nucleotide substitutions among the three genome sequences as well as a 73-nucleotide deletion in one of the recombinants. DNA transfection experiments revealed that only one of the three recombinants was capable of independent replication. These data suggest that a significant proportion of replicative templates in woodchucks that are infected with WHV are defective virus genomes. Next, we compared the outcome of acute infection after inoculation with a serum pool containing a uniform population of replication competent virus (i.e., the WHV7R pool) with a serum pool composed of WHV genomes of variable sequence. The WHV7R serum pool originated from a woodchuck that became a chronic carrier after in vivo transfection of the liver with the infectious WHV7 recombinant. Neonatal woodchucks were inoculated with 5 x 10(6) WHV genome equivalents of either the WHV7 pool or the WHV7R pool. All animals in the study became acutely infected with WHV. Of the animals infected with the WHV7 serum pool, 65% became chronic carriers, while 80% of the animals infected with the WHV7R serum pool developed chronic infection. Thus, infection of woodchucks with a serum pool containing defective virus resulted in a rate of chronic WHV infection that was similar to, or even lower than, a rate from a pool containing only wild-type virus. This suggests that the presence of defective virus in the inoculum is not a prerequisite for the establishment of persistent hepadnavirus infections.\r"

Studies have shown that the transcription rates of mitochondrial genes vary from 7- to 15-fold. The nucleotide at position +2 regulates the efficiency of mitochondrial promoters but does not affect the specificity of initiation. The data presented herein demonstrate that the variable transcription rates of mitochondrial genes are due to different levels of transcriptional initiation. The rate of first phosphodiester bond formation between a purine and a pyrimidine on a weak promoter is much lower than that of purine-purine on a strong promoter. A dinucleotide corresponding to positions +1 and +2 acts in vitro as a primer, bypassing the first phosphodiester bond formation at the initiation site. When these dinucleotides were used to prime transcription, the activities of the strong and weak promoters were found to be identical. In heparin-challenge experiments, there is no significant effect of dinucleotide on heparin-resistant DNA-RNA polymerase complex formation. These results indicate that the low level of transcription from the weak mitochondrial promoter is due to the slow rate of formation of the first phosphodiester bond.\r"

The hexagonal surface layer of the bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans with an open network-type structure shows thickness values that are strongly influenced by the substrate and the preparation method. In contrast, the thickness of the purple membrane of Halobacterium halobium with its densely packed less-corrugated structure exhibits very little variation in thickness in coated preparations and the values obtained are in good agreement with x-ray data.\r"

  ".W": "Cytosolic free calcium ([Ca2+]c) has been measured in the mycelial fungus Neurospora crassa with Ca2(+)-selective microelectrodes. The mean value of [Ca2+]c is 92 +/- 15 nM and it is insensitive to external pH values between 5.8 and 8.4. Simultaneous measurement of membrane potential enables the electrochemical potential difference for Ca2+ across the plasma membrane to be estimated as about -60 kJ.mol-1-a value that cannot be sustained either by a simple Ca2(+)-ATPase, or, in alkaline conditions, by straightforward H+/Ca2+ exchange with a stoichiometric ratio of less than 5 H+/Ca2+. We propose that the most likely alternative mechanism of Ca2+ efflux is ATP-driven H+/Ca2+. In accord with this proposal, depletion of the ATP level from 2.5 to 0.5 mM by CN- elicits an increase in [Ca2+]c, but only in alkaline conditions in which the putative H+/Ca2(+)-ATPase would be selectively stalled. The insensitivity of Ca2+ homeostasis to CN- in more acid conditions implies that the Km (ATP) of the transport system is 100 microM or less. The increase in [Ca2+]c in the presence of CN- at pH 8.4 (50 nM.min-1) is compared with 45Ca2+ influx (0.62 mM.min-1) under the same conditions. The proportion of entering Ca2+ remaining free in the cytosol is only 8 x 10(-5), and since the concentration of available chelation sites on Ca2(+)-binding proteins is unlikely to exceed 100 microM, a major role for the fungal vacuole in short-term Ca2+ homeostasis is indicated. This notion is supported by the observation that cytosolic Ca2+ homeostasis is disrupted by a protonophore, which rapidly abolishes the driving force (a transmembrane pH difference) for Ca2+ uptake into fungal vacuoles.\r"

Elevation of cAMP levels blocks IL-2 induction while sparing IL-4 induction. These effects are gene-specific, not cell-specific, and can be observed in the same cells. Transient transfection experiments using murine IL-2 regulatory sequences to drive expression of a reporter gene show at least part of the inhibition to act at the transcriptional level. The possible biological significance of these results is indicated by the observation that representative type 2 helper T-cell lines maintain significantly higher levels of cAMP per cell than a type 1 helper T-cell line. Fresh splenic CD4+ T cells, which preferentially make IL-2, have particularly low levels of cAMP per cell and a low capacity to elevate cAMP in response to forskolin. However, their response to forskolin increases significantly after several days of stimulation. These results suggest a potential link between differential cAMP regulation and the divergence of memory T cells into effector subsets.\r"

  ".W": "Translocations involving chromosome 11, band q23, are frequent recurring abnormalities in human acute lymphoblastic and acute myeloid leukemia. We used 19 biotin-labeled probes derived from genes and anonymous cosmids for hybridization to metaphase chromosomes from leukemia cells that contained four translocations involving band 11q23: t(4;11)(q21;q23), t(6;11)(q27;q23), t(9;11)(p22;q23), and t(11;19)(q23;p13). The location of the cosmid probes relative to the breakpoint in 11q23 was the same in all translocations. Of the cosmid clones containing known genes, CD3D was proximal and PBGD, THY1, SRPR, and ETS1 were distal to the breakpoint on 11q23. Hybridization of genomic DNA from a yeast clone containing yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs), that carry 320 kilobases (kb) of human DNA including CD3D and CD3G genes, showed that the YACs were split in all four translocations. These results indicate that the breakpoint at 11q23 in each of these translocations occurs within the 320 kb encompassed by these YACs; whether the breakpoint within the YACs is precisely the same in the different translocations is presently unknown.\r"

Direction selectivity can be significantly enhanced if the nonlinear interaction is followed by another processing stage in which the signals of elements with opposite preferred directions are subtracted from each other. Our electrophysiological experiments in the fly visual system suggest that here direction selectivity is acquired in such a two-stage process.\r"

  ".U": "91067707\r", 
  ".W": "Mitochondrial accumulation and respiratory inhibition are critical steps in the actions of N-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+), the toxic metabolite of the parkinsonism-inducing agent, N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. We examined the respiratory characteristics of 2-methylated beta-carbolines (2-Me beta Cs) and 2-methylated 3,4-dihydro-beta-carbolines (2-MeDH beta Cs), which encompass the MPP+ structure. As indoleamine derivatives, they could have endogenous roles in idiopathic parkinsonism. With rat liver mitochondria, the order for inhibition of NAD(+)-linked O2 consumption (6-min preincubations) was as follows: MPP+ = 2-methylharmine greater than 2-methylharmol = 2-methylharmaline much greater than 2-methylharmalol greater than 2-methylnorharman greater than 6-OH-2-methylharmalan much greater than 2-methylharman. Similar to MPP+, 2-MeDH beta C/2-Me beta C inhibition was potentiated by tetraphenylboron and reversed by dinitrophenol, consistent with the involvement of cationic forms. However, the participation of neutral forms was indicated by the 2-MeDH beta C/2-Me beta C inhibitory time courses, which were unlike MPP+. The neutral forms probably arise via indolic nitrogen deprotonation because the characteristics of a cationic beta-carboline that cannot N-deprotonate, 2,9-dimethylnorharman, mirrored MPP+ rather than 2-Me beta Cs. Succinate-supported respiration was also significantly blocked by 2-MeDH beta Cs/2-Me beta Cs, but results with tetraphenylboron and 2,9-dimethylnorharman indicated that cationic forms were less important than in the inhibition of NAD(+)-linked respiration. We suggest that the relatively potent inhibition by certain 2-MeDH beta Cs/2-Me beta Cs involves neutral forms for passive mitochondrial entry and cationic as well as neutral forms that act at several respiratory sites. Respiratory inhibition could reasonably underlie the reported neurotoxicity of 2-Me beta Cs.\r"

We report the isolation and functional expression of a cDNA encoding a propeptide-cleaving enzyme from a human liver cell line. The encoded protein, called PACE (paired basic amino acid cleaving enzyme), has structural homology to the well-characterized subtilisin-like protease Kex2 from yeast. The functional specificity of PACE for mediating propeptide cleavage at paired basic amino acid residues was demonstrated by the enhancement of propeptide processing of human von Willebrand factor when coexpressed with PACE in COS-1 cells.\r"

We observed that Lp(a) has been found in the plasma of several species unable to synthesize ascorbate and not in other species. We have now detected apoprotein(a) in the plasma of the guinea pig. We induced atherosclerosis in this animal by dietary ascorbate depletion and, using SDS/PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting, we identified Lp(a) as accumulating in the atherosclerotic plaque. Most importantly, adequate amounts of ascorbate (40 mg per kg of body weight per day) prevent the development of atherosclerotic lesions in this animal model and the accumulation of Lp(a) in the arterial wall. We suggest an analogous mechanism in humans because of the similarity between guinea pigs and humans with respect to both the lack of endogenous ascorbate production and the role of Lp(a) in human atherosclerosis.\r"

With chorismate and NH3, pure PabB generates an intermediate presumed to be 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate based upon UV/visible spectroscopy and enzymatic and nonenzymatic transformations. The PabB-catalyzed interconversion of chorismate and isolated aminodeoxychorismate is readily reversible. With pure PabB as a stoichiometric assay reagent, enzyme X was purified approximately 800-fold to near homogeneity as an apparent homodimer of 50 kDa from E. coli. Enzyme X shows no activity on chorismate but quantitatively converts the preformed aminodeoxychorismate into p-aminobenzoate and pyruvate, acting thereby as an aminodeoxychorismate lyase.\r"

  ".W": "Growth factors and transforming proteins that activate tyrosine phosphorylation have been shown to cause an increased labeling of 3-phosphate-containing phosphatidylinositols. Turnover correlates with the formation of a complex between phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, the activated protein-tyrosine kinase, and other proteins thought to participate in transmembrane signaling. When human platelets are treated with thrombin, labeling of 3-phosphate-containing phosphatidylinositols is stimulated with a time course and concentration dependence consistent with a role for these lipids in platelet activation. We now report that when human platelets are stimulated with thrombin, a complex forms between phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, a protein-serine/threonine kinase, and an uncharacterized platelet membrane protein. The complex is immunoprecipitated from detergent lysates of thrombinstimulated platelets by a rabbit antiserum prepared against a peptide from the cytoplasmic domain of the mouse platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor. The antigen is not the PDGF receptor, since complex formation is not stimulated by PDGF and thrombin-induced complexes are not precipitated by another rabbit antiserum against the same peptide or by monoclonal anti-human PDGF receptor antibodies. Formation of the complex is rapid (within 30 sec) and occurs at thrombin concentrations that stimulate platelet aggregation and secretion (50% of maximal complex formation at 0.03 unit of thrombin per ml). We propose that the complex initiates formation of 3-phosphate-containing phosphatidylinositols that may function in platelet activation.\r"

  ".W": "Liver fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) is the principal target protein of the hepatic carcinogen N-(2-fluorenyl)acetamide (2-acetylaminofluorene) in rat liver. In addition, the cyclopentenone prostaglandins (PG), PGA, PGJ2, and delta 12-PGJ2, inhibit the growth of many cell types in vitro. This report describes the preferential binding of the growth inhibitory prostaglandins by L-FABP and the reversible inhibition of thymidine incorporation into DNA by PGA2 and delta 12-PGJ2 in primary cultures of purified rat hepatocytes. As a model ligand, [3H]PGA1 bound to L-FABP specifically, reversibly, rapidly, and with high affinity. Its dissociation constants were 134 nM (high affinity) and 3.6 microM (low affinity). The high-affinity binding of [3H]PGA1 was 9- and approximately 13-fold more avid than the binding of the conventional fatty acid ligands, oleic acid and arachidonic acid, respectively. The abilities of different prostaglandins to compete with the high-affinity binding of [3H]PGA1 correlated with their growth inhibitory activities reported previously and here. The growth inhibitory cyclopentenone prostaglandins (PGA1, PGA2, delta 12-PGJ2, and PGJ2) were the best competitive ligands, intermediate competitors were the weak growth inhibitors PGE1 and PGD2, and the poorest competitors were PGE2 and PGF2 alpha, which stimulate rather than inhibit DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes in primary culture. The in vitro actions of L-FABP are compatible with those of a specific and dissociable carrier of growth inhibitory prostaglandins in rat hepatocytes and suggest that the carcinogen may usurp the cellular machinery of the growth inhibitory prostaglandins.\r"

  ".W": "The molecular mechanism of signal transduction through the interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor remains an enigma. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) lipids were investigated as one component of this process. IL-2 stimulated the rapid (30 sec) loss of greater than 50% of GPI in the IL-2-dependent T-cell line CTLL-2. Half-maximal GPI loss was detected at 40 pM IL-2, coincident with the EC50 (20 pM) for IL-2-induced proliferation of this cell line. This effect was specifically inhibited by antibodies that bind either IL-2 or the IL-2 receptor. The loss of GPI was mirrored by the accumulation of both polar inositolphosphoglycan (IPG) and diacylglycerol lipid fragments within cells. Increases in lipids were initially restricted to myristoyl diacylglycerol but were followed by the accumulation of myristoyl phosphatidic acid. These results are indicative of IL-2-dependent hydrolysis of GPI in T cells. The biological relevance of this hydrolysis was demonstrated by synergism of purified IPG with IL-2 in T-cell proliferation responses. The inclusion of IPG (0.1 microM) in determinations of IL-2-dependent CTLL-2 growth shifted the EC50 from 20 to 7 pM IL-2. IPG had no effect on either the number or affinity of IL-2 receptors; therefore, half-maximal CTLL-2 proliferation was obtained at less than 10% IL-2 receptor occupancy. These results demonstrate that GPI lipids are an important component of the biological response to IL-2.\r"

  ".W": "Synthesis of normal human hemoglobin A, alpha 2 beta 2, is based upon balanced expression of genes in the alpha-globin gene cluster on chromosome 16 and the beta-globin gene cluster on chromosome 11. Full levels of erythroid-specific activation of the beta-globin cluster depend on sequences located at a considerable distance 5' to the beta-globin gene, referred to as the locus-activating or dominant control region. The existence of an analogous element(s) upstream of the alpha-globin cluster has been suggested from observations on naturally occurring deletions and experimental studies. We have identified an individual with alpha-thalassemia in whom structurally normal alpha-globin genes have been inactivated in cis by a discrete de novo 35-kilobase deletion located approximately 30 kilobases 5' from the alpha-globin gene cluster. We conclude that this deletion inactivates expression of the alpha-globin genes by removing one or more of the previously identified upstream regulatory sequences that are critical to expression of the alpha-globin genes.\r"

  ".U": "91067721\r", 
  ".W": "We report a complete thermodynamic characterization of the stability and the melting behavior of an oligomeric DNA triplex. The triplex chosen for study forms by way of major-groove Hoogsteen association of an all-pyrimidine 15-mer single strand (termed y15) with a Watson-Crick 21-mer duplex composed of one purine-rich strand (termed u21) and one pyrimidine-rich strand (termed y21). We find that the near-UV CD spectrum of the triplex can be duplicated by the addition of the B-like CD spectrum of the isolated 21-mer duplex and the CD spectrum of the 15-mer single strand. Spectroscopic and calorimetric measurements show that the triplex (y15.u21.y21) melts by two well-resolved sequential transitions. The first transition (melting temperature, Tm, approximately 30 degrees C) is pH-dependent and involves the thermal expulsion of the 15-mer strand to form the free duplex u21.y21 and the free single strand y15. The second transition (Tm approximately 65 degrees C) is pH-independent between pH 6 and 7 and reflects the thermal disruption of the u21.y21 Watson-Crick duplex to form the component single strands. The thermal stability of the y15.u21.y21 triplex increases with increasing Na+ concentration but is nearly independent of DNA strand concentration. Differential scanning calorimetric measurements at pH 6.5 show the triplex to be enthalpically stabilized by only 2.0 +/- 0.1 kcal/mol of base triplets (1 cal = 4.184 J), whereas the duplex is stabilized by 6.3 +/- 0.3 kcal/mol of base pairs. From the calorimetric data, we calculate that at 25 degrees C the y15.u21.y21 triplex is stabilized by a free energy of only 1.3 +/- 0.1 kcal/mol relative to its component u21.y21 duplex and y15 single strand, whereas the 21-mer duplex is stabilized by a free energy of 17.2 +/- 1.2 kcal/mol relative to its component single strands. The y15 single strand modified by methylation of cytosine at the C-5 position forms a triplex with the u21.y21 duplex, which exhibits enhanced thermal stability. The spectroscopic and calorimetric data reported here provide a quantitative measure of the influence of salt, temperature, pH, strand concentration, and base modification on the stability and the melting behavior of a DNA triplex. Such information should prove useful in designing third-strand oligonucleotides and in defining solution conditions for the effective use of triplex structure formation as a tool for modulating biochemical events.\r"

The DNA fragment maps entirely within a portion of the open reading frame encoding the large subunit of the viral ribonucleotide reductase and does not contain any of the known lytic origins of viral DNA synthesis. Amplification of this sequence in transfected cells results in accumulation of full-sized Dpn I-resistant plasmids containing the sequence in Hirt extracts of low molecular weight DNA. Subfragments of the 1620-bp fragment were not amplified, whereas larger fragments containing the intact 1620-bp fragment were amplified. The amplification of the fragment in MCF7 cells, which express steroid receptors, was stimulated by the addition of estrogen to the medium. Addition of progesterone, dexamethasone, or testosterone was ineffective. The viral genome therefore contains at least one origin of DNA synthesis capable of supporting replication of viral DNA by cellular factors. The existence of such a host origin of DNA replication in the viral genome was predicted by the hypothesis that viral DNA is amplified by cellular enzymes in sensory neurons harboring latent virus; the link between these sequences and amplification of viral DNA during latency remains to be proven.\r"

The neuronal basis for these synergistic effects is elusive because the spatial relation between estrogen target cells and androgen target cells is unknown. This study localized estrogen receptor (ER)-containing cells by using immunocytochemistry and androgen receptor (AR)-containing cells by using autoradiography in the same sections of the male canary brain. Three cell types, those containing only ER, those containing only AR, and those containing both ER and AR, were found in tissue-specific frequencies. The midbrain nucleus intercollicularis exhibited the highest number of cells expressing both ER and AR, whereas ER and AR are expressed only in disjunctive cell populations in the forebrain nucleus hyperstriatalis ventrale, pars caudale. Synergistic effects of androgens and estrogens for the neural behavorial control could result from cells containing both ER and AR (intracellular) and from neural circuits containing ER and AR in different cells (intercellular).\r"

The element containing the retron consisted of a unique 34-kilobase sequence that was flanked by direct repeats of a 26-base-pair sequence found in the K-12 chromosomal DNA. This suggests that the 34-kilobase element was probably integrated into the E. coli genome by a mechanism related to transposition or phage integration. In the 34-kilobase sequence an open reading frame of 285 residues was found, which displays 44% sequence identity with the E. coli Dam methylase. Interestingly, there are three GATC sequences, the site of Dam methylation, in the promoter region of the gene for reverse transcriptase.\r"

ZEBRA does not, however, contain the heptad repeat of leucines present in the dimerization domains of leucine zipper proteins. Here it is shown that ZEBRA binds its recognition sites as a homodimer and that the region adjacent to the basic DNA binding domain is essential for dimerization. This region contains a 4-3 repeat of predominantly hydrophobic residues, which is precisely in register with the hydrophobic heptad repeat present in the leucine zipper proteins with respect to the basic DNA binding domain. A mutational analysis of ZEBRA supports a model for dimerization involving a coiled-coil interaction. These results indicate that a heptad repeat of leucines is not a structural requirement for formation of coiled-coil dimers by transcription factors.\r"

The bifurcation parameters include first- and second-order neuronal interaction coefficients and a rescaled noise level, which represents the combined effects of the random synaptic dilution, interference between stored patterns, and additional background noise. We show that a marked difference in terms of the occurrence of oscillations or chaos exists between neural networks with parallel and random sequential dynamics.\r"

  ".U": "91067727\r", 
  ".W": "We have recently been able to correlate closely the \"spontaneous\" oscillatory activity of cytosolic free Ca2+ in adherent human neutrophils with the ability of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) to induce secretion of granule proteins from these cells. In the present work we show with a single-cell technique that preincubation of human neutrophils with antibodies to CD18, the common beta chain of leukocyte adhesion proteins, inhibits TNF-induced secretion of lactoferrin in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Similar effects of CD18 antibodies were found on chemotactic factor (fMet-Leu-Phe)- but not on phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced secretion, suggesting that cell-surface-receptor-mediated secretion is dependent on integrin-associated signals. Similarly, antibodies to CD11b (alpha chain of macrophage 1) also inhibited TNF- and fMet-Leu-Phe- but not phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated release of lactoferrin. Antibodies to CD11a (alpha chain of lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1) or CD11c (alpha chain of p150,95) had only a minimal effect on agonist-induced secretion. Data obtained in several laboratories, including our own, made us suspect that integrin interaction with the surface is responsible for the oscillatory activity of cytosolic free Ca2+ in adherent cells. Indeed, preincubation with antibodies to either CD18 or CD11b, but not to CD11c, inhibited the oscillations of cytosolic free Ca2+ in adherent neutrophils. This inhibitory effect was evident both as a reduction of the number of responding cells and as a reduction of the oscillatory activity in the cells. In conclusion, the oscillatory activity of cytosolic free Ca2+ in adherent neutrophils is mediated through the CD18/CD11b integrins. The generation of this Ca2+ signal may explain how adherence, by way of the integrins, changes the functional properties of the cell and enables TNF to induce secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Each mammalian genus examined so far contains 50,000-100,000 members of an L1 (LINE 1) family of long interspersed repeated DNA elements. Current knowledge on the evolution of L1 families presents a paradox because, although L1 families have been in mammalian genomes since before the mammalian radiation approximately 80 million years ago, most members of the L1 families are only a few million years old. Accordingly it has been suggested either that the extensive amplification that characterizes present-day L1 families did not occur in the past or that old members were removed as new ones were generated. However, we show here that an ancestral rodent L1 family was extensively amplified approximately 10 million years ago and that the relics (approximately 60,000 copies) of this amplification have persisted in modern murine genomes (Old World rats and mice). This amplification occurred just before the divergence of modern murine genera from their common ancestor and identifies the murine node in the lineage of modern muroid rodents. Our results suggest that repeated amplification of L1 elements is a feature of the evolution of mammalian genomes and that ancestral amplification events could provide a useful tool for determining mammalian lineages.\r"

The monomeric form was then purified to near homogeneity with a high yield (3-5 mg/liter). Monomeric DT388-anti-Tac(Fv) was highly cytotoxic to cell lines bearing the p55 subunit of the human interleukin 2 receptor but not to cells without this subunit.

Vaccinia virus recombinants expressing tumor antigens have considerable promise in the active immunotherapy of cancer, and we have evaluated the potential of vaccinia recombinants expressing the secreted (S) and cell-associated (transmembrane, T) forms of H23 ETA to elicit immunity to tumor cells expressing ETA. Tumorigenic ras-transformed Fischer rat fibroblast lines FR-S and FR-T, expressing the S or T form of H23 ETA, respectively, were constructed for use in challenge experiments. Expression of H23 ETA in these lines was confirmed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. When challenged by subcutaneous seeding of tumor cells, 97% (FR-S) and 91% (FR-T) of syngeneic Fischer rats rapidly developed tumors that failed to regress. Vaccination with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing ETA-T prior to challenge prevented tumor development in 82% of animals seeded with FR-T cells but in only 61% of animals seeded with FR-S. The vaccinia recombinant expressing the S form was a less effective immunogen, and vaccination protected only 29-30% of animals from developing tumors upon challenge with either FR-S or -T cells. The increased immunogenicity of the recombinant expressing ETA-T was reflected in elevated levels of ETA-reactive antibody in vaccinated animals, confirming that secreted antigens expressed from vaccinia virus are less effective immunogens than their membrane-associated counterparts.\r"

Theoretical rate constants calculated by numerical integration of the Forster integral (containing the Poisson-Boltzmann-generated protein electrostatic potential) were compared with the experimental data to evaluate the accuracy of protein electrostatic field calculations at the protein/solvent interface. Two dielectric formalisms were used: a simple coulombic/Debye-Huckel procedure and a finite difference method [Warwicker, J. & Watson, H. C. (1982) J. Mol. Biol. 157, 671-679] that accounts for the low-dielectric protein interior and the irregular protein/solvent boundary. Good agreement with experiment was obtained and the ionic-strength dependence of the reaction was successfully reproduced. The sensitivity of theoretical rate constants to the choices of effective donor sphere size and the energy transfer distance criterion was analyzed. Electrostatic potential and rate-constant calculations were carried out on sets of structures collected along two molecular dynamics trajectories of cytochrome c. Protein conformational fluctuations were shown to produce large variations in the calculated energy transfer rate constant. We conclude that protein fluctuations and the resulting transient structures can play significant roles in biological or catalytic activities that are not apparent from examination of a static structure. For calculating protein electrostatics, large-scale low-frequency conformational fluctuations, such as charged side-chain reorientation, are established to be as important as the computational method for incorporating dielectric boundary effects.\r"

  ".W": "Mammalian skeletons experience peak locomotor stresses (force per area) that are 25 to 50% of their failure strength, indicating a safety factor of between two and four. The mechanism by which animals achieve a constant safety factor varies depending on the size of the animal. Over much of their size (0.1 to 300 kilograms), larger mammals maintain uniform skeletal stress primarily by having a more upright posture, which decreases mass-specific muscle force by increasing muscle mechanical advantage. At greater sizes, increased skeletal allometry and decreased locomotor performance likely maintain stresses constant. At smaller sizes, skeletal stiffness may be more critical than strength. The decrease in mass-specific muscle force in mammals weighing 0.1 to 300 kilogram indicates that peak muscle stresses are also constant and correlates with a decrease in mass-specific energy cost of locomotion. The consistent pattern of locomotor stresses developed in long bones at different speeds and gaits within a species may have important implications for how bones adaptively remodel to changes in stress.\r"

These selected and amplified binding site (SAAB) \"imprints\" provide a characteristic set of preferred sequences for protein binding. With this technique, it was shown that homo- and heterooligomers of the helix-loop-helix proteins MyoD and E2A recognize a common consensus sequence, CA--TG, but otherwise bind to flanking and internal positions with different sequence preferences that suggest half-site recognition. These findings suggest that different combinations of dimeric proteins can have different binding sequence preferences.\r"

  ".W": "The signal recognition particle (SRP) plays a central role in directing the export of nascent proteins from the cytoplasm of mammalian cells. An SRP-dependent translocation machinery in bacteria has not been demonstrated in previous genetic and biochemical studies. Sequence comparisons, however, have identified (i) a gene in Escherichia coli (ffh) whose product is homologous to the 54-kilodalton subunit (SRP54) of SRP, and (ii) an RNA encoded by the ffs gene (4.5S RNA) that shares a conserved domain with the 7SL RNA of SRP. An antiserum to Ffh precipitated 4.5S RNA from E. coli extracts, implying that the two molecules reside in a complex. The 4.5S RNA can also bind to SRP54 and can replace 7SL RNA in an enzymatic assay. The product of a dominant mutation in the ffs gene (4.5S RNAdl1) is also coprecipitated by the antiserum to Ffh protein and is lethal when expressed from an inducible promoter. After induction of 4.5S RNAdl1, the earliest observed phenotype was a permanent induction of the heat shock response, suggesting that there was an accumulation of aberrant proteins in the cytoplasm. Late after induction, translocation of beta-lactamase was impaired; this may be an indirect effect of heat shock, however, because translocation of ribose binding protein or of the porin, OmpA, was unaffected. An unusual separation of the inner and outer membranes, suggestive of a defect in cell envelope, was also observed. Protein synthesis did not cease until very late, an indication that 4.5S RNA probably does not have a direct role in this process.\r"

Like the serine proteases the antibody catalyzes the hydrolysis reactions through a putative covalent intermediate, but unlike the enzymes it may use hydroxide ion to cleave the intermediates. Nevertheless, the antibody is a potent catalyst with turnover at higher pH values rivaling that of chymotrypsin. This analysis also reveals that turnover by the antibody is ultimately limited by product desorption, suggesting that improvements in catalytic efficiency may be achieved by judicious changes in the structure of the substrate, so that it is not superimposable on that of the eliciting hapten.\r"

This current does contribute, however, to a fourth form of plasticity--modulation of transmitter release by tonic depolarization of the sensory neuron. By contrast, a second calcium current, which is rapidly inactivating and dihydropyridine-insensitive, contributes to release elicited by the transient depolarization of an action potential and to the other three forms of plasticity.\r"

A 3.7-kilobase (kb) fragment that contained the entire human epsilon-globin gene was linked to a 2.5-kb cassette of the locus control region (LCR), and the developmental time of expression of this construct was studied in transgenic mice. The human epsilon-globin transgene was expressed in yolk sac-derived primitive erythroid cells, but not in fetal liver or bone marrow-derived definitive erythroid cells. The absence of epsilon gene expression in definitive erythroid cells suggests that the developmental regulation of the epsilon-globin gene depends only on the presence of the LCR and the epsilon-globin gene itself (that is, an autonomous negative control mechanism). The autonomy of epsilon-globin gene developmental control distinguishes it from the competitive mechanism of regulation of gamma and beta-globin genes, and therefore, suggests that at least two distinct mechanisms function in human hemoglobin switching.\r"

At its carboxyl terminus, c-Myc contains a basic--helix-loop-helix (bHLH) motif, which is important for dimerization and specific DNA binding, as demonstrated for other bHLH protein family members. Of those studied, most bHLH proteins bind to sites that contain a CA- -TG consensus. In this study, the technique of selected and amplified binding-sequence (SAAB) imprinting was used to identify a DNA sequence that was recognized by c-Myc. A purified carboxyl-terminal fragment of human c-Myc that contained the bHLH domain bound in vitro in a sequence-specific manner to the sequence, CACGTG. These results suggest that some of the biological functions of Myc family proteins are accomplished by sequence-specific DNA binding that is mediated by the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein.\r"

Interpretation of these results, however, may be confounded by various methodologic flaws in study design and comparisons of heterogeneous populations. We sought to compare the therapeutic benefit of OBCM and WBCM in a prospective randomized study of infertile patients, controlling for pelvic anatomy by laparoscopic assessment. We used ethiodized oil (Ethiodol) or iothalamate meglumine (Conray 60) for tubal lavage at the time of laparoscopy only in patients with normal pelvic anatomy. Of the 225 patients who had diagnostic laparoscopy in the evaluation of infertility, 40 (18%) had normal pelvic anatomy and an otherwise unremarkable evaluation. Adequate follow-up was available on 29 patients randomized to receive either OBCM (n = 15) or WBCM (n = 14). A significant difference in pregnancy rates was noted between OBCM (40%) and WBCM (14%) by chi-square analysis. No short- or long-term adverse reactions were noted.

Tumors with higher S-phase fractions, G2/M fractions, or aneuploid cell populations tended to behave \"aggressively.\" The presence of sustentacular cells in the primary tumors cannot be used as an absolute indicator of tumor metastatic potential, as two metastatic paragangliomas in this study contained sustentacular cells in both the primary and metastatic lesions. DNA ploidy status cannot be used as an absolute prognostic parameter as the two metastatic tumors were composed of diploid primary and metastatic lesions. The three tumors with aneuploid cell populations showed \"aggressive\" histologic and clinical features, but the length of the follow-up period for these cases is too limited to draw any conclusions. Although no absolute criteria can be used at present to gauge aggressiveness, close follow-up of these patients is essential, especially if pathologic findings suggest an \"aggressive\" course (ie, \"malignant\" histology, higher S-phase fractions, G2/M fractions, aneuploid cell populations, or decreased sustentacular cell density).\r"

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of inpatients with a new diagnosis of ARF from 1982 through 1988 at a children's hospital that serves a six-state referral area in the mid-South. Thirty patients were identified, 21 of whom were seen in 1987 (13) and 1988 (8). The rate of new cases of ARF per 1000 hospital discharges (0.7) was significantly greater for 1987 and 1988 than it was (0.15) from 1982 through 1986. Patients with recently diagnosed ARF were predominantly from nonurban areas, and polyarthritis was the most common recent major manifestation. Reasons for the resurgence of ARF in the US, including the mid-South, are unclear, but our experience serves to support recently published guidelines for the diagnosis and management of streptococcal pharyngitis in light of this resurgence of ARF.\r"

Physician compliance with recommendations of the National Diabetes Advisory Board for diabetes care was measured before (n = 45) and after (n = 158) these interventions. The numbers of referrals to ophthalmologists increased from 22% to 46%, urinalyses increased from 58% to 77%, and lower extremity examinations increased from 36% to 61%. Nutrition education documentation increased from 51% to 69%, and diabetes education documentation increased from 31% to 61%.

Two screening methods were evaluated for their ability to detect urinary albumin in the range of 15 to 200 mg/L. Sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 54.7%, respectively, for the Ames Micro-Bumintest; and 95.5% and 91.5%, respectively, for the Sclavo Albumin Screen. The high number of false-positive results made the Micro-Bumintest unacceptable. The Albumin Screen yielded fewer false-positive results, but also produced some false-negatives. Two quantitative methods, a radioimmunoassay (RIA) and a turbidimetric assay (the SPQ Microalbumin), yielded results that agreed well with each other.\r"

In 80% of patients with bleeding angiodysplasia, the bleeding will stop spontaneously, but will often recur. Although angiography may detect bleeding in 86% of actively bleeding patients, the bleeding rate must be at least 0.5 mL/min. The treatment of choice for control of bleeding has been resection of the suspected segment of bowel, but this procedure is associated with a 10% rebleeding rate and 7% to 8% mortality. Superselective catheterization with infusion of vasoconstrictors has been used to control bleeding, but effects are short-lived. Superselective embolization occludes an offending vessel, but is difficult to perform accurately and is associated with risk of infarction. Laser photocoagulation controls bleeding in 84% of patients, with a 6% complication rate. This method of controlling bleeding offers distinct advantages, especially for the hemodynamically unstable patient. Except for cases in which surgical resection is indicated, Nd:YAG laser photocoagulation is the safest, least invasive, and probably most effective means of treating angiodysplasia.\r"

This entity was initially thought to be limited to individuals of Asian origin and has been uncommonly described in patients of Western origin. Patients of Western origin differ in several ways from those in the original description of Yamaguchi et al, but they both share the same classic criterion of hypertrophy of the left ventricular apex. The major differences probably relate to the anatomic variation in the distribution of the left ventricular hypertrophy as described by Maron et al. It is not known whether racial, genetic, or environmental factors account for the variation of disease expression in Asian and Western patients. Our case illustrates that this diagnosis should be considered in patients who have chest pain (anginal or atypical) and markedly abnormal findings on electrocardiograms in the absence of hypertension or significant coronary artery disease.\r"
