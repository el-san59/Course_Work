  ".W": "In our patients with tumour affecting the trachea or carina elective surgery was carried out after endoscopic laser treatment. Laser treatment was performed as an emergency procedure in three of the patients, who presented with impending asphyxia; the improvement provided time in which to assess the disease, withdraw corticosteroids, and treat infection. The fourth patient was treated with the laser for life threatening haemoptysis, but further bleeding made it necessary to tamponade the tumour with a cuffed endotracheal tube for 24 hours. Elective resections of the trachea (three cases) and carina (one case) were performed successfully four to eight weeks after laser treatment. Frozen sections of the resection margins were clear in all cases and paraffin sections subsequently confirmed the localised nature of the lesions. All patients are alive and well with no evidence of tumour recurrence after 18 months to 4 years. Laser therapy appears to be an ideal preoperative treatment for patients with impending asphyxia but it may be of limited value in controlling very brisk haemorrhage.\r"

Twenty-two of these patients had Foley catheters for relief of their outflow obstructions. The procedures were performed under local anesthesia or intravenous sedation. Successful results were noted in 46 of 55 patients with relief of symptoms for up to twenty-six months. In 9 cases the procedures were unsuccessful and transurethral resection of the prostate was required.\r"

Surgical procedures effectively stabilized the bladder base and enabled adequate abdominal pressure transmission to the urethra in both groups of women. In spite of these urodynamic findings, the failure rate in women with stress urinary incontinence and low urethral pressure was significantly higher compared with women with good urethral pressure (50% vs 23% for the Pereyra procedure and 33% vs 12% for the Burch procedure [p less than 0.05]), indicating an etiology for their incontinence other than poor support to the urethrovesical junction; therefore, the need for another approach to cure stress incontinence.\r"

Intravesical instillation of pentosanpolysulfate, an exogenous glycosaminoglycan, after destruction of this layer reduces the adhesion of crystals to the urothelium. Intramuscular administration of carbenoxolone sodium following the experimental destruction of the GAG layer increases the rate of healing of the layer and reduces the number of adhered crystals.\r"

Subjects were studied at baseline and with annual follow-up electrocardiographic (ECG) exams. At baseline, 7.9% had a history of MI without ECG evidence, 6.4% had ECG evidence of Q-wave MI without clinical history, 4.1% had both clinical history and ECG evidence and 81.5% had neither history nor ECG evidence (control subjects). After an average follow-up period of 76.2 months, the total mortality rate was 5.9/100 person-years for subjects with some evidence of MI at baseline versus 3.9 in the control group (p = 0.059). The incidence of cardiovascular disease in subjects with evidence of MI was 8.8/100 person-years versus 4.7 among control subjects (p = 0.002). During the follow-up period, 115 new Q-wave MIs occurred (50 unrecognized, rate 2.4/100; 65 recognized, rate 3.2/100). There was no difference in mortality and morbidity outcome between subjects with recognized and unrecognized MIs. Those with only a history of MI at baseline had a threefold greater risk of a new MI (recognized and unrecognized) than the control group (p = 0.003). Unrecognized Q-wave MI is a common occurrence in the \"old old\" with subsequent morbidity and mortality prognosis comparable to that of recognized MI. History of MI alone in this age group is also associated with an increased risk of MI, suggesting the need for better diagnostic markers of myocardial ischemia in the old.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine the prognostic value of myocardial infarct size, as estimated by the Selvester 54-criteria/32-point QRS scoring system, in the Framingham cohort. During the first 30 years of the Framingham Heart Study, a total of 384 participants developed an AMI requiring hospitalization; from this group, 243 patients met the following inclusion criteria: (1) no electrocardiographic changes due to a previous infarction, (2) survival greater than 3 days after discharge from the AMI hospitalization and (3) no electrocardiographic evidence of conduction disturbances or ventricular hypertrophy at the time of their final in-hospital electrocardiogram. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to test the association of the QRS score, and other associated risk factors, with time until coronary heart disease-related death. QRS score was found to be significantly associated with outcome (p = 0.03), as was the systolic blood pressure before infarction (p greater than 0.001). Both univariate and multivariate analysis showed that a history of systolic hypertension was the variable most strongly associated with coronary heart disease-related death. Thus, identification of AMI survivors at high risk for subsequent mortality can be improved by routine blood pressure measurement before AMI, and QRS scoring of the electrocardiogram taken at hospital discharge.\r"

In this study, myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) was performed to assess the coronary collaterals in 29 patients with old myocardial infarction. MCE was performed by intracoronary injection of 2 ml agitated amidotrizoate sodium meglumine. The peak background-subtracted gray level (PGL) in the infarct area was determined from the digitized echocardiographic images obtained before and after injection into the noninfarct and donor artery. PGL was compared with the 3-point coronary angiographic grades of collaterals. PGL in the infarct area was significantly lower in patients with poor collaterals than in patients with moderate to good collaterals (5 +/- 4 vs 18 +/- 8 U mean +/- standard deviation, p less than 0.01). PGL in the infarct area was less than 10 U in the 3 patients with severe asynergy despite the moderate to good collateral supply, suggesting that activity of the collaterals was not good enough to preserve the wall motion effectively. It is concluded that (1) the degree of MCE enhancement in the infarct area generally corresponded to the collateral grades assessed with coronary angiography, and (2) MCE may provide a measure of the collateral perfusion.\r"

The 4 major coronary arteries were sectioned at 5-mm intervals and a drawing of each of the resulting 354 Movat-stained histologic sections was analyzed using a computerized morphometry system. The major component of plaque was a combination of dense acellular and cellular fibrous tissue with much smaller portions of plaque being composed of pultaceous debris, calcium, foam cells with and without inflammatory infiltrates and inflammatory infiltrates without foam cells. There were no differences in plaque composition among any of the 4 major epicardial coronary arteries. Plaque composition varied as a function of the degree of luminal narrowing. Linear increases were observed in the mean percent of dense fibrous tissue (from 5 to 50%), calcific deposits (from 1 to 10%), pultaceous debris (from 0 to 10%) and inflammatory infiltrates without significant numbers of foam cells (from 0 to 5%), and a linear decrease was observed in the mean percent of cellular fibrous tissue (from 94 to 22%) in sections narrowed up to 25% to more than 95% in cross-sectional area. Multiluminal channels were seen in all 10 patients (28 [19%] of the 146 sections narrowed greater than 75% in cross-sectional area and in 36 [10%] of all 354 segments); occlusive thrombi in no patient; nonocclusive thrombi in 2 patients (1 section each of 2 arteries); plaque rupture in 2 patients (4 segments from 2 arteries); and plaque hemorrhages in 6 patients (11 sections from 10 arteries).\r"

The hypothesis was that both the gross peri-infarction block pattern and subtle low-level ventricular late potentials are expressions of conduction abnormality associated with infarction. The consequent question arose whether peri-infarction block may have the same association with sustained ventricular arrhythmias that has been demonstrated in postinfarction patients with ventricular late potentials. Seventy patients with documented Q-wave MI were divided into those with (23) and those without (47) peri-infarction block. Signal-averaged electrocardiograms were obtained. Analysis of the vectormagnitude complex revealed that the total duration of that complex and the duration of terminal potential under 40 microV in the peri-infarction group exceeded that in the group without peri-infarction block (p less than 0.0001). The voltage in the last 40 ms of the vectormagnitude complex was also significantly less in the peri-infarction group (p less than 0.0005). There were 13 instances of sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation or sudden death occurring subsequent to infarction not associated with the acute ischemic event, 11 of which occurred in the peri-infarction group. The significantly higher incidence of late potentials along with the significantly higher incidence of sustained ventricular arrhythmias in the peri-infarction block on the surface electrocardiogram may provide another marker for identifying persons at increased risk for these arrhythmias subsequent to MI.\r"

Changes in intracardiac impedance permit beat-to-beat assessment of ventricular volumes and make this parameter attractive as a rapid discriminator of hemodynamic compromise during arrhythmias. Beat-to-beat changes in right ventricular (RV) impedance were measured before, during and after 27 episodes of ventricular tachyarrhythmias induced in 17 men (64 +/- 7 years, mean +/- standard deviation; left ventricular ejection fraction 41 +/- 11%). Impedance was measured using a tripolar lead system and was compared to ventricular tachycardia cycle length, RV pulse pressure and maximum systolic RV dP/dt as indicators of systemic hemodynamic compromise. The average decreases in systolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure during ventricular tachycardia were 48 +/- 23% and 46 +/- 26%, respectively (mean +/- standard deviation; p less than 0.001 for each). Right ventricular impedance decreased an average 39 +/- 22% from its baseline value (p less than 0.001) during ventricular tachycardia. The percent change in impedance from baseline during ventricular tachycardia correlated significantly with the percent decrease in systolic and mean arterial pressure (r = 0.45 and 0.42, respectively; both p less than 0.05). Right ventricular dP/dt correlated the most poorly of all parameters with changes in blood pressure while impedance X RV pulse pressure correlated best with changes in mean and systolic pressure (r greater than or equal to 0.82, p less than 0.001).\r"

Hypertensive patients were classified according to the difference between their observed and predicted levels of ambulatory BP (the latter assessed by regressing the observed ambulatory BP on the casual BP). When compared to those with lower than predicted ambulatory BP (less than or equal to 10 mm Hg systolic, less than or equal to 6 mm Hg diastolic), patients with higher than predicted ambulatory BP (greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg systolic and greater than or equal to 6mm Hg diastolic) had higher values of LV mass index and other indexes of LV hypertrophy (all p less than 0.01) but had similar values of casual BP. Prevalence of LV hypertrophy was 6 to 10% in the former and 35 to 39% in the latter (p less than 0.001). None of the indexes of LV structure differed between the group with low ambulatory BP and the normotensive group. It is concluded that hypertensive patients whose ambulatory BP readings are notably higher than one would predict from clinical BP readings are at highest risk of LV hypertrophy, an independent prognostic marker.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The placebo group increased aerobic capacity (VO2max) 24% (p less than 0.002), largely explained by an increased peripheral arteriovenous (AV) oxygen difference with minimal changes in cardiac size and function. Resting blood pressure and total systemic resistance also decreased. The group taking a beta 1-selective beta blocker increased VO2max 8% (p less than 0.05), reduced resting blood pressure but had no significant change of AV oxygen difference or cardiac size or function. The group taking the beta 1-nonselective beta blocker propranolol had no increase in VO2max, no decrease in resting blood pressure and no cardiovascular or peripheral adaptations to the exercise program. Thus, beta 1-selective and beta 1-nonselective beta blockers attenuate conditioning in hypertensive patients to differing degrees, in each case by blocking peripheral mechanisms of conditioning.\r"

In this report the models and the assumptions inherent in them were summarized. One model includes left heart chamber compliance, the other does not. Although the models at a superficial glance seem to be contradictory, the conclusions drawn from them are similar: i.e., T1/2 is influenced not only by valve area, but also by initial maximal pressure gradient and by flow. Different clinical situations in which the T1/2 method for valve area estimation has been shown not to work are analyzed in the 2 models. It is concluded that these models have contributed to our understanding of the T1/2 concept and when it should not be used. We also advocate use of the continuity equation in these situations, since no assumptions then need be made.\r"

Mitral regurgitation produced a dynamic signal void in the left atrium in systole in 15 of 16 patients with MR by pulsed Doppler and in an additional 15 of 16 patients whose MR was demonstrated by color flow Doppler. There were no false positives (sensitivity 94%, specificity 100% for both). The ratio of single-plane, maximal jet area to left atrial area was used to grade MR severity with mild defined as less than 20%, moderate between 20 and 40% and severe greater than 40%. Cine MRI classification was identical to pulsed Doppler echocardiography in 26 of 30 patients and to color flow Doppler in 16 of 20 patients with no differences of greater than 1 grade. Cine MRI consistently depicted smaller flow disturbances than pulsed Doppler (slope = 0.65) or color flow Doppler (slope = 0.60). Nonetheless, the cine MRI area ratio correlated well with pulsed Doppler (r = 0.78) and with color flow Doppler (r = 0.74). Thus, planar analysis of cine MRI in patients with MR of varying severity gave results that were similar to Doppler echocardiography. At present, for routine clinical assessment of MR, the benefits of cine MRI may be limited to patients in whom transthoracic Doppler echocardiography is not adequate.\r"

Four of these 5 patients had abnormal signal-averaged electrocardiograms, a finding suggesting the presence of electrical disease despite the absence of left ventricular hypertrophy. The fifth patient, an identical twin of a patient with familial HC, had neither left ventricular hypertrophy nor a myocardial electrical abnormality. These data indicate that the spectrum of HC includes patients who have a potentially arrhythmogenic left ventricular substrate but who have no evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. Our data demonstrating generational skips also imply that some instances of HC previously judged to be sporadic may indeed by familial.\r"

By examining pre- and posttransplantation electrocardiograms (ECGs), it is possible to address questions on the effect of rotation of the heart on its long axis on the surface ECG, the effect of thoracic anatomy on ECG voltage and predisposing factors for conduction defects observed after transplant surgery. To examine these questions, we reviewed a series of 35 matched donor and recipient ECGs. There were no differences in the mean height of the donors and recipients, but age, weight and body surface area were higher in the recipients (p less than 0.025). We found no significant differences in the mean heart rate or precordial voltage but the PR and QT intervals were shorter (p less than 0.025), and the precordial transitional zone was more to the left after transplantation (p less than 0.0005). New evidence of right bundle branch delay was found in 11 recipients and this was not related to pretransplantation hemodynamic factors or the period of ischemic arrest. Thus, there is indeed an anatomic basis for the ECG determination of clockwise rotation of the heart when the precordial transition zone is to the left. Age and body habitus, per se, do not appear to affect precordial voltage and evidence of right bundle delay in the transplant recipient appears to be related to the altered position of the heart and not to injury or changes in right ventricular hemodynamics.\r"

Two hundred thirteen women and 150 men with a wide spectrum of weights, heights, and ages underwent densitometric analysis for the determination of percent body fat (%BF). %BF was then contrasted with various well-established BMIs. Although %BF was correlated with all the BMIs (r = 0.60-0.82), applying objective definitions of obesity based on BMIs or %BF by densitometry often produced conflicting results. It was also found that the 95% confidence intervals for predicting %BF by using Quetelet's index were very wide. Because of the wide variation for individuals between densitometrically determined body fat and body fat as estimated by BMIs, we conclude that BMIs should be used with caution as indicators of obesity.\r"

RMR was measured before, during, and after a 6-mo wrestling season. Wrestlers exhibited a significantly higher baseline RMR compared with the control subjects (p less than 0.05). During the season when wrestlers had lost weight for competition, RMR was reduced (p less than 0.05) but was not significantly lower than that of the weight-stable control subjects. After a season of weight cycling and the final weight regain, the wrestler's postseason RMR was similar to preseason values and higher than the postseason RMR of the control subjects (p less than 0.05). Participation in numerous cycles of weight loss and regain did not lower RMR in these competitive athletes, as has been previously suggested.\r"

  ".U": "90364998\r", 
  ".W": "Studies in this report investigate the existence and quantitative contribution of a metabolic component to an apparently elevated efficiency of energy utilization during refeeding following low-calorie consumption. Energy balance during a 25-d refeeding period was assessed in rats that had been food restricted (at 50% of normal intake) for either 30 or 10 d. Relative to weight-matched controls (with comparable lean tissue mass and similar food intake), refeeding following both periods of low food consumption (30 or 10 d) was associated with a 10% reduction in energy expenditure (p less than 0.001). Analysis of body composition revealed that virtually all the energy saved as a result of this metabolic (as opposed to tissue mass) adaptation was deposited as fat rather than protein. After the energy cost for depositing the extra fat is accounted for, the metabolic component represents a net 15% lower energy expenditure when normal food intake is resumed. These adaptive changes in energy expenditure may thus constitute an important mechanism for the rapid replenishment of energy stores in preparation for recurring food shortages and may also underlie the ease with which the obese condition is rapidly reachieved after weight loss.\r"

Diet and exercise behaviors were determined by use of a questionnaire. As body fat increased, percent of energy intake derived from fat increased (p less than 0.001) whereas the percent from carbohydrate decreased (p less than 0.001). There was no relationship between energy intake and adiposity although leanness and exercise were related (p less than 0.001). When subgroups of lean and obese subjects were compared, the lean subjects derived approximately 29% of their energy from fat and 53% from carbohydrate vs 35% and 46%, respectively, for the obese subjects. No differences were found between groups for energy intake but the lean individuals exercised more often than did the obese individuals.

In human attempts to increase MFe through supplementing the mother with iron during lactation have failed and no correlation between maternal iron status or intake and MFe has been determined, suggesting a regulatory mechanism. In contrast MFe in lactating rats can be affected by very high or low amounts of ingested iron. We previously described a transferrin receptor (TfR) mechanism that controls iron entry into rat mammary tissue. In this study lactating rats were used to determine effects of varying dietary iron during gestation and lactation on mammary TfR and MFe. Dams fed low-iron diets had a small increase in TfR, lower hematological indices (p less than 0.005), and lower MFe (p less than 0.005) than did controls or dams fed high iron. Dams fed the high-iron diet had a significant increase in TfR without a concomitant increase in MFe. There was no correlation between MFe and TfR. These findings suggest that control of MFe lies after iron entry into mammary tissue.\r"

The relative dietary intake of both polyunsaturated and saturated fatty acids correlated with the relative content in adipose tissue (r = 0.6, p = 0.02). Adipose-tissue vitamin E was strongly associated with dietary intake (r = 0.76, p = 0.004). The content of n - 3 (omega-3) fatty acids in adipose tissue was shown to influence adipose-tissue vitamin E negatively. Waist and buttock fat differed (p less than 0.05) with regard to fatty acid composition whereas no systematic variation was seen in the vitamin E content. The use of adipose-tissue biopsies in epidemiologic studies as measures of the habitual relative intake of fatty acids and vitamin E is suggested.\r"

Ten healthy weight-stable subjects (five men, five women) participated. Energy intake was kept constant over the 5-wk study. Total cholesterol concentrations fell significantly within 1 wk of commencing the very-low fat (9%) energy from fat) lean-beef (500 g/d) diet (5.91 +/- 0.47 to 4.72 +/- 0.42 mmol/L, p less than 0.001) and rose as beef drippings were added in a stepwise manner in weeks 4 and 5 (5.45 +/- 0.56 mmol/L in week 5). The changes in total cholesterol concentrations were due almost entirely to changes in the concentration of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. These results indicate that it is the beef fat, not lean beef itself, that is associated with elevations in cholesterol concentrations and that lean beef can be included in cholesterol-lowering diets provided it is free of all visible fat and the saturated fatty acid content of the diet is low.\r"

Accreditation guidelines for residency programs suggested eight nutrition components that were endorsed by content experts for inclusion in residency training. Directors and nutrition educators from all accredited residencies in the United States were surveyed to determine the perceived importance of the components and the extent to which the components were actually present. The eight components appear to be relevant for exemplary nutrition training at the residency level. An important identified need is to train and involve more clinical-nutrition faculty members in residency programs.\r"

  ".W": "To enable the prenatal diagnosis of beta-thalassemia by direct detection of the mutant beta-globin genes, we have determined the spectrum of mutations causing this disease in Thailand. The techniques employed included a combination of synthetic oligonucleotide probe hybridization, direct sequencing of genomic DNA enzymatically amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, and cloning and sequencing of the beta-globin genes. A total of 116 beta-thalassemia genes from 78 Hb E/beta-thalassemia patients and from 19 homozygous beta-thalassemia patients were analyzed, and the mutation was characterized in 112/116 (97%) of them. Eleven mutations were found, of which four (-CTTT in codon 41/42, AAG----TAG in codon 17, C----T in position 654 of the IVS-2 region, and A----G in position -28 upstream of the beta-globin gene) accounted for 83%; two previously undescribed mutations have been identified. The spectrum of beta-thalassemia mutations is similar to that reported among the Chinese. However, within the Thai population itself, patients with homozygous beta-thalassemia show a wider spread of mutations in comparison with the Hb E/beta-thalassemia group, in whom the frameshift 41/42 mutation predominates at a frequency of 62%. This difference in distribution may reflect the difference in ethnic origin of the two groups. Characterization of these mutations should aid the planning of a prenatal diagnosis program for beta-thalassemia in Thailand.\r"

Because the cardiac MHC genes also map to this chromosomal band, we have determined the genetic distances between the cardiac beta MHC gene, D14S26, and the familial HC locus. Data presented here show that these three loci are linked within 5 centimorgans on chromosome 14 at q11-q12.

  ".W": "alpha 1-Antitrypsin (alpha 1AT) deficiency, a common hereditary disorder responsible for emphysema in Caucasians of northern European descent, is caused by single base substitutions, deletions, or additions in the seven exons (IA-IC and II-V), of the 12.2-kb alpha 1AT gene located on chromosome 14 at q31-32.3. Of the five known representatives of the \"null\" group of alpha 1AT-deficiency alleles (alpha 1AT genes incapable of producing alpha 1AT protein detectable in serum) evaluated at the gene level, all result from mutations causing the formation of stop codons in coding exons of the alpha 1AT gene. The present study identifies an alpha 1AT allele (referred to as \"Null(isola di procida\")) caused by complete deletion of the alpha 1AT coding exons. The Null(isola di procida) allele was identified in an individual with heterozygous inheritance of M(procida) (an allele associated with alpha 1AT deficiency) and a null allele. Although results of karyotypic analysis were normal, quantification of the copies of alpha 1AT genes in this individual revealed that the index case had only half the normal copies of alpha 1AT genes. Cloning and mapping of the Null(isola di procida) gene demonstrated a deletion of a 17-kb fragment that included exons II-V of the alpha 1AT structural gene. As a consequence of the deletion, the normal noncoding exons (IA-IC) were followed by exons II-V of the downstream alpha 1AT-like gene. Sequence analysis of the deletion demonstrated a 7-bp repeat sequence (GAGGACA) both 5' to the deletion and at the 3' end of the deletion, a 4-bp palindromic sequence (ACAG vs. CTGT) bracketing the deletion, and a novel inserted 4-bp sequence (CCTG) at the breakpoint, suggesting that the mechanism of the deletion may have been \"slipped mispairing.\"\r"

Statural growth is normal and macroorchidism does not occur. Longevity is not impaired. High-resolution chromosomes, serum creatine kinase, and amino acids are normal.

Initial disease-to-marker analysis suggested linkage to three markers (DXYS2 [7b], DXS250 [GMGX22], and DXS3 [p19-2]) located in Xq21. All three exhibited the same maximum lod score of 2.3 at a maximum theta of .05. Multipoint analysis using LINKMAP and a set of four DNA markers (DXYS1-DXYS2-DXS3-DXS94) gave a multipoint lod score of 3.58 for a location of the Allan-Herndon syndrome near locus DXYS1 (pDP34). Therefore, our data indicate that the gene for the Allan-Herndon syndrome is likely located in Xq21.\r"

The cell-cycle sensitivity correlates with the mutant's inability to repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) produced by ionizing radiation and restriction enzymes. We have previously shown in somatic cell hybrids of XR-1 cells and human fibroblasts that the XR-1 mutation is a recessive mutation. In this study, using somatic cell hybrids formed between XR-1 and human fibroblasts, we map the human complementing gene to chromosome 5 by chromosome-segregation analysis. This gene biochemically restores the hamster defect to wild-type levels of gamma-ray and bleomycin resistance as well as restoring its proficiency to repair DNA DSBs, suggesting that a single gene is responsible for the XR-1 phenotype. We have tentatively assigned the name XRCC4 (X-ray-complementing Chinese hamster gene 4) to this human gene until its biochemical function in repair is discovered.\r"

Method performance was assessed using the mean rank of the true order, the proportion of replicates in which the true order was the best order, and the number of orders that needed to be considered for subsequent multipoint linkage analysis in order to include the true order with high probability. A new method which maximizes the sum of adjacent two-point maximum lod scores divided by the equivalent number of informative meioses and the previously described method which minimizes the sum of adjacent recombination fraction estimates were found to be the best overall locus-ordering methods for the situations considered, although several other methods also performed well.\r"

The most common X-linked recessive form involves the CYBB locus in band Xp21.1 that encodes the membrane-bound beta subunit of the cytochrome b558 complex. Two autosomal recessive forms of CGD result from defects in cytosolic components of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase system, p47phox (NCF1) and p67phox (NCF2). By using human cDNA probes we have mapped the genes for these proteins to chromosomal sites. The combined data from Southern analysis of somatic cell hybrid lines and chromosomal in situ hybridization localize NCF1 to 7q11.23 and NCF2 to band 1q25. The NCF1 localization corrects an erroneous preliminary assignment to chromosome 10. In the mouse, the locus corresponding to NCF2 (Ncf-2) was mapped with somatic cell hybrid panels and recombinant inbred strains to mouse chromosome 1 near Xmv-21 within a region of conserved homology with human chromosome 1 region q21-q32. A second site, probably a processed pseudogene, was identified on mouse chromosome 13.\r"

The initial diagnosis of i(18p) was by standard cytogenetic techniques and was confirmed by in situ hybridization with a biotinylated alphoid probe (L1.84) specific for the pericentric region of chromosome 18 and with a tritium-labeled chromosome 18 probe (B74) which hybridizes to the D18S3 locus situated at 18p11.3. The clinical features of the cases are summarized and shown to constitute a distinct and recognizable syndrome. Common features were low birth weight, a characteristic facies, neonatal hypotonia with subsequent limb spasticity, short stature, microcephaly, mental retardation, and seizure disorders. On the basis of size and cytogenetic banding a marker chromosome can be suspected to be an i(18p). In situ hybridization with the alphoid probe L1.84 provides confirmation of chromosome 18 origin. This more precise diagnosis will be an advantage in situations of pre- and postnatal diagnosis, since parents can be provided with a more confident prognosis for their child.\r"

The incidence of 121 HaeIII DNA fragments among 33 cell lines derived from unrelated individuals was used to estimate allelic and genotypic frequencies for each fragment and for composite individual DNA fingerprints. We present a quantitative estimate of the extent of genetic difference between individuals, an estimate based on the percentage of restriction fragments at which they differ. The average percent difference (APD) among pairwise combinations from the population of 33 unrelated cell lines was 76.9%, compared with the APD in band sharing among cell lines derived from the same individual (less than or equal to 1.2%). Included in this survey were nine additional cell lines previously implicated as HeLa cell derivatives, and these lines were clearly confirmed as such by DNA fingerprints (APD less than or equal to 0.6%). On the basis of fragment frequencies in the tested cell line population, a simple genetic model was developed to estimate the frequencies of each DNA fingerprint in the population. The median incidence was 2.9 X 10(-17), and the range was 2.4 X 10(-21) to 6.6 X 10(-15). This value approximates the probability that a second cell line selected at random from unrelated individuals will match a given DNA fingerprint. Related calculations address the chance that any two DNA fingerprints would be identical among a large group of cell lines. This estimate is still very slight; for example, the chance of two or more common DNA fingerprints among 1 million distinct individuals is less than .001. The procedure provides a straightforward, easily interpreted, and statistically robust method for identification and individualization of human cells.\r"

The distribution of alleles varies significantly between most of these populations. In Caucasians, the allele frequencies range from 4.3% to 28.5%.

  ".U": "90365046\r", 
  ".W": "Recently Dryja and his co-workers observed a mutation in the 23d codon of the rhodopsin gene in a proportion of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (ADRP) patients. Linkage analysis with a rhodopsin-linked probe C17 (D3S47) was carried out in two large British ADRP families, one with diffuse-type (D-type) RP and the other with regional-type (R-type) RP. Significantly positive lod scores (lod score maximum [Zmax] = +5.58 at recombination fraction [theta] = .0) were obtained between C17 and our D-type ADRP family showing complete penetrance. Sequence and oligonucleotide analysis has, however, shown that no point mutation at the 23d codon exists in affected individuals in our complete-penetrance pedigree, indicating that another rhodopsin mutation is probably responsible for ADRP in this family. Significantly negative lod scores (Z less than -2 at theta = .045) were, however, obtained between C17 and our R-type family which showed incomplete penetrance. Previous results presented by this laboratory also showed no linkage between C17 and another large British R-type ADRP family with incomplete penetrance. This confirms genetic heterogeneity. Some types of ADRP are being caused by different mutations in the rhodopsin locus (3q21-24) or another tightly linked gene in this region, while other types of ADRP are the result of mutations elsewhere in the genome.\r"

  ".W": "Characterizing the distribution of parameters of iron metabolism by hemochromatosis genotype remains an important goal vis-a-vis potential screening strategies to identify individuals at genetic risk, since a specific marker to detect the abnormal gene has not been identified as yet. In the present investigation, we analyze serum iron values in ascertained families using a method which incorporates both segregation of the clinical affection status and the HLA linkage information to identify the underlying genotypes. The analysis is performed using an extension of the model presented by Bonney et al., comprising regressive models for segregation analysis and the multipoint linkage strategy implemented in LINKAGE. The gene was found to be completely recessive with respect to both clinical manifestations and serum iron abnormalities, with significant differences in expression by sex. Clinical manifestations were present for all male homozygotes in this data set, suggesting that the recessive hemochromatosis genotype is fully penetrant at all ages in males. This was not the case for younger females. Significant genotype-specific age and sex effects were found for serum iron values. It is interesting that deletion of the HLA marker information did not affect our ability to resolve the genetic model when we analyzed a bivariate phenotype. This serves as a reminder that a search for relevant biological markers can be equally important in discerning the genetic etiology of a disease trait, as a search for linked genetic markers.\r"

A hitherto undescribed single nucleotide transversion was found within exon 11 (G1260----C; Trp420----Cys). The coding sequence was otherwise entirely normal. Expression in the COS I cell system confirmed that the mutant gene does not produce functional enzyme protein. The mutation can be identified rapidly and reliably because it abolishes one of the two KpnI sites in the coding sequence. The patient was a compound heterozygote with one allele carrying this mutation. The nature of the abnormality in the other allele remains unidentified. Examination of genomic DNA from the parents demonstrated that this \"Kpn mutation\" was inherited from the maternal side of the family.\r"

  ".W": "Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD; E.C.1.1.1.49) deficiency is the most common human enzymopathy; more than 300 different biochemical variants of the enzyme have been described. In many parts of the world the Mediterranean type of G6PD deficiency is prevalent. However, G6PD Mediterranean has come to be regarded as a generic term applied to similar G6PD mutations thought, however, to represent a somewhat heterogeneous group. A C----T mutation at nucleotide 563 of G6PD Mediterranean has been identified by Vulliamy et al., and the same mutation has been found by De Vita et al. in G6PD Mediterranean, G6PD Sassari, and G6PD Cagliari. The latter subjects had an additional mutation, at nucleotide 1311, that did not produce a coding change. We have examined genomic DNA of five patients--four of Spanish origin and one of Jewish origin--having enzymatically documented G6PD Mediterranean. All had both the mutation at nucleotide 563 and that at nucleotide 1311. A sixth sample, resembling G6PD Mediterranean kinetically but with a slightly rapid electrophoretic mobility, was designated G6PD Andalus and was found to have a different mutation, a G----A transition at nucleotide 1361, producing an arginine-to-histidine substitution. These studies suggest that G6PD Mediterranean is, after all, relatively homogeneous.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the tolerance and efficacy of itraconazole in the treatment of coccidioidomycosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-one patients with nonmeningeal coccidioidomycosis were considered for treatment with intraconazole. Forty-nine patients who met study criteria were treated with itraconazole given orally in doses of 100 to 400 mg/day for periods up to 39 months. Of these patients, 12 had osteoarticular disease, 23 had chronic pulmonary disease, and 14 had skin or soft tissue disease. Clinical response was evaluated using a scoring system accounting for lesion number and size, symptoms, culture, and serologic titer. Remission was defined as reduction of the pretreatment score by 50% or more. RESULTS: Patients with osteoarticular, chronic pulmonary, and soft tissue disease improved at similar rates. Because two patients had no scoring assessment for efficacy, they were considered inassessable for efficacy. Forty-seven patients are evaluable. Of these patients, 44 have completed therapy, and three are still receiving itraconazole. Of the 44 patients no longer receiving therapy, 25 (57%) achieved remission. Of the 25 patients achieving remission, four later experienced a relapse. Therapy failed in 19 patients (43%). Of these cases, 16 (36%) were clinical failures and three (7%) developed drug intolerance that precluded continuation of treatment. Evaluation of culture conversions was of limited value in the osteoarticular patients, fewer than half of whom had follow-up biopsies. However, culture conversions were a useful index of response in patients with chronic pulmonary disease. During the course of treatment, serologic titers declined in the two groups with extrapulmonary disease, but not in patients with pulmonary coccidioidomycosis. Possible toxicities were generally mild. CONCLUSION: Itraconazole appears efficacious and very well tolerated in patients with coccidioidomycosis.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Computerized records of our community-based university teaching hospital over a 10-year period (1978 to 1987) were analyzed. A total of 109 patients were identified, including 12 who did not have miliary nodules on the chest radiograph (all of whom were shown to have hematogenous dissemination). Predisposing conditions were present in 46 patients. RESULTS: Clinical features were similar to those of previously reported series. Hematologic abnormalities were common: leukopenia (less than 4 x 10(9)/L) was present in 16 of 107 patients (15%), thrombocytopenia (less than 150 x 10(9)/L) in 24 of 104 (23%), and lymphopenia (less than 1.5 x 10(9)/L) in 82 of 94 (87%). Pancytopenia was found in six patients, three of whom recovered. Disseminated intravascular coagulation occurred in four patients, all of whom died. Adenosine deaminase levels were elevated in only seven of 11 serosal exudates and in seven of 12 samples of abnormal cerebrospinal fluid. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was diagnostic in 44 of 51 patients (86%), bone marrow examination in 19 of 22 (86%), and liver biopsy in all 10 patients. Twenty-six patients (24%) died of miliary tuberculosis a median of 6 days after starting treatment. Survivors were followed up for a median of 51 weeks. Stepwise logistic regression identified aged (greater than 60 years), lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, elevated transaminase levels, and treatment delay as independent predictors of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Miliary tuberculosis commonly causes hematologic derangements, some of which are helpful prognostically. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy compares favorably to liver and bone marrow biopsy in sputum smear-negative cases. Mortality remains high and treatment should be begun as soon as the diagnosis is suspected.\r"

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Original cohort subjects with chest discomfort were classified by their history into three groups: definite angina, possible angina, or nonanginal chest discomfort. Subjects were followed for 2 years for CHD events, including coronary insufficiency, myocardial infarction, or CHD death. RESULTS: Compared to that in subjects without chest discomfort, the relative odds of a CHD event was 3.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.11, 6.60) in men with definite angina and 3.0 (95% CI 1.33, 6.69) in men with possible angina. Comparable increased CHD risk was also observed in women with definite or possible angina, with relative odds of 5.4 (95% CI 3.08, 9.30) and 2.9 (95% CI 1.13, 7.17), respectively. The increase in CHD risk associated with definite or possible angina persisted after adjustment for cardiac risk factor profile. There was no increase in risk associated with nonanginal chest discomfort. CONCLUSION: CHD risk is increased in subjects with new chest discomfort that on the basis of history is consistent with definite or possible angina, whereas CHD risk is not increased in subjects with nonanginal chest discomfort. The presence of chest discomfort and its characteristics facilitate the classification of subjects into meaningful categories that offer prognostic information beyond that provided by traditional CHD risk factors.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated retrospectively the effects of immunotherapy with IL2 in 76 patients with disseminated cancer. The lymphokine was administered by constant infusion, daily for 6 days a week for 4 consecutive weeks. RESULTS: A significant decrease in platelet counts was seen after the first 6 days of therapy in all but two patients: 14 patients experienced grade 2 or 3 toxicity, 21 had grade 1 toxicity, and although the decrease in platelet counts could not be graded as toxicity in the remaining 41 patients, there was an average decrease of 32% from baseline platelet counts in 39 (p less than 0.0001). Thrombocytopenia appeared to be secondary to peripheral platelet destruction, since bone marrow biopsy specimens obtained during thrombocytopenia showed hyperplastic megakaryocytopoiesis. IL2 is inactivated by tubular resorption, and severity of thrombocytopenia was strongly correlated with IL2-induced renal dysfunction (p = 0.0004). Additionally, both renal dysfunction and thrombocytopenia were related to total dose of IL2 and were more pronounced in patients with worse baseline renal function and lower baseline platelet counts. The incidence of thrombocytopenia increased with subsequent IL2 therapy: life-threatening thrombocytopenia (less than 25,000/microL) was seen in nine of 57 patients, five of whom required transfusional platelet support. CONCLUSION: On the basis of preliminary observations, we hypothesize that thrombocytopenia induced by IL2 is caused by accelerated clearance of platelets by the reticuloendothelial system.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 155 women were divided into the following treatment groups: Group A: patients taking HCQ and no steroids (n = 58); Group B: patients taking steroids and no HCQ (n = 35); Group C: patients receiving both HCQ and steroids (n = 18); and Group D: patients receiving neither HCQ nor steroids (n = 44). RESULTS: HCQ therapy had a high statistical association with low serum levels of cholesterol (181 mg/dL; p = 0.0006), triglycerides (106 mg/dL; p = 0.0459), and LDL (101 mg/dL; p = 0.0004), irrespective of concomitant steroid administration. The HCQ-treated group (A) had lower cholesterol (181 mg/dL; p = 0.0039) and LDL (101 mg/dL; p = 0.007) levels than those receiving neither HCQ nor steroids (205 mg/dL) and 128 mg/dL) (Group D). No HDL differences were observed. CONCLUSION: The effects of HCQ do not appear to be due to changes in diet or weight, and the drug was well tolerated. Although the mechanism of cholesterol lowering by HCQ is not known, this drug deserves further investigation for its lipid-lowering properties.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare patients with primary hyperparathyroidism with and without nephrolithiasis with regard to (1) biochemical profile, and (2) presence and extent of bone involvement. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 70 unselected patients enrolled in a longitudinal study on the natural history of primary hyperparathyroidism, 62 who underwent complete bone densitometry evaluation were considered. The patients had mild hypercalcemia (2.77 +/- 0.02 mmol/L), as well as elevated parathyroid hormone levels by mid-molecule, N-terminal, and immunoradiometric assays. Bone densitometry was assessed by dual-photon absorptiometry of the lumbar spine and femoral neck, and single-photon absorptiometry of the forearm. RESULTS: Eleven of the 62 patients (18%) had nephrolithiasis. There was no difference in serum parathyroid hormone levels, calcium, phosphorus, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 between those with and without kidney stones. Total daily urinary calcium excretion was higher among those who formed stones (8.2 +/- 1.0 mmol versus 6.1 +/- 0.4 mmol, p less than 0.05), but not when expressed per mmol of creatinine (0.72 +/- 0.07 versus 0.69 +/- 0.04). Urinary hydroxyproline was also higher in patients who formed stones (58 +/- 11 mg/24 hours versus 37 +/- 2 mg/24 hours; p less than 0.05). Hypercalciuria occurred in 39% of the entire cohort (n = 24), and in 33% (n = 17) of those without stones. Only 29% (n = 7) of those with hypercalciuria had nephrolithiasis. Calcium excretion correlated positively with serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (r = +0.32, p less than 0.05), and negatively with forearm bone mineral density (all patients: r = -0.34, p less than 0.05; hypercalciuric patients: r = -0.53, p less than 0.05). Circulating 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 levels were elevated in a similar proportion of (1) all patients (31%, n = 19); (2) those with nephrolithiasis (27%); and (3) those without stones (31%). Bone mineral density was less than 80% of normal in 61% of patients, but forearm, femoral neck, and lumbar spine density were indistinguishable among those with and without stones. CONCLUSIONS: Cortical bone demineralization occurs to the same extent and frequency in patients with and without nephrolithiasis, and these two subgroups share similar biochemical and bone densitometric profiles. The pathophysiologic events leading to renal and skeletal involvement in primary hyperparathyroidism may be less selective than previously believed, as evidenced by: (1) increased urinary hydroxyproline in patients with nephrolithiasis, and (2) documentation that urinary calcium excretion reflects not only vitamin D status, but bone resorption was well.\r"

Clinicians were presented with a standard case of a patient complaining of difficulty sleeping, with the age of the patient depicted as either 37 years or 77 years. Historical information was provided in response to practitioners' questions. In evaluating the history, physicians asked an average of 2.5 questions and were most likely to ask about psychologic problems. Only 47% of the physicians who were presented with the elderly case vignette elicited a sleep history. By contrast, nurse practitioners asked an average of 3.2 questions, and 60% of them took a sleep history. Despite many possible non-pharmacologic therapies for the patients presented, 46% of physicians identified a prescription medication as the single most effective therapy for the older patient, compared with 17% of nurse practitioners. These findings suggest that physicians place inadequate emphasis on history-taking in the evaluation of insomnia and resort to the use of psychoactive drugs even when non-pharmacologic approaches might be more effective.\r"

Sixty-five (32%) of the articles were classified as experimental, with most of the remaining observational studies classified as cross-sectional in design. A reader with the knowledge of only simple descriptive statistics would be able to understand 60% of the statistical procedures used in the published papers. Knowledge of the usual components of a single semester course in introductory statistics increases understanding to 91% of the techniques used. It was determined that 148 (73.5%) of the 201 articles had at least 1 detectable statistical error; most of these errors involved improper documentation or application of statistical hypothesis testing. The most common descriptive statistical error was the misuse of the concepts of \"standard deviation\" and \"standard error\" which was found in greater than 20% of the articles. Examples of each of the common statistical errors seen are given with suggestions for improvement.\r"

The following strains of mice were susceptible to infective larvae development for 2 weeks after primary ip challenge: BALB/c, C3H/HeJ, C3H/NeN, C3H/HeJms, C57BL/6Jms, and DDD. In comparison to gerbils, BALB/c mice developed stronger resistance to infective larvae after immunization with irradiation attenuated larvae or with killed microfilariae (mf). However, killed mf failed to enhance resistance in C3H/HeJ mice, although C3H/HeN mice were strongly protected and C3H/HeJms mice were protected to a lesser degree by this antigen. Extracts of mf with phosphate buffered saline and sodium dodecyl sulfate both induced high levels of resistance in BALB/c mice. Transfer of resistance from BALB/c mice immunized with attenuated infective larvae to naive mice was accomplished at a high level at protection with nylon wool nonadherent spleen cells (T cells) but not with adherent cells treated with anti-Thy 1.2 serum and complement. In contrast, sera from immunized mice were much less protective.\r"

Parasite antigen specific IgG and IgE levels were determined by ELISA. IgG levels in children were significantly elevated in humoral immunoreactivity to Brugia pahangi extracts compared to adults. In addition, anti-filarial IgG levels in amicrofilaremic children were significantly greater than in microfilaremic children. In contrast, IgG levels in adults were equivalent independent of microfilaremic status. Anti-filarial IgE levels in sera from both children and adults were low in comparison to that of a subject with tropical pulmonary eosinophilia and were unrelated to clinical status. No correlations were found between humoral responses and age, sex, or degree of parasitemia. Sera from amicrofilaremic children and, to a lesser extent, adults recognize more antigens, particularly those of high molecular weight (greater than 55 kDa), than sera from microfilaremic patients.\r"

Sera of occult, amicrofilaremic (OL), and 'resistant' individuals with no clinical signs of infection (R) reacted with an antigen of 160 kDa; sera of highly microfilaremic individuals (ML) did not. ML sera strongly reacted with an antigen of 18 kDa which was recognized only weakly or not at all by OL and R sera. At higher dilutions, OL sera only reacted with antigens at 23 and 160 kDa and ML sera reacted with antigens at 18 and 23 kDa, whereas R sera reacted with antigens at 23, 42, 54, 70, 100, and 160 kDa. These data suggested that R sera contained a higher concentration of antibodies which reacted with denatured, nitrocellulose-bound antigens. The IgG4 isotype predominated for all groups of sera, while IgG3 antibody responses were observed only with R sera. IgG1 antibodies were seen in all groups but reacted with fewer antigens than IgG4 antibodies, and no IgG2 antibody responses were detected. Sera against Brugia malayi, Wuchereria bancrofti, Onchocerca volvulus, and Dirofilaria immitis cross-reacted with somatic antigens greater than 70 kDa, whereas none reacted with Loa loa antigens less than 23 kDa.\r"

Expression of parasite antigen was demonstrated by the following: 2 histogram flow cytometric analyses, in which a population of hybrid cells in the population of 7 month cultured hybrid cells showed 57% more fluorescence when treated with an anti-F. hepatica serum followed by anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate as compared with the same hybrid cells washed and treated with normal rabbit serum; Sp2 myeloma cells treated with an anti-F. hepatica serum or normal rabbit serum followed by fluorescein-labeled anti-rabbit IgG had the same negative fluorescence; BALB/c mice immunized with PBS-washed cells from a subclone of these hybridomas developed anti-F. hepatica antibodies (shown by the Falcon assay screening test enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay); and antibodies recognized an F. hepatica antigenic polypeptide of 57,000 Mr in a Western immunoblot. These helminth:myeloma hybrids expressed murine host markers, further confirming the hybrid nature of this cell line. F. hepatica cells alone, like their Sp2 fusion partners, die in HAT supplemented medium by 9 days of culture. F. hepatica:Sp2 hybridomas have been grown continuously in HAT medium for greater than 1 year.\r"

Thirty of these children were less than 2 years of age and were admitted to a single pediatric ward. Seventeen of the cases, infected with V. cholerae (MARV) resistant to several antibiotics, were admitted to the hospital for non-gastrointestinal illnesses; these children developed diarrhea and positive cultures for MARV 1-greater than 10 days after admission. The majority of cases occurred in September, when the attack rate in the patient population in 1 pediatric ward was 11.5%. During this period, MARV with the same characteristics was isolated from water used for bathing in a reservoir on the pediatric ward where most of the cases occurred. MARV was not isolated from adults with diarrhea at the hospital. No further MARV infections occurred at the hospital after the water reservoir had been drained and disinfected. V. cholerae isolates from children and water contained a conjugative incompatibility group C plasmid of 100 megadaltons (mDa) encoding resistance to Ap, Cm, Nm, Km, Gm, TMP-SMZ, and Tc. This plasmid hybridized with a DNA probe for genes encoding Type II dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). As far as we know, this is the first report of MARV with V. cholerae that contained genes coding for Type II DHFR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A total of 536 subjects, including 202 female prostitutes, 95 long-distance truck drivers, 103 soldiers, 72 Ethiopian refugees, and 54 Sudanese outpatients, were enrolled in the study. Seventy-eight percent (202/259) of the female study subjects were engaged in prostitution, and 57% (157/277) of the men admitted to prior sexual relations with prostitutes. Serologic markers for hepatitis B and syphilis were detected in 68% and 17% of the entire study population, respectively. In contrast, antibody to HIV-1 was detected in none of the 536 sera tested. Risk factors found to be independently predictive of hepatitis B infection by multivariate analysis included prostitution, positive serology for syphilis, and a history of anti-schistosomal therapy. The absence of HIV-1 infection among the prostitutes enrolled in this study is in marked contrast to the current AIDS epidemic in neighboring sub-Saharan countries, suggesting that HIV-1 has not been widely introduced on the coast of Sudan. The high prevalence of serologic markers to hepatitis B and syphilis, however, indicates a potential for HIV-1 in this region.\r"

Among the histological parameters of importance in the identification of double and triple bloodmeals are the peritrophic membrane secreted around each bloodmeal, the plug which forms between the anterior and posterior midgut, the layer of heme which forms as a bloodmeal is digested, and remnants of the pupal meconium and/or pupal-pharate adult peritrophic membranes. The parameters we have identified will help determine the incidence of double bloodfeeding in wild populations which, in turn, should enhance our understanding of the transmission of pathogens by mosquitoes.\r"

  ".W": "During the past 13 years, 261 patients with ulcerative colitis and 29 with colonic polyposis underwent endorectal pullthrough (ERP) at UCLA Medical Center. Of the first 111 consecutive patients to undergo ERP, 5 returned to a permanent ileostomy because of persistent symptoms related to reservoir stasis. Transabdominal shortening of the reservoir was performed in 38 of the 111 patients; 24 experienced marked clinical improvement. Fourteen of the 38 patients had persistent stasis and required shortening of the ileal spout either transanally (5 patients) or via an abdominoperineal approach (9 patients). Eighteen of the initial 111 patients underwent one-stage abdominoperineal reservoir reconstruction. During the past 4 years, 8 of 149 consecutive patients with a primary lateral isoperistaltic reservoir underwent subsequent abdominoperineal reservoir reconstruction. Fourteen of 18 patients with a straight pullthrough with reservoir underwent reconstruction to a lateral isoperistaltic reservoir. An aggressive operative approach to the management of pouchitis and reservoir stasis (diarrhea, frequency, urgency, incomplete emptying) has resulted in only 4 of the last 246 consecutive patients returning to a permanent ileostomy. Several changes in the operative technique have evolved during the 13-year period. Important features for optimal pouch function appear to include: (1) a short rectal muscle cuff, (2) a small ileal reservoir, (3) a short ileal spout, (4) removal of all rectal mucosa, and (5) aggressive correction of rectal strictures.\r"

The aim of this study was to determine the cause of the dysrhythmias and whether they could be eliminated with pacing. A set of four dogs (Group A) underwent three sequential operations: placement of jejunal electrodes at sites corresponding to the Roux limb; construction of a Roux limb without vagotomy, gastrectomy, or gastrojejunostomy; and transthoracic truncal vagotomy. A second set of five dogs (Group B) underwent truncal vagotomy, distal gastrectomy, and Roux gastrojejunostomy with recording electrodes placed on the Roux limb and a pacing electrode situated at the proximal end of the limb. Electrical recordings were obtained on four separate occasions after each operation. In Group A dogs, orad and disordered propagation of jejunal pacesetter potentials occurred in the Roux limb 56 +/- 5% of the time after limb construction but never before construction. The pattern was not changed with vagotomy. In Group B dogs, electrical dysrhythmias in the Roux limb also occurred and were corrected with electrical pacing. We concluded that electrical dysrhythmias in the canine Roux limb are secondary to the jejunal transection done during Roux limb construction, and are not due to gastrectomy, gastroenterostomy, or vagotomy. The dysrhythmias can be corrected with pacing.\r"

Although the circumference and thickness of the wall were not different than at 12 weeks, degenerative changes occurred. The endothelial lining of the graft appeared intact, but large segments of the graft surface no longer excluded Evans blue dye, suggesting increased permeability. Collections of red blood cells were noted within the intima. Several grafts had extensive subendothelial fibrin deposits, often associated with foam cells, and evidence of previous hemorrhage, but these changes did not stimulate significant smooth muscle cell proliferation. Increased permeability with entrance of proteins and erythrocytes into the intima may result from increased wall tension or from low shear rates at the wall. Similar changes may lead to atherosclerosis in human vein grafts at late times.\r"

One typical carcinoid tumor larger than 2 cm had both several lymphatic permeations and urinary bladder invasion. All cases had a good prognosis with no recurrence and no new metastases. For rectal carcinoid tumors less than 2 cm in diameter, local resection is sufficient, whereas radical operation is required for tumors larger than 2 cm in diameter. For atypical rectal carcinoid tumors, radical operation should be considered even if the diameter is less than 2 cm.\r"

Ninety-three patients were evaluated before and after 8 weeks of therapy with pentoxifylline, while 8 did not complete the entire course due to adverse drug reactions. Resting and post-stress ankle/arm Doppler indices (AAIs) were measured and, in those patients who could walk on a treadmill, treadmill walking distances were measured. Patients were classified according to pretreatment clinical and treadmill measurements and according to pretreatment resting AAIs. Resting and post-stress AAIs, as well as treadmill walking distances, increased in patients with moderately severe claudication. Patients in this group responded better to therapy than did patients with rest pain or ischemic ulcers, severe claudication, or mild claudication. Patients with a pretreatment resting AAI greater than or equal to 0.5 responded better than those with an AAI less than 0.5. Only 5% of patients reported satisfaction with the results of treatment. These results support the findings that pentoxifylline may be useful only in selected patients with moderately severe peripheral vascular disease of the lower extremity and may not be useful in those with severe or mild disease.\r"

All of the 26 adenomatous goiters and 43 follicular adenomas were peroxidase-positive. In the 74 cases of thyroid carcinomas examined, about half of the follicular carcinomas (17 of 33 patients), and a few papillary carcinomas (3 of 41 patients) were peroxidase-positive. Peroxidase-negative cases were seen in 70% (52 of 74 patients) of the follicular and papillary carcinomas. All the non-tumorous thyroid tissues adjacent to various disorders were peroxidase-positive. Since our histochemically demonstrated peroxidase activities almost parallel those determined biochemically and ultrastructural-cytochemically, we conclude that histochemical examination is a simple and useful method for the detection of peroxidase activity. As for the relationships between histochemically proved peroxidase activity and the histology of tumors, the histological differentiation of tumors was not consistent with their functional differentiation classified according to peroxidase activity.\r"

This report is a retrospective review of 46 patients who were treated using a combination of iliac transluminal angioplasty and infrainguinal reconstruction. There were 42 male and 4 female patients with an average age of 62 years (range: 40 to 74 years). Follow-up ranged from 1 month to 10 years (mean: 27.3 months). These patients had multiple health problems typical of patients with peripheral vascular disease, including coronary artery disease (67%), hypertension (61%), and diabetes mellitus (42%); 80% of the patients were smokers. Forty-one patients were treated for rest pain and/or tissue loss, while five were treated for incapacitating claudication. Forty-three patients had a combination of angioplasty and distal bypass, while 3 patients had a form of femoral endarterectomy. Iliac artery pressure gradients were reduced from 35.4 +/- 4 mm Hg preangioplasty to 0.6 +/- 0.3 mm Hg postangioplasty. The procedures were well tolerated with no mortality and four serious complications. Vascular laboratory studies showed an improvement in the mean ankle-brachial index from 0.35 +/- 0.03 preoperatively to 0.71 +/- 0.04 postoperatively (p less than 0.05). Life-table analysis revealed a 72% 5-year primary patency rate, with a 93% 5-year limb salvage. Eight patients required a secondary procedure to maintain limb salvage. Five patients underwent amputation, three due to early graft thrombosis and two due to late graft failure. We conclude that combined iliac angioplasty and infrainguinal reconstruction is a safe and effective method for managing the patient with severe multilevel atherosclerotic disease.\r"

The survival interval of these eight patients (mean +/- SD) was 35 +/- 20 days. Three patients had tumor fragments in the common bile ducts. In two patients, major hepatic resection was done after initial tube decomposition of the biliary system. One patient remained tumor-free on follow-up at 24 months, and the other patient had recurrent tumor detected on follow-up at 17 months after surgery. The tumor was irresectable in the third patient. Multiple surgical and endoscopic procedures kept the bile duct patent for 17 months before the patient died of the disease. Not all patients who present with obstructive jaundice due to HCC are terminally ill. With proper management, good palliation and occasional cure are possible.\r"

We evaluated the DGR levels in 15 patients before and after simple cholecystectomy for gallstones and compared the results with those of 15 healthy subjects. Gastric juice was obtained by continuous nasogastric suction for 24 hours. The bile acids (BA) present in the samples were quantified by thin-layer chromatography and in situ spectrofluorometry. The mean BA concentration for the control subjects was 2.25 mumol reflux/hour, whereas the mean value for the 15 patients with cholelithiasis was 8.86 mumol reflux/hour before cholecystectomy and 24.55 mumol reflux/hour after cholecystectomy. Five patients did not have detectable BA in the gastric juice in both analyses; the remaining 10 patients showed a significant increase in the BA after surgery. From these data, we conclude that gallstone disease is not always accompanied by an increased DGR. However, in patients in whom DGR is present, its level is higher than in control subjects and increases significantly after cholecystectomy. This is probably due to the greater amount of bile in the duodenum that may reflux through an incompetent pyloric channel.\r"

Associated injuries included three fractures, four severe soft tissue wounds, and one nerve injury. All patients underwent angiography, four preoperative and three intraoperative. Treatment included two primary repairs, four vein graft bypasses, and one fasciotomy and intraoperative angiography. Anastomoses were spatulated and sutured in an interrupted fashion. There were no deaths, amputations, or reoperations. At 10 to 42 months after repair, all patients have normal Doppler pressures and/or distal pulses. This study is the largest reported series of these challenging injuries. Contrasting with previous reports, it suggests that with prompt, aggressive treatment, a successful outcome may be anticipated.\r"

Only 20% presented classically with anorexia, fever, right lower quadrant pain, and an elevated white blood cell count. One third of the patients had greater than 48 hours delay to admission. Objective diagnostic testing was often confusing and unreliable. At the time of admission, only 51% were diagnosed as having possible appendicitis. Eighty-three percent of our patients underwent surgery within 24 hours, and 72% had frank perforation. Thirty-two percent of those surviving developed complications, and 83% of these patients had perforated appendicitis. Complications were twice as likely in patients with perforation. Despite the relatively high morbidity, there were only four deaths in patients with coexistent carcinoma. Because of the later and atypical presentation of appendicitis in this age group, a high index of suspicion and early operation are important in avoiding perforation and subsequent morbidity.\r"

Although various mechanical devices have been occasionally employed by various teams for the purpose of solving these problems, no single instrument has been reported as truly helpful. During the past year, the Iron Intern, a table-mounted surgical robot that replaces up to two of the human assistants during the liver transplantation recipient operation, has been successfully employed at the University of Pittsburgh. The instrument is easy to use and versatile enough to be satisfactory under any circumstances. We believe this device is a real breakthrough in streamlining orthotopic liver transplantation.\r"

Reliability refers to precision of the examination and construct validity to the degree to which the examination can discriminate between different levels of training. Twenty-seven second postgraduate year surgical residents took a 38-station OSCE representing seven surgical specialties and that tested history-taking, physical examination, problem-solving, technical skills, and attitudes. A couplet methodology was used wherein a patient encounter was followed by written questions aimed at testing problem-solving and patient management capabilities. Thirty-six standardized patients were trained and 36 surgeons served as examiners marking from structured checklists. Overall reliability, Cronbach's alpha, was 0.89. Construct validity was examined by comparing the scores of the residents with those of a group of graduates of foreign medical schools applying for a \"pre-internship\" program. For 17 of 19 stations that both groups took, the residents performed significantly better (p less than 0.01). Individual station validity was significant for 32 of 38 stations (r = 0.36 to 0.82, p less than 0.05). The examinations took 3.83 hours at a cost of $5,293 (Canadian dollars). The OSCE has been shown to be a reliable method of assessing clinical skills of surgical residents, construct validity has been established, and inter-item validity confirmed. Reliabilities achieved exceed those traditionally required for both acceptance and promotion decisions.\r"

Two of the four neuropsychological tests showed impairment in scores in the elderly patients on the first postoperative day (Symbol Digit Modalities Test, P less than 0.004; The Trail Making Test, P less than 0.03). In addition, one of the tests (Symbol Digit Modalities Test) showed a deterioration in the younger patients (P less than 0.05). The changes that did occur in these tests on the first postoperative day reverted to baseline levels thereafter. There were no significant changes in the remaining two tests, the Mini Mental State Test or the Digit Span Test, at any time in either group.

For this purpose, a pain model developed for the quantification of drug-induced analgesia in awake volunteers was used in 10 patients scheduled for elective abdominal hysterectomy. Before induction of anesthesia, stimuli were adjusted to two and three times the pain threshold for each individual. Late auditory evoked potentials (AEPs, 30 dB hearing level) and spontaneous electroencephalogram were also evaluated. After control recordings, anesthetic treatments were varied in the following sequences: (a) 0.8% (end-tidal) halothane with 70% nitrous oxide (HN); (b) 0.8% halothane in oxygen (H1); (c) same anesthetic condition as in H1, but the SEP and AEP stimulus intensities were increased to 15 times pain threshold and to 70 dB hearing level, respectively (H2); and (d) fentanyl (0.25 mg) was given with 0.8% halothane in oxygen with no further change in stimulus intensities (HF). In treatments HN and H1, blood pressure and heart rate increases to pain stimuli were abolished, and SEPs and AEPs were both suppressed. Increasing the somatosensory stimulus intensity (treatment H2) stimulated heart rate and arterial pressure responses and again elicited the SEPs. However, AEP components remained suppressed with increased auditory stimulus intensity. Addition of fentanyl (HF) suppressed SEP amplitudes and stimulus-induced hemodynamic responses. Our results suggest that late SEPs in response to painful stimuli change with different analgesic levels.\r"

  ".W": "The anesthetic effects of morphine-diazepam and fentanyl-diazepam combinations as characterized by abolition of the movement response to noxious stimulation were studied in rats to test the hypothesis of antagonistic interactions between the components of these combinations. Noxious pressure on the tail was used to induce the response. Dose-effect curves were constructed for the drugs given alone and in combination. With the use of probit procedure ED50 values for single drugs and their combinations were determined, and the interactions were analyzed with algebraic (fractional) and isobolographic methods. It was found that both morphine and fentanyl have a less than additive (antagonistic) interaction with diazepam. In combination the sum of fractional doses was higher than a single-drug fractional dose, 1.67 versus 1.00 (P less than 0.05) for morphine-diazepam and 1.61 versus 1.00 (P less than 0.05) for fentanyl-diazepam. The observed antagonism is a relative one that does not increase the requirement for one agent upon the addition of another agent.\r"

Diazepam and midazolam induced a dose-dependent attenuation of the effect of all three opiates in both tests of nociception. Flunitrazepam antagonized the antinociceptive effect only in the tail-flick test. The benzodiazepine effect could not be explained by altered tail-skin temperature. The antagonism did not correlate well with the sedative or muscle-relaxing properties of the benzodiazepines, and a different mechanism may therefore be involved. It is proposed that the antagonism represents an interaction between benzodiazepines and opioid systems in the brain participating in modulation of nociceptive inputs.\r"

  ".W": "Desflurane, formerly known as I-653 (CF2H-O-CFH-CF3), is a new inhalation anesthetic derived by fluorine substitution for the alpha-ethyl chlorine of isoflurane (CF2H-O-CClH-CF3). The lower solubility and increased stability of desflurane provided by the C-F bond lessen biotransformation to potentially hepatotoxic metabolites. Repeated administration of desflurane to rats, with or without induced hepatic enzymes, does not result in evidence of hepatic injury. In the recent study we extended the tests for liver cell injury to another species, the pig. Our test included prolonged exposure to desflurane or isoflurane, both in the absence and presence of commonly used adjuvants. We measured plasma alanine aminotransferase activity in eight young female swine anesthetized in random order with desflurane (0.8-1.6 MAC) and isoflurane (0.7-1.4 MAC), for a total dose of about 5.5 MAC-hours of each anesthetic, 3-8 days apart. Plasma alanine aminotransferase activities remained in the normal range, and were not significantly greater over baseline values in samples drawn immediately after, 4 h after, or 3-8 days after (mean +/- SD, 6.1 +/- 2.1) the administration of either anesthetic was discontinued after the first study with either desflurane or isoflurane. Five additional pigs were given a mean total dose of 9.7 MAC-hours of desflurane or isoflurane in conjunction with succinylcholine, N2O, fentanyl, naloxone, atracurium, thiopental, edrophonium, and atropine. No changes in plasma alanine aminotransferase activity were detected in blood samples drawn at termination of the anesthesia, 24 h later, and 4-7 days later (mean +/- SD, 5.8 +/- 1.3).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Eighteen laparotomized, ventilated pigs, anesthetized and paralyzed with ketamine/flunitrazepam and pancuronium, were studied. Enflurane caused significantly (P less than 0.05) greater decreases in mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, and superior mesenteric arterial, portal, and total hepatic blood flows. In addition, hepatic arterial blood flow decreased during enflurane administration but increased markedly (40%) during isoflurane administration. However, mean surface PO2 of liver and small intestine decreased to similar degrees (20%) during isoflurane and enflurane. Summary histograms of surface PO2 values were leftward shifted but did not show O2 values in the hypoxic range (0-5 mm Hg). Except for a decrease in hepatic lactate uptake during enflurane, there were no changes in either hepatic uptake or release of organic acids during anesthesia with either agent. These data show that splanchnic O2 supply is better maintained during isoflurane than during enflurane. Although this was not reflected in differences in tissue oxygenation and metabolism, decreased portal and hepatic venous O2 contents during enflurane indicate that an increase in preportal and hepatic oxygen extraction was necessary to preserve tissue oxygenation.\r"

  ".W": "Alfentanil causes cardiac stimulation or depression in intact animals and in clinical practice; there is no information concerning its direct effects on the heart. Therefore, we studied the effects of alfentanil on isolated cardiac tissues from young adult rabbits. The right atrium with sinoatrial node (SA node) was beating spontaneously, and the left atrium and papillary muscle were stimulated. Isometric contraction was monitored. Alfentanil, in concentrations of 0.05-0.5 mM, decreased by 6%-55% the frequency of contractions of the right atrial-SA node in a dose-related manner. In left atria and right atrial-SA node, but not in papillary muscle, alfentanil in concentrations greater than or equal to 0.01 mM increased the peak developed force and its maximum rate of increase. The time-to-peak developed force was prolonged in papillary muscle but not in right atrial-SA node and left atria. The maximum rate of fall of peak developed force was increased in left atria and decreased in papillary muscle by the administration of alfentanil. The time-to-50% relaxation of peak developed force was not consistently affected by alfentanil in all three muscle preparations. The same concentrations of alfentanil (greater than or equal to 0.01 mM) increased resting force in papillary muscle but not in left atria or right atrial-SA node. It is concluded that alfentanil has direct positive inotropic and negative chronotropic effects on the heart and that it causes contracture of ventricular myocardium.\r"

Ketamine HCl (20 and 40 mg/L) inhibited rested-state contractions that are dependent on the transsarcolemmal influx of Ca2+ for activation and reduced the upstroke velocity of the slow action potential, which reflects Ca2+ influx through the slow Ca2+ channel. On the other hand, ketamine had a relatively small effect on potentiated-state contractions and no effect on rapid cooling induced contractures, both of which are activated by the release of Ca2+ stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. These results suggest that ketamine inhibition of transsarcolemmal Ca2+ influx plays a major role in the negative inotropic action of the anesthetic.\r"

In none of the 16 animals was MH triggered after administration of these relaxants, whereas all animals developed fatal MH after administration of halothane or halothane plus succinylcholine. Muscle biopsy specimens taken before administration of the relaxant confirmed that all animals had increased sensitivity to halothane, caffeine, or both.

Maintaining constant tidal volume (8 ml.kg-1), FIO2 (0.5), and PEEP (5 cm H2O), the ventilator rate was varied to sequentially produce: 1) normocarbia (PaCO2, 38.3 +/- 2.5 mmHg; mean +/- SD), 2) hypocarbia (PaCO2, 33.2 +/- 2.8 mmHg), 3) hypercarbia (PaCO2, 49.8 +/- 2.9 mmHg) and 4) normocarbia (PaCO2, 38.8 +/- 3.6 mmHg). Pulmonary and right ventricular hemodynamics were assessed using a rapid-response pulmonary artery catheter after 10 min of stabilization at each PaCO2. Pulmonary and right ventricular hemodynamics remained unaffected by slight hypocarbia. In contrast, hypercarbia increased pulmonary vascular resistance by 54% (P less than 0.001) and mean pulmonary artery pressure by 34% (P less than 0.001). This was accompanied by a 24% (P less than 0.001) increase in right ventricular end-diastolic volume, a 38% (P less than 0.001) increase in right ventricular end-systolic volume, and a 20% decrease (P less than 0.001) in right ventricular ejection fraction. Despite an increase in right ventricular afterload, stroke volume was maintained unchanged because of a 45% (P less than 0.001) increase in right ventricular stroke work index. Although the patients maintained pulmonary blood flow during hypercarbia using preload augmentation, compensatory reserve might be exceeded in patients with more compromised right ventricular function.\r"

DBS was compared with train-of-four (TOF) stimulation in 21 children aged 3-10 yr, during halothane anesthesia. On one arm the ulnar nerve was stimulated supramaximally with TOF stimulation every 12 s and the force of the evoked contraction of the adductor pollicis measured with an FTO3 force transducer and recorded on paper. Atracurium (0.4-0.5 mg.kg-1) was administered. During recovery from neuromuscular blockade, TOF stimulation was interrupted periodically and DBS substituted. The same stimulation patterns were applied to the ulnar nerve of the other arm simultaneously, and the clinical anesthesiologist was asked to estimate the degree of fade with both. There was good correlation between the measured TOF ratio (ratio of fourth to first response) and DBS ratio (ratio of second to first response). The TOF and DBS ratios above which fade could no longer be appreciated manually were (mean +/- SEM) 0.44 +/- 0.03 and 0.67 +/- 0.04 (P = 0.0002). Corresponding ranges were 0.3-0.8 for TOF and 0.4-0.9 for DBS, but DBS fade was always apparent if TOF fade could be detected. Therefore, in children, DBS is more sensitive than is TOF stimulation for the clinical assessment of recovery from neuromuscular blockade.\r"

Group 1 (n = 8) served as a control; group 2 (n = 7) received intrathecally (it) the opioid receptor agonist morphine (500 micrograms); group 3 (n = 7), the alpha 2-adrenergic agonist clonidine (200 micrograms it); and group 4 (n = 7), the benzodiazepine receptor agonist midazolam (1 mg it). Plasma samples were collected from the adrenal vein at baseline, after it drug administration, and during sciatic nerve stimulation for the measurement of norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine. In control cats (group 1), sciatic nerve stimulation evoked significant increases in adrenal vein catecholamine plasma levels, blood pressure, and heart rate. Morphine (group 2) did not have any effect on spontaneous hemodynamics and adrenal secretion. During stimulation (group 2), there were no significant increases in adrenal norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations, whereas dopamine concentrations, blood pressure, and heart rate rose significantly. Clonidine (group 3) led to a decrease in heart rate and adrenal vein norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations at baseline. During sciatic nerve stimulation in this group (3), significantly lower concentrations were observed in adrenal vein catecholamines compared with control, whereas the hemodynamic response was not suppressed. Midazolam suppressed baseline and stimulation-evoked adrenal vein catecholamine concentrations, but hemodynamics were not significantly affected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, the arterial baroreflex may be significantly attenuated by both anesthetics and hypotensive agents. In isoflurane-anesthetized dogs, the authors investigated the arterial baroreflex response 1) to bolus injections of sodium nitroprusside (SNP), prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and trimethaphan (TM); and 2) to rapid blood loss (5 ml/kg) before and during induced hypotension with SNP, PGE1, and TM by measuring mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA). Hypotension produced by both SNP and PGE1 was accompanied by an increase in RSNA and HR. The increase in RSNA and HR following the SNP bolus injection was significantly greater than that following injection of PGE1 (P less than 0.05). Trimethaphan was associated with a decrease in RSNA and HR. Rapid blood loss resulted in the same degree of MAP reduction (20 +/- 2 mmHg) before and during induced hypotension. Sensitivities of baroreflex, as evaluated by ratios of maximum changes in RSNA or HR to MAP (delta RSNA/delta MAP, delta HR/delta MAP), in response to rapid blood loss, were significantly suppressed during continuously induced hypotension, as compared with responses before induced hypotension. Despite the same degree of induced hypotension (70 +/- 5 mmHg of MAP), delta RSNA/delta MAP and delta HR/delta MAP in response to rapid blood loss were significantly greater with PGE1 than those with SNP (P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Inhalational anesthetics inhibit hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV). One mechanism suggested for this action is stimulation of release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor. The present study has tested this hypothesis. These studies were performed in 66 ventilated and perfused isolated rat lungs. There were three study protocols. Study 1 examined the effect of HPV of the inhibition of soluble guanylate cyclase by methylene blue (MB). In the presence or absence of MB, the lungs constricted to hypoxia with pulmonary artery pressure increases of 8.6 +/- 0.2 cmH2O and 11.5 +/- 0.4 cmH2O, respectively, and halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane caused a reversible 50% decrease in the pulmonary pressor response, but acetylcholine (ACh) was vasodilatory in the saline group and vasoconstrictor in the MB group. In Study II a dose-response curve was established for the potent stimulator (Sin 1) of the enzyme guanylate cyclase. In the presence of MB the dose-response curve for Sin 1 was shifted to the right with an increase in the ED50 for Sin 1 from 44 microM for the control to 85 microM for the MB group. In Study III, baseline pulmonary artery pressure was increased with U46619, and the hypoxic pressor response was increased (28.9 +/- 2.5 cmH2O), but halothane again caused a 50% decrease (11.0 +/- 1.8 cmH2O) in the response to hypoxia. In summary, when soluble guanylate cyclase activity is inhibited by MB, the inhibition of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction by halothane, isoflurane, or enflurane was unaltered, and release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) is therefore not an essential mechanism underlying this action.\r"

  ".W": "Malignant hyperthermia (MH) can be triggered in swine either by stress or by certain anesthetic agents. In humans, MH commonly occurs in patients previously exposed uneventfully to triggering anesthetics. This variability in expressivity of the MH syndrome is a combination of unknown genetic and environmental factors. A hypothesis was tested that a fall in rectal temperature following general anesthesia can prevent the MH syndrome in susceptible patients. Nine littermate Pietrain pigs with MH were exposed to halothane after their rectal temperatures were stabilized at 35 degrees, 36 degrees, and 37 degrees C during thiopental/nitrous oxide anesthesia. The in vivo MH metabolic, cardiopulmonary, and contracture responses were attenuated at the lower rectal temperatures. The effect of varying temperatures on biopsies of skeletal muscle from these animals showed a marked decrease in contracture response to halothane when the muscle was cooled to 25 degrees C. Studies on the Ca2+ uptake process and on Ca2+ channel-Ca2+ release properties of isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes showed that increasing incubation temperatures from 25 degrees to 38 degrees C increased the Ca2+ uptake rate by the SR Ca2+ pump and also increased the probability of Ca2(+)-induced Ca2+ opening of a Ca2+ channel and the release of stored Ca2+. This study indicates that temperature can have a marked effect on the expressivity of the MH defect at the whole animal, isolated tissue, and fragmented membrane levels of organization. Since many surgical patients' temperatures decrease after induction and anesthesia, this may explain one environmental factor that determines the incidence, rate, and magnitude of the MH syndrome.\r"

New Zealand White rabbits were anesthetized with methohexital, 70% nitrous oxide, and local infiltration of 1% lidocaine. Cerebral concentrations of anesthetic were determined from 19F spectra acquired with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Inspired, end-tidal, and arterial anesthetic concentrations, and end-tidal and arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide were measured. Blood/gas partition coefficients were determined and used to convert arterial anesthetic concentration to partial pressures. In seven spontaneously breathing animals, halothane (1%; n = 5) or isoflurane (0.8%; n = 2) was administered at a constant inspired concentration for 20 min; NMR spectra were acquired between 10 and 20 min. Thereafter, the inspired concentration was increased and the process repeated until apnea occurred. Two additional rabbits were anesthetized with isoflurane and studied similarly but with higher inspired concentrations during mechanical ventilation. In spontaneously breathing animals, ventilatory depression occurred, documented by marked increases in PaCO2, and cerebral concentrations of anesthetic did not increase proportionately at inspired concentrations exceeding 3%. In contrast to an absence of a correlation of inspired and cerebral concentrations during spontaneous ventilation, arterial and cerebral concentrations correlated linearly during both spontaneous and mechanical ventilation (R2 greater than 0.969). These results are consistent with depression of ventilation, rather than binding to specific cerebral sites as an explanation for the nonlinear relationship between cerebral and inspired anesthetic concentrations.\r"

Current choices for acute drug therapy of these dysrhythmias include intravenous verapamil as well as esmolol, but no data yet exist comparing the relative negative dromotropic (atrioventricular [A-V] nodal blocking) and negative inotropic effects of these agents. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of esmolol with those of verapamil on systemic hemodynamics, coronary blood flow, and cardiac contractility at doses that produce a similar ventricular response rate in an animal model of a supraventricular tachydysrhythmia. Rapid electrical stimulation (800 impulses/min) of the left atrium in 14 dogs resulted in a rapid and irregularly irregular ventricular rhythm. Esmolol or verapamil were administered by bolus and then infusion to incrementally slow the average ventricular rate. Regional myocardial contractility was measured using the end-systolic pressure-length relationship (Ees). At drug doses that produced similar decreases in ventricular rate, esmolol produced a greater decrease in contractility (Ees: 284 +/- 46 to 40 +/- 22 mmHg/mm, LV dp/dt: 2,400 +/- 450 to 1,360 +/- 450 mmHg/sec) compared with that following verapamil (Ees: 297 +/- 57 to 116 +/- 25 mmHg/mm, LV dp/dt: 2,040 +/- 580 to 1,950 +/- 520 mmHg/sec). This was accompanied by a modest decrease in cardiac output in the esmolol group (2,800 +/- 940 to 2,290 +/- 730 ml/min) compared with an unchanged cardiac output as ventricular rate slowed in verapamil-treated animals. Stroke volume increased significantly in the verapamil-treated animals (10.9 +/- 4.0 to 18.5 +/- 4.6 ml), but remained unchanged following esmolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Doses of 500, 1,000 and 2,000 micrograms serotonin produced significant suppression of the mean noxiously evoked activity of WDR neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (21, 44, and 69% at 30 min, respectively). The dose-dependent effects were partially reversed by the intravenous administration of the serotonin antagonist methysergide (1 or 2 mg). Intravenous administration of the alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist yohimbine (0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg) produced a significant antagonism of the effects of serotonin. In contrast to the effects of methysergide and yohimbine, intravenous administration of naloxone or the alpha 1-antagonist corynanthine had no effect upon the suppressive effects of serotonin. The combination of low-dose serotonin and low-dose clonidine produced a supraadditive effect (30% at 30 min). These data support the concept that noradrenergic systems, possibly through an alpha 2-adrenergic mechanism, are involved in the modulation of spinal WDR neurons by serotonin.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of halothane on the response of small isolated mesenteric capacitance veins to exogenous norepinephrine and electrically induced endogenous norepinephrine release was studied. The role of extra- and intracellular Ca2+ in norepinephrine-induced contractions was also examined. Two-millimeter-long segments from the second-order branch of the mesenteric vein were stretched to twice their resting diameter, and the generated tension was measured with a force transducer. Dose-dependent effects of norepinephrine on generated tension were examined before and after exposure to 0.75 and 1.5% halothane. (These concentrations produced perfusate halothane concentrations of 0.31 and 0.49 mM respectively.) Norepinephrine produced an increase in the basal vessel tension along with a superimposed rhythmic oscillation in tension. Although the magnitude of the tension increase was not affected by either concentration of halothane, the amplitude of the oscillations was reduced. Ryanodine (a blocker of Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum), like halothane, decreased the amplitude of the oscillations, but did not affect overall tension development. In the Ca2(+)-free medium the contractile response to norepinephrine was greatly attenuated as compared to control, whereas the oscillatory behavior was completely abolished. Norepinephrine release was examined indirectly by measuring the increase in tension during electric field stimulation. Response to endogenously released norepinephrine was significantly decreased by exposure to halothane 1.5% (0.49 mM) and blocked by pretreating the vessel with phentolamine. At concentrations used clinically, halothane did not affect overall developed tension in response to exogenously applied norepinephrine. However, 1.5% (0.49 mM) halothane decreased both sarcoplasmic-reticulum-dependent oscillations in tension and electrically induced release of endogenous norepinephrine.\r"

All dogs received treatments of both iv SCh (1.0 mg.kg-1) and saline placebo in a random sequence. Fasciculations and substantial increases in EMG activity were observed in all dogs following SCh administration. At the onset of fasciculations, there was an increase in MAA to a peak value of 353 +/- 74% of control (mean +/- SE; n = 5 for MAA; n = 6 for all other variables) at the 1-min measurement point. Thereafter, MAA gradually declined toward control values. There were delayed increases in PaCO2 throughout the 45-min study period, achieving values of 106 +/- 1% to 118 +/- 4% of control (an increase in PaCO2 of 2-7 mmHg). Despite the increases in MAA and PaCO2, there were no significant increases in CBF during the study. The control EEG 1-h after complete cerebral ischemia, but immediately before administering the drug treatments, consisted predominantly of a delta rhythm, denoting cerebral dysfunction. In one dog, SCh administration produced transient attenuation of the delta rhythm, a change consistent with cerebral stimulation. In the remaining five dogs, SCh had no effect on the EEG. Treatment with saline placebo did not affect any variable measured. The authors conclude that, in the electrically dysfunctioning brain (e.g., as occurs following resuscitation from complete cerebral ischemia), the cerebral (i.e., CBF and EEG) response to iv SCh is attenuated when compared to the previously reported response in normal brain.\r"

The suspension consisted of 10% BAB and 0.025% polysorbate in 0.9% NaCl. Sensory effects were tested by electrical stimulation. Three epidural injections were given, and the dogs were killed after 21 days. The increase in stimulation threshold was comparable to the effect of lidocaine in a concentration between 0.5% and 1%. Increased sensory threshold lasted for days, whereas no long-lasting motor effects were observed. Pathomorphologic changes were found primarily in the dorsal spinal nerve roots, although slight changes were also found in the ventral spinal roots. White matter degeneration was found only in the lumbar dorsal columns. This result suggested Wallerian degeneration in the dorsal spinal nerves and was at variance with recently published data on epidural BAB. No changes were observed in the ulnar nerves. The authors demonstrated that the pathomorphologic changes were induced by the BAB suspension and not by the suspending additive polysorbate 80. It was postulated that the suspension of BAB, which contains particles of a median size of 15 microns, was mainly confined to the dorsal epidural space where neurolytic changes in axons of the dorsal spinal nerve roots and dorsal columns are induced. This may explain the long-lasting sensory effects seen in intractable cancer pain patients after epidural BAB administration. More research is necessary to define the distribution of BAB in nervous tissue after its epidural administration and to better characterize toxicity, neurolytic effects, and regeneration of nervous tissue after BAB administrations.\r"

Control rats intravenously received 5 ml.kg-1.h-1 of the egg-oil-glycerol emulsion that constitutes the vehicle for propofol. Anesthetized animals received an iv bolus of propofol (20 mg/kg) followed by continuous infusion of the anesthetic at 12.5, 25, or 50 mg.kg-1.h-1 for 1 h prior to injection of 14C-2-deoxy-D-glucose and for the following 45 min. In addition, a fifth group of animals were studied immediately after awakening from a 20 mg/kg bolus of propofol as indicated by the first reappearance of head lift. All rats were spontaneously breathing room air throughout the experimental procedure. The general pattern of the cerebral metabolic response to propofol anesthesia was a dose-related, widespread depression of LCGU. At the three infusion rates of propofol tested, overall mean LCGU was reduced by 33%, 49%, and 55%, respectively, and significant decreases were observed in 60%, 85%, and 90% of the regions assayed. These effects were rapidly reversible, since in the recovery group, LCGU returned to near control values in the majority of the brain areas. Although all of the anatomofunctional systems (sensorimotor, extrapyramidal, limbic, and reticular) were involved, forebrain structures showed a greater sensitivity to the depressant action of propofol than did hindbrain regions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Abnormalities in folate metabolism were assessed in a noninvasive manner by measuring the urinary excretion of formic acid and formiminoglutamic acid (FIGLU), compounds that are elevated in the urine of mammals with a deficiency in folate. After a 6-h exposure to 60% N2O/40% O2, urinary formic acid excretion increased 3- to 25-fold the first day following N2O exposure and returned to background levels by the second day after exposure in all age groups. Urinary FIGLU excretion increased 100- to 300-fold in the first day following N2O exposure, with the highest FIGLU excretion rates found in the elderly rats and the lowest in the young rats. By the second day after N2O exposure, FIGLU excretion rates returned to baseline levels in all age groups. Plasma folate progressively decreased with increasing age, whereas no age-dependent changes were observed in red cell folate, liver folate, or plasma vitamin B12 levels. The elderly rats demonstrated the highest vitamin B12 content in the liver and the lowest vitamin B12 content in the kidney compared to the other age groups. Hepatic methionine synthase activities (measured 16-21 days after N2O exposure) were elevated in the elderly compared to the middle-aged or young rats, but methionine synthase activities in kidney and brain were not different among the three different age groups. It was concluded that in rats, aging per se only slightly influences the disruption of folate metabolism produced by exposure to N2O.\r"

These values then were compared with the corresponding values for nitrogen dilution, i.e., oxidant O2 (N2) and oxidant N2O (N2) indices of flammability. Four different types of endotracheal tubes were studied: polyvinylchloride (PVC), red rubber (RR), silicone (Si), and the Xomed (Xo) Lasershield tube. The oxidant O2 (He) indices are: PVC 0.274 +/- 0.0055, RR 0.194 +/- 0.0089, Si 0.194 +/- 0.0055, and Xo 0.256 +/- 0.0055. The oxidant N2O (He) indices are: PVC 0.526 +/- 0.0055, RR 0.434 +/- 0.0114, Si 0.416 +/- 0.0055, and Xo 0.456 +/- 0.0154. The oxidant O2 (N2) indices are: PVC 0.254 +/- 0.0055, RR 0.182 +/- 0.0045, Si 0.200 +/- 0, and Xo 0.230 +/- 0. The oxidant N2O (N2) indices are: PVC 0.472 +/- 0.0084, RR 0.356 +/- 0.0055, Si 0.392 +/- 0.0045, and Xo 0.444 +/- 0.0114. These differences, although statistically significant, are modest and demonstrate only a small, and probably clinically not significant, preference of He over N2 in decreasing flammability.\r"

However, they have not been specifically compared with total finger blood flow, nor is it known how long it takes fingertip temperature to fully reflect an abrupt change in finger blood flow. Steady-state skin-temperature gradients were compared with total fingertip blood flow in 19 healthy volunteers. There was an excellent correlation between steady-state skin-surface temperature gradients and total fingertip blood flow measured with venous-occlusion volume plethysmography: gradient = 0.2-5.7.log(flow), r = 0.98. The half-time for fingertip cooling after complete arterial obstruction (in 8 volunteers) was 6.6 +/- 1.2 min. The authors conclude that skin-temperature gradients are an accurate measure of thermoregulatory peripheral vasoconstriction.\r"

Because postoperative bleeding may be excessive, however, development of a method of reversal of Org 10172 is desirable. Although the optimal ACT, dose, plasma concentration, and means of reversal (e.g., protamine vs. heparinase) remains to be determined, heparinoids provide an alternate means of anticoagulation for CPB in patients unable to receive standard heparin.\r"

Infection on presentation was diagnosed in 22 cases (0.8%). All of these patients had delayed their initial care beyond 18 hours (range, 18 to 288 hours; mean, 18 hours). Other factors significantly associated with infection on presentation included occurrence of the injury outdoors (16; P less than .001), injury due to broken \"street\" glass (seven; P less than .02), and injury of an extremity (18; P less than .01). The rate of prerepair infection was not influenced by the size of the wound. Infections developed subsequent to initial repair in 34 cases (1.2%). Factors associated with development of subsequent infection included use of prophylactic antibiotics, use of subcutaneous sutures, laceration length of more than 5.0 cm, glass or ice as a causative agent, and upper- or lower-extremity involvement. The majority of injuries were repaired by ED personnel without surgical consultation. Postrepair infection rates were not influenced by the specialty of the physician managing the case. Although our study was not designed to specifically test the issue, prophylactic antibiotics were of no proven benefit in reducing infection rates in any group of patients analyzed.\r"

Patient ages ranged from a few months to 97 years. All patients had acute pain due to sickle cell crises (20%), lower-extremity fractures (31%), or second- or third-degree burns (49%). Hospitalization was required in 15% of cases. In the ED, 60% of patients with painful conditions received no pain medication at all. When medications were given, they were usually narcotics. Children (aged 19 years or younger) were much less likely to receive pain medications than adults (P = .001). Those less than 2 years old received analgesics less often than older children (P less than .01). Senior citizens (aged 65 years or older) received analgesics as often as other adults. On discharge from the ED, 55% of all patients had no pain medications prescribed; and children were less likely than adults to receive analgesics at discharge (P less than .001). Pediatricians and emergency physicians are reluctant to use analgesics for children in pain. The data suggest that these physicians need additional education about management of acute pain.\r"

One hundred eighty-nine independent episodes from 187 children 2 to 17 years old were studied. For the groups as a whole and for the individual groups less than 16 years old, the score failed to satisfactorily discriminate those with appendicitis from those without. Had the MANTRELS score been used to determine observation and laparotomy in our patients, 21 additional patients would have been unnecessarily hospitalized, and 16 would have been subjected to unnecessary laparotomies. One patient would have received appropriate intervention earlier. In the 40 children 16 and 17 years old, the MANTRELS score adequately distinguished the two groups. A seven-variable discriminant function, derived from stepwise discriminant analysis, performed slightly better but showed essentially the same findings as the MANTRELS score. We believe the MANTRELS score failed to predict appendicitis in younger children because it does not contain variables that allow for separation of appendicitis from the numerous other conditions mimicking it in the pediatric population. The clinician remains the best judge of the acute abdomen in the pediatric age group.\r"

Acceptable conditions were achieved with a single injection in 97% of the patients, and adjunctive restraint or local anesthesia was not required in 86%. Full sedation was produced within five minutes in 83%. Mean duration from injection to dischargeable recovery was 82 minutes (range, 30 to 175 minutes). One 18-month-old child vomited shortly after injection and experienced transient laryngospasm with cyanosis; intubation was not required, and there were no adverse sequelae. Airway patency and independent respirations were fully maintained in all other patients; no hemodynamic instability occurred at any time. There were no other clinically significant complications. Emesis well into the recovery phase was noted in 6% of the patients. Nightmares were not observed. Response from parents and physicians was strongly positive. Ketamine can be effectively used by emergency physicians to facilitate procedural sedation, yet equipment and expertise for advanced airway management are mandatory due to the rare occurrence of laryngospasm.\r"

This has the disadvantage that more patients may be enrolled than are necessary to achieve a statistically significant result. Sequential statistical techniques provide a method for the analysis of clinical trials so that a reliable result is obtained with a minimum number of patients. In a sequential trial, the data are analyzed after each patient's outcome is known, and the trial is halted as soon as treatment efficacy or lack thereof is demonstrated. This study was undertaken to confirm the advantages of sequential statistical techniques over conventional fixed-sample-size statistical techniques for the analysis of clinical trials. Using sequential techniques, we conducted computer simulations of two fixed-sample-size clinical studies from the literature - a trial of hepatitis B vaccine in homosexual men (N Engl J Med 1980;303:833-841) and a trial of the pneumatic antishock garment in hypotensive patients with penetrating abdominal trauma (Ann Emerg Med 1987;16:653-658). In the trial simulations, patients were randomly assigned to the control and test groups, their outcomes were determined randomly according to the frequency of outcomes observed in the actual studies, and the simulated sequential studies were continued until conclusions were reached. Thousands of possible realizations of each trial were simulated; thus, the distribution of required patient numbers was determined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Increasing numbers of patients with diagnosed HIV infection are presenting to inner-city emergency departments. Unfortunately, there is little information available on the characteristics and emergency clinical problems of HIV-infected patients to guide physicians in patient care and strategies for resource use. Preliminary data from an on-going investigation revealed that there were 254 emergency visits (1.8% of total) by 164 patients with known HIV infection during the four-month period of March to June 1988. Only 171 visits (62%) were likely related to patients' underlying HIV infection. Nine percent of IV drug users (IVDUs) carried a diagnosis of AIDS before presentation compared with 68% of patients who were homosexual or bisexual. Fifty-five patients (21.7%) presented with their first known complication of HIV. Among the 140 risks from patients previously considered asymptomatic, those with homosexual or bisexual risk were 3.6-fold more likely to present with a first-time complication of HIV than were IVDUs. HIV-infected patients were twice as likely to have inadequate insurance compared with a sample of ED seronegative controls. Of the 130 risks by IVDUs, 85% were without adequate insurance coverage compared with 56% of the 91 patient risks from homosexual or bisexuals (P less than .05). Generally, patient presentations did not imply an obvious diagnosis; vague constitutional complaints were the most common (42%). Preliminary interpretation of the data is that IVDUs use emergency services as a routine source of care. Because IVDUs probably represent those with more recent infection and HIV infection continues to spread unabated in this risk group, we can expect increasing numbers of patients to present to EDs with symptomatic HIV infection in the future.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Most ED personnel did not understand the requirements of the law. While emergency physicians, registered nurses, and licensed practical nurses had seen cases of elder abuse in their careers, differences existed in their satisfaction with the disposition of cases reported to state authorities. Licensed practical nurses and physicians reported greater satisfaction with the response received; registered nurses were much less satisfied. However, all accepted responsibility for reporting elder abuse. ED registered nurses and emergency physicians were divided on the degree to which they could diagnose elder abuse, did not believe there were sufficient services to care for those who had been abused, and were unsure whether there were procedures for reporting cases of elder abuse. All ED personnel need to know that cases they report will result in protection of abuse victims.\r"

Ratios of soft-tissue structures in 31 patients aged 7 months to 61 years with epiglottitis were compared with those of age- and sex-matched controls with croup, pharyngitis, and dysphagia. The ratios of epiglottic width to third cervical vertebral body width (EW/C3W) of more than 0.5, of aryepiglottic width to third cervical vertebral body width (AEW/C3W) of more than 0.35, and of epiglottic width to epiglottic height (EW/EH) of 0.6 or more were all found to be 100% sensitive and specific in differentiating between adult patients with and without epiglottitis. In children, EW/C3W, AEW/C3W, and EW/EH ratios of more than 0.5, of more than 0.35, and of 0.6 or more, respectively, were found to be 100% sensitive in detecting epiglottitis with specificities of 87%, 96%, and 87% respectively. These preliminary results suggest that EW/C3W, EW/EH, and AEW/C3W ratios of more than 0.5, of 0.6 or more, and of more than 0.35, respectively, may be useful in the radiologic diagnosis of epiglottitis in patients of all ages.\r"

During this period, the number of annual extremity angiograms increased from two to 42. Forty-six of the 48 angiograms were done to evaluate injuries sustained from police dog bites. Only two angiograms, both negative, were performed to evaluate injuries sustained from nonpolice dog bites. Ten of 48 angiograms (24%) demonstrated significant arterial vascular injuries. A similar incidence has been reported with more common causes of penetrating and blunt trauma (eg, knives, gun shots, and motor vehicle accidents). The majority of injuries (seven of ten) were in the right upper extremity. An absent or decreased pulse was observed in five patients. Three patients had proximity-only injuries. The most common injury was occlusion (six of ten). Three patients required surgical repair. From this study, the first on extremity arterial injuries secondary to dog bites, we conclude that bites can result in significant injury. A careful physical examination and an awareness of the possibility of significant arterial damage in proximity-only trauma will help to eliminate missed arterial injuries.\r"

Forty-eight lacerations were made on the backs of Hampshire pigs, inoculated by injection with infectious doses of Staphylococcus aureus and randomly anesthetized with either topical TAC or lidocaine infiltration. Wounds were sutured, and quantitative cultures were obtained by excision after 48 hours. The mean log10 bacteria per gram of tissue for wounds anesthetized with TAC was 6.818 (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.07 to 7.54) compared with 6.820 (95% CI, 5.91 to 7.75) for those treated with lidocaine; this difference was not significant (P less than .05 by paired two-tailed t test). The probability of failing to detect an intergroup difference of 0.5 log10 bacteria per gram was less than .0001.

We prospectively examined 100 subjects (200 hands) for small finger FDS function by standard and modified testing. We found that 70 small flexors (35%) showed absent FDS by standard testing, whereas only eight fingers (4%) had absent FDS by modified testing. FDS function to the small finger is frequently unilateral. We conclude that modified testing is the only way to accurately test for small finger FDS function and that the use of this simple clinical examination may prevent unnecessary referral to a hand surgeon.\r"

Three sizes (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mm, maximum dimension) of beer bottle glass fragments were inserted into chicken legs and radiographed. Three staff radiologists reviewed the films independently. With two-view radiography, the 2.0-, 1.0-, and 0.5-mm glass fragments exhibited 99%, 83%, and 61% average detection rates, respectively. An analysis of variance and a Tukey's range test demonstrated that the variation in the average detection rate with respect to size was statistically significant (P less than .01). X2 Analysis failed to demonstrate a statistically significant (P greater than .05) increase in average detection rates with four-view radiography. The results of this study indicate that the size of the glass foreign body is often the limiting factor for radiographic detection and that 0.5- to 2.0-mm fragments represent a \"limited detection\" size range. Furthermore, two-view radiography is appropriate and more cost-effective than four-view radiography for screening purposes.\r"

The PVAD included 52 double lumen Hickman (DLH), 29 Infuse-a-port (IAP), and 19 single lumen Hickman (SLH) catheters using percutaneous puncture in 72 pts and venous cutdown in 28 patients. The Hickman catheter subcutaneous tunnel ranged from 4-20 cm with the cuff placed 0.5 to 10 cm from the exit site. Each patient was contacted at two-week intervals to determine the state of the catheter until removal or death. After a one-year follow-up period, 16 per cent of the PVAD remain in place. There were 37 deaths and 22 PVAD were removed after completion of treatment. Mechanical problems led to removal in 12 patients including venous thrombosis (4), poor placement (3), occlusion (3), and a leaking device (2). There were four catheters that \"fell out\" and nine (8 DLH, 1 SLH) were removed for infection; all 13 catheters were placed in a subcutaneous tunnel less than or equal to 6 cm with the cuff 0.5 cm from the exit site. This study is unique in its accurate determination of fate; 40 per cent of the patients would have been \"lost to follow-up\" had a retrospective chart review been used, as many patients died at home or had their PVAD removed elsewhere. Recommendations to increase catheter life/patient satisfaction include 1) IAP as the PVAD of choice, 2) SLH preferable to DLH and 3) placement of long Hickman catheter tunnels (greater than or equal to 10 cm) with cuff greater than or equal to 2 cm from exit site.\r"

We have performed 465 lower-extremity amputations for vascular insufficiency for seven years, with overall 30-day operative mortalities of 0.5 per cent for below-knee amputations and 2.7 per cent for above-knee amputations. One hundred sixteen of these patients presented with acute pedal sepsis superimposed on significant medical disability, and were managed initially with physiologic amputation and intensive hemodynamic monitoring; the overall mortality for this select group was 5.1 per cent. An algorithm of management of patients presenting with acute pedal sepsis has thereby been derived, and is herein presented.\r"

One hundred sixty patients at the VAMC in Palo Alto, California, participated in the study. The participants were men who had visited the clinic with complaints related to vascular insufficiency. The \"typical\" smoker from our survey a) had smoked for more than 30 years, b) acknowledges the association between smoking and disease, and c) will not stop smoking until serious health problems intervene. The majority of respondents expected the same health care regardless of smoking history and did not endorse paying more for health services. Most patients identified serious heart and lung disease as potential sequelae of cigarette smoking, however only 44 per cent of active smokers attributed their peripheral vascular disease to smoking. Although the survey was conducted on patients with complaints related to vascular insufficiency, few respondents identified an association in smoking with gangrene of the lower extremity or leg amputations. It is unclear whether this represents a failure on the part of health professionals to stress this relationship or denial on the part of the smoker. Physicians should continue to advise against cigarette smoking. A strong relationship between continued smoking and lower extremity ischemia or amputation needs to be emphasized in the clinical setting and through public health information campaigns.\r"

Treatment of such aneurysms depends on the location and includes excision, ligation, and splenectomy. The present report presents the first known case, to our knowledge, of SAA presenting with massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding from erosion into the stomach in a nulliparous woman. Prompt surgical intervention resulted in correct diagnosis and patient survival.\r"

The extent of anatomic and physiologic injury was defined by Abdominal Trauma Index and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) scores, respectively. Ten of the 13 patients (76.9%) survived, a significantly improved survival as compared with that predicted by APACHE (50%). Complications attributable to the open technique (enteric fistula and a subphrenic abscess) occurred in two of the ten survivors. It is concluded that the open method of management of abdominal sepsis is effective and feasible. It should be considered in patients with necrotizing wound infections, multiorgan failure, and ongoing abdominal sepsis uncontrolled by conventional methods. Larger, controlled series employing such systems as the APACHE are needed for a better definition of patient selection for the open method.\r"

This study was undertaken to determine the efficacy of intravenous access site on delivery of a bolus injection to the heart with thoracotomy and aortic crossclamping during shock and resuscitation. Six dogs were anesthetized, intubated, and underwent brachial and femoral venotomy and Swan-Ganz insertion (central). Baseline measurements of central, brachial, and femoral transit times for 10 cc cold saline were obtained via Swan-Ganz thermistor. Each animal then underwent thoracotomy, aortic crossclamping alone, hemorrhage to blood pressure (BP) 50 mm Hg for 30 minutes with aorta unclamped and then aorta crossclamped and resuscitation with lactated Ringer's Solution with aorta unclamped and then crossclamped. Femoral-Brachial Index (FBI) was determined by dividing femoral transit time by brachial transit time at each observation. The data suggest that femoral access significantly prolongs bolus transit time when compared with central or brachial access during aortic crossclamping in the euvolemic, shock, or aggressively resuscitated model. Brachial access is therefore the preferred route for bolus injection delivery in the emergency room thoracotomy with or without aortic crossclamping because it provides expedient bolus delivery equal to central access and superior to femoral access.\r"

Failure to establish immune competence is predictive of mortality, usually from sepsis. In this investigation, the hypothesis that complement fragments, known to be elevated in the acute phases of burn injury, contribute to this suppression is tested. Serum taken from patients with massive (greater than 60%) and major (less than or equal to 60%) burn injury was analyzed for the ability to suppress mitogen-induced lymphocyte blastogenesis before and after exposure of the burn serum to (complement inactivating) temperatures. All patients in this study had immune suppressive serum. Heat inactivation partially restored immune competence in the serum of all patients, though significantly more so in patients with major burns compared with those with massive burns. Complement appears to play a contributory role in the acute stages of burn-induced, cell-mediated immunosuppression, though its role in patients with massive burn injury is overshadowed by the presence of serologic suppressive factors not present (or present in lower concentration) in patients with major burns.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a model for the prediction of bacteremia in hospitalized patients, and to identify subgroups of patients with a very low likelihood of bacteremia in whom a positive blood culture has a low positive predictive value. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study with clinical data on 1516 episodes collected from a random sample of all patients who had blood cultures done at one institution. SETTING: Urban, tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS: Derivation set: 1007 blood culture episodes sampled from all blood cultures done on patients at Brigham and Women's Hospital between October 1988 and February 1989. Validation set: 509 episodes, May 1989 to June 1989. The unit of evaluation was the episode, defined as a 48-hour period beginning after a blood culture was drawn. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: True- and false-positive rates of blood cultures in the derivation set as assessed by independent reviewers were 7% (74 of 1007) and 8% (81 of 1007), respectively. Independent multivariate predictors of true bacteremia were temperature of 38.3 degrees C or higher, presence of a rapidly (less than 1 month) or ultimately (less than 5 years) fatal disease; shaking chills; intravenous drug abuse; acute abdomen on examination; and major comorbidity. In the low-risk group, defined by absence of these predictors, the misclassification rate of the model in the derivation set was 1% (4 of 303), and a positive blood culture had a positive predictive value of only 14% for true bacteremia. The model also identified a high-risk subset in which 16% (41 of 264) of episodes represented true bacteremia. The model was prospectively validated in 509 additional episodes, and the misclassification rate in the low-risk group was 2% (3 of 155). INTERVENTIONS: None. CONCLUSION: These findings provide a means of stratifying hospitalized patients according to their risk for bacteremia. If prospectively validated in other settings, this model may be helpful when deciding whether or not to do blood cultures or start antibiotic therapy and, when evaluating a positive blood culture, to determine whether or not it is a true-positive.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether short-term use of oral cimetidine improves the precision of creatinine clearance (CCr) and reduces the overestimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) that occurs with this test in patients with lupus nephritis (because creatinine is secreted by injured renal tubular cells). DESIGN: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial. PATIENTS: Thirteen patients with lupus nephritis with mild renal insufficiency (mean serum creatinine, 230 mumol/L [2.6 mg/dL]; median, 106 mumol/L [1.2 mg/dL]). INTERVENTIONS: Patients were given placebo or cimetidine tablets, 400 mg four times daily for 2 days, with ambulatory 24-hour urine collection during the second 24 hours (\"outpatient study\"). Simultaneous 4-hour technetium-99-diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (Tc99-DTPA) and CCrs were measured immediately after each 24-hour collection (\"simultaneous study\"). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Use of cimetidine improved the accuracy of CCr, as measured by the CDTPA-to-CCr ratio (1.07 [cimetidine] compared with 1.33 [placebo]; P less than 0.05). Cimetidine use also improved the precision of CCr (P less than 0.05). In addition, when compared with standard clinical estimators of GFR, creatinine clearance with cimetidine rendered the most precise estimates of GFR and explained more of the variation in GFR estimation than did any other method (R2 = 0.78 compared with R2 = 0.52 to 0.63). These effects were shown under both simultaneous and outpatient conditions. No side effects due to cimetidine occurred. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with lupus nephritis, the cimetidine-aided CCr offers a compromise between the precise and accurate but expensive and inconvenient research techniques (inulin, iothalamate, or DTPA clearances) and the grossly inaccurate and imprecise but convenient technique (CCr) for determining GFR.\r"

DESIGN: A before-and-after trial in which patients, blinded to treatment, were given a placebo for 2 weeks, followed by 2 and 10 weeks of protriptyline treatment. SETTING: Referral-based pulmonology clinic in a public institution. PATIENTS: Sixteen outpatients were enrolled in the trial. Complete results for 11 patients and partial results for 3 patients are presented. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were evaluated at baseline, after receiving placebo for 2 weeks, and after 2 and 10 weeks of protriptyline therapy (20 mg/d, taken at bedtime). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At baseline, for the whole group, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was 1.0 +/- 0.08 L (mean +/- SE); the partial pressure of O2 in arterial blood (PaO2) was 59 +/- 1.2 mm Hg; and the partial pressure of CO2 in arterial blood (PaCO2) was 48.9 +/- 1.2 mm Hg. These variables remained stable after placebo. Pulmonary function test results were unchanged with protriptyline therapy. Arterial blood gas levels improved with such therapy: PaO2 levels increased by 5.1 +/- 1.4 mm Hg after 2 weeks and 6.7 +/- 2.4 mm Hg after 10 weeks (P less than 0.01); PaCO2 levels decreased by 4.2 +/- 0.9 mm Hg after 2 weeks and 2.2 +/- 1.1 mm Hg after 10 weeks (P less than 0.01). Total sleep times were similar at these visits. The only change in sleep architecture was a significant decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The lowest value for the saturation of hemoglobin with O2 in arterial blood (SaO2) seen during sleep was 72.0% +/- 2.0% at baseline. After 2 and 10 weeks of protriptyline therapy, SaO2 values increased by 7.1% +/- 1.6% and 5.0% +/- 2.1%, respectively (P less than 0.01). With protriptyline therapy, the cumulative SaO2 curve, derived from data obtained during sleep, shifted down and to the right. CONCLUSIONS: Protriptyline improves diurnal and nocturnal hypoxemia in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These changes are not related to changes in pulmonary mechanics.\r"

DESIGN: Mailed survey. PARTICIPANTS: A random sample of 700 gastroenterologists who were members of the American College of Physicians, of whom 510 (73%) responded. RESULTS: Gastroenterologists did a median of 27 of the 40 gastroenterology procedures and 3 of the 16 general medicine procedures. A larger number of different procedures was done by those who were board certified in gastroenterology, spent more than 60 hours per week in patient care, graduated after 1969, or practiced in a university setting, a hospital with 250 to 500 beds, or a group limited to gastroenterologists. The majority of respondents had done each of the three most commonly done procedures 200 or more times in the previous year. For 10 procedures studied in detail, the majority had done 9 of the 10 in the past year at least as often as the median recommendation for maintaining competence. The number of procedures recommended to achieve and maintain competence differed little by the age, type of practice, and gastroenterology board certification status of the respondent. For most procedures, the range of recommendations was broad, but the median numbers agreed with other published recommendations. Respondents learned 31% of procedures after they had completed training. The earlier their training, the more likely they had learned the procedure in practice. CONCLUSIONS: Gastroenterologists do many different procedures, and this number is influenced by how recently they were trained and the nature of their practice. Respondents learned nearly one third of the procedures they do after they had completed training. It is an important and continuing challenge for the profession to assure that physicians learn and maintain these procedural skills at the highest level of proficiency.\r"

It is estimated that almost 10,000 machines will be installed by 1990, whereas the projected demand for screening mammography will require only approximately 2,600 machines, if the machines are used in a moderately efficient manner. The excess supply of mammography resources raises concern from an economic perspective for several reasons. First, such a condition means that health care resources are being used inefficiently. Second, the low average utilization rate of mammography equipment implied by these results necessitates charging a high price-over $100, on average-to cover costs. This price is above the $50 usually associated with low-cost screening mammography programs, and it may impede a desirable public health trend to increase use of mammography screening. Third, the existence of many mammography facilities operating at low capacity levels is inefficient from a health systems perspective, increasing the cost of quality assurance and medical record keeping. The current condition of excess supply is probably unsustainable over the long term.\r"

Intraocular pressure, corneal sensitivity, pupil size, and tear cocaine concentration were assessed before and after cocaine administration. Pupil size was unchanged; intraocular pressure increased in 75% of patients (not statistically significant). Corneal sensitivity decreased by 11% (P less than .05). Cocaine, however, was not detectable in tears using high-performance liquid chromatography. Since corneal sensitivity decreases after intranasal cocaine administration, it may travel retrograde through the nasolacrimal duct. In addition, three pathways of pharmacologic absorption using fluorescein were explored because of its ease of detection. We measured tear fluorescein concentrations in five patients undergoing intravenous angiograms with fluorescein 25% and in six patients who received aerosolized fluorescein 2% intranasally. Fluorescein concentration was 29 times higher per mg dose in intranasal subjects. This finding suggests that reflux occurs through the nasolacrimal duct.\r"

We studied 40 eyes of 20 rabbits in which different doses ranging from 250 micrograms to 1000 micrograms of aminoglycosides were injected into the vitreous cavity. Tobramycin, and to some extent amikacin, were toxic to the retina even in doses of 500 micrograms as shown by ERG changes. The pathologic retinal lesions shown by electron microscopy were characterized by membranous inclusions in the retinal pigment epithelium, tumefaction of the photoreceptors, and partial disorganization of the inner layers. In doses of 250 micrograms or less, these two antibiotics seem to be nontoxic after a follow-up of three months.\r"

Of the 117 patients, 101 patients (86%) remained orthotropic or within +/- 10 PD of orthotropia three years postoperatively, but 13 patients (11%) developed consecutive exotropia (greater than 10 PD). Five years after surgery, 17 of 68 patients (25%) had consecutive exotropia (greater than 10 PD). Our study demonstrates that despite satisfactory postoperative alignment, there is a steady progression towards exotropic drift over long-term follow-up. Our study also suggests that a preferred alignment shortly after congenital esotropia surgery is within 10 PD of esotropia since all of the patients who had consecutive exotropia (greater than 10 PD) were either orthotropic or exotropic (less than or equal to 10 PD) six months after surgery.\r"

Serum was collected over 24 h, and concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography; pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for each drug. SBA was measured against representative strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All agents tested had excellent SBAs against E. coli and K. pneumoniae, often for a longer duration than would be expected on the basis of conventional dosing regimens. Ceftazidime had the greatest SBA against E. aerogenes and was the only agent with a substantial SBA against P. aeruginosa. Although ceftizoxime had the greatest SBA against S. aureus, none of these cephalosporins had substantial antistaphylococcal SBAs. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that cefoperazone and ceftriaxone had markedly different concentration-time profiles in the elderly volunteers than would have been expected on the basis of existing data from younger volunteers. For older patients, dosing guidelines for these two agents may need to be altered.\r"

  ".W": "Salt depletion is known to potentiate aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity, while salt replacement attenuates it. Recent studies have shown that ticarcillin protects against tobramycin and gentamicin nephrotoxicity. It has been suggested that this protection is due to an interaction between ticarcillin and the aminoglycoside. However, it can also be explained by the salt load associated with ticarcillin administration. This study was conducted to examine this question. Tobramycin was administered to eight groups of rats at 100 mg/kg per day intraperitoneally for 10 days. Group 1 rats were salt depleted, while group 2 rats were on a normal salt diet. Rats in groups 3 through 8 were also salt depleted but received, in addition, the following interventions intraperitoneally: group 3, ticarcillin, 300 mg/kg per day (0.37 to 0.39 meq of Na supplement per day); group 4, ticarcillin, 300 mg per day (1.56 meq of Na supplement per day); group 5, ticarcillin, 300 mg/kg per day, and NaCl supplement (1.17 to 1.19 meq/day), resulting in a total load of 1.56 meq/day; group 6, piperacillin, 400 mg/day (0.76 meq of Na supplement per day and equimolar to the ticarcillin dose [300 mg/day] in group 4 rats); group 7, piperacillin, 400 mg/day, and NaCl supplement (0.8 meq/day) for a total Na load of 1.56 meq/day; and group 8, 1.56 meq of Na per day as NaCl. Rats in groups 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, which received a normal salt diet or its equivalent Na supplement, had no significant change in creatinine clearance (CLCR) over the 10-day period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We have recently demonstrated that substitution of imidazoline moieties for the amidine groups of pentamidine produces a molecule that is effective against rat Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and that is apparently less toxic than pentamidine. For this reason, 10 novel imidazoline substituted compounds were evaluated for their effect against rat P. carinii pneumonia. While several of the new compounds were observed to have advantages over pentamidine in the treatment of disease in the rat model, only one compound stood out as a potential new clinical agent. Treatment for 2 weeks with intravenous (i.v.) doses of 1,3-di(4-imidazolino-2-methoxyphenoxy)propane (DIMP) at 1 mg/kg per day produced an anti-P. carinii pneumonia effect equivalent to i.v. doses of pentamidine at 10 mg/kg per day. Although pentamidine and one of the test drugs, 1,3-di(4-imidazolinophenoxy)propane, showed no activity against P. carinii pneumonia when administered per os, DIMP exhibited potent anti-P. carinii pneumonia activity when given by daily gavage doses of 40 and 25 mg/kg. DIMP retained significant activity when given every other day by a gavage dose of 25 mg/kg. No toxicity was observed with the drug at any of the dose levels or by either of the routes of administration. However, the low solubility of the drug prevented testing at higher i.v. doses. Our conclusion is that DIMP has the potential of providing a safer and more effective alternative to pentamidine for the treatment of P. carinii pneumonia.\r"

Concentrations in serum were assayed by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Area under the curve was calculated by the trapezoidal rule with extrapolation to infinity. Bioavailability was calculated as the ratio between the dose-normalized area under the curve of oral and intravenous administrations. The overall mean (standard deviation) bioavailability observed was 63.4% (14.6%), similar to that observed in those with normal renal function (69.0% [15.7%]). The mean bioavailability in the subgroup of subjects with renal insufficiency was 59.9% (13.3%). The observed range in bioavailability was 33.9 to 91.4%. Linear regression did not reveal a correlation between creatinine clearance and bioavailability. Renal insufficiency does not appear to affect ciprofloxacin bioavailability.\r"

The mean peak level of ceftibuten in serum was 10.9 micrograms/ml at a mean time of 1.8 h after administration, and the mean elimination half-life from plasma was 2.5 h. Penetration into the inflammatory fluid was good, the mean peak level being 9.2 micrograms/ml at a mean time of 3.7 h. The mean percent penetration into the inflammatory fluid was 113.4%. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that the mean peak level of the trans isomer was 5.7% that of the cis isomer.

  ".W": "Azithromycin was shown to achieve high concentrations in human skin fibroblasts. Intracellular penetration occurred rapidly (10 micrograms/mg of cellular protein after 3 h) and then increased progressively over a 3-day period; azithromycin accumulated up to 21 times more than erythromycin (61.1 versus 2.9 micrograms/mg of protein). Uptake was dependent on the extracellular concentration, was inhibited at 4 degrees C, did not occur in nonviable cells, and was reduced by a low pH. Intracellular accumulation was not affected by the metabolic inhibitor 2,4-dinitrophenol or sodium fluoride or by the nucleoside transport inhibitor 2-chloradenosine. Once concentrated in cells, azithromycin remained intracellular and was released slowly in the absence of extracellular drug, compared with erythromycin (17 versus 78% released after 1 h). After 48 h of incubation in drug-free medium, 27% of the initial amount of azithromycin remained cell associated. The release of azithromycin was not affected by various monokines reported to stimulate fibroblasts (interleukin-1 or tumor necrosis factor) or by exposure to bacteria. Incubation of azithromycin-loaded fibroblasts with human polymorphonuclear leukocytes resulted in a higher intracellular accumulation of azithromycin in polymorphonuclear leukocytes than in cells incubated with free nonintracellular azithromycin for the same time (8.3 versus 2.2 micrograms/ml after 2 h), suggesting a more efficient or rapid uptake through cell-to-cell interaction. The widespread distribution of fibroblasts in tissues suggests a potential for these cells, and possibly other lysosome-containing tissue cells, to serve as a reservoir for azithromycin, slowly releasing it for activity against extracellular organisms at sites of infection and passing it to phagocytes for activity against intracellular pathogens and potential transport to sites of infection.\r"

AZT-P-ddI exhibited the lowest toxicity in peripheral blood mononuclear, Vero, or CEM cells. Combination studies between AZT and 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (ddI) at nontoxic concentrations indicated a synergistic interaction at a drug ratio of 1:100. At higher ratios (1:500 and 1:1,000), the interactions were synergistic only at concentrations that produced up to 75% virus inhibition.

The paradoxical effect was detected in the 24-h killing curve patterns for each strain. For the biphasic effect, minimum survivor percentages (maximum killing) occurred over a narrow range of ampicillin concentrations immediately above the MIC, with survivor percentages then rising rapidly to peak at approximately 1-log10-unit increment higher. The 24-h minimum survivor percentages for the 20 strains ranged from approximately 0.01% (rapid killing) to greater than 10% (slow killing). In comparison with the previous results for typeable strains, the present findings suggest that nontypeable stains are, on average, killed much more slowly. Based on the initial 24-h killing curve patterns for the 20 strains, 4 strains were selected as putative representatives of the range of bactericidal responses encountered. These strains were then studied to examine the reproducibility of the 24-h patterns and to determine sequential killing curves. These patterns were found to be reproducible and served to characterize the relative killing responses of the strains. In the sequential studies of three of the four strains, tiny colonies having the gross and microscopic characteristics of L-forms were found to be present on the agar dilution plate count plates prior to the application of penicillinase at 48 and 72 h. Such colonies reverted to vegetative forms within 24 to 48 h after application of penicillinase to the panels. Of particular interest was the observation that the paradoxical effect was manifested both by the L-form colonies and by the reverted vegetative colonies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The concentrations of quinolones needed to inhibit DNA synthesis in Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus were also measured. The kinetics of uptake of [14C]lomefloxacin and unlabeled lomefloxacin into whole cells of E. coli KL-16 and S. aureus NCTC 8532 and the induction of RecA in E. coli GC2241 were assayed. All strains had wild-type susceptibilities to quinolones. The concentration of quinolones needed to inhibit DNA synthesis by 50% correlated with the MIC for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. The concentration of quinolones needed to inhibit DNA synthesis by 50% for late-logarithmic-phase S. aureus also correlated with the MIC, unlike the data from early-logarithmic-phase cultures. E. coli and S. aureus showed a similar pattern of uptake kinetics of [14C]lomefloxacin and unlabeled lomefloxacin, indicating that the difference in the susceptibilities of the two species is probably due to different target site affinities. Essentially, lomefloxacin was less active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin and had activity similar to those of norfloxacin and enoxacin.\r"

Using a total of 774 neonatal mice, the effects of various doses of PTX were examined and compared with the effects of three analogs: HWA-448, HWA-285, and A81-3138. A subcutaneous abscess was induced with 10(8) Staphylococcus aureus, and drug or saline was given daily subcutaneously from 2 days before to 4 days after infection. Noninfected animals (given saline without S. aureus) had 0% mortality (0 of 66), and infected animals without drug (given saline) had a mortality of 70% (161 of 231). PTX and HWA-448 showed the greatest protection among the drugs tested at 15 mg/kg with mortality rates of 27 and 38%, respectively (Kaplan-Meier method, P = 0.0001 and 0.0004, respectively). HWA-285 was most protective at 25 mg/kg (mortality, 45%; P = 0.0046) and A81-3138 was most protective in animals at 15 mg/kg (mortality, 42%; P = 0.0045). PTX, HWA-448, HWA-285, and A81-3138 at doses of 200, 100, 100, and 50 to 75 mg/kg, respectively, were toxic as shown by worsened weight loss and increased mortality in animals when compared with infected animals without drug. PTX and its analogs decrease mortality from experimental infections at lower doses but are toxic at higher doses. Pharmacokinetic characteristics of the drugs were similar except that HWA-285 produced lower concentrations in serum and A81-3138 showed a dose-dependent kinetics (longer half-life at a higher dose).\r"

The yields of infectious HAV after 4 and 15 days were markedly reduced by each drug, especially at the lowest multiplicity of infection. The activities of each drug were irreversible. Atropine was active when it was added as late as 2 h after inoculation with HAV. An anti-HAV effect was also induced by treating cells with atropine prior to inoculation. Protamine was active as late as 6 h postinoculation. The combination of atropine and protamine resulted in an enhanced anti-HAV effect. We concluded that these drugs affect undetermined, but separate, steps in the HAV replication cycle.\r"

The appearance of spontaneous single-step, quinolone-resistant mutants of S. aureus P-20, a methicillin-resistant isolate, was more frequent than was that of S. aureus 209P JC-1, a susceptible laboratory strain. Spontaneous single-step, quinolone-resistant mutants of P-20 were not selected by AT-4140, and those selected by existing fluoroquinolones were susceptible to AT-4140. Spontaneous double-step, quinolone-resistant mutants of P-20 were selected by various fluoroquinolones. All second-step mutants selected by AT-4140 or ofloxacin from P-20-C, a spontaneous single-step mutant of P-20 selected by ciprofloxacin, were resistant to all the quinolones. All second-step mutants selected by nonfloxacin were resistant to all existing fluoroquinolones but were less resistant to AT-4140. There was a close resemblance between the resistance profiles of spontaneous quinolone-resistant mutants and those of clinically isolated quinolone- and methicillin-resistant S. aureus.\r"

The infusion was initiated 12 to 14 h before surgery, and blood and muscle tissue samples were collected intraoperatively at the times of incision and wound closure. Although there was a significant difference between the free concentrations of cefazolin (at incision, 9.3 micrograms/ml; at closure, 9.2 micrograms/ml) and cefuroxime in serum (at incision, 26.9 micrograms/ml; at closure, 31.8 micrograms/ml), there was no difference in the total concentrations in muscle at either surgical incision (cefazolin, 6.1 micrograms/g; cefuroxime, 5.6 micrograms/g) or wound closure (cefazolin, 7.7 micrograms/g; cefuroxime, 7.4 micrograms/g). There was a significant correlation between the pooled free serum and total muscle concentrations for cefazolin (P = 0.001); however, there was no correlation between these variables with the pooled cefuroxime data (P = 0.403). These findings indicate that the free drug concentration in serum alone is not consistently predictive of the total concentration of cephalosporin in muscle.\r"

In a pulmonary coccidioidomycosis model, Bay R 3783, fluconazole, and itraconazole were essentially equally efficacious and more active than ketoconazole in protecting mice against death; but they were inferior to amphotericin B. In a short-term organ load experiment, Bay R 3783 and amphotericin B were equally effective and were more effective than the other drugs in reducing the amount of Coccidioides immitis in the lungs. Against meningocerebral coccidioidomycosis, Bay R 3783, itraconazole, and fluconazole at 25 mg/kg and amphotericin B prevented death only during therapy, with mortalities ensuing shortly thereafter. In mice with systemic histoplasmosis, Bay R 3783 and itraconazole at 25 mg/kg and amphotericin B prevented death in all mice through a 44-day observation period. Clearance of Histoplasma capsulatum from organs was similar in mice treated with Bay R 3783 and itraconazole; this clearance was greater than that in mice treated with ketoconazole and fluconazole but less than that in mice treated with amphotericin B. In mice with systemic blastomycosis, Bay R 3783 at 25 mg/kg yielded 90% survivors at 60 days, which was greater than that achieved with amphotericin B (60%) or itraconazole (30%). Clearance of Blastomyces dermatitidis from the lungs was greatest with Bay R 3783, followed by that with amphotericin B, itraconazole, fluconazole, and ketoconazole, in that order.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To determine the magnitude of cloxacillin loss during surgical procedures involving significant blood loss and high fluid replacement, we compared the pharmacokinetics of cloxacillin in children during craniomaxillofacial surgery with the disposition of the drug in healthy young adult volunteers with intact circulation. Blood loss during craniofacial operations may exceed blood volume, in some cases by as much as three times. Hemodynamic replacement with electrolyte solutions and blood products, which do not contain the drug, further dilute cloxacillin concentrations. In the patients that we studied, mean drug loss was estimated at 71%. Cloxacillin concentrations in serum fell below the lower range of the MIC for Staphylococcus aureus during significant portions of the surgical procedures. Thus, the traditional dosing of cloxacillin during prolonged operations with massive blood loss is inadequate. A more frequent dosing interval or priming of all replacement fluids with the drug may be required to maintain therapeutic levels. Our findings suggest that massive blood loss is likely to have a dramatic effect on the level of any drug with a small distribution volume. If such a drug is essential to the patient's well-being (e.g., antibiotics, antiarrhythmics, and anticonvulsants), it must be replaced promptly.\r"

The activity of WIN 57273 against gram-positive organisms was minimally affected by pH and increased at low pH (5.4) against gram-negative organisms. The bactericidal activity of WIN 57273 was demonstrated by time-kill techniques against selected organisms.

The choice of which of these drugs should be used has been difficult in gynecology. The efficacies of these drugs depend on their antibacterial spectra, potencies, and concentrations in tissues. This study was designed to investigate the pharmacokinetics of various cephem antibiotics in the exudate of the retroperitoneal space that is formed after radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy. These cephem antibiotics were cefoxitin, cefotiam, cefotetan, cefpiramide, cefminox, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, cefoperazone, cefmenoxime, cefbuperazone, ceftazidime, cefpimizole, flomoxef, and cefuzonam. The maximum concentrations after administration of a 1-g dose in the exudate of the pelvic retroperitoneal space were 37.9 micrograms/ml with cefminox, 30.3 micrograms/ml with cefpimizole, 21.6 micrograms/ml with flomoxef, 21.5 micrograms/ml with ceftazidime, and 17.6 micrograms/ml with cefbuperazone, which were relatively high. When selecting antibiotics for prophylactic use against infections in the retroperitoneal space after radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy, on the basis of drug transfer, flomoxef, cefminox, cefbuperazone, ceftazidime, and cefpimizole were considered to be the drugs of first choice at a dose of 1 g.\r"

The population model was derived from data from 12 cardiac outpatients who received single doses of vancomycin. The performance of the method was then tested in 27 acutely ill patients who received multiple doses of vancomycin. Significant renal impairment was observed in 15 patients. Renal function changed in 15 patients. The vancomycin concentrations in the patients with changing renal function were not at steady state during the observation times. Two concentrations in serum (peak and then trough, or trough and then peak) were fitted along with the population model to individualize the parameter values for each patient. All the subsequent concentrations in serum for each patient were then predicted by using the parameter values for each patient. Future concentrations of 118 serum samples were predicted. The mean absolute prediction error was 3.6 +/- 4.5 micrograms/ml, and the mean prediction error was -0.7 +/- 5.3 micrograms/ml. These results confirm that a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model can be sufficiently individualized with the knowledge of just two concentrations of drug in patient serum; it is possible to predict closely subsequent concentrations in serum, and dosing regimens for individual patients can be well adjusted to achieve the chosen therapeutic goals.\r"

Elimination half-life, steady-state volume of distribution, and body clearance averaged 2.5 h, 0.5 liter/kg, and 2.5 ml/min per kg, respectively, for imipenem and 9.1 h, 0.4 liter/kg, and 0.5 ml/min per kg, respectively, for cilastatin. Similar values for these parameter estimates were observed after multidose administration, although substantial accumulation of cilastatin in serum was observed. A total of 21% of the imipenem and 43% of the cilastatin were excreted unchanged in the urine over a 12-h collection period. Corresponding renal clearances averaged 0.4 and 0.2 ml/min per kg for imipenem and cilastatin, respectively. Substantial differences were observed in the route by which imipenem was cleared from the body compared with data from adult volunteers. These data suggest that infants should receive an imipenem dose of 20 mg/kg administered every 12 h for the treatment of bacterial infections outside the central nervous system.\r"

  ".W": "Alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) and nucleoside analogs have been shown to have synergistic antiherpesvirus activity in cultured cells. The mechanisms responsible for this synergistic activity are not known, but we hypothesize that IFN-alpha-induced alterations of nucleoside metabolism in virus-infected cells may play an important role. Infection of cells with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) led to an increase in uptake of thymidine into cells. Treatment of infected cells with recombinant IFN-alpha for 24 h prior to infection resulted in a significant reduction in the uptake of exogenous thymidine but did not reduce the apparent incorporation of exogenous thymidine into DNA. The amount of exogenous thymidine phosphorylated relative to the amount taken up was the same in IFN-alpha-treated and control cultures. IFN-alpha treatment of HSV-1-infected cells also resulted in a reduction in the pool sizes of endogenous deoxyribonucleoside-5'-triphosphates relative to those of untreated HSV-1-infected cultures. Although IFN-alpha affected the metabolism of natural nucleosides in HSV-1-infected cells, it did not significantly reduce the uptake of the antiviral guanosine analog acyclovir into HSV-1-infected cells or the amount of acyclovir-5'-triphosphate accumulated. Therefore, in IFN-alpha-treated cells the concentration of a natural nucleoside, thymidine, was reduced, as were the pools of all deoxyribonucleoside-5'-triphosphates. No decrease in acyclovir or acyclovir-5'-triphosphate concentration was observed, however, when acyclovir-treated cells were exposed to IFN-alpha. These data suggest that IFN-alpha-induced alterations in nucleoside metabolism may be one mechanism whereby IFN-alpha and acyclovir express synergistic antiherpes-virus activity.\r"

  ".W": "Enucleated human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN cytoplasts), which have no nuclei and only a few granules, retain many of the functions of intact neutrophils. To better define the mechanisms and intracellular sites of antimicrobial agent accumulation in human neutrophils, we studied the antibiotic uptake process in PMN cytoplasts. Entry of eight radiolabeled antibiotics into PMN cytoplasts was determined by means of a velocity gradient centrifugation technique. Uptakes of these antibiotics by cytoplasts were compared with our findings in intact PMN. Penicillin entered both intact PMN and cytoplasts poorly. Metronidazole achieved a concentration in cytoplasts (and PMN) equal to or somewhat less than the extracellular concentration. Chloramphenicol, a lipid-soluble drug, and trimethoprim were concentrated three- to fourfold by cytoplasts. An unusual finding was that trimethroprim, unlike other tested antibiotics, was accumulated by cytoplasts more readily at 25 degrees C than at 37 degrees C. After an initial rapid association with cytoplasts, cell-associated imipenem declined progressively with time. Clindamycin and two macrolide antibiotics (roxithromycin, erythromycin) were concentrated 7- to 14-fold by cytoplasts. This indicates that cytoplasmic granules are not essential for accumulation of these drugs. Adenosine inhibited cytoplast uptake of clindamycin, which enters intact phagocytic cells by the membrane nucleoside transport system. Roxithromycin uptake by cytoplasts was inhibited by phagocytosis, which may reduce the number of cell membrane sites available for the transport of macrolides. These studies have added to our understanding of uptake mechanisms for antibiotics which are highly concentrated in phagocytes.\r"

The volunteers received 28 doses of 250, 500, or 1,000 mg of cefprozil or 500 mg of cefaclor every 8 h for 10 days. Serial blood samples and the total volume of urine voided by each individual were collected for pharmacokinetic evaluation on days 1, 5, and 10. Both cephalosporins were well tolerated after multiple oral dosing. The peak levels in plasma (Cmax) of cefprozil ranged from 5.7 to 18.3 micrograms/ml after oral administration of 250- to 1,000-mg doses. The regression analysis of Cmax on cefprozil dose showed a dose-linear response. The mean Cmax of cefaclor ranged from 15.2 to 16.7 micrograms/ml and did not change significantly on multiple dosing. The overall mean terminal half-life of cefprozil was 1.2 h and was invariant with respect to dose or duration of dosing. The area under the plasma-concentration-versus-time curve from 0 h to infinity (AUC0-infinity) of cefprozil increased in a dose-proportional manner with an increase in dose. The overall urinary recovery (61% of dose) and renal clearance values of cefprozil were generally invariant with respect to dose and duration of dosing. While cefprozil was apparently absorbed less rapidly and achieved lower Cmax values than cefaclor, the AUC0-infinity of cefprozil was nearly twofold greater than that of cefaclor. The half-life of cefprozil was also twofold longer than that observed for cefaclor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Doses of 250 and 500 mg of each drug were given to fasting subjects in a crossover fashion. Serially obtained plasma, skin blister fluid, and urine samples were analyzed for cefprozil or cefaclor by validated high-pressure liquid chromatographic methods. After oral administration of 250 and 500 mg of cefprozil, mean concentrations in plasma rose to peak levels (Cmax) of 6.1 and 11.2 micrograms/ml, respectively, and those of cefaclor were 10.6 and 17.3 micrograms/ml, respectively. The elimination half-life of cefprozil (1.3 h) was significantly longer than that of cefaclor (0.6 h), and as a result, the area under the curve for cefprozil was about two times greater than that for cefaclor. Both cephalosporins were primarily excreted unchanged in urine. The mean skin blister Cmax values were 3.0 and 5.8 micrograms/ml for cefprozil and 3.6 and 6.5 micrograms/ml for cefaclor after the 250- and 500-mg oral doses, respectively. The mean Cmax values in skin blister fluid for both cephalosporins were comparable and were significantly lower than the corresponding Cmax values in plasma. However, the levels of cefprozil and cefaclor in skin blister fluid declined more slowly than they did in plasma. The skin blister fluid half-life estimates for cefprozil were significantly longer than they were for cefaclor. Parallel to the observation in plasma, the mean skin blister fluid areas under the curve for cefprozil were significantly higher than they were for cefaclor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A group of 12 healthy male volunteers received a single 250-mg dose of cefprozil or cefaclor under fasting conditions as well as after the intake of food. There was a 1-week washout period between each treatment. Serial blood samples were collected and assayed for cefprozil or cefaclor by specific high-pressure liquid chromatographic methods. The mean +/- standard deviation peak concentration (Cmax) of cefprozil in plasma was 6.13 +/- 1.22 micrograms/ml under the fasting condition and 5.27 +/- 1.06 micrograms/ml after breakfast, and these values were not significantly different from each other. The corresponding median time to reach Cmax was prolonged after food intake, but this difference was not significant. The mean Cmax values of cefaclor decreased significantly from 8.70 +/- 2.72 micrograms/ml under the fasting condition to 4.29 +/- 1.52 micrograms/ml after breakfast, and the corresponding median times to reach Cmax were significantly prolonged. The mean half-lives of cefprozil and cefaclor were nearly identical for the two treatments, suggesting that the elimination kinetics of these cephalosporins remained unaltered when the drugs were administered with food. The area under the plasma-concentration-versus-time curves for fasted and fed conditions were not significantly different for both drugs. The results of this study indicate that the extent of absorption and rate of elimination of both cephalosporins remain unaltered in the presence of food. However, the absorption rate of cefaclor is significantly reduced in the presence of food, while that of cefprozil remains unaltered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "3'-Fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine and 3'-deoxy-2',3'-didehydrothymidine are nucleoside analogs which inhibit human and simian immunodeficiency virus in vitro. The pharmacokinetic properties of these compounds in rhesus monkeys after intravenous, oral, and subcutaneous administration of the drug were compared. Half-lives, total clearances, and steady-state volumes of distribution of the two drugs were determined. The half-lives for the drugs by the different routes were between 0.58 and 1.4 h. Oral bioavailability of 3'-deoxy-2',3'-didehydrothymidine was incomplete, with an average of 42% +/- 15% of the dose reaching the systemic circulation. Absorption of 3'-fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine after oral administration was variable, with bioavailability ranging from 21 to 95%. Bioavailability after subcutaneous administration ranged from 59 to 77% for 3'-deoxy-2',3'-didehydrothymidine and from 52 to 59% for 3'-fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine. The ratio of concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid and serum for the drugs was about 0.15 at 1 h after drug administration and was independent of the route of administration, suggesting that a nucleoside carrier-mediated process is involved in the transport of these compounds to the central nervous system. Because of the similar metabolism of nucleoside analogs in monkeys and humans, the potential glucuronide formation was assessed. Whereas the glucuronide of 3'-fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine was readily detected in urine, the amount of 3'-deoxy-2',3'-didehydrothymidine glucuronidated was small or not detectable in one-half of the urine samples.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Daptomycin at the MIC allowed the cell mass increase of enterococcal strains and Bacillus subtilis to continue for 2 to 3 h at rates comparable to those of the controls. During this time the cell shape of the former changed to a rod configuration and that of the latter changed to long rods. In these bacteria, in which cell mass continued to increase, the MIC of daptomycin inhibited peptidoglycan synthesis by no more than 20% after 20 min of incubation and by roughly 50% after 2 h of incubation. Other macromolecules, such as DNA, RNA, and proteins, were only slightly affected. In contrast, incorporation of [14C]acetate into lipids was reduced by about 50% in the various strains after 20 min of treatment with daptomycin at the MIC. When the effect of the major lipid-containing polymers on synthesis was evaluated in detail, it was found that under conditions in which peptidoglycan and the other macromolecules mentioned above were inhibited only slightly (20%) and total lipid synthesis was inhibited by 50%, synthesis of teichoic and lipoteichoic acid was inhibited by 50 and 93%, respectively. Daptomycin was not found to enter the cytoplasm of either bacterial or mammalian cells. It bound, in the presence of calcium ions only, to whole bacterial cells, cell walls (both those that contained and those that did not contain membranes), and isolated membranes of bacterial and mammalian cells. Washing with EDTA removed daptomycin from all cells mentioned above and cell fractions except the bacterial membrane. It is concluded that lipoteichoic acid is most likely the primary target of daptomycin.\r"

Two patients, both of whom eventually were cured, had modifications of therapy because of bacteremia persisting 7 and 16 days into therapy. One patient required an operation for recurrent fevers, and the resected vegetation showed evidence of active infection. Time-kill studies performed with nafcillin and vancomycin for 10 isolates of S. aureus showed that vancomycin was less rapidly bactericidal than nafcillin. Although vancomycin is used as an alternative to penicillinase-resistant penicillins for treatment of staphylococcal endocarditis, these findings raise the question of whether it is equivalent to these drugs in efficacy.\r"

Triple antimicrobial therapy combining amoxicillin, metronidazole, and bismuth subsalicylate was successful in eradicating the organism from 5 of 7 (71%) adult ferrets. Despite apparent in vitro susceptibility, neither chloramphenicol monotherapy nor a polytherapeutic regimen combining tetracycline, metronidazole, and bismuth subsalicylate proved effective in the eradication of H. mustelae. Several strains isolated after unsuccessful polytherapy showed markedly increased resistance to metronidazole. These preliminary findings are similar to results of H. pylori treatment trials with humans and suggest that the ferret may be a useful model for evaluating and comparing potential antimicrobial modalities for the eradication of H. pylori.\r"

  ".W": "We characterized the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration and pharmacokinetics of SCH-39304 in adult rhesus monkeys receiving a single oral dose of SCH-39304 (2.0 mg/kg of body weight). The mean CSF-to-plasma area under the curve ratio was 0.63 (+/- 0.18, standard error of the mean); maximum concentrations were 1.34 micrograms/ml (+/- 0.18) in CSF and 1.96 micrograms/ml (+/- 0.43) in plasma. The mean plasma half-life was 45.7 h (+/- 11), and mean CSF half-life was 38.7 h (+/- 3.5). The mean levels of SCH-39304 at 24 h were 1.48 micrograms/ml (+/- 0.3) in plasma and 0.96 microgram/ml (+/- 0.12) in CSF. We conclude that SCH-39304 effectively penetrates into CSF and achieves concentrations considered active against many opportunistic yeasts and that these concentrations are sustained in CSF for greater than or equal to 24 h.\r"

Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed on day 3, 30 min after the end of the morning drug administration. The mean penetration ratios (i.e., the ratios of the concentrations in ALF versus those in serum) were 53% (standard error, 12%) and 61% (standard error 31%) for ampicillin and sulbactam, respectively. The concentration ratio of ampicillin versus sulbactam in serum was not significantly different from that in ALF. From a pharmacokinetic point of view, ampicillin-sulbactam is a good choice for treatment of infectious exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, since the concentrations of both drugs in ALF exceed the MICs for the respiratory pathogens responsible.\r"

  ".W": "Mutants of human rhinovirus type 2 (HRV-2) resistant to and dependent on the antirhinoviral compound chalcone Ro 09-0410 were selected in cell culture under clean laboratory conditions. A total of 42 volunteers were challenged with either the drug-resistant mutant [SR2-410(r)] (15 volunteers), the drug-dependent mutant [SR2-410(d)] (15 volunteers), or a wild-type HRV-2 which had a similar passage level in vitro as the mutants but without the drug (12 volunteers). Of volunteers challenged with the wild-type HRV-2, 33, 67, and 82% developed cold symptoms, shed virus, and showed serological evidence of infection, respectively. In contrast, only 13, 27, and 23% of volunteers challenged with the drug-resistant mutant developed colds, shed virus, and showed serological evidence of infection, respectively. None of the volunteers challenged with the drug-dependent virus became infected or had symptoms of colds. These results demonstrate that a drug-resistant rhinovirus was capable of infecting humans and producing disease, although its infectivity was reduced when compared with that of the wild type. In contrast, a drug-dependent virus had lost its ability to infect humans.\r"

Approximately 10(7) viable M. avium complex cells were given intravenously. Seven days later, treatment with either encapsulated or free gentamicin at 20 mg/kg of body weight was started. Treatment was given daily for 5 consecutive days or twice weekly for 3 weeks. The mice were sacrificed 5 days after the last dose. Spleens, livers, and lungs were homogenized, and viable cell counts were determined. An analysis of variance and subsequent Tukey honestly significant difference tests indicated that both encapsulated and free gentamicin reduced viable cell counts in each of the organs compared with no treatment. Encapsulated gentamicin significantly reduced viable cell counts in the spleen and liver compared with the free gentamicin. A dose-response experiment was performed with a daily dose of 0.2, 2, or 20 mg/kg. Dose-related reductions in viable cell counts were observed for spleens and livers, although none of the regimens resulted in sterilization of these organs. Liposome-encapsulated gentamicin should be considered for further evaluation in the treatment of M. avium complex infection in humans.\r"

  ".W": "The multiple-dose pharmacokinetics and safety of amifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent, were evaluated in healthy male volunteers. Amifloxacin was administered orally at 200, 400, or 600 mg every 12 h (q12h) and 400, 600, or 800 mg every 8 h (q8h) for 10 days. An additional dose was administered on day 11. Concentrations of amifloxacin in plasma and urine were measured on days 1, 5, and 11 by high-performance liquid chromatography. Steady-state amifloxacin concentrations were reached by day 5. Mean +/- standard deviation maximum observed amifloxacin concentrations in plasma were 2.52 +/- 1.12, 4.98 +/- 1.44, 5.40 +/- 2.02, 4.59 +/- 2.17, 6.53 +/- 2.44, and 8.01 +/- 3.00 micrograms/ml after the initial dose and 2.30 +/- 0.98, 5.41 +/- 0.74, 8.05 +/- 1.68, 6.87 +/- 2.81, 9.53 +/- 0.50, and 11.9 +/- 1.92 micrograms/ml on day 11 of the study for the 200-, 400-, and 600-mg q12h and 400-, 600-, and 800-mg q8h regimens, respectively. Amifloxacin was rapidly absorbed, as evidenced by the mean time to the maximum observed amifloxacin concentration of 0.98 h. Mean values for the terminal amifloxacin half-life in plasma ranged from 3.58 to 5.78 h. Mean amifloxacin concentrations in urine on day 11 in samples collected 0 to 2 h after dosing were 105, 417, 376, 336, 518, and 464 micrograms/ml for the 200-, 400-, and 600-mg q12h and 400-, 600-, and 800-mg q8h regimens, respectively.
