  ".W": "A major concern in school screening programs as well as in the clinical assessment of spinal curvature has been the frequent radiation exposure required to ascertain curve progression. Various techniques have been developed to identify scoliosis such as the Moire and ISIS techniques, but these are very sophisticated and expensive. The authors have developed a simple procedure of identifying and documenting spinal curvature during the performance of the Adams forward bend test, using an ultrasonic sound probe, four sound receivers, and a micro-computer. The probe is run along the spinous processes emitting an ultrasonic sound, which is picked up by four receivers mounted at the corners of a rectangle above the patient. The signal is fed into a micro-computer and the spinal curvature is plotted out. The magnitude of the curve is calculated by the computer, and the actual curve plus the magnitude is printed in hard copy to be placed in the chart. The reproducibility error and intermeasurer error has been less than 5%. A series of 30 patients with varying magnitudes of scoliosis from 15 degrees to 73 degrees were examined. The results of the ultrasonic digitization were compared with standard scoliosis radiographs of the patient taken the same week. The average curvature measured from the radiographs was 38 degrees, and from the ultrasonic digitization technique, 30 degrees: The forward bend position contributed to smaller curvature measurement, and measurement in the standing position was thought to be a better technique. Ultrasonic digitization as a method of curve measurement is most accurate in curves over 30 degrees.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The authors also reported their clinical experience with NMEPs elicited from humans undergoing surgery for spinal deformities. Results from the animal studies indicate that NMEPs are more sensitive and specific to the effects from spinal cord compression, ischemia, and distraction than SEPs. In every situation, NMEPs always correlated with the animal's post-surgical clinical status, while SEPs demonstrated an unacceptable false positive and false negative rate. In the 111 clinical cases in which NMEPs were administered, reliable NMEPs were easily elicited in more than 90% of the cases. In the remaining cases, no reliable NMEPs could be recorded because of procedural errors, which have been resolved. The results from this study suggest that the use of NMEPs should be considered as an adjunct to SEPs when monitoring spinal cord function during surgery.\r"

The finite element mesh of the L4-5 motion segment model was modified to simulate bilateral decompression surgery. The mesh was further altered to achieve stabilization, using an interbody bone graft and a set of Steffee plates and screws. The model behavior of the intact specimen in all loading modes and of the stabilized model in compression, flexion, and extension modes were studied. The stresses in the cancellous bone region were found to decrease. The interbody bone graft, due to an overall decrease in stresses in the bone below the screw, transmits about 80% of the axial load as compared with 96% transmitted by an intact disc in an intact model. Thus, the use of a fixation device induces a stress shielding effect in the vertebral body. The results indicate that although the bone graft transmits lesser loads than the intact disc, it is active in transmitting loads. The presence of low stresses in the cancellous bone region and high localized stresses in the cortical pedicle region surrounding the screw, compared with the intact case, suggests that the screws are likely to become loose over time. The use of an interbody bone graft alone or in combination with any existing fixation device also induces higher stresses at the adjacent levels. This may be responsible for the adverse iatrogenic effects seen clinically.\r"

  ".W": "Intravenous thrombolytic treatment (streptokinase or anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex (APSAC) was given to 50 consecutive patients within 3 hours after onset of symptoms of acute myocardial infarction. Left heart catheterisation with coronary angiography and simultaneous double view left ventriculography were performed approximately 4 hours after start of thrombolytic treatment. This examination showed that the acute infarct-related coronary artery was open in 36 patients (72%) and closed in 14 patients (28%). A higher left ventricular ejection fraction was found among patients with open, than among patients with closed infarct-related artery (58.8% vs. 48.4%, p = 0.05). The group with open artery also had a lower score of regional left ventricular dysfunction (1.7 vs. 2.4, p less than 0.05, on a scale from 0-3). Single, double and triple vessel coronary heart disease was found in 22, 14 and 13 patients respectively. Mean age was lower in the group with single vessel disease as compared to double and triple vessel disease (48.4 years vs. 53.4 and 55.4 years, p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.005). Independently of whether the infarct-related artery was open or closed, there tended to be an inverse correlation between number of diseased vessels and preservation of left ventricular function (statistical significance only for single vessel versus triple vessel disease with respect to score of regional left ventricular dysfunction, 1.8 vs. 2.4, p less than 0.05). These findings suggest that early thrombolytic treatment within 3 hours of onset of symptoms may preserve myocardial tissue during the evolution of acute infarction. Furthermore, a presumably better collateralisation from adjacent coronary arteries without stenoses may be important for myocardial preservation. Finally, early angiographic examination can be performed safely and is a good support for determination of further treatment, which in the actual patients was coronary bypass surgery in 8 cases, transluminal angioplasty, PTCA, in 20 cases, and medical treatment alone in 22 cases.\r"

There was no effect of gonadotropin releasing hormone. The ratio of human chorionic gonadotropin secretion from midtrimester explants to that from term explants varied under different conditions, dropping from twentyfold in day 1 cultures to elevenfold for maximum secretion produced after culture in control medium for up to 6 days. A further drop in the ratio to fourfold was observed for the maximal response to 2 mmol/L dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate treatment.

In this experiment we attempted to distinguish the placental and nonplacental (uterine) components of this response over four concentrations of PGI2. Eleven near-term sheep were chronically instrumented for determination of regional blood flows by the use of radioactive microspheres. PGI2 was administered in a retrograde manner via a branch of the middle uterine artery at 1, 3, 10, and 20 micrograms/min. Flows were measured before (control) and after 5-minute infusions at each of the four concentrations (test). The uterine vasculature vasodilated in response to local PGI2 infusion. The 10 micrograms/min dose, for example, produced a mean (+/- SEM) flow of 0.70 +/- 0.07 ml/min/gm; the control value was 0.41 +/- 0.03 ml/min/gm (p less than 0.001). At 20 micrograms/min the test and control flows were 0.75 +/- 0.16 and 0.36 +/- 0.06 ml/min/gm (p less than 0.05), respectively. Uterine vascular resistance fell in a dose-dependent manner as well. There was no evidence of placental vasodilation at any of the doses tested. Renal vasodilation and decreased systemic arterial pressure at higher PGI2 doses suggest a recirculation effect. We conclude that PGI2 does not dilate the placental vasculature over the dose range of 1 to 20 micrograms/min and that the reported vasodilation of the uteroplacental vasculature is a result of decreased resistance in the uterine vasculature alone.\r"

Low-dose aspirin can selectively inhibit thromboxane production in the adult circulation, but its effects on placental vascular production of thromboxane and prostacyclin are incompletely understood. We therefore studied the effects of low-dose aspirin on the production rates of prostacyclin and thromboxane, with and without vasoconstricting doses of angiotensin II, in human placental arteries. Chorionic plate arteries were incubated and samples were assayed for thromboxane and prostacyclin by radioimmunoassay of their stable metabolites. Production rates for prostacyclin were similar in the control, aspirin, angiotensin II, and angiotensin II plus aspirin groups. Mean (+/- SEM; n = 8) thromboxane production rates in the aspirin (1.4 +/- 0.5 pg/mg/hr) and angiotensin II plus aspirin (2.9 +/- 0.6 pg/mg/hr) groups were significantly lower (p less than 0.05) than values in the control (8.6 +/- 2.7 pg/mg/hr) and angiotensin II (6.7 +/- 1.3 pg/mg/hr) groups.

Conversely, 94% of women who did not demonstrate high microalbuminuria and a low calcium/creatinine ratio remained normotensive at the time of delivery.

In the group of 13 women with premature rupture of membranes and complications, the incidence of fetal breathing movements was 38%.

Anecdotally, these patients have been perceived as more highly anxious than other second-trimester patients referred for genetic testing because of advanced maternal age. Thus we have studied patient demographics, true genetic risks, the perceptions of risk, and state (situational) and trait (constitutional) anxiety for these patients and their partners. Significantly increased state anxiety was noted for mothers as compared with fathers both in the group of women referred for testing because of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels and in those referred due to advanced maternal age. State anxiety was increased in the women referred for maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels as compared with women referred for advanced maternal age. True genetic risks were comparable between the groups. Some critics have argued that maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening engenders unnecessary anxiety. Our data show that patients undergoing genetic testing due to maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels have higher state anxiety than women undergoing testing because of advanced maternal age, but that indication is much less a factor than are partner differences. Therefore, increased anxiety after abnormal maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein testing results cannot be reasonably used as an argument against such testing.\r"

The ratio of systolic peak to end-diastolic frequency was obtained with a continuous-wave Doppler device and the placental location was determined by real-time ultrasonography. In both normal and hypertensive pregnancies with unilateral placental location the systolic/diastolic ratio of the ipsilateral uterine artery was significantly lower than the contralateral artery ratio [1.73 +/- 0.35 (systolic/diastolic ratio) versus 2.46 +/- 0.73, p less than 0.001, and 2.38 +/- 1.01 versus 4.04 +/- 1.77, p = 0.0012, respectively].

Three categories of markers had been previously identified, but due to cost considerations it was necessary to accurately determine if analysis for all three were necessary. With the use of vaginal secretions from well-defined patient populations, we applied gas-liquid chromatography to test for both volatile and nonvolatile acid fermentation products. It was found that only the detection of nonvolatile acids was necessary, because no additional patients with bacterial vaginosis were identified by subsequent analysis of volatile acids. Routine analysis of volatile acids to identify patients with bacterial vaginosis is labor intensive and costly and had no clinical diagnostic value.\r"

The major peptide product of c-ras is a 21 kilodalton peptide (p21), but other larger \"ras-related\" peptides have been described in urine obtained from patients with several types of cancers. In the present investigation immunohistochemical methods were used to assess c-ras expression in tissues obtained from patients with endometrial adenocarcinoma. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were processed in routine fashion, then incubated with a monoclonal antibody raised against a v-H-ras synthetic peptide. ras Peptides were not detected in proliferative or secretory endometrium or in benign adenomatous hyperplasia. One of four specimens of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia and two of 11 specimens of grade 1 (international Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) adenocarcinoma stained positive for ras peptides. A total of 95% of the grade 2 and 3 adenocarcinoma studied contained detectable ras peptides within neoplastic cells. In contrast to previous immunohistochemical studies that identified ras peptides only in neoplastic cells of bladder, prostate, colon, and breast cancers, we routinely found ras peptides within stromal cells of high-grade endometrial carcinomas. When stained with hematoxylin and eosin, these cells have the appearance of foamy macrophages.\r"

  ".U": "89086529\r", 
  ".W": "Specific types of human papillomavirus are currently implicated as etiologic agents of precancerous and cancerous lesions of the cervix. We have previously described the use of cervicovaginal lavage and molecular hybridization to detect human papillomavirus infections of the cervix. We report here the predictive value of this method of human papillomavirus detection to identify women with biopsy proved dysplastic and cancerous lesions of the cervix. One hundred ninety-one women from a city hospital colposcopy clinic underwent concurrent Papanicolaou smear, cervicovaginal lavage, and coloposcopically directed cervical biopsy. Human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid was detected in 114 (59.7%) of these women. Of the positive results, human papillomavirus type 16 accounted for 23.7%, human papillomavirus type 18 for 10.5%, human papillomavirus type six or 11 for 6.2%, related human papillomavirus types for 52.6%, and 7.0% contained more than one type. The distribution of human papillomavirus types was similar in both women younger than 40 years of age and in older women. Eighty-nine of 128 (69.5%) women less than 40 years old with cervical lesions had positive findings of human papillomavirus, and 18 of 29 (62.1%) older women with cervical lesions had positive findings of human papillomavirus. Detection of human papillomavirus types 16 and 18 identified only 35 of 157 (22.3%) women with cervical lesions. The sensitivity of detecting all types of human papillomavirus as a predictor of a biopsy proved lesion (68.0%) was comparable with the sensitivity of cytologic examination alone (74.0%). However, human papillomavirus detection combined with the Papanicolaou smear provided an increased overall sensitivity of 89.3% (p less than 0.01). In fact, women either positive for human papillomavirus or having abnormal cytologic findings were 11.8 times more likely to have a biopsy proved cervical lesion than human papillomavirus-negative women with negative cytologic results (95% confidence interval for odds ratio: 5.3 to 26.6). We conclude that the sensitivity of cytologic examination plus human papillomavirus detection is superior to the use of either cytologic studies or human papillomavirus detection alone in identifying patients with cervical lesions.\r"

Thirty-four patients with intrauterine gestations were compared with 60 patients with ectopic pregnancies. Urinary pregnanediol-3 alpha-glucuronide was measured by radioimmunoassay and enzyme immunoassay. Compared with intrauterine gestations, results demonstrate that urinary pregnanediol-3 alpha-glucuronide is significantly depressed in ectopic pregnancies: 24.5 +/- 2.2 versus 4.8 +/- 0.7 micrograms/ml (p = 0.0001). Urinary pregnanediol-3 alpha-glucuronide levels obtained by conventional radioimmunoassay correlated closely with values measured in minutes with enzyme immunoassay (r = 0.95, p = 0.0001), and with serum progesterone (r = 0.74, p = 0.0001). Urinary pregnanediol-3 alpha-glucuronide measured by enzyme immunoassay exhibited predictive values for detecting ectopic gestations comparable with random serum progesterone or serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin values. We conclude that ectopic gestations demonstrate a reduced level of urinary pregnanediol-3 alpha-glucuronide (55/60 cases) detectable with a rapid enzyme immunoassay, which makes this assay a practical screening test in early pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "Smoking markedly intensifies the risk of cardiovascular disease in women who use oral contraceptives. The mechanism of this effect is not known, but evidence in vitro and in male smokers suggests that nicotine and cigarette smoke can alter prostaglandin formation and platelet function. However, these effects had not been studied with regard to women. We evaluated the effects of smoking on prostacyclin formation and platelet aggregation in 38 women who were matched according to age and weight. These included 24 women who used oral contraceptives (15 smokers, 9 nonsmokers) and 7 smokers who did not use oral contraceptives. In addition, a control group comprised seven healthy, nonsmoking women who did not take oral contraceptives. Prostacyclin formation, reflected by the excretion rate of its stable metabolite 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, was measured by means of radioimmunoassay in 4-hour urine specimens obtained during a smoking-free period and after participants had inhaled smoke from four high-nicotine cigarettes. In addition, ex vivo platelet aggregation in response to adenosine diphosphate and the stable thromboxane/endoperoxide analog U 46619 was evaluated before and after the inhalation of cigarette smoke. Oral contraceptive users who smoked greater than or equal to 5 years had a lower basal 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha level than nonsmokers or those with a smoking history of less than 5 years (84 +/- 11 versus 159 +/- 28 versus 171 +/- 18 ng/gm of creatinine, p less than 0.01). Inhalation of smoke from four high-nicotine cigarettes did not alter 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha in the smokers who did not use oral contraceptives. However, excretion of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha was further reduced in the smokers who used oral contraceptives (133 +/- 20 to 86 +/- 9 ng/gm of creatinine, p less than 0.05). Platelet aggregation did not change after inhalation of cigarette smoke in the women who did not take oral contraceptives, but aggregation increased in participants who used oral contraceptives. These results suggest that prostacyclin inhibition may be an important mechanism for the increased cardiovascular risk in women smokers who take oral contraceptives.\r"

In the first experiment the centromeric Y-specific 5.5 kb Eco RI fragment was clearly seen in the mixture of 0.050 microgram of male DNA with 4.950 micrograms of female DNA (1%). In the second experiment the same dilutional study was applied to the Yq11-related probe 4B-2 for comparison purpose. In the third experiment, hybridization with the Y97 probe was performed on 20 subjects with mosaic cell lines containing a cytogenetically identifiable Y (n = 10) and a cytogenetically unidentifiable minute (n = 10) fragment. Nineteen of the 20 subjects demonstrated the Y-specific 5.5 kb Eco RI hybridization band with the centromeric Y97 probe. These experiments demonstrated the utility of the Y97 probe to consistently identify cytogenetically altered Y chromosome fragments and confirm the mapping of the alphoid repeat sequences to the centromeric region of the Y chromosome.\r"

The purpose of this study was to analyze prorenin, active renin, and ovarian steroids in ovarian venous blood and peripheral venous blood samples obtained simultaneously. We studied 10 premenopausal patients undergoing oophorectomy in various phases of the menstrual cycle. Prorenin levels in the ovarian venous effluent were more than twofold higher than levels in peripheral blood, 136.8 +/- 34.1 versus 35.6 +/- 8.3 ng angiotensin 1 per milliliter per hour (p less than 0.01). Active renin levels were also higher in ovarian venous blood than in peripheral venous blood, 12.9 +/- 2.5 versus 8.9 +/- 2.7 ng angiotensin 1 per milliliter per hour, but this difference did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.07). Prorenin levels correlated with those of active renin in ovarian venous blood (r = 0.76, p less than 0.05), suggesting that prorenin is locally activated. In the peripheral circulation, estradiol levels correlated negatively with prorenin levels (r = -0.73, p less than 0.05), although prorenin levels did not correlate with steroid levels in ovarian venous blood. We conclude that prorenin is produced by the ovary throughout the menstrual cycle and may be locally activated.\r"

Multi-species infection was common, particularly in children less than 10 years of age. Circumsporozoite (CS) antibodies to P. vivax were detected by ELISA, using the recombinant protein NS181V20, in sera from 53-95% of all subjects in this study. The specificity of reactivity to NS181V20 was confirmed by immunofluorescence using air-dried sporozoites. CS antibodies to P. falciparum were present in less than 50% of the population less than 30 years of age. These data support further testing of this protein as a candidate vivax vaccine.\r"

Electron microscopy of 1 isolate (85-488NM, chosen as the prototype) indicated that this strain shares morphologic characteristics with viruses of the family Rhabdoviridae. Indirect fluorescent antibody tests indicated that this virus is a member of the genus Vesiculovirus, but is not closely related to any of the North American or other rhabdoviruses with which it was tested, including vesicular stomatitis (Indiana) and vesicular stomatitis (New Jersey) viruses. The name Malpais Spring virus is proposed for this newly recognized vesiculovirus. A serologic survey indicated that Malpais Spring virus infects indigenous (mule deer and pronghorn) and exotic (gemsbok) ungulates at and near the sites where the mosquitoes from which the virus strains were isolated were collected. Antibody prevalence in wild animals indicates that the pronghorn and gemsbok may play roles as hosts for Malpais Spring, epizootic hemorrhagic disease (New Jersey), and bluetongue viruses in this area.\r"

Because of their positive family histories all the babies are at high risk of becoming allergic. The babies were randomly divided such that cows' milk was deliberately withheld from one group; infants in this group were fed with a soya substitute where required. No benefit resulted from withholding cows' milk, indeed symptoms were more usually associated with this group. Breast feeding, even for a short period, was clearly associated with a lower incidence of wheeze, prolonged colds, diarrhoea, and vomiting. It seemed that the duration of breast feeding was less important than whether or not the child had been breast-fed at all. Wheezing was both more common among boys than girls (P less than .05) and if the mother was a smoker. Other environmental features related to wheezing were social class, month of birth, lack of breast feeding, exposure to dampness, mould and coal fires, but not to domestic pets nor to the numbers of mites found in bedding and carpets. Mite exposure was, however, associated with prolonged colds. Eczema was the only allergic symptom not positively associated with any environmental factor; moreover, it was neither associated with a lack of breast feeding nor with inclusion of cows' milk in the diet. Eczema was associated with the incidence of positive skin prick tests and IgE antibodies to egg white. IgE and IgG4 antibodies were estimated at birth (mothers' and cord bloods) and 3 and 12 months later.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Aspartame is a food additive marketed under the brand name Nutrasweet. Aspartame is a white, odorless, crystalline powder and consists of two amino acids, L-aspartic acid and L-phenylalanine. It is 180 times as sweet as sugar. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) first allowed its use in dry foods in July 1981 and then approved its use in carbonated beverages in July 1983. It has subsequently been approved for use in a number of materials including multivitamins, fruit juices, stick-type confections, breath mints, and iced tea. The FDA requires the statement \"phenylketonurics: contains phenylalanine\" on labels of food products containing aspartame because individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU) must restrict their intake of phenylalanine. Aspartame is judged to be free of long-term cancer risks. Aspartame is not stable under certain conditions including baking and cooking, and prolonged exposure to acid conditions. In such situations it loses its sweetness. Products formed from aspartame include its component amino acids (phenylalanine and aspartic acid), methanol, and diketopiperazine (DKP). Animal studies show DKP to be nontoxic. Methanol occurs in small amounts and does not exceed that formed during consumption of many foods including fresh fruits and vegetables. FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) monitors aspartame's safety in part through reports of adverse reactions. After aspartame was approved for use in carbonated beverages, the FDA received an increased number of reports concerning adverse reactions related to aspartame. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reviewed these reports, which included complaints of neurologic, gastrointestinal, andallergic reactions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Ischemia, hypoglycemia, and epilepsy have long been thought to produce similar or identical brain damage. Furthermore, these insults have been assumed to be additive in their damaging effects. These notions have been based on neuropathological observations in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, and on the tenet that energy failure (ischemia, hypoglycemia) and increased demand for energy (epilepsy) similarly give rise to selective neuronal necrosis. Recently, other bases for considering these three insults identical have grown out of observations that loss of calcium homeostasis is common to all and that an excitotoxic mechanism of selective neuronal necrosis exists in all three conditions. Fundamental differences between ischemia, hypoglycemia, and epilepsy include the underlying neurochemical changes induced, the neuronal revival times, the time course of neuronal death, the distribution of selective neuronal necrosis, and the likely excitotoxins released. Lactic acid accumulation, implicated in damage to the neuropil as well as to neuronal cell bodies, also occurs to different degrees and in different distributions in the three conditions. The degree and distribution of pannecrosis is thus also different in ischemia, hypoglycemia, and epilepsy.\r"

An HIV-2 proviral DNA fragment containing the X-orf was expressed in E. coli, and the recombinant protein was used in an immunoblot assay. The X-orf protein was recognized specifically by the sera of HIV-2-infected people but not by the sera of SIV-infected monkeys or HIV-1-infected humans. A rabbit antiserum raised against the recombinant X-orf protein recognized a 16 kD protein in HIV-2-infected cells. The native X-orf protein was not glycosylated or phosphorylated, was localized in the cytoplasm of HIV-2-infected cells, and appeared to be associated with mature virions.\r"

Because these data have special features uncharacteristic of most laboratory data, a comprehensive account of statistical methods appropriate for their analysis is contained in this paper. Standard methods are described for the analysis of HIV-1 antigen in serum collected repeatedly over time in the same individual. For the analysis of lymphocyte culture data, more sophisticated statistical techniques based on nonparametric survival analysis methods are proposed. Using microcomputer software available upon request and developed to implement this statistical procedure, a significant decline in lymphocyte HIV-1 virus expression was noted between pretreatment and 3 months after the initiation of therapy among AZT-treated patients (p = 0.0017) that was not seen in placebo-treated patients (p = 0.25). Statistically significant between-group differences were also noted in the change from baseline at 3 months in HIV-1 antigen serum data (p = 0.040). We conclude that HIV-1 core polypeptide is an important measure of the antiretroviral activity of AZT and that the demonstrated clinical efficacy of AZT relative to placebo parallels its antiretroviral effect.\r"

In guttate psoriasis the number of Langerhans cells (LC) was not increased and CD8+ cells predominated, however, most CD4+ cells were activated. In erythrodermal psoriasis some CDI+ cells were found in the dermis although CD8+ cells predominated and were activated. In palmo-plantar psoriasis LC were found in the epidermis and superficial dermis and CD4+ cells were more numerous than CD8+ cells, some in turn expressing HLA-DR. In flexural psoriasis the LC formed clusters in the epidermis, and activated CD4+ cells predominated. In psoriasis vulgaris CD4+ cells predominated over CD8+ although the latter were activated. Our observations tend to support Valdimarsson's hypothesis on the immune basis of psoriasis, but we believe that two cycles coexist in psoriasis--one inflammatory and the other immunological--and that interaction between these leads to epidermal hyperproliferation.\r"

More than 71% of the abnormal biopsies and 39% of the normal paired biopsies had histological evidence of HPV infection. Cytological evidence of HPV infection was seen in 38.5% of cervical smears. Immunocytochemistry revealed HPV antigen in 22% of the abnormal biopsies and in 4.2% of the 'normal' biopsies. The presence of HPV infection in colposcopically normal cervical tissue both inside and outside the transformation zone may help to explain why current methods for treatment of cervical HPV infection are often unsuccessful.\r"

The stabilisation of refraction was observed, and the most suitable time to prescribe 'first glasses' was estimated retrospectively. In the silk group this was found to be at three months in the nylon group at four months. However, results in the latter were less predictable with greater variation.\r"

Treatment did not reduce either the recurrence rate or the prevalence of chronic disease. Complications of treatment were uncommon.

Measurement of ejection fraction demonstrated a good correlation (r = 0.83) between digital subtraction angiography and left ventricular angiography. In the assessment of left ventricular segmental wall motion the use of a central venous injection, particularly in those patients with severely impaired ventricular function, proved superior to the use of a peripheral injection.\r"

In all cases, ultrasonography gave the first indication of a tumour and intravenous urography was tumour-specific in only six, whilst angiography was so in only four of the cases with peripheral extension beyond the normal organ limits. Examination by computed tomography showed retrospectively, in the three cases with smaller oncocytomas up to 3 cm in diameter, findings that seemed promisingly characteristic: without contrast medium, the tumour appeared homogeneously hyperdense in comparison with normal renal parenchyma, but homogeneously hypodense after injection of contrast medium. One of the smaller oncocytomas, however, showed regions of heterogeneity both with and without contrast medium. Only one oncocytoma of 4 cm diameter presented the central stellate, low-attenuation \"scar\" described by Quinn et al. The angiographic criteria cited by Ambos were fulfilled in only three of the larger oncocytomas. In four of the cases, the tumour was enucleated and the organ left in situ on the basis of frozen section diagnosis. Those patients with tumours extending outside the organ or those of questionable diagnosis on frozen section were treated by nephrectomy. In one patient, the pathologist suspected metastasis from the thyroid; hemithyroidectomy confirmed on oncocytic adenoma of the left thyroid lobe.\r"

Compared with the findings at surgery or autopsy, ultrasound disclosed eight of 12 tumours presenting as extraductal masses. In 16 patients with tumour growth predominantly along the bile ducts, ultrasound disclosed poorly demarcated echogenic tissue high in the hepatic hilum in four cases. In only two patients was it possible to detect tumour spread. Ultrasound-guided, fine-needle aspiration biopsy was performed in seven patients revealing malignant cells in five cases and fine-needle tissue biopsy was performed in two cases revealing malignant tissue. The presence of intrahepatic dilated bile radicles with normal-sized common bile ducts should raise the possibility of a high bile duct carcinoma. If a tumour lesion is detected we suggest the use of ultrasound-guided, fine-needle biopsy.\r"

Seventy-nine per cent of the hilar masses were of increased echogenicity relative to surrounding liver, 19% were of reduced echogenicity and 2% of mixed echogenicity. An intraluminal mass was seen in 21% of the patients and bile duct wall thickening was observed in 4%. The mass detection rate of different ultrasound equipment was also compared.

Fifteen (68%) of the 22 patients in the placebo group with a positive post-operative urine culture subsequently developed a clinically apparent urinary tract infection (UTI) or received antibiotics in view of a positive urine culture. Adequate prostatic concentrations of Ciprofloxacin were achieved in all who received the drug. A significant reduction in the number of positive post-operative urine cultures and urinary tract infections requiring antibiotic therapy was achieved in this group. Six patients (5.5%) developed clinical evidence of septicaemia, 5 of whom were in the placebo group. No organisms resistant to Ciprofloxacin were encountered. Prior to surgery, 19% of all patients were found to have previously unsuspected bacteriuria. Ciprofloxacin tended to reduce the chances of this group developing a UTI or requiring antibiotics. Further, there was a highly significant reduction in post-operative infective complications in those with sterile urine at the time of resection who had received the drug. This study suggests that antibiotic cover for TURP is of clinical benefit. Ciprofloxacin may prove suited to this purpose, although further experience with the drug is still required.\r"

Monoclonal antibodies do not detect 'breast cancer specific' antigens but, rather, they react with normal or modified tissue antigens which are either preferentially or inappropriately expressed upon malignant cells. Thus far a number of monoclonal antibodies that have a preferential reaction with breast cancer tissue have been developed. They have a potential value in immunohistopathology as diagnostic tools and in the recognition of small quantities of malignant cells, in the development of serum assay for tumour markers in breast cancer and in the radio-immunodetection of metastases. There has been success in effecting selective targeting of anticancer agents (cytotoxic drugs, toxins, radionuclides) to tumour deposits and encouraging results are obtained in preclinical in vivo studies. Various clinical studies are now in progress to evaluate the role of monoclonal antibodies in the management of breast cancer.\r"

Thirteen per cent of patients in arm 2 and thirteen per cent in arm 3 suffered major toxicity, necessitating interruption of treatment. Two of these patients died of marrow aplasia. Statistical analysis of survival showed that prognosis was influenced by the well-known prognostic variables, invasion of the wall, nodal status and site of tumour. The different treatments in the three arms, however, did not show any impact on prognosis, even when adjustments were made for the most relevant prognostic variables. Given the lack of effect on survival and the presence of clinically important toxicity, FU and Me-CCNU +/- levamisole cannot be recommended as adjuvant therapy for resected gastric cancer.\r"

All patients underwent exploratory laparotomy. The mortality rate was 3 per cent, all deaths occurring within 48 h of operation. Two-thirds of patients were considered severely ill on admission, and one-third were moderately ill. Six patients had positive blood cultures on entry into the study. The mean age was 31 years and concurrent disease was present in 14 per cent of the patients. A satisfactory response was achieved in 82 per cent of patients receiving cefotetan and in 65 per cent of those receiving AGM, whereas the response was unsatisfactory in 18 per cent of cefotetan patients and 35 per cent of those receiving AGM (P = 0.075 n.s.). Significant changes in laboratory values during the study occurred in 51 per cent of patients, and 7 per cent required vitamin K administration for hypoprothrombinaemia. The results of this study suggest that antibiotic therapy with single agent cefotetan is as safe and effective as a combination of ampicillin, gentamicin and metronidazole in patients with severe intra-abdominal sepsis requiring operative management.\r"

Transplant biopsy had been performed because of the occurrence of proteinuria in 8 patients (pts), for suspected rejection in 16 and systematically in the remaining 9 who had no proteinuria and a normal renal function. In all cases the lesions were identified by IF and were confirmed by electron microscopy (EM) in 14 pts. Granular deposits of IgG were diffuse in 22 cases and segmental in 7. Sequential specimens were available in 17 pts and showed the persistence or the increase of the IgG deposits in all patients but one in whom they had disappeared. Age at transplantation (Tx) ranged from 2 years 3 months to 16 years. Grafts were from cadaveric donors in 27 pts and from living related donors in 2 pts. In none of the recipients was MGN the nephropathy of the native kidneys. With a follow-up of 18 to 74 months, 6 pts never developed a proteinuria.

A constant infusion of somatostatin (300 micrograms/h) and soluble insulin (0.2 mU/kg/min) resulted in peripheral serum insulin slightly higher than basal in both uremics (16 +/- 3 and 22 +/- 3 microU/ml; step 1 and 2, respectively) and controls (20 +/- 2 and 22 +/- 1 microU/ml). The glucose-induced glucose uptake (3-3H-glucose) assessed as the difference between step 2 and 1 glucose disposal at the final 30 min of each step was markedly reduced in uremics (3.2 +/- 0.5 mg/kg/min) compared to healthy subjects (5.7 +/- 0.8 mg/kg/min; p less than 0.03). However, the percentage increment in glucose uptake from step 1 to step 2 hyperglycemia was comparable in the two groups (134 +/- 27 and 148 +/- 17%). Modest hyperglycemia (120 mg/dl) and slightly raised insulinemia resulted in comparable suppression of the endogenous (hepatic) glucose production (EGP) in healthy (1.6 +/- 0.2 mg/kg/min) and uremic subjects (1.5 +/- 0.3 mg/kg/min). In controls, pronounced hyperglycemia (300 mg/dl) further reduced EGP (0.6 +/- 0.3 mg/kg/min; p less than 0.01) while EGP in uremics on the contrary tended to rise (2.0 +/- 0.4 mg/kg/min; p = 0.09), thus indicating an abnormal reaction of the liver.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In certain situations heparin used during hemodialysis can increase the risk of bleeding. Various groups have suggested that this bleeding risk can be reduced by using prostacyclin (PGI2). Since PGI2 is labile under physiological conditions and is thus difficult to use, we have used the stable PGI2 analogue CG 4203. This study in 5 chronic dialysis patients was designed to apply the following 5 different dialysis regimens with bicarbonate to each patient for 5 h: 1) conventional full heparinization; 2) CG 4203 (25 ng/kg/min) for the first 120 min, then full heparinization; 3) CG 4203 alone for 5 h (25 ng/kg/min); 4) initial bolus dose of heparin (500 IU), then continuous infusion of heparin (200 IU/h) and CG 4203 (25 ng/kg/min); 5) as 4) above but 35 ng/kg/min of CG 4203. Slight falls in thrombocytes and in some case substantial falls in leukocytes shortly after commencing the dialysis cannot be avoided when administering CG 4203 alone. Both 25 and 35 ng/kg/min doses of CG 4203 produced approx. 50% inhibition of the ADP-induced platelet aggregation for the entire 5 h administration period. At 30 min after dialysis the inhibition had fallen to approx. 20%. Although administering CG 4203 alone for 2 h produced no extracorporeal occlusion, administering CG 4203 alone for 5 h, some clots did occur after 3-5 h, which caused premature termination of the dialysis or made reinfusion impossible after 5 h. When 25 ng/kg/min was applied together with a continuous low dose of heparin for 5 h, only small clots were observed which did not impede dialysis or reinfusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Eleven patients adhered to a high protein diet (1.8 g/kg/day) and, subsequently, to a low protein diet (0.6 g/kg/day) for four weeks each. Renal hemodynamics were studied at the end of the respective dietary periods. Glomerular filtration rate (inulin clearance) did not change significantly (delta %: -1.5 +/- 5.4%; mean +/- s.e.m.), whereas endogenous creatinine clearance was lower on the low protein diet (delta %: -7.8 +/- 2.8%; p less than 0.02), suggesting an interference with the tubular secretion of creatinine. Effective renal plasma flow was significantly lower on the low protein diet (223.7 +/- 47.6 ml/min vs 282.1 +/- 67.1 ml/min; delta %: -15.4 +/- 4.9%; p less than 0.02). As a result, filtration fraction increased from 0.18 +/- 0.01 on the high protein diet to 0.22 +/- 0.02 on the low protein diet (p less than 0.01). The low protein diet caused a significant decrease in protein excretion from 4.0 +/- 0.9 g/24 h to 3.1 +/- 0.7 g/24 h (p less than 0.02). Our study demonstrates that renal hemodynamic responses to more sustained protein loading and protein restriction differ from the reported responses to acute protein loading. Different mechanisms may be involved. In this light it is doubtful if the renal hemodynamic response to acute protein loading can predict a beneficial effect of protein restriction.\r"

  ".W": "Children with minimal lesion nephrotic syndrome (MLNS) may later develop focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). It has been suggested that a low percentage of epithelial podocyte effacement (EPE) and a high degree of epithelial cell vacuolization (ECV) in nonsclerotic glomeruli presage FSGS, and that extensive epithelial cell vacuolization in biopsies clearly showing FSGS predicts a poor clinical outcome. To investigate these contentions, we examined by electron microscopy three glomeruli from each of the first biopsies of 30 patients. Ten patients (group 1) had MLNS, 10 (group 2) had FSGS, and 10 (group 3) had MLNS which progressed to FSGS. Clinical data was obtained by retrospective review of medical records. The percent of epithelial podocyte effacement was calculated by computerized linear tracing and epithelial cell vacuolization was scored semiquantitatively from 0-3. (formula; see text) The percent podocyte effacement in each group was the same and does not distinguish MLNS from FSGS. Group 2 had more extensive epithelial cell vacuolization than group 1 (p less than 0.04) and the same as group 3 (p = 0.16). The combined ECV score for groups 2 and 3, however, was significantly greater than for group 1 (p less than 0.025) suggesting that epithelial cell vacuolization may indeed be a marker of FSGS. The extent of epithelial cell vacuolization did not correlate with creatinine clearance at latest follow-up, and thus does not predict clinical outcome.\r"

As stated by Alford in 1967, \"neonatal diagnoses of infections acquired in utero, natally and postnatally, are inherently difficult.\" Twenty years later, this statement is still true. In this review, the diagnostic problems encountered in the evaluation of a suspected perinatal infection have been discussed, as have the complexities of the evaluation process for the original four TORCH agents, as well as for three additional agents. From our point of view, the usefulness of the TORCH acronym has been to focus attention on perinatal infections. Its main drawback has been the resultant overuse of TORCH titers ignoring the complexity of the diagnostic process. Ideally, the TORCH concept serves two functions. It continues to remind us of the multiplicity of pathogens that can cause perinatal infection, and it underscores the need for thorough diagnostic evaluation for these challenging infections. We believe that this is an appropriate expansion of the TORCH complex, and we anticipate that this expanded TORCH complex will continue to grow.\r"

Surviving infants have a high rate of neonatal morbidity, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia and intraventricular hemorrhage. No long-term follow-up reveals handicap rates of 22 to 35 per cent, with multiple sensory and neurodevelopmental handicaps. With current methods of care, the biologic threshold of extrauterine survival is 23 to 24 weeks' gestation, or a birth weight of 500 to 600 gm. There is no simple arithmetical answer to the question of \"how small is too small?\" It should be apparent from the information presented in this article that the state of the art is constantly in flux. New developments have, to date, continued to decrease the threshold of viability. Application of the full weight of the available technology results in only a few infants of less than 23 to 24 weeks' gestation or with birth weights of less than 500 to 600 gm surviving. The future continues to lie in the development of the methodology to prolong the sojourn in utero, rather than in dramatic biophysical, biochemical, and technologic advances.\r"

  ".W": "In conclusion, the suggested management for PROM follows two general principles. The first principle, which is accepted by most, consists of searching for a positive history of PROM, confirming PROM (by speculum examination, pooling, positive Nitrazine testing, and ferning), and obtaining cervical and vaginal cultures (for group B streptococcus/gonococcus and chlamydia). If free-flowing fluid from the cervix is seen, or if pooling is present, a sample should be sent for L-S and PG analysis. The cervix is assessed (for position, dilatation, and abnormalities), monitoring of maternal vital signs and fetal heart rate is done, white blood cell and differentials are obtained, and finally, immediate ultrasonogrpahy should be performed to document fetal position and viability, the number of fetuses, the amount of amniotic fluid, fetal anatomy, gestational age, and estimated weight. The other principle is a controversial one. It involves the use of amniocentesis for determination of fetal lung maturity and the presence of bacteria (if technically feasible); the use of a short course of tocolysis (terbutaline, 0.250 mg subcutaneously, or a similar medication for patient evaluation) if patient has contractions and all information is not yet available; the administration of steroids to accelerate fetal lung maturity; and finally, the administration of prophylactic antibiotics. In any event, delivery is indicated if there is clinical evidence of chorioamnionitis, as evidenced by maternal fever and tachycardia, tender uterus, fetal tachycardia, elevated white blood cell count with bands or left shift, and a positive Gram stain on examination of amniotic fluid. Antibiotic prophylaxis or treatment is only used if group B streptococcus or N. gonorrhea, or both, are present. Cesarean sections are reserved for obstetrical indications only. Furthermore, delivery is also indicated if there is evidence of lung maturity, fetal distress, active labor or advanced cervical dilatation (greater than or equal to 4 cm), PROM before the 20th to 22nd week of gestation, advanced gestational age of more than 36 weeks, or hemorrhage. In all circumstances, monitoring of the fetus with PROM is essential, with a nonstress test performed every other day to assess variable decelerations or a daily biophysical profile performed, as previously recommended. Even though no absolute recommendation exists as to the frequency of intrapartum testing, evaluation of the fetus with PROM should be done frequently, even on a daily basis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

If prolonged malabsorption of tocopherol occurs, a recognized hemolytic anemia and spinocerebellar degeneration develops after a period of months to years. This is preventable with tocopherol supplementation. However, a benefit of tocopherol supplementation in premature infants who are transiently unable to feed after birth has been harder to prove. Pharmacologic doses have not definitively been shown to be beneficial in any of the putative oxygen toxicity syndromes, with the possible exception of PV/IVH. It is exciting that tocopherol appears to reduce significantly the incidence and severity of IVH, and this potential application underscores the urgent need for pharmacologic studies of this lipid nutrient. In order to administer the drug safely, we must establish the best means of assessing sufficiency and toxicity in premature infants. Measures of tissue capacity to resist oxidative stress appear to be the most promising of these tests at this time. In the interim, a working proposition is to provide sufficient tocopherol to these infants to raise the plasma levels into the range considered normal for term, breastfed infants.\r"

  ".W": "1. Immunohistochemical, immunoblotting and release experiments were performed on ileum from control rats, from 8-week streptozotocin-diabetic rats and from diabetic rats after acute application of insulin in vitro. 2. There was an increase in vasoactive-intestinal-polypeptide-like and a decrease in calcitonin-gene-related-peptide-like immunoreactivity in the myenteric plexus of the diabetic rat ileum, although electrically evoked release of both peptides from enteric nerves was defective. Acute application of insulin in vitro reversed the defective release and changes in immunoreactivity of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and calcitonin-gene-related peptide seen in the enteric nerves of streptozotocin-diabetic rat ileum. 3. In addition, using a monoclonal neurofilament antibody RT 97 that recognizes a phosphorylated neurofilament epitope present in normal enteric nerves, it was shown that this phosphorylated neurofilament epitope was absent in diabetic nerves, even though a polyclonal neurofilament antibody revealed that neurofilaments were present in both axons and cell bodies of the myenteric plexus of diabetic rat ileum. After only 2 h of insulin incubation in vitro, the phosphorylated neurofilament epitope was again present in the nerves. 4. It is suggested that the abnormal distribution of phosphorylated neurofilaments and defective storage and release of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and calcitonin-gene-related peptide in the present study may be a more general feature of diabetes. The restoration of these abnormalities by continuous acute insulin application in vitro shown here suggests that the availability of a steady level of insulin might prevent some of the changes which occur in early stages of diabetes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study was designed to determine if the rate of healing could be improved by the addition of topical nutrition to the irrigating solution. 2. Forty-eight patients with chronic leg ulcers were admitted to hospital for a minimum of 6 weeks bed-rest. During this time the ulcers were continuously irrigated by one of four test solutions. The solutions were: normal saline; a dilute amino acid solution isotonic with the normal saline; a hyperosmolar saline solution; a hyperosmolar amino acid solution. There were 12 ulcers in each group. 3. The amino acid solutions produced significantly faster healing than the saline solutions (P less than 0.01). Concentration had no significant effect on healing (P greater than 0.15). 4. The application of amino acids does appear to enhance healing in this model of delayed wound healing. This effect does not depend only on the osmolarity of the solution used.\r"

Glomerular and tubular function was studied before and 2 months after unilateral nephrectomy in 14 healthy kidney donors by measurement of the clearances of 51Cr-labelled ethylenediaminetetra-acetate, lithium, beta 2-microglobulin, albumin and immunoglobulin G. 2. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of the kidney that remained in the donor rose from 45 +/- 10 (mean +/- SD) to 59 +/- 10 ml/min (P less than 0.01) 5 days after contralateral nephrectomy and remained at this level through the observation period. 3. The lithium clearance (CLi) of the remaining kidney rose from 11.6 +/- 3.7 to 20.5 +/- 8.2 ml/min (P less than 0.01) and remained significantly elevated throughout the observation period. 4. Absolute proximal fluid reabsorption rate (APR), which was estimated as GFR minus CLi, was unchanged 5 days after contralateral nephrectomy, but then rose gradually to reach significantly elevated levels after 4 weeks. 5. Fractional proximal reabsorption (FPR; APR/GFR) fell from 0.75 +/- 0.06 to 0.66 +/- 0.11 (P less than 0.01) but subsequently rose to levels not significantly decreased from normal. 6. Twenty-four hour fractional clearances of beta 2-microglobulin, albumin and immunoglobulin G rose markedly on the day of nephrectomy, peaked at 2-3 days and subsequently fell to moderately elevated levels. 7. Both the CLi and the plasma protein clearance studies demonstrate that the early response of the remaining kidney to contralateral nephrectomy in man is an increase in GFR, an unchanged APR and a fall in FPR. The proximal tubules thus initially handle the increased filtrate load by passing it on to more distal nephron segments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The plasma renin concentration (PRC) and active renin concentration determined by radioimmunometric assay (ARC) were measured before and after administration of frusemide or captopril to normal volunteers. 2. Injection of 40 mg of frusemide followed by 1 h in the upright position significantly increased both PRC (P less than 0.001) and ARC (P less than 0.001). Oral administration of 50 mg of captopril also increased PRC (P less than 0.05) and ARC (P less than 0.05). 3. ARC and PRC were linearly correlated in the basal supine position [y = 0.635x - 0.048 (y = PRC, x = ARC), r = 0.958, P less than 0.001], after frusemide injection and standing (y = 0.800x + 0.359, r = 0.793, P less than 0.02) and after captopril administration in the supine position (y = 0.938x - 0.555, r = 0.998, P less than 0.001). 4. A cross-calibration study in which pure human renin was added to pooled plasma and PRC and ARC were measured showed linearity between the values obtained by the two methods. 5. The regression line for values of PRC and ARC in the supine position after captopril administration had a significantly greater slope (P less than 0.001) and that for values after frusemide injection and standing was significantly elevated (P less than 0.001) compared with the regression line for basal values in the supine position. 6. These results show that the biological activity of renin may be increased by various acute stimulations of renin to inappropriately high levels compared with the immunological activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This trend is expected to continue, with the development of instruments having improved capability for antiglobulin testing. Autologous blood salvage works well with both the canister systems and the high-speed continuous flow instruments. Given the increasing demand to avoid transfusion of homologous blood, the applications of this technology will expand, and it is likely that technological improvements will be made.\r"

Instrument manufacturers will see the need for analyzers that are robot-friendly and allow for simplified interfacing, both electronic and mechanical. Robots will become more versatile even to the point of performing complete instrument repair. Laboratories will be equipped with many task-oriented robotic stations, including, for example, accessioning and processing robots that prepare samples for transport by robotic carts. Analysis will be performed by a combination of robot and dedicated analyzer. Laboratory results will be reviewed by algorithms in the larger laboratory computer, which will alert the laboratory worker to unusual results.

Recent advances in our understanding of the regulation of mineral metabolism have led to new insights into these areas and have improved our ability to deal with this rather common clinical entity. The purpose of this monograph is to give a current view of hypercalcemia as it is appreciated in the outpatient and the inpatient setting. It is designed to focus the evaluation of the hypercalcemic patient in a way that is both expedient and accurate as well as to take advantage of available therapies. A summary of the underlying physiological principles of calcium homeostasis is followed by a consideration of the complete differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia. The two most important causes of hypercalcemia, primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy, are emphasized. Signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia are discussed with particular attention to those factors that are influential in accentuating or masking these features. Finally, an approach to the therapy of hypercalcemia is presented within a pathophysiological framework.\r"

In model lung tests, indexes that compared the actual washout curve with a calculated ideal curve (mixing ratio, multiple-breath alveolar mixing inefficiency, and pulmonary clearance delay) were unaffected by changes in tidal volume and series dead space, whereas the others varied markedly. In both spontaneously breathing and mechanically ventilated patients all indexes showed a significant difference between smokers and nonsmokers (P less than 0.002), but the indexes were somewhat different in their assessment of different ventilatory patterns. However, the mean value for all indexes, with the exception of mixing ratio, was smallest with a fast insufflation followed by an end-inspiratory pause. Any of the indexes may be useful if its limitations are recognized, but mixing ratio, multiple-breath alveolar mixing inefficiency, and pulmonary clearance delay seem preferable, because they are not affected by changes in tidal volume and dead space fraction.\r"

Initial studies of carotid atheroma using Duplex scanning classified plaques into heterogeneous and homogeneous and found a strong correlation between heterogeneous lesions and the presence of intraplaque haemorrhage or ulceration in the endarterectomy specimen. The B-mode classification of plaque appearance described in this paper is an expansion of the above classification. The study group comprised 220 patients who underwent 244 procedures. The indication for carotid endarterectomy was symptomatic disease in the great majority of cases. We found a high incidence of unstable plaque pathology in the operative specimens, and a predominance of the more echolucent ultrasound plaque appearances (types 1 and 2). There is a statistically significant relationship (p less than 0.001) between ultrasound appearance types 1 and 2 and the presence of either intraplaque haemorrhage or ulceration in the endarterectomy specimen.\r"

  ".W": "A spectrum of asymptomatic patients with carotid bifurcation disease exists, with varying degrees of risk for each sub-group. With Duplex scanning we studied the carotid arteries of several asymptomatic populations: volunteers at a health fair, patients referred to our vascular laboratory because of cervical bruits or associated vascular disease, and the contralateral asymptomatic vessels in those patients who had previously undergone endarterectomy. Volunteers had an extremely low incidence of carotid disease, possibly reflecting a bias of more healthy individuals attending a health fair. The contralateral asymptomatic vessels and vessels in the hospital asymptomatic group both had similar disease, with mainly fibrous or calcific plaques. Occurrence of new carotid territory symptoms was low in each hospital group. However, there were more strokes in the territory of the contralateral asymptomatic vessels, suggesting a greater risk for these patients. Symptomatic vessels tend to have plaques that are heterogeneous and echolucent. Change in plaque morphology may eventually become the best predictor of stroke risk, but longer follow-up studies of plaque progression are needed. In the meantime, the characteristics of asymptomatic populations in carotid artery studies must be carefully defined.\r"

Using Duplex ultrasound imaging of the carotid bifurcation, we have found it possible to classify atherosclerotic plaques into four groups which appear to reflect the plaque pathology. Using this classification we have found that diabetics and non-diabetics have similar ultrasound plaque type distributions in symptomatic patients. Further subdivision of the diabetic patients on the basis of their mode of diabetic control has shown that insulin treated diabetics tend to show little evidence of intraplaque haemorrhage and ulceration. These features suggest that factors other than atherosclerosis at the carotid bifurcation may be responsible for the increased stroke risk in diabetic patients. Diabetic microangiopathy and reduced vessel compliance due to medial calcification have been suggested as possible factors. Insulin treatment of diabetics may protect against the development of occlusive atherosclerosis.\r"

Patients were followed at 1,3,6,12 months and then annually with routine clinical assessment, palpation of pulses and resting Doppler ankle/brachial index. In addition, the Doppler index was repeated after 5 minutes exercise on a treadmill set at 5 degrees and 3 km/hr. Follow-up has been carried out for a mean of 24 months (range 3-48 months) and during that time 30 vein grafts (28 patients) were submitted to angiography. This revealed vein graft stenosis in 15, native vessel disease in 11 and no morphologic abnormality in 4. One additional graft was suspected to have a stenosis but occluded before angiography could be carried out. At the time of detection by the treadmill test, 8 of the 15 (53%) confirmed vein graft stenoses, and 4 of 11 (36%) native vessel stenoses would not have been detected by clinical assessment or resting Doppler pressure measurements. The 15 vein graft stenoses which were corrected all remain patent, suggesting that treadmill testing is of value in the detection and prevention of early femoro-distal vein graft occlusion.\r"

Removal of the obstruction by dorsocranial resection of the liver and reconstruction of the veins by hepatoatrial anastomosis was carried out. In a 53-year-old female, the same procedure was carried out for a short segmental obstruction of the IVC and left hepatic vein. In both patients, postoperative examination revealed good patency of the IVC and the hepatic veins and increased portal venous flow as measured by Doppler-echography.

Of a wide range of fixatives and fixation conditions investigated, a short (five minute) exposure of cryostat sections to Bouin's fluid provided the most satisfactory results and--together with procedures to block endogenous biotin and alkaline phosphatase--yielded clear sections with no background staining or other artefacts to interfere with specific staining patterns. The sensitivity of the technique approaches that of a radioimmunoassay, as shown by the staining of the sinusoidal domains of hepatocellular plasma membranes by the guinea pig anti-LSP antisera at dilutions up to 1/50,000. Apart from its reliability and sensitivity the procedure offers additional advantages over techniques such as indirect immunofluorescence in that it provides a permanent preparation with well defined morphological details which can be seen by ordinary light microscopy.\r"

  ".U": "89093852\r", 
  ".W": "Symptomatic cholesterol gallstone disease occurs because of the combination of a number of biochemical and physiologic defects: formation of supersaturated bile, nucleation, crystal retention, stone growth, and gallbladder inflammation. There are several possible explanations for the high prevalence of supersaturated bile in the Western adult human as compared to other adult mammals. First, the human liver is defective in converting cholesterol to bile acids; the majority of cholesterol is eliminated as cholesterol. Second, the large flux of cholesterol in vesicular form is not matched by a large flux of recycling bile acids. Third, humans live sedentary lives and voluntarily reduce their caloric requirement to prevent obesity. Low caloric intake decreases the circulation of bile acids (including the flux through the hepatocyte). Fourth, the human species is a defective bile secretor in terms of biliary volume (microliter/kg-min) compared to other mammals. This is because human enterohepatic circulation of bile acids is \"sluggish\" and because bile acid-independent flow is also lower than in all other mammals. The accumulation of deoxycholic acid, a secondary bile acid formed in the colon, appears to cause secretion of bile that is supersaturated in cholesterol, and may also contribute. Five additional risk factors explain why cholesterol gallstone disease is so prevalent. First, the human species has a gallbladder, and the irregular meal pattern of humans may be responsible for prolonged storage of bile. Second, bile from cholesterol gallstone patients nucleates cholesterol more rapidly. Third, defective gallbladder contraction is associated with cholesterol gallstone disease in the majority of gallstone patients. Fourth, the healthy gallbladder absorbs cholesterol and desaturates bile--protective functions that may be lost with chronic cholecystitis. Finally, the presence of gallstones stimulates mucous secretion, which traps cholesterol crystals.\r"

  ".U": "89093854\r", 
  ".W": "Ursodeoxycholic acid (ursodiol) is a naturally occurring bile acid that constitutes about 1-2% of the bile acids in human bile. Although well known for more than 20 years in Japan as a treatment for biliary distress and dyspepsia, ursodiol has been tested as a gallstone-dissolving agent only since 1976. Successful dissolution occurs in 30-80% of subjects with radiolucent gallstones, depending on the size and number of the stones. Calcified or pigment stones do not respond to this treatment. The current theory of the pathogenesis of gallstones is that lithogenic bile, which is supersaturated with cholesterol, is secreted by the liver and is not produced in the gallbladder. Thus, although stones form in the gallbladder, defective hepatic cholesterol and bile acid metabolism are responsible for the abnormal bile. Gallstone-prone individuals show increased hepatocholesterol formation and reduced bile acid synthesis. As the micellar solubility limit in bile is exceeded, cholesterol microcrystals precipitate. Four factors account for ursodiol's effectiveness in gallstone dissolution: (a) biliary cholesterol secretion is diminished markedly during therapy; (b) hepatic bile acid synthesis is not inhibited by ursodiol; (c) the 7 beta-hydroxy group of ursodiol resists bacterial dehydroxylation, which lowers the amount of lithocholic acid formed and the cholestasis and liver damage it can cause; and (d) ursodiol is virtually free of side effects and toxicity; less than 1% of subjects experience transient diarrhea, which does not require discontinuation of treatment, and liver function tests remain normal. In about 50% of subjects, stones may recur within 84 months, and can be retreated with ursodiol.\r"

  ".W": "Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) of gallstones is a new and experimental treatment. Recent data seem to indicate that the use of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) after ESWL may optimize the results of the shock wave treatment. Most of the published data on the clinical use of such therapy emanate from two studies conducted in West Germany in approximately 300 patients. These subjects received combination therapy with UDCA and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) before and after ESWL. The stone fragments gradually disappeared by 18 months after lithotripsy. No adverse effects attributable to the UDCA-CDCA treatment were noted. Several considerations support the view that adjuvant chemical dissolution therapy will be necessary for best results with ESWL, including compatibility of the rate of stone dissolution postlithotripsy with that of chemical dissolution rather than mechanical ejection; the common presence of cholesterol-supersaturated bile in gallstone patients, promoting reconglomeration of fragments; and decreased contractility of the gallbladder, which may improve after successful cholelitholytic therapy with UDCA. Placebo-controlled studies on the use of UDCA with ESWL are currently being conducted.\r"

These include orally administered bile acids, contact dissolution with methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE), and extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. Paralleling these developments is a similar period of transition in the field of gallstone imaging. Technical considerations in performing ultrasonographic, roentgenographic, and cholecystographic studies become more important, since the criteria for use of the nonsurgical techniques place a greater emphasis on gallstone morphology. In ultrasonography, sizing artifacts from reflective surfaces, optimizing measurements, magnifying hard-copy images, positioning the patient, and optimizing transducer frequencies will need to be addressed. In roentgenography, coned views of the right upper quadrant, with the patient prone, will give the best results. Oral cholecystography (OCG) has largely been replaced by ultrasonography for the detection of gallstones, but it is still an essential part of the imaging workup because it permits adequate visualization of the gallbladder to assure patency of the cystic duct. Correlation of the findings from the several techniques has disclosed new insights and encouraged the use of tailored techniques. Based on the current criteria for the use of orally administered ursodeoxycholic acid, an estimated 60-70% of all patients who have gallstones may be suitable candidates for such treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Different bile acids have different effects on liver cells, depending on the degree of hydroxylation of the bile acid and the orientation of hydroxy groups. In decreasing order of hydrophobicity, and therefore hepatotoxicity, the bile acids may be ranked as follows: lithocholic greater than deoxycholic greater than chenodeoxycholic greater than cholic greater than ursodeoxycholic acid. The rationale for the use of ursodeoxycholic acid in chronic liver disease is to increase the overall hydrophilicity of the bile acid pool, which, because of cholestasis, retains potentially hepatotoxic bile acids. Recent clinical studies have indicated that ursodeoxycholic acid improves liver function indices in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis at doses ranging between 10 and 15 mg/kg/day. These doses would be considered in the high range in the use of ursodeoxycholic acid for gallstone dissolution. In a preliminary study we found that also lower doses were effective in primary biliary cirrhosis. Two studies to determine the optimal dose of ursodeoxycholic acid for chronic hepatitis and anicteric primary biliary cirrhosis were then carried out. Eighteen patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and 12 patients with chronic hepatitis were treated with 250, 500, and 750 mg of ursodeoxycholic acid per day for three consecutive 2-month periods. Highly significant decreases in serum enzyme levels were seen with the 250 mg/day dose, which were further improved by the higher doses. The improvement roughly paralleled the enrichment of conjugated bile acids with ursodeoxycholic acid. A separate study investigating the effect of shifting the bile acid pool composition toward less detergent moieties was also done.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The increase in the number of fungal infections seen in debilitated and immunocompromised patients in the last several years makes it necessary to consider all fungi as potential pathogens. Clinical microbiology laboratories are playing increasingly important roles in the recovery, isolation, and identification of these fungi. This article contains specific recommendations and references concerning a practical approach to the laboratory identification of systemic fungi. The proper and timely selection, collection, and transport of specimens is imperative, and clinicians are responsible for appropriate specimen selection to ensure optimal chances of recovery of pathogens. Respiratory tract secretions and blood are excellent sources for detection of disseminated fungal infection. Specimens should be placed into transport media if the sample size is small or if only a small number of organisms are thought to be present. Direct microscopic examination of specimens can provide valuable information, often allowing a clinician to initiate immediate therapy. Specimens that are more likely than others to contain systemic fungi and that should be examined routinely include the following: pulmonary biopsy material, bronchial washes and lavages, specimens from immunocompromised patients, purulent specimens, and specimens suspected of containing a specific fungus. Valuable methods of examining specimens directly include treatment with KOH and calcofluor white. Use of media to recover fungi is the basis of making a laboratory diagnosis of a fungal disease, and the use of proper recovery and subculture media is imperative. Noninhibitory media allow contaminants to grow readily and should be used only to recover fungi from normally sterile body sites or for subculture. Blood-enriched media allow almost all pathogenic and saprophytic fungi to flourish. Therefore, such media, unless they contain antibiotics, should not be used as primary recovery media. Media that contain antibiotics should be used as primary recovery media to prevent overgrowth of pathogenic fungi by contaminants. Yeasts recovered from clinical specimens can be identified by a combination of tests, which include direct microscopic examination, germ tube formation, microscopic morphology of growth on corn meal agar, and ability to utilize certain carbohydrates. Molds recovered from clinical specimens are identified by a combination of growth rate, colonial characteristics, size and shape of hyphae, and microscopic examination of reproductive structures and other fungal elements.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Then, with the advent of amphotericin B, we have had for over two decades essentially one effective agent, but a difficult drug to manipulate. The appearance of ketoconazole, the first systemic drug with relatively little toxicity, along with the appearance of ominous new forms of mycotic diseases, sharply stimulated interest in development of antifungal agents, initially in the azole classes, but now including a variety of other classes as well. We have very little idea how all of these drugs will act independently, and much less how they may interact together. Indeed, one of the most exciting developments is the return to amphotericin B, with repackaging in liposomes having created a markedly less toxic, and possibly much more potent, antifungal agent than \"traditional\" amphotericin B. There are indeed so many developments under way that the only safe conclusion that can be made is that within a few years current recommendations will be replaced by very different ones for most if not all of the major fungal pathogens.\r"

Although millions of persons in the United States have been infected with this fungus, few show signs of disease. Histoplasmosis has emerged as an important opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients, including those with AIDS. This review of histoplasmosis builds upon basic descriptions found in standard texts, incorporating important recent observations.\r"

  ".U": "89093876\r", 
  ".W": "Coccidioidomycosis is a highly variable disease. Initial respiratory tract infection can lead to self-limited pneumonia, pulmonary complications, and extrapulmonary disease. The early infection requires no therapy, except in immunosuppressed patients and other selected patients. Treatment for pulmonary complications may include surgery for cavities or pyopneumothorax (resulting from rupture of a cavity) and antifungal therapy for chronic pneumonia. The majority of extrapulmonary disease occurs in the skin, bones and joints, or meninges and is an indication for treatment with antifungal agents and sometimes adjunctive surgery. Meningitis is a particularly serious consequence of dissemination and currently is best treated with intrathecal instillation of antifungal agents. Antifungal agents useful in the treatment of coccidioidomycosis are amphotericin B, which is administered intravenously and is relatively toxic, and ketoconazole, which is administered orally and whose toxicities are less serious and reversible. Because studies to compare the efficacy of these two drugs have not been performed, selecting between them for use in individual patients is most rationally based on the pharmacologic differences, which lend themselves to different clinical settings. In future years, new antifungal agents will likely be available, some of which will offer significant advantages over present therapies. Itraconazole is an imidazole related to ketoconazole, which appears to be effective and possibly less toxic than ketoconazole. Fluconazole, another imidazole, has broad antifungal activity, a long serum half-life, and excellent penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid. Thus, the pharmacology of this agent would appear ideal for use in treating coccidioidal meningitis. In addition, other compounds with different modes of action are now under investigation in preclinical studies. It is therefore likely that continued improvements will occur in the coming years in the treatment of this disease.\r"

Similarly total congenital tracheal stenosis is accompanied by abnormalities of the cartilaginous structure, usually complete tracheal rings. These types of anomaly typically present either at, or soon after, birth and are associated with other congenital abnormalities. In this particular case the laryngotracheal hypoplasia occurred in the context of a herditary condition of multiple congenital abnormalities known as G syndrome (also known as Opitz-Frias syndrome or the Opitz-G syndrome).\r"

DBS bias is present when subjects are directed into or excluded from the study sample according to their disease status. For example, healthy individuals are excluded from and diseased individuals are directed into referred samples. Therefore, DBS bias is present in referred samples. Examples from the literature on Type A behavior and coronary artery disease (CAD) are presented to illustrate how DBS bias reduces statistical associations. The results of the current research indicate DBS bias has reduced the association between Type A behavior and CAD in a number of studies reported in recent years. In addition, the present article discusses techniques for assessing and controlling for DBS bias.\r"

Since the early 1950s, analysis has conventionally taken the form of comparing subcohorts that had suffered varying degrees of exposure to factor(s) under investigation. For this purpose, the \"subject-years\" approach to data reduction has now become virtually universal. Usually, some population's mortality (or morbidity) experience is used as reference, but there is continuing controversy over the choice of reference population, while difficulties arise in relation to study intervals, periods over which exposures should be measured, etc. The material for analysis becomes age- and periodic-specific ratios of disease, which, collapsed over ages and periods, lead to Standardized Mortality (or Morbidity) Ratios. For the analysis itself, Poisson regression models are efficient. From the late 1970s, analysis by case-referent methods has become common; here, the debate centres on how closely, and in what ways, referents should be matched with the cases. Logistic regression is the most common form of analysis. As there have been excellent recent summaries of methods of analysis (for both approaches), little emphasis is placed here on those aspects of development. Comparisons are made of research designs, and some possibilities for future development are outlined.\r"

  ".W": "Immune responses result in a variety of metabolic adjustments that are mediated by cytokines of leukocytic origin. Of the dozens of cytokines released during an immune response, interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are the major mediators of intermediary metabolism. These three cytokines act in concert to decrease food intake, increase resting energy expenditure, gluconeogenesis, glucose oxidation, and hepatic synthesis of fatty acids and acute phase proteins, decrease fatty acid uptake by adipocytes and alter the distribution of zinc, iron and copper. Most of these activities result from direct interactions between the cytokine and the responding cells. IL-1, TNF alpha and IL-6 also affect changes in metabolism by changing levels of circulating insulin, glucagon and corticosterone. The nutritional impact of these metabolic changes is dependent upon age. In growing animals, increases in energy expenditure and oxidation of amino acids are balanced by lower needs associated with growth. In adult animals, energy and amino acid requirements are increased by an amount similar to the increased basal metabolic rate and amino acid oxidation. Nutrition also influences the release of cytokines and consequently affects regulation of the immune response. For example, protein deficiency results in decreased IL-1 release and impaired tissue responses to IL-1.\r"

Human epidermal keratinocytes are stimulated to grow by choline supplementation in the presence of myo-inositol when grown in a commercial nutrient medium containing six other defined supplements. The optimal range of choline concentrations varied among donor cell lines, but consistently fell between 36 microM and 180 microM. Addition of 72 microM choline increased cell yield to 250 +/- 38% of that produced by myo-inositol supplementation alone and 92 +/- 8% of that produced by addition of a highly mitogenic hypothalamic extract, which was previously required for good growth in this culture system. Supplementation of the basal medium with both the extract and choline resulted in 165 +/- 13% of the cell yield observed with the extract addition alone. Supplementation with other phospholipid precursors did not further increase keratinocyte growth. Neither dermal fibroblasts nor epidermal melanocytes were stimulated by supplementation with choline, suggesting the high keratinocyte requirement is unusual. This completely defined culture medium for keratinocyte growth should prove useful in analyzing the role of phospholipids and other nutrients in human epidermis.\r"

No therapy had been undertaken, as the product was mistakenly assumed to be an acetone-containing nail polish remover. The second child, a 2-year-old boy, experienced signs of severe cyanide poisoning, but survived with vigorous supportive care. Both children had blood cyanide levels in the potentially lethal range. The observed delayed onset of severe toxic reactions supports the proposed mechanism of acetonitrile conversion to inorganic cyanide via hepatic microsomal enzymes. Physicians and poison centers should be alerted to the existence of this highly toxic product, sold for removal of sculptured nails and likely to be confused with the less toxic acetone-containing nail polish removers. We urge regulatory agencies to reconsider the wisdom of marketing a cosmetic that poses such an extreme health hazard.\r"

Special emphasis was on the role of Gal-Gal adhesin (P fimbriae) of non-genetically engineered uroisolates. It was shown that organisms that are P+ or T+ or Hly+ are more likely to colonize bladders than strains negative for those parameters (P less than 0.001). Additionally, P+ strains were more often associated with kidney histopathology than P- E. coli (P less than 0.05). However, the data also indicated that fimbriae (P and Type 1) were not sole determinants of virulence since two strains devoid of fimbriae, hemolysin, K capsules and sensitive to human serumcidal activity caused incipient and acute pyelonephritis. Even among identical serotypes and biotypes, the presence/absence of fimbriae did not appear to be the critical factor in urovirulence, nor did the presence of several positive characteristics (hemolysin, K capsule, flagella, serum resistance) in a given strain enhance uropathogenicity. Therefore, these properties do not need to work together to render an E. coli urovirulent. These phenotypic characters may simply represent associated or serologic markers with the host serving as the dominant determinant of susceptibility to urinary infection. The findings emphasize the inherent limitations in relating and extrapolating colonizing and invasive properties of genetically engineered strains to those of naturally occurring, wild-type E. coli human uroisolates causing pyelonephritis.\r"

The patients, ages 1 to 72 years, had a wide variety of renal diseases and serum creatinines of 1 to 16 mg/dl. Glomeruli were examined by light, immunofluorescence and electron microscopy, and glomerular alterations were measured. Filtration was induced in isolated glomeruli by an oncotic gradient and Kf calculated. Glomerular diameter (D), averaged for each patient, varied from 131 to 315 microns, and Kf varied from 5.7 to 51 nl/min mm Hg. Hydraulic conductivity (Lp) in 15 biopsies averaged 1.45 mu.min-1.mm Hg-1.cm-2. In order to identify the significant predictors of Kf and delineate their relationships, stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed. Kf increased with increasing glomerular size and with increasing degree of glomerular hypercellularity. D, in turn, increased with body surface area, urinary protein, and degree of capillary damage, and decreased with percent senescent glomeruli and degree of epithelial foot process broadening. Kf did not significantly correlate with clinical measures of renal function.\r"

We show by cultivating transported bacteria in agar that biological particles can survive the shock of the transport. Determination of the numbers of active cells evidences a more pronounced activity of the cultivated bacteria after impact with an Er laser than with a CO2 laser.\r"

The authors studied 881 patients who had undergone penetrating keratoplasty (total of 947 procedures) from January 1983 to March 1986 at the King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital, Riyadh, Saudia Arabia. All patients were followed for at least 6 months. Clinical evidence of bacterial keratitis developed in 113 (11.9%) eyes with penetrating keratoplasties in 108 patients. The causative organisms among those patients included: Streptococcus pneumoniae, 29 (26%); Staphylococcus epidermidis, 24 (21%); Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 13 (12%); Staphylococcus aureus, 5 (4%); Hemophilus influenzae, 5 (4%); Moraxella spp, 5 (4%); alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, 5 (4%); and other bacteria, 27 (25%). In addition, postoperative epithelial defects that required hospital admission for treatment developed in 21 (2.2%) patients. Herpetic keratitis developed in three (0.3%) patients and fungal keratitis developed in 1 (0.1%). Statistically significant predisposing risk factors included: trichiasis (P less than 0.0001), epithelial defects (P less than 0.0001), soft contact lens wear (P less than 0.0001), and eroding sutures (P less than 0.0001). The authors believe that the incidence of postoperative bacterial keratitis can be minimized or avoided by appropriate selection of patients for penetrating keratoplasties as well as good preoperative and postoperative management of associated ocular conditions.\r"

Oblique muscle involvement is infrequently reported, possibly because such involvement is difficult to identify clinically or by computed tomography (CT). The authors reviewed seven cases of orbital myositis involving the oblique muscles solely or in association with rectus muscle involvement. Standardized echography demonstrated homogeneous low-reflective enlargement, diagnostic of myositis, of the superior and inferior oblique muscles and tendons along their courses. The finding of massive inferior chemosis was associated with involvement of the inferior oblique muscle. Although the disease typically responds to therapy with systemic steroids, residual gaze restriction may occur. The oblique muscles may be frequently involved in idiopathic orbital myositis when evaluated by standardized orbital echography. In these cases, echography provides rapid, accurate, and reliable confirmation of the diagnosis of myositis, differentiates other orbital inflammatory diseases, and provides an objective measure of the therapeutic response.\r"

Comparison of measurements on 40 eyes indicated that transillumination largest diameter measurements were larger than histologic slide measurements (mean difference, 2.87 mm). Multiple linear regression analysis yielded the following equation: transillumination diameter = [4.73 + (0.58 X histologic diameter) + (0.38 X histologic height) + (1.87 X anterior location)]. Using the actual and predicted transillumination measurements, the results of this study support a previously published report on these data: treatment type, tumor size, and location were predictive of melanoma-related deaths, metastases, and all deaths.\r"

In study 1, 42 patients received either levobunolol or vehicle 1 hour before a unilateral Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy. Elevated IOP (greater than or equal to 10 mmHg) occurred in up to 38% of those in the vehicle group and none in the levobunolol group. Mean IOP increased up to 6 mmHg in the vehicle group, whereas it decreased up to 3 mmHg in the levobunolol group. In study 2, 41 patients received either levobunolol or vehicle immediately after a unilateral ECCE involving the use of a viscoelastic preparation and the implantation of a posterior chamber intraocular lens (PC IOL). The incidence of IOP elevations (greater than or equal to 10 mmHg) was up to 40% in the vehicle group and 19% in the levobunolol group. Mean IOP increased up to 9 mmHg in the vehicle group and up to 2 mmHg in the levobunolol group. Thus, marked elevations in IOP after posterior capsulotomies or ECCEs may be minimized by prophylactic treatment with levobunolol.\r"

During the 3-month study, intraocular pressure (IOP) reductions in the two levobunolol groups were significantly greater than in the betaxolol group. From a mean baseline IOP of approximately 25 mmHg, overall mean reductions were 6.2 and 6.0 mmHg for the 0.25 and 0.5% levobunolol groups, respectively, and 3.7 mmHg for the betaxolol group. No clinically or statistically significant among-group differences were noted in the systemic safety variables evaluated.

The authors reviewed the results of PK for 102 cases of pseudophakic bullous keratopathy (43 anterior chamber, 50 iris-supported, and 9 posterior chamber) with respect to: (1) the type of IOL, (2) coexisting abnormalities, and (3) management of the IOL at surgery. Graft failure after 2 years of follow-up was: (1) retained iris-supported IOLs, 9%; (2) retained anterior chamber IOLs, 60%; (3) retained posterior chamber intraocular lenses (PC IOL), 0%; (4) removed IOLs, 9%; and (5) exchanged IOLs, 20%. After 5 years of follow-up, 13 of 13 PKs with retained closed-loop anterior chamber IOLs had failed. Visual results were best in eyes with retained iris-supported, rigid anterior chamber or PC IOLs and when the IOL was removed without replacement. The authors recommend that closed-loop anterior chamber lenses and unstable lenses of any type be removed or exchanged and that well-fixated PC IOLs and iris-clip IOLs be retained at the time of PK for pseudophakic bullous keratopathy.\r"

Topical steroid (85%) and antibiotic (59%) usage were common iatrogenic factors. Half the infections occurred more than 1 year after grafting. Bacterial infections involving gram-positive organisms (59%) predominated, except for patients with extended-wear hydrophilic contact lenses, which usually involved gram-negative bacilli. The incidence of fungal infections (6%) was relatively low. Recommendations to minimize microbial keratitis include prompt attention to exposed, broken, or loose sutures, and preventive and therapeutic management of epithelial defects. The inadequacy of low-dose antibiotics in precluding microbial infection in many cases and the propensity to develop infections with resistant organisms suggest that guidelines for using postoperative and prophylactic topical antibiotics require reevaluation.\r"

Four of 60 ketorolac-treated patients compared with 25 of 58 placebo-treated patients required supplemental corticosteroid therapy to suppress inflammation in the postoperative period which was statistically significant (P less than 0.001).

The incidence of EOGBS was 1.6 cases/1000 live births among 7960 inborn infants; the mortality rate for inborn and outborn infants was 28%. Multivariate analysis identified five features adequately predicting fatal outcome: birth weight less than 2500 g, absolute neutrophil count less than 1500 cells/mm3, hypotension, apnea and a pleural effusion on the initial chest radiographs. With these five variables and an initial blood pH less than 7.25, a clinical score was constructed that correctly predicted outcome in 93% of patients in this study (87% sensitivity, 95% specificity). Autopsy findings in 16 of 19 infants with fatal EOGBS suggested that surfactant deficiency respiratory distress syndrome was common in preterm infants with EOGBS and contributed to their higher mortality compared with term infants.\r"

Among 255 symptomatic cases prevalence of positive culture was 29% and antigen test sensitivity was 55%. Among 100 asymptomatic controls prevalence of positive culture was 20% and antigen test sensitivity was 20%. Controls with positive cultures and cases with false negative antigen tests had significantly fewer colonies on culture than cases with true positive antigen tests (P less than 0.01). Symptoms and clinical findings were not associated with antigen test result or number of colonies on culture. Eighty percent of patients with positive cultures received treatment when the antigen test was used as an adjunct to culture, compared with a 57% treatment rate among the subgroup in whom follow-up treatment was attempted based on positive culture results alone (P less than 0.05). We conclude that: (1) the antigen test had lower sensitivity in routine clinical use than previously reported; (2) the high rate of false negative tests may result, in part, from a high proportion of specimens with low colony counts; and (3) the availability of the antigen test as an adjunct to culture significantly increased treatment rates.\r"

The major stated indications for computed tomography were fever (8 patients), seizures (4 patients), signs of increased intracranial pressure (4 patients), focal neurologic dysfunction (3 patients) and recurrent meningitis (2 patients). Abnormal findings were demonstrated by computed tomography in 20 of 25 patients but in 8 patients consisted solely of nonspecific dilatation of spaces containing cerebrospinal fluid or of basilar enhancement. The yield of information that was useful either diagnostically or therapeutically was low; positive findings of obvious clinical relevance were present in only 2 cases. Computed tomography provides an accurate means of diagnosing intracranial complications of bacterial meningitis. It must be used conservatively, however, to limit expense and radiation exposure and enhance the yield of potentially relevant information. Computed tomography is indicated for children with persistent neurologic dysfunction, persistently positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures or recurrent meningitis, whereas it is of little value for children with prolonged fever alone.\r"

Forty male subjects (20 symptomatic, 20 asymptomatic) were allocated into four equal groups. Two treatment groups were given spinal manipulative therapy, and two groups underwent a sham procedure. Blood samples were taken via indwelling butterfly needles pre- and postintervention in all four groups, and levels of immunoreactive ACTH, immunoreactive beta-endorphin, and cortisol determined by radioimmunoassay. No differences in ACTH or beta-endorphin were found between sham and treated groups, or between pre- and postintervention in any group; cortisol levels fell over the course of the study in all groups. The findings thus appear to exclude a humoral role for beta-endorphin in mediating the analgesic response to spinal manipulative therapy; in addition, they suggest that such therapy is not a stressor that activates the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis.\r"

Although this new therapeutic modality offers hope for the future, at present, a multitude of toxicities limit the total dose and duration of therapy. Among the toxic side effects a purported third space or vascular leak syndrome is the most serious. In this review, we detail the evidence for a third space syndrome (peripheral edema, ascites, oliguria, elevated serum creatinine levels) and cardiopulmonary dysfunction (hypotension, respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, hypoxemia) with adoptive immunotherapy in human and animal studies. We conclude that IL-2 administration is associated with increased pulmonary microvascular permeability, infiltration of the lung parenchyma with large esterase negative lymphoid cells, hypoxemia, systemic hypotension, positive fluid balance and, in animals, transient pulmonary hypertension. These abnormalities do not seem to be caused by IL-2 directly; the causes may be mediated by IL-2 activated lymphocytes or other IL-2 activated cellular mediators.\r"

  ".W": "1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25-(OH)2D) plays a crucial role in the maintenance of blood calcium and phosphorus levels and in normal skeletal mineralization. The concentration of this metabolite in the blood is, by necessity, tightly regulated. The most important stimuli for renal 1,25-(OH)2D synthesis include parathyroid hormone (PTH), its second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and phosphate deprivation. Hypocalcemia and calcitonin, initially thought to act via stimulation of PTH release, have now been shown to directly stimulate 1-hydroxylation. Estrogens also increase 1,25-(OH)2D production, probably by upregulating renal PTH receptors. Inhibitors of the renal 25-(OH)D 1 alpha-hydroxylase include 1,25-(OH)2D itself, hypercalcemia, and phosphate loading. The PTH-vitamin D axis as modulated by the serum ionized calcium level controls adaptation to alterations in dietary calcium and sodium intake and to changes in skeletal turnover based on the level of physical activity. Although normally the renal production of 1,25-(OH)2D is tightly regulated and changes little in response to vitamin D challenge, there are certain conditions in which 1,25-(OH)2D appears to be substrate-dependent. These include hypoparathyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, sarcoidosis and the anephric state, conditions in which PTH is not well-modulated by alterations in serum ionized calcium or in which extrarenal synthesis of 1,25-(OH)2D occurs. In several disorders, including absorptive hypercalciuria, pseudohypoparathyroidism, hypophosphatemic rickets, and tumoral calcinosis, the regulation of the renal 1 alpha-hydroxylase appears to be altered.\r"

In particular, it has been proposed that it may be more effective than conventional measures such as medication and conventional physical therapy in the treatment of myofascial pain syndromes (fibrositis, fibromyalgia). The citations in the literature include only case reports. Sixty-two patients were treated by using acupuncture points. Two sessions of five treatments were given six weeks apart. A crossover double-blind technique was used in the treatments. The clinical responses were assessed using portions of the McGill Pain Questionnaire. No statistical difference between the treatment and the placebo groups could be determined.\r"

Physical measurements of muscle strength and range of motion are only weakly correlated with actual patient behavior or symptoms, so the behavior and symptoms must be measured directly. Commonly used physician ratings on ordinal scales are often highly subjective and fail to distinguish particular activities which may improve from those which do not. This paper briefly considers the pressures for improving functional status measurement, describes five criteria for assessing and comparing functional questionnaires, and selectively reviews some newer instruments using these criteria. These newer instruments offer standardization of measurement, comprehensiveness, and generally good reproducibility and validity. Unfortunately, little is known about the responsiveness of these measures to small but clinically important changes. There is a need in this field to define the optimal balance between brevity on the one hand and comprehensiveness on the other, to assess and improve instrument responsiveness, and to compare instruments \"head-to-head\" to allow rational selection for particular applications.\r"

  ".W": "A primary role for the kidney in the initiation and maintenance of hypertension has long been recognized, but the pathogenetic interactions among renal hemodynamics, hormonal and hereditary factors, and dietary sodium intake remain enigmatic. Reduction in filtration surface area, whether acquired in the course of intrinsic renal disease or after surgical renal ablation, leads to systemic hypertension as well as to progressive renal insufficiency, sequellae made even more severe by dietary sodium excess. Moreover, hypertension and progressive renal disease eventuate in some individuals born with a solitary kidney, as well as in those with more severe degrees of dysgenesis (ie, oligomeganephronia). Hypertension is also commonly observed in certain inbred rat strains in which filtration surface area is congenitally deficient. Based on these and other lines of evidence reviewed herein, we postulate that a renal abnormality that contributes to essential hypertension in the general population is a reduced number of nephrons. The consequences of this abnormality are limitations in the ability to excrete sodium and thus, salt-sensitive hypertension. Finally, congenital variability in filtration surface area may explain why only some, but not all, patients exposed to potentially injurious renal stimuli eventually manifest chronic nephropathy. This may also account for the susceptibility of subsets of Type I and Type II diabetics to develop overt glomerulopathy.\r"

We report a 34-year old woman with moyamoya syndrome who presented with symptomatic severe hypertension associated with unilateral renal artery stenosis. The patient underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the right renal artery with subsequent improvement in blood pressure control on reduced, and later, no antihypertensive therapy. This case illustrates that moyamoya syndrome may be an intracranial manifestation of a systemic arterial disorder. Renal artery stenosis may, in appropriate cases, be managed by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty.\r"

  ".W": "Comparative effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) captopril and calcium entry blocker nifedipine on the split renal function were studied in six patients with renovascular hypertension (RVH) with unilateral stenosis (38 +/- 5 years). Both captopril and nifedipine showed potent antihypertensive effects; the mean arterial pressure was reduced from 131 +/- 16 to 105 +/- 8 mm Hg (P less than 0.001) by captopril, and from 128 +/- 15 to 109 +/- 11 mm Hg (P less than 0.001) by nifedipine. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the stenotic kidney was 24 +/- 6 mL/min, which decreased to 11 +/- 2 mL/min (P less than 0.01) during captopril administration, and only slightly decreased (18.8 +/- 5 mL/min) during nifedipine administration. The effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) increased in the nonstenotic kidneys in response to both drugs. These results show that angiotensin II rather than renal perfusion pressure may be important for maintaining GFR in the stenotic kidney, and further suggest that nifedipine may be used relatively safely in treating patients with RVH, although caution should be exercised in terms of their ability to preserve the renal function in individual kidneys.\r"

The three drugs were administered in a randomized change-over sequence for four-months each. The main variables associated with blood pressure regulation were measured in the basal condition and at the end of each treatment period. The erythrocyte Na transport systems were measured only in the basal condition and at the end of the first treatment period. The average blood pressure reduction was similar for each drug. Mean blood pressure levels after captopril correlated positively with those after atenolol in the individual patients (P less than 0.0001); mean blood pressure levels after canrenoate potassium, on the contrary, did not correlate with those after the other two drugs. Captopril and canrenoate potassium treatment reduced intraerythrocyte Na content (P less than 0.02), canrenoate potassium increased Na-K pump (P0.05), atenolol did not change any erythrocyte membrane Na transport parameters. The ouabain-resistant Na transport systems were not modified by any drug. The patients were divided in three groups according to their antihypertensive response: nonresponders (six patients), canrenoate potassium responders (nine patients) and captopril-atenolol responders (15 patients, equally responsive to both drugs). Nonresponders had the lowest basal Na pump (P less than 0.02). Canrenoate potassium responders had higher basal Na-K cotransport than captopril-atenolol responders (P less than 0.02). Atenolol-captopril responders had the highest basal plasma renin activity (PRA, P less than 0.02). The blood pressure reduction after atenolol correlated with the induced fall in PRA (P less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The mechanisms of these interactions were theoretically analyzed based on the arterial pressure-natriuresis relationship. Four-week studies were performed in 24 patients with essential hypertension who were given a regular sodium diet (12-15 g of NaCl/d) in the first and third weeks and a sodium-restricted diet (1-3 g/d) in the second and fourth weeks. One of three antihypertensive drugs, 60 mg/d of nicardipine (Ca-antagonist), 120 mg/d of propranolol (beta-blocker) or 150 mg/d of captopril (converting-enzyme inhibitor) was administered in the third and fourth weeks. The mean arterial pressure and urinary sodium excretion were measured on the last three days of each week. The degree of interaction between the antihypertensive drugs and sodium restriction was statistically compared. The hypotensive effect of nicardipine and propranolol did not differ with the change in sodium intake, whereas that of captopril was greater under sodium restriction than under the regular sodium diet. Urinary sodium excretion was plotted on the ordinate as a function of arterial pressure before and after administration of the antihypertensive drugs. The pressure-natriuresis curve was shifted left, without a change in the slope, by nicardipine and propranolol and also left, but with a decrease in the slope, by captopril. The hypotensive effect of nicardipine and propranolol, being independent of the amount of sodium intake, was based on the leftward shift of the pressure-natriuresis curve that was probably due to the decrease in renal vascular resistance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirty-two hypertensive patients with previous diuretic-induced hypokalemia, normal 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring, and normal exercise testing were treated with 100 mg hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) daily (Group 1) to induce hypokalemia or with a combination of HCTZ with amiloride (Group 2) to attempt to maintain plasma potassium levels in the normal range during diuretic therapy. Those Group 1 patients (Group 1A) with increased ventricular ectopic activity (VEA) during HCTZ therapy were subsequently potassium-repleted with amiloride and with supplemental potassium chloride to evaluate the effect of these treatments on VEA. One Group 1 patient died suddenly after 12 days of HCTZ therapy. Autopsy findings suggested an arrhythmic death. Six Group 1 patients who had increased VEA with HCTZ treatment had reductions in VEA with amiloride or supplemental potassium chloride. Group 2 patients did not have a significant increase in VEA. Thus, diuretic therapy appears to cause VEA primarily by electrolyte changes that are induced.\r"

A significant positive correlation was shown between calcium and plasma renin activity (P less than 0.001); an inverse correlation was found between systolic arterial tension and calcium (P less than 0.001). These findings indicate age-related physiological changes between the renin-aldosterone system, calcium, and systolic arterial tension. These changes are similar to those found previously in young adult hypertensives with low plasma renin activity levels, suggesting that the arterial tension of the elderly is labile, and that changes in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAA) and calcium levels directly influence the increase of systolic arterial tension, which is frequently found in the elderly.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) often have raised blood pressure but a simple cause-and-effect relationship has not been established. In 33 persons with probable primary HPT and mild hypercalcemia detected in a health survey, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was significantly higher than among age- and sex-matched, normocalcemic, controls (89.4 +/- 9.8 (SD) v 85.2 +/- 8.9 mm Hg; P less than 0.05). Among the hypercalcemic individuals, DBP was, in a multivariate analysis, inversely related to the serum calcium and plasma-ionized calcium concentrations and to the serum levels of parathyroid hormone. A prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blind, study evaluating the effects of active vitamin D, alphacalcidol, (1 microgram daily) was carried out in the hypercalcemic patients over a six-month period. This treatment caused a slight further increase (0.05 mmol/L) of both serum calcium and plasma-ionized calcium concentrations. At the same time there was a significant reduction of DBP with a mean of 6.7 mm Hg compared with placebo (P less than 0.05). The hypotensive action of the vitamin D compound was inversely related to the pretreatment serum levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 and additive to concomitant, unchanged, antihypertensive medications. The negative correlation between serum calcium and blood pressure is similar to that obtained in normocalcemic individuals and suggests that raised blood pressure, at least in the milder forms of primary HPT, is only independently associated with the disease. Active vitamin D, although it raises serum calcium, can lower blood pressure also in hypercalcemic patients as previously demonstrated in normocalcemic individuals.\r"

In low-renin essential hypertension, a higher [Ca2+]i is present not only in vascular smooth muscle cells of resistance vessels but also in juxtaglomerular cells and renal proximal tubular epithelium. A higher [Ca2+]i in juxtaglomerular cells retards renin secretion, whereas in renal proximal tubules it is associated with increased Na+ reabsorption via the Na+/H+ antiport. Thus, hyperactivity of the Na+/H+ antiport in renal tubular epithelium may be the cause of salt (NaCl) sensitivity. Ca2+ antagonists probably exert their antihypertensive effect by reducing [Ca2+]i in both vascular smooth muscle cells and renal tubular epithelium. These agents are, therefore, particularly effective in the treatment of essential hypertension in blacks and older individuals with the low-renin form of the disease, who are known to be salt sensitive.\r"

  ".W": "Hypertension-induced morbidity and mortality can be positively affected by antihypertensive treatment. This was first shown in malignant phase hypertension and it is now clearly established that not only total mortality but also morbidity from stroke, left ventricular failure, and progressive renal failure can be positively affected by pharmacological lowering of arterial pressure. Benefits of treatment for coronary artery disease are less obvious. In spite of the positive effects of antihypertensive therapy briefly mentioned here, recent data from several centers show that hypertension-induced risks in treated hypertensive patients are not reduced down to the level seen in comparable normotensive subjects. There could be several reasons for this. Some of the hypertension-induced cardiovascular changes are irreversible, or that antihypertensive pharmacological agents may have some adverse effects that would partially offset the advantages obtained through a reduction in blood pressure, or that treated arterial blood pressure usually has not been brought down to strictly normotensive levels. Therefore, the risks associated with hypertension have not been lowered to those seen in normotensive subjects. This latter point assumes particular significance in view of some recent suggestions that a too drastic lowering of blood pressure in hypertensive subjects may be associated with an increased risk, particularly for coronary artery disease mortality.\r"

  ".W": "The large clinical trials of the treatment of hypertension, in which diuretics were used as initial drug therapy, have demonstrated a major reduction in stroke but little benefit in the incidence of coronary heart disease. The limited effect of treatment on coronary disease is surprising given the strong risk factor relationship to pre-existing hypertension. This may mean that the risk factor relationship is not a causal one. Alternatively, the drug therapy may have subtle toxicity that in the long term offsets the benefit of lowering blood pressure. This review explores the latter possibility by reviewing the evidence that the antihypertensive drugs used preferentially heretofore have adverse effects on the lipid profile. Diuretics increase triglycerides (average of 30%), total cholesterol (average of 6-8%), and LDL or VLDL cholesterol. beta-1 selective and nonselective beta-blockers increase triglycerides (average of 30%) and lower HDL cholesterol (average of 5-15%). Whereas the adverse modifications of the lipid profile appear small and inconsequential, the increase in total cholesterol during diuretic therapy is of the same magnitude as observed in the Lipid Research Clinic trial (although opposite in direction) that significantly affected coronary events. The persistence of the lipid changes during long-term treatment is unresolved due to fragmentary and poorly controlled observations. Nevertheless, considerable data suggest that it continues during extended therapy. Selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor blocking drugs and perhaps calcium antagonists and beta-blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity have a favorable influence on the lipid profile.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) is associated with a disorder of T-lymphocyte function, and an enhanced production of a vasoactive lymphokine, the vascular permeability factor (VPF). In an attempt to evaluate lymphocyte activation in various phases of INS, we measured beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2m) levels in lymphocyte culture supernatants (LCS). In 23 cases of untreated active INS, beta 2m levels in unstimulated LCS were significantly increased in comparison with those of 13 cases of untreated INS in complete remission (p less than 0.001), of 17 cases of active membranous nephropathy (p less than 0.01) and of 14 controls (p less than 0.001). In 13 patients treated with cyclosporine (Cs) (3-4.5 mg/kg/d) during 3 months, beta 2m levels were within the normal range. Although the beta 2m of 7 Cs patients without proteinuria was lower than 5 Cs patients with residual proteinuria, the difference was not statistically significant. In 15 prednisone(Pr)-treated INS patients, beta 2m levels were normalized. However their beta 2m levels were lower in 8 cases of complete remission than in 7 cases of persistent proteinuria (p less than 0.05). Concanavalin-A stimulation increased beta 2m amounts in all groups with a similar magnitude. In vitro addition of Cs (100 ng/ml) inhibited both beta 2m and VPF elevations observed in active INS. beta 2m level and VPF activity were significantly correlated (r = 0.54, p less than 0.01). High levels of beta 2m in LCS from INS are the consequence of an enhanced cellular synthesis and they are inhibited by Pr and Cs. Thus beta 2m increase in INS indeed reflects lymphocyte activation.\r"

In 8 patients of the autopsy group a CMV infection of the kidney was detected (CMV cells in 3 cases, positive viral tissue culture in 4 cases, positive in-situ hybridization in one case), which was associated with severe dissemination into different organs. In situ hybridization was not superior to ordinary light microscopy in the detection of CMV cells. The biopsies were screened for the presence of glomerulopathy. No association of glomerulopathy with CMV could be found by light microscopy, whereas a significant correlation of glomerulopathy with vascular rejection was demonstrated. No differences as to the incidence of glomerulopathy were found, when non-transplant patients with manifest CMV infection at autopsy were compared with matched controls. With active infection electron microscopy revealed no osmiophilic deposits, but in immunofluorescence tiny IgG deposits were identified within the glomeruli (p less than 0.01). IgM or C3 deposition in the glomeruli was not specifically associated with either CMV infection or vascular rejection. Thus morphological identification of CMV infection of the kidney is difficult, necessitating the detection of CMV cells, positive viral tissue culture or positive in-situ hybridization. Glomerulopathy in light microscopy is associated with vascular rejection and is therefore termed transplant glomerulitis. Tiny IgG deposits may be indicative of CMV infection, although these are not always present.\r"

  ".W": "The morphology of kidneys from heart (n = 55) and bone marrow (n = 112) transplant recipients treated either with cyclosporine (CSA) or conventional immunosuppression was investigated at autopsy. The major findings were: In the bone marrow transplant recipients glomerular collapse, tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, striped form, CSA-associated arteriolopathy and thrombi in glomeruli and/or arterioles were more often found in the CSA group as compared to conventional immunosuppression. In the heart transplant recipients glomerular collapse and obsolescence, tubular atrophy and intimal fibrosis in arteries were more frequent in the CSA group. Vascular interstitial toxicity known to be associated with CSA treatment from renal transplant patients was found in 54% (25% severe) of the bone marrow and 19.5% (9.7% severe) of the the heart transplant recipients. The prevalence of vascular interstitial toxicity in bone marrow versus heart transplant recipients is possibly due to higher CSA dosage and pretreatment with cytostatic drugs and irradiation. Analyses of the lesions from early stages to the full picture of vascular interstitial toxicity suggests that CSA causes a form of thrombotic microangiopathy with focal glomerular and/or arteriolar thrombosis followed by typical CSA-associated arteriolopathy which results in interstitial fibrosis with tubular atrophy.\r"

Controversy exists over whether calcium can alleviate or exacerbate the hypertensive process, and diversity of calcium metabolism in hypertensive patients has been proposed. Calcium-channel blocking agents are potent vasodilators capable of correcting the elevated systemic vascular resistance. Clinical studies have shown that these drugs have antihypertensive efficacy comparable to established agents. The elderly, blacks, and patients with low renin activity respond well to calcium-channel blockers. These drugs may also offer potential advantages over established antihypertensive agents in patients with other coexisting diseases. Sustained release formulations have been developed, and initial experience with long-term efficacy and tolerability is encouraging. The calcium-channel blockers may become first-line therapy for treatment of hypertension in selected patients.\r"

Since this guideline at times may be clinically impractical, this study was designed to examine use of peripheral vein infusions of high concentration KCl therapy. Tolerance to KCl 20 mEq/65 ml iv with and without lidocaine 50 mg was evaluated in 18 hypokalemic subjects in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Subjective and objective assessments of adverse effects were determined throughout the infusion period. Pain was assessed by both verbal descriptor and visual analog scales and correlated significantly following infusion of KCl with or without lidocaine. Multivariant analysis demonstrated differences in pain perception between solutions, with significantly less pain following KCl with lidocaine versus KCl infusions. Transient adverse effects occurred in both groups, but the incidence was not statistically different. Use of concentrated iv KCl infusions may benefit hypokalemic patients with hypervolemia and/or severe potassium deficits. Addition of lidocaine clearly improves patient tolerance to intravenous KCl replacement.\r"

To validate this principle, we studied 38 elderly males (aged greater than or equal to 65 years) with mild to moderate hypertension, comparing hemodynamic responses to and subjective impressions of enalapril or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). After gradual withdrawal of existing antihypertensive therapy and a four-week, single-blind placebo period, each patient was randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive either enalapril 10-20 mg/d or HCTZ 12.5-25 mg/d for two to four weeks. Combination therapy with both agents was employed if either alone failed to reduce seated diastolic BP to less than or equal to 90 mm Hg. Equivalent proportions of patients receiving enalapril or HCTZ (8 of 19 and 10 of 19, respectively; p = ns) responded with significant reductions in systolic and diastolic BP in seated and standing positions. Combination therapy was most effective in patients receiving HCTZ prior to enalapril. In patients receiving enalapril before HCTZ, BP changes were minimal. No adverse effects were observed in the enalapril group but occurred in an equivalent fraction of patients in the other groups (4 of 10 HCTZ alone, 6 of 20 enalapril + HCTZ; p = ns). We conclude that enalapril may be considered a reasonable monotherapeutic antihypertensive agent in some elderly patients. Combination with HCTZ is beneficial in patients who fail to respond adequately to HCTZ alone.\r"

He had been receiving cyclosporine along with azathioprine and prednisone for immunosuppression since the transplant. His cyclosporine blood concentrations and renal function were stable during this time. Due to uncontrolled hypertension, sustained-release (SR) verapamil 240 mg/d was added with no change in cyclosporine levels. However, after increasing the dose of verapamil SR to 360 mg/d a dramatic increase in cyclosporine concentrations occurred. His renal function remained stable during this time.

Most available studies, however, have not compared these drugs in a controlled and blind manner, and the data have often been collected retrospectively. In addition, the degree and duration of sedation required may depend on the procedure. Thus, it is difficult to recommend the drug of choice for producing sedation. Serious cardiac and respiratory effects and excessive sedation have been associated with these drugs, even when normal doses were used. Controlled studies and specific guidelines are needed for optimal use and monitoring of these drugs in pediatric patients.\r"

Diaphragmatic shortening (percent change from initial length at functional residual capacity, %LFRC) and transdiaphragmatic pressure swings (delta Pdi) were compared with control values over a range of positive-pressure breathing that produced a maximum increase in lung volume to 40% of inspiratory capacity. There was no change in the electromyogram of the diaphragm or parasternal intercostals during positive-pressure breathing. delta Pdi and tidal volume (VT) fell to 52 +/- 3.3 and 42.5 +/- 5% (SE) of control. This was associated with a reduction in the initial resting length of 13 +/- 1.9 and 21 +/- 2.2%LFRC (SE) in the costal and crural diaphragms, respectively. Tidal diaphragmatic shortening, however, decreased to 66 +/- 7 and 57 +/- 7 and the mean velocity decreased to 78 +/- 10 and 63 +/- 8% (SE) of control for the costal and crural diaphragms, respectively. We conclude that the reduction in diaphragmatic shortening is the main determinant of the reduced delta Pdi and VT during lung inflation and relate this to what is currently known about diaphragmatic contractile properties.\r"

This study used two variations of a glucose tolerance test (GTT) to investigate changes in carbohydrate metabolism in healthy males during nude exposure to cold. In experiment 1, an oral GTT was performed in the cold and in the warm (3 h at 10 or 29 degrees C). To bypass the gastrointestinal tract, and to suppress hepatic glucose output, a second experiment was carried out as described above, using an intravenous GTT. Even though cold exposure raised metabolic rate greater than 2.5 times, plasma glucose and insulin responses to an oral GTT remained unaltered. In contrast, cold exposure reduced the entire plasma glucose profile as a function of time during the intravenous GTT (P less than 0.05), as plasma glucose was returned to basal levels within 1 h in comparison to a full 2 h in the warm, despite low insulin levels. The results of the intravenous GTT demonstrate that even with low insulin levels, carbohydrate metabolism is increased in cold-exposed males. This effect could be masked in the oral GTT by gastrointestinal factors and a high hepatic glucose output. Cold exposure may enhance insulin sensitivity and/or responsiveness for glucose uptake, mainly in shivering skeletal muscles.\r"

Acetylcholine, administered by pulmonary artery infusion, decreased pulmonary arterial pressure from 120 +/- 7 to 71 +/- 6 mmHg and total pulmonary resistance from 29.4 +/- 2.6 to 10.4 +/- 0.9 mmHg.l-1.min without changing systemic arterial pressure (90 +/- 5 mmHg). Although both sodium nitroprusside and PGI2 lowered pulmonary arterial pressure to 86 +/- 4 and 96 +/- 4 mmHg, respectively, they also decreased systemic arterial pressure to 65 +/- 4 and 74 +/- 3 mmHg, respectively. Neither sodium nitroprusside nor PGI2 was as effective as acetylcholine at lowering total pulmonary resistance (18.0 +/- 3.6 and 19.1 +/- 2.2 mmHg.l-1.min, respectively). Right-to-left cardiac shunt through the foramen ovale was decreased by acetylcholine from 1.6 +/- 0.4 to 0.1 +/- 0.2 l/min but was not changed by sodium nitroprusside or PGI2. Isolated lobar pulmonary arteries from pulmonary hypertensive calves did not relax in response to acetylcholine, whereas isolated pulmonary arteries from age-matched control calves did relax in response to acetylcholine. Control and pulmonary hypertensive lobar pulmonary arteries relaxed equally well in response to sodium nitroprusside. We concluded that acetylcholine vasodilation was impaired in vitro in isolated lobar pulmonary arteries but was enhanced in vivo in resistance pulmonary arteries in neonatal calves with pulmonary hypertension.\r"

We first present an analysis of the relationship between PL and the transmural pressure (Ptm) that airway smooth muscle must generate to close the airways. This analysis predicts that airway closure can occur at PL less than or equal to 10 cmH2O with maximal airway stimulation. We tested this prediction in eight excised canine lobes by nebulizing 50% methacholine into the airways while the lobe was held at constant PL values ranging from 25 to 5 cmH2O. Airway closure was assessed by comparing changes in alveolar pressure (measured by an alveolar capsule technique) and pressure at the airway opening during low-amplitude oscillations in lobar volume. Airway closure occurred in two of the eight lobes at PL = 10 cmH2O; in an additional five it occurred at PL = 7.5 cmH2O. We conclude that the forces of parenchymal interdependence per se are not sufficient to prevent airway closure at PL less than or equal to 7.5 cmH2O in excised canine lobes.\r"

Each subject performed four pairs of runs matched for tidal volume, breathing frequency, flow rates, lung volume, pressure-time product, and work rate. Basal O2 uptake, measured before and after pairs of loaded runs, was subtracted from that measured during resistive breathing to obtain VO2 resp. For an equivalent load, the VO2 resp during ERL (184 +/- 17 ml O2/min) was nearly twice that obtained during IRL (97 +/- 9 ml O2/min). This twofold difference in efficiency between inspiratory and expiratory resistive breathing may reflect the relatively lower mechanical advantage of the expiratory muscles in overcoming respiratory loads. Variable recruitment of expiratory muscles may explain the large variation of results obtained in studies of respiratory muscle efficiency in normal subjects.\r"

VIP (10(-10) to 10(-6) M) produced a dose-dependent increase in [3H]glycoconjugate release of up to 300% of controls, which was inhibited by VIP antiserum and not inhibited by atropine, propranolol, or phentolamine. VIP at a low concentration (10(-9) M), which did not produce any significant increases over controls, produced a 2.4- to 5-fold augmentation of the glycoconjugate release induced by 10(-9) to 10(-7) M methacholine (MCh). Atropine or VIP antiserum abolished the augmentation. VIP did not produce any alteration in isoproterenol- or phenylephrine-evoked glycoconjugate secretion. VIP (up to 10(-5) M) did not produce any alteration in the tension, even when the gland had contracted with MCh, or any augmentation of contraction induced by MCh (10(-9) to 10(-7) M). These results indicate that VIP induces mucus glycoprotein release from secretory cells and also that it potentiates the secretion induced by cholinergic stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "Indicator dilution technique was used to study effects of reduced vascular volume or acute injury on removal of low doses of [3H]propranolol and [14C]serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) by perfused rabbit lung. Glass-bead (500 micron) embolization doubled pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) at flow rates of 20, 50, and 100 ml/min, decreased volume of distribution by approximately 50%, and increased pulmonary vascular resistance by at least 60%. Before embolization, (flow rate 20 ml/min) removal of [3H]propranolol and [14C] 5-HT was 89 +/- 2 and 75 +/- 5%, respectively, and was unaltered by changes in flow rate. However, after embolization, [3H]propranolol and [14C]5-HT removal decreased in a flow-dependent manner, reaching 28 +/- 4 and 1 +/- 3% (P less than 0.05), respectively, at a flow rate of 100 ml/min. When phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, 200 nM) was perfused (50 ml/min) through the lungs for 15 min, Ppa increased from 13 +/- 1 to 25 +/- 2 cmH2O (P less than 0.05), whereas [3H]propranolol removal decreased from 92 +/- 1 to 75 +/- 5% (P less than 0.05) and [14C]5-HT removal decreased from 73 +/- 3 to 46 +/- 8% (P less than 0.05). The PMA also caused vasoconstriction, which could be partially blocked by adding papaverine (500 microM) to the perfusion medium. Under the latter conditions, Ppa increased to 19 +/- 1 cmH2O and [3H]propranolol removal was unaffected. However, the combination of PMA and papaverine reduced [14C]5-HT removal from 64 +/- 4 to 19 +/- 3%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The maximal effect induced by methacholine (MCh) aerosols on pulmonary resistance (RL), and the effects of altering lung volume and O3 exposure on these induced changes in RL, was studied in five anesthetized and paralyzed dogs. RL was measured at functional residual capacity (FRC), and lung volumes above and below FRC, after exposure to MCh aerosols generated from solutions of 0.1-300 mg MCh/ml. The relative site of response was examined by magnifying parenchymal [RL with large tidal volume (VT) at fast frequency (RLLS)] or airway effects [RL with small VT at fast frequency (RLSF)]. Measurements were performed on dogs before and after 2 h of exposure to 3 ppm O3. MCh concentration-response curves for both RLLS and RLSF were sigmoid shaped. Alterations in mean lung volume did not alter RLLS; however, RLSF was larger below FRC than at higher lung volumes. Although O3 exposure resulted in small leftward shifts of the concentration-response curve for RLLS, the airway dominated index of RL (RLSF) was not altered by O3 exposure, nor was the maximal response using either index of RL. These data suggest O3 exposure does not affect MCh responses in conducting airways; rather, it affects responses of peripheral contractile elements to MCh, without changing their maximal response.\r"

Ancrod, a defibrinating enzyme, was given to 10 patients with SAE in an attempt to reduce plasma fibrinogen, which would thus normalise hyperviscosity. This was paralleled by a significant improvement of the initially abnormal retinal arteriovenous passage time, as well as a significant augmentation of the CO2-induced cerebral vasomotor response. This did not lead, however, to any clinical improvement with respect to performance of neuropsychological tests, recurrences of strokes during a 6 month observation period or improvement of various audiological parameters. The findings indicate that hyperviscosity in patients with SAE is merely an epiphenomenon. A potentially reversible, chronic penumbral state of the brain tissue apparently does not exist in SAE.\r"

The most common neurological complication (14% of AIDS patients) is human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) encephalopathy, but opportunistic viral and nonviral infections and neoplasms are also quite common; the most frequent among these are cryptococcal meningitis, toxoplasmosis, primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and herpesvirus infections. Most of the nonviral infections and neoplasms are potentially treatable. Neurological syndromes include diffuse and regional encephalopathies, myelopathy, meningitis, intraaxial cranial neuropathies, and retinopathy. About 10% of AIDS patients develop a CNS mass lesion; the chief causes of these lesions are toxoplasmosis and primary CNS lymphoma. Since the clinical profiles of the various diseases overlap to a great extent, differential diagnosis requires a thorough workup, including magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography brain scanning, examination of the cerebrospinal fluid, and, frequently, brain biopsy. Because AIDS patients have a high incidence of multiple intracranial pathologies, the diagnostic workup may have to be repeated to identify all of the diseases present.\r"

There were no significant differences in median survival, frequency of development of opportunistic infections, median T4-cell counts, or serum p24 antigen levels during therapy among the three groups. There was a significant increase in weight in the 3-million-unit group compared with 36-million-unit and placebo groups. Adverse reactions were common in the two interferon groups, but did not differ significantly from the placebo group. Neither significant therapeutic benefit nor adverse reaction was demonstrated in this study to be associated with interferon-alpha administration. This study underlines the value of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies to address specific issues of drug efficacy and toxicity.\r"

  ".W": "Some of the major features of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome may be understood in terms of the characteristics of the virus. Life-long infection is a consequence of the life cycle of retroviruses, the formation of stably integrated viral genetic information into host-cell DNA. The silent infection, controlled replication, and profile replication may be understood in terms of the interactions of the positive and negative regulatory genes that control virus growth. Selective infectivity and selective cytotoxicity of HIV-1 are primarily the consequences  of the properties of the envelope glycoprotein and its interactions with the surface CD4 molecule. The ability of HIV-1 to enter a state of prolific replication in the presence of an antiviral immune response is largely attributed to the design of the outside of the virus. The functional domains of the envelope glycoprotein are not accessible to the immune system and other regions appear to be covered by a dense cloud of sugar molecules. Concealment of the virus by regulated growth, by budding to the interior surfaces of macrophages as well as concealment by a sugar coating, may help to explain the failure to protect chimpanzees from infection by candidate vaccines. Rapid medical prophylaxis is required in populations that currently experience high incidence of HIV-1 infection. Chemoprevention, the use of chemicals to prevent establishment of viral infection, in addition to vaccination should be investigated as means to control the AIDS epidemic.\r"

For the HIV reverse transcriptase, this has been demonstrated by the clinical effect of zidovudine, but less toxic drugs are needed. The HIV protease is another viral enzyme against which inhibitors are likely to be developed. As the function and structure of HIV proteins are understood in more detail, it will become possible to construct more selective inhibitors. It is necessary to evaluate new HIV inhibitors in animal models to facilitate the rapid selection of suitable compounds and combinations for further clinical evaluation. It appears likely that several drugs preventing HIV replication will be required, and that these will appear during the next few years, but it is also apparent that the elimination of HIV from a patient remains a remote possibility.\r"

Sera obtained from 6915 Japanese blood donors were assayed for anti-HTLV-I antibody by PA, and 389 (5.6%) were positive. These 389 sera were re-examined by IF-FA, and 29 (7.5%) were negative. Sufficient material was present for 20 of the 29 PA-positive/IF-FA-negative sera for further evaluation by the IF-MA, EIA, RIP, and WB. Fifteen (75%) of the 20 were positive by IF-MA, but only 6 (30%) were positive by EIA. Both RIP and WB confirmed 17 (85%) of the samples, with each detecting a serum that was negative by the other. Thus, 18 (90%) of the 20 were confirmed by either RIP or WB. The nonconfirmed sera were all positive on PA at low titer. These findings suggest that the PA assay is more sensitive than either IF-FA or EIA.\r"

Sixty-two percent of seroconverters meeting these criteria experienced a shift in one or more of their successive CD4+ interval slopes, the majority (56%) from a level slope to a negative slope (decreasing numbers of CD4+ cells), a significantly greater proportion than that observed among seronegatives (30%, p less than 0.0001). Fifty-eight percent of the seropositives maintained level interval slopes over the 3 years of follow-up. The majority (59%) of those men experiencing a shift went from a level to a negative interval slope, a significantly greater proportion than observed among seronegatives (30%, p less than 0.0001). The observed patterns of change in interval slopes are consistent with the laboratory observation that CD4+ cells must be activated to replicate HIV-1. The use of the interval slope strategy provides a method to identify a temporal focal point at which to examine possible codeterminants that trigger the production of HIV-1 and the subsequent decline in CD4+ cells.\r"

To identify predictors of the rate of decline of CD4 T-lymphocytes, we used an autoregressive model that relates CD4 counts to predictor variables, while adjusting for previous CD4 counts. Significant predictors of steeper decline of CD4 counts were high CD8 count, low hemoglobin, low platelets, high serum IgA, high cytomegalovirus (CMV) antibody, and low HIV antibody. Using the fitted model, a subject with an initial deficit of 314 CD4 cells (median value of study sample) with respect to seronegative subjects and with average values in all other predictors is estimated to lose approximately 53 cells in a 6 month period (95% C.I. = 45-61 cells). Contrasting this estimate to the one obtained with similar methods in intravenous drug users, it is suggested that a faster rate of decline is present among i.v. drug users. This analysis provides evidence that several covariates in addition to previous number of CD4 counts have significant predictive power for estimating the decline in CD4 counts in HIV seropositive subjects.\r"

Research in animal behavioral genetics and human genetics has revealed substantial genetic predispositions for some cases of alcoholism. Studies of neurotransmitters suggest that some alcoholics may have antecedent deficiencies in one or more important neurochemical systems. Cocaine dependence is considered to be related to biphasic change in dopaminergic neurons and receptor systems. Condensation products such as salsolinol, tetrahydropapaveroline, and beta carbolines can alter alcoholic preference and motivate heavy ethanol consumption in animals. However, hypothesized theoretical mechanisms underlying such increased drinking with infusions of condensation products are unclear and may require revision. New pharmacological treatments stemming from advances in neurobiological research have been applied successfully to treatment of withdrawal states, but none have been demonstrated to be appropriate for long-term maintenance of abstinence.\r"

This paper describes visualization techniques derived from Jungian principles, as a practical means for the recovery-oriented psychotherapist to foster a spiritual connection. They are also useful in work on the psychological and interpersonal issues that emerge as the client establishes abstinence and progresses from there. This approach does not require allegiance to any specific religious beliefs, but allows the client to build on an inner experience as a way to develop resources in recovery.\r"

For most of that time period the use of the vegetable oils, soybean and safflower, were the exclusive lipid source for these emulsions. Recently intravenous medium-chain triglycerides have been commercially available. This review will discuss several important new research developments coming from the laboratory which should prove to enhance the nutritional effectiveness as well as minimize the adverse effects of lipid emulsions. The use of medium-chain triglycerides either enterally or parenterally has shown them to be superior energy sources when compared to long-chain triglycerides. Under experimental conditions of burn injury, their support of certain aspects of protein metabolism is superior to that of the current emulsions. This may be due to their rapid and preferential oxidation and poor storage into adipose tissue, and increased thermogenesis which has been observed from either enteral or parenteral administration in humans. This increased metabolic rate is not accompanied by an increase in temperature. Lipid emulsions have been described as having many different effects on variable aspects of the immunologic system. Some of these could be considered to be beneficial or without harm, and others are considered potentially deleterious. We have focused on the effects of parenteral lipid emulsions, in animals as well as in humans, on the function of the reticuloendothelial system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Lipids can influence host immunity by altering eicosanoid metabolism and membrane structure and function. Further investigations are essential to answer questions regarding the levels and properties of various essential fatty acids in TPN lipid emulsions. Combining the features of LCT in the form of W-3 PUFA (fish oil) and MCT in the form of medium-chain triglyceride in a \"structured lipid\" may decrease infection and may improve survival rates by producing fewer inflammatory eicosanoids of the two- and four-series, and serving as a more \"efficient fuel.\" The introduction of W-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids into the TPN emulsions as well as into normal diets may provide an important therapeutic advance in the pathogenesis of disease. Such unique antiinflammatory properties of W-3 PUFA require intensive research.\r"

  ".U": "89111243\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of sepsis on lipid metabolism may be summarized as follows: The increased plasma catecholamine concentration stimulates adipose tissue FFA release. The increased FFA mobilization and plasma concentration results in an enhanced FFA uptake by the liver which promotes TGFA synthesis and output. Thus, triglyceride appearance rate also can be increased during hypermetabolic sepsis. In severe sepsis, the regulatory signals to increase FFA release from adipose tissue may be counterbalanced by blood flow limitations that inhibit FFA release, possibly due to the inadequate availability of the plasma carrier, albumin. Under such conditions, the arterial FFA concentration may be unchanged or decreased along with similar changes in the rate of peripheral FFA utilization. Triglyceride metabolism can also be altered during septic conditions in which plasma levels of cytokines are very high. Cytokines, notably TNF and IL-1, suppress synthesis of lipoprotein lipase which decreases the rate of TGFA clearance. Thus, hypertriglyceridemia can develop in the absence of elevated plasma FFA levels. The plasma concentration of cytokines necessary to inhibit LPL and how often this form of hypertriglyceridemia occurs in human sepsis are unknown at present. The sequence of events describing the influence of sepsis on carbohydrate metabolism is postulated to be the following: The presence of bacteria, or their products (eg, endotoxin) either directly or indirectly (via stimulating mononuclear phagocytes to release cytokines) activate the immune tissues. Glucose utilization by these tissues, which are predominantly glycolytic, is thereby stimulated resulting in increased lactate production. At the same time, glucose uptake by skeletal muscle and lactate release are also elevated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89111249\r", 
  ".W": "Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) and medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) have special physicochemical properties such as small molecular weight, small interfacial tension against water, and for the fatty acids, solubility in biological fluids. As a result the metabolic pathways followed by these fats in an organism are different and simpler, or identical but more rapid, than those followed by long-chain triglycerides (LCTs) and long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs). Consequently the MCTs have found numerous applications in oral or enteral nutrition and, more recently, in parenteral nutrition. The infusion of conventional fat emulsions in stress and sepsis is still controversial. A main question is whether an MCT supply can be beneficial for these patients. In this review, we will discuss different aspects of modified lipid and protein metabolism: exchanges between exogenous fat particles and lipoproteins; exogenous fat clearance, storage, and oxidation; reticuloendothelial system function; nitrogen balance; and hepatic function. For each of these perturbations, the MCT/LCT and structured lipid emulsions are theoretically capable to provide an appropriate solution. The efficiency of these emulsions has been demonstrated experimentally on animal models of stress and sepsis. However, the value of MCT-based fat emulsions for these pathological states has still to be ascertained by clinical studies.\r"

The availability of implantable drug infusion pumps and stereotactic catheter placement techniques may overcome many of these problems. The problems of drug delivery to the brain and the present and potential uses of implantable drug pumps for neurological disease are discussed. In addition, the relationship between CNS drug infusion and neural tissue transplantation is briefly reviewed.\r"

The literature contains 14 instances of various vascular malformations associated with primary brain tumors, 5 of which were diagnosed as oligodendrogliomas. It is possible, however, that some of the cases reported in the literature constitute oligodendroglial abnormality similar to that observed in our cases rather than genuine oligodendrogliomas. Attention is drawn to this interesting and prognostically important phenomenon.\r"

Amoxicillin has also been shown to be effective for treatment of some children with otitis media with effusion (\"secretory\" otitis media) and is the recommended prophylactic antimicrobial agent for prevention of frequently recurrent acute otitis media. However, during the past decade there has been an increasing rate of bacteria that are resistant to amoxicillin, primarily beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis. Because of the emergence of these bacteria, other antimicrobial agents both old and new have been advocated for treatment and prevention of otitis media; amoxicillin-clavulanate and cefuroxime axetil are the newer agents. These agents are indicated for selected infants and children but for most patients amoxicillin remains a safe and relatively inexpensive effective \"old friend\".\r"

Factors determined to be highly suggestive of the presence of a congenital perilymphatic fistula as the cause of sensorineural hearing loss or vertigo, or both, include the following: mixed conductive and sensorineural hearing loss; antecedent sudden physical exertion or barotrauma; congenital deformities of the external ear and head; and abnormal findings on computed tomograms of the temporal bone, especially Mondini-like ear dysplasias. In a series of 37 children who had a congenital perilymphatic fistula treated at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, 28 (76%) had had documented otitis media in the past or a history of middle ear disease. This finding should alert the clinician to the possibility of the presence of a congenital perilymphatic fistula when sensorineural hearing loss develops or progresses during an episode of otitis media. Perilymphatic fistula is caused by either congenital ossicular deformities or abnormalities of the labyrinthine windows or coexistence of both conditions. The likelihood of there being no further deterioration in hearing after surgical repair of a perilymphatic fistula is high. Every infant and child with unexplained hearing loss or disequilibrium or both deserves an attempt to uncover the cause at the earliest possible age.\r"

However, the panelists made a plea that each child should be individualized on the basis of the duration of the effusion, the child's response to medication, the time of the year, distance from health care providers and other factors. Dr. Gates stressed that hearing loss was an important factor, but if hearing loss is a deciding factor, then serial audiograms or at least some assessment of hearing in the clinician's office should be performed. He also stated that there is now evidence that adenoidectomy is effective in certain children, but there is still an 80% recurrence rate and a 15% rate of failure in which children require repeat surgery. Dr. Bluestone suggested that parents and the child (if old enough) should be informed of what is known about the risks, costs and benefits of these surgical procedures. He recommended the clinician discuss with the parents the pros and cons of performing or not performing surgery, including the complications and sequelae of otitis media and also of tube insertion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
