  ".W": "A broad and diffuse neuronal network conveys information reflecting the state of the internal and external environment to the neurosecretory hypothalamus. Recently, we identified an inhibin-beta A- (I beta A) immunoreactive terminal field within the CRF-rich portion of the dorsomedial paraventricular nucleus which originates from a cell group in the commissural portion of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). The NTS receives baroreceptor input, somatosensory input via the spinosolitary tract, and sensory information from the oral, thoracic, and abdominal cavities and, thus, is positioned to serve as a primary relay for visceral sensory inputs to neurons critical to the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Although these NTS cells contain multiple putative transmitters, we present evidence that activin, an inhibin-beta A dimer, plays a modulatory role in HPA axis function via facilitation of CRF release. First, intraventricular injection of activin-A (0-3 nmol), but not the related inhibin heterodimer, evoked dose-related 1.7- to 2.8-fold elevations of circulating ACTH levels in male rats. Second, analysis of hypophysial-portal plasma after bilateral paraventricular nucleus microinfusion of activin-A revealed a dose-related facilitation of CRF secretion up to 4-fold above preinjection levels which was unaccompanied by changes in arginine vasopressin levels. Finally, activin-A also enhanced CRF secretion from neonatal hypothalamic cells in primary culture with an EC50 dose of approximately 0.25 nM. Overall, these observations provide evidence of both an anatomical and a pharmacological substrate for activin-mediated central modulation of HPA axis function.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a 48-h glucose (30% wt/vol) infusion in unrestrained catheterized healthy rats (HG) on subsequent in vivo and in vitro insulin response to glucose. High hyperglycemia (400-450 mg/dl) and resulting hyperinsulinemia (1.2 +/- 0.1 mU/ml vs. 0.15 +/- 0.03 mU/ml in controls) were maintained throughout the infusion period. Glucose-induced insulin secretion was examined in vivo 3 h after the end of infusion by performing either a glucose tolerance test or a hyperglycemic clamp (225 mg/dl for 60 min). In addition, in vivo insulin secretion was studied on day 1, 3, 5, and 7 after the end of glucose infusion by performing glucose tolerance tests. Insulin secretion was also investigated in vitro, using the isolated perfused pancreas technique, 3 h and 1 day post glucose infusion. During glucose tolerance tests and hyperglycemic clamps performed at 3 h, insulin secretion was much greater in HG rats than in controls, and remained increased until day 5. By contrast, when studied in vitro 3 h after the end of the infusion, glucose-induced insulin release from isolated perfused pancreases was impaired in HG rats as compared with controls, and the insulin response to arginine was dramatically increased. However, insulin secretion in vitro returned partially to normal after day 1. These data indicate that prolonged hyperglycemia has quite different effects on the subsequent insulin secretion in vivo or in vitro. It impairs, but reversibly, glucose-induced insulin secretion in vitro, whereas it increases it durably in vivo. This suggests that humoral and/or nervous interferences can counterbalance the possible perturbing effects of prolonged hyperglycemia on the normal B cell responsiveness to glucose.\r"

As examined by an immunoblot technique, the zona glomerulosa mitochondria from rats fed on a low Na-normal K diet (8.6 mmol Na+ and 207 mmol K+/kg of diet) or a low Na-high K (0.2 M KCl in drinking water) diet for 4-10 days contained significantly higher amounts of aldosterone synthase cytochrome P-450 than those from rats fed on a normal diet (86 mmol Na+ and 207 mmol K+/kg of diet). Activities of the enzyme were also found to increase by about 10-fold on day 10. In concert with these changes, both plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentration increased, indicating that the renin-angiotensin system was activated in these rats. Feeding with a normal Na-high K diet also induced significantly higher levels of both amount and activity of aldosterone synthase cytochrome P-450 together with an elevated serum K concentration on day 4, though they all decreased to near the control level on the following days. On the other hand, when enalapril malate, an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor, was administered to the low Na-normal K rats, the increases in the amount and activity of the enzyme as well as in plasma aldosterone concentration were suppressed altogether. However, the enalapril administration to the low Na-high K rats suppressed the increases only partially. These results indicate that the aldosterone synthase cytochrome P-450 is an ultimate target of the regulation of aldosterone biosynthesis by angiotensin II and K.\r"

To investigate the role of TSH in protein synthesis in the thyroid, we examined the effect of TSH on ribosomal P-protein biogenesis in FRTL cells. First, we investigated the influence of TSH on P0-protein gene expression. RNA slot blot hybridization revealed that the effect of TSH on P0-protein mRNA accumulation in the quiescent FRTL cells was time- and dose-related. This stimulatory effect of TSH was mimicked by (Bu)2cAMP. Nuclear run-off transcription assays revealed that TSH increased the transcriptional activity of the P0-protein mRNA without an increase in beta-actin transcriptional activity. On the contrary, the stability of P0-protein mRNA decreased after the addition of TSH. Cycloheximide markedly inhibited TSH-induced P0-protein mRNA accumulation in FRTL cells. Second, using a synthetic oligonucleotide probe, we have shown that TSH also increased P2-protein mRNA levels in FRTL cells. Furthermore, immunodetection of P-proteins using anti-P-protein antibody showed that TSH significantly increased the amount of P-proteins in the cells. These results suggest that TSH can increase the amount of acidic ribosomal P-proteins at least in part through an increase in the level of P-protein gene transcripts. This effect occurs via a transcriptional mechanism and requires ongoing protein synthesis. Thus, TSH might play an important role in ribosome biogenesis in FRTL cells.\r"

  ".W": "Astrocytic glial cells from 1- and 21-day-old rat brains were established in primary culture to study the expression of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptors and IGF-I-stimulated glucose transporter (Glut-1). Astrocytes from both age groups expressed specific high affinity IGF-I receptors, whose relative affinities for IGF-I, IGF-II, and insulin were comparable. However, the total number of binding sites and IGF-I receptor mRNA levels were 148% and 240% higher in astrocytes from 21-day-old compared with 1-day-old brains. IGF-I caused a dose-dependent stimulation of [3H]2-deoxy-D-glucose [( 3H]dGlc) uptake in astrocytes from 1-day-old brains. This was associated with increases in Glut-1 protein and mRNA levels. In contrast, astrocytes from 21-day-old brains exhibited a 58% decrease in the binding capacity and a 77% decrease in the steady state levels of Glut-1 protein and its mRNA. In addition, IGF-I failed to stimulate the Glut-1 system in these cells. This lack of IGF-I effect is not due to an alteration inherent to the Glut-1 system, since 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate stimulated [3H]dGlc uptake and Glut-1 protein and its mRNA levels. These observations suggest that changes in basal and IGF-I-stimulated Glut-1 system in brain astrocytes may be developmentally regulated.\r"

  ".W": "We report here a study of the plasma ACTH and corticosterone responses to synthetic ovine CRH (oCRH) in hypothyroid and hyperthyroid rats studied 7, 15, and 60 days after either thyroidectomy or the administration of pharmacological doses of T4. The purpose of this study was to further clarify the time-dependent effects of alterations in thyroid status on the functional integrity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and to aid in the interpretation of the oCRH stimulation test in hypo- and hyperthyroid states. Our data demonstrate that hypothyroid rats have a significant reduction in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of corticosterone and a significant decrease in adrenal weight in association with significant increases in the plasma ACTH response to oCRH. On the other hand, the corticosterone response to the ACTH released during the oCRH stimulation test was significantly reduced in hypothyroidism. With increasing duration of thyroidectomy-induced hypothyroidism, there was a progressive fall in CSF corticosterone levels, a progressive increase in the plasma ACTH response to oCRH, and a gradual normalization of the corticosterone responses to the ACTH released during oCRH stimulation. Our findings in hyperthyroid rats were generally the converse of those seen in hypothyroidism. Hence, there was a significant increase in the CSF levels of corticosterone and a significant increase in adrenal weight in association with an initial slight decrease in the ACTH response to oCRH. On the other hand, the corticosterone response to the ACTH released during oCRH stimulation was significantly increased. There was a gradual increase in the magnitude of the rise in CSF corticosterone levels with time, as well as a gradual normalization of adrenocortical responses during oCRH stimulation. The ACTH plasma clearance rates were similar in hypo-, hyper-, and euthyroid rats. Our data do not permit definitive identification of the precise locus in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis that is principally affected by experimentally induced alterations in thyroid status. However, these data are most compatible with a subtle hypothyroid-induced centrally mediated adrenal insufficiency and a subtle hyperthyroid-induced centrally mediated hypercortisolism. These data also suggest that alterations in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function in states of disturbed thyroid function become somewhat more pronounced as the duration of thyroid dysfunction increases. The fact that pituitary-adrenal responses to oCRH are consistently altered in states of thyroid dysfunction may be relevant to the clinical interpretation of oCRH stimulation tests.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), a 17,000 mol wt protein, mediates a variety of immunological and inflammatory events. TNF alpha is a potent inhibitor of bone collagen synthesis and stimulator of osteoclastic bone resorption, the net effect of which is to cause bone loss. We have previously reported that TNF alpha inhibits the synthesis of collagen by osteoblastic cells in culture out of proportion to effects on total protein synthesis, suggesting that inhibition of bone formation by TNF alpha may be due to selective inhibition of matrix protein synthesis. To further test this hypothesis and to evaluate the mechanism of TNF alpha action, we studied the effect of TNF alpha on synthesis of the osteoblast-specific bone Gla protein (BGP) by ROS 17/2.8 cells, which have the osteoblast phenotype. Cells were cultured with 10 nM 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 to stimulate BGP secretion, followed by the addition of TNF alpha (1-100 ng/ml) in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-containing medium. TNF alpha (10 ng/ml) inhibited BGP secretion to 42 +/- 5%, 19 +/- 10%, and 15 +/- 3% of control values after 24, 48, and 72 h of treatment. After 48 h, inhibition of BGP secretion was observed with 2 ng/ml TNF alpha and was maximum with 100 ng/ml. To determine the effect of TNF alpha on total protein synthesis, cells were pulse labeled with [14C]leucine during the last 4 h of TNF alpha treatment, and incorporation of radioactivity into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable protein in cell layer and medium was determined. The TNF alpha inhibition of BGP secretion was independent of changes in [14C]leucine incorporation, suggesting that TNF alpha did not have a general inhibitory effect on total protein synthesis. Cell number was not affected by TNF alpha. Northern analysis of steady state BGP mRNA revealed a dose-dependent decrease in the BGP/cyclophilin mRNA hybridization signal intensity after 24 h of treatment. The maximum inhibitory effect was 41 +/- 5% of the control value with 100 ng/ml TNF alpha. The effect of TNF alpha on steady state BGP mRNA levels was not prevented by treatment of cells with cycloheximide, suggesting that TNF-induced new protein synthesis was not required for TNF alpha action. These results suggest that the mechanism of TNF alpha inhibition of BGP synthesis includes a pretranslational site and support the hypothesis that TNF alpha inhibits bone formation by a selective inhibition of matrix protein production.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have suggested a role for the carboxyl-terminus of PTH in the binding of the molecule to renal and skeletal receptors, but the functional significance of this binding remains uncertain. We have investigated the possible role of this region by examining the effect of substituting the asparagine residue at position 76 of the native human molecule [Asn76]hPTH-(1-84) with an aspartate residue, [Asp76] hPTH-(1-84) on activity in both renal and skeletal cytochemical (CBA) and adenylate cyclase (AC) bioassays. In the renal CBA, [Asp76]hPTH-(1-84) was considerably less potent than [Asn76]hPTH-(1-84) and produced dose-dependent inhibition of the bioactivity of intact bovine (b) PTH-(1-84), bPTH-(1-34), and [Asn76]hPTH-(1-84). [Asp76]hPTH-(39-84) inhibited the response to intact PTH to a lesser extent, whereas [Asp76]hPTH-(53-84) had no antagonistic activity. In the metatarsal CBA, [Asp76]hPTH-(1-84) inhibited the response to intact PTH, but was less potent than in the renal CBA. In both renal (OK) and skeletal (UMR) cell AC assays [Asp76]hPTH-(1-84) and [Asn76]hPTH-(1-84) were equipotent agonists. Therefore, the CBAs are much more sensitive to modification of the carboxyl end of the molecule than AC assays. The antagonist properties of [Asp76]hPTH-(1-84) appeared to be mediated by phosphodiesterase activation as theophylline abolished the antagonism of this analog. These studies indicate that generation of PTH analogs, modified at the carboxyl-terminal region as well as at the amino-terminus, may be useful for developing potent PTH antagonists.\r"

The purified hTR beta 1 was used to produce monoclonal antibodies. Three hybridomas, secreting mAb J51, J52, and J53, were isolated. All of these mAbs recognized hTR beta 1. J51 and J52 belong to the immunoglobulin G1-k subclass; J53 is an IgM. To evaluate cross-reactivity with other classes of c-erbAs, the three mAbs were used to immunoprecipitate the in vitro translation products of human (h) TR alpha 1, TR alpha 2, rat (r) TR beta 1, TR alpha 1, and TR alpha 2. None of these three mAbs reacted with h- or rTR alpha 1 and TR alpha 2. J51 did not react with rTR beta 1, but J52 and J53 cross-reacted with rTR beta 1 with the same activity as hTR beta 1. To localize the epitopes in the hTR beta 1 molecule, [35S]methionine-labeled and truncated hTR beta 1 containing the hormone-binding domain E (Lys235-Asp456; Lys201-Pro414), domain D (Met169-Asp456), or the DNA-binding domain C (Glu100-Asp456) were expressed in E. coli and purified. Immunoprecipitation of the above truncated hTR beta 1 with mAbs indicated that the epitopes for J51 and J52 were located in two different sites in the A/B domain. The epitope for J53 was located in the E domain. Using immunocytochemistry and mAb J52, the endogenous TR beta 1 in rat pituitary GH3 cells was visualized to be exclusively present in nuclei. The transfected hTR beta 1 in monkey COS-1 and human choriocarcinoma JEG-3 cells was recognized by both J51 and J52. Interestingly, the intracellular localization of the transfected hTR beta 1 or rTR beta 1 in the above two cell lines depended on the level of expression. TR beta 1 expressed at low levels was found exclusively in nuclei. However, for high level expression of TR beta 1, cytoplasmic localization was also detected. J53, however, failed to detect nuclear fluorescence of the endogenous and transfected TR beta 1 in fixed cells, suggesting that its antigenic site might be occluded. Localization of the endogenous and transfected TR beta 1 in nuclei indicated that these two receptor proteins are structurally indistinguishable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

To identify a neuroanatomic basis for this effect of progesterone, the diencephalon of the ovariectomized cat was examined immunohistochemically with an antiprogesterone receptor (anti-PR) monoclonal antibody. No immunostaining was found in ovariectomized animals pretreated with sesame oil alone. In contrast, numerous cells in the ventromedial aspect of the hypothalamus from cats pretreated with estradiol benzoate were PR immunoreactive. Thus, PR is induced by estrogen in hypothalamic neurons of cats. In animals pretreated with estradiol benzoate, the highest density of immunostained neurons was found throughout the infundibular nucleus, especially in the region of the mammillary recess of the third ventricle. PR-immunoreactive cells were also distributed throughout the periventricular nucleus, with the highest density located rostrally and immediately above the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Notably and in contrast to a number of other species (e.g. rat and guinea pig), only very few weakly stained PR-containing cells were found in the hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus. This latter finding could reflect the progesterone independence of sexual behaviors in cat. Overall, we have identified hypothalamic areas that may subserve estrogen-dependent receptor-mediated effects of progesterone in the cat, such as the stimulation of respiration.\r"

  ".W": "The cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) has a variety of effects in the kidney involving induction of nephritis and renal injury. In addition, recent reports suggest that IL-1 regulates natriuresis and renin secretion in the kidney. To examine the potential sites of action of IL-1 in the kidney, we used iodine-125-labeled recombinant human interleukin-1 alpha ([125I]IL-1 alpha) to identify and characterize IL-1 receptors in crude membrane preparations of mouse (C57BL/6) kidney. The binding of [125I] IL-1 alpha was linear over a broad range of membrane protein concentrations, saturable, reversible, and of high affinity, with an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 66 +/- 10 pM and a maximum number of binding sites of 1.04 +/- 0.24 fmol/mg protein. In competition studies, recombinant human IL-1 alpha, recombinant human IL-1 beta, and a weak IL-1 beta analog (IL-1 beta+) inhibited [125I]IL-1 alpha binding to mouse kidney in parallel with their relative bioactivities in the T-cell comitogenesis assay, with inhibitory binding affinity constant (Ki) values of 28 +/- 19, 53 +/- 23, and 5560 +/- 2098 pM, respectively; rat/human CRF and human tumor necrosis factor had no effect on [125I]IL-1 alpha binding. In autoradiographic studies, IL-1 receptors were heterogeneously distributed in the kidney, with significantly higher densities present in the medulla than in the cortex. To study the effects of endogenous IL-1 in modulating [125I]IL-1 alpha-binding sites in kidney, we injected 30 micrograms of the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mice ip. Autoradiographic studies demonstrated substantial decreases in [125I]IL-1 alpha binding in both the kidney cortex (control, 34.7 +/- 6.2 fmol/mg tissue equivalent; LPS, 11.3 +/- 0.3; P less than 0.05) and medulla (52.7 +/- 8.1 vs. 26.0 +/- 1.0; P less than 0.05) 24 h after injection of LPS. Saturation studies in whole kidney homogenates demonstrated that the LPS-induced decrease in [125I]IL-1 alpha binding was primarily due to a down-regulation of IL-1 receptors (i.e. decrease in the maximum number of binding sites). The identification of IL-1 receptors in kidney with characteristics similar to those of IL-1 receptors in the brain-endocrine-immune axis provides further support for a physiological role for IL-1 in regulating renal function.\r"

  ".W": "The renal glycoprotein hormone erythropoietin (Epo) interacts with erythrocytic progenitors to stimulate their proliferation and differentiation in the bone marrow. The renal O2-sensing mechanism in the control of the synthesis of Epo is still poorly understood. Therefore, the capacity of isolated rat kidneys to produce Epo during hypoxic and anemic perfusion was studied. The kidneys were perfused at a constant perfusion pressure of 100 mm Hg with a substrate-enriched Krebs-Henseleit solution containing 60 g/liter BSA and freshly drawn human erythrocytes. Epo was measured by RIA. When the kidneys were perfused at an arterial pO2 of 720 or 150 mm Hg (hematocrit, 5%), Epo production was very low (0.1-0.2 U/g kidney within 3 h of perfusion). When the arterial pO2 was lowered to 35 or 20 mm Hg, Epo production increased to 0.4 and 0.9 U/g kidney, respectively. The release of Epo during hypoxic perfusion (pO2 35 and 20 mm Hg) was little affected by changes in the hematocrit, i.e. the O2-carrying capacity of the perfusion medium over a wide range (0-40%). These results indicate that the production of Epo in the isolated perfused kidney depends on the availability of O2 and can be modulated by changes in the arterial pO2.\r"

The interaction of Tg with the major Ca2(+)-mediated stimuli of glomerulosa cells on aldosterone production was also examined. The effects of Tg and the Ca2(+)-mobilizing angiotensin-II (AII) were additive. The aldosterone production stimulatory effect of potassium, which induces Ca2+ influx via voltage-operated Ca2+ channels, was potentiated by Tg. The positive interaction between Tg and potassium on aldosterone production raises the possibility that stimuli generating Ca2+ signal by depleting intracellular Ca2+ stores, such as Tg or AII, enhance the response of the cell to depolarization. Such an interaction between AII and potassium may have an important role in the physiological control of aldosterone production.\r"

  ".U": "91209312\r", 
  ".W": "By acting in the brain, insulin suppresses food intake, whereas neuropeptide Y (NPY) has the opposite effect. Since fasting increases NPY gene expression in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) and also lowers circulating insulin levels, we hypothesized that the anorexiant effect of insulin could result from insulin inhibition of NPY gene transcription in the ARC. Therefore, we determined whether the administration of insulin (200 mU per 12 hrs) into the 3rd cerebral ventricle of lean (Fa/Fa) female Zucker rats (n = 5) during 48 hrs of food deprivation reduces the expression of preproNPY mRNA in the ARC compared to vehicle-treated controls (n = 5). Coronal sections of rat brain were hybridized with an oligonucleotide probe complementary to preproNPY mRNA and apposed to x-ray film. Hybridization was quantified in both the ARC and the hippocampal dentate gyrus by computerized image analysis of the resulting autoradiographs. Central insulin significantly reduced the area of hybridization in the ARC (0.235 +/- 0.017 mm2; mean +/- SE) compared to vehicle-treated controls (0.331 +/- 0.037 mm2; p less than 0.05), but was without effect in the hippocampus. Thus, insulin reduced the expression of mRNA for NPY specifically in the ARC. Since the genetically obese (fa/fa) Zucker rat is insensitive to the anorexiant effect of insulin and over-expresses NPY in the ARC, we next tested the hypothesis that insulin does not suppress NPY mRNA expression in the ARC of these rats. Consistent with this hypothesis, central insulin administration to obese Zucker rats during 48 hrs of food deprivation (n = 6) did not lower hybridization area in the ARC compared to vehicle alone (n = 4) (0.286 +/- 0.036 vs. 0.248 +/- 0.019 mm2; p greater than 0.05). We conclude that insulin suppresses the expression of mRNA for NPY in the ARC of fasted lean but not obese Zucker rats. Regulation of hypothalamic NPY gene expression by insulin may account for its anorexiant effect, and a defect in this action may contribute to certain forms of obesity.\r"

In a recent publication we showed that the LH/CG-induced down regulation of the LH/CG receptor is primarily due to an increase in the rate of degradation of the receptor, and occurs with little or no change in the levels of LH/CG receptor mRNA. Although relatively unimportant for the LH/CG-induced down-regulation of the LH/CG receptor, we also found that LH/CG can in fact elicit a reduction in LH/CG receptor mRNA and that this reduction is mediated by cAMP. These findings raised the possibility that the ability of other compounds to down-regulate the LH/CG receptor may be accompanied by decreases in LH/CG receptor mRNA. In an attempt to answer this question, we examined the possibility that the mEGF- or phorbol ester-induced down regulation of the LH/CG receptor is due to changes in LH/CG receptor mRNA. The experiments presented herein show that this is indeed the case.\r"

In nude mice carrying CHO tumors which had not been transfected with the IL-6 gene, there were no changes in these parameters.

In this study we have examined whether developmental differences exist in the effect of UNX on IGF-1 gene expression. Immature (23 days) and adult (4 months) Wistar rats underwent a sham operation or left UNX, and were sacrificed 24 or 48 hrs later. IGF-1 mRNA levels were determined in left (control) and right (compensated) kidneys using solution hybridization/RNase protection assays. By 48 hrs post-UNX, remnant kidneys had grown 20 +/- 1% in adult rats (P less than 0.05), and 69 +/- 5% in immature rats (P less than 0.05). IGF-1 mRNA levels were not increased in the adult compensated kidneys at either 24 or 48 hrs post-UNX. In contrast, kidneys from immature rats 24 and 48 hrs post-UNX had an average 4-fold increase (P less than 0.05) in exon 1 IGF-1 mRNA levels, and an average 3-fold increase (P less than 0.05) in exon 2 mRNA levels. Thus, these findings suggest that there is an age-dependent difference in the effects of UnX on IGF-1 gene expression, and provide the first evidence that IGF-1 gene expression increases following unilateral nephrectomy in immature rats.\r"

In this study we have shown that estradiol-17 beta acts on cultures of immature rat granulosa cells to stimulate DNA synthesis. DNA synthesis stimulated by estradiol-17 beta was enhanced by FSH. We have shown previously that transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) stimulates DNA synthesis in rat granulosa cells in vitro and that this effect is augmented by FSH. The mitogenic action of estradiol-17 beta was mediated, at least in part, by a TGF-beta-like factor since in the presence of a neutralizing antibody to TGF-beta, DNA synthesis was attenuated. This conclusion was further supported by the novel finding that estradiol-17 beta stimulated the secretion of a TGF-beta-like factor by rat granulosa cells in culture. In summary, the evidence suggests that the actions of estradiol-17 beta and TGF-beta on DNA synthesis are interrelated, and that a TGF-beta-like factor mediates the mitogenic effects of estradiol-17 beta on rat granulosa cells.\r"

The present study employed in situ hybridization histochemistry with 35S-labeled anti-sense cRNA probes derived from a full-length murine T-cell IL-1 receptor cDNA to identify cells producing IL-1 receptor mRNA in the murine hippocampus. An intense signal was observed over granule cells in the dentate gyrus. A weak to moderate signal was observed over the pyramidal cell layer of the hilus and CA3 region. Other aspects of the hippocampal formation, including the CA2 and CA1 regions, the subiculum, and the entorhinal area, displayed no signal above background. This distribution of IL-1 receptor mRNA was similar to that of 125I-IL-1 alpha binding sites and supports the growing body of evidence implicating IL-1 as a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator in brain.\r"

Preliminary studies have reported that the prevalence of H. pylori infection increases with age, but detailed information on the prevalence of the bacteria in any defined population and on the factors that may influence the pattern of distribution remains scanty. In the present study, a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a [13C] urea breath test were used to investigate the prevalence of H. pylori infection among 485 healthy asymptomatic volunteers between the ages of 15 and 80 residing in the Houston metropolitan area. H. pylori infection was present in 52%. The prevalence of H. pylori infection increased rapidly with age at 1%/yr for the overall population. The frequency of H. pylori infection was higher in blacks (70%) than whites (34%) (P less than 0.001); this difference remained after adjustments were made for age, gender, educational level, income, and use of tobacco or alcohol. H. pylori infection was independent of gender but was closely correlated with socioeconomic class. There were significant inverse correlations between age-adjusted frequency of H. pylori infection and income and between educational level and H. pylori infection. There was no association between H. pylori infection and consumption of alcohol or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug use or smoking. Having pets was associated with a lower frequency of H. pylori infection, but this was highly associated with higher socioeconomic status. The mode(s) of transmission of H. pylori is unknown, but the social patterns of H. pylori infection are consistent with fecal-oral transmission as one important pathway. Socioeconomic factors seem to determine the age of acquisition.\r"

Platelet-activating factor induces severe pathological changes in various organs and, among numerous potent effects, causes bowel necrosis. Pouchitis is a poorly understood complication of ileoanal pouch anastomosis which occurs in patients who undergo surgery for ulcerative colitis. The aim of this study was to measure ileal or fecal platelet-activating factor and lyso platelet-activating factor contents in normal volunteers (n = 12), in patients with terminal ileostomy (n = 7), and in patients with ileoanal anastomosis (n = 15) (8 patients have pouchitis defined by the presence of ulcerations on the reservoir). Fecal samples were processed and assessed for platelet-activating factor by platelet aggregation assay. The aggregating material was further characterized as platelet-activating factor by the following: inhibition of the platelet aggregation it induced by specific platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist (BN 52021; IHB, Le Plessis Robinson, France); abolition of platelet aggregation after incubation with phospholipase A2 but not with lipase A1; and retention time on high-performance liquid chromatography. Stool platelet-activating factor content (in nanograms per gram of stool, mean +/- 1SD) was significantly increased in patients with pouchitis (22.2 +/- 16 ng/g) compared with patients with normal reservoir (1.59 +/- 0.63 ng/g, P less than 0.01), terminal ileostomy (0.59 +/- 0.43 ng/g, P less than 0.01), and healthy controls (0 +/- 0 ng/g of stool, P less than 0.001). Lyso platelet-activating factor (nanograms per gram of stool) was increased in patients with pouchitis (10,704 +/- 5499 ng/g) compared with patients with normal reservoir (4721 +/- 4549 ng/g of stool, P less than 0.05), terminal ileostomy (3042 +/- 4019 ng/g, P less than 0.02), and healthy volunteers (128 +/- 107 ng/g, P less than 0.001). In patients with ileoanal anastomosis and pouchitis, increased platelet-activating factor production could be implicated in the inflammation and ulcerations observed in the reservoir.\r"

None of the 57 patients in the study population had a documented history of ulcer disease. There were four treatment groups, each with similar demographics (age and sex). Cimetidine-treated group consisted of 15, famotidine-treated group of 18, ranitidine-treated group of 19, and antacid-treated group of 5 patients. There was no hemodynamically significant postoperative gastrointestinal bleeding in any of the patients. When the agents were compared for efficacy of gastric pH control, statistically better pH control was found in the famotidine- and ranitidine-treated groups (P less than 0.003) than in the cimetidine-treated group (pH less than or equal to 4.0) during the 20-hour observation period. Side effects (hematologic and neurological) were noted only in the cimetidine-treated group. The results of this study indicate that in patients in postoperative intensive care, better gastric pH control, and thus prevention of gastric stress ulcers, is achieved with either famotidine or ranitidine rather than cimetidine or antacid.\r"

Steatorrhea and low lactase activities were found in more than 85% of the patients. All biopsy specimens were abnormal with reversal of the ratio of villus length to crypt depth in seven and enlarged enterocyte nuclear size in nine. Human immunodeficiency virus was detected in five jejunal biopsy specimens, within villus enterocytes of one patient who had the most severe malabsorption of the group and in four other biopsy specimens in mononuclear infiltrating cells of the lamina propria. These results suggest that human immunodeficiency virus infection of the small intestinal mucosa is an early event that is associated with altered enterocyte differentiation and function.\r"

Recent reports have shown an increased association of hyperplastic polyps with adenomatous polyps and have advocated a full colonoscopy in patients who harbor hyperplastic polyps. Hyperproliferative mucosa is known to be associated with adenomatous polyps, but its relationship to hyperplastic polyps is unknown. In the present pilot study, it is determined whether a change in mucosal proliferative patterns is observed in patients who harbor only hyperplastic polyps or a history of hyperplastic polyps relative to those who harbor both hyperplastic polyps and adenomatous polyps by measuring ornithine decarboxylase and tyrosine kinase activity in macroscopically normal rectal mucosa. Fifteen patients had either adenomatous polyps proximally or harbored adenomatous polyps and hyperplastic polyps. Seven patients had hyperplastic polyps and 15 patients had a prior history of hyperplastic polyps with no polyps found during the current examination. The ornithine decarboxylase activity of the rectal mucosa with proximal adenomatous polyps or both polyp types was significantly higher than that of hyperplastic polyps, the history of hyperplastic polyps, or controls, and values for hyperplastic polyps and the history of hyperplastic polyps were similar to controls. On the other hand, tyrosine kinase activity in the rectal mucosa of patients with both or either polyp type was elevated without any significant difference between hyperplastic and adenomatous polyps. Thus, it is concluded that although increased ornithine decarboxylase activity in rectal mucosa suggests the presence of adenomatous polyps or a combination of adenomatous with hyperplastic polyps, increased tyrosine kinase activity suggests the presence of any type of polyp.\r"

  ".W": "Oxygen radicals can cause endothelial and epithelial permeability changes and mucosal injury of the small intestine. There is no clear consensus concerning the relative injurious potential of individual oxygen radicals. In this study, the small intestinal cell line IEC-18 was used as an in vitro model to study the relative injurious effects of reactive oxygen metabolites. By introducing different combinations of oxygen metabolite-producing enzymes, xanthine oxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase, and an iron chelator, deferoxamine, to the fully confluent monolayers and to proliferating IEC-18 cells, the differential injurious effects of the oxygen metabolites O2-, H2O2, and OH. could be evaluated. The extent of cellular injury was assessed using [3H]thymidine uptake, 51Cr release, and morphological evaluations. Our results suggest that OH. produced as a by-product of O2- and H2O2 via the Haber-Weiss reaction was the most injurious oxygen species involved in cellular injury of IEC-18 monolayers induced by xanthine oxidase. O2- produced by xanthine oxidase appeared to be only minimally injurious, and H2O2 produced by xanthine oxidase and as a result of conversion of O2- by superoxide dismutase was moderately injurious. Superoxide dismutase and deferoxamine at appropriate concentrations were protective against xanthine/xanthine oxidase-induced monolayer injury. H2O2 added directly or produced indirectly by glucose oxidase was very injurious to the intestinal monolayers, and this injury was mitigated by catalase.\r"

  ".W": "The absorption of an intact oligopeptide was investigated in rat and dog small intestine using the metabolically stable somatostatin analogue SMS 201-995. The synthetic octapeptide was coupled to 4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazol to have a fluorescent label for the direct visualization. The 4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-labeled peptide was active in displacing the corresponding hormone 125I-Tyr3-SMS 201-995 (Sandostatin; Sandoz Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland) from its high-affinity binding site in rat cortex membranes with an IC50 = 4.6 x 10(-10) mol/L. The release of growth hormone from cultured anterior pituitary cells was inhibited by the fluorescent somatostatin analogue with the same potency as by somatostatin 14 (IC50 = 6 x 10(-10) mol/L). Incubation with mucosal scrapings followed by high-performance thin-layer chromatography analysis showed that the peptide was stable against proteolysis. 4-Nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazol SMS 201-995 was well absorbed from enterocytes of rat small intestine. The absorption was highest into jejunal cells and it could be inhibited by an excess of unlabeled peptide. A significantly lower absorption was detected in crypts compared with villus tips. No fluorescence could be seen in intestinal mucin and goblet cells. After oral administration, the 4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-labeled peptide rapidly appeared in the blood of rats and dogs, reaching a bioavailability of 4.3% and maintaining pharmacological activity. This suggests that enterocytes are able to absorb intact oligopeptides being stabilized against proteolytic degradation through a transcellular mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "Cellular uptake of formycin B, a poorly metabolized analog of inosine, by the isolated epithelium of rabbit jejunum is three times higher in the presence of Na+ than without this cation. The Na(+)-dependent nucleoside transport system is located in the apical membrane of the enterocytes and is capable of uphill transport, as shown for formycin B and adenosine with brush border membrane vesicles. According to present and earlier evidence, nucleoside transport across the basolateral membrane appears to have the properties of facilitated diffusion. Na(+)-dependent formycin B transport activity in intestinal epithelium decreases from jejunum to ileum and is absent in descending colon. As with Na(+)-coupled cotransport systems for other organic solutes, apical entry of formycin B is driven by the electrochemical Na+ gradient into the cell. In contrast to the facilitated diffusion system for nucleosides, Na(+)-dependent formycin B transport is not inhibited by nitrobenzylthioinosine, but both carrier systems are sensitive to inhibitors of D-glucose transport. Natural purine nucleosides and uridine are strong inhibitors of Na(+)-dependent formycin B transport. Transepithelial flux measurements substantiated that the Na(+)-dependent transport mechanism for formycin B functions as an absorptive system.\r"

To evaluate the effects of 6 months' treatment with omeprazole in humans, the oxyntic endocrine cells were morphometrically investigated at the ultrastructural level in five patients with active duodenal ulcer. No omeprazole-induced changes were found in the volume density of the total endocrine cell population and specific cell types (including the enterochromaffin-like cell) as well as in the other cytological parameters investigated (number of cell profiles per unit area, mean cross-sectional area of cell profiles, nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio, and density of cytoplasmic secretory granules). Both pretreatment and post-treatment values in our patients with duodenal ulcer significantly differed from those of a previous investigation of healthy volunteers with regard to the volume density of enterochromaffin-like cells and non-granulated cells, which increased, and of D cells, which markedly decreased. The latter result may provide a cellular basis for impairment in the paracrine release of fundic somatostatin in peptic ulcer disease. Finally, morphometric data on endocrine cell volume density provided by electron microscopy were found to correlate with those obtained in the same patients using light microscopy techniques (Grimelius silver impregnation and chromogranin A immunostaining). It is concluded that 6 months' treatment with pharmacological doses of omeprazole is devoid of appreciable trophic effect on endocrine cells of human oxyntic mucosa.\r"

Bombesin-stimulated gastrin release was compared in 11 H. pylori-infected patients with chronic duodenal ulcer and 8 uninfected healthy volunteers both before and after therapy to eradicate H. pylori. Bombesin infusion significantly increased the gastrin release both in control subjects and in patients with duodenal ulcer. Antimicrobial therapy (bismuth, tetracycline, and metronidazole) to eradicate the H. pylori infection was associated with a significant reduction in bombesin-stimulated gastrin release in patients with duodenal ulcer (from 116.9 +/- 19 pg/mL to 69.5 +/- 7 pg/mL following 50 pmol.kg-1.h-1 bombesin; and from 158 +/- 29 to 83.4 +/- 10 following 200 pmol.kg-1.h-1 bombesin: P = 0.01 for each). Antimicrobial therapy had no effect on gastrin release in uninfected volunteers, thus excluding a nonspecific effect of antimicrobial therapy on antral G-cell function. Serum gastrin was also not increased by feeding 500 mg of urea to 5 H. pylori-infected volunteers. This suggests that access of hydrogen ion to the pH-sensitive sites governing gastrin release by mucosal ammonia produced by H. pylori urease is not a critical factor. These data suggest that exaggerated gastrin release present in patients with duodenal ulcer disease is secondary to H. pylori infection.\r"

Competitive binding studies indicated that substance P binding sites or NK-1 receptor sites were demonstrated. The concentration of NK-1 receptors was greatest in the distal half of the gastrointestinal tract, with the highest concentrations in the proximal colon. The circular muscle layer contained the greatest amount of substance P binding. The location and density of binding sites for substance P may be important in understanding the relative importance of both the pharmacological responses to this neuropeptide and the immunohistochemical evidence of the peptide at different sites in the intestine.\r"

Thus, the adaptive response of gastric and pancreatic lipases to dietary fat was studied in the adult rabbit. Effect of duration was studied by feeding rabbits 12% dietary fat for 1, 2, or 4 weeks or 2.7% for 2 weeks (control). To study the effects of the amount of fat, rabbits were fed the control diet (2.7% fat) or 6% and 12% dietary fat for 2 weeks. The influence of sunflower oil and butter was compared by feeding rabbits 12% dietary fat for 2 weeks. Approximately doubling (6% vs. 2.7%) the usual amount of dietary fat was sufficient to induce a maximum increase in gastric lipase activity in the fundus [+ 66.3% (units per gram tissue) or + 85.2% (units per milligram protein)] and the total stomach mucosa [+ 84.5% (units per mucosa)], whereas pancreatic lipase activity only significantly increased when rabbits were fed 12% dietary fat. A full adaptive response was observed for both gastric and pancreatic lipases after 2 weeks of diet. Triglyceride composition did not noticeably change the adaptive response of both lipolytic enzymes. The present results agree closely with those concerning lingual lipase in the rat and evidence that gastric lipase shows an adaptive response to moderate fat intake. The implications of these findings concerning humans are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies from this laboratory showed that serum anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, distinct from those associated with active Wegener's granulomatosis, are present in the majority of patients with ulcerative colitis. In this study, the specificity of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies for ulcerative colitis as compared with other colitides and diarrheal illness was determined. In a blinded study, test samples of serum were screened for anti-neutrophil immunoglobulin G in a fixed neutrophil enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Levels of neutrophil binding by immunoglobulin G and titers of anti-neutrophil immunoglobulin G in sera from patients with ulcerative colitis and patients with ulcerative colitis post colectomy were each significantly greater than the levels and titers for normal controls and patients with a variety of other colitides and diarrheal illnesses. Levels of neutrophil binding for colonic Crohn's disease, bacterial/amoebic colitis, the irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea, and other miscellaneous diarrheal illnesses were not significantly different than the levels for normal controls. Although the levels of binding for collagenous colitis were significantly less than the levels for ulcerative colitis, they were significantly greater than the levels for normal controls. Patterns of neutrophil binding by serum samples that were positive in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were determined by indirect immunofluorescence. Perinuclear staining was the predominant pattern shown by sera from patients with ulcerative colitis. The combination of a positive value in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a perinuclear immunofluorescence pattern was 60% sensitive and 94% specific for ulcerative colitis. It is concluded that anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in ulcerative colitis are not simply an epiphenomenon related to inflammation of the colon. Identification of the antigen(s) to which these autoantibodies are directed may facilitate understanding of the underlying immune response and may allow development of an assay that is more sensitive and specific for ulcerative colitis.\r"

This effect seemed to be independent of pH. The presence of albumin or fat (50 mg/20 mL fecal suspension) as substrates for the colonic flora gave rise to the formation of significantly higher amounts of methanethiol. Small amounts of pentane were found in the headspace after incubation with oil. These data show that the formation of volatile metabolites by the colonic flora is greatly influenced by the available substrates.\r"

  ".U": "91209723\r", 
  ".W": "Peptide E is a mu-selective opioid peptide derived from proenkephalin A which contains [Met5]-enkephalin at the amino end and [Leu5]-enkephalin at the carboxyl end. Peptide E is further processed both centrally and peripherally to a [Leu5]-enkephalin-containing fragment which was investigated to determine if processing leads to alterations in receptor selectivity. Peptide E-(15-25) inhibited electrically stimulated contractions in both the mouse vas deferens, longitudinal muscle, myenteric (IC50 = 459 nmol/L), and guinea pig ileum (IC50 = 2630 nmol/L), indicating a sixfold delta-receptor selectivity. When administered intracerebroventricularly to mice, peptide E-(15-25) also produced potent analgesia which was completely antagonized by naloxone pretreatment, but the peptide had no effect on intestinal transit as measured by the radiochromium geometric center method. This is consistent with earlier findings that intracerebroventricular delta-opioid-selective agents are analgesic but do not inhibit intestinal transit. In vitro radioligand binding assays were performed using male Sprague-Dawley rat whole brain homogenates. The IC50 for peptide E against [3H]naloxone was 1.8 nmol/L compared with the delta-opioid ligand, [3H] [D-Pen2, D-Pen5]-enkephalin of 38.8 nmol/L. The IC50 for peptide E-(15-25) against [3H]naloxone was 497 nmol/L, but for [3H] [D-Pen2, D-Pen5]-enkephalin it was 50.6 nmol/L. Therefore, peptide E loses mu-opioid receptor affinity (1.8-497 nmol/L) after proteolytic processing and the loss of the amino terminal tyrosine but maintains a high delta-opioid affinity (38.8-50.6 nmol/L). These studies demonstrate that enzymatic peptide processing of peptide E to peptide E-(15-25) leads to a shift from mu- to delta-receptor selectivity and a different spectrum of biological effects on gut motility.\r"

Gastroduodenal mucosal damage was assessed 2 hours after aspirin dosage by video-endoscopic techniques. At the conclusion of the study, the videotapes of all procedures were randomly evaluated by two endoscopists blinded to subject identification or study sequence. Endoscopically observed lesions were counted in the duodenum, gastric antrum, and gastric body. Aspirin damage was dose-related and more severe in the stomach than in the duodenum. There were no significant differences in total gastroduodenal lesion counts between age groups. In addition, no differences in median gastric pH or tissue 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha content were observed between age groups.

Thus, studies were conducted using paired 24-hour recordings, separated by 1-4 weeks, in 24 healthy volunteers (aged 19-50). Computerized analysis of each two-channel pressure recording (5 and 15 cm above lower esophageal sphincter) determined mean contraction amplitude, duration, area under the curve, contractility and propagation velocity, and the proportion of propagated contractions during day and night periods. A combined glass pH electrode (5 cm above lower esophageal sphincter) was used to register acid reflux. Visual analysis of the 24-hour contractility patterns showed marked intraindividual reproducibility but, although most subjects showed similar meal-associated increases and sleep-associated decreases in contraction frequency and amplitude, considerable interindividual variation was observed. This was confirmed by comparing the variation between subjects in the first and second recordings with the variation between recordings in the same subject; for all pH and manometry variables, the coefficient of variation was two to three times greater between subjects than between recordings in the same subject. The recordings were highly reproducible within subjects (nighttime contraction duration, P less than 0.05; all other variables, P less than 0.01). Thus, computerized ambulatory pH manometry is reproducible and because healthy volunteers have a characteristic individual pattern of esophageal motility, the method is perfectly suitable for repeated-measure design physiological and pharmacological studies. However, generally applicable normal values are difficult to define.\r"

The Na(+)-independent pathways are represented by the L system for most of the neutral amino acids and maybe L-proline and by the basic amino system y+ for L-lysine uptake. These results demonstrate that the different uptake pathways for transport of amino acids are present in the human fetal intestine and that their characteristics in terms of Na+ requirement and proximodistal activity gradient are already established in the early stages of the human development.\r"

Two studies were performed, one serological and the other endoscopic, both in arthritis patients receiving nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs chronically. The presence of H. pylori was identified with a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test. One hundred eighty-three patients participated in the serological study and 75 patients in the endoscopic study. The frequency of H. pylori infection increased with age, independent of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug use; the age-adjusted frequency of H. pylori infection in arthritis patients paralleled that of 351 asymptomatic individuals without arthritis. The frequency of H. pylori infection increased from 30.7% in age group 21-30 years to 73.4% in age group 61-75 years. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug-induced mucosal injury, either hemorrhages or erosions, was more frequent in those without H. pylori infection than with infection (61% vs. 32% for hemorrhages and 57% vs. 34% for erosions for those without and with H. pylori infection; only the difference in the frequency of hemorrhages was significant, P less than 0.05). No difference was observed in the presence of dyspeptic symptoms between those with and without H. pylori infection. These data suggest that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug-induced damage to the gastroduodenal mucosa does not increase the susceptibility to H. pylori infection.\r"

Two families are presented in which DNA diagnosis for familial adenomatous polyposis was performed using linked restriction fragment-length polymorphisms. Screening guidelines are improved using data from the polyposis registers at St. Mark's Hospital (London) and Western Australia (Perth) on at-risk family members who subsequently developed familial adenomatous polyposis. In these registers, 103 of 137 relatives tested positive on initial screening; of the remaining 34, the average interval between initial negative screening and development of familial adenomatous polyposis was 7.5 years. All those who had inherited the familial adenomatous polyposis gene manifested the polyps by age 34 years. Combined with linkage marker data, the a priori 50% risk for relatives can now be reduced to less than 0.5% by age 30 years if there is an initial negative result on sigmoidoscopy and a negative diagnosis by linkage analysis. The screening management for those found by linkage to have inherited familial adenomatous polyposis remains unchanged from established recommendations; however, for individuals who most likely have not inherited familial adenomatous polyposis, the clinician can emphasize the positive aspects of screening management, including longer screening intervals.\r"

  ".W": "Ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin, is partially excreted into bile. With its clinical use, the formation of gallbladder sludge detected by ultrasonography has been reported. Four surgical specimens were examined and no gallstones were found. Instead, fine precipitates of 20-250 microns were present. Microscopically, there was a small number of cholesterol monohydrate crystals and bilirubin granules among an abundant amount of granular-crystalline material that was not morphologically cholesterol monohydrate crystals. The chemical composition of the precipitates (n = 4) was determined. There was a small amount of cholesterol (1.7% +/- 0.8%) and bilirubin (13.9% +/- 0.74%). The major component of the precipitate was a residue. On further analysis using thin-layer chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, and electron microprobe analysis, the residue was identified as a calcium salt of ceftriaxone. The residue also had identical crystal morphology and chromatographic elution profile as authentic calcium-ceftriaxone standards. It is concluded that ceftriaxone, after excretion and being concentrated in the gallbladder bile, can form a precipitate. The major constituent has been identified as a ceftriaxone-calcium salt.\r"

Thirty-three of 38 cases with Child's grade A disease showed a reduction of total bile acid level at 15 minutes; this level was maintained in the majority of them until 120 minutes. A similar mode of serial changes in total bile acid level was also shown in the cases with Child's grade B disease. On the other hand, only 2 of 10 cases with Child's grade C showed a reduction of total bile acid level at 15 minutes. Reduction of total bile acid level at 15 minutes after glucagon administration was mimicked by infusion of dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate. However, in 3 of 6 cases with elevated total bile acid level at 15 minutes after glucagon administration, dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate induced a reduction of total bile acid level. Also, it was confirmed that glucagon enhances the uptake of taurocholate into freshly isolated rat hepatocytes by activating Na(+)-dependent, carrier-mediated membrane transport system and observed that its effect is associated with elevation of Vmax (0.6114 nmol.min-1 x 10(6) cells-1 without glucagon; 0.975 nmol.min-1 x 10(6) cells-1 in glucagon added) but not with affecting Km (13.58 mumol/L without glucagon; 13.71 mumol/L with glucagon) or protein synthesis which is inhibited by cycloheximide. These observations suggest that glucagon enhances Na(+)-coupled membrane transport of bile acids in the liver and causes the reduction of serum total bile acid level and that a lack of this response may be indicative of membrane dysfunction in the liver.\r"

In seven, ultrasonography showed focal hypoechogenicity within a \"bright\" liver, generally interpreted as focal sparing. Three patients had hyperechoic areas surrounded by \"normal\" parenchyma usually felt to represent local fat accumulation without diffuse involvement. Morphometric analysis was used to determine the total area occupied by fat (area density) and the number of lipid droplets (numerical density) per microscopic field in lesional and perilesional specimens. Compared with respective perilesional values, hypoechoic lesional numerical densities were significantly lower in 6 of 7 patients; the three hyperechoic samples had significantly higher values. In most cases, lesional and perilesional area densities were not significantly different. These hypoechoic focal lesions are believed to be merely areas in which a similar quantity of fat is contained in fewer droplets, and focal hyperechogenicity is believed to result from a larger number of fat-filled vacuoles with respect to that of the surrounding parenchyma. Variation in the number of solid-liquid interfaces causes the ultrasonic contrast between these lesions and the similarity fatty liver parenchyma surrounding them.\r"

  ".W": "This study used the specific cholecystokinin (CCK)-receptor antagonist loxiglumide to evaluate whether endogenous CCK, which is released after a meal, regulates pancreatic and biliary functions. Eight healthy volunteers were studied twice on separate days. The subjects received a continuous intraduodenal infusion of a 750-kcal liquid test meal for 2 hours either with or without IV infusion of 5 mg.kg-1.h-1 of loxiglumide. Loxiglumide at this dose abolishes the actions of CCK at various target organs including gallbladder and pancreas, when given at doses that mimic postprandial plasma concentrations of CCK. Loxiglumide markedly decreased the meal-stimulated outputs of amylase, trypsin, and chymotrypsin by 55%-70% of control values but only slightly decreased duodenal volume (25% inhibition of mean integrated secretion). Loxiglumide abolished gallbladder emptying induced by infusion of nutrients and even increased gallbladder volumes when compared with prior fasting values. Correspondingly, loxiglumide almost abolished the output of bilirubin after infusion of nutrients. However, loxiglumide failed to alter the increase in circulating concentrations of glucose, insulin, and C peptide after infusion of nutrients. The present results show that CCK is one of several factors that regulate pancreatic protein secretion after absorption of nutrients. However, CCK is probably not involved in regulation of pancreatic secretion of fluid. In contrast, gallbladder function is mainly regulated by CCK, both in terms of its emptying after intestinal absorption of nutrients and in terms of maintenance of its fasting volume. Cholecystokinin does not play a major physiological role as an insulinotropic factor.\r"

Sialosyl Tn antigen, recognized by monoclonal antibody TKH2, was expressed in a cancer-associated fashion, being completely absent in normal pancreas but expressed by 56% of chronic pancreatitis and 97% of pancreatic cancers. T antigen, recognized by monoclonal antibody AH9-16, was expressed in 68% of normal pancreas (acinar cells), 67% of chronic pancreatitis, and 48% of pancreatic cancer tissues. These results indicate that normal acinar cells of the pancreas are capable of expressing selected carbohydrate structures associated with the initial steps of mucin glycosylation. The marked expression of sialosyl Tn compared with T antigen in pancreatic cancers suggests that with malignant transformation there is selective usage of glycosyltransferase enzymes involved in mucin oligosaccharide synthesis.\r"

The cause of liver disease was suspected at initial interview in only 13 instances, whereas histological evidence of fat-storing cell hyperplasia with fluorescent vacuoles led to the diagnosis in the remaining cases. Cirrhosis was found in 17, mild chronic hepatitis in 10, noncirrhotic portal hypertension in 5, and \"increased storage\" alone in 9 cases. During a mean follow-up period of 4.6 years, 6 patients died of causes related to the liver disease. A precise appraisal of drug consumption was obtained in 29 cases. Among them the total cumulative intake was the highest in patients with cirrhosis (423 +/- 103 x 10(6) IU) and significantly lower in those with noncirrhotic liver disease (88.5 +/- 41; P less than 0.02). The smallest continuous daily consumption leading to cirrhosis was 25,000 IU during 6 years, whereas higher daily doses (greater than or equal to 100,000 IU) taken during 21/2 years resulted in similar histological lesions. It was concluded that at least in some western countries chronic vitamin A consumption might represent an appreciable cause of chronic liver disease, the recognition of which mainly relies on expert liver biopsy interpretation. The data also indicate that prolonged and continuous consumption of doses in the low \"therapeutic\" range can result in life-threatening liver damage.\r"

Cholangiocarcinoma was found in 8 patients and in 23% of those undergoing liver transplantation. Asymptomatic patients had milder disease than symptomatic patients, but in a univariate analysis the presence of symptoms was not prognostically significant. On multivariate analysis, the following independent prognostic factors were found: hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, serum alkaline phosphatase, histological stage, and age. These features were combined to produce a prognostic model that should be valuable in the stratification of patients in clinical trials and in the timing of liver transplantation, particularly in those patients seen soon after presentation.\r"

Two patients underwent cholecystectomy within 1 week of methyl tert-butyl ether treatment, one patient 2 weeks after, another 10 weeks after, and one 12 weeks after. Indications for cholecystectomy were bilirubinate stones (resistant to methyl tert-butyl ether), catheter dislodgement, bile leakage, and gallstone recurrence (2 patients). Gallstones were dissolved completely in three patients, there was approximately 50% stone reduction in one patient, and no dissolution occurred in the fifth patient. Each gallbladder was examined grossly and histologically. Electron microscopic evaluation was performed in one cases. Typical inflammatory findings of chronic cholecystitis were observed in each gallbladder and were most conspicuous in the submucosa; the mucosal and serosal surfaces were intact. Mild acute inflammatory changes were noted in the submucosa in the two patients with the shortest interval between methyl tert-butyl ether administration and cholecystectomy. There were no ulcerations in the mucosa and no unusual wall thickening or fibrosis in any patient. These observations support the safety of methyl tert-butyl ether perfusion in the human gallbladder; the mild acute changes may be a transient and reversible phenomenon.\r"

The relation of cholesterol saturation, total protein, and pH was studied in 73 gallbladder bile samples with and 35 gallbladder bile samples without cholesterol crystals. In samples containing crystals, a trend to higher values of cholesterol and to a higher cholesterol saturation index was observed. However, significantly (P = 0.02) higher concentrations of total protein were found in samples with crystals [0.80 +/- 0.40 g/dL (8.0 +/- 4.0 g/L)] than in samples without crystals [0.63 +/- 0.26 g/dL (6.3 +/- 2.6 g/L)]. Moreover, of 22 bile samples with total protein concentrations greater than 10.0 g/L, cholesterol crystals were detected in all but 2. Total lipids, bile acids, phospholipids, and pH values were not significantly different in the two groups of bile samples. It was concluded that high biliary protein concentrations are frequently associated with cholesterol crystals and may, therefore, be a possible risk factor in the pathogenesis of cholesterol gallstones.\r"

Different approaches were tested depending on the presence of a T tube and on the localization of the bile duct stones. When a T tube was present (7 cases), the lithotripsy was performed under direct vision using a choledochoscope inserted through the T-tube tract. In 18 patients without a T tube in place, the lithotripsy was performed under fluoroscopy using a retrograde approach in case of common bile duct stones (14 cases) or under choledochoscopy using a percutaneous transhepatic approach in case of intrahepatic bile duct stones (4 cases). Fragmentation of all the bile duct stones and a complete bile duct clearance were obtained in all 11 cases with procedures performed under direct vision as compared with only 5 of 14 cases with procedures under fluoroscopic control. Moreover, 6 of the 9 failures using the latter approach were offered another session using a choledochoscope inserted through a percutaneous transhepatic tract and were also successfully treated. No complication related to the laser beam was noted. It is concluded that pulsed dye laser lithotripsy of bile duct stones (that are unable to be removed by standard endoscopic techniques) is safe and efficacious provided that it is performed under direct vision. Technical refinements are needed before this procedure can be reliably performed under fluoroscopy.\r"

A percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram showed that the extrahepatic and right-sided intrahepatic ducts were normal. Computerized tomography of the abdomen showed multiple hypodense lesions in the liver. Guided needle biopsies of several of these lesions showed severe confluent necrotizing pericholangitis with cytomegalovirus-infected cells. Numerous cryptosporidia were seen attached to biliary epithelium. The unique histopathologic and radiographic features of this case should be added to the spectrum of hepatobiliary manifestations of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\r"

Vaginal reconstruction using a pedicled transplant of the sigmoid colon was successfully accomplished at age 19. Fourteen years later she developed vaginal bleeding, and a biopsy of the neovagina revealed changes consistent with ulcerative colitis. Within 2 weeks the patient developed bleeding per ano, and a rectal biopsy also revealed changes consistent with ulcerative colitis. Symptoms responded to sulfasalazine. This is believed to be the first case report of ulcerative colitis developing in colonic tissue used for a neovagina. The etiology, natural history, and surveillance of ulcerative colitis in relation to this unique case are reviewed. This case argues against the hypothesis that chronic ulcerative colitis is causally related to direct exposure to alimentary antigens.\r"

During the pretransplant episode of liver failure she developed quadriparesis that rapidly progressed after transplantation to a severe polyneuropathy. Following transplantation she also developed a second-degree burn of the light-exposed abdominal wall. The neuropathy resembled that observed in other forms of porphyria, and it is proposed that the extreme disturbance of protoporphyrin levels associated with protoporphyrin-induced liver failure caused this neuropathy. Such a neuropathy has not previously been described in protoporphyria. Erythrocyte protoporphyrin levels remain high and fecal levels normal, although results of liver tests are normal. She remains photosensitive, which emphasizes that although liver transplantation may be lifesaving in this disorder, it is not curative, and care must be taken to prevent photosensitive damage to skin and light-exposed internal organs.\r"

Therefore a study was initiated to test whether and how leukocytes distribute in the lung circulation during HD with different membranes. Thirteen patients suffering from chronic renal failure underwent lung scintigraphy during HD with cuprophane (n = 3), hemophane (n = 8) and polysulfone (n = 2) lowflux capillary dialyzers. Isolated autologous leukocytes were labelled with 99m-Technetium and reinfused before starting HD. Distribution of leukocyte related activity was registered by lung scintigraphy. In comparison to normal lung scintigraphy performed without HD, an impressive redistribution peak was demonstrated 10-20 min after the start of HD with cuprophane and also to a lesser extent with hemophane. When HD was performed with polysulfone the decrease in activity was delayed but no real redistribution was obtained. In accordance with other phenomena, such as peripheral leukopenia and changes in granulocyte oxidative metabolism, pulmonary sequestration of leukocytes takes place in man in the initial phase of HD and appears to be strongly dependent on the type of membrane.\r"

An arbitrary axial and/or radial hematocrit profile can be chosen. The hematocrit dependence of the intrinsic viscosities k0 (H) (characterizing, at least in part, the RBC aggregation) and k infinity (H) (describing orientation/deformation of RBC) was taken into account. Velocity profiles for pressure gradients of 4-4000 Pa/cm show a distinct flattening, if a pronounced axial migration of RBC is assumed. The higher the axial concentration, the higher the flow at the same pressure gradient. Small deviations (less than or equal to 10%) of the capillary number per dialyzer or of the radius of capillaries lead to a strong change of the pressure gradient with the same dialyzer flow. Whereas small hydraulic conductivities do not significantly change this gradient, high conductivities decrease the pressure gradient by about 10%. Impaired blood flow properties (hemoconcentration) result in a slight deviation from the linear axial pressure drop.\r"

Results showed that: a) in vitro: in uremics patients before rHuEPO therapy, bone marrow erythroid precursor cytoplasmic Ca++ was lower than in normal subjects; the addition of Ca++ to the bone marrow erythroid precursors induced a dose-dependent Ca++ and erythroid colony development increase; 1,25 (OH)2 D3 potentiated this effect; b) in vivo: rHuEPO normalized bone marrow erythroid precursor Ca++ and erythroid colony development. An inverse correlation was seen between bone marrow erythroid colony development, precursor CA++ before therapy, the in vitro erythroid and the rHuEPO dose needed in vivo to normalize hematological parameters. These data emphasize the role of Ca++ in erythropoiesis and may aid understanding of the mode of action of rHuEPO in HD.\r"

The housing parts of the pump were thermoformed from technical semifinished materials. All blood contacting surfaces of the pump were coated with biomaterials in a controlled dipping process. During the design and fabrication process a professional CAD-system was used. This facilitated spatial presentations of pump components for first evaluations at the initial draft stages. The CAD-design data were then transformed to CNC-controlled lathes and mill's for the fabrication of pump tools. The stresses and strains of the moving blood pump components, such as membranes and valves, were precalculated by means of Finite-Element-Analysis (FEM). After completion of the pump, the internal flow fields were investigated by flow-visualization techniques using non-Newtonian test fluids, and the pump characteristics (function curves) were investigated in appropriate circulatory mock loops. The paper covers all above aspects from first draft to final fabrication and testing.\r"

Two membrane plasma separators constructed of cellulose di-acetate (CA) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) were evaluated with heparin or citrate alone for anticoagulation in a 26 year old male with myasthenia gravis. Maximum white blood cell counts decrease was 21% at 30 min for the CA with heparin while no decrease was observed for the other schemes. Platelet counts changes were comparable between heparin and citrate, while the PVC groups showed less changes than the CA groups. The CA groups, regardless of the type of anticoagulant used, indicated that complement activation occurred via the classical pathway within the module in addition to the activation via alternative pathway for the CA with heparin. In the PVC groups, complement activation was noted to occur only when heparin was used for anticoagulation. PT and PTT showed slight increases with citrate, while they were remarkably prolonged with heparin. Citrate showed less changes in cellular and humoral factors compared to heparin. CA with heparin was the most activating combination of membrane material and anticoagulant, while the PVC with citrate was the least activating combination.\r"

Ninety consecutive intact carotid plaques obtained from surgery and 43 carotid plaques from cadavers without symptoms of cerebral ischemia were evaluated. Ulceration and mural thrombus were the only morphologic findings statistically correlated to the presence of hemispheric symptoms (p less than 0.02). Intramural hemorrhage was more common in patients with hemispheric symptoms but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.31). Plaque causing high degree stenosis had a higher incidence of intramural hemorrhage (p = 0.04) and ulceration (p less than 0.02). Ulceration of plaque plays a major role in the onset of hemispheric symptoms. The results of our study support the hypothesis that in the majority of the cases, hemispheric symptoms are embolic in nature.\r"

Intestinal lymphography shows no injection of the cisterna chyli and histology proves that the mesenteric lymph nodes are abnormal. The induced hyperlipidemia test permits a biochemical diagnosis. Modifications of the flow of the chyle secondary to the hypoplasia of the cisterna chyli were studied: (1) in the abdominal cavity, (2) in the extraperitoneal region and the lower limb, (3) in the thorax, especially the chyle drainage channels from the diaphragm towards the cervical region. Our investigations have established that the following diseases are produced by malformation of the lymphatics of the small intestine: protein losing enteropathy, chyloperitoneum, chyluria, lymphedema with chyle reflux, chylothorax, chylopericardium, chyle reflux in the pulmonary lymphatics, hypoproteinemia and food allergies. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of the malformations of the intestinal lymphatics permits a more rational treatment of the diseases produced by this anomaly.\r"

  ".W": "This study investigated the effects of heparin in patients with peripheral arterial disease, before and during operation. The relation between heparin dosage and heparin response and consumption were calculated from changes in the activated clotting time (ACT). Before operation, 38 patients were each given 10,000 units of heparin by intravenous injection and ACT was measured after 5, 10, 20, 30 and 60 minutes. Assuming a linear relation between heparin dosage and ACT, a dose of heparin was calculated which should double the normal ACT. This was given during operation in 21 patients while a standard dose of 7,500 units of heparin was given to another 10 patients. ACT was measured during operation at the same time intervals as before operation. ACT was always at its highest level at the 5 minute test and was always still raised at 60 minutes, both before and during operation. No significant correlation was found between ACT, heparin response or heparin consumption, and the patients' ages, sex, body weights and creatinine levels, either before or during operation. It was not possible to predict the intraoperative response from the preoperative test. It is concluded that the heparin effect should be monitored during operation in each patient if the best dose response is to be obtained.\r"

The mean follow-up for the series was 5.35 years (range 1 month to 23 years) and 18.5% of the patients were followed for at least 10 years. Primary patency decreased progressively to 83% at 10 years and 77% at 15 years. It was significantly improved to 90% (at 10 years) and 84% (at 15 years) by means of operative thrombectomy (secondary patency). Factors influencing patency (univariate analysis) were (1) concomitant femoropopliteal occlusive disease, (2) the site of the femoral anastomosis and (3) the date of the operation. Multivariate analysis in relation to the femoral anastomosis stressed the importance of profunda femoris artery disease and the date of operation. It is concluded that the negative effects of concomitant superficial femoral artery disease may be completely relieved by an adequate profundaplasty. Furthermore the substantial progress, we documented over the years of the study, supports our view that aortofemoral reconstruction may also be offered as the solution of choice to patients with milder forms of claudication.\r"

Despite the lack of a precise preoperative diagnosis in the majority of cases, the prognosis for aorto-caval fistula remained comparable to that for patients undergoing emergency surgery for uncomplicated ruptured aortic aneurysms. The mortality of spontaneous aorto-duodenal fistulae was appreciably higher and the aneurysmal contents of 4 out of these 5 cases had positive bacterial cultures.\r"

In order to avoid the inherent trauma of balloon angioplasty, yet at the same time \"debulk\" atheroma, 75 patients underwent laser angioplasty of the superficial femoral and iliac arteries as \"sole therapy\". Laser angioplasty was performed using an Nd:YAG laser coupled to a 600 micron fiber and a 3.5 mm probe (22-28 watts), 4.2 mm or 5.0 probe (32-40 watts). Fifty-nine patients had laser angioplasty for claudication and 16 for limb salvage. The initial angiographic success rate was 84% (41/49) (lesion length 2-14 cm) for the superficial femoral and 69% (18/26) (lesion length 2-14 cm) for the iliac arteries. In follow-up extending to 21 months (mean 14.4 months) 73% (30/41) of the superficial femoral artery and 76% (14/18) of the initially recanalized iliac arteries remain patent. When initial failures are included, this represents an overall intermediate-term patency rate of 52% (32/49) for superficial femoral and 49% (14/26) for iliac arteries respectively. By avoiding the disruptive effect on the arterial wall architecture caused by balloon angioplasty, while at the same time ablating and vaporizing more atheromatous material with larger laser probes, the long-term patency rates of laser angioplasty as \"sole therapy\" may prove to be superior to those of laser assisted balloon angioplasty.\r"

The operative angiograms were reviewed and the vein diameter was measured to the nearest 0.5 mm. Postoperative follow-up consisted of visits every three months where graft patency was assessed by physical examination and measurement of graft flow velocity and ankle-brachial indices. Conduits less than 3 mm had a higher rate of occlusion in the 0-30 day interval, but following that period performed satisfactorily. No conduit less than 2 mm was successfully utilized, because of inability to incise valves without injury in these tiny conduits. Following the perioperative period, conduit diameter does not affect the long-term durability of in situ bypass grafts.\r"

The patient underwent a successful aorto-bifemoral Y graft and small bowel revascularization with a saphenous vein graft between the Y graft and the accessible proximal portion of the superior mesenteric artery. Before vascular reconstruction, the hepatic perfusion indices (HPI) in both the fasted and fed states were elevated; after mesenteric revascularization the HPI values were substantially lowered. The hepatic perfusion index may, by demonstrating functional abnormality, be useful in the diagnosis of mesenteric ischaemia and also in the assessment of treatment. Further evaluation of HPI in patients with suspected mesenteric ischaemia is therefore required.\r"

Part I was a prospective metabolic study, measuring myocardial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and creatine phosphate (CP) contents before and after ischemia in 30 coronary bypass (CABG) patients. During ischemia, CP levels decreased significantly, whereas ATP did not. After 10 minute of reperfusion, mean ATP contents were 90% of preischemic values and CP levels increased to 85% of preischemic values. Spontaneous myocardial defibrillation was seen in 93.3% of patients. Part II included evaluation of early postischemic myocardial function in 228 patients, 48 with multiple valve replacement (MUVR) and 180 with CABG. Spontaneous myocardial defibrillation was seen in 90.3%. Cardiac index, measured before and 1 and 12 hours after surgery, increased significantly in the postischemic period (from 1.95 +/- 0.9 to 2.5 +/- 0.7 l/min m2 in MUVR, p 0.04; from 2.2 +/- 0.6 to 2.7 +/- 0.7 l/min/m2 in CABG, p 0.01). Myocardial infarction frequency was 3% among CABG patients, and unrelated to the number of distal anastomosis or to aortic cross-clamp time. Early postoperative mortality was 6.2% for MUVR and 0.5% for CABG. Thus, oxygenated cardioplegia with Hamburg solution preserves high-energy phosphate compounds and prevents ischemic injury, with excellent short-term clinical results.\r"

We have studied the effect of PEEP ventilation on the relationship between coronary flow (CBF) to left ventricular workload. In the closed chest of surgically instrumented dogs, increasing PEEP caused a significant decrease in aortic, left ventricular pressures and aortic flow. The coronary blood flow decreased by 5% for PEEP values of 4 cm of H2O and by 25% for 14 cm of H2O of PEEP. The left ventricular (dP/dt)max was markedly decreased. Following the application of 16 cm H2O of PEEP, the predicted myocardial oxygen consumption using Kreb's equation decreased by 42% of base line values, p less than 0.001. The ratio of CBF to predicted oxygen consumption increased with higher PEEP values, a 84% increment at 16 cm H2O of PEEP relative to zero PEEP (p less than 0.001). Our results suggest that PEEP may have beneficial effects on the relationship between CBF and the predicted myocardial oxygen consumption, and therefore may minimize hypoxic myocardial situations. Further studies that will directly measure the myocardial oxygen consumption are essential before clinical conclusions can be drawn from our results.\r"

The diastolic function of nonoxygenated crystalloid solution (CC sO2) was compared with those of oxygenated crystalloid (CC cO2) and oxygenated fluorocarbon cardioplegic (FC cO2) solutions. Postischemic ventricular performance was studied in 3 equal (no. 7) groups of dogs subjected to 120 minutes of global ischemia induced at an average myocardial temperature of 18.5 +/- 1.4 degrees C. LV diastolic function (chamber and myocardial stiffness) and relaxation (the exponential fall in LV pressure) were evaluated by sonomicrometry and Millar micrometers before ischemia and at 45 and 60 minutes after ischemia. LV chamber and myocardial stiffness in the CC sO2 group was significantly (p less than 0.05) elevated after ischemia, while the CC cO2 and FC cO2 groups did not show increases in LV chamber and myocardial stiffness after ischemia. LV relaxation before and after ischemia was not changed in any group. The myocardial water content of the CC sO2 group was significantly higher than that of the CC cO2 and FC cO2 groups (p less than 0.05). We conclude that (1) the postischemic increase in LV chamber stiffness in the CC sO2 group was dependent not only on the increase in intrinsic myocardial stiffness but also due to an increase in myocardial edema, and (2) there was no correlation between the LV relaxation rate and the leftward shift of diastolic compliance curves in the CC sO2 group.\r"

Emergency use of the Bioflow to bypass the right coronary artery in combination with the right gastroepiploic artery graft to the anterior descending artery resulted in an excellent outcome. The two Bioflow grafts were patent at the 20th and 10th postoperative days, respectively. These cases strongly suggest the efficacy of Bioflow during emergency situations in CABG.\r"

At the start of the cardiopulmonary bypass the patient's circulating blood volume was separately drained into a bag, spun down and retransfused into the patient at the end of the operation. Moderate hypothermia, aortic cross clamping, topical hypothermia and cold crystalloid cardioplegia were used in all patients. None of the patients had transfusions in the postoperative period. No macroscopic or microscopic evidence of haemolysis were seen, nor haematuria or other clinical evidence of sickling. There was no evidence of wound infection and all were discharged home at a mean of 12.6 days. It is concluded that in cases of sickle cell anaemia exchange transfusion at the beginning of cardiopulmonary bypass followed by retransfusion of the red cell free blood can be used safely, permitting the performance of standard open heart procedures.\r"

Angiography revealed retrograde flow to the left subclavian artery via the left vertebral artery and left internal mammary artery. Severe stenosis of the left subclavian artery was demonstrated at its ostium. Restoration of antegrade flow to the vertebral artery and left internal mammary artery by transluminal angioplasty resulted in complete resolution of these symptoms.\r"

Only 64% of individuals with diabetes reported following a diabetic diet at the time of the survey, and only 6% were consuming a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet (greater than or equal to 50% energy intake from carbohydrate and less than or equal to 30% from fat). The dietary habits of elderly persons with diabetes suggested an awareness of the need to limit simple sugars; however, adherence to the latest recommendations concerning dietary fat and fiber was poor. Individuals with diabetes had lower intakes of refined carbohydrate but were just as likely as those without diabetes to eat high-fat foods, and they ate eggs and cheese more frequently. Those with diabetes were no more likely than those without diabetes to consume the recommended complex-carbohydrate and fiber-rich foods. The extent of adherence to current dietary recommendations for the management of diabetes was found to be independent of sex, age, occupational status, educational attainment, marital status, living arrangements (alone vs with a spouse), and source of income.\r"

  ".W": "The element boron is ubiquitous in the environment. Comparatively low concentrations of dietary boron affect several aspects of mineral metabolism in animals and human beings. Therefore, it is appropriate to determine precisely the concentration of boron in human foodstuffs and absorbed, inhaled, or ingested nonfood substances. In this article, we report the analyzed concentrations of boron and other elements in selected foods (animal products, water, condiments, confections, fruits, tuberized roots, vegetables, cereal grains, and spices) and personal-care products (analgesics, antibiotics, decongestants, antihistamines, dental hygiene products, gastric antacids, and laxatives). We conclude that daily intake of boron usually differs considerably between any two individuals for three main reasons. First, concentration of boron in water varies considerably according to geographic source. At some locations, boron in drinking water and water-based beverages may account for most of the total dietary boron intake. Second, individual food preference greatly influences daily intake of boron. Fruits, vegetables, tubers, and legumes have relatively much higher concentrations of boron than do cereal grains or animal tissues and fluids. Third, boron was determined to be a notable contaminant or major ingredient of many personal-care products.\r"

Objectives of the study were to collect, code, and analyze the data; develop and test models using actual operation data; and compare forecasting results with current methods in use. Customer count was forecast using deseasonalized simple exponential smoothing. Menu-item demand was forecast by multiplying the count forecast by a predicted preference statistic. Forecasting models were evaluated using mean squared error, mean absolute deviation, and mean absolute percentage error techniques. All models were more accurate than current methods. A broad spectrum of forecasting techniques could be used by foodservice managers with access to a personal computer and spread-sheet and database-management software. The findings indicate that mathematical forecasting techniques may be effective in foodservice operations to control costs, increase productivity, and maximize profits.\r"

DHEAS, an adrenal androgen, is low in childhood and rises with the development of secondary sexual characteristics. Biochemical measures included plasma DHEAS assessed by radioimmunoassay, cholesterol assessed by an enzymatic method, and hemoglobin assessed by the cyanmethemoglobin method. Midarm muscle area (MAMA) was calculated from midarm circumference and triceps fatfold measurements. DHEAS was correlated significantly with height, weight, MAMA, and hemoglobin. By age, significant differences were found for height, weight, and MAMA, but not for any of the biochemical measures. For boys with DHEAS concentration less than 3 mumol/L, values for height, weight, body mass index, MAMA, and hemoglobin were significantly different from those for boys with higher DHEAS concentrations. No significant differences were found for age or nutrient intakes by DHEAS concentration groups. Mean plasma cholesterol concentrations decreased with increases in age and with maturation evidenced by higher DHEAS concentration. Cholesterol concentration was negatively correlated with height and MAMA. Mean nutrient intakes estimated by a quantitative food frequency questionnaire met or exceeded the Recommended Dietary Allowances for these age groups. DHEAS identified maturation differences in male adolescents.\r"

This is earlier than cytomegalovirus hepatitis, which usually occurs 30-40 days after transplantation. Eight recipients (67%) died, and in seven, the diagnosis was made at autopsy or less than 48 h before death. Clinical manifestations associated with mortality were hypotension, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), metabolic acidosis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and bacteremia. Laboratory abnormalities at diagnosis associated with mortality were high creatinine, low platelet counts, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, and a high percentage of band forms on the blood smear. Disseminated HSV disease was noted in four of six patients who had an autopsy and included involvement of lungs in three and the gastrointestinal tract in three. Five recipients developed DIC and all died. Pathologically, HSV hepatitis has two forms, focal and diffuse. All three patients with diffuse liver pathology died. However, three of seven with focal liver pathology survived with antiviral therapy, which suggests that early diagnosis and treatment may be lifesaving. None of these patients had received prophylactic acyclovir. It is possible that acyclovir prophylaxis may be able to prevent this disease.\r"

Lymphoblastoid cell lines that produce standard transforming EBV also harbored EBNA2-deleted virus in cells permissive of EBV replication. In vitro infectivity studies indicated that the DNA is packaged and transmissible, with biologic properties similar to those of a laboratory mutant, P3HR-1, which also lacks the EBNA2 gene. These findings, obtained from productively infected cell systems, provide evidence for the existence in nature of a transformation-incompetent EBV variant that may facilitate EBV persistence and the emergence of reactivation diseases.\r"

  ".W": "A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method developed to detect varicella zoster virus (VZV) in clinical samples is based on amplifying sequences of viral gene 31, the coding region for glycoprotein II. Its sensitivity was evaluated by amplification from plasmid VZV DNA containing VZV gene 31; 45 copies were detected in 1 microgram of human DNA. In testing within 24 h after the onset of varicella exanthem, 21 (75%) of 28 lesion samples were positive by VZV PCR, whereas VZV was isolated from only 21% by a standard tissue culture method. Only 1 (3.3%) of 30 samples of oropharyngeal secretions but peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 8 (67%) of 12 patients were positive. The sensitivity and specificity of the VZV PCR method indicates its usefulness for investigating the pathogenesis of VZV infection. Direct contact with cutaneous lesions rather than respiratory secretions may be the most important route of VZV transmission from healthy individuals with acute varicella.\r"

The 50% human infectious dose (HID50) in infants and children was 10(2.9) and 10(2.6) TCID50 for the ah and ca vaccine, respectively. The ah influenza A/Kawasaki/9/86 reassortant was reactogenic: 24% of infants and children infected with greater than or equal to 100 HID50 had fever greater than or equal to 39.4 degrees C. Since H3N2 ah vaccines were previously shown to be adequately attenuated, it is reasonable to suggest that the genes that code for hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of the H1N1 virus apparently influence the reactogenicity of reassortant viruses derived from the avian influenza A/Mallard/New York/6750/78 donor virus. Because this avian virus does not reproducibly confer a satisfactory level of attenuation to each subtype of influenza A virus, it is not a suitable donor virus for attenuation of wild-type influenza viruses. In contrast, the ca A/Ann Arbor/6/60 donor virus reliably confers attenuation characteristics to a variety of H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A viruses.\r"

The same strain grown to suppress fimbrial expression and three non-type 1-fimbriated strains stimulated only background low-level PMNL activation. The binding of the type 1-fimbriated strain to PMNL was inhibitable by D-mannose and concanavalin A, while that of non-type 1-fimbriated strains was not but was inhibited by antibodies to the PMNL complement receptors 1 and 3. TNF alpha (10(-9) M) synergistically augmented the non-type 1-fimbriated E. coli-stimulated LTB4 release and additively increased secondary granule release without affecting primary granule release. In contrast, none of the responses to the type 1-fimbriated strain were augmented by TNF alpha. In the absence of mannose-sensitive adhesins, the activation of PMNL by E. coli may involve both complement receptors 1 and 3 and be augmented by TNF alpha.\r"

Combined PFGE and hybridization pattern analysis failed to provide any more epidemiologic information than was obtained from PFGE restriction profiles alone.

Mechanism 1, present in some Hib strains and their capsule-deficient mutants and accompanied by apparent increases in lipopolysaccharide content, was reproduced with a mixture of glucose, lactate, urea, and bicarbonate. Mechanism 2, present only in capsulated Hib and accompanied by increased capsulation, was reported with a mixture of Ca++ and lactate. Hib incubated with these compounds in buffer or grown in serum filtrate was resistant, but Hib grown in conventional media containing the metabolites in serum filtrate was resistant, but Hib grown in conventional media containing the metabolites was not. The resistant phenotype, which resembles Hib in vivo, may depend on nutrient balance as well as the specific factors. Lactate apparently is an important energy source for Hib.\r"

In two isolates, resistance was due to a decreased sensitivity of the process of DNA synthesis to fluoroquinolones, suggesting the presence of an altered DNA gyrase. Another isolate had an enhanced energy-dependent mechanism, possibly an efflux system, by which cell-associated [3H]norfloxacin was reduced. When a 2.7-kb SphI-KpnI chromosomal fragment from this organism was cloned into pUC19, fluoroquinolone resistance was expressed in an Escherichia coli host, and such organisms acquired an energy-dependent ability to reduce cell-associated [3H]norfloxacin. Lack of homology between this DNA and other cloned gyrA genes indicated that its protein products are distinct from the gyrA protein. S. aureus has the capability of decreasing the quantity of cell-associated fluoroquinolone. An enhancement of this system by an as yet undefined mechanism and an alteration in DNA gyrase are two means by which this organism can develop resistance to fluoroquinolones.\r"

No false-positive reaction occurred. However, the duration and level of antigenemia were variable (greater than or equal to 500-2.5 ng/ml) and seemed not to depend solely on the severity of infection. Therefore, the question of whether the extent of antigenemia was determined by a serotype-dependent variation in the elimination rates of polysaccharides was investigated. Clearance rates for 12 serotypes varied in rabbits and rats by a factor of greater than 250. This remarkable variability appeared to affect the extent of clinical antigenemia. Thus, only very sensitive systems can detect circulating antigen from rapidly cleared polysaccharide serotypes. Furthermore, the question arises whether slow polysaccharide clearance contributes to the virulence of some pneumococcal serotypes.\r"

Stimulated (but not unstimulated) PBMC killed a subsequent inoculum of live encapsulated organisms, with maximal killing seen after 3-7 days. Killing required the presence of both adherent and nonadherent stimulated PBMC and was enhanced by anticapsular antibody. In contrast, unstimulated PBMC and the adherent fraction of stimulated PBMC killed an isogenic acapsular strain of C. neoformans. These data suggest that the CMI response controls cryptococcosis by eliciting two populations of fungicidal cells acting synergistically. Moreover, capsule, by thwarting the ability of unstimulated PBMC to kill C. neoformans, seems to obligate the host to mount an immune response to generate fungicidal cells.\r"

According to the inoculum size, these mice died spontaneously from acute pneumonia (high inoculum) or from brain swelling (lower inoculum). AmB and E1 together significantly improved the survival of mice in both models compared with AmB alone. The mechanisms by which E1 might potentiate AmB activity were investigated in vitro. When cryptococci were preincubated with AmB or another polyene antibiotic, nystatin, there was an augmented binding of E1. AmB enhanced phagocytosis by unstimulated peritoneal macrophages in the presence of E1 or normal rabbit immunoglobulins. Normal and immune IgG deserve further study to determine under what circumstances the chemotherapeutic effect of AmB can be enhanced.\r"

DFMO is a specific inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme of polyamine biosynthesis. To investigate polyamine metabolism in P. carinii, extracts of the organism were analyzed for polyamine content and ornithine decarboxylase activity, and [3H]ornithine and [14C]arginine incorporation into polyamines during short-term culture was determined. P. carinii extracts contained putrescine and spermidine in a ratio of 0.17:1; traces of spermine were detected. Although ornithine decarboxylase activity was not detected, P. carinii incorporated ornithine and arginine into putrescine and spermidine but not into spermine, suggesting that the spermine detected derived from contaminating host cells. Uninfected rat lung incorporated ornithine minimally. Pentamidine, DFMO, and alpha-monofluoromethyldehydroornithine methyl ester inhibited ornithine incorporation by up to 86% at clinically achievable concentrations. These data provide a rationale for using polyamine synthesis antagonists in P. carinii pneumonia and a method for screening antipneumocystis drugs in vitro.\r"

HIV-1-seropositive subjects developed chronic HBV infection (positive for hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] greater than 6 months) more frequently (7/31, 23%) than HIV-1-seronegative ones (2/46, 4%; P = .026). HIV-positive subjects who cleared HBsAg had significantly more circulating CD4+ lymphocytes (mean, 547 x 10(6)/l) than those who did not (352 x 10(6)/l, P less than .005). A subset of subjects who acquired both viruses between visits had an even higher rate of chronic infection (4/10, 40%). Icteric illnesses were reported more frequently by HIV-1-seronegative (11/46, 24%) than -seropositive subjects (3/31, 10%; P = .20). These findings indicate a potential for an increased reservoir of HBV infection in the community as a consequence of the HIV-1 epidemic.\r"

This preparation, containing 549 micrograms/ml III-GBS antibody was very active functionally when evaluated against multiple III-GBS strains both in vitro in an opsonophagocytic assay using newborn sera and in a newborn rat model of III-GBS disease. The level of functional activity was dramatically higher than that of commercially available human IgG preparations for intravenous use demonstrated previously in identical assays. Human IgG preparations hyperimmune for GBS offer promise for use as adjunctive therapy of sepsis in newborns.\r"

Haitian volunteers undergoing treatment for W. bancrofti and two nonendemic controls were enrolled. DEC levels in serum and urine samples were determined using a gas chromatographic method. No correlation was found between pre- and posttreatment microfilarial levels and drug levels. Drug levels were comparable in persons with or without residual microfilaria and in infected and uninfected persons. These results indicate that incomplete drug regimens, differences in serum drug levels, and inadequate drug dosage are not the primary causes of treatment failure and suggest there is a degree of parasite tolerance for DEC.\r"

Funding agencies and governments in developing countries should increase their support of collaborative research designed to improve world health, and health care professionals should work together to support their colleagues in developing areas who have potential interest in research careers. Scientists in the United States and Canada, regardless of the specific nature of their investigative activities, should initiate a scientific relationship with colleagues in developing countries.

Nonprogressors had higher beta 2-microglobulin levels than did seronegative controls, suggesting some degree of immune system activation.

The ability of BI-RG-587 to inhibit steps in the virus replicative cycle other than reverse transcription was also assessed. BI-RG-587 was found to be a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 replication in acutely infected cells (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] = 37.2 nM), and the sensitivity and kinetics of that inhibition was similar to the known RT inhibitor zidovudine (AZT). Even at 100x IC50, BI-RG-587 had no effect on gp120/CD4 interaction, syncytia formation, or envelope glycoprotein processing. In addition, no inhibition of viral replication or protein production was noted in a chronically infected cell line that produces viral products in an RT-independent manner. Finally, no inhibition of acute HIV-2 replication was noted, even with very high (2500x IC50 for HIV-1) concentrations of BI-RG-587. These results demonstrate that BI-RG-587 is a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 replication and that this inhibition occurs at the point of reverse transcription.\r"

Easily detectable unintegrated proviral DNA was present in nearly every tissue (lymphoid and nonlymphoid) examined. SIV-specific immunohistochemistry revealed that macrophages or macrophage-like cells were the predominant reservoirs for SIV. High burdens of infectious SIV were also characteristic of end-stage disease. At the molecular level, sequence analyses of molecular clones derived directly from tissue demonstrated that SIV, like other RNA viruses, exists as a mixture of closely related genomes. Viruses derived by cocultivation seemed to be selected for their ability to grow in tissue culture and did not represent the wide spectrum of genotypes in tissues. These data indicate that SIV-induced immunodeficiency is a complex, multisystem disease and that SIV replication, in addition to impairing the immune system, may have direct deleterious effects on multiple organ systems.\r"

Among 453 low-income urban schoolchildren, there were no seroconversions over a 10- to 12-month period (95% confidence interval [CI] for incidence, 0-0.8%). Antibody prevalence among rural children also declined between 1985 and 1989, though rates were higher than those in Bangkok. Antibody prevalence differed by community. The annual rural infection rate was 1.1% (CI, 0.8%-1.6%). The pattern of rural hepatitis A transmission was focal. Increased numbers of susceptible children in Thailand, where hepatitis A virus still circulates, sets the stage for rising rates of symptomatic disease in adults.\r"

Patient 1 was also coinfected with human hepatitis delta virus. A patient who cleared HBV replication after antiviral treatment with vidarabine served as negative control. HBV-specific RNA poly A sequences were detected by PCR in PBMC of patients 1 and 2 even without detectable HBV DNA (patient 2) as shown by dot blot and PCR assays. RNA sequences were found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. The demonstration of HBV mRNA sequences within PBMC suggests the transcription of viral DNA, in agreement with the findings of HBV surface antigen in PBMC. The results in patient 1 demonstrated HBV mRNA sequences in leukocytes even without PCR-detectable HBV DNA sequences, likely due to ongoing hepatitis delta virus replication.\r"

Alternatively, these hormones may protect factor XII or its transcripts from degradation. Because the liver is a major site of factor XII synthesis, we studied the expression and metabolism of factor XII in isolated livers of estrogen- and prolactin-treated rats. All rats were ovariectomized to reduce the effect of endogenous estrogen and prolactin on the expression of factor XII. When a phosphorus 32-labeled factor XII complementary DNA probe for Northern blot analysis was used, increased factor XII messenger RNA was found in poly (A) RNA prepared from livers of estrogen- and prolactin-treated rats relative to those of untreated rats. Simultaneously, enhanced release of immunoreactive factor XII was noted when isolated liver perfusion techniques were used. Cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, blocked the hepatic release of immunoreactive factor XII in both hormone-treated and untreated rats, suggesting that factor XII translation was directly affected. The biologic half-life of injected rat iodine 125-labeled factor XII in estradiol- and prolactin-treated rats was not significantly different from that in untreated rats. By inference from these data, the high plasma titer of factor XII observed in estrogen- and prolactin-treated rats is caused by enhanced hepatic expression at both transcriptional and translational levels, as well as by increased secretion of factor XII.\r"

  ".U": "91210645\r", 
  ".W": "Three recent studies have reported that fibrin in solution significantly inhibits the ability of heparin to catalyze the inhibition of thrombin by antithrombin III. In addition, heparin inhibits the release of fibrinopeptide A by clot-bound thrombin less effectively than it inhibits the release of fibrinopeptide A by thrombin in solution. We have also reported that dermatan sulfate, which catalyzes thrombin inhibition by heparin cofactor II, inhibits thrombus growth in rabbits more effectively than heparin. Because the results of these studies suggest that fibrin inhibits the reactivity of thrombin with antithrombin III-heparin but not with heparin cofactor II-dermatan sulfate, we compared the relative catalytic effects of heparin and dermatan sulfate on thrombin inhibition in plasma, both in the presence and absence of fibrin. We quantitated the rates of thrombin inhibition by antithrombin III and heparin cofactor II by specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. When it was generated, fibrin was kept in solution by adding 2 mmol/L Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro to plasma. Fibrinogen-fibrin reduced the reactivity of thrombin with plasma antithrombin III, both in the presence of and in the absence of heparin. In contrast, the catalytic action of dermatan sulfate on thrombin inhibition by plasma heparin cofactor II was unimpaired by fibrinogen-fibrin. Based on the ability of dermatan sulfate to inhibit thrombus growth in rabbits, failure of fibrinogen-fibrin to moderate the catalytic action of dermatan sulfate may account for its greater antithrombotic effectiveness relative to that of heparin.\r"

  ".W": "The diuretic drug triamterene has previously been shown to be a competitive inhibitor of folate absorption in the rat intestine (J Lab Clin Med 1986;108:272-6). We therefore investigated whether human subjects who are taking the drug on a long-term basis are at increased risk of folate deficiency. In each of two free-living populations, a study was performed to compare the folate status of triamterene users with those not taking the drug. The first population consisted of 272 elderly individuals not living in institutions who were participants in a nutrition status survey and who were taking a variety of antihypertensive medications; 32 of these individuals were daily users of triamterene. The hemoglobin concentration, red blood cell (RBC) count, and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) values were not significantly different between the triamterene users and nonusers. The female triamterene users had a slightly higher serum folate level than the female nonusers (p less than 0.04); a similar pattern was observed among the men, although the difference was not statistically significant. The second population consisted of 27 individuals attending a hypertension clinic; 18 subjects were taking 50 to 150 mg of triamterene per day and nine were taking antihypertensive drugs other than triamterene. The hemoglobin concentration, RBC count, MCV, serum folate values, and RBC folate values were found to not differ significantly between the triamterene users and the hypertensive controls (p greater than 0.05). These data suggest that chronic triamterene administration in individuals not living in institutions, at the doses examined in this study, is not associated with indications of folate deficiency.\r"

  ".W": "Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB homodimer) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) are potent wound-healing hormones that accelerate incisional repair. To identify more precisely and quantitatively the stage(s) of wound healing influenced by growth-factor therapy, we investigated the three sequential tissue repair processes--inflammatory cell influx, intracellular procollagen type I (PC-I) synthesis, and collagen cross-linking--in recombinant growth factor--treated wounds. Using newly developed automated, quantitative image-analysis techniques, we observed that PDGF-BB markedly augmented the directed migration of macrophages into wounds during the first week after wounding and triggered and earlier and more sustained influx of PC-I--containing fibroblasts into the wound when compared with results in TGF-beta 1-treated or control wounds (p = 0.015 at day 2; p = 0.007 at day 21). In contrast, automated image analysis revealed TGF-beta 1-treated wound fibroblasts had a nearly twofold increase in intracellular levels of PC-I protein when compared with PDGF-BB-treated or control wound fibroblasts (p = 0.004 at day 4). However, the influence of TGF-beta 1 was transient, and the longer duration of PDGF-BB activity suggested a later influence, perhaps on the collagen remodeling phase, which is ultimately required for increased wound strength. To address this possibility, collagen cross-linking in growth factor-treated wounds was inhibited by beta-aminoproprionitrile (BAPN) treatment, and wound breaking strength was analyzed. Both PDGF-BB and TGF-beta 1 continued to enhance repair in BAPN-treated rats, indicating that they do not function primarily at the level of collagen cross-linking. Thus, PDGF-BB appears to enhance the inflammatory phase of wound healing to indirectly trigger PC-I synthesis, whereas TGF-beta 1 quantitatively enhances PC-I synthesis directly, accounting for their differing duration of activities within healing wounds.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate neural mechanisms in salt-sensitive hypertension, norepinephrine turnover rates were measured in peripheral tissues and selected brain areas of Dahl salt-sensitive and salt-resistant rats receiving either 1% or 7% NaCl diets for 5 weeks. Norepinephrine turnover was determined by measuring tissue norepinephrine in untreated animals or in separate groups killed 2, 4, 6, and 10 hours after alpha-methyl-tyrosine. Plasma volume (radiolabeled albumin) was also measured. Arterial pressure of Dahl S rats receiving 7% NaCl (167 +/- 4 mm Hg) was higher (p less than 0.001) than that of Dahl S rats receiving 1% NaCl (141 +/- 3mm Hg), which was higher (p less than 0.001) than that of Dahl R rats receiving both NaCl intakes. Norepinephrine turnover was increased (p less than 0.01) by 7% NaCl in both heart and brown adipose tissue in Dahl S rats, whereas norepinephrine turnover in Dahl R rats was decreased (p less than 0.01) by the 7% NaCl intake in the heart and kidney. On the high NaCl intake, norepinephrine turnover in heart and adipose tissue was lower (p less than 0.05) in Dahl R rats than in Dahl S rats. In brain stem tissue, with the 1% NaCl diet, norepinephrine turnover was higher (p less than 0.001) in Dahl S rats than in Dahl R rats, and norepinephrine turnover was inhibited (p less than 0.001) by the high NaCl intake in Dahl S rats but not in Dahl R rats. In posterior hypothalamus, norepinephrine turnover was inhibited (p less than 0.01) by the high NaCl intake in Dahl R rats but not in Dahl S rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91210650\r", 
  ".W": "In hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), increased intestinal iron absorption leads to the development of iron overload. To examine the abnormal regulation of iron absorption in this disorder, we analyzed mucosal iron kinetics in six patients with HH and in five normal subjects by using a compartmental model of intestinal iron absorption and systemic ferrokinetics. Subjects were given simultaneous oral and intravenous tracer doses of iron 59-labeled citrate and iron 55-labeled transferrin, respectively. Plasma and whole-body radioactive iron levels were then monitored serially during the next 2 weeks, and mucosal iron transport rate constants were estimated by non-linear least-squares fit of the model to these data. Iron absorption was inversely related to serum ferritin concentration in both normal subjects and patients with HH but was higher in relation to serum ferritin level among the latter (p less than 0.0002). Analysis of mucosal iron kinetics demonstrated a similar inverse relationship between the rate constant for mucosal iron uptake and serum ferritin among all subjects combined, but the mean uptake rate constant in patients with HH did not differ from that of normal subjects (p = 0.71). The mean rate constant for incorporation of iron into the mucosal storage pool in patients with HH also was comparable to that of normal subjects (p = 0.94). In contrast, the rate constant for transfer of mucosal iron to the plasma was higher in patients with HH than in normal subjects for any given serum ferritin level (p less than 0.0001), and the transfer rate constant accounted for 87% of the variability in iron absorption among all subjects. We conclude that the increased iron absorption in HH is mediated primarily by an increase in the rate constant for transfer of mucosal iron to the plasma.\r"

Previously we had demonstrated that immunization with nutritionally variant streptococci (NVS, now referred to as Streptococcus, species defectivus and adjacens) protected rabbits against endocarditis when they were challenged with the homologous strain. However, when high-titer immune globulin was transferred to nonimmunized rabbits, no protection was achieved. In the present study, immunosuppressive treatments were given to previously immunized rabbits, and alterations in the level of protection were determined by using the rabbit endocarditis model. Control-immunized rabbits as well as immunized rabbits receiving cyclosporin A or methylprednisolone treatments were protected from S. defectivus endocarditis at levels between 50% and 67%. Rabbits in each of these groups cleared S. defectivus organisms from the circulation by 3 hours after infection. Nitrogen mustard-treated rabbits (immunized or nonimmunized), however, were unable to clear S. defectivus organisms as efficiently (almost 100 times as many organisms in the blood when compared with other groups) by 3 hours, and all were susceptible to endocarditis. These data suggest that circulating phagocytes such as monocytes and granulocytes function to a certain extent in protection against S. defectivus endocarditis. Moreover, when neutrophils were transfused into granulocytopenic and monocytopenic rabbits, efficient clearance was prolonged, indicating that polymorphonuclear leukocytes were involved in the later (greater than 1 hour after infection) phase of protection.\r"

  ".W": "We have studied the effect of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25, (OH)2D3) on mesangial cell growth. Previous studies have shown that the monocyte-macrophage is the principal effector cell in immune-mediated nephritis; this cell infiltrates the glomerular mesangium, and its products may have important effects on the physiology of the mesangial cell. One of the substances produced by the activated macrophage is 1,25,(OH)2D3. We have investigated the effect of 1,25,(OH)2D3 on mesangial cell growth and found that this vitamin D metabolite suppresses the proliferation of mouse mesangial cells as assessed by mesangial cell tritiated thymidine uptake and by cell counts; this substance also antagonizes the mitogenic effect of epidermal growth factor on mesangial cell growth. By comparison, the vitamin D metabolite 25 hydroxyvitamin D3 has no significant suppressive effect on the proliferation of mesangial cells. It has also been possible to demonstrate that 1,25,(OH)2D3 could suppress the growth of mesangial cells that had been committed to proliferate by the prior addition of epidermal growth factor. The results of these studies are relevant to our understanding of the pathogenesis of the cellular abnormalities that occur in immune-mediated nephritis, and especially in subjects who have concurrent hypertension, because a segment of subjects with hypertension have demonstrable abnormalities in the levels of circulating 1,25,(OH)2D3.\r"

At one year review, the Mini Shah shows a significantly earlier extrusion and a greater tendency to recurrence of otitis media with effusion. However, this is compensated by a decreased incidence of tympanosclerosis and reduced severity in those affected. This tends to support the view that shear forces produced by heavier patterns of ventilation tube promote tympanosclerosis.\r"

The perioperative mortality rate was 3 per cent. Anatomical preservation of the facial nerve was achieved in 89 per cent of tumour removals and a good to normal functional result in 79 per cent of cases. Attempts at hearing preservation have been unsuccessful, largely because of the small number of patients in the series in whom useful hearing was present preoperatively. Complications included major brain stem ischaemia (1.2 per cent), CSF fistula (5 per cent) and facial dysaesthesia (7 per cent). The incidence of mortality and morbidity is directly related to tumour size and to the experience of the surgeons. A number of patients experienced an unusual type of post-operative dreamlike state which appeared to be a form of hypnagogic hallucination, and the possible neurophysiological mechanism responsible for this phenomenon is discussed. The continuing failure to attain the ideal of early diagnosis is lamented, and the importance of a flexible bidisciplinary surgical approach emphasized.\r"

Eighty per cent of the patients with a closed mastoid cavity were satisfied with the aid, and no significant difference was found between the two groups regarding the impression about the aid (chi square 3.06, p = 0.08), or the problems with it, which, in most of the cases, were related to several changes of mould (chi square 2.19, p = 0.13).

The method has, together with nasal expiratory peak flow (NPF) and nasal index based upon a self assessment score, been used to evaluate, in an objective and dynamic way, the effect of systemic treatment of nasal polyps with steroids in a series of eight patients with recurrent nasal polyposis. The study shows a significant relationship between these three parameters before and after systemic treatment of nasal polyps with steroids.

Obstruction in the middle meatus and ostiomeatal complex was associated with an increased incidence of opacity in the sinuses but the primary site of disease was not established: the concept that sinus disease takes origin in the middle meatus was not proven. Anatomical variants in the middle meatus were not associated with an increase in sinus opacity and there was no evidence that these anomalies have any effect on sinus disease by causing middle meatal stenosis. The radiological assessment of patients with inflammatory naso-sinus disease should start with plain X-ray. CT is unnecessary as a routine examination. It should be reserved for the pre-operative assessment of patients for endoscopic surgery, its main function being to show important anatomical landmarks.\r"

This study assessed the efficacy of alginate swabs during tonsillectomy and inferior tonsillar pole ligation in the control of blood loss during tonsillectomy. Ninety-nine tonsillectomy patients were randomized to gauze or alginate swab use. A haemoglobinometer measured blood losses collected by suction during dissection and by swab until haemostasis was secured. Operative time, complications and healing were also assessed. Mean total blood losses and operative times were similar for the two groups. Swab blood loss was significantly lower for surgeons who ligated the lower tonsillar pole, compared with surgeons who used a snare. This finding was independent of swab type. Independent assessment showed no difference in the healing rate. Alginate swabs offer no advantage over gauze in terms of blood loss, operative time or complications of tonsillectomy. The results show that routine lower pole ligation significantly reduces post-dissection blood loss. We suggest that this technique should be more widely adopted.\r"

The main nasal and nasopharyngeal CT findings were soft tissue masses of variable sizes. The lesions were characteristically homogenous, non-enhancing and had distinct edge definition; adjacent fascial planes were not invaded. The subglottic area was involved in laryngeal and tracheal scleroma. The lesions were mainly in the form of concentric irregular narrowing of the airway. In the trachea, crypt-like irregularities were diagnostic of scleroma. Intra-orbital, intra-cranial and infratemporal parapharyngeal scleromatous masses were detected in one patient.\r"

This was carried out in order to investigate whether neuroticism or other personality disorders were characteristics of duodenal ulcer patients, and whether the presence of such possible personality disorders might influence the prognosis of the disease. Neuroticism occurred in 53% of the patients, but only in 5% of controls (P less than 0.0001). Overall, personality disorders were present in 69% of the patients compared with 30% of the controls (P less than 0.0001). Neuroticism was connected with a high frequency of relapse (P less than 0.05) whereas failure of spontaneous ulcer healing had no certain relation to personality disorders. Patients with non-neurotic personality disorders had more frequently suffered stressful life events before entrance to the study (P less than 0.05) and, like the neurotic patients, they had lower ego-strength to cope with such events (P less than 0.05). The results indicate that personality assessments make it possible to distinguish between subgroups of duodenal ulcer patients with different course of the disease.\r"

  ".U": "91210695\r", 
  ".W": "In a previous haemodynamic examination, 44 young men (18-22 years) with blood pressure elevation above the 98th percentile, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) greater than or equal to 95 +/- 6 mm Hg, showed an increased cardiac index (dye-dilution) and an enhanced resistance at maximal vasodilation of the hand (venous occlusion plethysmography during hyperaemia). This latter finding suggested arteriolar wall hypertrophy. However, the subgroup with the highest cardiac index (greater than or equal to 3.86 1 min-1 x m2) (n = 18) displayed normal vascular resistance at maximal dilation in comparison with the normotensive control group (n = 29). Consequently, functional signs of arteriolar hypertrophy were restricted to individuals with normal or low cardiac index. At the re-investigation 5 years later, a significant reduction in blood pressure was observed in the normotensive control group (MAP: from 88 +/- 7 to 85 +/- 7 mm Hg, P less than 0.05). There was no change in individuals with initially elevated blood pressure. Furthermore, cardiac index fell significantly with time in this latter group. Thus, the blood pressure elevation in the hypertensive group, previously mainly dependent on high blood flow was, 5 years later, more related to an increased total peripheral resistance, (delta total peripheral resistance = 8%). However, no definite evidence indicating development of hypertrophy of the resistance vessels of the hand was observed during the follow-up period. Since the hyperkinetic subgroup did not display a concomitant fall in blood pressure with cardiac output, our results do not support the theory that the hyperkinetic form of borderline hypertension is a temporary phenomenon, explained by the inclusion of anxious individuals afraid of the experimental situation. Hyperkinetic hypertension may be the initial phase of sustained hypertension in a subgroup of the future hypertensive population.\r"

In addition, the plasma glucose and insulin responses to an oral glucose load were significantly lower in physically active individuals. Furthermore, fasting plasma triglyceride concentration was significantly lower and the high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentration was higher in the physically active individuals. Thus, substantial benefits in terms of CAD risk were associated with increased leisure-time physical activity.\r"

Pd measurement used a rectal perfused probe and a subcutaneous needle both connected, via agar-KCl bridges, to calomel electrodes and a millivoltmeter. Statistical analysis used Student's t-test for paired and unpaired data and Mann-Whitney U-test as appropriate. Mean rectal pd values were, respectively -43.5 +/- 8.7 mV in control group, -32.9 +/- 10.2 mV in IBS-group I patients (P less than 0.001), -41.3 +/- 12 mV in IBS-group II patients (NS), -21.4 +/- 14.1 mV in IBD patients with rectal involvement (P less than 0.001), and -45.1 +/- 14.3 mV in IBD-group IV patients (NS). A histological examination was performed in 36 IBS patients; mean rectal pd was significantly decreased in patients showing abnormal patterns (n = 27, pd = -31.8 +/- 9 mV) compared to patients with normal mucosa (n = 9, pd = -41.1 +/- 6.5 mV; P less than 0.01). These results show that: (1) potential difference is significantly decreased in patients with ulcerative and rectal involvement; (2) in patients with Crohn's disease, normal rectal pd values do not assess the appearance of colonic mucosa above; (3) patients with IBS and diarrhoea also present a significant diminution in mean rectal pd. Although the mechanisms involved remain unclear, rectal pd measurement appears to be an objective test for intestinal mucosae weakness in functional or inflammatory diseases of the large intestine and rectum.\r"

The observation period was characterized by a significantly lower total nutritional score among surviving (n = 39) patients than among patients who died (n = 9) (Mann-Whitney, P less than 0.001). There was no difference in mortality between the two kinds of dialysis therapy (HD,CAPD). In conclusion, chronic dialysis patients with a poor nutritional status have a highly increased mortality. The presumably causal nature of this relationship makes prevention of protein-caloric malnutrition among dialysis patients a high priority task.\r"

Such pathology would be suspected to be prominent in advanced cases of MVP necessitating open-heart operation. We therefore analysed the prevalence of perivalvular thrombi and episodes of systemic arterial embolism (SE) prior to operation in 21 consecutive patients with MVP and severe valve regurgitation. No perivalvular or left atrial thrombi were found during open-heart surgery, but three of the patients (14%, 3-36% with 95% confidence limits) experienced SE, in one case despite long-term anticoagulation. All cases of SE took place less than 3 months before operation. The results indicate that persistent thrombi are rare in MVP and severe valve regurgitation. However, such patients run a substantial risk of SE when they reach a clinical and haemodynamic stage that makes valve surgery mandatory.\r"

Only, scarce and contradictory data exist about hypocalcaemia associated with bone metastases (BMH). We have reviewed the clinical records of 155 patients with bone metastases of solid tumours, 122 of which were followed during the whole course of the disease until death. The frequency of hypocalcaemia ranged from 5 to 13%, depending on the formula used to correct calcium values for protein concentration. BMH was almost exclusively limited to patients with osteoblastic metastases. The frequency of BMH among patients with prostate carcinoma was 13-27%, depending on the formula used. Only two of 60 patients with lytic bone lesions presented hypocalcaemia, and in both cases it was rather mild. The development of hypocalcaemia did not seem to imply a worse prognosis, at least in patients with carcinoma of the prostate. Thus, the prevalence of BMH appears to be higher than is usually considered. Adequate attention should be given to this disorder because of the potentially deleterious effects on several organ systems.\r"

  ".W": "Ebastine is an H1 antihistamine. Using a double-blind, parallel group randomized study design, the efficacy and the tolerability of oral ebastine (10 mg daily escalating to 40 mg daily according to clinical need) was compared over 4 weeks during 1986 with matching placebo in 40 general practice patients suffering from hayfever. Ebastine (19 patients) was more effective (P less than 0.05) than placebo (21 patients) against symptoms of running nose, itching nose, sneezing and blocked nose. Ebastine was superior to placebo in respect of the total symptom score as well as when judged by the investigators' and the patients' opinion of overall efficacy. Ebastine caused few adverse events, none of which resulted in a patient being withdrawn from treatment. Significantly more patients were withdrawn because of inefficacy from the placebo (n = 12) than from the ebastine (n = 3) treatment group (P less than 0.02). It is concluded that ebastine (10-40 mg daily) is an effective and well tolerated treatment for hayfever.\r"

  ".W": "A review of the United Kingdom (UK) multiple sclerosis (MS) literature suggests that over the last three decades prevalence and estimated incidence rates have increased, while mortality rates have been declining. UK mortality data over a 30 year period have been studied to examine temporal and geographical variations, to estimate changes in survival, and to examine the relationship between mortality and morbidity trends. The study has shown an overall decline in mortality throughout the UK of approximately 25% over the 30 year period ending in 1983, and a reduction in the mortality differential between Scotland, and England and Wales, but no positive correlation has been found between mortality and morbidity. The overall decline in death rate in females was 23% and in males 30% over the 30 years of the survey. The total number of deaths declined by 39% between the five year periods 1954-58 and 1979-83 in Scotland compared with a 10% decline for England and Wales. Estimated median age of death increased from 52 to 59 years and the improvement in survival over the period of study was similar for both countries and is unlikely to have contributed to the reduction in mortality differential. Within England and Wales regional mortality rates did not show a clear north-south gradient. The decline in the mortality differential between Scotland and England (if not artefactual) may provide an important aetiological clue in the search for the cause of multiple sclerosis, and the rate of decline suggests an environmental rather than a genetic aetiology.\r"

Performance in verbal fluency, naming and memory testing appeared to be impaired in MS patients compared with 17 age-sex and education matched normal controls. Weighted periventricular and confluent lesion scores and the width of the third ventricle, proved to be the most sensitive MRI measures in differentiating more cognitively impaired patients from those who were relatively unimpaired. Ratios of regional to whole brain activity, measured by SPECT, showed significant reduction in the frontal lobes and in the left temporal lobe of MS patients. A relationship was found between left temporal abnormality in 99mTc-HMPAO uptake and deficit in verbal fluency and verbal memory. Finally, asymmetrical lobar activity indicated a predominant left rather than right temporo-parietal involvement.\r"

During treatment, classification by linear discriminant analysis was found more often positive than cytology. Possible mechanisms for this difference are discussed. For ventricular CSF a correlation was found between CSF cytology and beta-glucuronidase for solid tumours, and between CSF cytology and beta 2-microglobulin for haematological malignancies. Reference values for ventricular protein, CEA beta-glucuronidase and beta 2-microglobulin were obtained for cytological negative samples.\r"

Electromyographic activity of biceps and triceps and the kinematics of the movements were analysed. Results were compared with those of normal subjects making both rapid and slow movements. In the patients, the first agonist burst of the biceps was frequently prolonged regardless of the distance or speed of the movement. The most striking kinematic abnormality was prolonged acceleration time. The pattern of acceleration time exceeding deceleration time was common in patients but uncommon in normal subjects. The best kinematic correlate of the duration of the first agonist burst was acceleration time. Altered production of appropriate acceleration may therefore be an important abnormality in cerebellar dysfunction for attempted rapid voluntary movements.\r"

The ankle joints of the age-matched normal subjects were flexible over most of the movement range, showing dramatically increasing stiffness only when the foot was dorsiflexed beyond 70 degrees, with a neutral range between 90-100 degrees, and a less dramatic increase in stiffness during plantarflexion. Hemiparetic patients showed identical curves to the normal subjects on the \"healthy\" side, ipsilateral to the causative cerebral lesion, but were significantly stiffer in dorsiflexion on the contralateral side, without change in the minimum stiffness range or during plantarflexion. Therefore significant changes in passive biomechanical properties occur at the affected ankle of hemiparetic subjects, predominantly as the result of a loss of compliance in the Achilles tendon, although an increase in the passive stiffness of the triceps surae may also occur. The contribution of these changes to the locomotor disability of hemiparetic patients is discussed.\r"

During REM sleep dystonic patients had well maintained atonia evidenced by infrequent bursts of submental activity, no episodes of complex semi-purposeful behaviour and reduced motor responses to magnetic stimulation. These findings suggest that the inhibitory centres in the region of the locus coeruleus and their descending pathways to the spinal alpha motor neurons are intact in torsion dystonia.\r"

Those fulfilling operational criteria for depressive illness were also offered tricyclic antidepressants. The rationale was that a distinction be drawn between factors that precipitate the illness and those that perpetuate it. Among the latter are cognitive factors such as the belief that physical symptoms always imply tissue damage, and behavioural factors such as persistent avoidance of activities associated with an increase in symptoms. Therapy led to substantial improvements in overall disability, fatigue, somatic and psychiatric symptoms. The principal problems encountered were a high refusal rate and difficulties in treating affective disorders. Outcome depended more on the strength of the initial attribution of symptoms to exclusively physical causes, and was not influenced by length of illness. These results suggest that current views on both treatment and prognosis in CFS are unnecessarily pessimistic. It is also suggested that advice currently offered to chronic patients, to avoid physical and mental activity, is counterproductive.\r"

  ".W": "Recent advances in Alzheimer's disease imply a need for adequate clinical trials of new treatments which require careful design. The disorder is progressive and shows clinical heterogeneity. While large-scale trials of elderly subjects are appropriate in relation to assessment of drugs or other treatments designed to prevent progression of the disorder, the outcome measurements in such biological treatment trials require careful planning. Studies of individual patients are relevant for answering certain specific questions. Relatively short cross-over trial designs may be appropriate to some pharmacological studies. The choice of neuropsychological instruments for measuring change is critically important, particularly in excluding test/retest artefact and in avoiding floor and ceiling effects. Test scales designed for assessment of specific neuropsychological deficits, or forming part of standard IQ assessments are unlikely to prove robust. Tests can be selected and developed for individual patients, but generalisation of the results of such experiments to the disease as a whole is not inevitable. There is a need to develop psychological instruments for measuring change that are robust and relevant to the clinical problem of progressive dementia.\r"

Compared with the LF diet, the MCT diet did not depress food and energy intake, weight gain, energy and nitrogen retention or lipid deposition and did not produce ketogenesis. The weight gain of rats fed LCT was 25% higher, and increased lipid deposition was observed. Lower lipogenic enzyme activities were observed in rats fed the LF diet containing 4% corn oil than in rats fed the MCT diet containing 1% corn oil. This effect disappeared when rats previously adapted to the LCT diet were fed LF or MCT diets containing 1% corn oil for 21 d. By d 21, in both groups, hepatic malic enzyme, ATP-citrate lyase, acetyl CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase activities were 2.2-, 2.0-, 2.3- and 1.8-fold higher than those of rats fed LCT. Intermediate hepatic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities were observed in rats fed the MCT diet, compared with LCT (40% lower) and LF (1.6-fold higher) diets. These data show that in rats fed a diet in which MCT supplies 32% of metabolizable energy, a high activity of lipogenic enzymes is observed, suggesting that MCT had no inhibitory effect on the activity of these enzymes.\r"

In Experiment 1, a low lipid culture medium was developed that caused an accumulation of (n-9) eicosatrienoic acid in the phospholipids of human fibroblasts. This culture medium, when supplemented with a mixture of mitogens, supported growth of human fibroblasts at a level equivalent to that found under conditions of maximal growth using serum supplementation (8% fetal bovine serum). The triene:tetraene ratio of fibroblast phospholipids under the two conditions was 1.88 vs. 0.03, suggesting that the growth of these cells was not adversely affected by a high (greater than 0.4) triene: tetraene ratio. In Experiment 2, cells were cultured in a low lipid, mitogen-supplemented medium with 16:1(n-7), 18:1(n-9), 18:2(n-6) or 20:4(n-6) added as the albumin complex. All the fatty acids permitted an equivalent maximal growth stimulation in the assay system, although having different effects on the phospholipid triene:tetraene ratio. The results suggest that there is a lack of an association between cellular phospholipid triene:tetraene ratio (range, 0.03 to 3.4) and proliferation of human fibroblasts in this culture system.\r"

Both BHBA and MCFA were highest at 1 h. The MCFA measured at 1 h decreased (P less than 0.01) with increasing chain length. The BHBA was not different in pigs given tri-7:0, 8:0 or 9:0 but was lower (P less than 0.05) for pigs given tri-10:0. Isolated hepatocytes converted [1-14C] C7 or C9 to CO2 and acid soluble products more than 40% faster than cells given 8:0 or 10:0 and consumed 7% more O2. Even- and odd-MCFA were oxidized faster (P less than 0.01) than 18:1 (n-9). Theoretical calculations from fatty acid oxidation accounted for 96 to 142% of measured O2 consumption for the various fatty acids. In all instances, L-carnitine had no effect. Appearance of 14C in lipid products increased progressively with chain length from 7:0 to 18:1 (n-9). Collectively, these data suggest that changes in chain length within the medium-chain family may dramatically influence the rate and extent of digestion and/or absorption and metabolism of medium-chain triglycerides by neonates. This may be a consequence of increased hydrophobicity with increasing chain length or, for odd-chain fatty acids, a reflection of anaplerotic carbon effects from propionyl-CoA metabolism.\r"

Oleate accumulated in lipid products eightfold faster than did 8:0 and 9:0. No differences between cells from SGA and AGA piglets were detected. Recovery of 1-C in CO2 was 48% higher in incubations with cells from 48-h-old than from 6-h-old piglets. This increase was attributable to a 70% higher O2 consumption by 48-h-old cells. Theoretical O2 consumption rates were computed from the fatty acid flux data and compared with measured O2 consumption. Hepatocytes from SGA and AGA piglets were equally capable of satisfying greater than 75% of their energy needs from fatty acid oxidation. The O2 consumption attributable to 9:0 metabolism was 30% higher than observed for 8:0 and 18:1. All fatty acids apparently spared endogenous fuels to a greater degree in 6-h-old than in 48-h-old piglets.\r"

To investigate this theory, rats were fed diets containing either fish oil or corn oil and differing in the amount of fat and cholesterol and in the type of carbohydrate (sucrose vs. glucose) or protein (casein vs. soy protein). The hypotriglyceridemic effect of fish oil vs. corn oil was not influenced by the background composition of the diet. The hypocholesterolemic effect of fish oil was diminished by increasing the amount of coconut fat in the background diet at the expense of an isoenergetic amount of sucrose. With the use of high-cholesterol diets, no cholesterol-lowering effect of fish oil vs. corn oil was observed. This study suggests that the composition of the background diet should be considered when comparing the cholesterolemic effects of fish oil with other oils in various experiments.\r"

Eicosapentaenoic acid in leucocyte phospholipids of fish oil-fed rats was decreased by the addition of each vegetable oil to the dietary fish oil, with sunflower oil, the oil highest in linoleate (LA), having the largest EPA-lowering effect (66% decrease). The rate of synthesis of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) was increased by the addition of each vegetable oil to the basic fish oil diet, with sunflower oil having a significant effect on LTB4 synthesis (145% increase). The effects of olive oil (enriched in oleate) were similar to those of linseed oil (enriched in alpha-linolenic acid) with regard to EPA incorporation (mean decrease = 30%) and LTB4 synthesis (mean increase = 72%). The level of arachidonic acid in leucocyte membranes and the rate of synthesis of LTB4 were proportional to the level of dietary LA added to the basic fish oil diet. The results indicate that olive or linseed oil ingested in combination with fish oil have less effect than does sunflower oil on leucocyte EPA content and LTB4 production. They further suggest that, when ingested with fish oil, dietary linoleic acid is more important than oleate or alpha-linolenic acid as a determinant of these variables.\r"

Rat growth is little improved, however, when OM is added to a low soybean protein isolate (SPI) diet. To evaluate the mechanisms of the different effects of OM supplementation, we observed intestinal absorption of OM added to either an 8 g/100 g casein diet or an 8 g/100 g SPI diet. Using portal and venous cannulated rats under unrestrained conditions, we evaluated OM absorption by subtracting methionine porto-venous differences after feeding the diets without OM from the values after feeding the diets with 3% added OM. OM absorption was faster after feeding the casein-based diet than after the SPI-based diet during the initial stages of the experiment only, but throughout the experiment there were greater increments of methionine concentrations in both portal and venous blood after the casein-based diet than after the SPI-based diet. We also discovered that amino acids from the dietary casein were absorbed faster than those from SPI, using the porto-venous difference of isoleucine as an indication. The larger increment of methionine concentrations in the blood after feeding of OM with a casein diet and the rapid absorption of amino acids from casein may result in much growth improvement in rats.\r"

A purification procedure, involving a chemically-bonded material followed by HPLC combined with fluorometric detection, was used for the quantitative determination of these compounds, allowing the separation of two diastereoisomers of MTCA. An HPLC and mass spectrometry method was also developed for their identification. Comparing the concentration of MTCA and TCCA in fermented products and raw materials suggested that tetrahydro-beta-carbolines may have been produced through fermentation or by condensation of tryptophan and acetaldehyde formed from ethanol added as a food preservative. This is the first report of excretion of tetrahydro-beta-carbolines in human urine and human milk. A comparison of the concentrations of tetrahydro-beta-carbolines in urine from human infants and human milk indicates that tetrahydro-beta-carbolines may be synthesized endogenously in humans. A possible pathway of tryptophan metabolism in plants and animals is presented.\r"

In addition, plasma lipids and chemical composition of lipoproteins were assayed by d 28. The control and the deficient groups were fed 18% and 6% casein diets, respectively. By d 28 the protein-deficient group exhibited hypotriglyceridemia resulting from the decrease in VLDL triacylglycerols; free cholesterol and phospholipids were increased, reflecting the increment in LDL-HLDL1. In plasma total lipoproteins, apo BH, AI and E were not different than controls in the deficient group. Apolipoprotein AIV decreased after d 14 and was significantly less than in controls at d 28. Apolipoprotein BI was considerably reduced by d 14 (43% less) and d 28 (52% less) compared with the control group. Apolipoproteins C + AII were significantly lower in the protein-deficient group by d 14 (43%). By d 28, VLDL apo C were decreased 60% by protein restriction. Transthyretin level was 20% lower in the protein-deficient group by d 7 but returned to control values by d 14. A moderately lower value was observed for albumin by d 7 and d 14 and for transferrin by d 28.

Consumption of a low-protein (9% casein) diet high in leucine or alpha-ketoisocaproate depressed plasma concentrations of isoleucine and valine and their respective keto acids, alpha-keto-beta-methylvalerate and alpha-ketoisovalerate. High dietary levels of alpha-keto-beta-methylvalerate or alpha-ketoisovalerate (but not of isoleucine or valine) depressed plasma concentrations of the other BCKA and their respective branched-chain amino acids (BCAA). Consumption of a low protein, high phenylalanine diet depressed plasma concentrations of both BCAA and BCKA. Brain large neutral amino acid pools of rats fed all low-protein, high-amino acid diets were depleted. Consumption of diets high in individual BCKA increased brain concentrations of aromatic amino acids. In this study of rats allowed to feed for only 6 h/d, elevated brain phenylalanine concentration was associated with a significant depression of food intake, whereas elevated brain BCAA concentrations were not. Also, elevated plasma BCKA concentrations, comparable with those observed in maple syrup urine disease, were accompanied by elevations in concentrations of aromatic amino acids in brain but not in plasma.\r"

  ".W": "This study was conducted to study digestion in rats of a diet containing soybean fiber (chiefly hemicellulose). The animals were first fed a fiber-free high starch diet for 7 d before receiving a 30% soybean fiber diet. There was a progressive change in the cecal pool of volatile fatty acids (VFA), up to approximately 1000 mumol, due to the enlargement of the cecum in conjunction with the rise of the VFA concentration, and the decrease in the cecal pH to 6. In rats fed the soybean fiber diet, the cecal concentrations of acetate and propionate increased with propionate reaching a very high value (approximately 50 mmol/L) after 22 d of dietary treatment. Butyrate concentrations first increased, then declined to about 10 mmol/L. Absorption of VFA was enhanced fivefold between d 2 and d 21 and was then 10-fold higher than in rats fed the fiber-free diet. The transfer of blood urea to the cecum increased in parallel with the enlargement of the cecum and there was a large rise of ammonia absorption after 8 d. There was a rapid increase in the cecal pool of phosphorus, whereas the cecal pools of calcium and magnesium significantly increased only after 8 d. The cecal absorption of calcium and magnesium increased very early, even when the cecal pool of these cations was not enhanced. The soybean fiber diet also elicited a strong induction of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) in cecal mucosa, which was attenuated after 21 d of dietary treatment. Thymidine kinase was smaller than for ODC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Significant starch (11-15%) from peas, lima beans or kidney beans was recovered in the ileal digesta; 0.2-0.4% of starch from rice, corn or AIN-76A was in the ileal digesta. Pretreatment of kidney or lima beans with a heat-stable endo-alpha-amylase decreased the starch recovered in the ileal digesta to 2.7-4.3% of that fed; pretreatment with the amylase and pepsin had no further effect.

Concentrations of Zn, Cu, Mg and Ca were analyzed in maternal and neonatal tissues and in milk; Zn metabolism was studied using 65Zn. Although Cu, Ca and Mg concentrations in milk declined during the first 2 d of lactation, only the concentration of Zn decreased progressively throughout 30 d. Various pup tissues were characterized by developmental changes in concentrations of some elements. Turnover of Zn in neonatal tissues was studied by radiolabeling litters in utero and fostering them at birth to nonradiolabeled lactating dams. The turnover of whole-body 65Zn in suckling mice decreased during development, and, at 20 d of age, the biological half-life of 65Zn in the neonate was approximately the same as for a nonpregnant, nonlactating adult female (20 d). The decreased turnover of 65Zn in lactating dams that characterized progressive lactation and was reflected in the Zn concentration of milk is in agreement with changes in whole-body 65Zn turnover observed for the suckling mouse. These findings demonstrate that the metabolism of the suckling neonate is directly related to longitudinal changes in the composition of maternal milk.\r"

  ".W": "We have demonstrated that the zinc (Zn) concentration of mouse milk declines significantly over the lactation period. Pups radiolabeled in utero with 65Zn were forward-fostered (FF) to nonradiolabeled dams at a later stage of lactation to study the effects of early milk deprivation. Other groups of radiolabeled pups were back-fostered at 5, 10 and 15 days of age to a nonradiolabeled dam who had just given birth; this provided additional colostrum during the suckling period. Litters fostered at birth to an unlabeled dam at d 0 of lactation were used as controls. Weight gain of FF litters decreased and signs of Zn deficiency increased as the foster dam's days of lactation increased. The Zn concentration of kidney, brain and plasma tended to decrease with increasing lactation days of the foster dam. Tibia Zn concentration declined progressively as the lactation days of the foster dam increased, and the concentration of calcium also was lower in all three groups of FF litters than in controls, indicating that bone calcification may have been impaired. Kinetic data proved to be a more sensitive index of Zn status than tissue Zn concentration. The biological half-life of whole-body 65Zn for FF suckling mice increased in a linear fashion with increasing lactation days of the foster dam; whole-body retention of 65Zn for back-fostered litters did not differ from that for controls. Brain, small intestine, kidney muscle, plasma and tibia of pups FF to late-lactating dams seemed to have greater retention of Zn than did controls. Thus, deprivation of early milk impaired growth and development of the mouse neonate despite some ability to conserve Zn.\r"

The foods tested were lettuce, spinach, wheat and sunflower seeds. Lettuce meals and their controls contained 9.65 mumol Mn; other meals contained 22.50 mumol Mn. In addition to the test food or MnCl2, each meal consisted of vegetable oil (5 g), salt (NaCl, 0.15 g) and crackers (10 g), which provided 0.55 mumol Mn. There were no differences in percentage of Mn absorption or biological half-life of 54Mn for any of the intrinsically/extrinsically labeled food pairs. Absorption of 54Mn from MnCl2 (8.90%) was greater than from lettuce (5.20%), spinach (3.81%), wheat (2.16%) or sunflower seeds (1.71%), but the biological half-life did not vary with the source of Mn. Absorption of 54Mn from lettuce was significantly (P less than 0.05) greater than from wheat or sunflower seeds. Although the Mn dose in the test meal was less for lettuce than for the other foods, there was no difference in Mn absorption from MnCl2 between the subjects fed lettuce and subjects fed other foods. There was no correlation of either 54Mn absorption or biological half-life with whole blood or plasma Mn.\r"

We randomly assigned 48, 5-wk-old male Wistar rats to one of six treatment groups. They were fed a low (0.2%) or high (4.0%) Ca diet for 31 wk and given 0, 1.0 or 100 micrograms Pb/mL in drinking water. In the low Ca groups, increasing concentrations of Pb produced graded increases in mean blood pressure. Rats receiving 4.0% Ca had higher mean blood pressures than the animals fed the 0.2% Ca diet. The 4.0% Ca diet also caused renal and urinary bladder stones to develop in some rats. The high Ca diet did not prevent dose-dependent increases in tissue Pb accumulation, but it caused significant decreases in kidney Cu, femur Mg and Fe in kidney, liver and testis. Femur Mg and Fe and liver Fe concentrations were lowest in rats receiving 4.0% Ca and 100 micrograms Pb/mL. Precancerous and cancerous renal lesions occurred to the greatest extent in the rats receiving 100 micrograms Pb/mL and the high Ca diet. These results suggest that high dietary Ca does not protect against Pb-induced increases in blood pressure or Pb accumulation in tissues and may often produce nephrocalcinosis. In addition, high dietary Ca in the presence of Pb may increase the incidence of renal tumors.\r"

Male weanling Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to one of six dietary groups (4, 6, 11, 16, 23 or 40 mg Fe/kg diet) for 6 wk. Hemoglobin, liver iron and transferrin saturation were significantly lower in the 4 and 6 mg Fe/kg diet groups relative to the other groups and were indicative of anemia, low tissue iron stores and impaired erythropoiesis. Fasting blood glucose and heart norepinephrine concentrations were significantly higher and lower, respectively, in the 4 and 6 mg Fe/kg diet groups than the three highest dietary Fe groups. Although fasting blood glucose was significantly inversely correlated (r = -0.89, P = 0.0001) with hemoglobin concentration; a significant quadratic relationship (R 2 = 0.70, P = 0.0001) existed between hemoglobin and heart norepinephrine concentration. Differences in plasma triiodothyronine concentrations and resting oxygen consumption were not significant among the groups. Thus, base on hemoglobin concentration as an index of the severity of iron deficiency, these findings demonstrate that certain physiological manifestations of iron deficiency occur at even moderate-to-mild degrees of anemia.\r"

Eight days after surgery each animal received at 4-d intervals two duodenal infusions for 1 h each of solutions (1000 mL) containing 110 g of mild enzymic milk protein hydrolysate and 440 g of either a maltose-rich glucose syrup (54.6% maltose, 5.2% free glucose) or a maltitol-rich hydrogenated glucose syrup (54.2% maltitol, 6% free sorbitol). For 8 h after the beginning of each infusion, portal blood flow rate was recorded continuously, and blood samples were collected at various intervals (15 to 30 min) for the analysis of aminonitrogen, glucose and sorbitol. Maltitol was hydrolyzed substantially in the small gut. The absorption coefficient of glucose (percentage of infused glucose appearing in the portal blood) was the same 8 h after infusion of maltitol (78.1%) and maltose (78.8%). Sorbitol was poorly absorbed, with an absorption coefficient of 7.2% after 8 h. Its presence in the gut lumen did not inhibit the absorption of glucose. Aminonitrogen from milk oligopeptides appeared more rapidly in the portal vein during the first 4 h after infusion of maltitol than after that of maltose. This was probably due to a reduced competition between absorption of glucose and oligopeptides because of the smaller amount of glucose in the digestive lumen after maltitol hydrolysis.\r"

Total splenic mononuclear cell yield and the relative percentage and absolute number of T-cells and the CD4+ (helper) and CD8+ (cytotoxic) T-subsets were decreased in Cu-deficient male rats. The relative percentage, but not the absolute numbers, of splenic B-cells and macrophages was increased by Cu deficiency. The percentage of splenic mononuclear cells from male rats that expressed interleukin-2 receptors and transferrin receptors in vivo was increased by Cu deficiency. In contrast, dietary Cu deficiency did not affect the yield and phenotypic profile of splenic mononuclear cells in female rats. Reactivity of splenic mononuclear cells to T-cell mitogens was decreased in Cu-depleted male and female rats. However, mitogen-induced increases in levels of interleukin-2 receptor and transferrin receptor were similar in cultures of splenic mononuclear cells obtained from control rats and rats subjected to restricted dietary intake of Cu only during the postlactation period. Thus, decreased mitogenic blastogenesis on exposure of cells from Cu-deficient rats does not reflect a nonspecific impairment of cellular activation.\r"

Injection of the DLAA into the PPC increased intake of the imbalanced diet by 150% and incorporation of [3H]leucine into the trichloroacetic acid insoluble fraction of PPC homogenates by 248%. Coinjection of puromycin (100 mumol/L) or actinomycin D (10 mumol/L) blocked the increase in intake of the imbalanced diet but had no effect on intake of the basal diet. Puromycin blocked the increase in intake of the imbalanced diet whether injected with the DLAA or 6 h later. Selection of the imbalanced diet over a protein-free diet when the DLAA was administered was blocked by co-injecting puromycin or actinomycin D. The results indicated that the increased intake and the reversal of aversion to the imbalanced diet when the DLAA was injected into the PPC required de novo protein synthesis. The proteins necessary for the feeding response seemed to have a short half-life and seemed to require synthesis of new mRNA. We conclude that changes in concentration of the DLAA within the PPC influenced protein synthesis at the genomic level.\r"

In Experiment 1, the time spent in passive nursing and pup grooming was significantly higher for dams rearing previously malnourished pups than for those rearing control litters. In Experiment 2, mixed litters were groomed less frequently than control litters, but there was no significant difference between groups for any other measure. In both experiments, the prenatally malnourished pups showed similar body weight deficits relative to well-nourished pups. These findings underscore the usefulness of mixed litters in studying the later effects of prenatal malnutrition because later deficits in brain function are less likely to be attributable to changes in the early rearing environment.\r"

Postoperative CRP levels were significantly influenced by the time between trauma and surgery. Significant differences were also observed with different types of fixation. Fixation with rigid plates was associated with smaller increases in CRP level than was fixation with miniplates. The location of the fracture, associated condylar fractures, the use of maxillomandibular fixation, the presence or absence of a tooth at the fracture site, and the surgical approach did not affect the CRP levels.

This study includes 1,356 treated patients from 28 departments. The treatment course of 1,201 patients (89.6%) was uneventful. Of the 157 complications, 58 related to the anatomic contour of the mandible, 49 to the surgery, 25 to the prosthetic reconstruction, 8 to the psychosocial attitude of the patient, 8 to the use of medication, 5 to trauma, and 4 to the presence of a skin graft. Treatment of the complications included removal of the implant in 44 patients; in 106 patients the complication was treated satisfactorily. In the remaining 7 patients, hypesthesia was present. The reasons for the removal of the 44 implants were infection (11), operative error (5), premature loading of the implant (3), insufficient width of the mandible after a visor osteotomy (1), loss of osseointegration caused by the prosthesis (14), psychological problems (4), trauma (3), drug-related gingival hyperplasia (2), and inexplicable pain (1). The present survey shows a consistent success rate of 96.8%.\r"

Three weeks after the primary tumors were controlled cryosurgically, 48 patients underwent radical neck dissections. All patients were observed for 3 to 10 years. After cryosurgery, the primary lesion disappeared in 45 (90%) patients; 5 were not controlled. The 3- and 5-year survival rates were 71.9% (23/32) and 72.3% (13/18), respectively. The recurrence rate in this series was 10% (5/50). Cryosurgery for tongue carcinoma was shown to be effective and safe.\r"

They participate in at least four mechanisms that aid in preventing vascular occlusion by platelet plugs or fibrin deposition. These mechanisms include the fibrinolytic pathway, the enhancement of action of endogenous inhibitors of coagulation, the inhibition of cofactors required for fibrin formation, and the synthesis and release of platelet inhibitors. Thus, the endothelium can no longer be viewed merely as a passive barrier separating the blood from the interstitial matrix. Instead, it must be viewed as an active participant in the maintenance of blood fluidity and the prevention of thrombogenesis.\r"

Although reactions of this type are relatively rare, they may sometimes manifest themselves in aggressive behavior accompanied by suicidal or homicidal tendencies. It appears that these reactions occur more commonly in younger patients, although the elderly (above 65 years) may also be at risk. Many mechanisms have been postulated, but none truly explain how these reactions arise. The concept that central cholinergic mechanisms may play a role, however, remains attractive and stems primarily from physostigmine's ability to successfully reverse this type of reaction. The potential role of the benzodiazepine antagonists, eg, flumazenil, in reversing disinhibitory reactions is also discussed. Apart from patients who previously exhibited poor impulse control, there are no reliable indicators for recognizing potential candidates for this type of reaction. To minimize the occurrence of disinhibitory reactions, some guidelines, which include the avoidance of certain drug combinations, the use of low doses of benzodiazepines, slow incremental intravenous administration, and good rapport with patients, are presented.\r"

SETTING: Seven pediatric tertiary care centers. PATIENTS: Consecutive sample of 280 patients with KD and 42 comparison patients examined within the first 14 days after onset of fever. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: (1) Infectious diseases, particularly measles and group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection, most closely mimicked KD and accounted for 35 (83%) of 42 patients in the comparison group. (2) The standard diagnostic clinical criteria for KD were fulfilled in 18 (46%) of 39 patients in whom other diagnoses were established. (3) Patients with KD were significantly less likely to have exudative conjunctivitis or pharyngitis, generalized adenopathy, and discrete intraoral lesions, and more likely to have a perineal distribution of their rash. The patients with KD were also more likely to have anemia and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate; leukocyte count less than 10 X 10(3)/mm3 and platelet count less than 200 X 10(3)/mm3 were significantly less prevalent in patients with KD. (4) Residence within 200 yards of a body of water was more common among KD patients. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Measles and streptococcal infection should be excluded in patients examined for possible KD. (2) Laboratory studies that may be useful in discriminating patients with KD from those with alternative diagnoses include hemoglobin concentration, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and serum alanine aminotransferase activity. (3) Residence near a body of water may be a risk factor for the development of KD.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the benefit of screening for anemia in infants in relation to their previous diet. The iron status of 854 nine-month-old infants on three different feeding regimens and on a regimen including iron dextran injection was determined by analysis of hemoglobin, serum ferritin, and erythrocyte protoporphyrin levels and of serum transferrin saturation. Infants were categorized as having iron deficiency if two or three of the three biochemical test results were abnormal and as having iron deficiency anemia if, in addition, the hemoglobin level was less than 110 gm/L. The prevalence of iron deficiency was highest in infants fed cow milk formula without added iron (37.5%), intermediate in the group fed human milk (26.5%), much lower in those fed cow milk formula with added iron (8.0%), and virtually absent in those injected with iron dextran (1.3%). The corresponding values for iron deficiency anemia were 20.2%, 14.7%, 0.6%, and 0%, respectively. The use of iron supplements is therefore justified in infants fed cow milk formula without added iron, even when there is no biochemical evidence of iron deficiency. The low prevalence of iron deficiency in the group fed iron-fortified formula appears to make it unnecessary to screen routinely for anemia in such infants. These results also support the recommendation that infants who are exclusively fed human milk for 9 months need an additional source of iron after about 6 months of age.\r"

Therefore we evaluated the renal functional reserve in 12 long-term survivors of Wilms tumor after unilateral nephrectomy (mean +/- SE: 15 +/- 1.1 years; range 9 to 23 years). We measured the creatinine clearance before and after an acute, oral protein load to determine the renal functional reserve. Study subjects and control subjects were matched for age, gender, and body surface area. The basal creatinine clearances were similar (Wilms group 132 +/- 13 vs control group 142 +/- 11 ml/min/1.73 m2; p = not significant (NS]. There was no significant difference in the renal functional reserve between long-term survivors of Wilms tumor and matched control subjects (Wilms group 17 +/- 11 vs control group 25 +/- 11 ml/min/1.73 m2; p = NS). The change in creatinine clearance was not secondary to volume expansion because the fractional excretion of sodium was unchanged with protein loading (Wilms group before loading 0.92 +/- 0.12 vs after loading 0.99 +/- 0.13 (p = NS); control group before loading 0.91 +/- 0.12 vs after loading 1.0 +/- 0.14 (p = NS)). We conclude that up to 15 years after nephrectomy for unilateral Wilms tumor in childhood, there is no evidence of hyperfiltration injury.\r"

Four patients with osteoporosis, 10 to 14 years of age, were treated only with 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 and served as control subjects. Both groups were treated with an almost equal amount of glucocorticoids previously and during this study period. Bone mineral content of the spine was measured by a quantitative computed tomographic technique. The bone mineral content was preserved in both cortical and spongeous areas of the vertebrae during the 16-month period in the calcitonin-treated group but was decreased significantly in the control group. Urinary hydroxyproline and calcium excretion decreased significantly in the calcitonin-treated group. The serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations and the parathyroid function did not change significantly in either group. We conclude that calcitonin suppressed bone resorption and might be useful for the long-term treatment of osteoporosis, in combination with 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3, in children with nephrosis requiring long-term glucocorticoid therapy.\r"

  ".W": "We performed oral glucose tolerance tests (oGTTs) on 15 children who had functioning renal allografts received greater than or equal to 18 months previously, had adequate renal function, and had heights greater than 2.5 SD below the mean height for age. Three of the children had impaired glucose tolerance; their mean glucose levels during the last 2 hours of the oGTT were higher (p less than 0.05) than published control values. Integrated glucose concentrations correlated inversely with the prednisone dose on the first day of an alternate-day dosage schedule (R2 = 0.383) and directly with adiposity (partial R2 = 0.322). The integrated insulin concentration correlated directly with the prednisone dose on day 1 of an alternate-day regimen (R2 = 0.355) and with age (partial R2 = 0.163). In 10 children with renal transplants who had been treated with growth hormone for greater than or equal to 6 months, the mean fasting glucose concentration, integrated glucose concentration, and integrated insulin concentration during the oGTTs obtained after 6 months or 12 months of growth hormone treatment were not significantly different (p greater than 0.05) from values measured before the treatment. We conclude that increased integrated concentrations of both glucose and insulin during oGTTs in children with renal allografts correlate with the dose of prednisone administered on the first day of an alternate-day schedule, with age, and with adiposity index. Growth hormone treatment of children with renal allografts who are growing poorly does not significantly affect glucose metabolism as assessed by oGTT.\r"

  ".U": "91210963\r", 
  ".W": "To characterize pancreatic endocrine secretion and to examine interrelationships among alterations in alpha, beta, and pancreatic polypeptide cell function in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), we studied 19 patients with exocrine insufficiency (EXO), including 9 receiving insulin therapy (EXO-IT); 10 patients with no exocrine insufficiency (NEXO); and 10 normal control subjects. First-phase C-peptide response to intravenously administered glucose was significantly impaired in CF patients with exocrine insufficiency (EXO-IT = 0.02 +/- 0.01; EXO = 0.11 +/- 0.02; NEXO = 0.25 +/- 0.05; control subjects = 0.30 +/- 0.04 nmol/L). Lowering fasting glucose levels with exogenous insulin administration in EXO-IT did not improve beta cell responsivity to glucose. The C-peptide response to arginine was less impaired (EXO-IT = 0.12 +/- 0.02; EXO = 0.15 +/- 0.02; NEXO = 0.23 +/- 0.06; control subjects = 0.28 +/- 0.04 nmol/L). Alpha cell function, measured as peak glucagon secretion in response to hypoglycemia, was diminished in EXO but not NEXO (EXO-IT = 21 +/- 10; EXO = 62 +/- 19; NEXO = 123 +/- 29; control subjects = 109 +/- 12 ng/L). Despite diminished glucagon response, EXO patients recovered normally from hypoglycemia. Peak pancreatic polypeptide response to hypoglycemia distinguished CF patients with exocrine insufficiency from those without exocrine insufficiency (EXO-IT = 3 +/- 2; EXO = 3 +/- 1; NEXO = 226 +/- 68; control subjects = 273 +/- 100 pmol/L). Thus CF patients with exocrine disease have less alpha, beta, and pancreatic polypeptide cell function than CF patients without exocrine disease. These data suggest either that exocrine disease causes endocrine dysfunction in CF or that a common pathogenic process simultaneously and independently impairs exocrine and endocrine function.\r"

  ".W": "Helper T-cell function was evaluated in 34 children infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1, by assessing interleukin-2 production after stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with recall antigens (influenza virus, tetanus toxoid), allogeneic HLA, and phytohemagglutinin. In addition, helper T-cell function was correlated retrospectively with the incidence of opportunistic and bacterial infections. Four patterns of helper T-cell function were observed: (1) 7 (21%) of the 34 children responded to all stimuli, (2) 7 (21%) of them responded to alloantigens and phytohemagglutinin but not to recall antigens, (3) 7 (21%) responded to phytohemagglutinin but not to recall antigens or alloantigens, and (4) 13 (37%) did not respond to any of these stimuli. There were no significant differences related to different routes of acquisition among patients. Patients with functional helper T-cell defects had a history of more opportunistic (p = 0.03) and bacterial (p less than 0.001) infections than did patients with intact helper T-cell function. Thus distinct patterns of helper T-cell dysfunction exist in children infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and correlate with higher frequency of infections. Comparisons of in vitro helper T-cell responses to these stimuli may be useful for detecting early functional helper T-cell defects and for monitoring progression of disease.\r"

One hundred twenty-nine ELBW survivors (90%) were available; their mean birth weight was 839 +/- 124 gm and mean gestational age 27 +/- 2.1 weeks, and 48 of them weighed less than or equal to 800 gm at birth. Both ELBW and control groups were tested at a mean unadjusted age of 8 years; 113 of 129 ELBW children completed the full test battery, eight blind children had other tests, and eight were not testable. The mean Full Scale IQ (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children--Revised) was 91 +/- 16 for ELBW children and 104 +/- 12 for control children (p less than 0.0001). Between 8% and 12% of the ELBW group scored in the \"abnormal\" range (less than or equal to -2 SD) on the Wechsler IQ and subtests, compared with 1% to 2% of the control group. The ELBW group did less well on the reading, spelling, and mathematics tests (Wide Range Achievement Test--Revised less than or equal to -2 SD: ELBW = 20% to 28%; control = 3% to 10%). The motor performance of the ELBW group (Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency less than or equal to -2 SD: ELBW = 20%; control = 1%) and their visual-motor integration (Beery Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration less than or equal to -2 SD: ELBW = 21%; control = 6%) were also poorer. Exclusion of 19 ELBW children with neurologic impairments or an IQ less than or equal to 70 or both did not result in significant improvement in Wechsler or achievement measures. Approximately 15% of the ELBW cohort performed in the abnormal range on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, compared with none of the control group. Although approximately two thirds of the ELBW group were performing in the normal range on intellectual measures, comparison with the control group suggests that, as a group, ELBW children were significantly disadvantaged on every measure tested.\r"
