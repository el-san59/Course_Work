Seven (47%) cases, all phenotypic females, had gonadal tumors: gonadoblastoma (5), germinoma (4), malignant intratubular germ cell neoplasia (1), and a unique gonadal stromal tumor (1). Gonadoblastoma was found in 4 of 10 testes and 4 of 17 streak gonads, and associated with germinoma in 4 cases. One patient developed grade 1 endometrial adenocarcinoma after estrogen therapy. Cardiovascular diseases (ie, bicuspid aortic valve, and a unique right aortic arch with a retroesophageal arch segment, aberrant left subclavian artery, coarctation, and dissection) are documented in our series. At the time of diagnosis of mixed gonadal dysgenesis, removal of streak gonads or testes will prevent further gonadal tumor development Cardiovascular examination may identify treatable and potentially lethal disease.\r"

The GCs were evaluated for number, diameter, perimeter, and cross-sectional area using a computerized interactive morphometric analysis. The GCs ranged from 2 to 19 per case, with an average diameter of 0.02 to 0.43 mm, a perimeter of 0.38 to 1.35 mm, and a cross-sectional area of 0.01 to 0.14 mm2. In thymic sections with fewer than five GCs, the GCs had a mean area of 0.05 mm2, a perimeter of 0.84 mm, and a diameter of 0.24 mm. In thymic sections containing five or more GCs, the GCs had a mean area of 0.04 mm2, a perimeter of 0.62 mm, and a diameter of 0.19 mm. The clinical improvement in these patients inversely correlated with the above parameters, with improvement being observed in patients whose GCs had a mean area of 0.02 mm2, a perimeter of 0.58 mm, and a diameter of 0.17 mm. No correlation was observed between the number of GCs and clinical improvement. The results of our study appear to indicate that computerized interactive morphometric analysis may represent a potentially useful method for the evaluation of the morphometric features of thymic GCs and their correlation with clinical outcome in patients with myasthenia gravis.\r"

Sixteen tumors (21%) produced metastases, all discovered initially; 3 patients (4%) died from metastatic disease (mean survival, 37 months postoperatively). Features associated with metastatic risk were involvement of muscularis propria, size greater than 2 cm, and the presence of mitotic figures. For 51 tumors, there was no correlation between immunohistochemical somatostatin and history of diarrhea, cholelithiasis, or diabetes mellitus (somatostatin syndrome). Five tumors were associated with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and had immunohistochemical gastrin, but in the others there was no correlation between ulcer disease and gastrin positivity. Duodenal carcinoids are indolent, especially when small and localized to the submucosa. Immunohistochemical identification of somatostatin and gastrin has little clinical relevance.\r"

The cytologic features of fine-needle aspirates (FNAs) of HPCs have only rarely been described in the literature. We examined FNAs of malignant HPCs from the head and neck region (three) and the retroperitoneum (one) in four adults (aged 38 to 83 years). All four FNAs yielded cellular specimens that consisted of uninuclear tumor cells with high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratios. The cytomorphological spectrum included nuclei that were oval to elongate and had very finely granular, evenly distributed chromatin with one or two small but distinct nucleoli. Hemangiopericytomas yield aspirates that may be considered malignant and may suggest sarcoma. Histologically, all four neoplasms manifested high mitotic activity. The ultrastructural features of all four tumors were supportive of the diagnosis of HPC. Although a specific primary diagnosis of HPC on FNA of a soft-tissue mass is unlikely, cytologic analysis may allow diagnosis of recurrent or metastatic HPC. We were able to perform flow cytometric determinations of tumor DNA content on three of the resected neoplasms. In two, an aneuploid pattern was found, including the neoplasm with the most marked pleomorphism in the FNA. The third was diploid.\r"

The products amplified from EBV templates were detected by hybridization with a labeled probe specific for this highly conserved, reiterated region. Epstein-Barr virus-related sequences were detected in the spleen of a patient with infectious mononucleosis, in lung and lymph node specimens from a patient with pulmonary manifestations of infectious mononucleosis, in various tissues from seven immunosuppressed organ transplant recipients with immunoproliferative disorders, and in small biopsy specimens from a patient with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. No viral sequences were detected in 20 histologically normal spleens or 10 lymph nodes. Polymerase chain reaction technology provides an effective means for documenting EBV infection in archival tissues. This approach should facilitate the diagnosis of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders and difficult cases of infectious mononucleosis and nasopharyngeal carcinoma.\r"

Complete blood cell counts and leukocyte differential cell counts were compared in healthy white (n = 663), black (n = 697), Latin-American (n = 535), and Asian (n = 247) adults. Women had significantly lower red blood cell counts, hemoglobin levels, and hematocrits than men. In addition, women in at least three racial/ethnic groups, had higher platelet, white blood cell, and granulocyte counts and lower monocyte counts than men. Among blacks and Latin Americans, women had lower mean corpuscular volumes, mean corpuscular hemoglobin levels, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentrations than men. The following racial/ethnic differences were found: higher red blood cell distribution widths and lymphocyte and monocyte counts, and lower hemoglobin levels, hematocrits, mean corpuscular hemoglobin levels, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentrations, and white blood cell, granulocyte, and band counts among blacks; higher white blood cell, granulocyte, and band counts among Latin Americans; and higher red blood cell and lower lymphocyte and monocyte counts among Asians than one or more of the other three groups. We concluded that the complete blood cell counts and leukocyte differential cell counts exhibit marked heterogeneity and that reference ranges that reflect the proper racial, ethnic, and sex group should be developed for these parameters.\r"

There are important immunologic similarities between primary SS and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. To investigate for a possible immune response to retroviral proteins in primary SS, we performed immunoblotting against human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) proteins using sera from 47 patients with primary SS. Moderate-to-strong reactivity, suggesting the presence of serum antibodies, was found in 14 patients (30%). Of 120 normal subjects, only 1 showed moderate positivity. All 14 positive SS sera reacted against p24 (gag) but failed to react against gp41 or gp120 (env). This response did not reflect hypergammaglobulinemia since immunoglobulin concentrations among the 29 SS patients studied were the same in sera that contained and sera that did not contain anti-gag reactivity. Two sera also reacted against p17 gag. Four reacted against HIV-2 core proteins, but none reacted with core proteins of human T lymphotropic virus-I. Only 1 of the 14 sera reacted against Ro (SS-A), and 1 other reacted against La (SS-B). These results identify a subset of SS patients characterized by 1) the presence of serum antibodies to HIV-1 group-specific, but not type-specific, proteins, and 2) the relative absence of anti-Ro (SS-A) and anti-La (SS-B) autoantibodies. In this latter respect, these SS patients constitute a subpopulation that resembles patients with HIV-induced SS-like disease.\r"

Women with RA were compared with 2 separate control groups, women with osteoarthritis (OA) and women randomly selected from a population-based electoral register. Nulliparity was found to be a risk factor for the development of RA, with age-adjusted odds ratios of 1.82 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09-3.03) versus the OA control group and 1.83 (95% CI 1.03-3.06) versus the population control group. Use of OCPs before the age of 35 was negatively associated with RA (odds ratio 0.56, 95% CI 0.29-1.12 versus the OA control group; odds ratio 0.6, 95% CI 0.30-1.17 versus the population control group). Some evidence of a duration-response effect was seen, although the numbers were small. The 2 variables were also multiplicative, with nulliparous non-OCP users having a 4-fold risk of RA compared with parous OCP users. These findings suggest that pregnancy and OCP use have a \"protective effect\" on the development of RA, although the mechanism remains unclear.\r"

Some RA patients displayed highly elevated levels of hyaluronic acid (HA), while others exhibited normal levels. There was a significant inverse correlation between OM and KS content in RA patients, as well as a direct correlation between HA and OM. In longitudinal studies of RA patients, parallel changes in OM and HA and inverse changes between KS and OM or HA were commonly observed. Clinical analyses revealed that there was an inverse correlation between KS and morning stiffness, and direct correlations between the number of tender joints and HA, and between HA or the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the number of joints with effusions. The reason(s) for the inverse correlation between KS and OM as an index of systemic inflammation remains to be established. Circulating HA represents an index of joint inflammation, for which a marker has not been previously available.\r"

Polyclonal RF were derived from patients with RA. The carbohydrate located on the Fc fragment, regardless of whether it contained different amounts of mannose or reduced amounts of galactose, or was removed, did not affect the binding of the RF. In contrast, the isotype of the Fc was found to be critical. Two groups of hybridoma RF could be delineated. One group bound preferentially to IgG1 and/or IgG2, and a second group (primarily from patients with RA) bound preferentially to IgG3 and/or IgG4. Our results indicate that the isotype of the Fc fragment, and not the extent of galactosylation, influences the binding of the RF.\r"

Clinical evaluations were performed at baseline and every 6 weeks thereafter, and immunologic variables were measured at baseline and after 24 weeks of study. The 3 groups of patients were matched for age, sex, disease severity, and use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Subjects continued receiving DMARDs and other background medications without change during the study. Twenty patients consumed daily dietary supplements of n3 fatty acids containing 27 mg/kg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 18 mg/kg docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (low dose), 17 patients ingested 54 mg/kg EPA and 36 mg/kg DHA (high dose), and 12 patients ingested olive oil capsules containing 6.8 gm of oleic acid. Significant improvements from baseline in the number of tender joints were noted in the low-dose group at week 24 (P = 0.05) and in the high-dose group at week 18 (P = 0.04) and 24 (P = 0.02). Significant decreases from baseline in the number of swollen joints were noted in the low-dose group at weeks 12 (P = 0.003), 18 (P = 0.002), and 24 (P = 0.001) and in the high-dose group at weeks 12 (P = 0.0001), 18 (P = 0.008), and 24 (P = 0.02). A total of 5 of 45 clinical measures were significantly changed from baseline in the olive oil group, 8 of 45 in the low-dose fish oil group, and 21 of 45 in the high-dose fish oil group during the study (P = 0.0002). Neutrophil leukotriene B4 production decreased by 19% from baseline in the low-dose fish oil group (P = 0.0003) and 20% in the high-dose group (P = 0.03), while macrophage interleukin-1 production decreased by 38.5% in the olive oil group (P not significant), 40.6% in the low-dose group (P = 0.06), and 54.7% in the high-dose group (P = 0.0005). Tritiated thymidine incorporation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells after stimulation with concanavalin A increased significantly in all 3 groups after 24 weeks, compared with baseline values. We conclude that the clinical benefits of dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids are more commonly observed in patients consuming higher dosages of fish oil for time intervals that are longer than those previously studied. Dietary supplementation with olive oil is also associated with certain changes in immune function, which require further investigation.\r"

These effects included: small patella (2 joints), patellar osteochondritis dissecans (1 joint), periarticular calcification (9 joints), intraarticular tibial bony spur (1 joint), avascular necrosis of the distal radial epiphysis (2 joints), and avascular necrosis of the proximal femoral epiphysis (1 joint). Only the latter possible complication was symptomatic. Serial radiographs of 76 joints of 30 children showed mild progressive changes compatible with the underlying disease, except in the hip joint, where changes were more severe. The intraarticular injection of triamcinolone hexacetonide is a procedure that appears to be associated with an acceptably low frequency of radiologic abnormalities for many joints in children with chronic arthritis, but its effects on the hip joint remain uncertain.\r"

  ".W": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can produce profound disturbances in the central nervous system, characterized by encephalopathy, focal neurologic deficits, cerebral infarction, psychosis, and seizures. We used 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the in vivo levels of high-energy phosphates in the central nervous system of 10 patients with SLE and 10 age-matched normal controls. 31P NMR spectroscopy was performed on a 1.5-Tesla unit equipped with a dual-tuned 1H-31P surface coil and a software-directed DRESS (depth resolved surface coil spectroscopy) pulse sequence. This procedure detected ADP, ATP, sugar phosphates, phosphocreatine (PCr), inorganic phosphate, phosphomonoesters, and phosphodiesters in the brain tissue of all study subjects. Levels of ATP in the deep white matter of 10 SLE patients were significantly decreased compared with the levels in 10 normal controls, as quantitated by the ratio of ATP:ATP + ADP (mean +/- SD 0.81 +/- 0.11 versus 0.91 +/- 0.05; P less than 0.02). In a subgroup of 4 patients, PCr levels were decreased to a greater extent than the ATP levels. NMR spectroscopic alterations were not related to obvious anatomic lesions, as determined by standard cranial proton magnetic resonance imaging. In 4 SLE patients with markedly abnormal 31P NMR spectra, treatment with prednisone (80 mg/day) normalized the levels of ATP and PCr. Restoration of a normal 31P profile was accompanied by an obvious improvement in the patients' mental status and clinical symptoms. 31P NMR spectroscopy is a powerful new technique for monitoring high-energy phosphate metabolism, and may be particularly useful for characterizing central nervous system disease in patients with neuropsychiatric SLE.\r"

The 3 categories, anti-(U1)RNP, anti-(U1, U2)RNP, and anti-Sm, all contain a common antibody specificity directed against the U1 snRNP-associated A protein. To determine the specificity of anti-U1 snRNP A protein antibodies for various antigenic sites, we tested 26 different anti-snRNP-positive sera for reactivity with fragments of the U1 snRNP A protein, which was produced using recombinant DNA technology. Several different fragments were shown to contain autoimmune-reactive epitopes, which indicates that the antibody response against the U1 snRNP A protein is polyclonal. Antibodies against a discontinuous or conformational epitope were found in most of the sera tested, regardless of whether they were classified as anti-(U1)RNP, anti-Sm, or anti-(U1, U2) RNP. These results strongly support the hypothesis that the anti-snRNP autoimmune response is antigen driven.\r"

The pharmacokinetics of 2 separate doses of MTX (orally and intravenously) were assessed (dosage 10 mg/m2). No substantive differences in the pharmacokinetics were found between pre- and post-cholecystotomy MTX treatment, including clearance rates, volumes of distribution, and terminal half-lives. The results, however, demonstrated a change in the bioavailability of the drug (decreasing from 84.7% to 38.9%). Based on extrapolations of the data, with assumed rates of bile flow, the findings also suggest that there is substantial biliary elimination of MTX (8.7-26.0%) and its principal 7-hydroxy metabolite (1.5-4.6%).\r"

This prospective study was designed to test the safety and efficacy of intraoral nifedipine therapy in 50 patients with severe hypertension being transported by an urban emergency medical service system. Ten milligrams of nifedipine were administered. Serial blood pressure determinations were obtained at 3, 5, 10, and 15 minutes and patients were observed for possible side effects. A marked effect on systolic blood pressure (SP), diastolic blood pressure (DP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) was evident and was statistically significant in all three categories by 3 minutes. MAP decreased from 169 to 129 mm Hg (delta MAP of 40 mm Hg) at 15 minutes with parallel changes in the SP (55 mm Hg) and delta DP (32 mm Hg). These changes were highly significant (P less than .01) when compared with those of 50 historical controls. No evidence of severe adverse effects were noted. Nifedipine appears to be a promising agent for the prehospital treatment of severe hypertension, but its proper role is not yet defined.\r"

Seventy-nine patients with a mean age of 64.3 years were entered into the study. The average theophylline level was 10.8 micrograms/mL. Forty-seven percent of the patients had subtherapeutic levels, 46% had therapeutic levels, and 7% had toxic levels. There were weak although statistically significant correlations between the theophylline level and the interval since the last theophylline dose (r = -.40, P less than .001), as well as with the last recorded outpatient theophylline level (r = .45, P less than .001). However, the theophylline level could not be predicted accurately in a number of patients.

The authors studied CBF before and after the acute treatment of severe hypertension (diastolic blood pressure greater than 115 mm Hg) with clonidine in 13 patients. One patient did not reach goal blood pressure (diastolic blood pressure 105 mm Hg or a decrease by 30 mm Hg) after clonidine alone. In the remaining 12 patients, oral clonidine reduced supine blood pressure from 201.7 +/- 5.0/126.3 +/- 2.1 mm Hg to 149.4 +/- 5.3/96.8 +/- 1.7 mm Hg over an average time period of 85 +/- 7 minutes. Although mean CBF for the group did not change (72.6 +/- 4.2 v 73.7 +/- 3.5 mL/100 mg/min), a significant (greater than 10%) change occurred in 9 of the 12 patients (5 increases and 4 reductions). The magnitude and direction of the change were dependent upon initial CBF (r = -0.65, P less than .05); patients with low pretreatment CBF experienced an increase, whereas those with high initial flow exhibited a decrease. No significant adverse effects were observed. These data confirm previous reports that clonidine is effective in the acute treatment of severe hypertension and demonstrate that its effects on CBF are determined by the pretreatment levels of flow.\r"

Lifting caused 58/93 (62.4%) of back injuries, and most occurred at the scene to which personnel were dispatched (58/93, 62.4%). The back injuries were recurrent in 31% of personnel. The data showed trends toward higher overall injury rates among EMTs compared with paramedics (0.83 v 0.55, P = 0.057) and women compared with men (0.86 v 0.50, P = 0.11). There was a significantly higher injury rate among personnel less than 30 years of age compared with those 30 years or older (0.65 v 0.39, P = 0.01). Over 25% of the personnel injured had more than one injury per year. There was no correlation between injury rates and job experience. Approximately 96 injuries accounted for 481 compensation days with low back strain the cause of 375 days (78%). Our findings suggest a high incidence of occupational injury in EMS personnel with EMTs and persons under 30 years of age at higher risk. Guidelines for prevention programs are suggested.\r"

Their response times for basic life support and advanced life support were 5.5 and 10.7 minutes, respectively. The initial cardiac rhythm in 144 patients (68%) was ventricular fibrillation. In 79 of these patients, cardiopulmonary resuscitation was successful, and 39 patients (27%) were discharged from hospital. The patients who survived had shorter response times for basic life support and their arrest locations was more often outside home, compared with the nonsurvivors. The results seem comparable with emergency medical systems in the United States, but a need to reduce response times is identified.\r"

Regression analyses showed significant effects of gender (R2 = 0.48; P less than .01), systolic blood pressure (R2 = 0.21; P less than .01) and age (R2 = 0.10; P less than .05) on LVMI but did not show an effect for either diastolic blood pressure or caloric expenditure. Monozygotic twins showed smaller within-pair differences (7 +/- 5) than DZ twins (17 +/- 11) for LVMI following adjustment for gender, systolic blood pressure and age (P less than .03). The intraclass correlation for MZ twins was 0.90 (P less than .01) and 0.33 (P = NS) for DZ twins. These results indicate that both genetic and environmental factors are important determinants of left ventricular mass in blacks, independent of gender, blood pressure and age.\r"

Thirty-eight percent of these patients had systolic work blood pressures that were more than 10 mm Hg above their clinic blood pressures. These patients did not differ from other patients in terms of the demographic or clinical factors which were assessed. Need for control and anger, two core features of the Type A Coronary-prone Behavior Pattern, were shown to discriminate these patients on a statistically reliable basis. Research on cardiovascular reactivity to stress suggests that such patients with elevated systolic work blood pressures may be at greater risk for cardiac morbidity and mortality.\r"

  ".W": "Three cohorts of men aged 40 to 59 at entry, for a total of 2480 subjects, were examined for the measurement of some cardiovascular risk factors and then followed-up for 20 years. Changes of systolic blood pressure (SBP) over the first 10 years in 2088 men and computed by an integral-like procedure (delta-SBP) were used as possible predictors of fatal events recorded in the second 10 years of follow-up. Men who had a relative increase of systolic blood pressure in the first 10 years showed an excess risk of death as compared to those who had a relative decrease of systolic blood pressure (adjusted for age and for SBP at entry levels). The relative risk between the two groups was 1.38 for all causes of mortality (ALL), 1.50 for the pool of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease mortality (ACVD), 1.68 for coronary heart disease deaths (CHD) and 1.19 for stroke deaths (STR). These relative risks are all statistically significant except for strokes. The Cox model was solved using the same four end-points as dependent variables (ALL, ACVD, CHD, STR, separately) and as covariates some risk factors measured at entry examination (age, cigarettes smoked per day, body mass index, serum cholesterol, physical activity at work, systolic blood pressure) and, in addition, the indicator of SBP changes (delta-SBP). By adding delta-SBP the predictive power of the model was significantly improved and the coefficient of delta-SBP proved to be statistically significant (P less than .05). This was true for all end points except stroke.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In isolated perfused mesenteric vasculatures prepared from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), the effects of diltiazem on norepinephrine release from vascular adrenergic neurons and pressor responses were examined. The influences of extracellular Ca2(+)-reduction on these responses were also studied. Stimulation evoked pressor responses and norepinephrine release were significantly greater in the mesenteric vasculatures of SHR than in those of WKY. Diltiazem inhibited both pressor responses and norepinephrine release during electrical nerve stimulation in a dose-dependent manner. The suppression of these responses was more pronounced in SHR than in WKY. Reduction of extracellular Ca2(+)-concentration also decreased the responses in SHR and WKY, and the inhibitory degree was significantly greater in SHR than in WKY. These results demonstrate that diltiazem affected the presynaptic site of the mesenteric vasculatures and decreased the stimulation-evoked norepinephrine release from vascular adrenergic neurons with a concomitant reduction of pressor responses of the preparation. Furthermore, the marked inhibition of pressor responses and norepinephrine release by diltiazem or Ca2(+)-depletion in SHR may suggest the increased Ca2(+)-dependency in vascular neurotransmission in this model of hypertension.\r"

Our baseline diet (I) derived a near equal number of calories from sucrose, proteins and fats, ie, 1/3 of total calories was provided by each macronutrient. Two other diets (II,III) derived the majority of calories from sucrose with less calories from proteins or fats respectively. The last two diets (IV,V) were relatively low in sucrose with a higher percentage of the total calories from proteins or fats respectively. The rats were assigned to the special diets at 3 months of age. They have now been ingesting these diets a total of 12 months. In SHR, the diets highest in sucrose calories (II,III), in contrast to diets I,IV and V, were associated with a markedly increased blood pressure (BP) at 3 months. The difference of approximately 20 to 30 mm Hg has held over 12 months. In contrast, the normotensive Wistar rats consuming diets II and III showed significant differences in BP (approximately 10 mm Hg) only after 12 months. The response of WKY was intermediate. Some clearcut elevation of BP, although not statistically significant, in WKY consuming diets II and III was present by 3 months. This difference became greater with time (20 mm Hg at 12 months). Consistent changes in body weights between the rats on the different diets were lacking. We conclude that excess ingestion of sucrose can cause chronic elevations in BP, the pattern of which varies among rat strains.\r"

Since Na/Li countertransport appears to be a functional mode of Na/H antiport, we measured erythrocyte Na/Li countertransport in nondiabetic normotensive and hypertensive blacks and whites and hypertensive non-insulin-dependent diabetic blacks. Na/Li countertransport was significantly lower in the blacks than in the whites (0.170 +/- 0.017 v 0.230 +/- 0.017 mmol/L/h, P less than .02), but there was no significant difference between the black hypertensives and normotensives. In contrast, black hypertensive diabetics exhibited a significant increase in Na/Li countertransport compared to normotensive and hypertensive nondiabetic blacks (0.252 +/- 0.032 v 0.170 +/- 0.017, P less than .02. Thus, these data indicate that the activity of this antiporter is elevated in black diabetics, possibly further contributing to the development of hypertension in this population.\r"

Before the treatment hyperparathyroidism (HPTH) was estimated on the basis of serum parathormone (PTH), and bone histomorphometry (osteoclastic resorption surfaces (ORS), and number of osteoclasts (NO]. NIC induced a significant decrease in systolic (SAP) and diastolic (DAP) arterial blood pressure, but did not significantly change the heart rate (HR) or the SAP X HR (myocardial oxygen consumption estimate). Changes in SAP and DAP were correlated to baseline serum PTH (P less than .001), to ORS (P less than .01) and to NO (P less than .01). Furthermore, a significant decrease in blood pressure was observed only in patients with histological signs of hyperparathyroidism (ORS greater than 1%). In this subset of patients NIC induced a significant decrease in SAP X HR (P less than .02) which was correlated to PTH and histomorphometric indexes of HPTH (P less than .01). The results of the present study show that blood pressure response to dihydropyridines in ESRF is associated with parathyroid activity as judged from serum PTH and bone histomorphometry.\r"

The present study compares the Ca binding capacity of RBC membrane preparations with normal (+CS) and reduced (-CS) cytoskeleton content in SHR and normotensive WKY control rats. In addition to Ca binding capacity and protein content, the cholesterol content and the acetylcholinesterase (ACE) activity were measured as having a quantitative measure of integral membrane components in the different membrane preparations. In both strains the cholesterol/protein ratio, the ACE activity per mg of membrane protein, and the Ca binding capacity were all significantly higher in -CS compared to +CS membrane preparations (P less than .001). A statistically significant difference in Ca binding capacity between SHR and WKY was observed only using -CS membranes preparation. The results support the concept of a reduced membrane Ca binding capacity in rat genetic hypertension: this abnormality is detectable only in membrane preparations with reduced cytoskeletal content.\r"

The presence of mild diabetic peripheral neuropathy was determined by utilizing conventional nerve conduction studies, the neuropathy symptoms score and a neurologic examination. Ulnar and tibial nerve F response latency, amplitude, duration, chronodispersion and persistence were then compared between populations. The relationship between tibial F response persistence and minimal F response latency was assessed in both populations. In addition, the relationship between tibial F response persistence and tibial nerve conduction velocity and tibial nerve compound action potential characteristics (e.g., latency, amplitude and duration) was assessed in the diabetic population. The results indicate that ulnar F response latency and chronodispersion failed to differentiate the subject and control populations; however, significantly decreased ulnar F response amplitude and duration were noted in the diabetic population. In the tibial nerve, the F response persistence was significantly decreased in the diabetic population but persistence did not correlate with compound muscle action potential latency, amplitude, duration or nerve conduction velocity. Finally, the tibial F response latency, amplitude, duration and chronodispersion failed to differentiate the control and diabetic populations.\r"

High cost stroke patients during inpatient medical rehabilitation are examined to determine how they differ from low cost patients and to identify a subset who did not appear to benefit from rehabilitation. This paper is based on longitudinal charge data involving 73 former stroke rehabilitation patients discharged from three Boston area rehabilitation facilities in 1984. Medical charges are presented on initial acute and rehabilitation inpatient stays and on care received in the 12 months after discharge. Among these 73 stroke patients, charges for inpatient medical rehabilitation amounted to nearly 1.8 million dollars, excluding physician fees and out-of-pocket expenses. Of this total, 57.6% was accured by only 33% of the patients. Fourteen patients, who were both rehabilitation cost outliers and apparent rehabilitation \"failures,\" were identified. Rehabilitation charges for these 14 amounted to $673,232 or 37.5% of the total rehabilitation charges for all 73 patients.\r"

It may be under utilized, however, because it is generally considered to be inaccessible to needle examination. The purpose of this study was to compare the widely recommended posterior approach to this muscle to an anterior approach that we define. In six cadaver legs, the safe access to this muscle via the anterior approach was 16.8 +/- 5 mm by contrast to 9.5 +/- 2 mm by the posterior approach. We conclude that the anterior approach to needle electromyography of the tibialis posterior muscle is easier, safer and deserves more widespread practice.\r"

  ".W": "Screening tests for urinary tract infections (UTI) are used in the clinical laboratory setting. This study evaluated the efficacy of screening by nursing staff on the inpatient unit, instead of the clinical laboratory, in the spinal cord-injured population. Fifty-three consecutive traumatically spinal cord-injured patients had weekly urine collection, except when infected or on antibiotics. Each urine sample was tested by a nitrite and leukocyte esterase (LE) dipstick (Chemstrip LN by Bio-Dynamics) and by routine clinical laboratory culture. A total of 169 tests were completed. The correlation coefficients of the LE and the nitrite tests with the culture were 0.604 (P less than 0.001) and 0.663 (P less than 0.001), respectively. The correlation of the combined tests was 0.837 (P less than 0.001). The sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values of nitrite-LE testing by nursing staff were calculated and compared favorably with published performances of clinical laboratory staff. When measured against the culture, the combined nitrite and LE test had a sensitivity of 79%, specificity of 99% and positive and negative predictive values of 96% and 95%, respectively. The use of a protocol where laboratory culture is performed only when the dipstick test is positive, would reduce the number of cultures by 83%. After extra costs of the additional screen are added, the use of dipstick screening methods by nursing staff can reduce the cost of weekly urine screening by 73%, with a false negative rate of only 4.4%. The expense and complexity of screening for UTI is reduced, response time is minimized and laboratory cultures will have a higher probability of useful clinical information.\r"

The incidence and nature of complications after limb loss was also reviewed. The 12 patients sustained 15 extremity amputations. Lower extremity amputations were the most common disability. Fifty percent of the patients had at least one postoperative complication after amputation. All patients (100%) had at least one complication documented on rehabilitation admission. No patient was using a prosthesis at the time of rehabilitation admission. At discharge six patients were able to use a prosthesis. Only one patient was considered independent. Patient follow-up averaged 28.6 months. At long-term follow-up six patients were using a prosthesis. Four were considered independent. One-third of the total group was considered able to use the prosthesis independently in the community. Of the lower extremity amputated population, only 40% became ambulatory. This is considerably less than can be expected to become ambulatory if there was no amputation. All three upper extremity amputees did not use a prosthesis. All efforts should be directed at salvaging a limb threatened by amputation after survival of traumatic brain injury. Early transfer to a facility specializing in traumatic brain injury rehabilitation may decrease complications, reduce total hospitalization and improve overall functional ability.\r"

The coach frequently relates to skills or technical movements in terms of their aesthetic appearance rather than their mechanical effectiveness. The force output of the elbow flexors appears to be a function of the forearm position. The literature referring to the mechanical efficiency of the elbow flexors seems to favor both semiprone and supine positions, whereas the prone position appears to be discredited. It is the latter grip position that is actually employed and traditionally accepted in the sport of rowing. In fact, this technique was never challenged or scientifically researched to see whether a modified one might lead to better efficiency. Consequently, the purpose of this investigation was to analyze whether athletes' force output differed if the gripping technique was changed from pronation to a semiprone grip (one arm prone, the other semiprone). Under the specific conditions of this investigation, it was demonstrated that the semiprone position was generating greater force output and higher electrical activity, thus being superior to the classical prone grip.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of simulated unilateral and bilateral knee-flexion contractures on standing balance were studied by testing 15 normal subjects on a Kistler force platform. Postural sway (mediolateral and anteroposterior travel) and the mean position of the center of pressure (as a percentage of the distance between the midlines of the feet and from heels to toes) were determined from 20 s of data. Unilateral and bilateral knee-flexion contractures of 15 degrees and 30 degrees were simulated for each subject by means of an adjustable line from the subject's waist to the sole of each foot. Paired t tests were used to compare balance parameters while standing with the simulated contractures with those during relaxed standing. Mediolateral travel increased by a mean difference of 3.6 cm with a 30 degree unilateral contracture (P less than 0.01) and by 5.0 cm with 30 degrees bilateral contractures (P less than 0.01). Anteroposterior travel increased by 4.7 cm (P less than 0.05) and 8.8 cm (P = 0.08) with 15 degrees and 30 degrees bilateral contractures, respectively. With a unilateral contracture of 30 degrees, the center of pressure shifted 15.6% (P less than 0.0005) toward the unflexed side, changes that were not eliminated by correction of the induced leg-length discrepancy. The center of pressure moved anteriorly by 8.3% with 30 degrees bilateral contractures (P less than 0.001). The results provide insight into how knee-flexion contractures alter standing balance, and underline the importance of preventing and treating this common disorder.\r"

  ".W": "Injuries to the upper extremities sometimes result in a loss of work capacity. One of the methods for measuring this loss of work capacity is the grip test. Such measurements may be compromised by an insincere effort (faking) by the subject. Smith et al. (Am J Phys Med Rehabil 1989;68:73-80) developed a protocol to identify sincere and faking efforts with the use of a modified dynamometer. The present investigation was designed to evaluate the applicability of the previously developed protocol to subjects with hand injuries. The investigators also compared the force-time characteristics for contractions at different percentages of maximum (100, 75, 50, and 25%). Sixty subjects (30 male and 30 female) were tested during two sessions while performing both faking and sincere efforts. The five discriminators previously developed were found to be good detectors for both noninjured and injured hands and provided the basis for cutoff values for the five discriminators. Single discriminator prediction gave at best an 85% faking detection rate (by using D3) for men and a 79.2% detection rate (by using D5) for women. Better results were obtained, when a multiple variable prediction was used. It can be concluded that the protocol developed by Smith et al. for detection of an insincere effort can be used successfully with persons who have sustained upper extremity injuries. Furthermore, sincere and faking grip strength \"maxima\" can be correctly identified across a wide range of applied force levels.\r"

Results were compared with control group animals in which polyvinyl alcohol alone was placed around the graft or systemic heparin was given. Vessel patency rates were significantly higher for animals receiving either systemic or transmural heparin than for animals in the control group. Controlled local delivery of heparin did not cause measurable systemic anticoagulation. However, the complication of local hematoma formation occurred as frequently as in the systemic heparin group. Controlled transmural release of heparin has an effective local antithrombotic effect and may hold promise for use in clinical practice.\r"

Several procedures have been developed to restore closure of the paralyzed upper eyelid (implantation of gold weights or open wire springs) or to correct lower lid lagophthalmos and ectropion (lower lid tightening with a Bick procedure or insertion of a closed eyelid spring). In some cases, even a combination of the Bick procedure and insertion of a spring may be insufficient to correct lower lid droop; therefore, we developed a technique to place cartilage into the lower eyelid to correct lid droop. The procedure, suggested by one of us (D.B.S.), has been performed on 51 patients to date. This article reviews our experience with these 51 consecutive patients.\r"

How simultaneous chemical peel affects a local skin flap and why minimal differences in chemical peels can result in significant differences in outcome is not fully understood. In this study guinea pig skin was exposed to skin flap elevation, chemical peel, or a combination of the two. Biopsy specimens were taken at 3 to 35 days after injury and the histologic sections were studied. Results demonstrate that (1) lifting a flap causes changes in the subcutaneous tissue and reticular dermis that makes it more vulnerable to secondary injury and (2) the reticular dermis responds to injury as two physiologically distinct layers, although it appears histologically homogeneous. The upper reticular dermis heals by reorganization, while the deeper reticular dermis heals by scar formation. The differing response to injury of these cell layers may in part explain the low safety margin in aggressive chemical peels.\r"

The effect of prolonged local hypothermia on an important clinical correlate, wound healing, is examined in this study. Skin incisions were made on each flank of nine female pigs, and these incisions were closed primarily. A cooling pad was applied over the incisions on the right side of each animal, achieving an average dermal temperature of 35 degrees C vs 39 degrees C for the control side. Four animals were treated for 72 hours postoperatively; five pigs were treated for 7 days. Wound repair was evaluated by standard histologic techniques at 24 hours, 72 hours, 7 days, and 14 days. Control wounds in all animals demonstrated the normal progression of primary wound repair. We demonstrate that local hypothermia: (1) inhibits wound repair for the duration of its application; (2) is not detrimental to the early 2-week phase of wound healing if applied for 72 hours postoperatively; and (3) may have a beneficial effect by inhibiting inflammation through delay of the late inflammatory phase of wound healing.\r"

The exact similarities and differences of the ear structure between humans and Japanese monkeys were studied by the use of computer-aided three-dimensional reconstruction, in addition to light and electron microscopy. Otitis media with effusion was repeatedly induced by direct intratympanic inoculation of one of the following: keyhole limpet hemocyanin; following systemic immunization with keyhole limpet hemocyanin, Streptococcus pneumoniae; or endotoxin. The temporal bones were serially sliced with a diamond band saw, after which the histologic findings were examined by light and electron microscopy on the basis of macroscopic observations. Each substance induced OME equally, 2 to 3 days after inoculation. Inflammatory reaction of the middle ear mucosa extended to all of the air cells; subsequently, the inflamed mucosa returned to normal in each case along with normalization of both the tympanometric and otoscopic findings. No remarkable architectural change remained, even after OME was induced repeatedly. These findings are applicable to acute otitis media and acute mastoiditis. The development of chronic middle ear effusion was not observed in this study. The usefulness of the diamond band saw and computer-aided analysis for temporal bone histologic evaluations is emphasized.\r"

In the control group, the routine hearing tests demonstrated normal hearing. The differences between the two groups were statistically significant in pure-tone threshold level and in speech discrimination score, when the test was performed at a -5dB signal-to-noise ratio. The results of the vestibular tests were normal in both groups.

  ".W": "The records of all patients with T2, NO squamous cell carcinoma of the true vocal cords treated with definitive radiotherapy at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1970 and 1985 were analyzed to investigate treatment outcome, prognostic factors associated with tumor recurrence, and the potential impact of improved initial treatment on patient survival. There were 114 patients (male to female ratio, 13:1) with a median age of 62 years at presentation. All were treated with external beam irradiation to a modal dose of 70 Gy in 35 fractions over 7 weeks. The median field size was 25 cm2 and no elective treatment to the neck was routinely given. The crude recurrence rate after definitive radiotherapy was 32%. Of the 37 local regional failures, 32 were in the larynx only, 3 in the neck, and 2 in both the larynx and the neck. All patients who had recurrence after radiotherapy underwent salvage procedures, which increased the ultimate control rate above the clavicles to 94%. Overall and disease-specific survival rates at 5 years were 69% and 92%, respectively. Fifty patients died: 7 of laryngeal cancer, 2 of complications of salvage surgery, 13 of unrelated second cancers, and 28 of other intercurrent disease. The prospects for improved survival through more effective initial treatment of this stage of glottic cancer are therefore very limited. Significant complications of radiotherapy occurred in only 4 patients (3.5%), and overall, 74% of patients retained a functional larynx. Analysis of a wide variety of patient-, tumor-, and treatment-related variables failed to identify any statistically significant prognostic factors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, no scientific evidence has yet been presented to support this hypothesis. To answer this question, seven cats had a mucocele created in one frontal sinus, with the other sinus left as a control. A manometer was inserted into each frontal sinus. Pressure readings were taken over a 7-month period. Pressures on the mucocele side were higher than on the control side and were sufficient to erode bone. Bone was thicker on the mucocele side than on the control side. This study established that mucoceles exert sufficient pressure to erode bone, and that such erosion may be part of a two-stage process.\r"

In this study, endoscopic surgery was performed in 22 cases of antrochoanal polyps where the antral part was removed through the middle meatus. Two new instruments were designed to help complete removal of the antral part of the polyp through the maxillary ostium. Some points of controversy concerning the antrochoanal polyp are discussed according to the diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopic findings. Endoscopic follow-up of these cases for periods ranging between 6 and 30 months, with an average of 20 months, showed no recurrence. It was concluded that endoscopic surgery of the antrochoanal polyp through the middle meatus could be performed as an outpatient procedure, and is safe and reliable.\r"

In one method, involving polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, HPV DNA sequences were replicated in vitro from tissue DNA extracted from paraffin sections prior to hybridization. Polymerase chain reaction amplification was compared with the standard method of Southern blot hybridization. Results of the two techniques for all nine laryngeal papillomas agreed completely: five patients harbored HPV type 6 and four HPV type 11. Both PCR amplification and Southern blot hybridization found two of the three polyps to be free of HPV infection, while PCR detected HPV type 18 in one polyp specimen that was reported negative by Southern blot hybridization, suggesting a greater sensitivity of PCR. Our results demonstrate that PCR amplification is as reliable and at least as sensitive as Southern blot hybridization. Moreover the PCR technique opens the way to the undertaking of a whole variety of retrospective studies using formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues.\r"

The blood supply to the tumor was from a persistent stapedial artery. A preoperative angiogram supported this finding by demonstrating a small vessel originating from the anterior branch of the middle meningeal artery as the major vascular supply to the tumor. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of a glomus tympanicum tumor vascularized by a persistent stapedial artery that was suggested by angiography and confirmed intraoperatively. To better understand this anomaly, we review the embryological development of the stapedial artery and discuss its clinical significance.\r"

  ".U": "90303963\r", 
  ".W": "A recent isolate of human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) designated HIV-2ST is deficient in its ability to cause the typical cytopathic effects of HIV infection. The pathogenic potential of HIV-2 in inducing human disease may be less than that of HIV-1, and it is of particular interest to establish the basis for the reduced cytopathogenicity of this isolate in vitro. Utilizing recombinant vaccinia viruses (rVV) carrying the envelope genes (env) of HIV-2ST or those of fully cytopathic HIV-1 or HIV-2 isolates, we have investigated envelope glycoprotein expression, processing, transport, and biological function. Radioimmunoprecipitation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (RIP-PAGE) of rVV-infected cell lysates indicated that the proteins expressed by each recombinant were synthesized, processed, and recognized by specific antisera. Immunofluorescence studies showed that the recombinant env gene products of HIV-2ST and HIV-2ROD reach the cell surface and are retained there in similar amounts. Whereas cells expressing the HIV-1 or HIV-2ROD env gene products were found to undergo fusion with uninfected CD4+ cells, no syncytium formation was observed with three CD4+ cell lines exposed to the cells expressing the envelope glycoproteins of HIV-2ST on their surfaces; one CD4+ lymphoid cell line (SupT1) exhibited few very small syncytia in the presence of recombinant HIV-2ST envelope glycoproteins. The failure of the HIV-2ST envelope glycoprotein to induce cell fusion was not the result of an inhibition by cell-associated CD4, since fusion was also not observed when rVVST-infected CD4- cells were cocultured with CD4+ cells. Thus, the HIV-2ST envelope protein itself is defective in its ability to induce cell fusion. Furthermore, the expression, processing, transport, and surface stability of env products of HIV-2ST are unlikely to be responsible for its attenuation, suggesting that the molecular interactions between its env products and target cell membranes are significantly altered.\r"

A phase of exponential virus production followed until 62 h postinfection. Cell death occurred in the final phase of infection during which infectious virus production remained constant even though viral RNA and protein production increased at an exponential rate. Accumulations of HIV particles were observed within cytoplasmic vacuoles of infected MT-2 cells. Although cell lysates contained high titers of infectious virus, our data show that an increasing proportion of particles produced late in infection were not infectious.\r"

N-butyl deoxynojirimycin (N-buDNJ) was found to be the most potent agent studied. Treatment of acutely infected lymphoid cells with 2.0 mM N-buDNJ reduced virus yield more than 90%, without affecting cell growth. Though lower concentrations of N-buDNJ (0.002-0.2 mM) did not affect HIV-1 production, there was complete inhibition of syncytia formation. Treatment of chronically infected lymphoid cells with 0.1-1.0 mM N-buDNJ resulted in no significant change in virus production, but 80% reduction of infectivity. The attenuation in HIV-1 infectivity was due at least partially to diminished binding to CD4+ lymphoid cells. Chronically infected lymphoid cells treated with 0.02-1.0 mM N-buDNJ for at least 3 days were markedly impaired in their ability to form syncytia with uninfected lymphoid cells. N-buDNJ treatment of HIV-1 infected cells resulted in both a reduction in the cell surface envelope proteins, and an increase in their apparent molecular weight. These results show that N-buDNJ can be used to impair the infectivity of HIV-1 without significant toxicity.\r"

Furthermore, a full-length molecular clone was derived from this isolate which was infectious in human T-cell lines. Therefore this new isolate will be particularly useful for studies on the genetic evolution and biology of HIV-1 as well as for testing antiviral substances and for developing vaccines.\r"

Lipids were extracted from concentrated sweat samples into chloroform:methanol and estimated by thin-layer chromatography in conjunction with photodensitometry. Scraped sweat contained 4 to 10 times more lipid than clean sweat and included cholesterol sulphate and ceramides resembling those found in the stratum corneum. In contrast, clean sweat contained only small amounts of free fatty acids and sterol. A marked individual and daily variation in sweat lipid content was also noted. The study indicates the importance of avoiding epidermal contamination when collecting sweat and the usefulness of our sweat collection method.\r"

Hand eczema was more common in males in both groups, and there was a significantly larger proportion of males in the occupational group (65%) than the non-occupational group (51%) (P less than 0.001). The prevalence of a personal or family history of atopy was significantly lower in the occupational group (7%) than the non-occupational group (15%) (P less than 0.005). Irritant contact dermatitis occurred in a larger proportion of patients in the occupational group (76%) than the non-occupational group (39%) (P less than 0.0001).

Values obtained were compared with results for non-lesional epidermis and from epidermis from normal individuals. Patients on four different treatment regimens were investigated by repeated sampling over 3-4 months starting before therapy commenced. The levels of four keratins changed significantly: keratins I (70 kd) and 2 (66 kd) tended to rise to normal levels, while keratins 16 (50 kd) and 18 (44 kd) fell to normal levels. There were differential effects as well as differences in the rates of normalization depending upon the treatment regimen. The most rapid normalization of the levels of all four keratins was observed with topical dithranol (anthralin) treatment (five patients) with plaque resolution and keratin level normalization after 7-9 weeks. Oral hydroxyurea (three patients) had similar effects, but over a longer time scale (20 weeks). In contrast, oral etretinate (four patients) caused a normalization of all except keratin 2 (66 kd) over a period of 20-28 weeks, and keratin I (70 kd) levels tended to 'overshoot' the normal level. PUVA (five patients) caused rapid normalization (in 9-12 weeks) of keratins 2 (66 kd) and 18 (44 kd), but had much weaker effects on keratins I (70 kd) and 10 (57 kd). These results suggest that resolution of lesions as judged by clinical criteria can occur without normalization of the keratin electrophoretic profile. Possibly the most reliable marker of clinical resolution was the reduction in keratin 16 (50 kd), since treatment effects on the differentiation of keratins I (70 kd) and 2 (66 kd) were different.\r"

We demonstrated that soluble CD9 antigen was shed into CSF obtained from children with ALL, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which used the activity of CD9 antigen to bind the Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA1) and a monoclonal antibody, SJ-9A4, simultaneously. Using RCA1/SJ-9A4 ELISA, CD9 antigen was detectable in CSF but not in plasma from 12 cases of CD9+ ALL in central nervous system (CNS) relapse. However, CD9 antigen was not released into CSF from 11 cases of CD9- ALL with CNS involvement, 136 cases of CD9+ ALL in complete remission (CR), 29 cases of CD9- ALL in CR, or 21 cases of aseptic meningitis. Interestingly, the levels of CD9 antigen were elevated in CSF from 7 of 10 CD9+ ALL patients without cytologically proven CNS involvement at diagnosis, with subsequent return to undetectable levels after initial induction chemotherapy was begun. In addition, sequential analysis of CSF from a 5-year-old boy with CD9+ ALL in CNS relapse showed that levels of CD9 antigen correlated well with the number of leukemic cells in CSF. Serial quantitative analysis of CD9 antigen in CSF could be useful to detect the proliferation of residual leukemic cells before the clinical manifestation.\r"

  ".W": "The prognostic significance of chromosomal translocations, particularly t(1;19) (q23;p13), was evaluated in children with pre-B and early pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Patients were treated on a risk-based protocol of the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) between February 1986 and May 1989. An abnormal clone was detected in 46% (130 of 285) of pre-B cases and 56% (380 of 679) of early pre-B cases. Translocation of any type was associated with a worse treatment outcome than other karyotypic abnormalities: 15 of 66 versus 3 of 64 failed therapy in the pre-B group (P = .001), and 37 of 141 versus 23 of 239 failed in the early pre-B group (P less than .001). The t(1;19) (q23;p13) occurred significantly more often in cases of pre-B ALL with a clonal abnormality than in early pre-B ALL cases (29 of 130 v 5 of 380, P less than .001). Among the 285 pre-B cases in which bone marrow was studied cytogenetically, those with t(1;19) had a significantly worse treatment outcome than all others (11 of 29 v 27 of 256 have failed therapy, P less than .001). This difference is significant (P less than .001) after adjustment for leukocyte count, age, and other relevant features. Cases with the t(1;19) also had a worse prognosis than pre-B patients with other translocations (4 of 37 have failed, P less than .01) or with any other karyotypic abnormality (7 of 101 have failed, P less than .001). We conclude that chromosomal translocations confer a worse prognosis for non-T, non-B-cell childhood ALL, and that the t(1;19) is largely responsible for the poor prognosis of the pre-B subgroup.\r"

  ".W": "The frequency and characteristics of childhood acute leukemia with a 14q32 translocation [other than the t(8;14)(q24;q32)] were determined in 335 cases of newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 105 cases of acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL). Ten children, representing 2.3% of the entire cohort, had this abnormality (1.5% of ALL patients and 4.8% of ANLL patients). By French-American-British (FAB) criteria, 4 cases were classified as L1, 1 as L2, 2 as M1, 1 as M2, and 2 as M5. Remarkably, mixed-lineage expression was found in 6 of these 10 cases, but in only 21 of the other 430 cases without a 14q32 translocation (P less than .001). Leukemic cells from 5 of these 6 cases (4 ANLL, and 1 ALL) coexpressed CD13, a myeloid-associated antigen, and CD2, a T-cell-associated antigen; blasts from the sixth case (ALL) coexpressed CD13 and CD19, a B-lineage-associated antigen. Thus, in addition to the well-described 11q23 translocations and t(9;22), 14q32 translocations also appear to be associated with mixed lineage antigen expression. Break-points of the reciprocal chromosomes from chromosome 14 were identified in five of these cases: 1q23, 6q23-q25, 7p15, 8q11, and 12q13. Of the four mixed-lineage cases that were tested, none showed rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene. This suggests that the 14q32 breakpoint does not involve the IgH gene and that an unidentified important gene may reside on 14q32.\r"

The main findings were: splenomegaly, moderate anemia, thrombocytopenia, and a raised white blood cell count (median 116 x 10(9)/L; range 15 to 482). The circulating lymphoid cells had abundant villous cytoplasm and a round, occasionally bilobed nucleus, with a prominent nucleolus. Monocytopenia, a feature of typical HCL, was not seen; neither was tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase demonstrated in eight cases tested. HCL-V cells had a mature B-cell phenotype: CD19+, CD20+, CD22+, FMC7+, CD11c+, CD10-, CD5-, with light chain isotope restriction in 15 cases. In contrast to typical hairy cells, HCL-V cells were negative with the monoclonal antibodies anti-HC2 and anti-TAC (CD25). Immunoglobulin (Ig) was not detected in two cases and IgG was expressed in the cell membrane of 73% of cases. Bone marrow histology was different from HCL, showing interstitial infiltration by cells clumped together and a moderate amount of reticulin, but the spleen showed the typical red pulp expansion of HCL. HCL-V patients did not respond to splenectomy (5 of 7) or alpha-interferon (7 of 7); 2 of 3 patients had a partial response to 2'deoxycoformycin. The clinical course was benign with 15 patients alive with a median survival greater than 4 years. We confirm that HCL-V is a distinct clinico-pathologic entity with intermediate features between HCL and B-prolymphocytic leukemia.\r"

  ".W": "Certain combinations of differentiation antigens are expressed on leukemia blasts and are absent or extremely rare among normal progenitors in the fetal liver and fetal and regenerating bone marrow. These combinations include cCD3/TdT, a thymic feature retained on thymic-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) blasts outside the thymus, and the coexpression of TdT and myeloid markers (CD13, CD33) on a proportion of ALL and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Thus, double marker immunofluorescence assays are operationally leukemia-specific and can be applied in 35% of acute leukemias for detecting minimal disease at a less than 10(-4) level; only rare cases, 2 of 35 in our study, switch these relevant features during relapse. The sensitivity and specificity of these assays was tested as follows. First, bone marrow samples taken from patients who had originally presented with blasts expressing the leukemia-associated combinations but were in full morphologic remission were studied, and varying numbers (less than 0.01% to 10% of the mononuclear fraction) of cells with aberrant features were identified in 11.6% of the cases. Second, the outcome of 19 patients with minimal disease identified immunologically while in complete morphologic remission was investigated: all 19 patients have developed systemic relapse within 4 to 25 (median 14.5) weeks. In contrast, 17 of 25 patients also morphologically in complete remission and without residual disease identifiable immunologically after repeated testing are still in morphologic and immunologic remission (follow-up 17 to 114 weeks, median 28 weeks). Only eight patients in this group have relapsed so far: in two patients the relapse was localized in the cerebrospinal fluid, while in six patients a systemic relapse was observed 6 to 51 (median 21.5) weeks after the last negative immunologic bone marrow examination. In conclusion, no false-positive results were detected with these sensitive assays, and the introduction of appropriately planned prospective studies, including the immunologic detection of residual leukemia, is justified on the basis of these observations.\r"

  ".W": "Childhood is a critical period for the development of the memory B-lymphocyte repertoire necessary in protective humoral immunity. This study addressed the natural history of memory B cells based on the previous identification of germinal center and mantle zone cells as the probable precursor and mature memory cell populations, respectively. Using flow cytometric quantitation of these B-cell subpopulations in human tonsil, we found that germinal center cells were abundant (70% of tonsil B cells) during early childhood (2 to 3 years), but decline by early adolescence (8 to 14 years) to a low level (33%, P = .0003). To study the clonal evolution of these B-cell subpopulations, germinal center and mantle zone B cells were isolated using a preparative magnetic immunobead method, and analyzed using a novel polymerase chain reaction-based quantitative assay to measure the abundance of B-cell clones bearing certain rearranged VH subfamilies. Two VH subfamilies were informative: VH1N clones were uniquely deficient in germinal center B cells at the early age period, but became abundant in later childhood; and VH3L clones were absent among germinal center cells regardless of age. In contrast, B-cell clones bearing each VH subfamily were abundant in the mantle zone subpopulation throughout childhood. These findings suggest that the abundance and clonal pattern of germinal center B cells evolves during childhood, presumably due to changing antigenic or ontogenic processes. Moreover, the distinct clonal pattern of germinal center versus mantle zone B cells suggests that a major phase of clonal selection occurs after germinal center emigration.\r"

Analysis by reversible and covalent binding of PBZDR expression on human neutrophils shows that it is modulated during NADPH-oxidase activation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Based on a series of 17 patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), results show that PBZDR expression is dramatically impaired in X-linked CGD, an inherited disorder due to a mutation on the gene coding for cytochrome b558 NADPH-oxidase component, whereas it is unaffected in autosomal recessive CGD where cytochrome b558 is normally expressed, suggesting a link between PBZDR and cytochrome b558 expressions. PBZDR can be assigned by covalent binding to an 18-Kd membrane protein. These results suggest that the neutrophil PBZDR, which can accommodate the widely prescribed anxiolytic drug Valium (diazepam), is involved in host defense against pathogens, a function that could be affected by neuroimmune interactions.\r"

Therefore, we examined the effects of 1,25(OH)2-D on the monocyte phenotype and function of human peripheral blood monocytes as an index of its biologic role at an inflammatory site. 1,25(OH)2-D treatment consistently and specifically reduced HLA-DR and CD4 expression by monocytes, while CD14 and class I HLA antigen expression were unaffected. Expression of Fc gamma R I-III on monocytes was variably modulated by 1,25(OH)2-D treatment, but no differences in antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) were observed, measured using either ADCC or anti-Fc gamma R-antibody expressing hybridomas. In contrast, the ability of monocytes to induce antigen-dependent T-cell proliferation was markedly reduced by 1,25(OH)2-D pretreatment for as little as 6 hours. Addition of interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, or indomethacin did not restore antigen-dependent T-cell proliferation, suggesting that this observation was not secondary to changes in IL-1, IL-6, or PGE2 production induced by 1,25(OH)2-D. These data suggest that 1,25(OH)2-D treatment specifically modulates human monocyte phenotype and function, altering HLA-DR antigen expression and antigen presentation, while leaving lytic function intact. These findings may be relevant to the immunobiologic role of 1,25(OH)2-D.\r"

  ".W": "The membrane skeleton of normal erythrocytes is largely organized into a hexagonal lattice of junctional complexes (JC) crosslinked by spectrin tetramers, and occasional double tetramers and hexamers. To explore possible skeletal alterations in hereditary spherocytosis (HS), elliptocytosis (HE), and pyropoikilocytosis (HPP), we have studied the ultrastructure of the spread membrane skeletons from a subpopulation of HS patients with a partial spectrin deficiency ranging from 43% to 86% of normal levels, and in patients with HPP who, in addition to a mild spectrin deficiency, also carried a mutant spectrin that was dysfunctional, thus reducing the ability of spectrin dimers to assemble into tetramers. Membrane skeletons derived from Triton-treated erythrocyte ghosts were examined by negative staining electron microscopy. HS membrane skeletons contained structural elements, consisting of JC and spectrin filaments similar to the normal skeleton. However, less spectrin filaments interconnected the JC, and the decrease of spectrin filaments attached to JC appeared to correlate with the severity of spectrin deficiency. Only in severe HS associated with severe spectrin deficiency was the loss of spectrin sufficient enough to disrupt the overall skeletal architecture. In contrast, membrane skeletons prepared from red blood cells (RBCs) of subjects with HPP were strikingly different from HS RBCs with a comparable degree of spectrin deficiency. Although HPP RBCs were only mildly deficient in spectrin, their skeletal lattice was grossly disrupted, in contrast to only mild ultrastructural abnormalities of HS membrane skeletons with a nearly identical degree of spectrin deficiency. Skeletons from patients with common mild HE or asymptomatic carriers, carrying the mutant spectrin but having normal spectrin content, exhibited a moderate disruption of the skeletal lattice. We propose that the above differences in skeletal ultrastructure may underlie differences in the biomechanical properties and morphology of HS, HE, and HPP RBCs.\r"

While 12% of the control cells were removed from circulation in 24 hours, 23% were removed after treatment with 339 mumols/L H2O2, and 36% following exposure to 581 mumols/L H2O2. Pretreatment with carbon monoxide before exposure with H2O2 increased the survival of oxidized RBCs. RBCs not removed from circulation in the first 24 hours had a normal lifespan. Moreover, by selectively isolating biotin-labeled, peroxide-treated cells that survived the first 24-hour posttransfusion period, a significant decrease in Sp-Hb crosslinking was observed in these cells. These results suggest that a subpopulation of cells sensitive to oxidation were removed during the first 24 hours. To identify this population, the survival of density-fractionated RBCs exposed to oxidant stress was quantitated. No differences in either the 24-hour survival or RBC life span were observed between untreated low-density (MCHC less than or equal to 32g/dL) and high-density cells (MCHC greater than or equal to 37g/dL). However, striking differences were noted after treatment with 339 mumols/L H2O2, with the 24-hour survival of high-density cells showing a marked decrease compared with low-density cells. These data support our hypothesis that during peroxidative membrane damage, Hb oxidation initiates a sequence of events resulting in skeletal changes that lead to membrane alterations and, eventually, in vivo destruction, and that the dense, dehydrated cells are more susceptible to oxidant damage.\r"

  ".W": "Deoxygenation-induced cation movements in sickle cells were inhibited 80% to 85% by the anion transport inhibitor, 4,4'-diisothiocyano-2,2'disulfostilbene (DIDS). Morphologic sickling was not altered by DIDS treatment, demonstrating that morphologic sickling was not sufficient to produce cation leaks in sickle cells. DIDS inhibition of deoxygenation-induced cation flux was not affected when l- replaced Cl-, indicating that conductive anion movements did not limit cation flux in deoxygenated cells treated with DIDS. Inhibition was irreversible after preincubation with DIDS at 37 degrees C for 20 minutes, and was not affected by the oxygenation state of cells at the time of drug exposure. Sulfate self-exchange was inhibited at lower DIDS concentrations than was deoxygenation-induced flux. Incubation of cells with DIDS at 4 degrees C produced progressive blockade of sulfate exchange, but did not alter deoxygenation-induced cation fluxes. Other stilbene disulfonates, including compounds incapable of covalent reactions, also inhibited deoxygenation-induced cation movements, although several other inhibitors of anion exchange did not. Dissociation of the inhibition of anion exchange and deoxygenation-induced cation flux indicates that the DIDS effect on deoxygenation-induced cation movements does not involve the well-characterized stilbene binding site of the anion exchanger. These data provide evidence for a membrane constituent on the external surface of oxygenated sickle cells capable of interacting with DIDS to prevent the increase in cation permeability associated with sickling.\r"

Unexpectedly, there are two distinct, short stretches of 3' untranslated sequence homology between human and murine cDNAs. The functional significance of this sequence conservation is unknown.

Cross-linking of radioiodinated EPO to COS cells expressing the human EPO-R gave apparent molecular weights of 66 and 100 Kd for the receptor. The murine interleukin-3-dependent pre-B-lymphocyte cell line, Ba/F3, was made EPO-dependent by transfection of the human cDNA into the cells and selecting for growth in EPO-containing media.\r"

Nonexchangeable methotrexate and methotrexate polyglutamates were separated and quantitated. Event-free survival at 5 years was 38% +/- 9% for all 43 patients (27 failures), and 44% +/- 10% for the 35 with non-T, non-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (20 failures). Of these 35 children, those whose lymphoblasts accumulated more than 100 pmol methotrexate and 500 pmol methotrexate polyglutamates per billion cells experienced better 5-year event-free survival than those whose lymphoblasts did not (65% +/- 12% v 22% +/- 9%, P = .010). This difference characterized \"good-risk\" patients who were female (P = .014), less than age 7 at diagnosis (P = .005), or had low initial white blood cell counts (less than 20 X 10(9)/L, P = .018). Findings were similar for the 43 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and for the \"good-risk\" children in this total group. Thus, the ability of lymphoblasts to accumulate methotrexate and form methotrexate polyglutamates may be important to the curative properties of current therapy of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children, particularly for \"good-risk\" patients. In such patients, inherent rather than acquired drug resistance may be the initial event leading to treatment failure.\r"

  ".U": "90304344\r", 
  ".W": "Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is radioprotective and induces both circulating colony-stimulating factor(s) (CSF) and IL-6 in mice. We evaluated the relationship among these three responses to IL-1 using anti-IL-1 receptor antibody 35F5. This antibody in vitro blocks responses of T cells and fibroblasts, but not of B cells or myeloid cell lines, to IL-1. Administration of 35F5 alone before irradiation reduced the number of surviving mice compared with those not treated with 35F5, demonstrating that endogenous IL-1 participates in the natural resistance to radiation. Thirty micrograms of 35F5 per mouse also reduced by 92% the survival of irradiated mice pretreated with 0.3 micrograms of IL-1. Similarly, 30 micrograms of 35F5 reduced by 96% to 98% the induction of IL-6 by IL-1. In contrast, 30 micrograms of 35F5 resulted in only moderate reduction of circulating CSF. Consequently, the level of circulating CSF after 35F5 treatment was still equivalent to levels of CSF that were induced by doses of IL-1 in the radioprotective range. Because treatment with 35F5 antibody resulted in the blocking of IL-1-reduced radioprotection, the above results suggest that circulating CSF, by itself, may not be sufficient for radioprotection. This conclusion supports our previous results which showed that granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) and G-CSF were radioprotective only when administered with suboptimal doses of IL-1.\r"

We have isolated variant cell lines from FDC-P1 that grow in response to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). These variant cell lines (FD/PMA) have maintained their PMA-dependency for over 1 year. Lymphokine gene expression, which would support growth, was not detected in FD/PMA lines. FD/PMA lines had a different cell surface phenotype than the parental line. Mac-1, Mac-2, and Mac-3 were readily detected on the cell surface of FD/PMA lines; however, these antigens were not detected on FDC-P1. Because protein kinase C (PKC) activation may mediate PMA effects, we examined this kinase. PKC activity quantitated by 32P-incorporation into histone was increased in FDC-P1 as compared with FD/PMA cultured in IL-3. Moreover, PKC activity was undetectable in FD/PMA lines cultured in PMA. Using Western blotting, immunoreactive PKC was readily detected in cytosolic and solubilized particulate fractions of FDC-P1 cells, not but in FD/PMA cell extracts. Comparisons between the parental and FD/PMA lines should provide insight into IL-3- and PMA-mediated signal transduction.\r"

The clearance and catabolism of SK:plasmin (SK:Pm) and PEG-SK:Pm activator complexes were also investigated. Native 125I-SK cleared rapidly (t1/2 = 15 minutes) from the circulation, with the majority of the ligand accumulating in the liver and gastrointestinal (GI) tract and a substantial fraction also localizing in the kidneys. SK, which was removed from the plasma by the liver, was secreted into bile and then the GI tract. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) demonstrated that 125I-SK recovered from liver and bile was homogeneous and of the same molecular weight (mol wt approximately 50,200) as native SK. PEG-125I-SK cleared slowly (t1/2 greater than 200 minutes), with more than 80% of the preparation localizing in liver and GI tract. The PEG-125I-SK secreted into the bile was also intact. The bile containing 125I-SK was incubated with stoichiometric amounts of plasminogen and electrophoresed under nondenaturing conditions. This study demonstrated that the secreted SK was able to form SK:Pg complexes. SDS-PAGE also showed activation of 125I-Pg that was incubated with recovered bile containing the SK. 125I-SK:Pm catabolism was also studied. In these experiments, the mol wt approximately 42,000 fragment obtained when SK is cleaved by plasmin was found in the bile. This fragment of 125I-SK was not recovered as part of a complex with plasmin, consistent with our previous observations that catabolism of SK:Pm involves transfer of the plasmin to plasma proteinase inhibitors while SK is catabolized independently. By contrast, when PEG-125I-SK:Pm was injected into mice, only intact PEG-125I-SK was found in the bile, consistent with our previous observations that the PEG derivatization blocks its degradation by plasmin.\r"

The most consistent and intense reactions were obtained with vimentin-positive fibroblast-like cells in loose connective tissue. TF usually was not identified in fetal stem vessel endothelial cells, but TF reactivity was found in some of these cells in chorionic villi with histologic evidence of chronic inflammation. Such areas are uncommonly found in normal-term placentae. The vast majority of TF-reactive cells did not react with antibody to factor VII and were not in contact with blood.

Streptavidin adsorbed to 18-nm colloidal gold beads (Au18-streptavidin) and streptavidin covalently bound to horseradish peroxidase (HRP-streptavidin) were used to follow the movement of biotinylated rIL-2 within cells over a 4-hour period. Results obtained from either probe were similar. Biotinylated rIL-2 was taken up in coated pits, transferred to a series of small uncoated vesicles and tubules in the peripheral cytoplasm of the cell, then concentrated and sequestered in uncoated vesicles, multivesicular bodies (MVB), and dense bodies (DB) in the peripheral and juxtanuclear cytoplasm of the cell. Occasionally, MVB containing Au18-streptavidin, or HRP-streptavidin, appear to have fused with the plasma membrane of the cell. No labeling of the Golgi cisternae, nuclear envelope, or nucleus was observed. Results from a competitive receptor binding assay and a cell proliferation assay indicate that both the affinity of rIL-2 for high affinity rIL-2 receptors and the proliferative activity of rIL-2 were negligibly affected by the biotinylation procedure. These studies suggest that in activated lymphocytes, IL-2 is bound to receptors on the cell surface, gathered in coated pits, internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis, concentrated in the endosomal compartments, and delivered to lysosomes for degradation.\r"

The tests evaluated event memory under parallel conditions by two-choice content recognition tasks. In both recency and frequency tests, H.M. showed above-chance and often normal temporal contextual memory under conditions of impaired and even chance-level content recognition.

A third task required a manual localization of the site of a brief flash in the hemianopic side. The last test was administered either in a condition of free gaze during pointing or in a condition in which the gaze was kept fixed throughout all phases of the task. The first two tasks differed from the third not only in the type of visual function, that is, detection vs spatial localization, but also in the response criterion. A forced-choice procedure was adopted in the localization task while in the spatial and temporal interfield interaction tasks a reaction time paradigm that did not require guessing was used. One patient showed unequivocal evidence of blindsight on all tasks, thus excluding the possibility that his blindsight depended on the nature of the response. An interesting dissociation was found in the localization task where 1 patient showed evidence of blindsight when tested under conditions of unrestrained gaze during pointing but not when tested under fixed gaze conditions.\r"

Successful performance required the subject to suppress a tendency to reach directly at the reward while (1) orientation of the open side, (2) position on the tray, and (3) position of the banana in the box were manipulated in order to vary the cognitive and motor difficulty of the trial. African green monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops sabaeus) were treated with MPTP (1.5-1.6 mg/kg cumulative dose over 4-5 days). A control group was sham treated (n = 12). MPTP-treated subjects either became severely symptomatic, showing motor impairments that prevented them from performing, or showed no gross motor impairment (n = 6) in spite of major depletions in dopamine concentrations. MPTP-treated subjects showed impaired acquisition of the task when tested 8-12 months later. They made more errors during the sessions, specifically on the trials that were related to cognitive complexity, such as attempting to reach directly towards the reward through the transparent side of the box (a barrier reach), instead of reaching around it (detour) into the open side, as well as other awkward, perseverative or delayed reaches. MPTP appears to cause both cognitive and motor deficits in the acquisition of this task 8-12 months after treatment, even in the group of monkeys which never showed gross motor deficits.\r"

Immunochemical demonstration of HLA-DR antigens was also performed on isolated human Schwann cells at different times in culture, from the same nerves. In normal nerves, HLA-DR positive material is localized only on endothelial and perivascular cells and in rare perineurial and endoneurial cells. In fetal nerves, HLA-DR positive material is already present by the sixteenth week of gestation. Quantitative analysis of HLA-DR molecules density in pathological nerves showed a wide heterogeneity in different neuropathies with no correlation between the type of pathology and the intensity and pattern of staining. Cultured human Schwann cells obtained from fetal, normal adult and pathological (vasculitic neuropathy) nerves were HLA-DR positive and the percentage of positive cells increased with time in culture. DR antigen appearance on human Schwann cells may reflect not only an immunologically-mediated phenomenon but also a dependence on axon-Schwann cell interaction.\r"

The possibility that sensory cells subserving clinically normal regions may be functionally spared by the mutation has been investigated by studying the expression of cell surface oligosaccharides by dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and their central processes in the spinal cord. The study included 3 lactoseries epitopes (TC6, LD2 and LA4) and the globoseries epitope SSEA3. The results show that at cervical and lumbar levels in mf rats there are reduced numbers of DRG cells reacting with the various antibodies and less immunostaining in the dorsal horns. The unexpected finding that thoracic ganglia and cord share similar appearances suggests that, in spite of being normal in number and able to produce normal amounts of substance P, thoracic DRG cells in mf rats take part in the mutation as shown by their inability to produce normal amounts of oligosaccharides and to transport them to the axon terminals.\r"

Stimulation produced a consistently localized and robust peak response in primary sensorimotor cortex contralateral to hand vibration in normal subjects (averaged hemisphere response 10.97 ml/(100 g.min) +/- 2.53). The sensorimotor response in dystonic patients was also consistently localized to the same area, but significantly reduced in magnitude whether vibrating the affected (8.35 ml/(100 g.min) +/- 2.29) or unaffected hand (8.40 ml/(100 g.min) +/- 2.15). Furthermore, vibration induced a dystonic cramp in the stimulated arm/hand in 6 patients, but not in any normal subjects. To determine whether the cocontraction of agonist and antagonist muscles could, in itself, attenuate the regional blood flow response, 10 normal subjects were studied with vibration during voluntary cocontraction of appropriate hand and forearm muscles, as well as with vibration alone. Vibration with voluntary cocontraction (mean = 12.57 ml/(100 g.min) +/- 2.13) produced a significantly greater response than vibration alone (mean = 10.30 ml/(100 g.min) +/- 2.20, P less than 0.00008). This abnormal sensorimotor response may have important implications for understanding the pathophysiology of idiopathic dystonia.\r"

The lesion was located in Brodmann's field 6, above Broca's area, in the region traditionally referred to as Exner's area. The alexia and agraphia occurred in a pure form, that is, in the setting of otherwise normal cognitive and neurological function. She was not aphasic or hemiparetic and her visual perception, intellect, memory, oral spelling and drawing were normal. The patterns of impairment of reading and writing closely paralleled one another. Reading of single words and letters was severely impaired, and she was entirely unable to read sentences. She was virtually unable to write recognizable letters, could write no words, and her writing attempts were severely distorted spatially. By contrast, she could easily read all numbers and nonverbal symbols, and she was equally able to write numbers and perform written calculations without difficulty. These striking dissociations provide further evidence of the domain specificity of cognitive/neural representations. They also point to the possible role of premotor cortices in the coactivation of precise sequences of motor and sensory activity patterns involved in reading and writing.\r"

  ".W": "The role of vision in the control of balance in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and cerebellar disease (CD) was studied by measuring body sway with eyes open, closed, and in response to visual stimuli generated by discrete lateral displacements of a moveable room which enclosed the subjects. In response to room movement, normal subjects swayed by an amount intermediate between sway with eyes open and eyes closed and their response attenuated on repetition of the movement, a process depending on shifting from predominantly visual to proprioceptive control. CD patients swayed more than controls with eyes open or closed and as shown by high 'Romberg quotients' (eyes closed/eyes open sway ratio) were able to use visual information to control much of their unsteadiness. CD patients had a normal attenuation of response to repetition of the room movement. PD patients had normal sway with eyes open or closed but their responses to room movement were abnormal, being proportionately larger and failing to attenuate during successive stimuli. The results indicate that cerebellar lesions seem largely to spare the visuopostural loop and also spare the ability to shift from a visual to a proprioceptive control of postural sway. In contrast, the findings in PD suggest that the visuopostural loop is hyperactive and that its influence cannot easily be de-emphasized when visual information is misleading. The latter finding suggests that basal ganglia participation in posture is concerned with the reweighting of the various sensorimotor loops controlling posture in the process of adapting to novel situations.\r"

  ".W": "The masseter inhibitory reflex (MIR) was investigated in 16 patients with localized brainstem lesions involving the trigeminal system. The MIR consists of two phases of EMG silence (S1 and S2) evoked by stimulation of the mental nerve during maximal clenching of the teeth. The extent of the lesions was assessed by neurological examination, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and recording of trigeminal reflexes with known paths (jaw jerk and blink reflex). The MIR appeared to be abnormal in lesions involving the pontine tegmentum, from the pontomedullary junction to midpons, and some lesions selectively affected one component of the MIR, proving that S1 and S2 are relayed by independent circuits. The results indicate that afferent fibres for S1, which reach the pons via the trigeminal sensory root, enter the ipsilateral trigeminal spinal tract and terminate at the level of the midpons; impulses are then relayed by interneurons to the ipsilateral and contralateral trigeminal motor nuclei. The afferent fibres for S2 follow a similar path, but descend to the pontomedullary junction; at this level impulses are conducted along bilateral interneuronal paths, which probably ascend through the lateral reticular formation, before connecting with the trigeminal motor nucleus on either side. Analysis of MIR recordings can be of particular value because brainstem inhibitory reflexes cannot be tested by clinical examination.\r"

Whereas many reflex responses had a rather large latency variability of above 1000 microseconds (expressed as SD of mean latency) there was a group of motor neurons with a variability of around 500 microseconds. Single motor neuron reflex responses with shorter latencies tended to show less variability. No habituation of single motor neuron reflex discharges was observed on prolonged regular repetitive stimulation. Both absence of habituation and the relatively low latency variability of bulbocavernosus reflex responses for single motor neurons suggest similarities between this reflex and the first component of the blink reflex; we postulate that the shortest bulbocavernosus reflex pathway is oligosynaptic.\r"

In all patients magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a single focal area of pathological signal intensity in the (dorso)-lateral medulla suggesting infarction. In 2 of these 9 patients and in 3 further patients with no medullary signs, the infarction involved the cerebellar territory of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). Acutely, all patients with Wallenberg's syndrome (except 1) had saccadic lateropulsion and spontaneous nystagmus in light with the horizontal fast component beating to the contralateral normal side. The velocity of the slow drift to the side of the lesion was dependent on eye position and induced a characteristic asymmetry of the visually and vestibularly elicited slow eye movements. In most patients smooth pursuit, optokinetic nystagmus and visual suppression of the vestibulo-ocular reflex were still impaired when this spontaneous drift was minimal or absent. The oculomotor disturbances in patients with and without cerebellar infarction are compared. The following conclusions are made. (1) The spontaneous drift that is dependent on eye position is mostly created by 'ocular lateropulsion', that is, a tonic bias within the oculomotor system which may have several sources. (2) The abnormalities and asymmetries of oculomotor responses during visual-vestibular stimulation cannot solely be explained by this spontaneous drift and its interaction with otherwise normal eye movements. Instead, structures and pathways are damaged in Wallenberg's syndrome which mediate visual and/or motor signals important for the cerebellar control of visually-guided slow eye movements. (3) Damage to these pathways occurs in the lateral medulla, as the MRI findings show that in most patients the cerebellum is rarely involved, but no definite conclusion can be made as to which of the fibres travelling in the inferior peduncle to the cerebellum may be interrupted.\r"

To assess the magnitude of the problem and to identify the contributing factors we used a questionnaire, injury reports and patient charts to survey bicycle-related injuries among children brought to the emergency department of the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, between May 1 and Sept. 30, 1988. The questionnaire was completed for 517 (91%) of the 568 children; 70% were boys, and the mean age was 9.4 years. Only 2% of the patients had been wearing a helmet at the time of injury, although 13% claimed to own one for cycling. Over 60% of the accidents were attributable to carelessness or poor bicycle control; mechanical failure and environmental hazards were minor factors. Over 80% of the injuries occurred within a kilometre of the child's home. Of the 97 children admitted to hospital 49% had head and skull injuries and 40% had limb fractures. Bicycle-related injuries represented 14.8% of all nonwinter (Apr. 1 to Oct. 31) trauma admissions among children 5 years or older. Our results further document bicycle-related injuries as an important childhood problem and underscore the need for improved safety measures.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-three patients with regionally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Stage III) were treated with continuous infusion 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) augmented by high-dose oral leucovorin and hydroxyurea and concomitant radiotherapy. This chemoradiotherapy regimen was administered during 5 days of every other week for six cycles (total radiation dose, 6000 cGy). Three patients (13%) had stable disease, 13 patients (57%) had a partial response (PR), and 1 patient (4%) had a complete response (CR). The overall response rate was 61% (95% confidence interval, 41% to 81%). At a median follow-up time of 19 months, the median survival time for all 23 patients was 12 months. The median time to disease progression was 6 months. Twelve patients have had disease progression outside of the chest, and only 3 patients have had intrathoracic disease progression as the site of first failure. The toxicities of this regimen consisted of mild to moderate myelosuppression and moderate degree dermatitis and mucositis. It was concluded that concomitant chemoradiotherapy with this regimen results in high local activity at acceptable toxicity. However, the systemic activity of this regimen was low, resulting in a high distant recurrence rate and a median survival time that was not different from that achieved with standard therapy. Therefore, its use, as defined in this study, cannot be recommended.\r"

  ".U": "90304734\r", 
  ".W": "With the introduction of effective prophylactic central nervous system (CNS) therapy in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the incidence of CNS relapse has been significantly reduced. Nonetheless, there is a continuing need for effective CNS therapy for the 5% to 10% of children who escape prophylaxis and in whom active CNS disease develops. In July 1985, a pilot study was initiated whereby the consolidative CNS treatment, given in the form of craniospinal axis radiation, was delayed and administered after delivery of a prolonged course of intensive systemic and CNS chemotherapy. Ten leukemic patients with CNS relapse were treated according to this pilot study. One patient did not respond to pre-CNS consolidative therapy and died at 2 months with progressive disease. The remaining nine patients have completed the craniospinal axis radiation. Five patients are off all therapy and remain in remission at a median time of 38 months (range, 31 to 46 months). Two patients are near completion of therapy and are disease-free at 22 and 24 months. Testicular relapse occurred in two patients at 14 and 29 months. CNS chemotherapy, as used in this trial, appears to have allowed for a delay in the administration of the consolidative craniospinal radiation without negatively affecting the CNS remission rate or duration. In turn, this delay has allowed for the uncompromised delivery of intensive multiagent systemic chemotherapy, as well as the separation of those patients destined to early systemic relapse from those who will achieve a sustained complete remission. In both cases, a reduction in the need for multiple courses of potentially toxic CNS therapy as a result of CNS reseeding after radiation is anticipated.\r"

  ".W": "Several investigators have reported decreased natural killer cell activity of the peripheral blood from children with acute leukemia both at diagnosis and in relapse. This study was to determine whether this decreased natural killer activity is the result of a diminished number or defective function of natural killer cells or both. The percentage of Leu 19+ (NKH-1, CD56) and the lytic activity of a purified Leu 19+ population from the peripheral blood of children with acute lymphocytic leukemia as well as from healthy children were determined. This cell population mediates most natural killer and natural killer-like activity in the peripheral blood. Twenty-three children with acute lymphocytic leukemia (16 at diagnosis, seven in relapse) as well as six control children were studied. The percentage of Leu 19+ cells was significantly lower in the blood of children either at initial diagnosis (median, 3%; P less than 0.005) or in relapse (median, 1%; P less than 0.01) than that for the control children (median, 12.5%). The cytotoxicity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) against K562 in 3-hour 51Cr release assay was significantly lower for patients either at diagnosis (median, 8.5 lytic units[LU]/10(7) cells; P less than 0.005) or in relapse (median, 3 LU/10(7) cells; P less than 0.005) than that for normal controls (median, 97 LU/10(7) cells). The lytic activity of a fluorescent activated cell sorter (FACS) purified Leu 19+ population was evaluated. The Leu 19+ cells were sorted from PBMC of 11 children with acute lymphocytic leukemia who had more than 2% Leu 19+ cells in their PBMC (nine at diagnosis and two in relapse). The lytic activity of sorted Leu 19+ cells was significantly (P less than 0.04) lower for patients at initial diagnosis (median, 45 LU/10(7) cells) than that for normal control children (median, 317 LU/10(7) cells). One of the two children studied at relapse had low Leu 19+ lytic activity. The authors concluded that (1) The percentage of Leu 19+ cells in the peripheral blood of the majority of children with acute lymphocytic leukemia either at diagnosis or in relapse is below normal; (2) The lytic activity of PBMC from the majority of children with acute lymphocytic leukemia is reduced both at diagnosis and in relapse; and (3) The lytic activity of Leu 19+ purified PBMC is reduced in the majority of children with acute lymphocytic leukemia. These findings confirm the defective natural killer cell profile in children with acute lymphocytic leukemia both at the time of diagnosis and in relapse.\r"

  ".W": "The authors performed immunohistochemical and cytogenetic studies in a 73-year old man with malignant angioendotheliomatosis. The patient was referred for evaluation of fever of unknown origin, hepatic failure, and neurologic deterioration. Examination of a muscle biopsy revealed numerous, noncohesive atypical mononuclear cells within small vessels. These cells stained positively with a pan-leukocyte marker CD45(PD7/26/16) and with a B-cell marker L26 but negatively with Factor VIII-related antigen, an endothelial cell marker. Peripheral blood obtained before chemotherapy was cultured and analyzed by the G-band method. A new translocation and numerous chromosomal aberrations were identified. The major cell line karyotype was 53,XY, +X, +5q?,-6, +i(6p), +7, -10, +11, -12, +12p-, +12p-, +18, +mar1, +mar2, t(1;3)(p22;p21),3q+,8p+. This is the first cytogenetic study performed in a case of malignant angioendotheliomatosis. Our findings demonstrate that the neoplastic cells in this disorder circulate in the peripheral blood and provide further evidence that malignant angioendotheliomatosis is a diffuse intravascular neoplasm of lymphoid origin. Furthermore, the authors conclude that this malignant lymphoproliferative disorder should be reclassified as a primary intravascular (angiotropic) lymphoma.\r"

  ".U": "90304740\r", 
  ".W": "One hundred seventy-six canine lymphomas were classified morphologically using four of the major human lymphoma classification schemes (Rappaport, Lukes-Collins, Kiel, and the Working Formulation). All 176 dogs received the same chemotherapeutic protocol. Sixty-two of these lymphomas had their immunophenotypes established by examination of cell surface markers by automated cytofluorography. Several different morphologic types of canine lymphoma were identified and these were comparable to morphologic categories in human classification schemes. Follicular and low grade lymphomas were rare. The two most common morphologic types were diffuse large cell (centroblastic) and immunoblastic. The Kiel classification appeared to be the most useful human scheme for classifying the canine lymphomas. Cytofluorographic analysis was generally straightforward, and 60 of the 62 lymphomas were placed into one of three immunophenotypic categories: 27 pan-T(LQ1)+SIg+, 21 pan-T(LQ1)-SIg+, and 12 pan-T(LQ1)+SIg-. Two of the lymphomas could not be characterized immunologically because a pre-existing or reactive non-neoplastic population of lymphocytes made interpretation of single cell suspension analysis difficult. The authors identified correlations between morphology and survival and disease-free remission; dogs with high-grade tumors generally survived the longest and had the longest remissions. No correlations were identified between high concentrations of serum lactate dehydrogenase, age, sex, or stage of disease, and morphology, immunophenotype, remission, or survival times. A significant correlation between clinical illness and survival time was documented. The median age of the dogs was nine years, no significant effect of sex on prevalence was observed, and some breeds were significantly overrepresented. Significant morphologic-immunophenotypic correlations included shorter remission and survival times for T-cell tumors than B-cell tumors, and a highly significant correlation between the pan-T(LQ1)+SIg-\"T cell\" phenotype and hypercalcemia.\r"

All tumors (eight male, two female patients) were histologically moderately or poorly differentiated and nine of ten had metastasized to regional lymph nodes. The authors applied a set of satellite DNA probes, specific for chromosomes 1, 7, 17, X, and Y in order to detect numerical chromosome aberrations in freshly isolated tumor cell nuclei. Normal diploid human lymphocyte nuclei and, in a number of cases, normal gastric mucosa served as controls. Parallel with the hybridization experiments DNA flow cytometric study of acridine orange (AO)-stained tumor cells was carried out. By means of FISH the authors found seven cases to be aneuploid, the other three cases appeared diploid. This was confirmed by DNA flow cytometric analysis with AO. Furthermore, loss of the Y chromosome in a high percentage of cells was seen by FISH in six of eight tumors from male patients. In the other two male samples a possible loss was observed in a small proportion of cells (15%). In three patients from whom the authors had normal gastric mucosa the Y loss was restricted to the tumor cells. These data indicate that in situ hybridization with chromosome-specific repetitive DNA probes can serve as a cytogenetic tool for the analysis of interphase nuclei of solid human tumors, at least with respect to the detection of numerical chromosome abnormalities.\r"

  ".W": "A clinicopathologic analysis of 22 cases of mantle zone lymphoma (MZL) was performed. In lymph node sections, MZL was characterized by the proliferation of neoplastic small lymphoid cells in wide mantles around benign germinal centers. Eighteen cases were of the intermediate lymphocytic type and four cases were of the small lymphocytic type. Immunohistologic analysis of paraffin sections revealed the following characteristic immunophenotype of MZL: L26, LN2, NUB1 and T2/48 positive, and LN5, LN1, AF6 and UCHL1 negative. The immunophenotype of MZL was identical to that of normal primary lymphoid follicles and the mantle zones of secondary follicles, except for the absence of staining with LN5 in MZL. The median age of the patients was 63 years, and the male-to-female ratio was 1.2:1. B symptoms were present in 55% of the patients, and 81% had splenomegaly. An absolute lymphocytosis was present at the time of initial diagnosis in 13% of the patients, and 67% had bone marrow involvement by lymphoma. Thirteen percent of the patients had Stage II disease, 23% had Stage III disease, and 64% had Stage IV disease. All 22 patients received some form of therapy, with 73% receiving multiagent chemotherapy. Eleven patients achieved a complete remission at some time during their course. The overall median survival of the entire group was 88 months. Clinical features which appeared to influence survival adversely included an absolute lymphocyte count above 4000/microliters, a platelet count less than 100,000/microliters, and male sex. Achievement of a complete remission at any time favorably influenced survival. Pathologic features which appeared to influence survival adversely were a mitotic rate of 10 or more per 10 high-power fields (HPF) and the presence of 40 or more large lymphoid cells per 10 HPF. These findings lead the authors to conclude that MZL is a distinctive form of low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\r"

It includes the first flow cytometric analysis of their DNA content and compares the clinical behavior of BSC with conventional squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). An uncommon variant of squamous carcinoma, BSC manifests a predilection for the hypopharynx and base of tongue of men in the sixth decade of life. Histologically, the carcinoma is characterized by a basaloid pattern often in an intimate association with focal squamous differentiation, comedonecrosis, and stromal hyalinization. It is an aggressive neoplasm: seven of the nine patients had metastases to cervical lymph nodes at time of initial surgery and three of the five deaths occurred within 24 months after primary surgery followed by radiotherapy. Its aggressiveness notwithstanding, the biologic course of BSC is similar to that of conventional SCC when clinical stage, site, and treatment are matched. Patients with aneuploid BSC had a better mean survival time (39.5 months) than those with diploid carcinomas (16.3 months). Surgery followed by radiotherapy appears to be the treatment of choice. Because of a high incidence of distant metastases, adjuvant chemotherapy may be warranted.\r"

Follow-up from the Yale Tumor Registry at a median time of 4.6 years showed that tumors invasive to levels T1A and T1B had a 75% 5-year survival, but tumors invasive through the level of the muscularis mucosae but apparently superficial to the muscularis propria (level T1C) had an 11% 5-year survival, which was comparable with the survival of patients with tumors invasive of the muscularis propria. This study suggests the prognostic importance of assessing the depth of invasion in initial biopsy specimens, even when the specimens lack a muscularis propria.\r"

  ".W": "The authors retrospectively analyzed the initial characteristics, treatment, and clinical course in 147 patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET). Median age was 60 years and the M:F ratio was 0.69. At diagnosis, 53 patients were asymptomatic; 50 patients had functional symptoms (mainly vasomotor disturbances); 27 patients had large vessel thrombosis; 27 patients had a bleeding diathesis; and seven patients had both bleeding and thrombosis. The platelet count ranged from 0.7 to 2.92 X 10(12)/l. Forty-five of the 61 tested patients (61%) had prolonged bleeding time and/or platelet hypoaggregation. Three patients had in vitro spontaneous aggregation. No significant correlations were found between hemostatic findings and in vivo bleeding or thrombosis. The incidence of bleeding, however, was higher in patients with more than 2 x 10(12)/l platelets. Of 87 karyotypes performed with banding techniques, only four were abnormal. One hundred twenty-nine patients received one or more cytoreductive agents at diagnosis or during follow-up. Sixty patients received an antiaggregating agent. First-line therapy was radiophosphorus (32P) in 22 patients; busulfan in 35 patients; and hydroxyurea in 72 patients. Hydroxyurea required continuous maintenance therapy and had to be changed to another treatment in 12 of the initial responders because of inadequate control of thrombocythemia. During follow-up, 14 treated patients experienced one or several major thrombotic events. Two untreated patients also had major thrombosis. Only one major bleeding event was seen during follow-up. Median actuarial survival was 73.5% at 7 years and only one patient progressed to acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). These results suggest that large vessel thrombosis is the main complication of ET. It appears largely unpredictable in a given patient at diagnosis but can be largely prevented by the control of thrombocythemia. Because of the low incidence of side effects of treatment in this experience, the authors believe that cytoreductive therapy is indicated in most patients with ET, as long as a group of patients with very low risk of thrombosis is not defined in prospective studies.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-six pediatric patients (ages 0.8-16.8 years) with recurrent intracranial ependymoma were treated for a total of 52 separate cases of relapse from 1970 to 1989. Therapy consisted of surgery in 33 cases and chemotherapy in 38 cases. Twelve patients received radiation at the time of first relapse, and five of these 12 who had initially been treated with surgery and chemotherapy alone were irradiated to full dose. The 2-year actuarial survival and progression-free survival (PFS) rates are 29% and 23%, respectively. Two-year survival after treatment of first relapse is 39%. Of the 52 cases, there have been 44 subsequent relapses (and one septic death), three of which have occurred in the five patients treated with definitive radiation. Twenty-seven relapses have occurred exclusively with local disease. Eight patients failed with disease outside as well as in the primary site. Survival was better for patients who had histologically benign lesions at relapse (53% versus 9%, P less than 0.02), and for patients in first versus subsequent relapse (p less than 0.005). Cisplatin and etoposide (VP-16) appeared to be the most active chemotherapeutic agents. The authors conclude that some patients with histologically benign ependymoma at first relapse may benefit from aggressive therapy, with occasional long-term, progression-free survival possible. Patients with malignant lesions, or patients who relapse a second time, are less likely to benefit from conventional therapy for a significant period of time.\r"

Twenty-five patients with this feature were identified among 408 individuals with SCLC at McGill University (Montreal, Quebec) from 1979 through 1984. Of these, 15 (60%) were confirmed on pathologic review as SCLC (ten intermediate cell, four oat cell, one indeterminate). Pathologic review of a control group comprising 24 other limited-disease patients who were long-term survivors (greater than 20 months) confirmed 20 (84%) as SCLC (eight intermediate cell, 12 oat cell). Ten of the 15 patients with SPN were resected whereas five had chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy as primary treatment. Postoperative chemotherapy was administered to most of the resected patients. The median survival of the 15 patients with SPN was 24 months, a significantly longer survival than the other patients with SCLC. This improved prognosis in patients with SPN may be due to smaller initial tumor burden or to a fundamental biologic difference between SPN and other forms of SCLC.\r"

Its morphologic features, including precursor lesions, were studied in 21 patients diagnosed in 630 consecutive autopsy cases with carcinoma (3.3%). Nineteen of 21 patients had adenocarcinoma and 11 of these 19 patients had gastric carcinoma. The pathogenetic events start with microscopic tumor cell embolism. Tumor emboli do not occlude affected vessels but induce both local activation of coagulation and fibrocellular intimal proliferation, which lead into stenosis or occlusion. Hemodynamically, an increase in vascular resistance results in pulmonary hypertension. In three patients, metastatic carcinoma was unknown before death, and the condition was diagnosed as pulmonary hypertension of unknown origin. Thus, pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy should be considered in the differential diagnosis of primary pulmonary hypertension, particularly in patients with well-known carcinoma who develop acute or subacute cor pulmonale.\r"

There were 77 men and 44 women; 118 were black. The mean age was 63.5 years. Forty-three patients had squamous cell carcinoma, 31 had adenocarcinoma, 18 had large cell carcinoma, 19 had small cell carcinoma, and ten were unclassified. The stages were as follows: two patients in Stage 0, 15 in Stage I, seven in Stage II, 45 in Stage III, and 44 in Stage IV. Eight patients could not be staged at diagnosis. Eighty-five patients (70%) had documented infections; 37 had single episodes; and 48 had more than one. The five most common organisms recovered were alpha/gamma streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The median survival of all infected patients was 4.2 months which was significantly shorter than that of uninfected patients who had a median survival of 12.9 months (P less than 0.05). When Stage III patients were analyzed separately, infected patients lived a median of 5.8 months and uninfected patients, 13.4 months (P less than 0.05). This study indicated that pulmonary infections frequently occur in patients with lung cancer and suggested that they may adversely affect survival.\r"

Although anaerobes are a relatively infrequent cause of renal abscess, there have been recent reports of anaerobic abscesses occurring in renal tumor masses. The present report describes a case of sepsis due to Clostridium perfringens infection of a locally recurrent renal cell carcinoma. The infection may have originated either from tumor invasion of the adjacent bowel or by hematogenous seeding of the mass at the time of colonoscopy. Patients with bulky, necrotic tumors who have invasive diagnostic procedures relating to either the gastrointestinal or urogenital tracts, as well as those having malignancies involving these systems, are at increased risk of infection with bowel anaerobes. Clostridial abscesses with accompanying sepsis occur in this setting, and empiric antibiotic regimens should include coverage for these organisms. Early, aggressive surgical intervention is essential.\r"

Currently, there is little available information to indicate the extent to which cancer patients are satisfied with the quality of care they receive. The present study assessed the perceptions of 232 ambulatory cancer patients about the importance of and satisfaction with the following aspects of care: doctors technical competence and interpersonal and communication skills, accessibility and continuity of care, hospital and clinic care, nonmedical care, family care, and finances. The results indicate that all 60 questionnaire items used were considered to reflect important aspects of care, but that greater importance was given to the technical quality of medical care, the interpersonal and communication skills of doctors, and the accessibility of care. Most patients were satisfied with the opportunities provided to discuss their needs with doctors, the interpersonal support of doctors, and the technical competence of doctors. However, few patients were satisfied with the provision of information concerning their disease, treatment, and symptom control and the provision of care in the home and to family and friends.\r"

However, zones of decreased SI have been observed within the areas of infarction and have been postulated to result from intramyocardial hemorrhage. To explore this phenomenon further, ex vivo spin-echo 1H NMR imaging at 1.5 Tesla was performed in 17 dogs after 24 hr (n = 9) and after 72 hr (n = 8) of coronary artery occlusion. In all dogs, a zone of increased SI (118 +/- 9% compared with normal myocardium) was observed in the distribution of the occluded coronary artery. In 12 of the 17 dogs, zones of decreased SI (92 +/- 8% compared with normal) were seen within or around the central zone of increased SI. Gross inspection and histological assessment of sliced myocardium usually disclosed hemorrhage in the regions of decreased SI. In three of the five dogs with no apparent zones of decreased SI on NMR, the infarct was small, and only minor hemorrhage was observed by gross inspection, whereas in the remaining two dogs no hemorrhage was seen. Myocardial flow in the hemorrhagic regions was significantly higher than in the necrotic core (59 +/- 29% vs. 31 +/- 24% compared with control, P less than 0.05). Image-derived calculation of T2 relaxation times in the different infarcted regions revealed a significant shortening of T2 in the infarcted hemorrhagic zones with decreased SI compared with the infarct zones with increased SI (49 +/- 8 msec vs. 66 +/- 8 msec, P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This technique utilizes a regular extended angioplasty guide wire and enables the exchange of guiding catheters during the angioplasty procedure. In 683 consecutive angioplasty procedures by one operator, this technique has been attempted 57 times in 43 patients (6.3%) and has been successful 51 times (90%). The only failures were when the second catheter had a large or open curve (left Amplatz II, 5/22 unsuccessful or multipurpose, 1/3 unsuccessful). There have been no complications. We conclude that exchange of a guiding catheter over a guide wire by the method described is safe and helpful in cases where different guiding catheters are needed for back-up power once the lesion has been crossed with a guide wire.\r"

A new technique has been developed for measuring such concentration profiles, which offers spatial resolution superior to methods that measure profiles of radiolabeled macromolecules by serially sectioning tissue in planes parallel to the endothelium. In addition, this new method preserves cellular organization and tissue structure and permits measurement of concentration profiles underlying focal endothelial injuries or vascular lesions. The technique quantifies the concentration of a protein by measuring associated peroxidase activity. Although the present study was performed using horseradish peroxidase (HRP), the same principles can be applied to other macromolecules linked to HRP or microperoxidase. The colored reaction product of HRP was detected in transverse aortic sections using an image processing system. In the present study, profiles obtained by this new method were validated by comparison with HRP concentration profiles in rat aortas obtained by a serial slicing technique using radiolabeled HRP. We used the technique to measure high-resolution HRP concentration profiles in the intima and media of normal animals. These concentration profiles suggest that the internal elastic lamina acts as a major barrier to transport of macromolecules across the wall of the normal rat aorta. The new method should allow concentration profiles for macromolecules to be quantified in tissue surrounding vessels in the microcirculation, within the thickened intima of large vessels, and across coronary artery walls.\r"

The whole heart or myocytes of newborn (5-7 days old) and adult rabbits were loaded with the fluorescent pH indicator 2',7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) or calcium indicator fura-2. Left ventricular pressure in the isolated heart preparation and the magnitude of cell contraction in the single-cell preparation were monitored. The heart and single cell were illuminated with excitation lights (340 and 380 nm, respectively, for fura-2 and 438 and 490 nm for BCECF). The intensity of fluorescence from the ventricular surface or from the cell was detected. [Ca]i was estimated from the following ratio: fluorescence at 505 nm during excitation at 340 nm/fluorescence at 505 nm during excitation at 380 nm. pHi was estimated from the following ratio: fluorescence at 530 nm during excitation at 490 nm/fluorescence at 530 nm during excitation at 438 nm. In the newborn, depression of contractile function during respiratory acidosis or metabolic acidosis was less than in the adult. Diastolic and systolic [Ca]i increased during respiratory acidosis in both the newborn and adult, and the net changes in [Ca]i were similar in the two age groups. During respiratory or metabolic acidosis, pHi decreased, but the decrease in the newborn was significantly less than in the adult. These data suggest that the greater resistance of the newborn myocardium to acidosis is due to the smaller change of pHi in this age group and not due to the difference in [Ca]i alteration.\r"

A thermodynamic model describing the radial temperature gradient at steady state during RF-induced heating is proposed. If one assumes that RF power output is adjusted to maintain a constant electrode-tissue interface temperature at all times, then this thermodynamic model predicts that the radius of the RF-induced lesion will be directly proportional to the electrode radius. A total of 76 RF-induced lesions were created in a model of isolated canine right ventricular free wall perfused and superfused with oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit buffer. Electrode radius was varied between 0.75 and 2.25 mm. RF energy (500 kHz) was delivered for 90 seconds, and the power output was adjusted to maintain a constant electrode-tissue interface temperature of 60 degrees C. A strong linear correlation was observed between electrode radius and lesion radius in two dimensions: transverse (p = 0.0001, r = 0.85) and transmural (p = 0.0001, r = 0.89). With these data, the temperature correlation with irreversible myocardial injury in this model was calculated at 46.6-48.8 degrees C. Therefore, the proposed thermodynamic model closely predicts the observed relation between electrode radius and lesion size during RF myocardial heating.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of tidal volume, breathing pattern, and beginning lung volume on the modulation of efferent, muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) in humans. In seven supine, healthy subjects, we measured MSNA (microneurography of the right peroneal nerve) and beat to beat arterial blood pressure during 1) low-frequency breathing (fb = 12 breaths/min) at tidal volumes (VT) of 30% (control), 50%, and 70% of inspiratory capacity and with inspiratory time-to-total breath time ratios (TI/TTOT) of 0.3-0.5 (control), less than 0.3, and greater than 0.5; and 2) simulated exercise hyperpnea (fb = 40 breaths/min; VT = 60-70% inspiratory capacity; minute ventilation, approximately 90 1). To optimize our ability to discern modulatory effects, breathing was performed during three conditions of heightened MSNA: nonhypotensive (less than 20 mm Hg) lower-body negative pressure, isometric handgrip exercise, and posthandgrip vascular occlusion (ischemia). PETCO2 was maintained at normal levels by adjusting the FICO2. Within-breath modulation of MSNA was observed during control tidal breathing with approximately 65% of the burst frequency occurring during the expiratory phase. Deep, low-frequency breathing potentiated this modulatory influence (p less than 0.05 versus control) and produced near-complete sympathoinhibition from onset-mid inspiration to early-mid expiration. Increasing (slow inspiration) and decreasing (fast inspiration) TI/TTOT shifted the onset of sympathoinhibition occurring later (greater change in volume) and earlier (less change in volume) during inspiration, respectively. In two subjects who performed deep breathing from an elevated beginning lung volume, the sympathoinhibition was observed earlier in the inspiratory period and with less change in volume compared with control. These within-breath modulatory effects did not appear to be due solely to changes in arterial pressure. Sustained low- or high (\"exerciselike\")-frequency deep breathing did not alter total minute MSNA compared with control breathing. These results demonstrate that the depth and pattern of breathing, and possibly the starting lung volume, exert marked influences on the within-breath modulation of MSNA in humans. Our findings also suggest that these modulatory effects may be mediated, at least in part, by pulmonary stretch reflexes.\r"

  ".W": "In 10 excised, cross-circulated, isovolumically beating dog left ventricles, we examined the effects of bigeminy, including paired-pulse stimulation, on cardiac oxygen consumption (VO2) and evaluated whether the VO2 versus pressure-volume area (PVA) relation obtained from regularly beating hearts in our previous studies could account for the changes in VO2 during bigeminies with various coupling intervals. The extrasystolic interval (ESI) was decreased in four steps from 300 msec (regular rhythm) to paired-pulse stimulation (less than or equal to 210 msec). The sum of ESI and the postextrasystolic interval was always held constant (600 msec); therefore, the number of excitations was 200/min at any ESI. Both VO2 and PVA were measured in four runs: a small volume run at a ventricular volume of 13 ml, a large volume of 12 ml, a calcium run in which contractility was enhanced by CaCl2 at a small volume of 12 ml, and a verapamil run in which contractility was depressed by verapamil at a large volume of 20 ml. In any run, both VO2 and PVA were unchanged at long ESIs (greater than or equal to 250 msec) from each control value at regular rhythm, but VO2 markedly increased at short ESIs (less than or equal to 230 msec). VO2s during bigeminies with various ESIs were comparable with the theoretical VO2 values that were calculated by the VO2-PVA relation at regular rhythm. However, the theoretical VO2 values underestimated the measured VO2 values at the shortest ESIs under a high volume loading and in a high contractile state. This indicates that the PVA concept can be expanded to various arrhythmias unless ESI becomes very short.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the hemodynamic effects of changing volume loading in the chick embryo, before autonomic innervation, to test the hypothesis that the Frank-Starling mechanism functions in the embryonic myocardium. Dorsal aortic blood velocity was measured by pulsed Doppler. Heart rate and aortic diameter were also measured to calculate cardiac output and stroke volume index. Vitelline arterial and ventricular pressures were measured with a servo-null micropressure system in stage 24 embryos. Infusing isotonic solution intravenously resulted in linear increases in stroke volume index for stages 18 (y = 388x + 6.89), 24 (y = 466x + 7.86), and 29 (y = 549x + 4.96). The slopes and intercepts were statistically the same for all three stages. Similar volume loading in stage 24 embryos initially increased mean arterial pressure linearly, but at higher loading conditions, the rate of rise lessens. Thus, volume loading resulted in a decrease in vascular resistance. Withdrawing blood from stage 24 embryos resulted in a decrease in ventricular peak systolic and end-diastolic pressures. With reinfusion of the blood, systolic and end-diastolic pressures initially rose above baseline levels and later returned to normal. We conclude that a length-tension relation is present in the preinnervated embryonic heart and that vascular resistance changes inversely with loading conditions. We speculate that these mechanisms are the primary hemodynamic control mechanism in the early chick embryo.\r"

  ".W": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is stored with norepinephrine in sympathetic nerves throughout the cardiovascular system and is released during activation of the sympathetic nervous system in humans and other animals. After stimulation of the cardiac sympathetic nerves in anesthetized dogs, the action of the vagus nerve on heart rate is attenuated for a prolonged period. This attenuation of cardiac vagal action is also seen after injection of NPY. Both sympathetic stimulation and exogenous NPY inhibit cardiac vagal effects by acting on postganglionic vagal nerves. Because the supply of neuropeptides to nerve terminals is by axonal transport, it might be expected that repeated stimulation of cardiac sympathetic nerves would deplete the sympathetic neural factor, proposed to be NPY. In all 11 dogs of this study, repeated episodes of stimulating the cardiac sympathetic nerve (16 Hz for 1 minute each) had a diminishing effect in attenuating cardiac vagal action. However, the episodes of sympathetic stimulation did not show diminishing effectiveness in increasing heart rate. Exogenous NPY had similar inhibitory effects on vagal action whether given at the beginning or the end of the episodes of sympathetic stimulation. Transmural stimulation of sympathetic nerves around rabbit ear arteries produced effects that are also mimicked by NPY. These are prolonged potentiation of contractions evoked by injection of norepinephrine or by brief bursts of transmural stimulation. Repeated stimulations in this case also had diminishing abilities to evoke such potentiations. Both sets of observations are consistent with repeated stimulation of sympathetic nerves causing depletion of a nonadrenergic transmitter, possibly NPY.\r"

  ".U": "90305052\r", 
  ".W": "The L-type calcium current was investigated in normal and hypertrophied rat ventricular myocytes as a possible cause of the action potential lengthening that has been reported during hypertrophy. Regulation of the calcium current (ICa) by a beta-adrenergic agonist (isoproterenol) was also analyzed since beta-agonist-induced positive inotropy is less marked in hypertrophied heart. Left ventricular hypertrophy was induced by stenosis of the abdominal aorta. For recording ICa, the whole-cell patch-clamp technique was used. Potassium currents were suppressed by replacing K+ ions with Cs+ ions in both the extracellular and intracellular media, and sodium current was blocked by 50 microM tetrodotoxin. The Ca2+ current was larger in hypertrophied cells (2.2 +/- 0.6 nA [n= 31]) than in normal cells (1.2 +/- 0.5 nA [n = 33]). However, if one relates ICa amplitude to the cell membrane area, as estimated by membrane capacitance measurement, no significant difference was observed in current density (8.5 +/- 2.5 pA/pF [n = 31] and 8.3 +/- 2.1 pA/pF [n = 33] in hypertrophied and in normal cells, respectively). In both cell types, ICa displayed the same voltage and time dependence. When expressed as a percentage, the maximal increase in ICa amplitude that was obtained with 100 nM isoproterenol was less in hypertrophied cells (+78%) than in normal cells (+120%). The sensitivity of ICa to beta-adrenergic stimulation was not modified: EC50 was 3.8 nM for hypertrophied cells and 4.8 nM for normal cells. Forskolin and cyclic AMP were as effective in both cell types. Stimulation of ICa by beta-adrenergic agonist was decreased in agreement with a reduced number of binding sites of beta-agonists and/or an altered coupling of the G-proteins.\r"

  ".U": "90305053\r", 
  ".W": "Arterial pressure at zero flow (Pz = 0) that is higher than venous pressure (Pv) in dynamic pressure-flow relations has been explained by the presence of an arteriolar Starling resistor (SR) mechanism (i.e., vascular waterfall) or the discharge of vascular capacitance. To determine which was predominant, I studied in vivo hind limbs of 18 anesthetized dogs in which femoral arteries were cannulated with in-line electromagnetic flow probes to measure inflow (Qin), Pv was controlled, and collateral flow was eliminated with a tourniquet. Pz = 0 was obtained by turning flow to zero. Three tests were applied: 1) Pv was raised in steps with either constant Qin or constant arterial pressure (Pa) to determine the pressure at which upstream vascular characteristics were affected by a change in Pv, 2) the time to reach Pz = 0 was varied to determine compliance effects, and 3) an equation was developed to determine if experimentally derived parameters could explain Pz = 0 without invoking an SR. With constant Qin and a Pz = 0 of 56.9 +/- 11.7 mm Hg (time to Pz = 0, 3 seconds), Pv could be raised by 9.6 +/- 6.2 to 16.3 +/- 6.0 mm Hg before Pa increased, and with constant Pa, Pv could be raised by 6.8 +/- 7.3 to 14.0 +/- 8.0 mm Hg before Qin decreased. With increasing times to reach Pz = 0, Pz = 0 initially dropped precipitously, but then decreased by only a small amount over the next 5-10 seconds even though arterial pressure was much above Pv. This could be explained by an SR mechanism with a critical pressure of 42.3 +/- 11.4 mm Hg and an arterial compliance of 0.0104 +/- 0.0023 ml.mm Hg-1 (n = 6). There was no value for the compliance that described the results when the arterial outflow pressure was Pv. Thus, this study supports the hypothesis that an SR mechanism is present in the vascular system. It is most likely precapillary, and in the resting limb, it has a value of 40-50 mm Hg. However, Pz = 0 in dynamic pressure-flow studies of less than 4 seconds is also greatly influenced by capacitance effects and the initial Pa.\r"

  ".W": "Thrombin rapidly binds to and saturates rabbit aorta endothelium in vitro, a process that depends on pericellular glycosaminoglycans and that is inhibited by heparin. To characterize the initial adsorption of thrombin to the endothelium in vivo, an enzymatically inactive derivative, FPR-thrombin (i.e., thrombin inactivated by D-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone), was prepared. The binding characteristics of thrombin and FPR-thrombin to heparin-Sepharose and to the endothelial surface of rabbit aorta segments in vitro were compared. From these experiments, we concluded that FPR-thrombin mimicked, qualitatively, the binding of thrombin to the endothelium. When injected intravenously, 125I-FPR-thrombin was removed rapidly from the rabbit circulation (T1/2, approximately 1.4 minutes) and simultaneously was adsorbed by the vascular endothelium, particularly in the lung. By injecting heparin (1,000 units/kg i.v.) before 125I-FPR-thrombin, adsorption by the aorta endothelium at 30 minutes after injection was reduced by 90%, and T1/2 was increased to approximately 3.4 minutes. Heparin, administered at various times after 125I-FPR-thrombin, liberated a significant proportion of 125I-FPR-thrombin from the endothelial surface into the plasma compartment as shown by a pronounced \"spike\" on the plasma curve, a concomitant loss of radioactivity from the lung and from the aorta endothelium, and analysis of the radioactive components of plasma taken before and after heparin injection. Thus, FPR-thrombin was cleared rapidly from the circulation, and endothelium-bound FPR-thrombin was released into the circulation by heparin.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether acute left ventricular failure associated with myocardial infarction leads to architectural changes in the spared nonischemic portion of the ventricular wall, large infarcts were produced in rats, and the animals were killed 2 days after surgery. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was increased, whereas left ventricular dP/dt and systolic pressure were decreased, indicating the presence of severe ventricular dysfunction. Absolute infarct size, determined by measuring the fraction of myocyte nuclei lost from the left ventricular free wall, averaged 63%. Transverse midchamber diameter increased by 20%, and wall thickness diminished by 33%. The mural number of myocytes in this spared region of the left ventricular free wall decreased by 36% and the capillary profiles by 40%. The combination of these functional abnormalities and structural rearrangement of the wall resulted in a 7.8-fold increase in diastolic wall stress. A comparable analysis of the interventricular septum demonstrated a 24% reduction in the number of cells across the septal thickness, whereas capillaries were diminished by 26%. Moreover, a 7.2-fold elevation in diastolic stress was computed in this region of the ventricle. The augmentation in diastolic stress was associated with a 22% and a 16% myocyte cellular hypertrophy in the wall and septum, respectively. In conclusion, side-to-side slippage of myocytes in the myocardium occurs in association with ventricular dilatation after a large myocardial infarction and contributes to ventricular remodeling and the occurrence of decompensated eccentric hypertrophy.\r"

It is unclear if the decreased Ca2+ pump function results from a lower amount of Ca2(+)-ATPase protein or a decreased pumping activity of the enzyme. To determine if these alterations could be mediated by changes in the amount of the protein itself, the level of the messenger RNA (mRNA) coding for the Ca2(+)-ATPase of the SR of Fischer rat hearts (4- and 30-month-old rats) were quantitated with a Northern blotting technique. We observed that the levels of SR Ca2(+)-ATPase mRNA were 60% lower in old rats as compared with young rats, suggesting that a quantitative reduction in the levels of the corresponding protein could occur during aging to explain the delayed diastolic relaxation documented in old animals as opposed to a change in the specific activity of this enzyme. The thyroid hormone responsiveness of SR Ca2(+)-ATPase mRNA has been previously established. We have found in this study that the thyroxine levels were consistently lower in old rats; however, this difference was relatively small (4.3 +/- 0.7 and 3.1 +/- 0.8 micrograms/dl [mean +/- SD), respectively, in young and old rats). In addition, no age-induced decrease in 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine levels was observed, suggesting that the aging process itself may be responsible for the changes in SR Ca2(+)-ATPase mRNA levels.\r"

To assess the potential usefulness of this compound as a marker for hypoxic myocardium, we measured the accumulation of [3H]fluoromisonidazole in isolated adult rat myocytes under normoxic, hypoxic (5,000 ppm O2), and anoxic conditions. Both anoxia and hypoxia caused a marked increase in [3H]fluoromisonidazole accumulation. Relative to uptake during normoxia, uptake during anoxia was increased by 8.4-fold at 60 minutes and 26.5-fold at 180 minutes (p less than 0.001). During hypoxia, uptake was increased by 4.4-fold at 60 minutes and by 15.3-fold at 180 minutes (p less than 0.0001) and occurred in the absence of significant cell injury as measured by release of creatine kinase and changes in cell morphology. Additional studies demonstrated a slow oxygen-insensitive efflux of fluoromisonidazole or labeled metabolite(s) from myocytes reincubated in drug-free medium. We conclude that fluoromisonidazole is avidly retained in hypoxic myocytes and thus may be suitable for noninvasive detection of hypoxic myocardium using positron emission tomography.\r"

Using a \"jacket electrode\" with 111 bipolar electrodes in a nylon matrix, we mapped in situ the atrial epicardial surface during atrial flutter in dogs with sterile pericarditis. Of 21 episodes of reentrant atrial flutter, only four showed double-loop (\"figure-eight\") reentry, whereas in 17 episodes a single loop was present. During initiation of single-loop reentry, an arc of functional block extended to the atrioventricular (AV) ring. This forced activation to proceed as a single wave around the free end of the arc, before breaking through the arc close to the AV ring. Activation continued as one loop around an arc close to the AV ring (in eight episodes) or around a combined functional and anatomic obstacle (in nine episodes) when the arc joined an atrial vessel. A zone of slow conduction was consistently bordered by the arc of block and the AV ring or by the anatomic obstacle and the AV ring. Spontaneous termination occurred when conduction failed in this area and the arc rejoined the AV ring. High-density recordings (2 mm) along the arc of block showed double potentials separated by an isoelectric interval, interpreted as local activation and electrotonus due to activation on the opposite side of the arc. Histologically, a diffuse inflammatory reaction involved 50-80% of the atrial wall. A transitional layer of myocardial bundles with preserved cross striation, but separated by edema and inflammatory cells, was enclosed between an epicardial layer of fragmented myocytes and an endocardial layer of grossly intact myocardium. There were no distinctive features at sites of functional conduction block or slowed conduction. In conclusion, single-loop reentry is the common pattern during atrial flutter in this model. Its induction depends on an interaction of the AV ring, a functional arc of block, and a zone of slow conduction. The location of the inferior vena cava predisposes the lower right atrium to this type of reentry.\r"

Cardiac myocytes exposed to amiodarone in the absence of triiodothyronine (T3) showed predominant V1. When cardiac myocytes were exposed to amiodarone in the presence of T3, they expressed prevalent isomyosin V3, or both V3 and V1 equally. Supraphysiological concentration of T3 counteracted the effect of amiodarone on myocytes, showing the expression of predominant isomyosin V1. Amiodarone has inhibitory effects on DNA synthesis and differentiation of cardiac myocytes. Myocytes treated with amiodarone showed maximum labeling index with 11% labeled cells after day 1. Subsequently, the labeling indexes declined and on the third day ceased, as opposed to the control culture, which attained a peak in labeling index with 60% labeled myocytes on the third day. The labeling indexes declined, showing 11% labeled myocytes at the terminal time point. Myocytes treated with amiodarone lost most of the well-organized myofibrils and other organelles, and instead contained sparse, scattered segments of myofibrils, free myofilaments, many mitochondria with disrupted cristae, and autophagic vacuoles. The results demonstrated that amiodarone has a direct influence on the expression of isomyosin by cardiac myocytes. Furthermore, this drug has inhibitory and degrading effects on the growth and differentiation of cardiac myocytes.\r"

Seven lambs underwent balloon atrial septostomy and were instrumented with vascular catheters, an electromagnetic flow transducer on the aorta, and a balloon occluder on the aorta. Four different preload conditions were established by volume infusion or withdrawal. Aortic flow was measured continuously during gradual occlusion of the aorta. Curves relating mean left atrial pressure to stroke volume before balloon inflation showed a plateau, with little increase in stroke volume with increases in atrial pressure above 7 mm Hg. With balloon inflation, stroke volume decreased linearly with increases in mean arterial pressure. Curves relating left atrial pressure to stroke volume constructed at constant mean atrial pressure showed no plateau but showed continued increases in stroke volume as left atrial pressure was increased to 10 mmHg. When mean arterial pressure is constant, the Starling mechanism is operative in newborn left ventricles. The plateau in newborn lamb function curves is due to increases in mean arterial pressure that accompany volume infusion.\r"

  ".W": "Computer simulations and isolated tissue experiments were used to characterize the relation between excitability and margin of safety for propagation in anisotropic ventricular myocardium. Longitudinal, uniform transverse, and nonuniform transverse tissue directions were modeled in a one-dimensional Beeler-Reuter based cable. Stimulation threshold was smallest in the nonuniform transverse direction. The safety factor for propagation was determined in the model as the total axial charge that was available for depolarizing downstream tissue divided by the threshold charge that was just sufficient for continued propagation and was largest in the longitudinal direction. The strength-interval plot for the junction between simulated longitudinal and nonuniform transverse directions identified a range of stimulus strengths and intervals that resulted in nonuniform transverse but not longitudinal propagation. When high values of transverse resistance were used, higher stimulus strengths during premature stimulation resulted in longitudinal but not nonuniform transverse propagation. The experimental strength interval plots from 17 L-shaped preparations of isolated sheep epicardial muscles had similar characteristics. In nine additional L-shaped tissue experiments, changing extracellular K+ concentrations from 4 to 20 mM resulted in progressive membrane depolarization and conduction impairment in both directions. However, in eight of nine experiments, complete block occurred first in the transverse direction. In one experiment, block was simultaneous in both directions. We conclude that, under normal conditions, threshold requirements for active propagation are lower for transverse than for longitudinal propagation. In addition, when active membrane properties are impaired, the safety factor for propagation is larger in the direction along the longitudinal axis of the cells.\r"

In a double-blind placebo-randomized study, nitredipine effectively lowered the blood pressure (p less than 0.001) before hemodialysis without causing postdialysis hypotension. The antihypertensive effect of nitrendipine was greater in patients with significant salt and water retention, as indicated by interdialytic body weight gain (delta BW), that is, a significant correlation was observed between delta BW and the decrease in blood pressure (r = 0.72; p less than 0.001). The antihypertensive effect was not related to age, pretreatment plasma renin activity, or serum-ionized calcium concentration. After nitrendipine, a time-related decrease in aortic (p less than 0.005) and femoral (p less than 0.05) pulse-wave velocity was observed with a significant time-treatment interaction (p less than 0.01). Nitrendipine treatment did not influence left ventricular mass (which was positively correlated with delta BW; p less than 0.01) but was associated with an increase in the left ventricular ejection fraction. The increase in ejection fraction was correlated with changes in aortic pulse-wave velocity (r = 0.548; p less than 0.02) but not with changes in blood pressure (r = 0.352; p = 0.19) or delta BW.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The local reflection coefficient (r) at the aortoiliac junction was estimated in vessels removed at autopsy from 15 females and 31 males aged 2 months to 88 years by calculating the characteristic impedance (Zc) of the abdominal aorta and the two common iliac arteries. Zc was evaluated for each vessel by measuring cross-sectional area from radiographs and propagation velocity of an isolated pressure impulse generated by a solenoid-driven piston connected to the distal end of the abdominal aorta, and detected at several sites a known distance from the junction. Attenuation coefficients in the aorta were estimated from the peak amplitude of the impulse at these several sites. We observed significant decreases with age in abdominal aortic attenuation coefficient (gamma = 0.053-5 x 10(-4) age [yr], r = -0.42, p less than 0.005), and the area ratio (AR) of the junction (sum of the iliac cross-sectional areas/aortic cross-sectional area) (AR = 0.93-0.002 x age [yr], r = -0.31, p less than 0.05). Bifurcation angle (Angle) and aortic propagation velocity (caorta) increased significantly (angle = 40.2 + 0.26 x age [yr], r = 0.41, p less than 0.01; caorta (ms-1) = 7.59 + 0.175 x age [yr], r = 0.69, p less than 0.0001). No significant association between age and iliac propagation velocity was found. On the basis of area measurements alone, it has been argued that the observed decrease in area ratio with age causes r to become more positive. The lack of age-related changes in iliac propagation velocity (and hence stiffness), an observation confirmed by most of the few reports in the literature, and the large increase in abdominal aortic stiffness, however, greatly outweighed the area ratio changes and caused a significant decline in reflection coefficient from +0.3 in early life to -0.3 in old age. (Reflection coefficient = 0.30-0.0065 x age [yr], r = -0.68, p less than 0.0001). Between the ages of 30 and 60 years, its absolute value was less than 0.1, confirming in vivo work on subjects within this age range. In children, a significant positive reflection at the distal end of the aorta will amplify the pulse wave in this region. As this vessel becomes stiffer with increasing age, amplification will increase, whereas the increasingly negative value of r will partially offset this rise, reducing pulse pressure on either side of the junction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

During the operative periods of 1965-1971 (n = 62), 1972-1976 (n = 164), 1977-1981 (n = 158), and 1982-1986 (n = 246), decreases in cardiothoracic index (0.56 +/- 0.06, 0.53 +/- 0.06, 0.52 +/- 0.06, and 0.51 +/- 0.06; p less than 0.0001), in the prevalence of functional classes III and IV (87%, 76%, 68%, and 62%; p less than 0.0001), and of left ventricular (50%, 39%, 36%, and 30%; p less than 0.05) were accompanied by improved survival (5 year/10 year +/- SE: 73 +/- 6%/53 +/- 6%, 82 +/- 3%/65 +/- 4%, 89 +/- 3%/79 +/- 4%, and 87 +/- 3%/-; p = 0.002) despite increasing age (56 +/- 9, 57 +/- 11, 59 +/- 10, and 61 +/- 11 years; p less than 0.01). A Cox regression analysis identified peak-to-peak systolic gradient (p = 0.0001; inversely related to death rate), cardiothoracic index (p = 0.0003), left ventricular failure (p = 0.0005), prosthetic orifice diameter of 15 mm or less (p = 0.001), age (p = 0.003), ventricular ectopic beats (p = 0.004), male gender (p = 0.03), and antianginal/antiarrhythmic treatment (p = 0.03) as independent risk factors. A prognostic index calculated from the final Cox model stratified the patients into eight risk groups, having observed +/- SE/predicted/expected (matched background population) 10-year survival rates of 90 +/- 7% (n = 29)/94%/91%, 84 +/- 6% (n = 61)/89%/87%, 86 +/- 3% (n = 105)/83%/81%, 75 +/- 4% (n = 165)/75%/77%, 62 +/- 6% (n = 128)/63%/74%, 51 +/- 8% (n = 84)/47%/71%, 29 +/- 9% (n = 40)/31%/67%, and 16 +/- 9% (n = 18)/14%/54% (p less than 0.000001/-/-). Excess mortality relative to the background populations prevailed predominantly in risk groups 5-8 and was mainly caused by congestive heart failure. Thus, improved long-term survival during the 22-year operative period was related to improved preoperative patient status. Earlier operation (= low prognostic index) inferred a survival rate comparable to that of a matched background population. The prognostic index was probably predominantly related to preoperative myocardial damage that caused late predictable death from congestive heart failure.\r"

Neutrophils were separated by means of the Ficoll-Hypaque system and were stimulated to detect release of elastase and generation of superoxide anion. Plasma levels of elastase were also measured by an immunoenzymatic method. PTCA was successful in all patients.

  ".W": "Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging has the potential to serially assess left ventricular (LV) volumes with optimal accuracy because it is a high-resolution, three-dimensional, noninvasive modality. Previous NMR studies to assess LV volumes have been suboptimal, as they have used either planes aligned with the axes of the body, which are compromised by partial volume effects, or spin-echo techniques that have been time-consuming to acquire and analyze. Accordingly, for LV volume measurement, we developed a gradient-echo (cine) NMR strategy that uses two orthogonal planes intersecting along the intrinsic long axis of the heart (two-chamber and four-chamber). This approach was validated against calibrated contrast biplane LV cineangiography (CATH) and also compared with a previously reported short-axis spin-echo NMR method. Twenty-one patients underwent CATH and NMR (long-axis, n = 21; short-axis, n = 14) within a 3-day interval. Although both long- and short-axis NMR LV volumes and ejection fractions correlated well with CATH (r greater than 0.90, p less than 0.001 in all), end-diastolic volumes by both long-axis (161 +/- 85 ml) and short-axis (151 +/- 81 ml) NMR were systematically less than those by CATH (182 +/- 85 ml) (p less than 0.05). Consequently, ejection fractions by long-axis (48 +/- 17%) and short-axis (49 +/- 17%) NMR consistently underestimated those by CATH (54 +/- 16%, p less than 0.05). End-systolic volumes by long-axis (94 +/- 71 ml) and short-axis (87 +/- 72 ml) NMR were not significantly different from those by CATH (92 +/- 69 ml). Both NMR techniques had low intraobserver and interobserver variation (less than 11%); however, short-axis spin-echo NMR involved longer acquisition/reconstruction (35 versus 18 minutes) and analysis (25 versus 10 minutes) times. We conclude that both short-axis spin-echo and long-axis gradient-echo NMR approaches reliably estimate LV volumes. Currently, the long-axis strategy appears more practical for clinical use because the scan and analysis times are relatively short.\r"

  ".W": "There is currently no clinical approach to precisely measure right ventricular (RV) mass. We postulated that the radiological mode of ultrafast computed tomography (CT) of 3-mm-thick slices with 0.7-mm resolution would allow sufficient resolution to accurately estimate RV mass. Using this radiological mode, we serially imaged the entire right ventricle from apex to base, gated to end diastole, and applied Simpson's rule to calculate mass of the RV free wall. Thirteen mongrel dogs (weight, 6-30 kg) were studied. The free wall mass of the right ventricle was in the range of 12.0-47.5 g and averaged 35.4 +/- 3.7 g (mean +/- SEE). The correlation between RV mass estimated by ultrafast CT and actual RV mass was r equaling 0.85, SEE equaling 5.5 g, slope equaling 0.99, and gamma intercept equaling -1.8. Intraobserver and interobserver variability (r = 0.99 and r = 0.99, respectively) was excellent with a standard deviation (SD) equal to 1.5 and 1.8, respectively. The effect of variable RV preload (right atrial pressure, -5 to +20 mm Hg) on accuracy of RV mass measurements produced minimal error (SD = 3.6 g) in RV mass measurements. Seven normal young healthy men were also studied. The free wall mass of the right ventricle was in the range of 48.3-67.4 g and averaged 54.6 +/- 2.8 g (mean +/- SEE). The left ventricular to right ventricular (LV:RV) ratio averaged 3.2 +/- 0.2:1. These results are in agreement with human autopsy data in healthy males reporting mean RV mass equal to 46 g and an LV:RV ratio equal to 3.4:1. Because imaging every 3-mm slice from apex to base requires two contrast injections, we determined the accuracy of RV mass measurements if only every fourth 3-mm slice with interpolation was used. RV mass measurements using every slice or every fourth slice with interpolation were excellent (dogs, r = 0.99; humans, r = 0.97). It is concluded that high resolution CT imaging (3-mm tomograms) allows accurate measurements of RV mass. It is possible to add this stop-action mode of ultrafast CT, to previous CT studies, using every fourth tomographic slice for mass determinations and only one additional contrast injection of 40-60 ml. This should permit the study of progression and regression of RV mass in patients with various diseases.\r"

  ".W": "In conscious dogs with complete atrioventricular block, overdrive pacing of the idioventricular rhythm normally results in overdrive suppression (OS). Frequently, however, we observed another response to overdrive, that is, QRS complex or complexes with unexpectedly short coupling intervals followed by normal OS. We have named such a QRS complex a \"premature escape beat\" (PEB). Based on the response of PEBs to electrical stimulation, we postulate that PEBs are based on triggered activity resulting from delayed afterdepolarizations. This hypothesis was tested in 82 experiments by 1) stimulation under control conditions and in combination with 2) subtoxic and toxic amounts of ouabain 20-50 micrograms/kg, 3) lidocaine 3 mg/kg, and 4) doxorubicin 16-24 mg/m2. The stimulation protocol, which was repeated at random five to 10 times, consisted of 10 and 50 stimuli using interstimulus intervals of 200, 400, 600, and 800 msec. This protocol was not only performed during spontaneous idioventricular rhythm but also during a continuously paced rhythm with interstimulus intervals of 800 msec. It was found that 1) the chance to induce a PEB or PEBs increased and 2) their first postpacing interval significantly decreased using short or fast drives, or both. Ouabain increased significantly and in a dose-dependent manner 1) the ability to induce PEBs and 2) the number of PEBs per stimulation-train, and also shortened their first postpacing interval. Opposite effects were seen after lidocaine, doxorubicin, and continuous pacing as follows: 1) a lower incidence of PEBs and 2) lengthening of their first postpacing interval. These results support our hypothesis that PEBs are based on triggered activity resulting from delayed afterdepolarizations.\r"

  ".W": "The automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator has been shown to dramatically improve survival. The future refinement of these devices requires a clear understanding of their mechanism of action. We performed the following study to test two hypotheses: 1) When defibrillation is successful, fibrillating activity must be annihilated in a critical mass of both ventricles; and 2) when defibrillation is unsuccessful, at least one area of the ventricular mass has been left fibrillating. Unipolar Ag/AgCl sintered electrodes were directly coupled from triangular arrays at 40 epicardial locations (total, 120 recording sites) that covered both right and left ventricular surfaces and were designed to measure the voltage gradient generated by the shock at each triangular array as well as the underlying myocardial electrical activity before and immediately after the shock. An algorithm was developed and tested that reliably scored whether a postshock activation was a continuation of the immediately previous fibrillating activity. This technique was applied to 203 defibrillation attempts in six open-chest dogs during electrically induced ventricular fibrillation. There were 139 successful defibrillation attempts and 64 unsuccessful attempts. Monophasic truncated exponential 10-msec defibrillation shocks (0.5-35 J) were delivered through an anodal patch on the right atrium and a cathodal patch on the left ventricular apex. In all cases of unsuccessful defibrillation, at least one ventricular site could be clearly identified that failed to be defibrillated. In cases of successful defibrillation two distinct patterns were observed: 1) complete annihilation of fibrillating activity at all sites or 2) nearly complete cessation of fibrillating activity with a single area of persistent fibrillation that subsequently self-extinguished within one to three activations. This single site in the second form of successful defibrillation was located in the region of minimum voltage gradient produced by the defibrillating waveform and was occasionally accompanied by dynamic encapsulation with refractory tissue as a result of a wavefront emanating from a region that had undergone successful defibrillation. These results support the hypothesis that a critical mass of myocardium must be affected for successful defibrillation and that unsuccessful defibrillation is always accompanied by residual fibrillating activity in at least one site. The results also demonstrate that the size of the critical mass required for successful defibrillation can be less than 100%.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies indicate that exposure of fibrinogen receptors associated with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex contributes to platelet loss during cardiopulmonary bypass. Recently, we isolated a number of RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp)-containing, low molecular weight, cysteine-rich peptides from viper venoms. These peptides, which we propose to call \"disintegrins,\" block platelet-fibrinogen interaction and platelet aggregation. We compared the effect of RGDS (Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser) and four disintegrins (echistatin, flavoridin, albolabrin, and bitistatin) on platelet behavior in a membrane oxygenator. During simulated extracorporeal circulation for 2 hours, platelet count decreased to about 30% of initial values. Addition of echistatin (60-200 nM), albolabrin (60-200 nM), bitistatin (60 nM), and flavoridin (45 nM) significantly inhibited platelet loss in the circuit. RGDS (33 microM) did not show any significant inhibitory effect. ADP-induced platelet aggregation was inhibited in samples of platelet-rich plasma taken from the circuits containing disintegrins. However, echistatin appeared to be a more potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation, whereas albolabrin and flavoridin interfered more selectively with platelet loss from the circuit. Echistatin prevented the accumulation of glycoprotein IIIa on the surface of the circuit. Echistatin (60-200 nM), flavoridin (45 nM), bitistatin (60 nM), and albolabrin (200 nM) significantly inhibited the loss of beta-thromboglobulin from platelets into circulating plasma. Electron microscopy studies demonstrated shape change but not degranulation in platelets circulating in the presence of 200 nM echistatin. On the other hand, this peptide (up to 1,000 nM) did not prevent loss of alpha granules and beta-thromboglobulin from thrombin-stimulated platelets, although it prevented their aggregation. In conclusion, disintegrins protect platelets in the circuit by preventing their adhesion to surfaces and, therefore, preventing fragmentation of adhered platelets under the shear stress of flowing blood. This study indicates that disintegrins may be potential candidates for platelet protection during cardiopulmonary bypass.\r"

Vital status as of January 1, 1988 was ascertained for 98% of the 548 patients who participated in the baseline survey and were alive as of January 1, 1982. Fifty-four cases died during the 6-year follow-up (32 male, 22 female). Proportional hazards analysis revealed that heavy smoking was a significant independent predictor of all-cause mortality among females but not males. The excess mortality in female diabetics was explained primarily by a marked excess risk of coronary heart disease mortality in smokers. These data strongly suggest that cigarette smoking, especially among diabetic females, should be avoided in order to improve longevity.\r"

We used a cross-sectional retrospective analysis of exercise test and coronary angiographic data. The study took place in a 1,200-bed Veterans Affairs Medical Center; participants were 328 male patients who had undergone both a sign and symptom-limited treadmill test and coronary angiography. The sensitivity of the ST segment/heart rate index was 54% at a cut point of 0.021 mm/(beats/min), corresponding to a specificity of 73%. The standard visual ST segment analysis had a sensitivity of 58% at this same specificity, which corresponded to an ST segment cut point of 1-mm depression relative to rest (p = NS). Similarly, for diagnosing three-vessel or left main coronary disease, no significant difference was found between the sensitivities or the two measurements at cut points of equivalent specificity. In this consecutive series of patients presenting for routine clinical testing, the ST segment/heart rate index did not improve the diagnostic accuracy of the exercise test for identifying the presence or severity of coronary artery disease relative to standard visual criteria.\r"

Amiodarone pulmonary toxicity was diagnosed in 33 of the 573 patients (5.8%), based on symptoms and new chest radiographic abnormalities (32 of 33 patients) and supported by abnormal pulmonary biopsy (13 of 14 patients), low pulmonary diffusion capacity (DLCO) (nine of 13 patients), and/or abnormal gallium lung scan (11 of 16 patients). Toxicity occurred between 6 days and 60 months of treatment for a cumulative risk of 9.1%, with the highest incidence occurring during the first 12 months (18 of 33 patients). Older patients developed it more frequently (62.7 +/- 1.7 versus 57.4 +/- 0.5 years, p = 0.018), with no cases diagnosed in patients who started therapy at less than 40 years of age. Gender, underlying heart disease, arrhythmia, and pretreatment chest radiographic, spirometric, or lung volume abnormalities did not predict development of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity, whereas pretreatment DLCO was lower in the group developing it (76.0 +/- 5.5% versus 90.4 +/- 1.4%, p = 0.01). There was a higher mean daily amiodarone maintenance dose in the pulmonary toxicity group (517 +/- 25 versus 409 +/- 6 mg, p less than 0.001) but no difference in loading dose. No patient receiving a mean daily maintenance dose less than 305 mg developed pulmonary toxicity. Patients who developed toxicity had higher plasma desethylamiodarone (2.34 +/- 0.18 versus 1.92 +/- 0.04 micrograms/ml, p = 0.009) but not amiodarone concentrations during maintenance therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The same parameters were determined in another 10 patients (group 2, with different spontaneous AV relations) during AV reciprocating tachycardia or AV nodal reciprocating tachycardia and during high right atrial (RA) pacing at the tachycardia cycle length. In group 1 patients, peak and mean RA pressure, RA effective refractory period (RA-ERP), and left atrial (LA) size all decreased to minimal values at an AV interval of 120 msec and remained low as the AV interval was increased and approached 400 msec. The increase in each of the variables from its lowest to greatest value was as follows: Mean systemic blood pressure, 20.9 +/- 3.1 mm Hg; LA size, 0.55 +/- 0.05 cm; RA peak pressure, 10.4 +/- 1.8 mm Hg; RA mean pressure, 3.5 +/- 0.6 mm Hg; and RA-ERP, 22.5 +/- 3.0 msec, p less than 0.001 for each. The weighted mean correlation coefficient with RA-ERP was significant for RA peak pressure and LA size (p less than 0.001 for each).

The procedure was successful in 67 lesions (88%), with a decrease in diameter stenosis from 80 +/- 11% to 5 +/- 15% after atherectomy (p less than 0.01). One or more complications occurred in six patients (9%), including non-Q wave myocardial infarction (three patients, 4.5%), femoral arterial injury requiring surgical repair (two patients, 3%), and proximal dissection leading to emergency bypass surgery (one patient, 1.5%). Despite these favorable acute results, the 6-month lesion restenosis rate was 30% by life-table analysis. Light microscopy of retrieved tissue revealed atherosclerotic plaque in 94%, media in 67%, and adventitia in 27%. Intimal proliferation was present in 97% of the restenosis lesions but was also evident in 33% of primary lesions. Tissue weight from 27 lesions averaged 18.5 mg (range, 5.8-45.1 mg), which is not adequate to explain the entire angiographic improvement. Thus, part of the improvement in lumen diameter appears to be due to mechanical dilatation rather than to tissue removal alone. Atherectomy can predictably treat selected coronary lesions with overall safety comparable to that of conventional balloon angioplasty, although the procedure as currently performed does not derive all of its benefit from tissue removal and does not appear to prevent restenosis.\r"

Because dipyridamole acts by blocking the cellular uptake of adenosine, we investigated the usefulness of direct intravenous administration of adenosine, a physiological substance with an exceedingly short (less than 2 seconds) plasma half-life, to induce maximal controlled coronary vasodilation in conjunction with 201Tl scintigraphy. We studied 89 patients (44 men and 45 women; mean age, 64 +/- 10 years [SD]) who were unable to perform an exercise test and were referred for evaluation of suspected coronary artery disease. The intravenous infusion of adenosine began at an initial rate of 50 micrograms/kg/min and was increased by stepwise increments every minute to a maximal rate of 140 micrograms/kg/min. 201Tl was injected intravenously after 1 minute at the highest infusion rate, followed by immediate and delayed (4 hour) tomographic imaging. At the highest infusion rate, adenosine induced a significant (p less than 0.001) decrease in systolic (8.7 +/- 19.3 mm Hg) and diastolic (6.7 +/- 9.4 mm Hg) blood pressures as well as a significant (p = 0.0001) increase in heart rate (14.5 +/- 11.0 beats/min). Side effects occurred in 83% of the patients but resolved spontaneously within 1 or 2 minutes after discontinuing the adenosine infusion. Chest, throat, or jaw pain were the most frequent symptoms and occurred in 57% of the patients. Headache (35%) and flush (29%) were also common. Ischemic electrocardiographic changes occurred in 12% of the patients, and transient first-degree atrioventricular block occurred in 10%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the present study, the pattern of left ventricular filling was assessed by Doppler echocardiography in 32 patients with thalassemia major (age, 17 +/- 5 years) who had not experienced symptoms of heart failure and had normal left ventricular systolic function. Data were compared with those obtained in 32 age-matched and sex-matched normal subjects. An abnormal Doppler pattern of left ventricular filling with increased flow velocity at mitral valve opening followed by an abrupt and premature decrease of flow velocity in early diastole was identified in the patients with thalassemia. Peak flow velocity in early diastole was increased in patients compared with controls (90 +/- 10 vs. 81 +/- 15 cm/sec; p less than 0.01), and rate of deceleration of flow velocity after the early diastolic peak and the ratio between the early and late (atrial) peaks of flow velocity were also increased (1,050 +/- 325 vs. 762 +/- 193 cm/sec2 and 2.7 +/- 0.7 vs. 2.2 +/- 0.5, respectively; p less than 0.001), whereas flow velocity deceleration time was reduced (97 +/- 22 vs. 119 +/- 19 msec; p less than 0.001). This Doppler pattern of diastolic filling is usually described as \"restrictive\" and reflects a decrease in left ventricular chamber compliance. A restrictive pattern of left ventricular filling was also identified in the subgroup of 16 study patients who had undergone optimal iron chelation therapy with deferoxamine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The development of color Doppler flow imaging has now permitted the visualization of intraventricular blood flow patterns. Therefore, we performed Doppler flow mapping in 41 patients (12 with normal left ventricular contraction, eight with hypokinesis or akinesis, and 21 with dyskinesis) and compared these findings with left ventriculography. Systolic blood flow by Doppler mapping in subjects with normal ventricular contraction was characterized primarily by flow through the left ventricular outflow tract and into the aorta. In patients with dyskinesis, paradoxical systolic flow toward the abnormal segment was present, and persisted for at least 50% of systole in 18 of 21 patients. Mean duration of paradoxical flow in dyskinetic patients was 77% of systole. Paradoxical flow was also observed in two of five patients with akinesis but in no patients with hypokinesis. A good correlation was observed between the duration of paradoxical systolic flow and indexes of regional wall motion (radian shortening of the involved myocardium) (r = 0.77) and global ejection fraction derived from cineangiography (r = 0.79). Correlations between the area of the paradoxical systolic flow stream in midsystole and indexes of left ventricular function were less close, with r equaling 0.57 for both regional wall motion and ejection fraction. Thus, paradoxical systolic flow can be detected in most patients with left ventricular dyskinesis, and correlates with the magnitude of regional and global left ventricular dysfunction by cineangiography.\r"

There were 13 (1.8%) stem fractures and one (0.1%) neck fracture. Average time to fracture was 95 months. All fractures occurred in stems implanted before 1976, using early femoral acrylic stem fixation techniques. Stem fracture was related to time of surgery, stem size, patient height, patient weight (for males), and patient age. Survivorship analysis predicted an overall ten-year fracture rate of 4%, and a ten-year rate of 5% for T-28 stems implanted before 1976. There have been no reported fractures in the 204 T-28 stainless steel prostheses implanted since 1976. The mean patient follow-up period for the T-28 stems implanted after 1975 was 52 months, and only 16 patients have been followed for nine years or more. Thus, a longer patient follow-up period is needed in the post-1975 group in order to determine the long-term fracture rate in this group. However, the major difference between this group and the early group is the use of an improved cementation technique, as well as the use of larger prostheses when possible. There was no material or manufacturing change until the introduction of the TR-28 prostheses in 1978.\r"

A retrospective analysis of 77 cases of both unstable and stable cases of intertrochanteric fractures showed a higher incidence of complications in the Ender's group; these included backing out, distal femur fracture, need for a secondary procedure, external rotation deformity, and knee pain. Indications for the use of Ender's rods may be found among patients with burns, soft-tissue injuries of the proximal thigh, and patients refusing blood transfusions. Wiring of the distal ends of Ender's rods prevents backing out of the rods. Dacron tape has also been successfully used to prevent the distal ends of the rods from backing out in the last six of the 77 cases. The compression hip screw is a preferred treatment of choice in both stable and unstable intertrochanteric fractures.\r"

The patients were timed running a 50-m dash and measured in a standing broad-jump performance. Patients with congenital Chopart amputations functioned within normal limits in all of the authors' tests. No patient had a plantar flexion deformity. A slipper-style shoe filler or ankle foot orthosis with a foot plate and shoe filler was used as an easily fabricated and very functional prosthesis. The Chopart foot was found to have many advantages compared to a Symes-level amputation, including maintenance of functional length of the extremity, preservation of a broad weight-bearing surface, and an intact plantar fat pad.\r"

  ".W": "The three-dimensional kinematics of the Tricon-M knee prosthesis during active knee flexion and extension were recorded in 11 patients with arthrosis or rheumatoid arthritis using roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis. Twenty-three normal knees constituted the control group. The prosthetic knees displayed the same degrees of freedom regarding rotational and translational movements as the normal knees, although the kinematics were different. A combination of internal rotation, abduction, and lateral translation of the tibia was recorded during flexion, and the reversed movements were recorded during extension. During the first 25 degrees of flexion, these movements were small, reflecting the high congruency between the articular surfaces, while beyond 25 degrees they increased. The normal knees displayed a combination of internal rotation, adduction, and medial translation of the tibia during flexion and the reversed movements during extension. The prosthetic knees also exhibited an increased posterior displacement during increasing flexion when compared with the normal knees. There was a correlation between the positioning of the femoral component in the sagittal plane and the recorded anterior/posterior translations. In conclusion, the kinematics of the Tricon-M knee prosthesis significantly differ from the normal knee, probably because of the design of the prosthesis and the absence of the cruciate ligaments.\r"

The control group consisted of 73 patients who were treated with 95 TKAs without postoperative CPM. The average age was 65.4 years. The study group consisted of 38 patients who had 51 TKAs in which CPM was used postoperatively. The mean patient age was 62.8 years. The most common diagnoses in both groups were osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Range of motion (ROM) was recorded preoperatively, at discharge, at three months, one year, two years, and at the last follow-up visit. There were no statistically significant differences in the ROM between the two groups at any of these time periods. At two years, the mean flexion and extension in the study group were 99 degrees and -4 degrees, respectively, compared to 103 degrees and -5 degrees in the control group. The average hospital stay was 11.2 days in the study group, whereas it was 15.1 days in control group. In the control group, there was one superficial infection, no deep infections, and four pulmonary emboli compared with three superficial infections, two deep infections, and no pulmonary emboli in the study group. There was no difference in the transfusion requirements between the two groups. CPM is advocated by the authors to help achieve discharge ROM earlier, but the protocol has been changed to begin CPM on the second postoperative day to allow the wound to stabilize.\r"

Twenty of the 71 patients were tested by two examiners independently. Another 30 patients without previous knee injury were chosen as a reference group and tested. Patients with anterior cruciate-deficient knees had significantly increased anterior and total laxity. If the testing procedure was altered, the laxity changed. Thus, an increase of knee flexion from 15 degrees to 25 degrees resulted in an increased anterior laxity. Changes in the amount and placement of the tibial load also affected laxity. Inter-examiner reproducibility was high if a standardized testing procedure was followed. Sensitivity was 92% if the difference in total laxity between involved and uninvolved knees was determined with a high tibial load (180 N), whereas specificity was 70%. Therefore, the laxity tester has disadvantages as a diagnostic tool, but it is still valuable for evaluation of anterior cruciate ligament ruptures and their treatment.\r"

Such a solution may be adopted mainly after the resection of tumors that have attacked part of the tibial plate or that have necessitated the removal of the tibial plate to ensure a radical procedure. The cartilaginous surface of either one or both of the patellar articular facets is well suited for restoring the continuity of the tibial articular surface lost through resection. Furthermore, all of the remaining part of the patella provides an excellent graft for replacing the underlying bone loss. This is sometimes sufficient in itself; at times, other bone grafts are required. In both cases, patellectomy is the preliminary procedure and is performed on the same side where tibial resection will be done immediately afterward. Using this procedure, eight cases of giant-cell tumor on the proximal extremity of the tibia and one case on the distal epiphysis have been treated. Consolidation, facilitated by a firm metal osteosynthesis, was rapid. The long-term results were excellent; there were no local recurrences of the tumor, and knee joint function was preserved with values only slightly below normal, even though roentgenograms showed signs of arthrosis.\r"

Transverse midtibial osteotomies were performed bilaterally and stabilized with a relatively rigid external fixation system in a neutralization mode (800 microns) to prevent compression of the osteotomy ends during weight bearing. On the 15th day, one osteotomy in each animal was subjected to dynamic compression through weight bearing by release of the fixator-telescoping mechanism (axial dynamization), while the other side remained unchanged as the control. Analysis of sequential roentgenograms showed that the callus distribution was more symmetric on the dynamic compression side. The two sides showed no significant differences in quantitative technetium-99 bone scans or in osteotomy-site blood flow. There were no statistical differences in new bone formation, bone porosity, or maximum torque between sides. The fixation had maintained the initially created osteotomy gap on the control side and tended to unite through a gap-healing mechanism. The dynamic compression side showed reduction in gap size and union by more of a contact-healing mechanism. There were no statistical differences in the rate of pin loosening, but its distribution according to pin location was significantly different between the two sides.\r"

There were no known complications related to autotransfusion in any of the cases. With proper technique, red cell salvage is approximately 58% effective, and intraoperative blood loss can be reduced by that amount. The first four years' experience with the preoperative autogeneic blood program is as follows. Using a combined program of predonation and primary hip arthroplasty, 72% of the revision hip arthroplasties and 81% of the spinal instrumentations required only autologous blood. A combined program of autologous donation and intraoperative autotransfusion is an excellent alternative to allogeneic blood replacement and a means of eliminating transfusion-related disease.\r"

In ten patients, a modified surgical technique included moderate trimming of the femoral condylar prominences and patellofemoral arthrodesis in the intercondylar notch. This produces a conical stump with a large area for end bearing, and at the same time allows the standard suction-socket fitting without ischial weight bearing. The average age was 33.1 years (range, ten to 75 years). The indication for amputation was trauma in four cases, tumor in three cases, chronic osteomyelitis in one, ischemia of the leg in one, and congenital malformation in one. Average length of follow-up study was four years (range, one to 9.8 years). Complications were stump ulceration in one case and fistula formation in two cases. Nine patients achieved full weight-bearing ambulation with an end-bearing type of prosthesis. The remaining patient was not fitted with a prosthesis prior to his death from a systemic medical illness. Union of the patellofemoral arthrodesis was achieved in all ten cases. This procedure is recommended whenever knee disarticulation is indicated and ambulation expected. Significant improvement over standard knee disarticulation or distal above-knee amputation can be achieved.\r"

A case is described of a traumatic, high, below-knee amputation in a five-year-old child. The resulting stump was too short to allow a conventional below-knee prosthesis, decreasing gait efficiency. The Ilizarov technique was used to increase tibial length. Bony lengthening was very successful, but several problems were encountered with the soft-tissue reconstruction. This technique of stump reconstruction holds promise only if the soft-tissue problems are anticipated. The suggestions for future stump-lengthening procedures are preparatory plastic surgery for skin requirements including infection prevention measures.\r"

Back pain was the most common complaint in 25 patients (86%), and neurologic symptoms or deficits were present in 16 patients (55%). All lesions were visible on routine spine roentgenograms, while computed tomography and myelography demonstrated spinal canal encroachment and extradural spinal cord compression in 19 patients (66%). The histologic diagnoses included 11 benign and 18 malignant lesions. Benign lesions occurred predominantly in children and malignant tumors in adults. Treatment was individualized, based on the histologic diagnoses. Twenty-two patients had surgical resection of their lesions. Laminectomy without stabilization and arthrodesis resulted in late instability and neurologic deterioration in three of seven patients (43%) with malignant lesions. Resection and decompression combined with arthrodesis did not predispose to late instability. Twenty-one patients were followed for a mean of 4.1 years (range, two to 14 years). Eight patients died from malignant disease between one month and seven years after diagnosis.\r"

Early resuscitation had consisted of fluid administration and vasopressors when required. When added to this standard regimen, dobutamine had no significant effect on mean arterial pressure (MAP) (from 71 +/- 12 to 73 +/- 13 mm Hg), but markedly increased cardiac index (from 3.0 +/- 0.7 to 3.9 +/- 1.0 L/min.m2, p less than .001), stroke index (from 32 +/- 8 to 37 +/- 9 ml/m2, p less than .001) and oxygen transport (from 410 +/- 105 to 530 +/- 146 ml/min.m2, p less than .001).

For the 13 patients with pneumonia, there was a significantly greater decrease in pH below the value recorded on the day of intubation vs. that for the ten patients who did not have pneumonia. In the 11 patients who developed initial colonization and then pneumonia, the pH did not change after colonization, but became acidic with the development of pneumonia. The pH returned to basal levels after recovery from pneumonia. We tested the pH value to differentiate between colonization and infection in these intubated critically ill patients. A decrease in pH greater than or equal to 0.2 below the pH value on the day of intubation could predict the presence of pneumonia with a positive predictive value of 90%. This decrease in pH occurred before or on the same day as the development of radiologically detectable pneumonia in most cases. Daily monitoring of the pH of tracheal mucus may be of value in critically ill intubated patients.\r"

Diastolic filling was determined using pulsed Doppler transmitral spectral tracings in 13 patients with SS, ten patients with SWS, and 33 normal controls. Diastolic filling variables and heart rate were similar in patients with SS and SWS. The SS and SWS patients had an abnormal pattern of diastolic filling compared with controls and were characterized by an increase in peak atrial velocity (70 +/- 20 cm/sec SS, 84 +/- 18 cm/sec SWS vs. 56 +/- 11 cm/sec controls, p less than .05), decreased peak rapid filling velocity/peak atrial filling velocity (1.1 +/- 0.3, SS, 1.1 +/- 0.2 SWS vs. 1.5 +/- 0.4 controls, p less than .05), increased atrial filling fraction (39 +/- 11 SS, 42 +/- 6 SWS vs. 30 +/- 10 controls, p less than .05) and prolongation of atrial filling period as a function of the diastolic filling period (0.48 +/- 0.10 SS, 0.43 +/- 0.10 SWS vs. 0.30 +/- 0.07 controls, p less than .05). Heart rate was higher in SS and SWS compared with controls (116 +/- 15 beat/min SS, 110 +/- 26 beat/min SWS vs. 73 +/- 12 beat/min controls, p less than .05). In patients with SS and SWS, there is increased reliance on atrial systolic contribution to diastolic filling. We conclude that diastolic dysfunction occurs with systemic infections.\r"

Measurements were performed in 17 hemodynamically unstable premature infants who had an elevated PEP/LVET ratio before and 30 min after starting dobutamine infusion (10 micrograms/kg.min). Dobutamine infusion resulted in a significant decrease in PEPI (from 108 +/- 16 [SEM] to 95 +/- 17 msec; p less than .01) and in PEP/LVET ratio (from 0.55 +/- 0.16 [SEM] to 0.45 +/- 0.17; p less than .01), and in a significant increase in LVETI (from 255 +/- 15.7 [SEM] to 264 +/- 16.2 msec; p less than .01).

Forty-eight consecutive patients admitted to our SICU were prospectively monitored for acute changes in weight and its impact on clinical management and outcome. When defined as a gain greater than 10% from their preoperative or premorbid weight (or an approximately 20% increase in total body water), 40% of patients had fluid overload. Patients were divided into three groups: those who had gained less than or equal to 10%, those with a weight gain between 11% and 20%, and those with greater than 20% increase in weight. Significant differences were found with respect to vasopressor dependence, colloid administration, and mortality. When indexed by initial Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) mortality prediction scores, all groups had similar degrees of illness. On average, presumably due to volume limitations, patients were inadequately nourished during 85% of their SICU stay. Our results suggest that the morbidity of fluid overload can be significant, and warrants a fresh look at the methods of intraoperative fluid resuscitation.\r"

However, under conditions of ventilation/perfusion mismatch, the use of inotropic or vasodilator drugs to augment cardiac output could, in turn, worsen venous admixture. In a canine model of asymmetric oleic acid-induced pulmonary edema, we examined this possibility by studying the effect of 20 and 40-micrograms/kg doses of parenteral nifedipine on oxygenation variables, venous admixture, and intrapulmonary blood flow distribution. After oleic acid injury, nifedipine caused significant increases in cardiac index by 70% as systemic vascular resistance decreased proportionately by 61%. Stroke volume index (SI) and mean pulmonary arterial pressure increased, while venous admixture and the distribution of intrapulmonary blood flow did not change with nifedipine. However, nifedipine significantly improved the tissue DO2 index so that the coefficient of DO2 increased. Thus, nifedipine significantly increased SI in a dose-dependent manner, thereby improving the tissue oxygen supply-demand balance.\r"

This study compares the electrophysiologic response to hemorrhage and resuscitation with 7.5% NaCl + 6% dextran (HSD), 6% hetastarch (HE), or 0.9% NaCl (NS) using somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP). Resuscitation with HE resulted in a better return of electrocortical function than with either HSD or NS (SSEP grade 2.0 +/- 0.2 for HE vs. 3.2 +/- 0.3 for HSD and 2.9 +/- 0.3 for NS; p less than .01). SSEP response correlated closet with mean arterial pressure (MAP) (r = -.53). There was no correlation between the SSEP response and cardiac index (r = .06) or ICP (r = -.04). HSD blunted the usual early increase in ICP after fluid infusion, and resulted in a lower ICP throughout resuscitation. However, the restoration of MAP and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) after HSD infusion was poor. The vasodilatory properties of hypertonic saline have been well described, both in the systemic and in the pulmonary vascular bed. While these characteristic usually are cited as advantages of this solution, in the case of ischemic cerebral dysfunction, this diminished vascular tone prevents early restoration of the MAP and CPP. The result is suboptimal electrocortical recovery after hemorrhage.\r"

The needle progress was monitored continuously in real time on the display throughout the procedure. Immediate relief from acute cardiac tamponade was obtained in all except one patient, who was treated by pericardiotomy because of insufficient drainage. In two patients, second drainage was performed because of reaccumulation of the pericardial effusion. There were no major complications. Nine patients recovered and the other patients died of underlying disease. Accurate and efficient visualization of the needle might allow a safer procedure. We conclude that pericardiocentesis guided by 2-D echocardiography using a needle guide may be a safe and easily applied technique for the management of pericardial effusion.\r"

It features the simultaneous use of two indicator gases (so that the influence of diffusion processes in the gas exchange to the patient can be measured) and maintains a nearly constant FIO2 during a washout procedure. With this indicator gas injector, the transition time of the indicator gas fraction at the beginning of a washout proved to be short enough to detect ventilation inhomogeneity by visual inspection of the washout curves. Functional residual capacity measurements using this device are presented on a test lung with known volume, on healthy volunteers, and on critically ill patients.\r"

The ETT malposition rates observed on the postintubation chest radiographs were 39.1% after positioning guided by clinical assessment alone, and 19.6% after positioning guided by clinical assessment plus the ETT-PDS (p less than 0.5). This reduction in malnutrition rate could not be demonstrated when the ETT-PDS was used to guide routine ETT positioning performed before morning chest radiographs.\r"

In a series of experiments, tissue samples from small intestinal segments either exposed to bile acids or not also were examined by scanning and transmission electron microscopy to study the integrity of the tight junctions. Results show that chenodeoxycholate, starting at the concentration of 0.1 mM, enhanced in a dose-related manner the transepithelial flux of lactulose in the ileum. Both chenodeoxycholate (0.5 mM) and ursodeoxycholate (0.5 mM) significantly increased mucosal permeability to lactulose in jejunum and ileum; the effect of chenodeoxycholate was also shown to be reversible, as it completely disappeared within 40 min after its withdrawal and it did not result in permanent changes of epithelial transport function. Finally, the tight junctions appeared loosened by the addition of 1 mM chenodeoxycholate, suggesting that this is the major site of the transient bile acid increase of small intestinal permeability to compounds such as lactulose, having a molecular radius wider than 0.5 nm.\r"

To study this, rats had small intestinal mucosal injury induced in vivo by perfusion with 5 mM chenodeoxycholic acid. Control rats were compared to rats receiving either intraperitoneal or intravenous pretreatment with 50 mg/kg cimetidine or intraluminal pretreatment with 0.5 mM cimetidine. Mucosal injury was assessed by measuring villus tip epithelial cell denudation by computerized quantitative morphology. Intraperitoneal cimetidine reduced the average denudation/villus (micrometers) caused by 45-min perfusion with chenodeoxycholic acid: control = 39.1 +/- 7.7 (SEM), intraperitoneal cimetidine = 20.8 +/- 3.5 (P less than 0.05). Additionally, both intraluminal and intravenous cimetidine reduced villus denudation caused from 30 min perfusion with chenodeoxycholic acid: control = 62.5 +/- 5.8, intravenous cimetidine = 42.6 +/- 4.7 (P less than 0.05), intraluminal cimetidine = 44.6 +/- 7.2 (P less than 0.05). The observation that reduced mucosal injury is observed in an in vivo model that is independent of gastric acid supports the conclusion that cimetidine indeed has acid-independent protective properties.\r"

Tissues were mounted in a flux chamber to measure unidirectional fluxes of 22Na, 36Cl, short-circuit current, Isc (mueq/cm2/hr), electrical potential difference, PD (mV), and total ionic conductance, G (mS/cm2). Six pairs of tissues that were normal or less inflamed responded to theophylline by increasing PD and Isc and by reducing JCl(ms), the mucosal to serosal flux of Cl. In six pairs that did not respond to theophylline or to EFS, inflammation was more intense, and in the basal state, G was lower, PD was higher, and unidirectional fluxes of Na and Cl were halved. We conclude: (1) normal jejunum secretes Cl and responds to theophylline or EFS by reducing JCl(ms) thereby increasing Cl secretion; (2) unlike human ileum, neither theophylline nor EFS affect JCl(sm); (3) inflammation eliminates the response to theophylline and to EFS.\r"

In patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, the transfusion requirements were lower only in the second and third year following therapy than in the year before therapy; however, these differences were not significant. In patients with angiodysplasias, a median number of one laser session (range 1-8) was necessary to destroy angiodysplasias. A blood loss recurred in 15 patients. The cumulative probability of remaining free of blood loss recurrence at 24 months and at 54 months was 61 +/- 9%. Three parameters had an independent prognostic value, the initial number of angiodysplasias (P less than 0.02), the presence of coagulation disorders (P less than 0.05), and age (P less than 0.05).\r"

One of the rarest of these complications is proctitis cystica profunda (PCP). To study the histologic changes of chronic radiation proctitis, we evaluated 35 female Wistar rats that had received a single exposure of 22.5 Gy of radiation to the rectum and were then followed for one year. We identified PCP and its precursor lesions in 18 rats. The fully developed lesion consisted of a focal expansion of the submucosa by dilated cystic spaces lined by a single layer of benign epithelial cells. Usually, PCP evolved as glands herniated between small defects in the muscularis mucosae. Mitotic figures were not recognized in the cells lining the herniating glands. In two rats, the radiation had apparently caused large ulcers, which had subsequently reepithelialized, resulting in prominent submucosal glandular tissue. Although the number of goblet cells in the displaced epithelium was reduced, the cells had rather mature appearances ultrastructurally. Glands displaced into the submucosa were encased by an intact basal lamina but lacked in muscularis.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effect of fasting on the course of experimental acute pancreatitis induced in rats by four subcutaneous injections of 20 micrograms/kg body weight of cerulein at hourly intervals. Rats were either fasted from 24 hr before to 9 hr after the first cerulein injection or fed ad libitum throughout the experiment. Twenty-four hours of fasting reduced cerulein-induced increases in serum levels of amylase and anionic trypsin(ogen) to 50 and 70% of those in fed rats, respectively. Increases in pancreatic wet weight after cerulein injections were also less in fasted rats than in fed rats. Pancreatic content of trypsin was significantly decreased after a 24-hr fast, and no further changes were induced by cerulein injections. The histological signs of acute pancreatitis were greatly alleviated by fasting. However, 24 hr of fasting did not alter the sensitivity and responsiveness of the exocrine pancreas to cerulein in both in vivo and in vitro. Plasma CCK bioactivity and immunoreactive secretin concentration in 24-hr-fasted rats were significantly lower than those in fed rats. Administration of CCK receptor antagonist, loxiglumide, 12 hr prior to the induction of acute pancreatitis reduced the increase in serum amylase activity in fed rats to nearly the same levels as that in fasted rats and alleviated histological signs of pancreatitis to some extent. These present observations suggest that fasting lessens the severity of cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis by reducing endogenous CCK release.\r"

To determine whether bronchodilators, the supine position, or eating affect gastroesophageal reflux, we performed ambulatory 24-hr pH monitoring on 44 controls and 104 unselected adult asthmatics. All asthmatics had discrete attacks of wheezing and documented reversible airway obstruction of at least 20%. The presence or absence of gastroesophageal reflux symptoms was not used as a criterion for patient selection. Chronic bronchodilator therapy was required by 71.2% of the asthmatics, and was continued during the test. Asthmatics had significantly worse GER than controls during the 3-hr postprandial period, which continued into the nonpostprandial period up to the next meal. Significant differences were present for esophageal mucosal acid contact time, frequency of reflux episodes, and clearance times. During the nonpostprandial periods asthmatics had four times the acid reflux as controls and 19-fold the frequency of prolonged reflux episodes. There were no differences between asthmatics on bronchodilators and those not on bronchodilators in any of the reflux parameters during the upright (postprandial, nonpostprandial) period or supine (sleep) period (P = NS). We conclude that: (1) regardless of the use of bronchodilator therapy, asthmatics have significant GER when asleep and after meals that continues beyond the postprandial period to the next meal; and (2) asthmatics receiving bronchodilators have similar gastroesophageal reflux patterns after eating, in the nonpostprandial period, and when asleep as asthmatics not receiving bronchodilators.\r"

We compared distal esophageal peristaltic and lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressures in 15 normal subjects during six liquid swallows in the upright and supine positions, and six solid (small marshmallow) swallows in upright position. LES pressures were significantly (P less than 0.05) higher supine than upright but no differences were noted in LES pressure, relaxation, and duration of relaxation between upright solid and liquid swallows. Distal peristaltic wave velocities were faster upright than supine. Peristaltic wave amplitudes, durations, and DP/DT were significantly (P less than 0.05) greater in supine than in upright position. Atypical wave forms, defined as nontransmitted, simultaneous, and simultaneous/repetitive, increased in the upright position compared to supine (P less than 0.01), and during solid vs liquid swallows (P less than 0.05). These results indicate that body position substantially affects normal distal esophageal peristalsis and LES pressure and that \"abnormal\" wave forms occur more frequently during swallowing solids than liquids in the upright position. Conclusions regarding \"abnormal\" motility over prolonged periods and during food ingestion in patients should be tempered by these findings.\r"

L-364,718 and CR1409 inhibited CCK-8-stimulated pepsinogen secretion over the same concentration range as they inhibited CCK-8-stimulated increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), respectively. Schild analysis of the CCK dose-response curve indicates that L-364,718 and CR1409 exert their inhibitory effects on CCK-8-stimulated chief cell responses in a competitive manner. By contrast, dbcGMP inhibited not only CCK-8- but also carbachol-stimulated pepsinogen secretion. Furthermore, dbcGMP inhibited CCK-8-stimulated pepsinogen secretion more potently than the increases in [Ca2+]i. These results suggest that L-364,718 and CR1409 act as CCK-receptor antagonists, but dbcGMP has another inhibitory effect on pepsinogen secretion in addition to the effect as a CCK-receptor antagonist in guinea pig gastric chief cells.\r"

The prevalence of H. pylori infection also is known to increase with advancing age; however, the individual patient's age has not routinely been considered when interpreting urea breath test results. The aim of this study was to validate a short, age-adjusted [14C]urea breath test for use in diagnosing H. pylori infections. Forty-one subjects (28 volunteers, 13 patients) underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsies. Subjects were defined as being H. pylori-positive if histology or culture was positive. In addition, all subjects completed a 120-min [14C]urea breath test. A logistic regression analysis adjusting for age was used to estimate the probability of H. pylori positivity as a function of the 14C values generated. Sixteen subjects were H. pylori-positive, and 25 were H. pylori-negative. The 14C values generated between 15 and 80 min were found to be equally predictive in identifying H. pylori-positive subjects. Advancing age was associated with a higher probability of H. pylori-positivity. By taking advantage of the statistical probabilities, older patients could be accurately diagnosed with H. pylori at lower 14C values. We found that [14C]urea breath test to be both a sensitive and specific test that can be abbreviated to a 30-min examination (total test time). Moreover, our mathematical model indicates that a patient's age should be considered in order to optimize interpretation of the [14C]urea breath test, although further observations are needed to confirm this model.\r"

  ".U": "90305714\r", 
  ".W": "Paired controlled studies were performed in 10 normal volunteers and 32 patients with irritable bowel syndrome to investigate the effect of the calcium channel blocker nicardipine, on the responses of the anorectum to rectal distension and a meal. Nicardipine was administered orally in standard (20 mg) and sustained-release (30 mg twice a day) formulations. In normal volunteers standard nicardipine had no significant effect on the rectal responses to distension but did significantly reduce the postprandial motility index (P less than 0.05). In the patients with irritable bowel syndrome, standard nicardipine caused a significant reduction in distension-induced rectal motor activity (P less than 0.05) and increased the rectal sensory thresholds for desire to defecate and discomfort (P less than 0.02). Slow-release nicardipine caused a significant reduction in distension-induced activity (P less than 0.05) but did not alter rectal sensory thresholds. Both formulations of nicardipine significantly reduced the postprandial motility index (P less than 0.05) and symptoms (P less than 0.05). In conclusion, this study confirms that calcium channel blockers may be useful in the management of irritable bowel syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Tissue cholestasis is a histologic feature in some patients with alcoholic liver disease, but its significance is unknown. We studied prospectively the clinical, laboratory, and histologic findings of 306 chronic male alcoholics in whom liver tissue was available. Tissue cholestasis permitted identification of two groups: group I, absent or mild cholestasis (239 patients), and group II, moderate to severe cholestasis (67 patients). Statistical evaluation was performed by Student's t test and regression analyses. In patients with tissue cholestasis, 97% had elevated serum cholylglycine levels, while only 61% had significant jaundice (serum bilirubin greater than 5 mg/dl). In patients without tissue cholestasis, 66% had elevated serum cholylglycine and 13.5% jaundice. Highly significant statistical correlations (P less than 0.0001) were found between cholestasis and malnutrition, prothrombin time, AST, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, Maddrey's discriminant function, serum cholylglycine level, albumin, and histologic severity score. In group I, 54% survived 60 months versus 22% in group II (P less than 0.0001). Highly significant statistical correlations (P less than 0.0001) were noted between serum cholylglycine levels and the parameters enumerated earlier, but not with survival. We conclude that tissue cholestasis is a highly significant prognostic indicator of outcome in alcoholic hepatitis and is more consistently associated with bile salt retention than jaundice.\r"

Relapses of colitis occurred despite treatment with vancomycin, metronidazole, bacitracin, and cholestyramine. Each recurrence appeared to begin successively closer to the end of the previous course of treatment. Four episodes were sufficiently severe to require hospitalization for rehydration. Saccharomyces boulardii, a nonpathogenic yeast, was begun prior to discontinuing vancomycin therapy for the last recurrence and was continued for three months. Serial stool cultures and assays for C. difficile showed persistence of the organism but rapid reduction of high titers of cytotoxin. No further recurrences of diarrhea or colitis were encountered while the patient was taking Saccharomyces boulardii and for 18 months of follow-up after the yeast was discontinued.\r"

An association between acute pancreatitis and Wegener's granulomatosis has not been reported previously. Six episodes of abdominal pain and hyperamylasemia occurred and were complicated by development of a pancreatic pseudocyst. New cavitary lung lesions typical of Wegener's granulomatosis led to treatment with increased glucocorticoid dosage, resulting in rapid resolution of the pancreatitis and pulmonary lesions. Acute pancreatitis may be a clinical manifestation of the histologic pancreatic vasculitis observed in Wegener's granulomatosis. Reactivation of Wegener's granulomatosis should be considered when a patient with the disorder develops otherwise unexplained acute pancreatitis.\r"

  ".W": "The surface thermodynamic effects of bile acids in the stomach were assessed in 48 subjects who had undergone gastric surgery for peptic ulcer disease and in 52 controls with medically healed ulcers. We derived values for surface tension of gastric mucosa from contact angle using a goniometer and measured the surface tension of gastric juice by the drop-weight method. Subjects with gastric surgery had higher median fasting bile acid concentrations than controls (1.2 vs. 0.1 mmol/L; P less than 0.0001), higher mean mucosal surface tension (51.9 vs. 47.9 mN/m; P less than 0.0001), and lower mean surface tension of gastric juice (43.2 vs. 51.7 mN/m; P less than 0.0001). Subjects who had had a Billroth II gastrectomy (n = 19) had higher bile acid concentrations (5.8 vs. 0.6 mmol/L; P less than 0.01), higher mucosal surface tension (53.7 vs. 50.3 mN/m; P less than 0.05), and lower gastric juice surface tension (41.3 vs. 47.1 mN/m; P less than 0.05) than those who had a vagotomy and drainage procedure (n = 17). Overall, intragastric bile acid concentration correlated directly with surface tension of gastric mucosa (r = 0.51, P less than 0.0001) and inversely with that of gastric juice (r = -0.60, P less than 0.0001). In conclusion, the interfacial energy barrier at the surface of the gastric mucosa is overcome in the presence of intragastric bile acids.\r"

  ".W": "It has been shown that intragastric treatment of rats with a suspension of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and tripalmitin at a 1:4 ratio (5 mg lipid/mL per rat) provided rats with highly efficaceous and consistent protection against a variety of ulcerogenic agents and conditions. The gastric protective activity of this mixture was of long duration (t 1/2 approximately 9 hours. In an attempt to understand the mechanism of protection, it was determined that the ulcerogen-induced reduction in gastric surface hydrophobicity was reversed in rats pretreated with the mixture. However, the lipid mixture did not affect the gastric emptying rate and maintained its cytoprotective activity in indomethacin-treated rats. These results indicate that the mixture's protective effect was not mediated by alterations in either gastrointestinal motility or the gastric accumulation of lipids or \"cytoprotective\" metabolites (prostaglandins). The mixture also appreciably reduced gastric lesion score in response to acid if one or both the lipids was substituted for a metabolically inert ether analogue, suggesting that lipid metabolism makes a negligible contribution to the protective response. Electron microscopic observation indicated that the predominent structure in the mixture is a microemulsion in which a dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine monolayer encapsulates a tripalmitin core. Last, the improved gastric protective activity of the mixture in comparison to dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine liposomes is discussed regarding marked differences in the physical structure of the two suspensions and the rate at which lipids in these states adsorb to a surface to enhance its hydrophobic properties.\r"
