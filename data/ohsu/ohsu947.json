That response, however, can be based on an account of the dependent moral status of the fetus. For such an account the central question is, \"When is the fetus a patient?\" Viable fetuses are patients. Nonviable third-trimester fetuses are not patients. Previable fetuses are patients solely as a function of the woman's autonomous decision to confer such status. The abortion of a viable fetus is, with few exceptions, never ethically justified, because it is a patient. The abortion of nonviable third-trimester fetuses (i.e., premature termination of pregnancy) is justified when the pregnant women consents to it. Abortion of the previable fetus is justifiable when the pregnant women consents to it. We distinguish between professional and private conscience. We identify the limits of the former and the legitimate role of the latter, especially in the area of religious beliefs. Finally, we address the implications of our view for residency training programs. The most important of these implications is that requiring all residents to perform abortions is ethically unjustifiable.\r"

  ".W": "Maternal immune recognition of the fetal semiallograft appears to be necessary and beneficial for fetal survival and growth. Interleukin-1 beta and human leukocyte antigen HLA-DR are important for foreign antigen recognition by the immune system, whereas transforming growth factor-beta inhibits many of the immunostimulatory properties of interleukin-1 beta. In this study we found that first-trimester decidua and term placental membranes expressed significantly higher levels of interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-1 beta messenger ribonucleic acid, and human leukocyte antigen HLA-DR alpha messenger ribonucleic acid expression. All tissues found at the maternal-fetal interface, including first-trimester decidua, placenta, and placental membranes, contained transforming growth factor-beta and expressed transforming growth factor-beta 1 messenger ribonucleic acid. On the basis of these findings, we suggest that the increase in decidual interleukin-1 beta and human leukocyte antigen HLA-DR alpha during pregnancy may be involved in maternal recognition of the fetal semiallograft and that transforming growth factor-beta production may regulate the local maternal immune response and prevent rejection of the fetus.\r"

  ".W": "To better understand which women use estrogen replacement therapy, we examined the prevalence and determinants of estrogen replacement therapy in 9704 nonblack women, age greater than or equal to 65 years, who participated in the multicenter prospective Study of Osteoporotic Fractures. Overall, 13.7% of women reported current use of oral estrogen; 10.9% took estrogen alone and 2.8% took estrogen opposed by progestin. Four percent currently used parenteral estrogen compounds. Current use declined sharply with age from 17% at age 65 to 4% at age greater than or equal to 85. The primary determinant of estrogen replacement therapy was the type of menopause; the odds of using estrogen replacement therapy in current users compared with never users were approximately five times higher in women with a surgical menopause. Estrogen use was more common among women who had higher levels of education and were less obese. Furthermore, estrogen replacement therapy users were more likely to drink alcohol and to participate in sports and recreation. A diagnosis of osteoporosis was the major determinant of continued estrogen use, but only 24% of women with a diagnosis of osteoporosis used estrogen replacement therapy. We conclude that only a small proportion of elderly women in the United States use estrogen replacement therapy. Selection factors for use of estrogen are evident and may introduce bias in studies of estrogen and disease. In consideration of the distribution of these selection factors, estrogen users will tend to be at lower risk of coronary disease and possibly breast cancer but at greater risk for hip fractures.\r"

However, the localization of prostaglandin dehydrogenase within these tissues is not known. Because the distribution of prostaglandin dehydrogenase may affect the concentration of prostaglandins that reach the myometrium, we used immunocytochemistry to localize immunoreactive prostaglandin dehydrogenase in fetal membranes and placenta. We also examined whether this distribution changed with labor. Tissues were collected at term elective cesarean section or after term spontaneous labor and delivery, were fixed, embeded, and sectioned at 5 microns. Immunoreactive prostaglandin dehydrogenase was determined with a polyclonal primary antibody to human placental prostaglandin dehydrogenase and visualized with the avidin-biotin procedure. Epithelial and epithelium-derived cells were identified by positive staining with a polyclonal antikeratin primary antibody. Cytokeratin staining was observed in amniotic epithelium, trophoblast layer of chorion, invading trophoblast in decidua, and all subsets of trophoblast in the placenta. Immunoreactive prostaglandin dehydrogenase was localized to the trophoblast layer of chorion, invading trophoblast in decidua, and in syncytiotrophoblast and intermediate trophoblast but not cytotrophoblast in the placenta. In chorion, approximately 50% to 60% of the nonvacuolated trophoblast cells stained positively for prostaglandin dehydrogenase. There was no change in the localization of immunoreactive prostaglandin dehydrogenase in any tissue in association with labor.\r"

This study is one of few to evaluate both employment- and non-employment-related physical activity. Prolonged periods of standing were associated with a modestly increased risk of preterm delivery (adjusted odds ratio for greater than or equal to 8 hours/day of standing = 1.31). Heavy work or exercise was not associated with preterm delivery (adjusted odds ratio for greater than or equal to 4 hours per day of heavy work = 1.04). The proportion of infants born preterm did not differ among women working in predominantly standing, active, and sedentary occupations. Physical activity was not associated with gestational age-adjusted birth weight after controlling for confounding variables. These data suggest that unmeasured socioeconomic differences among women reporting different levels of activity may account for previously described associations between physical activity and pregnancy outcome. Most pregnant women who report increased levels of physical activity are not at increased risk of preterm delivery or reduced intrauterine growth. However, these data do not address the role of activity restriction in the management of selected women at high risk for adverse pregnancy outcome.\r"

This study reports on the observed relationships between serial characterizations of maternal fuels during pregnancy and Brazelton neonatal behavioral assessment scale ratings of offspring from 73 well-controlled pregestational diabetic patients, 112 gestational diabetic patients, and 24 nondiabetic patients. After controlling for the effects of premature birth on the Brazelton neonatal behavioral assessment scale, significant correlations were found between second- and third-trimester glycemic regulation (hemoglobin A1c and fasting plasma glucose levels) and three of four newborn behavioral dimensions of the Brazelton neonatal behavioral assessment scale. In each case, as maternal glucose increased, the newborns' Brazelton neonatal behavioral assessment scale responses were poor. Results were not substantially different when gestational and pregestational diabetic patients were analyzed separately, nor can they be attributed to various perinatal events (neonatal asphyxia, hypoglycemia) or differences in socioeconomic status or ethnicity. The presence of fuel-related neurobehavioral deficits in neonates of diabetic mothers suggests that such infants start their interactions with care givers from a modified base.\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective study of 202 women (gestational age 24 +/- 4 weeks), we evaluated possible influences of lower genital tract infection or bacterial conditions on obstetric outcomes, including preterm labor, preterm premature rupture of membranes, and preterm birth. The presence of bacterial vaginosis (18.7%) was associated with an increased risk of preterm labor (relative risk, 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.08 to 6.46). For women with bacterial vaginosis who also had Mobiluncus species morphotypes identified on Gram stain, the relative risk of preterm labor was 3.8 (95% confidence interval, 1.32 to 11.5). Presence of vaginal Mycoplasma hominis (10.8% of patients) was associated with both preterm labor (relative risk, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.77 to 4.4) and preterm birth (relative risk, 5.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.45 to 17.9). Recovery of Staphylococcus aureus (3.0%) was associated with preterm labor (relative risk, 3.1; 95% confidence interval 1.12 to 8.7). Identification of two or more bacterial-linked abnormalities was also associated with preterm labor (relative risk, 3.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.44 to 7.58). An increased level of vaginal wash protease (greater than or equal to 10 trypsin units) (16%) was associated with preterm labor and was noted in 50% of women with preterm premature rupture of membranes. A history of prior preterm birth was the single best historical predictor of both preterm labor (relative risk, 3.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.92 to 6.83) and preterm birth (relative risk, 6.7; 95% confidence interval, 2.2 to 20.4). History of three or more abortions, antenatal urinary tract infection, and occurrence of medical complications during pregnancy also correlated with increased risk of preterm labor. These findings affirm and refine associations of various maternal reproductive tract infections with preterm labor, premature rupture of membranes, and birth, allowing for controlled treatment trials aimed at prevention of preterm birth.\r"

All women received 75 mg of estradiol with 100 mg testosterone subcutaneously. Bone density was measured at the spine and hip by dual-photon absorptiometry before therapy and after 1 year of subcutaneous hormonal therapy. The mean pretreatment bone density at the lumber vertebrae and neck of the femur was 0.84 grams of hydroxyapatite per square centimeter (SD, 0.11) and 0.73 grams of hydroxyapatite per square centimeter (SD, 0.10), respectively. The bone density at both sites increased with values of 0.91 grams of hydroxyapatite per square centimeter (SD, 0.11) and 0.75 grams of hydroxyapatite per square centimeter (SD, 0.11), respectively. These values represent an increase of 8.3% (p less than 0.0001) at the spine and 2.8% (p less than 0.01) at the neck of the femur. The plasma estradiol level increased from a median of 80.5 pmol/L to 453 pmol/L (p less than 0.001). The percentage increase of vertebral bone density was not related to age, number of years past the menopause, pretreatment bone density, or serum testosterone levels, but a significant correlation was found between the percentage increase in bone density at the spine and the serum estradiol level (p less than 0.02, r = 0.45).\r"

We studied 21 fetuses with real-time ultrasonography, 10 from 33 to 36 weeks and 11 from 37 to 41 weeks' gestation. We used the duration of eye-movement unit as a parameter and calculated the cumulative duration from the shortest to a given duration of eye movement per individual case. A scattergram of cumulative duration versus given duration obtained from all cases in each age group was analyzed with piecewise linear regression to search for a critical point(s). Critical given duration points were noted and reached statistical significance at 0.62 second and at 0.76 second during 33 to 36 and 37 to 40 weeks of gestation, respectively. These findings reveal two different types of eye movement: one with a duration of less than 0.6 to 0.8 second and the other with a duration of greater than 0.6 to 0.8 second. These findings are compatible with previous criteria on rapid and slow eye movements, respectively, at 33 weeks of gestation onward. The mean value of cumulative duration at the critical point increased from 29.0% between 33 and 36 weeks to 47.1% between 37 and 41 weeks of gestation, indicating an increase in the proportionate amount of time maintaining rapid eye movement as gestation advances.\r"

  ".W": "Regulation of human corpus luteum activity was studied with radioimmunoassays and bioassays of sera drawn serially from women suspected of having ectopic pregnancies. Progesterone values exhibited considerable overlap in pregnancies that were subsequently classified as normal intrauterine (n = 21), ectopic (n = 35), or spontaneous abortion (n = 14). The rate of change of human chorionic gonadotropin concentration was significantly correlated with progesterone levels in ectopic (r = 0.64) and all pregnancies (r = 0.70). There was no correlation (r = -0.18) between the rate of change of human chorionic gonadotropin and the bioactivity produced per volume of serum. Ectopic pregnancies and normal intrauterine pregnancies did not differ in their ratio of in vivo bioactivity to immunoactivity. From these data we conclude that corpus luteum activity is primarily regulated by the rate of change of human chorionic gonadotropin concentration, without the involvement of other serum factors. We also conclude that reduced corpus luteum function in ectopic pregnancies is not a result of biochemical modification of the human chorionic gonadotropin molecule. Finally, we discourage the use of single progesterone values in screening for ectopic pregnancies because of the considerable overlap in progesterone values among these and normal intrauterine pregnancies.\r"

We found postmortem chorionic villus sampling is technically possible, offers the highest likelihood of getting a cytogenetic result, and is a rapid, reliable, and safe technique. The extraembryonic component of intrauterine fetal deaths appears to remain viable and continues to grow long after the embryo has died. Samples obtained at the time of diagnosis of fetal death offer the greatest changes of successfully obtaining a karyotype.

This is significantly improved compared with a fetal survival rate of 20% among the five preceding pregnancies managed without serial amniocenteses at the same institution (p = 0.01). It is also markedly improved compared with a combined fetal survival rate of 16% among 48 previously reported pregnancies with the stuck twin phenomenon managed without serial amniocenteses (p less than 0.0001). Survival correlated with the absence of concomitant pregnancy complications (i.e., maternal hypertension or intractable labor) and with the absence of severe fetal structural abnormalities. Procedural complications occurred in three of eight pregnancies (37.5%) managed with serial amniocenteses and was attributed as a cause of fetal death in one case. Two of 11 survivors (18%) had complications after serial amniocenteses including brain infarction and renal tubular necrosis. Serial amniocenteses may significantly improve the survival rate of twin gestations affected by the stuck twin phenomenon but may be associated with complications among survivors.\r"

Because of the known perinatal mortality and because of early experiences with the twin-twin transfusion syndrome, we began to actively intervene in such patients with various modes of therapy. As experience was gained, it was found that repeated therapeutic amniocenteses, if performed before severe maternal abdominal distention or labor, appears to be beneficial.\r"

When the characteristics of the secretory episodes associated with the second gonadotropin-releasing hormone challenge were compared with those associated with the first, both an enhanced maximal secretory rate and mass of luteinizing hormone secreted was demonstrable at each phase of the cycle. No differences in the luteinizing hormone secretory event half-duration were detected when the responses to the first and second gonadotropin-releasing hormone doses were compared. These data confirm the gonadal hormone milieu-associated self-priming effect of gonadotropin-releasing hormone on luteinizing hormone release and indicate that it is the rate with which luteinizing hormone molecules are discharged from the pituitary gland, rather than the duration of the secretory episode itself, that provides for the self-priming effect.\r"

These differences persisted after we controlled for smoking, prenatal care, and prior preterm births. Differences in birth weight and head circumference remained after we controlled for gestational age. Rates of congenital anomalies and abruptio placental were similar between groups.

In these experiments we sought to evaluate the effect of 8-bromo-adenosine-3':5'-cyclic monophosphate on aromatase activity in first-trimester trophoblast culture. Trophoblast cells were enzyme dispersed from first-trimester placentas and purified on a Percoll gradient. On the third and fourth day after dispersion cultures were treated with androstenedione or testosterone with and without 2 mmol/L 8-bromo-adenosine-3':5'-cyclic monophosphate. The quantity of estradiol, estrone, progesterone, human placental lactogen, and human chorionic gonadotropin was determined by radioimmunoassay. We concluded that in first-trimester trophoblast, as previously reported in term trophoblast, 8-bromo-adenosine-3':5'-cyclic monophosphate inhibited the production of estradiol from the supplied androgen precursors. Human chorionic gonadotropin and human placental lactogen production was stimulated by 8-bromo-adenosine-3':5'-cyclic monophosphate.

Traditionally accepted risk factors were identified in 251 patients, with only four (1.6%) requiring transfusion. Among the 150 patients delivered by repeat cesarean section, only one (0.7%) required blood. one of 27 (3.7%) multiple gestations, two of eight (25%) patients with placenta previa, and none of the 66 grandmultiparous women had transfusions. These data suggest that autologous blood donation may not be beneficial or cost effective when the low frequency of blood transfusions in this high-risk obstetric population and the difficulty in accurately predicting those likely to require transfusions are considered.\r"

Sixty-seven fetuses with estimated gestational ages between 22 0/7 and 28 6/7 weeks were studied ultrasonographically to estimate fetal weight. A comparison of accuracy of estimated fetal weight with actual birth weight showed good correlation (r = 0.93). Neonatal outcome of these infants was analyzed by estimated gestational age and estimated fetal weight. Estimated gestational age and estimated fetal weight greater than 25 weeks and greater than 750 gm were associated with 50% survival, respectively. However, when both of these conditions were met survival reached 85%. This information may be useful to guide antepartum management decisions in this very-low-birth-weight group.\r"

  ".U": "91051736\r", 
  ".W": "Available information suggests that some instances of preterm birth or premature rupture of membranes are associated with clinically unrecognized infection and inflammation of the lower uterine segment, decidua, and fetal membranes. Various cervicovaginal microorganisms have been recovered from these sites. Many of these microorganisms produce factors that may lead to weakening of the fetal membranes, release of prostaglandins, or both. This study evaluated the presence of various lower genital tract microflora and bacterial conditions in 229 women enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of short-course erythromycin treatment at 26 to 30 weeks' gestation to prevent preterm birth. Demographic, obstetric, and microbiologic parameters were prospectively evaluated. Premature rupture of membranes occurred less frequently (p less than 0.01) among women who received erythromycin (6%) versus placebo (16%). Preterm premature rupture of membranes also occurred less frequently, although not significantly (p = 0.3) in patients who received erythromycin (2%) versus placebo (5%). Erythromycin treatment significantly decreased the occurrence of premature rupture of membranes among women who were initially positive for Chlamydia trachomatis infection. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that C. trachomatis (p = 0.05; odds ratio, 9), vaginal wash phospholipase C (p = 0.08; odds ratio, 6) and prior preterm birth (p = 0.007; odds ratio 17) were associated with increased risk of preterm birth. Bacterial vaginosis, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum were not significantly associated with increased risk of preterm birth or preterm rupture of membranes. These findings support a role for selected lower genital tract microflora in preterm birth and premature rupture. Large controlled treatment trials of specific infections or conditions associated with preterm birth and premature rupture of membranes are required to confirm the value of antimicrobial treatments in prevention of microbial-associated preterm birth.\r"

  ".W": "Between June 26, 1985, and Feb. 24, 1989, 101 seropositive pregnant women and 129 seronegative pregnant women from the same prenatal clinics in Brooklyn and the Bronx were recruited into a prospective study of human immunodeficiency virus infection in pregnant women and their offspring. This report details the course of pregnancy and short-term neonatal outcomes of 91 seropositive women and 126 seronegative women who gave birth during the study period. Seropositive mothers were significantly more likely to have sexually transmitted diseases (17.6% vs 7.1%, p = 0.017) and medical complications (43.0% vs 25%, p = 0.006) during pregnancy. No other obstetric complications (e. g., chorioamnionitis, endometritis, toxemia, or placental problems) were associated with serologic status. After controlling for confounding variables (drug use, tobacco use, age of mother, and clinic), we found that the mother's serologic status was not significantly associated with birth weight, gestational age, head circumference, or Apgar scores among live infants. For example, after adjustment on confounders we found that children born to seropositive mothers weighed about 7 gm more than children of seronegative mothers (95% confidence interval, -180 to 194 gm). We conclude that in this population human immunodeficiency virus infection has little demonstrable impact on the status at birth of live neonates.\r"

  ".W": "Transabdominal chorionic villus sampling can be readily used for detection of fetal chromosome abnormalities in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Although culture of chorionic villi offers little advantage over cultured amniotic fluid cells with respect to time required to obtain results, cytogenetic analysis of chorionic villi by direct analysis of uncultured cytotrophoblastic cells offers clear advantages because of the very short time required to obtain results. To determine whether direct analysis of uncultured cytotrophoblastic cells from second- and third-trimester placentas can routinely provide rapid and accurate assessment of fetal status, we evaluated chorionic villus specimens obtained from 57 placentas; 49 placentas were sampled in the second trimester whereas eight were sampled in the third trimester. Direct preparations yielded karyotypes in 56 (98.2%) preparations; all results of direct analyses were available within 72 hours and, when requested, within 12 hours. All results were confirmed by chromosome analysis of cultured mesenchymal core cells or cultured fetal tissue. We conclude that direct analysis of cytotrophoblastic cells from second- and third-trimester placentas is a very rapid and accurate method for determining fetal chromosome status that is comparable with, if not superior to, percutaneous umbilical blood sampling.\r"

  ".U": "91051742\r", 
  ".W": "Group B beta-hemolytic streptococcus is the most common infective cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. It is therefore surprising that no agreement exists for an approach to its prevention. There is also increasing evidence that occult infection may play an etiologic role in premature rupture of the membranes and preterm labor. In this report we review the role of group B beta-hemolytic streptococcal sepsis as a cause of perinatal wastage in the state of Victoria, Australia during the period 1982 to 1987. Group B beta-hemolytic streptococcus accounted for 1.7% of overall perinatal deaths, and for 30.3% (77 of 254) perinatal deaths directly attributable to infection. By comparison, over the same 6-year period, erythroblastosis accounted for 0.5% of perinatal wastage and there were only two deaths as a result of congenital syphilis. The true incidence of lethal group B beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection is probably greater because of the absence of histologic and bacteriologic studies in many perinatal deaths. We believe that intrapartum chemoprophylaxis with penicillin of all group B beta-hemolytic streptococcus-positive carrier mothers would significantly reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality from this cause.\r"

Cytotoxic and immunofluorescent IgG antibody results agreed in 79% of sera from men and women, 76% of seminal plasma, and 76% of cervical mucus (p less than 0.001; chi 2 analysis of positive and negative results). Titers or percent binding of sperm by cytotoxicity, hemagglutination, and IgG Immunobead-binding or immunofluorescence assays in serum and secretions of husbands and wives correlated (p less than 0.001). A significantly increased number of positive results was observed in cytotoxic and Immunobead-binding IgG assays when the husbands' and donors' sperm were used rather than donors' sperm alone. On the basis of this study we conclude: (1) that cytotoxicity, Immunobead-binding IgG, and immunofluorescent IgG sperm antibody assays correlate when sperm from the same source are used, (2) that women's isoimmunity to husbands' sperm is associated with their husbands' autoimmunity to sperm irrespective of the assay, and (3) that it is desirable to use sperm from the husbands and nonautoimmune fertile men in these assays.\r"

  ".W": "The level of prostaglandin E2, a potent stimulator of myometrial contractions, increases in amniotic fluid during labor. We tested whether amniotic prostaglandin E2 crosses the reflected fetal membranes to the myometrium during labor. Disks of amnion, chorion-decidua, and amnion chorion-decidua from 10 term pregnancies before labor and nine vaginal deliveries after normal spontaneous labor were incubated in two-sided perfusion chambers in the absence or presence of 1 mumol/L indomethacin, or in the presence of a bolus of prostaglandin E2 and radiolabeled prostaglandin E2 added to the fetal chamber. Net amniotic prostaglandin E2 increased significantly (p = 0.003) after labor. However, there was no significant difference in prostaglandin E2 concentrations on the maternal side of amnion chorion-decidua between labor conditions. High-pressure liquid chromatography identified the transport of intact tritiated prostaglandin E2 across amnion but not across chorion-decidua or amnion chorion-decidua in which prostaglandin E2 was completely metabolized. Because of 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase activity in chorion, we suggest that amniotic prostaglandin E2 transport to the myometrium is impaired. Thus the increase in prostaglandin E2 production that occurs in amnion tissue after labor commences does not result in an increase in prostaglandin E2 concentration on the myometrial side of the fetal membranes in the in vitro preparation.\r"

However, surgeon's estimation of blood loss as a result of the hysterotomy and blood loss estimated by the hemoglobin deficit measured on the second postoperative day did not significantly differ between the two groups. The use of the stapling device tended to lengthen the total operating time, which averaged 42.5 minutes in the group with the staples and 39.2 minutes in the group with the standard hysterotomy (p = 0.05). The risk of febrile morbidity, the frequency of endometritis, and the length of hospitalization were similar in the two groups.

To determine whether associated anatomic features may be useful in determining fetal prognosis, a retrospective study was performed over a 5-year period. There were 28 cases of omphalocele; 16 were larger than 5 cm and classified as giant, and the remainder were considered small. Eleven of the 12 infants with small omphaloceles survived with minimal neonatal complications. Ten of the 16 infants with giant omphaloceles died because of associated congenital anomalies. These were congenital heart disease, central nervous system malformations, and diaphragmatic hernias. This review suggests that the prognosis is good when a prenatal diagnosis of giant omphalocele is made and careful fetal ultrasonography, including echocardiography, does not identify heart, central nervous system, or diaphragmatic malformations, even when there is liver herniation into the omphalocele.\r"

An ultrasonographic classification of placental lesions that is based on their location, size, echogenicity, and number is proposed.

To determine whether pregnancy-related progesterone levels augmented this cocaine response, six nonpregnant ewes were surgically oophorectomized, implanted with femoral artery and vein catheters, and later administered progesterone 10 mg/kg intramuscularly for 3 days. Consistent responses in blood pressure and heart rate to intravenous norepinephrine 0.4 and 0.6 microgram/kg, before and during progesterone treatment, indicated that progesterone did not increase alpha-adrenergic receptor sensitivity to exogenous norepinephrine. In contrast, intravenous cocaine at either 1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg produced approximately twofold greater increases in blood pressure and threefold greater increases in heart rate during each day of progesterone treatment when compared with responses to the same dose of cocaine before progesterone treatment. These results indicate that progesterone enhances the cardiovascular response to cocaine and does not involve an increase in alpha-adrenergic receptor sensitivity.\r"

Spermatozoa treated with lyso-platelet activating factor, the biologically inactive form of platelet activating factor, were noted to have fertilization rates similar to those of the untreated (noncapacitated) group. These data show that synthetic platelet activating factor treatment of uncapacitated spermatozoa induces fertilization of rabbit oocytes in vitro in a manner similar to that for spermatozoa capacitated by high-ionic-strength media and significantly higher than that for untreated spermatozoa or after treatment with the biologically inactive form of platelet activating factor (lyso-platelet activating factor).\r"

  ".U": "91051766\r", 
  ".W": "The pulsatile release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone and the consequent secretion of gonadotropins are regulated by a complex interplay of steroids, neuropeptides, catecholamines, and environmental factors. Estrogen and progesterone influence the amplitude and frequency of luteinizing hormone pulsatile secretion. These effects lead to both a diurnal variation in pulse frequency, with a lower frequency at night, and variation during the menstrual cycle, with a lower frequency and increased amplitude during the luteal phase. Opioid peptides inhibit the pulsatile discharge of gonadotropin-releasing hormone and luteinizing hormone. The opioid antagonist, naloxone, causes an increase in luteinizing hormone secretion, particularly during the luteal phase. The administration of opioid receptor agonists, such as beta-endorphin, results in a decline in serum luteinizing hormone during the early follicular phase. Corticotropin-releasing factor, which is increased during stress, inhibits pulsatile luteinizing hormone secretion, and this effect can be blocked by the simultaneous administration of naloxone. These observations suggest that corticotropin-releasing factor exerts its effects on luteinizing hormone through an opioidergic intermediary. Endogenous catecholamines such as dopamine inhibit pulsatile luteinizing hormone release; however, the mechanism involved is not clear.\r"

  ".W": "Pulsatile administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone represents a major advance in the treatment of anovulation in women who fail to ovulate with clomiphene citrate and is an alternative for many women who currently receive human menopausal gonadotropin. Four issues must be addressed before administering pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone: (1) safety, (2) efficacy, (3) convenience, and (4) cost. Each of these issues will be affected by the three major decisions a physician makes with gonadotropin-releasing hormone therapy: (1) patient selection, (2) route of administration, and (3) dose of gonadotropin-releasing hormone. The ideal candidate for gonadotropin-releasing hormone therapy is a patient with an absence of endogenous pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone, as seen in hypothalamic amenorrhea. Although women with polycystic ovarian disease can be treated with pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone, a decreased ovulation rate should be expected. The route of administration, intravenous or subcutaneous, and the degree of monitoring can be tailored by the physician to fit each patient's needs. Pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone therapy is a safe, effective, convenient, and economical alternative to human menopausal gonadotropin for ovulation induction in women resistant to clomiphene.\r"

  ".W": "In addition to its occurrence within the eye, pseudoexfoliative fibrillopathy has been reported in the conjunctiva and around a posterior ciliary artery. To determine whether it has a more diffuse extraocular distribution, we studied skin biopsy specimens ultrastructurally from one to three areas in 13 patients with classic pseudoexfoliation. A fibrillopathy closely resembling that in the eye was found in 11 of the 13 patients. Only one of the 13 control subjects, a 78-year-old man with advanced low-tension glaucoma, had a similar fibrillopathy. In the patients with pseudoexfoliation who were more than 70 years of age, the accompanying dermal elastosis made evaluation difficult, because the pseudoexfoliative nodules in the skin occur primarily along elastic fibers, and their morphologic characteristics appeared to be influenced by the elastotic process. These results suggest that pseudoexfoliation is a systemic process related closely to elastosis, and that further search for pseudoexfoliative fibers should be made in the elastic system of the deep tissues and internal organs.\r"

Type II featured plump, fusiform, endothelial cells, often with a hyperchromatic nucleus and foci of immature spindle cells and occasional slit vessels. Type III was characterized by large aggregates of densely packed spindle cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, occasional mitotic figures, and abundant slit spaces often containing erythrocytes in between. Clinically, type I and type II tumors were patchy and flat (less than 3 mm in height) and of less than four months' duration. Type III tumors were nodular and elevated (greater than 3 mm in height). We describe the clinical and histopathologic types of Kaposi's sarcoma that may help in diagnosis.\r"

Two children who died of this syndrome had prominent Schwalbe's rings with attached iris strands characteristic of Axenfeld's syndrome. Additional histologic findings of iris atrophy and stromal nodules, however, made the designation Axenfeld-Reiger's syndrome more appropriate. Pigmentary retinopathy, degeneration of Bruch's membrane, and prominent lipofuscin deposition in the ciliary muscle noted in one of the patients were not regarded as primary changes of Alagille's syndrome, but were believed to be secondary to acquired deficiency of the fat-soluble vitamins A and E. Early recognition of the ocular changes in arteriohepatic dysplasia is helpful in establishing the proper diagnosis to avoid unnecessary abdominal surgery and institute vitamin therapy.\r"

Myelin artifact occurs when crushed optic nerve tissue is squeezed into the eye at the time of enucleation. Intralesional hemorrhage may occur during surgery and may be correlated with fluctuations in intraocular pressure. We reviewed 519 cases of posterior uveal melanoma treated by enucleation between 1950 and 1970. Without knowledge of the follow-up data, we examined histologic sections for myelin artifact, intralesional hemorrhage, subretinal hemorrhage, Callender cell type, size of tumor, necrosis, and scleral or orbital invasion. Neither myelin artifact nor intralesional hemorrhage were independent prognostic risk factors. These findings do not support or refute the hypothesis that excessive trauma during enucleation results in a worse prognosis.\r"

We studied 126 ciliochoroidal melanomas, three coincidental nevi that occurred in eyes with melanomas, and one magnocellular nevus collected from the Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study to determine the effectiveness of the silver-stained nucleolar organizer region technique in assessing the malignant potential of these tumors. Malignant lesions demonstrated higher mean silver-stained nucleolar organizer region counts (4.347) than benign nevi (1.855) (P less than or equal to .0001). Among malignant melanomas, mixed-cell melanomas had slightly higher counts than spindle-cell melanomas (P less than or equal to .0001), but this difference was not important clinically. Results were also compared to other histopathologic variables, which disclosed correlation of silver-stained nucleolar organizer regions with mitoses and tumor size. Comparison with computerized cytomorphometric analyses of prognosis also disclosed significant correlation. This technique may prove to be a useful adjunct in the assessment of malignancy and treatment response of uveal melanomas.\r"

The histologic findings in one type of lesion were consistent with congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium or benign pigmented nevus of the retinal pigment epithelium. The other two types of lesion were most consistent with hamartomatous malformations of the retinal pigment epithelium featuring cellular hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and rarely retinal invasion and formation of a minute mushroom-shaped tumor. These histopathologic findings indicate a generalized effect of the familial adenomatous polyposis gene on the retinal pigment epithelium. This oncogene, which is responsible for tumor formation in the gastrointestinal tract, soft tissues, bone, and other locations in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, also leads to a generalized defect in melanogenesis and focal lesions of the retinal pigment epithelium.\r"

Phaseolus vulgaris leukoagglutinin (L-PHA) requires the beta 1-6-linked lactosamine antenna for high-affinity binding and was used histochemically to characterize the distribution of these sugar structures in human esophageal squamous cell carcinomas from 42 patients. Leukoagglutinin-reactive carcinoma cells in the invasive tumors were distributed predominantly on the outer surface of the tumor adjacent to the surrounding tissue. Furthermore, when TE 1 cells, a human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma line, were cultured in a collagen gel matrix to obtain colonies in a three-dimensional form, these colonies exhibited high affinity for L-PHA binding only in the outer cell layer facing the collagen matrix, unrelated to the cell growth cycle. These findings suggest that the increase in beta 1-6-branched oligosaccharides in esophageal carcinomas is an important trait of the tumor in the invasion into the surrounding tissue.\r"

  ".U": "91051803\r", 
  ".W": "Various cholestatic liver diseases are accompanied by a striking increase in the number of bile ductules. This so-called ductular reaction is thought to arise both from ductular metaplasia of hepatocytes and from proliferation of pre-existing bile ductules. Previous studies have shown that these reactive bile ductules differ from their normal counterpart in enzyme and immunohistochemical make-up. Using monoclonal antibodies directed to neuroendocrine markers and immunohistochemistry, we found that reactive bile ductules in cholestatic liver disease display neuroendocrine features. In all cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), extrahepatic obstruction, and acute hepatitis A, reactive bile ductules expressed the neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) and reacted with monoclonal antibody A2B5. Both N-CAM and the ganglioside, recognized by A2B5, are restricted to neuroendocrine cells and tissues. In all but four of these cases, the same bile ductules expressed chromogranin-A, present in the matrix of neuroendocrine granules. Furthermore, in three cases of longstanding cholestasis, scattered periportal hepatocytes expressed chromogranin-A but not N-CAM. Other neuroendocrine markers such as neuron-specific enolase, synaptophysin, or myelin-associated glycoprotein were lacking from both bile ductules and hepatocytes. The neuroendocrine phenotype of bile ductules and hepatocytes was confirmed on electronmicroscopy, demonstrating various numbers of dense-cored, neuroendocrine granules near the peripheral cell membrane in bile ductules as well as in cells intermediate between hepatocytes and bile ductular cells. In 10 cases of normal liver tissue without ductular reaction, bile ductules lacked neuroendocrine markers except in two cases in which very weak reactivity for chromogranin-A was observed. These findings illustrate the presence of a new, neuroendocrine cell type that emerges in the liver during cholestasis. Elucidation of the significance of the neuroendocrine substance(s) produced in the dense cored granules of reactive bile ductules awaits their isolation and characterization. We can speculate that this molecule plays an autocrine or paracrine regulatory role in the process of ductular metaplasia of hepatocytes or growth of bile ductules.\r"

During experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS, loss of BBB function occurs. The authors have previously shown an increase in endothelial transcytotic activity associated with decreased mitochondrial content as evidence of BBB dysfunction in EAE. These changes occurred in the capillary bed and correlated with CNS edema and clinical signs. In the present report, a fixation procedure before infusion of the intravascular tracer horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in rats at the height of clinical EAE has been used. In these animals, tracer leakage was only noted in inflamed venules with diameters of 12 to 19 mu. The authors detected several mechanisms of passive leakage: 1) increased junctional permeability; 2) increased interendothelial space; 3) leakage alongside migrating inflammatory cells. Some small capillaries showed necrotic changes with minimal tracer leakage. This report demonstrates that BBB disruption also occurs via nonendocytic mechanisms that may be induced by inflammatory cells.\r"

Methods applied included conventional histology; test point analysis; semiautomated morphometry of nuclear profile features of Reed-Sternberg and other atypical large cells (RSALCs); and immunohistochemistry of these elements on all paraffin sections and, in 15 cases, on frozen sections. Mean nuclear profile morphotypes of RSALCs per case varied independently of immunophenotype and histologic diagnosis. Conversely, immunohistochemistry demonstrated significant, although not consistent, preferential positivities of these CD30+ elements for CD15 in HD, and for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and CD43 in ALCLs. In the latter, RSALCs also exhibited a tendency for CD45 and CD45RO positivity and for the expression of T-cell-associated antigens. However, there were considerable overlaps. This continuous spectrum of RSALC nuclear profile morphotypes and immunophenotypes, ranging from HD over questionable cases, intermediate between HD and ALCL, to ALCLs, was paralleled by differences in the reactive component of lymphomas. Lymphocytes and granulocytes were significantly deficient in ALCLs.\r"

Vimentin expression in 10% or more of tumor cells was found in 78% of medullary (14 of 18), in 16% of ductal not otherwise specified (NOS) (35 of 214), and in two of four mucinous carcinomas. A further seven tumors showed vimentin expression in less than 1% to 10% of the cells. Vimentin was expressed in tumor cells of 30% (28 of 93) of grade III invasive ductal NOS carcinomas versus 7% (7 of 105) of grade II and 0% of grade I carcinomas (0 of 10). Vimentin was found to be preferentially expressed in tumors growing in broad, often anastomosing bands or sheets with extensive necrosis, scanty supportive stroma, high nuclear grade, and numerous mitoses. The authors conclude that vimentin is not detected in lobular carcinomas, but is preferentially expressed in medullary and in high-grade ductal NOS breast carcinomas.\r"

Host irradiation before transplantation was found to play an additive or synergistic role in the development of GVHD. Furthermore the histologic features noted in DBA/2----B6D2F1 murine colonic GVHD suggest that bone marrow and spleen cell transplantation in this strain combination may be a useful model for studying the immunologic mechanisms involved in human inflammatory bowel disease. Thus severe colonic disease noted during the course of DBA/2----B6D2F1 murine GVHD was found to have significant histopathologic similarities to both human GVHD enteropathy and other inflammatory diseases of the human colon.\r"

The development of antigen-induced arthritis in normal mice has been compared with that in beige mice. The pattern of synovitis (both leukocyte accumulation and plasma leakage) were indistinguishable in normal and beige mice. Cartilage proteoglycan depletion was quantified by measuring the decrease in safranin O staining intensity, and this, too, was unaltered in mice lacking elastase and cathepsin G. These results suggest that neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G do not contribute to these aspects of joint pathology in antigen-induced arthritis in the mouse.\r"

The possibility that the activated c-Ha-ras (EJras) oncogene might influence the pathway of differentiation of these stem cells is investigated in the current study. Activated ras oncogene was transfected and stably expressed in 3T3 T cells; assays then were performed to determine its effect on differentiation. The results show that all EJras-transfected cell lines lose their ability to differentiate to adipocytes and instead differentiate into cells that express many characteristics of macrophages. Such cells contain numerous cytoplasmic granules, extensive nonspecific esterase activity, and anchorage-independent growth. The modulation of differentiation pathway from an adipocyte lineage to a macrophagelike cell lineage does not result from the transforming effect of EJras, because a nontransformed cell clone that expresses p21EJras protein also exhibits this modified differentiation pathway. These data suggest that the EJras oncogene specifically modulates the differentiation pathway of 3T3 T mesenchymal stem cells. This experimental system should therefore provide an excellent model to evaluate the mechanistic role of EJras in the process of metaplasia.\r"

  ".W": "We report the development of an animal model of multiple necrotizing enteritis (MNE) in rats. When rats were injected directly with a culture supernatant of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated rat peritoneal macrophages into the abdominal aorta, the overt pathologic lesions of MNE developed within 30 minutes after injection. The rats showed an elevated level of blood fibrinogen degradation product content even 30 minutes after injection. Furthermore the rats that were pretreated intravenously with heparin sulfate did not develop MNE, indicating the acute disturbances of blood microcirculation in the intestine. Multiple necrotizing enteritis was developed also by the injection with recombinant tumor necrosis factor (rTNF) but rarely was observed with even a high dose of recombinant interleukin-1 (rIL-1) or platelet-activating factor (PAF). The supernatant was cytotoxic in vitro to TNF-susceptible LM and many other cells but was less cytotoxic to the TNF-resistant LR line. Partial purification of the supernatant suggested that the supernatant contained a cytokine that has biochemical features of TNF. Furthermore polyclonal anti-TNF antibody could inhibit not only the cytotoxicity in vitro but also MNE development in vivo by this factor. These data strongly indicate that MNE possibly could be caused by a TNF-like cytokine produced by macrophages that are stimulated by the endotoxin.\r"

To obtain valuable tools for immunolabeling, two murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against the ACPA antigen were produced. In neutrophils, the authors observed immunogold label for the ACPA antigen, predominantly in myeloperoxidase-positive azurophil granules, and in smaller amounts on the plasma membrane. In monocytes, the ACPA antigen could be detected in small granules, which occasionally also contained myeloperoxidase, and rare labeling was found on the monocyte membrane. The finding that the ACPA antigen is expressed on the plasma membrane of neutrophils and monocytes, thereby becoming accessible to circulating autoantibodies, supports the supposition that ACPA are not only markers of disease activity, but also are involved in the pathogenesis of Wegener's granulomatosis.\r"

  ".W": "Microvascular proliferation, a hallmark of malignant brain tumors, represents an attractive target of anticancer research, especially because of the quiescent nonproliferative endothelium of the normal brain. Cerebral neoplasms sequester copper, a trace metal that modulates angiogenesis. Using a rabbit brain tumor model, normocupremic animals developed large vascularized VX2 carcinomas. By contrast, small, circumscribed, relatively avascular tumors were found in the brains of rabbits copper-depleted by diet and penicillamine treatment (CDPT). The CDPT rabbits showed a significant decrease in serum copper, copper staining of tumor cell nuclei, microvascular density, the tumor volume, endothelial cell turnover, and an increase in the vascular permeability (breakdown of the blood-brain barrier), as well as peritumoral brain edema. In non-tumor-bearing animals, CDPT did not alter the vascular permeability or the brain water content. CDPT also inhibited the intracerebral growth of the 9L gliosarcoma in F-344 rats, with a similar increase of the peritumoral vascular permeability and the brain water content. CDPT failed to inhibit tumor growth and the vascularization of the VX2 carcinoma in the thigh muscle or the metastases to the lung, findings that may reflect regional differences in the responsiveness of the endothelium, the distribution of copper, or the activity of cuproenzymes. Metabolic and pharmacologic withdrawal of copper suppresses intracerebral tumor angiogenesis; angiosuppression is a novel biologic response modifier for the in situ control of tumor growth in the brain.\r"

Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to cytokeratins included MAb KA 1, which binds to polypeptide 5 in a complex with polypeptide 14 and recognizes preferentially myoepithelial cells; MAb KA4, which binds to polypeptides 14, 15, 16 and 19; individual MAbs to polypeptides 7, 13, and 16, 17, 18, and 19, and the MAb mixture AE1/AE3. The authors also applied three MAbs to vimentin (Vim), and three MAbs to glial filament protein (GFP). Selected samples were studied by double-label immunofluorescence microscopy and by staining sequential sections with some of the said MAbs, an MAb to alpha-smooth muscle actin, and well-characterized polyclonal antibodies for the possible coexpression of diverse types of cytoskeletal proteins. Gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis also were performed. All samples reacted for cytokeratins with MAbs AE1/AE3, although the reaction did not involve all cells. Monoclonal antibody KA4 stained preferentially the luminal-secretory cells in the normal breast and in FCD, whereas it stained the vast majority of cells in all carcinomas. Monoclonal antibody KA1 stained preferentially the basal-myoepithelial cells of the normal breast and FCD while staining tumor cell subpopulations in 4 of 31 carcinomas. Vimentin-positive cells were found in 8 of 12 normal breasts and in 12 of 20 FCD; in most cases, Vim-reactive cells appeared to be myoepithelial, but occasional luminal cells were also stained. Variable subpopulations of Vim-positive cells were noted in 9 of 20 ductal and in 1 of 7 lobular carcinomas. Glial filament protein-reactive cells were found in normal breast lobules and ducts and in 15 of 20 cases of FCD; with rare exceptions, GFP-reactivity was restricted to basally located, myoepithelial-appearing cells. Occasional GFP-reactive cells were found in 3 of 31 carcinomas. Evaluation of sequential sections and double-label immunofluorescence microscopy showed the coexpression of certain cytokeratins (possibly including polypeptides 14 and 17) with vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin together with GFP in some myoepithelial cells. The presence of GFP in myoepithelial cells was confirmed by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Our results indicate that coexpression of cytokeratin with vimentin and/or GFP is comparatively frequent in normal basal-myoepithelial cells of the breast.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

A total of 134 biopsies from a variety of normal tissues (94 from urothelium and 40 from other tissues) were examined. In addition, changes in the expression of these antigens associated with neoplastic transformation were evaluated in 70 biopsies from transitional cell carcinomas of 19 AB heterozygous patients. There was heterogeneity in the distribution of tissue A and B antigens, depending on the cell type, as well as among cells of the same type. Ninety-one percent of AB heterozygotes expressed both A and B antigens in normal epithelial cells, with a mosaic distribution clearly apparent in 50% of these individuals. In 21% of these subjects, the A antigen was undetectable in the vascular endothelial cells in all biopsies from several organs. In most (79%) transitional cell neoplasms, only one of the two antigens was consistently expressed. The results of this study may have implications for the clonal or specific gene deletion theories of neoplasia. They also demonstrate the existence of a subgroup of AB individuals in whom the A antigen is absent specifically from the vascular endothelium.\r"

  ".U": "91051817\r", 
  ".W": "Cryostat sections of 58 lymph nodes were immunostained with a polyclonal rabbit serum against IL-1 alpha, and with monoclonal antibodies directed to IL-1 alpha (Vmp18), IL-1 beta (Vhp20 and BRhC3), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) (B154.7). Furthermore the presence of cytokine-containing cells was correlated with the expression of endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule (ELAM-1; 29F2) and of human leukocyte antigen (HLA-DR) (OKIa-1) by endothelial cells. Cells containing IL-1 and/or TNF alpha were detected mainly in pathologic conditions characterized by reactive or neoplastic expansion of the lymph node paracortex. Cells positive for IL-1 were detected in 16 of 21 cases of Hodgkin's disease, in 4 of 4 cases of T-NHL, and in 5 cases of diffuse or mixed lymphadenitis. Interleukin-1 alpha was detected in macrophages, interdigitating reticulum cells (IDRCs), endothelial cells, and neoplastic Hodgkin's and Reed-Sternberg (H-RS) cells. Cells positive for IL-1 beta were much fewer and consisted mainly of macrophages. Hodgkin's Reed-Sternberg cells were negative for IL-1 beta even after in vitro stimulation with bacterial endotoxin. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) was present in macrophages and H-RS cells. Endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 expression by endothelial venules was detected in 17 of 20 cases of Hodgkin's disease, in 2 of 4 cases of T-NHL, and in 5 of 5 cases of diffuse lymphadenitis. In these pathologic conditions, HLA-DR antigens also were expressed frequently by endothelial cells. Cytokine-containing cells and ELAM-1-positive high endothelial venules (HEV) were extremely rare in lymph nodes involved by follicular lymphadenitis (12 cases) or B-NHL (16 cases). In cases of reactive or neoplastic B-cell proliferations, HLA-DR-positive HEVs still were present often. Our results indicate that IL-1/TNF alpha production at tissue level is often associated with ELAM-1 expression by HEVs, but is less well correlated with expression of HLA-DR antigens by endothelial cells.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) mRNA is present in a preformed intracellular pool in the spleen, liver, and small bowel of naive rats. Endotoxin (Salmonella typhus lipopolysaccharide) injected intravenously induces little or no increase in whole-organ TNF mRNA levels at 15', 30', 1 degree, 2 degrees, or 4 degrees, whereas serum TNF levels are markedly elevated at 1 and 2 hours. Dexamethasone pretreatment of rats suppresses LPS-induced serum TNF concentrations, but does not suppress TNF mRNA levels in the spleen or bowel. Tachyphylaxis experiments demonstrate that a second injection of endotoxin 2 hours after an initial injection fails to induce a second peak of serum TNF, although TNF mRNA levels in the spleen and bowel remain at the levels found in naive rats. Corynebacterium parvum upregulates endotoxin-induced serum TNF release and intravenous injection of IL-1 induces the release of serum TNF but neither alters whole-organ TNF mRNA levels. Interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) mRNA was not constitutively detected in whole-organ RNA preparations of the spleen, liver, and small bowel of naive rats. Endotoxin induces IL-1 alpha mRNA most easily appreciated in the spleen beginning at 1 hour, peaking at 2 to 4 hours, and disappearing by 6 hours. Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) mRNA was not constitutively detected in the organs examined or was present in small amounts. Endotoxin induces IL-1 beta mRNA beginning at 0.5 hours, peaking at 1 hour, and disappearing by 6 hours. Dexamethasone pretreatment prevents the LPS-induced appearance of IL-1 alpha mRNA and suppresses but does not completely inhibit the appearance of IL-1 beta mRNA. C. parvum upregulates endotoxin-induced IL-1 mRNA expression. Intravenous injection of TNF or IL-1 both induce IL-1 mRNA expression. In conclusion, TNF mRNA is constitutively expressed and TNF mRNA levels as analyzed in whole-organ RNA preparations do not change in concert with serum TNF protein levels during conditions of endotoxemia, dexamethasone treatment, tachyphylaxis, priming with C. parvum, or after injection of IL-1. In contrast, IL-1 mRNA expression during endotoxemia, dexamethasone treatment, priming with C. parvum, or after injection of TNF or IL-1 shows clear increases and decreases in whole-organ RNA preparations.\r"

Light microscopy reveals a progressive increase in chromosomal damage (condensation, pulverization). At or above 10 mumol/l MeHg, progression through all the phases of the cell cycle is blocked and mitotic cells are arrested irreversibly in anaphase, with most exhibiting arrangement of chromosomes in a wreathlike ring formation. Also the cells exhibit both nuclear propidium iodide (PI) fluorescence (indicative of loss of viability) and concurrent cytoplasmic carboxyfluorescein (CF) fluorescence (viable cells exhibit CF fluorescence and exclude PI). In addition, there is a dose-dependent increase in cellular refractive index (90 degrees light scatter), an apparent decrease in cell volume (axial light loss), and progressive resistance to detergent (NP-40)-mediated cytolysis. Resistance to detergent-mediated cytolysis is indicative of fixation (protein denaturation, cross-linking, and so on) of the plasma membrane/cytoplasm complex. Our findings indicate that DNA synthesis is the primary target of MeHg cytotoxicity and that apparent targets and degree of cytotoxicity are a complex function of dose.\r"

Meanwhile, however, expression of CD13 has also been detected in some hepatocellular, gallbladder, renal, and lung carcinomas, and even in some fibrosarcomas and malignant melanomas. In this study, expression of CD13 antigen was immunohistochemically examined in non-neoplastic mesenchymal cells, along with 33 benign and 83 malignant mesenchymal tumors (MET) using CD13 monoclonal antibodies (MAb) My7, U71, WM-15, and MoU48. In non-neoplastic mesenchymal cells, expression of CD13 was restricted to perivascular fibrocytes/blasts, tissue histiocytes, osteoclasts, and to the perineurium of peripheral nerve trunks. Under neoplastic conditions, CD13 was detectable in some tumors of smooth muscle, fibrous, fibrohistiocytic, synovial, osteogenic, and peripheral nerve sheath origin, and even in some tumors of adipose tissue. Tumors of striated muscle origin, of autonomic ganglia, and of cartilage-forming tissues were CD13-negative throughout. Thus in most but not all tumors studied the pattern of expression of CD13 mirrors the situation found in their cells of origin. These findings enrich the data on expression of leukocyte differentiation antigens in extra-hematopoietic tissues. Expression of CD13, which meanwhile is known to be identical to aminopeptidase N, an important peptide-cleaving enzyme, in only some MET might reflect a special functional state of these neoplasms.\r"

In studies using double-label immunostaining of primary amyloidosis-lambda light chain type (AL) and AA associated with Crohn's disease, AP occurred as widely separated single units along the amyloid fibrils and represented 1.5% and 6.5% of the total gold label in AL and AA, respectively, while the major fibril protein was labeled in single rows, similar to beads on a string. Fibrillar aggregates in the capillary lumens were labeled similarly by antisera to the major protein and AP and appeared to be contiguous with the fibrillar deposits at the glomerular basement membrane (GBM)-luminal interface, suggesting intravascular fibrillogenesis.\r"

  ".U": "91051823\r", 
  ".W": "This study was designed to determine the effect of cyclocreatine on the release of neutrophil chemotactic factors (NCF) from isolated rabbit hearts. We tested the hypothesis that if ischemia is important for the formation of NCF from the myocardium, then blocking (or delaying) ischemic changes with cyclocreatine should inhibit the release of NCF. Two models were used, including (1) perfusion of rabbit hearts (Langendorff apparatus) with oxygenated (95% oxygen) Krebs-Henseleit buffer (K-H buffer) containing 5% cyclocreatine for 120 minutes, and (2) incubating hearts with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5% cyclocreatine for 120 minutes. For both models, rabbits were injected intravenously with 10 ml of 5% cyclocreatine solution 30 minutes before the animals were killed and the hearts removed. Control rabbits were injected with 5% creatine solution or saline for 30 minutes before perfusing hearts with K-H buffer or incubating with PBS. Chemotactic activity was assayed in the perfusates and supernatants using modified Boyden chambers and rabbit peritoneal neutrophils as indicator cells. The chemoattractant f-Met-Leu-Phe (f-MLP) was the positive control for a 100% response rate. Isolated hearts perfused with cyclocreatine showed significantly lower chemotactic activity (ie, 1.24 +/- 1% f-MLP; P less than 0.0001) compared to hearts perfused with K-H buffer (129 +/- 18%) or creatine (227 +/- 42%) (mean +/- standard error). Similar results were obtained using incubated hearts. Next the effect of cyclocreatine on neutrophils in the Boyden chamber was determined and it was found that it did not alter neutrophil migration, which excludes a direct inhibitory effect on the cells. Furthermore supernatant from cyclocreatine-treated hearts did not inhibit neutrophil chemotaxis to C5a, indicating absence of a chemotaxis inhibitor in this preparation. Results of these studies suggest that the observed low activity recovered in perfusate and supernatant of cyclocreatine-treated hearts is a result of reduction in the synthesis and/or release of the factors from myocardial tissues. Similar to previously established data, cyclocreatine treatment significantly preserved myocardial nucleotide levels (ie, adenosine triphosphate and creatine phosphate), which supports our hypothesis that the formation of NCF is ischemia dependent and that maintaining elevated levels of myocardial energy nucleotides reduced chemotactic factor release.\r"

Significant changes in serum fatty acid composition were demonstrated. Gamma-linolenic acid proved consistently superior to EPA in modulating the neovascular response judged by three neovascular indices. At 14 days, GLA significantly reduced the polymorphonuclear leukocyte and macrophage inflammatory infiltrate and EPA reduced the macrophage component, both with high dose; EPA also reduced keratocyte proliferation. Wound-healing parameters were unaffected. Evidence for GLA-EPA synergism was modest. Prolonged neovascular responses and chronic inflammation occurring in the clinically relevant context of severe structural damage can be modulated by nutritional alteration of the eicosanoid precursor pool.\r"

Ultrastructural immunohistochemistry demonstrated that HS within neurons of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain was localized to lipofuscin granules, an aging pigment previously shown also to contain beta-amyloid protein (BAP). Heparan sulfate also was localized to neurite-containing, nonfibrillar 'primitive' plaques that also demonstrated positive BAP immunoreactivity in both AD and DS brains. Antibodies to laminin, fibronectin, and a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan failed to show positive immunostaining of the HS-containing sites described above. Analysis of DS patients at different ages revealed that HS accumulated within neurons of the hippocampus and amygdala as early as 1 day after birth. Young age-matched controls did not demonstrate similar positive HS immunoreactivity in neurons, whereas positive immunostaining for HS was observed in other regions thought to normally contain HS. The earliest deposition of BAP was first observed as 'amorphous' or 'diffuse' cortical deposits in DS brain in patients aged 18 and 24 years before the accumulation of fibrillar amyloid (observed in DS patients who are 35 years and older). These cortical deposits also contained positive HS immunoreactivity, implying that HS accumulation in conjunction with the BAP is an early event that ultimately may contribute to the early age-related accumulation (ie, as early as 35 years of age in DS) of NPs, NFTs, and/or CA. Furthermore the colocalization of HS and BAP in a number of specific locales in AD and DS brain indicates a possible interaction between these two macromolecules that may be important in lesion development in these two diseases.\r"

  ".W": "This study models the survival outcomes of children born to HIV-infected (human immunodeficiency virus) women who are breast-fed, bottle-fed, and wet-nursed. It is estimated that, given the relative risk of alternatives to maternal milk in developing countries, the probability of HIV transmission via breast milk would need to be at least .12 in a community with an under five child mortality rate from non-HIV causes of 100/1000 live births and at least .27 in a community with a rate of 200/1000 before alternative feeding practices should be recommended even to the known HIV-infected mother who has an available feeding alternative with a relative risk of 2:1. While such a low relative risk may be achievable with wet nursing, most studies report a relative risk of at least 3:1 for bottle feeding. A sensitivity analysis is conducted around the relative risk of child mortality from non-HIV causes associated with different feeding practices. While the critical transmission rate does not vary significantly with a rate of false positives as high as 20 percent on the HIV screening test, the critical transmission rate is very sensitive to the availability of HIV screening. In communities where the HIV prevalence rate among mothers reaches 40 percent, breast-feeding should still be recommended in the absence of HIV screening unless HIV transmission via breast milk surpasses 30 percent.\r"

Men were somewhat more likely to drink caffeinated coffee while women were more likely to drink decaffeinated coffee. In men, but not women, caffeinated coffee drinking decreased with age and decaffeinated coffee drinking increased. Caffeinated coffee drinkers drank more alcohol, consumed more dietary saturated fats and cholesterol, were more likely to be current smokers and less likely to be current exercisers than were non-coffee drinkers. Smoking and exercise also showed a dose-response relationship to the amount of caffeinated coffee consumed. Risk factor levels among drinkers of decaffeinated coffee were more like those of caffeinated coffee than non-drinkers. These data illustrate the clustering of atherogenic behaviors with coffee drinking and highlight their potential importance in interpreting the growing body of literature about coffee and health.\r"

Correlations were moderate to high for calories and for most nutrients. There were no differences in mean intake of total calories or in intake of most macronutrients and micronutrients assessed. At least two-thirds of the children in the lowest (or highest) quintile based on home observations were correctly classified into the lowest or second lowest (or highest) quintiles based on mother's reports for calories and most nutrients. For all food items that were both observed and reported, 51 percent of reported portion sizes were equivalent to observed portion sizes, 15.5 percent were smaller, and 33.5 percent were larger. There was fair to good agreement on the number of food items eaten, with the exception of vegetables. Mothers' recall appears to be useful for classifying children by intake of calories, macronutrients and micronutrients, but provides a somewhat less accurate measure of actual foods eaten, portion sizes, and nutrient levels consumed.\r"

  ".W": "We developed a new dietary assessment instrument, the Food Behavior Checklist (FBC), which measures food use related to adopting lower-fat and higher-fiber diets. The FBC is a simplification of the 24-hour diet recall that consists of 19 simple yes/no questions about foods consumed during the previous day. To develop the FBC, an expert committee generated a list of foods based on our intervention program, and we used focus groups and random-digit dialing pretests to refine the format and clarify items. To validate the FBC, we compared responses of 96 women on the FBC to information collected during a professionally administered 24-hour diet recall. For most items, agreement between the FBC and 24-hour recall, based on the kappa statistic, was good to excellent. Agreement was poor for items requiring detailed knowledge about food composition (e.g. high-fiber cereal). There was a trend to over-report general food categories (e.g. luncheon meats) but not specific food items (e.g. ice cream). In an embedded randomized study, we found that a set of introductory items designed to serve as a memory retrieval cue did not improve agreement between the FBC and 24-hour recall. These data provide preliminary evidence supporting the use of short checklist questionnaires on the previous day's food use as a means to assess diet at the group or community level. This relatively inexpensive and rapid measure can be used to inform the design of public health nutrition programs and as an evaluation tool in intervention research.\r"

Smokers in several age-race-sex categories have lower intakes of vitamin C, folate, fiber, and vitamin A than non-smokers, and intake tended to decrease as cigarette consumption increased, particularly for vitamin C, fiber, and folate. Smokers were less likely to have consumed vegetables, fruits (particularly fruits and vegetables high in vitamins C and A), high fiber grains, low fat milk, and vitamin and mineral supplements than non-smokers. A negative linear trend was found between smoking intensity and intake of several categories of fruits and vegetables. These data suggest that the high cancer risk associated with smoking is compounded by somewhat lower intake of nutrients and foods which are thought to be cancer protective.\r"

Results were compared to yearly quit rates of 2.5 percent to 5 percent for 736 workers who were ex-smokers at the initial examination. Of the 504 men who responded by mail, 29.8 percent had quit smoking, 35.9 percent had cut down from a mean of 28 to 13 cigarettes per day, and 34.3 percent were smoking as before. Subsequent follow-up at one year showed that 25.6 percent remained quit, and that 23 percent of those who cut down had quit, for an overall quit rate of 34 percent. Of 101 non-responders contacted by telephone, 17 percent had quit and 53 percent had reduced smoking. In both samples, those who quit were more likely to have had lower alveolar carbon monoxide (COa) levels, to be older, and to have had asbestosis. Responders by mail were the same age as non-responders but had smoked longer, had higher prevalences of asbestosis, emphysema, chronic bronchitis and higher COa. Demonstration of the adverse personal effects of smoking appear to have contributed to the quit rates or reduced smoking rates in 65 percent of the responding workers.\r"

Chlamydia cases were distributed diffusely; geographic overlap between the two diseases was only about 40 percent. Gonococcal coinfection was noted in less than 10 percent of patients with chlamydia. Nearly half of men with chlamydia and four-fifths of women were asymptomatic and most cases were identified through screening or contact tracing. Populations at high risk for chlamydia are seemingly different from those for gonorrhea. Differences may be due to control interventions (active for gonorrhea, passive for chlamydia). Chlamydia case reporting and control initiatives are recommended.\r"

These statistics are found to vary greatly even under the \"null hypothesis\" that all dentists are using procedures at the same rates. The simulated dentist rates are compared to observed rates obtained in a different study. These findings illustrate problems that can occur in small area analysis studies, and emphasize the importance of using statistical techniques that are appropriate for the data that are to be analyzed. Investigators should make every effort to obtain patient-level data, or at least to understand the underlying distribution of the number of procedures per patient, to avoid mistaking significant deviations from an incorrect model as evidence for significant variation among small areas.\r"

Population-based surveys were completed by 278 elderly health maintenance organization (HMO) patients in August 1984. Physical and mental health status and social support were measured in the survey. Automated prescription records from the year prior to and the year after the survey were linked to data from the survey. Patients received 737 prescriptions for psychotropic drugs during the two-year period under study. Doxepin (20.2 percent), flurazepam (15.2 percent), and diazepam (14.8 percent) were dispensed most frequently. Nearly 30 percent of the patients received a prescription for at least one psychotropic drug during the two-year period, and 14 percent received at least one prescription during both years. Three significant predictors of subsequent psychotropic drug use were: prior use (odds ratio = 17.2, 95% CI = 6.25, 47.33), the number of physical impairments (OR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.05, 2.84), and the respondent's rating on the Alameda Health Scale (OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 0.99, 2.75).

Twenty-seven years later, remaining members of the cohort were interviewed to ascertain physical abilities, and a score on a disability scale was assigned. Multivariate logistic analyses examined disability in relation to uncomplicated angina pectoris (AP), complicated AP, and coronary heart disease other than AP, controlling for possible confounders. In younger and older women and men, uncomplicated and complicated AP were associated with disability. Coronary heart disease other than AP was associated with disability only in the younger men. Congestive heart failure predicted disability only in the women. These results suggest that onset of AP should be recognized as a critical point in the development of disability and that AP is a better predictor of disability than is myocardial infarction or coronary insufficiency.\r"

Hypertension is defined as diastolic greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg, or systolic greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg, or currently taking antihypertensive medication. Among Mexican Americans in the Southwestern United States, 16.8 percent of the males and 14.1 percent of the females were found to be hypertensive. Among Cuban Americans in Dade County, Florida 22.8 percent of the males and 15.5 percent of the females were hypertensive. Among Puerto Ricans in the New York City area 15.6 percent of the males and 11.5 percent of the females were hypertensive. The age-adjusted rates are significantly lower than comparable rates for Whites and Blacks as measured in the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II), 1976-80. Control of hypertension in the HHANES populations fall short of the 1990 Objectives for the Nation established by the US Public Health Service 60 percent (34 percent controlled Mexican American hypertensives, 27.8 percent controlled Cuban American hypertensives, and 29 percent controlled Puerto Rican hypertensives.\r"

The prevalence rates were one-fourth to one-fifth the rates found for a comparable sample of White women from NHANESII. These findings are discrepant with the little that is known about hypertension prevalence among Hispanics and with estimates of hypertension prevalence for Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans drawn from NHANESII. While our HHANES samples women had much lower rates of clinical high blood pressure than Whites, they reported hypertension histories in excess of Whites. Rates of medicine usage among Hispanics were insufficiently large for effective treatment to explain the disparity. The prevalence estimates increased, but the relative discrepancies remained when we altered our sample specifications and clinical high blood pressure measure. A possible explanation for these discrepancies is that few physicians performed the majority of blood pressure readings in our HHANES sample. This may have been statistically inefficient. The discrepancies noted suggest that HHANES may not be a reliable source of information on hypertension among Hispanic women.\r"

An estimated 45 percent of the population had no servings of fruit or juice and 22 percent had no servings of a vegetable on the recall day. Only 27 percent consumed the three or more servings of vegetables and 29 percent had the two or more servings of fruit recommended by the US Departments of Agriculture and of Health and Human Services; 9 percent had both. Consumption was lower among Blacks than Whites. The choice of vegetables lacked variety. Diets including at least three servings of vegetables and two servings of fruit contained about 17 grams of dietary fiber. Although caloric and fat intake increased with increasing servings of fruit and vegetables, the percent of calories from fat remained relatively constant. Although these data are 10 years old, more recent surveys have shown similar results. The discrepancy between dietary guidelines and the actual diet suggests a need for extensive public education.\r"

The data were obtained from a self-administered 73-item questionnaire that was mailed during spring 1987 to the 1,000 members of a professional executive women's organization with 15 chapters across the United States. Findings suggest that the women in executive positions do not necessarily compromise their health. In comparison with a group of age/gender/education matched working women, the overall wellness and risk assessment scores were remarkably similar. The study group, however, reported greater life satisfaction, stronger social support, and excellent health status; the overwhelming majority was satisfied with their personal and professional lives and believed that they were in control of both. This perception, coupled with the relatively high wellness scores, suggests that on average this group of executives may be in better health than had been predicted as women rose to executive positions within organizations.\r"

In a multivariate model that adjusted for age range, profit status and liberal fecal policy, towel or handkerchief use (OR 5.5, 95% CI: 1.1, 30) was the only variable independently associated with case facilities.

Men (232) and women (150) were injured at comparable rates, 42 percent versus 39 percent. When adjusted for exposure time, seven of the eight sports continued to show similar injury rates. Women gymnasts, however, experienced .82 injuries per 100 person-hours of exposure as compared to .21 injuries for the men (p = .0001). Disability was greater in women gymnasts, 7.44 days per 100 person-hours versus 1.15 days for men (p = .0004). Percent of season lost to injury was also greater for women gymnasts. Types and sites of injury were similar for men and women, with sprains and strains accounting for over half of all injuries. We found no evidence for gender differences in matched sports except for gymnastics, in which technically diverse events may have accounted for the differences observed.\r"

Our findings demonstrate that E-code reporting varies because of the limited number of data fields available for coding of discharge diagnoses. Universal, systematic reporting of E-codes in hospital discharge data is essential if these data are to provide critically needed information about nonfatal injuries. Hospital discharge data formats should contain separate fields for E-codes and the use of these codes, we believe, should be mandated.\r"

We then used diagnoses recorded on claims submitted by medical care providers to identify all accident-related care received by these persons during three months before their first-observed prescription for a benzodiazepine or nonbenzodiazepine agent, respectively, and six months subsequently. We found accident-related care was more likely among persons who had been prescribed benzodiazepines; among these persons, the probability of an accident-related medical encounter was higher during months in which a prescription for a benzodiazepine had recently been filled compared to other months; and persons who had filled three or more prescriptions for these agents in the six months following initiation of therapy had a significantly higher risk of an accident-related medical event than those who had filled only one such prescription. Approximately two-fold risks of accident-related care were found, after controlling for age, sex, and prior utilization.\r"

Using regression analyses to control for age, sex, education and income, accident severity, and cycling experience we found no definite effect of helmets on the risk of serious facial injury (odds ratio 0.81; 95 percent confidence interval = 0.45, 1.5), but protection against serious injuries to the upper face (odds ratio 0.27; 95% CI = 0.1, 0.8). No protection was found against serious injuries to the lower face. The independent effect of helmet use on facial injury was difficult to isolate due to the association of head and facial injuries. Our results suggest that bicycle helmets as presently designed may have some protective effect against serious upper facial injuries.\r"

Serologic data on HBV and HIV-1, cytometric enumeration of CD4+ lymphocytes, clinical events (AIDS by Centers for Disease Control criteria) and hepatitis B vaccination histories were available on 4,498 homosexual participants in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, Men were classified as to previous infection with HBV and prevalent or incident infection with HIV-1. Although there was an association between seropositivity for HBV infection and HIV-1 infection at enrollment (odds ratios anti-HBc 2.6; HBsAg 4.2), the relation between HBV seropositivity and subsequent seroconversion to HIV-1 was weaker (odds ratios 1.3 and 1.6). HIV-1 seroconversion was also associated with a history of certain other sexually transmitted diseases, but predisposing sexual practices did not account for the association between HBV and HIV-1 infection. Seropositivity for HBV infection at entry was not related to initially low or more rapid subsequent decline in T-helper lymphocyte counts and was not associated with an increased incidence of AIDS during 2.5 years of follow-up. History of vaccination against HBV did not appear to decrease susceptibility to HIV-1 infection or to subsequent progression of immunodeficiency. We conclude that prior HBV infection is unlikely to be specifically associated with acquisition of HIV-1 infection and is unrelated to more rapid progression of HIV-1-induced immunodeficiency.\r"

For interventions that reduce the number of smokers by 25 percent in 1990, the number of men free of coronary heart disease is projected to increase by 416,787 (0.7 percent) in 2015, and the age-standardized absolute incidence to decline by 2.3 percent. Incidence rates and absolute incidences are projected to fall in men under age 65, but absolute incidence would rise in men over age 65, in large part because of the increased number of men who were at risk for coronary heart disease because of a reduction in non-coronary smoking-related mortality. These trends were more marked for greater smoking reductions and were generally unaffected in a variety of analyses using alternative assumptions, which considered smoking as a risk factor in the elderly, a lag-time before benefits from smoking cessation were realized and secular declines in smoking prevalence. Subject to the assumptions of our model, we conclude that smoking reductions will markedly reduce coronary heart disease, especially in younger age groups, and that this benefit will be slightly offset by a small increase in absolute incidence in elderly men.\r"

  ".W": "We used Medicare data bases and US Census data to address two questions critical to the use of Medicare files for epidemiologic research. First, we examined the degree to which the population enrolled in the Medicare program is similar to the elderly resident population of the United States, as estimated by the US Census. We found small differences in the total population estimates but substantial differences by age and race. Second, we found that among Medicare enrollees, physician claims identify a small proportion of hip fracture cases which are not documented in the hospital discharge files. This proportion varies by age, region, and state within the United States. Calculation of rates based on Medicare hospital discharge data, and probably other hospital discharge data sets as well, must take these limitations into account. Use of all available Medicare data files can overcome these limitations.\r"

The proportion of patients referred for PT increased from 68 percent pre-PPS to 85 percent post-PPS for those with PT-related diagnoses and from 13 percent pre-PPS to 19 percent post-PPS for those with non-PT-related diagnoses. The mean number of sessions of PT decreased slightly for both groups: from 8.5 to 7.6 sessions for those with PT-related diagnoses and from 5.2 to 4.5 for those with non-PT-related diagnoses. In patients with PT-related diagnoses whose ambulatory status worsened during hospitalization, referrals for PT increased from 76 percent pre-PPS to 98 percent post-PPS. Referrals of comparable patients with non-PT-related diagnoses did not increase. Changes in provider education and efforts to reduce length of stay may account for these findings.\r"

However, survivorship per feeding cycle, individual mosquito vectorial capacity, and mosquito infection probability did not vary significantly. Estimates of these parameters were then compared to estimates of survivorship, individual vectorial capacity, and mosquito infection probability in mosquito populations in other villages in the study area. Since survivorship per feeding cycle did not vary significantly among the mosquito populations in these villages, changes in malaria transmission potential can be better gauged from estimates of survivorship over the length of the extrinsic incubation period. However, as measurements of relative inoculation rates are easier to perform and have been related to parasite prevalences in children in this area, estimates of inoculation rates are a preferred option for estimating malaria transmission in the Madang area of Papua New Guinea.\r"

Rosetting antibodies were found in 15 out of 73 (21%) Liberian sera as measured by disruption of rosettes in vitro. However, antibodies able to inhibit CD36 dependent cytoadherence of P. falciparum-infected RBC were not detected in these sera. Erythrocyte rosetting is a geographically widespread phenomenon.

A clear boosting effect was observed, determined by the increased antibody titers against synthetic peptides S7, S12, S17, and SPf66, and by improvement in the protective immune response against the challenge.

Monkeys were immunized with combinations of the 3 peptides from 2 separate sources (Centers for Disease Control [CDC], Atlanta, GA or Colombia) or with the synthetic polymer. Animals immunized with a combination of the 3 peptides from CDC had higher antibody titers to the 35.1 and 55.1 peptides than to the 83.1 peptide. Monkeys immunized with a combination of the 3 peptides produced in Colombia developed higher levels of antibody to the 55.1 than to the 83.1 and 35.1 peptides. Animals immunized with the polymer produced detectable antibodies to the 55.1 peptide alone. Following challenge with P. falciparum, no differences were observed between the 3 vaccine groups and 2 control groups with respect to the number of animals with parasitemias greater than or equal to 10%. The inconsistency of serologic response to all 3 peptides in these animals contrasted with previous trials performed in Colombia where the monkeys developed high antibody titers against the 3 peptides and were protected against the experimental infection.\r"

All populations were found to be genetically similar with a mean I value for all comparisons of 0.890 +/- 0.067. When DR was included as one of the pair compared, I = 0.811 +/- 0.034. Among comparisons that include EC (excluding EC vs. DR), I = 0.875 +/- 0.026. The mean I for the other comparisons was less than 0.9. The data indicate that the DR population is divergent enough from the others that it can be considered at the subspecies/incipient species level of evolutionary divergence; the EC population is, to a lesser extent, distinct from the others, and the other 5 represent geographic populations of 1 widely distributed species. A diagrammatic representation of the allomorphs among the 72 isolates is included. There were some allomorph/geographical (or local) population relationships noted.\r"

The gene encoding this antigen (7B2) was isolated from an expression library made directly from randomly generated fragments of B. bacilliformis genomic DNA using Bartonella antibodies raised in rabbits and sera of bartonellosis patients. The Bartonella 7B2 gene was expressed in Escherichia coli and the recombinant Bb65 protein was purified by column chromatography. Using polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbits, the antigen was shown to be present in all of 13 B. bacilliformis isolates from different Peruvian regions. Immune electron microscopy demonstrated the probable cytoplasmatic localization of Bb65. When applied to enzyme immunoassays, Bb65 sensitively and specifically bound to IgG antibody of sera of bartonellosis patients, convalescents, and immunes from various Peruvian regions. IgM antibody was not recognized by Bb65, neither was IgG antibody circulating during the first 2 weeks of illness. The amino-terminal amino acid sequence of Bb65 was 53% homologous to the 65 kDa heat shock protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\r"

Ninety-two patients had generalized onchocerciasis, 21 patients suffered from the chronic hyperreactive form of onchocerciasis (sowda), and 7 probands served as controls. Patients were examined by US with linear (7.5 MHz and 5 MHz) and sector (3.5 MHz) scanners. US results were evaluated by examination of extirpated nodules. The US structure of nodules revealed a typical pattern consisting of a homogeneous echogenicity with small echodense particles and a lateral acoustic shadow, and differentiation from lymph nodes, lipoma, or fibroma was achieved. Within the onchocercomata, calcifications or fluid were identified. Regarding the estimation of the worm burden, it is important to note that in 24 patients, additional nodules not previously palpated were found by US. Also, the number of worm centers in palpable conglomerate nodules were determined more exactly by US than by palpation. In 4 of 16 sowda patients, impalpable nodules were found by US. In 13 patients with positive microfilaria counts, no nodules could be detected. The highly characteristic ultrasonographical pattern of onchocercomata may serve as a basis for further US investigations in onchocerciasis.\r"

The fraction I (F1) component of this capsule is specific to Y. pestis and the detection of F1 antibodies is the basis for several serological tests. We report the cloning of the F1 gene and its expression in Escherichia coli using the phagemid vector lambda ZAPII and a F1-specific monoclonal antibody. The recombinant F1 antigen had a molecular weight of 17 kDa, which proved to be identical to that of the F1 antigen produced by Y. pestis. The recombinant cells produced F1 antigen at 37 degrees C but only minimal amounts at 27 degrees C, suggesting that the genetic features affected by temperature in Y. pestis may be operating in the E. coli clone. It is not known if their similar molecular weights reflect the glycosylated nature of both proteins. F1 antigen purified from the E. coli recombinant induced a protective immune response in BALB/c mice challenged with up to 10(5) virulent Y. pestis. The resistance of immunized mice to plague infection correlated with high titers of F1 antibody. The cloned gene expresses an immunogenically competent F1 antigen suitable for use in plague serodiagnostics and vaccine development.\r"

The present study enrolled 317 (21% of the population) Guaymi Indians from Changuinola, the capital of Bocas del Toro province and 333 (70% of the population) from Canquintu, an isolated rural village. Demographic information and family relationships were ascertained and subjects were screened for neurologic diseases. Serum specimens were screened by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HTLV-I/II antibody and positives were confirmed according to U.S. Public Health Service criteria. Twenty-five (8%) Guaymi residing in Changuinola and 7 (2.1%) from Canquintu were confirmed seropositive. In Changuinola, antibody was virtually limited to residents greater than or equal to 15 years of age (24 [16%] of 153) and rates were slightly higher in males than in females; in Canquintu, antibody rates did not increase significantly with age and appeared higher in females than in males. In Changuinola, there was no evidence for household clustering of infection. In contrast, HTLV antibody among Canquintu residents clustered significantly by household. HTLV-associated neurologic disease was not detected in either population. The atypical seroepidemiology observed in both locations might be explained if the virus endemic to the Guaymi differed from HTLV-I previously described in the Caribbean basin and Japan.\r"

  ".W": "The persistence of arboviruses was studied from 1983 to 1988 in mixed agriculture, marsh, riparian, and foothill habitats in Kern County, CA. Western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE) virus was isolated frequently during 1983 from Culex tarsalis and Aedes melanimon and was detected by the seroconversion of sentinel chickens. WEE virus then disappeared, even though vector competence studies during 1984-1986 showed that Cx. tarsalis was able to transmit WEE virus. St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus was detected sporadically in 3 of the 6 years of the study by isolation from Cx. tarsalis and/or by sentinel chicken seroconversion. When mosquito pools were screened for virus in suckling mice, Turlock (TUR) and Hart Park (HP) viruses were isolated from Cx. tarsalis during each summer. Vertical transmission of HP was indicated by the isolation of virus from a pool of male Cx. tarsalis. California encephalitis (CE) virus was isolated repeatedly from host-seeking Ae. melanimon females, males, and adults reared from field-collected immatures, verifying vertical transmission in nature. Horizontal transmission of CE virus among both jackrabbits (Lepus californicus) and desert cottontails (Sylvilagus auduboni) appeared to amplify Ae. melanimon infection rates during the summer of 1985, but elevated herd immunity depressed infection rates during 1986. Thus, CE, HP, and TUR viruses persisted in Kern County, while WEE virus appeared to become extinct and required reintroduction. The sporadic occurrence of SLE virus activity remains unexplained, but its persistence may require both vertical transmission and reintroduction.\r"

There was no difference in RAM drug sensitivity: clinical correlation between 15 isolates tested blindly and 15 with known clinical history (4 did not agree with clinical history in both). Test sensitivity appeared to be limited only by the sensitivity of the Leishmania to SbV and could be detected at 2 micrograms/ml Sb (about 10% of serum drug level). An isolate from a patient with untreated self-healing cutaneous disease was drug resistant. Using RAM, parasite drug sensitivity can be quantified apart from patient physiologic and immunologic variables intrinsic to clinical data. Potency differed a maximum of 100% (weight% Sb:weight% Sb) among drug lots and also between Glucantime and Pentostam. Potency changes between drug lots were not explainable based on Sb content or test-to-test variability. This microtest offers a rapid method for evaluating the drug sensitivity of patient isolates and for determining of the activity of pentavalent antimonials and other candidate anti-leishmanials prior to the initiation of therapy.\r"

Antigenemia was detected in all animals with parasitologically proven infection and was present in jirds with prepatent or occult filariasis. Antigen levels correlated with worm burdens, and progressively declined in drug-cured animals. Treatment with diethylcarbamazine (DEC) triggered a transient increase in serum levels of filarial antigens bearing the epitope recognized by the monoclonal antibody HC 11. All patients with bancroftian filariasis became amicrofilaremic within one week after DEC treatment. Antigenemia levels slowly declined over a period of several months in all but one treated individual. Forty-two months after treatment, progressively rising antigen levels are present in 10 patients. Six of these remain amicrofilaremic; in the other 4, elevated antigenemia levels preceded or were detected at the same time as recurrent parasitemia. Periodic monitoring of antigenemia levels after treatment of patients with lymphatic filariasis can be used to identify individuals who are likely to develop recurrent microfilaremia before the parasites become detectable in blood samples, thereby allowing timely retreatment.\r"

Neither the parents nor the offspring from these matings manifested chronic limb edema. Two matings were conducted with offspring from the microfilaremic female by breeding siblings with the lowest mf and breeding siblings with the highest mf. The high mf siblings produced 4/5 offspring manifesting chronic limb edema (greater than or equal to 7 months duration) and either no mf (in 2 dogs) or less than 100 mf/ml after the repeating infection regimen.

Comparisons of IgG antibody levels, specific for extracts of adult worms, showed no consistent differences between these 2 litters of dogs that could be associated with limb edema or mf when monitored for 16 months; however, the onset of lymph node enlargement was much earlier in the group of dogs manifesting limb edema than in the other litter.\r"

Two hundred forty-seven cases of Chagas' heart disease and 345 seropositive subjects with normal ECG (controls) were selected in a population survey in Goiania, Brazil. Prevalence ratios for exposure variables were estimated for cases in relation to controls and for subgroups of seropositives with selected ECG abnormalities in relation to controls. Increasing age and male sex were consistently and significantly related to an increased risk of ECG abnormalities. HHD was significantly associated with ECG alterations in 3 of the 5 comparison subgroups (any ECG alteration, right bundle branch block, and left anterior hemiblock). No association was found between length of residence in an area endemic, physical activity, and ECG abnormalities. A sample of 529 seronegative subjects were also examined and the interaction between exposure variables and seropositivity was tested to assess whether the associations found were specific for seropositives. Males were at greater risk of any ECG alteration and left anterior hemiblock in relation to females if they were seropositive. An increasing risk of ventricular premature beats with age was clearer for seropositive than for seronegative subjects. Subjects with HHD were at an increased risk of ECG abnormalities and this was greater in those with a positive serological test (P less than 0.05). The findings suggest a possible geographical clustering or a familial aggregation of cases of Chagas' heart disease.\r"

In the controls, no recurrence was observed after a post-therapy period averaging 3.5 years. In contrast, recurrence occurred in 7/19 patients (37%) with non-resectable alveolar echinococcosis an average of 1.6 years after discontinuation of the long-term mebendazole therapy. The absence of clinically detectable recurrence in the remaining 12 patients seems to be due either to spontaneous inactivation of alveolar echinococcosis preceding chemotherapy or too short post-therapy surveillance. The patients with recurrence responded favorably to reintroduction of chemotherapy. The data indicate that mebendazole therapy is parasitostatic rather than parasiticidal.\r"

Personnel were serologically screened for antibody to both the hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) and the surface antigen to the hepatitis B virus (anti-HBs) prior to departure, periodically during service abroad, and upon completion of their African tour. Rates of seroconversion were used as measures of the incidence of infection. Prior to service, 16% of the staff had anti-HAV and 3% had anti-HBs; post-service rates were 42% and 26%, respectively. Over 90% of the staff with greater than 20 years of service were seropositive for anti-HAV. For both viruses, the infection rate was highest during the first 1-2 years of service, when 28% of those susceptible to HAV and 11% of those susceptible to HBV became infected. Over the next decade, the median annual attack rate was 5.4% for HAV and 4.2% for HBV. Differences in the missionary HBV infection rate among the various African nations served tended to reflect differences in the magnitude of chronic HBV carriage among indigenous population groups. We conclude that missionaries to sub-Saharan Africa are at enhanced risk of both HAV and HBV infection, and that all should receive passive immunization with immune globulin and active immunization with hepatitis B vaccine.\r"

Temperatures tested included 10 degrees C, 17 degrees C, 24 degrees C, and a cyclic (10-24 degrees C, mean = 17 degrees C) regimen designed to mimic typical hourly temperatures in an area endemic for Ockelbo disease in Sweden during the transmission season. The vector competence of both the Uppsala and the El Gabal strains of Cx. pipiens was directly related to environmental temperature. Mosquitoes held at 10 degrees C had a reduced ability to transmit virus as compared to those held at 17 degrees C, 24 degrees C, or in the cyclic temperature regimen. A rapid increase in dissemination rates was observed in mosquitoes exposed to a shift in temperature from 10 degrees C to 24 degrees C. After 4 days at 24 degrees C, these mosquitoes had vector competence similar to those held at 24 degrees C for the entire incubation time. In contrast, virus dissemination in Cx. torrentium was rapid at all temperatures tested and appeared unaffected by environmental temperature; infection and dissemination rates were consistently higher in Cx. torrentium than in either the Uppsala or the El Gabal strains of Cx. pipiens. It seems the transmission of Ockelbo virus by Cx. pipiens might be interrupted by a prolonged period of cold weather, while transmission by Cx. torrentium would continue.\r"

Temperatures tested were 10 degrees C, 17 degrees C, 24 degrees C, and a cyclic (10-24 degrees C, mean = 17 degrees C) regimen designed to mimic continuously temperatures to which a mosquito might be exposed in July and August in central Sweden. Both species were highly susceptible to oral infection, with no consistent association between incubation temperature and infection rates. However, dissemination of OCK virus to the hemocoel in infected mosquitoes was directly related both to the dose of virus ingested and to the extrinsic incubation temperature. After greater than or equal to 14 days extrinsic incubation, once a disseminated infection was achieved, transmission by bite to a susceptible chick did not appear to be affected by either the initial dose ingested, the holding temperatures of 17 degrees C, 24 degrees C, nor the cyclic regimen. When re-fed, 93% (68/73) and 82% (67/82) of the disseminated Ae. taeniorhynchus and Ae. aegypti, respectively, transmitted virus. In contrast, when mosquitoes were held at 10 degrees C, fewer disseminated Ae. taeniorhynchus (0/5) and Ae. aegypti (2/6) transmitted virus. There were no significant differences in infection, dissemination, or transmission rates for Ae. taeniorhynchus held at the cyclic temperature regimen vs. those held at a constant 17 degrees C. Environmental temperature affected the vectorial capacity of Ae. aegypti and Ae. taeniorhynchus for OCK virus, with transmission occurring earlier and at a higher rate in mosquitoes held at higher temperatures.\r"

First instar larvae were provided access either to 3 or to 5 mg of food, and lots from each food regimen were inoculated with 20, 40, 60, or 80 micrograms of fungal spores/ml water. Application of the fungus to well-nourished larvae reduced the proportion developing to the adult stage, and increased the size of those adults that developed; their survival was not affected. In the case of malnourished larvae, such applications appeared not to effect the proportion of larvae that matured, and, paradoxically, increased the size and longevity of these resulting adults. By destroying a portion of the larvae, the pathogen apparently reduced competition among malnourished larvae, thereby enhancing their survival, as well as the size of the resulting adults. Thus, biocontrol agents may fail when used as larvicides against such nutrient-deprived mosquitoes as frequently occur in nature.\r"

The major purpose of the present study was to validate these criteria and design a corresponding algorithm for clinical use. All patients admitted to a trauma intensive care unit and receiving an aminoglycosides was also studied. All patients studied over a 7-month period. A control group not receiving aminoglycosides was also studied. All patients were evaluated for the presence of renal dysfunction (i.e., serum creatinine increase greater than or equal to 0.5 mg/dL). Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were used to compare potential associated risk factors. The overall renal dysfunction incidence was 10% in the treatment patients (n = 93) versus 5% in the control patients (n = 199) (p = 0.13). Sensitivity and specificity of the screening criteria were 67% and 92%, respectively. The predictive values of a positive and negative test relative to correctly labeling patients at high risk or low risk to develop renal dysfunction were 46% and 96%, respectively. Major risk factors associated with renal dysfunction in the treatment group were post-admission shock, minimum serum concentration more than 2 mg/L, and liver dysfunction. Use of three major risk factors has excellent predictive value in identifying severely traumatized patients at low risk for developing renal dysfunction while receiving aminoglycosides. The modest predictive value of a positive test results in conservative management of patients by avoidance of aminoglycosides, i.e., use of alternative antimicrobial agents.\r"

This increase in viscosity, which is mainly due to elevated fibrinogen levels and a decreased red cell deformability, adversely influences blood flow. In addition to a positive effect on blood pressure, blood lipids, and platelet responsiveness, fish oil may improve blood flow due to a favorable influence on hemorrheology. In a prospective, randomized, double-blind study, we evaluated the effect of six capsules of fish oil (1.8 g eicosapentaenoic acid and 1.2 g docosahexaenoic acid) versus six capsules of corn oil (3 g linoleic acid), administered for 4 months, on walking distances, pressure indices during rest and after exercise, blood pressure, red cell deformability, fibrinogen, and lipid levels in 32 patients with stable claudication. No significant changes in walking distances and pressure indices during rest and after exercise occurred, despite a significant increase in red cell deformability in the fish oil group. Fibrinogen levels did not change in either group. In the fish oil group, a favorable change in blood lipids was noted; high-density cholesterol increased and triglycerides decreased. Mean arterial blood pressure declined to a similar extent in both groups. Thus, short-term supplementation with fish oil does not lead to clinically significant improvement of symptoms in patients with stable claudication. This suggests that red cell deformability is of minor importance in the arterial blood flow in the legs of these patients.\r"

A protocol for anticoagulant therapy monitored and regulated by a vascular nurse-clinician was reviewed. Coumadin was prescribed for 1,891 patient-months to 93 patients to maintain their prothrombin time 1.5 to 2 times control (range: 18 to 24 seconds). The mean (+/- SD) prothrombin time for the study population was 19.8 +/- 1.8 seconds. During follow-up, 472 (14%) of 3,479 prothrombin times measured were below the therapeutic range (n = 232) or prolonged (n = 240), prompting an adjustment in the Coumadin dose in 82 (88%) patients. Four patients developed recurrent vascular graft thrombosis while receiving anticoagulation. There were 6 major and 11 minor hemorrhagic complications. Patients with a chronic risk for arterial or venous thrombosis can have out-patient anticoagulant therapy administered at optimal intensity and regulated safely with a low incidence of hemorrhagic and thrombotic events.\r"

The left spermatic artery and veins of 22 adult Wistar albino rats were divided while preserving the vessels associated with the vas and cremaster muscle (DT). A sham operation was performed on the left testicle of six additional rats (ST). At 3 weeks postoperatively, both testes from all rats were removed. All testes were viable and bled when incised, although bleeding was considerably reduced in testes with DT. Mean testicular weights after DT were 1,061 +/- 423 mg compared with 1,634 +/- 125 mg for ST rats (p less than 0.02) and 1,508 +/- 119 mg for contralateral testes. The mean tubular diameter after DT was 220 +/- 37 mu compared with 303.1 +/- 10.7 mu for ST testes (p less than 0.02). The testicular biopsy score based upon the morphology of the spermatic tubules was 4.46 +/- 3.32 for DT testes and 8.65 +/- 0.23 for ST testes (p less than 0.02) compared with 8.38 +/- 0.18 for contralateral testes and an absolute normal value of 10. No morphologic abnormalities were observed in the contralateral unoperated testes from any of the rats. The contralateral testes in 12 additional rats were removed before DT. The mean testosterone values in these rats with one testicle was 1.43 +/- 0.75 ng/mL. Three weeks after DT, testosterone values were 0.19 +/- 0.31 ng/mL (p less than 0.01). It is concluded that division of the main spermatic artery and vein in rats produces testicular atrophy with spermatogenic arrest and interstitial cell dysfunction. Although collateral blood flow to the testis may be demonstrated, tissue perfusion is inadequate for normal spermatogenesis and endocrine function.\r"

Identification of correctable variables to improve survival is complicated by the interplay of this pathophysiology. Temperature may be an under-appreciated problem in the genesis of coagulopathy. In vitro studies have demonstrated that platelet function and vascular response are critically temperature-dependent. We reviewed the records of 45 trauma patients without head injury or co-morbid medical illness who required massive transfusions. The mean Injury Severity Score was 55 +/- 6, a mean of 22.5 +/- 5 units of blood was transfused, and mortality was 33%. Nonsurvivors were more likely to have had penetrating injury (88% versus 55%), received more transfusions (26.5 +/- 9 versus 18.6 +/- 1, p less than 0.05), had lower pH (pH 7.04 +/- 0.06 versus 7.18 +/- 0.02, p less than 0.05), had lower core temperature (31 +/- 1 degree C versus 34 +/- 1 degree C, p less than 0.01), and had a higher incidence of clinical coagulopathy (73% versus 23%). Severe hypothermia (temperature less than 34 degrees C) occurred in 80% of the nonsurvivors and in 36% of survivors. Patients who were hypothermic and acidotic developed clinically significant bleeding despite adequate blood, plasma, and platelet replacement. Avoidance or correction of hypothermia may be critical in preventing or correcting coagulopathy in the patient receiving massive transfusion.\r"

Hyperbaric oxygen demonstrated an eight- to ninefold increased vascular density over both normobaric oxygen and air-breathing controls (p = 0.001). Irradiated tissue develops a hypovascular-hypocellular-hypoxic tissue that does not revascularize spontaneously. Results failed to demonstrate an angiogenic effect of normobaric oxygen.

Of a total of 208 patients studied between 1978 and 1987, the intercostobrachial nerve was sectioned in 139 patients, whereas in 30 it remained intact; in 39 patients only peripheral branches of the nerve were sectioned. The patients were examined at regular postoperative intervals in order to evaluate their sensitivity both to touch and to pain in the axilla and arm. Four hundred thirty-three examinations were carried out and the 3 operative groups were assessed accordingly. After the nerve was sectioned, there was increasing anesthesia in the armpit and hypoesthesia on the posterointernal face of the arm, while for the patients in whom the intercostobrachial nerve remained intact, these alterations were less intense and long-lasting. Significant statistical differences between the two groups also exist. In the absence of axillary lymphatic ganglia infiltrated by the tumor, the conservation of the intercostobrachial nerve is recommended.\r"

Nevertheless, the disease may progress to a fulminant toxic colitis or colonic perforation. Additionally, another subset of patients will present with a dramatic clinical picture, suggesting acute peritonitis, eventuating in unnecessary laparotomy. This report reviews both the medical and surgical literature during the past 15 years of patients treated for pseudomembranous colitis. Analysis of this clinical data has provided us with the opportunity to both define the role of surgery in this disorder and illustrate the necessity for a combined medical and surgical cooperative approach in the early management of this iatrogenic disease.\r"

Four groups of 20 patients each were pretreated with saline (group 1), tubocurarine 0.05 mg/kg (group 2), vecuronium 0.006 mg/kg (group 3), or midazolam 0.025 mg/kg (group 4), followed by suxamethonium 1.5 mg/kg. Group 5 received only vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg as relaxant (no suxamethonium). Fasciculations were graded, and postoperative myalgias rated on the first and third postoperative days. In groups 1-5 the incidence of fasciculations was 95, 15, 25, 95 and 0%; the incidence of myalgias on the first day after operation was 70, 45, 65, 75 and 60%, and on the third day after operation 20, 5, 20, 20, and 5%, respectively. We conclude that pretreatment with vecuronium, but not midazolam, decreases the incidence of fasciculations after suxamethonium (p less than 0.05) and that in this patient population, postoperative myalgias appear to be unrelated to the use of suxamethonium.\r"

A probability for malignant hyperthermia can be calculated, using the classification, for each type of clinical presentation; this varied from 0.96 to 0.07.

Major decreases in the oxygen concentration in the system are unlikely even if the fresh gas flow is interrupted or significant leaks from the circle occur because 100% oxygen is delivered by the ventilator. A hose volume larger than 1650 ml prevented gas mixing at tidal volumes of 380-1170 ml. There was no system-related mishap in over 600 patients, who comprised about 40% of the neurosurgical patients anaesthetised during that period.

The court found that phenol, which was used to sterilise the outside of the ampoules of local anaesthetic, had percolated the glass through invisible cracks, contaminating the solution, but that the anaesthetist could not have been aware of this risk. The case was important, despite the fact that judgement was in favour of the anaesthetist, because of the fears that it generated over the incidence of paralysis after spinal anaesthesia. The 'invisible crack' theory has been the subject of much scepticism. New information has been obtained, and the case re-examined objectively. The most probable source of contamination, which led to paralysis in the two patients, and in a third who received spinal anaesthesia on the same day, has been identified. A similar explanation may lie behind a number of other episodes of paralysis associated with spinal anaesthesia.\r"

Recovery after midazolam was significantly longer (p less than 0.05) than with either thiopentone or propofol. There was no difference in the recovery times between thiopentone and propofol. There was a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure 2 minutes after induction with propofol and midazolam. Three patients each in the thiopentone and propofol groups needed assisted ventilation because of apneoea, and four patients each in the propofol and midazolam groups had low Spo2 values (less than 95%). Flumazenil was used to reverse the effects of midazolam in eight patients and five of these were still drowsy 4 hours after the procedure. This study indicates that thiopentone is the most satisfactory agent for anaesthesia for cardioversion.\r"

Tracheal mucosa was inspected fibreoptically after the insertion of a minitracheotomy cannula, and then at 3-day intervals until the cannula was removed. Thereafter, assessments were made every third day until the mucosa was considered normal. Three significant complications occurred: mediastinal puncture, paratracheal entrance of the cannula and subcutaneous emphysema. Difficulties at insertion of the minitracheotomy cannula were encountered in 15 of 28 patients (54%). Air flow detected through the cannula in one patient, and lack of air flow in another patient, were misleading signs of the position of the cannula. Passing a suction catheter in three patients and a normal end-tidal carbon dioxide tracing in one patient, were also found to be misleading. The correct position and possible complications could be verified only by fibreoptic tracheoscopy. Changes in the tracheal mucosa were independent of the duration of minitracheotomy therapy.\r"

Group B (n = 15) received cimetidine 200 mg orally the night before the surgery and 400 mg orally 60 minutes before the anaesthetic induction. Group C (n = 20) received neither famotidine nor cimetidine and served as controls. Twelve millilitres of 2.0% lignocaine with adrenaline 1:200,000 was injected into the epidural space in all patients, after the establishment of general anaesthesia with nitrous oxide, oxygen, and enflurane (0.3-0.5%). The patients who received cimetidine showed significantly higher plasma concentrations of lignocaine compared with either group A or group C at all investigation times (p less than 0.01). The mean peak plasma concentrations were 2.4 (SEM 0.1), 3.2 (SEM 0.2) and 2.3 (SEM 0.1) micrograms/ml in group A, B, and C, respectively. This study suggests that famotidine is preferable to cimetidine for control of gastric acidity before the use of lignocaine as the epidural anaesthetic.\r"

This paper describes the cardiovascular and metabolic changes that occurred in nine consecutive such patients. No severe haemodynamic or pulmonary complications occurred. Specific problems were encountered during the prolonged anhepatic period, which lasted an average of 5.96 (SD 1.46) hours. Significant metabolic and coagulation disorders occurred 2 to 3 hours after hepatectomy because of complete loss of hepatic function. The predominant findings during the anhepatic period were hypoglycaemia and severe metabolic acidosis, mainly from increased levels of lactic acid. Exogenous administration of dextrose 5% at an average rate of 188 ml/hour was necessary to maintain normoglycaemia, while correction of metabolic acidosis required 403 (SD 159.79) mmol of sodium bicarbonate, supplemented by hyperventilation. Tris-hydroxymethylaminomethane was used when sodium overload was thought to be a problem. There was a marked decrease of Factor V and fibrinogen, a moderate thrombocytopenia and fibrinolysis. The severity of these alterations was dependent on the duration of the anhepatic period and the primary function of the re-implanted liver.\r"

At flows below 1000 ml/minute, each machine delivered 20% more than the indicated value; at higher flows, the indicated value was within 10% of the flow delivered. Minute volume, tidal volumes and oxygen concentrations were within the manufacturer's specifications. However, vaporizer and vapour monitor performance was outside the (SD) 5% accuracy claimed by the manufacturers. It was noted that the bistable valve requires user familiarity for the change from controlled to spontaneous ventilation to be accomplished with ease. It was also possible to misconnect the breathing system and so isolate the excess pressure escape valve and high-pressure alarm. Nevertheless, once familiarisation was achieved, the machines have proved easy to operate and are particularly satisfactory when used with low fresh gas flows.\r"

The resistance to flow through the needle was measured using a pressure monitor infusion pump and compared with the resistance to flow through a 90-mm 26-gauge needle; there was a threefold increase in resistance in the 120-mm needle compared to the 90-mm needle, which could not be explained by the difference in length alone and must reflect a decrease in the internal diameter of the long needle. This results in difficulty in identifying the subarachnoid space by backflow of cerebrospinal fluid.\r"

The test drug was administered before operation in an attempt to alleviate postoperative pain. A 10-cm visual analogue scale was used to assess pain at 30 minutes and one day after surgery, if the patients stayed overnight. Patients who received intravenous diclofenac had significantly less pain than the other groups 30 minutes after operation. They also had significantly less pain one day after surgery than the placebo or opioid groups, but not less than the intramuscular diclofenac group. Capillary bleeding time, in comparison with placebo, was significantly prolonged after the use of intramuscular diclofenac, and a similar but nonsignificant trend was observed in the intravenous diclofenac group. No problems were encountered with excessive bleeding in any group.\r"

The effect of the presence or absence of a laryngoscope on successful tube placement was also assessed. A grade 3 difficult intubation was simulated in patients with a laryngoscope. There was a significant difference in the rates for successful first-time intubation in those patients with tube orientation of -90 degrees (with the bevel facing posteriorly) as compared with a tube orientation of 0 degrees (the normal orientation with the bevel facing left). The unsuccessful first-time intubations with a 0 degree orientation were frequently converted to successful intubations with the -90 degrees position at a second attempt. The presence of a laryngoscope in the mouth while rail-roading a tube over the bougie also made a significant difference to the rate of successful first-time intubations. The most successful method was to leave the laryngoscope in the mouth and rotate the tube to -90 degrees.\r"
