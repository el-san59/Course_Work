All children in California's state developmental centers are severely to profoundly mentally retarded and chronically disabled, and many have serious health problems. Of the 865 children in 5 developmental centers, 441 (51%) resided in acute and skilled nursing care units and were technology dependent (Office of Technology Assessment classification). We suspect that our findings (ethical and quality-of-care issues, staffing, licensing mandates, cost-of-care considerations) reflect the rapidly expanding population of children with special health care needs and may be important in planning for services in other states as well as in California.\r"

Because of their age, lack of personality development, dependent family role, immaturity, and acting out of age-related behavioral tendencies, however, symptoms specific to this population occur. These may become exacerbated and telescope--intensify and shorten--the progression of the disease. A plan to solve the problem of adolescent chemical dependence must focus on education, demonstration, cooperation, prevention, intervention, habilitation, treatment, and recovery. The phenomenon of denial in a chemically dependent adolescent yields a more complex delusional system that dictates age-specific intervention approaches. Habilitation is necessary for successful adolescent treatment and recovery because what is needed is an initial process of learning, not relearning or rehabilitation. If specific adolescent issues are addressed through comprehensive, multimodality treatment approaches, then treatment and recovery outcomes for chemically dependent adolescents and their families are substantially improved. Primary care physicians must be alert to the possibility of drug use in their young patients and aware of treatment options.\r"

There are compelling medical reasons for identifying and intervening with pregnant women who are addicted or have alcoholism. The teratogenicity of all drugs of abuse and alcohol, the risk of infection with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and the potential for full recovery of a pregnant woman from addiction are some of the reasons that identification and intervention in the problem are indicated. Whether encountered in the clinic setting or in private practice, chemically dependent pregnant or postpartum women are usually responsive to appropriate physician interventions that include a detailed and caring confrontation- and advocacy-oriented support. Complex legal and ethical issues surround perinatal addiction including the role of toxicologic screening, reports to child welfare services, issues in noncompliance, and interdisciplinary case management.\r"

The first, and most widely applicable, is gradually reducing the dose without adding any other medicine. Failing this, use one of the following two approaches, occasionally combining them: switch to a longer-acting, cross-tolerant medication (usually clonazepam or phenobarbital) or use medications to suppress the withdrawal symptoms, usually carbamazepine, propranolol, or clonidine. If this fails, use inpatient detoxification. Chemically dependent patients, including those abusing alcohol and taking higher than recommended doses of sedative-hypnotics, require special care during discontinuation. Aftercare is important for all long-term benzodiazepine users if they are to remain drug-free and live relatively comfortable lives.\r"

Severe withdrawal reactions and adverse consequences with use were reported in the literature. In this review of 30 cases of alprazolam dependence and subsequent withdrawal, there was a statistically significant increase in the number of patient hospital days, the subjective symptoms, and staff time spent with patients compared with those in alcoholic controls. Most patients with diagnosed alprazolam dependence used doses in the range recommended by the package information at the time of admission. Patients with low preadmission doses of 1 mg or less per day showed notable withdrawal symptoms. The average duration of use was 29.9 months, considerably longer than suggested effective ranges. Most patients (28) had a chemical dependence history before being placed on alprazolam therapy; 24 had a positive family history of chemical dependence; and 24 had previous or current psychiatric care.\r"

Even physicians who do not meet any of these descriptions must guard against contributing to prescription drug abuse through injudicious prescribing, inadequate safeguarding of prescription forms or drug supplies, or acquiescing to the demands or ruses used to obtain drugs for other than medical purposes.\r"

One result has been a classification of misprescribing physicians that blames physicians for prescription drug abuse. The conceptualization and public policy response to prescription drug abuse have been largely shaped by the emotional response to the epidemic of crack cocaine and other nonprescription drug abuse. A new perspective is needed--one that accommodates the evolving role of physicians in society, the life-style choices that physicians enable in their patients, and the respective responsibilities of both physicians and patients in physician-patient transactions.\r"

The effects of a single dose (acute test) were compared with those following an 8-day (chronic) regimen of mononitrate administration. Two hours after administration of 50-mg sustained-release IS-5-N, mean resting pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), measured with a Swan-Ganz catheter, was reduced by 27% (p less than 0.01), and at submaximal exercise level (50 W, 3 minutes) by 34% (p less than 0.001). At individually highest comparable work loads mean PAP was reduced by 28% (p less than 0.01), and at maximal work load the PAP reduction was 21% (p less than 0.05). At the end of 1 week of therapy with sustained-release IS-5-N a slight, clinically irrelevant reduction of hemodynamic effects was recorded. Work capacity increased after 1 hour by 60% (408 +/- 104 vs 653 +/- 147 W x min, p less than 0.001)--still significantly above baseline 10 hours after nitrate administration. No difference from baseline was demonstrable 24 hours after medication. During interval therapy the improved work capacity was fully maintained (chronic, 1 hour: 417 +/- 93 vs 679 +/- 160 W x min, p less than 0.001). During interval therapy with sustained-release IS-5-N, hemodynamics and exercise tolerance were durably improved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Atrial pacing to ischemia (ST-segment depression of greater than or equal to 1.5 mm for greater than or equal to 80 ms) resulted in elevation of CK-MB levels in plasma drawn from the coronary sinus, from 1.8 +/- 1.5 to 6.8 +/- 7.0 ng/ml (p less than 0.001) at 30 minutes after onset of ischemia. When atrial pacing was repeated at the same rate after 1 squirt of ISDN spray, 1.25 mg, the CK-MB levels were not altered despite significant ischemic ST-segment depression. It is concluded that ISDN prevents the process responsible for myocardial release of CK-MB, being either micronecroses or a reversible consequence of ischemia.\r"

It is not known whether fish-oil supplementation is able to support normal accretion of fatty acids with greater than or equal to 20 carbons (LCPs) in the brain. Therefore piglets were fed exclusively F + O, F, or sow milk (SM) for 15 d and their liver and brain synaptosomal fatty acids were determined. Feeding F + O corrected the low n-3 LCP in the liver phospholipid (PL) and synaptosomal phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) of piglets fed F compared with SM. An apparent compensatory increase in n-6 LCPs in liver PL and synaptosomal PE of piglets fed F compared with SM was suppressed by feeding F + O. F + O also reduced the ratio of plasma PL 20:4n-6 to 20:5n-3, important for eicosanoid metabolism. Supplementation of F with n-3 LCPs as fish oil, without n-6 LCPs, at levels giving normal brain n-3 LCP, may alter n-6 LCP accretion.\r"

Biliary molar lipid percentages were unaffected but deoxycholic acid was increased and chenodeoxycholic acid was decreased by the high-fiber diet. The high-fiber diet changed cholesterol absorption and fecal output of neutral and total sterols nonsignificantly but increased fecal bile acids by 13% (p less than 0.05) and reduced bacterial conversion of fecal sterols to secondary products. The decreased serum cholesterol concentration was probably caused by enhanced fecal output of cholesterol as bile acids resulting in enhanced cholesterol synthesis as indicated by an increased serum concentration of a cholesterol precursor, lathosterol.\r"

All bean diets combined lowered serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations 10.4% (p less than 0.001) and 10.8% (p less than 0.025), respectively. Diet B was as effective as diet C, and the groups on those diets had greater cholesterol reductions than did the group on diet A. Serum cholesterol reduction was positively correlated (p less than 0.01) with intake of total dietary fiber and soluble fiber. The ratios of low- to high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol remained constant for all groups. Body weight decreased 1.0-1.5 kg for all groups despite constant energy intakes.

Postabsorptive control samples were obtained from 8 elderly and 10 young volunteers. The results were analyzed for age-related responses to major trauma. Older healthy control subjects showed a decrease in total amino acids, essential amino acids, proline, histidine, taurine, and cystine. The hypoaminoacidemia was less pronounced in geriatric trauma, mainly because of a larger decrease in nonessential amino acids in young trauma victims. Significant decreases in arginine and methionine and increases in ornithine and citrulline concentrations were seen in geriatric trauma. These results suggest a sluggish protein metabolic response to trauma in elderly individuals, which should be considered in their nutritional management.\r"

Isomolar replacement of isoleucine produced anorexia, stunting, and poor nitrogen balance. Doubling KMVA partially improved these indices. Tripling KMVA lessened urea production and improved growth up to that obtained with the isoleucine diet in uremic but not in control rats (20% lower). A further KMVA increase produced no further benefit. Among plasma branched-chain amino acids, only alloisoleucine was affected; it increased with increasing KMVA concentration, being maximum after tripling KMVA. Racemic KMVA could replace isoleucine with a 35% efficiency but supported no growth acceleration in uremic rats and no maximal growth in control rats. Plasma alloisoleucine rose without adverse nutrition effects.\r"

Two hundred eighty-six healthy, sedentary male workers from a middle-income group were investigated. There were 159 smokers, 59 exsmokers, and 68 nonsmokers. Plasma PLP and PL concentrations were significantly lower in smokers than in the nonsmokers and exsmokers whereas erythrocyte PLP and PL did not differ significantly between groups. Because PLP mainly functions as an intracellular coenzyme, the clinical significance of a depressed plasma PLP concentration alone is uncertain. It is concluded that circulating plasma PLP is labile and not necessarily indicative of intracellular PLP concentrations. The measurement of erythrocyte PLP and/or PL may be more informative about vitamin B-6 status than is plasma PLP alone.\r"

In 27 of 70 Egyptian village women studied, vitamin B-6 concentration of their milk was considered indicative of poor maternal vitamin B-6 nutriture. Neonatal behavior, quantified by the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale, showed that consolability, appropriate build-up to a crying state, and response to aversive stimuli were significantly correlated with maternal vitamin B-6 nutriture. Naturalistic observational procedures, used twice monthly with infants aged 3-6 mo, indicated that mothers assessed as having marginal vitamin B-6 status were less responsive to their infants' vocalizations, showed less effective intervention to infant distress, and were more likely to use older siblings as care-givers than were mothers of better vitamin status. We conclude that vitamin B-6 was a factor influencing both the behavior of the mother and her infant.\r"

Increase in plasma HPR was accompanied by an even higher increase in the metabolite N-(4-methoxyphenyl)-all-trans-retinamide (MPR). The administration of HPR was associated with a significant reduction in retinol-binding protein (RBP), which returned to pretreatment values after the drug treatment was discontinued. Reduction of plasma retinol was also observed. Use of interrupted schedules with resting periods of 3 and 7 d changed HPR, MPR, and RBP concentrations in plasma.

Fifteen control subjects were studied after respiratory illness. Fecal copper was not affected by supplementation; fecal zinc during period 2 rose significantly only in the copper-supplemented group. Copper retention was significantly higher in the supplemented infants; plasma concentrations increased for period 2 but were similar to those in the placebo group. Zinc concentrations improved over time in both groups but zinc retention was higher in the placebo group for period 2. A significant interference by copper supplementation on zinc absorption was noted. Copper supplementation during the early phase of recovery from diarrhea is not recommended.\r"

Erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity increased (p less than 0.01) after training. The findings indicate that copper, iron, and zinc nutriture is not adversely affected by physical training when dietary intakes are adequate, and that increases in red blood cell SOD activity without an increase in dietary copper are a functional adaptation of copper metabolism to aerobic training.\r"

Self-reported weight was highly correlated over time, decreasing from r = 0.95 over 2 y to r = 0.89 over 8 y. Weight gain was inversely related to age (r = -0.06). Weight change in a given 2-y interval was inversely related to change in weight over the subsequent 2 y (r = -0.30). Age, relative weight, and prior weight change were stronger predictors of recent weight change than were intake patterns of specific nutrients. Recent prior weight change was the strongest predictor of subsequent weight change. In a population of free-living women, prior weight loss and younger age are far stronger predictors of subsequent weight gain than are the qualitative aspects of diet.\r"

The precision errors (1 SD) for total body BMD, percent fat in soft tissue (% Fat), fat mass, and lean tissue mass were less than 0.01 g/cm2, 1.4%, 1.0 kg, and 0.8 kg, respectively. These results corresponded to a relative error of 0.8% for total body BMD and 1.5% for lean body mass. Regional BMD and soft-tissue values (arms, legs, trunk) were determined with slightly higher precision errors. Skeletal mineral was 5.8 +/- 0.5% of lean tissue mass (r = 0.96, p less than 0.001). DEXA provides precise composition analysis with a low radiation exposure (less than 0.1 microGy).\r"

The method is based on an inversion recovery experiment (repetition time 820 ms, inversion delay time 300 ms, and echo time 20 ms). Total-fat areas and subcutaneous-fat areas were calculated by this method and by computed tomography (CT) from abdominal scans taken in seven male volunteers. The SEE ranged from 4.4 cm2 (CV 4.4%) for subcutaneous-fat areas to 8.3 cm2 (CV 12.8%) for visceral-fat areas. The reproducibility of measuring fat areas with MRI was assessed in seven other volunteers (four males, three females). The average errors of the method for different fat areas were 5.4%, 10.6%, and 10.1% for total-, visceral-, and subcutaneous-fat areas, respectively. We conclude that CT and MRI may yield different absolute values of fat areas (especially visceral fat) but that the ranking of individuals on the basis of their fat areas will be similar by both methods.\r"

Relative to when no soda was given, drinking APM-sweetened soda for 3 wk significantly reduced calorie intake of both females (n = 9) and males (n = 21) and decreased the body weight of males but not of females. However, drinking HFCS-sweetened soda for 3 wk significantly increased the calorie intake and body weight of both sexes. Ingesting either type of soda reduced intake of sugar from the diet without affecting intake of other nutrients. Drinking large volumes of APM-sweetened soda, in contrast to drinking HFCS-sweetened soda, reduces sugar intake and thus may facilitate the control of calorie intake and body weight.\r"

Fat-cell size decreased but fat-cell number did not. Upon refeeding, body fat was only partly restored, with further increase in adipocyte hyperplasia occurring in the starved obese rats. In contrast, fat-cell size was restored to near that of the prefasting value in the starved controls (dry-food-fed, fasted 4 d) after refeeding. With refeeding, food efficiency increased only if starvation had caused a reduction of adipocyte size below normal. Change in food efficiency was not associated with decreases in total carcass protein, specific tissue proteins, or glycogen stores but was correlated with degree of adipocyte filling. It is possible that adipose tissue status somehow modulates energy-dissipating mechanisms.\r"

Animals were killed at birth or on days 5, 10, 15, or 25 postpartum. Plasma cholesterol concentrations were higher in SM-fed than in IF-fed piglets on days 15 and 25. In intestine both HMG-CoA reductase activity and 3H2O incorporation rates into cholesterol were similar for both groups or reduced in the IF-fed group at days 15 and 25. In liver, HMG-CoA reductase activity was higher in IF-fed than in SM-fed piglets on days 5, 10, and 15. Results indicate that during the early postpartum period, response to lower cholesterol intakes with IF occurs by increasing hepatic sterol synthesis whereas intestinal synthesis is largely unaffected.\r"

Bombesin concentration in breast milk was threefold greater than concurrent plasma concentration (p less than 0.001); all other neuropeptides were at the same or lower concentrations in milk than in plasma. At 36 wk gestation plasma concentrations of GIP were lower and concentrations of vasoactive intestinal peptide were higher than concentrations in age-matched control subjects. Concentrations of gastrin and cholecystokinin, bombesin, peptide histidine methionine, peptide YY, and neurotensin in plasma were similar in pregnant and nonpregnant women.

  ".W": "Inheritance of a single base mutation in the type III procollagen gene (COL3A1) was studied in a family with aortic aneurysms and easy bruisability. The mutation was a substitution of A for G+ 1 of intron 20 of the gene and caused aberrant splicing of RNA transcribed from the mutated allele. The phenotype in the family included aortic aneurysms that ruptured and produced death. It also included easy bruisability, but it did not include other characteristic features of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV, such as ecchymoses, abnormal scarring, or prominent subcutaneous blood vessels. The data from the family, together with a review of other probands with mutations in the type III procollagen gene, indicated that there is phenotypic overlap between Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV and familial arterial aneurysms not associated with any overlap between Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV and familial arterial aneurysms not associated with any of the striking changes in skin originally cited as a characteristic feature of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV. In addition, the results suggested that DNA tests for mutations in the type III procollagen gene may be useful to identify individuals predisposed to developing arterial aneurysms.\r"

The frequencies of DNASE1 *1, DNASE1 *2, DNASE1 *3, and DNASE1 *4 calculated in a Japanese population were .5517, .4358, .0104, and .0021, respectively.

Amino acid sequencing of protein isolated from the amyloid fibrils of a patient with SSA identified TTR containing a position - 122 isoleucine-for-valine substitution. This change led to the prediction of a genomic G-to-A transition, destroying an MaeIII restriction site. We confirmed the presence of the variant DNA fragment both by Southern blotting and by visualization of MaeIII digests of DNA amplified around codon 122, by using the polymerase chain reaction. The patient's DNA was entirely resistant to MaeIII cleavage; therefore, only the mutant sequence was present. DNA from none of either 24 controls or six other SSA patients contained the variant. Quantitative Southern blotting demonstrated that the patient's DNA contained two copies of the TTR gene per genome; the mutation was therefore homozygous rather than hemizygous. In the present case, the homozygous mutation TTR (122 Val----Ile) is associated with SSA, a finding which is consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance of this condition.\r"

The correlation for onset of menarche between MZ twins was .65 +/- .03, and that for DZ pairs was .18 +/- .04, although these differed somewhat between four birth cohorts. Environmental factors were more important in the older cohorts (perhaps because of less reliable recall). Total genotypic variance (additive plus nonadditive) ranged from 61% in the oldest cohort to 68% in the youngest cohort. In the oldest birth cohort (born before 1939), there was evidence of greater influence of environmental factors on age at menarche in the second-born twin, although there was no other evidence in the data that birth trauma affected timing. The greater part of the genetic variance was nonadditive (dominance or epistasis), and this is typical of a fitness trait. It appears that genetic nonadditivity is in the decreasing direction, and this is consistent with selection for early menarche during human evolution. Breakdown of inbreeding depression as a possible explanation for the secular decline in age at menarche is discussed.\r"

Three molecular classes were identified. Class I showed a deletion of D15S9-D15S13 and D15S18; class II showed a deletion of D15S9-D15S13; and in class III, including both sib pairs, no deletion was detected. These molecular classes appear to be identical to those observed in PWS. High-resolution cytogenetic data were available on 16 of the patients, and complete concordance between the presence of a cytogenetic deletion and a molecular deletion was observed. No submicroscopic deletions were detected. DNA samples from the parents of 10 patients with either a class I or a class II deletion were available for study. In seven of the 10 families, RFLPs were informative as to the parental origin of the deletion. In all informative families, the deleted chromosome 15 was observed to be of maternal origin. This finding is in contrast to the paternal origin of the deletions in PWS and is currently the only molecular difference observed between the two syndromes.\r"

The most parsimonious interpretation of the data is that the deletion is a very recent event which occurred in the subset of Bantu chromosomes already bearing a gene conversion of the A gamma gene by the G gamma gene. Its presence in black beta S chromosomes is most probably the consequence of a crossing-over between a Bantu beta S chromosome (with deletion and gene conversion) and a beta A chromosome.\r"

The ADFN mutation probably affects the migration of neural crest-derived precursors of the melanocytes. As a first step toward identifying the ADFN gene, a linkage study was performed to localize the disease locus on the X chromosome. The family was found to be informative for 11 of 107 RFLPs along the X, and two-point analysis showed four of them--factor 9 (F9), DXS91, DXS37, and DNF1--to have definite or suggestive linkage with ADFN. Multipoint linkage analysis indicated two possible orders within this cluster of loci, neither of which was preferable. In both orders F9 was the most distal, and the best estimate for the location of ADFN was between F9 and the next proximal marker (8.6 cM from F9 [Z = 8.1] or 8.3 cM from F9 [Z = 7.9]). These results suggest that the ADFN is at Xq26.3-q27.1. Disagreement between our data and previous localization of DXS91 at Xq11-q13 was resolved by hybridization of the probe pXG-17, which detects the DXS91 locus, to a panel of somatic cell hybrids containing different portions of the X chromosome. This experiment showed that this locus is definitely at Xq24-q26. Together with the linkage data, our results place DXS91 at Xq26 and underscore the importance of using more than one mapping method for the localization of molecular probes.\r"

Multipoint linkage analysis and studies of haplotypes and recombinants strongly suggest the localization of the VDD1 locus between the collagen type II alpha 1 (COL2A1) locus and clustered loci D12S14, D12S17, and D12S6, which segregate as a three-marker haplotype. Linkage disequilibrium between VDD1 and this three-marker haplotype supports the notion of a founder effect in the studied population.

A likely hypothesis is that the closely linked TCR variable (V beta) region genes contribute to IDDM susceptibility and that the association with the TCR C beta locus reflects this contribution, via linkage disequilibrium between V beta and C beta. The products of the beta-chain genes might be expected to be involved in the etiology of IDDM because of the autoimmune aspects of IDDM, the known involvement of HLA, and the necessity for TCR and HLA molecules to interact in an immune response. In order to investigate the hypothesis, we tested for linkage between IDDM and V genes encoded at either the TCR beta locus on chromosome 7 or the TCR alpha locus on chromosome 14, using 36 families with multiple affected sibs. No excess sharing of haplotypes defined by V alpha or V beta gene RFLPs was observed in affected sib pairs from IDDM families. We also studied unrelated IDDM patients (N = 73) and controls (N = 45) with the C beta RFLP but were unable to confirm the reported association even when the sample was stratified by HLA-DR type. Our results are incompatible with close linkage, in the majority of families, between either the TCR alpha or TCR beta locus and a gene making a major contribution to susceptibility to IDDM.\r"

However, there is no standard procedure for determining a confidence interval for gene location by using multipoint linkage analysis. A genetic counselor needs to know the confidence interval for gene location in order to determine the uncertainty of risk estimates provided to a consultant on the basis of DNA studies. We describe a resampling, or \"bootstrap,\" method for deriving an approximate confidence interval for gene location on the basis of data from a single pedigree. This method was used to define an approximate confidence interval for the location of a gene causing nonsyndromal X-linked mental retardation in a single pedigree. The approach seemed robust in that similar confidence intervals were derived by using different resampling protocols. Quantitative bounds for the confidence interval were dependent on the genetic map chosen. Once an approximate confidence interval for gene location was determined for this pedigree, it was possible to use multipoint risk analysis to estimate risk intervals for women of unknown carrier status. Despite the limited genotype data, the combination of the resampling method and multipoint risk analysis had a dramatic impact on the genetic advice available to consultants.\r"

Transient expression in COS cells produces a protein of approximately 104 kD that comigrates on SDS-PAGE with native alpha A. This alpha A gene is localized to chromosome 14q22-q24 by somatic cell hybrid and in situ hybridization analyses. Pulsed-field gel analysis of human genomic DNA revealed identically sized fragments when cDNA probes for alpha A and erythroid beta-spectrin were used; the latter gene has been previously localized to chromosome 14, band q22.

  ".W": "Gaucher disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is the most prevalent lysosomal storage disease. Gaucher disease has marked phenotypic variation and molecular heterogeneity, and seven point mutations in the acid beta-glucosidase (beta-Glc) gene have been identified. By means of sequence-specific oligonucleotides (SSO), mutation 6433C has been detected homozygously in neuronopathic type 2 (acute) and type 3 (subacute) patients, as well as in children with severe visceral involvement who are apparently free of neuronopathic disease. To investigate the molecular basis for this puzzling finding, amplified beta-Glc cDNAs from 6433C homozygous type 2 and type 3 Gaucher disease patients were cloned and sequenced. The Swedish type 3 Gaucher disease patient was truly homozygous for alleles only containing the 6433C mutation. In comparison, the type 2 patient contained a singly mutated 6433C allele and a \"complex\" allele with multiple discrete point mutations (6433C, 6468C, and 6482C). Each of the mutations in the complex allele also was present in the beta-Glc pseudogene. SSO hybridization of 6433C homozygotes revealed that both type 2 patients contained additional mutations in one allele, whereas the 6433C alone was detected in both type 3 and in young severe type 1 Gaucher disease patients. These results suggest that the presence of the complex allele influences the severity of neuronopathic disease in 6433C homozygotes and reveal the central role played by the pseudogene in the formation of mutant alleles of the beta-Glc gene. Analysis of additional cDNA clones also identified two new alleles in a type 3 patient, emphasizing the molecular heterogeneity of neuronopathic Gaucher disease.\r"

This excess number of morphs mainly occurs through an excess of rare morphs, and this discrepancy is more pronounced in a pooled sample of five Asian populations. It is suggested that this discrepancy is probably due to internal heterogeneity in each of the anthropologically defined populations. This analysis demonstrates the utility that population data for a single locus, such as the mtDNA genome, have for detecting hidden heterogeneity in populations, provided that the locus has substantial genetic variability, so that many variant alleles can be detected.\r"

A detailed understanding of the transmission genetics of mtDNA has been partly hampered by the lack of evidence for heteroplasmic individuals. Among families with Leber hereditary optic neuroretinopathy, we found a maternal lineage with individuals heteroplasmic for a single nucleotide change, and we were able to follow the segregation of polymorphic mitochondrial genomes over 3 generations. The results show that rapid segregation can occur but also that the level of heteroplasmy can be maintained from one generation to another. In this family the disease phenotype is associated with the mtDNA sequence change, confirming the involvement of the mutation in the disease.\r"

Ultrastructural analysis was not helpful for the definition of the cell lineage. Most myelomonocytic markers (MAC387, CD13, CD14, CD64, CD68) were either negative on the MH cells or were expressed on cells with rearranged TCR gene.

DNA diploidy is associated with advanced stage and unfavorable histology, but the relationships among ploidy, N-myc amplification, and proliferative activity are not known. To determine if DNA diploidy is associated with N-myc amplification, we studied 29 neuroblastomas with flow cytometric analysis and Southern blot analysis. Clinical and histologic features were also evaluated. Sixty percent of the N-myc-amplified tumors were diploid, compared to 26% of the neuroblastomas, which lacked N-myc amplification (P = 0.11). In our analysis of proliferative activity and N-myc amplification, a higher mean percentage of cells in S phase was seen in the N-myc-amplified tumors (13.4%) than in the unamplified tumors (10%), but again the result was not statistically significant (P = 0.14). Significant associations were seen between unfavorable histology and DNA diploidy (P = 0.05), and between unfavorable histology and high proliferative activity (P = 0.007). Our data suggest that biologic factors other than N-myc amplification play a role in determining the aggressiveness of at least some diploid neuroblastomas.\r"

  ".U": "90274047\r", 
  ".W": "It has been proposed that the skin is a functionally unique compartment of the immune system, although little direct evidence supporting this hypothesis has been presented. Here we show that lymphocyte populations at cutaneous sites can be differentiated from otherwise similar populations at noncutaneous sites by their preferential expression of an epitope defined by the MAb HECA-452. This MAb recognizes a predominantly 200-kd cell-surface glycoprotein present on about 16% of peripheral blood T cells, including both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (17% and 11% HECA-452+, respectively), as well as TCR-delta-bearing T cells (32%+). Most thymocytes (99%) lacked HECA-452 antigen expression, and essentially all the HECA-452+ peripheral blood T cells were found in the adhesion molecule high, CD45R low putative memory cell subset, findings suggesting that HECA-452 expression develops peripherally as a consequence of antigenic stimulation. However, the HECA-452 antigen is not a conventional activation antigen because it was not upregulated with mitogen stimulation of peripheral blood T cells. Most significantly, among 54 diverse specimens of normal/reactive lymphoid tissues and sites of chronic inflammation, there was a clear association of lymphocyte HECA-452 expression and cutaneous location. In extracutaneous sites (n = 38) only about 5% of lymphocytes within the T-cell areas of these tissues expressed this antigen, whereas in inflammatory skin lesions (n = 16), 85% were HECA-452+. The association of HECA-452 expression and cutaneous location was also seen in a series of T-cell lymphomas. The malignant cells of 16 of 18 cases of epidermotropic (patch/plaque) stage mycosis fungoides were HECA-452+, as well as 2 of 7 nonmycosis fungoides peripheral T-cell lymphomas in skin. In contrast, this antigen was not expressed in thymic (lymphoblastic) lymphomas (n = 14), nonepidermotropic (tumor) stage mycosis fungoides (n = 5), and noncutaneous peripheral T-cell lymphomas (n = 15). Among lymphocytes, the preferential expression of the HECA-452 determinant by cutaneous T cells supports the hypothesis that the skin constitutes a immunologically unique lymphoid tissue and suggests that this molecule may play a role in either lymphocyte homing to skin or in lymphocyte interactions with the epidermis.\r"

  ".W": "A series of adrenal cortical adenomas (ACA) and carcinomas (ACC), as well as normal adrenal cortex have been studied by a panel of 11 antibodies to characterize antigenic changes that may distinguish these morphologically similar entities. Normal adrenal cortex and ACA express low-molecular weight cytokeratin intermediate filaments. However, none of the six primary or seven metastatic ACCs were found to express detectable levels of cytokeratins. In contrast, vimentin was seen in all ACCs studied and was heterogeneously expressed by ACAs. However, its expression was usually confined to stromal elements of the normal adrenal cortex. We conclude that adrenal cortical cells undergo characteristic changes in intermediate filament expression during the process of neoplastic conversion and malignant transformation. Undetectable expression of cytokeratins and strong expression of vimentin is associated with malignant adrenal cortical lesions. In addition, we examined the antigenic phenotype of a series of primary renal cell carcinomas (RCC). Renal cell carcinomas express cytokeratins, while ACCs do not. The majority of primary RCCs express Lewis blood group isoantigens (most commonly Lewis X), while ACAs and ACCs do not. The panel of antibodies described here may help to distinguish morphologically similar lesions of like histogenesis (ACAs vs. ACCs) and lesions of different histogenesis (adrenal vs. renal) on the basis of their composite antigenic phenotypes.\r"

  ".W": "Among 102 brains obtained from patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), 34 cases with subacute AIDS encephalitis were characterized by immunohistochemistry using an antibody that binds to a human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein, gp41. This glycoprotein was detected in mononucleated and/or multinucleated cells in 90% of adult and 50% of pediatric brains with subacute AIDS encephalitis. In addition, many gp41-positive cells with bipolar or multipolar processes were found in 10 cases, and these cells occurred most frequently in the basal ganglia and internal capsule. The phenotype of the gp41-positive cells was determined using an improved double-labeling immunohistochemical technique that employed beta-galactosidase and peroxidase conjugated reagents. Cell-type specific markers for double-labeling included: Ricinus communis agglutinin-1 (RCA-1) for macrophages and microglia; Ulex europaeus agglutinin-1 for endothelium; anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) for astrocytes; anti-amyloid precursor protein for neurons; and anti-leukocyte common antigen for leukocytes. Results of double-immunostaining revealed that gp41-positive cells of all morphologic types, including cells with bipolar or multipolar processes, were double-labeled with RCA-1, but not with markers for astrocytes, neurons, or endothelia. These findings support the contention that HIV-1 infection of the CNS is predominantly restricted to cells of the macrophage/microglia lineage.\r"

  ".W": "Although tumor DNA content and proliferation are usually determined by flow cytometry (FCM), quantitative microscopic image analysis is a viable alternative technique that also provides important histologic correlations. To compare these methods, we measured DNA content and proliferation in 54 consecutive breast cancers and 15 benign breast lesions by FCM and IA. DNA content determination was concordant in 49 of 54 cancers measured by FCM and IA. Four of the discordant cases were aneuploid by IA and diploid by FCM. There was good correlation between the DNA index (DI) measured by FCM and IA (r = 0.89, P less than 0.0001). Proliferation was assessed by IA quantitation of Ki-67 and PCNA/Cyclin antibody staining, as well as by flow cytometric S-phase fraction (SPF). Ki-67 positivity was greater in breast cancer than in benign controls (21.6% +/- 13.1% vs. 7.9% +/- 5.6% [P less than 0.0001]), as was PCNA/Cyclin positivity (10.2 +/- 6.7% vs. 2.7 +/- 2.5% [P less than 0.0001]). S-phase fraction measured by FCM was 7.9% +/- 5.7% for carcinomas and 3.17% +/- 2.1% for benign controls (P less than 0.003). Ki-67 and Cyclin staining, as well as SPF, were significantly increased in aneuploid compared to diploid tumors, and increased staining was associated with worsening nuclear grade. There were significant correlations between SPF and Ki-67 staining (r = 0.48, P less than 0.0001) and SPF and Cyclin staining (r = 0.48, P less than 0.0001). We conclude that FCM and IA provide comparable measurements of DNA content, although occasional discrepancies occur. Image analysis provides a valuable alternative method for assessing tumor cell proliferation and may offer certain advantages over FCM.\r"

Mice infected with Toxocara canis have a marked eosinophilia, and develop eosinophil-rich granulomatous lesions in the soft tissues of the body, especially the lungs, liver, brain, and skeletal muscle. Few reports have described myocardial lesions associated with T. canis infections in mice. We examined the hearts of CBA/J mice killed at weekly intervals over an 8-week period for evidence of myocardial damage that might be attributable to eosinophils. Total white blood cell counts and eosinophil counts were obtained during this period, and revealed a peak white blood cell count of approximately 28,000 cells/mm3 at day 7 after infection and a peak eosinophil count of approximately 4,000 cells/mm3 at day 14 after infection. Myocardial lesions in the ventricular wall began as focal infiltrates of eosinophils and histiocytes, then progressed into granulomata containing necrotic debris. Collagen deposition was noted by day 21 after infection. By day 42 after infection, the lesions had contracted greatly because of a loss of cellularity, and consisted mainly of fibroblasts and hemosiderin-laden macrophages. Myocyte damage, characterized by increased eosinophilia and necrosis, was observed. T. canis-infected CBA/J mice thus offer a useful model to study eosinophil-dependent myocardial damage.\r"

Their expression in benign and malignant well-differentiated and poorly differentiated components of 88 prostates with prostatic adenocarcinomas, and in 25 metastases, was evaluated using polyclonal antibodies developed against these antigens. Zn-Alpha 2-GP was present in benign hyperplastic glands in 91.1% of cases, but in only 40.7% (poorly differentiated component) to 48.5% (well-differentiated component) of prostatic adenocarcinomas, and in 8% of metastases. The expression of PSP-94 was present in 89.3% of benign hyperplastic glands, but in only 50% (well-differentiated adenocarcinoma component) to 57.3% (poorly differentiated component) of prostatic adenocarcinomas and 28% of metastases. The expression of these proteins by the tumor was unrelated to the initial stage and the tumor grade. Because of their low frequency in prostatic adenocarcinomas, especially in metastases, Zn-Alpha 2-GP and PSP-94 appear to have a limited diagnostic usefulness. Further studies are needed, however, to explore other clinical applications of these two new prostatic secretory proteins.\r"

This study aimed to elucidate their relationship. Among 48 consecutive cases of primary malignant lymphoma found in gastrectomy specimens, there were 10 cases showing coexistence of these two elements, which were further studied in detail. The high-grade component predominated in six cases, the low-grade component predominated in two cases, and the two components were intermingled in two cases. In the low-grade component, the small neoplastic cells possessed irregular nuclei (centrocytelike), and glandular invasion was a prominent feature. In the high-grade component, the blasts occurred in clusters or sheets, and often possessed plasmacytoid cytoplasm; glandular invasion was a rare event. In both components, the neoplastic cells frequently showed formation of nodules suggestive of colonization of reactive lymphoid follicles. Immunohistochemical studies showed that the neoplastic cells in the low- and high-grade components expressed the same class of immunoglobulin light chain in eight of the nine cases studied; staining in one case was unsatisfactory. Their intimate relationship as well as identical light chain restriction suggests that the high-grade component arises through blastic transformation of the low-grade component.\r"

Basement membrane deposition was studied by immunohistochemistry, using species cross-reactive polyclonal anti-human type IV collagen antiserum, mouse- and rat-specific polyclonal anti-mouse type IV collagen antiserum, human-specific monoclonal anti-type-IV collagen antibody, and by in situ hybridization, using a 32S-labeled species cross-reactive cDNA probe, specific for type IV collagen mRNA. In the xenografts, species-cross-reactive anti-type-IV collagen antiserum demonstrated the presence of irregular and discontinuous BM. In 5583-E and HT-29 xenografts, only murine type IV collagen epitopes were detected. In contrast, in WISH and in KB xenografts, the BM stained human as well as murine type IV collagen epitopes. By in situ hybridization, type IV collagen mRNA was detectable in stromal cells only in 5583-E and HT-29 xenografts, but in both epithelial and stromal cells in WISH and KB xenografts. These results indicate that in this model system epithelial tumor cells and stromal (mesenchymal) cells are involved in the production and deposition of a BM.\r"

Heretofore, in vivo investigations of the biology of Pc and pathogenesis of pneumocystosis have generally employed steroid-induced immune suppression with antibiotic prophylaxis and protein deprivation. This approach has many drawbacks, chief among them being the widespread, multiple interacting effects caused by the inducing agents. Athymic (nude) mice and rats have been used, but are less than ideal, as the immune defect primarily affects T lymphocytes. This article describes the natural history, pathobiology, and environmental effects on Pc pneumonitis in nonaxenically housed mice homozygous for the autosomal recessive mutation 'severe combined immunodeficiency' (scid), which almost totally lack both cell-mediated and antibody-mediated immune functions. The predictability, unequivocal expression, high morbidity, and well-defined genetic basis make scid/scid mutant mice the model of choice for in vivo studies of spontaneous pneumocystosis.\r"

  ".W": "Pharmacologic doses of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a steroid hormone produced naturally by the adrenal cortex, may lower plasma lipoprotein levels in humans and reduce the severity of experimental atherosclerosis in rabbits. Effects of DHEA on cells of the vascular wall, particularly endothelial cells (EC), which are in direct contact with the plasma, have not been documented. The authors have found that micromolar doses of DHEA induce a consistent and reversible morphologic change in cultured EC derived from the human umbilical vein. During 24 hours of exposure to DHEA, cultured EC became loaded with phase-dense, perinuclear cytoplasmic granules, which persisted while DHEA remained in the culture medium. Certain steroids related to DHEA, particularly 17-ketosteroids, also induced perinuclear cytoplasmic granules. The granules lost their phase-density after fixed monolayers were extracted using ethanol or methanol. The granules did not form in media made with lipoprotein-deficient serum, suggesting that serum lipoproteins were involved in formation of the granules. Ultrastructurally, the granules were identical to multilamellar lipid structures, a type of pleomorphic lipid-containing lysosome found in foam cells. The granules were identified as lysosomes by positive reaction for acid phosphatase. The mechanism by which DHEA induces formation of lysosomal lipid structures remains to be determined.\r"

As one who has devoted more than three decades to helping a great variety of people make sense of scientific data, I found the overall quality of data analysis in these papers to be above average for the medical literature; and yet, I found many instances of errors so serious as to render invalid the conclusions of the authors. My 10 proposed rules for reading clinical research reports constitute only an interim solution to a very worrisome problem.

  ".W": "Twenty-five patients with ulcerative colitis were treated between 1959 and 1986 at the Mount Sinai Hospital, with severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage as their major complaint. Twenty-two patients required operation, while three patients were treated medically. Total proctocolectomy with ileostomy was carried out in 5 patients, and subtotal colectomy accompanied by mucous fistula (14), Hartmann closure (2), or ileosigmoidostomy (1) was performed in 17 patients. Eleven of the patients who underwent operation had emergency colectomies, while the remaining 11 had semielective procedures. Subtotal colectomy was performed in 10 of the 11 emergency cases. Indications for emergency surgery were massive hemorrhage alone in seven patients and severe hemorrhage complicated by toxic megacolon in four patients. One patient died postoperatively of a perforated duodenal ulcer following emergency subtotal colectomy. There were two late deaths from leukemia in one surgically treated patient and one medically treated patient at 9 and 18 months, respectively. All 4 of the 25 patients with remaining intact rectums were alive and well at 3- to 12-year follow-up. Subtotal colectomy can be undertaken in patients with massive hemorrhage from ulcerative colitis for whom subsequent ileoanal anastomosis is planned, provided that one recognizes and is prepared for the approximately 12% risk of continued rectal hemorrhage.\r"

Between 1955 and 1985, resected appendices of 353 patients showed periappendicitis on pathologic examination. Sixty-one of these patients, in whom exploratory surgery was performed for reasons other than acute appendicitis, underwent incidental appendectomy. In 251 of the remaining 292 patients, appendectomy was performed either for pathologically confirmed acute appendicitis or concomitant with treatment of other unsuspected abnormalities discovered intraoperatively. Although the remaining 41 patients were also believed to have acute appendicitis, their resected specimens revealed only periappendicitis. The latter group was composed of 9 males and 32 females, with a mean age of 29 years (range: 6 to 76 years). Twenty-four complications occurred in 18 of these patients (44%). Seven additional operative procedures were required in 5 of the 41 patients (12%). One patient died (2%). We conclude that identification of periappendicitis in the patient presumed to have acute appendicitis is of definite clinical significance and may merit further clinical investigation.\r"

The duodenogastric reflux of the total bile acids increased from a mean preoperative value of 1.9 mumol/hour to a mean postoperative value of 21 mumol/hour (p = 0.008). The duodenogastric reflux of all single bile acids increased after cholecystectomy, with a higher increase in glycoconjugated compared with tauroconjugated bile acids. The parietal cells decreased from a mean preoperative value of 82.8 to a mean postoperative value of 68.7 (p = 0.05), whereas there was only a mild increase in the number of gastrin cells; the output of gastric acid remained unchanged. The variation of the gastrin cells before and after cholecystectomy was negatively correlated only with the variation of taurocholic acid (r = -0.50, p = 0.05), while the variation of the parietal cells was mildly correlated with all single bile acids (r = 0.35-0.50, 0.05 less than p less than 0.02). These findings show an increased duodenogastric reflux of bile acids 6 months after cholecystectomy with a mild morphologic alteration of the gastric mucosa.\r"

Anastomoses were performed with a stapler. Intraoperative frozen-section examination of the rectal margin established that it was free of tumor. Two patients died of surgery-related causes. Median follow-up of the remaining patients is now 52 months (range: 26 to 76 months). Eight patients had recurrences documented at surgical re-exploration: two local (pelvic) only, three local and distant, and two distant only. Local recurrences happened despite a frozen-section examination of the rectal margin negative for tumor. Six of the eight patients who experienced a recurrence have died of disease progression. Distant metastases were found in six other patients during follow-up; they subsequently died. Thus, our therapeutic approach was not associated with decreases in local or overall recurrences.\r"

In the present study, encompassing the years 1971 to 1987, the frequency of iatrogenic splenic injury was reduced to 9% (134 of 1,557 splenectomies). However, there has been no evidence of a progressive decrease in accidental splenic injury from 1971 to 1987. Although the number of injuries related to operations on the stomach or repair of hiatus hernia have declined somewhat in the past decade, the incidence of splenic injuries secondary to colectomy and nephrectomy has not changed appreciably, and injuries linked to complex operations on the aorta and its branches (19 cases) have increased. No evidence could be found that morbidity was increased if the splenic injury is promptly recognized and managed by splenectomy. However, 13 of these 134 patients required reoperation for control of continued bleeding from unrecognized iatrogenic splenic trauma. Constant awareness of the continued prevalence of this operative complication and the mechanisms by which it is produced should enable surgeons to lessen its frequency and potential sequelae.\r"

A prompt response to broad preoperative antibiotic coverage and definitive operative intervention (appendectomy in all cases) was found, with no mortality and essentially no major morbidity (less than 1%).

The cancer-related 5-year survival rate was 72% in the follow-up group and 62% in the non-follow-up group (difference not significant). Cancer recurrences were more common in the follow-up group than in the group that was not followed (32% versus 21%; p less than 0.02). Curative reoperations were performed in 21% and 7%, respectively (p less than 0.01) of patients with recurrent cancer in these two groups. The cancer-related 5-year survival rate after curative reoperations was 47%. Despite these differences, only the initial Dukes' classification had an independent influence on the survival rate. It is concluded that regular follow-up detects more recurrent cancers, enabling radical reoperations significantly more often than when there is no follow-up. The outcome after curative reoperations is encouraging. These aspects favor regular follow-up of patients with colorectal carcinoma after curative operations.\r"

Ventricular fibrillation was electrically induced and cardiac resuscitation was performed according to a standardized protocol, which included closed chest cardiac compressions, epinephrine, lidocaine, sodium bicarbonate administration, and electrical defibrillation. Animals not resuscitated within 4 min were excluded from further study. Resuscitated animals were managed in an intensive care setting for 24 h postresuscitation. Neurologic deficits were scored at 2, 4, and 7 days postresuscitation. Subsequently, the animals' brains underwent histologic examination. Nine cats were excluded from data analysis. Three did not meet protocol criteria and six could not be resuscitated within 4 min. As a result of a technical error, the brain of one glucose-treated cat was not analyzed. Six saline-treated and five glucose-treated animals met all protocol criteria and survived for 7 days postresuscitation. Plasma glucose concentration before cardiac arrest was 118 +/- 24 mg/dl (mean +/- SD) in the saline group and 269 +/- 21 mg/dl in the glucose group (P less than 0.01). Neurologic outcome rank at 2, 4, and 7 days postresuscitation was significantly worse in glucose-treated cats (P less than 0.01, P less than 0.01, and P less than 0.01, respectively).

The effects of 1.1 and 1.8 MAC halothane, isoflurane, and enflurane on pacing-induced arrhythmias were studied in this model. The ease of initiation of ventricular tachycardia was measured in both awake and anesthetized dogs (n = 18). Excitation thresholds, conduction times, and refractory periods in both normal and infarcted myocardium were also determined to understand changes in the ease of induction of the arrhythmias secondary to anesthetic exposure. Halothane and enflurane administration suppressed the induction of ventricular tachycardia compared with the unanesthetized control (P less than 0.01 for both). During isoflurane anesthesia, there was a trend that was not statistically significant for pacing-induced ventricular tachycardia to be less frequent than during the conscious state (P = 0.11). Halothane and enflurane prolonged refractory periods in both normal and infarcted myocardium, whereas isoflurane had that effect only in normal myocardium. In addition, halothane and enflurane tended to increase refractory periods more than isoflurane in both regions. Conduction times and excitation thresholds were not altered by anesthetic administration. It is concluded that halothane and enflurane suppress inducible ventricular arrhythmias secondary to a prior myocardial infarction. In addition, the increased efficacy of halothane and enflurane as antiarrhythmic agents compared with isoflurane in this model may be related to their greater prolongation of refractory periods.\r"

At 1 MAC halothane, isoflurane, and enflurane significantly (P less than 0.001) increased spontaneous discharge frequency of C fibers to 410%, 388%, and 569% of control, respectively. The anesthetics produced burst discharge activity over the concentration range of 0.25-1.5 MAC and depressed discharge activity at higher concentrations (greater than 3.0 MAC). Similar excitatory effects were produced by the potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (250-500 microM). Variable effects on evoked discharge activity of A-delta fibers were observed. Halothane reduced action potential amplitude (77.3 +/- 4.5% of control +/- SD; n = 6 at 1 MAC) and increased spike latency (0.42 +/- 0.075 ms). In contrast, the ethers decreased both spike latency (isoflurane by 0.31 +/- 0.064 ms and enflurane by 0.35 +/- 0.058 ms) and action potential amplitude. Halothane and the ether anesthetics produced a common excitatory action on C fibers; however, the differential depressant effects on A-delta fibers suggest that different membrane mechanisms of action are involved.\r"

The sciatic nerve was divided in the proximal thigh and a two-electrode microfilament recording technique and signal averaging computer were used to survey afferent neuronal activity prior to and after tourniquet inflation. This method was able to determine both firing rate and conduction velocity of spontaneously active or mechanically sensitive nerve fibers. In 14 rats observed prior to tourniquet inflation there was much spontaneous activity. These fibers all had rapid conduction velocities (30 +/- 6.9 m/s) (mean +/- SD) and firing rates (16.3 +/- 1.9 H). All fibers could be stimulated by movement of distal joints or by probing the skin of the leg. After tourniquet inflation, a pressure-induced conduction block occurred stopping all spontaneous and mechanically induced activity. After a short interval, (55 +/- 16 min) a different group of spontaneously active fibers were observed that had both slow conduction (2.04 +/- 0.77 m/s) firing rates (0.54 +/- 0.9 H). These fibers did not respond to mechanical stimulation of the limb distal to the tourniquet, or local anesthetic or cold block of the nerve distal to the tourniquet. Blockade of the sciatic nerve just proximal to the tourniquet and deflation of the tourniquet did abolish activity in these fibers. In ten separate rats in which tourniquets were placed but no surgical incision made, mean arterial blood pressure rose significantly after tourniquet inflation. With tourniquet deflation, blood pressure fell significantly from levels observed during tourniquet inflation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Rats were anesthetized with 1.4% inspired isoflurane in air and incomplete ischemia was produced by temporary unilateral carotid occlusion and hypotension of 30 mmHg for 30 min. The rats were recovered and neurologic outcome was scored every 8 h for 3 days using a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (normal) to 5 (death associated with stroke). Brain histopathology was scored using a four-point scale on 19 of 30 rats surviving the 3-day postischemic neurologic examination and was correlated with neurologic deficit scores. Fasted rats had plasma glucose concentrations of 79 +/- 7 mg/100 ml (mean +/- SE) during ischemia and a significantly better neurologic outcome (P less than 0.001) than glucose-loaded rats (plasma glucose = 496 +/- 43 mg/100 ml). Nonfasted rats had blood glucose values (292 +/- 28 mg/100 ml) and deficit scores not significantly different from fasted but better than glucose-loaded rats (P = 0.054). Brain histology showed the greatest neuronal damage in caudate followed by hippocampus and cortical tissue. Histopathologic evaluation showed a correlation of r = 0.87 (P less than 0.01) with neurologic outcome. In separate experiments brain samples were collected at the end of the ischemic period in each of the experimental groups and regional tissue lactate and brain phosphocreatine and adenosinetriphosphate (ATP) concentrations were measured. Ischemic tissue lactate was similar in fasted, nonfasted, and glucose-loaded rats in caudate and hippocampus but was significantly higher in glucose loaded rats in cortical and thalamic tissue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The authors' aim was to determine if these conduction disturbances also occurred at moderate plasma bupivacaine concentrations (2.2-3.7 micrograms/ml) when in association with other factors which affect intracardiac conduction, such as hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. Thus, duration of the QRS complex, ventricular conduction time, and effective refractory period (ERP) was measured during ventricular pacing at 180 beats per min in 46 anesthetized, closed-chest dogs separated into five treatment groups as follows: group I, an iv bolus of 4 mg/kg of bupivacaine plus an infusion of 0.1 mg.kg-1.min-1 of bupivacaine followed in 50-60 min by 10 ml.kg-1.min-1 of 1.5% glycine iv to produce dilutional hyponatremia; group II, 1.5% glycine alone, as above; group III, bupivacaine, as above, followed in 50-60 min by 0.05 mmol.kg-1.min-1 of KCl iv to produce hyperkalemia; group IV, KCl alone, as above; and group V, bupivacaine, as above, except that the duration of infusion was 90 min. QRS duration and ventricular conduction time, which were prolonged approximately 33% and 61%, respectively, by bupivacaine alone were additionally prolonged 29% and 44%, respectively, when serum sodium concentration was lowered to 114 mmol/l and potassium concentration was raised to 7.7 mmol/l. The combinations of bupivacaine and hyponatremia, and bupivacaine and hyperkalemia tended to increase ERP more than did bupivacaine alone, although these changes were not statistically significant. Wave burst arrhythmias and episodes of ventricular tachycardia occurred spontaneously or were triggered by pacing in those dogs in which conduction time was most prolonged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "It has been suggested that halothane inhibits contraction of airway smooth muscle in vivo mainly by reducing reflex activity in nerves innervating the muscle with only minimal direct effects on the muscle itself. To examine possible mechanisms of action of halothane at clinically relevant concentrations the authors studied the effect of halothane on increases in pulmonary resistance (RL) produced by either vagus nerve stimulation (VNS, which caused neurally mediated constriction) or the inhalation of nebulized acetylcholine (ACh, which directly stimulated the smooth muscle cell) in nine mongrel dogs. The frequency of bilateral VNS and the dose of nebulized ACh were adjusted to produce approximately equal increases in RL. Halothane reduced the response to both types of stimulation in a dose-dependent fashion. At halothane concentrations greater than or equal to 0.4 MAC, the VNS response was significantly less than the ACh response. When tetrodotoxin was given to block neural activity, the ACh response was unchanged, confirming that neural activation did not contribute significantly to smooth muscle contraction in response to ACh. The authors conclude that in addition to neurally mediated effects, halothane at clinically used concentrations has significant direct effects on airway smooth muscle stimulated by ACh. The relative importance of each factor in vivo should depend on the stimulus that causes contraction of airway smooth muscle.\r"

By not surgically invading the subarachnoid space, this procedure allows drugs to be administered remotely through an indwelling catheter while monitoring drug effects on the spinal monosynaptic reflex with noninvasive electrophysiologic methods. In this way the normal pharmacokinetic factors are left intact so that time-action relations can be monitored under conditions that may resemble spinal anesthesia in conscious animals. Using this technique it was established that chloroprocaine with and without 0.2% sodium bisulfite blocks the monosynaptic reflex in a fully reversible manner. The reflex block of a higher concentration of bisulfite (0.6%) was poorly reversible in some preparations. These results correlate well with a previous in vivo behavioral study on the motor and sensory blocking actions of intrathecal chloroprocaine and bisulfite in the same animal species. The authors feel this technique can be used to study the temporal changes in reflex activity caused by other drugs administered via the intrathecal route.\r"

Inhibition of median nerve A alpha sensory and motor fibers was assessed using measurements of sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitude and compound motor action potential (CMAP) amplitude, respectively. Inhibition of median nerve C fibers was assessed by the increase in skin temperature and by the decrease in median (relative to ulnar) galvanic skin potential (GSP) amplitude. Lidocaine inhibited SNAP to a greater extent in pregnant than nonpregnant women at all time points (P = 0.019). CMAP declined differently in the pregnant and nonpregnant groups (P = 0.01): the pregnant subjects achieved steady state inhibition before the nonpregnant subjects. The two groups developed comparable steady state inhibition. Skin temperature was higher in pregnant women at all time points (P less than 0.0001); moreover, the increased skin temperature of pregnant women differed from that of the nonpregnant women (P = 0.037), reflecting a more rapid temperature increase in the pregnant women. GSP amplitude declined to 50% of control more rapidly in pregnant (mean = 4 min) than nonpregnant women (mean = 11.5 min), but these differences did not achieve statistical significance. It is concluded that pregnancy increases median nerve susceptibility to lidocaine.\r"

Twenty-four patients in sinus rhythm without evidence of mitral valve disease undergoing elective myocardial revascularization were studied. Anesthesia consisted of a high-dose opioid-muscle relaxant-oxygen technique. After endotracheal intubation a 3.5-MHz phased-array transesophageal echocardiographic probe was inserted and positioned to obtain a long-axis view of the left atrium and left ventricle. The Doppler sample volume was placed at the mitral annulus with minimal cursor angulation, and the biphasic velocity tracing of transmitral blood flow was recorded. A hemodynamic profile was obtained, and cardiac output was measured in triplicate by thermodilution. Ventricular pacing was then instituted and the hemodynamic and thermodilution measurements were repeated. The peak early filling (E) velocity was 0.34 +/- 0.11 m/s, and the peak atrial (A) velocity was 0.38 +/- 0.09 m/s. The mean E:A ratio was 0.91 +/- 0.3, and the median value was 0.88. In sinus rhythm the cardiac index of those patients with an E:A greater than 0.88 (group 1) was 1.97 +/- 0.32 l/min and those with an E:A less than 0.88 (group 2) was 1.76 +/- 0.50 (NS). During ventricular pacing the patients in group 1 (1.56 +/- 0.32 l/min) had significantly higher cardiac indices than those in group 2 (1.21 +/- 0.31 l/min) (P less than 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One hundred sixty-three pediatric patients over a period of 6 yr were admitted to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center with a diagnosis of anterior mediastinal mass. Forty four of these patients required surgery and their records were reviewed. In recent years perioperative radiation therapy has been advocated for this patient group prior to their receiving general anesthesia. If a tissue diagnosis has not been made, preoperative radiation therapy may distort histologic findings and prevent accurate diagnosis. All patients with an anterior mediastinal mass who must receive general anesthesia in our institution do so prior to treatment with radiation or chemotherapy even in the presence of cardiovascular or respiratory symptoms. No patient died or sustained permanent injury as a result of their anesthetic or operative experience. Two patients who experienced difficulty on induction of anesthesia required tracheal intubation with a rigid bronchoscope. Two patients developed airway obstruction during anesthetic maintenance that was corrected with changes in patient position. Four patients were unable to have their tracheas extubated at the conclusion of surgery and one patient required tracheal reintubation in the immediate postoperative period. These patients were treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy after tissue for diagnosis had been obtained. The authors conclude that in the absence of life-threatening preoperative airway obstruction and severe clinical symptoms general anesthesia may be safely induced prior to radiation therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Previous work has shown forced expiratory wheezes (FEW) to be associated with onset of flow limitation and to have spectral characteristics similar to wheezes heard in patients with obstructive lung diseases. This study was designed to determine whether the acoustic characteristics of FEW are reproducible under controlled lung volume and flow conditions. Six healthy, nonsmoking young adults 28 to 37 yr of age were studied. They performed FVC maneuvers through a set of round apertures (diameters, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, and 1 mm). Flow, measured with a pneumotachograph, and tracheal lung sounds, recorded with a Hewlett-Packard HP20510A contact sensor, were recorded simultaneously on magnetic tape and analyzed off-line. For each subject, data from three different aperture sizes, measured in triplicates, were analyzed (total of 54 runs); 199 different wheezes were identified (mean, 3.7 wheezes/run), and 56.7 +/- 5.1% (mean +/- SEM) of wheezes found in a certain run (range, 41.7 to 77.8%) were identical to wheezes found in the other two runs of the same aperture size (i.e., same flow rate). In 17 of the 18 sets of triplicate runs analyzed, at least one major wheeze was identical in all three runs of the set. In three of the sets, two different identical wheezes were found. These findings support a deterministic mechanism of generation of wheezes and is in line with the predictions of the \"flutter theory.\"\r"

  ".W": "Electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve of rats is known to produce plasma extravasation in the trachea, presumably by releasing substance P or other tachykinins from sensory nerves. We sought to determine whether the tachyphylaxis that develops after prolonged vagal stimulation results from an inability of sensory nerves to release tachykinins or from an inability of tracheal blood vessels to respond to tachykinins. To induce tachyphylaxis, we electrically stimulated the right vagus nerve of Long-Evans rats for 5 min (5 V, 1 ms, 20 Hz). Then, 10 min later, we gave intravenous injections of capsaicin (0.3 mumol/kg), histamine (18 mumols/kg), or substance P (2.2 nmol/kg), which produce equivalent amounts of plasma extravasation as assessed by the extravasation of Evans blue dye. We found that vagal stimulation reduced the amount of dye extravasation produced by capsaicin but not the amount produced by either histamine or substance P. We also found that pretreating neonatal rats with capsaicin, which destroys tachykinin-containing sensory nerves, reduced the amount of dye extravasation produced by capsaicin but not the amount produced by either histamine or substance P. This finding suggests that capsaicin produces plasma extravasation in the trachea by releasing tachykinins from sensory nerves, whereas histamine and substance P do so by acting directly on tracheal blood vessels. Taken together, our results indicate that prolonged vagal stimulation reduces the ability of sensory nerves to release tachykinins but that tracheal blood vessels remain fully responsive to both histamine and substance P.\r"

We determined the binding of the beta-antagonist radioligand [125I]pindolol (IPIN) to intact eosinophils obtained from the peritoneal cavity of guinea pigs and from blood of patients with eosinophilia. Specific binding was saturable, and Scatchard analysis showed a single binding site with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 24.6 pM and maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) of 7,166 per cell. ICI 118,551, a beta 2-selective antagonist, inhibited IPIN binding with a Ki value of 0.28 nM and was approximately 5,000-fold more effective than the beta 1-selective antagonist, atenolol. Isoproterenol increased cAMP levels about 5.5-fold above basal levels (EC50 = 25 microM); albuterol, a beta 2-agonist, behaved as a partial agonist with a maximal stimulation of 80%. Binding to human eosinophils gave similar results with a Kd of 25.3 pM and a Bmax corresponding to 4,333 sites per cell. Incubation of both human and guinea pig eosinophils with opsonized zymosan (2 mg/ml) or with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (10(-8) and 10(-6) M) resulted in superoxide anion generation and the release of eosinophil peroxidase; albuterol (10(-7) to 10(-5) M) had no inhibitory effect on the release of these products. Thus, eosinophils from patients with eosinophilia and from the peritoneal cavity of guinea pigs possess beta-receptors of the beta 2-subtype that are coupled to adenylate cyclase; however, these receptors do not modulate oxidative metabolism or degranulation. The possible therapeutic consequences of these observations to asthma are discussed.\r"

We have performed bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in 12 patients with lung disease (sarcoid, six; pneumonia, two; asthma, two; carcinoma, one; alveolitis of unknown cause, one) and in six normal control subjects. The BAL fluid was analyzed for lipoxin A4 (LXA4) using gas chromatography mass spectrometry with selective ion monitoring, and the levels of the sulfidopeptide leukotrienes were determined using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay. LXA4 was detected in BAL fluid from nine of the 12 patients studied. The levels of LXA4 ranged from 0.4 to 2.8 ng/ml. LXA4 was not detected in any of the six normal subjects. Sulfidopeptide leukotrienes were detected in all the BAL samples, ranging from 0.04 to 0.7 ng/ml, and there was no significant difference between the patients and the normal subjects. In patients with detectable LXA4 in BAL fluid, the ratio of the concentrations of LXA4 to those of the sulfidopeptide leukotrienes ranged from 1.9 to 62 (mean, 19.0). This is the first demonstration of the presence of LXA4 in disease.\r"

We identified cases of familial diffuse panbronchiolitis and found that many siblings of the patients had paranasal sinusitis. Because of this, we performed HLA analysis of the patients with diffuse panbronchiolitis. In HLA Class I and Class II antigens, Bw54 significantly increased (frequency: 63.2%; RR = 13.30; corrected p value less than 1.08 x 10(-10], whereas Cw1 and MC1 (a new HLA-DR-related antigen) slightly increased. These increases might be explained by the fact that these two antigens, Cw1 and MC1, formed a haplotype with Bw54, which suggests that one or some of the genes controlling the susceptibility and/or immune responsiveness of diffuse panbronchiolitis might be located near HLA loci. In addition, Bw54, or its related haplotype, exists only in Japanese, Chinese, and Korean populations. This may explain why a similar disease had not been reported in the English literature.\r"

  ".W": "The adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is often characterized by a neutrophilic alveolitis, which may be mediated in part by the neutrophil chemoattractant, C5a. Chemotactic factor inactivator (CFI) can decrease C5a-directed neutrophil chemotaxis. Thus, a loss of CFI activity in the ARDS lung could lead to an increased ability of C5a to attract neutrophils. Lung CFI levels were measured antigenically and functionally in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid obtained from 29 patients with ARDS and in 14 normal control subjects. Antigenic levels of CFI were found to be markedly elevated in ARDS BAL fluid (1,855 +/- 437 ng/ml) compared with that in normal BAL (29 +/- 10 ng/ml, p less than 0.005), but, in contrast, CFI functional activity was markedly decreased in ARDS BAL fluid compared with that in normal BAL fluid (31 +/- 7% inhibition versus 76 +/- 5% inhibition, p less than 0.01). Furthermore, although purified CFI readily inhibited the ability of C5a to attract neutrophils (92% inhibition), this activity was decreased when BAL fluid from patients with ARDS was incubated with CFI (47 +/- 10%, p less than 0.01). These findings suggest that patients with ARDS are functionally deficient in CFI, leading to an increased ability of C5a to attract neutrophils.\r"

We examined the presence of PAF in pleural fluids from 23 patients with pleural effusion and in all cases detected PAF associated with eosinophil and/or neutrophil infiltrations. The amounts of PAF in pleural fluids were, respectively, 340, 50 to 170, and 1,250 to 2,130 fmol/ml for a patient with eosinophilic pneumonia, those with pneumothorax (n = 9), and empyema (n = 3). In contrast, patients with tuberculous pleuritis (n = 2), lung edema (n = 3), or malignant disease (n = 5) had no detectable amounts of pleural fluid PAF (less than or equal to 10 fmol/ml). The amount of PAF showed a close correlation with the numbers of eosinophils and neutrophils in the pleural fluids. Furthermore, PAF was mostly detected in the cellular fractions, and the molecular species of PAF from the patients with empyema were almost consistent with those of PAF generated by human blood neutrophils. These results indicate that neutrophils and, presumably, eosinophils were the cellular source of PAF in the pleural fluids in the pathologic state of inflammation.\r"

Evidence of CMV infection was sought in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, blood, saliva, and urine using a specific monoclonal antibody to antigens produced by CMV-infected cells within 24 h. Although CMV was detected in 31 (19%) of BAL fluid specimens, in only six episodes was this the sole pathologic finding. In the remaining episodes either another infectious agent, Kaposi's sarcoma, or lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis was found or no pathogen was detected. None of the patients were given specific anti-CMV treatment, and all but two recovered, including those patients in whom CMV was the sole finding at BAL. The presence of peripheral shedding of CMV did not have any significance in mortality or morbidity. Our findings are in direct contrast to those in recipients of allogeneic bone marrow transplants, in whom CMV pneumonitis is associated with a high mortality. We postulate that this difference is because AIDS patients cannot mount the destructive immune response to CMV in the lung, which we believe to be the basis of the pathology seen in the former group. We conclude that CMV is not a pathogen in the lungs of patients with HIV infection, and we suggest that its presence at this site does not warrant specific therapy in these patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

High tuberculosis rates have been documented in refugees, particularly among those from Asia and Africa, generating interest in tuberculosis control efforts. To assess the tuberculosis burden among Vietnamese refugees, we screened refugees within 1 or 2 days after arrival in camps in Thailand and in the Philippines. Refugees in camps in Thailand were screened with chest radiographs. Persons with radiographic findings consistent with tuberculosis received microscopic and culture examination of sputum specimens. The prevalence of bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis was 5.8 per 1,000 refugees. Males had a higher risk than females (relative risk RR = 1.7, 95% confidence interval CI = 1.2 to 2.4). Refugees in the Philippines were given a tuberculin skin test. An annual risk of infection of 2.2% was calculated for this group. Males had a higher risk of infection (RR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.5 to 2.4) than females. The age-specific prevalence of tuberculosis and the tuberculous infection increased with age. A high proportion of refugees (85%) with positive tuberculin skin tests were eligible for preventive therapy. Special efforts may be necessary to target Vietnamese refugees, as well as other persons originating from countries of high tuberculosis prevalence, for enhanced diagnostic and preventive intervention against tuberculosis to achieve the national goal of tuberculosis elimination by the year 2010.\r"

The cross-sectional study population of adults in Tucson, subjects of an ongoing study, was used. Most of the equations yielded reasonably similar distributions of percent predicted values. Older and/or more unusual equations did not yield similar results. Using the lower 95th percentile criteria yielded similar cutoff points as reference values for statistical normality, and similar proportions of statistically abnormal among various smoking and symptomatic groups; some of the equations used did not. When the criteria used were the lower 1.645 SEE, or the published criteria, the proportions considered statistically abnormal were very low or very high; again, some equations gave very disparate results. The first conclusion was that the use of the lower 95th percentile criteria was more sensitive and specific. It was concluded also that most equations yield sufficiently similar results such that the choice of reference equation from those available would depend on other criteria.\r"

However, it is difficult to separate out other causative factors, particularly cigarette smoking. In order to attempt to distinguish these factors, we examined 30 patients with silicosis by means of pulmonary function testing and computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest. Eighteen of these patients were either exsmokers or current smokers, and 12 of them were nonsmokers. The CT scans were read independently by two observers on two separate occasions. Silicosis was graded on a 5-point scale from 0 to 4; emphysema was graded as a percentage of lung involved. Percent emphysema was associated with level of pulmonary function (FEV1, FVC, and DLCO) independent of its association with either cigarette smoking or silicosis grade (p less than 0.01). Silicosis grade was associated with DLCO (p less than 0.05) independent of its association with either cigarette smoking or percent emphysema, but was not associated with level of FEV1 or FVC. In the group without PMF (silicosis Grade 0, 1, or 2), smokers had worse emphysema than nonsmokers (p less than 0.01); there was no such difference among the patients with PMF (silicosis Grade 3 or 4). Only one of the nonsmoking subjects with silicosis but without PMF had any emphysema detected on CT. Our data suggest that silicosis, in the absence of PMF, does not cause significant emphysema, and that it is primarily the degree of emphysema rather than the degree of silicosis that determines the level of pulmonary function.\r"

There was no correlation between the change in strength and efficiency and the degree of improvement in FEV1 following bronchodilator. However, there was a significant correlation with the fall in lung volume. To determine whether hyperinflation would result in a reduction in respiratory muscle strength and efficiency, we induced a mean increase in end-expiratory lung volume of 0.66 L by applying continuous negative pressure around the chest in 10 healthy individuals. This was associated with a significant fall in Plmax (from 110.5 +/- 9.4 to 100.5 +/- 8.93 cm H2O, p less than 0.001) and efficiency (from 4.2 +/- 0.6 to 2.6 +/- 0.5%, p less than 0.005).

The decrease in PImax in the CF group was primarily due to the mechanical disadvantage placed on the diaphragm by their marked hyperinflation, a mean RV/TLC ratio of 50 +/- 23%. As older CF subjects had previously been shown to have decreased RMS when malnourished, a CF subgroup in the same age range as the controls was evaluated. RMS in this group did not differ from controls despite the presence of malnutrition and hyperinflation. RMS is mildly influenced by nutritional status as assessed by BMP and PIWT but not to any degree of clinical significance.\r"

We found in contrast to the relatively constant subglottic pressure during normal conversational speech that speech in stutterers was characterized by failure to control Psg because of contraction of the diaphragm, rib cage, and abdominal muscles singly or in various combinations. As a result, Psg varied substantially and sometimes chaotically from too high to too low, rendering normal speech impossible. During periods of fluency, Psg was much better controlled. We conclude that incoordination of the respiratory muscles is a major problem in stuttering, resulting in failure to control the pressure difference across the vocal cords. It is unclear if this is a primary abnormality or is a secondary response to a primary abnormality elsewhere.\r"

Subjects were tested on two separate days following the double-blind, randomized administration of either placebo or codeine (90 mg). The intensity of the sensations of effort and discomfort experienced during two loaded breathing trials (a \"high\" load that was 73% of the maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) and a \"low\" load that was 63% of the MIP) was evaluated using category (Borg) scores on each day of study. To verify that the dosage of codeine administered was sufficient to produce analgesia, we also determined the effect of this dosage on the time that subjects could tolerate immersion of one hand in ice water. Codeine altered neither the perceived effort nor the sense of discomfort associated with breathing against external loads and had no appreciable effect on the time to exhaustion during loaded breathing trials. This dose of codeine did, however, increase the time that ice water immersion could be tolerated and reduced the rate at which the sense of discomfort increased over time during ice water trials. These results indicate that, provided the pressure-time index of respiratory muscle contraction remains constant, analgesic doses of codeine alter neither the sensations elicited by loaded breathing nor the total time that breathing against a fatiguing inspiratory load can be tolerated.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the influence of apnea type and sleep stage on the severity of apnea-induced desaturations in 32 patients with a sleep apnea syndrome. The individual postapneic desaturations were evaluated by a desaturation curve; this curve was built by plotting the fall in SaO2 after an apnea against this apnea's length for each apneic event during the whole night recording. We considered only apneas where the preapneic SaO2 was greater than 90% and the lowest SaO2 value after the apnea was equal to or greater than 60% (limit of linearity of our oximeter). From the desaturation curve, we determined a desaturation surface defined as the area under the curve between 10s and a variable apnea duration. The upper bound used for the determination of the desaturation curve and the desaturation surface was the maximal length of apnea type with the shortest apnea duration between non-REM obstructive apnea and the other apnea types (i.e., obstructive and central apnea, obstructive and mixed apnea, etc.). The desaturation surface was determined separately for non-REM sleep apneas (obstructive apneas, mixed apneas, central apneas, and obstructive apneas with persistent expiratory flow) and REM sleep apnea (all obstructive in type). Non-REM obstructive apneas served as reference to evaluate the severity of apnea-induced desaturations of the other apneas. We found that the desaturation surface of obstructive apnea (OA) with expiratory flow and of REM sleep OA were significantly greater than for OA in non-REM sleep (p less than or equal to 0.005). The OA-related desaturation was significantly greater than those of central apneas (p = 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It has been shown to be a respiratory stimulant in an anesthetized, glomectomized cat model. In this study, we examined the effects of two intraperitoneal single doses (10 and 20 mg/kg) of buspirone on sleep and respiration in unanesthetized, intact, freely moving rats. Buspirone increased sleep latency (p less than 0.0001) and decreased total sleep (p less than 0.02) through reductions in both non-REM and REM sleep. Respiratory rate (p less than 0.0003) and ventilation (p less than 0.004) were significantly increased for 4 h after drug injection. The effects on respiration were independent of those on sleep; stimulation was evident in both waking and non-REM sleep. This study suggests that buspirone, in addition to being free of sedating and respiratory depressant side effects when prescribed for anxiety in humans, may be a respiratory stimulant whose effects persist in sleep.\r"

The aim of this study was to quantitate alveolar septal cellularity in smokers' lungs and to investigate its relationship with parenchymal destruction and lung function. The lungs of 23 smokers (SS) undergoing thoracotomy for localized pulmonary lesions were compared with those of eight nonsmokers (NS) and five smokers (AS) who died suddenly of nonrespiratory causes. Pulmonary function tests were performed within 1 wk of surgery in SS. For each subject, we quantitated alveolar wall cells (CELLS), an index of alveolar wall destruction (DI), and the mean linear intercept (Lm). As no significant differences were found between S and AS with regard to these indices, we combined them (Group S) for comparison with NS. Although Lm was not significantly different between S and NS, (0.331 +/- 0.072 versus 0.288 +/- 0.038), CELLS and DI were higher in S than in NS (48 +/- 8 versus 25 +/- 2 cells/mm, p less than 0.001; 47 +/- 20 versus 17 +/- 5, p less than 0.001, respectively). Further, CELLS and DI were significantly correlated (r = 0.799, p less than 0.001). The number of polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) in S can exceed that in NS by as much as 5-fold; however, PMN were inversely correlated with parenchymal destruction (DI) (r = 0.598, p less than 0.01). Thus, smokers' lungs have alveolar septal hypercellularity, possibly inflammatory, and closely related to destruction involving cells other than the PMN.\r"

After 1, 3, 6, and 12 wk of drug feeding, both stains were examined for histologic evidence of pulmonary inflammation and for changes in lavage cell counts and differentials. The amounts of amiodarone and N-desethylamiodarone in the lungs were determined using high performance liquid chromatography. We found that in drug-fed Wistar rats the lavage differentials were unchanged, lavage cell counts were decreased compared with those in control rats, and the lungs appeared normal except for some foamy macrophages. Wistar rats also had low levels of amiodarone and metabolite in both lung tissue and cells. In contrast, Fischer rats had an increase in lavage lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages compared with that in control rats and abnormal lung histologies. Also, there was much more drug and metabolite in the lungs than the amounts found in Wistar rats. Because Fischer rats had more metabolite than amiodarone in the lung and the reverse was true in Wistar rats, the in vitro cytotoxicity of amiodarone and N-desethylamiodarone were compared. We found that N-desethylamiodarone was significantly more cytotoxic than amiodarone to both fibroblasts and endothelial cells. We conclude that there is a relationship between the amounts of drug and metabolite in the lung and the development of pulmonary inflammation, and that N-desethylamiodarone may be more cytotoxic than amiodarone.\r"

[3H]QNB was incubated with tissue sections for 90 min at 25 degrees C, and nonspecific binding was determined by incubating adjacent serial sections in the presence of 1 microM atropine. Binding to lung sections had the characterization expected for muscarinic receptors. Autoradiography revealed that muscarinic receptors were widely distributed in human lung, with dense labeling over submucosal glands and airway ganglia, and moderate labeling over nerves in intrapulmonary bronchi and of airway smooth muscle of large and small airways. In addition, alveolar walls were uniformly labeled. In guinea pig lung, labeling of airway smooth muscle was similar, but in contrast to human airways, epithelium was labeled but alveolar walls were not. The muscarinic receptors of human airway smooth muscle from large to small airways were entirely of the M3-subtype, whereas in guinea pig airway smooth muscle, the majority were the M3-subtype with a very small population of the M2-subtype present. In human bronchial submucosal glands, M1- and M3-subtypes appeared to coexist in the proportions of 36 and 64%, respectively. In human alveolar walls the muscarinic receptors were entirely of the M1-subtype, which is absent from the guinea pig lung. No M2-receptors were demonstrated in human lung. The localization of M1-receptors was confirmed by direct labeling with [3H]pirenzepine. With the exception of the alveolar walls in human lung, the localization of muscarinic receptor subtypes on structures in the lung is consistent with known functional studies.\r"

  ".W": "Upper airway collapsibility may be influenced by both muscular and nonmuscular factors. Because mucosal blood volume (and therefore vascular tone) is an important determinant of nasal airway patency, vascular tone may be an important nonmuscular determinant of pharyngeal collapsibility. This hypothesis was tested in two experimental models. First, upper airway closing (CP) and opening (OP) pressures and static compliance were measured in nine anesthetized, sinoaortic-denervated, paralyzed cats with isolated upper airways. Vascular tone was decreased with either papaverine or sodium nitroprusside (NTP), and increased with phenylephrine (PE), whereas blood pressure and end-tidal CO2 were maintained constant. Vasodilation increased CP (control = -10.4 +/- 1.3, NTP = -7.3 +/- 1.2 cm H2O; p less than 0.05) and OP (control = -7.9 +/- 1.5, NTP = -3.3 +/- 1.8 cm H2O; p less than 0.05). In contrast, vasoconstriction tended to decrease CP (control = -10.7 +/- 1.5, PE = -11.7 +/- 1.4 cm H2O; p less than 0.09) and OP (control = -8.1 +/- 1.2, PE = -9.9 +/- 1.9 cm H2O; p less than 0.1). Thus, vasodilation increased and vasoconstriction tended to decrease upper airway collapsibility. Upper airway static compliance was unchanged during either drug infusion. In order to assess changes in pharyngeal cross-sectional area (CSA) that occurred during vasodilation, magnetic resonance imaging was utilized in seven cats. During vasodilation with NTP, pharyngeal CSA was reduced from 0.44 +/- 0.10 to 0.30 +/- 0.09 cm2 (p less than 0.05), and pharyngeal volume was reduced from 15.3 +/- 2.4 to 13.9 +/- 2.7 cm3 (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Concentration of any substance in the air of a room is determined by the ratio between the rates of its production and removal. Thus, high concentrations can result from high production, low removal, or a combination of the two. Air filtration can supplement ventilation in removing allergens from the air. Control of aeroallergen exposure at any particular location would be more rational and effective if the contribution of production, ventilation, and filtration were known. Using immunochemical assays for rat urinary protein allergen, we measured the rate of production by individual rats and the concentration of allergens in the air of rat animal quarters where the ventilation rate was about 15 changes per hour. We introduced two different high-efficiency filtration systems that provided additional clean air changes up to a maximum of 127 changes per hour. Male rats shed about 20 ng/min of allergen. Because of this high rate of production, substantial reduction in rooms that housed large numbers of animals required the very high air-exchange rates that were achieved with laminar flow small animal isolator racks. Measured concentrations agreed well with concentrations calculated from a mass balance equation whose terms included numbers of animals in the room, production rate by individual animals, and rates of ventilation and filtration. We suggest that this principle of considering both production and removal rates applies not only to devising means of reducing levels of rat allergens in rat rooms, but generally to other indoor allergens as well.\r"

There was an associated splenic vein thrombosis with left-sided portal hypertension. The pancreatic neoplasm was treated by excision, including the caudal 85 per cent of the pancreas and spleen. The gastric carcinoids appeared to diminish in size in response to a octreotide acetate (Sandostatin, Sandoz Pharmaceuticals; Hanover, NJ) administered to promote closure of a low-volume postoperative pancreatic fistula. The gastric lesions may require surgical treatment in the future.

The patient we describe had recurrences of a gastric leiomyoblastoma 15 and 17 years, respectively, after the initial gastric resection. Subsequently, multiple pulmonary lesions were excised and confirmed to be chondromas, but no evidence of a paraganglioma has yet been identified. Gastric leiomyoblastomas in patients with Carney's triad frequently recur; however, the prognosis is quite favorable in contrast to that of sporadic cases. Whenever a patient with one of the classical lesions of Carney's triad is encountered, the possibility of this unusual syndrome should be considered.

These patients, five women who were long-term users of oral contraceptives and one man who had never taken steroid medication, presented with right upper quadrant abdominal pain of variable degree and duration. The cardiovascular status of these patients was also variable, ranging from a normal blood pressure, which allowed an orderly workup, and planned resection of the tumor to hypovolemic shock requiring emergency laparotomy for control of hemorrhage. The extent of surgery depended on the location and the number of adenomas, with the goal being to resect the adenoma and control hemorrhage while preserving as much normal liver parenchyma as possible. The treatment of choice in this disease is resection of the tumor with a margin of normal liver parenchyma. In those cases in which that is not practical, resectional debridement has proven to be an effective alternative.\r"

Blunt trauma was the etiology of pseudocyst formation in 69 per cent of children with 50 per cent resulting from the abdomen impacting bicycle handlebars. Chronic pancreatitis is an uncommon cause of pseudocyst formation in children. Medical therapy is directed towards reduction of pancreatic stimulation and nutritional support, which are maintained through pseudocyst resolution or maturation. Pseudocysts spontaneously resolved in 25 per cent of patients. Complications occurred in 25 per cent during nonoperative management. Children may safely undergo internal drainage earlier than adults (3-4 weeks vs 6 weeks). Internal drainage by cystoenterostomy was curative in eight patients. Persistent fistula drainage developed for five weeks in one patient who had surgical external pseudocyst drainage. One patient required distal pancreatectomy for a transected pancreatic duct. Spontaneous resolution of psseudocysts while on medical therapy is more frequent in children than in adults, and major complications (abscess formation, hemorrhage, and fistula formation) are usually not encountered. Pseudocyst rupture is the major complication of conservative management. We had no pseudocyst recurrences and 11 of 12 children treated surgically were discharged home within ten days of operation.\r"

To address this issue a questionnaire was sent to all members of the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus. Most respondents see one or two cases of vertical head posture yearly and use observation as their primary therapy. When surgery is indicated, a graded bilateral vertical rectus recession or combined vertical rectus recession-resection procedure are usually done. Most respondents see no cases of torsional head posture yearly, and an overwhelming majority observe these patients. No one surgical procedure was advocated by most of the responding surgeons.\r"

Fifty-seven of 120 patients (48%) had both precapsulotomy and one-year post-capsulotomy angiograms done. Of these 57 patients, three eyes had angiographic CME before capsulotomy and two of these three cases had persistent CME one year after capsulotomy. In the other 54 patients, three new late-onset cases occurred (5.6%). Because the incidence of postcapsulotomy new CME was low, the statistical significance of possible risk factors, such as rupture of the anterior hyaloid face or pseudophakic status cannot be determined. However, aphakic patients with vitreous prolapse after capsulotomy tended to have a higher incidence to CME than pseudophakic patients. We recommend fluorescein angiography to identify occult CME in cases of unexplained visual-acuity decrease after capsulotomy.\r"

Ten patients who had persistent otorrhea were found to have monilial infection as a cause of the ear disease. None of the patients were immunosuppressed or immunocompromised. Nine of the 10 patients (one was lost to follow-up) were treated with antifungal medication, and the effectiveness of ketoconazole therapy is evaluated. None of the children in this series had systemic candidiasis.

Associated findings included cervical adenopathy, sinusitis, and otitis media. The two remaining children had an intratracheal and paratracheal mass, respectively. Excision of obstructing lymphoid tissue with proper handling of the specimen is advocated for diagnosis and relief of airway obstruction. Systemic therapy is necessary for treatment of PTLD and includes reduction of immunosuppression.

Only three patients developed mild generalized skin photosensitive reactions, and these did not affect subsequent treatment. There was no immunosuppressive effect as evidenced by a tritium-labeled thymidine-incorporated lymphocytoblast transformation assay performed both before and after PRT.

Differences in EMG activity between the control group and the patient group were considered with respect to the clinical symptoms in the patient group. Recording of EMG in the CP and IC muscles is relatively safe, useful, and easily mastered. The technique may provide important information regarding the function of some of the muscles involved in deglutition.\r"

In 11 animals that developed endolymphatic hydrops, auditory thresholds as monitored by auditory evoked action potentials had increased with recruitment. Most of these animals also experienced episodes of spontaneous nystagmus. In control ears endolymphatic pressure did not differ more than 0.5 cm H2O from perilymphatic pressure. In six of 11 hydropic ears, endolymphatic pressure was more than 0.5 cm H2O higher than perilympathic pressure; auditory thresholds in all these ears had deteriorated within 2 weeks before pressure recording. No further hearing deterioration within this period was noted in five hydropic ears with endolymphatic pressure equal to or lower than perilymphatic pressure. Endolympathic-perilymphatic pressure gradients may contribute to auditory threshold increase in endolymphatic hydrops, but are not its only cause.\r"

We took measurements in both groups at an interval of 4 months to ensure that any improvement in body sway could not be attributed to normal maturation. Eight parameters of body sway were compared, including three new parameters not described elsewhere (mean squared velocity, the number of intersections, and velocity moment). Our study showed that balance is significantly worse in children with chronic secretory otitis media compared to a control group. Furthermore, the increased body sway of children with chronic secretory otitis media was returned to the normal range by myringotomy and insertion of ventilation tubes.\r"

However, the generalizability of these findings is limited because most studies have focused on treated samples; thus, these studies may have been biased toward more chronic or severe illnesses. In prospectively surveying a large probability sample of the general population, the Epidemiologic Catchment Area program offers the opportunity to investigate prognosis without selection bias. In this study, the Epidemiologic Catchment Area subjects with a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder at first interview (n = 423) were categorized according to their diagnostic status 1 year later. The results confirmed a high rate of nonrecovery, with clinical features associated with a poor outcome that resembled those identified in previous clinical studies. Overall, clinical factors were more important prognostically than were sociodemographic characteristics. However, there was some evidence that a poorer outcome in older women may partially explain the greater female prevalence of depression in the community.\r"

In the present study, 697 relatives of psychiatric patients and healthy controls were interviewed with the Structured Interview for Personality Disorders (SIDP) and completed the Personality Disorders Questionnaire (PDQ). Significantly more individuals had a personality disorder according to the SIDP; however, multiple personality disorders were more frequently diagnosed on the PDQ. Schizotypal, compulsive, dependent, and borderline personality disorders were significantly more frequently diagnosed by the PDQ, whereas the SIDP more frequently diagnosed antisocial and passive-aggressive personality disorder. The corresponding dimensional scores of the two measures were all significantly correlated; however, the concordance for categorical diagnoses was poor. Discrepancies between the PDQ and the SIPD dimensional scores were significantly associated with current level of depressive symptoms and PDQ lie scale scores.\r"

In the placebo condition, the subjects with PTSD showed a 30% decrease in reported pain intensity ratings of standardized heat stimuli after the combat videotape. No decrease in pain ratings occurred in the subjects with PTSD in the naloxone condition. The subjects without PTSD did not show a decrease in pain ratings in either condition.

Cerebrospinal fluid neuropeptide Y concentrations were significantly elevated in underweight anorectic patients and in many of the anorectic patients studied at intervals after weight restoration. These levels normalized in long-term weight-restored anorectic patients who had a return of normal menstrual cycles. Increased neuropeptide Y activity may contribute to several characteristic disturbances in anorexia, including menstrual dysregulation. Cerebrospinal fluid peptide YY concentrations were significantly elevated in normal-weight bulimic patients abstinent from pathological eating behavior for a month compared with themselves when actively bingeing and vomiting or compared with healthy volunteers. Increased peptide YY activity may contribute to a drive to overfeed in normal-weight bulimic patients.\r"

A circadian rhythm of the plasma HVA level was found in controls with a nadir in the afternoon and peak values in the early morning hours; when the patients were free from drugs, they showed a similar rhythm with lower amplitudes. Fluphenazine treatment significantly reduced the plasma concentrations of HVA and abolished the 24-hour rhythm. These data suggest that a 24-hour rhythm of the plasma HVA level exists in humans and that the amplitude of this rhythm may be less pronounced in patients with schizophrenia. Treatment with neuroleptic drugs reduces both the absolute levels and the normal circadian rhythm of the plasma HVA level.\r"

With eyes covered, subjects listened to a tape that presented white noise, \"beep\" prompts, and questions about subjective effects of cocaine or saline. Cocaine produced euphoria and reduced glucose utilization globally (mean reduction, 14%). Twenty-six of 29 brain regions (all neocortical areas, basal ganglia, portions of the hippocampal formation, thalamus, and midbrain) showed significant decrements (5% to 26%) in the regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose. No significant effects of cocaine were observed in the pons, the cerebellar cortex, or the vermis. Right-greater-than-left hemispheric asymmetry of regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose occurred in the lateral thalamus.

Although evaluation techniques are available to measure a patient's ability to appreciate moving touch (MT), no test is available to assess appreciation of sustained touch-pressure (STP). A new device, designed to apply constant stimuli of known intensity, was developed and used to evaluate STP appreciation in an experimental and a control group. The experimental group consisted of six patients with severe sensory deficits due to cortical dysfunction. Each subject was evaluated for STP appreciation on the tip of the index finger of the affected side of the body. The results showed that five of the patients had some STP appreciation; the sixth had none. Furthermore, in the patient group, STP appreciation faded with time; appreciation was much greater four and six seconds after the stimulus onset than it was after 18 to 20 seconds. In the control group the sensation did not fade away. The lowest weight tested (23 g) was seldom detected by three of the five patients although it was readily sensed by all healthy individuals. An unexpected finding was that the 350-g weight was more difficult to appreciate for three of the five subjects than were the 150-g and 250-g weights. This experiment demonstrated that STP, an important component of sensation, can be evaluated quickly and accurately in the clinical environment and that the magnitude of the deficit in STP is correlated with the severity of the disability in the patient seeking physiotherapy.\r"

Peak and average torques did not vary significantly or systematically over the three test occasions. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), based on one occasion, ranged from 0.79 to 0.91 for peak torques and from 0.75 to 0.88 for average torques. At 45 degrees/sec angular velocity, the ICCs for peak torque tended to be greater than those for average torque, whereas at 90 degrees/sec angular velocity the ICCs were similar whether calculated using peak or average torque. The ICCs during knee extension were greater than those during knee flexion. Eccentric muscle actions produced significantly higher torques than did concentric actions (p less than 0.01). A continuous concentric-eccentric cycle protocol which emphasizes teaching the subject to perform the test maneuvers and using at least three submaximal practice contractions and one maximal practice contraction can produce reliable isokinetic torques.\r"

This study evaluated the symmetry of the quadriceps and hamstrings musculature in postsurgical and contralateral normal limbs of subjects who had undergone one of two types of ACL reconstruction. Subjects were also evaluated for differences on selected isokinetic parameters between types of surgery and lengths of postoperative periods. Postsurgical and normal contralateral limbs of 46 subjects aged 18 to 49 years (mean, 23.7 years) were divided into groups according to type of autogenous intraarticular ACL substitute and length of postoperative period. Results of paired t-tests and analyses of variance indicated significant asymmetries between limbs for all measures of quadriceps and hamstrings musculature strength and endurance (p less than .001) irrespective of the type of reconstruction technique. Average surgical knee deficits in hamstrings endurance were significantly less for the long-term (41 to 101 months) follow-up group (1.9%) than for the intermediate (24 to 40 months) group (12.1%). The results suggest that extended periods of time are required to approximate hamstrings endurance symmetry after ACL reconstruction. Asymmetries between postsurgical and contralateral normal limbs in these subjects may reflect either incomplete rehabilitation or an inability to regain full isokinetic strength and endurance after ACL reconstruction.\r"

However, there have been few empirical studies of the relationship between social variables and functional gain. Functional assessment data for 66 pediatric patients admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation program were analyzed. Regressing residual gain scores on social variables from the Patient Evaluation and Conference System (a patient tracking data base) showed significance (p less than .01) in pediatric functional gain. Patients whose families were less able to support their independent living before admission made the greatest functional gains. Family support for disabled pediatric patients affected functional gain, affirming the importance of rehabilitation professionals' involvement with the patient's social needs throughout the rehabilitation process.\r"

Electromyographic (EMG) data were collected bilaterally from the tibialis anterior (TA) and gastrocnemius (G) muscles, and electrogoniometric data monitored joint angle changes in the ankle. Analysis of the data indicated initial EMG responses in the G of the perturbed limb and the TA of the contralateral limb at latencies of approximately 100 msec. It appeared that G activity served to decelerate the dorsiflexion of the ankle of the perturbed limb, whereas the TA accelerated dorsiflexion in the swing limb. Analysis of later EMG activity and foot-ground contact indicated that recovery after perturbation was easily completed during stance of the perturbed limb. Because of the comparatively minimal degree and velocity of displacement, further study with similar protocols might be considered appropriate to study balance problems in clinical populations.\r"

Two groups of able-bodied older adults were presented with either knee and ankle joint angle feedback or quadriceps electromyographic feedback over four identical sessions. Records were kept of performance relative to the targets set for amplitude, timing, and for both parameters together. Results indicated that able-bodied subjects could modify the amplitude and timing of movements in the presence of feedback; they also suggested that the use of this approach in the reeducation of pathologic gait patients should be explored.\r"

Forty subjects completed 18 training sessions in six weeks according to one of the following regimens: (1) 20 minutes of aerobic arm ergometer training at 50% of peak oxygen consumption determined during arm ergometry; (2) isotonic strength and endurance training of the upper extremities with free weights; or (3) axillary crutching at self-selected speeds for 20 minutes on a rectangular indoor course. In comparison with a control group that did not do any systematic training, all three training groups significantly increased their self-selected ACW speeds after training. This also resulted in a significant increase in their heart rates during ambulation. However, no significant changes were observed in oxygen consumption at the faster ACW speeds, suggesting that the training regimens were effective in improving the metabolic efficiency of ACW. Ratings of perceived exertion were significantly lowered for the three training groups even though cardiorespiratory stress was significantly elevated. No significant differences were observed between the three training programs for any of the variables examined. Since heart rate is a reliable indicator of myocardial oxygen uptake, it was recommended that (1) individuals should be screened for cardiovascular problems before axillary crutches are prescribed as a mode of ambulation, and (2) they should be advised to reduce the speed of ambulation because of the high degree of cardiovascular stress associated with this activity.\r"

Eighteen subjects (aged 8.3 +/- 2.83 years) ambulated five minutes at freely chosen velocities with and without their AFOs. Heart rate (beats per minute) and distance (meters) ambulated were recorded for each minute. A physiologic cost index was calculated by determining the ratio of walking heart rate to velocity [(HRamb-HRrest) divided by meters per minute]. The mean physiologic cost indexes for the last three minutes of ambulation with and without orthoses were 1.34 +/- 0.69 beats per meter and 1.51 +/- 0.79 beats per meter, respectively (p less than 0.05). Ambulation heart rate, velocity and total distance traveled were not statistically different between the two trials. The results indicated that energy expenditure of ambulation at self-selected speeds in spastic diplegic children was reduced by the application of conventional AFOs. However, each child should be evaluated on a single-case basis because of individual differences.\r"

All quadriplegics had complete motor loss below the lesion level and were at least two years postinjury. Tests were performed with subjects seated. Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1.0), inspiratory capacity (IC), and maximum inspiratory mouth pressure (Pimax) were measured. Resting breathing pattern was assessed for 20 minutes using mercury in rubber strain gauges and a computer-assisted data acquisition and analysis program. Inspiratory time (Ti), expiratory time (Te), and tidal volume (Vt) were measured, and the remaining timing components were calculated from these values. The variability of breathing was assessed by comparing the coefficients of variation of each variable. The FVC, IC, and Pimax were significantly reduced; Vt was significantly lower (p less than 0.01) and frequency significantly elevated (p less than 0.05) in quadriplegics. The decreased Vt in quadriplegics was due entirely to a significantly decreased mean inspiratory flow (p less than 0.01); Ti was the same in quadriplegics as in controls. The ratio of mean Ti to total cycle time (Ti/Ttot) was significantly longer in quadriplegics (p less than 0.005). There was no difference in variability of breathing between the two groups for any timing component of ventilation. There was no significant difference in sighing frequency between groups for either breaths greater than 2x mean Vt or breaths greater than 3x mean Vt. Chronic quadriplegics demonstrated a rapid, shallow breathing pattern, probably due to the mechanical restrictions resulting from paralysis of the thorax musculature. They retained the ability to sigh, suggesting that chest wall afferents may not be required in this process.\r"

The program was designed to include equal volumes of both aerobic and neuromuscular training to increase the subjects' oxidative capacity and simultaneously improve their locomotor efficiency. Before and after the experimental training program, height, weight, blood pressure, skinfold thickness, grip strength, abdominal muscular endurance, and submaximal and peak rates of oxygen consumption were measured, and the index of physiological fatigue was calculated. The TBI patients manifested subnormal oxidative capacities and above-average oxygen costs locomotion. A 16-week circuit training program of moderate intensity and prolonged duration increased their oxidative capacity (p less than .01) and abdominal muscular endurance (p less than .01), but failed to reduce their oxygen cost of walking. Moderate and prolonged activity seems beneficial in the comprehensive rehabilitation of patients with TBI. The index of physiologic fatigability seems to be useful for the assessment, evaluation, and vocational placement of individuals with TBI.\r"

It was found that the required ranges of motion for the feeding tasks were 5 degrees to 45 degrees shoulder flexion, 5 degrees to 35 degrees shoulder abduction, 5 degrees to 25 degrees shoulder internal rotation, 70 degrees to 130 degrees elbow flexion, from 40 degrees forearm pronation to 60 degrees forearm supination, from 10 degrees wrist flexion to 25 degrees wrist extension, and from 20 degrees wrist ulnar deviation to 5 degrees wrist radial deviation.

Physical examination can be indistinguishable from that of a simple wrist sprain, and standard radiographic evaluations are frequently normal. Early diagnosis is critical, since late treatment is often simple observation of the natural history of the disease, which includes progressive collapse of the lunate and derangement of the carpal architecture. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) produces images of high contrast, demarcating necrotic from normal bone. We present a case of lunate AVN (\"Kienbock's disease\") to illustrate the ability of MRI to identify necrotic bone in the wrist. We suggest that MRI is useful in diagnosing AVN in the wrist and that it may allow an earlier diagnosis of lunate AVN than is possible with standard radiographs.\r"

Objective evaluation of gastrointestinal function, ie, colonic transit time and anorectal manometry, was performed in six patients with chronic gastrointestinal complaints to identify the site and severity of bowel dysfunction. Twelve patients had colostomy performed for chronic gastrointestinal problems, seven as an adjunct in the treatment of perineal pressure ulcers, and one for rectal cancer. When patients with difficult bowel evacuation or incontinence were considered, colostomy reliably simplified bowel care, relieved abdominal distention, and prevented fecal incontinence. The amount of time spent on bowel care decreased from an average of 98.6 min/day to 17.8 min/day (p less than .05) after colostomy. When performed as an adjunct in the treatment of pressure ulcers, colostomy provided a dry, clean environment, and seven of seven ulcers healed. Colostomy was well accepted by all patients; all patients with chronic gastrointestinal complaints reported that colostomy improved the quality of their lives. Objective testing differentiated between failure of the colon to adequately transport material to the rectum and inability to adequately evacuate the rectum. Testing was useful in choosing the level at which a colostomy was created, and, in one instance, it identified a specific syndrome (ischemic proctitis) which required colostomy.\r"

A questionnaire was mailed to 83 ILCs that are listed in the ILRU Registry of Independent Living Programs and that reported having a relationship with one or more MRPs. Subsequently, another questionnaire was sent to the MRPs with which each ILC reported having a relationship. Usable questionnaires were received from 46 ILCs. In descending order, the most frequently reported relationships were (1) making referrals to or supplying information about MRPs, (2) providing peer counseling services, and (3) conducting training in daily living skills for medical rehabilitation patients. Mean ratings of satisfaction with the various kinds of relationships were relatively high. The three most frequently endorsed barriers to stronger relationships were conflicting approaches or styles of service delivery, funding of services, and conflicting program philosophies. Using information from a database describing ILCs, it was found that ILCs with MRP relationships served significantly more consumers than centers not having such relationships. According to results provided by 25 MRPs, patients with spinal cord injury most frequently received services by staff members of ILCs, with peer counseling being the most frequently provided service.\r"

Her EEG was negative, and she had no clinical evidence of complex partial seizures, which have been described in association with this disorder. Only after a process of careful history taking and the establishment of a therapeutic alliance with the patient was the diagnosis established.

  ".W": "Prior to undertaking a study in sighted human eyes, we performed photorefractive keratectomy with the 193-nm excimer laser for the correction of myopia in nine legally blind eyes to evaluate safety, efficacy, predictability, and stability. In most cases, reepithelialization was complete by 5 days after surgery; no recurrent erosions were seen. By the end of the 6-month study, all of the corneas had a 0 or 1+ clarity score, on a scale of 0 (clear) to 5+ (opaque). Keratometry and pachometry demonstrated stable flattening of the corneas. One month after surgery, changes in refraction evaluated by retinoscopy showed fair predictability, with no significant increase in refractive or keratometric astigmatism, followed by some regression of effect by the end of the study, possibly caused by anatomical remodeling. The amount of regression appeared to be directly related to the amount of correction intended, suggesting that this effect would not be clinically important in the treatment of mild to moderate myopia.\r"

One patient was found to have occlusion of the straight sinus and large collateral veins at the base of the brain, presumably due to venous sinus thrombosis, supporting the concept of vascular compression of the facial nerve at its exit from the brain stem as a mechanism for the production of hemifacial spasm. The other patients each had an intrinsic mass compressing the fourth ventricle, located in the lower pons and extending into the cerebellar vermis and right cerebellar peduncle in one; in the other patient, the mass involved the cerebellar vermis and right middle cerebellar peduncle alone. These patients widen the etiologic spectrum of the syndrome and show that serious intracranial diseases may underlie hemifacial spasm in infancy.\r"

The fibrinogen was prepared from autologous blood by a cryoprecipitate technique. When mixed with commercially available thrombin, a fibrin clot develops with sufficient adhesive strength that the need for extensive suturing is obviated. Complications were few, and due to technical factors in the initial cases, all patients were followed up for at least 1 year. Problems associated with suture closure of wounds (eg, cysts, granulomas, milia) were not seen. The fibrin glue not only sealed the wound but also acted as a hemostatic agent. The autologous preparation is superior to commercial products since it avoids the problem of transfusion-transmitted disease. The fibrin glue and minimal suture technique is an alternative to eyelid incision closure and may be useful in many other types of operative procedures.\r"

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies are helpful laboratory markers for these disease. We report on the ocular findings of six patients with systemic vasculitis who had antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Four patients had systemic Wegener's granulomatosis, one had microscopic polyarteritis, and in one a specific histopathologic diagnosis could not be made. Two patients were first evaluated for systemic vasculitis because of their ocular manifestations. Ocular findings included ptosis, bilateral lacrimal gland masses, proptosis, choroidal folds, episcleritis, phlebitis, retinal and vitreous hemorrhage, keratitis sicca, and bilateral central scotomas. It was difficult to make a systemic diagnosis in all cases. If systemic vasculitis is in the differential diagnosis of a patient with suggestive ocular findings, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody testing should be considered. A prospective study of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody testing should be considered in patients with ocular findings that suggest the possibility of vasculitis.\r"

Control eyes were compared with eyes treated with five different strategies 24 hours after bacterial inoculation: intravitreal cefazolin sodium, intravitreal cefazolin plus intramuscular corticosteroid, vitrectomy plus intravitreal antibiotics, vitrectomy plus intravitreal antibiotics and intramuscular corticosteroids, and vitrectomy plus intravitreal antibiotics and corticosteroids. Quantitative grading of inflammation and media clarity were compared at the end of weeks 1, 2, and 3 after treatment. At week 1, eyes treated with vitrectomy had significantly lower inflammatory scores; those treated with corticosteroids had significantly lower scores than those without. The two effects were independent. The best results were observed with treatment consisting of vitrectomy, intraocular antibiotics, and corticosteroids. This strategy also produced significantly more eyes with clear media at the end of week 3 than treatment with intravitreal antibiotics alone.\r"

Brachytherapy was delivered by means of miniature iodine 125 seeds implanted in shallow subcutaneous pockets of the upper eyelid margin of these mice, and 25 Gy of radiation was delivered between days 12 and 14. This brachytherapy reduced both the tumor volume and the number of mitotic figures per high-power field compared with irradiated controls. In a second experiment, 25 Gy of brachytherapy was delivered before enucleation, straddling enucleation, and after enucleation; there was a significant reduction in metastasis when radiation was delivered prior to enucleation. This model may be useful in conducting further studies involving brachytherapy with 125I plaque implants.\r"

Basic fibroblast growth factor levels ranged from undetectable to 52 ng/mL. In patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, basic fibroblast growth factor levels were greater than or equal to 30 ng/mL in 8 of 17 specimens. Of the 8 patients with elevated basic fibroblast growth factor levels, 6 had evidence of active proliferative disease (ie, neovascularization of the disc or iris), whereas in the patients who had undetectable levels only 2 of 9 had evidence of neovascularization of disc and none had neovascularization of the iris. In the rhegmatogenous retinal detachment group, 2 of 10 eyes had elevated basic fibroblast growth factor levels, while none in the macular pucker group had elevated levels. Our study documents increased levels of basic fibroblast growth factor in vitreous specimens from patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, particularly those with active proliferative retinopathy. The role of basic fibroblast growth factor in the pathogenesis of various retinal disease entities is discussed.\r"

On days 1, 3, and 7, cell proliferation was evaluated by cell number counting and by DNA synthesis analysis. Hyperthermia gave statistically significant suppression of cell growth above 43 degrees C heat treatment and absolute cell number reduction above 44 degrees C on the seventh day. Deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis was significantly suppressed with 43 degrees C for 60 minutes or above 44 degrees C heat treatment.

We also examined selected tissues with scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Immediate and subsequent examinations revealed significant differences in clarity between the two groups. When viewed through slit-lamp microscopy, the rabbits undergoing the en face method exhibited hazy corneas and irregular surfaces, whereas the corneas that underwent tangential keratectomy demonstrated less haze and fewer surface irregularities. Through histologic study and electron microscopy, we corroborated this finding. At 30 days, there was a statistically significant difference in clarity between en face--treated corneas and those treated tangentially.\r"

Of the three solutions, normal saline showed the highest permeability index and glucose glutathione bicarbonate solution showed the lowest. The effects of oxidized glutathione on the blood-aqueous barrier were also studied, using solutions containing various concentrations of oxidized glutathione. The permeability index for the solution containing 0.3 mmol/L of oxidized glutathione was significantly smaller than that for the solution without oxidized glutathione, suggesting that oxidized glutathione has a beneficial effect on the integrity of the blood-aqueous barrier.\r"

Sera from FIV-infected cats precipitated two glycoproteins (gp) of Mr 120kD (gp120) and 41kD (gp41) from lysates of [14C]glucosamine-labelled infected cells. Purified virus contained very little or no detectable glycoproteins. The serological response to individual viral proteins was followed in experimentally infected cats by immunoblotting. Since purified virus was a poor source of gp120, a method using FIV-infected cell lysates was developed. Cats produced antibodies to gp120, p55, p24 and p17. (The p55 was presumed to be a precursor of p24 and p17.) Following infection, antibodies developed first to p24 and subsequently to p17, p55 and gp120. Sera from cats infected with three separate isolates of FIV, two from the UK and one from the USA, had cross-reacting antibodies to all of these viral proteins. The criteria for identification of seropositive cats were defined. The minimum requirement for a positive immunoblot was antibody to gp120 or to at least three core proteins (p55, p24 and p17). Comparison of two commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits and immunoblotting indicated that false-positive results occurred as a result of non-specific reactions in the ELISA systems.\r"

  ".W": "Zidovudine is the only drug currently approved for the treatment of HIV infection. The present recommended doses found to be efficacious in patients with AIDS (200 mg every 4 h) achieve serum zidovudine concentrations greater than 0.267 micrograms/ml (1 mumol/l). Since patients often take zidovudine with food, we have investigated the effect of a liquid high-fat meal on the rate of absorption of zidovudine and on the peak serum concentration achieved. Eight patients received their usual dose of zidovudine (100 mg or 250 mg), with and without a liquid high-fat meal, on two separate study days, in a randomized crossover fashion. Blood and urine samples were collected over a 4-h period. In the absence of food, zidovudine is rapidly absorbed; the time to reach maximal serum concentration (Tmax) was 0.68 (+/- 0.25) h and the mean peak serum concentration (Cmax) achieved was 0.49 (+/- 0.3) micrograms/ml (dose normalized to 100 mg dose). In the presence of a high-fat meal, Tmax was significantly prolonged [1.95 (+/- 0.69) h; P less than 0.05] and the Cmax reduced [0.245 (+/- 0.12) micrograms/ml; P less than 0.05]. This demonstrates that to achieve maximal zidovudine serum concentrations, patients should take this medication on an empty stomach.\r"

Herpes zoster, Kaposi's sarcoma and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia were early manifestations, whereas diseases caused by cytomegalovirus and atypical mycobacteria tended to occur later in the course of AIDS. Compared with all other AIDS patients, homosexual men were more likely to develop Kaposi's sarcoma, cytomegalovirus chorioretinitis and mucocutaneous herpes simplex virus infection. The proportion of patients who developed particular diseases changed with calendar time. Most striking was a three to fourfold decrease in diseases caused by cytomegalovirus. In conclusion, the study showed that disease frequencies in patients with AIDS may vary with the patients risk behaviour and duration of AIDS, and that the frequencies of particular diseases may change with calendar time.\r"

The clinical records of those patients with AIDS with cerebrovascular disease were retrospectively examined in detail. All autopsied patients between the ages of 20 and 50 years dying without AIDS in 1986 and 1987 served as the control group. At autopsy, 13 (8%) of 154 adult patients with AIDS had evidence of recent cerebrovascular disease. In comparison, 25 (23%) of the 111 control patients dying without AIDS had recent cerebrovascular disease (P less than 0.04). The spectrum of cerebrovascular diseases was similar in patients both with and without AIDS; however, cerebral vasculitis was observed only in the former. Thirty-nine (40%) of 97 patients with AIDS had significant cardiac disease, and cerebral emboli were demonstrated in four of the 13 patients with stroke. Stroke must be considered in the differential diagnosis of neurological disease in patients with AIDS, although it does not appear to be more common in this group than in a control population of young adults with other terminal illnesses. The causes of stroke occurring with AIDS are diverse and include cerebral emboli secondary to cardiac disease, cerebral hemorrhage secondary to thrombocytopenia, and cerebral vasculitis.\r"

Findings indicated that knowledge was reasonably high: 89.7% reported having heard of AIDS. The young and middle-aged groups, the most educated, and the urban men were the most knowledgeable in identifying routes of transmission. However, 22% did not know that there could be asymptomatic carriers of the virus capable of transmitting the virus and infecting others. Furthermore, 38% did not know that all those affected with AIDS eventually die as a result, and only 55% knew that there is no cure for AIDS. Behavioral change in order to avoid contracting AIDS seems relatively low given this sample's history of sexually transmitted diseases and extramarital sexual relations during the year prior to the survey. Although condom use was the lowest percentage of the behavioral change categories, a high percentage reported ever using a condom.\r"

We studied 171 sequential sera from 55 HIV-1-infected people in various clinical stages of disease. There was no significant association between antibodies to pHIVIS and clinical status in this study. Although pHIVIS has sequence similarity to the putative immunosuppressive region of the C-type oncornaviruses (p15E), antibodies to this peptide do not appear to be associated with protection from immunosuppression in natural HIV infection.\r"

Stimulation of normal human monocytes with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) results in the transcription of interleukin-1 (IL-1) genes, the intracellular accumulation of IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta precursors, and the subsequent extracellular release of functional IL-1 beta. The present study demonstrates that zidovudine inhibits the extracellular release of IL-1 activity without affecting the generation of intracellular IL-1 or the amount of released IL-1 beta protein. Similar results were observed with monocytes from normal individuals and monocytes from patients with AIDS. Since IL-1 may upregulate the expression of HIV genes in infected cells, the inhibitory effect of zidovudine on the release of functional IL-1 may be relevant for the beneficial effect of the drug in HIV infection.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the efficacy of enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) for antibodies against HIV-1 in detecting HIV-2-infected blood, we tested 55 HIV-2-positive sera with seven Food and Drug Administration-licensed EIA kits. The percentage detection of HIV-2 sera giving positive reactions with these kits varied between the various manufacturers from 60 to 91%. Observations based on a small number of sera (n = 13), suggest that HIV-2-positive blood collected from apparently healthy people (blood donors, prenatal clinics) are detected with a greater frequency (means = 89%) than blood from AIDS patients or patients (n = 32) hospitalized with other infectious diseases (means = 72%). Based on these results and the low incidence of HIV-2 infection observed in the USA, it was concluded that screening with HIV-2-specific tests would not significantly increase the number of HIV-2-positive people detected by current screening programs. However, due to the poor sensitivity of certain HIV-1 assays for HIV-2 antibodies, HIV-2 sera without cross-reacting antibodies will escape detection. Surveillance for HIV-2 might then be improved by the availability of HIV-1 and HIV-2 combination assays.\r"

The cohort was established by probability sampling in 1984 to study infection with HIV. Smoking showed an association with increased CD4+ cell counts in all men but the effect was attenuated in HIV-seropositive men (85 cells/microliter difference in median counts, non-smokers compared with smokers) compared with HIV-seronegative men (230 cells/microliter difference in median counts). The positive dose response between packs smoked per day and CD4+ counts observed in uninfected men was substantially reduced in infected men (slope 87 versus 27 cells/microliter). Analysis of data from HIV seroconverters suggest that smokers' counts fall faster than non-smokers' following infection, and that response to smoking becomes less pronounced soon after infection. This report demonstrates that those who monitor CD4+ cell counts in HIV-infected individuals for clinical and/or research purposes should also consider smoking status.\r"

Of the 3167 patients diagnosed and reported during the study period, 584 (18%) met the revised case definition only, increasing AIDS case reporting in San Francisco by 23%. One hundred and thirty-four of these 584 patients (23%) subsequently developed diagnoses meeting the old definition. After adjusting for this proportion, the revised case definition increased reporting by 17%. The mean time between initial diagnosis with a disease meeting the revised definition and subsequent development of a disease meeting the old definition was 18.5 months. Patients who met the revised case definition only were slightly older and more likely to be Black, female, and intravenous drug users (IVDUs) than those meeting the old case definition. The majority of patients who met the revised case definition only had initial diagnoses of HIV wasting syndrome (26%), HIV encephalopathy (21%), and presumptive Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (19%). The revised AIDS case definition has significantly increased the reporting of severe morbidity associated with HIV infection, particularly among IVDUs.\r"

To investigate seasonality and update annual trends, excess sera were obtained from incoming male inmates between August 1987 and August 1988. Correctional personnel also provided demographic variables of age, race, offense, category, and jurisdiction. Once rendered anonymous, specimens were assayed for antibody to HIV-1 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. For the 12-month study period, 415 (7.9%) of 5262 consecutive male entrants were seropositive. On univariate and multivariate analyses, no significant change in seroprevalence or risk by subgroup was noted by month or season. For data from April to June 1988, 113 (8.1%) of 1398 consecutive entrants demonstrated anti-HIV-1; seropositivity was associated with age greater than 25 years, Black race, and Baltimore jurisdiction. No significant change was found over time in seroprevalence or risk of HIV-1 infection by subgroup in multivariate analysis combining data for 1985-1988. These data provide additional evidence to suggest stability of HIV-1 seroprevalence in Maryland male prison entrants.\r"

The drug-dependency unit group was significantly more anxious than the students before the campaign (P less than 0.0001). Fear messages significantly increased anxiety in the students (t = 3.8, P less than 0.0001) but had no impact on the drug users. There were no differences between visual and audiovisual material. Thus the campaign did not reach the targeted group but did raise anxiety levels (in the short term) in the students. Perceived personal risk was low and willingness to change sexual behaviour (which was also low) did not differ across groups. Drug-using behaviour was unaltered.\r"
