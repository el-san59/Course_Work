  ".W": "Congenital long-segment intrathoracic tracheal stenosis (CTS) is a rare life-threatening obstruction in infancy and childhood. From July 1983 to March 1988 six infants aged 14 days to 14 months with CTS were identified. Symptoms ranged from recurrent stridor and wheezing to severe respiratory compromise and hypercarbia. Routine chest x-rays were not diagnostic. Definitive diagnosis was made by bronchoscopy, which showed complete tracheal rings in all patients with severely compromised tracheobronchial lumens. In three patients, pericardium was successfully used for anterior tracheoplasty with one early death due to fulminant sepsis in an infant with undiagnosed sickle cell disease. The other two died late, at 3 and 9 months from problems unrelated to the repair. In three patients a rib graft was used for repair; in one, tracheoplasty was required after earlier repair of tetralogy of Fallot. All are late survivors with no postoperative symptoms. After recognition of CTS, prompt surgery is warranted to avoid the late complications of tracheostomy for long-term ventilatory support. Rigid repair with rib cartilage is preferable to use of pericardium. Proper rib harvesting with intact perichondrium, intraoperative bronchoscopy, oxygenation by cardiopulmonary bypass, and meticulous graft alignment are necessary for successful postoperative outcome.\r"

  ".W": "Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) prosthetic vascular graft infections are often difficult to detect. A reliable culture method is needed so that appropriate therapeutic decisions can be initiated in a timely fashion. Sonication of graft material has been proposed as a method of enhancing bacterial recovery. Theoretically, however, this could cause cell lysis and false-negative culture results. Several methods of obtaining bacterial cultures were compared to determine the best method of quantitative bacterial recovery from infected graft material. Polytetrafluoroetehylene (PTFE) and knitted Dacron graft segments (n = 192) were exposed to a slime-producing strain of S. epidermidis or Escherichia coli (E. coli) at four different bacterial concentrations. Recovery of bacteria from the segments was then compared using three different methods to obtain organisms. One-third of the segments were pressed directly onto the agar to transfer bacteria while the other two-thirds were placed in broth and then either sonicated or vortexed prior to plating onto agar. The direct technique was significantly less effective (P less than 0.01) at recovering bacteria than either sonicating or vortexing for both graft materials at bacterial concentrations of 10, 10(2), and 10(4) CFU/ml of S. epidermidis. Sonication was significantly better at recovery from either material at 10(2) and 10(4) CFU/ml of S. epidermidis than vortexing (P less than 0.05). E. coli graft adherence was poor, and significant recovery occurred only at 10(8) CFU/ml. Sonication is necessary to maximally recover S. epidermidis from infected prosthetic grafts.\r"

  ".W": "After early hopeful reports, the ability of desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) to substantially reduce post surgical hemorrhage has been questioned. A total of 74 elective coronary bypass patients (Group A) receiving DDAVP (0.3 micrograms/kg) who, in the opinion of the operating surgeon, did not achieve adequate hemostasis after protamine neutralization of heparin were studied. They were compared with 91 age- and sex-matched controls (Group B). Before surgery there was no difference in hematocrit (40.8% vs. 40.3%); bleeding time (5.3 vs. 4.9 sec); platelet count (267 +/- 8 vs. 309 +/- 13 X 10(3)/mm3); fibrinogen (363 vs. 361 mg/dl); or activated clotting time (ACT) (168 +/- 4 vs. 163 +/- 3 sec). Both groups had the same number of grafts (3.3/pt), use of the mammary artery (72%), and average bypass time (124 min). There were also no differences in postbypass ACT (142 +/- 3 vs. 135 +/- 2 sec); platelet count (97 +/- 10 vs. 120 +/- 24 X 10(3)/mm3); and fibrinogen (157 +/- 35 vs. 207 +/- 40 mg/dl). However, postoperative hemorrhage was strikingly different: 1306 +/- 89 vs. 896 +/- 33 ml (P less than .0001). Fifteen patients in Group A bled more than 1.5 liters compared with 4 in Group B. Red cell transfusion rates were 1.23 +/- 0.26 for Group A and 0.35 +/- 0.8 for Group B (P less than 0.005). Sixteen Group A patients received additional blood products (plasma and platelets). The hemorrhage difference remained significant even when these patients were excluded (1098 +/- 57 vs. 896 +/- 34, P less than 0.003). Three Group A patients were re-explored without a bleeding source located.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There are many factors that make colonoscopy easy or difficult, but the most important one is the endoscopist himself/herself. One must have excellent manual dexterity and technical ability; and, above all, one must perform enough cases to gain the needed experience to understand the procedure and to perform it rapidly, successfully, and safely. There are only so many maneuvers that can be carried out with a colonoscope, such as pushing it in, withdrawing it, turning it to the right, left, up, or down. Therefore, decision making (options), such as changing the position of the patient or applying external pressure points, must be performed rapidly before too many repetitive false moves are made. Options for each anatomical segment of the colon are outlined, based on an experience of ten thousand colonoscopies.\r"

SETTING: Three university-based tertiary care centers. PATIENTS: Patients (697) 21 to 65 years of age with diastolic blood pressure between 90 and 100 mm Hg as well as weight between 110% and 160% of ideal weight. INTERVENTION: Patients were stratified by clinical center and race and were randomly assigned to one of three diets (usual, low-sodium and high-potassium, weight loss) and one of three agents (placebo, chlorthalidone, and atenolol). MEASUREMENTS: Changes in measures of sexual problems, distress, and well-being after 6 months of therapy were analyzed. MAIN RESULTS: Low-dose chlorthalidone and atenolol produced few side effects, except in men. Erection-related problems worsened in 28% (95% CI, 15% to 41%) of men receiving chlorthalidone and usual diet compared with 3% (CI, 0% to 9%) of those receiving placebo and usual diet (P = 0.009) and 11% (CI, 2% to 20%) of those receiving atenolol and usual diet (P greater than 0.05). The weight loss diet ameliorated this effect. The low-sodium diet with placebo was associated with greater fatigue (34%; CI, 23% to 45%) than was either usual diet (18%; CI, 10% to 27%; P = 0.04) or weight reduction (15%; CI, 7% to 23%; P = 0.009). The low-sodium diet with chlorthalidone increased problems with sleep (32%; CI, 22% to 42%) compared with chlorthalidone and usual diet (16%; CI, 8% to 24%; P = 0.04). The weight loss diet benefited quality of life most, reducing total physical complaints (P less than 0.001) and increasing satisfaction with health (P less than 0.001). Total physical complaints decreased in 57% to 76% of patients depending on drug and diet group, and were markedly decreased by weight loss. CONCLUSION: In general, low-dose antihypertensive drug therapy (with chlorthalidone or atenolol) improves rather than impairs the quality of life; however, chlorthalidone with usual diet increases sexual problems in men.\r"

DESIGN: Multicenter randomized clinical trial--International Breast Cancer Study Group (IBCSG: formerly Ludwig Group) Trial V. SETTING: IBCSG participating centers in Sweden, Switzerland, Australia, Yugoslavia, Spain, New Zealand, Italy, Germany, and South Africa. PATIENTS: Data were available for 1229 eligible patients with node-positive breast cancer who were randomized to receive one of three adjuvant treatments after at least a total mastectomy and axillary clearance. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received either a single cycle of perioperative chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil, and leucovorin; or six cycles (6 months) of a conventionally timed chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil, and prednisone for premenopausal women or this combination plus tamoxifen for postmenopausal women; or both perioperative and conventionally timed chemotherapy for a 7-month course of adjuvant therapy. RESULTS: At 5 years of median follow-up, patients who received the longer duration therapies had an improved 5-year disease-free survival percentage (53% compared with 36%; P less than 0.001) and 5-year overall survival percentage (73% compared with 63%; P = 0.001) compared with those who received the single perioperative cycle alone. By 3.5 years, the greater burden of toxic effects associated with the longer duration treatments was balanced by their superior control of disease. Within 5 years of follow-up, even after subtracting time with adjuvant treatment toxicity, patients gained an average of 2.2 months of Q-TWiST if treated with the longer duration therapies compared with the single cycle (P = 0.03). The gain for premenopausal patients was 2.8 months (P = 0.05), whereas the gain for postmenopausal women was 1.5 months (P greater than 0.2). CONCLUSIONS: Six or seven months of adjuvant chemotherapy or chemoendocrine therapy improve both the quantity and quality of life for patients with node-positive breast cancer compared with a single short course of perioperative combination chemotherapy.\r"

SETTING: Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health, a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Sixty-four patients with chronic hepatitis B were treated with alpha-interferon between 1984 and 1986. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients were followed with frequent examinations and determinations of serum liver biochemical tests and hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers including hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), and HBV DNA using blot hybridization and polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Among 64 patients with chronic hepatitis B who were treated with alpha-interferon, 23 (36%) responded to treatment with loss of HBeAg and improvement in serum aminotransferases. All 23 have been followed for 3 to 7 years (mean, 4.3 years). During follow-up, 3 of 23 patients relapsed, with reappearance of HBeAg and abnormal serum aminotransferases, all within 1 year of therapy. The remaining 20 patients continued to have no detectable HBeAg or HBV DNA (using blot hybridization) in serum and to be asymptomatic for liver disease, although 3 had minimal elevations in serum aminotransferases. Thirteen patients (65%) became negative for HBsAg between 0.2 and 6 years (mean, 3 years) after loss of HBeAg. Although no patient had HBV DNA that was detectable by blot hybridization, the 7 patients who remained HBsAg positive all had HBV DNA in serum detected by polymerase chain reaction, but only 2 of 13 HBsAg-negative patients had viral genome using this method. Testing sequential samples indicated that HBV DNA detected by polymerase chain reaction usually disappeared at or around the time that test results for HBsAg became negative. CONCLUSIONS: Remissions in chronic hepatitis B induced by alpha-interferon are of long duration and are followed, in most patients, by the loss of HBsAg and all evidence of residual virus replication.\r"

DESIGN: Investigator-blinded, retrospective incidence cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Patients with left-sided native valve infective endocarditis who had two-dimensional echocardiography within 72 hours of beginning antimicrobial therapy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The crude incidence rate of first embolic events in patients receiving antimicrobial therapy was 6.2 per 1000 patient-days (95% CI, 4.2 to 9.2). The rates in patients with and without vegetations were 7.1 and 4.9 per 1000 patient-days, respectively (incidence rate ratio, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.6 to 3.3). The relation between vegetations and risk for emboli was microorganism-dependent: Stratified incidence rate ratios were 6.9 (95% CI, 1.1 to 42.5; P less than 0.05) and 1.0 (95% CI, 0.2 to 3.9) for viridans streptococcal and Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis, respectively. The rate of first embolic events diminished over time (P less than 0.001), falling from 13 per 1000 patient-days during the first week of therapy to less than 1.2 per 1000 patient-days after completion of the second week of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the presence of vegetations on echocardiography was not associated with a significantly higher risk for embolus in patients with left-sided native valve infective endocarditis. The relative risk for embolic events associated with echocardiographically visualized vegetations may be microorganism-dependent, with a significantly increased risk seen only in patients with viridans streptococcal infection. The rate of embolic events declines with time after initiation of antimicrobial treatment.\r"

PATIENTS: Seven hundred one patients with classic hemophilia (hemophilia A; factor VIII \"deficiency\") were studied for the years from 1900 to 1990; patients were identified in 289 families. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Relative risk for mortality and median life expectancy among hemophiliacs were compared with those among normal U.S. males. Overall, mortality (relative to that of contemporaneous U.S. males) was increased about sixfold among severely affected patients, more than twofold among moderately affected patients, and was equivalent to that of U.S. males among mildly affected patients. Median life expectancy at 1 year of age had reached almost 68 years in the decade 1971 to 1980, but declined to only 49 years in the decade 1981 to 1990. CONCLUSIONS: After improvement in survival from 1971-1980 (corresponding to widespread treatment with lyophilized concentrates of antihemophilic factor [factor VIII]), relative mortality is now increasing, especially among severely affected patients, in large measure because of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\r"

Two hundred patients had no clinical or electrocardiographic evidence of previous myocardial infarction, whereas 216 were survivors of a previous myocardial infarction. INTERVENTIONS: All patients did a standard exercise test and had diagnostic coronary angiography with ventriculography within an average of 32 days (range, 0 to 90 days) of their exercise test. RESULTS: Two hundred patients without a previous myocardial infarction were divided into four groups: the no ischemia group had 80 patients; the angina pectoris only group had 23 patients; the silent ischemia group had 40 patients; and the ST-segment depression and angina pectoris group had 57 patients. In patients without a previous myocardial infarction, exercise-induced ST-segment depression was a better marker than exercise-induced angina for the presence of any coronary artery disease (P less than 0.005). Patients with symptomatic exercise-induced ischemia had a higher prevalence of severe coronary artery disease than did those with only silent ischemia (30% compared with 20%; 95% CI, - 7.3% to 27.0%; P = 0.005). For the 216 survivors of a myocardial infarction, divided into the same four groups, ST-segment depression again was a better marker for the presence of severe coronary artery disease compared with angina alone (P = 0.08). The prevalence rates of severe coronary artery disease in the no ischemia plus myocardial infarction group, the angina pectoris only plus myocardial infarction group, the silent ischemia plus myocardial infarction group, and the ST-segment depression and angina pectoris plus myocardial infarction group were 10%, 9%, 23%, and 32%, respectively (P less than 0.01).

To identify psychological responses and other factors that predict mammography adherence in women with normal or abnormal mammograms. DESIGN: Survey study with prospective analysis of factors associated with mammography adherence. SETTING: Health Maintenance Organization of Pennsylvania and New Jersey (HMO PA/NJ). PATIENTS: Study patients, members of HMO PA/NJ who were 50 years of age or older, and who had had mammography done 3 months earlier, included women with normal mammograms (n = 121), women with low-suspicion mammograms (n = 119), and women with high-suspicion mammograms (n = 68), but not women with breast cancer. MEASUREMENTS: Psychological responses 3 months after mammography and adherence to subsequent annual mammography were assessed. MAIN RESULTS: Women with high-suspicion mammograms had substantial mammography-related anxiety (47%) and worries about breast cancer (41%). Such worries affected the moods (26%) and daily functioning (17%) of these women, despite diagnostic evaluation excluding malignancy. For each variable, a consistent trend (P greater than 0.05) was seen with degree of mammogram abnormality. Sixty-eight percent of women with normal results, 78% of women with low-suspicion results, and 74% of women with high-suspicion results obtained their subsequent annual mammograms (P greater than 0.05). The number of previous mammograms (odds ratio, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.6 to 6.2) and the effect of the previous results on concerns about breast cancer (odds ratio, 0.5; CI, 0.2 to 1.0) were independent predictors of adherence in logistic regression analyses (P less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of women with suspicious mammograms have psychological difficulties, even after learning that they do not have cancer. Such sequelae do not appear to interfere with subsequent adherence.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To review the available information about nitrate tolerance, its potential mechanisms, clinical implications, and strategies for prevention. DATA IDENTIFICATION: A survey of the National Library of Medicine MEDLINE database and bibliographies of the reviewed articles. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Studies were selected from the English language literature with an emphasis on recent studies and, when available, randomized placebo-controlled studies. Old studies were selected on the basis of their historical value and originality. A total of 134 retrieved articles were considered relevant and were reviewed in depth. RESULTS: The available information about the experimental as well as the clinical evidence for tolerance to organic nitrates has been summarized. In addition, information related to potential mechanisms, clinical implications, and possible methods for prevention have been reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence indicates that prolonged in-vitro exposure to organic nitrates, continuous intravenous or topical administration of nitrates, and frequent in-vivo oral dosing result in the rapid development of tolerance to the peripheral as well as to the coronary vasodilatory effects of the drugs. This phenomenon leads to the rapid attenuation of the hemodynamic and anti-ischemic effects of nitrates in patients with ischemic heart disease or congestive heart failure, or both. Tolerance development seems to be dose- and time-dependent, and its main mechanism seems to be a depletion of sulfhydryl groups at the vascular cell. Although the repletion of sulfhydryl groups with the use of sulfhydryl-containing drugs may help to prevent tolerance, the efficacy and safety of this approach requires further evaluation. Intermittent therapy allowing a sufficiently long, daily nitrate-washout interval seems to be the most effective and the most safe strategy currently available for the prevention of nitrate tolerance.\r"

  ".W": "An understanding of the immunopathogenic mechanisms of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is fundamental in developing successful approaches to designing effective therapeutic and vaccine strategies. In this regard, we have investigated the mechanisms by which HIV inserts itself into the human immune system and uses the elaborate cytokine network to its own replicative advantage. We have also shown that the burden of HIV in CD4+ T cells is directly associated with a decline in this cell population in vivo and a progression to disease. Mononuclear phagocytes may play a role in the pathogenesis of HIV infection by serving as reservoirs of the virus. Of note is the fact that monocytes in the peripheral blood of HIV-infected individuals are rarely infected in vivo, whereas infected-tissue macrophages may play a role in organ-specific HIV-related pathogenesis. The role of HIV-specific humoral and cell-mediated immunity in HIV infection is not well understood. However, fine specificity of responses against HIV have been delineated in some in-vitro systems. It is unclear why these responses, particularly HIV-specific cytolytic T-cell responses, diminish over the course of infection and are unable to contain progression of infection.\r"

Only patients initially evaluated within 7 days of visual loss were eligible. Any patient with pre-existing ocular neovascularization or clinical evidence of the ocular ischemic syndrome noted at the initial evaluation was excluded. During the 18-month study, 33 consecutive patients were enrolled. Six patients subsequently developed neovascularization of the iris, an incidence of 18.2%. In these six patients, neovascularization of the iris appeared as early as 12 days to as late as 15 weeks following the artery obstructions. Five of the six patients (15.2% of the total) later developed neovascular glaucoma. Another patient in this series developed neovascularization of the optic disc without neovascularization of the iris, an incidence of 3.0%. Only two of the seven patients with ocular neovascularization had ipsilateral hemodynamically significant carotid artery disease as determined by noninvasive carotid artery testing. This study confirms results of previous retrospective studies that the incidence of ocular neovascularization after central retinal artery obstruction is higher than commonly thought. It also shows that, in the majority of cases, carotid artery disease is not responsible for the neovascularization seen after central retinal artery obstruction.\r"

Three variables correlated well with the reduction in proptosis: the percentage of increase in orbital volume after surgery, the absolute increase in orbital volume, and the degree of orbital \"stiffness\" as measured preoperatively. The first two variables have an inverse correlation with the third. We refer to the loss of resilience of orbital tissues and the increase in adherence between tissue planes, collectively, as orbital \"stiffness.\" While other factors, such as the size of the anterior opening of the orbit, the resistance of the lid diaphragm, and pressure changes within the orbit, may affect the resultant reduction in proptosis, we did not attempt to measure these factors.\r"

Ocular pressures were measured for the next 2 hours at 20-minute intervals. When compared with eyes treated with epinephrine drops alone, eyes pretreated with dexamethasone drops showed a significantly greater decrease in pressure (mean [+/- SD] maximum difference, 3.1 +/- 2.1 mm Hg). Five patients had a difference of 1.0 to 4.0 mm Hg and five patients had a difference of 4.0 to 6.0 mm Hg. Two patients showed no response. Younger age was associated with the greater response. Adrenergic-glucocorticoid synergism resulting in the lowering of ocular pressure may offer a potential for therapeutic use in ocular hypertension and glaucoma.\r"

The relatively low correlation between the surface asymmetry index, a measure of central corneal asymmetry, and best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (rho = 0.62, P less than .005) suggests that corneal symmetry is a lesser but still important determinant of the optical performance of the anterior corneal surface. There was also a high correlation between factors determined from computer-generated orthogonal simulated keratometer values and clinical keratometry values (mean corneal power, total corneal cylinder, and the location of the steepest corneal meridian). The information derived from these algorithms has both clinical and research applications and can be incorporated into computer-assisted topographic analysis systems.\r"

We encountered two white families with lattice corneal dystrophy which closely resembled type III. Four generations of one family and three of another family exhibited lattice corneal dystrophy. Because both families are from Caccamo, Sicily, Italy, we believe it is likely that both are from a single mutation. Thick, ropy lattice lines were seen to traverse the corneas almost from limbus to limbus and were easily detected with direct illumination. Histopathologic examination revealed accumulations of varying sized amyloid deposits in the stroma and ribbons of amyloid between the stroma and Bowman's layer typical of lattice corneal dystrophy type III. We have named the disease in this family lattice corneal dystrophy type IIIA, because of three differences from lattice corneal dystrophy type III: the presence of corneal erosions, the occurrence in whites, and the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.\r"

The incidence of vitreous hemorrhage was also significantly reduced in the treated eyes after controlling for the previously defined risk factors of vitreous hemorrhage and extent of proliferative sickle cell retinopathy at entry into the study. There were no complications associated with argon laser scatter photocoagulation.

We performed HLA-A, -B, and -DR typing on 25 patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome and on 65 healthy control subjects from the Han Chinese population. The results showed that HLA-DR4 and -Dw53 were closely associated with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (P less than .001 [relative risk = 16.0] and P less than .001 [relative risk = 34.2], respectively). This association is similar to that reported in patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome in Japan, suggesting that DR4 and DRw53 may play important roles in the development of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome in Oriental populations.\r"

The discovery of light-fixed pupils in the propositus led to the first antemortem diagnosis by rectal biopsy in two generations of this family.

The most profound change seen at both the light- and electron-microscopic levels was nonselective atrophy of virtually all muscle fibers. Moreover, the botulin-induced blockade of neuromuscular transmission was nonspecific in producing alterations in the three orbicularis fiber types. Muscle structural changes appeared to be reversible, with no apparent long-term consequences. While sprouting of preterminal axons was noted in botulin-treated muscle, formation of collateral sprouts did not appear to be widespread. These changes contrast with the fiber type-specific, long-term alterations induced in extraocular muscle by botulin treatment. However, this differential response may be attributed to the very clear differences in fiber type composition and motor control mechanisms between eyelid and extraocular muscle groups. The efficacy of botulin treatments for strabismus and focal dystonia may then be directly related to both the anatomic fiber type composition and the functional properties of motor control systems of the injected muscle.\r"

We have previously implicated PAFs in ocular inflammation based on the inhibition of several rabbit models of iritis with a specific PAF receptor antagonist. We have tested ocular tissues for the ability to synthesize PAF. Iris, ciliary body, cornea, and/or retina were carefully dissected from New Zealand white rabbits, and tissue from four eyes was pooled. Tissues were stimulated with calcium ionophore (10 mumol/L), and supernatants were extracted with chloroform-methanol. Platelet-aggregating activity was found in the chloroform phase in 2 of 9, 1 of 8, 0 of 9, and 3 of 9 studies involving iris, retina, ciliary body, or cornea, respectively. Twenty-four hours after the intravitreal injection of 125 ng of endotoxin, aggregating activity was consistently detectable from supernatants of stimulated iris and ciliary body, occasionally present from stimulated retina but not detectable from cornea. The shape of the aggregation curve resembled that produced by 0.5 to 2.0 ng of authentic PAF. Moreover, the aggregation could be completely inhibited by a PAF receptor antagonist and the aggregating activity chromatographed identically on high-performance liquid chromatography to a PAF standard. These studies indicate that PAF-like activity could be detected from several ocular tissues subsequent to inflammation. Iris, ciliary body, retina, vascular endothelium, and/or leukocytes could each contribute to the presence of this inflammatory mediator.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effect of topical fibronectin on epithelial wound healing and ulceration in alkali-burned rabbit corneas. After the first 56 hours, fibronectin accelerated complete surface reepithelialization to 4.3 +/- 2.3 days. Control alkali-burned corneas treated with phosphate-buffered saline or albumin did not resurface for 6.7 +/- 3.7 days and 6.2 +/- 2.5 days, respectively. When recurrent epithelial defects occurred, the time required for healing was also significantly accelerated by fibronectin treatment. Corneal ulceration developed in 25 of 28 and 15 of 18 saline and albumin-treated control eyes, respectively; only nine of 18 fibronectin-treated eyes ultimately ulcerated. Immunohistologic studies showed that the initially deposited fibronectin-fibrinogen matrix on the surface of burned corneas had disintegrated by 72 to 96 hours after wounding, corresponding clinically to the time of secondary epithelial breakdown. A prominent fibronectin-fibrinogen matrix remained on the surface of fibronectin-treated corneas, presumably aiding surface reepithelialization and decreasing corneal ulceration.\r"

  ".W": "The ultrastructural nature and distribution of basal laminar deposit, considered to be a precursor of age-related macular degeneration, were studied in 42 human maculae. Basal laminar deposit was found from age 19 years on, not only between the retinal pigment epithelial cells and their basement membrane but also more often on the choriocapillary side of Bruch's membrane. No direct relationship was found with other aging changes, such as calcifications in Bruch's membrane, accumulation of lipofuscin granules, or drusen in the macular area. Material similar to basal laminar deposit can be found in the trabecular system, in the cornea, and also in many other organs and tissues. On a structural and morphometrical basis, we think that basal laminar deposit is similar to fibrous long-spacing collagen and thus does not seem to be a purely ocular abnormality.\r"

In 12 eyelids of six patients, a transconjunctival approach was used to reunite the retractors with the inferior tarsal border. In eight eyelids, a horizontal tightening procedure was also needed. The looping passage of fornix sutures through the full thickness of the eyelid created a vector force that helped rotate the lid margin inward. The subsequent formation of an inflammatory cicatrix induced by the absorbable sutures also contributed to maintain the lid in an upright posture. During follow-up periods ranging from 8 to 36 months, there were no instances of overinversion, recurrent ectropion, or suture abscess.\r"

One hundred seventeen patients were evaluated over a mean of 24.6 months (range 0.5-85 months). Cumulatively, 1.7% had Reiter's syndrome, 1.7% had psoriatic arthritis, and 11.1% had various forms of oligoarticular/monarticular or polyarticular arthritis. The majority of the rheumatic symptoms developed during the longitudinal evaluation and predominantly affected patients with clinically advanced HIV infection. Patients with articular disease tended to have more progressive HIV infection and were more likely to experience disease progression to clinical acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or death. Our data suggest that the occurrence of rheumatic symptoms in the presence of HIV infection is not uncommon and tends to develop over time, in the setting of clinically advanced retroviral infection. Furthermore, the presence of rheumatic symptoms may be a sign of a poor prognosis for patients with HIV infection.\r"

There was poor correlation between Raynaud's syndrome symptoms and an abnormal Nielsen test result. Digital photoplethysmography showed a normal waveform in 2 of 3 patients.

Significant neutrophil migration occurred in patients with RA irrespective of disease duration, and it was reduced by 60% following intraarticular steroid injection. The reduction in neutrophil migration correlated with reduction in pain. Leukocyte migration into osteoarthritic joints was also demonstrated, although it was much less than that seen in rheumatoid joints. No significant leukocyte migration into the joints of patients without arthritis was demonstrated. This technique appears to provide a sensitive method for quantitatively assessing the neutrophil component of inflammation in individual joints of patients with arthritis.\r"

Anti-IL-6 antibodies inhibited immunoglobulin production in cultures of normal and SLE B cells, which suggests that IL-6 is required for B cell differentiation.

Prednisone induced a rapid increase in the level of daily calcium excretion that was not evident with deflazacort. Cortisol secretion was acutely inhibited by prednisone, but not by deflazacort. Neither corticosteroid had a significant effect on glucose metabolism, at the doses studied. Treatment with deflazacort may be an effective alternative to prednisone treatment, with fewer adverse effects on levels of calcium and cortisol, in patients with severe inflammatory conditions warranting the use of glucocorticoids.\r"

Prophylactic treatment with increasing doses of intramuscular GP-C (0.05-0.5 ml/kg) caused a significant reduction in OA lesion area and histologic scores, and the effect on disease activity appeared to be dose related. The DNA and uronic acid contents of OA tissue were unaffected by prophylactic treatment with GP-C. However, levels of hydroxyproline in OA cartilage increased to near control levels with prophylactic treatment. Cartilage levels of active and total metalloproteinases that digest proteoglycans were elevated in rabbits with OA; prophylactic treatment with low-dose GP-C (0.05 ml/kg) produced a significant reduction in active, but not total, enzyme. Cartilage levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases in animals with OA were comparable with control levels, but rose with increasing doses of GP-C. We also investigated GP-C as a therapeutic treatment in animals that had already developed OA lesions. Carbon black retention and histologic score returned to near-normal after therapeutic treatment with GP-C. Uronic acid and hydroxyproline levels were decreased in OA cartilage. Therapeutic treatment with GP-C had no statistically significant effect on uronic acid levels, but was associated with increased hydroxyproline content in the cartilage. The changes in metalloproteinase and metalloproteinase inhibitor were similar to those found in the studies of prophylactic treatment. The findings in this animal model may help explain some of the beneficial effects of GP-C in human OA.\r"

The synergy was time- and dose-dependent, was augmented in serum-free medium, and was blocked by indomethacin or a polyclonal antibody to IL-1 beta. The proteins had opposite effects on cell growth, and IL-1 beta completely blocked the mitogenic effect of bFGF. Pretreatment of cells with IL-1 beta induced a down-regulation in the number of the bFGF high-affinity receptors. Pretreatment of cells with bFGF increased the number of IL-1 receptors, which was dependent on messenger RNA synthesis.\r"

Recently, a protein produced by monocytes and fibroblasts that has chemoattractive/activating properties for neutrophils has been identified and characterized. This protein has been called interleukin-8 (IL-8). In this study, we cocultured neutrophils with 35S-sulfate-labeled cartilage and found that the addition of recombinant human IL-8 (rHuIL-8) caused rapid, neutrophil-mediated cartilage degradation that was the result of induction of neutrophil degranulation by the cytokine. With 10(-7)M rHuIL-8, 23% of the radiolabel was released into the culture medium in 4 hours, compared with a 9% release without the factor. At concentrations of up to 10(-6)M, rHuIL-8 had no direct effect upon cartilage breakdown. These findings indicate that IL-8 may participate in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis through the induction of neutrophil-mediated cartilage damage.\r"

Arthropathy is one of a number of clinical features associated with the disease. Characteristic radiographic features in the wrist and hand have been reported, and an increased incidence of severe hip disease has been observed. In this study, hip radiographs of 112 patients with genetic hemochromatosis and arthritis were reviewed, and histologic examination of 2 femoral heads was performed. Twenty-eight of the 112 patients (25%) had evidence of arthritis of the hip joint. In 23 (82%) of the 28 patients, this feature was thought to be associated with osteoarthritis; 2 of these patients had an atypical arthropathy associated with radiolucency of the femoral head and histologic features of atypical stripping of the cartilage from the subchondral bone. These atypical features were not thought to be due to avascular necrosis, pyrophosphate-associated arthropathy, apatite-associated deposition arthritis, or osteoarthritis, but may be typical of genetic hemochromatosis and possibly the result of increased susceptibility to shearing forces at the bone-cartilage interface. In 5 of the 28 patients (18%), chondrocalcinosis was the sole abnormal finding on radiography. Ten of the 28 patients eventually required hip surgery, which confirms the severity of the hip disease associated with genetic hemochromatosis.\r"

This study investigated the issue of preliminary reporting of echocardiographic data. A questionnaire was sent to 292 physicians; 85 physicians (29%) responded. Seventy-two physicians (87%) thought they had more than a minimal knowledge of echocardiography, 94% wanted a written or verbal preliminary report, and 84% thought that giving a preliminary report should be part of the cardiac sonographer's job. If abnormalities were found, 80% wanted the results before a cardiologist reviewed the study, and 56% would want a diagnostic rather than a descriptive report. Fifty-four physicians (64%) would pressure the cardiac sonographer into giving a preliminary echocardiographic report and would use this information to manage the patient. The majority of the physicians thought that it is legal for the cardiac sonographer to give a preliminary echocardiogram report. Eighty percent said that the cardiac sonographer would not be \"practicing medicine without a license,\" and 82% that the sonographer would not be \"aiding and abetting the unauthorized practice of medicine.\" This data would indicate that physicians at Oregon Health Sciences University want the cardiac sonographer to give preliminary echocardiographic results, even though the sonographer may be breaking state statutes.\r"

Our purpose was to study the acoustic properties of recent myocardial infarction when the predominating pathologic finding was myocardial edema and leukocytic infiltration. We used a new quantitative backscatter imaging system to study 18 patients 9 +/- 5 days after myocardial infarction (eight patients with anteroseptal myocardial infarction and 10 with inferior myocardial infarction) and 20 normal subjects. The cyclic variation of relative integrated backscatter (end-diastolic minus end-systolic) was calculated from on-line measurements. Standard parasternal long- and short-axis and apical four- and two-chamber views were obtained. In the anteroseptal myocardial infarction group, the cyclic variation of relative integrated backscatter was lower in the septum (1.5 +/- 1.6 dB) than in the posteroinferior wall (3.2 +/- 1.2 dB); however, the sample size of only three patients (of eight patients imaged) in the latter group prevented statistical comparison. The cyclic variation of relative integrated backscatter in the infarcted septum was less than the measurement obtained in the septum of the control group (4.3 +/- 2.4 dB, p less than 0.05). In the inferior infarction group, the cyclic variation of integrated backscatter in the posteroinferior wall (1.8 +/- 1.7 dB) was not significantly different from the measurement obtained in the septum (3.7 +/- 3.6 dB); however, the cyclic variation in the posteroinferior wall was significantly less than that obtained in the control group posteroinferior wall (5.7 +/- 1.7 dB, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We prospectively evaluated the descending thoracic aorta of 147 patients (35 women and 112 men; age, 61 +/- 14 years) who underwent clinically indicated transesophageal echocardiography. Patients with suspected disease of the aorta were excluded. Thirty-eight patients (26%) had protruding plaques (men, 25%; women, 29%). Six patients had mobile intimal densities with the mobile area ranging up to 1 cm2. As expected, aortic lumen area was decreased (plaque-free, 3.53 cm2; plaque, 3.19 cm2; p less than 0.05) and wall area was increased (plaque-free, 1.51 cm2; plaque, 1.92 cm2; p less than 0.05) in the regions of the plaque. However, total arterial area was not increased (plaque-free, 5.04 cm2; plaque, 5.09 cm2; difference not significant) in a compensatory manner as observed in other arterial beds. Plaque gray scale was less than the gray scale of plaque-free wall (plaque-free, 141.2; plaque, 122.7; p less than 0.05) when compared at the same level of the descending thoracic aorta or with a second aortic plaque-free level (plaque-free, 150.4; plaque, 122.7; p less than 0.05). Standard deviation of gray scale level was similar between plaque and normal regions. Unsuspected protruding plaques in the descending thoracic aorta occurred in one quarter of the patients referred for routine transesophageal examination. Plaques tended to have lower echogenicity and were differentiated from plaque-free walls within patients. Plaque formation did not result in increased total arterial area. These data suggest that the degree or character of compensatory atherosclerotic remodeling in the highly elastic descending thoracic aorta may differ from other arterial beds.\r"

Left ventricular peak early filling velocities before and after pericardiectomy were measured at different levels of left atrial pressure with right atrial and left ventricular pressures. Peak early filling velocity correlated with mean left atrial pressure before and after pericardiectomy. Before pericardiectomy, when mean right atrial pressure exceeded 12 mm Hg, further increase of the velocity was not observed in spite of volume loading. After pericardiectomy, peak early filling velocity became higher and the slope of the relation line between mean left atrial pressure and the velocity became steeper than before pericardiectomy. When the filling pressure was denoted by the transmural mean left atrial pressure, the points on the relation line before pericardiectomy fell along the relation line after pericardiectomy. We conclude the pericardium exerts an external constraint on left ventricular early filling. Therefore we should not consider the absolute but the transmural filling pressure when estimating left ventricular early diastolic function with use of Doppler-derived left ventricular early filling velocity.\r"

In this study, continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography was used to assess changes in pulmonary regurgitant flow velocities associated with administration of vasodilators in 10 patients with congestive heart failure. M-Mode echocardiographic parameters such as left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic dimension and fractional shortening did not change with administration of vasodilators. Pulmonary regurgitant flow velocity at end diastole decreased from 1.9 +/- 0.6 to 1.3 +/- 0.3 m/sec (p less than 0.01), and Doppler-estimated transpulmonic pressure gradient at end diastole decreased from 16 +/- 11 to 8 +/- 4 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). Doppler-estimated transpulmonic pressure gradient at end diastole was compared with catheterization-determined pulmonary arterial end-diastolic pressure before and after administration of vasodilators in three patients, and there was a good agreement between these measurements. Thus noninvasive and sensitive assessment of the effect of vasodilators on pulmonary arterial end-diastolic pressure in patients with congestive heart failure is possible with continuous-wave Doppler echocardiographic measurement of pulmonary regurgitant flow velocities.\r"

Six different commercially available transducers were used with diameters ranging from 7 to 15 mm. Age ranged from 1 day to 16 years, and body weight ranged from 3.7 to 65 kg. Objectives of the study were to determine (1) minimum body weight in which transesophageal echocardiography with various probes is possible, (2) additional diagnostic value, and (3) potential applications. In three cases (one surgical and two nonsurgical) the probe could not be inserted. Minimum body weight was 17 to 20 kg for probes with a diameter of greater than or equal to 13 mm and approximately 12 kg for the 11 mm probes. A 7 mm probe, on the other hand, could be inserted easily in all patients (including a neonate) in whom transesophageal echocardiography was attempted. In 11 of 56 patients, additional diagnostic information was obtained. Thus, transesophageal echocardiography is feasible in the pediatric age group provided that special probes are used in small children. Additional diagnostic information can be obtained, and the technique is of value during cardiac surgery or balloon interventions for evaluation of the efficacy of the procedure and for monitoring ventricular function.\r"

However, diagnostic catheterization remains necessary in other instances. The aims of this study were to determine whether echocardiography alone was sufficient to delineate the anatomic and flow abnormalities in patients subsequently selected to undergo catheterization and, if not, under what circumstances was echocardiography unable to establish the definitive diagnosis. Echocardiograms of 252 infants and children who underwent catheterization during a 14-month interval were analyzed retrospectively to determine whether the echographic assessment was nondiscrepant (group 1) or discrepant (group 2) with the catheterization assessment. Any deviation in the complete accurate assessment constituted a discrepancy; identification of more than one discrepancy in a single patient was possible. Independent variables included patient's age, weight, operative status, use of color flow mapping, echocardiograph operator, and interval between echocardiogram and catheterization. To determine whether the discrepancies were clinically significant, data from patients in group 2 were reviewed independently by three cardiologists to determine whether patient management would have changed given the added data provided by catheterization. Echocardiographic evaluations were discrepant in 155 instances. In 54 of 155 instances (35%), discrepancies were judged to be clinically significant (group 3). Twenty-three of 54 cases (43%) involved extracardiac lesions (i.e., aortic arch, pulmonary arterial, bronchial collateral, and pulmonary venous anomalies), 20 of 54 (37%) involved pressure gradients, 7 of 54 (13%) involved intracardiac lesions, and 4 of 54 (7%) involved coronary arterial lesions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate usefulness and limitations of proximal jet dimensions for the quantitation of valvular regurgitation, fluid jets were created in a pulsatile flow model, and proximal jet width and cross-sectional area were measured by means of color Doppler flow imaging. When circular orifices with diameters from 1 to 6 mm were studied, jet width and cross-sectional jet area measured as close as possible to the orifice were directly related to the orifice diameter (r = 0.97; standard error of the estimate, 0.4 mm; y = 0.5 + 0.97x) and the orifice area (r = 0.97; standard error of the estimate, 5.7 mm2; y = 0.22 + 2.47x), respectively. No significant dependence on flow rate or pressure gradient was found for these measurements. Jet width was measured with color M-mode Doppler by use of the smallest sample volume size (1 mm) and was slightly greater than the orifice diameter (4.2 +/- 1.7 mm versus 3.8 +/- 1.7 mm). However, cross-sectional areas were approximately fourfold the orifice areas, on average (52.5 +/- 24.6 mm2 versus 12.3 +/- 9.7 mm2), with a range of twelvefold (smallest orifice) to threefold (largest orifice). When the sample volume size was reduced from 2.4 to 1.0 mm, color areas decreased by 25.6 +/- 6.0%. Slit-shaped orifices were studied with two different orientations of the slit-parallel and perpendicular to the ultrasound beam: Color M-mode measurements were again slightly greater than length and width of the slit, but cross-sectional areas were substantially larger than the orifice areas and increased between 44% and 115% when changing the orientation of the slit from perpendicular to parallel. This, again, reflected problems with lateral resolution. When cross-sectional areas were measured at increasing distances from the orifice, the cross-sectional jet area increased significantly within a few millimeters. This increase was greater with higher gradients and smaller orifice sizes. In case of a small orifice (2 mm) and a high gradient (130 to 160 mm Hg), increase in area was as great as 122% within a distance of only 5 mm. Thus, proximal jet width and cross-sectional area were directly related to the orifice size, which could be a valuable parameter for the evaluation of valvular regurgitation. Measurements of jet width by color M-mode seemed to be most accurate but are limited by the fact that in vivo valvular defects may be irregular rather than of circular shape.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Such preliminary reporting is illegal in most states because it constitutes the unauthorized practice of medicine. In most states it is also illegal for physicians to authorize sonographers to do such preliminary reporting because it aids and abets the unauthorized practice of medicine. Such practices also likely violate federal Medicare statutes. Lastly, the practice is simply not fair to patients who are deserving of final diagnostic information. Now that we know the practice is widespread among physicians in training, we can conjecture that the demand for improper reporting of diagnostic data by sonographers is likely widespread among physicians in practice also. Now is the time to check your local statutes, change the way your practice works, and adopt a clear policy for reporting of diagnostic echocardiographic and Doppler data.\r"

  ".W": "Endothelial leucocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1) is a recently described endothelial surface glycoprotein which is inducible by interleukin 1 (IL-1), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Using an immunohistochemical technique and a monoclonal antibody (1.2B6) specific for ELAM-1 we have found marked vascular endothelial expression of ELAM-1 in many cutaneous inflammatory disorders, including allergic contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis, and in dermal infiltrates associated with benign, premalignant and malignant keratinocyte proliferation. In normal skin, minimal levels of ELAM-1 expression were detected. In psoriasis, double-immunoenzyme staining studies revealed a close spatial relationship between ELAM-1 expression and neutrophil margination, suggesting a functional link. Recombinant human interferon-gamma (30 micrograms) injected intradermally in normal adult human volunteers did not substantially upregulate ELAM-1 in contrast to its marked effect on intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression, indicating that this cytokine is probably not involved in ELAM-1 induction in vivo. These results indicate that ELAM-1 is widely induced in cutaneous inflammation with a time course of expression that is longer than that observed in vitro. As ELAM-1 acts as an adhesion ligand for neutrophils, and perhaps monocytes, the expression of this molecule in cutaneous lesions is likely to be an indication of the ability of vascular endothelium to recruit these cells from the circulation. Furthermore, the cytokine inducibility of ELAM-1 is indirect evidence for functional interactions between perivascular mononuclear cells, other resident cells and the blood vessel wall.\r"

  ".W": "Elevated activity of cyclic adenosine monophosphate-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE) has been previously documented in the peripheral blood mononuclear leucocytes (MNLs) of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). Because of the potential interactions of the cyclic nucleotide and inositol secondary messenger systems we sought to determine whether differences exist in the inositol uptake and metabolism between atopic and normal MNLs. We found no difference in the uptake of tritiated inositol by MNL between 19 atopic patients and 16 non-atopic control subjects. However, after stimulation of MNLs by concanavalin A, there was a significantly greater metabolism of inositol to inositol-1-phosphate (IP1) in the controls compared to the atopic MNLs; the mean percentage rise in the IP1 fraction over baseline level was 40% in the atopics, but almost 200% in controls after 2 h. Diminished inositol metabolism in atopic MNLs may explain the reduced cell-mediated immunity that characterizes the atopic state.\r"

The difference in melanocyte counts and in the presence of atypia between sun-exposed and covered skin was statistically highly significant. The only other difference was between melanocyte counts in covered skin from those with multiple atypical naevi and all other groups; the counts in the former were greater than those in the latter. No further difference was attributable to sun exposure, skin type or diagnostic group. Some degree of melanocyte atypia was seen in approximately half of the biopsies of sun-exposed skin, but atypia was seen in only six of 84 biopsies of covered skin. In each case atypia was present in the corresponding forearm biopsy and all six subjects had pigmented lesions (four with melanoma and two with multiple atypical naevi). It seems possible that while increased melanocyte counts in covered skin could correlate with the presence of atypical naevi, atypia of covered epidermal melanocytes could possibly relate to melanoma risk.\r"

  ".W": "The very late antigens, or VLA proteins, are a family of cell surface heterodimers (alpha 1-b beta 1) that mediate cell adhesion to specific components of the extracellular matrix (collagens, fibronectin, laminin). In normal human epidermis, the common VLA beta 1 subunit is expressed on basal keratinocytes (BK). Langerhans cells (LC) and melanocytes. By means of light and electron microscopic immunostaining procedures, we have investigated the distribution of VLA alpha 1,2,3,4,6 subunits on normal human adult and foetal epidermal cells. alpha 1 antigen expression was not observed on any epidermal cell type. Both during foetal development and in adult epidermis, alpha 2 and alpha 3 were strongly expressed on the cell membrane BK, while alpha 6 was mainly expressed at their dermal pole. These different patterns of distribution suggest that the alpha 6 subunit may mediate BK anchorage to the basement membrane zone, while the alpha 2 and alpha 3 subunits may also be involved in intracellular adhesion. Moreover, with immunoelectron microscopy, LC were seen to be weakly alpha 5 and alpha 6 positive and melanocytes were alpha 3 and alpha 6 positive. Thus, VLA proteins are expressed by epidermal cells in a cell-type-specific pattern that could be related to particular functional roles of these proteins.\r"

The number of shed hairs reached a peak around August/September, when least follicles were in anagen. At this time the average loss of hairs was about 60 per day, more than double that during the preceding winter. The rate of growth of the beard was lowest in January and February and increased steadily from March to July to reach a peak about 60% above the winter level. The rate of growth of thigh hair showed a similar pattern though with less pronounced differences. No seasonal fluctuations in finger- or toenail growth were detected.\r"

The autoimmune bullous diseases characterized by IgA autoantibodies to the basement membrane zone (BMZ), i.e. linear IgA disease of adults (LAD) and chronic bullous disease of childhood (CBDC) may have circulating antibodies. Previous studies of tissue distribution and ultrastructural binding have suggested that the LAD and CBDC antigens are similar, if not identical, and differ from the target antigens of the other bullous diseases. We present the molecular characterization of the LAD/CBDC antigens by Western blotting of a large series of antisera. Seven of 33 sera (21%) were positive on immunoblotting and bound to the same antigen which has a molecular weight (MW) of 285 kDa. Using both defined polyclonal antisera to BP and LH 7.2 monoclonal antibody to type VII collagen (carboxy terminal) we have shown that the LAD and CBDC antisera both bind to an identical molecular weight protein which clearly differs from both the BP and EBA (type VII collagen) antigens. Although detectable in dermal tissue extracts like EBA, the MW of 285 kDa is heavier than type VII collagen (250 kDa, in our system, using non-collagenous standards). This study confirms the identity of LAD and CBDC antigens to be the same and to differ from previously described basement membrane proteins.\r"

The growth stimulatory effect of the sera on normal dermal fibroblasts in cell culture was assessed by measuring [3H]-thymidine uptake. Each serum was assessed at four concentrations (2,5, 10,20%). The psoriatic sera were more growth stimulatory than normal sera, but this difference was statistically significant (P less than 0.02) only at 20% serum concentration. Eleven of the 22 psoriatic serum samples had a mitogenic effect greater than the mean +/- SEM of all the normal sera; these sera were then from patients with PASI scores of 4.5-51.0. Six of these psoriatic subjects were recalled after 5 months; their PASI scores were reassessed, and the mitogenic effect of new serum samples was compared with that of the initial samples. All of these patients displayed a change in serum mitogenic effect, but this was not consistent with the change in severity of skin disease over the corresponding time period. In one subject, the severity of the psoriasis had increased marginally over the 5 months, while the mitogenic effect of her serum decreased significantly (mean counts of 43808 vs. 32660; P = 0.0029).\r"

A significant difference between the mean thickness of young versus aged epidermis was noted before transplantation (P less than 0.001). The epidermis of aged and young skin showed an increase in thickness following engraftment with a mean increase in epidermal thickness of 18.8% in the young (P less than 0.01) and 142.5% in aged skin (P less than 0.001). The number of blood vessels in the aged skin was significantly lower than in the young skin, but a remarkable increase was found post-transplantation.

Only those patients with ulcers and a systolic blood pressure at the toe of greater than or equal to 60 mm were investigated. In the controls the relative blood flow during sitting was 0.61 (range 0.35-0.80). In the patients it was 0.46 (range 0.22-0.87). This difference was not significant. During walking the blood flow increased in controls as well as in the patients compared to the value determined in the sitting position (P = 0.0078 and P = 0.0028, respectively, Wilcoxon matched-pairs test). The relative blood-flow rate during walking was 0.96 (range 0.60-1.58) in the controls, and 1.04 (range 0.49-1.46) in the patients. The difference between the normal subjects and the patients was not significant (P = 0.79).

Local heating of port wine stains in 12 patients showed no measurable darkening in the colour of the lesions, whereas the normal contralateral skin reacted with marked reddening. Determination of changes in lightness by photoelectric colorimetry provides an objective, quantitative means to evaluate the effects of laser treatment of port wine stains.\r"

A survey of clinical schools in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland shows that an average of 11 weeks is available for undergraduate learning in the discipline. Nearly all schools provide written aims and objectives for clinical students. Pelvic examination is taught in what is concluded to be a sensible and responsible manner; students are expected to conduct an average minimum of eight deliveries. Family planning instruction is seen as generally inadequate. Comparison of clinical courses with those in Australia and New Zealand shows striking similarities. Undergraduate courses need to be under constant review and revision so that the best students are encouraged to see obstetrics and gynaecology as a desirable career path.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective serological and demographic study of pregnant women and virological study of their newborn infants. SETTING--Teaching hospital in London. SUBJECTS--3315 pregnant women and 2737 of their babies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Quantitative detection of CMV IgG antibodies; qualitative detection of CMV IgM antibodies; demographic characteristics of mothers; qualitative and quantitative titration of CMV viruria in newborn. RESULTS--Congenital CMV infection was found in nine newborn babies (0.33%) two of whom had symptoms. Serological testing of the nine mothers showed four primary and five recurrent infections; both of the symptomatic children were born in the latter group. Testing for CMV specific IgM antibodies or quantitation of IgG antibodies in early pregnancy sera could not differentiate those women at risk of giving birth to babies infected or damaged by CMV from the rest of the population. Quantitation of viruria confirmed that those babies most at risk of CMV disease have the highest titres of CMV. CONCLUSIONS--(i) Since laboratory tests in pregnant women cannot reliably identify fetuses at risk of disease, screening for asymptomatic maternal infection coupled with termination of pregnancy cannot be recommended. (ii) Since 'immune' women can still give birth to babies affected by CMV, we propose that future CMV vaccines should be used to immunize children with the aim of eradicating CMV infection in preference to selective immunization of sero-susceptible females.\r"

  ".W": "The main objective of this cohort study was to analyse the early postoperative mortality after 'simple' hysterectomy for benign indications and to compare it with that of a randomly selected reference group of women matched for age. Registry data covering the entire Danish female population were used. Included in the study were all patients operated in the period 1977-1981. Patients were only included if no cancer was diagnosed and if no major co-surgery was performed (29,192 patients). Cancer patients were also excluded in the reference group (16,182 women). Mortality was studied according to characteristics of patients, their residential area, the surgical approach and operating hospital. Overall 47 patients died within 30 days of admission for hysterectomy (overall mortality 16.1 per 10,000). Only seven deaths were expected on the basis of the population sample, and adjusted for age, the relative risk (RR) for hysterectomy patients was 6.38 (95% CI 4.33-9.39). Early postoperative mortality increased with age, and the risk was elevated among emergency patients (RR = 3.22; 1.72-6.04). Patients with more than one diagnosis at discharge (RR = 4.53; 2.12-9.70) were at high risk, but early postoperative mortality was independent of surgical approach. Causes of death are discussed. Compared to the general population, patients who undergo 'simple' hysterectomy are faced with a sixfold risk of dying within 30 days, but a complete assessment of the risks and benefits of hysterectomy requires prospective studies of survival and morbidity, including quality of life for longer periods of time following operations.\r"

Angiotensin II concentrations in women with pregnancy-induced hypertension [mean (SD): 31.7 (16.2) pg/ml] were, on average, 25% lower than in normal pregnancy (P less than 0.003) and resembled those obtained in non-pregnant women. The lowest angiotensin II levels were found in women with more severe forms of pregnancy-induced hypertension, such as proteinuric or superimposed pregnancy-induced hypertension. Review of the published studies on angiotensin II and our data suggest that the conflict among studies on angiotensin II levels in pregnancy-induced hypertension is largely due to the heterogeneity of the study populations in the various reports.\r"

Sixteen affected babies were born. None was hydropic, three had very severe disease but all survived. There were also three stillbirths, none of which had post-mortem appearances of HDN. The highest recorded anti-Kell titres in individual patients ranged from 1/1 to 1/2048 and bore no relation to the severity of the disease. Of the eight pregnancies in which amniotic fluid examination predicted a high risk of stillbirth, half resulted in unaffected babies. We suggest that haemolytic disease caused by anti-Kell is less severe than suggested by some workers. The use of guidelines developed from the study of Rhesus disease to determine the need for intervention in women with anti-Kell may be inappropriate.\r"

The low-birthweight group was divided into preterm delivery (n = 40), small for gestational age (SGA) (n = 40) and mixed groups. Multivariate analysis was performed using a binomial-logit model to examine whether social factors were independently and significantly associated with low birthweight once the effect of demographic factors, obstetric factors and smoking/drinking were taken into account. Comparison of preterm births with controls indicated that three factors were significantly associated: a previous low-birthweight baby, severe life event/difficulty and bleeding during pregnancy. For SGA babies the factors were: previous low-birthweight baby, low social support and smoking. By using a reliable measure of life events and adequate numbers of low-birthweight babies, this study overcame the potential inaccuracies of previous studies and indicates a more specific relation between social stress and low birthweight.\r"

This goal was achieved with a free flap vaginoplasty using a full thickness skin graft taken from the scapula region. The blood supply of the graft was maintained by microvascular anastomosis of the graft pedicles to vessels in the groin. The operation has been performed in three young women who were born with uterine hypoplasia and vaginal agenesis. We experienced no unexpected complications, the procedure was well tolerated and left our patients with a good length, fully functional vagina. However, the operation is a major undertaking and needs to be performed by those with expertise in plastic surgery as well as in gynaecology.\r"

Multiple regression analysis showed that of the various weight measurements recorded, weekly weight gain and maternal size at booking were the only factors which had a significant association with infant birthweight after taking into account maternal gestation, age, smoking habit and parity. Low maternal booking weight (less than 51 kg) was the most effective maternal weight measurement for antenatal detection of SGA infants (positive predictive value 20.0%). Low average weekly maternal weight gain (less than 0.20 kg) had a positive predictive value of only 12.9% for detecting these pregnancies. Weight loss or failure to gain weight over a 2-week interval occurring in the third trimester was observed in 46% of all women studied. Maternal smoking had a positive predictive value of 16.3% in antenatal detection of SGA infants. Maternal weight need be recorded only at booking, with the exception of patients in whom nutrition is of concern. The subsequent routine weighing of patients may produce unnecessary anxiety and should cease.\r"

The mean maternal weight gain was 10.71 kg (SD 4.3) and the mean weekly weight gain was 0.38 kg (SD 0.16). A wide variation of maternal weight gain was seen in women with a normal outcome. The mean weight gain in heavy (greater than 68 kg) and light (less than 55.4 kg) women was less than that in women whose weight was in the third quartile (60-68 kg, P less than 0.05). The mean maternal weight gain was less in young (less than 20 years) women than in older women (greater than 25 years; P less than 0.05), less in parous than in primigravid women from week 37 onwards (P less than 0.05), less in smokers than in non-smokers from 20 weeks onwards (P less than 0.05), and greater in hypertensive women (BP less than 140/90) than in normotensive women (P less than 0.05) from week 24 onwards. The mean weight gain in women who had small for gestational age (SGA) infants was not significantly different from that in women who had infants that were of appropriate size for gestational age. After taking into account infant and placental weight using multiple regression analysis, the factors that were associated with statistically significant differences in average weekly weight gain were parity, body mass index, smoking habit and raised blood pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A case-control study of the role of induced abortion and other factors on the subsequent occurrence of ectopic pregnancy was undertaken in 1986-1987 in Athens, Greece, where a similar study 20 years ago found a tenfold risk of ectopic pregnancy among women with one or more illegal induced abortions. Seventy women residents of Athens, consecutively admitted to the major state maternity hospital with a diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy, were individually matched with women with a newly diagnosed pregnancy of the same order as the ectopic index pregnancy. Two control women were found for each of 63 cases, but only one control for each of the remaining seven cases. All cases and controls were interviewed by the same qualified obstetrician. Statistical analysis was undertaken with stratification of individual matched triplets and pairs, as well as through conditional multiple regression procedures. The relative risk of recurrence of an ectopic pregnancy was 6.39 with 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.96-21.04. Miscarriages did not increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy. The relative risk for subsequent ectopic pregnancy among women with one or more induced abortion, compared to women without such abortions, was 1.87 (CI 0.84-4.16) controlling only for the matching factors, and 1.71 (CI 0.69-4.27) when marital status (a possible selection factor) was also accounted for in the conditional logistic regression. There was no evidence for increasing risk with increasing number of induced abortions. Past use of an intrauterine device (IUCD) was associated with a relative risk of 3.89 (0.72-21.02); the relative risk increased with the duration of use of the IUCD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

DESIGN--Retrospective study of cytological or histological specimens from women presenting with glomerulonephritis and a group of case and age matched controls. SETTING--University department of pathology, Norway. PATIENTS--81 women presenting with glomerulonephritis from 1981 to 1988, from whom gynaecological cytological or histological specimens were available. A group of 162 case and age matched controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Age when glomerulonephritis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia was diagnosed, type and characteristics of kidney lesion, stage of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and presence of human papillomavirus, use of immunosuppressive treatment. RESULTS--Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia was more common in women with glomerulonephritis than in their controls (16/81 (20%) v 7/162 (4%), p less than 0.001) and was more advanced in those with glomerulonephritis than in the controls (9/81 (11%) of the study group had grade III cervical intraepithelial neoplasia compared with 1/162 (1%) of the controls). The increased occurrence of cervical lesions was independent of the use of immunosuppressive treatment, but the individual lesions tended to be more advanced when it was used (four of the seven cervical lesions in women with glomerulonephritis who had received immunosuppressive treatment were carcinoma in situ). Of the nine cervical lesions tested, seven were virus associated. CONCLUSION--Women with glomerulonephritis should have regular cervical smears, irrespective of their use of immunosuppressive treatment.\r"

DESIGN--Retrospective, descriptive study of a case series of patients with legionnaires' disease ill between 1978 and 1986 and, for comparison, a case series of patients with lung cancer. A prospectively developed register and interview based survey provided data on the location of cooling towers. SETTING--The city of Glasgow. PATIENTS--134 patients aged 14-84 with legionnaires' disease during 1978-86 and 10,159 patients with lung cancer during the same period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--The locations of patients' homes and cooling towers as defined by postcodes, which provided map grid references accurate to 10 m; numbers of expected and observed cases of legionnaires' disease in census enumeration districts; and distance of enumeration districts from the nearest cooling tower as defined by five distance categories. RESULTS--Most cooling towers were in or near the city centre or close to the River Clyde, as were the places of residence of patients with community acquired, non-travel, non-outbreak legionnaires' disease (n = 107). There was an inverse association between the distance of residence from any cooling tower and the risk of infection, the population living within 0.5 km of any tower having a relative risk of infection over three times that of people living more than 1 km away. There was no such association with respect to travel related legionnaires' disease, and for lung cancer the association was weak (relative risk less than or equal to 1.2 in any distance group). CONCLUSION--In Glasgow cooling towers have been a source of infection in two outbreaks of legionnaires' disease and, apparently, a source of non-outbreak infection also. Better maintenance of cooling towers should help prevent non-outbreak cases. This method of inquiry should be applied elsewhere to study the source of this and other environmentally acquired disease.\r"

DESIGN--The original derivation of the score was examined and evidence to support criticisms of the use of underprivileged area scores examined. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Discrepancies between areas classified as deprived according to the index and areas known to require government funding; the extent of the bias towards family practitioner areas in London; and how the results of using the Jarman index compared with those when another deprivation index based on different indicators was used. RESULTS--The use of electroal wards as geographical areas for which deprivation payments are made is unsatisfactory as the wards vary considerably in size. Of the 20 district health authorities with the highest underprivileged area scores in England, 12 were in London, and four of the six family practitioner committee areas with the highest scores were in London. No health authority or family practitioner committee area in the Northern region had one of the top 20 or 10 scores respectively. When an alternative deprivation index was used to determine the allocation of resources to doctors there was considerable variation compared with the Jarman index. CONCLUSION--The Jarman index underprivileged area score is an inappropriate measure to use for health care planning and distribution of resources. There is a need for a revised measure for allocating deprivation payments to general practitioners.\r"

DESIGN--Casualty officer or surgical registrar recorded symptoms and signs on admission on detailed forms. Final diagnosis was noted on discharge from hospital. SETTING--District general hospital. PATIENTS--1204 Consecutive patients admitted to hospital with pain in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen as their major complaint; 1028 had a rectal examination on admission. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Odds ratio for each symptom and sign related to final diagnosis. Results of multiple logistic regression analysis for acute appendicitis. RESULTS--Right sided rectal tenderness, present in 309 of those examined, was more common in patients with acute appendicitis (odds ratio 1.34, p less than 0.05). This odds ratio was considerably less than that for other clinical signs--namely, tenderness in the right lower quadrant (odds ratio 5.09), rebound tenderness (3.34), guarding (3.07), and muscular rigidity in the abdomen (5.03). In the logistic regression analysis of patients with acute appendicitis, when allowance was made for the presence or absence of rebound tenderness, rectal tenderness on the right lost its significance. Six patients had masses palpable rectally, of which three were palpable on abdominal examination; the other three patients had acute appendicitis. No other unexpected diagnoses were established, and no useful additional diagnostic information was obtained by routine rectal examination. CONCLUSION--If patients presenting with pain in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen are tested for rebound tenderness then rectal examination does not give any further diagnostic information.\r"

DESIGN--Analysis of responses to a self administered postal questionnaire. SETTING--Urban conurbation with a population of about 750,000. PARTICIPANTS--386 general practitioners on the general medical list of Leeds Family Practitioner Committee. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Extent of recording of practice activity data and outcome measures and clinical data, use of data, and audit performed; ideas for audit and perceived difficulties. RESULTS--317 doctors responded to the questionnaire (individual response rate 82%) from 121 practices (practice response rate 88%). In all, 206 doctors thought that audit could improve the quality of care; 292 collected practice activity data, though 143 of them did not use it. A total of 111 doctors recorded some outcome measures, though half of them did not use them. Varying proportions of doctors had registers, for various diseases (136 had at least one register), disease management policies (60 doctors), and prescribing policies. In all, 184 doctors met monthly with other members of the primary health care team. CONCLUSIONS--Much poorly focused data collection is taking place. Some doctors have experience in setting up basic information systems and practice policies, and some audit is being performed. The family health services authorities need to take seriously the perceived difficulties of time, organisation, and resources concerned with audit.\r"

The payment formula is based on the Jarman underprivileged area index (UPA(8)) and aims at compensating general practitioners for increases in workload. DESIGN--Evaluation of the deprived area payment against the stated policy objective with a set of criteria for developing resource allocation formulas. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--The degree to which the components of the Jarman index predict the workload of general practitioners; whether construction of the index is sensible and comprehensible; and how the formula incorporates the index and is likely to work in practice. RESULTS--The fact that the index relies on census data and the way the weighting was derived means that the formula will not accurately reflect the workload. The use of statistical transformations obscures the original policy intent. There has been no validation to support the application of the index as part of a national policy. The payments are not linked to the quality of service provided and may have the perverse effect of increasing list size. CONCLUSION--The formula used as the basis of the deprived area payments is poorly suited to the policy objective of compensating general practitioners for increases in workload. More research is urgently needed to enable the effect of the payment to be monitored and a more empirically sound set of incentives to be developed.\r"

SETTING--All 19 universities in the United Kingdom offering clinical courses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Availability of degrees to graduates of other universities. RESULTS--Opportunities for obtaining a degree differed widely among the medical schools, one university (Edinburgh) not admitting graduates of other universities in any circumstance. Of the remaining universities, none would consider a graduate who had not worked in the area where the medical school was located. CONCLUSION--The wide differences in opportunity among the medical schools may put some foreign graduates at a disadvantage compared with other graduates. This problem may become more severe as the number of graduates from the European Community who settle in Britain increases.\r"

  ".U": "91167795\r", 
  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To examine the extent to which changes in diagnostic methods and classification are responsible for the striking increase in incidence of primary liver cancer in Denmark since 1943. DESIGN--Analysis of the time trends in sex specific, age standardised incidence of primary liver cancer and unspecified liver cancer (either secondary without known primary cancer or not specified as primary cancer) in the entire population from 1943 to 1985. By review of the 727 notifications from three periods of 5 years (1948-52, 1963-7, and 1978-82) the changes in histological diagnosis and classification were assessed. SETTING--Denmark. SUBJECTS--Notifications of liver cancer to the Danish cancer registry. RESULTS--Concomitant with the increase in primary liver cancer, the incidence of the unspecified liver cancer declined. The proportion of histologically diagnosed primary liver cancer rose from 85% to 98%, whereas the proportion for unspecified liver cancer rose from 12% to 51%. When the proportion of primary versus unspecified liver cancer obtained by histological diagnosis was extrapolated to all cases, the annual incidence of primary liver cancer was 4.4 rather than 1.6 per 100,000 population in 1948-52 and 6.0 rather than 5.5 per 100,000 in 1978-82. CONCLUSION--The increase in the incidence of primary liver cancer may be much smaller than the numbers of registered cases indicate. This example emphasises the need to consider diagnostic drift in time trend studies of disease incidence.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To investigate the role of community pharmacists in providing advice and treatment for children with diarrhoea; to investigate mothers' responses to diarrhoea in their children. DESIGN--Cross sectional questionnaire study of a random selection of community pharmacists and of mothers attending child health clinics. Pharmacists were interviewed and given a questionnaire and a separate group was visited by a researcher posing as a parent; mothers were interviewed at the clinic. SETTING--Newcastle upon Tyne. SUBJECTS--20 pharmacists were interviewed and visits by a researcher posing as a parent were carried out to 10 different pharmacists; 58 mothers were interviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Advice given by pharmacists was contrasted with standard advice on management of diarrhoea in children. RESULTS--Half of the pharmacists interviewed and 70% of pharmacists visited by a researcher posing as a parent recommended inappropriate treatment of childhood diarrhoea (such as antidiarrhoeal drugs and withholding breast milk), and only 30% at interview stated that they would ask for the age of the child. Mothers' knowledge of home treatment was inadequate. All pharmacists in the posed visits recommended a purchased treatment. CONCLUSION--Pharmacists are widely used by parents for consultation for children's ailments but their advice is not always appropriate; hence they should be given more consistent training in recognising and managing clinical problems. Medical advice on management of diarrhoea is also inconsistent and should be modified to conform to the guidelines of the World Health Organisation.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To ascertain the annual incidence rate of insulin dependent diabetes diagnosed in children under the age of 15 years in the British Isles during 1988, and to compare the results with an earlier study carried out in 1973-4. DESIGN--Active monthly reporting of cases by consultant paediatricians, with additional input from diabetologists and all specialist diabetes nurses and health visitors. SETTING--British Isles (England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland) with a total population at risk of 11,819,000 children. PATIENTS--All children diagnosed under the age of 15 years with primary insulin dependent diabetes from 1 January to 31 December 1988 and resident in the British Isles at diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--National incidence rate of insulin dependent diabetes; differences in incidence rates between regions and between three age groups: 4 and under, 5-9, and 10-14 year olds. RESULTS--1600 children (837 boys and 763 girls) had a confirmed diagnosis of insulin dependent diabetes, giving a national incidence rate of 13.5/100,000/year (95% confidence interval 12.9 to 14.2/100,000/year). This was considerably higher than the incidence rate of 7.7/100,000/year in children under the age of 16 years reported in the British Diabetic Association's study of 1973-4. The age-sex adjusted rates varied between regions, ranging from 6.8/100,000/year (Republic of Ireland) to 19.8/100,000/year (Scotland). There were considerable differences in the numbers of cases diagnosed each month, with the 10-14 year age group showing the most seasonal variation. A quarter of the children (404/1600) were under 5 years old. Case ascertainment was estimated as 90%. CONCLUSIONS--Insulin dependent diabetes in the British Isles does not seem to occur uniformly over time or geographical area. Even allowing for differences in ascertainment between the 1973-4 and 1988 studies, there seems to have been an increase in the incidence rate of insulin dependent diabetes in children under the age of 15 years during the 15 year time period. If diabetes is becoming more common in this age group, possibly by developing earlier in susceptible children, this would be a matter of considerable public health concern.\r"

DESIGN--Retrospective study of data on domiciliary consultations from claim forms for payment submitted to the regional health authority by consultants during 1984-5 and prospective study during 1985-9. Peer review of patterns of practice by consultants. SETTING--15 Of the 16 health districts in the Northern region, comprising a mixed urban and rural population of about 2.8 million. PARTICIPANTS--760 Consultants in 28 specialties and 1666 general practitioners who were eligible to perform or request domiciliary consultations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Numbers of domiciliary consultations, general practitioners' requests for consultations, and consultants performing consultations and expenditure on the service by the region. RESULTS--Use of the domiciliary consultation service in the Northern region declined by 53% between 1984-5 and 1988-9, considerably in excess of the national rate of decline of 27%, and expenditure on the service was reduced, after allowing for inflation, by 604,000 pounds, or 38%, in real terms. Most consultants and general practitioners used the service sparingly whereas a small proportion used it heavily; a few specific consultants and general practitioners were responsible for a relatively high rate of domiciliary consultations. Contrary to the original definition of domiciliary consultation, the general practitioner accompanied the consultant on only one occasion in 17 and, in one specialty examined (paediatrics) patients who received domiciliary consultations seemed to have minor medical problems. CONCLUSIONS--Peer review examination of the pattern of practice in the domiciliary consultation service proved effective in rationalising use of the service, although a substantial minority of consultants and general practitioners continued to use the service heavily. The place of the service in modern clinical practice would benefit from a national review.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVES--To complete a first audit cycle of diabetes care in a general practice and to develop a simple method for continuing the audit cycle. DESIGN--Retrospective examination of the medical records of all diabetic patients in a general practice in 1990. SETTING--A group general practice in a Bristol health centre with roughly 13,200 patients, which since 1983 had had a protocol for care of its diabetic patients. PATIENTS--223 known diabetic patients in the practice. MAIN AUDITED MEASURES--Comparison against previously agreed standards of process and outcome of diabetes care in the practice, including number of patients whose care had been reviewed in accordance with the practice protocol, serum fructosamine and blood glucose concentrations in patients aged under 70, and number of newly diagnosed patients given explicit education and referred for diatetic advice. RESULTS--Defined standards were not met for several criteria--for example, percentages of patients aged below 70 (n = 149) with serum fructosamine concentrations less than 3.5 mmol/l (62% v 90% defined value) and less than 2.8 mmol/l (35% v 70%) and last recorded blood glucose concentrations less than 10 mmol/l in insulin dependent patients (n = 48) (23% v 90%) and less than 8 mmol/l in non-insulin dependent patients (n = 101) (17% v 90%). Of newly identified diabetic patients (n = 32), 59% and 28% respectively were referred to dietitians and given educational material compared with the 100% standard. CONCLUSIONS--The practice has a high prevalence of diabetes (1.7%) but has the resources for their care. The format and implementation of the agreed systematic process of care for diabetic patients needs improvement. IMPLICATIONS--A simple audit suitable for most general practices might record two measures of the process of care--a disease register of all diabetic patients in a practice and an attendance register to determine whether they have regular check ups--and one measure of the outcome of care, such as serum fructosamine concentration (or local equivalent). A practice could establish its own standards for these measures and monitor its performance against them.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To review and evaluate the usefulness of healthy life expectancy as a global indicator of changes in a population's health. DESIGN--Review of all known studies to date from the United States, mainland Europe, Canada, and the United Kingdom that have used Sullivan's method of calculating disability free life expectancy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Life expectancy and disability free life expectancy. RESULTS--Over the past decade the average healthy life expectancy was 60 years for men and 64 for women, with the proportion of years of disability ranging from 11% to 21% in men and from 14% to 24% in women. At the age of 65 men could expect eight years of disability free life and women 10, with the life expectancy being respectively 14 and 19 years. The difference between the wealthiest and poorest income quintiles was 6.3 years in life expectancy and 14.3 in disability free life expectancy for men and 2.8 and 7.6 respectively for women. These results suggest that disparities in health are greater between social groups than between the sexes. Diseases affect mortality and morbidity differently. The order of importance for affecting life expectancy was circulatory disease, cancer, and accidents and for disability free life expectancy, circulatory disease, locomotor disorders, and respiratory disorders. CONCLUSIONS--Healthy life expectancy is a valuable index for the appreciation of changes in both the physical and the mental health states of the general population, for allocating resources, and for measuring the success of political programmes. Future calculations should also take into account the probability of recovery and thus extend the applicability of the indicator to populations in poor health rather than focusing on the well population.\r"

In this small sample of patients, an acute interstitial pattern was seen with pulmonary oedema following bone marrow reinfusion in two cases of the 13 patients showing CXR changes (15%). Otherwise, the CXR changes following ABMT were not specific, although they did alert the clinician to the possibilities of recurrent lymphoma or opportunistic infection, enabling appropriate investigations and treatment to be instituted at an early stage. The complications and CXR changes did not differ greatly from those seen following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "Regression slopes fitted in 238 new cases of primary breast cancer submitted to a variety of managements are analysed. Contrary to the original hypothesis that slopes would primarily reflect the composition of the tumours, the steepness of resorption slopes is found also to be treatment dependent. Investigation of other factors influencing slopes is confined to radiotherapy where the expectation that the prescribed dose will be delivered is high. A large cumulative radiation effect before the start of shrinkage is associated with steeper slopes. A small correlation between slope and both menopausal status and starting diameter has been found, with premenopausal patients and small tumours producing the steepest slopes. The full range of slopes has been seen in postmenopausal patients. The data has been fitted to a linear model to evaluate the relative importance of these associations. Illustrative cases support the hypothesis that resorption slopes are a product of tumour architecture and histology but we conclude that the maximum possible steepness of slope is not always achieved in the clinic, even when radiation is used. A combination of histological and regression data is therefore required to characterize a tumour for predictive purposes.\r"

  ".W": "Intracavitary brachytherapy at low dose rate (LDR), often with the addition of external-beam radiotherapy, has long been considered the treatment of choice for carcinoma of the cervix, maximizing acute damage in the treatment volume, whilst minimizing late effects. In recent years, primarily for reasons of convenience and cost, there has been a move towards treatments involving a few fractions at high dose rate (HDR). Using data from cells of human origin cultured in vitro, we make estimates of the doses that, delivered in 2-12 HDR fractions, produce tumour control and early effects equivalent to intracavitary treatments at LDR. We also show that, for situations where the normal-tissue dose responsible for late effects is significantly smaller than the tumour dose, HDR schemes may be devised which, while yielding early killing comparable with that of LDR, should not result in worse late effects. We suggest that this scenario probably applies to treatment of carcinoma of the cervix.\r"

  ".W": "Although the difference in sensitivity to the changes in dose fraction size between early-responding and late-responding tissues is well established, the underlying mechanisms in terms of target-cell responses are not yet clearly identified for any tissue. The radiosensitivity of mouse kidney cells after in situ single-dose, 2, 8, and 16 fraction X-irradiations was measured in primary culture using a clonogenic assay. The assay was made 12 h after single doses or 12 h after the last dose of the multifraction regimens. When analysed using the linear-quadratic model, as predicted the individual alpha components for all the different fractionation schedules were not significantly different, and the changes in the beta values were consistent with those expected on the basis of the reciprocal fraction numbers. When all four data sets were integrated to derive a common alpha/beta ratio, the result was 4.4 +/- 1.3 (1SE) Gy, or 2.8 +/- 0.9 Gy (a better fit) if the single-dose data set was excluded. These values fall into the range reported for kidney using assays of tissue function at long times after irradiation. Hence, it has been shown for the first time that the fractionation sensitivity of a late-responding organ is mimicked by that of a clonogenic cell population in that organ. The evidence also suggests that the time available prior to fixation of potentially lethal damage does not influence the low alpha/beta ratio observed for the kidney.\r"

Choroid plexus cysts were associated with other fetal abnormalities in three cases, two of which were subsequently found to have a chromosomal abnormality, one Trisomy 18 and one Trisomy 21. A review of the reported cases of choroid plexus cysts reveals an overall incidence of 5.8% for Trisomy 18. We therefore recommend that in patients with choroid plexus cysts a detailed scan should be carried out to look for the ultrasound markers of Trisomy 18. If there is an associated abnormality or cysts are large (13 mm or greater in diameter) and bilateral then a karyotyping should be carried out.\r"

There was a statistically significant relationship between the presence of obstruction on renography and the subsequent requirement for intervention, but not with the degree of obstruction (partial or severe). Stones over 5 mm in size are highly likely to cause obstruction, a drop in relative renal function and require intervention. In all, 14 patients sustained a drop in relative renal function of greater than 7% on renography and 12 of these returned to normal limits when their calculi had been passed or removed. The 2 kidneys whose function remained impaired had fallen below 25% of overall renal function and both patients had received prior treatment for their calculi. No patient who presented de novo suffered any permanent loss of ipsilateral renal function. The results confirm that the criteria for intervention were well founded and emphasise the importance of achieving a stone-free state after primary treatment. Renography is recommended for stones over 5 mm in size, those in the middle and upper ureter and for those patients discharged with a stone in situ.\r"

In 10 patients the indications for kidney-sparing surgery were absolute, while in the remainder the conservative surgical approach was a deliberate choice. The tumours varied in diameter from 1.3 to 12 cm and no metastases were detected on pre-operative screening. One patient died post-operatively from myocardial infarction. In the remaining 30 there were no local recurrences. Two patients died from skeletal metastases (1 with bilateral malignancy) and 2 underwent surgery in the post-operative period for haemorrhagic complications. The efficacy of conservative surgery in the local control of renal cancer is an argument in favour of its wider use.\r"

  ".W": "The measurement of urinary flow rate by uroflowmetry and its relationship to voided volume and age have been extensively studied. It is well recognised that some men void with abdominal straining, but any effect of this on the urinary flow rate is usually not taken into account in urological practice. The aim of this study was to determine whether abdominal straining had any significant influence on the urinary flow rate. Three male volunteers performed multiple voidings either with or without abdominal straining. Statistical transformation of the data and the use of co-variant analysis allowed a comparison between \"normal\" or passive voiding and voiding with abdominal straining. The results showed that abdominal straining caused a significant improvement in both the average and maximum urinary flow rate. If the effect of abdominal straining is not taken into account during the interpretation of uroflowmetry results, incorrect conclusions may be made which could influence subsequent management. It is suggested that the method of voiding should be standardised by instructing patients, if possible, to avoid abdominal straining during uroflowmetry assessment.\r"

In the bladder distension phase there was a reduction in pressure in the bladder base chamber, which implies relaxation of the bladder base. In the expulsion phase the reflex bladder body activity took place with an increase in bladder base pressure, indicating contraction. Relaxation and contraction were blocked by propranolol and phentolamine respectively and both responses were abolished by trimetaphan. It was concluded that the bladder base activity in the micturition cycle is a reflex action mediated via the sympathetic nervous system.\r"

At cystoscopy the bladder mucosa of all patients depicted a highly characteristic, uniformly congested appearance with no demonstrable ulcers; there was no significant reduction in bladder capacity. The histological appearance was essentially non-specific in type with an apparent resemblance to that of interstitial cystitis; mast cells were, however, absent in all specimens. An important feature common to all patients was an associated HIV infection; cytochemistry of the bladder tissue did not reveal an associated cytomegalovirus cystitis. No such case was observed in Zambia prior to the advent of HIV infection and the phenomenon was observed only in seropositive patients. It has been suggested that the virus is likely to be associated with the genesis of the bladder symptoms. The natural history of the disorder, its incidence among the seropositive individuals and its pathogenesis remain unclear.\r"

One has mild stress incontinence. In 1 patient the cuff eroded at 8 months. Two patients had cuffs implanted parastomally to create continent diversion. One is satisfactory on SIC and the other had her AUS explanted because of life-threatening metabolic acidosis. The rectal cuff was explanted because of faecal impaction above the cuff. As an absolute last resort, placing an AUS round a cystoplasty appears little more hazardous than round bladder neck. The use of the AUS for continent diversion has not been pursued because of reliable techniques of non-prosthetic continent diversion. The current model of the AUS is unsuitable for the treatment of faecal incontinence.\r"

Patients were followed up for between 1 and 15 years, the original pathology reviewed and those with carcinoma in situ (CIS) or dysplasia of the background urothelium excluded. Only 5 patients progressed over the whole follow-up period, giving an overall progression rate of 3%. Solitary tumours had an annual initial recurrence risk (AIR) of 0.23 in the first year; after the first year the AIR fell to approximately 0.1 but did not fall significantly in subsequent years up to 8 years. Of the 45 patients with multiple tumours, 32 suffered recurrences within the first year (AIR 0.71). Tumour grade did not influence either recurrence or progression. The results indicate that for solitary pTa tumours, less frequent endoscopic follow-up is justified but some continued surveillance after 5 disease-free years is necessary. The estimated risk of recurrence is a useful factor to consider when planning follow-up.\r"

  ".W": "An immunohistochemical staining method was used to study transferrin receptors (TFR) in bladder tissue from 10 patients with benign conditions and 33 with bladder cancer. All patients with bladder cancer were followed up by cystoscopy at intervals of 3 months (mean follow-up period 11 months). The relationship between TFR activity and recurrence rates was investigated. It was not possible to demonstrate TFR in normal bladder mucosa except for the proliferating cells of the basal layer. TFR activity in malignant tissue correlated well with the histological grade and pathological stage of the tumour. Patients with low grade superficial tumours showing TFR activity had a higher recurrence rate than those with no TFR activity. It was concluded that TFR activity in low grade superficial bladder tumours is a useful marker for predicting the recurrence rate.\r"

The study group included 91 patients who received cisplatin and methotrexate; 36 (40%) had upper tract dilatation, 9 of whom had drainage by stenting or nephrostomy and 55 (60%) had normal upper tracts. The response rate was documented in 65 patients (71%) who had measurable primary or metastatic disease. No significant differences were found between the dilated/drained group, the dilated/undrained group and the normal group in biochemical measurements of renal function during or after the courses of chemotherapy. Serious haematological toxicity occurred in 10% (10/104 cycles) of the dilated/undrained group and in 6% (12/200 cycles) of the normal group. The complete response rate in the dilated group was 15% compared with 41% in the normal group. No increased chemotherapy toxicity was observed in patients with upper tract dilatation and a significant complete response rate was found in patients with upper tract dilatation without renal impairment.\r"

In 42 patients this was performed under cystoscopic guidance and in 12 patients under fluoroscopic control. Three months following dilatation, 13/27 patients (48%) with BOO who returned for review were rendered unobstructed and 19/27 (70%) were symptomatically improved. By 6 months only 3 remained unobstructed but 15 remained symptomatically improved. Nine months after dilatation 14 patients retained symptomatic improvement but only 2 remained unobstructed. Of the 25 patients treated for acute retention only 6 voided spontaneously, 1 of these relapsing into retention at 2 months and another at 4 months. No patient was rendered unobstructed but 2 patients (who declined prostatectomy) noted an improvement in their obstructive symptoms at both 3 and 6 months. No patient developed retrograde ejaculation following dilatation. Balloon dilatation to 35 mm has no role in acute urinary retention but may have a role in younger men with BOO who wish to avoid prostatectomy and the risk of retrograde ejaculation. In these patients careful follow-up is required.\r"

  ".U": "91167945\r", 
  ".W": "Since the early study of Halliday and Wakefield (1963) it has generally been agreed that scalp somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) are normal in patients with dissociated loss of pain and temperature sensation. Up to now a few patients with abnormal spinal N13 and preserved scalp P14 and N20 have been reported in the literature, but there is no firm evidence, based on group data, that this dissociation can be related to any form of dissociated sensory loss. We studied median nerve SEPs in 24 patients with syringomyelia documented by CT scan or MRI. For the recording of the cervical N13 we used a Cv6 anterior cervical montage, which cancels the potentials generated above the foramen magnum and enhances the amplitude of N13. Scalp far-field and early cortical SEPs were recorded using a noncephalic reference electrode. Since N13 pathological changes are mainly changes in amplitude we measured the N13/P9 amplitude ratio in normal subjects and patients and found that it was a reliable index to quantify the amplitude decrease of N13. Absent or reduced N13 was observed in 40 median nerve SEPs (83%) in conjunction with normal P14 and N20 in 30 SEPs. Thus the dissociated loss of the cervical N13 was identified as the most conspicuous SEP feature in syringomyelia. A significant correlation was found between abnormal N13 and loss of pain and temperature sensations, whereas P14 abnormalities correlated well only with loss of joint and touch sensations. In the median nerve territory, sensation was either normal (6 cases) or lost only for pain and temperature (24 cases) when SEPs showed abnormal N13 and normal P14. Although it does not directly reflect the postsynaptic activity of spinal cells receiving their inputs from A delta and C fibres the N13 potential proved to be a reliable index of spinal cord grey matter dysfunction in syringomyelia.\r"

Abnormalities in maps of motor and premovement potentials and in PET scans were consistent with a bilateral representation of hand muscles in the motor cortex, the existence of physiologically active connections capable of conducting fast efferent volleys from the motor cortex to ipsilateral muscles, the presence of mirror EMG activity in either hand with intended voluntary movement of the other hand, the absence of mirrored EMG responses from wrist flexors and extensors to mechanical perturbation of the contralateral wrist, and normal scalp distribution of somatosensory evoked potentials to right and left median nerve stimulation. Our findings are consistent with aberrant organization of motor representation areas and corticospinal pathways with ipsilateral as well as contralateral control of voluntary movement.\r"

A severe visual recognition deficit was accompanied by impairments in discriminating shape, reflectance, and orientation, although visual acuity and colour vision, along with tactile recognition and intelligence, were largely preserved. Neuropsychological and behavioural investigations have indicated that the patient is able to utilize visual pattern information surprisingly well for the control of hand movements during reaching, and can even read many whole words, despite being unable to make simple discriminative judgements of shape or orientation. She seems to have no awareness of shape primitives through Gestalt grouping by similarity, continuity or symmetry. It is proposed that many of these perceptual disorders might be the combined result of (1) a selective loss of the cortical elaboration of the magnocellular visual processing stream, and (2) a selective output disconnection from a central processor of visual boundaries and shape primitives in the occipital cortex.\r"

Clinically, each intravenous transfer of P2-reactive T cells induced a relapse of the disease with weight loss and flaccid paresis of the hindlimbs followed by recovery. After multiple transfers, recovery from disease was incomplete, leading to increasing neurological deficit during the remissions. The pathology of the lesions during exacerbations was characterized by massive inflammation in the peripheral nervous system, associated with extensive endoneurial oedema, nerve fibre destruction and wallerian degeneration. Selective primary demyelination and remyelination was found in the minority of affected nerve fibres. No onion bulbs were present in chronic lesions. In the central nervous system partial degeneration of the posterior columns reflected the extent of wallerian degeneration in the peripheral nerves and spinal roots. In addition, during stages of active disease some T lymphocytes and upregulation of Ia antigen expression were found in the spinal cord.\r"

Long-latency stretch reflex and volitional EMG amplitude modulations were assessed as functions of the tracking phase. Reflex modulation during tracking, both in wrist flexor and extensor muscles, was found to differ significantly between parkinsonian and normal subjects. In the parkinsonian group, the abnormality consisted of an increased reflex activity during tracking phases in which the muscle was lengthening. At these phases the reflex generated torque is opposite in direction to the volitionally generated torque and the tracking movement. No differences in the unperturbed volitional EMG modulation were observed between groups for this error constrained tracking paradigm. Significant correlations were found between ratings of bradykinesia and the amount of abnormal reflex modulation in the wrist flexor. These data suggest that a component of bradykinesia results from a defective coordination of supraspinal reflex and volitional control systems.\r"

The first set of studies was aimed at evaluating the ability of these subjects to detect and localize at various eccentricities three types of targets which differed in their spatiotemporal properties (stationary, flashing and moving). The subjects could detect effectively the presence of any of these stimuli in their blind field and they experienced little difficulty in discerning blank from target trials. When manual pointing was used to measure localization quality, the hemianopes made more errors in their blind field but their accuracy, when detection was correct, was comparable with that observed in their intact visual field and in that of the control subjects. In the second set of experiments, the capacity of 3 of the subjects to detect in their blind field a moving grating, as well as to discriminate between relative grating velocities and directions in their blind field and in both fields simultaneously, was assessed. Two subjects could detect the movement in their blind field, although this was in part affected by stimulus velocity. When discrimination of relative velocities in the blind field and in both fields simultaneously was evaluated, individual differences were observed. However, all subjects showed some capacity to carry out the task. Finally, none of the experimental subjects was able to discriminate the relative directions of the moving gratings. The results are discussed in terms of collicular involvement to account for the residual vision observed in the blind field of hemispherectomized subjects.\r"

Following unilateral striatal dopamine depletion, produced by intracerebral infusion of 6-hydroxydopamine, there was not only a marked spatial response bias towards the side of the dopamine depletion but also an abolition of the delay-dependent speeding of reaction time that reflects motor readiness, on the side contralateral to the lesion. Nevertheless, the rats continued to show a benefit in performance of the simple reaction time condition compared with the choice reaction time condition, indicating that they were able to use advance information to select and prepare responses. The results are discussed in the context of differential deficits shown by patients with Parkinson's disease in simple versus choice reaction time performance, and of the functions of parallel corticostriatal loops subserving the normal control of action.\r"

  ".W": "Anxiety can induce hyperventilation, and the resultant hypocapnia and hypocalcaemia can lead to paraesthesiae and tetany. To define the nature of the disturbance created in peripheral nerve, the excitability of cutaneous and motor axons was monitored in 6 normal subjects requested to hyperventilate until paraesthesiae developed in the hands, face and trunk. This occurred when alveolar PCO2 (PACO2) had declined on average by 20 mmHg. Spontaneous EMG activity developed when PACO2 had declined by a further 4 mmHg. Changes in the excitability of cutaneous and motor axons were measured from changes in the compound action potentials evoked by stimulation of the median nerve at the wrist and recorded over the digital nerves of the index finger and over the thenar muscles, respectively. As PACO2 declined, the size of the compound sensory and muscle potentials evoked by a constant stimulus progressively increased, indicating an increase in axonal excitability. These changes occurred before paraesthesiae or tetany developed. In each subject there was a statistically significant inverse correlation between PACO2 and axonal excitability. Independent of this increase in axonal excitability, there was no significant change in the supernormal phase of the recovery cycle of cutaneous axons. Microneurographic recordings from the median nerve in 2 subjects revealed spontaneous bursting activity of cutaneous axons, perceived as paraesthesiae. It is concluded that the paraesthesiae and tetany induced by hyperventilation result solely from changes in the excitability of cutaneous and motor axons in the peripheral nerve, presumably due to an alteration in the electrical properties of the axonal membrane resulting from a reduced plasma [Ca2+]. The supernormal phase may entrain the ectopic discharge and thereby determine the maximal discharge frequency of impulses in ectopically generated trains, but does not otherwise contribute to the physiological disturbance.\r"

Annular patterns of protein-rich leakage were seen which may help to elucidate the patterns observed using gadolinium-enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. Vessel wall damage was found in all acute plaques examined and this was associated with the intramural deposition of complement on smooth muscle components and with an infiltration of HLA-DR +ve macrophages. In addition, all acute cases examined had small plaques which contained particulate material within macrophages and astrocytes, on which complement and immunoglobulins colocated. Attempts to find similar material in cases of chronic MS, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis and in perivenous encephalomyelitis were unsuccessful. These results suggest that the inflammatory changes in early MS plaques may have some specificity which could be related to the antigens whose presence is inferred by the colocation of complement and immunoglobulin on material within activated macrophages and astrocytes.\r"

All 7 patients had cells secreting anti-MAG IgM antibody in bone marrow (median value 1 per 2000 cells). In contrast, peripheral blood from only 2 of these patients contained low numbers of such cells. One patient with polyneuropathy associated with an IgA M component had cells secreting anti-MAG IgA antibody in CSF, and 1 with an IgG M component had cells secreting anti-MAG IgG antibody in CSF; both patients also had anti-MAG IgM antibodies detectable in CSF only by ELISA. These 2 patients may thus have concurrent intrathecal production of antibodies of 2 different isotypes which are directed against the same or different epitopes of MAG. The production of antibodies directed against a component of myelin occurring in the immediate vicinity of the peripheral nervous system might be involved in the pathogenesis of the polyneuropathy.\r"

(1) The density of unmyelinated axons showed no significant correlation with age, but the densities of (2) Schwann cell subunits with axons, (3) Schwann cell subunits without axons, (4) single protrusions of Schwann cells and (5) collagen pockets, and (6) the mean number of Schwann cell profiles per axon, all showed positive correlations with age. Additionally, (7) the percentage of subunits containing unmyelinated axons and (8) the mean number of axons in single axon-containing Schwann cell subunits demonstrated negative correlations with age. The density of Schwann cell nuclei related to unmyelinated fibres did not show a significant change with age. The age-dependent changes in unmyelinated nerve fibres thus mainly consist of an increased production of processes by Schwann cells in the absence of cell multiplication. A decrease in unmyelinated nerve fibre density or a compensatory increase of small unmyelinated axons did not occur in these normal adults. In terms of relative sensitivity for the detection of the earliest changes in unmyelinated fibres, the indices (6) and (7) are considered to be useful and superior to the conventional assessment of unmyelinated axon density and diameter distribution. These two indices are not influenced by postmortem swelling of the axons and Schwann cells. Measurements of unmyelinated axon density and size distribution will continue to be useful in the assessment of more advanced pathological conditions.\r"

Thirty-six were discharged from hospital on combined treatment with 24 h lisuride infusion (111.3 +/- 29.5 micrograms/h) and oral levodopa plus a decarboxylase inhibitor (729.6 +/- 452 mg/day); all obtained a marked initial improvement in mobility (mean reduction 'off' hours 87.5%); 34 were followed for a mean of 20.85 (range 6-45) months. Most patients continued to show improvement with respect to baseline assessment during chronic treatment but 23 developed dyskinesias, 'off' periods or both, which were difficult to control by changing the levodopa schedule, lisuride dose or both. In only 5 patients was lisuride treatment stopped because of inefficacy. The high incidence of psychiatric side-effects (18/38) was the major limiting factor for continuing lisuride infusion in this population of severe parkinsonian patients. Many complained about the inconvenience of the pump's technical requirements for long-term utilization, but only 4 patients abandoned SLI for this reason. These results indicate that motor function may be substantially improved in severe parkinsonian patients treated with SLI but increased dyskinesia or psychiatric adverse effects limited the long-term usefulness of this approach. It is suggested that continuous dopaminergic stimulation may be a particularly useful therapeutic strategy when applied in earlier stages of the disease.\r"

Electromyographic recordings were made from biceps and deltoid muscles immediately proximal to the stump and the same contralateral muscles. Magnetic stimulation was delivered by a Cadwell MES-10 magnetic stimulator through a 'figure eight' magnetic coil over scalp positions separated by 1-2.5 cm. Maximal M responses were elicited by peripheral nerve stimulation at Erb's point. The amplitude of MEPs was expressed both as absolute values and as a percentage of maximal responses to peripheral nerve stimulation. Threshold for activation of muscles ipsilateral and contralateral to the stump and the region of excitable scalp positions were also determined in 7 patients. Magnetic scalp stimulation induced a sensation of movement in the missing hand or fingers in the patients with acquired amputation, but failed to do so in the patient with congenital absence of a limb. It evoked larger MEPs, recruited a larger percentage of the motoneuron pool, and elicited MEPs at lower intensities of stimulation in muscles ipsilateral to the stump than in contralateral muscles. Muscles ipsilateral to the stump could be activated from a larger area than those contralateral to the stump. These results are compatible with cortical or spinal reorganization in adult human motor pathways targeting muscles proximal to the stump after amputations.\r"

She was severely impaired in verbal and nonverbal tasks requiring her to localize body parts (on her own body, the examiner's body or a doll's body) even though she correctly named the same parts when pointed at by the examiner. Pointing responses were misdirected mainly to parts contiguous with the target area and, to a lesser extent, to functionally equivalent body parts. We also found that the patient was able to define body part names functionally but not spatially. In another series of tasks, and in contrast to the above results, performances were normal when small objects, attached to the patient's body, served as pointing targets. Furthermore, on subsequent testing she pointed correctly at the remembered position of these objects. The fact that the same point in 'body space' is localized correctly when it corresponds to an external object and erroneously when it corresponds to a body part contradicts the idea of the body schema as a unitary function. Learning the position of objects on the body surface requires access to some form of body-reference system on which this information can be mapped. We argue that such a system can be available in autotopagnosia and is independent from the visuospatial representations of the body structure that are postulated to be damaged or inaccessible in this syndrome. An integrated account of the present results and of those reported by other authors suggests that multiple levels of representation (e.g., sensorimotor, visuospatial, semantic) are involved in the organization of body knowledge.\r"

The discharge characteristics of 26 tonically active, low threshold single motor units in the first dorsal interosseous muscle of 13 healthy subjects and of 21 motor units in 9 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) were studied. Up to 500 transcranial magnetic stimuli were delivered at the vertex and were given randomly with respect to, or at a fixed delay after, the previous voluntary discharge. Peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) of motor unit discharges were constructed. In healthy subjects, two periods of increased firing probability were seen at onset latencies of 20-31 ms and 56-90 ms after the stimulus. These periods have been termed the primary peak and the secondary peak. The primary peak had a mean duration of 4.6 ms and was found to be multimodal in 17 motor units. Subpeaks had intermodal intervals of between 0.6 and 2.4 ms. Subpeaks probably result from a sequence of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) induced at the motoneuron by corticospinal impulses. In patients with MS, the primary peak could be absent, delayed in onset, of increased duration without discernible subpeaks, or showing increased intermodal intervals between subpeaks. In 3 motor units from patients with MS, PSTHs with normal features were found. It is postulated from this study of the corticospinal inputs to single motoneurons that motor impairment in MS can be due to a number of mechanisms including slowed conduction in corticospinal fibres, dispersion of arrival times of corticospinal impulses at spinal motoneurons and conduction block in corticospinal fibres, which may be frequency dependent.\r"

  ".W": "In 31 patients with definite or suspected multiple sclerosis (MS) presenting with a cervical cord syndrome, somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were recorded to median and posterior tibial nerve stimulation, using cephalic and noncephalic reference electrodes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and cervical spinal cord was performed, the latter in sagittal and axial views. SEPs were abnormal in 67.7% of patients, whereas MRI showed cervical cord lesions in 74.2% and intracranial lesions possibly involving the somatosensory pathways in 64.5% of cases. A significant correlation was found between abnormalities of cervical (N13) and cortical (N20) potentials following median nerve stimulation with Fz reference and MRI abnormalities involving the ipsilateral or posterior half of the cervical cord, but not the contralateral or anterior half. The N13 potential, recorded from the low cervical region to a supraglottal reference, was most frequently abnormal in patients with MRI lesions at C6 or C7, whereas P14, recorded from the scalp to a clavicle reference, was most often affected by lesions at Cl or the cervicomedullary junction. Abnormalities of the cortical P40 to tibial nerve stimulation were less significantly correlated with cervical MRI lesions. The latency of N20 measured from N9 at the clavicle and the absolute latency of P40 were significantly correlated with the length of MRI abnormalities in the ipsilateral cervical cord. No significant correlation was observed between SEP abnormalities and brain MRI lesions, which it was considered might possibly involve the intracranial somatosensory pathways. It was concluded that (1) the morphological lesions seen in MRI of the cervical cord usually give rise to appropriate electrophysiological deficits, but the occasional finding of a widespread MRI lesion with normal SEP suggests that myelin damage is not the only or the major factor responsible for abnormal MRI signal; and (2) 'clinically silent' lesions apparently involving the radiations and other sensory structures of the brain appear not to give rise to detectable SEP abnormalities, using the methods of the present study.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical data of 54 patients (57% males) with extracranial primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) seen over a 20-year period at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center were reviewed. The age at diagnosis ranged from 1 month to 81 years (median, 17 years). One PNET arose in a previously irradiated site. One patient had an unaffected identical twin. Primary sites were thoracopulmonary (n = 25), pelvis (n = 12), retroperitoneum or abdomen (n = 10), limbs (n = 5), neck (n = 1), and unknown (n = 1). At diagnosis, epidural extension was present in 13 patients with truncal primaries, and 11 patients had distant metastases. All of the latter died with disease. Progression-free survival (PFS) among the 43 patients with localized tumors (all greater than 5 cm) was 25% at 24 months. Two of 13 patients who relapsed after more than 12 months without therapy were long-term survivors. Patients with localized PNET who had resection of all gross disease within 3 months of diagnosis had a significantly longer PFS (P = 0.0003). Radiation therapy caused tumor shrinkage but was not curative of measurable disease. A dose-response effect was evident with the most commonly used drug, cyclophosphamide. Myeloablative regimens using melphalan (n = 8) or thiotepa (n = 1) with autologous bone marrow rescue were not clearly beneficial. The treatment results favor: (1) early surgical removal, (2) dose-intensive use of drugs active against PNET (especially cyclophosphamide), and (3) radiation therapy to ablate residual microscopic disease.\r"

In the early phase of the study, MCNU (300 to 500 mg/m2) was administered with cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) (1.6 to 16 g/m2), etoposide (VP-16) (0.8 to 1.6 g/m2), cyclophosphamide (CY) (100 to 200 mg/kg), or busulfan (16 mg/kg). No acute toxicity was noticed after this high-dose therapy. The dose-limiting factor of the regimens was significant but reversible interstitial pneumonitis (IP). In a subsequent trial with an MCNU/VP-16/Ara-C/CY (MCVAC) regimen in which the dose of MCNU was reduced, the risk of IP diminished. This study is still in progress, but the clinical response has so far been encouraging. Fifteen of 26 children are alive and well in unmaintained complete remission (CR) with a median follow-up period of 11 months (range, 3 to 34 months) after transplantation. This MCNU-based regimen without total body irradiation (TBI) is especially important in children to avoid the serious sequelae of irradiation. Our results justify a broader clinical trial to evaluate the effects of the MCVAC regimen followed by PBSCT.\r"

Among 31 patients with NHDL, there was agreement between MRI and CT findings in 21 patients; MRI findings were positive and CT findings were negative in 8 patients; and MRI findings were negative and CT findings were positive in 2 patients. The false-negative findings of MRI included a laparotomy-proven mesenteric mass and a 6.6-cm lesion in the spleen, both shown by CT. In 13 evaluable patients with HD, there was agreement between MRI and laparotomy findings in 8 patients; MRI findings were positive and laparotomy findings were negative in 4 patients; and MRI findings were negative and laparotomy findings were positive in 1 patient. CT findings agreed with laparotomy findings in nine patients; CT findings were positive and laparotomy findings were negative in one patient: and CT findings were negative and laparotomy findings were positive in three patients. This suggested that MRI, although more sensitive than CT, was less specific with more false-positive findings. The spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) for the spleen was generally higher in patients with HD who had pathologically confirmed splenic involvement, and tended to increase with increasing spleen weight. This study was performed on a prototype 0.15 Tesla (Technicare Inc., Solon, OH) resistive unit at a time when methods and reporting for MRI were still being developed. Although MRI appears to have fewer false-negative findings than CT in evaluating the abdomen of lymphoma patients, the lack of a gastrointestinal contrast agent and specificity of T1 elevations in the spleen would not suggest that MRI could replace CT or laparotomy as a staging technique.\r"

The breast cancer patient populations of two cities, Nijmegen and Eindhoven, The Netherlands, which were subjected to a well-defined follow-up program, were compared. The program consisted of regular physical examination and annual mammography in Nijmegen and physical examination only in Eindhoven. From 1975 until 1987, 24 ACBC patients were detected within a group of 880 breast cancer patients in Nijmegen (3%) and, from 1971 until 1984, 14 ACBC patients within a group of 411 patients in Eindhoven (3%). In Nijmegen, eight of the 23 evaluable patients (35%) had a contralateral tumor with a histologic size smaller than 10 mm or an in situ carcinoma, compared with one of the 14 of the Eindhoven patients (7%), whereas 18 of the 24 (75%) versus eight of the 14 patients (57%) were node-negative. Thus annual mammography is very likely a contribution in the early detection of contralateral breast cancer as compared with follow-up by regular physical examination only.\r"

Malignant tumors had a mean pH of 7.35 +/- 0.13 which was greater than that of muscle tissue with a mean pH of 7.08 +/- 0.07 (P less than 0.001). All tumors had greater relative levels of phosphomonoesters, inorganic phosphate, and phosphodiesters compared with those in muscle tissue but considerable variability among tumors was noted due to tumor size, extent of tumor necrosis, and muscle contamination. Integrated MRI/MRS studies are necessary to provide exact localization of the tumor and a more correct interpretation of the 31P-MRS data.\r"

A Cox multi-variate retrospective analysis was done of the overall survival of node-positive colon cancer patients with the specific objective of determining the most appropriate subcategorization. Data on 306 patients with node-positive colon cancer who underwent potentially curative surgery from 1970 to 1984 were analyzed retrospectively. No patient received adjuvant chemotherapy. Also excluded were patients with synchronous resected metastatic disease or those with rectal primaries. The median follow-up was 6 years, and the median survival for the entire group was 8.6 years. By univariate analysis, the following were significant prognostic features: number of positive nodes (P less than 0.0001), degree of differentiation (P less than 0.0001), colon primary site (P = 0.009), tumor stage (P = 0.001), and tumor size (P less than 0.0001). Lymphatic/blood vessel invasion and a mucinous histology were not significant. By Cox multivariate analysis the number of positive lymph nodes remained the best discriminant of survival (P = 0.0001). The number of positive nodes was related inversely to prognosis with the optimal dichotomization between one to three (66% 5-year survival) and four or greater nodes (37% 5-year survival).\r"

All patients were men and ranged in age from 21 to 45 years. The HIV risk factors included homosexuality (6), intravenous drug abuse (2), and hemophilia A (1). All patients had high pathologically determined stage (one Stage III and seven Stage IV), and bone marrow involvement was observed in five patients with the initial diagnosis of HD based on marrow biopsy in two cases. Four cases were histologically subclassified as mixed cellularity (MC) and three as nodular sclerosis (NS); one patient underwent only bone marrow biopsy and was not subclassified. Histologically all cases were characterized by numerous Reed-Sternberg cells and variants, and with the exception of one case, all had a distinctive decrease in the proportion of reactive background lymphocytes compared with what is usually expected in MC or NS Hodgkin's disease (relative lymphocyte depletion). Flow-cytometric immunophenotypic studies done on cell suspensions from diagnostic lymph node biopsies in four cases showed decreased CD4:CD8 ratios (mean = 1.4) compared with expected values of 4 to 6. The relative lymphocyte depletion observed histologically is probably a reflection of the decreased tissue CD4:CD8 ratios, and this impairment of host immune response may be related to the observed high stage in all eight cases. Patients with high stage HD and the described histologic and immunologic features should be evaluated for the presence of HIV infection.\r"

Data analysis considered the DNA content of the main stemline and the prevalence of cells in the different compartments of the DNA ploidy histogram in relation to the mitotic activity index and the histologic architecture. Main stemlines were found remarkably stable in different parts of the same tumor. Peridiploid (1.8c to 2.2c) stemlines were found both in well-differentiated and in poorly differentiated tumors. However, low aneuploid (2.2c to 3.0c) stemlines were mostly found in nonsolid tumors and high ploidy (3.2 to 5.04 c) stemlines were prevalent in solid tumors. A comparative analysis between DNA ploidy parameters and mitotic activity was useful to evaluate the expanding modalities of neoplastic cell populations. This analysis revealed that several tumors accumulate an excessive amount of heteroploid cells and others an excessive amount of G2 cells. Yet, most neoplastic cell populations vary from slow to rapidly growing patterns without relevant abnormalities in their ploidy graphic profiles. No relationship was found between stemline ploidy and histologic architecture compared with expanding modalities. These findings indicate that multifaced criteria combining features such as main ploidy, graphic profile, mitotic rate, and histologic architecture measured on one or more microsamples of the same tumor may help to objectively estimate the aggressiveness reached by the neoplastic cells at the time of clinical presentation.\r"

Furthermore, the reaction pattern of the MIC2 antibodies, especially HBA-71, with normal tissues and a great number of benign and malignant tumors (70 different tumors, 199 tumor samples), as well as the correlation between the specific chromosomal aberrations, i.e., the t(11;22) and the del(22) and the expression of this antigen, are demonstrated. Both ES and pPNET cells express the MIC2 gene in very high amounts, which represents a highly selective and almost unique feature of these cells, making an assignment of these tumors in one entity even more likely. The MIC2 antibodies are of great value for clinical and research purposes.\r"

At autopsy, the leptomeninges were infiltrated diffusely with atypical plasma cells. A review of the literature showed that multiple myeloma with meningeal involvement is accompanied frequently by circulating atypical plasma cells or plasma cell leukemia.

  ".W": "To establish an objective basis for therapeutic decisions and follow-up programs in patients with follicular thyroid cancer, the authors developed a prognostic scoring system. The prognostic impact of nine clinical, histologic, and therapeutic parameters was quantified retrospectively based on a multivariate analysis covering 149 patients. The relative relapse risk in follicular thyroid cancer (RR) was 6.8-fold increased in the presence of a moderate when compared with a high degree of histologic tumor differentiation. The RR rose with increasing age of the patient at time of tumor diagnosis by a factor of 1.8 per 20 years. The RR was reduced by a factor of 4.3 after the performance of a neck dissection and by a factor of 2.3 after percutaneous radiation therapy of the neck. The relative mortality risk in follicular thyroid cancer (RM) rose in the absence of a tumor capsule by a factor of 10, in the presence of a moderate compared with a high degree of histologic tumor differentiation by a factor of 5.9, in the presence of distant metastases by a factor of 3.2, and with increasing age of the patient at the time of tumor diagnosis by a factor of 2.2 per 20 years. From these data prognostic indices denoting the individual risk for tumor relapse (IRR index) and tumor mortality (IMR index) were calculated. The indices categorize patients into low-risk, medium-risk, or high-risk groups with regard to tumor relapse and tumor-related death. Consequently, the IRR and IMR indices contribute to select patients with follicular thyroid cancer who need an aggressive form of treatment and an intensive follow-up program. The indices may also be used for risk stratification in prospective therapy trials.\r"

  ".W": "Lung tissue from 221 definite and probable cases of malignant mesothelioma reported to the Australian Mesothelioma Surveillance Program from January 1980 through December 1985 and from an age-sex frequency matched control series of 359 postmortem cases were examined by light microscopic (LM) and analytical transmission electron microscopic (TEM) analysis and energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDAX). Concentrations of total fibers (coated and uncoated) (LM), crocidolite, amosite, chrysotile, and unidentified amphibole (TEM) (fibers/g dry lung tissue) were measured. Fiber concentrations less than 10 microns in length and greater than or equal to 10 microns in length were separately quantified. By comparing cases (221) and controls (359 LM, 103 TEM), odds ratios for increasing fiber concentrations compared with less than 15,000 fibers/g (LM) and less than 200,000 fibers/g (TEM) (the respective detection limits) were calculated. Univariate analyses showed statistically significant dose-response relationships between odds ratio and fiber concentration for all fiber concentration measures. The relationship between log(odds ratio) and log(fiber concentration) was linear. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that a model containing crocidolite greater than or equal to 10 microns, amosite less than 10 microns, and chrysotile less than 10 microns as explanatory variables best described the data. The odds ratios for a X10 increase in fiber concentration (fibers/micrograms) were as follows: crocidolite greater than or equal to 10 microns, 29.4 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.6 to 241); chrysotile less than 10 microns, 15.7 (95% CI, 6.1 to 40); amosite less than 10 microns, 2.3 (95% CI, 1.0 to 5.3). An additive risk model gave similar results. In a subgroup of cases and controls with only chrysotile in the lungs, a significant trend in odds ratio with increasing fiber content was found.\r"

  ".W": "The authors investigated the relationship between flow cytometric DNA index (DI, defined as the ratio of the DNA content of malignant cells to that of normal cells) and other prognostic factors (grade and stage, anatomical site, age and sex) with the survival of 115 patients with colorectal cancer. Multiple biopsy specimens from 62 patients were taken during colonoscopy before surgery. Additional samples from 53 patients were obtained from paraffin-embedded material. All patients were treated with surgery only. Fresh-frozen material gave higher incidence of DNA aneuploidy than paraffin-embedded material (79% versus 41%). The patients with DNA diploid tumors (DI = 1) had a better overall survival than those with DNA aneuploid tumors (DI = 1). Among DNA aneuploid tumors, those with DI greater than 1.2 (excluding DI = 2) were worse than those with DI = 1.2 (excluding DI = 1) and DI = 2. Cox's regression analysis showed that pathologic stage was more important for prognosis than DNA index, whereas age, sex, histologic grade, and anatomic site were removed from the analysis as not relevant for prognosis. Relative risk of death (RR), in reference to patients with DI = 1 and Stages A + B (RR = 1), were RR = 1.8 for patients with carcinomas with Stage C. RR = 2.7 for patients with carcinomas with DNA near-diploid and DNA tetraploid tumors. RR = 3.5 for those with DI greater than 1.2 (excluding DI = 2), and RR = 8.0 for those with Stage D. These data indicate that flow cytometrically evaluated DI values have a relevant independent power for predicting the clinical outcome of colorectal cancer patients.\r"
