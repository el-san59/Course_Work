Thus according to this trial protocol 56 (14%) patients were eligible for recruitment; 36 (9%) patients were finally randomised. These data suggest that treatment with intravenous streptokinase may be applicable to only a small proportion of patients with myocardial infarction.\r"

In contrast, OKT6 antigen was found only on the dendritic cells in the epidermis and dermis in all cases.

The concentration of prorenin in FF was 40 times higher than in plasma taken at the time of FF collection; renin in FF was 10 times higher. The plasma concentration of prorenin, but not of renin, in these women was higher than in non-stimulated women in the late follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. The concentration of reninsubstrate and angiotensin-converting enzyme in FF was 60% of that in plasma. Contamination of blood, which may occur at the time of FF collection, was less than 5%. Prorenin in FF was irreversibly converted into renin after adding trypsin or by endogenous serine protease, using procedures that also cause conversion of prorenin in plasma. These results support the hypothesis that the increased plasma level of prorenin in women whose ovulation is stimulated for the collection of oocytes has originated from the ovary and is under gonadotrophic control. This may also be true for the increase of plasma prorenin that has been observed in non-stimulated women during the luteal phase of the cycle and in early pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "We have shown that cytosol samples from human leukemia cells frequently contain glucocorticoid receptor fragments that have a mol wt (Mr) of approximately 52,000. In the present study we demonstrate that the Mr approximately 52,000-receptor fragments are derived from intact glucocorticoid receptors (Mr approximately 97,000) by the action of a serine protease. Mr approximately 52,000-receptor fragments were present in cytosol from 24 of 52 leukemia cell samples. Only normal size glucocorticoid receptors were present in cytosol samples if diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), a potent inhibitor of serine proteases, was added to the hypotonic buffer used for cytosol preparation. Receptor proteolysis was not inhibited by hydrolyzed DFP, benzamidine, phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, aprotinin, iodoacetamide, or mercuric chloride. The leukemia cell protease digests the receptor at a different site than chymotrypsin, which digests the intact receptor to produce a Mr approximately 40,000 receptor fragment. Receptor messenger RNA (mRNA) in S49 mouse lymphoma cells and in human leukemia cells was analyzed by Northern hybridization with a cDNA for the normal glucocorticoid receptor. Mutant S49 mouse lymphoma cells that have abnormally small glucocorticoid receptors (Mr approximately 48,000) make a 5.0-kilobase receptor transcript in addition to the normal size 6.5-kilobase receptor transcript. A normal size receptor transcript of 6.5 kilobases was present in all of the human leukemia cells whether or not Mr approximately 52,000-receptor fragments were present. Therefore, abnormalities of glucocorticoid receptor mRNA, which may give rise to the synthesis of foreshortened receptors in certain mutant mouse lymphoma cells, are apparently absent from human leukemia cells.\r"

Thrombin-dependent activity was demonstrated to account for 98% of the total transglutaminase activity in U937 cells (1.5 micrograms per 0.5 X 10(6) cells/mL). Intact U937 cells and alveolar macrophages and homogenates from these cells cross-linked fibrin to form gamma-gamma and alpha-polymers. Factor XIII A was detected on the surface of intact U937 cells and macrophages by flow cytometry and 125I-labeling and immunoprecipitation. Cell surface expression of factor XIII A was augmented in the presence of several soluble macrophage activators; however, no concurrent increase in its biosynthesis was observed. The presence and cell surface expression of factor XIII A subunit within macrophages suggest new pathways by which these cells may function in clotting and in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix during inflammation and wound healing.\r"

  ".W": "Thrombocytopenia may accompany variant (type IIB) von Willebrand's disease (vWD) and is thought to result from binding of the abnormal von Willebrand factor (vWF) to the patient's platelets with subsequent platelet aggregate formation and clearance. We have studied a patient with type IIB vWD who became thrombocytopenic during two pregnancies. During the third trimester of pregnancy, her platelet counts dropped to 20,000 to 30,000/microL, and an increase in the intermediate-sized vWF multimers was seen on agarose gel electrophoresis. During this time her platelet-rich plasma showed spontaneous platelet aggregation, and her plasma caused spontaneous aggregation of normal washed platelets. Antibody to platelet glycoprotein Ib completely blocked the spontaneous platelet aggregation, while antibody to platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa did not block the response at the concentrations used. Inhibitors of platelet function that elevate platelet cyclic AMP also blocked the response, but aspirin had no effect on the spontaneous platelet aggregation. The patient illustrates that the platelet counts in one individual can vary greatly in type IIB vWD and that the thrombocytopenia that occurs can appear under physiologic conditions that stimulate the endogenous production of the patient's abnormal vWF. The mechanisms leading to spontaneous platelet aggregation and thrombocytopenia appear to be similar to those described for other patients with type IIB vWD.\r"

DNA from mature human monocytes was cotransfected with DNA from a molecularly cloned feline sarcoma virus containing the v-fms oncogene into NIH-3T3 cells. Transformed mouse fibroblasts that expressed gp55, based on their reactivity with the MY4, B44.1, or LeuM3 monoclonal antibodies, were selected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Regardless of which antibody was used for selection, equivalent binding of all three antibodies was observed for positive transformants. Secondary and tertiary mouse cell transformants were obtained after additional rounds of transfection and cell sorting with the use of DNA from primary and then secondary transformants. Southern blot analysis of the cellular DNA from two independently derived tertiary subclones revealed a limited complement of human sequences, thus indicating that the gene encoding gp55 is included in fewer than 50 kilobases of human DNA. Independently derived tertiary subclones displayed concordant patterns of reactivity with 13 monocyte-specific monoclonal antibodies, thus indicating that each recognized an epitope on the product (gp55) of a single human gene. The 55-kilodalton cell surface polypeptide was specifically immunoprecipitated with a representative monoclonal antibody, 26if, from lysates of enzymatically radioiodinated peripheral blood monocytes and tertiary transformants. We conclude that gp55 is highly immunogenic and that a large number of independently derived monoclonal antibodies specific for human monocytes react with epitopes on this one molecule.\r"

The most common karyotypic change that occurs as CML evolves from chronic phase to blast crisis is the development of multiple Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosomes, each of which is presumably harboring a translocated c-abl oncogene. We describe here a patient with CML who presented in lymphoid blast crisis with three Ph1 chromosomes/metaphase associated with an amplified, rearranged c-abl oncogene fragment and high levels of the aberrant 8-kilobase bcr-abl transcript. This rearranged c-abl fragment was amplified to a similar degree in both the patient's blast crisis cells and in his terminally differentiated granulocytes, but the level of the aberrant CML-specific bcr-abl transcript was some eight- to 16-fold higher in the blast crisis cells v the granulocytes. This analysis indicates that genomic amplification of a translocated c-abl oncogene, although perhaps important in the evolution of CML, nevertheless cannot, by itself, be the sole genetic event giving rise to blast crisis.\r"

The multipotential (CFU-GEMM), erythroid (BFU-E), and granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) progenitor cells in these mice were in a slowly cycling or noncycling state. Intravenous administration of 20,000 units of CSF-1 to these mice stimulated the hematopoietic progenitors into a rapidly cycling state in the marrow and spleen within three hours. Significant increases in absolute numbers of marrow and spleen CFU-GM and spleen BFU-E and CFU-GEMM were also detected. No endotoxin was detected in the CSF-1 preparation by Limulus lysate assay, and treatment of CSF-1 at 100 degrees C for 20 to 30 minutes completely inactivated the in vitro and in vivo stimulating effects. The effects of CSF-1 were not mimicked by the in vivo administration of 0.1 to 10 ng Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. These results suggest that the effects of CSF-1 in vivo were not due to contaminating endotoxin or to a nonspecific protein effect. CSF-1 did not enhance colony formation by BFU-E or stimulate colony formation by CFU-GEMM in vitro, thus suggesting that at least some of the effects of CSF-1 noted in vivo are probably indirect and mediated by accessory cells.\r"

Hence, although the process of carcinogenesis appears to require a multiplicity of changes in the affected cancer-forming cell, such as may be associated with successive stages of tumour initiation, tumour promotion, and tumour progression, only one such change induced by radiation in an appropriate cell may be conceived to increase the probability of neoplasia in a suitably susceptible individual. For this reason, carcinogenic effects of radiation, like mutagenic effects of radiation, are considered for purposes of radiological protection to have no threshold and to behave as stochastic phenomena. In contrast, certain other effects of radiation, such as cataract of the lens, infertility, and depression of the bone marrow, require the killing of many cells in the affected organs. Thus, they vary in severity with the extent of cell loss and have thresholds of detectability which depend on the sensitivity with which the consequences of cell loss can be measured.\r"

New evidence is becoming available about levels of mental impairment of direct interest to radiological protection, but as yet no framework of understanding exists to allow quantitative predictions for the purposes of radiological protection. There is general agreement that malignant disease has been increased following antenatal radiography but no unanimity yet in concluding that irradiation was the main causal factor: reasons are given for accepting that radiography was the cause. Recent increases in biological understanding suggest why maldevelopment is not to be expected after irradiation of the conceptus. A clonal hypothesis for organogenesis provides a reasonable explanation for quantitative aspects of experimental observations on teratogenesis by ionising radiation, including the commonly found highly curvilinear dose-response relationship, the occurrence of so-called critical stages of sensitivity after exposures of a few hundred roentgens, and the reduction in frequency of induced abnormality with protraction of exposure. Clonal hypotheses predict that there will be a virtual threshold for polycystic (non-stochastic) forms of radiation damage. It may be misguided to adopt a linear dose-response relationship for deriving risk estimates for the practical purposes of radiological protection unless some mechanism for production of clinically evident harm can be advanced which provides a plausible reason for expecting linearity.\r"

  ".W": "The main difficulty in presenting radiation risks in their proper perspective is that they must, in most cases, be estimated predictively. This contrasts with most other occupational and public risks, of which the magnitude and severity are known from past records and experience. The problem is greater at the low effective dose rates now observed in the majority of all forms of exposure, usually of less than 3 mSv per year from natural causes, from occupational exposure, and from exposure of \"critical groups\" of the general public. For most of these populations there are particular problems also in epidemiological studies at low dose, in addition to those due to the very large numbers of person-years that need to be studied and the long latencies of most radiation effects. Adequate estimates can, however, now be made of the carcinogenic risk of exposure at higher dose of various organs selectively and of the whole body uniformly, and of modes of inference to the risk at lower dose. Estimates can also be made of the risks of inducing major types of inheritable and developmental abnormality. An essential step in viewing the sum of all such radiation risks in the perspective of other occupational and public risks must now be to develop an informed consensus on the relative weight that is regarded as attaching to hazards of different kind and severity.\r"

At 6 weeks, 1,5 and 10 years postoperatively gastric secretory tests, haematological work-up and clinical examination or telephone interview were performed. There was no operative mortality and the frequency of postoperative sequelae was minimal. The cumulative ulcer recurrence rate was 18 per cent and another 14 per cent had slight to moderate symptoms of epigastric pain without any signs of ulcer. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was used to reveal recurrences but was performed only if the patient had symptoms of recurrence. A rise in basal acid secretion and in pentagastrin-stimulated secretion was observed the first year postoperatively, whereas insulin-stimulated peak acid output increased during the first 5 years. We conclude that PCV has a low rate of per- and postoperative complications and an acceptable recurrence rate. Therefore, it seems that PCV is the method of choice in chronic duodenal ulcer disease.\r"

We have evaluated this incision and tested the necessity for closing the deep peritoneal layer by a prospective randomized trial. All 206 patients undergoing laparotomy in the Surgical Unit in 1984, both elective and emergency cases, were included. In patients undergoing laparotomy through unscarred tissue, a lateral paramedian incision was performed and they were randomized to have either the peritoneum closed (n = 77) or left open (n = 75). Patients in whom the laparotomy was performed through a previous incision (n = 51) and those in whom the abdomen had to be opened urgently (n = 3) were excluded from the trial but studied separately (n = 54). The rectus sheath was closed with monofilament nylon in all cases. Patients were assessed for wound integrity during the immediate postoperative period and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after operation. So far the patients have been followed up for between 1 and 2 years and follow-up is continuing as in some cases incisional hernia may not be detected until several years after operation. There have been no cases of burst abdomen. No incisional hernias have developed in patients in whom a lateral paramedian incision was performed and the peritoneum was closed, and one incisional hernia has occurred in the patients in whom the peritoneum was left open. Seven incisional hernias have occurred in patients excluded from the trial of the lateral paramedian incision (13 per cent). We conclude that the lateral paramedian incision successfully abolishes the burst abdomen and that incisional hernia is rare. It is not necessary to close the peritoneum with this incision.\r"

A double-blind randomized controlled trial of 14-valent pneumococcal vaccine was carried out in 189 men and women aged 40 to 89 years with a clinical diagnosis of COPD and a forced expiratory volume in 1 second of less than 1.5 L. Of the 189, 92 received the vaccine and 97 received saline placebo. In a randomly chosen subsample of those who received the vaccine the mean titres of specific IgG antibody to selected pneumococcal polysaccharide serotypes increased two- to threefold by 4 weeks after vaccination. Over a 2-year period the rates of death, hospital admissions and emergency visits and the mean length of hospital stay were not significantly different in the two groups. Although a protective effect of 14-valent pneumococcal vaccine could not be shown, the small size of the sample and the relatively low follow-up rates preclude firm conclusions about efficacy from these data alone. The elevated antibody levels before vaccination in some of the patients, suggesting prior infection with Diplococcus pneumoniae, may partly explain the findings.\r"

When asthma is of more than mild severity, a second agent that acts through a different pharmacologic pathway is added. Although theophylline has traditionally been this second agent, recent concerns about its safety have prompted increasing use of inhalational agents such as corticosteroids, anticholinergics and mast cell stabilizers as appropriate second-line therapy. The use of such combination regimens and newer strategies such as high-dose inhaled corticosteroid therapy will reduce the proportion of patients who require systemic corticosteroid therapy for adequate control of asthma. The use of combination inhalational therapy also has a role in the management of asthma in the emergency department, the combination of a nebulized adrenoreceptor agonist and a nebulized anticholinergic being more effective than either agent alone in acute, severe asthma. The role of newer xanthine derivatives, antihistamines, calcium channel blockers and selective anti-inflammatory agents remains investigational.\r"

However, epidemiologic studies have failed to support the hypothesis that larger amounts of calcium are associated with increased bone density or a decreased incidence of fractures. The authors examine the evidence from controlled trials on the effects of calcium supplementation and physical activity on bone loss and find that weight-bearing activity, if undertaken early in life and on a regular basis, can increase the peak bone mass of early adulthood, delay the onset of bone loss and reduce the rate of loss. All of these factors will delay the onset of fractures. Carefully planned and supervised physical activity programs can also provide a safe, effective therapy for people who have osteoporosis.\r"

Vimentin, keratin, laminin, and peanut (PNA) lectin were immunohistochemically demonstrated in two cases of MRT. Tissue polypeptide antigen (TPA) was detected in one case. As for BMRT, the metastatic lesion exhibited numerous rosette-like structures of tumor cells. Vimentin was immunohistochemically demonstrated in one case, but no other antibodies were stained in two cases. Two cases of classical Wilms' tumor immunohistochemically demonstrated vimentin, keratin, PNA lectin, and TPA.

Seven of the small cell components also were assessed by electron microscopic examination. Using neuron-specific enolase (NSE), prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) on tissue sections, three distinctive immunostaining patterns of small cell carcinoma components were identified: staining positive for NSE and negative for PSA and PAP (10 cases), staining positive for PSA and PAP and negative for NSE (3 cases), and negative reaction for all three antigens (5 cases). Electron microscopic study demonstrated neurosecretory granules in two cases. Based on the immunostaining and electron microscopic findings, small cell carcinomas of the prostate appear to be a heterogeneous group of tumors. Some of them are neuroendocrine carcinomas whereas others are poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas or, possibly, reserve cell carcinomas. Differences in immunostaining patterns or presence and absence of adenocarcinoma component do not reflect any differences in the uniformly poor prognosis of small cell carcinomas, in which median survivals is 7.7 months. The authors believe that, because of such heterogeneity, small cell carcinomas of the prostate arise from multipotential prostatic epithelium and that an origin from specific neuroendocrine cells need not be implicated.\r"

  ".W": "Of 227 cases of pediatric non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with adequate histopathologic material for review, 72 (32%) were classified as diffuse \"histiocytic\" lymphoma (DHL). These cases were further divided into different morphologic subtypes according to the Lukes-Collins classification, and the National Cancer Institute Working Formulation, to ascertain whether there were any significant prognostic differences among the different subtypes. The results of our study showed that 40 patients were classified as immunoblastic lymphomas, and 32 were called large follicular center cell (FCC) tumors. Of the 40 patients with immunoblastic histology, 19 had morphologic features of the clear cell type and were interpreted as consistent with T-immunoblastic lymphomas; an additional two had polymorphous features also consistent with T-cell type: 17 had plasmacytoid features, and were morphologically classified as B-immunoblastic lymphomas; two could not be subtyped. Of the 32 patients with morphologic features of FCC lymphomas, 29 were classified as large noncleaved type, and three as large cleaved type. A clinicopathologic analysis showed that 90% of the patients obtained complete remission, and there were no significant differences in complete remission rate among the different morphologic subtypes of DHL. The estimated five year disease-free survival for all patients was over 70%, with no failure after the second year; and there were no significant differences in the disease-free survival among the different subtypes. The only clinical differences that we found, were that patients with lymphomas of FCC (large noncleaved) type were younger (P = 0.01); had less nodal involvement (P = 0.03); and had more organ involvement (P less than 0.01). We conclude that the morphologic subclassification of DHL in children currently has limited clinical prognostic significance.\r"

A two-mutation theory of oncogenesis has been proposed in which a prezygotic gene mutation and a postzygotic mutation lead to the development of Wilms' tumor. However, the recent discovery of a postzygotic deletion within the 11p13 band of chromosome 11 in adult cases of Wilms' tumor may explain the rarity of the bilateral form in later years. Early diagnosis is difficult because of the nonspecificity of signs and symptoms. Computer tomography, ultrasonography, and arteriography are important modalities in the earlier diagnosis of adult Wilms' tumor. Because of the rarity of these tumors, no definitive guidelines for treatment have emerged. However, a multidisciplinary approach incorporating surgery, chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy has been used most often but with varying success. This report documents the second case of bilateral adult Wilms' tumor presenting as perinephric hematomas which partially resolved.\r"

Consolidation therapy was given to 30 of 48 responders (63%), of whom 23 received sequential hemibody irradiation (HBI) at 8 cGy, corrected in the upper half for lung transmission. Seven received high dose cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (TBI) with subsequent infusion of stored, cryopreserved autologous bone marrow. The response rate to induction therapy was 71% (complete [CR] in 21%). The median survival for all patients entered in this study is 12 months. With consolidation, one CR patient who received cyclophosphamide and TBI is disease free at 20+ months, off all treatment, while HBI did not produce longterm remissions. Of 17 partial response (PR) patients, two of 12 improved to CR with HBI, and one of five improved with cyclophosphamide plus TBI, but all ultimately relapsed. The main toxicity of sequential HBI was myelosuppression, with prolonged thrombocytopenia in 13%; only one case of radiation pneumonitis occurred (3%). Cyclophosphamide and TBI produced temporary, reversible marrow aplasia without other major toxicity. We recommend further investigation of Cytoxan (Bristol Myers Oncology Division, Evansville, IN) and TBI for breast cancer patients in remission after chemotherapy.\r"

DNA hybridization showed no evidence of gene amplification or rearrangement. Transcripts of the c-myc messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) were elevated up to 32-fold in 12 of 15 tumors. The gene product, p62c-myc, was detected by both immunoblotting and immunohistology using a monoclonal antibody raised against a synthetic peptide immunogen. There was close correlation between c-myc mRNA copy number and p62c-myc abundance. Three well differentiated tumors contained high levels of transcript and protein, whereas four poorly differentiated tumors had the lowest levels. The assay of oncogene products may provide new biologically relevant tumor markers for determining prognosis and guiding treatment.\r"

  ".W": "We reported the morphologic, phenotypic and functional characteristics of leukemic cells with natural killer (NK) properties in a case of T chronic lymphocytic leukemia with large granular lymphocytes. These cells were cytologically and cytochemically characterized as phosphatase acid positive large granular lymphocytes (LGL), and presented parallel tubular arrays at the ultra structural level. They displayed a CD2, CD3, CD8, CD11, Leu 7, and Leu 11 positive phenotype while they lacked B cell markers including surface immunoglobulins. In addition, they expressed human leukocyte antigens (HLA) Class I, but no Class II antigens. These phenotypic studies were also performed after cells were cultured in vitro with 12-0-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate, gamma interferon, 5-azacytidine, sodium butyrate, phytohemagglutinin, and interleukin 2 (IL2). The cell surface markers underwent several significant changes. Among them we noted a higher percentage of labeled cells with anti-CD6 and CD7 monoclonal antibodies (moAbs), and a positivity with an anti-CD19 (B4) moAb. The leukemic LGL spontaneously developed a NK activity on K 562 tumor cells, which was not affected under the various T and B cells growth factors because they became more sensitive to IL2; but they were also stimulated by a 50-kilodalton (KD) B cell growth factor (BCGF) factor devoid of any T cell proliferation activity. Together these results gave a better characterization of azurophilic granules containing T chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and enabled the documentation of the differentiation of LGL with NK activity.\r"

The LFT results of 17 patients with carcinoid tumors metastatic to the liver were compared with 17 patients with other malignant tumors. In the noncarcinoid group, 82.4% of the patients had elevated alkaline phosphatase (AP) or gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP), whereas only 28.6% of carcinoid patients had abnormal enzymes. The medians of all LFT values were significantly higher in noncarcinoid patients than in the carcinoid group, except for glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT). Our data indicate that LFT are helpful in screening for liver metastases in patients with noncarcinoid tumors, but are unreliable in carcinoid tumors. Imaging tests should be used to rule out liver metastases in carcinoid tumors, irrespective of LFT results.\r"

In male patients, E2-positive cases occurred without age distinction. In female patients, however, E2 was not found in patients in older age groups, especially patients in the postmenopausal state. Microscopically, E2 was found frequently in intestinal type of cancers in male patients and in cancer with scirrhous growth pattern, in female patients. This is the first report of the demonstration of E2 in gastric cancer. The findings suggest that hormonal factors are involved in gastric cancer, and that the cancers contain endocrinic characteristics.\r"

The tumors are usually large and polypoid, and on microscopic examination contain an intimate admixture of malignant epithelial and mesenchymal elements. The former may resemble transitional cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma; and the latter, fibrosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, or undifferentiated sarcoma: skeletal muscle, osseous, and/or cartilaginous differentiation has occurred in from 25% to 50% of the tumors. Sixteen patients died as a result of their tumors; four others had metastatic disease and three were lost to follow-up. Twelve patients were alive and free of disease from 5 months to 7 years postoperatively. Most of the 12 underwent radical cystectomy, preceded in some cases by radiation therapy, but four underwent a more conservative operation.\r"

A375 human melanoma cells were induced to differentiate with n-butyric acid and used as immunogen. When frozen sections of nevomelanocytic lesions were tested with TNKH1 obtained by this method, 15 of 15 acquired nevus cell nevi, and two of two congenital melanocytic nevi showed strong reactivity; whereas five of five primary melanomas (three nodular, one lentigo maligna, and one subungual), as well as 10 of 10 metastatic melanomas were nonreactive. One superficial spreading melanoma showed residual TNKH1-positive nevus cells, and TNKH1-negative melanoma cells. Four of six dysplastic nevi, which would be precursors of some malignant melanomas, showed heterogeneity in staining intensity with TNKH1; indicating the initial change of malignant transformation. No reaction was found with normal melanocytes. Thus, the antigen that TNKH1 defines is present on benign nevus cells, and absent on malignant cells as well as normal melanocytes. TNKH1 could be a powerful tool not only for the diagnosis of malignant melanoma, but also for the assessment of the ontogeny of various melanomas.\r"

By univariate analysis, prognostically significant factors, in order of decreasing importance, were mitoses (log), necrosis, nuclear cytologic atypia, vascular hypertrophy, and vascular proliferation. When studied by stepwise regression, necrosis and the number of mitoses contained all of the prognostically useful information. When each of the five variables significant by univariate analysis was tested in the Cox model by adding a variable to the model containing the other four, necrosis was found to be the only independently significant variable. There were significant positive pairwise correlations between each of the five significant histologic variables except for cytologic atypia with necrosis. The only histologic variable with a significant association with older age was the number of mitoses. These results suggest that necrosis and, to a lesser extent, the mitotic count are features that, in the appropriate setting, can be used to identify the \"anaplastic\" oligodendroglioma.\r"

No correlation was found between expression of SSEA-1, and RCC morphology or pattern of growth. Because SSEA-1 is found on proximal tubules in the normal kidney, these results support the hypothesis that RCC arises from the cells of the proximal tubule. Furthermore, since greater than 60% of the RCCs examined expressed SSEA-1, this antigen may prove to be a useful target for immunolocation or therapy of metastatic RCC.\r"

A heterogeneous population of cells consisting of sheets of transformed lymphocytes in combination with clusters of bizarre, atypical histiocytes developed in a patient with a history of longstanding CLL. Immunocytochemistry using a panel of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies by immunoperoxidase techniques identified the presence of both B-lymphocytic and monocytic-histiocytic cell lines of differentiation. A mechanism of multiple differentiation is proposed to account for the dual cell population observed in this patient. Review of the literature appears to indicate that this phenomenon often may be involved in cases diagnosed as Richter's syndrome. The demonstration of cellular heterogeneity in the current case underscores the need for establishing a more precise definition for the histologic characterization of the terminal malignancy in Richter's syndrome.\r"

In other areas the tumor had a loose, spindle appearance, with some cells showing more elongated nuclei, and fibrillar pink cytoplasm consistent with strap cells. Cross striations were not found. Electron microscopy showed desmosomes and 7 to 10 nm cytoplasmic filaments forming dense bodies. The findings are most consistent with a primitive sarcoma, probably rhabdomyosarcoma. Immunoperoxidase with three monoclonal antibodies for common leukocyte antigen showed diffuse membraneous staining with fresh-frozen tissue. All other lymphocyte and monocyte marker studies were negative. We believe that this case of anticommon leukocyte antigen staining, a rhabdomyosarcoma, represents the first report of a false positive reaction with monoclonal antibody to common leukocyte antigen.\r"

The cartilaginous areas sometimes showed considerable dystrophic calcification. With one exception, all tumors of this group occurred in soft tissue and demonstrated benign clinical behavior. The single malignant tumor originated in bone, recurred locally, and metastasized to lung. The tumors comprising the remaining three groups (six tumors) occurred in bone, demonstrated benign clinical behavior, and were grouped according to their close resemblance to tumors known to occur in bone, that is osteoblastoma-like (four tumors), nonossifying fibroma-like (two tumors), and ossifying fibroma-like (one tumor).\r"

Median survivals of approximately 10 years despite recurrent disease are characteristic of the majority of follicular lymphomas. Furthermore, the reproducibility of cytologic diagnosis among follicular lymphomas is known to be variable.

Cytokeratins were only identified in epithelial components which were present in some of these tumors. Intermediate filament typing in these endometrial neoplasms contributes to the elucidation of histogenetic problems, may delineate mesenchymal from epithelial elements, may separate muscle from stromal lesions and in one instance helped to define a hitherto unreported diffuse clear cell stromal sarcoma.\r"

  ".W": "The occurrence of liver metastases was evaluated by ultrasonic scanning and correlated with prognostic factors, pattern of metastases, clinical examination, biochemical liver function tests from serum, and liver biopsy specimens in 394 consecutive evaluable patients with first recurrence of breast cancer. Fifty-nine patients (15%) had a positive scan, and liver metastases were the only sign of recurrent disease in 11 of these patients. The presence of liver metastases was not associated with age, menopausal status, size of the primary tumor, regional lymph node status, or the length of the recurrence-free interval; but patients with liver metastases were significantly closer to the menopause than those without (P = 0.02). The diagnostic value of clinical examinations was comparable to that of serum bilirubin and serum aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) analyses, but was significantly better than alkaline phosphatase (AP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) analyses. Analysis of serum AP was not a valuable diagnostic tool in the diagnosis of liver metastases, since it was elevated in 58% of the patients with bone metastases, and since metastases in this site were found in one third of the patients without liver metastases. If all four tests were negative, liver metastases were excluded in 99% of the patients, and if more than two of the four tests were positive, liver metastases were found in 95%. Valid (greater than 80%) diagnosis of liver metastases by serum LDH or serum ASAT alone, required an elevation of three or five times the upper normal limits, respectively. Thirty-nine patients with positive ultrasonography results underwent biopsy. The ultrasonographic diagnosis could not be confirmed histologically in three patients (8%). If ultrasonic scanning had not been performed routinely, only one of 213 patients (0.5%) with soft tissue metastases would have been offered local therapy rather than systemic treatment. These data suggest that ultrasonic scanning of the liver should not be a routine diagnostic tool in examination of patients with first recurrence of breast cancer. However, whenever indicated by clinical signs or elevated blood tests, scanning should be performed to confirm the presence of liver metastases, particularly in patients entering therapeutical trials, since liver metastases demonstrated by ultrasound examinations may serve as a measurable parameter.\r"

The tissue form is designated MMA. When MMA circulates in plasma, it undergoes stepwise, post-translational modification, mediated by proteolytic enzymes in plasma and giving rise to isoforms called MMB and MMC, which lack carboxy terminal lysine on one or two subunits, respectively. We have shown previously that changes with time in plasma profiles of MM creatine kinase (CK) isoforms in dogs reflect myocardial infarction within 1 hour after the onset of coronary occlusion and permit noninvasive detection of reperfusion within 30 minutes after release of an occlusive coronary arterial ligature. However, analysis of MM CK isoforms in plasma from patients has been hampered by the lack of availability of quantitative as opposed to qualitative methods. This study was performed to develop and validate an assay with the sensitivity and specificity needed for accurate quantification of MM CK isoforms in samples of plasma from patients. A rapid assay procedure will be required ultimately for prospective, clinical use. However, as a first step and for use in development and standardization of rapid assays, a procedure is needed for accurate qualification of isoforms even if its implementation is laborious and slow. The isoform composition of normal plasma was found to comprise 32.0% MMA, 34.9% MMB, and 32.7% MMC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The majority of studies on the control of coronary artery vasoactivity have examined changes in coronary blood flow and coronary vascular resistance, indices that primarily reflect regulation of small arterioles and precapillary vessels. With the emergence of coronary artery vasospasm as a significant cause of angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, and sudden death, the control of large coronary artery caliber has assumed more significance. It is clear that resistance coronary vessels and large coronary arteries differ in response to both pharmacologic and physiologic stimuli. Vasodilation of large coronary arteries may occur by direct action of agents on the arterial smooth muscle or by the indirect action of receptor occupation, changes in blood flow, or liberation of endothelial factors. These indirect factors appear to contribute also to responses to agents that constrict coronary smooth muscle directly or through the autonomic nervous system. Furthermore, the mechanisms responsible for control of large coronary vessels in the normal circulation are likely to be profoundly different from those in the presence of diseased vessels. For example, several factors associated with coronary artery disease--elevated plasma cholesterol levels, endothelial disruption, atherosclerosis, vascular stenosis, and aggregated platelets--all have important actions on the control of large coronary arteries.\r"

To further study this phenomenon, neonatal rat aortic smooth muscle cells were placed in cell culture and studied over time. Numerous cells with tetraploid and even octaploid DNA content appeared beginning in primary cultures. These increases in DNA content per cell were determined by quantitative fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, and true polyploidy was confirmed by chromosome counts. In contrast, cells from adult rat aortas failed to produce significant polyploid cells over time in culture. In vitro culture of neonatal aortic cells may therefore be a model system for studying the initiation of polyploidy in arterial smooth muscle.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine the contribution of prostaglandins to the reflex cardiovascular responses induced by static contraction of the hind limb in cats, i.e., the exercise reflex. To accomplish this, the cardiovascular responses to hind limb contraction induced by electrical stimulation of spinal cord ventral roots L6-7 and S1 were compared before and after inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis (indomethacin, 2-6 mg/kg i.v., n = 5, or sodium meclofenamate, 2-6 mg/kg i.v., n = 5) or after injection of prostaglandin E2 into the hind limb arterial blood supply. Treatment with indomethacin attenuated the contraction-induced increase in mean arterial pressure and left ventricular dP/dt by 76% and 86%, respectively. Heart rate and average developed triceps surae muscle tension were unchanged. After administering sodium meclofenamate, the reflex response was attenuated to a similar degree. In the indomethacin-treated animals, injection of exogenous prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) partially restored the pressor and myocardial contractile responses. In 6 animals, treatment with exogenous PGE2 without prior inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis did not significantly augment the contraction-induced cardiovascular response. Using the radioactive microsphere technique, we measured skeletal muscle blood flow during contraction before and after treatment with indomethacin (n = 6) to determine if an indomethacin-induced alteration in blood flow could account for the attenuated contraction-induced cardiovascular response. Blood flow during static muscle contraction was not significantly altered by indomethacin. We conclude that prostaglandins contribute to the exercise reflex through an action on afferent nerve endings rather than through a regional vascular effect.\r"

  ".W": "In a previous study of 543 patients we developed, using echocardiographic left ventricular mass as the reference standard, two new sets of criteria that improve the electrocardiographic diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). One set of criteria, which is suitable for routine clinical use, detects LVH when the sum of voltage in RaVL + SV3 (Cornell voltage) exceeds 2.8 mV in men and 2.0 mV in women. The second set of criteria, suitable for use in interpretation of the computerized electrocardiogram, uses logistic regression models based on electrocardiographic and demographic variables with independent predictive value for LVH, with separate equations for patients in sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation. To test these criteria prospectively with use of a different reference standard, antemortem electrocardiograms were compared with left ventricular muscle mass measured at autopsy in 135 patients. Sensitivity of standard Sokolow-Lyon voltage (SLV) criteria (SV1 + RV5 or RV6 greater than 3.5 mV) for LVH was only 22%, but specificity was 100%. The Cornell voltage criteria improved sensitivity to 42%, while maintaining high specificity at 96%. Higher sensitivity (62%) was achieved by use of the new regression criteria, with a specificity of 92%. Overall test accuracy was 60% for SLV criteria, 68% for the Cornell voltage criteria, and 77% for the new regression criteria (p less than .005 vs SLV). We conclude that the Cornell voltage criteria improve the sensitivity of the electrocardiogram for detection of LVH and are easily applicable in clinical practice.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Since that time, there has been continued improvement and simplification of the equipment as well as in the implantation technique. Following a Food and Drug Administration protocol, a multicenter study was conducted to test the safety and effectiveness of this interventional method. The clinical results from three major regional test centers (Philadelphia, Houston, and New Haven) are presented. One hundred forty-six patients from a test population of 156 were treated for PDA with use of the Rashkind PDA Occluder Systems. Successful closure was accomplished in 94 (66%) of the total cases. Ten patients (7%) retained residual ductal murmurs despite correct placement of the occlusion devices; five additional patients (3%) were considered failures due to the presence of abnormal Doppler flow patterns after the procedure. Postrelease embolizations occurred in 19 (15%) instances. One patient required emergency surgical intervention after attempted retrieval of an embolized occluder. With the improvements in the manufacturing of the double-disk occluder systems as well as the perfection of the transvenous delivery technique, the incidences of closure failure and postrelease complications have decreased. Since January 1984, 78% of all transcatheter closure attempts were successful, with 10% embolization.\r"

To determine whether similar differences in regression of wall thickening also occur in resistance vessels during treatment, matched groups of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were treated for 12 weeks with either hydralazine (H) or captopril and hydrochlorothiazide (C-D) and they were compared with untreated SHR and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Perfusion pressure was then determined in the hindlimbs of pithed rats under conditions of constant blood flow (4.0 ml/min) and maximal vasodilation (hemodilution to 22% hematocrit combined with continuous nitroprusside and papaverine infusion). This perfusion pressure, which has been validated as an index of thickening (hypertrophy) of resistance vessels walls, averaged 26.8 +/- 0.4(SE) mm Hg in untreated WKY (n = 12) and 37.6 +/- 0.4 mm Hg in untreated SHR (n = 11) (p less than .01). Treatment with H or C-D controlled blood pressure equally in SHR, but the two drugs had significantly different effects on both left ventricular hypertrophy and resistance vessels. Perfusion pressure was reduced from 37.6 +/- 0.4 mm Hg to 34.0 +/- 0.5 mm Hg (p less than .01) with C-D but only to 36.5 +/- 0.5 mm Hg with H (NS). Left ventricular weight was significantly reduced by C-D (2.02 +/- 0.02 vs 2.63 +/- 0.05 mg/g, p less than .01) but only to 2.44 +/- 0.05 mg/g by H.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because of these problems, isolation from friends typically occurs, re-employment is difficult, and there are social and sexual tensions within families.

Her condition was improved by steroid treatment in a few months, but moderate proteinuria persisted. Five and half years later, follow-up biopsy showed typical pathological features of dense deposit disease. It is suggested that the lamellation of the lamina densa in the first biopsy could be related to the dense alteration of glomerular basement membrane in the second biopsy.\r"

  ".W": "The foregoing discussions bring to mind several salient facts: Although numerous barriers to infection exist, this aspect is understood incompletely. Conclusions on the pathogenicity or nonpathogenicity of certain organisms are often made from studies with very small numbers of patients, or in very specific patient populations. When such entities as low birth weight, premature labor, and PROM, which are all obviously related to some extent, are studied, very complicated analyses on large numbers of patients are required. Most of the organisms discussed are considered to be sexually transmitted. Because STDs are generally recognized to travel together in the same patient populations, the statistics necessary to separate one organism from another are complex indeed. The previous discussion notwithstanding, it is extremely difficult to form a solid conclusion about relation of these organisms to PROM with confidence. Many more patients need to be studied through many more pregnancies. In addition, differences among population subgroups make extrapolation extremely difficult. Currently the Louisiana State University is participating in a large, multicenter, collaborative study under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health. This study should provide an adequate data base concerning most of the isolates discussed and potential adverse outcomes of pregnancy. Then definitive statements may be made regarding both the screening of pregnant women and initiation of selective therapy. Specific management recommendations are discussed by Nagey and Saller in this symposium.\r"

As new information surfaces, the decisions presented in this article can be reevaluated and a new protocol similar to that in Figure 1 developed. On admission of the patient a fetal monitor is placed and intravenous hydration begun. A complete history and physical examination allow accurate estimation of gestational age and diagnosis of ruptured membranes. Any contraindications to tocolysis can be uncovered at this time. If the patient is a candidate for tocolysis, if there are no signs of chorioamnionitis, if there is no fetal distress, and if no contraindications are occurring, then tocolysis may begin. Betamethasone may then be given, (though its use in PROM is not advised), and surveillance for signs of chorioamnionitis may begin. The patient is seen twice daily for abdominal examination. The white blood count is measured at least daily, and maternal vital signs and fetal heart rate are determined every 4 hours. Once signs of chorioamnionitis occur or labor begins (perhaps again) more than 48 hours after admission, then delivery is allowed. If the presentation is vertex, then vaginal delivery is allowed in the absence of fetal distress. Under any other circumstances, abdominal delivery is accomplished. If PROM occurs outside a hospital equipped with a regional intensive care nursery, and if maternal transport can be safely performed, then the mother is transported to a regional center. No digital cervical examination is to be performed until delivery is inevitable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Preterm delivery is currently the leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. PROM is the most common easily identifiable cause of preterm delivery, present in 20-30% of preterm births. The conflicting results of success in prematurity prevention programs obtained by different investigators probably reflect the populations that were studied. Meis and colleagues divided the etiologies of low birth weight into four categories: 1) Low birth weight in infants greater than 37 weeks' gestation, 2) PROM, 3) birth weight caused by medical complications, and 4) idiopathic premature labor (IPL). In patients seen in the county health department clinic (1,529 births), IPL accounted for 25% of birth weights less than 2,500 g. In contrast, patients seen in a large private obstetric practice (1,327 births), IPL was the etiology of low birth weight in 47% of patients. Not surprisingly, a prematurity prevention program has not reduced the rate of low birth weight for the public patients but has resulted in decreases of low birth weight for the private patients. Paramount in the prevention of preterm birth is physician education regarding known risk factors, signs and symptoms of preterm labor, and the role of close follow-up in the patients identified as high risk. Papiernik's success with limitation of physical efforts and work leave, when appropriate, in high-risk patients is laudable and, many feel, should be emulated. Prenatal care must include for each woman education concerning the signs and symptoms of preterm labor and PROM. Individual risk factors must be ascertained and followed with appropriate observation, therapy, and/or modification plans. Finally, the early detection of preterm labor will expedite prompt treatment and so increase chances of postponing delivery.\r"

However, two forms of evidence that would establish more clearly such a role lack for all of the organisms presented: recovery of the same organism from the products of conception in successive pregnancy losses, and demonstration of improved pregnancy outcome following specific treatment in a randomized prospective controlled trial. While acquisition of such data is scientifically justified, the necessary study designs may be viewed as unethical if the body of information derived from circumstantial cases and therapeutic trials using historical controls only continues to shape clinical opinion. Further confirmation of a specific role in pregnancy wastage for any of these organisms eventually will have to address the mysterious discrepancy between the prevalence of colonization and the incidence of sporadic and recurrent abortion purportedly due to the organism.\r"

  ".W": "With all of this information about trophoblast antigens, it is necessary to have a working hypothesis of how these antigens might be dealt with by a normal woman's immunologic system. Two sets of observations have helped formulate such a working hypothesis. First is the finding that trophoblast is the only normal tissue recognized by antibodies to TA1 (and it is exceedingly difficult to demonstrate maternal anti-TA1 in normal pregnancies). Second is the serologic result that antibodies to TLX antigens within the TA2 group are lymphocytotoxic (and maternal anti-TLX can be demonstrated both in normal and abnormal pregnancies). We interpret this as meaning that TA1 is \"foreign\" (i.e., oncoextraembryonic) antigen and TA2 (TLX) is \"self\"-antigen, and that mothers have TA2 (TLX) reactive B-lymphocytes in their repertoire. Antigen-reactive B-lymphocytes can be activated to produce TA1-blocking antibodies by either allotypic TA2 (TLX) in seminal plasma or allogeneic trophoblast membrane antigens during the host-versus-graft reaction subsequent to blastocyst implantation. If allotypic or allogeneic stimulation fails to produce an adequate anti-TA2 (TLX) response, the oncoextra-embryonic TA1 antigens are recognized and rapidly rejected. If allotypic or allogeneic stimulation produces an aberrant anti-TA2 (TLX) response (e.g., a cytotoxic rather than a blocking antibody), the extra-embryonic membranes and placenta come under immune attack and eventually are rejected. This working hypothesis has led us to develop new immunologic approaches to the diagnosis and prevention of some types of pregnancy failures in both mice and human beings.\r"

In the tibia, single-stage grafting procedures to accomplish this reconstruction requires major tissue sacrifice from adjacent areas and often results in amputation. A series of nine patients with tibial segmental diaphyseal bone loss were treated with multistaged surgical reconstruction. All nine were patients with severe trauma, with soft-tissue loss and local sepsis, who were candidates for amputation. The follow-up period averaged 5.5 years. All of the patients achieved healed, stable legs. All but one were fully ambulatory without a brace eight to 15 months after the first stage of bone grafting. There were several minor complications, which were satisfactorily treated. Multistaged bone graft operations were relatively low-risk, with a high incidence of success for treatment of major tibial segmental bone loss.\r"

Strains above that threshold affect modeling and remodeling activities in ways that change the size and configuration of growing bones, tendons, ligaments, and fascia to fit their new mechanical usage and return their strains to the threshold level. Were that threshold set too high from birth, the effects of normal function on remodeling and modeling should lead to thin fibrous tissue structures, to slender, osteopenic diaphyses and spongiosa, and to increased fragility. Those and other predictable set point effects fit so precisely many of the known hard and soft tissue abnormalities of osteogenesis imperfecta patients, that an elevated MES set point may be a heretofore unrecognized basic pathogenetic factor in that disease.\r"

Hydralazine decreased afterload (end-systolic wall stress) and increased venous return and left ventricular performance (by M-mode echocardiography). Both beta-blockers blunted the increases in heart rate, cardiac output, and venous return similarly, although heart rate and cardiac output were not completely normalized. Atenolol did not affect the hydralazine-induced decrease in afterload, whereas propranolol significantly opposed this change (P less than 0.03). The hyperdynamic circulation seen with hydralazine is mostly beta mediated, primarily beta 1. When given with hydralazine the two beta-blocker types differ primarily in their effects on afterload.\r"

Indenolol (30 to 120 mg) reduced blood pressure in a dose-dependent fashion. Maximum reduction was 26 mm Hg for systolic and 17 mm Hg for diastolic pressure. Hypotensive activity commenced within 10 minutes, peaked in 60 minutes, and persisted for about 7 hours. Lower limb vascular resistance (strain-gauge plethysmography) was significantly lowered, thus suggesting an intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Heart rate was progressively reduced at 30 and 60 mg without any additional effect at 120 mg. Indenolol did not alter adrenergic reflexes (standing, cold application, and hand-grip) and did not induce any side effect. In conclusion, indenolol possesses an antihypertensive activity associated with reduction of vascular resistance.\r"

Experiments were carried out on human volunteers to investigate the effect of infusion of lipid into either the duodenum or ileum on blood glucose, insulin and gastric emptying after ingestion of a mashed potato meal. Infusions of lipid into either the duodenum or the ileum significantly reduced or abolished the immediate postprandial rises in blood glucose and insulin and significantly delayed gastric emptying. Blood glucose and insulin rose shortly after the lipid infusion terminated. Addition of corn oil to a meal of mashed potato also reduced blood glucose and insulin and delayed gastric emptying. Intestinal lipid can thus modify the glycaemic and insulinaemic responses to a meal, and this modulation probably explains the reduced metabolic responses to a meal containing fat compared with a fat free meal. This principle could be of value in the dietary control of diabetes mellitus.\r"

The urinary excretion of two low molecular weight proteins, retinol-binding protein and beta 2-microglobulin, increased 1000- and 500-fold respectively above the values found after administration of saline as a control. The urinary excretion of albumin did not change significantly (P greater than 0.5). In the hour after Haemaccel administration the excretion of the two low molecular weight proteins approached at least 50% of a predicted filtered load. This effect of Haemaccel may be due to inhibition of proximal tubular uptake or transport of the two proteins. Absence of any effect on albumin excretion suggests alternative mechanisms for its tubular reabsorption. Haemaccel may be a valuable new agent for the study of renal tubular protein metabolism.\r"

Biological activity of absorbed SMS was shown by significant and lasting suppression of plasma insulin concentrations, resulting in significant hyperglycaemia at 90 and 120 min compared with the control study. The feasibility of oral administration of SMS may extend its use in the treatment of acromegaly and gut endocrine tumours.

This decrease was accompanied by a significant increase in water intake and urine volume and a significant decrease in plasma renin activity (PRA). A low Na+ diet also decreased blood pressure significantly, but, in contrast to the high K+ diet, water intake and urine volume significantly decreased and PRA increased. When both diets were given together, the antihypertensive effects of both were eliminated. Thus while an increase in dietary K+ and a decrease in dietary Na+ are both effective antihypertensive regimens in SHR, the mechanism of action of each appears to be different and may be antagonistic in these animals.\r"

Changes in body weight, other dietary constituents and lifestyle factors were avoided as far as possible. Twenty-four hour diet records showed a substantial increase in dietary fibre when subjects were on the high fibre diet. There was no consistent effect of change in dietary fibre intake on group mean systoloic or diastolic blood pressures. Adjusting blood pressures for changes in other dietary components, plasma lipids, electrolytes, body weight and other lifestyle variables did not alter this result. These findings do not support the hypothesis that the blood pressure lowering effect of a vegetarian diet is solely due to an increase in fibre intake.\r"

The dose-response curves to ANG II were re-studied after a period of stabilization. Although assignation to treatment group was random, differences were found in age and basal blood pressure between the control group and those given PGE1. The pressor data from the PGE1 group were thus split by age for analysis. The administration of ANG II alone was associated with significant (P less than 0.001 at all doses) pressor effects without accompanying bradycardia. Plasma renin concentration (PRC) was suppressed (P less than 0.001). Plasma aldosterone concentration rose (P less than 0.001), the magnitude of the rise being directly associated with the plasma ANG II concentrations achieved (P less than 0.05). The infusion of PGE1 had no significant effect on basal blood pressure, but evoked a sustained tachycardia in both age groups (P less than 0.001).

The present study examines the effect of feeding with fat diets rich (corn oil) and poor (coconut oil) in linoleate at high and low concentrations on responses to endotoxin. Spleen phosphatidylcholine linoleate contents were higher in the corn oil than in the coconut oil group and arachidonate concentrations were highest in the group fed a high concentration of corn oil. Coconut oil completely abolished the responses to endotoxin. The inhibitory effects of coconut oil could largely be due to reduced prostaglandin and leukotriene synthesis.\r"

Plasma renin activity and blood angiotensin I were measured. A close linear relationship was found between the increase in plasma renin activity and the increase in blood angiotensin I. The linear correlation between plasma renin activity and blood angiotensin I remained after converting enzyme inhibition. Thus, the rise in angiotensin I after inhibition of the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II is due to an enhanced release of renin rather than to accumulation of angiotensin I.\r"

  ".W": "Based on our experience, we would like to offer a few pragmatic suggestions for the practicing clinician. These recommendations are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. The first encounter with most patients gives the impression of either a dramatic acute infection, usually in the lungs, central nervous system, or gastrointestinal tract (in this order of frequency), or that of a chronic wasting disease. The former is frequently superimposed on the latter. The exploration of AIDS risk factors and a few easily detectable physical signs are the most important clues to the correct clinical diagnosis. Once AIDS is suspected, an aggressive and rapid approach for diagnosis is justified. Selected individually for each patient, the most commonly successful tests include bronchoscopy with BAL and/or transbronchial lung biopsy; bone marrow, lymph node, or liver biopsy with both microbiologic and pathologic processing of the material; blood (and often spinal fluid) cultures for fungal organisms; cranial computerized tomographic scan; and toxoplasma serology. Other tests, while potentially useful, are less important in immediate decision-making and treatment. In all cases of respiratory compromise or symptoms related to the chest, PCP has to be ruled out by invasive methods if the suspicion of AIDS is sufficiently strong. The diagnosis of one opportunistic infection should not be interpreted as a final answer. Rather, it should stimulate more vigilant efforts to uncover additional infections and other AIDS-related diseases if any abnormalities remain unexplained or persist despite treatment. Chest radiology should not be the main tool to diagnose or monitor lung infections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Pulmonary alveolar-capillary permeability (PACP) was determined with a radioaerosol lung-scan technique in 23 of these 81 patients, representing a statistically similar subgroup. Lung scanning achieved a predictive accuracy of 71% (after excluding patients with unilateral pulmonary contusion) and gave no false-negatives.

This paper studies the relationship between proximal airway pressure (Paw) and the pressure in high-volume, low-pressure, tracheal tube cuffs. Cuff pressure changes during intermittent mandatory ventilation and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) cannot be explained solely by the effect of tracheal pressure, as reflected by Paw, on the annulus of the cuff exposed in the trachea. Cuff pressure showed wide swings and decreased below atmospheric pressure in the presence of small Paw fluctuations during CPAP breathing. Thus, adequate gas flow in the ventilator circuit cannot assure minimal pleural pressure changes. Decreases in cuff pressure may indicate inadequate CPAP and may explain why \"just seal\" pressure in endotracheal cuffs may not always prevent aspiration.\r"

Of 42 CPR attempts performed on 16 dogs, 16 were reversed by only chest compression and artificial ventilation. For the 26 CPR with pharmacologic intervention, recovery was obtained after one injection in 5 of 6 Epi but only in 4 of 11 CaCl2 and 4 of 9 D5W. Only four CPR attempts were ultimately unsuccessful, all in CaCl2 group. During recovery, the Epi group showed significantly higher arterial pressures and heart rates but less severe acidemia.

Altogether 142 patients (68 in the sucralfate and 74 in the cimetidine group) with endoscopically confirmed ulcer within 2 cm of the pylorus completed the study. Endoscopic follow up was performed after four weeks and, if the ulcer was not healed, after eight weeks of treatment. After four weeks, 65% of the ulcers in the sucralfate group were healed, compared to 70% in the cimetidine group. There was no significant difference between sucralfate and cimetidine at either time point. The 95% confidence interval for the difference in ulcer healing with sucralfate or cimetidine ranged from +4 to -19% at eight weeks. Said another way, with an observed difference of 7% (83% vs 90%), the 95% confidence limit ranged from 4% in favor of sucralfate to 19% in favor of cimetidine. Symptomatic relief, antacid intake, and side effects did not differ significantly between the two groups. The healing rate of prepyloric ulcer in this study is similar to that reported for duodenal ulcer after four and eight weeks when treated with sucralfate or cimetidine. Sucralfate is safe and as effective as cimetidine in the short-term treatment of prepyloric ulcer.\r"

A four-week observation period preceded three six-week test periods. Bowel habits, abdominal distress, and affect were reported daily and in biweekly evaluations. Psychological assessments and rectosigmoid contractile studies were done in each period. Stool frequency, diarrhea, abdominal pain, depression, and slow contractions decreased significantly more in diarrhea-predominant patients during desipramine compared with placebo and atropine treatments. Diarrhea-prone patients' depression scores fell more in all periods than constipation-prone patients. Fifteen patients (13 diarrhea-predominant) improved globally during desipramine, five during placebo and six during atropine treatments.

Dobutamine improves cardiac output, decreases pulmonary wedge pressure, and decreases total systemic vascular resistance with little effect on heart rate or systemic arterial pressure. Clinical benefit has been observed to continue for weeks to months following the discontinuation of dobutamine. In addition, tolerance to dobutamine has been observed when infusions last 72 hours or longer. This has led investigators to study the effectiveness of chronic intermittent infusions of dobutamine. Studies utilizing dobutamine doses ranging from 1.5 to 15 micrograms/kg/min for 4-48 h/wk have shown sustained clinical and hemodynamic improvement in patients suffering from congestive heart failure. The mechanism by which dobutamine creates this effect is not entirely known; however, studies suggest dobutamine exerts a physical conditioning effect similar to exercise. Dobutamine infusions have also been associated with morphological and metabolic changes in myocardial tissue consistent with improved myocardial structure and function. The intermittent use of dobutamine may be beneficial in the chronic treatment of congestive heart failure in patients who fail to respond to conventional therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The incidence of immune hemolytic anemia (IHA) is increasing. The proliferation of pharmaceuticals is a contributing factor to this increase. IHA is an uncommon, though significant, adverse effect of a wide variety of drugs. Several recent case reports have implicated the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Because of the extensive use of this class of drugs, a review of case reports, clinical studies, and in vitro research was conducted on NSAID-induced IHA. Mefenamic acid, ibuprofen, sulindac, naproxen, tolmetin, feprazone, and aspirin are reported to cause IHA, with mefenamic acid most frequently implicated. Mefenamic acid appears to cause hemolytic anemia by an autoimmune mechanism similar to methyldopa and aspirin by an immune complex mechanism. However, there is insufficient information concerning ibuprofen, sulindac, naproxen, tolmetin, and feprazone to assign specific mechanisms of immune hemolysis. In individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) deficiency, aspirin at usual therapeutic doses is not a predisposing factor to hemolysis unless other risk factors are present. Although individuals with G-6-PD deficiency are at increased risk of developing hemolytic anemia when exposed to oxidizing stresses, the use of NSAIDs does not appear to increase this risk significantly. Because NSAID-induced IHA occurs infrequently and the sensitivity of currently used tests to detect drug-dependent antibodies is limited, routine serologic testing in patients receiving NSAIDs is not justified. If hemolytic anemia occurs in a NSAID-treated patient and the history is consistent with a drug-induced etiology, the NSAID should be discontinued. With discontinuation of the offending agent, the prognosis is good. There is a rapid hematologic recovery, with a slow resolution of abnormal serologic findings.\r"

  ".W": "Interprofessional contact and consultation among dentists, physicians, and pharmacists can help to optimize patient care. Because pharmacists are readily accessible to the public, their influence is essential for the appropriate prescribing and continued use of systemic fluoride supplements. Pharmacists should be familiar with various aspects of fluoride therapy, such as mechanisms of caries inhibition, dosages associated with acute and chronic toxicity, and recommended daily dosage levels. The impact of breastfeeding, multiple sources of water intake, and changing age of the patient must be considered in determining proper systemic fluoride dosage. Pharmacists should consult with both physicians and dentists to coordinate water fluoride assay and prescribing responsibilities. They also can help to educate both prescribers and patients. Because of frequent patient contact and access to medication records, pharmacists can encourage and monitor patient compliance. Fluoride prescriptions and results of water fluoride assays should be documented on the patients' computerized or card profiles. In addition, pharmacists can counsel patients about the fluoride ion content of various home-use products and make recommendations to ensure that an optimal level of fluoride ingestion is maintained.\r"

We report a case of cibenzoline-induced hypoglycemia in an elderly male with a history of ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Cibenzoline is a class I antiarrhythmic agent currently undergoing clinical investigation in the U.S. The initial hypoglycemic episode occurred after two years of successful treatment with cibenzoline. Blood glucose during the first hypoglycemic episode was 40 mg/dL. The hypoglycemia was associated with central nervous system depression, hyperkalemia, electrocardiographic abnormalities, and respiratory distress. Rechallenge with cibenzoline resulted in recurrence of symptoms and a blood glucose level of 21 mg/dL. A second rechallenge resulted in symptoms suggestive of hypoglycemia, but cibenzoline was discontinued before frank hypoglycemia and hyperkalemia recurred. Hypoglycemia occurred during periods of fasting, which most likely ruled out reactive-type hypoglycemia. Insulinoma was ruled out by the presence of normal fasting blood glucose and plasma insulin levels. It was concluded that this patient's hypoglycemia was secondary to cibenzoline. Hypoglycemia is a rare and sporadic adverse effect associated with antiarrhythmic therapy. However, the severity of these reactions warrants increased awareness of their occurrence in patients presenting with symptoms of hypoglycemia who are receiving disopyramide or cibenzoline.\r"

The design of the experimental phase was comprised of a 10-week baseline, 6-week intervention, and 10-week follow-up. Results of this phase at the end of follow-up showed a significant reduction only for those patients receiving the CR treatment. In the nonexperimental phase, the two control groups also received the CR treatment for a 6-week period, and subsequent seizure frequency measures for all three groups were analyzed after 10-week and 30-week follow-up periods. Results of this phase showed a significant reduction in seizure frequency for all three groups after receiving the CR treatment. Effects of the CR treatment were maintained at a 30-week follow-up. The results indicate that the CR treatment program may be of substantial help to adults whose seizures are resistant to conventional drug therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The response of glycoprotein hormone free alpha-subunit to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) was evaluated in 12 women with polycystic ovaries (PCOs). Six of these women were premedicated for 3 days with micronized 17 beta-estradiol before receiving a 100-micrograms bolus of GnRH. In nonmedicated PCO patients, GnRH did not significantly alter basal free alpha-subunit levels. In four of the six PCO patients receiving estrogen premedication, a significant increase in free alpha-subunit was observed; these four patients had low progesterone levels at the time of the GnRH test. Among the six premedicated patients, two had elevated (greater than 4 ng/ml) progesterone levels, and the GnRH tests showed no significant effect on the levels of free alpha-subunit. The study revealed a dissociation between the free alpha-subunit responses to GnRH and the responses of luteinizing hormone; a closer relationship was observed between free alpha-subunit and follicle-stimulating hormone responses. It was concluded that the lack of a free alpha-subunit response to GnRH in PCO patients is not due to a primary inability of the pituitary gonadotroph to produce free alpha-subunit but is a consequence of an altered estrogenic milieu, and a free alpha-subunit response to GnRH may reflect the replenishment of both follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone in the gonadotrope.\r"

With the use of immunofluorescence we found that in sperm from fertile donors 88.4% of the cells had the antigens localized over the acrosomal cap only and 1.3% had most of the antigens at extraacrosomal sites. Fifteen of the 26 infertile men (P1) studied had a similar relative distribution of antigens, but the remaining 11 patients (P2) had a 38-fold increase in cells with extraacrosomal localization of the antigens (40%, P less than 0.005). Using flow cytometry to quantitate immunofluorescence, content of antigen on sperm from patients from population P1 (680 +/- 60 V X 10(-4)) was not different from that of control (835 +/- 53 V X 10(-4], whereas it was significantly lower in sperm from patients from population P2 (554 +/- 64 V X 10(-4), P less than 0.005). Differences could not be correlated with parameters measured by routine semen analysis.

The morphologic features of the tails was normal. Few loose sperm heads were observed in the ejaculates. Even though motility was decreased, there were numerous acephalic sperms with different degrees of forward motility. Electron microscopy showed a well-organized structure of the centrioles and connecting piece, which were located in the neck region within a small cytoplasmic mass, but no chromatin was detected in any case. Studies on immature spermatids present in semen evidenced an independent anomalous development of heads and tails and suggested that they became separated at the end of spermatid maturation. This anomaly, of probable genetic origin, is interpreted to be due either to an alteration in the mechanism of migration and positioning of the tail on the caudal pole of the nucleus or to an interference with the formation of the implantation fossa of the head, which normally accommodates the connecting piece.\r"

The alpha 2-adrenoceptor-blocking action of mianserin was confirmed by its inhibitory effect on platelet activation in vitro. Mianserin was given orally 90 min before insulin injection; the same study without mianserin was performed on another day as the control study. The time courses of blood glucose and serum C-peptide (0, 20, 45, and 180 min after the insulin injection) were identical in both studies, indicating that mianserin has no effect on these parameters. However, a significant increase of beta-TG at 45 min after insulin injection was completely suppressed by the administration of mianserin (mean +/- SE, 68.5 +/- 6.0 vs. 28.8 +/- 7.6 ng/ml, n = 6, P less than .05). No significant differences were obtained between the two studies in the responses of plasma or serum catecholamines, cortisol, glucagon, growth hormone, thromboxane B2, and 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha. These results suggest that epinephrine is responsible for some, if not all, of the beta-TG release from the platelets during insulin-induced hypoglycemia.\r"

The experiments were performed 6-36 mo after cessation of breast-feeding. The control group comprised 10 healthy women with normal OGTT matched for age and weight. Among subjects with previous histories of GD, 9 had normal, 8 borderline, and 6 decreased OGTT. As a group, women with previous histories of GD have significantly decreased insulin response and insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, all 14 with borderline and decreased OGTT demonstrated a low early insulin response during GIT (5-min value below the upper border of the lower quartile of normals), whereas insulin sensitivity was normal in 6 and low in 8 (glucose values attained during SIGIT were lower or higher, respectively, than the lower border of the upper quartile of controls). The women with previous histories of GD and normal OGTT exhibited normal (n = 4) and low (n = 5) insulin responses. Three of the former subjects had low and the remaining 6 had normal insulin sensitivity. In conclusion, as many as 60% of normal-weight women with previous histories of GD had borderline or decreased OGTT 6-36 mo postpartum. This derangement could be due to impaired early insulin response, which in some subjects was combined with low insulin sensitivity. Follow-up of women with previous histories of GD might enlighten the pathogenesis of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\r"

Both agonists stimulate PPI hydrolysis, inositol phosphate accumulation, 3H efflux from [3H]inositol-prelabeled tissue, and 45Ca efflux from prelabeled cells. However, the effects of CCK-8S on PPI metabolism are considerably greater than those of glucose. Furthermore, the effects of CCK-8S on PPI and Ca2+ metabolism are observed whether islets are incubated in either 2.75 or 7 mM glucose, but CCK-8S only stimulates insulin secretion (a biphasic response) when the higher glucose concentration is present. Addition of 1 microM forskolin to islets incubated in media containing 2.75 mM glucose does not influence basal insulin secretion but sensitizes the islets to the action of CCK-8S. In the presence of forskolin, CCK-8S induces a very marked first phase but no second phase of insulin secretion. We postulate that CCK-8S acts in this tissue via receptor-linked PPI hydrolysis, leading to an inositol trisphosphate-induced Ca2+ efflux. These receptor-mediated effects of CCK-8S are not altered either by the ambient glucose concentration or the cAMP content of the islets, but these two factors determine the responsiveness of the islets (in terms of insulin secretion) to a given CCK-8S signal.\r"

In perifusion, both high glucose and depolarization of the beta-cell with 40 mM K+ trigger a monophasic pattern of insulin release without altering the HIT cell cAMP content. Addition of either the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) or the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin dramatically increased the cellular cAMP content, potentiated the burst phase of insulin release, and coupled the immediate phase of insulin secretion to a sustained secretory response. However, increases in cellular cAMP content were not associated with a change in [Ca2+]i. Thus, the potentiation of insulin secretion by a rise in cAMP in the HIT cell is not mediated by a release of stored Ca2+. Either a glucose-generated signal or a rise in [Ca2+]i triggered by high K+ can synergize with a rise in cAMP to couple the burst or immediate release of insulin evoked by either secretagogue to the sustained release of insulin.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effects of different hypocaloric diets on insulin secretion, 24-h urine C-peptide was measured in 11 obese subjects on a weight-maintaining baseline diet, and the results were compared with values obtained during 14-day periods of diets containing 400 kcal/day of only protein (n = 6) or glucose (n = 5), followed by 14 days of fasting and 14 days of refeeding on 800-1000 kcal/day. A significant positive correlation between total caloric intake and urine C-peptide excretion was found once the C-peptide excretion reached steady state after several days on each diet. Multiple regression analysis showed no contribution of body weight to urine C-peptide during the different diets. In contrast, a significant correlation was found between body weight and urine C-peptide in the fasting state. A marked and identical decrease of approximately 75% in urine C-peptide occurred over the first 5-7 days of the two 400-kcal diets, followed by a further decrease during fasting to 5% of baseline values. Refeeding was associated with a progressive increase. Plasma insulin and C-peptide followed the same trends as found for urine C-peptide, although the magnitude of change was much smaller. C-peptide clearance was not assessed because of the variation in plasma levels on eating meals. However, the same responses were found when C-peptide excretion was factored for creatinine excretion. Thus, the major determinant of urine C-peptide excretion appears to be food intake, and adaptations take 5-7 days to reach steady state.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We have previously demonstrated impaired glucose influence on insulin secretion in normal rats made overtly hyperglycemic with glucose infusions for 48 h. We examined the effects of a 96-h infusion period. Rats received 30, 35, or 50% glucose or 0.45% NaCl at 2 ml/h. The plasma glucose in the 30 and 35% rats peaked at 24 h but then returned to normal by 72 h. A peak followed by a gradual fall also occurred in the 50% rats, but significant hyperglycemia was maintained throughout. beta-Cell responsiveness to glucose was assessed with the perfused pancreas by examining the effect of altering the perfusate glucose concentration on insulin release. Insulin secretion remained intact in the 30% rats, but the response to a glucose increase was blunted in the 35% group and totally absent in the 50% rats. In a second protocol, glucose influence on arginine-stimulated insulin release was tested by adding 10 mM arginine to the perfusate and administering it with 2.8 and 16.7 mM glucose. The ability of the different glucose backgrounds to influence the insulin response decreased as the level of infused glucose rose. On the other hand, when phloridzin was added to 50% glucose during the second 48 h of infusion, glucose modulation of insulin release was completely restored. These data indicate that during a period of overt hyperglycemia, beta-cell defects can fully evolve within 48 h in the rat. Thereafter, they are maintained by the glucose infusion even though the plasma glucose level returns to near normal. Continued minor stimulation of the beta-cell may be the responsible factor.\r"

Pancreatic explants were cultured in medium containing 11.1 or 22.2 mM glucose and 20% fetal calf serum for 8-10 days. During this period they were exposed, on two separate occasions, to serum-free culture medium for 24 h. SM-C/IGF-I and insulin were measured radioimmunologically in the serum-free media and in acid-ethanol-extracted homogenates of the cultured explants. SM-C/IGF-I was measurable in the conditioned media only after extraction by reverse-phase chromatography to remove somatomedin-binding proteins. On gel filtration at neutral pH of extracted medium samples, the immunoreactive SM-C/IGF-I was recovered in the region of the homogeneous peptide with an apparent molecular weight of 7000-8000. Explants cultured in 22.2 mM glucose contained more SM-C/IGF-I and had a tendency to release more of the peptide into the culture medium than explants cultured in 11.1 mM. There was no difference in insulin content or release between the two groups. By immunocytochemistry, SM-C/IGF-I was localized to the beta-cells of the endocrine pancreas in both freshly fixed tissue and cultured explants. We conclude that the human fetal pancreas contains SM-C/IGF-I and secretes the peptide during tissue culture. The presence of SM-C/IGF-I in the islets of Langerhans may contribute to the growth and development of the insulin-producing beta-cell.\r"

HIT cells secreted insulin in response to fuel molecules, but 3-O-methylglucose was ineffective. Stimulation of insulin release by fuels was increased by isobutylmethylxanthine and blocked by antimycin A. Iodoacetate selectively inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin release but had little effect on alpha-ketoisocaproic acid-stimulated insulin secretion. These results indicate that HIT cells retain the capacity of normal beta-cells to act as fuel sensors. Thus, HIT cells may provide a well-defined and relatively abundant tissue source in studies of stimulus-secretion coupling in beta-cells stimulated by fuels.\r"

Immunochemically purified (reaction with antibodies followed by separation of antigen-antibody complexes on protein A-Sepharose) radiolabeled lectin-reactive proteins were analyzed by gel filtration in guanidine-acetic acid and by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after disulfide bond-cleavage treatments.

In addition, the effects of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) on the time course of ICA and beta-cell function were evaluated. In 10 subjects (8 with NIDDM and 2 with IGT) who were ICA positive, ICA became undetectable, even by sensitive ICA assay, 15 +/- 2 mo (mean +/- SE) after initiation of this study. In these subjects, integrated serum CPR values (sigma CPR) and 2-h blood glucose values in response to OGTTs improved significantly (P less than .05-.01). In contrast, the remaining 22 subjects who were ICA positive were persistently positive for ICA. CPR and blood glucose responses deteriorated progressively in these 22 subjects, and 7 subjects in this group progressed to the insulin-dependent state. Serum CPR and blood glucose responses to OGTTs showed no remarkable changes in 64 patients (56 with NIDDM and 8 with IGT) and 32 normal first-degree relatives of patients with IDDM who remained negative for ICA throughout the study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We recently demonstrated that chymotrypsin substrate analogues inhibit receptor-mediated insulin internalization in isolated rat adipocytes. In this study, the effect on glucose transport of inhibiting insulin internalization with these agents was examined. Glucose transport was assayed by measuring [3H]-2-deoxyglucose uptake, and internalized insulin was measured after rapidly dissociating surface-bound insulin with an acidic buffer. The chymotrypsin substrate analogue N-acetyl-Tyr ethyl ester inhibited insulin internalization by 85% while increasing surface-bound insulin by 80-110%. Under these conditions, ATP levels were minimally altered, and basal glucose transport was unchanged; however, insulin-stimulated glucose transport was decreased by 86%. The inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport was not overcome by supramaximal concentrations (400 ng/ml) of insulin. When insulin internalization and insulin-stimulated glucose transport were measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of N-acetyl-Tyr ethyl ester (0.1-1 mM), a strong and highly significant correlation (r = .97, P less than .001) was found between inhibition of insulin internalization and inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Fragments of N-acetyl-Tyr ethyl ester that do not inhibit insulin internalization were also without effect on insulin-stimulated glucose transport. In addition to N-acetyl-Tyr ethyl ester, four other chymotrypsin substrate analogues that are effective inhibitors of insulin internalization also markedly inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose transport. These results indicate that insulin internalization and insulin-stimulated glucose transport share a common postbinding step in adipocytes and that this step is inhibitable by chymotrypsin substrate analogues.\r"

Chief cells contained homogeneous, finely granular secretory granules that were uniformly PG II-positive. In contrast, mucous neck, pyloric gland, and Brunner's gland cells contained secretory granules consisting of an eccentrically placed dense core surrounded by a clear matrix; PG II immunoreactivity was concentrated over the dense core of these biphasic granules. Pyloric gland cells also contained monophasic secretory granules having the same electron density, texture, and PG II immunoreactivity as the nucleoids of biphasic granules and clear vesicular granules that were PG II-negative. Vesicular granules also were found in Brunner's gland cells. The Golgi region of pyloric gland cells contained small PG II-positive monophasic granules adjacent to small PG II-negative vesicular granules. This observation suggests that biphasic granules may form in the Golgi region of pyloric gland cells by fusion of PG II-containing monophasic granules and PG II-unreactive vesicular granules.\r"

We undertook this trial to determine if a cytoprotective dose of arbaprostil (10 micrograms q.i.d. for 4 wk) would also be efficacious in this disease state. Eighty-two patients between the ages of 19 and 72 yr with endoscopically documented duodenal ulcers were entered into this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. The patients were monitored with biweekly endoscopies and laboratory examinations, weekly interviews during the period when drug was administered, and a follow-up interview plus laboratory examinations 1 wk after drug administration was completed. No statistically significant differences between the arbaprostil and placebo treatment groups were found for ulcer healing rates, pain relief, antacid consumption, side effects, or laboratory examinations. It is presumed that this prostaglandin may not have sufficient duodenal cytoprotective capacity to effectively heal duodenal ulcers, or that some suppression of gastric acid secretion may be required to achieve significant clinical efficacy.\r"

The present study tested these questions in cultured gastric mucous epithelial cells. The effect of 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 on cellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate level and the effect of 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2, dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate, and isobutyl methyl xanthine on taurocholate-induced damage to cultured rat gastric mucosal cells was determined. As parameters of cell damage, the trypan blue dye exclusion test and 51Cr-release were employed. Taurocholate significantly increased 51Cr-release in a dose-dependent manner and decreased the number of viable cells. 16,16-Dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (1.0 microM) diminished the cell damage caused by 10 mM taurocholate (p less than 0.01) and increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels. Prostaglandin F2 alpha but not prostaglandin I2 was also cytoprotective. Addition of dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (1.0 mM) and isobutyl methyl xanthine while significantly increasing cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels did not significantly reduce taurocholate-induced cell damage. Thus, in vitro 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 directly protects gastric mucous cells against taurocholate-induced injury, direct prostaglandin cytoprotection is not limited to damaging agents that inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels do not correlate with gastric mucosal cell damage and may not be involved in the direct protective effect of prostaglandins.\r"

  ".W": "Emptying of the terminal ileum was assessed in 15 healthy humans by injecting technetium 99m-diethyltriaminopentaacetic acid into the bowel through a multilumen orocolonic tube. The subsequent arrival of isotope in the colon was quantified by gamma-scintigraphy and colonic filling curves were obtained. Studies were performed during fasting (n = 5) cnd 2.5 h after either a low residue meal (n = 5) or a meal made high in residue (n = 5) by adding 4 g of guar. The time for 50% of the isotope to reach the colon (T50) was significantly accelerated after both meals, being 72 +/- 15 min for the high residue meal and 62 +/- 8 min for the low residue meal, compared with 183 +/- 37 min (p less than 0.01) in the 5 fasting subjects. Although the addition of guar did not alter T50 significantly, it did cause a significant fall in the rate of colonic filling, implying increased isotope dilution. Delay at the ileocolonic junction, as shown by plateaus in the middle of the colonic filling curves, was uncommon. Hold-up was significant in only 2 of 10 postprandial and 2 of 5 fasting studies. Rates of ileocolonic transit could not be related to either a mean ileal motility index or the occurrence of specific ileal motor patterns immediately proximal to the ileocolonic junction. Fasting ileocolonic transit was characteristically erratic but could not be related to interdigestive migrating motor complexes, which were rarely observed in the last 60 cm of ileum. We conclude that ileocolonic transit in humans is related to the rate at which material accumulates in the ileum, being rapid postprandially (when ileal flow is high) and slow and erratic during fasting. This method yields consistent results and could be used to define further factors that influence ileocolonic inflow.\r"

  ".W": "An increased prevalence of hypertension in groups with high alcohol consumption has been recognized for a number of years. More recently, several studies have suggested an independent association between alcohol consumption and blood pressure levels in samples from general populations. Of 30 cross-sectional population studies reviewed, the majority reported small but significant elevations in blood pressure in those consuming three drinks or more per day in comparison with nondrinkers. In 25% of studies, elevations in blood pressure were also reported at lower levels of consumption; in about 40%, the blood pressure of nondrinkers was greater than that of those consuming one to two drinks per day. In two studies, one from the United States and one from Australia, the maximum contribution to the prevalence of hypertension of alcohol consumption greater than two drinks per day was estimated to be 5 to 7%; the contribution in men (11%) was greater than that in women because of their greater alcohol consumption. A prospective association of alcohol consumption with change in blood pressure was observed in five studies. In a small number of experimental studies, short-term falls in blood pressure accompanied alcohol restriction in both normotensive and hypertensive subjects. Uncontrolled observations in heavy drinking populations suggest that the effect on blood pressure of alcohol withdrawal may be lasting. However, firm conclusions about the long-term effects of alcohol restriction, particularly in moderate consumers who represent a large proportion in many populations, must await long-term controlled trials.\r"

Dose-response curves to 0.003 to 0.1 mg/kg/min i.v. infusions of the ACHPA-containing renin inhibitory peptide or enalaprilat (0.003-0.1 mg/kg i.v. bolus) were obtained in one-kidney dogs before and 3 days and 14 days after renal artery constriction. The ACHPA-containing renin inhibitory peptide and enalaprilat maximally decreased blood pressure by 10 +/- 2 and 9 +/- 2 mm Hg before constriction and by 12 +/- 2 and 12 +/- 4 mm Hg in dogs treated 14 days after renal artery constriction, respectively. Glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow were unaltered or slightly improved. In sharp contrast, both compounds elicited significant, dose-related decreases in blood pressure (-26 +/- 4 and -20 +/- 4 mm Hg, respectively), glomerular filtration rate (-21 +/- 3 and -23 +/- 3 ml/min), and renal plasma flow (-45 +/- 14 and -48 +/- 13 ml/min) in dogs examined 3 days after renal artery constriction. These data demonstrate that ACHPA-containing renin inhibitory peptide and enalaprilat are equally effective antihypertensive agents in dogs with renin-dependent renovascular hypertension and lend credence to the contention that the renin-angiotensin system supports renal function in hypertensive states in which renin levels are elevated.\r"

  ".U": "87136058\r", 
  ".W": "The hypothesis that a primary stimulus for aortic medial hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) is increased blood pressure was tested by determining whether development of smooth muscle cell hypertrophy and hyperploidy in SHR could be dissociated from blood pressure levels in rats treated with various antihypertensive drugs with different mechanisms of action. Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and SHR were treated between 2 and 5 months of age with captopril (375 mg/L), hydralazine (40 mg/L), or propranolol (1.5 mg/L) administered in their drinking water. Smooth muscle hypertrophy and hyperploidy were analyzed by morphometric evaluation of medial smooth muscle content, flow cytometric analysis of the frequency of polyploid smooth muscle cells, and biochemical estimates of smooth muscle cell number. All drugs significantly lowered blood pressure in SHR compared with untreated controls (order of efficacy: captopril greater than hydralazine greater than propranolol). Captopril also was most effective at changing blood pressure in WKY, while propranolol and hydralazine had similar blood pressure-lowering effects. The efficacy of drugs in preventing the development of smooth muscle cell polyploidism and medial hypertrophy in SHR was the same as their efficacy in lowering blood pressure, although propranolol had no effect on medial smooth muscle hypertrophy despite lowering blood pressure by 26 mm Hg. Regression analyses showed a high degree of correlation between blood pressure and the frequency of polyploid smooth muscle cells and medial smooth muscle content. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that aortic medial hypertrophy may be, in part, a response to increased blood pressure or wall stress. However, analysis of covariance and two-stage multiple regression analyses indicated that captopril had an effect over and above that predicted by its blood pressure-lowering effect. Furthermore, propranolol lowered blood pressure but did not affect medial hypertrophy. These results suggest that smooth muscle hypertrophy is not simply a response to increased blood pressure, but that other factors, such as angiotensin II, may be important in modulating aortic medial hypertrophy in SHR.\r"

  ".W": "Both nonselective beta-blockers and beta 1-selective blockers are effective antihypertensive agents. beta 1-Blockade generally is considered to be responsible for their antihypertensive action, whereas beta 2-blockade is regarded as undesirable. These common assumptions notwithstanding, the mechanism by which beta-blockers lower blood pressure remains unknown. To examine the possibility that beta 2-blockade may contribute to the antihypertensive action of beta-blocker therapy, we studied the cardiovascular effects of compound ICI 118551, a beta 2-selective blocker. First, we showed that 50 mg t.i.d. orally is a beta 2-selective dose. In contrast to propranolol, 80 mg t.i.d., or atenolol, 100 mg once a day, 50 mg of ICI 118551 t.i.d. failed to block beta 1-mediated inotropic stimulation and stimulation of renin by isoproterenol. We then performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with mild essential hypertension to compare this compound with propranolol, 80 mg t.i.d., and showed that ICI 118551 significantly decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure. This antihypertensive effect was demonstrated by direct as well as by indirect blood pressure measurements. Thus, contrary to prevailing thought, beta 2-blockade has an antihypertensive effect independent of, and distinct from, beta 1-blockade.\r"

Changes in blood pressure, hemodynamics, and humoral factors of the exercised group were compared with values in the controls. The following significant changes were found only in the exercised group. Blood pressure was significantly (p less than 0.01) reduced. Whole blood and plasma volume indices were significantly reduced (p less than 0.05, p less than 0.01, respectively). The change in ratio of serum sodium to potassium positively correlated with the change in systolic blood pressure (r = 0.76, p less than 0.02). Plasma norepinephrine concentrations both at rest and at the workload of blood lactate threshold during graded exercise tests were significantly reduced (p less than 0.05, p less than 0.02 respectively) after 10 weeks of exercise training. The change in the resting level of plasma norepinephrine positively correlated with that in the mean blood pressure. No such changes were observed in the control group. In both groups, body weight and urinary sodium excretion showed no statistically significant changes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Adrenal responses to angiotensin II (ANG II) are enhanced with restriction of sodium intake. To determine whether increased circulating ANG II levels are responsible for the enhanced responsiveness, the adrenal and blood pressure responses to ANG II in human subjects were assessed four times: in balance on a high and a low salt diet and before and after the administration of a converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril). Before enalapril administration, sodium restriction significantly increased (p less than 0.02) plasma renin activity, ANG II, and aldosterone levels; the aldosterone response to ANG II was enhanced twofold (p less than 0.01); and the blood pressure response to ANG II infusion was reduced significantly (p less than 0.05). Despite a fixed and low plasma ANG II concentration when enalapril was employed, the adrenal response to ANG II on the low salt diet was enhanced to the same degree as that observed before administration of the converting enzyme inhibitor. Conversely, enalapril substantially altered the blood pressure response to ANG II with sodium restriction, completely preventing the reduction in responsiveness. If the subjects were first given enalapril and then sodium intake was restricted, ANG II levels did not change significantly but renal excretion of both sodium and potassium was substantially modified. The rate at which renal excretion of sodium fell to match intake was retarded strikingly (p less than 0.001); conversely, renal retention of potassium increased significantly (p less than 0.03) as low salt balance was attained. Possibly because of the potassium retention, aldosterone levels rose, but significantly less than when enalapril was absent.\r"

In contrast, in the lower extremity, the results were highly dependent on the age of the patients at the time of the initial presentation of symptoms. In patients who were eighteen years old or older, eight (88 per cent) of the nine times that a lesion involving the lower extremity had closed treatment and both times that a lesion was treated with curettage and bone-grafting, the result was satisfactory. The results of these modalities of treatment in patients who were less than eighteen years old were discouraging. Twenty-eight (88 per cent) of the thirty-two times that closed treatment was used and twenty-five (81 per cent) of the thirty-one times that curettage and bone-grafting was used, the result was unsatisfactory. However, after eighteen (86 per cent) of the twenty-one times that a lesion in the lower extremity was treated by internal fixation in a patient who was less than eighteen years old, there was a satisfactory outcome. We concluded that closed treatment of a symptomatic lesion in the upper extremity generally provides satisfactory results. In patients who are less than eighteen years old, neither closed treatment nor curettage and bone-grafting is adequate treatment for a symptomatic lesion in the lower extremity. Internal fixation should be strongly considered in these young patients.\r"

We have reviewed 61 hips in 51 patients at an average of 4 years 3 months after operation. Grading for severity is discussed and the degree of physiological remodelling of the medial wall of the acetabulum after grafting assessed. There was an average of about 4 mm of remodelling, but this varied considerably; most took place within the first year. In no case was there relapse of the protrusio.\r"

Variable proinsulin and insulin infusions were administered iv for at least 18 h on separate occasions to achieve euglycemia. Once equivalence with respect to this end point was established, the paired infusions were made constant and compared with respect to their effect on plasma glucose, hepatic glucose output (Ra), glucose utilization, glucose clearance, and blood beta-hydroxybutyrate, alanine, and glycerol in response to a glucagon infusion (3 ng/kg X min). Basal Ra did not differ between euglycemia established using proinsulin vs. insulin [1.92 +/- 0.12 vs. 1.65 +/- 0.07 mg/kg X min] when data were analyzed by multivariate analysis of variance; likewise, the increment in Ra in response to glucagon infusion did not differ between the two treatments (1.26 +/- 0.22 vs. 1.17 +/- 0.24 mg/kg X min). Blood beta OHB, alanine, and glycerol also did not differ between the insulin and proinsulin treatments. Under these conditions of prolonged infusion in which the differences in clearance properties between proinsulin and insulin do not play a role and which maintain basal euglycemia, the two compounds equally limit the response to a stimulus to hepatic glucose production. Under nonsteady state conditions, when the differences in clearance rates are operative, proinsulin may have relatively greater effects on Ra than do doses of insulin that are biologically equivalent after prolonged infusions.\r"

  ".W": "Genetic forms of severe insulin resistance are often characterized by alterations in binding and/or kinase properties of the insulin receptor. To evaluate whether alterations in insulin receptor kinase of erythrocytes can be used as genetic markers, we studied patients with two apparently inherited conditions of severe insulin resistance (leprechaunism and the type A syndrome of insulin resistance) and their families. In the two propositi, [125I]insulin binding to intact erythrocytes was decreased by 64% and 45%, respectively. This was primarily due to a decrease in receptor number and was found in intact cells and solubilization of the receptors. Similar insulin binding defects were found on monocytes. Insulin-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity of the solubilized receptor from erythrocytes was also decreased and to a similar extent as binding. Parents of neither patient had clinical manifestations of leprechaunism or the type A syndrome. Furthermore, no alterations in insulin receptor binding or kinase activity were found in erythrocytes from the mothers. Insulin binding in the father of the type A patient was also normal, whereas the father of the leprechaun had decreased receptor affinity. Receptors extracted from the both fathers' cells had a 40-60% decrease in maximal insulin-stimulated phosphorylation and significant rightward shifts of the insulin dose-response curves (ED50, 141 and 42 ng/mL, respectively; control ED50, 16 ng/mL). The finding of biochemical defects in insulin receptor kinase activity in clinically unaffected parents of patients suggests that these alterations may be useful genetic markers and more sensitive than insulin binding studies for studying pattern of inheritance of these diseases.\r"

  ".W": "Dihydrotestosterone heptanoate (DHT-hp), a seven-carbon fatty acid ester of DHT, was synthesized, and its pharmacokinetics and effects on hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular function were determined in men and pubertal boys. Plasma DHT levels markedly increased 24 h after im injection of DHT-hp, reached their peak during the first week, and fell to baseline levels after 4-6 weeks. An estimated 43-55% of DHT-hp was converted to DHT 4-6 weeks after injection. Plasma testosterone, estradiol, LH, and FSH levels decreased by 4 days after DHT-hp injection, were lowest during the second week, and returned to baseline values after 4-6 weeks. The LH and FSH responses to GnRH were diminished by chronic administration of DHT-hp to pubertal boys at 3-week intervals for 15 weeks. The affinity of DHT-hp was 100 times less than the affinity of DHT for the human androgen receptor, and no affinity for the estrogen receptor in breast tissue could be demonstrated. Since DHT is a nonaromatizable androgen, and neither DHT nor DHT-hp binds readily to the estrogen receptor, suppression of LH and FSH secretion by this drug probably occurs via an androgen-dependent mechanism. Receptor binding and pharmacokinetic data indicate that unesterified DHT is the active principle. DHT-hp is a useful derivative of DHT, since prompt, predictable, and sustained rises in DHT occur after its administration.\r"

  ".W": "A syndrome of elevated PRA accompanied by inappropriately low plasma aldosterone (ALDO) levels has been identified in some critically ill patients. To determine whether this phenomenon is due to a disturbance in factors that stimulate ALDO, we measured PRA, angiotensin II (AII), potassium (K+), and ACTH levels in 83 patients admitted to an intensive care unit. In 59 patients, PRA was greater than 2.0 ng/ml X h. Of these, 24 had an ALDO to PRA ratio (ALDO/PRA) below 2 (group I), and 35 had an ALDO/PRA ratio of 2 or more (group II). An ALDO/PRA ratio below 2 was deemed inappropriately low. Despite markedly elevated PRA [34 +/- 12 (+/- SE) ng/ml X h], the group I patients had inappropriately low ALDO levels (19 +/- 5 ng/dL). Patients in group II had significantly higher ALDO levels (48 +/- 6 ng/dL) despite lower PRA (9 +/- 1 ng/ml X h). AII levels were appropriately elevated in group I (39 +/- 26 pg/mL) and significantly greater (P less than 0.5) than those in group II. PRA correlated well with AII in both groups. There were no differences in plasma ACTH or K+ in these 2 groups, and plasma cortisol levels were similarly elevated in both groups of patients. Of 66 consecutively studied patients, 14 (21%) had inappropriate ALDO (group I). Mortality was significantly greater in group I (75%) than in group II (46%; P less than 0.001). In summary, a significant subset (21%) of seriously ill patients have inappropriately low ALDO levels despite elevated PRA. This dissociation is not due to an impairment of AII production or changes in plasma ACTH or K+. This phenomenon is associated with a higher mortality during critical illness. In light of evidence of decreased adrenal androgen secretion during severe illness, this dissociation of renin and aldosterone may represent an additional adrenal adaptation designed to promote cortisol production in critically ill patients.\r"

We sought to characterize the effect of sex steroids on the plasma GH concentration by examining the 24-h pattern of episodic GH secretion in nine previously untreated adult men with isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism before and during long term testosterone, gonadotropin, or pulsatile GnRH treatment. After chronic sex steroid exposure, the mean 24-h plasma GH level, mean GH pulse amplitude, and mean area under the curve of pulses were significantly increased compared to pretreatment values [3.2 +/- 1.8 ( +/- SD) vs. 1.8 +/- 1.2 ng/mL (P less than 0.01); 11.4 +/- 7.2 vs. 5.5 +/- 4.4 ng/mL (P less than 0.05); and 720 +/- 547 vs. 316 +/- 371 ng/mL X 20 min (P less than 0.05), respectively], while mean 24-h pre- and posttreatment GH pulse frequencies were indistinguishable (5.7 +/- 2.1 posttreatment vs. 5.0 +/- 3.2 pretreatment; P = NS). The mean posttreatment plasma somatomedin-C level also rose significantly during treatment (1.89 +/- 0.65 vs. 1.28 +/- 0.48 U/mL; P less than 0.01). We conclude that the increase in the mean plasma GH level during chronic sex steroid exposure is due mainly to augmentation of GH pulse amplitude, and that sex steroids probably increase spontaneous GH secretion.\r"

  ".U": "87138173\r", 
  ".W": "In massively obese patients hyperinsulinemia and insulin insensitivity usually improve with weight loss. To clarify the mechanism of these reversible abnormalities eight nondiabetic massively obese patients were studied before and at intervals (3 months and 1 yr) after weight loss following gastroplasty. Insulin dynamics were studied during the hyperglycemic clamp (change in glucose, 7 mmol L-1 for 2 h) by measuring the area under the insulin and C-peptide response curves, representing, respectively, systemic insulin response and insulin production. Compared to lean age-matched normal subjects the massively obese patients had the expected fasting hyperinsulinemia and an exaggerated insulin response (P less than 0.05). Within 3 months and after an approximately 20% weight loss, they had a marked reduction in the systemic insulin response but no change in the C-peptide response. Therefore, the reduction in insulin response was due to enhanced hepatic insulin clearance rather than reduced insulin production. Thus, the liver serves a gate-keeping role in regulating the systemic insulin response to a glucose challenge. With additional weight loss of 14% and then weight maintenance, insulin clearance was further increased, and a reduction in insulin production became evident, since the C-peptide response was reduced. Exogenous insulin clearance was measured using the euglycemic clamp technique before and after weight loss. Insulin clearance was initially lower in the massively obese patients compared to that in the normal subjects (P less than 0.05) and increased toward normal with weight loss (P less than 0.05). Similarly, insulin sensitivity, as measured by the ratio of glucose metabolised per U endogenous insulin, normalized with weight loss and weight maintenance. Thus, after significant weight loss followed by weight maintenance at a reduced, but not ideal, level, insulin clearance, production, and sensitivity all reverted to normal. These findings suggest that adipose mass per se may not be exclusively responsible for altered insulin and glucose dynamics in obesity and that additional factors associated with obesity, such as nutrient load, adipose distribution, fat cell size, or fatty acid flux, play a contributing role.\r"

The increased gonadotropin levels could not be related to changes in body weight or plasma estradiol or serum sex hormone-binding globulin levels, and they approached normal levels during or after treatment of hyperthyroidism. When normal women were treated with T4 (0.5 mg daily for 6-10 days), their mean serum free T4 level increased to about 60% of that in the hyperthyroid patients, while their serum T3 levels increased to a lesser degree. During T4 administration these women had gonadotropin changes similar to those of the hyperthyroid patients. When the normal women took T3 (60-120 micrograms for 6-8 days), their serum T3 level rose almost to the level in the hyperthyroid patients, but basal and GnRH-stimulated LH and FSH remained close to control levels. Dopaminergic blockade with metoclopramide did not alter the gonadotropin response to GnRH in any subject group. We conclude that serum T4 is of greater importance than serum T3 for at least short term gonadotropin regulation.\r"

The results were correlated with hCG, 17 beta-estradiol (E2), progesterone (PG), human placental lactogen (hPL), and insulin levels by time series analysis. Insulin concentrations were constant until week 25 and increased thereafter. Plasma E2, PG, and hPL as well as plasma lipid levels rose continuously during gestation. Apolipoproteins AI, AII, and B concentrations increased until weeks 25, 28, and 32, respectively, and remained constant until term. Low density lipoprotein cholesterol reached maximum levels at week 36. High density lipoprotein cholesterol exhibited a triphasic behavior, with maximum levels at week 25, a fall until week 32, and maintenance of the level until term. Time series analysis revealed positive correlations with E2, PG, and hPL. These results provide evidence that apoprotein concentrations undergo pronounced serial changes during gestation, which in part might be due to the effect of E2. Furthermore, the importance of hPL as a determinant of the plasma levels of total and free cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids is now documented.\r"

In women the median level increased to 1.1 IU/L after the menopause (range, 0.17-4.8 IU/L), and a similar but smaller increase occurred in men after 60 yr of age (median, 0.20 IU/L; range, less than 0.03-2.3). Stimulation with GnRH caused a 2- to 3-fold increase in the hCG level in both men and women. Chronic treatment of postmenopausal women with a combination of estrogen and progestagen lowered their serum hCG levels to about 50% of the pretreatment values. The hCG in serum could be separated from LH by gel chromatography, and the hCG immunoreactivity measured by direct assay of serum corresponded to the immunoreactivity eluted in the hCG fractions after gel chromatography. Thus, the results were not due to cross-reaction with LH. We conclude that serum of nonpregnant women and men contains hCG-like material, whose production is modulated by GnRH and sex steroids.\r"

Explants of trophoblastic tissues obtained from normal early and term placentas were cultured in the presence or absence of EGF (100 ng/mL) with or without processing inhibitors (bacitracin, 1 mg/mL; colchicine, 100 microM; chloroquine, 100 microM) for 5 days, with EGF present for the first 2 days. Addition of EGF to the medium increased the release of hCG, hCG alpha, and hPL by the cultured early placental tissues. This EGF-stimulated hCG, hCG alpha, and hPL release was markedly inhibited by concomitant treatment with processing inhibitors. The time course of EGF effects indicated that the EGF-stimulated increase in hCG alpha secretion required a lag period of approximately 1 day, whereas significant increases in hCG and hPL secretion became apparent only after 3 days of EGF treatment. By contrast, in term placental tissues EGF stimulated only hCG alpha and hPL release, with a lag period of approximately 3 days. A possible direct action of EGF on the cultured placental tissues was reinforced by the immunohistochemical demonstration of EGF receptors in the placenta. When determined using the avidin/biotin immunoperoxidase method with monoclonal antibody to the mouse EGF receptor, EGF receptors were found predominantly on the syncytiotrophoblasts. Immunohistochemical measurements of cellular EGF receptor levels in the syncytiotrophoblasts revealed remarkably higher levels in early placenta compared to those in midterm and term placentas. Since EGF is likely to interact with its receptor, the lesser biological effects of EGF in cultures of term placental tissues may be due to the lower cellular EGF receptor levels in term placenta. These results demonstrate that EGF, via its receptors on the syncytiotrophoblasts, stimulates the release of both hCG and hPL in normal early placenta. They also suggest that EGF may play a significant role in the induction and regulation of the differentiated function of trophoblasts.\r"

Estimates of the plasma insulin response were made by determining the plasma insulin concentration at hourly intervals from 0800-1600 h, before and after mixed meals consumed at 0800 h (breakfast) and 1200 h (lunch). Insulin action was assessed by measuring glucose uptake during insulin clamp studies performed at steady state plasma insulin levels of approximately 10 and 60 microU/mL, with the difference between the 2 values defined as insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Plasma glucose (P less than 0.001) and insulin (P less than 0.001) concentrations were significantly higher in patients with NIDDM throughout the 8-h period (by two-way analysis of variance). However, mean (+/- SEM) insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was markedly reduced (P less than 0.001) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (112 +/- 72 vs. 336 +/- 44 mg/m2 min-1). Thus, patients with NIDDM and mild fasting hyperglycemia were both insulin resistant and hyperinsulinemic compared to normal individuals. These data indicate that a defect in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake can occur in NIDDM in the absence of significant hyperglycemia and/or hypoinsulinemia.\r"

  ".W": "Scintigraphic scanning with [123I]insulin provides a direct and quantitative assessment of insulin uptake and disappearance at specific organ sites. Using this technique, the biodistribution and metabolism of insulin were studied in type 1 diabetic patients and normal subjects. The major organ of [123I]insulin uptake in both diabetic and normal subjects was the liver. After iv injection in normal subjects, the uptake of [123I]insulin by the liver was rapid, with peak activity at 7 min. Activity declined rapidly thereafter, consistent with rapid insulin degradation and clearance. Rapid uptake of [123I]insulin also occurred in the kidneys, although the uptake of insulin by the kidneys was about 80% of that by liver. In type 1 diabetic patients, uptake of [123I]insulin in these organ sites was lower than that in normal subjects; peak insulin uptakes in liver and kidneys were 21% and 40% lower than those in normal subjects, respectively. The kinetics of insulin clearance from the liver was comparable in diabetic and normal subjects, whereas clearance from the kidneys was decreased in diabetics. The plasma clearance of [123I]insulin was decreased in diabetic patients, as was insulin degradation, assessed by trichloroacetic acid precipitability. Thirty minutes after injection, 70.9 +/- 3.8% (+/- SEM) of [123I]insulin in the plasma of diabetics was trichloroacetic acid precipitable vs. only 53.9 +/- 4.0% in normal subjects. A positive correlation was present between the organ uptake of [123I]insulin in the liver or kidneys and insulin degradation (r = 0.74; P less than 0.001). Both decreased insulin uptake in the liver and kidneys and decreased insulin degradation were inversely correlated to the binding capacity of antiinsulin antibodies in plasma of diabetics (r = -0.87 to -0.92; P less than 0.001). In summary, type 1 diabetic patients have altered patterns of insulin biodistribution and metabolism, with decreased organ uptake and slow degradation of [123I]insulin, which correlated with the insulin antibody-binding capacity of their serum. Thus, antiinsulin antibodies, even at subclinical concentrations, may modulate the metabolic effects of insulin in the diabetic by prolonging the biological half-life of the hormone as well as by altering its distribution and uptake at specific organ sites.\r"

Analysis of genomic DNA revealed no evidence for amplification or major structural changes in the ADA gene. ADA-specific messenger RNA (mRNA) from proband reticulocytes was comparable in size and amount to mRNA from control reticulocytes. Translation of proband poly A+ reticulocyte mRNA in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system and immunoprecipitation of 35S-labeled protein products with anti-ADA antibody yielded a band of approximately 42,000 apparent mol wt that was absent in translation products from control reticulocyte mRNAs. These data suggest that the increased ADA activity in red cells in this disorder results from the increased translation of an aberrant ADA mRNA.\r"

To investigate the molecular basis of Leu-CAM deficiency, we studied leukocytes from four unrelated patients suffering from complete or partial Leu-CAM deficiency using immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled proteins, RNA extraction, and Northern blot analysis. We found that B cells from all four patients synthesized a normal sized beta subunit precursor that either failed to \"mature\" or matured only partially to the membrane expressed form. B cells from all four patients also had a single normal sized beta subunit mRNA of approximately 3.4 kb. Leu-CAM deficiency, in these unrelated patients, is not due to the absence of the beta chain gene or to aberrant splicing of its mRNA and are consistent with a defective beta subunit gene resulting in abnormal posttranslational processing of the synthesized molecule.\r"

Infected controls had an initial clearance of 59.4 +/- 4.9%, with a release of 19.6 +/- 3.8% (P = NS vs. AIDS). These data, in addition to Fc-receptor dysfunction, demonstrate a global reticuloendothelial system dysfunction in AIDS patients.

The active material in urine is soluble in methanol and is precipitated by ammonium reineckate at acid pH. Using gel filtration and high-pressure liquid chromatography, we have identified two major osmoprotective compounds in urine. One is glycine betaine; the other is proline betaine as demonstrated by nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectrum scanning, and chemical synthesis. Proline betaine has not been described previously to our knowledge in vertebrate tissues. It is known to be a cell volume-regulating agent for marine red algae and the euryhaline mollusk Elysia chloritica. We suggest that the presence of glycine and proline betaines in human urine may reflect an osmoprotective role for the kidney and that they protect bacteria in the urine only fortuitously.\r"

Arterialized venous plasma glucose concentrations were used to calculate glycemic thresholds of 69 +/- 2 mg/dl for epinephrine secretion, 68 +/- 2 mg/dl for glucagon secretion, 66 +/- 2 mg/dl for growth hormone secretion, and 58 +/- 3 mg/dl for cortisol secretion. In contrast, the glycemic threshold for symptoms was 53 +/- 2 mg/dl, significantly lower than the thresholds for epinephrine (P less than 0.001), glucagon (P less than 0.001), and growth hormone (P less than 0.01) secretion. Thus, the glycemic thresholds for activation of glucose counterregulatory systems during decrements in plasma glucose lie within or just below the physiologic plasma glucose concentration range, and are substantially higher than the threshold for hypoglycemic symptoms in normal humans. These findings provide further support for the concept that glucose counterregulatory systems are involved in the prevention, as well as the correction, of hypoglycemia.\r"

We have examined this question, using normal rat hepatocytes cultured on substrata of matrix proteins as a model of the interaction between cells and basal lamina in vivo. In cultures on a type I collagen substratum, albumin secretion decreased progressively after 2 d. By contrast, when cells were cultured on a laminin-rich gel matrix, albumin secretion was stable for at least 3 wk; other functions and ultrastructural morphology were similarly maintained. None of the individual matrix proteins effectively substituted for the gel matrix, suggesting that full support of hepatocellular function requires a complex of matrix proteins. We speculate that a cause of hepatocellular dysfunction in acute inflammation is disruption of this matrix and alteration of its interaction with the hepatocyte plasma membrane.\r"

With oxidant stress, her erythrocytes developed multiple dispersed Heinz bodies, but HbMS was only mildly unstable. HbMS was susceptible to proteolytic degradation in the presence of ATP. The unexpectedly severe clinical findings in HbMS-beta +-thalassemia may result from the proteolytic digestion of HbMS, as well as the excessive alpha-chains characteristic of beta +-thalassemia, which combined provide the increment of cellular damage that results in the phenotype of thalassemia intermedia.\r"

Positive normal serum-bound Ro/SSA in Western immunoblots and binding activity was demonstrated in the F(ab')2 fragment of IgG. Affinity purification of normal anti-Ro/SSA IgG increased the specific anti-Ro/SSA binding by greater than 17-fold. This purified antibody formed a Ro/SSA precipitin and had a relative affinity for Ro/SSA identical to that of Ro/SSA precipitin-positive patients. These data demonstrate that the anti-Ro/SSA present in healthy normal donors is true autoantibody. Anti-La/Sjogren's syndrome B antigen (SSB) autoantibodies were found in 3 of the 40 normal sera, while none bound nuclear ribonucleoprotein (Sm).

  ".W": "Antibodies in sera from newly diagnosed insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients are directed to a human islet cell protein of relative molecular mass (Mr) 64,000. Since IDDM seems to develop after a prodromal period of beta-cell autoimmunity, this study has examined whether 64,000 Mr antibodies could be detected in 14 individuals who subsequently developed IDDM and five first degree relatives who have indications of altered beta-cell function. Sera were screened by immunoprecipitation on total detergent lysates of human islets and positive sera retested on membrane protein preparations. Antibodies to the 64,000 Mr membrane protein were consistently detected in 11/14 IDDM patients, and in all 5 first degree relatives. 10 IDDM patients were already positive in the first samples, obtained 4-91 mo before the clinical onset of IDDM, whereas 1 patient progressed to a high 64,000 Mr immunoreactivity, at a time where a commencement of a decline in beta-cell function was detected. 64,000 Mr antibodies were detected before islet cell cytoplasmic antibodies (ICCA) in two patients. In the control groups of 21 healthy individuals, 36 patients with diseases of the thyroid and 5 SLE patients, the 64,000 Mr antibodies were detected in only one individual, who was a healthy sibling to an IDDM patient. These results suggest that antibodies against the Mr 64,000 human islet protein are an early marker of beta-cell autoimmunity and may be useful to predict a later development of IDDM.\r"

The anticytokeratin antibody reacted strongly with all cases of reactive mesothelium, mesothelioma, and lung carcinoma. Antibodies to human milk fat globule membrane and the Ca antigen stained mesothelioma and carcinoma and 43% of cases of reactive mesothelium. Staining for carcinoembryonic antigen was not detected in reactive mesothelium or mesothelioma, but was present in most of the lung carcinomas. CEA seemed to be the single most useful marker in distinguishing carcinoma from mesothelioma in that a positive reaction for CEA would indicate carcinoma rather than mesothelioma.\r"

Prekeratin expression was found (using antibodies recognising higher molecular weight cytokeratins) predominantly in areas of squamous change, independent of the underlying thyroid pathology. This study does not therefore support previous findings that prekeratin expression provides a reliable means of distinguishing follicular pattern papillary carcinoma from follicular carcinoma with its poorer prognosis or that it helps distinguish benign from malignant papillary lesions. No evidence of desmin or neurofilament expression was seen, and in particular, neurofilaments could not be detected in any of the cases of medullary carcinoma studied.\r"

Sixty four non-Hodgkin's lymphomas were also examined, of which 51 had been previously phenotypically defined. In selected cases the results were compared with those obtained using two other monoclonal antibodies MB1 and MT1, used for identifying B and T cells, respectively, in paraffin sections. MB1 stained a smaller proportion of B cell tumours than MB2 and staining was, in general, weaker, except in one case of centroblastic lymphoma. MT1 immunoreactivity was comparable with that of UCHL1, except in one case of T lymphoblastic lymphoma (MT1 positive, UCHL1 negative). None of the antibodies is ideal, but, if used as a panel, they permit the separation of B cells and T cells in paraffin sections.\r"

CA19-9 antibody recognizes an epithelial surface carbohydrate antigen originally derived from a human colorectal carcinoma cell line: it did not stain normal colorectal mucosa or adenomatous polyps, but showed focal expression of variable strength in regenerative, dysplastic, and cancerous mucosa in ulcerative colitis, and in non-colitic colorectal carcinoma.

Immunofluorescence provided the most stringent test for the performance of the enzyme immunoassay as values were improved a little when a cell culture procedure was used for comparison. Further evidence for the lack of sensitivity was the detection of elementary bodies, sometimes in large numbers, in the enzyme immunoassay buffer of 13 of 19 specimens that had given a negative enzyme immunoassay result and the finding in comparative titrations of four laboratory strains that the enzyme immunoassay was at least 100-fold less able to detect chlamydiae than either immunofluorescence or the cell culture procedure. Lack of specificity may be associated with the finding that the enzyme immunoassay antibody reacted with strains of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and group B streptococci. The enzyme immunoassay was not considered to be sufficiently sensitive, specific, or reproducible for routine use.\r"

Graft keratinocytes demonstrated epiboly as reepithelialization by the host occurred along the host/graft interface. Host epidermis regenerated rapidly, presumably from adnexae, and displaced the viable allograft along the plane of the host/graft interface. The new epidermis appeared normal in all respects.\r"

  ".U": "87138568\r", 
  ".W": "The understanding of condylomata acuminata (genital warts) has been enhanced by the recent development of diagnostic methods. Forty-two types of human papillomavirus were identified up to 1985, and at least sixteen types were involved in genital warts. The incidence of genital warts is around 0.1% in the general population and more than 0.5% in young persons. The incidence is known to be increasing rapidly and exceeding the incidence of genital herpes. Females are more prone to be affected. The epidemiologic evidence supporting the relationship between genital warts and genital cancer is overwhelming. The evidence also speaks for a strong correlation between genital warts and verrucous carcinoma of the genitalia, bowenoid papulosis, and laryngeal papilloma. The person having genital warts may also have other cutaneous warts. This observation is compatible with the finding that types of human papillomavirus involved in other cutaneous warts were found in genital warts. In view of the never and easier ways of diagnosing nonconspicuous condyloma acuminatum and the potential for malignant transformation of condyloma acuminatum, it is strongly recommended that patients should be followed up periodically for early detection of neoplasia.\r"

Fourteen of twenty-four biopsy specimens were obtained from spontaneously occurring urticarial lesions of 4 to 48 hours' duration, and ten of the twenty-four specimens were from dermographometer-induced lesions that had been present from 40 minutes to 24 hours. Twenty-one of twenty-four biopsy specimens showed extracellular fluorescence of eosinophil granule major basic protein within the dermis. The extent and intensity of extracellular staining were not related to the presence or degree of tissue eosinophilia. Serial section controls from each block were stained with protein A purified rabbit IgG and were negative. Previous immunofluorescence studies have demonstrated deposition of major basic protein in lesions of chronic idiopathic urticaria, episodic angioedema, and facial edema. Major basic protein causes release of histamine from human basophils and induces wheal-and-flare reactions on intradermal injection. The present observations add further evidence to support a role for eosinophil mediators, particularly major basic protein, in the pathogenesis of cutaneous disease characterized by edema.\r"

Sixteen of nineteen patients came to us with localized nodules or tumors, preferentially on the trunk, scalp, and lower legs. Remarkably, eight of eleven patients with disease confined to a limited area on the trunk had a history of slowly progressive papular lesions that had been present for 1 to 20 years prior to the development of rapidly growing skin tumors. Initial treatment, generally radiotherapy and/or polychemotherapy, resulted in complete remissions in seventeen of nineteen patients. Only three patients developed extracutaneous disease, whereas two other patients had recurrent disease in the skin at sites distant from the original skin lesions. Excluding three patients who had just finished initial treatment at the time of writing, twelve of sixteen patients were currently alive and in complete remission with a median survival of 44 months. Four patients died, three of whom were elderly women who had skin tumors on the lower legs when first seen. These results suggest that patients with a primary cutaneous large cell lymphoma of follicular center cell origin with disease confined to the trunk of scalp have a very favorable prognosis.\r"

Patients were treated for a period of 1 month and were evaluated weekly. A 4-week posttreatment evaluation permitted an assessment of recurrence or improvement. The follow-up visits showed 93% of the vesicular patients, 86% of the interdigital patients, and 83% of the moccasin patients had responded to topical ketoconazole therapy. The high percent of clinical efficacy seen in the first two groups corroborates treatment experiences held by most practicing dermatologists. Of practical interest, however, was the high number of responders among the moccasin-type of tinea pedis. Dermatologists rarely consider topical treatment useful for this clinical entity.\r"

  ".W": "The management of skin disease may differ in different parts of the world, but in most countries, acne should be a most treatable disease. Acne therapy has not evolved in the most logical fashion, but this article reviews our demonstration of risk factors in the treatment of acne. Young patients, male patients, truncal acne, a marked seborrhea, and a low dose (500 mg/day or less) of tetracycline are factors associated with a poorer response and, when oral therapy is stopped, a greater relapse rate. One gram a day of tetracycline, given for 6 months, is the minimum course of oral therapy and should be given along with topical therapy. One of the most widely used topical treatments is benzoyl peroxide, and this presentation was given in honor of Dr. William Pace, who was possibly the first dermatologist to be aware of the benefit of benzoyl peroxide--a fact not adequately recorded in dermatologic history. A small number of patients do not respond well to conventional therapy, but alternative treatments should bring about a successful outcome. Alternative treatments include hormonal therapy (i.e., 2 mg cyproterone acetate plus 50 micrograms ethinyl estradiol; spironolactone, 100 mg twice daily; or isotretinoin, 1 mg/kg). The success of all these treatments bears some relationship to their effect in modulating the etiologic factors of acne: an enhanced sebum production, increased ductal cornification, abnormal bacterial colonization, and the production of inflammation. Isotretinoin is the most beneficial of all drug regimens, and this fact no doubt relates to its favorable effect on all etiologic factors.\r"

During cell transformation and tumor development, the cell specificity of intermediate filament, keratin, is largely conserved. Taking advantage of this, we utilized monoclonal antikeratin immunohistochemical techniques to examine basal and squamous cell carcinomas as they became deeply invasive. Dyskeratotic keratinocytes and keratin pearls in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) stain with antikeratin antisera to larger keratins (65-67 Kd). At the deep tumor margins, SCCs no longer express larger keratins but retain expression of 50, 58 Kd, which are markers of keratinocytes derived from stratified squamous epithelial cells. This selective loss of expression of keratin polypeptide markers of differentiation in SCC is associated with progressively more aggressive biologic behavior as the tumor invades deeper structures such as muscle and bone. Recurrent basal cell carcinoma (BCC) which was of the nodular type when first excised, shows features of morphea-like BCC and of aggressive growth patterns at the deep invasive margin. At these deep margins, some tumors express markers of keratinization (65-67 Kd). While tumor cells retain the specificity of the intermediate filament, keratin, the individual cells express products of differentiation as measured by keratin expression independently of their cytologic atypia. At the deeper invasive margin of the tumor, the neoplastic cells synthesize keratin proteins in an unpredictable fashion.\r"

The consensus of the clinical research indicates that application by patients of sodium bicarbonate and hydrogen peroxide offers no advantage over the preestablished, properly performed home oral hygiene procedures. Any improvements in clinical and microbial parameters generally were attributed to scaling and root planing. The studies that have reported beneficial results with sodium bicarbonate and hydrogen peroxide have used additional antimicrobial agents, concomitant professional application of these substances, and scaling and root planing. In one of these reports, inorganic salts and chloramine-T were delivered subgingivally throughout root-planing procedures, in addition to home application of inorganic salts. Most of these patients also received at least one course of systemic tetracycline therapy. Because this study had no control group, it is impossible to determine whether this program is more effective than are other periodontal therapy programs. A more controlled clinical study involving professional application of sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride, hydrogen peroxide, and povidone-iodine has shown greater gains in clinical attachment and bone mass than has brushing with toothpaste and water. Again, subgingival scaling and root planing were necessary to attain these results. Because multiple topical agents were applied in both of these reports and systemic antimicrobial agents were used by the Keyes group, it is impossible to determine which agent was responsible for the improvements. Further, professional application may be the crucial factor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "87138854\r", 
  ".W": "Pulmonary artery pressure was noninvasively estimated by three Doppler echocardiographic methods in 50 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. First, a systolic transtricuspid gradient was calculated from Doppler-detected tricuspid regurgitation; clinical jugular venous pressure or a fixed value of 14 mm Hg was added to yield systolic pulmonary artery pressure. Second, acceleration time from pulmonary flow analysis was used in a regression equation to derive mean pulmonary artery pressure. Third, right ventricular isovolumic relaxation time was calculated from Doppler-determined pulmonary valve closure and tricuspid valve opening; systolic pulmonary artery pressure was then derived from a nomogram. In 48 patients (96%) at least one of the methods could be employed. A tricuspid pressure gradient, obtained in 36 patients (72%), provided reliable prediction of systolic pulmonary artery pressure. The prediction was superior when 14 mm Hg rather than estimated jugular venous pressure was used to account for right atrial pressure. In 44 patients (88%), pulmonary flow was analyzed. Prediction of mean pulmonary artery pressure was unsatisfactory (r = 0.65) but improved (r = 0.85) when only patients with a heart rate between 60 and 100 beats/min were considered. The effect of correcting pulmonary flow indexes for heart rate was examined by correlating different flow indexes before and after correction for heart rate. There was a good correlation between corrected acceleration time and either systolic (r = -0.85) or mean (r = -0.83) pulmonary artery pressure. Because of a high incidence of arrhythmia, right ventricular relaxation time could be determined in only 11 patients (22%). Noninvasive prediction of pulmonary artery pressure is feasible in most patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The acute rejection of cardiac allografts is currently diagnosed by the presence of myocyte necrosis on endomyocardial biopsy. We evaluated the efficacy of noninvasive scintigraphic imaging with indium-111-labeled anticardiac myosin Fab fragments (indium-111 antimyosin) to detect and quantify cardiac allograft rejection. Six dogs that had intrathoracic heterotopic cardiac allograft transplantation were injected with indium-111 antimyosin and planar and single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) images were obtained in various stages of acute and subacute rejection. Four dogs had an allograft older than 8 months and had been on long-term immunosuppressive therapy; two dogs had an allograft less than 2 weeks old and were not on immunosuppressive therapy. Count ratios comparing heterotopic with native hearts were calculated from both SPECT images and in vitro scans of excised and sectioned hearts and were compared with the degree of rejection scored by an independent histopathologic review. Indium-111 antimyosin uptake was not visible in planar or SPECT images of native hearts. Faint diffuse uptake was apparent in cardiac allografts during long-term immunosuppression and intense radioactivity was present in hearts with electrocardiographic evidence of rejection. The heterotopic to native heart count ratios in SPECT images correlated significantly with the count ratios in the excised hearts (r = 0.93) and with the histopathologic rejection score (r = 0.97). The distribution of indium-111 antimyosin activity in right and left ventricles corresponded to areas of histopathologic abnormalities. Immunoperoxidase studies showed deposition of indium-111 antimyosin only in areas of myocyte necrosis. The results demonstrate that indium-111 antimyosin imaging can noninvasively detect the presence, location and severity of canine cardiac allograft rejection.\r"

  ".U": "87138872\r", 
  ".W": "Eppinger and Rothberger in 1909 and 1910 first acknowledged the importance of the conduction system, yet a confusion of the pattern of left bundle branch block with right bundle branch block resulted which persisted for 25 years. In left bundle branch block, right ventricular endocardial activation begins before, and is often completed before, initiation of left ventricular endocardial activation. Most likely, right to left septal activation then follows, resulting in left ventricular endocardial activation. Although it is hazardous to make definitive diagnoses of infarction in the presence of left bundle branch block, clues do exist. Benign left bundle branch block is rare; usually disease becomes manifest. Electrocardiographic criteria of hypertrophy are not as helpful in older patients with chronic left bundle branch block (mainly because of the very high incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy) as in younger patients with block of nonatherosclerotic origin. Left bundle branch block is often associated with other abnormalities of the conduction system. Fascicular blocks may mask or mimic myocardial infarction. Left posterior fascicular block is most often an indicator of left ventricular myocardial deficit if right ventricular enlargement is eliminated. Mortality is higher in patients with associated left axis deviation than in those with a normal axis, although the incidence of progression of atrioventricular (AV) block is low. In symptomatic patients with prolonged His to ventricular intervals, the incidence of progression of AV block is higher (12%). Preexisting left bundle branch block in the absence of clinical evidence of heart disease is rare, yet carries with it a slightly increased mortality. Newly acquired left bundle branch block carries a 10-fold increase in mortality; the incidence of sudden death as the first manifestation of heart disease is increased 10-fold.\r"

The duration of their cough before the MCH challenge ranged from 2 months to 13 years. Their FEV1 ranged 62% to 132% predicted. Thirty-six (49%) patients had a positive MCH challenge. The MCH concentration inhaled to decrease the FEV1 by 20% ranged from 0.55 to 25 mg/ml. Follow-up data (mean 14 months) were available on all 74 patients. Fifty-four patients received asthma medications, and 93% improved in mean 3.6 weeks. At the end of the follow-up, 22 (30%) were asymptomatic, 39 (53%) were improved, and 13 patients (17%) were symptomatic. We were unable to predict bronchial hyperreactivity in this population on the basis of duration of the cough, personal or family history of allergies, or baseline spirometry. Thus, MCH challenge is helpful in evaluating children with chronic cough and in guiding therapy. Follow-up of children with chronic cough is important. Eleven percent of this study population progressed to develop bronchial asthma. Forty percent of these patients, initially doing well, were asymptomatic at the end of the follow-up period.\r"

Seventeen patients with hay fever and with a positive skin test for timothy and/or birch pollen allergens were studied in a pollen-free season. Skin prick tests for these two allergens as well as a negative saline and a positive histamine control were made with a preloaded standardized prick test needle. The area of the induced wheal-and-flare reaction was measured 15 minutes after allergen application, and any induced late-phase responses were measured after 6 hours. After a baseline recording, the patients treated the volar aspect of one forearm twice daily with a cream of 0.05% clobetasol 17-propionate and the other forearm with the equivalent vehicle in a randomized, double-blind fashion. After 1 week the skin prick test was repeated on both arms. A statistically significant reduction of the allergen-induced wheal-and-flare response was found after active treatment as compared to control and pretreatment values. A reduction was also found in the histamine-induced flare but not the wheal reaction as compared to the control. A late-phase dermal reaction was found in six of the patients, and this was statistically significantly reduced by the glucocorticosteroid pretreatment. Thus, in similarity to findings in vivo on the human nose and bronchus, we found, in addition to the well-known glucocorticosteroid-induced reduction of the allergic late-phase response, an inhibition of the dermal immediate allergic reaction as well.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The best response to therapy in terms of rise in FEV1, forced expiratory flow rate between 25% and 75% of FVC, and area under the curve (change in lung function with time) occurred with 5 and 10 mg of metaproterenol. The highest dose, 15 mg, produced significantly less bronchodilation. Although there were no electrocardiographic abnormalities, pulse rate was significantly higher with 10 and 15 mg of metaproterenol than with 5 mg. Five milligrams of metaproterenol aerosol solution is the optimal bronchodilating dose for treating acute asthma in children. Repeating this dose provides some additional bronchodilation and is well tolerated.\r"

The same TCS were also tested for their influence on the histamine release from leukocytes of house dust mites-sensitive patients. Addition of TCS to B cell cultures from allergic donors induced a dose-dependent increase of the spontaneous IgE production without affecting the synthesis of IgG, IgM, and IgA. The potentiating activity of TCS was observed only in B cell cultures spontaneously producing IgE; TCS were still active on irradiated B cells. The maximal IgE-enhancing activity was observed when TCS were added at the onset of B cell cultures. The supernatants of T cells lysed at day 0 did not contain IgE-potentiating factors. The antigen-induced but not the spontaneous histamine release from leukocytes of house dust mite-sensitive patients was enhanced by pretreatment with TCS from allergic donors. The enhancing activities of TCS on IgE synthesis and on histamine release could be removed by absorption with IgE-Sepharose and subsequently recovered by elution with glycine buffer. The results indicate that T cells of patients with asthma spontaneously release IgE-binding factors capable of increasing both the spontaneous IgE synthesis by B cells and the antigen-induced histamine release.\r"

Intradermal skin tests were done to a battery of common antigens. The methacholine challenge response was expressed as the area under the dose-response curve integrated to a 35% fall in the FEV1 or 800 breath units. Thirty-three subjects with asthma, 47 normal subjects from normal families (NF), 59 normal subjects from families with asthma (AF), 31 allergic subjects without asthma, 23 subjects with questionable asthma, and 18 subjects with prior asthma were studied. Overall, 50% of the subjects without asthma had a negative response to methacholine. There was a difference (p less than 0.02) in the distribution of log10 methacholine area under the dose-response curve integrated to a 35% fall in the FEV1 or 800 breath units responses in normal subjects from NFs compared to normal subjects from AFs. The allergic subjects from AF had a greater degree of bronchial reactivity compared to normal individuals from NF. The age of the normal subjects had an influence on the degree of bronchial reactivity. Methacholine challenge studies in adult patients need to be interpreted with age and family history in mind.\r"

Meals were served at 0800 (20% total daily calories) and 1200 h (40% of total daily calories), and blood drawn just before the 0800 hours meal and at hourly intervals thereafter until 1600 hours. Statistical evaluation of the results of these measurements indicated that day-long plasma glucose and insulin levels were higher in the older individuals. In contrast, the day-long FFA response was reduced in this age group. These data suggest that the ability of insulin to maintain normal plasma glucose levels deteriorates with age, whereas regulation of FFA levels does not.\r"

None of 14 sera from age matched controls demonstrated this pattern of staining. The vascular pattern of staining seen with SDAT sera was identical to the immunofluorescent staining of brain by a monoclonal antibody to vascular basement membrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Immunoabsorption of SDAT sera with purified vascular proteoglycan abolished the staining of brain vessels. Using an enzyme linked immunoassay, 3 of the 6 vascular-reactive SDAT sera, and none of the 24 sera from aged controls, were shown to contain antibodies to purified vascular heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Proteoglycans play an important role in the barrier function of the blood-brain barrier. Autoimmune injury to the blood-brain barrier by antivascular antibody may play a role in the pathogenesis of dementia by permitting the passage of injurious substances into the brain.\r"

These Ab neutralized human recombinant IL 1 alpha (rIL 1 alpha) activity effectively, but did not interfere with human rIL 1 beta, murine rIL 1 alpha, or human rIL 2 activity. Fifty percent of rIL 1 alpha activity (25 U/ml, or 2.5 ng/ml) was neutralized by less than 0.06 microgram/ml of rabbit anti-IL 1 alpha Ab (R-38.3G) and by less than 0.13 microgram/ml of monoclonal Ab (clone 28(3B1], respectively. In other experiments, 10 micrograms/ml of rabbit anti-IL 1 alpha Ab could effectively neutralize 50% of 2000 U of rIL 1 alpha activity, and the same amount of monoclonal Ab neutralized 50% of 500 U/ml of rIL 1 alpha activity. Not only IL 1 alpha activity in the thymocyte costimulator assay, but also IL 1-dependent IL 2 production by a human leukemic cell line, HSB.2 subclone, were blocked by these polyclonal or monoclonal Ab. In addition, pI 4.9 IL 1 activity produced by the myelomonocytic cell line THP-1 and by the Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cell lines, were neutralized by these Ab, suggesting that these cell lines also produce IL 1 alpha. The specificity of these polyclonal and monoclonal Ab was further confirmed by immunochemical method (Western blotting), in which anti-IL 1 alpha Ab reacted with rIL 1 alpha in a specific manner. Furthermore, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system has been developed that can detect low levels of IL 1 alpha activity (less than 0.3 ng/ml or less than 3 U/ml), which is still less sensitive than thymocyte comitogenic assay and considerably less sensitive than the D10 assay. Finally, anti-IL 1 alpha Ab-conjugated affinity columns were prepared, by which IL 1 alpha activity, but not IL 1 beta activity, was specifically adsorbed and eluted effectively.\r"

Because these interacting domains are likely to be sterically complementary to each other, antibodies specific for these domains should also be sterically complementary or of anti-idiotypic specificity. To test this hypothesis, rabbit anti-human C3 IgG antibodies which bound to Sepharose-coupled rabbit anti-factor H IgG (anti-H-binding anti-C3) were separated by affinity chromatography. In a control experiment, the anti-human factor H column was found to bind 10 times more anti-C3 antibodies than a Sepharose column coupled with nonimmune rabbit IgG. The binding specificity of the control eluate was indistinguishable from the original anti-C3 preparation, whereas the anti-H-binding anti-C3 was shown to be enriched in regard to antibodies directed against the 42 kd fragment of the C3 alpha-chain of C3c, as demonstrated by immunoblotting of electrophoretically separated polypeptides of C3c and C3d in polyacrylamide gels. In competition binding studies, factor H was 25 times more potent as inhibitor of the anti-H-binding anti-C3 than of the original anti-C3 preparation. This similarity in binding specificity also paralleled a functional similarity in that anti-H-binding anti-C3 in the presence of factor I effected a 20% degradation of the alpha'-chain of C3b into fragments of 65, 45, and 42 kd which are the normal degradation products in the presence of factors I and H. These results suggest that the affinity procedure described resulted in the enrichment of anti-C3 antibodies with selective specificities for factor H-binding domains of C3, from a polyclonal antibody source.\r"

  ".W": "Nonimmune activation of the first component of complement (C1) by cardiolipin (CL) vesicles present specific features which were not demonstrated on immune complexes. CL vesicles which activate C1 in the presence of C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) were found to bind C1s in the absence of C1r, and to induce a specific C1r-independent cleavage of C1q-bound C1s. Therefore, several known natural nonimmune activators were analyzed by comparing their ability to activate C1 in the presence of C1-INH and to mediate a C1r-independent cleavage of C1s. Freshly isolated human heart mitochondria (HHM) activated C1 only in the absence of C1-INH. However, mitoplasts derived from HHM (HHMP) activated C1 regardless of the presence of C1-INH, and induced a specific cleavage of C1q-bound C1s. The same pattern was observed in the case of smooth E. coli and a semi-rough E. coli strain. DNA, known to activate C1 only in the absence of C1-INH, does not induce C1s cleavage in the absence of C1r. Thus, nonimmune activators can be classified into two distinct categories. \"Strong\" activators, such as CL vesicles, HHMP, or the semi-rough E. coli strain J5 can activate C1 in the presence of C1-INH. By using C1qs2 as a probe, they exhibit a specific, C1r-independent cleavage of C1s. C1s-binding to C1q is a critical factor for the activation process in this group. In the case of \"weak\" activators, such as E. coli smooth strains, DNA, or HHM, no C1s-binding to activator-bound C1q was detected, and C1r-independent C1s cleavage and C1 activation in the presence of C1-INH were not observed. As in the case of immune complexes, C1r activation appears to play a key role in the C1 activation by \"weak\" activators.\r"

The structure of the oral keratinocytes in vitro is the same in primary cultures and subcultures. The cells stratify, are characterized by well-developed tonofibrillar-desmosomal complexes, and rarely exhibit signs of terminal differentiation. Unique features of the culture system that favor keratinocyte growth are: incubation at 34 degrees C, inclusion of 0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide in the culture medium, and initiating subcultures as 5.0 mm colonies containing 100,000/20 microliter of medium. One primary culture can yield 6 first-passage subcultures, which subsequently achieve confluence in 10-12 days. Such cultures are a useful source of human keratinocytes that stratify but generally do not undergo terminal differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "The fine structural organization of the epidermis, dermal/epidermal junction, and dermis from an unexposed site (upper inner arm) of elderly people was compared with the organization of a similar region of young people. Despite an overall thinning of the epidermis and focal areas of cytologic atypia, the characteristic morphological markers associated with the keratinization process are not markedly altered in appearance or amount. A well-formed stratum corneum consisting of flattened, enucleated horny cells enveloped by a thickened membrane, and intracellular spaces filled with electron-dense material provide structural evidence that barrier ability is not compromised in senile skin. The dermal/epidermal changes in aged skin are marked and have significant physiologic implications. The major change is a relatively flat dermal/epidermal junction resulting from the retraction of the epidermal papillae as well as the microprojections of basal cells into the dermis. This flattening results in a more fragile epidermal/dermal interface and, consequently, the epidermis is less resistant to shearing forces. Retraction of the epidermal downgrowths (preferential sites of the putative epidermal stem cell) may also explain the loss in proliferative capacity associated with the aged epidermis. The three-dimensional arrangements of collagen and elastic fibers showed marked alterations with age. Both fibrous components appear more compact because of a decrease in spaces between the fibers. Collagen bundles appear to unravel, and the individual elastic fibers show signs of elastosis. These changes may contribute to the loss of resilience that is one of the salient features of senile skin.\r"

Sera from 103 individuals for whom a complete clinical history was available were evaluated in detail. Most sera recognized both the gp160 and the p55 gag precursor protein. Because these two antigens are found primarily in infected cells, the results suggest that this association makes them more immunogenic. A high prevalence of antibodies to the polymerase gene products (p65 and p31) and to a viral protein p48, which is not yet fully defined, was also noted. Many sera, particularly those from patients with Kaposi's sarcoma or Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, lacked antibodies to both p25 and gp41. These antibody patterns could help predict the prognosis for virus-infected individuals.\r"

It is generally assumed that this cleavage is an intracellular function of the host cell. Human adenoid fibroblast (HAF) lines, which support the growth of influenza A virus but release virus with an uncleaved HA, provide a model system that has allowed exploration of mechanisms of cleavage in vivo. Exposure of HAF-grown influenza virus to nasal secretions from children with respiratory tract symptoms induced HA cleavage and rendered virus fully infectious. Characterization of this proteolytic enzyme, present in the extracellular environment of the respiratory tract, suggests that it is a serine endopeptidase.\r"

Growth conditions within the infected foci of four patients with TSS included nearly physiological levels of pH, pO2, pCO2, protein, calcium, and magnesium. Two strains of S. aureus had typical TSS phenotypes (production of TSS toxin-1 [TSST-1] and protease), which were optimally expressed in vitro under conditions similar to those documented in vivo (6% CO2, pH 7.0, aerobic, high levels of protein). Altering any one of these growth factors significantly decreased production of TSST-1. In protein-containing media, depletion of divalent cations had a less-profound effect on organism growth and TSST-1 production. The unique in vivo environment in patients with non-menstrual TSS is similar to conditions associated with tampon use during menstruation. Growth conditions may play an important role in the expression of S. aureus phenotype and the pathogenesis of TSS.\r"

As an alternative, PB was immobilized on a solid phase (Sepharose 4B; Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden), and a system of plasmapheresis was developed in the conscious rat, with specific on-line plasma adsorption of endotoxin by a PB-Sepharose column. PB-Sepharose columns removed 94% of a challenge dose of 5 micrograms of endotoxin in vitro. Rats were pretreated with lead acetate so that they were sensitized to endotoxin and then given 10 micrograms of endotoxin/kg intraarterially. After 15 min plasmapheresis was begun and continued for 90 min. Animals whose plasma was perfused over PB-Sepharose were protected from endotoxin-induced leukopenia (P less than .01), thrombocytopenia (P less than .001), and death (four of four survivors compared with none of four controls). Thus plasmapheresis with on-line removal of endotoxin is a safe and highly effective means of protecting animals from the effects of endotoxemia.\r"

Thirty EPEC made elevated levels (greater than or equal to 10(4) 50% cytotoxic doses/mg of cell lysate protein) of a cytotoxin for HeLa cells, and cell-associated cytotoxicity for 27 of these isolates was neutralized by antibody to Shiga toxin. Cell lysates of these isolates were paralytic and lethal for mice. Phages from cytotoxin-producing strains were tested for toxin-converting capacity. Fifteen of 30 such strains harbored toxin-converting phages, and the cytotoxicity of 12 isolates of E. coli K12 transduced with these phages was neutralized by antibody to Shiga toxin. Fifty-seven EPEC exhibited either localized or diffuse adherence to HEp-2 cells, but only nine producers of elevated levels of cytotoxin were adherent.\r"

Whole-cell lysates of SF1Ep cells contained a large number of glycoproteins, which might be related to the sialic acid-inhibitable attachment. When the cells and extracellular matrix were fractionated, only a few proteins were found in the matrix fraction. They included a 220-kilodalton (kDa) protein, shown by immunoblotting to be fibronectin, and an approximately 90-kDa protein (both were isolated on SDS-PAGE gels).

Serum antibodies to 100-kDa, 32-kDa, and 29-kDa antigens occurred only in women who did not develop salpingitis. Differences in antibody prevalence to specific chlamydial antigens were not due to differences in serum antibody titers between the two groups. No correlation between neutralizing sera and the risk of postabortal salpingitis was detected.\r"
