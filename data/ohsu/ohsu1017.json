  ".W": "Grafts of trypsin-treated, gamma-irradiated human amniotic membranes were used to cover injured uterine horns of nulliparous female rabbits to prevent adhesions. In this study, the gradual integration of the membranes into the serosal layer of the uterus, together with marked neovascularization, was observed. By the 30th postoperative day, the grafts had been completely integrated, with little evidence of rejection and no evidence of infection at the graft sites. Of 30 uterine horns treated with membrane grafts, only 4 (13.4%) showed any adhesion formation at or among the graft sites. All of the 24 untreated controls showed adhesion formation at the site of injury. Furthermore, whatever adhesions were found in membrane-treated horns could be graded as thin and filmy, accounting for less than 10% of the surface area of the graft, whereas the controls showed dense, thick adhesions covering 50% to 100% of the injured areas. We conclude that these specially prepared amniotic membranes are safe and effective in dramatically reducing postoperative adhesion formation in this animal model.\r"

However, when cytogenetic analysis in the daughter was performed, a terminal deletion in the long arm of one of the X-chromosomes was found. The karyotype was: 46,Xdel(X),(q25-qter). Chromosomal investigation in the mother showed an identical deletion. The karyotype of the patient's 35-year-old sister is normal. She has a normal menstrual cycle and two normal children. The presence of such familial cases suggests that chromosomal investigation should be considered in young women with oligomenorrhea, especially those whose mothers have experienced a premature menopause.\r"

We report the successful nonsurgical transfer of frozen-thawed embryos into the fallopian tube after our initial attempt resulting in an ongoing IUP. The process is relatively simple, safe, and avoids the risks of general anesthesia. Unlike US-guided tubal cannulation, this technique offers direct, clear visualization of the tubal ostium, assuring the desired catheter placement. As well, hysteroscopic guidance allows an accurate estimate of the depth of catheter insertion within the fallopian tube, which may be a critical factor in successful tubal deposition of gametes or embryos. Whether prolonged carbon dioxide exposure of the tubal microenvironment and/or direct endometrial trauma limits the efficacy of this technique remains to be determined. Finally, outpatient hysteroscopic directed tubal cannulation holds promise as a methodological technique that ultimately assists in the examination of the best site for embryo deposition (tubal versus uterine) and/or method of delivery (nonsurgical versus surgical).\r"

A variety of direct methodologies have been applied to physician-patient interactions to answer different types of questions. This study describes the development and evaluation of a 20-item direct observation scale for physician-patient interactions, the Davis Observation Code (DOC). The study compared the rates of occurrence of four key physician behaviors measurable by both direct observation and chart audit: disease prevention, health education, health promotion, and compliance checking. Forty-nine videotaped physician-patient interactions were independently analyzed using the DOC. The medical record of each videotaped encounter was also reviewed. Reliability determined by inter-rater agreement regarding the presence/absence of each was acceptable for both direct observation and chart audit. Rates of occurrence of each target behavior differed between the two methods of review; chart audit consistently yielded lower rates. Nonparametric correlation analyses yielded phi values ranging from .12 to .49, suggesting low concurrent validity. Most of the discordance between the results of the videotaped observation and chart audit involved underreporting in the chart of observed behavior by the physician. Implications of the findings for health care delivery research are discussed.\r"

Physicians in the experimental group were instructed in methods of weight reduction, which they then passed on to their patients. Patients of experimental physicians were seen monthly, their diets were discussed, and improvements were suggested. The control group patients received their usual care. After six months the experimental patients had lost significantly more weight than the controls and had significantly reduced the number of antihypertensive drugs while maintaining blood pressure control. After 12 months there was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to weight loss, blood pressure, or number of antihypertensive drugs. Experimental and control patients who lost weight had visited their physicians more frequently than those who did not and had reduced the number of antihypertensive medications they were taking. This educationally oriented intervention trial is an example of the type of research that is practical to perform in a family practice center and is applicable in family physicians' offices.\r"

Compared to controls, adoptive and biological mothers reported more fatigue, less readiness to work at a job, and less activity with household chores and recreational or social functions. In addition, biological mothers complained of more breast and genitourinary problems than did adoptive mothers or controls. Apart from their fatigue and hesitation to work at a job, adoptive mothers reported relatively good health, with the best mental health outcomes and the fewest acute physical problems of the three groups. These findings suggest that, for both adoptive and birth mothers, some aspects of postpartum recovery may continue up to and beyond the sixth postpartum week.\r"

Multiple presenting complaints and visit diagnoses both rose with age. In spite of this evidence of increased complexity of elderly patients, mean visit length for cough, dizziness, diabetes, and general medical examinations failed to rise, with longest visits tending to be among middle-aged patients. Performance of blood pressure examinations, rectal examinations, breast examinations, pelvic examinations, and Papanicolaou (Pap) smears on patients presenting for general medical examinations tended to decline beyond age 65. These results suggest that individual office visits for older patients may be less comprehensive than those for younger adults.\r"

Unfortunately, it is less well suited to the management of a number of modern health care problems, including chronic incurable illnesses, health promotion and disease prevention, and normal life events such as pregnancy, well-child care, and death and dying. It is not particularly conducive to an interdisciplinary team approach and tends to shift control of health away from the patient and toward the physician. Since when using this approach the enemies are disease and death, defeat is inevitable. Proposed here is a goal-oriented approach that is well suited to a greater variety of health care issues, is more compatible with a team approach, and places a greater emphasis on physician-patient collaboration. Each individual is encouraged to achieve the highest possible level of health as defined by that individual. Characterized by a greater emphasis on individual strengths and resources, this approach represents a more positive approach to health care. The enemy, not disease or death but inhumanity, can almost always be averted.\r"

House calls were not required in the curriculum for 80% of respondents, 30% never did house calls in residency, and 55% recognized they were not well trained in house calls. Graduates of programs in which faculty made house calls and those in which residents made house calls on a longitudinal basis were significantly more likely to offer house calls in their practices. This suggests that resident education can offer positive experiences in house call training to encourage future physicians to include house calls in their practices.\r"

Intracellular recordings of membrane potential responses recorded 3-5 mm oral to the transmural stimulus consisted of an inhibitory junction potential followed by two distinct depolarizations referred to as early and late excitatory junction potentials. Substance P antagonism was achieved by desensitization with high doses of substance P or use of the antagonist Spantide (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). Substance P antagonism had no effect on the amplitude of the inhibitory junction potential, caused an increase in the latter portion of the early excitatory junction potential, and abolished the late excitatory junction potential. The excitatory junction potential potentiated by substance P receptor antagonism was associated with a decrease in membrane resistance, increased in amplitude with conditioning hyperpolarizations to the estimated equilibrium potential for K+, and was blocked by the Cl-/HCO3- exchange inhibitor DIDS or prolonged perfusion with low-chloride solution. These studies suggest that a noncholinergic, non-substance P neurotransmitter is released from enteric motoneurons that produces excitation through an increase in smooth muscle chloride conductance.\r"

In 19 healthy human subjects, intraluminal anal canal pressure was measured with a 5-cm perfused sleeve sensor during the day while fasting (3 hours) and after feeding (3 hours) and at night during sleep (8 hours). Daytime mean anal canal pressures (+/- SEM) while fasting (50 +/- 3 mm Hg) were similar to those after feeding (49 +/- 3 mm Hg) and to those at night during sleep (49 +/- 3 mm Hg). Marked minute-to-minute variations in mean pressure occurred in all three periods, however, as did large phasic increases and decreases in pressure (greater than 20 mm Hg) and small phasic changes in pressure less than 20 mm Hg (anal slow waves). The minute-to-minute variations in mean pressure were greater during the awake fed state (4 +/- 1 mm Hg/min) than at night during sleep (2 +/- 1 mm Hg/min; P less than 0.03), as were the number of large phasic waves per minute (increases in pressure: awake, fed = 0.5 +/- 1 waves/min, night = 0.3 +/- 0.1 waves/min, P less than 0.05; decreases in pressure: awake, fed = 0.4 +/- 0.1 waves/min, night = 0.2 +/- 0.1 waves/min, P less than 0.05). Anal small waves had a similar frequency of about 17 waves/min in all three states. In conclusion, the anal sphincter maintains a continuous pressure barrier to rectal outflow both during the day and at night during sleep. However, marked minute-to-minute variations in mean pressure and large phasic increases and decreases in pressure do occur. Both are fewer at night during sleep.\r"

The pattern of change in the distribution of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase-, substance P-, calcitonin gene-related peptide-, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-like immunoreactive nerve fibres that was observed in the ileum from diabetic rats was not evident in the myenteric plexus of distal colon. In contrast to the ileum, there was no evidence of degenerative change in any of the nerve types investigated in the myenteric plexus of the distal colon. The level of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide in the diabetic rat ileum was significantly increased, whereas the level of noradrenaline was reduced; no such changes were observed in the distal colon. The tissue content of noradrenaline in the celiac ganglion, which projects to the ileum, was increased at 8-week diabetes compared with both weight-restricted and untreated controls, whereas the diabetic state had no effect on the levels of noradrenaline of the inferior mesenteric ganglion, which projects to the distal colon. It is concluded that there is a differential effect of streptozotocin-diabetes on different regions of the rat intestine. The adrenergic and peptidergic innervation of the distal colon were changed little compared with ileum. This may be explainable in terms of the different functional roles of these two regions of the intestine and/or by the difference in origin of the sympathetic nerves supplying the two regions of the intestine.\r"

  ".W": "Data collected by nine population-based tumor registries participating in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program of the National Cancer Institute were analyzed to characterize the epidemiology of noncarcinoid adenocarcinomas of the colon and rectum in young adults. Tumors diagnosed in persons under 40 years old between 1973 and 1984 (n = 1736) were compared with those in persons 40 years and older (n = 106,760). This first large U.S. population-based study of colorectal adenocarcinomas in the young shows a higher incidence in blacks than whites and later detection in black males. It also shows a higher proportion of tumors of mucinous and signet ring histological type than in older age groups. Among the younger group, the average annual age-adjusted incidence rate was 34% higher in black males than in white males (12.6 vs. 9.4 per million persons) and 46% higher in black females than in white females (13.0 vs 8.9 per million persons). The proportion of tumors that were right-sided varied by age: 0-29 years, 30%; 30-39 years, 26%; 40-49 years, 22%; 50-59 years, 21%; 60-69 years, 24%; 70-79 years, 30%; and 80+ years, 35%. Males under age 40 were less likely to present with localized disease (whites, 27%; blacks, 21%) than were those aged 40 and older (whites, 39%; blacks, 36%). The proportion of tumors classified as mucinous decreased with age, from 28% among those aged 0-19 years to 5% among those 40 years and older. A similar trend was observed for signet ring tumors. Although this latter type accounted for 10% of large-bowel tumors among subjects aged 0-19 years, this proportion decreased with age to 0.2% in those 40 years and older.\r"

  ".W": "Glucagon has been regarded as a hepatotrophic factor, although it is also known to stimulate energy-consuming reactions in the liver, such as gluconeogenesis and ureogenesis. To clarify the effect of glucagon on the hepatic energy metabolism, the changes in arterial ketone body ratio, which reflects the hepatic mitochondrial redox state [( NAD+]/[NADH]), as well as those in energy charge and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation of the liver after IV glucagon injection were studied in normal rabbits. Arterial ketone body ratio decreased significantly from 1.04 +/- 0.08 to 0.61 +/- 0.11 (mean +/- SEM; P less than 0.01) within 30 minutes after glucagon injection. Hepatic energy charge also decreased from 0.883 +/- 0.014 to 0.789 +/- 0.014 (P less than 0.01) at 30 minutes, whereas mitochondrial phosphorylation rate inversely increased from 38.4 +/- 9.5 to 87.3 +/- 9.7 (nanomoles adenosine triphosphate per milligram mitochondrial protein per minute; P less than 0.01) at 30 minutes. Arterial ketone body ratio and energy charge were subsequently restored to the initial values at 60 minutes and 2 hours, respectively. The present study suggests that glucagon causes an increase in energy expenditure in the liver that results in a transient decrease in hepatic energy charge accompanied by a decrease in arterial ketone body ratio.\r"

Gallstone-free patients (n = 16) undergoing cholecystectomy because of adenomyomas or polyps of the gallbladder served as controls. The mean levels of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity, rate-determining enzymes in bile acid, and cholesterol synthesis, respectively, were twofold to threefold higher in the ileum-resected patients than in the controls. Significant positive correlations were obtained between length of resected ileum and cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity. Provided patients who had received total parenteral nutrition preoperatively were excluded from analysis, a significant correlation was also observed between length of resected ileum and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity. Significant positive correlations were also obtained between length of resected ileum and serum levels of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol (a marker for bile acid biosynthesis) and lathosterol (a marker for cholesterol synthesis). The plasma levels of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were negatively correlated to the length of resected ileum. The expression of hepatic low-density lipoprotein-receptor binding activity was determined in five of the patients and in three of the controls. A significant positive correlation was observed between 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity and low-density lipoprotein-receptor binding activity. The results show that malabsorption of bile acids leads to parallel stimulation of cholesterol synthesis, cholesterol degradation, and low-density lipoprotein-receptor expression in human liver. The resulting effect in the present patients was a significant reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.\r"

  ".W": "Functional liver heterogeneity depends on the current perihepatic environment. The effect of chronic bile drainage on hepatic secretion of bile acids in periportal and pericentral rat liver cells was studied. After 4 days of biliary drainage, rat livers were perfused in vitro in either forward (through the portal vein) or backward direction (through the vena cava) in single-pass arrangement with taurodeoxycholate (32 nmol.min-1.g liver-1). Tritium-labeled taurodeoxycholate (0.5 muCi) was injected as a pulse to determine uptake, biotransformation, and hepatic secretion. During bile drainage, bile flow fell from 1.8 microL.min-1.g liver-1 to approximately 0.6 microL.min-1.g liver-1. Bile acid secretion rate dropped from initially 50 nmol.min-1.g liver-1 to approximately 5 nmol.min-1.g liver-1 within 24 hours and remained at this level for the next 3 days. After bile drainage, liver histology was well preserved and was indistinguishable from controls. During liver perfusion of controls in both directions, bile flow exceeded 1 microL.min-1.g liver-1, whereas bile-drained animals demonstrated a bile flow between 0.4 and 0.6 microL.min-1.g liver-1. In contrast to controls, the drained-animal liver did not excrete label exclusively in bile but simultaneously excreted about one third back to the perfusate medium (regurgitation). Biliary bile acid recovery within the first 10 minutes after 3H-taurodeoxycholate bolus injection was 90% (of label taken up) in forward-perfused controls but only 40% in forward-perfused drained animals. Backward-perfused control and drained animals. Backward-perfused control and drained animals excreted about 20% in this time interval and did not differ significantly. T50, the time to excrete 50% of label taken up in bile or both bile and effluent, increased from 4.3 +/- 0.36 minutes (SD) in forward-perfused controls to 13.2 +/- 2.28 minutes in forward-perfused, drained animals. T50 of backward-perfused controls and backward-perfused drained animals did not differ significantly (17.8 +/- 1.75 minutes vs. 21.0 +/- 3.95 minutes). In conclusion, chronic bile drainage reduces liver heterogeneity with respect to velocity of bile acid excretion and cell polarity is lost with respect to hepatocellular translocation of bile acids.\r"

The liver has high levels of two types of superoxide dismutase enzymes, cytosolic Cu-Zn and mitochondrial Mn enzymes. The aim of the present study was to investigate the content of two distinct superoxide dismutases in liver during the perinatal transition from a hypoxic to a hyperoxic environment. Both isozymes were purified to homogeneity and used as immunogens in rabbits. Antisera raised were found to recognize only polypeptides of molecular weight 16,900 or 23,400, which correspond to Cu-Zn and Mn superoxide dismutases, respectively. It was found that the level of Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase enzymatic activity and protein as assessed by immunoquantitation increased 10-fold during the postnatal period, reaching adult levels by 3 weeks. In contrast, the amount of Mn superoxide dismutase content increased only twofold to adult levels during the first week of life. Neither of the superoxide dismutases showed an alteration in specific activity or apparent molecular weight in rat livers during ontogeny. These results show that the levels of two intracellular superoxide dismutases are differentially elevated during the perinatal period. It is suggested that each dismutase plays a different physiological role for superoxide scavenging in liver as a function of the hypoxic/hyperoxic environment at birth.\r"

Urinary excretion rates of all prostanoids (renal and extrarenal) were increased in subjects with liver disease compared with normal controls. Moreover, they were considerably higher in subjects with severe hepatic decompensation but good renal function compared with those with hepatorenal syndrome. In contrast, the excretion rate of all metabolites was reduced in patients with chronic renal failure. The excretion rate of all metabolites was markedly elevated during the early stages of hepatorenal syndrome and decreased in parallel with creatinine clearance. When corrected for creatinine clearance, there was a strong correlation between prostanoid excretion and serum bilirubin in subjects with liver disease; there was no difference, however, in the excretion of renal and extrarenal prostanoids between hepatorenal syndrome and severe hepatic decompensation. It is concluded that hepatic decompensation is associated with a progressive increase in prostanoid excretion but that changes in production of prostacyclin or thromboxane A2 are unlikely to be major factors in the pathogenesis of the hepatorenal syndrome.\r"

Forty-one patients were randomized to portacaval anastomosis and 41 to sclerotherapy. After excluding dropouts, 34 patients were treated with portacaval anastomosis and 35 with sclerotherapy. The incidence of variceal rebleeding during follow-up (mean +/- SD, 20.6 +/- 14.2 months) was significantly higher in the sclerotherapy than in the portacaval groups, either considering the overall treated group or only patients completing sclerotherapy (40% and 25% vs. 2.9%; P = 0.0002 and P = 0.01, respectively). The 2-year probability of suffering from at least one episode of hepatic encephalopathy was significantly higher in patients submitted to portacaval anastomosis than in those treated with endoscopic sclerotherapy (40% vs. 12%; P = 0.04). However, disabling encephalopathy only appeared in 3 of 34 patients who underwent surgery (8.8%). Early and long-term mortality did not differ between the therapeutic groups; 2-year survival rates were 83% for portacaval anastomosis and 79% for sclerotherapy. It is concluded that portacaval anastomosis is more effective than endoscopic sclerotherapy in preventing variceal rebleeding in spite of the greater incidence of hepatic encephalopathy. The role of portacaval anastomosis in the elective treatment of variceal rebleeding should be reassessed.\r"

All 113 clones from 9 cases had a point mutation from guanine to adenine at nucleotide 83 in the precore region, which converted codon 28 for tryptophan (TGG) to a stop codon (TAG) and prohibited the synthesis and secretion of hepatitis B e antigen. Precore-region defects were not detected in any of 23 clones from the remaining 1 case. By contrast, precore-region defects were not found in any of 180 clones from 8 cases of acute hepatitis B without hepatic failure serving as controls. The source of infection was traceable in 3 cases. The same precore-region defect, along with the sequence identity of 435 nucleotides, was observed in clones from the case of a baby and his grandmother, who carried the virus and was implicated in the transmission, and also in clones from two pediatricians and the carrier patients they attended. These findings support the hypothesis that precore-defective mutants have stronger activity to induce fulminant hepatitis than nondefective viruses.\r"

  ".U": "91160894\r", 
  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a method of directly measuring ileal bile acid absorption efficiency during a single enterohepatic cycle (first-pass ileal clearance). This has become feasible for the first time because of the availability of the synthetic gamma-labeled bile acid 75Selena-homocholic acid-taurine (75SeHCAT). Together with the corresponding natural bile acid cholic acid-taurine (labeled with 14C), SeHCAT was infused distal to an occluding balloon situated beyond the ampulla of Vater in six healthy subjects. Completion of a single enterohepatic cycle was assessed by obtaining a plateau for 75SeHCAT activity proximal to the occluding balloon, which prevented further cycles. Unabsorbed 75SeHCAT was collected after total gut washout, which was administered distal to the occluding balloon. 75SeHCAT activity in the rectal effluent measured by gamma counter was compared with that of absorbed 75SeHCAT level measured by gamma camera and was used to calculate first-pass ileal clearance. This was very efficient (mean value, 96%) and showed very little variation in the six subjects studied (range, 95%-97%). A parallel time-activity course in hepatic bile for 14C and 75Se during a single enterohepatic cycle, together with a ratio of unity for 14C/75Se in samples obtained at different time intervals, suggests that 75SeHCAT is handled by the ileum like the natural bile acid cholic acid-taurine. Extrapolation of 75SeHCAT first-pass ileal clearance to that of the natural bile acid therefore seems justifiable. In a subsidiary experiment, ileal absorption efficiency per day for 75SeHCAT was also measured by scanning the gallbladder area on 5 successive days after the measurement of first-pass ileal clearance. In contrast with absorption efficiency per cycle, absorption efficiency per day varied widely (49%-86%), implying a possible wide variation in recycling frequency per day.\r"

The present study evaluated several quantitative cholescintigraphic variables to assess their time-related variability as well as their capability to detect delay of choledochoduodenal bile flow. Cholescintigraphy with 2,6-diethylphenylcarbahoylmethyl diacetic acid 99mTc was performed in 24 cholecystectomized patients with recurrent biliary-like pain, laboratory evidence of bile stasis, normal hepatocellular function tests, and no evidence of choledocholithiasis. The study was also performed in 26 asymptomatic cholecystectomized subjects and repeated at 2-week intervals during identical experimental conditions in 10 of them. Of the following quantitative cholescintigraphic variables investigated, (a) hepatic T peak, (b) 50% hepatic retention (T peak, 1/2), (c) percent hepatic retention at 30 minutes, (d) percent hepatic retention at 40 minutes, (e) vein-hepatic hilum transit time, (f) vein-duodenum transit time, and (g) hepatic hilum-duodenum transit time, only the hepatic hilum-duodenum transit time showed a statistically significant correlation between the duplicate studies. Only vein-duodenum transit time and hepatic hilum-duodenum transit time discriminated the symptomatic from the asymptomatic patients; of the two variables, however, hepatic hilum-duodenum transit time showed less intrasubject variability and no overlap between the two groups of patients. Hepatic hilum-duodenum transit time showed a positive linear correlation with the maximum diameter of the choledochus. It is concluded that in cholecystectomized patients, the hepatic hilum-duodenum transit time appears to detect a delay of bile flow into the intestine better than any other cholescintigraphic variable. However, in patients with a dilated common bile duct, this variable cannot discriminate bile flow delay due to increased choledochal capacity and/or obstruction of the sphincter of Oddi.\r"

  ".W": "During the 26th week of a first pregnancy, a 25-year-old woman presented with pruritus suggesting an intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. The pruritus, however, persisted despite the premature delivery of a normal newborn at the 35th week. Moreover, aspartate aminotransferase activity increased, reaching a maximum of 38 times normal level on the 17th day after the delivery. Thus, an acute fatty liver of pregnancy was suspected and confirmed by liver biopsy. This patient appeared to have both intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and acute fatty liver of pregnancy, an association not previously reported. It is suggested that intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy caused premature delivery, which in turn may have prevented the onset of severe maternal and fetal complications caused by acute fatty liver of pregnancy.\r"

The transplantation resulted in (a) normalization of platelet and leukocyte counts, (b) reduction of splenomegaly by 20% +/- 3% (P less than 0.02), (c) disappearance of ascites, and (d) diminution of esophageal varices in all patients. Intraoperatively, the mean portacaval pressure gradient decreased with 54% +/- 7% after recirculation of the graft (P less than 0.05). In conclusion, a functioning auxiliary heterotopic liver graft decompresses portal hypertension and reverses hypersplenism.\r"

In this study, ratios of both the serum alkaline phosphatase to total bilirubin and aspartate transaminase to alanine transaminase were constructed to evaluate their usefulness in differentiating fulminant hepatic failure caused by Wilson's disease (n = 6) from other etiologies (n = 43). An analysis of the data showed that cutoff values of less than 2.0 for the alkaline phosphatase-total bilirubin ratio and greater than 4.0 for the aspartate transaminase ratio were associated with a diagnosis of fulminant hepatic failure caused by Wilson's disease only (P less than 0.001). The alkaline phosphatase-total bilirubin ratio of less than 2.0 provided 100% sensitivity and specificity in identifying fulminant hepatic failure caused by Wilson's disease from other types of fulminant hepatic failure.\r"

  ".W": "Obstruction is a complication of many esophageal diseases, but the morphological changes occurring in the obstructed esophagus are poorly understood. We developed a model of esophageal obstruction in the American opossum, Didelphis virginiana. A nonconstricting band around the gastroesophageal junction led to esophageal distention and tortuosity in the weeks following its placement. Despite a marked increase of the esophageal circumference, the esophageal wall was not thinned, and the circular muscle layer had actually increased its thickness. This was due to an increase in the size of individual smooth muscle cells with proportional increases in the cell surface area and volume. The electron density of hypertrophic smooth muscle cells varied much more than that of normal esophageal smooth muscle cells. As cell size increased, the tissue became more compact and the size of the extracellular space decreased. Also, the extracellular space was filled by an amorphous electron-dense material. Additional changes in the structure of hypertrophic smooth muscle cells included prominent intermediate filaments in the vicinity of thick filaments. There was no difference in the structure of the hypertrophic smooth muscle at 4 weeks and at 8 weeks after placement of the band. The morphological features described here resemble those seen in human esophageal spasm and achalasia of humans and could affect esophageal smooth muscle function.\r"

  ".W": "The pathway by which peptide YY inhibits upper gastrointestinal motility is largely unknown and prompted this investigation. Muscle tension and [3H]acetylcholine release studies were performed on isolated muscle strips and slices obtained from the guinea pig stomach. Peptide YY [0.1-1000 nmol/L; concentration of half-maximal effect (EC50), 6 nmol/L] caused concentration-dependent relaxation of longitudinally oriented muscle strips that was unaffected by hexamethonium but was blocked by atropine and tetrodotoxin, suggesting that the peptide inhibited postganglionic cholinergic neurotransmission. In addition, peptide YY (1 mumol/L) reduced by 42% +/- 6% electrically stimulated muscle contractions that were blocked by atropine and tetrodotoxin, providing additional evidence that the peptide inhibits release of acetylcholine. Next, the effect of peptide YY on potassium-evoked release of [3H]acetylcholine and whether the peptide inhibits cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent release of acetylcholine were examined. Peptide YY (1 mumol/L) inhibited KCl (35 mmol/L)-evoked release of [3H]acetylcholine by 58% +/- 6%. The inhibitory action of peptide YY was unaffected by antagonists for dopamine-2, alpha-2, and opiate receptors that are known to mediate presynaptic inhibition. In addition, peptide YY reduced half-maximal forskolin and cholera toxin-evoked release of acetylcholine by 45% +/- 6% and 42% +/- 8%, respectively, suggesting that the peptide can inhibit cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent release of acetylcholine. This effect of peptide YY was reversed by pertussis toxin which prevents activation of the inhibitory guanine nucleotide binding protein coupled to adenylate cyclase. In summary, peptide YY inhibited basal and stimulated cholinergic neurotransmission in the guinea pig stomach. In addition, peptide YY antagonized cyclic adenosine monophosphate-mediated release of acetylcholine through a pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism.\r"

Nocturnal intragastric acidity was studied before (twice), during (on day 25), and after (every 3 days for 21 days) dosing with either 300 mg ranitidine at night or 40 mg omeprazole every morning. Three and six days after withdrawal of dosing with ranitidine, median integrated nocturnal intragastric acidity was increased significantly (17% and 14%, P = 0.01 and P = 0.05, respectively) compared with before dosing. Three days after withdrawal of dosing with omeprazole, median integrated nocturnal intragastric acidity was decreased significantly (-23%, P = 0.003). Compared with before dosing, no significant differences were seen in the ranitidine group between days 9 and 21 or the omeprazole group between days 6 and 21 after cessation of dosing. Fasting plasma gastrin concentration was measured on the morning of each study; compared with before treatment, the only significant elevations occurred on the last day of dosing with omeprazole (before, 4 pmol/L; during, 7 pmol/L). It is concluded that rebound intragastric hyperacidity after dosing with 300 mg ranitidine at night or sustained hypoacidity after dosing with 40 mg omeprazole every morning reflect transient disturbances of gastric function that are unlikely to be of clinical importance.\r"

Gastric damage was induced by intragastric instillation of indomethacin [5 mg/mL] for a period of 30 minutes. Histologically, this treatment resulted in extensive vascular congestion and leukocyte margination within the mucosa. Pretreatment with a monoclonal antibody [IB-4] directed against the common beta subunit of the CD11/CD18 adhesion glycoprotein complex significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced both the vasocongestion and the prevalence of leukocyte margination. Macroscopically, indomethacin treatment resulted in the formation of numerous hemorrhagic lesions in the corpus region of the stomach. Pretreatment with IB-4 reduced the extent of gastric hemorrhagic damage by approximately 85% (P less than 0.001). Damage in the group pretreated with IB-4 did not differ significantly from that in rabbits that did not receive indomethacin. In separate experiments, the dose of IB-4 used was shown to completely suppress the recruitment of granulocytes in response to two different agonists. These results support the hypothesis that leukocyte adherence to the vascular endothelium is an important event in the pathogenesis of ulceration induced by nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Leukocytes might contribute to ulceration by occluding microvessels, thereby reducing mucosal blood flow, and by releasing various mediators, proteases, and free radicals that can produce tissue necrosis.\r"

Endoscopic evaluation of the gastric mucosa was performed under general anesthesia in 29 colony-bred rhesus monkeys, and gastric pinch biopsy specimens were obtained from each animal. On a separate day, gastric emptying and acid output were determined using a 99mTc dilution technique. Biopsy samples were fixed for light microscopy (H&E, Gram, and Warthin-Starry stains) and for transmission electron microscopy. The presence of spiral bacteria and gastritis was assessed and rated on coded slides. In 8 of 29 monkeys, Helicobacter pylori-like organisms were observed in close proximity to the mucosal epithelial cells or in the lumen of the gastric pits. In 14 other monkeys, \"Gastrospirillum hominis\"-like organisms were observed in the mucus covering the surface of epithelial cells, in the lumina of the gastric glands, and overlying parietal cells. Gastritis was present in 8 of 8 animals positive for H. pylori-like organisms, in 2 of 14 animals positive for \"G. hominis\"-like organisms, and in none of the uninfected monkeys, and the mean gastritis index was significantly greater in animals positive for H. pylori-like organisms. Moreover, acid output was significantly higher in monkeys positive for \"G. hominis\"-like organisms than in controls or animals positive for H. pylori-like organisms. Gastric emptying was not significantly different in the three groups. In conclusion, (a) H. pylori-like, but not \"G. hominis\"-like, organisms cause gastritis while not modifying acid output; (b) \"G. hominis\"-like, but not H. pylori-like organisms, invade and on occasion damage parietal cells while apparently causing hyperchlorhydria; and (c) the rhesus monkey appears to be a good model for the study of gastric infection with spiral bacteria.\r"

Using a multilumen perfused catheter incorporating 3 pH microelectrodes, antral and duodenal pH and antropyloroduodenal pressure activity were recorded in 36 subjects (10 with healed duodenal ulceration, 11 with active duodenal ulceration, and 15 healthy volunteers) during fasting and after a radiolabeled solid test meal. Correct pH probe/catheter position was continuously verified by recording transmucosal potential difference across the pylorus. Patients with active and healed duodenal ulcer had similarly disordered gastroduodenal motility. The chief abnormalities consisted of an increase in postprandial duodenal retroperistalsis (healed duodenal ulceration, 12 +/- 1 events per hour; active duodenal ulceration, 12 +/- 1; control, 6 +/- 1; mean +/- SEM: healed and active duodenal ulceration vs. control, P = 0.004 and P = 0.03, respectively), a reduction in pressure waves sweeping aborally through the duodenum after the meal (healed duodenal ulceration, 22 +/- 4 events per hour; active duodenal ulceration, 23 +/- 3; control, 34 +/- 4: healed and active duodenal ulceration vs. control, P = 0.04 and P less than 0.05, respectively), and an increased incidence of atypical, complex forms of coordinated duodenal motor activity throughout the study (postprandial data; healed duodenal ulceration, 8 +/- 1 events per hour; active duodenal ulceration, 10 +/- 1; control, 4 +/- 1: healed and active duodenal ulceration vs. control, P = 0.02 and P less than 0.02, respectively). In addition, gastric emptying of the solid test meal was significantly delayed in healed, but not active, duodenal ulceration [half-emptying time, healed duodenal ulceration 185 minutes (117-235); active duodenal ulceration 102 minutes (80-200); control 107 minutes (78-130): healed duodenal ulceration vs. control, P less than 0.009]. Duodenal bulb pH was similar in controls and patients with active duodenal ulceration; however, bulb pH was less than 4 for a significantly greater period of time in healed duodenal ulceration compared with active ulcer patients, particularly after the meal. In conclusion, duodenal ulcer disease is associated with disturbed gastroduodenal motility, even when the ulcer is quiescent and when intraduodenal acidity is low. In healed duodenal ulceration, disturbed motility may promote ulcer relapse by impairing acid clearance from the bulb. However, in active ulceration other factors such as mucosal bicarbonate secretion may have a more influential role in determining intraduodenal pH.\r"

In the interdigestive state, 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor antagonists (0.01-0.1 mg/kg), if given during phase III contractions, instantly and dose-dependently inhibited the spontaneous and motilin-induced phase III contractions in the intact stomach and altered the duodenal phase III contractions to a pattern of continuous contractions, the contractile force which was 65% of the spontaneous phase III contractions in the duodenum and caused immediate caudad migration of phase III contractions along the small intestine. However, the spontaneous and motilin-induced phase III-like contractions in the denervated pouch were not affected at all by 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor antagonists. When 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor antagonists (0.1-3.0 mg/kg) were given during the phase I period, they did not directly stimulate gastrointestinal contractions. The cyclic fluctuation of the plasma motilin concentration with phase III activity in the stomach was also not influenced by 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor antagonists, but the next phase III contractions in the stomach were inhibited. During the digestive state, however, 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor antagonists (0.1-3.0 mg/kg) did not influence contractile activity in the gastrointestinal tract and in the vagally denervated fundic pouch. On the basis of recent pharmacological studies showing that the distribution of 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptors is recognized in the area postrema, peripheral neurons of vagal afferents, and the enteric nervous system, the results of the current study provide a basis for a hypothesis that 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor antagonists are most likely to block motilin-induced signals at 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptors on the vagal afferents. In conclusion, the present findings suggest the possible involvement of 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptors on vagal afferents especially in terms of endogenous release of acetylcholine in the control of interdigestive phase III activity in the stomach by motilin.\r"

Whether gastrointestinal endocrine cells within the mucosa are similarly affected is unknown. The present study was designed to determine the effects of food deprivation and refeeding on cholecystokinin (CCK) and somatostatin in the rat small intestine. RNA was prepared from the duodenum, and peptide and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of CCK, somatostatin, and beta-actin were analyzed by hybridization with complementary DNA probes. During food deprivation for up to 5 days, plasma CCK levels decreased rapidly, followed by a decline in duodenal CCK mRNA levels and a more gradual decrease in mucosal CCK peptide concentrations. After 3 days of fasting, one group of rats was refed. After only 1 day of refeeding, all parameters (levels of plasma CCK, duodenal CCK mRNA, and duodenal CCK peptide) were restored to control levels. The reduction in CCK mRNA levels seen with fasting was specific, because food deprivation and refeeding produced no changes in either duodenal somatostatin concentrations or mRNA levels of somatostatin and beta-actin. These findings provide initial evidence that food deprivation inhibits duodenal CCK mRNA levels but does not affect duodenal somatostatin.\r"

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were made portal hypertensive by stenosis of the portal vein. Ten to twelve days after the induction of chronic portal hypertension, the responsiveness of the small intestinal circulation to cumulative doses of vasopressin was evaluated using an isolated pump-perfused small intestinal preparation. The ED50 for maximal vasoconstriction was increased twofold in portal hypertensive rats compared with control rats. To determine if the impaired responsiveness to arginine vasopressin was related to the hyperglucagonemia of chronic portal hypertension, plasma glucagon levels were elevated in normal rats to levels previously measured in portal hypertensive rats (i.e. approximately 450 pg/mL), and the dose response studies were repeated. Glucagon significantly attenuated the responsiveness of the intestinal vasculature to vasopressin. Equipotent doses of nitroprusside also attenuated intestinal vascular responsiveness to vasopressin. The results indicate that there is a reduced vascular sensitivity to vasopressin in the intestine of portal hypertensive animals and suggest that elevations in circulating vasodilators in portal hypertensive conditions may partially explain this altered vascular responsiveness.\r"

  ".W": "The regulation of anaphylaxis-mediated fluid secretion by the small intestine was examined in rats immunized by infection with Trichinella spiralis and reinfected by intraduodenal injection with L1 larvae. Net fluid secretion, which was measured as the volume of fluid present in the intestine 30 minutes after the challenge infection, was significantly greater in both actively and passively immunized rats than in nonimmune rats. The amount of fluid recovered from the immune host was equivalent to that secreted in response to 50 micrograms/kg of prostaglandin E2 or 250 micrograms/kg of cholera toxin. Worm-induced fluid secretion in immune hosts was reduced by treatment with diphenhydramine and inhibited by the dual application of diphenhydramine and indomethacin. Indomethacin alone had no effect despite inhibiting mucosal prostaglandin synthesis. Fluid secretion was unaltered by prior treatment of immune rats with a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, L-651,392, and only slightly reduced when L-651,392 was used in combination with indomethacin. After a challenge infection, more histamine was released into intestinal loops of immune rats than those of nonimmune rats. Prechallenge treatment of immune rats with indomethacin caused a twofold increase in histamine release. In summary, anaphylaxis-induced fluid secretion in the small intestine is mediated largely by histamine and cyclooxygenase products. This secretion can be lowered by treatment with diphenhydramine and further reduced by diphenhydramine in combination with indomethacin. The paradoxical effects of indomethacin when used alone and in combination with diphenhydramine are explained by the downregulation of histamine release by products of the cyclooxygenase pathway.\r"

Rats previously infected with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis received a single IP injection of 1 mg dexamethasone. Three hours later, one third of mucosal mast cells demonstrated minor granular changes (fusion or peripheral clear zones) by electron microscopy. At 7 hours, by light microscopy, the majority of mucosal mast cells appeared abnormal with clustering of granules. By electron microscopy, 151 of 233 (65%) mucosal mast cells had been engulfed by enlarged macrophages and were in various stages of degeneration inside large phagosomes. By 24 hours, the number of mucosal mast cells had decreased to less than 10% of the initial number with parallel decreases in tissue rat mast cell protease II and histamine levels. Serum levels of rat mast cell protease II did not increase, and intestinal morphology was invariably normal with no evidence of inflammatory changes up to and including 24 hours. Observations were similar in uninfected animals. In contrast, in rats undergoing antigen-induced anaphylaxis, a significant elevation of serum rat mast cell protease II level was evident at 3 and 7 hours, and macrophage engulfment of mucosal mast cells was never seen, although tissue edema, enterocyte loss, and hemorrhage were observed. It is concluded that dexamethasone treatment results in macrophage engulfment and destruction of mucosal mast cells that occurs without granular mediator release and local inflammatory effects.\r"

  ".U": "91160927\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of IV administration of Escherichia coli endotoxin on intestinal myoelectric activity was investigated in conscious fasted rats chronically implanted with nichrome electrodes in the duodenojejunum. These effects were compared with those of platelet-activating factor and were evaluated in animals pretreated with a specific platelet-activating factor antagonist, BN 52021, indomethacin, a selective prostaglandin E2 antagonist, SC 19220, and several free radical scavengers. Intravenous administration of endotoxin (E. coli S.O111:B4) at a dose of 50 micrograms/kg suppressed the migrating myoelectric complexes, which were replaced by continuous rhythmic clusters of rapidly propagated spike bursts for 114.7 +/- 19.9 minutes. Intraperitoneal platelet-activating factor (25 micrograms/kg) also inhibited the migrating myoelectric complex pattern for 146.1 +/- 24.1 minutes. Previous IV administration of BN 52021 (50 mg/kg-1) abolished the motor alterations induced by platelet-activating factor and significantly reduced to 43.1 +/- 12.2 minutes those induced by endotoxin (P less than 0.01). Indomethacin (10 mg/kg IP), injected before endotoxin or platelet-activating factor, also significantly reduced the duration of migrating myoelectric complex inhibition to 45.6 +/- 7.8 and 47.7 +/- 8.3 minutes, respectively (P less than 0.01). SC 19220 significantly reduced the effects of platelet-activating factor from 151.8 +/- 26.4 to 67.4 +/- 14.7 min (P less than 0.01). Superoxide dismutase (15,000 U/kg IV) injected before either endotoxin or platelet-activating factor shortened the migrating myoelectric complex inhibition to 45.7 +/- 9.9 and 72.9 +/- 10.4 minutes, respectively (P less than 0.01). Allopurinol and dimethylsulfoxide administered orally at 50 mg/kg 1 hour before endotoxin reduced the migrating myoelectric complex inhibition to 42.5 +/- 6.5 and 38.2 +/- 6.4 minutes, respectively (P less than 0.01). They also reduced platelet-activating factor-induced intestinal myoelectric alterations to 68.5 +/- 10.6 and 31.7 +/- 6.1 minutes, respectively (P less than 0.01). It is concluded that endogenous release of platelet-activating factor is partly responsible for the intestinal motor alterations induced by endotoxin, these effects being also mediated through the release of prostaglandins and free radicals. However, prostaglandins, as well as free radicals, appear to be partly involved in the platelet-activating factor-induced action of E. coli endotoxin on intestinal motility.\r"

Colitis was induced in the entire colon by luminal perfusion of acetic acid. The dogs exhibited urgency and diarrhea with mucus and blood during colitis. The mucosa was diffusely erythematous and friable and there were scattered ulcerations over the mucosal surface. The motor activity of the colon changed in several ways during colitis: (a) the total duration per hour and the mean duration of contractile states decreased significantly; (b) the cycle length of colonic migrating motor complexes was significantly prolonged, and the nonmigrating motor complexes were almost completely absent; and (d) the incidence of giant migrating contractions increased significantly. About half of the giant migrating contractions were followed by defecation. The remaining expelled mucus or gas. Sometimes, a migrating motor complex in the colon was also followed by defecation; this was never observed in the normal state. The motor activity of the colon was still decreased and the cycle length prolonged 21 days after induction of colitis. However, the dogs were asymptomatic at this time and the mucosa looked normal at colonoscopy. The incidence of giant migrating contractions was also normal at this time. It was concluded that the dog is a good model for the study of colitis because of the similarity of symptoms with human ulcerative colitis. The phasic contractions of the colon decreases during colitis but the incidence of giant migrating contractions is increased. The diarrhea in colitis may primarily be due to the large number of giant migrating contractions in the middle and the distal colon.\r"

Intact fasted and fed rats showed an increase of 82.3% and 67.2%, respectively, in colonic spike-burst frequency when placed for 30 minutes in a box in which they had previously received electrical shocks in their feet. Intracerebroventricular administration of corticotropin-releasing factor (0.5 micrograms/kg) mimicked the effects of mental stress and increased cecocolonic spike-burst frequency by 75.8%. The specific corticotropin-releasing factor receptor antagonist alpha-helical CRF9-41 given intracerebroventricularly (5 micrograms/kg) prevented both the effects of mental stress and corticotropin-releasing factor (0.5 micrograms/kg intracerebroventricularly) on colonic spike-burst frequency. In contrast, diazepam (0.5 mg/kg IM) suppressed colonic hypermotility induced by mental stress but not that resulting from intracerebroventricular injection of corticotropin-releasing factor (0.5 micrograms/kg). Increased colonic spike-burst frequency induced either by stress or by central administration of corticotropin-releasing factor was not prevented by hypophysectomy. It was concluded that mental stress increases the frequency of cecocolonic spike-burst activity and that these effects are related to the central release of corticotropin-releasing factor because they are blocked by a corticotropin-releasing factor antagonist and reproduced by intracerebroventricular administration of corticotropin-releasing factor. Moreover, mental stress-induced colonic motor alterations are mediated by the autonomic nervous system rather than by the hypothalamopituitary axis because they are not abolished by hypophysectomy.\r"

Significant correlations were noted between growth velocity and type I procollagen (r = 0.65; P less than 0.001) and type III procollagen concentrations (r = 0.64; P less than 0.001). Although the serum concentration of type I procollagen was generally about 15 times greater than that of type III, the respective serum concentrations were highly correlated (r = 0.66; P less than 0.001) at all growth velocities. The use of daily corticosteroid therapy was associated with significantly lower concentrations of both propeptides (P less than 0.01) than was alternate-day or no corticosteroid therapy, respectively. Children with growth arrest (0.0 cm/mo) had type I and type III procollagen concentrations similar to those found in adults. These observations indicate that the serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides reflect growth activity in children with inflammatory bowel disease and suggest that routine measurement of collagen propeptides may have clinical value in monitoring normal and abnormal growth. The data suggest that the measurement of one propeptide does not offer an advantage over the other.\r"

Light microscopy showed foci of mucosal necrosis that contained chronic inflammatory cells and degenerating and necrotic epithelial cells with amphophilic nuclear inclusions. By transmission electron microscopy, hexagonal viral particles characteristic of adenovirus were identified within the inclusions. Only 1 patient was concomitantly infected by a second potential enteric pathogen. It was concluded that adenovirus, an uncommon enteric pathogen in immunocompetent adults, causes intestinal pathology and may be associated with diarrheal illness in persons with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Bombesin and its mammalian homologue, gastrin-releasing peptide, stimulate smooth muscle contraction and may promote the growth of gastrointestinal tissues. Isometric contraction of strips from circular muscle of the gastric fundus and longitudinal muscle of the distal colon were used to compare changes in the response to bombesin in newborn and weanling rabbits. There was an age-related qualitative change in gastric muscle from biphasic contractions including phasic and tonic components in the newborn to phasic contractions alone in the weanling. The colon contractions were tonic at both ages. In both tissues there was an age-related fivefold increase in stress in response to maximally effective concentrations of bethanechol (P less than 0.05). In contrast, in the stomach age-related decreases in the response to maximally effective concentrations of bombesin were observed, from 2930 +/- 179 mN/cm2 (98% of the maximal response to bethanechol) in the newborn to 565 +/- 81 mN/cm2 (4% of the maximal response to bethanechol) in the weanling (P less than 0.005). In the colon, a twofold increase in response to bombesin was observed, from 446 +/- 59 mN/cm2 (82% of the response to bethanechol) in the newborn to 862 +/- 11 mN/cm2 (29% of the response to bethanechol) in the weanling (P less than 0.05). No age-related changes were observed in the potency of bombesin in either tissue. Neither atropine nor tetrodotoxin altered the contractions in either tissue, suggesting that bombesin interacted directly with myocytes. There was three times as much bombesinlike immunoreactivity in the stomach compared with the colon, but no age-related changes in either tissue. In summary, by the age of weanling the stomach lost the tonic component of contraction and 80% of the efficacy of bombesin-stimulated phasic contraction that had been present in the newborn. The loss of efficacy, absolute in the stomach and relative to bethanechol in the colon, suggest that bombesin may be most important in stimulating motility in the neonatal period.\r"

It is hypothesized that E. histolytica releases a mucus secretagogue; this was studied in a rat colonic loop model. In colonic loops exposed to live amebae, mucus secretion was quantitated by release of acid-precipitable [3H]glucosamine-labeled luminal glycoprotein and by specific immunoassay. Mucus secretion increased in dose-dependent fashion in response to greater than or equal to 1 X 10(5) trophozoites; cholera toxin (20 micrograms per loop), a known mucus secretagogue, elicited a similar response. Thin-section histological analysis of amebae and cholera toxin-exposed loops showed increased mucus release and streaming from mucosal goblet cells with cellular cavitation compared with control loops. Sepharose-4B chromatography of amebae and cholera toxin-stimulated glycoproteins demonstrated secretion of mucins and an 80%-90% increase in low-molecular-weight proteins. E. histolytica trophozoites and cholera toxin enhanced the secretion of preformed and newly synthesized mucin glycoproteins and stimulated colonic glycoprotein synthesis. The level of mucus secretion elicited by axenic E. histolytica strains correlated with their virulence in vivo and in vitro. The amebic secretagogue was released into the culture medium and was heat stable. Mucus secretagogue activity of E. histolytica may contribute to depletion or alteration of the protective mucus blanket, facilitating pathogenesis of invasive amebiasis.\r"

These surveys of office-based physicians allow national estimates of various aspects of ambulatory care. The overall rate of visits with the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome in 1980-1981 and 1985 were 10.6 per thousand U.S. population. Women had 2.4 times the rate of visits by men and rates rose in both sexes until middle-age. Irritable bowel syndrome was the leading digestive disease diagnosis among gastroenterologists but only the seventh leading diagnosis among all physicians. Gastrointestinal symptoms, association with mental disorders, prescriptions, and disposition were also examined in patients with visits for irritable bowel syndrome. Among records with digestive tract symptoms and a first listed diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome, stomach or abdominal pain was listed on only about one half of records and disorders of bowel function were listed on fewer than 40%. In 1975 and 1985, irritable bowel syndrome was noted approximately twice as often as other digestive diseases at visits with mental disorder symptoms and diagnosis, although mental disorder symptoms and diagnoses were noted at fewer than 15% of visits with irritable bowel syndrome. Medications were prescribed at approximately 75% of visits for irritable bowel syndrome; the most common were gastrointestinal medications followed by combination gastrointestinal-psychoactive medications. Subsequent appointments were scheduled following at least 50% of the visits of patients with irritable bowel syndrome.\r"

While economic slumps lead many executives to batten down the hatches and shift into a defensive management mode, experts say the real solution for hospitals lies in innovative, proactive management. In the economically battered Northeast, this strategy is working well for a pediatric hospital in Philadelphia and a large New York City medical center. But it's also working at a broad range of hospitals across the country. What do these very diverse institutions have in common? While each is moving forward to develop strategies and programs suited to its circumstances, all eschew the bunker mentality that comes to mind in tough times. In the words of one CEO, \"You go out, decide what has to happen, and then make it happen--despite the fact that there are 8,000 reasons why it shouldn't happen.\"\r"

No substantial differences for either the right or left side of stimulation, recording electrode, or subject sex were obtained for any of the individual potential amplitudes or latencies. The same procedures were applied to 10 patients who had been treated with retrogasserian glycerol injections for trigeminal neuralgia. Trigeminal evoked potentials were elicited in all patients, although the quality of the individual wave forms was more variable than that observed for the normal subjects. Comparison of the treated with the unaffected face side in the patients demonstrated significantly smaller N2-P2 amplitudes and longer N2 latencies for the affected face side. The results suggest that these procedures produce reliable evoked potential measures of trigeminal nerve function noninvasively which can provide an objective index of treatment efficacy.\r"

The patients were followed at monthly intervals for 12 weeks, with 25 dropping out (3 on naproxen sodium, and 2 each on pizotyline and placebo because of \"side effects;\" the remaining 18 because of noncompliance or reasons unrelated to therapy). Approximately 25% of patients in each of the 3 groups complained of side effects. Statistical analysis showed that both naproxen sodium and pizotyline were better than placebo, and of overall equivalent (i.e. equal) efficacy in the prophylaxis of migraine. In some respects, naproxen sodium was slightly more effective than pizotyline in the first month of treatment.\r"

The HSLC is a 33 item scale designed specifically for recurrent headache sufferers. It assesses the individual's perceptions that headache problems and headache relief are determined primarily by: the individual's behavior (Internal factors), Health Care Professionals, or Chance factors. The psychometric properties of the HSLC were satisfactory. Among our findings were that: (1) the belief that headache problems and relief are determined by chance factors was associated with higher levels of depression, physical complaints, reliance on maladaptive pain coping strategies (p less than .001), and greater headache-related disability (p less than .01); (2) the belief that headache problems and relief are influenced primarily by the ministrations of health care professionals was associated with higher levels of medication use (p less than .01) and preference for medical treatment (p less than .001); and (3) the belief that headache problems are determined by the individual's responses and behaviors was associated with a preference for self-regulation treatment (p less than .01). These findings suggest adaptation to headache problems is influenced not only by the frequency and severity of the headache episodes, but by locus of control beliefs. The assessment of locus of control beliefs may provide useful information not typically obtained from standard medical evaluations.\r"

DNA content, an index of proliferation, was significantly increased at a strain of 0.04 per cent applied for fifteen minutes and for twenty-four and forty-eight hours. DNA content was not increased at the other amplitudes of strain that were evaluated, nor was it increased after prolonged mechanical stimulation for forty-eight hours or longer. Synthesis of collagen, non-collagenous protein, and proteoglycan, as well as activity of alkaline phosphatase, all indicators of macromolecular synthesis, were significantly decreased at a strain of 0.04 per cent applied for fifteen minutes and for twenty-four, forty-eight, and seventy-two hours. Macromolecular synthesis was not affected by the other amplitudes of strain that were evaluated in this study. At a strain of 0.04 per cent, prostaglandin E2 content was significantly increased after five, fifteen, and thirty minutes of mechanical stimulation, whereas net cAMP content did not change significantly. This suggests that the described cellular events (increased proliferation and decreased macromolecular synthesis) that occur secondary to mechanical strain are mediated, at least in part, by prostaglandin E2.\r"

All fractures were nailed by a closed technique after any intercondylar extension of the fracture had been managed by reduction and stabilization with percutaneous lag-screws. Patients who had an isolated condylar fracture or a severely comminuted intercondylar fracture were treated with other types of implants. There were thirty extra-articular (type-A) fractures and seven intra-articular (type-C1 and type-C2) fractures. Postoperatively, early mobilization exercises and weight-bearing were begun. At an average duration of follow-up of 20.5 months (range, fifteen to twenty-six months), all thirty-seven fractures had healed. There were no malunions of either the supracondylar or the intercondylar fractures. Complications were infrequent and included chronic irritation from the distal screws in three patients and delayed union in one; the latter healed with two centimeters of shortening after bone-grafting. There were no infections. The functional results were assessed with the modified knee-rating system of The Hospital for Special Surgery. Thirteen knees (35 per cent) had an excellent result; twenty-two (59 per cent), a good result; and two (5 per cent), a fair result. The results correlated with the age of the patient and the presence of an intra-articular fracture. We concluded that closed interlocking intramedullary nailing is an excellent technique for both supracondylar and simple intercondylar fractures in which closed reduction and percutaneous fixation of the articular fracture is possible.\r"

Additional stabilization with a medial plate and a bone graft from the iliac crest was applied in all nine patients: in six, at the time of the index operation and in the remaining three, after the open wound and open fracture were considered clean. At an average duration of follow-up of twenty-six months (range, twenty-one to thirty-four months), all of the fractures had healed. Evaluation of the functional outcome revealed five good and four fair results. In three patients, less than 90 degrees of flexion of the knee was present and in six, the arc of flexion was limited to between 90 and 100 degrees.

The surface area of contact decreased with increased size of the posterior malleolar fragment. However, the documented changes were smaller than expected on the basis of the findings of Ramsey and Hamilton; they reported a 42 per cent reduction in contact area with only a one-millimeter lateral shift of the talus, which clinically would be associated with a similar one-millimeter shift of the distal tibial fragment. In addition, clinical experience has shown a high rate of post-traumatic degenerative arthritis associated with an inadequately reduced one-half-size posterior fragment. There were considerable changes in the load-distribution patterns, with increased confluence and concentration of loads as the size of the fragment was increased. In plantar flexion, many specimens had three separate areas of contact between the tibia and the talus. With increased size of the posterior fragment, the three areas of contact always joined to become one. Similarly, for all positions of the ankle, increased size of the posterior fragment caused decreases in the contact area. The maximum loss of contact area was 35 per cent for specimens with one-half-size fractures that were tested in the neutral position.\r"

  ".U": "91161642\r", 
  ".W": "Thirty-seven patients who had enlargement of the spinal canal anteriorly and stabilization of the spine for cervical spondylotic myelopathy were followed for an average of forty-nine months (range, twenty-eight to seventy months). Myelography and computed tomographic myelography were performed preoperatively on all patients to determine the location and features of the areas of decompression. The canal was enlarged by discectomy; by subtotal corpectomy and removal of the anteromedial parts of the pedicles; or by removal of osteophytes or of the posterior longitudinal ligament, or both. Partial corpectomy and interbody arthrodesis was performed in nine patients; subtotal corpectomy, including removal of the posterior parts of the vertebral bodies and of the posterior longitudinal ligament, and strut bone-grafting, in fifteen patients; and subtotal corpectomy, with detachment of the remaining thin posterior parts of the vertebral bodies and of the posterior longitudinal ligament, and strut bone-grafting, in thirteen patients. Postoperatively, radiographic examinations, including myelography and computed tomographic myelography, were performed for thirty-six patients and magnetic resonance imaging, for twenty-eight. A satisfactory neurological result was obtained in twenty-nine patients. Atrophy of the spinal cord, as seen on preoperative computed-tomographic myelograms, was predictive of an unsatisfactory result of the decompression, as was weakness of the peroneal muscles. All but one of the thirty-seven patients had improved walking ability at the most recent follow-up examination: seventeen patients improved by 1 point; fourteen, by 2 points; four, by 3 points; and one, by 4 points. The remaining patient reverted to the preoperative status after an initial improvement. The ability to walk at the interim examinations was compared with that at the most recent examination; three patients had continuing improvement, while three others had deterioration. The main cause of deterioration was new spondylotic changes associated with stenosis of the spinal canal, occurring at the level of the disc just cephalad to the fused levels. We concluded that anterior decompression followed by a secure arthrodesis should be an extensive procedure for patients who have cervical spondylotic myelopathy, as determined preoperatively from a myelogram or computed tomographic myelogram. Excision of the vertebral bodies should also be wide and should include the anteromedial parts of the pedicles. The third or fourth cervical vertebra should be included in the arthrodesis prophylactically in patients who have stenosis of the spinal canal when either of these vertebrae is adjacent to the level of fusion.\r"

The study was conducted on both knees of sixty patients who had a ruptured anterior-cruciate ligament in one knee, as well as in ten control subjects. The radiographic technique included the examination of a true lateral radiograph, made while the knee was in full extension and the quadriceps was maximally contracted, with a 66.7-newton downward force produced by a 6.8-kilogram weight suspended from the ankle. As demonstrated by both techniques, the maximum difference between the displacements of the right and left knees in the control subjects was 2.5 millimeters and the mean difference between the displacements in the two knees in the patients was 7.5 millimeters. In fourteen of the sixty knees in which the ligament was ruptured, the injury was acute. The forward translation of the medial side in these fourteen knees was compared with that in the forty-six knees in which the injury was chronic. The mean difference in the displacement of the medial side in the right and left knees was 3.5 millimeters in the fourteen patients who had an acute injury and 5.0 millimeters in the forty-six patients who had a chronic injury. Thirteen of the sixty patients had disruption of the posteromedial corner of the injured knee, and the translation of the medial side in these knees was significantly increased compared with that in the intact knees of the same patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Healing of the anterior cruciate ligament was studied in 170 male rabbits. One group included immature animals that had open epiphyses, and a second group consisted of only mature animals. In one knee of each animal, the anterior cruciate ligament was transected either completely or partially, and in the contralateral knee a sham operation was carried out. Mechanical testing and histological studies of the ligaments were done immediately postoperatively and at two weeks, six weeks, three months, and one year. As we expected, there was no regeneration after complete transection of the anterior cruciate ligament, and all of the animals in which this procedure was done had severe osteoarthrosis of the joint at three months. Postoperatively, the partially sectioned ligaments exhibited one-third of the strength of the ligaments on the side on which the sham operation had been done in the immature animals and one-fourth of the strength of the ligaments on the side on which the sham operation had been done in the mature animals. Subsequently, there was secondary complete rupture of 20 per cent of the partially sectioned ligaments. The remaining 80 per cent of the partially sectioned ligaments were clearly weaker two weeks after the operation than immediately postoperatively, but this was also true on the side on which the sham operation had been done. At six weeks, the initial postoperative strength of the partially sectioned ligaments had been regained. At one year, the ligaments of the immature animals were two-thirds as strong as those on the contralateral side, and those of the mature animals were three-fourths as strong as those on the contralateral side. The ligaments were markedly elongated, especially in the mature animals. At three months, stiffness of the ligaments returned to normal. Histologically, the defect was filled with tissue that was still somewhat different from normal ligamentous tissue.\r"

  ".U": "91161645\r", 
  ".W": "The cases of twenty-nine consecutive patients (thirty wrists) who had radial shortening for the treatment of stages I through IIIB Kienbock disease were reviewed to assess the results of this procedure. Thirteen patients (45 per cent) had a history of trauma, and all thirty wrists had a negative ulnar variance (average, 2.8 millimeters) on radiographs. All wrists were re-examined after an average follow-up of 3.8 years (minimum, two years). At that time, the pain had decreased in 87 per cent of the wrists. Extension of the wrist had improved an average of 32 per cent; flexion, 27 per cent; radial deviation, 30 per cent; ulnar deviation, 41 per cent; and grip strength on the affected side, 49 per cent. Analysis of the radiographs by computer digitization showed no significant changes in the amount of collapse of the lunate at the latest follow-up. In two wrists, there were complications at follow-up (excessive shortening of the radius and non-union of the radial osteotomy). Radial shortening is an effective treatment for Kienbock disease in wrists that do not have degenerative changes in adjacent carpal joints. Pain, range of motion, and strength can be expected to improve, but the radiographic appearance of the lunate changes little, if any.\r"

Follow-up of eighteen patients (twenty-one elbows) revealed that posterior displacement did not usually cause serious functional impairment except for loss of rotation of the forearm. The least common presentation, Type-I subluxation, caused pain and clicking and was associated with late degenerative arthritis. Cosmetic deformity due to prominence of the radial head was also a cosmetic problem, particularly with Type-III dislocation.\r"

When all four of these favorable variables were present (without regard for radiographic changes and non-disabling symptoms), the probability of an implant being in situ was 97 per cent at both five and ten years.\r"

All patients were followed until closure of the affected proximal femoral physis. We divided the patients into three groups, according to the degree of vascular insufficiency: patients who had mild vascular insufficiency of the hip, which had little effect on growth; those who had moderate vascular insufficiency, which produces partial arrest of growth; and those who had severe vascular insufficiency, which causes complete arrest of growth. Good correlation was found between the initial degree of vascular insufficiency and the radiographic results at the most recent follow-up. The radiographic signs that were used to predict the extent of physeal involvement were a crescent-shaped epiphysis, medial bowing of the femoral neck (a shorter and more concave curve between the lesser trochanter and the proximal femoral metaphysis [the lateral portion of the Shenton line]), lateral tilting of the capital epiphysis, and premature physeal closure. Signs that were diagnostic of existing physeal involvement were elevation of the greater trochanter and shortening of the affected extremity. The presence and severity of these signs correlated well with the degree of vascular insufficiency. Medial bowing was the most reliable prognostic factor for the determination of the fate of the hip joint at maturity.\r"

The patients in Group I (control group) received hyperbaric 1 per cent tetracaine with epinephrine as the subarachnoid spinal anesthetic; the patients in Group II (morphine group), hyperbaric 1 per cent tetracaine with epinephrine and a single subarachnoid dose of Duramorph (morphine sulphate), 0.5 milligram; and those in Group III (Dilaudid group), hyperbaric 1 per cent tetracaine with epinephrine and a single subarachnoid dose of Dilaudid (hydromorphone hydrochloride), 0.002 milligram per kilogram of body weight. During the first twenty-four hours after the operation, the patients in Group II and Group III had significantly less pain compared with those in Group I. This was shown by the use of a visual linear-analog pain scale (p less than 0.05), the patients' ratings of the quality of relief of pain (p less than 0.02), and comparative measurements of the pain-altering medications that were used (p less than 0.05). The patients in Group II and Group III did not have any more complications or side effects than those in Group I. There was no significant difference in the quality and duration of analgesia between Group II and Group III.\r"

One patient died from concomitant cerebral injury and one had a fat-embolism syndrome. Thirty patients (thirty-two limbs) had an average follow-up of 5.1 years (range, one to fourteen years). Nineteen patients who had an average follow-up of 6.8 years were available for personal examination and roentgenography. Age was found to be the most important variable as related to clinical course. Of the fifteen patients who were less than ten years old, three had an early complication; the average time to full, unsupported weight-bearing was thirteen weeks; and the average combined femoral and tibial overgrowth was 1.8 centimeters. Of the fifteen children who were more than ten years old, eight had an early complication; the average time to full, unsupported weight-bearing was twenty weeks; and there was variable femoral and tibial growth. The juxta-articular pattern of fracture was associated with the highest incidence of early and late problems. Most of the children who were younger than ten years were treated successfully with closed methods, but limb-length discrepancy developed. The children who were older than ten years were treated successfully with reduction and fixation of the femoral fracture, but had a high rate of complications. There was a high incidence of concomitant injuries to the ligaments of the knee, resulting in long-term dysfunction of the extremity. Of the nineteen patients who had long-term follow-up, only seven had normal function without major problems. The remainder had a compromised result due to limb-length discrepancy, angular deformity, or instability of the knee, particularly ligamentous instability.\r"

  ".W": "Recurrent posterolateral rotatory instability of the elbow is an apparently undescribed clinical condition that is difficult to diagnose. We treated five patients, ranging in age from five to forty years, who had such a lesion and in whom the instability could be demonstrated only by what we call the posterolateral rotatory-instability test. This test involves supination of the forearm and application of a valgus moment and an axial compression force to the elbow while it is flexed from full extension. The elbow is reduced in full extension and must be subluxated as it is flexed in order to obtain a positive test result (a sudden reduction of the subluxation). Flexion of more than about 40 degrees produces a sudden palpable and visible reduction of the radiohumeral joint. The elbow does not subluxate without provocation. The cause for this condition, we think, is laxity of the ulnar part of the lateral collateral ligament, which allows a transient rotatory subluxation of the ulnohumeral joint and a secondary dislocation of the radiohumeral joint. The annular ligament remains intact, so the radio-ulnar joint does not dislocate. Operative repair of the lax ulnar part of the lateral collateral ligament eliminated the posterolateral rotatory instability, as revealed intraoperatively in our five patients.\r"

The cases of three patients who had those findings are presented; in all three, the differential diagnosis between the vascular and skeletal injuries was difficult.

Mastocytosis in these age groups differs in many respects from mastocytosis that has its onset in adulthood. The typical presentation of pediatric-onset mastocytosis consists of cutaneous manifestations: either a solitary mastocytoma, urticaria pigmentosa, or, less commonly, diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis. Particularly in infants, bullous eruptions may occur. Mastocytosis in infants and children may involve internal organs, including the bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract, although such manifestations appear to be less common in children than in adults. Plasma histamine levels may be elevated in pediatric-onset mastocytosis. Treatment usually involves the use of H1 and H2 antihistamines to control itching and to control the hypersecretion of gastric acid that may occur. The prognosis for children with mast cell disease is variable; approximately half of the children with urticaria pigmentosa may experience resolution of lesions and symptoms by adolescence.\r"

  ".W": "Systemic mastocytosis is characterized by an abnormal proliferation of tissue mast cells. Symptoms of mastocytosis are primarily attributed to the release of mast cell mediators during episodes of systemic activation of the excessive numbers of mast cells. Thus, biochemical evidence for the release of increased quantities of mast cell secretory products can suggest or confirm, depending on the clinical situation, a diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis. A major advantage of the biochemical approach to the diagnosis of systemic mast cell disease is that it has allowed the recognition of a class of patients in whom episodes of systemic mastocytes activation can be unequivocally documented biochemically but in whom clear-cut evidence of abnormal mast cell proliferation is lacking by current histologic criteria. Although the release of increased quantities of mast cell mediators can be demonstrated during episodes of mast cell activation in such patients, mediator levels are usually normal at quiescent times. By contrast, patients with proliferative mast cell disease (mastocytosis) usually exhibit chronic overproduction of mast cell mediators. Mast cell secretory products that can be measured in an attempt to obtain biochemical evidence of systemic mast cell activation include histamine, prostaglandin D2, tryptase, and heparin. The analytical approaches to assessing release of those individual mast cell products are evaluated. In general, the diagnosis and investigation of patients with systemic mast cell activation can best be accomplished by concerted use of histologic examination of key tissues together with analysis of chemical markers of the mast cell.\r"

Mastocytosis is variable in respect to the organ systems involved, clinical manifestations, and association with hematologic diseases. This has suggested the need for an improved classification scheme to allow assessment of prognosis and therapy. The heterogeneity of the disease patterns in mastocytosis strongly suggests that more than one biologic lesion may occur in the developmental sequence that leads to placement of mature mast cells in tissues.\r"

Current literature indicates that granules containing discrete scrolls (scroll-rich morphology) are frequent in MC from bowel mucosa and lung, locations where the majority of MC show only tryptase immunoreactivity (MCT). In contrast, most MC from skin, breast parenchyma, axillary lymph nodes, and bowel submucosa are characterized by scroll-poor morphology (that is, granules are rimmed by incomplete scrolls forming parallel lamellae and containing central, amorphous granular material or grating/lattice-like structures) and show both tryptase and chymase immunoreactivity (MCTC). MC having granules with both scroll-rich and scroll-poor features can occur in all tissue sites, and an occasional MC, especially in lung and bowel, may show only chymase immunoreactivity (MCC). Chymase immunoreactivity in MC also is closely associated with avidin binding and carboxypeptidase reactivity. We conclude that there is ultrastructural and immunophenotypic diversity among normal human MC, although certain forms predominate in specific tissue environments. In skin, breast tissue, axillary lymph nodes, and bowel submucosa MC tend to have scroll-poor granules and stain for avidin, chymase, tryptase, and carboxypeptidase, whereas, in lung and bowel mucosa MC granules tend to be scroll-rich and stain only for tryptase with currently available reagents.\r"

  ".U": "91161988\r", 
  ".W": "Bone marrow transplantation is employed in the treatment of a number of hematologic and malignant diseases. A major complication is the induction of graft-versus-host disease. Whereas removal of T lymphocytes from the donor marrow effectively reduces the incidence of graft-versus-host disease, the incidence of graft failure often increases when T cells are depleted from the transplanted marrow. In the current study, photoinactivation of the donor cells with 8-methoxypsoralen coupled with exposure to long-wavelength ultraviolet radiation (PUVA therapy) was used to inactivate the response of the donor T cells against the host. PUVA therapy suppressed the ability of spleen cells to respond to alloantigen in the in vitro mixed lymphocyte reaction. The induction of acute graft-versus-host disease across complete major histocompatibility barriers in lethally X-irradiated mice was significantly suppressed after bone marrow transplantation with photoinactivated bone marrow cells. Long-term survivors demonstrated allogeneic reconstitution and partial restoration of T-cell function. Because PUVA therapy had no inhibitory effect on hematopoiesis, these data suggest that using phototherapy to inactivate the alloreactivity of T cells may provide an alternative to purging T cells from the donor marrow, thus suppressing both the incidence of graft-versus-host disease and the incidence of graft failure.\r"

Whereas initial reports suggested its presence solely within the lamina lucida (LL), others have suggested that laminin is instead an exclusive component of the lamina densa (LD). In an attempt to more critically address this issue, we have examined both intact and partially separated (via 1 M NaCl) murine skin BMZ by indirect immunoelectron microscopy via a two-step immunoperoxidase technique on unfixed cryopreserved tissue, utilizing nine well-characterized monoclonal antibodies with binding specificity for laminin. Localization of the sites of the epitopes recognized by these antibodies on isolated laminin molecules was previously determined by rotary shadowing and by biochemical analyses on enzymatic fragments of laminin. Whereas at least faint immunoreactants were detected in both regions with eight of nine antibodies, predominant staining was noted within the LL with three of eight and within (and even sparsely below) the LD in three of eight. One antibody bound solely to the LL; another bound equally within both regions. Although some overlap was noted, it appears that the epitope on the distal portion of the long arm of the laminin molecule resides primarily within the skin LD, whereas epitopes on more central portions of the short arms are present within the LL or within both LL and LD. The findings of stratification of laminin epitopes within skin BMZ supports a similar recent observation in mouse kidney and suggests that portions of the laminin molecule span both LD and LL, and that there may be a non-random spatial orientation for the laminin molecule within murine skin BMZ.\r"

It has been proposed that there may be a defect in a local histamine vasodilator mechanism. The role of the peptidergic nervous system in Raynaud's phenomenon has not been previously investigated. To study the histaminergic and peptidergic axes in Raynaud's phenomenon, we measured the cutaneous microvascular responses of patients with Raynaud's phenomenon to digital intradermal injections of saline, histamine, the histamine-releasing agent, compound 48/80, substance P, and calcitonin gene-related peptide. We compared these results with those obtained in normal subjects. Intradermal cutaneous microvascular blood flow responses were quantified by planimetry and laser Doppler flowmetry. The results show: a) that in primary Raynaud's phenomenon there is no evidence of local deficiency in histamine release or insensitivity to histamine in the cutaneous microvasculature; and b) that patients with Raynaud's phenomenon react normally to the neuropeptides calcitonin gene-related peptide and substance P, providing a rationale for treating Raynaud's phenomenon with vasoactive peptides.\r"

Experiments in vitro suggest that keratinocytes supply bFGF to melanocytes through a paracrine mechanism and that the aberrant expression of bFGF in melanomas confers growth independence from bFGF-producing cells. To determine whether bFGF is expressed in vivo, we examined a series of benign and malignant melanocytic lesions in situ using bFGF riboprobes on tissue sections, and correlated bFGF expression with histologic phenotype. Seventeen melanocytic neoplasms were studied, including four common acquired nevi, four dysplastic nevi, four primary malignant melanomas, and five metastatic melanomas. Nevic cells in benign intradermal nevi showed low signal intensity (1+), whereas compound and dysplastic nevi showed 2+ to 3+ expression in the junctional nevic cell population and 1+ expression in the dermal nevic cell population. Melanocytes in primary melanomas had intermediate (2+) and those in metastatic melanomas had low (1+) levels of bFGF gene transcripts. Fibroblasts expressed high levels (3+) and epidermal and adnexal keratinocytes moderate (2+) levels of bFGF in all cases studied. Basic FGF expression in endothelial cells, known to produce and respond to this growth factor in vitro, was lower than that in the fibroblast and keratinocyte cell population and, in 10 of 17 cases, no bFGF mRNA was detectable. This study shows that bFGF is expressed in nevomelanocytes in vivo in all melanocytic lesions studied and thus cannot be used as a marker for transformation. The presence of bFGF gene transcripts in the various dermal cell types and in keratinocytes suggests that it may act as an autocrine and paracrine growth factor in regulating cellular proliferation in the skin.\r"

Cutaneous expressions include urticaria pigmentosa, mastocytoma, diffuse and erythrodermic cutaneous mastocytosis, and telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans. The cutaneous lesions tend to appear early in life. Although urticaria pigmentosa has been reported in 12 pairs of twins and one set of triplets, the majority of affected individuals have no familial association. Most patients with systemic mastocytosis have skin lesions; however, an occasional patient will have systemic disease with no other skin features than flushing. In lesional cutaneous sites and in non-lesional skin, there is an increase in the number of mast cells. Electron microscopy shows quantitative differences between lesional skin mast cells from patients with and without systemic disease. The mast cells from adult patients with systemic disease have a larger mean cytoplasmic area, nuclear size, and granule diameter. The granules contain predominantly grating/lattice structures. The cutaneous mast cells contain tryptase and chymase. They retain their functional reactivities to relevant secretory stimuli, such as C3a, morphine sulfate, and calcium ionophore A23187. Lesional skin contains histamine, leukotriene B4, prostaglandin D2, 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, platelet-activating factor, and heparin. Treatment of the cutaneous manifestations includes the use of H1 and H2 antihistamines, oral disodium cromoglycate, psoralens plus ultraviolet A photochemotherapy, and potent topical corticosteroid preparations.\r"

In the research described in this paper, we have used human keratinocyte cultures, grown at the air-liquid (A/L) interface, to examine the relationship between epidermal differentiation (including SC formation) and barrier function. Histologically, the A/L culture showed several markers of complete differentiation, including the presence of well-organized and defined epidermal cell layers, keratohyalin granules, and a multilayered SC. The permeability of tritiated water through epidermal cultures, which had grown for 3 weeks at the A/L interface, was measured with a microdiffusion apparatus. The results of these experiments demonstrated that: a) the human keratinocyte cultures developed a substantial barrier (i.e., a multilayered SC) to water diffusion across the entire surface. If the relative humidity of the culturing environment was lowered from 100% to around 75%, the barrier was significantly improved; b) the differentiation promoter, 1.25-dihydroxy-vitamin-D3, increased the number of SC layers and reduced water permeation through the culture; c) the nature of the keratinocyte support matrix could be altered to improve the morphology as well as the barrier function of the epidermal cultures. Overall, the observations are consistent with the relationship that is believed to exist between SC intercellular lipid content and percutaneous penetration. Confirmation of this hypothesis will further the considerable potential of human keratinocyte A/L cultures as a valuable and relevant model in which to study drug absorption and metabolism.\r"

The present work demonstrates TGF-alpha protein in eccrine ducts, and eccrine, sebaceous, and apocrine glands. The proliferative dermal hair bulb does not express TGF-alpha in contrast to the differentiated outer root sheath hair follicle epithelia. In addition, hyperproliferative skin diseases including bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma, squamous cell carcinoma, and psoriasis show increased TGF-alpha expression. Thus, TGF-alpha may play a role in the morphogenesis and function of normal skin appendages and its overexpression is common in benign and malignant hyperproliferative skin diseases.\r"

Toward that end, sections of formalin-fixed biopsies obtained from 3H-deoxyuridine (3H-dU)-injected skin of eight psoriatic patients were immunostained, followed by autoradiography. Proliferating dermal cells exhibit silver grains from tritium emissions. The identity of the proliferating cells could then be determined by simultaneous visualization with antibodies specific for various cell types. UCHL1+ (CD45RO+) T cells (recall antigen-reactive helper T-cell subset) constituted 36.6 +/- 3.1% (mean +/- SEM, n = 6) of the proliferating dermal cells in involved skin, whereas Leu 18+ (CD45RA+) T cells (recall antigen naive T-cell subsets) comprised only 8.7 +/- 1.5% (n = 6). The Factor XIIIa+ dermal perivascular dendritic cell subset (24.9 +/- 1.5% of proliferating dermal cells, n = 6) and Factor VIII+ endothelial cells (23.0 +/- 2.3%, n = 6) represented the two other major proliferating populations in lesional psoriatic dermis. Differentiated tissue macrophages, identified by phase microscopy as melanophages or by immunostaining with antibodies to Leu M1 (CD15) or myeloid histiocyte antigen, comprised less than 5% of the proliferating population in either skin type. In addition to calculating the relative proportions of these cells to each other as percent, we also determined the density of cells, in cells/mm2 of tissue. The density of proliferating cells within these populations was increased in involved versus uninvolved skin: UCHL1+, 9.0 +/- 1.7 cells/mm2 versus 1.8 +/- 0.6 cells/mm2, p less than 0.01; Factor XIIIa+, 6.0 +/- 0.7 cells/mm2 versus 1.5 +/- 0.5 cells/mm2, p less than 0.01; Factor VIII+, 5.5 +/- 1.4 cells/mm2 versus 0.0 cells/mm2, p less than 0.05. The presence of preferential active proliferation of a T-cell subset in lesional dermis suggests that activating signals specific for this subset are contained within the psoriatic dermis in vivo. The activation of recall antigen-reactive T cells may be a driving force behind the dendritic cell and endothelial cell proliferation. Alternatively, the selective proliferation and expansion of these two constitutive cell types (Factor XIIIa+ and Factor VIII+) may result in signals that promote activation of UCHL1+ (CD45RO+) T cells.\r"

Sebaceous cells, termed \"sebocytes\", were determined to be epithelial in nature by positive staining with monoclonal antikeratin antibodies BG2 and BG12. However, sebocyte colonies were also negative for keratins found in differentiated cells of keratinocyte colonies, as defined by monoclonal antikeratin antibodies CC2 and CC6. Sebocytes did not produce cornified envelopes in vitro and could only be induced to produce small quantities (less than 5%) of envelopes with a calcium ionophore. Sebocyte growth characteristics in a variety of serum, dexamethasone, and hydrocortisone combinations were significantly different from those of human facial keratinocytes. Sebocytes also displayed a growth curve and plating efficiency that were different from those of keratinocytes. Large lipid droplets within growing sebocytes could be visualized with oil red o staining. Additionally, squalene and wax/cholesterol esters were made by sebocytes in vitro in greater amounts than by facial keratinocytes, as determined by thin-layer chromatography of organic extracts of 3H2O-labeled sebocytes. Sebocytes synthesized greater quantities of lipid, on a per-cell and protein basis, than did keratinocytes.\r"

  ".W": "This study demonstrated that antigens of the parasitic mite Sarcoptes scabiei (SS) cross-react with antigens of the house dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (DP). Crossed immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) reaction of SS extract with rabbit anti-DP serum resulted in multiple immunoprecipitates. Reciprocal CIE reactions gave similar results. Immunoprecipitates from both reactions bound IgE in the sera of dust-mite-sensitive patients who had no history of scabies. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis resolved protein/peptide bands of both SS and DP also bound serum IgE from dust-mite-allergic patients following immunoblotting. Non-allergic control sera gave no IgE binding to either SS or DP antigens. These results indicate that patients with atopy to dust mites exhibit circulating antibodies built to DP but that recognize determinants on SS antigens. It is highly probable that scabietic patients build antibodies to SS antigens that also recognize DP antigens. These results raise questions concerning the reported isotypic antibody responses to SS because the sensitivity of scabietic patients to house dust mites has not been previously evaluated. This cross-reactivity may play an important role in the susceptibility to scabies and its clinical manifestations.\r"

The increase in number of DC was both time and dose dependent, with the peak DC accumulation occurring at 48 h post application and at a TCSA dose of 1.0%. Photospecificity was evident in that mice irradiated prior to treatment with TCSA (UVA/TCSA) demonstrated no significant increase in DC accumulation. The accumulation of DC was followed by a significant increase in total lymph node cellularity. An in situ 3H-thymidine incorporation assay showed a significant increase in proliferative activity of cells isolated from the draining lymph nodes of mice treated with TCSA + UVA as compared to naive, vehicle, or UVA/TCSA-treated mice. Dendritic cells isolated from mice treated 24 h earlier with TCSA + UVA, but not those from naive mice or mice treated with UVA/TCSA, were capable of TCSA-specific antigen presentation. Responder lymphocytes from untreated mice or mice photosensitized with musk ambrette showed a much lower response to DC isolated from TCSA + UVA-treated mice, demonstrating the specificity of the reaction. DC-depleted lymph node cells were unable to stimulate this blastogenesis response. These results suggest that application and photoactivation of TCSA induces cellular and functional changes in the lymph node DC indicative of their involvement in the induction phase of a contact photoallergic reaction.\r"

For comparison, skin biopsies from psoriatic patients receiving psoralen + UVA (PUVA) therapy were examined. Although both treatment protocols were equally effective in inducing resolution of psoriatic lesions, the phenotypic changes induced by CsA differed greatly from those seen after PUVA. In CsA-treated patients there was a dramatic reduction in the ICAM-1 expression by papillary endothelial cells, but density, pattern, and phenotype of infiltrating inflammatory cells remained essentially unchanged. In contrast, PUVA therapy had no visible effect on ICAM-1 expression by papillary endothelial cells, but resulted in a significant reduction of the hemopoietic resident and infiltrating mononuclear cells within the epidermis. These results favor, but do not prove, the assumption that the CsA regimen chosen in this study exerts its anti-psoriatic effect primarily at the level of the keratinocyte, i.e., by inhibiting events leading to keratinocyte proliferation as well as by interfering with the secretion of mediators responsible for ICAM-1 expression by papillary endothelial cells.\r"

  ".W": "Functional studies of lymphocytes in atopic dermatitis (AD) have so far focused on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), whereas cells at the involved site, the skin, have not been examined. Accordingly, we have developed methods to generate lymphocyte cultures from biopsies of inflammatory skin areas. Skin-infiltrating lymphocytes (SIL) were isolated from skin biopsies of 6 patients with severe AD and expanded in vitro in the presence of interleukin-2 (IL-2) without additional antigens. After 6-10 d in culture, outgrowth of mononuclear cells from biopsy tissue was observed in all cases. Phenotypic analysis of skin-derived cells revealed the predominance of CD4+ T-helper/inducer phenotype in SIL populations. Parallel cultures of SIL and PBMC showed an increase and expansion of CD8+ T cells in cultured PBMC, whereas the CD4+ phenotype was predominant in SIL cultures. As indicated by their expression of HLA-DR and CD25 antigens, most of the SIL were activated and the cells mainly expressed T-cell receptors (TCR) composed of alpha and beta chains. Different strategies for expansion of SIL in vitro were examined. High levels of IL-4 (1,000 U/ml) in combination with IL-2 (50 U/ml or 1,000 U/ml) preferentially promoted growth of SIL derived from AD and were much more effective than IL-2 alone. No cells expanded in cultures with IL-4 alone. SIL grown with high concentrations of IL-4 contained a significant proportion of double-positive CD4+8+ cells. No other marked differences were observed in the distribution of T cell subsets in cultures propagated under different conditions for 21 d. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of growing infiltrating T lymphocytes from inflammatory skin of AD patients. The use of high concentrations of IL-2 in combination with high levels of IL-4 allows a large expansion of these cells and thus represents a useful strategy to expand cells for further functional and molecular biologic studies.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have demonstrated that cyclosporin A (CyA) exerts a beneficial effect on psoriasis. It remains unclear, however, whether T-cell immune responses are definitely impaired in psoriasis and whether the anti-psoriatic effect of CyA is mediated by interference with T-cell activation. To study these questions, 20 patients with severe psoriasis were treated with oral CyA (5 mg/kg/d) for 12 weeks and examined for several phenotypic and functional properties of peripheral blood T cells before and after therapy. The analyses included CD3, CD4, and CD8 phenotypes, IL-2 production and IL-2 receptor expression following Con A stimulation, proliferative responses to PHA, and in vivo responsiveness to a foreign antigen, PPD. When the values of patients before therapy and healthy individuals were compared, no statistically significant differences were detected in any of these analyses. Furthermore, none of these T-cell properties were changed after 12 weeks of treatment. To assess possible minor mutations in T-cell-related genes in psoriasis, the T-cell receptor beta-chain locus was analyzed by Southern hybridization. With a cDNA probe for C beta 1, a polymorphic fragment of congruent to 9 kb was detected in Eco RI digests in one of 20 patients and in four of 10 healthy individuals examined. No polymorphism was detected in Bam HI digests in any individual. These results fail to support the hypothesis that a general or \"systemic\" alteration in T-cell immunity plays a central role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and in the action of CyA against this skin disorder.\r"

We have isolated a murine cDNA clone, pCAL-F559, for the calcium-binding protein calcyclin by differential screening of a cDNA library made from RNA isolated from hair follicles of 6-d-old mice. The identity of our cDNA clone was established by comparing the DNA sequence with the sequence of the human calcyclin gene. That the authentic calcyclin mRNA encoded by pCAL-559 is present in skin of 3-d-old mice was confirmed by S1 nuclease protection assays. As measured by RNA dot blots, calcyclin mRNA levels in the skin change in accordance with the hair cycle and reaches a peak a few days prior to the mRNA for structural hair proteins. Although we can demonstrate by in situ hybridization that mRNA for calcyclin is localized in the post-mitotic keratogenous region of the hair follicle we can only assume that this calcium binding protein is involved in the control of differentiation of these cells by regulating their Ca++ levels.\r"

This report documents, for the first time, the occurrence of intranuclear rodlets in normal cultured human dermal papilla cells. Intranuclear rodlets have been observed predominantly in normal neurons, neural neoplasms, and paraneuromas. Whereas intranuclear rodlets and complex intranuclear bodies have not been identified in dermal papilla cells in vivo, they were observed, by light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, in primary and subsequent passaged cultures in all 10 individuals examined. Intranuclear rodlets and bodies were not found, however, in parallel cultures of scalp dermal fibroblasts from the same individuals. Rodlet ultrastructure in cultured dermal papilla cells exhibited many features in common with previous reports on rodlets in neuronal and paraneuronal cells. Features that differentiated the rodlets in this study, however, included: doublet/triplet rodlets in the same nucleus; rodlets or crystalline filament bundles within complex nuclear inclusions; close relationship with the nuclear membrane, and their frequent intimate association with intranuclear bodies; and nucleoli and fine chromatin-distinct fibrillar material. Although the function of these true intranuclear inclusions in dermal papilla cells is unknown, it is noteworthy that they were present in these highly metabolically active fibroblasts while absent in comparatively less active dermal fibroblasts, and may indeed be a marker for this fibroblast cell type.\r"

The induction of heat shock proteins was measured in cells by one-dimensional gel electrophoresis of [35S] methionine-labeled proteins and by immunofluorescence using a specific HSP72 monoclonal antibody. Both HSP90 and HSP116 were constitutively expressed in these cell types. Exposure of these cells to weak inducing agents such as heat or cadmium sulphate resulted in the synthesis of HSP72 and HSP90, whereas HSP28 and HSP116 synthesis was detected in keratinocytes and fibroblasts following exposure to the strong inducing agent sodium arsenite. In addition, sodium arsenite induced the synthesis of HSP46 in human keratinocytes. Immunofluorescence demonstrated a rapid and reversible accumulation of the 72-kD heat shock protein within the nucleolus of heat-stressed human keratinocytes and fibroblasts.\r"

The active metabolic products of the mast cell influence gastrointestinal secretion, absorption, and motility through paracrine effects of local mast cell degranulation and also cause systemic effects through the release of cellular products into the blood stream. Systemic mastocytosis influences physiologic function through the systemic effects of mast cell products released from focal (e.g., bone marrow) or wide spread increases in mast cell number. Local gastrointestinal proliferation of mast cells in response to recognized (e.g., gluten in celiac sprue) or obscure stimuli can alter gastrointestinal function and induce systemic symptoms. Celiac sprue, inflammatory bowel disease, and non-ulcer dyspepsia are three examples of gastrointestinal diseases in which mast cells can be implicated in the pathophysiology of the symptoms.\r"

Lymphocytes and eosinophils frequently are admixed with the mast cells, forming the classic MEL lesion. The mast cell lesions can be found in perivascular, peritrabecular or intertrabecular locations and may on occasion completely replace intratrabecular regions of the marrow. In contrast, the mast cell lesions found in children with cutaneous mast cell disorders are uniformly small and subtle and are most frequently located perivascularly. Lymphocytes, eosinophils, and early myeloid elements may be associated with these lesions. Of perhaps greater specificity for SMCD is the finding of confluent clusters of mast cells on the marrow aspirates; such clusters are noted in up to 30% of patients with SMCD.\r"

Clearance studies were performed in 4-week-old to 18-month-old mice with a complement-fixing rabbit IgG antimouse red blood cell antibody. Four clearance rate constants governing complement- and Fc-mediated clearance function were evaluated: complement-mediated sequestration (k1), C3b deactivation and release (k2), complement-dependent phagocytosis (k4), and Fc-mediated sequestration and phagocytosis (k3). BXSB male, MRL-lpr/lpr female and male, NZB female, and NZB/W female and male mice all had significantly decreased Fc-mediated clearance function (k3) when compared with control BALB/c mice (p less than 0.0001). This defect in Fc-mediated clearance was present in all four strains of autoimmune mice by 6 months of age and preceded the onset of serologic and clinical disease activity in NZB mice. Abnormal complement-mediated clearance was detected in MRL-lpr/lpr female and male mice, NZB female, and NZB/W female and male mice, but not in BXSB mice. In MRL-lpr/lpr mice decreased complement-mediated sequestration (k1, p less than 0.0001) and complement-dependent phagocytosis (k4, p less than 0.0001) were present as early as 4 weeks of age. In contrast, the change in complement-mediated clearance in NZB and NZB/W mice was characterized by decreased C3b deactivation and release (k2, p less than 0.001) and resulted in an enhanced early phase of clearance. Decreased k2 values in New Zealand mice occurred as early as 2 months of age, preceding serologic and clinical disease activity as well as decreased Fc receptor function. These studies demonstrated an early, progressive, and uniform defect in Fc-mediated clearance in the four murine strains of SLE studied. Complement-mediated clearance, however, varied considerably in lupus-prone mice, ranging from severe impairment in MRL-lpr/lpr to normal function in BXSB and accelerated clearance in NZB and NZB/W mice. Accelerated clearance in New Zealand mice was characterized by decreased C3b deactivation and release of antibody sensitized cells, which in turn led to increased phagocytosis of sensitized cells sequestered by complement-dependent processes.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the coagulant and fibrinolytic potential of peritoneal macrophages, after short-term exposure to dialysis solutions intraperitoneal (IP) injection of these hyperosmolar glucose solutions was performed in rats. During the 72-hour postinjection period, the dialysis solutions and, as controls, Ringer's lactate and Ringer's lactate-glucose all induced a similar increase in the number of polymorphonuclear cells and macrophages within a maximum of 24 or 48 hours after their IP injection. These findings demonstrate that IP injection of any dialysis solution results in a moderate non-specific inflammatory cell harvesting. Compared with activity induced by the control solutions, no significant increase of procoagulant and fibrinolytic activities, identified respectively by the presence of thromboplastin and plasminogen activator, was observed in peritoneal macrophages obtained 48 hours after injection of the solution with the highest glucose concentration. However, the level of procoagulant activity could increase as a result of different manufacturers' processing of the solutions. That the basal level of macrophage functions may be modified suggests that this cell may initiate coagulolytic conditions in the peritoneal cavity, especially in the course of IP injection of dialysis solutions.\r"

  ".W": "Lead markedly augments the lethality of endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in rats. In this model of LPS toxicity, the liver is severely injured. Much of the tissue injury produced by LPS is thought to be mediated by the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Tumor necrosis factor recently has been speculated to be a mediator of several models of liver injury such as that produced by galactosamine. To investigate the possible role of TNF in the lead-enhanced LPS toxicity model, we administered doses of lead acetate (15 mg/kg), LPS (100 micrograms/kg), or TNF (6.25 x 10(6) U/kg) that produced minimal changes in liver enzymes. However, when lead was administered simultaneously with either LPS or TNF, serum aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, glutamyl transpeptidase, and plasma triglyceride levels were markedly increased. Lead + LPS treatment increased both peak serum TNF concentrations and TNF \"area under the curve\" as compared with LPS alone. We conclude that lead not only enhances LPS lethality but also LPS liver injury. Furthermore, lead enhances TNF liver injury and increases LPS-stimulated serum TNF levels. These data suggest that the lead-enhanced LPS model offers a system for studying TNF-induced liver injury.\r"

  ".U": "91162059\r", 
  ".W": "We have studied the conditions of in vitro binding of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) to fibrinogen and applied the results to identify and measure the serum inhibitors to the binding. For the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, platelet extract was delivered to a fibrinogen-coated microtiter plate that was incubated for 2 hours, followed by incubation with anti-GPIIb/IIIa monoclonal antibody for another 2 hours. The plate was then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for color development. The binding was shown to be calcium-dependent. The binding was partially blocked by treating the coated fibrinogen with anti-fibrinogen antibody. Reduction or dissociation of GPIIb/IIIa resulted in the total loss of its ability to bind to fibrinogen. Platelet extracts of patients with hemophilia showed decreased binding (25% and 14%, compared with control platelet extract), and an extract from a patient with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia showed no binding. With the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay we have measured serum inhibitors to GPIIb/IIIa binding to fibrinogen in 35 hemophilia A, 17 immune thrombocytopenic purpura, 22 human immunodeficiency virus-related immune thrombocytopenic purpura, and 29 systemic lupus erythematosus serum samples. In those patients with inhibition by serum, polyethylene glycol precipitation of circulating immune complexes (CICs) decreased the inhibition by the supernatants, and all the resolubilized CIC precipitates demonstrated inhibition, which indicates that CICs play a major role in the inhibition of GPIIb/IIIa binding to fibrinogen. This, then, provides evidence of CIC-mediated impaired GPIIb/IIIa binding to fibrinogen in hemophilia A, HIV-ITP, and SLE.\r"

  ".W": "Inhibition of thrombin proteolysis of fibrinogen with D-phenylalanyl-L-propyl-L-arginine chloromethyl ketone (PPACK) results in irreversible inactivation of the thrombin catalytic site, but the PPACK-inhibited thrombin, through its exosite, retains its ability to bind to fibrinogen or fibrin. Hirudin inactivates thrombin at the catalytic site and also inhibits thrombin exosite binding to fibrin or fibrinogen. PPACK or hirudin was added to a clotting mixture of fibrinogen and active thrombin (enzyme-to-substrate ratio = 1:400 at ionic strength of 0.14; 1:800 at ionic strength of 0.09) before the onset of gelation. Subsequent fibrin assembly was evaluated by turbidity measurements at 350 nm and by determining the fibrin and fibrinogen content of the clots that ultimately formed. Polymerization rates and the fibrin-fibrinogen content of the clots that formed were greater in the PPACK-inhibited system than in the hirudin-inhibited system, and the effect was amplified at the lower ionic strength. PPACK-thrombin also promoted the polymerization of native or prepared mixtures of fibrin and fibrinogen. The results suggest that in addition to its well-recognized role in the proteolytic conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, thrombin functions through exosite binding to fibrin as a cofactor in fibrin polymerization by accelerating fibrin clot assembly.\r"

  ".U": "91162061\r", 
  ".W": "Elastin has long been thought to play a pivotal role in alveolar septal development by providing the structural framework around which new alveoli develop in the immature lung. This theory was derived from observations that the dramatic increase in lung elastin and alveolar septal development occurred during the same time period, days 4 to 13 in the rat. Using stereologic techniques, we evaluated volume density of respiratory tissue in parenchyma and total length of parenchymal elastic fibers in the lungs of neonatal rats ranging in age from 4 to 26 days. Lung tissue was obtained from each of the four right lung lobes and from the upper, middle, and lower regions of the left lung. When changes in these two parameters in the lung as a whole were considered by averaging values for each of the seven regions, a continuous increase was observed in both the volume of parenchymal tissue in parenchyma and the total length of elastic fibers from days 4 to 22. A significant correlation was found between the volume of respiratory tissue in parenchyma and the length of parenchymal elastic fibers from days 4 to 26, supporting the existing theory that a causal relationship exists between these two parameters. A comparison of the ratios of elastic fiber length to volume density of respiratory tissue in parenchyma (Lv/Vrp) from each of the seven lung regions sampled indicated a significant variability in Lv/Vrp within different regions of the same lung. In addition, the effects of postnatal age and lung region on Lv/Vrp were interdependent; the lung regions that differed with respect to the length density of elastic fibers varied with postnatal age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We investigated the conditions under which partial cellular activation occurs in the absence of signal to the T cell receptor. Both murine thymocytes and the T cell clone D10.G4.1 responded to recombinant interleukin-1 in the absence of a mitogenic signal, although the magnitude of these responses was smaller and required higher concentrations of interleukin-1 than if a comitogen had been present. Interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 in combination were synergistic and induced tritiated thymidine incorporation in D10.G4.1 cells equal to 15% of that obtained with optimal concentrations of concanavalin A. Such synergy suggests that a significant degree of nonspecific activation of lymphocytes may occur in the presence of combinations of monocyte-derived cytokines.\r"

  ".U": "91162064\r", 
  ".W": "The relationship of adenotin, a low-affinity adenosine-binding protein, to adenosine receptors was examined in two human tissues and two mammalian cultured cell lines. An adenosine A2 receptor exists in the membranes from platelets, PC-12 cells, and JAR cells as shown by a stimulation of adenylate cyclase related to 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) or a NECA-related increase in intracellular cAMP levels. In contrast, binding studies with tritiated NECA revealed typical adenotin-like low-affinity binding sites on the membranes from the sources studied with agonist potencies as follows: NECA greater than 2-chloroadenosine greater than R-PIA. No evidence was found of coupling to a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein. Solubilization of platelet and placental membranes and precipitation with polyethylene glycol separated adenotin or the adenotin-like protein from a second adenosine binding site in each tissue. The pharmacologic properties of the precipitated binding sites were compatible with an adenosine A2 receptor in platelets and an adenosine A1 receptor in placenta. Our observations indicate that adenotin-like proteins exist outside the placenta. In addition, adenotin and adenotin-like proteins coexist with the adenosine A1 or A2 receptor in a number of cells and tissues and do not couple to a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein and stimulate adenylate cyclase. Therefore, adenotin is pharmacologically distinct from adenosine receptors, and its function remains to be discovered.\r"

A historical cohort design was used. Risk factors present before the start of the study were identified. Osteoporosis risk recognition (discussion, problem list), osteoporosis specific intervention (counseling about risk, or estrogen or calcium supplementation), or nonspecific intervention (dietary, exercise, smoking, or alcohol counseling) were recorded over a 3-year follow-up period. Seventy-four percent of the women had two or more risk factors. The most common were perimenopausal or postmenopausal status (73%) and absence of estrogen supplementation (ever) (65%). During the period of the study, 46 women (19%) had received an osteoporosis-specific intervention. One hundred eleven women (46%) had received one of the above or a less specific intervention. The medical records of only 25 women (10%) documented an assessment of osteoporosis risk. Only menopausal status predicted osteoporosis intervention, and the probability of intervention decreased as the total number of risk factors increased. The data identify three groups of women who could benefit from increased risk-reduction strategies: premenopausal women, perimenopausal or postmenopausal women who have never previously taken supplemental estrogens, and women with multiple risk factors.\r"

One thousand five hundred twenty-eight medical records were randomly selected from all visits occurring over two periods in 1986 and 1987 to 122 residents in an eight-site family medicine residency network. Patients with cardiovascular disease and those younger than 20 or older than 65 years of age were excluded. Assessments were made of (1) smoking history, blood pressure, weight, physical activity, and dietary content during the previous 12 months; (2) family history of cardiovascular disease during the previous 12 months and in the initial patient history; (3) and blood cholesterol during the prior 5 years. Risk-factor counseling practices were examined for the previous 12 months. Blood pressure was assessed in 96% of patients, smoking in 40%, cholesterol in 26%, and family history in 52%. Ninety-six percent of hypertensive patients were counseled for hypertension, but only 45% of smokers and 20% of patients with hypercholesterolemia were counseled for those risk factors. Of patients having a given risk factor, assessment for any other risk factor occurred in fewer than 60% of cases. Patients having a documented positive family history were only slightly more likely than other patients to be assessed for additional risk factors. There is continued need for enhancing coronary risk-factor assessment and counseling by resident physicians.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Records of women giving birth at an inner-city hospital who had fewer than three prenatal visits (cases) were compared with those of women giving birth at the same hospital who had more adequate prenatal care (controls). The final sample contained 120 women in each group. Women in the case group were more likely to be multiparous, to be less educated, and to have no telephone in the home. Tobacco and drug abuse were recorded significantly more often among these women. There was no difference in racial distribution between the case and control groups. Infants of women with minimal or no prenatal care had a lower mean birthweight and a higher frequency of prematurity. In logistic regression analysis, higher parity, age less than 30 years, single status, smoking, drug abuse, and residence in one of two statistical planning areas in the city were independently associated with increased odds of not receiving prenatal care. To be effective, prenatal outreach programs for inner-city women must be based on knowledge of the characteristics and needs of this population.\r"

  ".W": "In response to the obstetric malpractice crisis, both obstetrician-gynecologists and family physicians have raised their fees and preferentially selected lower risk patients. In addition, large numbers of general and family physicians have left obstetric practice altogether. The impact of these responses was explored by examining the differences in the demographic and clinical profile of patients served by these two disciplines in the State of Washington. Eighty-five percent (45,540) of all complete records from 1983 births attended by physicians in the State of Washington were matched to physician specialty information. These births represent 67% of the total deliveries in Washington State in 1983. Although twice as many general and family physicians as obstetricians were practicing obstetrics, obstetricians delivered 2.5 times as many infants as did general and family physicians. Obstetricians served an older patient population with more low-birthweight infants, multiple births, and complications of pregnancy than family physicians. General and family physicians were more likely to care for minorities, teenagers, and unmarried and rural mothers. Obstetricians cared for patients with higher medical risks, whereas general and family physicians provided care to more socially vulnerable and geographically isolated populations. To the extent that general and family physicians are differentially abandoning obstetric practice because of the current malpractice crisis, access to care for rural and socially vulnerable groups may deteriorate rapidly.\r"

  ".W": "Bacterial contaimination of endoscopes can be clinically significant. While current data suggest that flexible sigmoidoscopy may entail fewer risks than upper endoscopy, these data are too incomplete to draw this conclusion. Careful cleaning and disinfection after each procedure are recommended. Gas sterilization of the endoscope and gas or heat sterilization of accessory equipment may be necessary in certain clinical situations. It must be remembered that hundreds of thousands of endoscopic procedures were performed in the 1970s using cleaning only without substantial health risk. The processes do not have to be complicated or difficult. Staff must be well trained and must understand the potential risks of working with disinfecting agents such as alkaline glutaraldehyde. It is recommended that the clinician fully understand the cleaning and disinfection steps and be able to perform them. It is important that office procedures be based on efficacy, not convenience. The procedures developed to date are not ideal and the ideal disinfectant has yet to be found. Cleaning and disinfecting machines have been developed, but they are expensive and their efficacy and safety are no better than hand-performed methods. An alternative approach to reducing transmission of infections by endoscopes may be to seek less adherent plastic substances for the endoscope sheath. The introduction of immersible endoscopes has helped with cleaning, but their use may also give rise to a false sense of security. Diligent attention to cleaning and disinfection is still necessary.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Skin vasomotor reflexes were investigated after warming and cooling the left arm and recording changes in skin temperature as a measure of skin blood flow in the right hand and both feet. Twenty-three diabetic patients with cardiac autonomic neuropathy and 28 healthy control subjects were examined. In contrast to the healthy subjects, the diabetic patients showed reduced or even absent responses in skin temperature to both warming and cooling. The rate of skin temperature decrease for the hand and feet during cooling, which was used as the actual parameter to quantitate skin vasomotor control, was significantly reduced in the diabetic group as compared with the healthy control subjects. We conclude that this technique provides a simple non-invasive method for quantitating skin vasomotor function in the extremities of diabetic patients.\r"

The aim of this analysis is to reduce the dimensionality of a multivariate data set to the smallest number of meaningful and independent dimensions. The analysis can also provide interpretable linear functions of the original measured variables that may serve as valuable indices of variation. A brief introduction to principal components analysis is given herein, followed by an examination of a particular set of multivariate data accruing from a study of acute brain injuries in a pediatric population, in which severity of brain injury had been assessed with the Glasgow Coma Scale (CGS). Principal components analysis reveals that the GCS sum score is a particularly inefficient summarizer of information in this cohort. The determination of an objective weighting of measured variables, as provided through principal components analysis, is essential in the construction of meaningful neurological scoring instruments.\r"

Multiple sclerosis and neuroborreliosis can show similarities in clinical symptoms as well as lymphocytic cell reactions and oligoclonal bands in the isoelectric focusing of cerebrospinal fluid. To differentiate between multiple sclerosis and neuroborreliosis we tested intrathecally synthesized IgM and virus antibodies. The IgM indices were higher for most of the neuroborreliosis patients studied than for those with multiple sclerosis, and cell counts were also significantly higher in the acute stage of the disease. In 84% of multiple sclerosis patients we were able to demonstrate intrathecal antibody production against measles, rubella or mumps virus. Neuroborreliosis patients had no intrathecal virus antibody synthesis. The specification of oligoclonal bands resulting from isoelectric focusing of cerebrospinal fluid with an ELISA for B. burgdorferi can further substantiate the diagnosis of neuroborreliosis or help to rule it out in multiple sclerosis patients with positive borrelia-specific serology.\r"

  ".W": "Early diagnosis of acute cerebral ischaemia is still unsatisfactory, because X-ray computed tomography (CT) does not reveal the site and extent of hypoperfusion within the first 24 h. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using 99mTc-hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (HMPAO) may offer earlier information, since the distribution of HMPAO follows the actual cerebral perfusion pattern. We therefore investigated 53 patients suffering from acute cerebral ischaemia (10 with transient ischaemic attacks, 9 with prolonged ischaemic reversible neurological deficits, 34 with completed stroke). SPECT and CT examinations were performed on days 1, 3, and 14. On day 1, SPECT revealed hypoperfused areas in 42 patients, whereas CT showed hypodensities only in 5. The sensitivity of SPECT was higher in cortical compared with subcortical ischaemia. In patients suffering from reversible neurological deficits SPECT normalized in the follow-up, corresponding to clinical improvement. In completed stroke, SPECT demonstrated variable perfusion patterns with hypo-, normo-, and hypoperfused areas on day 3 and especially on day 14. In contrast to CT, HMPAO SPECT leads to early diagnosis of cerebral ischaemia, in particular within the cerebral cortex.\r"

The present findings indicate that not only lesions of the thalamus but also those of the basal ganglia can cause unilateral asterixis, and bilateral and symmetrical asterixis does not necessarily exclude the presence of a focal mass lesion in the cerebrum.\r"

This lesion occurred more often in female than male patients by a 2:1 margin, and the mean age at presentation was 38 years. The average patient had been symptomatic for nearly 3 years at the time of treatment, with the most common symptoms and signs being pituitary dysfunction, visual disturbances, and headaches. Affected children generally were pituitary dwarfs. The sella was enlarged in 80% of cases, and the cyst was situated in both an intrasellar and a suprasellar location in 71%. Computerized tomography revealed a low-density cystic mass with capsular enhancement in one-half of the cases. A variable appearance was seen with magnetic resonance imaging. Partial excision and drainage of the cyst by the transsphenoidal approach is the recommended treatment, as the recurrence rate is low. Most symptoms and signs improved or resolved following surgery with the exception of hypopituitarism and diabetes insipidus. The cyst lining was usually composed of ciliated cuboidal or columnar epithelium. Theories as to the origin of Rathke's cleft cysts are also discussed.\r"

Of the 51 tumors reviewed, 16 were located in the suprasellar region, 32 in the pineal region, and three in both the pineal and the suprasellar regions. Forty-nine patients underwent surgical resection which was total in seven and partial in 20, and consisted of a biopsy in 22. Two patients were managed on the basis of serum and cerebrospinal fluid markers. Surgical tools such as the operating microscope, the ultrasonic surgical aspirator, and the laser beam allowed safe debulking and removal of the deep-seated tumors in the pineal region. There were no operative deaths in the 36 patients treated since 1972, who included 23 with pineal tumors. Twenty-five patients with germinomas received radiotherapy and had a 5-year survival rate of 85.1%. Thirteen patients with non-germinoma germ-cell tumors received radiotherapy and had a 5-year survival rate of 45.5%. On the basis of this review, the authors recommend resection of pineal and suprasellar germ-cell tumors in order to firmly establish an accurate histological diagnosis to guide the extent of adjuvant therapy. In the case of a pure germinoma without evidence of dissemination, adjuvant therapy consists only of local radiotherapy. On the other hand, for malignant non-germinoma germ-cell tumors, adjuvant therapy must include chemotherapy as well as craniospinal axis radiotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Stereotactic radiosurgery has an expanding role in the management of selected intracranial tumors. In an initial 30-month experience using the 201-source cobalt-60 gamma knife at the University of Pittsburgh, 50 patients with meningiomas were treated. The most frequent site of origin was the skull base. Previously, 36 patients (72%) had undergone at least one craniotomy and four patients (8%) had received fractionated external beam radiation therapy. Stereotactic radiosurgery was the primary treatment modality in 16 patients (32%) with symptomatic tumors demonstrated by neuroimaging. Computer imaging-generated isodose plans (with one to five irradiation isocenters) for single-treatment irradiation gave optimal (greater than or equal to 50% isodose line) coverage in 44 patients (88%). The proximity of cranial nerves or vascular, pituitary, and brain-stem structures to the often convoluted tumor mass was crucial to dose selection. Serial imaging studies were evaluated in all 50 patients. Twenty-four patients were examined between 12 and 36 months after treatment; 13 (54%) showed a reduction in tumor volume while nine (38%) showed no change. Of 26 patients evaluated between 6 and 12 months after treatment, four showed a decrease in tumor size while 22 showed no change. Two patients (both with large tumors that received suboptimal irradiation) had delayed tumor growth outside the radiosurgical treatment volume. The actuarial 2-year tumor growth control rate was 96%. Between 3 and 12 months after radiosurgery, three patients developed delayed neurological deficits that gradually improved, compatible with delayed radiation injury. Although extended follow-up monitoring over many years will be necessary to fully evaluate treatment, to date stereotactic radiosurgery has proved to be a relatively safe and effective therapy for selected patients with symptomatic meningiomas, including those who failed surgical resection. Radiosurgery was an effective primary treatment alternative for those patients whose advanced age, medical condition, or high-risk tumor location mitigated against surgical resection.\r"

None of the patients underwent functional mapping of cortical language ability. All patients were assessed with a standardized aphasia battery (Multilingual Aphasia Examination) before and 6 months after surgery. Postoperatively, the dominant anterior temporal lobectomy group did not show any significant losses in language function compared to patients who underwent nondominant anterior temporal lobectomy. In addition, the dominant temporal lobectomy group showed significant postoperative improvement in complex receptive language comprehension compared to the nondominant group. These results suggest that patients with complex partial seizures of medial temporal lobe onset can undergo a conservative resection of lateral temporal cortex without language mapping. Such surgery carries little risk to language function and provides an excellent postoperative surgical outcome.\r"

  ".U": "91162334\r", 
  ".W": "The authors have devised a \"trapping-evacuation\" technique to facilitate direct clipping of giant aneurysms in the paraophthalmic region of the internal carotid artery (ICA). The giant aneurysm is collapsed by first trapping the aneurysm by temporary occlusion of the cervical common carotid and external carotid arteries, along with temporary clipping of the intracranial ICA distal to the aneurysm. Thereafter, intra-aneurysmal blood is simultaneously aspirated through a catheter placed in the cervical ICA. Exposure of the proximal end of the aneurysm neck is mandatory for successful clipping. This is accomplished by extensive unroofing of the optic canal, removal of the anterior clinoid process, opening of the anterior part of the cavernous sinus, and exposure of the most proximal intradural (C2) and genu (C3) portions of the ICA. Four cases of giant aneurysms of the paraophthalmic ICA were successfully treated by this technique and the postoperative outcome was good in all cases. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging for evaluation of the anatomical details, balloon occlusion test of the ICA, and intraoperative measurement of cortical blood flow were important to the success of the operation. Intraoperative digital subtraction angiography via the catheter placed in the cervical ICA was useful in confirming successful clipping.\r"

The mean intelligence quotient (IQ) of 41 testable patients was 71.12 (range less than 30 to 114). The seizure outcome was as follows: 13% were seizure-free, 65% were significantly improved, and 22% were unchanged. Ten patients subsequently underwent a second operation to complete the callosal sectioning which resulted in additional seizure improvement in only five of them. Five complications resulted from 90 operations: two epidural hematomas, one delayed subdural hematoma, one bone-flap infection, and one postcallosotomy disconnection syndrome; two patients died. A younger age at onset of seizures, a higher IQ, and generalized tonic-clonic, atonic, complex-partial, and mixed seizure types were associated with improved seizure outcome.\r"

  ".W": "Serial postoperative magnetic resonance (MR) studies were obtained in 21 patients who underwent somatotopically placed stereotactic radiofrequency (rf) ventralis lateralis thalamotomy for the control of movement disorders. The MR studies were reviewed to determine the MR characteristics of early-phase (less than or equal to 7 days) and late-phase (8 days to 5 months) lesions. Surgery was performed for the control of parkinsonian tremor (14 cases), intention tremor (six cases), and essential tremor (one case). Single rf lesions were made with an electrode (1.6 mm in diameter, 3 mm in tip length) heated to 78 degrees C for 60 seconds. On MR images of the lesions, three distinct concentric zones were identified, described as follows (from the center outward). Zone 1 gives increased signal on long-relaxation time (TR) (T2-weighted) MR images in early- and late-phase lesions and decreased signal on short-TR (T1-weighted) MR images in early-phase lesions only. Zone 2 gives decreased signal on long-TR (T2-weighted) images in early- and late-phase lesions; it gives isointense signal on short-TR (T1-weighted) images in early-phase lesions only. Zone 3 gives increased signal on long-TR (T2-weighted) images in early-phase lesions only and decreased signal on short-TR (T1-weighted) MR images in early-phase lesions only. It is considered that in early-phase lesions, Zone 2, with a mean diameter of 7.3 mm on axial long-TR (T2-weighted) imaging, represents an area of hemorrhagic coagulation necrosis. In late-phase lesions, Zone 2, with a mean diameter of 5.0 mm on axial long-TR (T2-weighted) imaging, represents hemosiderin deposition. Zone 3 likely represents edema, and this zone disappears between the early and late periods. From regression analysis, lesion size began to stabilize at approximately 7 months with a mature lesion diameter of 3.3 mm. Long-term follow-up monitoring (median 16 months) showed good tremor control. Based on clinical and radiological findings, the authors conclude that forms of hemoglobin are suitable markers to assess the size of rf lesions. Serial MR imaging provides a noninvasive means of studying the evolution of rf thalamotomy lesions.\r"

Nucleolar organizer regions represent transcriptionally active sites of ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and can be identified by a simple argyrophilic technique. The authors describe a standardized approach to the assessment of these argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions in meningeal tumors. Twenty-five meningiomas were classified histologically into benign, atypical, or malignant groups. In addition, two hemangiopericytomas and one leptomeningeal melanoma were examined. Appropriate sections were silver stained and argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions were counted in 200 nuclei. The mean argyrophilic nucleolar organizer region count was statistically different (p less than 0.001) between benign tumors (245 +/- 156, 1.23/cell), atypical tumors (497 +/- 135, 2.49/cell), and malignant tumors (921 +/- 59, 4.61/cell). The count for recurrent meningiomas (544 +/- 76) was also statistically different (p less than 0.02) from non-recurrent tumors (329 +/- 183). The standardized assessment of argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions can be easily performed by any surgical pathology laboratory without specialized equipment and, in meningeal tumors, may be useful as an independent indicator of biological behavior.\r"

The true value of Cout in normal individuals, however, has hitherto not been reported. In the present study, Cout has been measured by a lumbar infusion test in eight young volunteers with no suspicion of disease. The mean intracranial pressure (ICP) was 11 mm Hg and a linear relationship was found between CSF absorption and ICP. The mean Cout was 0.11 ml/min/mm Hg and the lower 95% confidence level was 0.10 ml/min/mm Hg. These values are in accordance with those obtained from previous studies.\r"

Five patients showed a moderate disability in activities of daily living but were not dependent on help, one patient was severely disabled, and two had died. There was one rebleed. Early prognosis of an unfavorable outcome was possible on the basis of three clinical variables on admission: a history of hypertension, a Hunt and Hess grade of greater than II, and the presence of focal neurological deficits. In addition, the presence of an organic mental syndrome at discharge was identified as a predictive factor for reduced functional capacity later on. Other clinical variables in the acute stage, including sex, age, history of headache, interval between SAH and admission, impaired consciousness, and cognitive deficits, were not related to a limited functional level. Residual neurological deficits and the Glasgow Outcome Scale score on discharge were also not predictive of restrictions in global functions evaluated by means of the Karnofsky Performance Scale status at follow-up review.\r"

Gangliosides form part of the immunological identity of mammalian cells and are involved in a variety of cell-surface phenomena such as cell-substrate binding and receptor functions. In tumorous tissue, the ganglioside composition is altered, sometimes in direct proportion to the degree of malignancy. The literature on the glycosphingolipid composition and immunology of intracranial tumors is reviewed. Some gangliosides induce neuritogenesis and exhibit a trophic effect on nerve cells grown in vitro. In vivo, a particular ganglioside, GM1, reduces cerebral edema and accelerates recovery from injury (traumatic and ischemic) to the peripheral and central nervous systems of laboratory animals. Preliminary clinical studies have shown that treatment with gangliosides may have corresponding effects on lesions of the human peripheral nervous system. Gangliosides have not been tested in human subjects with brain injury.\r"

  ".W": "The pathogenesis of delayed cerebral radiation necrosis was studied histologically and biochemically in 25 dogs with special attention to vascular endothelial cell injuries. The dogs were sacrificed 3 to 30 months after irradiation with a single dose of 15 Gy to the head. Brain specimens were appropriately fixed for light and electron microscopic studies, and capillary endothelial cells were isolated for flow cytometric study. The endothelial cells were stained with acridine orange, then the cell ratios in the reproductive phase (S + G2 + M) were investigated with flow cytometry. Thereafter, Feulgen hydrolysis and computer analysis of the hydrolysis curves were performed to examine the qualitative changes in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of endothelial cells after irradiation. Under light microscopy, spongy degeneration with small cell infiltration was observed, especially in the frontal white matter, at 6 months after irradiation. At 9 months, necrotic foci appeared and developed until 15 months after irradiation. Blood vessels around the necrotic area showed luminal narrowing with endothelial hyperplasia and proliferation. At 30 months, no fresh necrotic lesions were observed. Under electron microscopy, endothelial cells of capillaries and small vessels around the necrotic area showed an increase of pinocytosis, and in the nuclei there was an increase of infoldings and euchromatin. The cell ratios in the reproductive phase were 14.5% to 23.3% (maximum at 9 months) in the irradiated group compared to 6.4% in the control group. The rate constant of apurinic acid production, a parameter correlating with DNA transcriptional activity, was minimum at 3 months and maximum at 9 months after irradiation. The data suggest that impairment of the microcirculation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of delayed radiation necrosis, and that the time of necrosis occurrence closely correlates with the cell cycle of vascular endothelial cells.\r"

The electrodes were excised, the nerves were embedded in Epon, and semithin sections were obtained for histological and planimetric assessment of lesions caused by the epineurially sutured electrodes. The right sciatic nerves served as controls. The total area of neural tissue within the perineurium was determined at three levels: at the site of the electrodes, 8 mm proximal, and 8 mm distal. The area of neural tissue damaged by the surgical procedure was expressed as a percentage of the total area. In Group 1, nine of 12 nerves showed lesions ranging from 0.39% to 25.39% of the total area of neural tissue, in Group 2 eight of 11 sciatic nerves showed lesions ranging from 0.24% to 13.03% of the total area, and in Group 3 five of 12 nerves showed lesions ranging from 0.21% to 4.96% of the total area. The pathologically altered areas in Groups 2 and 3 exhibited distinct signs of nerve fiber regeneration. The reasons for the decrease in damage from Group 1 to Group 3 and the clinical implications of the results for long-term electrical stimulation are discussed.\r"

Control animals received an intracerebral injection without tumor cells. Seven days after implantation, awake rats were infused intravenously for 5 minutes with [9,10(-3)H]-palmitate (6.4 mCi/kg). The rats were killed 20 minutes after initiation of the infusion and coronal brain slices were obtained for quantitative autoradiography and light histological study. Tumor cell masses were histologically well demarcated from the surrounding brain tissue. Tumor tissue incorporation of [9,10(-3)H]-palmitate was heterogeneous, ranging on average from 3.1- to 6.1-fold greater than in the corresponding contralateral brain. In addition, incorporation corresponded to regional tumor cell density. The incorporation rate constant of [9,10(-3)H]-palmitate in tumor was significantly increased compared to control brain and was independent of tumor size. Necrotic areas within tumors showed no incorporation of radiolabeled palmitate. Brain surrounding the tumors and control injection sites showed reactive gliosis, and possessed 30% greater incorporation of [9,10(-3)H]-palmitate than contralateral normal brain. These results suggest that [9,10(-3)H]-palmitate can be used to image brain tumors in vivo, measuring turnover and/or synthesis of tumor and brain lipid.\r"

By insulating nerves and arteries, this silicone rubber sheet has the added advantage of protecting them from injury due to electrical current of bipolar forceps. The silicone rubber sheet described here is smoother, thinner, and lighter than a cotton pattie.\r"

  ".W": "The ideal \"humanization\" of milk substitutes should include the creation of an amino acid pattern closely resembling that of human milk. Because the mixture of proteins in human milk is particularly rich in tryptophan and cysteine and low in methionine, this pattern is difficult to achieve with commercially available proteins. Even whey-predominant formulas only approximate human milk. Human milk has a high concentration of whey protein (70% of total protein). Of this, alpha-lactalbumin, a component of the lactase synthetase complex, accounts for 41% of the whey and 28% of the total protein. Only 3% of the protein in bovine milk is alpha-lactalbumin. Human and bovine alpha-lactalbumin share a 72% amino acid sequence homology. Both proteins contain (wt/wt) 6% tryptophan and 5% cysteine but only 0.9% methionine. Thus the differences in the amino acid compositions of bovine and human milks are largely attributable to differences in their alpha-lactalbumin contents. Commercial availability of bovine alpha-lactalbumin would allow the construction of infant formulas with amino acid compositions that are very close to that of human milk. alpha-Lactalbumin would also be a valuable constituent of diets for patients whose protein intake must be restricted.\r"

Consumption of the four diets caused no difference in weight gain, food intake or plasma malondialdehyde content. The selenium-supplemented rats had significantly higher levels of selenium and glutathione peroxidase activity in plasma. Fish oil feeding decreased ADP-induced platelet aggregation and increased bleeding time. The level of dietary selenium and type of oil interacted to influence the production of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha: more was produced when corn oil was fed in the selenium-deficient diets. These data suggest that the effect of dietary selenium on hemostatic function and the production of eicosanoids is minor.\r"

To investigate mechanisms causing these changes, rats were gavage-fed low-protein (9%) diets with or without BCAA supplements, and the metabolism of another BCAA (valine) was measured in incubated rat epitrochlearis muscles. A 10% leucine supplement (HL-10) inhibited growth; growth remained subnormal even when 2.6% isoleucine and 2.4% valine (HLIV-10) were added to the diet. Valine decarboxylation in muscle increased 170-270% in rats fed the HL-10 or HLIV-10 diets, but was still markedly lower than we previously found in muscle of rats fed a 14% protein diet. Valine incorporation into muscle protein as an estimate of protein synthesis was unaffected by any of the BCAA supplements. When a lower (4%) concentration of leucine (without or with 0.16% isoleucine and 0.16% valine) was studied, growth was also suppressed but only if rats had not been preconditioned to 9% protein. Although increased BCAA decarboxylation in muscle caused by excess dietary leucine contributes to low valine and isoleucine pools, abnormal growth appears to be independent of low valine and isoleucine levels and is not reflected in suppression of valine incorporation into muscle protein.\r"

Blood glucose reached constant levels after 1 to 2 h of refeeding. The increase in plasma insulin paralleled food intake rather than the increase in blood glucose. Plasma triglycerides decreased upon refeeding starch, maltose and malt extract and increased with sucrose and fructose. Recovery of absorbed carbohydrates was highest in rats refed malt extract. Glycogen deposition in muscle was highest in rats fed malt extract and lowest in those fed fructose; sucrose yielded intermediate values. Glucose, maltose and starch resulted in muscle glycogen depositions slightly lower than those obtained with malt extract. In liver, sucrose and fructose were better precursors for glycogen than glucose and starch. With carbohydrates containing only glucose units, much more glycogen was found to be deposited in total muscle than in liver. This asymmetry was less notable or even was reversed with sucrose and fructose. Glycogen deposition in muscle and in liver is influenced by the carbohydrate used for refeeding, and muscle, rather than liver, is the main glycogen storing tissue.\r"

The rate and extent of starch hydrolysis were both significantly lower in uncooked rolled oats than in the same material after brief boiling or extrusion cooking. A similar degree of maldigestion in vivo would lead to as much as an estimated 68% of oat starch entering the colon. Breath-hydrogen measurements were used to compare the fermentable carbohydrate content of uncooked and briefly boiled rolled oats in human volunteers and to estimate the relative contributions of soluble dietary fiber and undigested starch to the fermented component. Isolated oat gum (beta-glucan) was readily fermented in vivo and was apparently the main fermentable component of cooked rolled oats. Uncooked rolled oats gave a higher excess hydrogen production than cooked oats, but the results were variable and the differences not statistically significant. In an additional experiment, lactulose was used as a fermentable reference material to calculate the apparent fermentable carbohydrate content of rolled oats and oat gum. Uncooked rolled oats were estimated to contain a statistically significant quantity of undigested starch, amounting at most to 1.01 +/- 0.40 g (mean +/- SEM) of undigested starch per 50 g of fresh weight. We concluded that starch hydrolysis in oats is limited to some extent by the physical state of the food matrix, but this effect may be greatly overestimated by simulated digestion procedures in vitro.\r"

Plasma pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) concentration became lower with increasing age, with the largest decrease in the 1st yr of life. An age-related change in vitamin B-6 distribution between the various tissues examined was observed: B-6 vitamer content increased in heart and brain, whereas PLP content decreased in gastrocnemius muscle, kidney and liver. The decrease in muscle PLP content occurred in concert with a decrease in muscle glycogen phosphorylase activity. Urinary 4-pyridoxic acid (4-PA) excretion increased with age, especially in female rats, in parallel with an increase in liver pyridoxal oxidase and pyridoxal dehydrogenase activities. Age-related changes in vitamin B-6 distribution were probably not causally related to changes in activity of vitamin B-6 metabolizing enzymes; they were regarded as consequences of changes in protein metabolism. The higher urinary 4-PA excretion in older rats may reflect a lower vitamin B-6 requirement; however, the lower PLP content of gastrocnemius muscle may indicate an age-related decrease in vitamin B-6 body stores.\r"

Altogether, 56% of the variance in blood pressure measurements at wk 7 could be predicted on the basis of urinary chloride excretion during wk 7 and kidney weight as a percentage of body weight and kidney sodium concentration, but only 30% of the variance in blood pressure measurements at wk 16 could be predicted on the basis of urinary chloride excretion during wk 16 and kidney sodium concentrations.\r"

The in situ perfused guinea pig placenta model was used to study the influence of zinc-binding ligands in fetal circulation on maternofetal placental zinc transfer. A placenta of each anesthetized sow was perfused (on the fetal side) with a physiological perfusate via the umbilical vessels, with the fetus excluded. The sow was infused intravenously with 65Zn as a tracer of placental zinc clearance and with antipyrine as an indirect indicator of maternal placental blood flow. Maternal plasma and placental effluent samples collected at intervals were counted for 65Zn with a gamma counter, and the absorbance of nitrosated antipyrine was measured at 350 nm. The addition of physiological levels of zinc-binding ligands (albumin, L-histidine and L-cysteine) to the perfusate increased the relative maternofetal clearance of zinc across the placenta calculated as zinc clearance/antipyrine clearance [mean +/- SEM; 0.113 +/- 0.016 vs. 0.062 +/- 0.012; ligands vs. no ligands; n = 8; P less than 0.05]. The results suggest that the availability of zinc-binding ligands in fetal circulation is one determinant factor of placental zinc transfer.\r"

For the other experiments, rats were fed natural sources of Se without added selenite until adult age and then either subjected to acute Se restriction during the 7 d of measurements or maintained on a Se-sufficient diet. For the animals fed the selenite diet, the 7-d average ratio of WSe-EMP:total body Se (Se(end),0) was 0.370 +/- 0.009, which was not significantly different from the corresponding value (0.350 +/- 0.018, P greater than 0.05) for the Se-deficient group. When the group mean values of WSe-EMP were correlated with the corresponding mean values of Se(end),0 for all experiments, we obtained highly linear relations (r2 greater than 0.96). When WSe-EMP for each animal was correlated with the corresponding value of total body endogenous Se (Se(end)) or liver Se(end) (for t = 1 or 7 d), we found equally strong linear relations (r2 greater than or equal to 0.99). We concluded that WSe-EMP accurately reflected total body Se content or the Se content of such organs as liver, regardless of past Se intake, chemical form of Se or age and size of the animals.\r"

Leucine was low and other IAA were high when dietary IAA were 125% and leucine was 65% of requirements; higher leucine and lower IAA concentrations occurred when dietary IAA were 75% of requirements. Tissue leucine was high and isoleucine and valine were low in rats fed excess leucine. Norleucine induced dose-dependent reductions in BCAA, especially in brain and muscle in which isoleucine or valine were sometimes undetectable. Leucine was not depressed further when control values were low as in the rats fed 125% IAA. Norleucine frequently prevented the high BCAA found after feeding additional BCAA. Other LNAA tended to be low in the brain and muscle of rats fed norleucine. Lysine was high only in the tissues of rats fed 75% IAA and norleucine; this effect was prevented when added leucine was given. Brain tryptophan, but not always serotonin, was low in rats fed norleucine. The results show transport-related, selective and usually marked depletions of tissue BCAA in rats fed norleucine; this suggests norleucine may be an aid in the treatment of clinical conditions involving excesses of BCAA.\r"

In the fasting (16 h) and fed state, insulin binding to liver membranes and insulin receptor affinity (50% inhibition of tracer binding, range: 5-7 ng/mL at 4 degrees C) were very similar in fat and lean chickens. Insulin degrading activity of membranes was negligible for both genotypes. Following solubilization with Triton X-100, liver receptors were purified either on wheat germ agglutinin (WGA receptors) or on lentil then wheat germ lectins (lentil receptors). Both types of purified receptors exhibited the same binding affinity, independent of the genotype or the nutritional state. Autophosphorylation and IRK activity toward artificial substrate poly(Glu, Tyr)4:1 were not different between genotypes. Basal IRK (i.e., in the absence of insulin) was decreased by the overnight fast. Fattening of genetically fat chickens cannot be accounted for by an increase in the number or the kinase activity of liver insulin receptors. Steps following the binding or the receptor kinase may be involved.\r"

Thermogenic activity of BAT is a function of the environmental temperature. If a relationship exists, it follows that the increased energetic efficiency of VMH-lesioned rats likewise should be governed by temperature. We have therefore investigated the energy balance of normal and VMH-lesioned rats housed at 30 degrees C and 10 degrees C. Experiments at differing feeding levels allowed calculation of maintenance energy requirements and the net energetic efficiencies of each group. VMH-lesioned rats at thermoneutrality (30 degrees C) accumulated more body fat at all feeding levels than did normal rats. Maintenance energy requirement was reduced, but the net energetic efficiency did not differ significantly from normal. The reduced maintenance energy requirement of lesioned rats persisted at 10 degrees C. Net energetic efficiency decreased in normal rats acclimated to cold but increased in the lesioned group. The difference was significant (P less than 0.05). The cold-induced increase in interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) oxidative capacity of VMH-lesioned rats was only half that of normal rats. Differences in BAT thermogenesis may be the basis for the differing temperature effects on net energetic efficiency.\r"

Excess of insufficient vitamin A led to increased susceptibility of chicks of E. coli infection; this was accompanied by depressed immune responses. Chicks receiving excess vitamin A were more sensitive to E. coli than vitamin A-depleted chicks. This was reflected in higher mortality and morbidity rates and in severely depressed immune responses. In contrast to chicks receiving excess vitamin A, T lymphocyte responses (though not antibody responses) of vitamin A-depleted chicks achieved levels similar to those of vitamin A-sufficient birds with a lag period of 6 to 10 d. Therefore, reduction in resistance to E. coli infection, resulting from vitamin A excess or deficiency, probably was compounded by a delayed immune response.\r"

  ".W": "The phenomenon loosely labeled hunger in the 1980s is now being discussed as food security or insecurity. Food security is defined as access by all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life, and at a minimum includes the following: 1) the ready availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods and 2) the assured ability to acquire personally acceptable foods in a socially acceptable way. Food insecurity exists whenever food security is limited or uncertain. The measurement of food insecurity at the household or individual level involves the measurement of those quantitative, qualitative, psychological and social or normative constructs that are central to the experience of food insecurity, qualified by their involuntariness and periodicity. Risk factors for food insecurity include any factors that affect household resources and the proportion of those resources available for food acquisition. Potential consequences of food insecurity include hunger, malnutrition and (either directly or indirectly) negative effects on health and quality of life. The precise relationships between food insecurity and its risk factors and potential consequences need much more research now that there is an emerging consensus on the definition and measurement of food insecurity. Indicators of food security or insecurity are proposed as a necessary component of the core measures of the nutritional state of individuals, communities or nations.\r"

This definition includes subgroups of the United States population that are at increased risk of adverse health effects associated with malnutrition. Examples include persons who are rare (pregnant women), difficult to locate (migrant farm workers), difficult to enumerate (homeless individuals) or difficult to interview (substance abusers). Probability methods to sample rare and elusive populations are reviewed briefly. Methods include disproportionately allocated sampling, multiplicity sampling and the use of multiple frames. The advantages and disadvantages of nonprobability sampling methods are compared using criteria typically applied to assess alternative probability sampling methods. The cost of data collection alone may prohibit consideration of probability sampling methods, but caution is urged before abandoning this statistically sound approach to sample selection. Considerations for sampling the difficult-to-sample are illustrated for one such population, the homeless.\r"

  ".W": "Compromise of antimicrobial defenses by irradiation can result in sepsis and death. Additional trauma can further predispose patients to infection and thus increase mortality. We recently showed that injection of synthetic trehalose dicorynomycolate (S-TDCM) significantly augments resistance to infection and increases survival of mice compromised either by whole-body irradiation with gamma radiation or equal mixtures of fission neutron and gamma radiation. In this study, C3H/HeN mice were given a lethal dose of gamma radiation (8.0 Gy) and an open wound (15% total body surface area [TBSA]) 1 hr later while anesthetized. Irradiated/wounded mice became more severely leukopenic and thrombocytopenic than mice exposed to radiation alone, and died from natural wound infection and sepsis within 7 days. S-TDCM given 1 hr postirradiation increased survival of mice exposed to radiation alone. However, this treatment did not increase survival of the irradiated/wounded mice. Systemic antibiotic therapy with gentamicin or ofloxacin for 10 days significantly increased survival time compared with untreated irradiated/wounded mice (p less than 0.01). Combination therapy with topical gentamicin cream and systemic oxacillin increased survival from 0% to 100%. Treatment with S-TDCM combined with the suboptimal treatment of topical and systemic gentamicin increased survival compared with antibiotic treatment alone. These studies demonstrate that post-trauma therapy with S-TDCM and antibiotics augments resistance to infection in immunocompromised mice. The data suggest that therapies which combine stimulation of nonspecific host defense mechanisms with antibiotics may increase survival of irradiated patients inflicted with accidental or surgical trauma.\r"

Knee range of motion in 28 acute traumatic cases was on average 127.5 +/- 23.0 degrees. The significant complications included: nail breakage, 3.2% (1/31); nonunion without nail breakage, 9.7% (3/31); neglected femoral fracture with malunion, 3.2% (1/31). The interlocking nailing has the advantages of: a) closed method, b) weight-sharing principle, c) shortening prevention, d) non-rigid fixation. From the theoretical and clinical comparison among the various implants, we conclude that closed interlocking nailing is one of the better instruments for subtrochanteric fracture treatment, and moreover, the most reasonable of all. However, for the higher level subtrochanteric fractures, reconstruction-style locking nails should be chosen.\r"

The degenerative lesions increased proportionally to the amount of meniscal tissue resected and the duration of observation. These lesions proved to be more intense at the tibial plateau compared to the femoral condyle. For both joint surfaces the predominant location was the central zone. Considering the degenerative process by the articular cartilage after total meniscectomy, maximum preservation of meniscal tissue is recommended.\r"

In contrast, computerized tomography (CT) demonstrated 103 lesions in 90 patients. MRI was superior to CT in the diagnosis of nonhemorrhagic contusions demonstrated as a high-intensity area on T2-weighted imaging.

The deficit of CD4CD29 cell numbers may be due to impaired maturation of these particular CD4 lymphocytes and may explain diminished PHA-induced proliferation in small children. The significantly higher B-lymphocyte counts of splenectomized children (21%, n = 11; 558 cells/mm3, n = 10) compared with 12 normal children (14%; 329 cells/mm3) may be due to loss of the reservoir function of the spleen.\r"

Conversely, similar treatment of another group of burned rats with the long-acting beta-adrenergic antagonist, nadolol, reduced muscle mass, while having no effect on resting energy expenditure, body weight gain, or muscle protein content. These results demonstrate that hypermetabolism does not invariably result in loss of lean body mass and suggest that clenbuterol may be useful in preserving muscle mass and protein in catabolic diseases.\r"

Patients were intubated by either a surgeon (n = 47) or anesthesiologist (n = 53), and paralyzed with either vecuronium (n = 59) or succinylcholine (n = 41). Nasal intubation was used in 40 patients, oral in 57, and cricothyroidotomy in three. Ninety-four patients with suspected head injuries had a CT scan performed. Fifty-five (59%) had a positive scan and 15 required emergent neurosurgical intervention. Only two patients had lateral cervical spine roentgenograms before intubation; seven patients were eventually found to have cervical fractures. No patient suffered a neurologic deficit. One patient developed aspiration pneumonia following intubation. The three failed intubations occurred in patients with multiple facial fractures. We conclude that induced paralysis and intubation in the ED is safe, can facilitate the diagnostic workup, and may be a potentially life-saving maneuver in combative trauma patients.\r"

Radiologically, the post-traumatic intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and brainstem hemorrhage usually coexisted with a poor outcome. Old age (greater than 60), abnormal pupil reaction, impaired oculocephalic response, and abnormal motor response to pain stimuli are reliable clinical hallmarks for poor prognosis.\r"

In this study splenic artery ligation (SAL) was performed as an adjunct to successful splenorrhaphy in 20 adults suffering blunt splenic injury. There were no deaths and no reoperations. Twenty units of blood were transfused in ten patients. Splenic removal of blood-borne opsonized particles was measured as the clearance of anti-Rh-antibody-coated 51Cr-radiolabeled autologous red blood cells from the circulation in five SAL patients and nine normal volunteers. The clearance of opsonized red cells 120 minutes after injection was not different (40 +/- 7% of injected dose in controls, 40 +/- 4% in SAL patients). These results demonstrate that SAL can safely be applied as an adjunct to splenorrhaphy and that SAL does not diminish splenic clearance of opsonized particles from the circulation.\r"

However, over the last several decades increasing numbers of AOD survivors have been identified. Although many of these patients initially demonstrate profound neurologic deficits, a number who survive have regained most or all neurologic functions, indicating that they did not suffer mechanical disruption of the spinal cord at the time of AOD. In the survivors, a growing body of evidence indicates that many of the initial neurologic deficits are related to vascular injury to the carotid or vertebral arteries and their branches. We recently encountered three AOD survivors with no evidence of mechanical injury to the spinal cord in which angiography demonstrated vascular injury to the internal carotid artery in the form of vasospasm in one case and to the vertebral arteries in the forms of focal stenosis at the site of dural penetration, focal stenosis and distal vasospasm, and focal stenosis with distal intimal flap and dissection in one case each. Autopsy after one of the three died after cardiac arrest demonstrated diffuse infarction of the cerebrum, cerebellum, midbrain, brainstem, and upper cervical spinal cord without evidence of mechanical laceration or transection of the spinal cord. Recovery of neurologic function in two cases following prompt immobilization and angiography suggests that neurologic deficits secondary to vascular injury are potentially reversible.\r"

All of the children had other clinical evidence of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus that was documented prior to the diagnosis of PCP or found at the time of PCP diagnosis. Most patients who presented to the hospital were acutely ill, and complications of treatment occurred in 70%. Overall, 89% of the patients died and 70% survived for less than 6 months after diagnosis of PCP. Median survival after the diagnosis of PCP was only 2.0 months and the median life span of children with PCP was only 14.4 months. Only 40% of children with PCP had CD4 lymphocyte counts at or below the threshold for institution of PCP prophylaxis in adults of 200 x 10(6) cells/L (200 cells/mm3).\r"

Of 21 perinatally HIV-infected children with PCP only 10 (48%) had CD4 T-lymphocyte counts that were less than 500 x 10(6) cells/L (500 cells/mm3), compared with all 18 who were infected via blood transfusions or clotting factors. Among 68 children who were 1 year or younger, 18 (90%) of 20 PCP cases had CD4 T-lymphocyte counts that were less than 1500 x 10(6) cells/L (1500 cells/mm3) compared with only five (10%) of 48 children who did not have the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (odds ratio, 77.4; 95% confidence interval, 19.7 to 313.4). The mean CD4 T-lymphocyte count was lower for the 39 PCP cases when compared with the 188 children who were at different stages of HIV infection and did not have the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) independent of age. The majority of perinatally HIV-infected children with PCP were 6 months or younger and 50% were previously unknown to be infected. Thus, HIV-positive children should be identified early and followed closely. CD4 T-lymphocyte counts may be useful in monitoring HIV-positive children and determining when to begin PCP prophylaxis.\r"

Following standardized procedures, residual dried-blood specimens collected on filter paper for newborn metabolic screening were tested anonymously in state public health laboratories for maternal antibody to HIV. As of September 1990, annual survey data were available from 38 states and the District of Columbia. The highest HIV seroprevalence rates were observed in New York (5.8 per 1000), the District of Columbia (5.5 per 1000), New Jersey (4.9 per 1000), and Florida (4.5 per 1000). Nationwide, an estimated 1.5 per 1000 women giving birth to infants in 1989 were infected with HIV. Assuming a perinatal transmission rate of 30%, we estimate that approximately 1800 newborns acquired HIV infection during one 12-month period. Preventing transmission of HIV infection to women and infants is an urgent public health priority.\r"

From November 1985 through October 1989, 429 HIV seroconversions were detected among 718,780 soldiers who contributed 1,088,447 person-years of follow-up time (HIV seroconversion rate, 0.39 per 1000 person-years). Period-specific seroconversion rates declined significantly from 0.49 per 1000 person-years (November 1985 through October 1987) to 0.33 per 1000 person-years (November 1987 through October 1988) to 0.29 per 1000 person-years (November 1988 through October 1989). The HIV seroconversion risk among active-duty soldiers was significantly associated with race/ethnic group, age, gender, and marital status. Based on these trends, we estimate that approximately 220 soldiers (95% confidence interval, 160 to 297 soldiers) were infected with HIV during 1989 and 1990, with potentially fewer in future years.\r"

  ".W": "Although tuberculosis (TB) has been recognized as a significant health problem of migrant farm workers, the nature and extent of the problem have been poorly defined. We report the first population-based study of TB in a random sample of farm workers (n = 543) and the first use of recall antigens in an epidemiologic study of TB. Purified protein derivative positivity ranged from 33% in Hispanics to 54% in US-born blacks and 76% in Haitians. Active tubercular disease occurred in 3.6% of US-born blacks and 0.47% of Hispanics. Among US-born blacks, risk factors associated with farm work were most significant. Blacks born in the United States also had the highest prevalence of anergy. The use of recall antigens made possible a better description of the epidemiology of TB by excluding false negatives and clarifying associations between infection and risk factors. We conclude that TB among farm workers represents a serious public health problem with previously unrecognized risk factors. Additional resources for migrant health care, improvements in health care access, and fundamental changes in the system of migrant labor are all necessary to reduce the transmission of TB.\r"

  ".W": "Untreated 16-week-old MRL/MpJ-lpr/lpr (lpr) mice, when compared to congenic MRL/MpJ-+/+ (+/+) mice, are characterized by a systemic lupus erythematosus syndrome, including severe glomerulonephritis, proteinuria and reduction of renal function. We hypothesized that platelet activating factor (PAF), a potent chemotactic and proinflammatory phospholipid mediator synthesized and released by circulating cells, glomerular mesangial and renal medullary interstitial cells, may play a role in the development of renal injury in lupus mice. We assessed renal PAF synthesis in lpr as well as +/+ mice and the effect of treatment with a PAF receptor blocking agent. Treatment with the PAF receptor antagonist L659,989 for four weeks, starting at 12 weeks of age, significantly reduced acute glomerular infiltration and proliferation, and prevented chronic glomerular histological changes; proteinuria and serum creatinine levels were also significantly reduced in treated mice. Renal PAF production was increased in lpr when compared to +/+ mice, and treatment with L659,989 restored renal PAF synthesis to the control levels. Our results support the hypothesis that PAF can be one of the mediators of glomerular injury characteristic of murine lupus nephritis, and indicate the possible therapeutic utility of PAF receptor antagonists in immunologic renal diseases.\r"

  ".W": "Mesangial cell (MC) proliferation is an early pathologic alteration characteristic of many forms of immune mediated glomerulonephritis. The intracapillary position, contractile capacity, and production of cytokines and other inflammatory molecules place MC in a pivotal position to initiate, mediate, and direct glomerular damage. We as well as others have noted increased levels of cytokines including IFN gamma, TNF, and IL-1 and the cell surface MHC class II and ICAM-1 molecules in the kidneys of mice with lupus nephritis. MHC class II and ICAM-1 molecules are central to the interaction of T cells with antigen presenting cells (APC). Since cytokines can increase both MHC class II and ICAM-1 molecules, we investigated whether mesangial cells could function as APC or accessory cells after cytokine stimulation. For these studies we established a permanent MC line through transformation with origin-deficient SV40 DNA. Surface expression of ICAM-1 was similar in untransformed MC as well as SV40 transformed MC from normal mice and in untransformed cells from mice with lupus nephritis. Basal expression of ICAM-1 was upregulated rapidly by IFN gamma, TNF, and IL-1. MHC class II expression could not be induced with TNF or IL-1 alone but required prolonged stimulation with IFN gamma. MC adhered and presented antigen to an antigen specific IaK restricted T cell hybridoma. Anti-ICAM-1 mAb decreased adhesion and antigen presentation of cytokine stimulated MC. By comparison, MHC class II mAb abrogated antigen presentation by MC bearing MHC class II but did not block adhesion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The aim of this study was to assess whether PHA similarly enhances rabbit monocyte-dependent experimental, acute immune complex glomerulonephritis, and whether this effect is associated with local release of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Rabbits with experimental acute serum sickness (AcSS: Group I) had focal proliferative and exudative glomerulonephritis with immune deposits, scattered subepithelial electron-dense deposits (humps), mild and transient proteinuria, normal creatinine clearance and slightly increased production of IL-1 and TNF from isolated glomeruli. Rabbits with AcSS and injected with PHA (Group II) developed severe lymphocyte and blast cell glomerulonephritis with diffuse endothelial damage; immune deposits were significantly reduced, focal subepithelial electron-dense deposits were absent, proteinuria was increased, creatinine clearance was decreased and production of IL-1 and TNF was markedly augmented as compared to rabbits in Group I. Rabbits with AcSS and injected with IL-1 beta and TNF alpha (Group V) had lesions comparable to those seen in Group II. These results show that PHA, IL-1 and TNF enhance the severity of acute immune complex glomerulonephritis, presumably by activating glomerular endothelial and mesangial cells and resident or infiltrated leukocytes.\r"

Activated macrophages accumulate in glomeruli and are responsible for injury in experimental immune complex glomerulonephritis. We examined NO2- production by isolated glomeruli and urinary NO2- in accelerated nephrotoxic nephritis in the rat. Normal glomeruli did not produce NO2- spontaneously or when stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (1 microgram/ml) or A23187 (2 microgram/ml). Cultured mesangial cells at first or seventh passage did not produce NO2- spontaneously or when stimulated. Nephritic glomeruli spontaneously produced NO2 at all times studied; this production was maximal at 24 hours after induction of glomerulonephritis (158.4 +/- 8.4 nmol/48 hr/ml, N = 3). The production of NO2- was inhibited 75 to 100% by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), and this inhibition was reversed by L-arginine, indicating NO2- production from L-arginine via NO. The production of NO2- was increased by LPS (1 microgram/ml) at 2, 7 and 21 days. NO2- was undetectable in normal rat urine; however, it was present in urine of rats with glomerulonephritis (Day 0 to 1:8161 +/- 2605 nmol/24 hr. N = 12). The production of NO in nephritic glomeruli may have implications for both the mechanism of glomerular injury and glomerular hemodynamics.\r"

  ".W": "As abnormalities of active cation transport could contribute to the genesis of uremic cardiomyopathy, we investigated myocardial sodium pump function in rats with acute renal failure (ARF) and with a model of experimental chronic renal failure (CRF) that has metabolic similarities to advanced chronic uremia in humans. CRF rats were hypertensive and had left ventricular hypertrophy (33% higher heart:body weight ratio; P less than 0.01) at four weeks compared to pair-fed sham-operated rats. Importantly, both ouabain- and furosemide-sensitive 86Rb uptake rates were unchanged in left ventricular myocardial slices from CRF, and the intracellular sodium concentration was not different from that of control rats even though skeletal muscle sodium was increased, as we found previously (J Clin Invest 81:1197, 1988). Insulin-stimulated, ouabain-sensitive 86Rb influx was also preserved. There also were no abnormalities in myocardium cation transport in rats with ARF. However, [3H]ouabain binding was decreased 45% in CRF rats (P less than 0.01); it was unchanged in acute uremia. Decreased ouabain binding in chronic uremia was due entirely to fewer low affinity [3H]ouabain binding sites (the binding affinity for ouabain was unaffected). We conclude that in chronic, (but not acute) renal failure, sodium pump number is reduced in myocardium but intracellular sodium is unchanged and active cation flux rates are maintained. These results emphasize that in rats with chronic uremia, intracellular sodium homeostasis is preserved in myocardium, despite the presence of marked abnormalities of active cation transport in skeletal muscle that are characteristic of chronic uremia.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effect of three antihypertensive drugs on the growth of glomeruli in four- to five-week-old Munich-Wistar rats (N = 24), which were undergoing rapid maturation processes. Young rats were given an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI, enalapril, 50 mg/liter drinking water), verapamil (50 mg/liter) or hydralazine (80 mg/liter) or no treatment for six weeks. Body weight increased comparably in the treatment groups and age-matched controls, reaching on average 197 +/- 11, 214 +/- 12 and 198 +/- 3 g in ACEI-, verapamil- and hydralazine-treated rats, respectively, versus 218 +/- 6 g in control rats. Glomerular hemodynamic patterns, including glomerular capillary pressure, measured in maturing rats after one and six weeks of ACEI treatment were unaffected by ACEI. Mean planar area of glomeruli (PAmean) achieved was smaller than control in ACEI rats (6.60 +/- 0.20 x 10(-3) mm2 vs. 5.37 +/- 0.22, respectively, P less than 0.005), but not in rats treated with other antihypertensive drugs. Furthermore, the maturational PAmean increase in rats given ACEI for six weeks was, on average, only half of that achieved by age-matched controls not given ACEI, in contrast to normal maturational growth with hydralazine or verapamil (29% increase in PAmean from normal baseline in ACEI vs. 52%, 53% and 59% increases in verapamil, hydralazine and control, respectively). In contrast, comparable PAmean values were found in adults with (7.08 +/- 0.22 x 10(-3)mm2, N = 6) and without (6.98 +/- 0.33 x 10(-3)mm2, N = 6) ACEI treatment given for six weeks. Therefore, ACEI, but not verapamil and hydralazine, causes growth retardation in maturing glomeruli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Immune complexes are formed in situ at the base of these cells in rats injected with antisera to TH. The renal binding of I125-anti-TH was determined in pair label studies. Kidneys and other organs were removed from groups of rats for isotope counting at four hours to 14 days after an injection of I125-anti-TH and I131-normal rabbit IgG. The greatest total renal anti-TH binding after injection of 500 micrograms of anti-TH was observed at 24 hours in normal rats (18.55 +/- 1.6 micrograms). During the period of most rapid clearance (day 2 to day 7) the half life of renal anti-TH binding (84.2 hours) and the half life of anti-TH in the serum (68.5 hours) were shorter than that of IgG in the serum (117.8 hours). There was no substantial uptake of anti-TH by other organs. A close relationship between serum levels and renal uptake of anti-TH at 24 hours was also observed in rats given from 50 to 6000 micrograms of anti-TH; renal saturation was evident only at the highest dose. This close relationship was also present during the clearance phase in rats injected with 3700 micrograms of anti-TH; the half life of anti-TH was 96.2 hours in kidneys and 110 hours in serum while the half life of rabbit IgG in serum was 151.8 hours. Markedly increased renal uptake of anti-TH was observed in protein-uric rats with passive Heymann nephritis. In very proteinuric rats, 14.1% of the injected dose was bound to kidneys at 24 hours. In these rats, serum anti-TH levels decreased very rapidly to 4% of control serum levels by five days. Throughout the period of study, the serum levels of anti-TH determined by direct radiometric assay corresponded very closely to those obtained by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Urinary excretion was a major mechanism for the clearance of anti-TH in proteinuric rats; more than 10% of the injected I125-anti-TH was recovered intact (that is, protein bound) during the first day after injection. During the clearance phase for renal deposits, urinary clearance of anti-TH exceeded urinary clearance of IgG due to release of renal bound antibody into urine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The distribution and functions of TGF-beta in vivo are less well known. We utilized several different techniques including northern blots, a CCl-64 cell growth inhibition assay, and sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (SELISA) to examine the expression of TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 in rat glomeruli. High levels of TGF-beta 1 mRNA and protein were found in glomeruli (56 +/- 22 ng TGF-beta 1/g tissue). These levels were several-fold higher than those present in whole kidney (10 +/- 5 ng/g). TGF-beta 2 mRNA was present in glomeruli but was not detected in whole kidney. TGF-beta 2 concentrations by SELISA were 19 +/- 8 ng TGF-beta 2/g in glomeruli and less than 5 ng/g in whole kidney. Since TGF-beta has such marked effects on cell growth, we also examined whether alterations in TGF-beta expression were associated with the renal hypertrophy which follows unilateral nephrectomy. Expression of TGF-beta 1 mRNA decreased in glomeruli following nephrectomy. However, this was not associated with a significant fall in glomerular TGF-beta 1 protein concentration. Whole kidney levels of TGF-beta 1 and its mRNA were unchanged following nephrectomy. Similar results were obtained for TGF-beta 2. Our data document the presence of high concentrations of TGF-beta 1 and beta 2 and their corresponding mRNAs in normal rat glomeruli. These results suggest that TGF-beta may play important regulatory roles in the normal glomerulus.\r"

Deficient diets imposed for six weeks on three-week-old weanling rats led to no significant differences in body weights, serum creatinine, GFR, RBF, TmPAH or urinary total protein excretory rates prior to ischemia. Twenty-four hours after one hour of ischemia, animals on the deficient diet demonstrated more markedly impaired GFR, RBF, TmPAH and urine to plasma creatinine concentrations and an increased renal failure index. Tubular damage was more severe injury in the deficient animals. Lipid peroxidation, 15 minutes after the release of the ischemic clamp, was increased in the deficient animals. We confirmed the effects of our dietary manipulation in impairing the oxidant scavenging system in the deficient animals since glutathione peroxidase activity was reduced to less than 5% in the basal state, and this striking reduction persisted following ischemia. Plasma vitamin E concentrations were also markedly depressed in the deficient diets. This dietary deficiency also worsened the course of acute renal injury and was accompanied by 50% mortality compared to 0% mortality in the control animals. Thus, dietary deficiency of vitamin E and selenium led to greater structural and functional renal impairment and increased lipid peroxidation following ischemia. These data provide support for the role of reactive oxygen species in mediating ischemia-reperfusion injury.\r"
