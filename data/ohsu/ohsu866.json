  ".W": "Administration of the indirect agonist L-dopa, the nonselective direct agonist apomorphine, or the selective D2 agonist (+)-PHNO, reversed parkinsonism and induced locomotor activation in MPTP-treated squirrel monkeys. In contrast, administration of the selective partial D1 agonist SKF38393 did not induce locomotor activity, but rather decreased activity. Choreiform movements were observed only following treatment with L-dopa. Coadministration of the D1 antagonist SCH23390 prevented L-dopa-induced chorea at the time of peak effect. However, a rebound exaggeration of chorea was observed following SCH 23390 at the time when chorea induced by L-dopa alone would normally be subsiding. Unlike chorea, dystonia could be induced by treatment with either L-dopa or (+)-PHNO. Administration of apomorphine failed to significantly induce dystonia, although a small increase was observed with the highest dose. Treatment with SKF38393 actually decreased dystonia. Our findings clearly indicate that D2 receptor stimulation appears essential for antiparkinsonian activity, and also implicate D2 receptors in the genesis of dystonia, but not chorea. D1 receptor stimulation appears to be involved in the genesis of chorea and possibly also dystonia.\r"

Compared with the area of acetylcholine receptors identified by bound alpha-bungarotoxin, the strong desmin immunoreactivity occupied a slightly larger area and was localized slightly deeper in the muscle fiber, suggesting that desmin might be accumulated within the postsynaptic folds and possibly below the folds. This appears to be the first identification of a protein unrelated to cholinergic transmission accumulated at human NMJs.\r"

Perfect agreement on the assignment of the disability scores ranged from 48% (cerebellar functional group) to 69% (EDSS and pyramidal functional group). Only 31% to 62% of this agreement occurred independently of that expected by chance (kappa). With the exception of the cerebellar and sensory functional groups, agreement within 1 step occurred in at least 92% of cases. These findings suggest that differences of a single step on these scales may not reflect an important functional change. We recommend that at least a 2-step change (1.0 point on the EDSS and 2 points on the FS) is needed to be confident of an important change in the degree of disability or response to treatment in this disease.\r"

Hemodynamic changes due to irradiation were followed up in the ipsilateral ophthalmic artery with transcranial Doppler sonography. Scarring was also demonstrated by fluorescein angiography and A- and B-scan ultrasonography. Irradiation caused the narrowing and later the occlusion of the precapillaries and capillaries (i.e. the resistance vessels) and that of the shunts inside the angioma; consequently, vascular resistance increased. Transcranial Doppler sonographic recordings showed a decrease in blood flow velocity as compared to pathologically increased blood flow velocity in angiomas, and a gradual increase in vascular resistance which was lower before treatment.\r"

Initial success rates of percutaneous transluminal (balloon) angioplasty are very high and increasing, and restenosis rates are acceptable and decreasing. The procedure is economical and has a short convalescent period and low patient risk. Physicians should be aware that underuse of medical technology may be as costly as overuse.

At 36 months there was no significant difference between control and treatment groups in plasma creatinine, creatinine clearance or 24-h excretion of protein. At between three and six months serum albumin concentrations were higher and protein excretions lower in the treatment group compared to controls.

Excised tumor specimens were stained by the indirect immunoperoxidase method with anti-BrdU monoclonal antibodies to determine the BrdU labeling index, or percentage of S-phase cells. The BrdU labeling index ranged from 0.1% to 3.1% (mean, 0.9%). The BrdU labeling index was greater than 1.5% in four of the 21 tumors (three trigeminal and one spinal). One acoustic tumor in a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1 had a labeling index of 1.3%, which was the highest among the acoustic tumors. The BrdU labeling indices did not correlate with the patient's age, tumor size, or the duration of signs and symptoms. There was no significant difference between the BrdU labeling indices of Antoni type A and Antoni type B tissue. The low BrdU labeling index of most of the intracranial neurilemomas coincides well with the slow growth of these tumors.

The cells appeared only in the nodal sinuses and occurred predominantly as single individual cells and small clusters. The nuclei were bland, the N/C ratio was low, and the cell borders were well defined. So-called mesothelial windows were noted when cells formed groups; mitoses were not observed. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated the inclusions to be positive for cytokeratin (both AE1/3 and CAM5.2) but negative for epithelial membrane antigen, Leu-M1, and carcinoembryonic antigen. Nearly all cells were negative for B72.3; rare cells in one case contained unusual minute granular dot-like positivity in the region of the Golgi for this marker. The pattern of cytokeratin immunoreactivity was consistent with a mesothelial cell: namely, stronger immunoreactivity in a perinuclear location with some fading at the cell periphery. Ultrastructural analysis of both cases documented long microvilli processes consistent with a mesothelial origin. An extensive clinical workup in each case has failed to identify a primary carcinoma. It is interesting that both patients had a pleuritis with pleural effusion and both had mediastinal widening. In the first case, the exact cause of the benign pleural process was unknown but thought to be infectious. The second patient had follicular lymphoma in the same lymph node together with pleural involvement clinically and evidence of congestive heart failure. The patients are alive three years and ten months from diagnosis, respectively. Recognition of this new and previously unrecognized entity is important to prevent a diagnosis of carcinoma in such rare instances.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the utility of Southern blot analysis for fine-needle aspiration samples, the authors prospectively analyzed immunoglobulin, T-cell receptor, c-myc, and bcl-2 gene rearrangements in 27 cases of known or suspected lymphoma. Adequate DNA for analysis was obtained from 20 of 27 cases (74%), including 18 of 22 (82%) with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Patients whose tumors showed sclerosis, cellular degeneration, or necrosis yielded inadequate DNA. Of the 18 NHLs with successful Southern blot studies, 17 tumors had a B-cell lineage and one was an adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma; clonal integration of the human T-cell leukemia virus I (HTLV-I) genome was present in the latter case. Four cases had bcl-2 rearrangements and two had c-myc rearrangements. One patient with follicular small cleaved cell NHL that evolved to a small noncleaved cell NHL had coexisting bcl-2 and c-myc rearrangement in the aspiration specimen of the high-grade NHL, suggesting sequential bcl-2 and c-myc activation during the tumor's progression. Southern blot analysis is a useful technique for establishing tumor cell lineage, clonality, and the presence of oncogene rearrangements in fine-needle aspiration specimens of NHL.\r"

The authors present an additional case of this unusual lesion studied by immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and flow cytometry. A 77-year-old white woman presented with a 2-cm, nontender, mobile, calcified, right subareolar mass suggestive of a fibroadenoma. Microscopically, the tumor resembled a pleomorphic adenoma occurring in salivary glands. Positive immunostaining for S-100 protein, cytokeratin, and muscle-specific actin, as well as the ultrastructural presence of intermediate filaments with dense bodies and intercellular junctions, supported the predominant myoepithelial cell differentiation within the tumor, whereas the epithelial cell component stained only with cytokeratin and contained formed lumina with surface microvilli. The DNA pattern was diploid. The patient is alive and well 14 months after surgery. The authors' findings confirm that pleomorphic adenoma of the breast is a benign neoplasm in which myoepithelial cell proliferation plays a major role in tumorigenesis.\r"

Most drownings in the former group occur in residential pools. Among survivors, the clinical course is bimodal; intact survival and survival with severe permanent disability are the most likely outcomes. The outcome of an immersion event is determined within a few minutes of the onset of immersion, mandating an emphasis on primary prevention. A requirement for pool fencing is the most promising such strategy and could be implemented soon. Training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and (for older children) alcohol abuse prevention programs may be valuable adjuncts.\r"

Homicide is a leading cause of death for US children and adolescents, and so a major cause of years of potential life lost. Infantile and adolescent patterns of homicide are recognized: child abuse by parents characterizes the former; gunshots and other assaults by peers characterize the latter. Nonfatal violent injury is far more prevalent than the fatalities. Reliable estimates indicate that each year close to 1 million female adolescents are sexually assaulted, and more than 1.5 million children and adolescents are abused by the adults responsible for them. Adolescents experience violent crimes at extremely high rates. Risk factors for violent injury are recognized. The most consistent include male sex (except for sexual abuse) and urban residence. Despite the toll of violence, surprisingly little is known about its origins and means to prevent it. The only prevention approach that has been both well evaluated and of apparent benefit is the home health visitor for prevention of child abuse in infants of young, impoverished, unmarried primiparous women. Many other approaches are plausible, promising, and/or being implemented, and these require thorough trial and evaluation. Research on numerous aspects of the precursors and correlates of violence against children is also needed.\r"

  ".U": "90266833\r", 
  ".W": "PURPOSE: The purpose of our study was to ascertain the safety of rapidly correcting acute symptomatic hyponatremia in psychogenic water drinkers, particularly in regard to any delayed adverse neurologic sequelae. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of all known psychogenic water drinkers (34) in our hospital from 1977 to 1989. Using seizure as a marker of severity, we identified 13 patients having a total of 27 episodes associated with severe hyponatremia. We evaluated the charts of those patients in detail to assess the mode of treatment, rate of correction, and long-term neurologic outcome. None of the patients experienced respiratory arrest before treatment, which was initiated within 2 hours of seizure. RESULTS: For all 27 episodes, the initial serum sodium level (mean +/- SE) was 110.9 +/- 1.2 mmol/L, and the rate of correction (mean +/- SE) was 1.65 +/- 0.2 mmol/L/hour. All but one episode were corrected \"rapidly\" (initial correction rate of 0.7 or more mmol/L/hour) to 120 to 130 mmol/L within 12 hours. The absolute change in the serum sodium level was 15.1 +/- 1.2 mmol/L in 12 hours, 21.6 +/- 1.4 mmol/L in 24 hours, and 25.9 +/- 1.4 mmol/L in 48 hours. In no instance did therapy induce hypernatremia. All patients recovered immediately after treatment. There was no clinical or radiologic evidence of adverse neurologic sequelae immediately after treatment or after 6 years of follow-up. CONCLUSION: In this series of male psychogenic water drinkers, early \"rapid\" correction of acute symptomatic hyponatremia by raising the serum sodium level 15 mmol/L in 12 hours while maintaining an absolute change in the serum sodium level of 26 mmol/L within 48 hours produced no long-term neurologic sequelae.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To examine the predisposing factors, clinical and laboratory characteristics, management, course, and outcome of consecutive cases of theophylline toxicity in an outpatient setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Toxicology records and hospital charts of consecutive patients with a serum theophylline concentration (STC) greater than 30 mg/L (167 mumol/L) identified in the emergency departments (EDS) of a University Medical Center and a Veterans Administration Medical Center were reviewed. RESULTS: Ten percent and 2.8% of 5,557 consecutive STCs measured in the EDs over 2 years were greater than 20 mg/L (111 mumol/L) and greater than 30 mg/L (167 mumol/L), respectively. One hundred sixteen cases with STC greater than 30 mg/L were identified. Fourteen (12%) and 102 (88%) were due to acute overdose and chronic overmedication, respectively. Principal predisposing factors included patient and/or physician dosing errors and conditions or medications that reduce theophylline clearance. One or more toxic manifestations were present in 109 (94%) cases. Fifty percent of patients had mild toxicity, 38% had moderate toxicity, and 7% had severe or life-threatening toxicity. Seven (6%) patients died when STC was still in the toxic range and/or as a result of toxicity. Acute overdose was associated with higher peak STC (p less than 0.001), younger age (p less than 0.01), and greater mortality (p less than 0.05) than chronic overmedication. Peak STC correlated significantly with the severity of toxicity for patients with acute overdose (p less than 0.01) but not for patients with chronic overmedication. All three patients with acute overdose and fatal toxicity had peak STCs greater than 100 mg/L (555 mumol/L) and fulminant toxicity, whereas the four patients with chronic overmedication who died during toxicity had peak STCs in the 40 to 60 mg/L (222 to 333 mumol/L) range and most died of respiratory failure rather than directly from toxicity. Patients with acute overdose who had the delayed onset of severe or life-threatening toxicity and/or died from toxicity were accurately identified using previously published criteria for prophylactic charcoal hemoperfusion. In contrast, the predictive value of the criteria applied to patients with chronic overmedication was poor. Two patients with acute overdose underwent charcoal hemoperfusion, but died. No patient with chronic overmedication received charcoal hemoperfusion. CONCLUSION: Toxic-range STCs are relatively common in the ED population, occur primarily as a result of patient and physician dosing errors, and cause a broad range of toxic manifestations of varying severity. Peak STC correlates with the severity of toxicity and outcome for acute overdose but not chronic overmedication intoxication. Previously published criteria for prophylactic charcoal hemoperfusion accurately identify patients with acute overdose but not patients with chronic overmedication at risk for serious complications and death.\r"

We are unaware of any previous reports that describe the course of gestation and the effect on subsequent offspring in patients treated with low-dose oral MTX for rheumatoid arthritis, and therefore present our experience. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report on eight women experiencing 10 pregnancies. Mean number of weeks of gestation while taking MTX was 7.5 (range 2 to 20 weeks). Outcome of pregnancies included five full-term babies (FTB), three spontaneous abortions (SAB), and two elective abortions. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in either the FTB or SAB group when considering risk factors including smoking, alcohol, concomitant medications, and age. One of three in the SAB group had recurrent abortions prior to MTX therapy. All five of the FTB group had uncomplicated pregnancies and deliveries. All offspring were of normal height and weight at birth with no physical abnormalities. All children reached growth, development, and intellectual stages normally, and their present mean age is 11.5 years. No observed learning disabilities or medical abnormalities have occurred in any of these children. CONCLUSION: In this uncontrolled study we failed to demonstrate tertogenicity of MTX. However, the possibility of abortion due to MTX use remains.\r"

  ".U": "90266841\r", 
  ".W": "PURPOSE: Chromogranin A, co-released with catecholamines from the adrenal medullary and sympathetic neuronal vesicles, is elevated in plasma from patients with pheochromocytoma. We assessed its diagnostic screening value, its plasma level in correlation with tumor mass, and its disposition kinetics in familial pheochromocytoma and sporadic pheochromocytoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The sensitivity and specificity of chromogranin A's diagnostic value for pheochromocytoma were established through one kindred with familial pheochromocytoma associated with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (13 available members) and in seven subjects with sporadic pheochromocytoma. Serial postoperative plasma samples were also obtained (5 minutes to 4 days) from eight subjects with pheochromocytoma in order to study chromogranin A post-resection kinetics. Chromogranin A was measured by radioimmunoassay based on purified pheochromocytoma chromogranin A. RESULTS: In this kindred, elevations of chromogranin A (greater than 52 ng/mL) were sensitive (83%, five of six) and specific (100%, 10 of 10) in detecting familial pheochromocytoma; these diagnostic values comparable to those achieved by conventional evaluations for pheochromocytoma, such as urinary catecholamines, urinary catecholamine metabolites or imaging methods. Elevated levels of plasma chromogranin A specifically indicated pheochromocytoma, rather than von Hippel-Lindau syndrome gene carrier status. In 13 preoperative subjects with either familial or sporadic pheochromocytoma, plasma chromogranin A concentration predicted tumor size (r = 0.81, p less than 0.01). The change in chromogranin A plasma concentration after pheochromocytoma resection best fit a two-compartment model, with an initial rapid half-life time of 16 minutes, followed by a longer half-life time of 520 minutes. The model also predicted a 23.8:1 compartmental ratio of extravascular/intravascular chromogranin A, suggesting substantial tissue sequestration or binding of chromogranin A. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Plasma chromogranin A is a valuable (sensitive and specific) diagnostic tool in detecting both familial and sporadic pheochromocytoma. (2) The concentration of plasma chromogranin A predicts the size of the pheochromocytoma. (3) Chromogranin A post-resection kinetics suggest extravascular sequestration of chromogranin A.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Endothelin plays a role in the regulation of vascular tonus. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that increased production or release of endothelin or both may contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension. To assess any changes in the plasma endothelin concentration in essential hypertension, plasma immunoreactive endothelin concentrations were measured in patients with essential hypertension. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We measured plasma immunoreactive endothelin concentrations in 42 subjects with essential hypertension, 12 subjects with borderline hypertension, and 25 normotensive control subjects. RESULTS: The concentrations were higher in hypertensive patients than in borderline hypertensive patients and normotensive subjects (both p less than 0.05), although values in normotensives and hypertensives overlapped. Reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and radioimmuno-assay showed two components of plasma endothelin, one corresponding to synthetic endothelin-1 (1-21) and the other corresponding to synthetic big endothelin (human, 1-38). The HPLC profile of plasma endothelin of hypertensive patients was the same as that of normotensive subjects. Hypertensives with reduced glomerular filtration rates or increased serum creatinine levels had higher plasma endothelin concentrations than hypertensive patients as a whole (p less than 0.05). Mean blood pressure and serum creatinine levels were correlated to plasma endothelin in the hypertensives. Correlation was negative between glomerular filtration rate and the endothelin level in the hypertensives. CONCLUSION: Plasma endothelin was elevated in many hypertensive patients with severe hypertension or renal involvement. Its major components were endothelin-1 and big endothelin.\r"

Within-subject comparisons on neutropenia-related clinical and laboratory variables were made with data obtained from the same patients after they received the first neutropenia-inducing cycle of identical chemotherapy in the absence of GM-CSF. RESULTS: GM-CSF was active in neutropenic patients because it significantly increased the neutrophilic nadir, reduced the time of relevant neutropenia, and reduced the duration of a patient's hospital stay and the necessity for parenteral antibiotics. No significant toxicity was encountered with subcutaneous GM-CSF treatment. CONCLUSION: Although GM-CSF was shown to significantly reduce chemotherapy-associated morbidity in patients receiving myelotoxic cancer chemotherapy, additional studies are needed to assess whether the use of GM-CSF in anticancer chemotherapy will allow an increase in the dosage level, leading to improved response rates and survival among cancer patients.\r"

  ".W": "Thyroid hormone-induced changes in cardiac function have been recognized for over 150 years; however, the biochemical basis of triiodothyronine (T3) action in the heart has been intensely investigated only during the last two decades. T3-induced changes in cardiac function can result from direct or indirect T3 effects. Direct T3 effects result from T3 action in the heart itself and are mediated by nuclear or extranuclear mechanisms. Extranuclear T3 effects, which occur independent of nuclear T3 receptor binding and increases in protein synthesis, influence primarily the transport of amino acids, sugars, and calcium across the cell membrane. Nuclear T3 effects are mediated by the binding of T3 to specific nuclear receptor proteins, which results in increased transcription of T3-responsive cardiac genes. The T3 receptor is a member of the ligand-activated transcription factor family and is encoded by cellular erythroblastosis A (c-erb A) genes. The c-erb A protein is the cellular homologue of the viral erythroblastosis A (v-erb A) protein, which causes red cell leukemia in chickens. Currently, three T3-binding isoforms of the c-erb protein and two non-T3-binding nuclear proteins that exert positive and negative effects on T3-responsive cardiac genes have been identified. T3 increases the heart transcription of the myosin heavy chain (MHC) alpha gene and decreases the transcription of the MHC beta gene, leading to an increase of myosin V1 and a decrease in myosin V3 isoenzymes. Myosin V1, which is composed of two MHC alpha, has a higher myosin ATPase activity than myosin V3, which contains two MHC beta. The globular head of myosin V1, with its higher ATPase activity, leads to a more rapid movement of the globular head of myosin along the thin filament, resulting in an increased velocity of contraction. T3 also leads to an increase in the speed of diastolic relaxation, which is caused by the more efficient pumping of the calcium ATPase of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). This T3 effect results from T3-induced increases in the level of the mRNA coding for the SR calcium ATPase protein, leading to an increased number of calcium ATPase pump units in the SR. Overall, thyroid hormone leads to an increase in ATP consumption in the heart. In addition, less chemical energy of ATP is used for contractile purposes and more of it goes toward heat production, which causes a decreased efficiency of the contractile process in the hyperthyroid heart.\r"

  ".W": "To understand the pathophysiology of thyroid heart disease, it is necessary to recognize that thyroid hormone has effects on both the peripheral circulation and the myocardium. One of the earliest responses to thyroid hormone administration is a decline in systemic vascular resistance and an increase in cardiac output and cardiac contractility. In many ways, this response is similar to the cardiovascular response to exercise and is associated with increased left ventricular work. The majority of cardiac adaptations to changes in thyroid function are physiologic; however, certain patients do demonstrate clinical evidence of cardiac disease. Atrial arrhythmias, limitations in exercise tolerance, and congestive heart failure are reported to occur as a result of hyperthyroidism and are more common in older patients. Thyroid hormone also plays an important role in the regulation of blood pressure. Diastolic hypertension is a common accompaniment of hypothyroidism. By understanding the mechanisms by which thyroid hormone affects both the peripheral circulation as well as the myocardium, it is possible to predict the clinical response to the treatment of various thyroid disease states.\r"

In hypothyroidism, these include pericardial effusion, heart failure, and the complex interrelationship between hypothyroidism and ischemic heart disease. Cardiovascular disorders associated with hyperthyroidism include atrial tachyarrhythmias, mitral valve dysfunction, and heart failure. Although these usually occur in individuals with intrinsic heart disease, thyroid dysfunction alone rarely causes serious but reversible cardiovascular dysfunction. Patients with commonly encountered cardiac disorders, e.g., idiopathic cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation, should be screened for potentially contributing subclinical thyroid diseases. In patients with heart failure and hypothyroidism, initial management should focus on diagnosis and optimal management of any primary cardiac disease, whereas in hyperthyroidism, aggressive measures to control excess thyroid hormone action should generally have the highest priority.\r"

  ".W": "The spectrum of classic symptoms of hyperthyroidism suggests that in addition to the effects of increased thyroid hormone, affecting various organ systems, there is also a hyperadrenergic state. Despite this clinical impression, direct measures of serum levels of catecholamines and their urinary metabolites demonstrate values that are equal to or less than normal. In contrast, the hypothyroid patient who clinically manifests signs of decreased adrenergic stimulation can be expected to have increased levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and its metabolites. This review discusses possible mechanisms to explain this seeming paradox. Treatment of hyperthyroidism includes the rapid reversal of many of the adrenergic symptoms with use of beta-blocking drugs. Return to a clinically and chemically euthyroid state, however, requires antithyroid therapy accomplished over a longer period of time. A knowledge of the interaction of the cardiovascular and extracardiovascular manifestations of hyperthyroidism and the role of the adrenergic nervous system is important in the rational management of these patients.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: For 40 years, disulfiram has been the alcohol-aversive drug used most frequently by American physicians in the treatment of alcohol dependency disorders. We reviewed the clinical literature regarding the risks, benefits, indications, and efficacy of this controversial drug and summarized current knowledge of this therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Disulfiram will produce an aversive reaction with ethanol, usually at a dose between 250 mg/day and 500 mg/day, although some patients may not have an aversive reaction at this level. Cardiac, hepatic, and neurologic toxicity can also occur within this dosage range. If disulfiram is to be used, the patient must clearly understand the risks of drinking while taking the drug, and the physician and patient must agree about the need for continued clinical supervision and monitoring for efficacy and side effects. The physician must also recognize that disulfiram is only an adjunctive therapy and that continued support, supervision, and other therapeutic measures are required. Disulfiram is probably effective in reducing the frequency of alcohol consumption in the compliant patient over the short term (e.g., 6 months). Certain subgroups of patients, such as those who are older, those who are more socially stable, and those who are well-motivated, may experience a beneficial effect for longer periods. The drug may be most effective in reducing short-term alcohol consumption when the compliance of the patient is supervised, although consideration of this kind of therapy includes the practical problems of supervising the patient and concerns that the supervising person may be placed in a difficult position. Prescription of disulfiram without accompanying education, counseling, and concomitant alcoholism therapy is not beneficial. Disulfiram has no proven effect on the long-term outcome of alcoholism.\r"

  ".W": "Although hereditary angioedema accounts for only a small fraction of all cases of angioedema, it is the most common genetically linked clinical disorder caused by the deficiency of a protein associated with complement activation. Attacks may be complicated by incapacitating cutaneous swelling, life-threatening upper airway impediment, and severe gastrointestinal colic. Recent physicochemical and genetic studies have contributed significantly to our understanding of the structure of the inhibitor protein. Measurement of serum C4 titer is an efficacious screening test. Normal levels during symptomatic periods rule out the diagnosis, whereas decreased levels warrant determination of C1 esterase inhibitor titer by immunoassay or functional assay. The functional assay is necessary to ascertain the genetic variant form. The importance of making the correct diagnosis cannot be overemphasized. It can avert potentially fatal consequences, such as upper airway obstruction and unnecessary abdominal surgery. The application of short-term preventive measures can avoid complications associated with trauma. Finally, abatement or elimination of symptoms in patients with incessant and disabling attacks can be attained by long-term therapy with currently available attenuated androgens.\r"

Conjunctival melanomas showed intense and diffuse cytoplasmic staining; compound nevi and subepithelial nevi showed less intense but diffuse reaction. There was strong staining in melanocytic cells at the junction of the epithelium and substantia propria in compound nevi and acquired melanoses. Unlike skin nevi, conjunctival nevi show HMB-45 reactivity in their stromal components. Immunoreactivity to HMB-45 does not distinguish benign from atypical or malignant melanocytic lesions of the conjunctiva.\r"

The randomization code was not broken until all clinical and histopathologic observations had been completed. Six weeks postoperatively, the 5-fluorouracil-treated eyes had more deeply open internal trabeculectomy ostia than the control eyes; however, the intraocular pressures were indistinguishable, the filtering blebs were only minimally different, and half of each group had trace or mild anterior subcapsular lenticular changes. Histologically, a multinucleated foreign body giant cell reaction was evident in all of the collagen implants, but the 5-fluorouracil-treated eyes had less vigorous or delayed reactions compared to the control eyes. The collagen implant appears to be a poor drug delivery system in this model of glaucoma filtering surgery, because it incites a granulomatous inflammatory reaction.\r"

The severity of ACEI-induced cough may vary, and is associated with increased bronchial hyperreactivity in some (but not all) patients as judged by methacholine sensitivity. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor-induced cough may have its onset from one day to 12 months after initiation of therapy, and is not dose dependent. Angioedema caused by ACEI is usually mild and clears with discontinuation of the drug, however cases requiring intubation and tracheostomy have been reported. The mechanism of ACEI-induced cough remains unclear, but could be in part due to accumulation of substances whose degradation may also be impeded by ACEI, such as substance P, bradykinins, and/or prostaglandins. Knowledge of the side effects produced by this class of medication may help patients avoid unnecessary, costly, and often invasive diagnostic evaluations.\r"

Treatment commenced at home at the first sign of an attack. Parents' blind preference for active treatment was significant. Data from 17 pairs of treatment, however, were affected by interventions such as hospital admission or oral corticosteroid treatment. These events occurred similarly in active and control periods. An intrasubject comparison was made of diary scores from the 18 pairs of episodes in which no intervention occurred in either the active or placebo treatment. Both daytime and night symptoms over the first week of the attack were significantly reduced by active treatment. Intermittent high dose inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate is beneficial in modifying the severity of acute episodic asthma in preschool children able to use a spacer device.\r"

Wheezing or asthma was common (incidence 23%); it was associated with neonatal ventilation, maternal smoking, and a family history of atopy and was unexpectedly reduced in babies born by caesarean section. Even in non-ventilated infants, the incidence of subsequent wheezing was 18%, rising to an estimated 44% (using logistic regression) when the foregoing risk factors (excluding ventilation) were present. Eczema occurred in 151 infants (19%) and was strongly associated with multiple pregnancy (30% incidence in twins or triplets). Reactions to cows' milk (incidence: 4.4% from detailed history; 0.8% confirmed by challenge), other foods (10%), and drugs (5%) were within the range reported in full term infants. Milk and food reactions were associated with multiple pregnancy (19%) and a family history of atopy. Reactions to drugs were least likely to occur in infants who had been ventilated and were on multiple medications in the neonatal period, suggesting that drug tolerance may have developed. We speculate that preterm infants may be a high risk group for asthma and eczema, which could imply an association between atopy and prematurity.\r"

Computed tomography of the brain showed an ill-defined, low-density area in the bilateral parietotemporal lobes.

Microscopically, the hepatic tumor was a diffuse lymphoma, large cell, of the B-cell type.

  ".W": "Exposure of cells to physical (eg, heat) or chemical (eg, alcohol) stress results in increased synthesis of a set of highly conserved polypeptides termed heat shock proteins (HSPs), among which the 70-kd protein (HSP 70) is one of the most consistently inducible and highly conserved. This HSP has adenosine triphosphate-binding properties and is known to associate strongly with cytoskeletal structures that are usually disrupted on injury by heat or alcohol. Some HSPs apparently function as accessories to a nonlysosomal, adenosine triphosphate-dependent proteolytic system that binds and digests away stress-generated abnormal or denatured proteins after their conjugation with ubiquitin, a small HSP. Ubiquitin has been demonstrated immunocytochemically in Mallory bodies, which represent mainly degenerated intermediate filaments accumulated in hepatocytes of alcoholic-diseased liver. We immunostained histologic sections from patients with alcoholic liver disease using a polyclonal antibody raised against HSP 70. Strong diffuse cytoplasmic immunoreactivity was observed in many hepatocytes, including cells without Mallory bodies or fatty degeneration. Positive immunoreactivity for HSP 70 points to a possible involvement of this HSP in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease. It also suggests that immunocytochemical detection of HSP 70 may serve as a more sensitive indicator of hepatocellular injury.\r"

To evaluate its range of expression, we used immunoperoxidase staining of fresh frozen-tissue sections to determine monoclonal antibody 5.1 H11 reactivity in normal and neoplastic tissue. Among normal tissue specimens, intense antibody staining was seen in brain and peripheral nerve, and weaker staining in ganglionic elements of colon. In addition to 26 of 29 rhabdomyosarcoma specimens, 5.1 H11 antibody showed reactivity to 9 of 10 Wilms' tumors, 6 of 6 neural tumors, and 4 of 4 gliomas, and with single specimens of ectomesenchymoma, clear-cell sarcoma of kidney, undifferentiated sarcoma of liver, ovarian fibroma, and neurofibroma. We conclude that the monoclonal antibody 5.1 H11 recognizes an antigen present not only on fetal muscle but on normal brain and nerve as well. In addition to rhabdomyosarcoma, a variety of other tumors, most of which have been previously shown to express neural cell adhesion molecule, also appear to express the antigen recognized by 5.1 H11. Our results thus offer additional confirmatory evidence that an epitope of neural cell adhesion molecule is the antigen for 5.1 H11.\r"

  ".W": "Laminin, a major extracellular matrix-attachment glycoprotein, may play an important role in the differentiation and migration of epithelial cells during normal development. Therefore, the morphogenesis of bile ducts in human liver of fetuses at sequential gestational ages, neonates, children, and adults was examined by single and double immunohistochemical staining for laminin and for cytokeratins. The latter served as a marker for developing and mature bile duct epithelial cells. A close association was observed between laminin deposition and the differentiating ductal plate cells at the epithelial-mesenchymal interface of portal tracts and during the subsequent migration of ductular structures into the center of portal tracts. Simultaneously, laminin disappeared from the margins of portal tracts, but scattered ductal plate-like structures with laminin remained demonstrable in neonates, children, and even adults. These observations were substantiated by semiquantitative evaluation of laminin at the periphery of portal tracts. Thus, clear evidence is provided that laminin accompanies bile duct epithelial cells during all successive stages of differentiation and migration during the development of the human hepatobiliary system. The persisting ductal plate cells may represent a common stem cell for proliferation of bile ductules and hepatocytes.\r"

Accuracy of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and computed tomography in locating lesions was 75% and 44%, respectively. Histologic diagnosis before or at the time of resection was available in only 61% of the patients. Carcinoma was correctly diagnosed clinically by the pathologist or the surgeon in 95% (83/87) of patients with 4 patients found to have benign disease on final pathologic examination. Intraoperative diagnosis of site of origin was incorrect in 18% (16/87) of patients. In 28% (23/83) of patients, pathologists identified nodal metastatic disease missed by the surgeon. Survival correlated with nodal and margin status and tumor grade. Tumor size demonstrated no predictive capacity. Although preoperative diagnostic accuracy is less than optimal, surgeons can usually diagnose malignant lesions but more often fail to identify tumor origin and nodal disease. We continue to advocate resection for patients with periampullary lesions thought to be malignant and resectable without a positive histologic diagnosis.\r"

The natural history of pancreatic pseudocysts has been clarified by newer technology, such as ultrasonography, computer tomography, amylase isoenzyme measurements, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. All have influenced diagnosis, nonoperative management, and surgical operation. Differences between pancreatic pseudocysts associated with acute pancreatitis in contrast with chronic pancreatitis, and the complications of obstruction, hemorrhage, rupture, pancreatic ascites, infection, and jaundice can now be more rationally treated. Pancreatic pseudocysts and pancreatic ductal changes are now revealed earlier, especially by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Paradoxically, this information has encouraged nonoperative conservative therapy and also larger operations, eg, resection and adjunctive pancreaticojejunostomy. Partial resection of the pancreas together with the pancreatic pseudocysts was performed in 58 (25%) of the 233 patients. Recent technology permits cautious exploration of selective pancreatic pseudocyst drainage percutaneously or transgastroduodenally avoiding laparotomy.\r"

While controlling for these matching variables and hypertension, an analysis based on a conditional logistic regression model indicated that a smoker was 1.6 times more likely to have a cerebral infarction than a non-smoker (95% confidence interval, 1.07 to 2.42). There was a cumulative dose effect with each additional pack-year causing a greater risk of having a cerebral infarction. In fact, after adjusting for all other risk factors, there was a significant quadratic component to the dose-response relationships, with the result that individuals with a larger number of pack-years were invariably the stroke patients. There was no significant difference in smoking status among the various subtypes of cerebral infarction (atherosclerotic, nonatherosclerotic vasculopathy, cardioembolic, hematologic related, undetermined). These data indicate that cigarette smoking is an important risk factor for cerebral infarction in young adults. Risk factor modification through cessation of smoking may reduce the risk of ischemic stroke in young adults.\r"

Dissemination was facilitated by endorsements of eminent neurologists, widespread publicity in professional journals and lay press, and the apparent simplicity and safety of the procedure. However, increasingly critical reports appeared, indicating much lower success rates, frequent postprocedure deterioration, and occasional serious complications. The disparity between early and later studies resulted from a placebo effect, from disregard of the natural history of the condition, from misdiagnosis, and from biased observation and reporting. By the end of 1890, the procedure was largely abandoned, despite proponents' attempts to modify the technique or to identify a more responsive subgroup of patients.\r"

The major adverse effects were hepatotoxicity (2 patients) and rash (2 patients). This study documents the clinical efficacy of ciamexon therapy in RA patients and identifies the agent's potential toxicity.\r"

We have proposed that prorenin may be the vehicle of local renin systems, separating the functions of circulating and tissue renin. In the present study, we investigated the effect of increasing plasma prorenin 3- to 4-fold by infusing recombinant prorenin, 400 ng/min for 40 min, into male rhesus monkeys. The prorenin was first warmed to 37 degrees C to reduce the endogenous renin activity to a minimum. The study included a 20 min baseline and a 40 min recovery period. Plasma prorenin increased from 72 +/- 14 ng/mL/h to a maximum of 246 +/- 18 ng/mL/h during the infusion (P less than .001) and fell to 169 +/- 23 ng/mL/h 40 min after the infusion was stopped. Active renin did not change significantly. Plasma aldosterone increased slightly during the prorenin infusion (by 13%) and returned to baseline during the recovery period (P less than .05 compared to the infusion period). Plasma testosterone fell significantly from 1.9 +/- 0.1 ng/mL to 1.6 +/- 0.1 ng/mL during the infusion and further to 1.4 +/- 0.1 ng/mL during the post-infusion period (P less than .05). Blood pressure fell slightly but not significantly. Heart rate, glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow, as well as urine flow and urine sodium and potassium excretion showed no significant change. These results demonstrate that human recombinant prorenin is not converted to active renin in the circulation of rhesus monkeys.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fifty sedentary hypertensive subjects were randomly assigned to propranolol (n = 23) or pindolol (n = 27) therapy for a 22 week double-blind parallel study. Over the first 2 weeks, during which subjects remained sedentary, drug doses were titrated to produce equipotent, clinically significant BP reductions. Subjects subsequently continued drug therapy and completed 20 weeks of exercise training. Although pindolol tended to preserve submaximal exercise heart rates to a greater degree than propranolol, the initial 2 weeks of drug therapy resulted in equivalent reductions in maximal oxygen uptake with propranolol (6% reduction) and pindolol (8% reduction). Likewise, 20 weeks of training induced similar, statistically significant (P = .0001) increases in maximal oxygen uptake during propranolol (10% increase) and pindolol (11% increase) treatment. We therefore conclude that ISA does not confer any advantage to patients with high BP who receive chronic beta-blocker therapy and wish to improve their cardiorespiratory fitness by participating in exercise training.\r"

The binding was not affected by calcium antagonists or vasoactive substances, including angiotensin II, arginine vasopressin, atrial natriuretic factor and bradykinin. Exposure of the cells to ET-1 (0.01 nmol/L to 10 nmol/L) resulted in an apparent dose-dependent reduction of the number of endothelin binding sites with no significant modification of its binding affinity. The time course of the down-regulation of ET-1 binding sites showed that this effect was present after 30 min incubation and persisted after 18 h. This indicates that down-regulation of ET-1 binding sites can modulate the activity of ET-1 and suggests a rapid internalization of ET-1 in vascular cells.\r"

  ".U": "90267702\r", 
  ".W": "The endothelium has a strategical anatomical position between the circulating blood and vascular smooth muscle cells. It has recently been recognized that endothelial cells play an important regulatory role in the circulation. The cells metabolize or activate vasoactive hormones (ie, norepinephrine, serotonin, bradykinin, angiotensin II), produce substances involved in coagulation and can release endothelium-derived relaxing factors and contracting factors. Nitric oxide and prostacyclin are vasodilators and inhibitors of platelet function. Endothelin is the most potent vasoconstrictor substance known. Thus, the endothelium can profoundly affect platelet adhesion and aggregation, vascular smooth muscle tone and possibly also vascular smooth muscle growth. Under physiological conditions, endothelium-derived relaxing factors appear to dominate. In contrast, in hypertensive and atherosclerotic arteries the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factors and/or the responsiveness of vascular smooth muscle cells to the relaxing factors is reduced, while that of endothelium-derived contracting factors is augmented. This imbalance of endothelium-derived relaxing and contracting factors may be important in the pathogenesis of hypertension and its cardiovascular complications.\r"

Cytogenetic analysis of the cells of four patients proliferating in IL7-supplemented cultures established the leukemic descendence of the IL-7-responsive cells. 125I-IL-7 binding experiments with the cells of one patient and with two ALL cell lines showed the presence of two types of IL-7 receptors: one with a high affinity (kd 29 to 51 pmol/L) and one with a low affinity (kd 2.3 to 76 nmol/L) for the ligand.

Three separate groups were considered: 94 patients were treated with heparin, 67 with anti-fibrinolytics (tranexamic acid, epsilon-aminocaproic acid, or aprotinin), and 107 with supportive therapy alone. The overall incidence of early hemorrhagic death (within the first 10 days of treatment) was 9.4%, with no significant differences between the various groups. Similarly, there were no differences in complete remission rates or duration of survival. The consumption of packed red blood cells and platelet concentrates was similar for two of the groups, and there was a significantly greater use of platelet concentrates for heparin-treated patients. High blast cell counts on the day of admission were significantly associated with hemorrhagic death within the first 10 days. These counts, plus high blast cell counts and low platelet counts, were associated with death within 24 hours.\r"

  ".W": "We have studied the effects of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF), hG macrophage-CSF (hGM-CSF), and gibbon interleukin-3 (gIL-3) on cell proliferation and differentiation in human long-term bone marrow culture (LTBMC). hG-CSF induced a maximal increase of 2.3-fold in both total nonadherent cells and GM cluster-forming cells, but only an increase of 1.7-fold in GM-colony-forming cell (GM-CFC) numbers, influencing mainly neutrophil differentiation. Cultures treated with hGM-CSF demonstrated a peak of 12.8-, 21- and 3.2-fold elevations in total nonadherent cells, cluster, and GM-CFC, respectively, and influenced differentiation of neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, and lymphocytes. Cultures treated with gIL-3 demonstrated the largest expansion in the GM-CFC population, reaching a maximum of 5.3-fold in relation to that of unstimulated controls. IL-3 treatment also increased the numbers of GM clusters and mature cells (including all myeloid cells and lymphocytes) 7.8- and 4.8-fold, respectively. Similar quantitative and qualitative changes were induced by G-CSF, GM-CSF, and IL-3 in LTBMCs of patients in remission after treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia or Hodgkin's lymphoma. Overall, the expansion of GM progenitor cells in cultures treated with growth factors was larger in the adherent cell layer than in the nonadherent cell fraction. In addition, hGM-CSF, gIL-3, and hG-CSF to a less extent, increased the cycling rates of GM-CFC progenitors located in the adherent layer. These results indicate that hG-CSF is a much less potent stimulus of hematopoiesis in LTBMC than the other CSFs assayed, and that the increases in cell production after treatment with G-CSF, GM-CSF, or IL-3 may be achieved by primary expansion of different cell populations within the hierarchy of the hematopoietic system. The effects of the growth factors were transient and the longevity of hematopoiesis in the cultures was not altered, suggesting that treatment with IL-3, GM-CSF, or G-CSF had not compromised the ability of primitive cells to give rise to mature cells. This indicates that the stromal microenvironment in LTBMC can override potential differentiation-inducing activities of the CSFs.\r"

  ".W": "Adherent murine stromal cells support long-term in vitro lymphopoiesis or myelopoiesis dependent on the culture conditions used. A cell line, TC-1, isolated from long-term liquid murine marrow cultures under conditions approaching those permissive for lymphoid growth, has been found to produce an activity that acts synergistically with interleukin-3 (IL-3) or colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) to stimulate in vitro myeloid colonies, but which has no intrinsic colony-stimulating activity. We report here the presence of multiple growth factors in conditioned medium (CM) from the TC-1 line, including granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (bioassay with antibody blocking and messenger RNA [mRNA] analysis), granulocyte CSF (G-CSF) and IL-4 (factor-dependent cell line bioassay), and CSF-1 (radioimmunoassay, mRNA) along with a pre-B cell inducing activity, which appears separate from these CSFs and segregates with the myeloid synergizing activity through anion exchange, sizing, and Conconavalin A chromatography. Because these activities are not yet purified to homogeneity, their identity or lack of identity remains an open question. Assays of TC-1 CM or cellular mRNA analysis have given negative results for IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, and IL-7, and IL-6 does not stimulate pre-B cells in this assay. However, IL-4 and G-CSF do stimulate in vitro induction of pre-B cells from pre-B and B-cell-depleted Balb/C marrow and are present in CM by selective cell line assay. A monoclonal antibody to IL-4 that inhibited its pre-B inducing activity did not inhibit pre-B inducing activity of TC-1 CM. These data suggest the existence of a unique synergizing and pre-B inducing factor(s) in TC-1 CM. Given the known capacity of subliminal levels of growth factors to act synergistically, an alternate possibility is that these biologic phenomena represent the actions of low concentrations of growth factors acting synergistically and possibly associated with some core protein.\r"

  ".W": "Erythropoietin (EPO) is a major regulatory factor controlling red blood cell (RBC) production in humans. Although other humoral factors can alter the proliferation of committed early erythroid progenitors in vitro, no factor other than EPO has been clearly shown to induce proliferation of these cells in vivo. In a clinical trail of recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and recombinant EPO in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, we noted reticulocytosis and increases in hemoglobin when G-CSF was administered before the administration of EPO. Subsequent studies demonstrated a significant increase in circulating burst forming unit-erythron (BFU-E) during daily recombinant G-CSF therapy. This increase was both time- and dose-dependent. The magnitude of increase in BFU-E correlated with the magnitude of increase in neutrophils and was associated with a mean increase in reticulocytes of 32,363/microL and a significant increase in mean hemoglobin of 1.04 +/- 0.34 g/dL over an 18-day interval. There was a significant increase in iron binding capacity and decreases in iron saturation and ferritin levels. In patients who were not recently transfused, there was an associated fall in endogenous erythropoietin levels. The increase in RBC production was most marked in patients who were severely anemic, transfusion-dependent, and who had elevated pretreatment EPO levels. There was no correlation between the increase in BFU-E and endogenous EPO levels or the time since last dose of zidovudine. The addition of recombinant EPO therapy three times weekly to patients did not result in further significant increases in BFU-E but did significantly increase hemoglobin. Our data suggest that recombinant G-CSF may be one of the hematopoietic factors that influences production of BFU-E and RBCs in humans.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of recombinant human interleukin-3 (IL-3) and recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) on the growth of myeloid progenitor cells (CFU-C) in semisolid agar culture were studied in two patients with Kostmann-type congenital neutropenia. CFU-C growth in bone marrow cells from patients was significantly reduced in response to various concentrations of either IL-3 or G-CSF alone, compared with that from normal subjects. There was no inhibitory effect of bone marrow cells from patients on normal CFU-C formation supported by IL-3 or G-CSF. However, the simultaneous stimulation with IL-3 and G-CSF induced the increase of CFU-C formation in patients with congenital neutropenia. Furthermore, CFU-C growth in both patients was supported when bone marrow cells were preincubated with IL-3 in liquid culture followed by the stimulation with G-CSF in semisolid agar culture. In contrast, that was not supported by the preincubation with G-CSF and the subsequent stimulation with IL-3. This evidence suggests that the hematopoietic progenitor cells in patients with congenital neutropenia have the potential for developing CFU-C in the combined stimulation with IL-3 and G-CSF, and that this growth may be dependent on the priming of IL-3 followed by the stimulation with G-CSF. The level of mature neutrophils in peripheral blood was not fully restored to normal levels by the daily administration of G-CSF in doses of 100 to 200 micrograms/m2 of body surface area for 20 to 25 days in both patients. These observations raise the possibility that the combination of IL-3 and G-CSF might have a potential role for the increase of neutrophil counts in patients with congenital neutropenia.\r"

The percentages of normal sera producing a 95-Kd band with anti-immunoglobulin G (IgG), -IgA, and -IgM are 85, 50, and 30, respectively. Antiglobulin reagents alone also produce background bands on WBs that we have shown correspond to levels of platelet-associated Igs (PAIgs) or their derivatives. Titers of 95 Kd-reactive IgG in normal sera range from 10 to 1,280 (85% less than or equal to 50), and the reaction appears to be partially F(ab')2-mediated. The 95-Kd protein is internal and differs in many respects from surface glycoproteins IIIa, IV, and V of similar apparent molecular weight. In thrombocytopenic patients there was no correlation between severity of thrombocytopenia or PAIgG of platelet eluates and corresponding serum titers of 95 Kd-reactive IgG. Some WB reactions previously reported as evidence of autoimmunity may represent normal variations in reactions of Igs with internal platelet proteins. These reactions may be immunospecific or analogous to nonspecific, partially F(ab')2-dependent binding of Igs by certain bacterial proteins.\r"

  ".W": "The anti-leukemia potential of natural killer (NK) cells has been evaluated in 40 patients transplanted for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) to determine whether differences in NK cell function were correlated with subsequent leukemic relapse. Cells from patients and their donors were tested in 51Cr release assays against fully allogeneic CML targets and against cultured K562 targets; cells from 26 patients were tested against host-derived CML targets that were cryopreserved before transplantation. Cultured CML targets (K562) were highly susceptible to lysis by freshly isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and to a greater degree by PBL cultured in medium containing interleukin-2 (IL-2) in all assays performed. In contrast, noncultured CML targets were lysed only by IL-2-activated cells from a subset of patients. When present, lytic activity to CML targets was detectable as early as 3 weeks after bone marrow transplantation, and remained positive throughout the posttransplant period. Optimal lytic activity developed within the first week of culture and required greater than or equal to 250 U/mL of IL-2 in the culture medium. Lytic activity to fully allogeneic and host-derived CML targets appeared to be mediated by CD16+ and CD56+ cells but not by CD3+ cells. Lysis of allogeneic CML targets was variable, but patients could be divided into two groups: those with and those without lytic activity to the majority of targets tested. The basis for the differences in lytic activity could not be ascribed to target susceptibility to lysis, the proportion of NK cells in the cultures, or to the phenotype of the NK cell subsets in the cultures. When tested in parallel, the lytic activity of donor and recipient cultures against host-derived CML targets was highly correlated, suggesting that there may be inherent differences in the ability of NK cells to recognize CML targets. The risk of relapse for patients who failed to generate lytic activity against host-derived CML targets was significantly increased over that for patients with lytic activity against host leukemia. These data indicate that posttransplant immunotherapy with IL-2 designed to activate NK cells will likely augment the graft-versus-leukemia potential of the graft.\r"

Scrotal ultrasound refuted the diagnosis of malignancy in seven cases with subsequent histological proof of benignity. However, the nature and extent of the benign disease was such that, on review, orchidectomy was considered to be the most appropriate method of treating the patient. We contend that in the case of firm clinical diagnosis of testicular malignancy, an ultrasound diagnosis of benignity will not alter management, and it is therefore not an essential part of the work-up in this group of patients.\r"

A model system with myeloid cells has shown that normal hematopoietic cells require different proteins to induce cell multiplication and cell differentiation, and that a cascade of interactions between proteins determines the correct balance between immature and mature cells in normal development. Gene cloning has shown that there is a family of different genes for these proteins. Normal protein regulators of hematopoiesis can control the abnormal growth of certain types of leukemic cells and suppress malignancy by inducing differentiation to mature nondividing cells. Genetic abnormalities that give rise to malignancy in these leukemic cells can be bypassed and their effects nullified by inducing differentiation, which stops cells from multiplying. These hematopoietic regulatory proteins are active in culture and in vivo and have been used clinically to correct defects in blood cell development. The results provide new approaches to therapy.\r"

Patients with both measurable and nonmeasurable disease were included and the primary study end point was survival. Among 41 patients with measurable disease, objective response rates were 7% for 5-FU alone, 21% for the Mallinson regimen, and 15% for FAP. The median interval to progression for each of the three regimens was 2.5 months. Survival curves intertwined with the median survival times for 5-FU alone and the Mallinson regimen at 4.5 months and for FAP at 3.5 months. Compared with 5-FU alone, both the Mallinson regimen and FAP produced significantly more toxicity. Neither the Mallinson regimen nor FAP can be recommended as therapy for advanced pancreatic carcinoma. Any chemotherapy for this disease should remain an experimental endeavor.\r"

  ".W": "Syrian golden hamsters bearing N-nitrosobis(2-oxopropyl)amine (BOP)-induced pancreatic carcinomas were treated for 2 months with the delayed delivery systems of the agonist D-Trp-6-LH-RH (microcapsules releasing 25 micrograms/day for 30 days), the somatostatin analog RC-160 (the microcapsules liberating 48.2 micrograms/day for 30 days), or with the combination of these two analogues. The increase in the dose of RC-160 was possible in view of the lack of toxicity of this analog. This higher dose of RC-160 exerted a greater suppressive effect on pancreatic cancers than the regimens previously used (5-25 micrograms/day). RC-160, D-Trp-6-LH-RH, and their combination reduced the number of pancreatic carcinomas and significantly inhibited tumor growth as compared with the controls. The combination had the strongest tumor-inhibitory effect and reduced tumor weight by 85% as compared with controls. Both the light and electron microscopic analysis of the tumors showed that the inhibitory effect was due to the enhancement of apoptosis (programmed cell death) of tumor cells. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) receptors were detected immunohistochemically in the untreated tumors and their number decreased after the treatment with the analogues. Binding of D-Trp-6-LH-RH and RC-160 to tumor cells was shown immunohistochemically and receptors to these analogues and IGF-I were also determined biochemically by radioligand titration. Treatment with D-Trp-6-LH-RH and RC-160 decreased the binding capacity of receptors for D-Trp-6-LH-RH and IGF-I, producing down-regulation of these receptors. This suggests that pancreatic tumor cells with receptors to these peptides are sensitive to the treatment. This work reinforces the view that the combination of high doses of somatostatin analog RC-160 with LH-RH agonists or antagonists should be considered for the development of a new hormonal therapy for ductal pancreatic cancers.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of femoral vein occlusion when the hip joint is dislocated and manipulated during arthroplasty has been studied in fresh anatomic specimens. Flow studies show that moderate degrees of flexion and adduction in association with dislocation obstruct venous flow just distal to the femoral sheath at normal pressures and flow rates. Internal femoral rotation during a posterior approach to the hip causes \"scissoring\" of the femoral vein between femur and pubic bone. External femoral rotation during an anterior approach does not occlude flow. Injection of Batson's acrylic and neoprene latex showed that obstruction is also due to about 4 cm of shortening caused by proximal migration of the femur after dislocation in association with adduction and flexion. The femoral vein in the unsupported segment distal to the femoral sheath subsequently buckles and kinks. During operative manipulation, intermittent obstruction at this level is therefore likely to cause intermittent venous distension distally. This mechanism depletes the femoral vein of fibrinolytic activity distal to the occlusion and may explain the incidence of deep femoral thrombosis peculiar to this procedure.\r"

  ".W": "Idiopathic tibia vara or Blount's disease can be classified into three age-onset groups: (1) infantile, less than three years; (2) juvenile, four to ten years; and (3) adolescent, 11 years or older. The latter two groups comprise late-onset tibia vara, which is much less common than the infantile-onset form. In a comparison of eight juvenile-onset patients (13 knees) and seven adolescent-onset patients (nine knees), there were essentially no significant clinical, roentgenographic, or physeal-histopathologic differences. Both groups had severe obesity, mild to moderate varus deformities, and less-pronounced roentgenographic characteristics. Histopathologic analyses of the entire physis from the proximal tibia in five cases (seven knees) were essentially identical in patients with the infantile form as well as in those with slipped-capital femoral epiphyses, suggesting a common etiology. Recurrence of deformity after surgical correction occurred frequently in the juvenile onset males but not in juvenile onset females or the adolescent onset group. Incomplete correction of the varus deformity occurred more frequently in the latter group. The etiology for tibia vara appears to involve varus stress growth suppression, and disruption of endochondral ossification. The major differences between the three groups is due to the age at clinical onset, the amount of remaining growth, and the magnitude of the medial compression forces across the medial aspect of the knee.\r"

  ".W": "Several extracellular matrices are formed by healing fractures, and the collagens within these matrices have been identified in rabbit and rat fracture models. Type III collagen is the major collagen of the fibrous matrix that forms along the periosteal surface. Type I collagen is secreted in large amounts as trabeculae of bone develop within the fibrous tissue. Type V collagen is found in both the fibrous tissue and bone; it is particularly associated with blood vessels. Type II collagen is the last of the major collagens to be synthesized; its synthesis is dependent on the mechanical conditions under which the fractures are healing. A large area of cartilage, and hence of Type II collagen, is formed only if the fracture is mechanically unstable. Of the minor collagens, only Types IX and X have been identified to date. Type IX collagen is present throughout the large areas of cartilage, and Type X is present only in calcified regions. The matrices are compared with those produced during embryonic limb development. Although cartilage in the embryo provides a rapidly growing model of the future bone, in healing fractures cartilage is produced only where the cellular environment precludes the differentiation of osteoblasts. The effects of mechanical stability on the matrices support and illustrate this conclusion.\r"

The unique metabolic adaptations of denning bears, however, suggest that these animals have evolved osteoregulatory mechanisms to protect against osteoporosis. The authors studied calcium and bone metabolism in black bears during three seasons: summer, winter, and spring. The serum calcium concentration did not change despite the fact that the bears remained metabolically active, recumbent, and anuric for four months. Furthermore, after four months of skeletal inactivity, bone mass and other parameters of osseous metabolism, including bone formation and mineral apposition rates were unchanged over summer values. A hypermetabolic state was observed after spring arousal in response to resumed skeletal loading. These findings suggest that bears may produce an osteoregulatory mechanism that prevents bone loss during prolonged periods of skeletal inactivity. Such a substance could have potential therapeutic applications for human beings.\r"

Malignant bone tumors (n = 59) were less frequent, and osteosarcoma (n = 48) was by far the most common sarcoma. Soft-tissue lesions (n = 31) were much less frequent and included rhabdomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, fibrosarcoma, and desmoid tumors. A careful history, physical examination, and review of roentgenograms are essential to avoid errors in diagnosis. Malignant tumors require roentgenograms and laboratory studies in sequence to stage the patient. A properly performed biopsy established the diagnosis in most instances. Popliteal cysts, stress fractures, infection, myositis ossificans, histiocytosis, and other lesions can mimic tumors and delay correct diagnosis.\r"

Most tests were removed after 48 h and evaluated after 72 or 96 h, according to generally accepted recommendations. There were positive test reactions to all 11 allergens tested in the patient group. The concordance of positive reactions (1+, 2+, 3+) was 63% between TRUE Test, Panel 2 and the control method; 17% of positive reactions occurred only with TRUE Test, Panel 2 and 20% only with the compared method. Approximately 75% of all positive test reactions were explained by the patients' present or past history. Irritant/questionable reactions occurred in the same frequency for the 2 methods. Such reactions were recorded in less than 1% of all patches applied. No late reactions were recorded.\r"

All patients had a restrictive ventilatory defect but none had airflow limitation (FEV1/FVC = 0.93 +/- 0.05) (range, 0.86 to 0.97). Specific airway conductance (sGaw) improved significantly with both albuterol (p less than 0.01) and ipratropium bromide (p less than 0.01) but FEV1 did not. Only one HLT patient had bronchoconstriction with propranolol, whereas all but one were hyperresponsive to methacholine. Prior inhalation of ipratropium bromide blocked the response to methacholine (p less than 0.005). Serial methacholine provocation tests performed in seven long-term survivors of HLT 24.6 +/- 16.0 months (range, 12 to 51 months) after HLT revealed no time-dependent evolution of bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine. Limited maximal airway narrowing to methacholine was seen in five HLT recipients who showed a 29 +/- 4 percent (range, 23 to 35 percent) fall in FEV1 compared with two patients who did not achieve a plateau with a 47 percent and 63 percent fall in FEV1, respectively. These results further our understanding of bronchial responsiveness in the denervated transplanted lung. The findings of stable hyperresponsiveness to methacholine over a prolonged time interval, limited maximal airway narrowing to methacholine, and blockade of methacholine hyperresponsiveness by ipratropium bromide support the concept of denervation hypersensitivity of muscarinic receptors.\r"

The expression of the transferrin receptor (TrfR) in tumor cells was compared with histopathologic prognostic factors, such as TNM factors, degree of histologic differentiation, degree of nuclear atypia, and frequency of mitotic figures. The expression of TrfR showed significant correlation with the degree of histopathologic differentiation (p less than 0.025), degree of nuclear atypia (p less than 0.025), and frequency of mitotic figures (p less than 0.001). However, there was no definite correlation with TNM factors. These results indicate that the expression of the TrfR in pulmonary adenocarcinoma corresponds to the elevated proliferative activity of the tumor cells, and that immunohistochemical reactivity with OKT9 can be used as one of the histopathologic indicators of prognosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma.\r"

All patients suffered from mild to moderate ARI (PaO2/FIO2 of 125 to 350 mm Hg). The patients were randomly assigned to a PSV group (n = 28) or a control group with continued CPPV (n = 27). The usual hemodynamic and oxygenation variables, ITBV, and extravascular lung water (ETV) were assessed before and six hours after switching to PSV. The changes (d) of PaO2/FIO2, RI, and P(A-a)O2 were used for evaluation of the effect of PSV. Significant correlations were found between the ETV(CPPV) and dPaO2/FIO2 (r = -0.672), ETV(CPPV) and dRI (r = 0.722), and ETV(CPPV) and dP(A-a)O2 (r = 0.601), which led to the conclusion that the level of ETV determined the efficacy of PSV. In the subgroup with ETV less than 11 ml/kg (n = 15), PSV significantly improved PaO2/FIO2 (248 to 286 mm Hg), RI (1.55 to 1.22), ITBV (801 to 888 ml/m2), cardiac index (4.21 to 4.76 L/min.m2), stroke index (42.2 to 48.1 ml/m2), and oxygen delivery (735 to 833 ml/min.m2). In the subgroup with ETV greater than 11 ml/kg (n = 13), PSV caused a significant deterioration of PaO2/FIO2, RI, and intrapulmonary shunt. It is concluded that in patients with moderate ARI in whom ETV is almost normal, PSV is superior to CPPV, and the efficacy of PSV is independent of the level of oxygenation during CPPV.\r"

Clinically, it is manifested by instability of the fibrin hemostatic plug and prolonged or delayed bleeding, which is more serious in patients who are homozygous for this trait. A patient scheduled for aortic valve replacement and coronary bypass presented with a history of repeated episodes of postoperative bleeding. Hemostatic laboratory evaluation revealed that the patient had the heterozygous form of alpha 2-antiplasmin deficiency with a serum concentration of 52 percent (normal, greater than 65 percent of the activity of pooled plasma). He underwent preoperative plasmapheresis with administration of 3,000 ml of fresh frozen plasma, which resulted in an increase in the preoperative level of alpha 2-antiplasmin to 78 percent. Although postoperative blood loss was greater than normal, it was easily managed. Preoperative identification of this rare coagulation abnormality permitted appropriate treatment and probably prevented a postoperative death from hemorrhage.\r"

The clinical spectrum varies from the incidental discovery of a pathologically raised monoclonal immunoglobulin on routine electrophoresis in asymptomatic patients to widespread skeletal involvement with incapacitating bone pain. Symptoms may result from a solitary tumor mass, described as an extramedullary plasmacytoma, in virtually any part of the body. Metabolic abnormalities commonly include hypercalcemia, elevated plasma urate levels, or the development of amyloidosis, all of which may disturb renal function. High paraprotein levels cause hyperviscosity, resulting in generalized debility and varying degrees of disturbed mental function. The natural history is determined by the mass of the tumor coupled with its unique biologic features. Median survival of unselected patients, without effective treatment but once symptoms are evident, is approximately 7 months; this period can be significantly prolonged with appropriate therapy. As a first step, urgent medical management is often necessary, centering on rehydration, correction of hyperviscosity, and reversal of metabolic defects, each of which may improve renal function. Over the longer term, specific antitumor drugs have extended median survival to approximately 30 months, and most regimens include a combination of melphalan and prednisone, with or without other cytotoxic drugs. Alternative forms of treatment include sequential hemibody irradiation, recombinant alpha interferon, and in suitably selected patients, high-dose chemoradiotherapy followed by bone marrow transplantation. The latter approaches offer promising management options and are currently the subject of evaluation in controlled clinical trials.\r"

Glucokinase explains the capacity, hexose specificity, affinities, sigmoidicity, and anomeric preference of pancreatic islet glycolysis, and because stimulation of glucose metabolism is a prerequisite of glucose stimulation of insulin release, glucokinase also explains many characteristics of this beta-cell function. Glucokinase of the beta-cell is induced or activated by glucose in contrast to liver glucokinase, which is regulated by insulin. Tissue-specific regulation corresponds with observations that liver and pancreatic beta-cell glucokinase are structurally distinct. Glucokinase could play a glucose-sensor role in hepatocytes as well, and certain forms of diabetes mellitus might be due to glucokinase deficiencies in pancreatic beta-cells, hepatocytes, or both.\r"

Of the 15 children, 12 were positive for 64K antibodies at diagnosis. Those patients who were negative for these antibodies at onset remained negative throughout the study. Modest increases in 64K antibodies were observed in 7 patients within 1 mo of diabetes onset, concomitant with an increase in C-peptide concentrations. All antibody-positive patients were still positive at the end of the study, with no significant decrease in antibody levels relative to those at diagnosis, whereas C-peptide concentrations decreased between 3 and 24 mo after onset. Islet cell antibodies, measured by immunochemical staining on sections of rat pancreas, were detected in 9 of 15 patients at onset, whereas only 3 of 11 patients were still positive after 3 yr. In an additional group of 11 patients with diabetes for 6-7 yr, when basal and stimulated C-peptide concentrations were undetectable, 4 patients were still positive for 64K antibodies. These results demonstrate that levels of 64K antibodies persist during the first 3 yr of diabetes, despite declining beta-cell function and decreased immune responses to other islet antigens, but decrease during the next 3-4 yr as the remaining functional beta-cells disappear.\r"

Because insulinlike growth factor I (IGF-I) is a potent mitogen for arterial smooth muscle cells in culture, we examined the hypothesis that IGF-I functions as an autocrine growth factor in the aorta. We also investigated the role of insulin in regulation of IGF-I expression in the aorta. With immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization techniques, IGF-I immunoreactivity and IGF-I mRNA were localized to the smooth muscle layer of the aorta. In diabetic rats, aortic IGF-I mRNA abundance was significantly reduced to 60.3 +/- 2.9% of controls (P less than 0.01). In nondiabetic rats, administration of insulin as an acute bolus (10 U i.p.) or a chronic infusion (2.4 U/day for 5 days) resulted in an approximately twofold increase in abundance of IGF-I mRNA in the aorta. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that IGF-I may function as an autocrine growth factor in the aorta and suggest that one of the mechanisms whereby hyperinsulinism may favor atherogenesis is enhanced expression of IGF-I in the vessel wall.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism controlling insulin accumulation in nuclei of H35 hepatoma cells was investigated by incubating intact cells with 125I-labeled insulin in the presence or absence of agents that perturb different intracellular sites involved in the processing of ligand-receptor complexes. Purified nuclei were isolated, and nuclear-associated 125I-insulin was determined. Insulin accumulation in the nuclei was time and temperature dependent. Nuclear accumulation was linear and insulin-concentration dependent between 5 and 50 ng insulin/ml. However, pharmacological concentrations of insulin increased the amount of insulin translocated to the nucleus to a far greater extent than it increased total cell-associated insulin. Chloroquine, an acidotrophic agent, increased total cell-associated and intracellular insulin but had no effect on nuclear accumulation. The monovalent ionophores monensin and nigericin inhibited nuclear accumulation of insulin at low concentrations (0.5-5.0 microM) without affecting total insulin binding or intracellular accumulation. At 10 or 25 microM, monensin and nigericin also acted as acidotrophic agents and increased total insulin binding and intracellular accumulation but inhibited nuclear accumulation by a maximum of 50%. Low concentrations of monensin and nigericin were additive; maximal concentrations were not. A 23187 and valinomycin did not affect insulin binding or intracellular and nuclear accumulation of insulin. Neither depletion of ATP by sodium azide, 2,4-dinitrophenol, sodium cyanide, or oligomycin nor disruption of cytoskeletal elements by cytochalasin D or colchicine had any effect on nuclear accumulation of insulin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

IC2 is a rat-rat hybridoma autoantibody produced from the BB rat; among islet cells, IC2 is beta-cell specific. A2B5 is an anti-ganglioside antibody described as labeling beta-cells. Islets of Langerhans from Lewis rats were isolated and cultured for 18 h in RPMI-1640 with five different glucose concentrations (2.2, 3.3, 5.5, 11.1, and 18.3 mM). In some experiments, islets were precultured for 2 or 3 days. After isolation of islet cells and antibody labeling, the percent of IC2+ beta-cells in the different groups increased from 33.3, 34.5, 40.9, and 57.2 to 58.6% (P less than 10(-6). For A2B5, the percent of labeled islet cells increased from 37.4, 41.8, 46.7, and 53.8 to 56.2% (P less than 10(-4). Thus, increasing glucose concentration leading to higher beta-cell activity implies an increase in antigen expression. Neither A2B5 nor IC2 reacts with insulin, as shown by absorption experiments and immune electron microscopy of binding sites. Electron microscopy of IC2-gold-labeled islet cells substantiated the beta-cell specificity of IC2. In conclusion, expression of the corresponding antigens to IC2 and A2B5 depends on the functional state of the beta-cells; because this has been shown to be an important factor in the development of insulin-dependent diabetes, our findings may be of potential pathogenetic interest.\r"

The routes of administration were intravenous or intraportal infusion. Intravenous infusion (0.33-5.0 micrograms CCK-8.kg-1.20 min-1) resulted in a biphasic response pattern consisting of a fast 1st-min rise in plasma insulin concentration and a slower second phase that lasted throughout the infusion. The first phase showed the same amplitude with all amounts of CCK-8 administered in this study, whereas the second phase exhibited dose dependency. Blood glucose levels were lowered during all infusions of CCK-8, although the second phase of insulin release was absent with the lowest dose. These results suggest a strong stimulatory effect of CCK-8 on the pancreatic beta-cells, probably by changing the set point for glucose. The described effects of intravenous administration of CCK-8 cannot be produced when the infusion is given into the portal vein. Only very high concentrations of CCK-8 (15 micrograms.kg-1.20 min-1) produced a small increase in plasma insulin levels, indicating a strong CCK-8-eliminating mechanism in the liver. These results indicate that 1) CCK-8 evokes biphasic insulin release and a concomitant drop in glucose levels, and 2) CCK-8 acting on the beta-cell in vivo is not of intestinal origin but is probably released by the pancreatic vagal branch.\r"

At comparable ages, 21 serums were obtained from 8 DP BB rats not developing diabetes, and 70 matched serums were obtained from 19 diabetes-resistant (DR) BB rats. Levels of antibody binding increased slightly with increasing age in DP and matched DR rats. Two rats were positive at onset of IDDM in all assays but not in earlier samples. Otherwise, only few isolated serums from both types of rats regardless of diabetes had increased binding in one of the assays. In a cross-sectional study, the insulin-binding levels in 150-day-old DP rats (n = 20) that had not yet developed diabetes did not correlate with insulitis present in 3 of 20 rats and did not differ from 150-day-old DR BB rats (n = 20).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We used in vitro lymphocyte-transformation studies to examine the reactivity of various insulin formulations in diabetic patients with (n = 4) and without (n = 8) cutaneous allergies. Nonspecific response to concanavalin A demonstrated a greater than 40-fold response in both groups. Control patients did not respond to the addition of commercial insulin preparations (stimulation index [SI] less than 4), whereas allergic patients had an 11-fold response to beef (P less than 0.01), a 10-fold response to pork (P less than 0.01), and a 6-fold response to human (P less than 0.01) insulins. This response was limited to a single insulin manufacturer's preparations and was uniform in all three species tested. Efforts to identify the offending agent revealed no lymphoblast transformation when crystalline insulin was used or when commercial preparations were purified to a single peak by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Pure crystalline insulin dimers of beef, pork, and human species were tested; control subjects responded with mean SIs of 1.9, 1.9, and 1.8, respectively, whereas allergic patients showed greater reactivity to beef (SI 7.3) and pork (SI 14.8). The lymphoblast-transformation response to crystalline human dimer was dose dependent with mean SIs of 0.9 at low concentration (2.8 ng/ml) and 19.2 at a higher concentration (20.4 ng/ml). The commercial insulin preparations were run on size-exclusion HPLC to determine high-molecular-weight aggregate content. Independent of species, a single manufacturer had products demonstrating aggregate levels 3- to 6-fold higher than those found in other manufacturers' preparations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Dams (F0) were rendered hyperglycemic by continuous glucose infusion during the last week of pregnancy. Females born of these rats (F1) exhibited glucose intolerance and impaired insulin secretion in vivo at adulthood. When they were 3 mo old, they were matched with males born of control dams. During pregnancy, their glucose tolerance remained impaired compared with that of controls. Consequently, F2 newborns of F1 hyperglycemic dams showed the main features of newborns from diabetic mothers: they were hyperglycemic, hyperinsulinemic, and macrosomic. As adults, they displayed basal hyperglycemia and defective glucose tolerance and insulin secretion. This indicates that the long-range deteriorating effects on glucose homeostasis of gestational hyperglycemia in the F1 generation are transmitted to the F2 generation and suggests that a perturbed fetal metabolic environment contributes to the inheritance of diabetes mellitus.\r"

Before transplantation, all diabetic recipients (3 newly diagnosed and 3 with diabetes duration of 5, 6, and 12 yr, respectively) were in good glycemic control (mean fasting blood glucose 7.95 +/- 1.62 mM, mean HbA1c 7.6 +/- 0.2%).

All recipients were treated with the same immunosuppressive protocol (cyclosporin, prednisone, and since 1986, azathioprine and antilymphocyte globulin), and mean dose and blood levels of cyclosporin were not significantly different between diabetic and nondiabetic recipients. After heart transplantation (mean follow-up 558 +/- 340 days in diabetic and 379 +/- 338 in nondiabetic recipients), the mortality rate and complications (i.e., rejection episodes, supplementary immunosuppressive treatments, major and minor infections, arterial hypertension, and graft atherosclerosis) showed no significant differences except for the more frequent arterial hypertension in diabetic recipients (P less than 0.05), although pretransplantation incidence of hypertension was lower in diabetic candidates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Our results showed that, in diabetic rats, fetal hypotrophy was associated with a significant reduction in arterial blood velocity in the uterine artery (P less than 0.001), placenta (P less than 0.01), umbilical artery (P less than 0.01), and fetal aorta (P less than 0.05). This was not observed when diabetic rats were treated with insulin. Treatment of rats with the alpha 1-blocking vasodilator nicergoline restored fetal growth and arterial blood velocity to control values without affecting the degree of hyperglycemia. Nicergoline in control rats did not change fetal weight and caused only minor hemodynamic changes on presumably already maximally vasodilated arteries. We concluded that the uteroplacental hemodynamic disturbances observed in diabetic rats play a major role in the establishment of fetal growth retardation.\r"

Consequently, we studied the arterial and portal venous concentration differences (A-PV) for glucose and glucogenic substrates in the basal state and 3 h after the ingestion of a 100-g glucose load with the catheter technique. Five patients were studied 3-11 days after surgery for gallbladder disease or cancer of the colon or liver. A-PV for glucose in the basal state was 0.12 +/- 0.02 mM (P less than 0.01), indicating net glucose uptake by extrahepatic splanchnic tissues. No net exchange of lactate or pyruvate was detected, but there was release of alanine and uptake of glutamine. After glucose ingestion, glucose was released by the gut, reflecting absorption of the load (mean A-PV for glucose -2.10 +/- 0.04 mM, P less than 0.01). The arterial glucose concentration rose gradually from 4.6 +/- 0.1 mM before glucose ingestion to a plateau at 9.5 +/- 0.7 mM from 90 to 180 min. Glucose ingestion was accompanied by net lactate and alanine release (A-PV -0.16 +/- 0.06 mM and -48 +/- 7 microM, respectively), whereas A-PV for pyruvate did not change. We conclude that, in postoperative patients, there is a significant net glucose uptake by the gastrointestinal tract in the basal state. Glucose ingestion is accompanied by a small release of lactate and alanine from the intestine. However, the estimated net gut formation of lactate and alanine can play only a minor role in the disposal of an oral glucose load.\r"

  ".W": "Recent interest has focused on the potential role of amylin in the pathogenesis of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). This 37-amino acid peptide is found in extracellular amyloid deposits in approximately 50% of pancreatic islets of patients with NIDDM and has been shown to inhibit skeletal muscle glycogen synthesis in vitro. Immunocytochemical studies have colocalized amylin and insulin within beta-cell secretory granules in nondiabetic humans, provoking the following questions. Is amylin cosecreted with insulin? Are circulating amylin concentrations higher in patients with NIDDM either before or after food ingestion? To answer these questions, we developed a sensitive and specific immunoassay to measure plasma concentrations of amylin in humans. Use of this assay indicated that, in lean nondiabetic subjects, glucose ingestion resulted in an increase (P less than 0.001) in the plasma concentration of amylin (from 2.03 +/- 0.22 to 3.78 +/- 0.39 pM) and insulin (from 48.3 +/- 3.1 to 265 +/- 44 pM). There was a significant correlation between the concentrations of insulin and amylin (r = 0.74, P less than 0.001) and the increase in insulin and amylin concentration (r = 0.65, P less than 0.005). Fasting concentrations of amylin did not differ in diabetic and weight-matched nondiabetic subjects and showed a similar pattern of change after ingestion of a mixed meal. We conclude that amylin is secreted in response to ingestion of either glucose or a mixed meal and circulates at concentrations that do not differ in patients with NIDDM and nondiabetic subjects. It remains to be determined whether amylin at physiological concentrations influences carbohydrate metabolism and if so whether its effects differ in diabetic and nondiabetic humans.\r"

One site was a five-physician private family practice setting with about 15,000 patients. During 34 days, 576 patients were screened, of whom 22% were smokers. Among the smokers screened, 54% consented, 33% refused consent, and 13% were called in too early to consent. The other site was a six-physician academic medical practice with about 16,000 patients. During 53 days, 1,692 subjects were screened, of whom 16.2% were smokers. Among the smokers, 19% consented, 81% refused consent, and none were called in early. The enrollment of smokers was 3.3 times greater in the private practice than the academic practice. At the first site, study personnel screened 26.6 subjects per day, whereas the practice receptionist screened only 13.4 subjects per day (P less than .01). A randomized trial of having subjects read the informed consent versus having study personnel read it to them showed no differences in recruitment. The data suggest that private practices may have greater potential for subject recruitment than academic sites, that using study personnel improves recruitment, and that having study personnel actively involved in informed consent does not improve recruitment.\r"

  ".W": "Nodular regenerative hyperplasia is defined by hepatocellular nodules distributed throughout the liver in the absence of fibrous septa between the nodules. Most reports have been single cases so that the prevalence and clinical significance of nodular regenerative hyperplasia is uncertain. In this study, the hepatic histology of 2,500 consecutive autopsies was reviewed. A spectrum of nodular transformation was found with nodular regenerative hyperplasia present in 2.6% of autopsy livers and qualitatively similar but lesser degrees of nodular transformation in a further 10.2%. Nodular transformation was also seen in 47% of livers with cirrhosis and 69% with incomplete cirrhosis. Obliteration of many small portal veins was seen in all cases with nodular regenerative hyperplasia, but only 4.7% of these had evidence of portal hypertension. The prevalence of various clinical states was compared in nodular regenerative hyperplasia and in controls. The results confirm, extend and quantify the spectrum of associated diseases. Nodular regenerative hyperplasia occurs in 5.6% of individuals over age 80 and with increased frequency in patients with systemic arteritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, massive tumor infiltration and mineral oil deposition. Nodular regenerative hyperplasia appears to be the hepatic analogue of arterial and arteriolar nephrosclerosis. A new classification of nodular transformation is proposed that encompasses the spectrum of lesions described here and the previously defined entities of focal nodular hyperplasia, partial nodular transformation and \"cirrhosis telangiectasia hepatis.\" The major conclusion is that nodular regenerative hyperplasia is a secondary and nonspecific tissue adaptation to heterogeneous distribution of blood flow and does not represent a specific entity.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify the pathogenesis of hepatic iron toxicity, we investigated the effect of chronic dietary iron overload on the expression of several genes in rat liver. After 10 wk of iron treatment, when only minor histological features of liver damage were appreciable, the level of pro-alpha 2(I)-collagen mRNA was already higher than in control liver and increased further at 30 wk of treatment. Also, the relative amount of L ferritin subunit mRNA was enhanced early by iron load and was even more elevated at the latest time point considered, whereas neither H ferritin subunit nor transferrin mRNA levels were affected by iron treatment. In contrast, after chronic iron treatment, no variations were found in the steady-state level of mRNAs transcribed from liver-specific and preferentially expressed genes (albumin, alpha-fetoprotein, apolipoprotein A-1), growth-related genes (c-myc, c-Ha-ras and c-fos) and stress-induced genes (heat shock protein 70). These results suggest that chronic dietary iron overload in rats can specifically activate target genes in the liver (i.e., L ferritin and procollagen) in the absence of either histological signs of severe liver damage or alterations in differentiated liver functions.\r"

A retrospective study on 117 patients (104 men, 13 women; mean age +/- standard deviation: 53.8 +/- 12.4 yr) who had hepatectomy for large hepatocellular carcinoma (diameter greater than or equal to 5 cm) was conducted to identify an at-risk population for tumor recurrence. Disease-free survival was correlated with 22 clinical (n = 5), serological (n = 2), gross pathological (n = 3) and histological (n = 12) features of the resected specimens using Cox's multivariate regression analysis. Recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma was detected in 74 patients within a median follow-up period of 13.7 mo. Although 17 patients had extrahepatic disease alone, recurrence was confined to the hepatic remnant in 40 patients. Disease-free survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 yr were 40%, 19% and 12%, respectively. Two of the five histological parameters isolated, negative resection margin (p less than 0.01) and encapsulation (p less than 0.006), were identified as favorable independent prognostic predictors. When patients with positive margins were excluded from the analysis, repeated calculation showed that encapsulation was the only important determinant. From this analysis, detailed histological study of the resected tumor is seen to be the only satisfactory means for assessing long-term prognosis. An aggressive approach is warranted among patients with encapsulated tumors. Even with a clear resection margin, adjuvant treatment should be considered for those patients who have unencapsulated lesions.\r"

  ".W": "Woodchuck hepatitis virus infection of the eastern woodchuck represents a useful model for the study of hepatitis B virus infection and disease in humans, including hepatocellular carcinoma. In man, hepatocellular carcinoma is frequently detected and monitored using assays for serum alpha-fetoprotein. To study the relationship between alpha-fetoprotein and woodchuck hepatitis virus-induced hepatocellular carcinoma in the woodchuck model, we produced a monoclonal antibody to woodchuck alpha-fetoprotein and used biophysical and immunochemical methods to demonstrate its specificity and affinity (7 x 10(8) L/mol) for woodchuck alpha-fetoprotein. A competition radioimmunoassay was then developed and standardized for measuring serum alpha-fetoprotein concentrations. In the radioimmunoassay system, woodchuck alpha-fetoprotein was detected between 20 ng/ml (20% to 25% inhibition) and 8,500 ng/ml (97% to 98% inhibition). Elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein concentrations (450 to 452,000 ng/ml) were measured in 21 of 23 woodchucks in the advanced stages of woodchuck hepatitis virus-induced hepatocellular carcinoma. Serum alpha-fetoprotein was elevated above normal (greater than or equal to 450 ng/ml) as early as 3 to 11 mo before terminal hepatocellular carcinoma in 11 of 16 of the woodchuck hepatitis virus-carrier woodchucks. In a pilot study, serum alpha-fetoprotein became markedly elevated above normal in woodchuck hepatitis virus-carrier woodchucks that developed hepatocellular carcinoma but not in serologically recovered or uninfected woodchucks (i.e., without hepatocellular carcinoma). Thus, alpha-fetoprotein may provide a useful noninvasive marker in the woodchuck model for detecting and monitoring woodchuck hepatitis virus-induced hepatocellular carcinoma from earlier stages.\r"

  ".W": "In all forms of chronic hypertension, the renal-pressure natriuresis mechanism is abnormal because sodium excretion is the same as in normotension despite the increased blood pressure. However, the importance of this resetting of pressure natriuresis as a cause of hypertension is controversial. Theoretically, a resetting of pressure natriuresis could necessitate increased blood pressure to maintain sodium balance or it could occur secondarily to hypertension. Recent studies indicate that, in several models of experimental hypertension (including angiotensin II, aldosterone, adrenocorticotrophic hormone, and norepinephrine hypertension), a primary shift of renal-pressure natriuresis necessitates increased arterial pressure to maintain sodium and water balance. In genetic animal models of hypertension, there also appears to be a resetting of pressure natriuresis before the development of hypertension. Likewise, essential hypertensive patients exhibit abnormal pressure natriuresis, although the precise cause of this defect is not clear. It is likely that multiple renal defects contribute to resetting of pressure natriuresis in essential hypertensive patients. With long-standing hypertension, pathological changes that occur secondary to hypertension must also be considered. By analyzing the characteristics of pressure natriuresis in hypertensive patients and by comparing these curves to those observed in various forms of experimental hypertension of known origin, it is possible to gain insight into the etiology of this disease.\r"

We tested the hypothesis that the abnormal sodium handling in spontaneously hypertensive rats (Okamoto-Aoki strain) is related to a decreased dopaminergic response by studying the effects of the intrarenal infusion of the dopamine-1 agonist SKF-38393 and the dopamine-1 antagonist SCH-23390 in hypertensive and in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats. Rats (9-16 weeks old) were studied with renal nerves intact under pentobarbital anesthesia (n = 5-6 in each group). Specificity of dopamine-1 effects of SKF-38393 was verified because its natriuretic effect was blocked in a dose-related manner by the dopamine-1 antagonist SCH-23390 (n = 5). Intrarenal but resulted in a dose-related natriuresis and diuresis in normotensive but not in hypertensive rats. Intrarenal arterial infusion of the dopamine-1 antagonist SCH-23390 alone induced an antinatriuresis, without affecting glomerular filtration rate, in normotensive but not in hypertensive rats. Addition of the dopamine-2 antagonist YM-09151 to the dopamine-1 antagonist infusion did not enhance the effect of the dopamine-1 antagonist. The lack of response to the dopamine-1 agonist or antagonist in hypertensive rats was not due to differences in renal dopamine-1 receptor density (1.3 +/- 0.3 pmol/mg protein for spontaneously hypertensive rats, n = 4; 1 +/- 0.2 for Wistar-Kyoto rats, n = 4) or affinity; distribution determined by autoradiography was also similar. The abnormal renal sodium handling in 9-16-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats is in part due to decreased response distal to the dopamine-1 receptor.\r"

A \"low thyroid state\" may contribute to the adverse cardiovascular effects of diabetes in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). We tested this hypothesis by comparing the effects of thyroid hormone with those of insulin treatment on cardiac performance of diabetic SHR. Diabetes was induced with streptozotocin (45 mg/kg). Subsets of diabetic rats were treated with either insulin (10-20 units/kg/day) or triiodothyronine (8-10 micrograms/kg/day). Heart rate and systolic arterial pressure were obtained at weekly intervals. After 8 weeks, cardiac function was assessed using an isolated working heart preparation. Diabetes reduced arterial pressure and heart rate in vivo and markedly depressed cardiac performance under volume and pressure loading conditions ex vivo, confirming previous observations. As expected, insulin treatment prevented the bradycardia and depressor effect in vivo and the impairment of cardiac performance ex vivo caused by diabetes. The triiodothyronine treatment duplicated the effects of insulin on the hemodynamic measurements in vivo, and corrected nearly all depressed indexes of performance of diabetic SHR hearts ex vivo. Both treatment regimens successfully reduced 8-week mortality when compared with the untreated diabetic group. The results support the hypothesis that a low thyroid state may contribute to the cardiovascular dysfunction in diabetic SHR. Left ventricular hypertrophy may be an important factor in this phenomenon.\r"

Left ventricular hypertrophy exacerbates the adverse effects of diabetes on cardiac performance, but its effects on relaxation variables have not been well characterized. We examined the impact of streptozotocin-induced diabetes (8 weeks) on ventricular pressure load-dependent relaxation and sarcoplasmic reticular calcium uptake of hearts from spontaneously hypertensive rats and Wistar-Kyoto rats. Subsets of diabetic hypertensive rats were treated with either insulin (10 units/kg/day) or triiodothyronine (8-10 micrograms/kg/day). Diabetes impaired load-dependent relaxation and depressed sarcoplasmic reticular calcium uptake only in spontaneously hypertensive rat hearts. Either insulin or triiodothyronine treatment prevented the diabetes-induced depressions of both mechanical and biochemical indexes of relaxation. The results suggest that 1) hypertrophic ventricles of spontaneously hypertensive rats are more susceptible to the detrimental effects of diabetes on relaxation indexes than are the nonhypertrophic Wistar-Kyoto rat ventricles, and 2) the hypothyroidism that attends diabetes may contribute to the impaired relaxation of diabetic spontaneously hypertensive rat left ventricle.\r"

It therefore seems plausible that [Ca2+]i constitutes the crucial link between the initial stimulus for hypertensive hypertrophy (elevated perfusion pressure) and the secondary alterations in gene expression.

We found that the 52 patients dialyzed in unit A had much higher mean aluminium levels (100 micrograms/L) than those from the other two units (61 and 39 micrograms/L respectively). In unit A, where water treatment by reverse osmosis had been introduced only recently, 30.8% of patients had fractures/looser zones, 46.2% had rugger-jersey spine and 28.8% had skeletal erosions. When these patients were divided into two groups according to whether their serum aluminium concentration was below or above 100 micrograms/l, the latter patients had significantly lower alkaline phosphatase, serum phosphate, and higher total prescribed dose of aluminium hydroxide. It was concluded that both dialysate aluminium and oral aluminium intake seemed to have contributed to the high incidence of osteomalacic fractures among Unit A patients. In eight of these patients serum aluminium increased by more than 150 micrograms/L after four weeks of receiving 1.5 g desferrioxamine twice weekly. Serial X-rays showed that the mean time after dialysis for the appearance of fractures/Looser zones was 72 months. Three patients developed fractures/Looser zones after successful renal transplantation; and it was postulated that the prompt excretion of aluminium permitted increased osteoclastic activity, resulting in fractures in these patients.\r"

A region of the lateral tegmental field of the medulla is critical for the neurogenesis of the gasp but has no role in eupnea. Neuronal mechanisms in separate brain stem regions may be responsible for the neurogenesis of different ventilatory patterns. This hypothesis is supported by the recording of independent respiratory rhythms simultaneously from isolated brain stem segments. Data from fetal and neonatal animals also support gasping and eupnea being generated by separate mechanisms. Gasping may represent the output of a simple but rugged pattern generator that functions as a backup system until the control system for eupnea is developed. Pacemaker elements are hypothesized as underlying the onset of inspiratory activity in gasping. Similar elements, in a different brain stem region, may be responsible for the onset of the eupneic inspiration with neural circuits involving the pons, the medulla, and the spinal cord serving to shape efferent respiratory-modulated neural discharges.\r"

On inflation of bladders isolated to lower limbs, lung volumes did not change but bronchial response to MC increased, as evidenced by a greater fall in the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) at the highest dose of MC used compared with control without AST inflation (delta FEV1 = 0.94 +/- 0.40 vs. 0.66 +/- 0.46 liter, P less than 0.001). Full inflation of AST, i.e., lower limb and abdominal bladder inflated, significantly reduced vital capacity (P less than 0.001), functional residual capacity (P less than 0.01), and FEV1 (P less than 0.01) and enhanced the bronchial response to MC challenge compared with partial AST inflation (delta FEV1 = 1.28 +/- 0.47 liter, P less than 0.05). Because there was no significant reduction of lung volumes on partial AST inflation, the enhanced bronchial response to MC cannot be explained solely by changes in base-line lung volumes. An alternative explanation might be a congestion and/or edema of the airway wall on AST inflation. Therefore, to investigate further the mechanism of the increased bronchial response to MC, we pretreated the subjects with the inhaled alpha 1-adrenergic agonist methoxamine, which has both direct bronchoconstrictor and bronchial vasoconstrictor effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The dogs were prepared with a permanent side-hole tracheal stoma and were trained to sleep with a snout mask hermetically sealed in place while breathing through a cuffed endotracheal tube inserted distally into the tracheal stoma. Changes in tracheal smooth muscle tone were continuously monitored by measuring the pressure in the water-filled cuff that distended the tracheal airway while pressure changes were introduced in the upper airway independently of breathing. Increases or decreases of upper airway pressure (+/- 10 cmH2O) had little effect on tracheal airway smooth muscle tone. In contrast, an oscillating pressure wave at 30 Hz and +/- 3 cmH2O amplitude (or -3 to -7 cmH2O amplitude) caused a marked increase in tracheal airway smooth muscle tone. An elevated tracheal airway tone could be maintained over many minutes when the oscillating pressure stimulus was pulsed so that there was a cycle of 0.5 s on, 0.5 s off. This stimulus did not change the functional residual capacity but resulted in coughing, swallowing, or sighing in 54% of the tests. In the remaining tests, the pressure stimulus produced a rapid, shallow, and erratic breathing pattern. The tracheal airway constrictor response (but not the ventilatory response) was completely abolished by intravenous atropine. We suggest that upper airway vibration is a potentially powerful mechanism of reflex airway smooth muscle constriction.\r"

It is important however, to define the likelihood that individual RIP measurements of VT and delta FRC would be acceptably accurate (+/- 10%) for clinical and investigational purposes in spontaneously breathing individuals on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Additionally, RIP accuracy has not been compared in these regards after calibration by two commonly employed techniques, the least squares (LSQ) and the quantitative diagnostic calibration (QDC) methods. We compared RIP with pneumotachographic (PTH) measurements of delta FRC and VT during spontaneous mouth breathing on 0-10 cmH2O CPAP. Comparisons were made after RIP calibration with both the LSQ (6 subjects) and QDC (7 subjects) methods. Measurements of delta FRC by RIPLSQ and RIPQDC were highly correlated with PTH measurements (r = 0.94 +/- 0.04 and r = 0.98 +/- 0.01 (SE), respectively). However, only an average of 30% of RIPQDC determinations per subject and 31.4% of RIPLSQ determinations per subject were accurate to +/- 10% of PTH values. An average of 55.2% (QDC) and 68.8% (LSQ) of VT determinations per subject were accurate to +/- 10% of PTH values. We conclude that in normal subjects, over a large number of determinations, RIP values for delta FRC and VT at elevated end-expiratory lung volume correlate well with PTH values. However, regardless of whether QDC or LSQ calibration is used, only about one-third of individual RIP determinations of delta FRC and one-half of two-thirds of VT measurements will be sufficiently accurate for clinical and investigational use.\r"

It is widely believed that in the postprandial period both insulin and glucose increase GU by increasing the AVGd; however, a role for increments in BF in the disposal and tolerance of an OGL has not been established. To investigate this issue, whole body GU (isotope dilution), leg GU (leg balance technique), leg BF, and cardiac index (CI) were measured after an overnight fast and over 180 min after an OGL (1 g/kg) in 8 lean (ln) and 8 obese (ob) subjects [mean +/- SEM age, 36 +/- 2 vs. 37 +/- 2 yr (P = NS) and 60 +/- 1 vs. 99 +/- 5 kg (P less than 0.01), respectively]. Serum glucose levels were higher in the ob than in the ln subjects between 100 and 160 min, indicating reduced glucose tolerance. Fasting and post-OGL serum insulin levels were 2- to 3-fold higher in ob vs. ln at all times, indicating insulin resistance. Peak (40-80 min) incremental whole body GU above baseline was 32% lower in ob vs. ln, (P less than 0.05). Peak femoral AVGd was not different between ob and ln (0.55 +/- 0.16 vs. 0.66 +/- 0.14 mmol/L; P = NS). Peak leg BF increased 36% over baseline in ln (0.328 +/- 0.052 to 0.449 +/- 0.073 L/min; P less than 0.05), while ob subjects displayed no change in leg BF from baseline. Consequently, peak leg GU was 44% lower in ob vs. ln (P less than 0.05). CI increased 24% from baseline at 60 min in ln (P less than 0.05), but was unchanged in ob. In summary, after an OGL 1) femoral AVGd increases in both ln and ob subjects, but skeletal muscle BF and CI increase in ln only; 2) since peak femoral AVGd values were similar in ln and ob, differences in peak leg GU and (by inference) whole body GU are largely due to reduced BF to insulin-sensitive tissues; and 3) hemodynamics play an important role in the physiological disposal of an OGL, and therefore, hemodynamic defects can potentially contribute to reduced glucose tolerance and insulin resistance.\r"

  ".W": "An exogenous insulin administration-modified, frequently sampled iv glucose tolerance test (FSIGT) for application in insulin-dependent diabetic patients (IDDM) to allow for estimation of insulin sensitivity (SI) and glucose effectiveness (SG) with Bergman's minimal model of glucose kinetics was investigated. An insulin infusion protocol (either 4 or 8 mU/min.kg from 20-25 min) was compared to the standard tolbutamide-modified (300 mg at 20 min) FSIGT in normal control subjects. SI and SG were not different for the insulin infusion- and tolbutamide-modified protocols [SI, 2.8 +/- 0.4, 3.6 +/- 0.6, and 2.5 +/- 0.5 X 10(4) min1/(microU/mL), respectively]. SI and SG were quantified in insulin-requiring newly diagnosed IDDM and in noninsulin-requiring IDDM in clinical remission with the exogenous insulin administration protocol. Both SI and SG were reduced in newly diagnosed IDDM compared to normal controls (by 64% and 40%, respectively). SI was normalized in IDDM in clinical remission despite a continued poor insulin secretory response to both glucose and tolbutamide. Although SI was normal in patients in clinical remission, SG remained reduced (by 65%) compared to that in normal controls. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that modification of the FSIGT with the exogenous administration of insulin allows for estimation of insulin sensitivity and glucose effectiveness in IDDM patients. Comparison to the standard protocol in normal subjects suggests that this results in valid measurements of insulin sensitivity and glucose effectiveness. Results of the application of this protocol in IDDM were consistent with previous observations that insulin sensitivity is reduced in poorly controlled IDDM and normalized in well controlled patients. Glucose effectiveness was found to be reduced in all IDDM subjects regardless of the degree of control.\r"

The metabolic clearance of C-peptide, assessed by decay analysis after bolus injection of biosynthetic human C-peptide, was not changed by weight loss (0.143 +/- 0.009 L/min.m2 vs. 0.137 +/- 0.010 L/min.m2). Kinetic parameters from each individual's decay curve before and after weight loss were used to derive accurate rates of secretion during the basal (postabsorptive) state, an oral glucose tolerance test and two hyperglycemic clamps. Basal rates of insulin secretion declined 20 +/- 5 pmol/min.m2 (96 +/- 15 to 76 +/- 15 pmol/min.m2, P less than 0.05) concomitant with decreases of 6.9 +/- 0.9 mmol/L in fasting serum glucose (13.7 +/- 1.0 to 6.8 +/- 0.7 mmol/L, P less than 0.05), 60 +/- 14 pmol/L in serum insulin (134 +/- 30 to 74 +/- 15 pmol/L, P less than 0.05), and 0.15 +/- 0.03 pmol/ml in plasma C-peptide (0.67 +/- 0.11 to 0.52 +/- 0.08 pmol/ml, P less than 0.05) concentrations. As expected, weight loss resulted in improved glucose tolerance as measured by the glycemic profiles during the oral glucose tolerance test (P less than 0.05 analysis of variance). The insulin secretory response before weight loss showed a markedly reduced ability to respond appropriately to an increase in the ambient serum glucose. After weight loss, the pancreatic response was more dynamic (P less than 0.05, analysis of variance) and parralleled the moment-to-moment changes in glycemia. Insulin production above basal doubled (11.2 +/- 3.2 to 24.5 +/- 5.8 nmol/6h.m2, P less than 0.05) and peak rates of insulin secretion above basal tripled (55 +/- 16 to 157 +/- 32 pmol/min/m2, P less than 0.05). To assess the beta-cell response to glucose per se and the changes associated with weight reduction, two hyperglycemic clamps were performed at steady state glucose levels in the range characteristic of individuals with severe NIDDM. At a fixed glycemia of 20 mmol/L, average rates of insulin secretion increased almost 2-fold with treatment (161 +/- 41 to 277 +/- 60 pmol/min.m2, P less than 0.05). At an increment of 6 mmol/L glucose above prevailing fasting glucose levels, the average rate of insulin secretion increased 53% (120 +/- 21 to 183 +/- 39 pmol/min.m2, P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The episodic and pulsatile nature of GH secretion in normal man is well established. Studies in hypophysectomized rats have indicated that pulsatile administration of GH is superior to continuous infusion in promoting growth, but similar studies have not yet been conducted in human subjects. We compared three different iv GH administration schedules in six GH-deficient patients. They were hospitalized three times for 44 h on three occasions, separated by at least 4 weeks without GH treatment. On each occasion they received 2 IU GH, administered iv as either 1) two boluses (at 2000 and 0200 h), 2) eight boluses (at 3-h intervals starting at 2000 h), or 3) a continuous (2000-0200 h) infusion. Serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) after eight boluses and that after continuous infusion were almost identical, with a steep increase reaching a peak at 2000-2400 h, followed by a steady decline. The total areas under the curve, expressed as mean levels (micrograms per L), were 147.6 +/- 11.8 (eight boluses) and 151.2 +/- 8.9 (infusion; P = NS). The change with time in IGF-I after the two-bolus regimen differed significantly from that in the other studies (P less than 0.001), displaying only a modest increase, as also reflected in a smaller area under the curve of serum IGF-I (125.3 +/- 8.7 micrograms/L; P less than 0.05). No differences in blood glucose, serum insulin, or plasma glucagon were observed when comparing the three studies. Both blood glucose and serum insulin tended to be elevated during the second night of each study. Almost identical fluctuations were recorded in lipid intermediates in the three studies, with nightly elevations being more pronounced on the first night. Alanine and lactate exhibited nearly identical patterns in the three studies and were characterized by low nocturnal levels. These data indicate that small but frequent iv boluses and continuous infusion of GH are equally effective in generating an increase in IGF-I in GH-deficient patients, whereas the same amount of GH given as two large boluses results in a significantly smaller increase in IGF-I. This could mean that a prolongation of the period during which serum GH is above zero in GH-treated subjects is just as essential as pulsatility for the growth-promoting effects of the hormone.\r"

We performed an abbreviated 90-min MMM test in 50 children who were siblings of patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and 7 healthy adult volunteers and compared the results to the standard 180-min MMM test in 11 of these subjects. The cohort consisted of 29 prepubertal children [16 males and 13 females; 8.7 +/- 2.0 (mean +/- SEM) yr old]; 16 pubertal children defined as less than 17 yr of age and Tanner stage 2-5 (8 males and 8 females; 13.4 +/- 1.8 yr old), and 12 postpubertal subjects (7 males and 5 females; 18.2 +/- 0.9 yr old), with no significant difference in the weight for length index (WLI) among the 3 groups and with sera of all subjects negative for islet cell antibodies and insulin autoantibodies. The test procedure consisted of 3 baseline blood samples over 30 min, followed at zero time by 0.3 g/kg 25% dextrose infused iv over 1 min and an iv injection of tolbutamide (5 mg/kg) 20 min later; sequential blood samples for glucose and insulin measurements were withdrawn from zero time until completion 90 or 180 min later. In the 11 subjects who underwent both the standard and the abbreviated tests, there was no significant difference between the SI estimated by the 2 methods provided that glucose and insulin values were interpolated at 180 min during the computer calculations of the abbreviated test. Using the 90-min abbreviated test, the SI of the pubertal subjects (2.92 +/- 0.45) was markedly less than that of the prepubertal subjects (6.57 +/- 0.45; P = 0.0001). While the postpubertal group value of 4.63 +/- 0.86 was significantly higher than that of the pubertal group (P = 0.0001), the pre- and postpubertal groups remained significantly different (P = 0.0001). The 10 obese subjects with WLI greater than 120% had a lower SI (3.5 +/- 0.53) than the 47 nonobese subjects with WLI less than 120% (SI = 5.48 +/- 0.42; P less than 0.04), and there was a negative correlation between SI and WLI.

However, the exact mechanism of the mode of action of insulin, between receptor binding and stimulation of glucose transport, is not understood in detail. We have shown earlier, that GH plays an important role in the control of the insulin-sensitive glucose carrier system in rat fat cells. In this study, we measured glucose transport in fat cells of normal probands, GH-deficient (GHD) and GH-treated GHD patients. From sc fat tissue biopsies of three GHD patients, fat cells were isolated after digestion with collagenase. In normal fat cells, basal glucose transport was slow (t/2 = 2.5 min) and stimulated by insulin (t/2 = 0.8 min), as expected. In fat cells of GHD patients glucose transport was maximal already in the basal state (t/2 = 0.8 min) without an additional effect of insulin. After GH administration during several months to GHD patients, glucose transport was again slow in the basal state (t/2 = 3.2 min) and could be stimulated by insulin (t/2 = 0.7 min). These results confirm our earlier findings in rat adipocytes for human adipocytes: GH in vivo is responsible for a glucose transport-limiting factor in the plasma membrane that restricts basal glucose transport and is acutely inhibited by insulin resulting in enhanced glucose transport. These results demonstrate the physiological importance of GH for a normal function of the insulin transmembrane signaling system in fat tissue and indicate a possible benefit of GH administration in adult GHD patients.\r"

Half-maximal stimulation occurred at a relaxin concentration of 5 ng/ml, and maximal stimulation (250-270%) occurred at concentrations greater than or equal to 10 ng/ml. At each time, greater than 95% of the renin released into the medium was in the form of prorenin. The stimulation of renin release was paralleled by a stimulation of cellular renin content and was completely inhibited by cycloheximide, indicating that relaxin also stimulated renin synthesis. Since renin is present in both cytotrophoblast and decidual cells, these results suggest a paracrine and/or autocrine relationship between relaxin- and prorenin-secreting cells.\r"

  ".U": "90270397\r", 
  ".W": "Insulin-induced hypoglycemia (IIH) is a strong stimulator of pituitary ACTH secretion. The mechanisms by which IIH activates the corticotrophs are still controversial. Indeed, in rats the variations of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) secretion in hypophysial portal blood (HPB) during IIH have been diversely appreciated. This may be due to the stressful conditions required for portal blood collection in rats. We studied the effects of IIH on the secretion of CRF and AVP in HPB and on the release of ACTH and cortisol in peripheral plasma in conscious, unrestrained, castrated rams. After the injection of a low (0.2 IU/kg) or high dose (2 IU/kg) of insulin, ACTH and cortisol levels in peripheral plasma increased in a dose-related manner. After injection of the low dose of insulin, CRF and AVP secretion in HPB were equally stimulated. After injection of the high dose of insulin, CRF secretion was further stimulated, while AVP release was dramatically increased. These results suggest that when the hypoglycemia is moderate, CRF is the main factor triggering ACTH release, and that the increased AVP secretion potentiates the stimulatory effect of CRF. When hypoglycemia is deeper, AVP secretion becomes predominant and may by itself stimulate ACTH release.\r"

Nanomolar concentrations of purified ECH (250-2,000 ng/ml) caused rapid and irreversible depletion of cellular ATP to levels below 20% of controls within 60 min. Subcytocidal doses (10-200 ng/ml) of ECH induced rapid release within 60-120 min of large amounts of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) from cultured monocytes. IL-1 beta release occurred in the presence of actinomycin D and cycloheximide, and was thus probably due to processing and export of intracellular IL-1 beta precursor. Incubation of toxin-producing E. coli at ratios of only 0.3-3 colony-forming units per monocyte evoked approximately 50% depletion of total cellular ATP within 90 min. Toxin producers also stimulated synthesis and release of large amounts of interleukin 1, but not of tumor necrosis factor within the same time span. In contrast, non-toxin producers caused neither cell death nor rapid interleukin 1 release. Stimulation of rapid interleukin 1 release coupled with potent cytocidal effects on cells of monocytic origin may represent pathogenetically significant events incurred by bacterial strains that produce ECH and related cytolysins.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the relationship between plasma insulin concentration and intracellular glucose metabolism in control and diabetic rats, we measured endogenous glucose production, glucose uptake, whole body glycolysis, muscle and liver glycogen synthesis, and rectus muscle glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) concentration basally and during the infusion of 2, 3, 4, 12, and 18 mU/kg.min of insulin. The contribution of glycolysis decreased and that of muscle glycogen synthesis increased as the insulin levels rose. Insulin-mediated glucose disposal was decreased by 20-30% throughout the insulin dose-response curve in diabetics compared with controls. While at low insulin infusions (2 and 3 mU/kg.min) reductions in both the glycolytic and glycogenic fluxes contributed to the defective tissue glucose uptake in diabetic rats, at the three higher insulin doses the impairment in muscle glycogen repletion accounted for all of the difference between diabetic and control rats. The muscle G-6-P concentration was decreased (208 +/- 11 vs. 267 +/- 18 nmol/g wet wt; P less than 0.01) compared with saline at the lower insulin infusion, but was gradually increased twofold (530 +/- 16; P less than 0.01 vs. basal) as the insulin concentration rose. The G-6-P concentration in diabetic rats was similar to control despite the reduction in glucose uptake. These data suggest that (a) glucose transport is the major determinant of glucose disposal at low insulin concentration, while the rate-limiting step shifts to an intracellular site at high physiological insulin concentration; and (b) prolonged moderate hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia determine two distinct cellular defects in skeletal muscle at the levels of glucose transport/phosphorylation and glycogen synthesis.\r"

Blood. 73:1188-1194). Since cell differentiation involves transcription of specific regions of the genome, and since nuclear endonucleases responsible for single strand DNA breaks observed in cells undergoing differentiation are Ca2+ dependent, we investigated whether the erythropoietin-induced calcium signal is transmitted from cytosol to nucleus in this study. To elucidate subcellular Ca2+ gradients, the technique of optical sectioning microscopy was used. After determining the empirical three-dimensional point spread function of the video imaging system, contaminating light signals from optical planes above and below the focal plane of interest were removed by deconvolution using the nearest neighboring approach. Processed images did not reveal any discernible subcellular Ca2+ gradients in unstimulated erythroblasts. By contrast, with erythropoietin stimulation, there was a two- to threefold higher Ca2+ concentration in the nucleus compared to the surrounding cytoplasm. We suggest that the rise in nuclear Ca2+ may activate Ca2(+)-dependent endonucleases and initiate differentiation. The approach described here offers the opportunity to follow subcellular Ca2+ changes in response to a wide range of stimuli, allowing new insights into the role of regional Ca2+ changes in regulation of cell function.\r"

  ".W": "The cellular distribution and temporal expression of transcripts from transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) and procollagen alpha 1(I), alpha 1(III), and alpha 1(IV) genes were studied in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced rat liver fibrosis by using in situ hybridization technique. During the fibrotic process, TGF-beta 1 and procollagen genes were similarly and predominantly expressed in Desmin-positive perisinusoidal cells (e.g., fat-storing cells and myofibroblasts) and fibroblasts and their expression continued to be higher than those observed in control rats. These transcripts were also observed in inflammatory cells mainly granulocytes and macrophage-like cells at the early stages of liver fibrosis. The production of extracellular matrix along small blood vessels and fibrous septa coincided with the expression of these genes. Expression of TGF-beta 1 and procollagen genes were not detected in hepatocytes throughout the experiment. No significant differences in cellular distribution or time course of gene expression among procollagen alpha 1(I), alpha 1(III), and alpha 1(IV) were observed. Desmin-positive perisinusoidal cells and fibroblasts appeared to play the principal role in synthesis of collagens in CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis. The simultaneous expression of TGF-beta 1 and procollagen genes in mesenchymal cells, including Desmin-positive perisinusoidal cells, during hepatic fibrosis suggests the possibility that TGF-beta 1 may have an important role in the production of fibrosis.\r"

  ".U": "90270415\r", 
  ".W": "Obesity is characterized by decreased rates of skeletal muscle insulin-mediated glucose uptake (IMGU). Since IMGU equals the product of the arteriovenous glucose difference (AVGd) across muscle and blood flow into muscle, reduced blood flow and/or tissue activity (AVGd) can lead to decreased IMGU. To examine this issue, we studied six lean (weight 68 +/- 3 kg, mean +/- SEM) and six obese (94 +/- 3 kg) men. The insulin dose-response curves for whole body and leg IMGU were constructed using the euglycemic clamp and leg balance techniques over a large range of serum insulin concentrations. In lean and obese subjects, whole body IMGU, AVGd, blood flow, and leg IMGU increased in a dose dependent fashion and maximal rates of all parameters were reduced in obese subjects compared to lean subjects. The dose-response curves for whole body IMGU, leg IMGU, and AVGd were right-shifted in obese subjects with an ED50 two- to threefold higher than that of lean subjects for each parameter. Leg blood flow increased approximately twofold from basal 2.7 +/- 0.2 to 4.4 +/- 0.2 dl/min in lean, P less than 0.01, and from 2.5 +/- 0.3 to 4.4 +/- 0.4 dl/min in obese subjects, P less than 0.01. The ED50 for insulin's effect to increase leg blood flow was about fourfold higher for obese (957 pmol/liter) than lean subjects (266 pmol/liter), P less than 0.01. Therefore, decreased insulin sensitivity in human obesity is not only due to lower glucose extraction in insulin-sensitive tissues but also to lower blood flow to these tissues. Thus, in vivo insulin resistance can be due to a defect in insulin action at the tissue level and/or a defect in insulin's hemodynamic action to increase blood flow to insulin sensitive tissues.\r"

In this study we have used new gel electrophoresis techniques to follow the location of amplified c-myc oncogene sequences in HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. In passages 46-62 of the cells, the cells contain amplified c-myc sequences on submicroscopic circular extrachromosomal DNA (episomes). With increased passages in culture (passages 63-72) the cells lose the episome c-myc sequences with a shift of those sequences to double minutes. With additional passage in culture, the c-myc shifts from the double minutes to a chromosomal site der(5)t(5;17)(q11.2;q?11.2). Concomitant with the shift of the c-myc sequences into the chromosomal compartment is a phenotypic change of a shortened cell-doubling time. These studies provide the first molecular evidence of a progression from a submicroscopic location for amplified oncogene sequences to a chromosomal location for the amplified sequences. This molecularly documented model can now be used to test various strategies to prevent incorporation of extrachromosomally located oncogene sequences into chromosomal sites. Prevention of integration of the oncogene sequences into chromosomal sites could modulate progression of patients' tumors.\r"

  ".W": "Escherichia coli ingested by PMN are promptly growth arrested but undergo limited destruction. We have studied bacterial phospholipid hydrolysis as a possible limiting factor in the disassembly of ingested E. coli, comparing the fates, during phagocytosis by rabbit peritoneal exudate PMN, of three isogenic strains, differing in their content of the pldA gene encoding the principal E. coli phospholipase A (PLA), i.e., pldA-, pldA+, pldA (the latter strain bearing the pldA gene in a multicopy plasmid resulting in a 20-fold increase in PLA content). Ingestion and growth inhibition (greater than 99% within 15 min) were the same for the three strains, but phospholipid degradation differed according to bacterial PLA content: pldA up to 60%, pldA+ up to 30%, and pldA- up to 20%. Since the pldA- strain has no activatable PLA, phospholipid degradation in this strain demonstrates the action of a PMN PLA. Added PLA2-rich ascitic fluid (AF) or purified AF PLA2 increased the rate and extent of degradation of the pldA- strain, provided the enzyme was added before ingestion was complete. 125I-AF-PLA2 binds to both E. coli and PMN and thus can enter the vacuole during phagocytosis. Although up to 50-fold more AF-PLA2 than the PLA2 content of the PMN could be loaded into the PMN in this way, degradation of pldA- E. coli did not exceed 30%. Increased phospholipid degradation had no effect on the degradation of bacterial macromolecules. In contrast, bacterial disassembly manifest as structural disorganization, release of bacterial protein derived material, and inhibition of protein synthesis were markedly enhanced when greater than 50% of prelabelled bacterial phospholipids were degraded. These findings reveal a link between envelope phospholipid degradation and overall bacterial destruction, suggesting therefore that factors limiting PLA action limit the destruction of E. coli ingested by PMN.\r"

  ".U": "90270428\r", 
  ".W": "Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is characterized by a progressive autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta-cells. One of the best-suited animal models for IDDM is the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse. In this investigation pancreatic islets were isolated from female NOD mice aged 5-7, 8-11, and 12-13 wk and examined immediately (day 0) or after 7 d of culture (day 7). The mice showed a progressive disturbance in glucose tolerance with age, and a correspondingly increased frequency of pancreatic insulitis. Islets isolated from the oldest mice often contained inflammatory cells on day 0, which resulted in an elevated islet DNA content. During culture these islets became depleted of infiltrating cells and the DNA content of the islets decreased on day 7. Islets of the eldest mice failed to respond with insulin secretion to high glucose, whereas a response was observed in the other groups. After culture all groups of islets showed a markedly improved insulin secretion. Islets from the 12-13-wk-old mice displayed a lower glucose oxidation rate at 16.7 mM glucose on day 0 compared with day 7. Islet (pro)insulin and total protein biosynthesis was essentially unaffected. In conclusion, islets obtained from 12-13-wk-old NOD mice exhibit an impaired glucose metabolism, which may explain the suppressed insulin secretion observed immediately after isolation. This inhibition of beta-cell function can be reversed in vitro. Thus, there may be a stage during development of IDDM when beta-cell destruction can be counteracted and beta-cell function restored, provided the immune aggression is arrested.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the tubular action of endothelin in rat nephron segments. The effects of endothelin on arginine vasopressin (AVP)-, parathyroid hormone-, glucagon-, calcitonin-, and isoproterenol-dependent cAMP accumulation were studied. The following nephron segments were microdissected: glomerulus (Gl), proximal convoluted tubule (PCT), cortical and medullary thick ascending limbs of Henle's loop (cTAL and mTAL, respectively), cortical collecting duct (CCD), outer medullary collecting duct (OMCD), and inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD). Endothelin dose dependently (10(-8)-10(-10)M) inhibited AVP-dependent cAMP accumulation in CCD, OMCD, and IMCD. This effect was independent of the presence or absence of phosphodiesterase inhibitor, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, Ca channel blocker nicardipine, or indomethacin, but was abolished in the presence of protein kinase C inhibitor H-7. Protein kinase C stimulator dioctanoyl glycerol mimicked the effect of endothelin. On the other hand, endothelin had no inhibitory effect on AVP-dependent cAMP accumulation in cTAL or mTAL, parathyroid hormone-dependent cAMP accumulation in Gl and PCT, or glucagon-, calcitonin-, and isoprotereol-dependent cAMP accumulation in OMCD. We conclude that endothelin specifically inhibits AVP-dependent cAMP accumulation in CCD, OMCD, and IMCD through activating protein kinase C. This effect possibly has a role in maintaining urine volume to counteract the decrease in GFR caused by endothelin itself.\r"

The key finding is brittle hair with low sulfur content, but alternating dark and light bands under polarizing microscopy, trichoschisis, and absent or defective cuticle are additional important clues for the diagnosis of trichothiodystrophy. Our review of the literature revealed extensive associated findings in trichothiodystrophy. Classification of patients with trichothiodystrophy and other dysplasias is difficult because diminution of sulfur-rich protein in hair is not a sufficient marker to allow precise differentiation, although several similar ectodermal dysplasias can be excluded by demonstration of abnormal sulfur content in hair of patients with trichothiodystrophy. Patients with trichothiodystrophy should have a thorough evaluation for other associated manifestations, including investigation of photosensitivity and DNA repair defects. Detection of low-sulfur brittle hair syndrome is also important for genetic counseling because the disease appears to be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.\r"

IgE antibodies against P. ovale were found in two thirds of the patients with atopic dermatitis and were more frequent in patients with lesions predominantly in the seborrheic areas. In addition, some atopic patients had positive reactions to epicutaneous tests, which suggest that delayed allergic reactions to P. ovale may also be important.

In vitro, R 68 151 is a potent 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor and consequently reduces LTB4 formation. Therefore the role of an in vitro 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor and its clinical use in psoriasis were evaluated with topical R 68 151 in a double-blind vehicle-controlled study. Eighty-eight patients with localized psoriatic lesions were treated twice daily with R 68 151 2% ointment (n = 44) or vehicle ointment (n = 44) during 4 weeks. Most patients (n = 73) had psoriasis vulgaris (n = 37, R 68 151; n = 36, vehicle). In 27% of the R 68 151-treated patients with psoriasis vulgaris, the lesions disappeared or showed marked improvement, compared with 8% in the vehicle group (X2, p = 0.06). The scores in global evaluation, however, were significantly different between both treatment groups (p less than 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test). The improvement of the mean symptom score with R 68 151 was 46% for scaling and 34% for erythema at the end of the study compared with an improvement of 6% and a deterioration of 3%, respectively, in the control group (p less than 0.05, p less than 0.01; Mann-Whitney U test). The global evaluation in the total group of patients with psoriasis (all different subtypes) was consistent with the response rate in the group of patients with psoriasis vulgaris: 30% in the test group versus 11% in the control group (X2, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The sites of involvement were not different between nickel-sensitive subjects and the overall population tested, except in the case of foot involvement, which was underrepresented in the nickel-sensitive group. Patients who had positive responses to nickel reacted more frequently to marginal irritants such as formaldehyde and benzoyl peroxide. This finding may suggest a reduction in the irritancy threshold in nickel-sensitive subjects. In most instances, domestic rather than occupational exposure was thought to account for the induction of nickel allergy.\r"

Although there are few references in the medical literature, blister beetle dermatosis caused by oedemerids may be more common and widespread than currently recognized. The best known family is the Meloidae with numerous species worldwide causing blistering. The vesicant chemical in both Oedemeridae and Meloidae is cantharidin. The third group of blister beetles includes species of the genus Paederus (Family: Staphylinidae). The clinicopathologic picture differs because this genus contains a different vesicant agent, pederin. The clinicopathologic features of oedemerid blister beetle dermatosis are described.

The synthesis of semisynthetic penicillins provided agents that overcame the resistance of staphylococci, but as gram-negative bacteria became increasingly important as the cause of infections, plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases were recognized in the Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus, and chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases in Klebsiella, and Bacteroides were found to be the mechanism of resistance of these species to ampicillin and related penicillins. Two approaches to the problem have been developed. One is to make stable compounds. This has been possible in the cephalosporin family. The other method has been to find inhibitors of beta-lactamases. Clavulanate is a beta-lactamase inhibitor that, in combination with amoxicillin, allows the combination to inhibit many of the organisms that are resistant to amoxicillin. Similarly, clavulanate has been combined with ticarcillin to provide a parenteral agent to inhibit beta-lactamase-producing bacteria and retain activity against Pseudomonas. Sulbactam has been combined with ampicillin. The combination of suicide inhibitors with other beta-lactams has provided agents that inhibit many of the bacteria present in mixed cutaneous infections. Clinical studies have established the efficacy of the clavulanate-amoxicillin and clavulanate-ticarcillin combinations in skin and skin-structure infections. These agents offer an alternative to other drugs when treating cutaneous infections.\r"

  ".W": "Formalin-fixed tissues and formalin solutions are among the most frequently found materials in pathology and forensic science laboratories. However, these materials are seldom used for the identification of poisons for forensic toxicology purposes. In this study, the possibility that paraquat may be released from formalin-fixed tissues during the fixation process was investigated. However, because of the interference of formaldehyde on the reduction of paraquat with dithionite reagent, paraquat in formalin solutions was treated with ion-pair column chromatography and then determined by measuring the derivative spectrum of reduced paraquat. The results show that the interference of formalin on paraquat determination has been eliminated by the proposed method. Furthermore, a study on the formalin solutions of fixed organs in cases with suspected paraquat intoxication revealed that portions of tissue paraquat had been released into formalin during the fixation process. Moreover, the paraquat levels in formalin increased with increased storage time. Therefore, these data suggest that the combined concentrations of paraquat in the formalin-fixed tissues and formalin solutions might reflect more reliably the total paraquat in the postmortem tissues. This investigation could be of value to the forensic toxicologist, especially in cases in which no fresh tissue samples are available for analysis.\r"

Among the available other omnibus indexes, none offers a satisfactory solution for the paradoxes that occur with p0 and kappa. The problem can be avoided only by using ppos and pneg as two separate indexes of proportionate agreement in the observers' positive and negative decisions. These two indexes, which are analogous to sensitivity and specificity for concordance in a diagnostic marker test, create the paradoxes formed when the chance correction in kappa is calculated as a product of the increment in the two indexes and the increment in marginal totals. If only a single omnibus index is used to compared different performances in observer variability, the paradoxes of kappa are desirable since they appropriately \"penalize\" inequalities in ppos and pneg. For better understanding of results and for planning improvements in the observers' performance, however, the omnibus value of kappa should always be accompanied by separate individual values of ppos and pneg.\r"

In the first phase of the San Luis Valley Diabetes Study, diagnostic criteria for PAD were evaluated in 607 controls and 343 diabetics. Normal ranges, and the lowest 2.5 percentile of the distribution of ankle/arm systolic blood pressure ratios were derived from a non-diabetic subset of the population with a very low probability of PAD. From this subgroup, abnormal ankle/arm ratios were defined as less than: 0.94 at rest, 0.73 after exercise, and 0.78 after reactive hyperemia. Using these criteria, PAD was identified in 130 subjects from the study population of 950 (prevalence of 13.7%). In contrast, a history of intermittent claudication, or an absent pulse in the extremity were uncommon findings in the study population, and thus had a low sensitivity and positive predictive value for PAD diagnosed by vascular laboratory criteria. We conclude that vascular laboratory tests provide a useful, and objective means of determining the prevalence of PAD in a geographically-based population of diabetic and control subjects.\r"

  ".U": "90270899\r", 
  ".W": "The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) conducted a randomized clinical trial to determine whether tamoxifen (TAM) plus chemotherapy is more effective than TAM alone in improving disease-free survival (DFS), distant disease-free survival (DDFS), and survival (S) of positive-node, TAM-responsive patients aged greater than or equal to 50 years. Women were randomized among three treatment groups: (1) TAM alone, (2) Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), cyclophosphamide, and TAM (ACT), or (3) melphalan (L-PAM), fluorouracil (5-FU), and TAM (PFT). The PFT arm was later modified so that new patients also received Adriamycin (PAFT). Findings from 1,124 eligible patients through 3 years of follow-up indicated a significantly better DFS for ACT-treated patients than for those receiving TAM alone (84% v 67%; P = .0004). An advantage in DDFS and S was also observed after ACT therapy (83% v 73% [P = .04 in the former] and 93% v 85% [P = .04 in the latter]). Both the DFS and DDFS of PAFT-treated patients were better than in those treated by TAM alone (83% v 66%, P = .0002 and 85% v 73%, P = .003). PFT patients also fared better in DFS and DDFS than TAM patients (81% v 72%, P = .07 and 85% v 74%, P = .02). Odds ratios consistently favored the three TAM-plus-chemotherapy groups. No significant S advantage is as yet evident in favor of the PAFT or PFT groups. Of importance is the failure of these studies to demonstrate an unfavorable interaction between the drug regimens used and the TAM, which was administered simultaneously. The findings related to the use of PAFT and PFT are of more biologic than clinical significance since L-PAM is rarely used in the treatment of breast cancer. The major conclusion from this study is the observance of a better outcome in positive-node breast cancer patients aged greater than or equal to 50 years from the use of postoperative prolonged TAM and short-course AC therapy (completed in 63 days) than from prolonged TAM therapy alone.\r"

Tamoxifen has antiestrogenic properties and may thus theoretically decrease bone mineral density, particularly after long-term treatment. Bone mineral density (BMD) was assessed in 75 recurrence-free postmenopausal breast cancer patients included in a randomized trial of adjuvant tamoxifen (40 mg daily) for 2 or 5 years versus no adjuvant endocrine therapy. The measurements were done about 7 years after the initial randomization. BMD was measured with single-photon absorptiometry (SPA) at two levels of the distal forearm representing cortical and trabecular bone. The BMD was found to be similar among tamoxifen patients compared with the controls. For cortical bone, the BMD was 1.03 g/cm2 (95% confidence interval [Cl], 0.97 to 1.09) among tamoxifen patients and 1.03 g/cm2 (95% Cl, 0.96 to 1.11) in controls. For trabecular bone, the values were 0.74 g/cm2 (95% Cl, 0.70 to 0.79) and 0.73 g/cm2 (95% Cl, 0.68 to 0.79), respectively. The results thus did not indicate an accelerated postmenopausal bone loss with long-term adjuvant tamoxifen.\r"

A value of greater than or equal to 10 fmol/mg cytosol protein was defined as positive. There was agreement between the BA and EIA on whether the sample was positive or negative in 75 of 91 (82%) samples measured for ERs and in 74 of 93 (80%) for PRs. When the threshold value for a positive assay was redefined as greater than or equal to 20 fmol/mg protein, there was agreement in 85 of 91 (93%) samples for ERs and 85 of 93 (91%) for PRs. The numerical value for ERs by EIA was not consistently greater or less than ERs by BA, but the difference between the EIA and BA measurement increased as the size of the measurement increased. We did not see an excess of premenopausal patients whose ERs by BA were negative and whose ERs by EIA were positive. Although we performed a linear regression analysis and determined the Pearson correlation coefficient to compare the BA and EIA as reported by others, we show that this analysis may be misleading when the objective is to demonstrate similarities between these methods. Our study shows that the EIA can be confidently used in place of the BA. However, a threshold value for a positive EIA should be confirmed clinically in future studies.\r"

  ".U": "90270902\r", 
  ".W": "A phase II study was initiated in March 1987 at the Regina Elena National Cancer Institute of Rome to evaluate the efficacy of alternating intraperitoneal (IP) recombinant alpha-2-interferon (r-alpha 2-IFN) and cisplatin (DDP) as salvage therapy for less than or equal to 5 mm residual-disease (RD) ovarian carcinoma. Fourteen assessable patients entered the study. All had received prior chemotherapy (11 with DDP-based regimens); five patients had macroscopic RD (less than or equal to 5 mm), and nine had microscopic RD (histologically positive random biopsies and/or positive cytology and immunocytochemical tests). The response to IP immunochemotherapy was evaluated by laparotomy. Pathologic complete remissions (PCRs) were achieved in seven patients (50%) who have remained free of disease with a median follow-up of 22+ months (range, 11+ to 30+ months). Six patients achieved a stable disease and one presented disease progression. With the exception of chemical peritonitis-induced adhesions, no limiting toxicity was observed. The results obtained in this small, highly selected series demonstrate that a high PCR rate may be obtained with IP immunochemotherapy with DDP and r-alpha 2-IFN as salvage therapy in residual ovarian carcinoma less than or equal to 5 mm after first-line chemotherapy also including intravenous (IV) DDP. Larger comparative studies must be conducted to establish the potential role of IP DDP and r-alpha 2-IFN as compared with either of the single treatments.\r"

Patients were stratified by histologic disease type and degree of tumor dissemination. Equal distribution of the clinical characteristics was achieved. One hundred ten patients with metastatic disease of the urinary tract (86 bladder, 16 renal pelvis, seven ureter, one prostatic urethra) met eligibility criteria and were enrolled on study. These represented 82% of the total patients seen during the study period in the Section of Genitourinary Oncology who met the eligibility criteria. The combined complete and partial response rate was significantly higher for patients treated with MVAC than for those treated with CISCA (65% v 46%; P less than .05). The survival duration of MVAC-treated patients was significantly longer than that of CISCA-treated patients (mean, 62.6 weeks; median, 48.3; range, 5.0+ to 162.3+ v mean, 40.4 weeks; median, 36.1; range, 7+ to 147.1+). We conclude that MVAC chemotherapy is superior to CISCA chemotherapy, achieving a higher response rate and a longer survival for equivalent patients with metastatic urothelial tumors.\r"

  ".W": "Seventy-five breast cancer patients scheduled to receive a first course (in a new cycle) of cyclophosphamide, fluorouracil, and doxorubicin (FAC) or epirubicin (FEC) participated in a double-blind crossover study to compare the antiemetic efficacy and safety of ondansetron (GR38032), a 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist, and metoclopramide. Ondansetron was given as an 8 mg loading dose (4 mg intravenously [IV] plus 4 mg orally) before chemotherapy followed by 8 mg every 8 hours orally for 3 to 5 days. Metoclopramide was given as an 80 mg loading dose (60 mg IV plus 20 mg orally) before chemotherapy followed by 20 mg every 8 hours orally for 3 to 5 days. A \"period\" interaction in the analysis of emetic response in the first 24 hours necessitated a parallel group analysis of first treatments only, 68 patients being assessable for this parameter. In the first 24 hours, complete or major control (zero to two emetic episodes) of emesis was achieved in 30 of 35 (86%) patients receiving ondansetron and in 14 of 33 (42%) patients receiving metoclopramide (P less than .001). Ondansetron was also more effective in reducing acute nausea. On days 2 to 3, the complete or major responses were significantly better with ondansetron (81% v 65%; P = .033), but there was no statistical difference in the control of nausea. There was a significant patient preference for ondansetron (63% v 26%; P = .001). Extrapyramidal reactions were observed in two metoclopramide treatments; both treatments were otherwise well tolerated. These results are consistent with serotonin (5-HT), being a significant neurotransmitter of cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin- or epirubicin/fluorouracil-induced emesis.\r"

This antibody effects antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) with human mononuclear cells and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) with human complement. Because of these activities, we conducted a phase I trial of MAb L6 in patients with advanced cancer. Nineteen patients whose tumors highly expressed antigen were selected for this trial. Eighteen were evaluable. MAb L6 was administered at dose levels ranging from 5 mg/m2/d to 400 mg/m2/d for 7 days and was well tolerated. The only side effects detected were fever and headaches at the highest dose levels. The serum half-life of L6 was directly related to dose and ranged from a mean of 7.7 hours at 5 mg/m2/d to 29.1 hours at 400 mg/m2/d. Peak serum concentrations ranged from 0.22 micrograms/mL to 362 micrograms/mL. Biopsies at the end of treatment showed L6 to localize well to tumor cells with apparent in vivo saturation occurring at dose levels above 100 mg/m2/d. Thirteen patients formed human antimouse antibodies (HAMA), some as early as day 13. One patient with recurrent breast cancer on the chest wall achieved a complete remission. The response was first noted at 5 weeks and a pathologic complete remission occurred at 14 weeks. Because of its favorable binding properties and the encouraging clinical effect observed, future evaluation of this MAb appears warranted.\r"

Responding patients were re-treated at the time of tumor progression if they still met the entry criteria. The median survival of assessable patients from the time of treatment was 207 days and from the diagnosis of the primary was 302 days. Fourteen patients remain alive at 3 months to 3 years following treatment. The vast majority of patients had transient pain, fever, nausea, and elevation in liver enzymes. Ascites developed in 14 patients. There were two treatment-related deaths: one from tumor hemorrhage and one from liver failure. Chemoembolization appears to have significant activity in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and is relatively well tolerated.\r"

  ".W": "This clinical trial was performed to study the effects of intravenously (IV) administered recombinant human (rh) erythropoietin (EPO) at escalating doses (150, 300, and 450 U/kg, administered as an IV bolus injection, twice weekly, for 6, 4, and 4 weeks, respectively) in five patients with low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (Ig NHL) and bone marrow involvement and one patient with multiple myeloma (MM). All patients were anemic due to underlying disease. None of the patients had a history of bleeding, hemolysis, renal insufficiency, or other disorders causing anemia in addition to bone marrow infiltrating malignancy. Endogenous EPO serum levels were significantly increased in all patients (74 to 202 mU/mL). Five patients (one MM, four small-cell lymphocytic [SCLC] NHL) showed a dramatic increase of hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hk) and RBC count becoming obvious on the second EPO dose level. Initial ferritin serum values, which were high mostly due to polytransfusion, were significantly reduced in responding patients. Erythropoiesis of one patient with extensive follicular mixed (fm) NHL did not respond to EPO treatment. Platelet (PLT) count increase (greater than 75% above starting levels) during and following EPO therapy was observed in one patient with MM. Adverse events due to EPO therapy have not been recorded. These findings point out a previously unrecognized capacity of EPO given at pharmacologic doses to stimulate erythropoiesis in patients with anemia due to bone marrow infiltration by neoplastic lymphocytes in spite of enhanced endogenous EPO expression.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred five untreated adult patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) were entered on the vincristine, Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), and Decadron (dexamethasone; Merck Sharp and Dohme, West Point, PA) (VAD) regimen. Induction therapy with VAD and VAD plus cyclophosphamide (CVAD) was followed by a 2-year rotating maintenance program with multiple antileukemic combinations, and included early intensifications with Adriamycin and high-dose cytarabine (ara-C) and a late intensification with cyclophosphamide, carmustine (BCNU), and etoposide (VP-16) (CBV) followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Duration of therapy was 24 to 30 months. Eight-eight patients (84%) achieved complete remission (CR) with VAD-CVAD, and 94 (90%) ultimately had CR with continuation of the maintenance as planned. Induction mortality was 3%; only half of the patients required prolonged hospitalization of 1 week or longer, or intravenous antibiotics. Maintenance therapy was given to 79 patients, while nine with histocompatibility locus antigen (HLA)-matched related donors underwent allogeneic BMT. The median remission duration was 22 months, and the median survival was 19 months. Factors associated with significantly worse CR rates were older age, the presence of hypoalbuminemia or hyperbilirubinemia, L2 or L3 morphology, and myeloid markers on leukemic cells. Those associated with significantly worse remission durations were the presence of elevated leukocyte or absolute peripheral blast counts, Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive or B-cell ALL, L2 morphology, and more than one course to achieve CR. Patients could be divided into standard-risk ALL (28% of patients) and high-risk ALL (72% of patients) with long-term remission rates of 70% versus less than 30%. The 26 patients who underwent CBV autologous BMT had similar long-term outcome compared with 21 patients who did not (older age, medical contraindications, or socioeconomic problems). The presence or absence of myeloid markers on leukemic cells did not affect long-term prognosis. We conclude that VAD therapy is a well-tolerated effective induction regimen. High-risk ALL patients require alternative maintenance investigational approaches.\r"

In the normal cases, the pancreas was visualized in the planar images as early as 3 hr, and again at 20 hr postinjection. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) performed following 3-hr planar scintigraphy, provided excellent pancreas images without an overlap of activity in the liver or spleen. The mean pancreas-to-liver (P/L) ratio was 1.26 +/- 0.22 in normal controls. With the exception of one case of massive calcification in the pancreas, the entire pancreas could be observed in the cases with chronic pancreatitis, but the P/L ratio was 0.74 +/- 0.15, significantly lower than that of normal cases. Defective areas of the distal portion of the pancreas were clearly seen in those with cancer of the pancreas. The results of our study indicate that [123I] HIPDM may have clinical potential as a human pancreas imaging agent.\r"

Analysis of the recent literature, however, does not support the existence of such a syndrome and suggests that neurologic events after immunization are chance temporal associations of neurologic conditions that occur in the target age group, even in the absence of immunization. Population-based studies do not prove a causal relationship with acute encephalopathy. There are no consistent neuropathologic findings suggesting a specific pathophysiologic process, and hypotheses concerning possible mechanisms of damage are not supported by reproducible studies in children. No acceptable animal model exists. There clearly is an increased risk of a convulsion after diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis immunization but no evidence that this produces brain injury or is a forerunner of epilepsy. Studies have also not linked immunization with either sudden infant death syndrome or infantile spasms.\r"

The trial took place at three Boston neonatal intensive care units between June 1981 and April 1984. The 76 babies with BPD had radiographic evidence of the condition and required oxygen therapy for 28 days or more. All 147 control babies survived until day 28 of life without meeting either of these criteria for BPD. Compared with control infants, those with BPD received greater quantities of total, crystalloid, and colloid fluids per kilogram per day in the first 4 days of life. In addition, infants with BPD generally had a net weight gain in the first 4 days of life in contrast to the normal pattern of weight loss seen in control infants. Finally, the infants with BPD were more likely to be given a clinical diagnosis of patent ductus arteriosus and to have received furosemide on days 3 and 4 of life. From these observations we infer that early postnatal phenomena such as excessive fluid therapy may be important in the pathogenesis of BPD.\r"

The mean birth weight was 1002 gm (range 550 to 1500 gm), and mean gestational age was 27 weeks (range 24 to 33 weeks).

Additional values included protein concentration, 142 mg/dl (range 45 to 370 mg/dl); and glucose, 60 mg/dl (range 29 to 217 mg/dl).

  ".W": "We describe the neuropathologic and ultrasonographic findings in 22 very low birth weight infants (mean weight 948 gm) who survived at least 6 days and for whom cranial ultrasonography had been performed three or more times in life. White matter necrosis was found in 15 of the 22 subjects and was judged chronic (5 days' duration or longer) in seven subjects. The most common pattern was diffuse necrosis of hemispheric white matter, found in 10 of 15 infants; restriction of necrosis to the periventricular region was found in only three infants. The classic histologic features of periventricular leukomalacia were absent from 7 of the 15 infants with necrosis. Seventeen infants had intraventricular hemorrhage, but extension of ventricular blood into white matter unaffected by infarction was not found. Two ultrasonographic features were associated with white matter necrosis: increased parenchymal echogenicity and ventricular enlargement. One or both of these findings were present in 67% of infants with white matter necrosis, in 90% of infants with diffuse necrosis, but in no infant without necrosis. Increased parenchymal echogenicity was seen in all four infants with hemorrhagic necrosis, in 60% of infants with diffuse necrosis, but in none of the five infants with localized necrosis. We conclude that the very small infants now dying in nurseries have a form of white matter damage that is more extensive than, and in some cases histologically different from, periventricular leukomalacia as originally described. Ultrasonography as used in this study identified most but not all infants with pathologically verified white matter necrosis.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether systemic administration of antibiotics may eliminate or reduce the need for tympanomastoid surgery in chronic suppurative otitis media without cholesteatoma, we undertook a randomized, prospective study comparing three regimens: (1) daily suction and debridement, with intravenous administration of mezlocillin until 3 days after the discharge stopped, (2) daily suction and debridement, with intravenous use of ceftazidime until 3 days after the discharge stopped, and (3) daily suction and debridement without antibiotics. No topical antimicrobial agents were used during the study. Fifty-one patients were included, and 48 children completed the study. The duration of discharge from the ear before treatment was 2 to 123 months (median 20 months). In 26 patients (51%), the disease was bilateral. Aerobic cultures, obtained with the Alden-Senturia middle ear aspirator, yielded Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 98%, enteric gram-negative bacilli in 33%, staphylococci in 25%, and Haemophilus influenzae in 12%. The first 33 patients were randomly assigned to one of the three regimens. In the 21 patients treated with suction and antibiotics (either mezlocillin or ceftazidime), the discharge stopped completely, versus in only 1 (8%) of 12 patients in the suction-only regimen (p less than 0.01). Therefore the following 18 patients were randomly assigned to one of only two groups, which included the two suction-and-antibiotic regimens. In all patients treated initially with antibiotics, discharge stopped after 4 to 18 days (mean 12.0 days), but 25% needed treatment for greater than 14 days. Amoxicillin prophylaxis was administered to 27 (56%) of the patients after completion of therapy. All patients were followed for 6 months. Drainage recurred in 12 (25%) patients during the first 3 months after the study. The recurrence rate was not affected by the antibiotic regimen, the patient's age, the duration of drainage before initiation of antibiotic therapy, or prophylaxis. We conclude that intravenous wide-spectrum antibiotic therapy in conjunction with daily suction and debridement is efficacious for the treatment of chronic suppurative otitis media without cholesteatoma.\r"

Synovial fluid (SF) has therefore been examined for inhibitors of seeded hydroxyapatite growth rate (Vo) using a pH stat system. Pretreatment of seed crystals with SF reduced growth (Vo = 56 +/- 5, control 117 +/- 141 mol/base/min/g hydroxyapatite, p less than 0.001). Addition of small amounts of serum or SF to the growth medium caused a dose dependent growth inhibition (0.04% SF reduced Vo by 16%). Pretreatment with protease, but not hyaluronidase, abolished this activity and gel filtration localized it to the 55-80 kDa fraction. A macromolecular factor(s) with potent inhibitory activity has therefore been detected.\r"

  ".W": "On standard lateral roentgenograms of the lumbar spine, a decrease in bone density is said to be detectable only after a bone loss of about 40%. To evaluate this view, we compared findings on plain films with bone mineral content of L1 determined by quantitative computed tomography in 80 healthy subjects with a mean age of 60 years. The highest correlations with bone mineral content were found for the criteria \"vertebral density versus soft tissue\" (r = 0.5, p less than 0.0001), the \"amount of trabeculations\" (r = 0.49, p less than 0.0001), and for the \"overall\" estimate of osteopenia in the vertebra (r = 0.55, p less than 0.0001). Surprisingly, these three radiographic criteria proved to be most helpful in subjects with bone mineral content above 110 mg/cm3 (nonosteoporotic range). We conclude that lateral radiographs of the lumbar spine can provide a rough estimate of bone density in nonosteoporotic subjects which may be helpful in determining when further analysis with more precise methods is appropriate.\r"

Hematopoietic growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), alone or in combination with interleukin-1 (IL-1), have been shown to counteract myelosuppression resulting from some, but not all, chemotherapeutic regimens. In an attempt to apply these findings to intensive therapy with proliferation-dependent chemotherapeutic drugs such as fluorouracil (5-FU), we investigated combination biochemotherapy in a murine model. Female CD8F1 [(BALB/c X DBA/8)F1] mice bearing first-passage transplants of spontaneous CD8F1 breast tumors were treated intraperitoneally once a week for 3 successive weeks with a course of 5-FU alone or with a course of 5-FU in combination with recombinant human interleukin-1 beta (rHuIL-1 beta) alone or in combination with CSFs. rHuIL-1 beta alone or in combination with rHuG-CSF or recombinant murine GM-CSF significantly improved tumor growth inhibition (60% vs. 90%) and survival (20% vs. 90%-100%), increased the maximally tolerated dose of 5-FU, accelerated recovery of neutrophil counts in peripheral blood, and reduced duration of significant neutropenia and loss of body weight (29% vs. 10% loss). Clinical trials of IL-1 have been initiated in patients with advanced cancer receiving multiple courses of high-dose 5-FU.\r"

  ".W": "Pathologic diagnosis of pulmonary involvement with lymphoma has traditionally necessitated open-lung biopsy in most cases. Specimens large enough to allow recognition of characteristic cytologic and architectural changes are usually not obtained bronchoscopically. Even when adequate biopsy specimens are available, however, unequivocal differentiation of lymphoma from benign inflammatory proliferative lesions (for example, pseudolymphoma or lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis) is not possible on the basis of light microscopic findings alone. Pathologists have relied on immunohistologic examinations in which antibodies directed against B-cell and T-cell surface antigens are used to help distinguish benign from malignant lymphoid proliferations. Unfortunately, even immunohistologic findings may be nondiagnostic, particularly in T-cell lymphomas and in cases in which lymphoma is surrounded by a benign reactive lymphocytosis. Recent development of molecular biologic techniques (for example, Southern blotting) has provided the ability to detect a monoclonal population of cells based on detection of rearrangements of the genes that encode either B-cell immunoglobulin proteins or T-cell antigen receptor proteins. This technique is capable of detecting a clone of cells even when they constitute as little as 5% of a lymphoid infiltrate. Bronchoalveolar lavage can provide samples of sufficient size to facilitate Southern blotting. We present the first case wherein pulmonary involvement with a B-cell lymphoma was confirmed by both immunohistologic and molecular biologic studies of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.\r"

This latter attempt has come to be known as \"effectiveness research.\" Herein, we briefly review the history of quality assurance and cost-containment efforts in the United States, giving special attention to the current initiative based on effectiveness research. Although the effectiveness research initiative has shortcomings (for example, it will not provide guidance when data are not available), it seems to be superior to the current peer review system because it encourages the development of a knowledge base and deemphasizes punitive measures as a way to ensure quality and control costs. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (Public Law 101-239) establishes a federal agency, the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, within the Public Health Service to focus on effectiveness research.\r"

Because of the potential side effects of these medications, physicians unfamiliar with inflammatory ocular disease may be asked to participate in the care of these patients. The most important criteria on which to base the decisions of when and how to treat patients with uveitis are the site and severity of the inflammation, the degree of visual acuity, and the potential for restoration of vision with treatment. Slit-lamp examination, indirect ophthalmoscopy, and fluorescein angiography are useful for evaluating the loss of vision in patients with endogenous uveitis. The main goal of treatment is to prevent permanent scarring and deterioration of vision as a result of the disease or the drug side effects. Frequent reassessment will help ensure adequate treatment and will minimize adverse drug effects.\r"

Among the many functions of the cerebrospinal fluid, it provides protection against acute changes in venous and arterial blood pressure or impact pressure. Nevertheless, trauma, tumors, infections, neurosurgical procedures, and other factors can cause increased intracranial pressure. Both surgical and nonsurgical therapeutic modalities can be used in the management of increased intracranial pressure attributable to traumatic and nontraumatic causes. In patients with cerebral injury and increased intracranial pressure, monitoring of the intracranial pressure can provide an objective measure of the response to therapy and the pressure dynamics. Intraventricular, intraparenchymal, subarachnoid, and epidural sites can be used for monitoring, and the advantages and disadvantages of the various devices available are discussed. With the proper understanding of the physiologic features of the cerebrospinal fluid, the physician can apply the management principles reviewed herein to minimize damage from intracranial hypertension.\r"

Patient education, counseling, nutritional guidance, and exercise training play prominent roles in the process of rehabilitation. Benefits from cardiac rehabilitation include improved exercise capacity and decreased symptoms of angina pectoris, dyspnea, claudication, and fatigue. Recent pooled data regarding exercise training after myocardial infarction demonstrated a 20 to 25% reduction in mortality and major cardiac events. Exercise training may result in an improvement in systemic oxygen transport, a reduction in the myocardial oxygen requirement for a given amount of external work, and a decrease in the extent of myocardial ischemia during physical activity. The efficacy of modification of risk factors in reducing the progression of coronary artery disease and future morbidity and mortality has been established. Herein we review the history, current practice and results, and future challenges of cardiovascular rehabilitation.\r"

Computer-assisted measurements of arteriograms from all restudied patients (175 placebo, 173 nifedipine) showed no significant differences in the number or severity of lesions on initial arteriograms, or in the progression or regression of existing lesions over 3 years. In contrast, the number of new lesions per patient was significantly lower in the nifedipine group than in the placebo group (0.59 vs 0.82 lesions per patient, a 28% reduction).

  ".W": "We designed a user-friendly computer program that permits physicians to use clinical and demographic descriptors to search a hospital's clinical database for purposes of patient care, teaching, and research. For example, the user can identify all admissions in which diabetic ketoacidosis was diagnosed, the serum bicarbonate level was under 12 mmol/liter, and the length of stay exceeded 7 days. Once particular admissions have been identified, all data stored in the computerized record can be displayed. Authorized persons can also request the patient's complete medical record for further study. Over a 5-year period, 895 doctors, nurses, medical students, and hospital administrators used Clin-Query to search the clinical database of Boston's Beth Israel Hospital 3724 times. They displayed detailed information on 72,489 patients and requested the complete medical record 5477 times. Responses to a computer-based questionnaire indicated that 16% of the searches were performed for patient care, 38% for clinical research, 16% for teaching and education, 12% for hospital administration, and 18% for general exploration. We conclude that physicians and allied personnel will repeatedly examine and analyze aggregate clinical information when they are provided with the appropriate tools.\r"

Such peptides are normally derived from protein antigens internalized and proteolytically degraded by the antigen-presenting cell. Class I MHC molecules also bind immunogenic peptides, but these are derived from proteins synthesized within the target cell. Whereas class I molecules seem to bind peptides in the endoplasmic reticulum, class II molecules are thought to bind peptides late in transport. Intracellular class II molecules associate in the endoplasmic reticulum with a third glycoprotein, the invariant (I) chain, which is proteolytically removed before cell surface expression of the alpha beta class II heterodimer. It has been suggested that the I chain prevents peptides from associating with class II molecules early in transport. Preventing such binding until the class II molecules enter an endosomal compartment could maintain the functional dichotomy between class I and class II MHC molecules. We have examined the ability of I chain-associated HLA-DR5 molecules to bind a well characterized influenza haemagglutinin-derived peptide (HAp). The results show that whereas mature HLA-DR alpha beta dimers effectively bind this peptide, the I chain-associated form does not.\r"

Subunit vaccines consisting of virus envelope glycoproteins, produced by recombinant DNA technology, are effective in preventing viral infections. We have now used this approach in the development of a candidate AIDS vaccine. Chimpanzees were immunized with recombinant forms of the HIV-1 glycoproteins gp120 and gp160 produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and then challenged with HIV-1. The control and the two animals immunized with the gp160 variant became infected within 7 weeks of challenge. The two animals immunized with the gp120 variant have shown no signs of infection after more than 6 months. These studies demonstrate that recombinant gp120, formulated in an adjuvant approved for human use, can elicit protective immunity against a homologous strain of HIV-1.\r"

  ".W": "The envelope glycoprotein (gp120/41) of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) attaches the virus to the cellular CD4 receptor and mediates virus entry into the cytoplasm. In addition to being required for formation of infectious HIV, expression of gp120/41 at the plasma membrane causes the cytopathic fusion of cells carrying the CD4 antigen. The expression of gp120/41 is therefore an ideal target for therapeutic strategies designed to combat AIDS. Here we show that expression of a soluble CD4 molecule, mutated to contain a specific retention signal for the endoplasmic reticulum, blocks secretion of gp120 and surface expression of gp120/41, but does not interfere with transport of wild-type CD4. By blocking transport of the HIV glycoprotein, this retained CD4 molecule prevents the fusion of CD4 cells that is normally caused by the HIV glycoprotein. Expression of the retained CD4 molecule in human T cells might therefore be useful in the intracellular immunization procedure suggested by Baltimore.\r"

  ".U": "90272006\r", 
  ".W": "It is well known that Fc receptors for IgG (FcRII) on macrophages mediate the endocytosis of antibody-antigen complexes and signal the release of inflammatory and cytotoxic agents. FcRII are also expressed at high levels on B cells where they are less involved in endocytosis than in modulating B-cell activation by membrane immunoglobulins. Although crosslinking of membrane immunoglobulins can result in B-cell differentiation and proliferation through stimulation of phospholipase C, mobilization of intracellular Ca2+, and activation of protein kinase C, crosslinking FcR with membrane immunoglobulins confers a dominant inhibitory signal that prevents or aborts activation. This form of regulation may have a role in the induction of tolerance by IgG and in controlling the B-cell repertoire by anti-idiotypes. The different functions of FcR on B cells and macrophages may reflect the fact that these cell types express closely related but distinct FcR isoforms. We have recently found that the main lymphocyte FcR isoform, FcRII-B1, is unable to mediate endocytosis by way of coated pits and coated vesicles owing to an in-frame insertion of 47 amino acids in its cytoplasmic tail. Here we show that this insert, absent from the FcRII-B2 macrophage isoform, also contains serine phosphorylation sites that may have a role in the ability of FcR to regulate B-cell activation through membrane immunoglobulins.\r"

As identification of such antigens may enable measures to be developed to prevent the disease, we have characterized an antigen that is recognized by insulinoma membrane-reactive T-cell clones established from a newly diagnosed type-1 diabetes patient. Subcellular fractionation studies using rat insulinoma indicate that the antigenic determinant recognized by one of these clones is an integral membrane component of the insulin secretory granule. After a 5,000-fold purification, we have defined the antigen as a monomer of relative molecular mass 38,000. As granular membrane proteins are transiently exposed on the cell surface during exocytosis, their accessibility to components of the immune system may be a function of the secretory activity of beta-cells.\r"

As a first step in identifying viral genes and gene products that influence pathogenicity, the SIVSMM-PBj14 genome was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction as 5' and 3' genomic halves of 5.1 and 5.8 kilobases, respectively, and molecularly cloned. DNA sequence analysis revealed a high degree of conservation with other SIVs, except for a 22-base-pair duplication in the enhancer region of the viral long terminal repeat which included a second binding site for the transcription factor NF-kappa B. Of six genomic halves examined, four contributed to the formation of infectious virus that induced acute disease and death in pig-tailed macaques as early as 6 days post-inoculation, with pathology, disease syndromes and kinetics indistinguishable from those induced by the uncloned isolate. To our knowledge this is the first example of acute immunodeficiency disease induced by a molecularly defined lentivirus. Furthermore, the molecularly cloned SIVSMM-PBj14 viruses share with the uncloned virus cytopathicity for mangabey CD4+ cells, a property that may correlate with their observed pathogenicity in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "90272010\r", 
  ".W": "The human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) nuclear protein Tat is a potent activator of viral gene transcription. Activation by Tat requires a cis-acting element, the transactivation response (TAR) site, located immediately downstream of the transcription start site. Several observations suggest that TAR functions as the nascent RNA product of the HIV long-terminal-repeat promoter (for a review, see ref. 6). Indeed, Tat protein and several cellular proteins bind directly to nascent TAR RNA in vitro. The significance of these in vitro interactions remains to be established. Here we report that Tat can activate transcription when bound to nascent RNA through the RNA-binding domain of another HIV-1 protein, Rev. Rev is a sequence-specific RNA-binding protein, which interacts with the viral RNA element RRE (refs 11-15). A Tat-Rev fusion protein efficiently activates transcription from an HIV-1 promoter derivative, in which TAR has been replaced by the RRE. We conclude that activation of transcription by Tat can occur by direct binding to nascent RNA, and that the sole function of TAR may be to provide a Tat-binding site. Our results further suggest that cellular proteins that bind specifically to TAR RNA or TAR DNA may not be essential for Tat-responsiveness.\r"

However, with these rapid advances come necessary changes in the dogma of medical practice, including changes in the routine immunization procedures recommended by various authoritative bodies in the United States. New immunizing agents will be developed and will achieve routine use. Unexpected adverse reactions and complications of our immunization reagents must constantly be sought and described. Previously unrecognized subgroups of hosts at special susceptibility to adverse and untoward vaccine effects will be recognized; the pathogenesis of their special susceptibility needs to be understood and then will have to be appropriately addressed. Individual health care practitioners will need to keep abreast of routine immunization recommendations and the application of these recommendations in an organized and thorough fashion to infants, children, adolescents, and adults. A crucial link in the chain of optimal preventive health care will continue to involve those who prescribe, order, and administer vaccines.\r"

Three of these (PRP-D, HbOC, and PRP-OMP) are currently licensed for use in children at 15-18 months of age. Clinical trials of these vaccines in infants are currently being conducted in the United States. If these show the vaccines to be efficacious, licensure for infants will follow. Although much work remains to be done, it seems likely that the effective prevention of serious Hib infections in infants, as well as in older children, is a goal that may be within our reach in the next several years.\r"

  ".W": "Hepatitis B infection and its sequelae constitute a significant public health problem in the United States. It is estimated that 300,000 acute hepatitis B infections occur each year, with about 25% accompanied by both clinical illness and jaundice. Some infections become chronic and ultimately may cause development of liver cirrhosis or primary hepatocellular carcinoma. The risk of chronicity is especially great with infections that occur in infancy. Highly effective vaccines comprised of purified hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) particles are now available for the prevention of hepatitis B infection. A first-generation vaccine utilized HBsAg derived from the plasma of infected persons; this has now been replaced by two similar vaccines that incorporate HBsAg produced by genetically engineered strains of the common bakers' yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Improved use of vaccine is needed to reduce and ultimately eliminate hepatitis B infection. Vaccination already is recommended for persons recognized to be at increased risk of exposure to virus-containing blood or other body fluids (e.g., infants born to carrier mothers, household or sexual contacts of carriers); however, mass vaccination of adolescents and infants is needed to interdict effectively a majority of all exposures to the hepatitis B virus.\r"

Nevertheless, preventable morbidity and mortality continue to occur. In the United States, the measles problem differs when it occurs among preschool-aged children or school-aged children. The former is a due to insufficient vaccine delivery. For measles in school-aged and college students, the problem is primarily vaccine failure, which should eventually be solved by a two-dose schedule. In developing countries, the major problem is vaccine delivery. Use of Edmonston-Zagreb measles vaccine in developing countries offers the promise of reducing disease rates in young infants; however, in both the United States and in developing countries, increasing immunization levels is essential.\r"

Mumps, on the other hand, causes moderate morbidity and occasional mortality. Both infections cause considerable morbidity and disruption in the lives of young people gathered for group activities. Widespread use of safe and effective live attenuated vaccines has dramatically reduced the incidence of rubella, congenital rubella, and mumps in the United States. Nevertheless, significant numbers of young children, especially in areas of urban and rural immigration and poverty, fail to be immunized in a timely fashion; and some adolescents and young adults remain susceptible either because they escaped immunization in childhood or are primary vaccine failures. These individuals remain the source of individual cases and small outbreaks of rubella and mumps. For total eradication of these infections, we need to intensify vaccine efforts and to maintain surveillance efforts for mumps, rubella, and congenital rubella syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Varicella vaccine seems close to licensure in the United States. It is likely to be recommended for routine use in healthy children, either administered singly or as a combination of MMR. Healthy children who have been immunized develop excellent antibody and cell-mediated responses to VZV in the absence of significant adverse effects, and they are well protected against subsequent infection with VZV. Although it will not be known for certain for many years, it seems most unlikely that immunization will result in an increased incidence of zoster, a secondary type of infection with VZV that is caused by reactivation of latent VZV. Varicella vaccine may also be given to healthy adults who have never had chickenpox with a great degree of success, although its protection is somewhat less effective than in children. Leukemic children who are at high risk for developing severe or fatal varicella also derive a great deal of protection from varicella vaccine, but the vaccine must be administered to them with great caution. Other viral vaccines that may be licensed in the future but that are not as fully developed as varicella vaccine include vaccines against CMV, hepatitis A, HSV, and AIDS. These are in various degrees of study, and, should any of them be licensed, it is uncertain whether they would be live attenuated, recombinant, or subunit vaccines. It is hoped, however, that they will eventually be licensed for future use because if effective, they could significantly decrease morbidity and mortality of infants, children, and adults.\r"

Such systems help evaluate health impact, monitor trends in reported disease and adverse events, and identify areas for more intense investigation. Surveillance data alone have played major roles in immunization strategy changes. Successful surveillance relies on cooperation by health care providers and health departments. While filling out forms and reporting cases may be viewed as a burden by some, such information in the aggregate becomes an important part of the knowledge base used to refocus implementation efforts and potentially to change strategies. Reporting by all physicians is particularly important when reported cases lead to aggressive control actions such as outbreak control. Rapid reporting even when cases are not confirmed can help health departments ensure that needed laboratory specimens are collected and allow control measures to be undertaken before disease containment becomes difficult. In conclusion, any immunization program worth instituting is worth monitoring. Surveillance represents constant vigilance to ensure effective control or elimination of disease.\r"

Scientific progress in the fields of immunology and molecular biology offer promise for the control of an increasing number of communicable diseases through immunization. Legal protections for pharmaceutical laboratories, manufacturers, and providers are appropriate incentives to continued development, supply, and administration of effective, affordable vaccines. At the same time, potential recourse to litigation in the courts in the event of vaccine-related injury provides society with desirable assurances of enforceable industrial and professional standards, as well as financial support for those who sustain serious adverse reactions to licensed vaccines. The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 is an attempt to construct an equitable solution to this dilemma. Interested physicians and lawyers will have a role to play in the search for an appropriate balance between these important but competing values. Progress in science and the law in the field of public health generally, and vaccine development specifically, should be a collaborative enterprise. Familiarity with, and respect for, the basic principles and theories of both fields will be essential to this endeavor.\r"

Induction with low concentrations of isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactoside was necessary to obtain soluble enzyme. The active heterodimer was purified by column chromatography and was shown to have both RNA guanylyltransferase and mRNA (guanine-N7-)-methyltransferase activities. Formation of the m7G(5')pppG cap structure was verified by enzyme digestion and thin-layer chromatography. Each subunit was also expressed individually in E. coli. Without the large subunit, the small one was very unstable in some bacterial strains and could only be detected by pulse labeling with radioactive amino acids. The individually expressed large subunit contained the guanylyltransferase domain, but the activity from E. coli was less than 2% of that obtained with both subunits. Two other products of the D1 open reading frame were formed: a 55-kDa subfragment with the GMP binding site and a 38-kDa C-terminal fragment that started at amino acid 498. Expression of this heterodimeric enzyme in E. coli may facilitate the analysis of its functional domains and provide a useful reagent for the specific 5' labeling of uncapped or capped RNA and for enhancing RNA translatability in eukaryotic systems.\r"

The E. coli rotamase, a product of the gene we suggest be called \"rot,\" has been purified to homogeneity after cloning of the gene by the polymerase chain reaction and its overexpression in E. coli. Based on the chymotrypsin-coupled assay using the tetrapeptide substrate succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide, the purified protein has rotamase activity identical to human cyclophilin with a catalytic efficiency close to the upper diffusional limit (kcat/Km approximately 1.0 x 10(7) M-1 x S-1 at 10 degrees C). Unlike the human cyclophilins, however, the E. coli rotamase is not significantly inhibited by the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A. By spheroplast fractionation of cells harboring the expression vector for the complete rot gene, the rotamase is located in the periplasm, where it could function in refolding of secreted proteins.\r"
