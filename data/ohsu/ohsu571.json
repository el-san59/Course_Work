Appropriate follow-up of screening also includes transmission of information about the diagnosis of a hemoglobinopathy trait or alpha-thalassemia to affected families and their physicians, with ready availability of education and counseling.\r"

Currently, citrate agar electrophoresis is the most available, but high performance liquid chromatography is highly recommended in a reference laboratory. Thin layer isoelectric focusing is an excellent technique that can be easily adapted for large-scale newborn hemoglobinopathy screening. Although the initial instrument cost can be about twice as much as the cost for standard electrophoretic equipment, cost-effectiveness for newborn screening is considerable because repeat analysis for uninterpretable results is not necessary. Resolution of hemoglobins is much better with thin layer isoelectric focusing than for any of the other electrophoretic methods currently available, and thin layer isoelectric focusing is the best method to use to establish a definitive diagnosis using newborn blood samples. Cord blood samples may be contaminated with maternal blood, and evaluation of Hb A2 levels in such samples can serve as the method to detect contamination. Follow-up testing is required regardless of the method of blood collection.\r"

Its ability to do so requires, first, a clear and widespread knowledge and understanding of, and commitment to, the blueprint provided through the objectives for the nation. It also requires initiative and activism on the part of nursing leaders at all levels of practice, education and research to make the changes in nursing necessary for realization of this potential. To accomplish this, nurses and others must enter into a process of assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation and evaluation, in which the framework given in Objectives for the Nation is used as a guiding force and point of orientation. The result of this process should be a practical, achievable national agenda that will allow nursing to effectively and efficiently play its crucial role in meeting the health goals of the nation.\r"

If ample funds exist, a two-way student and/or faculty exchange may be possible, thereby adding to the curricula of both schools. Opportunities for joint research and publishing may also become available. For example, long-term evaluation of the educational program and use of the program graduates in the host country would be of interest; research in the specialty areas of faculty may also be possible. The difficulties inherent in planning and implementing a program in another country are numerous; however, with foresight and ample time for planning, the benefits to both students and faculty in the host and home institutions can outweigh the drawbacks.\r"

Data analyses were based on 491 MS subjects. Principal component analysis and Varimax-rotated factor analysis were used to achieve scale parsimony. The resultant 22-item scale consisting of five factors was subjected to confirmatory factor analysis to determine relationships among factors, observed variables, and residual variance within the factor model. Modification of the initial factor model resulted in the inclusion of one additional relationship between an observed variable and a second factor and six paired relations among the residual variances. The modified factor model had a satisfactory GFI of .910. Signs and symptoms contained within the five-factor solution compared favorably with signs and symptoms assigned to the neurological functional systems which are used clinically in classifying MS disease impairment.\r"

The measured pressures were used to calculate six characteristics of the sucking response: maximum pressure generated, amount of nutrient consumed per suck, number of sucks per episode, the duration or width of each suck, the length of time between sucks, and the length of time between sucking episodes. The maximum pressure of the term infant (100.3 +/- 35) was higher, p less than .05, than the maximum pressure of the preterm infant (84 +/- 33). Term infants also consumed more formula per suck (45.3 +/- 20.3 vs. 37.6 +/- 15.9, p less than .05). In addition, they had more sucks/episode (13.6 +/- 8.7 vs. 7.7 +/- 4.1, p less than .001) and maintained the pressure longer for a wider suck width (0.49 +/- 0.1 vs. 0.45 +/- 0.08, p less than .05). Sucking profiles of the preterm infant are significantly different from the full-term infant. These sucking profiles can be developed as a clinically useful tool for nursing practice.\r"

Staff nurses and clinical experts had more value congruence than did staff nurses and head nurses. A significant inverse correlation was found between value congruence and nurse job satisfaction and quality care. Explanations of the finding center on recent role changes for both staff nurses and head nurses, power differential, and evolving clarity of the staff nurse role. A serendipitious finding was that staff nurses reported fewer factors as important to their job satisfaction and perceived environment conducive to quality patient care than did other members of the nursing department. However, factors important to staff nurses were very important.\r"

Medical organizations recommend that physicians notify an endangered third party if the infected patient refuses to cease high-risk activity and the authorities do not take action. However, many questions remain about practical application of these recommendations. Some federal recommendations place the burden of notifying the third party on the infected patient, then on the public health authority, and finally on the physician. However, these suggestions are not law. Legal precedent has placed responsibility on the physician for warning persons exposed to an infected patient that a risk exists. However, warning someone who is not clearly at risk can also invite a lawsuit. At present, there is no clear public policy to give guidance either. By considering the infectivity of the virus, injury potential of the infection, and the exposed person's relationship with the patient, the physician can better weigh the risk of breaching patient confidentiality versus ignoring the health dangers to the third party. Thorough counseling of the patient about infectivity, careful documentation of all conversations and efforts, and use of good judgment are the best tools that physicians have at present for handling this legal void.\r"

  ".W": "Self-organization of frequencies is studied by using model neurons called VCONs (voltage-controlled oscillator neuron models). These models give direct access to frequency information, in contrast to all-or-none neuron models, and they generate voltage spikes that phase-lock to oscillatory stimulation, similar to phase-locking of action potentials to oscillatory voltage stimulation observed in Hodgkin-Huxley preparations of squid axons. The rotation vector method is described and used to study how networks synchronize, even in the presence of noise or when damaged; the entropy of ratios of phases is used to construct an energy function that characterizes organized behavior. Computer simulations show that rotation numbers (output frequency/input frequency) describe both chaotic and nonchaotic behavior. Learning occurs when synaptic connections strengthen in response to stimulation that is synchronous with cell activity. It is shown that intermittent chaotic firing is suppressed and simple stable responses are enhanced by such learning in VCON networks. This analysis provides a rigorous basis for further investigation of the ideas of Wiener [Wiener, N. (1961) Cybernetics (MIT Press, Cambridge, MA), p. 191] on the origin of slow brain waves due to \"the pulling together of frequencies.\"\r"

The general problem can be studied by superposing the effects of variable midwall radius but constant wall thickness with those of variable wall thickness but constant midwall radius. A Fourier series representation is used to describe the midwall radius and thickness functions. Numerical calculations are performed to determine the deformed geometry and spatial distributions of tissue pressure, stresses, and fiber strains. The calculations proved to be highly accurate when compared to an analytical solution obtained for the special case of no fibers. The results show significant longitudinal differences when compared to results for the cylindrical geometry, with more sensitivity to variation in wall thickness than to variation in midwall radius.\r"

Two echinomycins are found to bind cooperatively to each DNA duplex at the CpG steps, with the two quinoxaline rings of each echinomycin bisintercalating between the C.G and A.T base pairs. At low temperatures, the A.T base pairs on either side of the intercalation site adopt the Hoogsteen conformation, as observed in the crystal structures. However, as the temperature is raised, the Hoogsteen base pairs in the interior of the duplex are destabilized and are observed to be exchanging between the Hoogsteen base pair and either an open or a Watson-Crick base-paired state. The terminal A.T base pairs, which are not as constrained by the helix as the internal base pairs, remain stably Hoogsteen base-paired up to at least 45 degrees C. The implications of these results for the biological role of Hoogsteen base pairs in echinomycin-DNA complexes in vivo are discussed.\r"

In this report we describe the effects of these inhibitors on the process of homologous desensitization induced by the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. Permeabilization of human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells with digitonin was used to permit access of the charged inhibitors to the cytosol; this procedure did not interfere with the pattern of isoproterenol-induced homologous desensitization of beta 2AR-stimulated adenylyl cyclase. Inhibitors of beta AR kinase markedly inhibited homologous desensitization of beta 2ARs in the permeabilized cells. Inhibition of desensitization by heparin, the most potent of the polyanion inhibitors of beta AR kinase, occurred over the same concentration range (5-50 nM) as inhibition of purified beta AR kinase assessed in a reconstituted system. Inhibition of desensitization by heparin was accompanied by a marked reduction of receptor phosphorylation in the permeabilized cells. Whereas inhibitors of beta AR kinase inhibited homologous desensitization, inhibitors of protein kinase C and of cyclic-nucleotide-dependent protein kinases were ineffective. These data establish that phosphorylation of beta ARs by beta AR kinase is an essential step in homologous desensitization of the receptors. They further suggest a potential therapeutic value of inhibitors of beta AR kinase in inhibiting agonist-induced desensitization.\r"

Strains derived from R. meliloti SU47 secreted an acidic exopolysaccharide, EPSb, that replaced succinoglycan in nodule invasion. EPSb, which has not formerly been identified among the Rhizobiaceae, consisted of the repeating unit 4,6-O-(1-carboxyethylidene)-alpha-D-Galp1----3(X-O-Ac)-beta-D-G lcp1----3. EPSb synthesis occurred either in strains containing a mutation in a locus designated mucR or in strains with a recombinant cosmid pMuc. mucR mapped slightly counterclockwise from pyr49 on the chromosome, while pMuc contained genes mapping to the megaplasmid pRmeSU47b. In exoA, -F, and -H mutants, which are deficient in normal succinoglycan secretion and nodule invasion, a transposon Tn5 insertion in mucR or the presence of pMuc resulted in EPSb secretion and a restoration of nodule invasion on Medicago sativa and Melilotus alba. Mutants in exoB and exoC were incapable of succinoglycan and EPSb secretion as well as nodule invasion. A mutant that secreted succinoglycan but was incapable of EPSb secretion invaded nodules normally.\r"

The C-terminal regions of the deduced polypeptides encoded by the bean (PVPK-1) and rice (G11A) cDNAs, prepared from mRNAs of suspension cultures and leaves, respectively, contain features characteristic of the catalytic domains of eukaryotic protein-serine/threonine kinases, indicating that these cDNAs encode plant protein kinases. The putative catalytic domains are most closely related to cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases and the protein kinase C family, suggesting the plant homologs may likewise transduce extracellular signals. However, outside these domains, PVPK-1 and G11A exhibit no homology either to each other or to regulatory domains of other protein kinases, indicating the plant homologs are modulated by other signals. PVPK-1 corresponds to a 2.4-kb transcript in suspension cultured bean cells. Southern blots of genomic DNA indicate that PVPK-1 and G11A correspond to single copy genes that form part of a family of related plant sequences.\r"

UV damage sufficient to prevent all elongating RNA polymerase from reaching T3 from upstream had no adverse effect on the density of RNA polymerase at the very 5' end of the gene.

The lowest eigenfrequency of the B conformation is found to drastically decrease with increased NaCl concentration. This suggests that a soft mode mechanism may be a precursor for the B-to-Z conversion. The free energy balance governing the B-Z isomerization of d(C-G)3 is dominated by the solvent-averaged effective phosphate-phosphate interactions due to substantial cancelations between the much larger intramolecular energy contributions.\r"

Accordingly, human basic FGF contains consensus sequences that account for its phosphorylation on Thr-112 by the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PK-A) and on Ser-64 by the calcium- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C (PK-C). A kinetic analysis of both of these reactions revealed that basic FGF is among the better substrates for these enzymes. Although the kinase responsible for the phosphorylation in vivo has not yet been identified, we examined the effects of phosphorylation on the biological activity, heparin-binding capacity, and receptor-binding capacity of phosphorylated basic FGF. No effects of phosphorylation were observed when the mitogen was phosphorylated by PK-C. In contrast, when basic FGF was phosphorylated in the receptor-binding domain with PK-A, the growth factor was 3-8 times better at displacing radiolabeled basic FGF in the radioreceptor assay. No effects were seen on the binding of this FGF to immobilized heparin or cell-associated glycosaminoglycans, suggesting that this phosphorylation modifies the affinity of basic FGF for its receptor. Biological assays for basic FGF failed to identify differences between the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of recombinant basic FGFs presumably because of the presence of ectophosphatases and the experimental conditions of proliferation and mitogenic assays (37 degrees C, 24-96 hr). Because the relative affinity of basic FGF for its receptor and cell-associated glycosaminoglycans may regulate its activity, the identification of a modified form of basic FGF may be of particular importance in understanding the mechanisms that regulate its biological activity, bioavailability, and processing to and from the extracellular matrix.\r"

Some studies have suggested that a disturbance in the normal asymmetric distribution of PS--e.g., PS exposure in the outer leaflet of the cell membrane, which can occur upon platelet activation as well as in certain pathologic red cells--serves as a potent procoagulant surface and as a signal for triggering their recognition by macrophages. These studies suggest that the regulation of PS distribution in cell membranes may be critical in controlling coagulation and in determining the survival of pathologic cells in the circulation. In this paper we describe a sensitive technique, based on PS-dependent prothrombinase complex activity, for assessing the amount of PS on the external leaflet of intact viable cells. Our results indicate that tumorigenic, undifferentiated murine erythroleukemic cells express 7- to 8-fold more PS in their outer leaflet than do their differentiated, nontumorigenic counterparts. Increased expression of PS in the tumorigenic cells directly correlated with their ability to be recognized and bound by macrophages.\r"

To elucidate whether PCNA/cyclin is a universal protein necessary for proliferation of eukaryotes, a search was conducted for PCNA/cyclin homologues in higher plants. In Southern blot-hybridization analysis, a rat PCNA/cyclin cDNA probe hybridized with homologous sequences in genomic DNAs from rice, soybean, and tobacco. A PCNA/cyclin-related molecular clone (pCJ-1) was isolated from rice DNA and was partially sequenced. The pCJ-1 probe hybridized with a 1.2-kilobase transcript in RNA from rice root tips and shoots. Immunoblot analysis of the soluble extract of soybean root tips with monospecific anti-PCNA/cyclin identified an immunoreactive protein with an apparent Mr of 34,000. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the presence of an immunoreactive PCNA/cyclin protein in the nuclei of cells in the meristem of soybean root tips. The highly homologous nature of the gene for PCNA/cyclin throughout the animal and plant kingdoms suggests that the product of the gene plays an essential role in DNA replication in eukaryotes.\r"

  ".W": "Mouse t haplotypes are variant forms of chromosome 17 that exist at high frequencies in worldwide populations of several species of house mouse. They are known to differ from wild-type chromosomes with respect to two relative inversions referred to as proximal and distal. An untested assumption has been that these two inversions originated in the chromosomal lineage leading to present-day t haplotypes. To investigate the evolutionary origins of these inversions and the possibility of additional inversions, interspecific crosses were performed between Mus spretus or Mus abbotti and laboratory strains of Mus domesticus that carried wild-type and t haplotypes forms of chromosome 17. The results provide evidence for the existence of two additional nonoverlapping inversions--one between the proximal and distal inversions and one between the centromere and the proximal inversion. These four inversions span nearly the entire region of t haplotype recombination suppression. Considering the distribution of these inversions among the species studied as well as the organization of the D17Leh66 family of DNA elements, we infer that the proximal inversion occurred on the lineage leading to the common ancestor of M. domesticus and M. abbotti, and that the other three inversions occurred on the separate lineage leading to present-day t haplotypes. Alternative models for the evolution of t haplotypes are discussed in light of these findings.\r"

The genetic functions of BPV1 involved in colony formation and in long-term immortalization were investigated by both translation termination mutations in the full-length genome, which inactivate individual open reading frames, and constructs in which these open reading frames were separately expressed under control of long terminal repeat promoter enhancers. Expression of either open reading frame E2 or E5 was sufficient for formation of a drug-resistant colony, but long-term growth in culture required that of E6. No significant cooperative effect was observed upon cotransfection of BPV1 and ras oncogene DNAs. Expression of the early region of the human papillomavirus type 16 also led to immortalization of rat embryo fibroblast cells in the same assay, and, unlike what was previously reported in baby rat kidney cells, it required neither activation by a heterologous promoter, nor a cooperating ras oncogene.\r"

About 1 day earlier, the foot begins to swell, which is regarded as a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction. To answer the question of whether the local inflammatory response is involved in virus clearance, we needed to known what cells mediate both these phenomena. With three different procedures--namely, depletion in vivo of defined cells by treatment of mice with monoclonal antibodies (\"serologic surgery\"), adoptive immunization with negatively selected cells, and adoptive immunization with cells from mice differing at the major histocompatibility gene complex--it is shown that the LCM virus-induced local DTH reaction consists of two phases that are sequentially mediated by (first) class I-restricted cytotoxic/suppressive CD8+ and (second) class II-restricted helper/inducer CD4+ T lymphocytes. In contrast, for virus elimination only the former subset of T lymphocytes was found to be needed. Thus, an association may exist between the CD8+ cell-mediated component of the local DTH response and control of the infection, but the CD4+ cell-mediated part appears to be of doubtful antiviral relevance.\r"

  ".W": "Spinal cord disease is common in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and a characteristic vacuolar myelopathy is present at autopsy in approximately one-fourth of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients. Pathologic examination of the spinal cord shows vacuolation of white matter and infiltration by macrophages, a process distinct from HIV-1 encephalopathy. To determine the presence and localization of HIV-1 RNA in the spinal cords of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients with vacuolar myelopathy, we used the technique of combined in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical staining on the same slide. Spinal cord tissue sections were stained with markers for macrophages, endothelial cells, oligodendroglia, astrocytes, and myelin and then hybridized in situ with HIV-1-specific RNA probes. Combined in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical staining on three spinal cords showed HIV-1 expression in mononuclear and multinucleated macrophages localized mainly to areas of myelopathy in spinal cord white matter. Immunohistochemical staining and electron microscopy showed myelin within macrophages and electron microscopy revealed HIV-1 budding from macrophages. These data suggest a role for HIV-1-infected macrophages locally in the pathogenesis of vacuolar myelopathy and add to the body of evidence that these cells play a role systemically in the development of HIV-1-related disease.\r"

  ".W": "A direct in vitro effect of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) was demonstrated on bone and cartilage cell energy metabolism. Sex-specific stimulation by E2 and testosterone was shown in diaphyseal bone of weanling rats. E2 (30 nM) caused, within 24 hr, a 70-200% increase in creatine kinase (CK; ATP:creatine N-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.3.2) specific activity in ROS 17/2.8 rat osteogenic sarcoma cells, MC3T3-E1 mouse calvaria-derived cells, and rat fetal calvaria cells, and a 40% increase in rat epiphyseal cartilage cells. Stimulation of CK activity by E2 was dose and time dependent: in ROS 17/2.8 cells, a highly significant increase was found at 3 nM E2 and a greater than 100% increase in CK activity was found 1 hr after E2 administration. In female 20-day-old Wistar-derived rats, E2 (5 micrograms per rat) increased CK activity in diaphyseal bone by 82% within 1 hr of i.p. injection, with a maximal increase of 200% after 24 hr; neither the weakly estrogenic agonist 17 alpha-estradiol, testosterone, nor progesterone showed this effect. Conversely, in male rat diaphyseal bone, testosterone or dihydrotestosterone increased CK activity after 24 hr by approximately 100%, while E2 was ineffective. In epiphyseal cartilage, both E2 and testosterone increased CK activity. Stimulation of CK activity by sex hormones was paralleled by significant increases in [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. Therefore, it is possible that direct sex-specific actions of gonadal steroids may contribute to stimulating bone growth and maintaining balanced bone turnover.\r"

Chemical sequencing from its amino terminus and of peptides obtained by digestion with protease from Staphylococcus aureus strain V-8 demonstrated that saposin A is derived from proteolytic processing of domain 1 of its precursor protein, prosaposin. Processing of prosaposin (70 kDa) also generates three other previously reported saposin proteins, B, C, and D, from its second, third, and fourth domains. Similar to saposin C, saposin A stimulates the hydrolysis of 4-methylumbelliferyl beta-glucoside and glucocerebroside by beta-glucosylceramidase and of galactocerebroside by beta-galactosylceramidase, mainly by increasing the maximal velocity of both reactions. Saposin A is as active as saposin C in these reactions. Saposin A has no significant effect on other sphingolipid and 4-methylumbelliferyl glycoside hydrolases tested. Saposin A has two potential glycosylation sites that appear to be glycosylated. After deglycosylation, saposin A had a subunit molecular mass of 10 kDa and was as active as native saposin A. However, reduction and alkylation abolished the activation. A three-dimensional model comparing saposins A and C reveals significant sequence homology between them, especially preservation of conserved acidic and basic residues in their middle regions. Each appears to possess a conformationally rigid hydrophobic pocket stabilized by three internal disulfide bridges, with amphipathic helical regions interrupted by helix breakers.\r"

The retinas were then incubated in vitro in the presence of radioactive gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and autoradiographed. The cells that accumulated DAPI were found to accumulate GABA, confirming immunohistochemical evidence that the cholinergic amacrine cells contain GABA. Incubation of retinas in the presence of elevated concentrations of K+ caused them to release acetylcholine and GABA, and autoradiography showed depletion of radioactive GABA from the cholinergic amacrine cells. This indicates that the cholinergic amacrine cells can secrete acetylcholine and GABA. Retinas were double-labeled with [14C]GABA and [3H]acetylcholine, allowing simultaneous measurement of their release. The release of [14C]GABA was found to be independent of extracellular Ca2+. Radioactive GABA synthesized endogenously from [14C]glutamate behaved the same way as radioactive GABA accumulated from the medium. In the same experiments the simultaneously measured release of [3H]acetylcholine was strongly Ca2+-dependent, indicating that the releases of acetylcholine and GABA are controlled by different mechanisms. Synaptic vesicles immunologically isolated from double-labeled retinas contained much [3H]acetylcholine and little or no [14C]GABA. These results suggest that the cholinergic amacrine cells release acetylcholine primarily by vesicle exocytosis and release GABA primarily by means of a carrier.\r"

When the selective mu opioid receptor agonist Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-MePhe-Gly-ol was in the patch-clamp electrode, unitary inward currents were observed with conductance of approximately 45 pS (measured at zero pipette potential, with 150 mM potassium in the recording electrode). Long silences, lasting many seconds to minutes, separated periods of activity of similar durations. Within such activity periods the distribution of closed times of the channels was best fitted by the sum of two exponential functions (time constants approximately 1 and 30 ms), and the durations of channel openings were fit by a single exponential function; mean open time increased from 2 to 120 ms as agonist concentration increased. Channel activity was not seen when high concentrations of opioids were applied to the neuron outside the patch-clamp recording electrode, indicating intimate coupling between receptor and potassium channel. Unitary currents with similar properties were also seen when pipettes contained alpha 2 adrenoceptor agonists or somatostatin. Taken with previous findings, the results indicate that mu opioid receptors, alpha 2 adrenoceptors, and somatostatin receptors can couple directly to membrane potassium channels through the local intermediary action of a GTP binding protein.\r"

  ".U": "89240747\r", 
  ".W": "Calbindin-D9k was quantified and its cellular location was defined in uterus, yolk sac, and placenta. In late gestation (days 17 to term) coordinated induction of calbindin-D9k was seen in uterine epithelial lining cells and juxtaposed yolk sac visceral epithelium as well as the intraplacental yolk sac epithelium. The induction of calbindin-D9k in these cells coincided with the time of exponential fetal bone growth and maximal fetal accumulation of calcium, suggesting a role of the protein in these epithelial layers in maternal-fetal calcium transport. Dynamic changes also occurred in the calbindin-D9k contents of the two layers of uterine smooth muscle (outer longitudinal and inner circular) during mid- and late gestation. During early pregnancy (days 0-4), calbindin-D9k was present in the two smooth muscle layers. By midgestation (day 10), calbindin-D9k had decreased by a factor of 10 in these tissue layers. During late gestation calbindin-D9k rebounded in the inner circular smooth muscle layer. These uterine changes of early and midgestation were reproduced by the endocrine changes of pseudopregnancy. Progesterone appeared to be a good candidate for controlling the midgestational decrease of uterine muscle calbindin-D9k, as it blunted estrogen's induction of the protein in the muscle layers and stroma in a dose-dependent manner. Changes in myometrial calbindin-D9k may reflect variations in muscular calcium storage, thereby representing alterations in potential for contraction.\r"

Disease extent was assessed on CT scans by visual scoring (0%-100% involvement of the lung parenchyma) and on radiographs by using an adaptation of the International Labour Office classification. The severity of parenchymal changes on the CT scan and on the radiograph was significantly correlated with the severity of dyspnea (r = .61 and .58, respectively; P less than .001), diffusing capacity (r = -.62 and -.52, P less than .01), and vital capacity (r = -.49 and -.51, P less than .01). Patients with predominantly irregular opacities had more severe dyspnea and lower lung volumes than patients with predominantly nodular opacities (P less than .05).

CT scans were evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively. Patients were divided into five categories on the basis of the pattern of abnormality at CT: 1 = normal (n = 4); 2 = segmental air-space disease (n = 4); 3 = spherical (alveolar) masslike opacities (n = 4); 4 = multiple, discrete, small nodules (n = 6); and 5 = distortion of parenchymal structures (fibrotic end-stage sarcoidosis) (n = 9). The percentage of the volume judged to be abnormal (CT grade) was correlated with PFT results for each CT and radiographic category. CT grades were also correlated with gallium scanning results and percentage of lymphocytes recovered from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Patients in CT categories 1 and 2 had normal lung function, those in category 3 had mild functional impairment, and those in categories 4 and 5 showed moderate to severe dysfunction. The overall CT grade correlated well with PFT results expressed as a percentage of the predicted value. In five patients, CT scans showed extensive parenchymal disease not seen on radiographs. CT grades did not correlate with the results of gallium scanning or BAL lymphocytes. The authors conclude that patterns of parenchymal sarcoidosis seen at CT correlate with the PFT results and can be used to indicate respiratory impairment.\r"

The radiologic appearance of the thoracic involvement varied. Pleural effusion, interstitial and alveolar lung disease, nodules, and, infrequently, hilar and mediastinal adenopathy were observed. ARL of the chest was most commonly extranodal. Pleural effusion and lung disease were the two most common manifestations of ARL on chest radiographs and computed tomographic scans. The authors recommend that clinicians treating patients with suspected or known AIDS consider ARL when a pleural effusion or a noninfective interstitial or alveolar process is present.\r"

Of 8,408 mammograms obtained in 1985, 221 (3%) demonstrated asymmetric breast tissue. Follow-up was 36-42 months after the initial mammographic study. During this time none of the patients underwent biopsy on the basis of mammographic findings, although 20 underwent excisional biopsy because of clinical findings. Breast cancer was diagnosed in two patients and breast lymphoma in one patient. Biopsy specimens from the remaining 17 patients were benign. At mammography, all three malignant lesions had a palpable abnormality associated with the asymmetric tissue. Breast cancer was not found in any of the remaining 201 patients. Therefore, an asymmetric volume of breast tissue, asymmetrically dense breast tissue, or asymmetrically prominent ducts that do not form a mass, do not contain microcalcifications, or do not produce architectural distortion should be viewed with concern only when associated with a palpable asymmetry and are otherwise normal variations.\r"

The method involves the use of a monoclonal antibody fragment mixture that binds to platelets. The antibody was labeled with technetium-99m, and imaging was performed with a gamma camera in the planar and single photon emission computed tomography modes. This method allowed visualization of areas of ischemia of 1-6 hours duration in bowel loops in 19 dogs 90-180 minutes after injection of the radiolabeled antibody. No bowel radioactivity accumulation occurred in dogs that underwent the same surgical procedure but were given a nonspecific Tc-99m-labeled antibody or in normal dogs given the specific antibody. It appears that the radiolabeled antibody used, which has higher reactivity with human platelets than with dog platelets, will be a good agent for noninvasive diagnosis of mesenteric vaso-occlusive disease in humans. It may also play a role in the intraoperative determination of the extent and location of ischemic bowel segments.\r"

If hemodialysis shunts malfunction, immediate dilation of stenotic lesions should be performed to prevent occlusion.\r"

  ".W": "The authors evaluated the ability of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging at 1.5 T to characterize 28 adrenal masses, using several variables: signal intensity ratios (adrenal/liver and adrenal/fat) on T2- and T1-weighted images, and the calculated T2 relaxation time of the adrenal mass. Signal intensity ratios were unreliable in distinguishing adenomas from nonadenomas. The calculated T2 relaxation time was more useful: All 15 adrenal masses with a T2 of less than 60 msec were adenomas. A T2 greater than 60 msec was less specific and included six metastases, two pheochromocytomas, one adrenal carcinoma, two adrenal hemorrhages, and two nonhyper-functioning adenomas. Therefore, T2 values are more accurate than signal intensity ratios for characterization of adrenal masses at 1.5 T. The unsuitability of previously published criteria determined with 0.35- and 0.5-T systems may reflect the change of T1 and T2 relaxation times with field strength, altering the relative T1 and T2 weighting by a given pulse sequence.\r"

Dynamic perfusion studies after gadolinium diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid (DTPA) administration were performed by repeated imaging at short time intervals. With more T2 weighting (TR = 60 msec, TE = 30 msec, and flip angle = 15 degrees), malignant tumors and pheochromocytomas had a significantly higher relative signal intensity than adenomas; overlap of signal intensity led to equivocal findings in nine cases. After administration of Gd-DTPA, adenomas showed only mild enhancement and quick washout; malignant tumors and pheochromocytomas showed strong enhancement and slower washout. Five of the nine cases that were equivocal in precontrast images could thus be correctly classified. In addition to this improved classification of adrenal masses, fast, dynamic contrast material-enhanced MR imaging resulted in a reduction in total examination time.\r"

With a 2,000/56-100 sequence (repetition time msec/echo time msec), the majority of lesions were visually isointense to liver. Of 34 quantitative measures, only lesion-liver and lesion-kidney intensity ratios at 2,000/150 showed statistically significant differences among nonhyperfunctioning adenomas, aldosterone-producing lesions, and corticosteroid-producing lesions; however, the authors question the significance of these differences because of the abundant noise associated with the 2,000/150 sequence. The results suggest that nonhyperfunctioning adrenal cortical adenomas cannot be distinguished from benign hyperfunctioning cortical lesions with use of MR imaging at 0.35 T.\r"

MR imaging demonstrated seven of eight endometriomas but only 14 of 29 adhesions and only six of 45 endometrial implants. While MR imaging demonstrated endometriomas, ovarian adhesions, and extraperitoneal endometrial implants, it could not accurately depict extraovarian endometrial adhesions and intraperitoneal endometrial implants. In addition, MR imaging findings did not correlate with the surgically determined severity of the disease. These limitations indicate that MR imaging cannot be used as the primary modality in the detection, characterization, and staging of endometriosis; laparoscopy remains the procedure of choice.\r"

The signal intensities ranged from hyperintense on all pulse sequences (41 of 88) to hypointense on all sequences (24 of 88); the remainder demonstrated signal intensities corresponding to the appearances of acute, subacute, and chronic hematomas. Hypointense or signal-void rims on both T1- and T2-weighted images were detected in 35 lesions. Identification of the disease with MR imaging versus concurrent surgery was compared for 76 sites in 19 patients. Findings were true-positive in 24 cases, false-negative in ten, true-negative in 32, and false-positive in seven, resulting in an MR sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 82%. Adhesions obscured the disease at laparoscopy in three patients. MR imaging cannot be used as a substitute for laparoscopy in the definitive diagnosis or staging of endometriosis. However, it can be used to monitor treatment response in place of laparoscopy once a diagnosis is firmly established.\r"

The presence of fat in 40 of 43 cases (93%), tooth or calcification in 24 of 43 (56%), Rokitansky protuberance in 35 of 43 (81%), tufts of hair in 28 of 43 (65%), and a fat-fluid level in five of 43 (12%) allowed a definite diagnosis of ovarian cystic teratoma in 42 of 43 cases (98%). In the two cases of malignancy, single large (greater than 10 cm) plugs (with uptake of contrast medium in one) with a cauliflower appearance and an irregular border forming an obtuse angle with the inner wall of the cyst suggested malignant transformation. In three cases of benign cystic teratoma, a mucinous tumor (one benign, one borderline, one malignant) arising in the same ovary was seen at pathologic examination but was only diagnosed with the help of CT in two of three cases. Thickening of the tube was noted in two cases of torsion of the adnexa. CT findings were compared with findings at radiography of the abdomen and hysterosalpingography in 30 cases, ultrasound in 31, and magnetic resonance imaging in three. This study demonstrated that CT was the best procedure for imaging cystic teratomas of the ovary.\r"

Severity of splenic parenchymal disruption and the presence of hemoperitoneum were each graded on a scale of 0-3 (maximal total score = 6). The splenic injury was graded retrospectively (stage 1) in 29 patients and prospectively (stage 2) in 35 patients. Patients who were treated surgically had a significantly higher score than those who were treated conservatively (3.8 vs 1.9 in stage 1, 4.1 vs 1.7 in stage 2, P less than .001 for both stages). Data analysis showed that patients with a splenic score of less than 2.5 can be treated safely without surgery, while patients with a splenic score of 2.5 or more are more likely to need surgery. In the latter group of patients, CT scoring did not change the operative rate (74% vs 75%) but did prompt earlier surgical intervention in stage 2. This significantly increased the rate at which spleen-saving operations were performed (from 21% to 67%, P less than .032) and the overall rate of splenic salvage. The CT scoring system used in this study appears to be a simple, reproducible, and useful method for quantitating splenic injury in blunt abdominal trauma.\r"

Lymphadenopathy also occurred in unusual sites for benign adenopathy, including the paracardiac (24%) and mesenteric (19%) lymph nodes. Surgical or autopsy confirmation of enlarged lymph nodes was made in 13 patients, and histologic analysis of the specimens revealed reactive hyperplasia, sinus hyperplasia, sinus histiocytosis, fibrosis, or normal architecture in these enlarged nodes.

The authors evaluated images of 50 consecutive patients who had undergone the newer procedure. Thirty-one complications were identified. Two normal variants that could be confused with abnormalities were noted: (a) the featureless appearance of the duodenal bulb may be mistaken for extravasation, and (b) contrastmaterial filling of the proximal jejunal loop at an end-to-end anastomosis with retained invaginated pancreas may be mistaken for intussusception. Another pitfall was failure to evaluate the pancreaticojejunostomy anastomosis fully, resulting in false-negative radiologic interpretations when leaks were present. The approach to postoperative examination of patients who have undergone the pylorus-preserving Whipple procedure is different from that of patients who have undergone the standard procedure. Radiologists should be familiar with this approach, the normal postoperative anatomy, and pitfalls in imaging so that complications can be diagnosed and treated.\r"

Interposition of the colon between the liver and anterolateral abdominal wall and/or diaphragm was seen in 18 of the 75 (24%) cirrhotic patients and in six of the 200 (3%) control subjects. There was a strong correlation among gallbladder malposition, colonic interposition, and a ratio of transverse caudate lobe width to right lobe width (C/RL) exceeding 0.60. Patients with cirrhosis, colonic interposition, and gallbladder malposition had a mean C/RL of 0.62, compared with a mean of 0.50 for cirrhotic patients without interposition (P less than .0001). The mean C/RL for control subjects without interposition was 0.43, as compared with 0.69 for control subjects with interposition (P less than .01).

Axial images delineated well the bone and ligament walls of the carpal tunnel. The median nerve was well delimited and of moderate signal intensity. It was surrounded in some cases by fat but was consistently bound by specific tendons. The ulnar nerve and artery were visualized as they traversed the Guyon canal to their division into superficial and deep branches. Coronal images permitted optimal visualization of the triangular fibrocartilage and the radial and ulnar collateral ligaments. Quantitative studies indicated that the normal median nerve does not significantly increase in size within the carpal tunnel but does become more flattened at the level of the pisiform bone. The normal flexor retinaculum may have a slight palmar bowing.\r"

Findings related to cause were tendon sheath edema in traumatic tenosynovitis, synovial hypertrophy in rheumatoid tenosynovitis, a ganglion cyst, and excessive amount of fat within the carpal tunnel, a persistent median artery, and a large adductor pollicis muscle. Knowledge of these findings may permit more rational choice of treatment. In four cases in which symptoms persisted after surgery, findings valuable in explaining or predicting the failure included incomplete incision of the flexor retinaculum, excessive fat within the carpal tunnel, persistent neuritis of the median nerve, and development of neuromas.\r"

In all cases, there was excellent correlation between the two studies. When compared with computed tomography (CT), MR imaging was superior in defining the presence and extent of local disease. While the appearances of various foot neoplasms are nonspecific, the ease of multiplanar imaging, the superior contrast resolution, and the sensitivity to marrow abnormalities are major advantages of MR imaging over CT in staging foot neoplasms. These advantages are crucial when foot-sparing curative resection of a malignancy is contemplated. The combination of plain radiography and MR imaging may be all that is necessary for optimal preoperative detection and local staging of tumors of the foot.\r"

To characterize the prevalence and significance of these findings better, a retrospective study of MR imaging of the knee, performed on the first 434 consecutive patients at a primarily outpatient community MR imaging center, was undertaken. A signal intensity loss demonstrated on images with a short echo time (20 or 25 msec) was divided into three types based on morphologic criteria. A type 1 finding was a diffuse, often reticulated signal intensity loss in the metaphyseal and epiphyseal regions of bone. A type 2 loss was associated with an interruption in the smooth, black cortical line. A type 3 finding was a profound signal intensity loss primarily restricted to the immediate subcortical region. Seventeen percent of all cases revealed a type 1 or 2 loss that may have been compatible with acute bone injuries. These bone lesions were frequently associated with tears of the anterior cruciate ligament and contralateral collateral ligament, but infrequently these lesions were detected with plain radiography and arthroscopy. When associated with a weight-bearing cortex, bone injuries detected with MR imaging may explain clinical symptoms of pain on weight bearing, and type 1 injuries may represent regions of bone at increased risk for the subsequent development of insufficiency fractures if the bone is not adequately protected during trabecular healing.\r"

Twenty-four healthy volunteers served as control subjects. The percentage of change in cross-sectional area during quiet tidal breathing was used as a measure of airway compliance. Compared with weight-matched control subjects, patients with obstructive sleep apnea had smaller oropharyngeal airways (40.4 vs 177.8 mm2) (P less than .001) and smaller nasopharyngeal airways (31.3 vs 134.2 mm2) (P less than .001).

Patients with obstructive sleep apnea are characterized by a small, collapsible oropharyngeal airway and by nasopharyngeal airway narrowing. These abnormalities can cause sleep-disordered breathing. Ultrafast CT scanning allows rapid, noninvasive assessment of airway variables.\r"

Fifteen patients referred for evaluation of anterior circulation in cerebrovascular disease composed the pilot group. Twelve patients underwent correlative intraarterial DSA examinations. The FLASH volume sequence, with an echo time of 7.7 seconds, produced high-signal-intensity vascular images for 28 of 30 bifurcations. Of the 24 carotid bifurcations studied with DSA, 22 were depicted with MR angiography. Among the depicted bifurcations, 21 showed good correlation with the DSA images. These included four of four normal bifurcations, three of three with mild stenosis, four of four with moderate stenosis, eight of nine with severe stenosis, and two of two with occlusions. With respect to ulceration, three of four MR angiographic studies showed good correlation with DSA images. This preliminary experience indicates that the method is reproducible and capable of delineating carotid lesions in patients and that it can be performed in conjunction with conventional spin-echo imaging of the brain with only a small increase in patient examination time.\r"

Chest injuries occurred more frequently in children less than 7 years of age than in older children (62% vs 38%, P less than .02). Children with chest injuries tended to be more physiologically unstable than children without, as determined with lower (worse) mean trauma scores (P less than .001). Both the presence and severity of chest injuries strongly affected outcome. Mortality was 1.3% in children with no chest injury, 10.8% in children with significant unilateral chest injury, and 40% in children with significant bilateral or mediastinal chest injury (P less than .0001). Significant unsuspected or underestimated thoracic injuries are relatively common in children, and CT scans of the chest obtained while examinations of the upper abdomen are being performed can be helpful in the early recognition of such injuries.\r"

Despite a variety of procedures to elongate the esophagus, surgeons have been unable to achieve esophageal continuity in many patients. Three infants with esophageal atresia and long gaps recently underwent hydrostatic dilation of the distal esophageal pouch followed by primary anastomosis. The technique entailed passing a balloon-tipped catheter through a gastrostomy site to the distal esophageal pouch. The balloon was inflated to a diameter sufficient to occlude the distal esophagus. Dilute contrast material was then infused under fluoroscopic visualization to a maximal pressure of 145 cm H2O. Dilations were performed daily over a 2-week period, followed by surgery. Primary anastomosis was accomplished in all patients. The promising results in these patients should stimulate other investigators to assess this technique in infants with this challenging surgical problem.\r"

T2 relaxation times of lymph nodes containing metastases showed a significantly higher value (61 msec +/- 6.2, P less than .005) after interstitial administration of the contrast agent. Intravenous administration of AMI-25 did not produce enhancement of normal or metastatic lymph node relaxation times. The signal intensity of normal lymph nodes decreased profoundly on spin-echo MR images (repetition time of 500 msec, echo time of 30 msec) after interstitial administration, whereas lymph nodes with metastases showed no significant change in signal intensity. Experimental results indicate that MR lymphography may potentially increase the sensitivity of MR imaging the detection of lymphatic malignancy.\r"

The preimaging pulse sequence consists of a radio-frequency (RF) pulse to produce transverse magnetization, a magnetic field gradient to \"wrap\" the phase along the direction of the gradient, and a second RF pulse to mix the modulated transverse magnetization with the longitudinal magnetization. The resulting images show periodic stripes due to the modulation. Motion between the time of striping and image formation is directly demonstrated as a corresponding displacement of the stripes. This technique can be used to study heart wall motion, to distinguish slowly moving blood from thrombus, and to study the flow of blood and cerebrospinal fluid.\r"

These differences result in qualitatively different spectral properties. The authors studied the efficiency of the full-frame technique when applied to CT and MR images. They achieved excellent results, with compression ratios in the neighborhood of 5:1.

The authors propose to use molecular diffusion, for which temperature dependence is well known. Molecular diffusion is more sensitive than T1 and can be determined with high accuracy with MR imaging. Diffusion and derived temperature images were obtained with a 2 X 2-mm pixel size in a polyacrylamide gel phantom heated inside the head coil of a clinical 0.5-T whole-body MR imaging system by means of a modified clinical HT device made compatible with the system. Temperatures determined from these images with 0.8-cm2 regions of interest were found to be within 0.5 degrees C of those recorded with thermocouples placed inside the gel. The utility of this method in clinical hyperthermia is enhanced by its potential to also help monitor blood perfusion.\r"

The limitation of hypothesis formation and testing to imaging methods alone, however, could be a major impediment to more successful sponsorship of research in this discipline. The author emphasizes that a well-designed research plan in diagnostic radiology should not be restricted solely to imaging methods and should include such factors as the formation of well-defined hypotheses testable by means of inductive reasoning and, most important, flexibility in approaches to research methods. Other factors influencing effective research in diagnostic imaging include the establishment of mentors for continuous training and support, uninterrupted time for research, and a totally supportive environment. Improvements in these areas may enhance the competitiveness of research proposals from departments of diagnostic radiology.\r"

Average pitches were measured by two-dimensional Fourier transforms and by topographic profiles along the fiber axes. Values were typically 7 percent less than standard dimensions of A-form RNA and B-form DNA fibers. This result is compatible with the mild dehydration that occurred under air-drying conditions. More extensive dehydration typically led to 19 percent shrinkage. Analysis of specific regions allowed local variations in helical pitch as small as 1 angstrom to be detected, thus demonstrating that the STM can visualize functionally significant modulations of nucleic acid structure.\r"

Furthermore, in a model of experimental cutaneous leishmaniasis in hamsters, the drug conjugate brought about more than 90% reduction in the size of footpad lesions within 11 days. In contrast, the free drug at a similar concentration did not significantly affect lesion size. These studies demonstrate the potential of receptor-mediated drug delivery in the therapy of macrophage-associated diseases.\r"

Stability can be temporarily induced by adaptation to a three-dimensional globe with a direction of rotation unambiguously specified by stereo disparity; adaptation causes the two-dimensional figure to appear to rotate in the direction opposite that experienced during stereoscopic adaptation. This adaptation effect is selective for axis of rotation but is not shape-specific. It does depend on simultaneous stimulation by multiple depth planes defined by elements moving in different directions. Evidently information about stereopsis and information about structure from motion are integrated within a common neural site in the brain.\r"

Two patients showed a dramatic improvement during the treatment. Their mute, immobile states were reversed and they were able to speak a few coherent words. Their mental status deteriorated when the drug was withdrawn. Transient clinical improvement was noted when amantadine was reinstituted. In all patients EEG showed typical repetitive periodic sharp waves (PSW) similar to those seen in Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease. Alterations of PSW accompanied the initial clinical improvement. We speculate that amantadine acts as a central stimulant by enhancing the release of central endogenous dopamine and possibly other neurotransmitters.\r"

To test the theory that narcotic antagonists might offer an improvement in neurologic sequelae following stroke, we administered various doses of naloxone intraperitoneally to 50 adult gerbils 45 minutes after carotid artery transsection. Low-dose naloxone therapy (1.0 to 2.5 mg/kg) was more effective in preventing death than either control (sterile saline) or high-dose naloxone (10 mg/kg). A naloxone dose of 1.0 or 2.5 mg/kg offered a significant improvement in mortality over both the control and the high-dose therapy (P = .026). It appears that an appropriate dose of naloxone (1.0 to 2.5 mg/kg), given early enough to alter outcome, offers an improved survival in the gerbil stroke model. This finding obviously has significant implications for the use of narcotic antagonists in human beings with stroke.\r"

Although most cases usually respond to appropriate therapy, some occasionally progress to the development of intracranial complications, including meningitis, osteomyelitis, epidural and subdural empyema, intracranial mucocele or polyps, and frank brain abscess. It is important to develop a rational approach to the diagnosis and treatment of these conditions. A high clinical index of suspicion must always be maintained, since symptoms are often masked by previous antibiotic therapy. Radiologic evaluation must always include computerized tomography (CT) for accurate diagnosis and surgical planning. Therapy includes surgical drainage and high doses of appropriate intravenous antibiotics. Cefuroxime and metronidazole provide excellent broad spectrum antibacterial coverage. Only early recognition and appropriate therapy can reduce the potential morbidity and mortality associated with these life-threatening complications.\r"

The study group included 25 women and 16 men with mean ages of 60 and 56 years, respectively. Each patient had clinical evaluation for medications or illnesses that might affect plasma lipid levels before entry into the study. The most striking lipid abnormality was the preponderance of decreased levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). In 94% of the study population, HDL-C values were less than the mean values of the age-matched reference population. For men the mean HDL-C level was 30.8 mg/dl (vs 45 mg/dl in the reference population, P less than .001); for women the mean HDL-C level was 33 mg/dl (vs 50 mg/dl, P less than .001). The total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and triglyceride levels of those in the study were not significantly different from those of the patients in the reference population. Evaluation of cardiac risk based solely on HDL-C levels showed 80% of the study population to have three to four times the average risk. This study points out the high probability of decreased HDL-C levels in patients with xanthelasma. Since the level of HDL-C has been shown to be inversely related to the incidence of cardiovascular disease, it may be prudent to evaluate HDL-C levels and do a thorough cardiovascular evaluation in patients with xanthelasma.\r"

Five had normal coronary arteriograms. These patients described their pain in terms often associated with true angina. Musculoskeletal tenderness that did not reproduce the pain was common and was unrelated to coronary artery disease. Demonstration of musculoskeletal tenderness that reproduces chest pain, when combined with noninvasive findings suggesting low probability of coronary artery disease, may be useful in decreasing the incidence of unnecessary invasive cardiac evaluation, and appropriately directing initial therapy.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine the value of early endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) in patients with blunt pancreatic trauma. We attempted ERP in nine patients. Indications were abnormal pancreatic findings on CT scanning in five patients, a suboptimal view on CT scanning in three patients, and a high index of suspicion in one patient. ERP was successful in eight patients. Two had major ductal injury treated operatively and were discharged without complications. In six, ERP showed a normal pancreatic duct. These patients were treated conservatively; five were eventually discharged, and one died of necrotizing pneumonia. Our results suggest that ERP is safe and accurate in the diagnosis of blunt pancreatic ductal injuries. If the pancreatic ductal system is intact, conservative management is appropriate, but if ERP shows major ductal injury, surgical intervention is indicated.\r"

Recently a mathematical model was reported to standardize the height of stepping for individuals of various heights. We designed a study to validate this model using a three-minute single-stage step test for predicting VO2 max in women. Seventeen women aged 19 to 33 performed each of three rate-specific step tests and a Bruce treadmill test. Direct measurements of VO2 max obtained from the treadmill test were correlated with the 15 second recovery heart rates after three different step tests done at stepping frequencies of 22, 26, and 30 step-ups per minute. The correlation coefficients of prediction of VO2 max from 15 second recovery pulse counts and directly measured oxygen consumption were 0.74 at 22 step-ups/min, 0.77 at 30 step-ups/min, and 0.8 at 26 step-ups/min. Each relationship was significant at the P less than .01 level. It can be concluded that the single-stage step test described in this study provides an effective predictor of VO2 max in young women and can be used when more complex methods of laboratory testing are unavailable or not feasible.\r"

Minor wound hematomas were more common in the saline group, a finding that approached statistical significance.

Measurements of the pedicle were obtained before screw insertion using axial and coronal reformatted computed tomographic (CT) images, as well as graduated sounding of the pedicle. After sequentially loading each pedicle with increasingly larger screws, measurements were taken of the outer cortical diameters. Plastic deformation of the pedicle preceded pedicle fracture or cutout when the screw thread diameter became larger than the endosteal diameter or within 80% of the outer cortical diameter as measured from the CT scan. Pedicle screws did not obtain cortical purchase within the pedicle.\r"

The fixator has provided rigid stabilization for a variety of other spinal problems.\r"

The data showed that every strength parameter tested except male isokinetic flexion strength showed at least a 30% decrease when compared with normal values. Compared with strength data on these same patients immediately after surgery, a 2-tailed Student t test demonstrated a significant difference only in male isokinetic strength (P less than 0.10) and in female isokinetic strength (P less than 0.05). No other difference was found in isometric strength or endurance compared with data obtained from these patients 4 to 6 weeks postoperatively. From these data, it is obvious that more intensive physical therapy is necessary to improve postoperative strength in patients undergoing surgical diskectomy. These data allow for the design of specific isometric, isokinetic, and endurance rehabilitation programs for the postoperative diskectomy patient.\r"

This explanation derives from a mathematical model that predicts the existence of a relationship between lordosis (pelvic tilt) and the distribution of stresses within the spine. The model predicts that, for every angle of forward flexion, there is a unique degree of lordosis that will minimize and equalize the compressive stress within the spine. This stress-minimizing posture also is associated with the minimum muscular activity; the balance of the moment is supported by passive stretching of the connective tissues. These predictions were tested by comparing them with empirical values of spinal geometry and muscular activity, as measured simultaneously by an opto-electronic motion analysis and electromyographic (EMG) data collection system.\r"

The diagnosis was established by the clinical course, pathologic tissue changes at surgery, cultures, and response to antibiotic therapy. Normal Westergren sedimentation rates were noted in seven of nine patients, and normal white blood cell counts in six of nine patients. With the exception of two positive computed tomography (CT) scans, one positive gallium scan, and one positive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, all remaining imaging studies were negative for infection. In many cases, the infection neither was limited to nor involved the disc space.\r"

On review of these films, the abnormality was in fact present on the first discogram at two levels, and the second discogram was normal at two levels (radiologist error). Fusions had been done in three patients at adjacent levels between discograms. A compression fracture was present in adjacent vertebrae at two levels.

Once group assignment was made based on outcome, a variety of psychologic, socioeconomic, and demographic data obtained at the time of program admission was analyzed to determine if there were differences among the groups. Several factors were found to distinguish among the groups, including Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and Millon Behavioral Health Inventory (MBHI) scale scores, prior surgical history, level of worker compensation, and pain intensity ratings. These results confirm the presence of psychosocioeconomic differences among CLBP patients and suggest the need for continued research in this area to improve treatment efficacy in these patients.\r"

Inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) a chief complaint of leg pain, primarily; 2) a positive straight leg raising (SLR) at less than 60 degrees reproducing the leg pain; 3) a computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrating a herniated nucleus pulposus without significant stenosis by a radiologist's reading, which was also confirmed by the authors; 4) a positive electromyogram (EMG) demonstrating evidence of radiculopathy; and 5) response to a follow-up questionnaire. All patients had undergone an aggressive physical rehabilitation program consisting of back school and stabilization exercise training. Of a total of 347 consecutively identified patients, 64 patients with an average follow-up time of 31.1 months met the inclusion criteria and constituted the study population. They were sent questionnaires that inquired about activity level, pain level, work status, and further medical care. The patients with neurologic loss, extruded discs, and those seeking a second opinion regarding surgery were identified and subgrouped. Results for the total group included 90% good or excellent outcome with a 92% return to work rate. For the subgroups with extruded discs and second opinions, 87% and 83% had good or excellent outcomes, respectively, all (100%) of whom returned to work. Sick leave time for these subgroups was 2.9 months (+/- 1.4 months) and 3.4 months (+/- 1.7 months), respectively. These results compared favorably with previously published surgical studies. Four of six patients who required surgery were found to have stenosis at operation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The patients' pain status was assessed both preoperatively and postoperatively by a standard pain questionnaire and pain drawing. Each patient's response to the questionnaire and pain drawing, as well as his usage of narcotics and days of postoperative hospitalization, were recorded and analyzed. Dexamethasone was shown to have a significant and selective effect on reducing leg pain postoperatively, while also significantly reducing the usage of injectable narcotics and shortening the postoperative hospital stay.\r"

Only two patients with lateral recess stenosis underwent fusion with fair results. Approximately one-third of those with central-mixed stenosis required a fusion. Results were good in 70%. In those with stenosis following prior lumbar surgeries, although not statistically significant, those who had concomitant decompression and arthrodesis had a better outcome than those in whom decompression only was done. Patients with scoliosis and stenosis had decompression for significant motor and reflex deficits and fusion over the length of their major curves. Patients having decompression for lumbar stenosis with degenerative spondylolisthesis, isolated disc resorption with degenerative facet joints, intervertebral disc disease with instability, and those with scoliosis with multidirectional instabilities benefit from concomitant spinal fusion.\r"

  ".W": "The optimal surgical construct for lumbar fusion remains controversial. The posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) operation offers advantages including total nuclear disc excision, restoration of disc-space height, root decompression, limited muscle retraction and injury, and solid mechanical arthrodesis. Major disadvantages have included graft displacement, neurologic injury and nonunion. The use of posterior fixation as an adjunct to PLIF reduces the probability of these complications and increases the chances of fusion. This study examines 35 patients who underwent PLIF and facet-screw fixation. Indications for surgery included disabling low-back pain with discographic/MRI-demonstrated disc derrangement, recurrent disc herniation, and failed inter-transverse process fusions. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 18 months. There were no patients with significant neurologic injury or functional root loss. One patient developed graft displacement and failure of fixation (laminar fracture in markedly obese patient). Three patients had subcutaneous hematomas (no surgical treatment required). None of the cases required blood replacement. The authors have concluded that the addition of facet fixation/fusion to the PLIF operation substantially reduces the complication rate of the procedure.\r"

  ".W": "From January 1986 to June of 1987, 40 patients underwent transpedicle fixation and fusion using the variable spinal plate system. Nineteen patients had undergone surgery at the same level or levels, and 21 patients had undergone no previous surgery. Diagnostic categories include spondylolisthesis, thoracolumbar and lumbar fractures, internal disc derangement, spinal stenosis, pseudarthrosis, mechanical instability, and fracture mal-union. Minimum follow-up has been 14 months, with the average being 20 months. Overall results showed 13 excellent, 12 good, seven fair, and eight poor. The overall complication rate was 45%. In those patients undergoing no previous surgery, it was 29%, but with those patients having previous surgery, it was 63%. Most of these complications were minor in nature and resolved before discharge. Implant failure occurred in seven patients, and consisted of screw breakage. Design modifications currently available should help minimize this complication. Although this method of internal fixation and fusion is technically demanding and has a high complication rate, it is considered to be indicated in lumbar fractures, revision of pseudarthrosis, spondylolisthesis with or without reduction, and failed surgery with marked instability.\r"

In an attempt to improve this, high-dose intraarterial 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) was utilized on 41 patients with these neoplasms over a 4-year period at our institution. Eight of the 41 patients came to biopsy or autopsy at times sufficiently following intraarterial BCNU infusion and with adequate tissue samples to evaluate the histological changes induced by the drug. Two of the eight patients received no additional radiotherapy or chemotherapy. The other five received conventional whole brain irradiation, and one additionally received 50 mg of intravenous 2-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (FUdR). The eight patients showed mild to severe amounts of bland coagulative necrosis, vascular hyalinization, perithelial fibroblastic proliferation, and endothelial atypia. One of these patients had a recognized severe clinical leukoencephalopathy, and the pathological changes were maximal in this individual. Six patients had radiological evidence of increased necrosis and clinical deterioration prebiopsy or preautopsy, but, within this group, there were no distinguishing clinical features. Microscopic changes were severe in two of these patients. A final patient died of unrelated septic shock 5 days after a single infusion of intraarterial BCNU, and the microscopic changes were least extensive in her. This study suggests that high-dose intraarterial BCNU can cause a leukoencephalopathy, sometimes severe, either alone or in synergistic fashion with cranial irradiation. Occurrence of such leukoencephalopathy is not always predictable based on BCNU dosage and cannot always be reliably distinguished from tumor regrowth or tumor necrosis by radiological and clinical evaluation. Hence, caution most be exercised in continuation of high-dose intraarterial BCNU protocols.\r"

Light microscopically, the cyst was found to be lined by a single layer of cuboidal epithelial cells. Electron microscope examination revealed that the epithelial cells of the cyst possessed clear nuclei, abundant tonofilaments, and glycogen granules, featured as well as the usual organellae. The free surface of the epithelial cells had numerous finger-like microvilli with coating materials. These cells were interconnected by well-developed desmosomes and interdigitations, and also possessed basal lamina materials on the basal surface. These cytological features suggest a heterogenous origin of the cells rather than a neuroepithelial one.\r"

The decline occurred in all age and sex groups, but it occurred earlier in women than in men. The rates stabilized in the 1970s, and did so earlier in women. For 1980-1984, the incidence rate of stroke was 17% higher than that for 1975-1979. The onset of the decline in incidence rates coincided with the introduction of effective antihypertensive therapy, but stabilized and increased rates were associated with continuing improvement in the control of hypertension. The increase in the incidence rates of stroke coincided with the introduction of computed tomography, which appeared to increase the detection of less severe strokes.\r"

Stroke occurred in 14 (15%) of 91 consecutive patients with documented SLE; nine (64%) of the 14 had multiple cerebral infarcts. Factors associated with stroke and the frequency of stroke were systemic thrombosis (30%), elevated partial thromboplastin time (36%), spontaneous abortion (50%), age over 60 years (57%), transient ischemic attacks (57%), previous stroke (64%), and cardiac valvular disease (86%). The major period of risk for the first stroke was during the first 5 years of SLE. The most frequent etiology was a cardiogenic embolus or an antibody-mediated hypercoagulable state, with cerebral vasculitis occurring only in association with infection. Because of the decreased fibrinolysis seen in patients with SLE, anticoagulant therapy may be the most effective preventive treatment currently available. Anticoagulant therapy seemed to prevent recurrent focal cerebral ischemia in our patients and was associated with relatively few and minor complications. Patients with a history of transient ischemic attacks or cardiac valvular lesions are at high (57% and 87%, respectively) risk of stroke. Patients who have had a stroke are at high (64%) risk for a recurrent stroke. Anticoagulant therapy is recommended for all of these patients.\r"

FpA levels were markedly elevated during the first week after stroke and declined slowly during the first month. Mean FpA levels were not significantly elevated in chronic stroke patients. Mean XDP levels were slightly elevated during the first week and increased during the next 2 weeks after stroke. B-beta 1-42 and B-beta 15-42 levels were not elevated at any time following acute stroke. Our data suggest that fibrin formation greatly exceeds endogenous fibrinolysis during the acute phase of ischemic stroke. Endogenous fibrinolysis develops slowly following stroke. Prolonged elevation of FpA concentration suggests that thrombin activity and fibrin formation continue for up to 4 weeks in some patients with ischemic stroke.\r"

Hemorrhagic infarction during the month after the embolic event was evident in 65 patients (40.6%). Initial angiography a median of 1.5 (range 1-60) days after the event revealed occlusion of the cerebral arteries in 117 of 142 patients (82.4%), and reopening of the vessels was observed in 56 (94.9%) of 59 patients who had follow-up angiography a median of 20 (range 3-47) days after the event. The incidence of hemorrhagic infarction was higher in patients greater than or equal to 70 years old (31 of 61, 50.8%) than in those aged 50-69 years (27 of 72, 37.5%) or less than 50 years (seven of 27, 25.9%) (greater than or equal to 70 vs. less than 50, p less than 0.05). In patients with moderate or large infarcts, hemorrhagic infarction developed in 50.0% or 51.5%, respectively, while in those with small infarcts it developed in only 2.9% (p less than 0.05). No correlation was found between hemorrhagic infarction and history of hypertension or blood pressure during the acute stage of stroke. Thrombolytic and/or anticoagulant therapy did not affect the incidence of hemorrhagic infarction (40.0% with vs. 40.7% without therapy) but tended to cause massive hematoma. Our results indicate that hemorrhagic transformation in cerebral embolism is caused not only by reopening of the occluded vessels but also by other factors such as age and size of the infarct. Hypertension per se seems to be less important for hemorrhagic infarction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Therefore, we studied the effect of aspirin/dipyridamole therapy in inhibiting platelet activating factor-induced platelet activation in acute ischemic stroke patients, 23 taking aspirin/dipyridamole and 21 untreated. Aspirin/dipyridamole-treated patients failed to show suppression of platelet activating factor-induced platelet aggregation even though collagen-induced activation was inhibited, suggesting that platelet activating factor acts by cyclooxygenase-independent mechanisms. Failure to suppress cyclooxygenase-independent mechanisms of platelet activation may explain the limited usefulness of current antiplatelet therapy, aspirin in particular, in stroke prevention. The role of selective platelet activating factor antagonists both in isolation and combined with aspirin needs to be investigated for their usefulness in the treatment and prevention of ischemic stroke.\r"

All patients were evaluated within 30 days after infarction and had carotid artery studies (arteriography in 17, duplex ultrasound in 14). Fifteen patients had echocardiography. Risk factors for atherosclerosis were chronic hypertension in 20 patients, smoking in 17, diabetes in 10, age greater than 69 years in eight, and elevated serum cholesterol concentration in three. The percentage of patients with extracranial carotid artery stenosis (four of 31, 13%) and the severity of stenosis (mild in two, moderate in two) were similar to that reported in neurologically asymptomatic individuals. The percentage of patients with intracranial carotid artery stenosis (one of 17, 6%) or potential cardiac sources of emboli (two of 31, 6%) was also low. Our findings suggest that infarctions in the anterior choroidal artery territory usually result from small-vessel disease.

Blood flow was measured with [131I]iodoantipyrine and protein synthesis with [14C]leucine using double-tracer autoradiography and trichloroacetic acid wash-incubation for removal of nonincorporated tracer radioactivity. Specific activity of blood and brain leucine and [14C]leucine incorporation into brain proteins was also measured by conventional high-performance liquid chromatography to validate the autoradiographic approach. In control gerbils, gray matter blood flow ranged between 180 and 220 ml/100 g/min and fractional amino acid incorporation was approximately 80%. Unilateral carotid artery occlusion resulted in graded ischemia with blood flow between 10 and 100 ml/100 g/min. Regional cerebral protein synthesis gradually declined at blood flows of less than 100 ml/100 g/min and approached 0 at a blood flow of 40 ml/100 g/min. This threshold for complete suppression of protein synthesis is much higher than that for maintenance of tissue energy state and suggests that the size of an infarct after focal ischemia is determined by the suppression of protein synthesis rather than by the breakdown of energy metabolism.\r"

Infusion of 10 micrograms/g 1-BI reduced mean +/- SEM cerebral TXB2 concentration to 11 +/- 3 pg/mg brain protein in five rats (p less than or equal to 0.002). Mean +/- SEM hemispheric cerebral blood flow measured in four ischemic control rats after 60 minutes of reperfusion was 42 +/- 9 ml/100 g brain/min compared with 104 +/- 13 ml/100 g brain/min in three 1-BI-treated rats (p less than or equal to 0.001). Mean +/- SEM hippocampal blood flow in four ischemic control rats after 60 minutes of reperfusion was 51 +/- 14 ml/100 g brain/min compared with 125 +/- 25 ml/100 g brain/min in three 1-BI-treated rats (p less than or equal to 0.04). We conclude that selective inhibition of thromboxane synthase may alleviate ischemic brain damage by reducing cerebral TXA2 concentrations and elevating cerebral blood flow.\r"

Shortly (10 minutes, 1 hour) after the ischemic insult, the levels of the amino acids alanine and gamma-aminobutyric acid are elevated and that of glutamate is depressed in all regions except the cerebellum. The levels of these species return to control values by 24 hours postischemia. No changes are observed in the levels of aspartate or N-acetylaspartate. Greatly elevated levels of acetate 10 minutes postischemia, particularly in the hippocampus, may be due in part to metabolic degradation of fatty acids released due to membrane breakdown. Elevated levels of lactate persist for up to 7 days postischemia, suggesting that normal mitochondrial functioning is not fully restored following the ischemic insult.\r"

  ".W": "Focal cerebral ischemia was produced in 45 rats by occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery. Groups of rats were investigated over a long period after occlusion, that is, from a few hours to 42 days after the production of focal ischemia. Light microscopy showed infarcts in the frontoparietal cortex and the lateral caudoputamen. The ischemic changes closely resembled those found in ischemic infarcts in humans and followed a similar pattern over time. Measurements of the sizes of the infarct, the ipsilateral (operated) hemisphere, and the contralateral hemisphere from camera lucida drawings revealed that the infarct size changed with time after occlusion. Rats killed during the first 7 days (acute phase) had the largest infarcts; in rats killed thereafter, the infarct size diminished. The size of the ipsilateral hemisphere also changed with time; during the first 7 days after occlusion this hemisphere was swollen and larger than the contralateral hemisphere. We suggest that these acute changes are caused by cerebral edema. After the first 7 days, enlargement of the ipsilateral hemisphere gave way to a significant reduction in the size of both the ipsilateral hemisphere and the infarct. We believe that the major reasons for this shift in size are resorption of fluid together with diminished production of edema and elimination of dead cells by macrophages. We suggest that the amount of tissue loss (i.e., the degree of atrophy and the remaining infarct \"scar\") found 21-42 days after occlusion (during the late phase) is a measure of the total amount of tissue that succumbed as a consequence of ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

AGF 2 (30 mg/kg) was administered intravenously immediately after initiation of recirculation and intramuscularly twice a day for 48 hours. Our results show that treatment with AGF 2 significantly accelerated the rate of neurologic recovery. Improvement was evident 5 hours after ischemia; full neurologic recovery was observed in half of the monkeys 48 hours after ischemia. This recovery was associated with a less severe reduction in cerebral blood flow without a concomitant increase in the cerebral metabolic rate.\r"

Relaxation induced by nicotine was abolished by hexamethonium and was markedly inhibited after exposure to oxyhemoglobin. A low concentration of KCl (5 mM) elicited relaxation that was abolished by ouabain and significantly reduced by oxyhemoglobin. Endothelium-dependent relaxation caused by calcium ionophore A23187 was attenuated, and that caused by substance P was reversed to contraction after exposure to oxyhemoglobin. Contraction elicited by substance P also depended on endothelium and was abolished by indomethacin. Relaxation induced by TRK-100, a stable analogue of prostaglandin I2, was moderately attenuated by oxyhemoglobin. On the other hand, concentration-dependent relaxation induced by papaverine and contractile responses to KCl, serotonin, and prostaglandin F2 alpha were not affected by oxyhemoglobin. Our results indicate that vasodilations mediated by vasodilator nerves, the electrogenic sodium pump, endothelium-derived relaxing factor, and prostaglandin I2 were impaired in dog cerebral arteries exposed to oxyhemoglobin. After exposure to oxyhemoglobin, vascular endothelium appears to participate in cerebroarterial contraction via a release of vasoconstrictor prostaglandins. These actions of oxyhemoglobin may be involved in the genesis of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage.\r"

The right middle cerebral artery was occluded with miniature aneurysm clips for 3 hours via a transorbital approach; blood pressure was reduced concomitantly to decrease the collateral circulation. Removal of the clips initiated a 45-minute period of normotensive reperfusion. After sacrifice, the brain was removed and sectioned for comparison of right- versus left-hemisphere platelet deposition. Platelets were selectively deposited in the territory of the occluded right middle cerebral artery. Significant deposition was found in the caudate nucleus, internal capsule, parietal cortex, and the centrum semiovale. Our findings support the evidence that platelets are deposited in the microvasculature during temporary severe focal cerebral ischemia.\r"

Six cats were treated with cilostazol and four with 30% N,N-dimethylformamide in 70% saline (solvent). The brain surface was irradiated with ultraviolet rays through a cranial window for 3 minutes to selectively damage the endothelium of the pial vessels in both groups. Beginning 32 minutes after termination of the irradiation, the middle cerebral artery was occluded for 30 minutes. Thirty minutes before occlusion, intravenous infusion of 30 micrograms/kg/min cilostazol or 0.1 ml/kg/min solvent was begun and continued until the end of the study. Before occlusion, the infusion of cilostazol induced a significant (p less than 0.05) dilatation while the infusion of solvent produced no significant changes in the diameter of the pial arteries. The pial veins of solvent-treated cats showed significant (p less than 0.05) constriction during occlusion, whereas cilostazol-treated cats exhibited only mild constriction of the pial veins. The formation of platelet thrombi after occlusion was significantly (p less than 0.05) inhibited in the pial veins of cilostazol-treated compared with solvent-treated cats. Similarly, the microcirculation of the pial veins was effectively restored after reopening of the middle cerebral artery in cilostazol-treated compared with solvent-treated cats. Our data suggest that cilostazol is an effective antithrombotic agent as well as a potent vasodilator acting on vascular smooth muscle.\r"

We subjected 16 ventilated newborn lambs to 75-90 minutes of hypoxia and hypercarbia that resulted in bradycardia and systemic hypotension over the final 15 minutes of the insult. At the end of asphyxia, the lambs were resuscitated and returned to control ventilator settings. Samples of brain were removed 5 minutes (n = 8) and 2 hours (n = 8) after asphyxia. Each group of eight lambs was subdivided into those less than 3 or greater than 3 days old to evaluate the effect of age on postasphyxia mitochondrial function. After classification into nonsynaptic and synaptic mitochondria, mitochondrial respiration (oxygen consumption) was measured using five different substrates. Data from asphyxiated lambs were compared with that from a control group of ventilated nonasphyxiated lambs (n = 8). In the lambs less than 3 days old, there was significant depression of mean +/- SEM nonsynaptic mitochondrial state 3 (adenosine diphosphate-dependent) respiration to 29.5 +/- 5.2% of control with four of the five substrates and of state 4 respiration to 33.7 +/- 0.9% of control with three of the five substrates 5 minutes after asphyxia.

A model was developed for determining an appropriate size of the donor pool for a community donor plateletpheresis program that would incorporate the average number of donors needed per patient, the level of HLA compatibility to be maintained between patient and donor, and the frequencies of patient and donor HLA phenotypes. A database of 4338 plateletpheresis transfusions given to 591 patients from a pool of up to 870 community donors over a 3-year period was analyzed retrospectively to validate the estimates of the average number of donors needed to support a patient, which ranged from 4 to 33 donors. This database was also used to illustrate the application of the pool size determination model. Model results suggest that plateletpheresis donor pools of 1000 to 3000 donors are capable of meeting the transfusion needs of most patients at an HLA-match grade of B2 or better.\r"

HLA concentrations were measured by using a competitive enzyme-linked immunoassay. The results showed that both platelet and plasma HLA concentrations varied within +/- 20 percent of the mean values in each individual. Changes in plasma and platelet HLA concentrations were also studied in 5 units of random-donor platelets during in vitro storage. HLA concentrations were determined every other day over a 5-day period. There was no significant quantitative change in the platelet and plasma HLA concentrations during the 5 days of in vitro storage.

The hollow-fiber membrane retained 94 percent of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol presented to it, and allowed passage of 83 percent of the albumin, 68 percent of the IgG, and 47 percent of the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Both plasma exchange and plasma filtration decreased the patient's total and LDL cholesterol levels by 80 percent. However, filtration removed significantly less HDL than did exchange (54 versus 71% reduction in HDL levels, respectively); preserved significantly higher levels of IgG, clotting factors, and complement components; and avoided the need for expensive albumin replacement solutions. In addition, the patient tolerated the filtration procedures significantly better than the exchanges. Newer apheresis techniques that selectively deplete plasma of LDL cholesterol, such as secondary membrane filtration, are likely to replace plasma exchange as the therapy of choice in patients with homozygous hypercholesterolemia.\r"

  ".W": "During a 3 year period, from August 1985 to August 1988, 18 HIV 2-infected blood donors were detected in France as a result of systematic HIV 1 screening. These sera were characterized as HIV 2 by specific Western blot and synthetic peptides. Within the same period, 40 other HIV 2 infected subjects were identified by our study group, independently of blood donations. Thirty of these 58 subjects living in France originate from West Africa (8 blood donors), 3 (I blood donor) are Portuguese men who had lived in West Africa and 25 (9 blood donors) are of French origin; among these, 16 have had a known close contact with West Africa. When HIV 2-infected subjects were asymptomatic, cross reactivity between antibodies to HIV 2 and HIV 1 proteins was generally observed with the two-step ELISA assays using total HIV 1 proteins; it was poor with the competitive assays and variable with the assays using recombinant proteins. When the subjects had signs of immunodeficiency, cross reactivity decreased. The data confirm that HIV 2 is not widespread in France and that most of HIV 2-infected but asymptomatic subjects are recognized by several HIV 1 ELISA assays. Accordingly, systematic screening for HIV 2 with an additional test cannot be recommended at the present time, but a combined HIV 1 and HIV 2 test will be useful when available.\r"

We evaluated the effects of magnesium citrate (MC) on the excretion of activated charcoal in healthy volunteers alone and with concurrent administration of the anticholinergic drug clidinium bromide. Forty subjects were randomized to clidinium bromide 5 mg or placebo capsule (PC), followed by activated charcoal 15 g and magnesium citrate or a placebo liquid (PL). The onset and duration of excretion of activated charcoal were noted. Mean onset times for activated charcoal were: group I (CB, MC) 4.5 +/- 2.1 h; group II (CB, PL) 17.0 +/- 10.0 h; group III (PC, MC) 6.3 +/- 5.8 h; and group IV (PC, PL) 20.6 +/- 8.4 h. The onset of excretion of activated charcoal was statistically different in both magnesium citrate groups as compared with the placebo liquid groups. The duration of activated charcoal in the stool was similar among the groups. The addition of clidinium bromide did not appear to affect gastrointestinal transit time. These results support previous studies of the effects of cathartics on the excretion of activated charcoal, and suggest that cathartic efficacy is not inhibited by anticholinergic drugs when used in therapeutic doses.\r"

In vitro studies demonstrated that all but one of the products met the British Pharmacopoeia 1980 disintegration time specifications. The comparative bioavailability of four of the internationally available brands of praziquantel tablets were then studied in eight healthy volunteers using a crossover design. Serum praziquantel levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Individual serum profiles were analyzed for pharmacokinetic parameters such as maximum serum concentration, time to reach maximum, and area under the curve. Following administration of praziquantel 40 mg/kg po, the mean peak serum concentrations and the time to reach the peak ranged from 1.007 to 1.625 micrograms/ml and from 1.72 to 2.81 hours, respectively. The elimination half-life of praziquantel was 1.15 (0.94-1.25) hours. Differences greater than 20 percent (p less than 0.05) were noted for these parameters between the original brand and the generic formulations. The relative bioavailabilities of the generic praziquantel formulations, with respect to the original brand, were 91.25, 80.95, and 69.86 percent. This is due to the failure of disintegration and subsequently poor dissolution. The effect of 30 percent reduction of bioavailability may lead to unacceptably high rates of treatment failure.\r"

A confluence of factors, including the number of Americans with CHF, the spiraling costs of hospital care, and increasing interest in cost-effective home care, contribute to the current efforts to develop an effective, nontoxic therapy that effectively increases myocardial contractility and output and can be administered within the confines of the home. Given that preliminary clinical trials in the hospital setting with amrinone have produced positive results, the transition of this therapy to the home, when administered intermittently via central venous catheter and infusion pump, was undertaken. In order to prolong and increase quality of life in terminal CHF patients, intermittent amrinone infusions were provided at home to four patients as part of our pilot program. All four patients met the criteria for New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class IV heart failure, and none had responded to conventional therapy suitable for outpatient maintenance. The patients also shared strong family support and an intense desire to improve the quality of remaining life. All four patients and designated family members were trained in the specifics of aseptic technique, medication dose preparation, central venous catheter care, and operation of an infusion pump. An ambulatory pump was used in three of the four patients. Subsequent to the initiation of intermittent home amrinone infusions, all four patients had greater tolerance to limited exercise and/or ambulation secondary to increased cardiac output and diuresis. Patients survived 8, 10, 47, and 56 weeks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Blood samples were obtained from hospitalized patients receiving phenytoin and were assayed for free and total phenytoin concentrations. Estimated normalized phenytoin concentrations based on free drug concentration were compared statistically with normalized concentrations calculated from the two equations via Student's t-test. The equation for normalizing phenytoin concentrations in hypoalbuminemic patients significantly underpredicted normalized phenytoin concentrations 15.7 +/- 8.5 versus 19.9 +/- 12.1 mg/L (p less than 0.001). In patients with renal failure, the mean phenytoin concentration from the respective equations and that based on free concentration were 14.1 +/- 6.2 and 14.0 +/- 7.9 mg/L, respectively. However, in 5 of 11 renal failure patients the equation resulted in over- or underprediction by at least 25 percent. Neither equation should be used clinically to normalize phenytoin concentrations in these patient populations.\r"

A 45.5 percent response rate was achieved after one original mailing and two follow-ups. Most consumers had not used NDSs except for advice on nonprescription drugs and advice on minor health problems. Nevertheless, a substantial number of consumers expressed interest in many of the remaining services, including advice on diagnostic test kits and information on poison prevention. Consumers' past use of NDSs and their perceptions of pharmacists as providers of these services were important factors in the consumers' intention to use NDSs. Other variables significantly correlated with average intention to use NDSs were: type of pharmacy patronized, anxiety about health, age, and education. It is recommended that future investigations explore in detail consumer behavior with regard to nondispensing services.\r"

  ".W": "This is the first case report of esophageal injury caused by Percogesic. A 31-year-old healthy white woman presented with dysphagia and retrosternal pain following the ingestion of a Percogesic tablet. The patient felt the tablet lodge in her mid-esophagus even though she ingested it with a cupful of water and in the upright position. Additional fluid was taken to dislodge the tablet with no success. Past medical history was unremarkable for heartburn, regurgitation, or dysphagia. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a well-circumscribed deep ulceration in the mid-esophagus. Hospitalization was required due to persistent dysphagia. Treatment consisted of a three-day regimen of liquid antacid, intravenous ranitidine hydrochloride, and metoclopramide. This case emphasizes that pill entrapment can occur in the esophagus in healthy individuals, even when taken in the upright position with plenty of fluid; and mucosal injury can be produced by drugs not generally reported to cause gastrointestinal adverse effects or mucosal injury.\r"

A common metabolic intermediate is offered as a possible explanation of the mechanism. Clinicians should be careful when choosing alternatives in patients with hypersensitivity reactions to anticonvulsants. Valproic acid may be the safest choice in this setting.\r"

  ".W": "This case report describes a 60-year-old diabetic patient whose daily insulin requirements increased by 30 percent following nifedipine administration. Glucagon and intravenous glucose tolerance tests were performed with and without nifedipine treatment, in order to evaluate the roles of decreased pancreatic beta islet cell function and augmented insulin peripheral resistance in the diabetogenic effect of nifedipine. Insulin and calculated glucose peripheral utilization extrapolated from the glucose concentration curves were not significantly different. C-peptide levels tended to be lower with nifedipine treatment at baseline and during the glucagon tests. This may suggest that the altered glycemic control associated with nifedipine was mediated by a suppressed islet beta cell function. The effect of calcium channel-blockers upon glycemic control and the possible mechanisms involved are discussed.\r"

Three weeks later, the patient was admitted with a worsening of symptoms. Cerebral arteriography revealed significant bilateral vertebral artery stenosis. Symptoms continued to progress in the hospital, and at the time of posterior circulation revascularization the patient had a persistent bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia and right ptosis. The need for a neurovascular workup and adjustment of therapy in patients with antihypertensive-associated cerebral ischemia is discussed.\r"
